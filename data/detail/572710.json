Nancy Drew: Labyrinth of Lies is a game that cannot be missed by any fan of either the franchise, adventure games, or simply of a good mystery.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcomputertimes.com%2FLabyrinthofLies.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >Computer Times</a><br><br>\u201cOverall, this was a solid addition to the Nancy Drew series. Diehard fans will be relieved to see some recurring problems get addressed, and casual players will enjoy the variety of puzzles and the characters that make this engine churn. If you\u2019re a Greek history nut looking for an authentic experience of the country, Labyrinth of Lies probably isn\u2019t for you, but it\u2019s a good way to dip your toe in the water. This game won\u2019t become the stuff of myths, but it\u2019s a worthy diversion.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fjustadventure.com%2Findex.php%2F2013-05-20-21-09-14%2F2379-nancy-drew-labyrinth-of-lies-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >Just Adventure</a><br>", "header_image": "https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572710/header.jpg?t=1678396945", "capsule_image": "https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1678396945", "capsule_imagev5": "https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1678396945", "website": "https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-labyrinth-of-lies/", "pc_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows\u00ae Vista/7/8/10/11<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.5 GHZ or greater Pentium 4 CPU or equivalent class<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 128 MB DirectX 9.0 compatible video card<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> 16 bit DirectX compatible sound card</li></ul>"}, "mac_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X: 10.6.8 Snow Leopard/10.7 Lion/10.8 Mountain Lion/10.9 Mavericks/10.10 Yosemite/10.11 El Capitan/10.12 Sierra/High Sierra.<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel processor<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel GMA X3100, ATI X1600, NVIDIA 7300 graphics card or better<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> \u26a0\ufe0fWill NOT run on Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, or higher Mac operating systems.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u26a0\ufe0fThis game will NOT run on PowerPC (G3/G4/G5) based Mac systems (PowerMac)</li></ul>"}, "linux_requirements": [], "legal_notice": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Her Interactive, Inc.
