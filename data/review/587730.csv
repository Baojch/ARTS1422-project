It's a pretty relaxing game. The music, when turned on, is very relaxing. The whole experience is very calming. Sit back. Crack open a cold one and throw planets at a sun.

There are a few bugs. The last item on your pallet will often be super sized. You have a limited number of items you can spawn from your pallet and as things are destroyed they don't come back so you have to reset.

It's probably not enough content to warrant the 1.99 price tag but Im still going to give it a positive review. It does exactly what it says it's going to do and in its simplicity, it's actually enjoyable.

Unfortunately even with the super low sound even this got a copyright claim by the asshats over at The Orchard Music on behalf of ant-zen. Not only do they copyright claim licensed music but they don't review/acknowledge disputes. Sorry, /rant.",1486924921,1486924921,True,1,3,0.483931958675384521,0,False,False,False,False,,,

　　《轨道喷射》(Orbital Injection)是一款模拟休闲游戏。游戏中，玩家可以自由控制地球与卫星等等的运行轨迹，模拟太阳系环境。
　　游戏在引力方面的模拟十分到位，将太阳慢慢吸引星球与卫星的靠近放大化，考验玩家摆放轨迹。物理模拟的感应也很精准，能精确反应玩家抛掷星球的力度。
　　游戏建模也较为精致，具有一定观赏性。若玩家将头探进太阳内部窥视，还会发现制作方设计的小细节，告诉你快出去这里很危险等等小提示语。
　　该游戏最大的缺点就是缺乏游戏性，游戏过程中没有判定分数、胜负条件，以致于其更像是一款纯粹的模拟应用，满足玩家对太阳系运作轨迹的好奇心而已。不过于应用来说，当中所设计的星系或者元素内容又不够丰富，十几二十分钟体验后，玩家很快就会腻味。
　　游戏在Steam商店中售价为11元，价格不高。若是想要一款游戏的玩家，不建议考虑，若想要一款模拟应用，探索太阳系的运作，则可以考虑在其进行50%的折扣活动时，考虑进行购买。
