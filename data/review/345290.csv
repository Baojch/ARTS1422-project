First, complaints about how well it runs or the fact that it runs in DOSBox. Anyone that plays older games will recognize that many of them have to run in DOSBox due to changes in OS. This isn't anything unusual, and really shouldn't be treated like it is. I've been playing it on Windows 10, and aside from minor graphics glitches during transition screens, it's been fine.
Second is complaints about the story or humor. Since I haven't finished, I can't comment on the story to any great depth, but it's been pretty good so far. While being humorous, and a little bit of a spoof, the story is easy enough to follow, and the humor is typical British humor for the time.
That said, there's a little bit of learning curve, and you really need to read the manual to have any clue how to do anything. The limited saves is fairly novel for a game of this type, but annoying when there's so many unexpected ways to die.
Overall, I'm enjoying the game, and I plan to finish it. If anything major shows up, I'll mention it.",1672573649,1672573649,True,4,0,0.540115475654602051,0,True,False,False,True,,,

TLDR: Impressive cartoony cinematic oriented spooky walk clicker. Dosbox era and very dated. Juvenile in tone. Hard trial and error scripting.

This is an obscure game in which you navigate confusing environments involving portals. The saveslots are an inventory item that use consumables. Same consumable are used to do some puzzles.

The characters are silly, the main character in particular seems to be some knock off bart simpson type that tries to be zany. 

The semi open 3D modeled environments and attempt at an usual and mature setting were welcome but did not really come together cohesively.

Conclusion: This is not very enjoyable, even with a walkthrough you are likely to hit hard game over states, get confused navigating, get stuck and more. The cartoon universe is not very well fleshened out, the character design boils everything down to a surface deep stereotype. Puzzle design was obscure and cryptic.",1536839176,1536943345,False,8,0,0.585462093353271484,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Lots of puzzles too, usually involving using items in conjunction with one another.
