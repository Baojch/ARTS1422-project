My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1706871079,1706871079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

El juego es una mezcla de Sonic con Mario Bros, esta copado, musica y graficos lindos, no es la gran cosa pero tiene su espiritu de los 80-90.

Even the level design for some of the levels is amazingly familiar... this might as well just be a reskin.  Or, more likely, a lawsuit just waiting to happen.  Copyright is serious business.  That's the first of many reasons gamers should avoid putting down money for this.. the first Cease and Desist or DMCA claim that shows up, and this game will be gone. 

There's little else to discuss about actual gameplay (if you can get it to work, console peasant childrens toy controller is required because the developer doesn't understand PC gaming).  It's just Super Mario Bros.  All that's left to discuss is the huge list of defects and flaws, which, in the interests of thoroughness, we'll get into now.

The game doesn't have any save game features, despite that being a basic standard for all games of this time.  The developer might defend this as an attempt to make the game seem more ""difficult"" without them having to balance the game or do their job properly with engaging and challenging level design, but it's just as likely they simply couldn't work out how to make a save game feature work.  Either way, that's a defect that adds another reason for gamers to avoid this game.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game only displays in 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio.  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

In a sheer insult to PC gamers, the developer has locked out keyboard and mouse controls on this game.  The developer demands, without compromise, that you must use a console peasant children's toy gamepad to play this garbage game.  This is simply unacceptable, developers must never dictate to gamers how a game is to be consumed.

Another problem here is that you can't alt+tab out of the game properly, another shortcoming that should have been picked up with even a basic amount of software testing.  This is extremely frustrating in the modern era of gaming and it's a shortcoming that gamers are unlikely to accept. It's likely this defect is due to the way the developer arrogantly locks out many of the the keyboard functions, or some other general incompetence.

While this is on PC, it has all the hallmarks and deficiencies of a console game, from the clunkier than needed control scheme to the less than cutting edge graphics.  There's 10's of thousands of PC games on Steam, and PC gamers deserve only the best.  This might not appeal to many gamers due to the lack of PC-centric design.  It's unclear why this game was never accepted on the video game console appliances it seems to have been designed for.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is most commonly used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.

A strong argument can be made that construction kits like GameMaker Studio should never be used to make games for profit, as the ""developer"", cbritez has done here.  These construction kits are intended to teach people some of the basic principles of game development, and to make small demos to pass around with friends.  They're not intended to replace to actual work of real, professional game developers.  So it's inappropriate when amateurs try to use these for profit, without any actual, real game development effort taking place.  This doesn't result in products that have any real meaningful value for gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Super Jagua has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for completing a level with less than 18 jumps, trivial to achieve, but less than 5 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 5 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the game?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Super Jagua is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.",1688225737,1688225737,False,4,2,0.260713338851928711,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The game has eight worlds, each containing four handcrafted levels, providing a significant amount of content for players to enjoy. The game offers challenging gameplay, with no saves and no continues, which adds to the nostalgic feel of the game.

The graphics in Super Jagua are spot-on, with every graphic created from a single 24-color palette, which gives the game an authentic retro look. The full 8-bit chiptune soundtrack complements the game's graphics and helps to transport players back to the 80s. The game's story revolves around a brave dog embarking on a journey to save the beloved princess and her little puppies, which has been kidnaped by a mysterious demon.

The game's controls are smooth and intuitive, making it easy for players to run, jump, and swim through levels, discover secrets, and fight bosses. The levels are well designed, with a variety of obstacles and power-ups to keep the gameplay interesting. The boss fights are epic, providing a real challenge for players.

In conclusion, Super Jagua is a must-play for fans of classic platformers and anyone looking for a nostalgic gaming experience.

1. There is no saving the game, you must beat it in one session without closing it or getting a game over.

2. The game is more challenging than it seems. If you're experienced enough with platformers then you can probably beat it in your first few attempts, and it isn't as hard as the original SMB, especially if you use warp zones, but it isn't easy either.

3. The spot where you can bounce off an enemy is very small. You need to aim for the center of their heads. If you come in from a diagonal angle you'll just take damage or die. It isn't like SMB where Mario kills anything while he's falling. This applies to bosses as well. Sometimes you need to hit the head, others the tail or backside.

4. The game ran very slowly until I took it off fullscreen mode. I haven't seen anyone else have that problem in the reviews but I thought I'd throw it in here for good measure. Obviously playing in windowed mode isn't as fun or easy, it stays fixed at like half my computer display.

5. Check the steam community for hints on where to find warps and hidden power-ups. And use code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, run, jump) at the title screen before you press new game for double lives.",1673731128,1673731128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The problem with the absent of save points is that you need to complete the whole game in one session. You close the game, you have to start over.

与马里奥兄弟不同的一点是控制。Super Jagua里的控制判定很迷，有时会觉得有点奇怪，它远没有马里奥兄弟精确。

在马里奥兄弟中，当你被击中时，你的角色会缩小，如果他们已经很小，他们就会死亡。在Super Jagua中，你的角色在被击中一秒钟后会闪烁，然后恢复正常。游戏不像马里奥兄弟那样向玩家准确的传递信息。

吸引人的敌人，美妙的音乐，这真的可能是一个不错的游戏，但保存功能让我想砸电脑，如果它能解决这个保存功能问题，那么还算是个不错的游戏。",1643015655,1643015655,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really tried to like it but just one issue after another made me quickly dislike it. For starters even though on Steam it lists “Full Controller Support” it didn’t work with my Logitech F310 or my Steam Controller. Both work with other games. I tried on two different distros, Manjaro and Linux Mint, and had the same issue on both where the gamepads didn’t work at all. I then tried to use the keyboard but it just felt unatural and the movement felt strange and not responsive enough causing me to mistime jumps often. Then came the last and final issue, the nail in the coffin: the game has no save system. You are expected to complete it in one playthrough. I can understand this as an option, a sort of iron man mode but to have no save system at all is just lazy in this day and age. The game does have a decent soundtrack and uses next to no system resources allowing it to run on a potatoe of a computer so it isn’t without some positives but they don’t come anywhere close to outweighing the negatives.

	I played Super Jagua on Linux. It never crashed on me once. It is locked to 60 FPS and has no graphics options. Alt-Tab doesn’t work. During play my GPU usage was 2.5-7.5%; my VRAM usage was 490MB-633MB; my CPU usage was 9-10%; and my total system RAM used was 2.5GB. The game only uses up 10MB of disk space and ran at a constant 60 FPS.

	I played for a total of 26 minutes and got through four of 32 levels so take that as an indication of how long the game lasts for although some levels are harder than others obviously. I paid $1.09 CAD for the game and can’t say I got my money worth in value due to the mechanics and gamepad issues.

Specifically Mario Bros which I think it was heavily inspired by. It's actually quite a lot like Mario Bros in many ways but has it's own set of problems.

The biggest problem and only reason I would not recommend this is the save feature is broken. I played last night on the Steam Link and when I quit the game I said save and quit, and I saw a continue option. Today when I booted it up that option was gone and I had to start over from the beginning.

One thing that separates this from Mario Bros is the controls. They are very sloppy in Super Jagua and feel a bit strange at times. It's nowhere near as precise as Mario Bros. 

In Mario Bros when you get hit your character shrinks and if they are already small they die. In Super Jagua your character will flash when hit for a second and then go back to normal. For a long time I thought I also could take 2 hits in this game but recently it was only 1. It took a while but I finally figured out that if you are holding an item you have 2 hits and if not, just 1. The game doesn't relay info to the player as Mario Bros does.

Cute enemies, amazing chiptune music, this really could be an alright game but that save feature is really holding it back. It will never be Mario Bros which it really wants to be but it could be decent if it just gets this save feature figured out.

I wish there was a middle option between recommended and not recommended because that is where I would put this. SInce there is not a middle option, I would have to go with not recommended, at least until the save feature gets fixed.
That broken save feature is by far the biggest problem with this game that I have found.",1516805505,1666874582,False,10,0,0.603636980056762695,0,True,False,False,False,,,

To accomplish this, we must conquer 33 brutal levels with a grand sum of 15 lives, no continues. Right from the get go you'll notice a lot of similarities to Super Mario Bros 3 such as certain animations, enemies and UI. There is no denying that this is a love letter or clone of the Super Mario Bros series but it still manages to be a fun romp through familiar territories.

There are few graphic options and the game can only be played using a 4:3 ratio bringing back that retro annoyance of being easily blind sighted by enemies/objects just off the screen. It's a design decision to stay as true to 8Bit games as possible though having an option for Widescreen would have been appreciated. Starting up the game proper you will see a Mario 3 like overworld map with the long line of levels awaiting you. Most of them don't have midway checkpoints but are short enough to never become too frustrating and will immediately make you feel like giving it another go.

One of the major differences from the Mario series is that you can only take one hit before you are down for the count, no turning into a miniature version of yourself here. There are 4 unique items to collect out of bricks, them being a red bone that shoots horizontally, a white bone that shoots vertically, an umbrella to give you better midair control and finally a pair of glasses to see invisible secrets scattered throughout. Equipping any one of them will allow you to take two hits from enemies before losing a life so you'll be glad with whatever you happen to receive. Each of those items are useful in different situations so learning how to use them efficiently can make some levels far easier.

The only object you don't technically need are the Glasses as you can enter the invisible warp zones without them, though it is a risky affair trying to guess where they are with just 15 lives total. Enemies are mostly cutesy creatures, most of which are just going about their own business. For some odd reason there is no point system so killing them is completely unnecessary as they will get you no extra lives due to a lack of points. Luckily this is not the type of game to be completely unfair and you can go back to older levels to farm a few lives as needed via coin collecting. The difficulty itself is just easy enough as to not feel cheated and with it having great controls, most deaths will be on us.

It still packs quite a punch however, this is one made for those with more experience into the genre, similar to Mario: The Lost Levels. The springs, the auto scrolling levels and the underwater sections are all here and ready to test your skills once again. A minor gripe I have with this title is that a shadow under your character would make some levels much better as whenever you jump too high you'll have little clue as to where you are. Another slightly more annoying design decision is the lack of saving your progress so you'll have to beat the entire game in one go. The previously mentioned warp zones will allow you to skip a few levels if you know where they are so finding them is key if you plan to play in short bursts.

Every few levels lead to a boss fight against a giant creature such as a fish or a dinosaur that are all defeated by jumping on or with the bone item. They only take 3-4 hits so if you currently have a bone it'll be that much easier. There is one final hidden boss after the last level that makes up the level 33 for those wondering why there are only 32 blips on the over-world. There are several themes to explore after every few levels that keeps things fresh. Sadly, the music is nowhere near as varied and will get a tad old after some time.

Super Jagua is sold for less than a dollar and what it does offer for that low price is a steal. It may be similar to Mario in most regards though it clearly understands what made them so great and does enough as to not feel like a complete retread. Like an NES game it only uses two buttons not counting the Dpad for attack and jump so it is easy to pick up yet something that will challenge even the veterans of the genre. If you are looking for both a challenge and a blast to the past, Super Jagua is sure to satisfy both of your needs.",1480044809,1480044809,True,7,0,0.608484208583831787,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+Adorable dogs, monsters, and even bosses! :) Feeling bad when beating them.
+Great OST, exactly like the songs in golden days of NES and fat TV screens.
+Gameplay: You have 15 lives to beat the game (and you get +1 for each 100 gold coins), every level contains secret level full of coins, and other secret stuff I haven't discovered yet (those warp marbles), various levels have different mechanics - water level, boss castle, levels with moving screen forcing you to run faster etc etc, all the classic levels :)
+Steam achievements to unlock
+Costs only 1$!
+Steam cards!

Anyway, this is the most *classic* platformer I've played this year, and it definitely worth it :) Lots of fun!

Сюжет: Злой дракон, естественно козлина, похитил на невесту Суку (мы будем играть за кобеля). Наша задача дойти до этого позорного козла, замочить его и спасти нашу любимую Сучку.

Гемплей: Все как и раньше! Пиксельная графика в формате разрешения 640х480, та же мелодия с приставки ""Sega"" из далеких 90х. Бегим вперед, топчем врагов, правда не всех можно топтать, добегаем до конуры, и конец раунда. Через несколько раундов вы завершите часть игры, в конце которого вам нужно затоптать босса. Так же по пути будет секретные комнаты, если вы их найдете, в них естественно много монет. В кирпичах, которые, точно! разбиваем головой будут бонусы, которые дадут вам дополнительный шанс выжить.

Техническая часть: Все настройки игры изменяемые, вы сможете настроить игру под себя. Есть поддержка контроллера.

Стим бонусы: Есть достижения - это плюс, нет коллекционных карт - это минус.

Что не понравилось: Играл я играл, не долго, 20 мин, прошел 4 уровня, замочил босса. Выключил игру, включил позже и пи3дeц!!! Нужно играть сначала! Ну даже и этом момент перенисли из приставки. Уважаемый разработчик! Добавьте в игру сохранение пройденых уровней, на дворе 2016 год и мы играем на компьютере, в котором можно сохранить файлы, в том числе сохранения с игры.

Итог: Всем любителям ""Марио"" - обязательна к покупке! Тем кто не знает, что такое ""Марио"" - рекомендовано к покупке, хоть это и измененная версия, но все же прикольно, тем более цена на игру, чисто символическая)
