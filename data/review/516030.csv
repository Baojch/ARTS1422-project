You don't have to worry about building and sorting the precise deck, you don't have to worry about being matched against people with better decks. You all get the same but the order is random so the battles are fair more often than not. The battles are of a good length so they keep their excitement and intensity.

The single player mode takes the model above and adds the option to enhance your robot with extra abilities but still maintains that simplicity and easy to pick up. Each turn you move your robot around the board, pick up currency, add the abilities and then you're ready to fight. Some abilities apply outside the battles themselves which does a add a tactical element without bogging them down. The enjoyment is further enhanced by the quirky style of the robots, each has it's own personality and its bright colour scheme just adds to that. 

If you're looking for a game to have a blast, then you can't too far wrong with Insane Robots. For a card battle game, it's more focused on the fun than building deck, perfect for people who don't play card battle games.

Thanks for your review of Insane Robots.

I can confirm that it does take about 1 hour of play before most of the 22 tokens in the battle deck are unlocked, so it's likely you will not have seen the full variety of play after only 45 mins.

If you only saw 2 augments, it sounds like you were only gaining them through narrative events. You can find more augments in the tournament shops. There are 2-4 shops per arena, each containing 4 augments (as well as other power ups), so in a 1 hour session you could potentially find more than 30 augments if that was your focus. More unlock each tournament (over 100 in total) and they are also all unlocked in multiplayer.

Hope that helps and have fun if you decide to return to the game!

All the best,

Rob"

Eigentlich ja so überhaupt nicht mein Genre. Trotzdem muss ich sagen, das hier macht irgendwie Spaß. Ich versteh nur noch nicht so ganz warum... 

Ein kurzes ""Angezockt"" findet ihr hier:
https://youtu.be/WAJAE2polsg 

Pro:
- Comic-Grafik... wirklich sehr nett gemacht.
- Soundtrack (erinnert mich irgendwie an die guten alten Western)
- Einfach zu lernen, schwer zu meistern
- Witzige Figuren

Kontra:
- Könnte schnell etwas eintönig werden, auch wenn der Schwierigkeitsgrad gut ansteigt
- leider nur auf Englisch (ist ja noch im Early Access...)
- Die ""Versus-Bildschirme"" verschwinden etwas zu schnell, ich konnte die Gegener-Beschreibungen meist nicht ganz lesen
- Meckern ist bei diesem Spiel nur auf hohem Niveau (nicht die Handcreme) möglich

Würde ich mir dieses Spiel kaufen? Nö. Es ist halt einfach nicht mein Genre. Allerdings muss man sagen, dass ich bisher richtig viel Spaß hatte, die kleinen Roboter aufeinander losgehen zu lassen. Der Anspruch - für Spieler wie mich, die keinen Plan haben was sie da tun, weil sie keine Wumme am rechten Bildschirmrand sehen - ist angenehm und dieser Satz viel zu lang, was ihr sicherlich schon bemerkt und, so vermute ich, auch schon deutlich durch ekstatisches Schimpfen zum Ausdruck gebracht habt... 

Kurz gesagt: Dieses Spiel hat es geschafft meine Abneigung gegen ""Kampfkartenspiele"" ein wenig zu verringern. Das will schon was heißen!

Battles have a habit of going on forever but lack the mechanical variety required to keep the excitement running over long card exchanges.

To its credit, the battle system is deceptively complex - at first it seems very simple and one dimensional but it does expand in depth quite quickly with the introduction of about half a dozen different ""blocks"" that can be used during fights to your advantage (or disadvantage).

When weighing up the time I enjoyed with the game versus the time I spent wishing things would just move along, I ultimately feel it's more of a thumbs down than a thumbs up for me. It's a casual card battler and that's fine - the complexity isn't something I have an issue with.

It's more that by the time I actually finish a battle, I feel more a sense of relief as opposed to satisfaction or accomplishment.

Thanks for your review of Insane Robots.

I wanted to reassure you that AI opponents get tokens with exactly the same probability as you (unless that probability is modified with an augment), including Damage tokens. AIs also have no unfair advantages - they fight with the same knowledge as human players. Actually, the tokens are not as random as they might seem - everyone gets the same tokens and the same fuel, just in random order and random combination. We call this a Tetris deck (based on how probability works in that game).

Damage tokens were introduced to make battles finite, prevent resource ""farming"" in battles and, when used right, maximise overkill. But also they are a ""dirty"" way to end a battle - you get no overkill bonus that way. 

Finally, you said that the same song is played constantly throughout the game, but this is not the case. The game actually has a soundtrack of more than 50 tracks, and they were all professionally edited for inclusion in the game. (The title track intentionally doesn't loop, because of its live intro and outro, though it does remain on beat when restarting.)

Thanks,

Rob"
