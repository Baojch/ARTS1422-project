However, I just can't recommend it because of 2 things:

1) In game brightness is far too low with no way to increase it, and there are some sections where this can not be mitigated by the flashlight.

2) The loading times are absurdly long, to the point of experience ruining. Of the 40 minutes I played this game, possibly a quarter of it was spent on a loading screen. 

I'm sorry to leave a negative review for an obvious passion project by a clearly talented dev (these problems are likely the issue of the game engine rather than the dev themselves).

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This is a game guru game and as such includes all of the downsides of making a game in such a primitive game engine. This includes loading screens that crash rather frequently and take plenty of time to load (even on an SSD). And Lots of in game glitches (one glitch i noticed several times was where the game ""deep fried"" my screen). But despite these shortcomings, this may just be the best game guru game i have ever played (and that's taking into consideration i have played hundreds of them)

I recognize most of the enemys and objects in the game from other games i have played, this is a result of most of the items in the game being pre-made assets. Most of these assets are fairly old and i believe date back as far as FPS creator which was released in 2005. The age of these assets show as they do not look good in the least.  Assets on their own are fine if they are used well. And this game does make good use of them, but it still is not as good as producing your own assets.

The combat in this game isn't exactly what i would consider difficult, but at times it was challenging. The first chapter of the game was the hardest, this is due to the fact that the laboratory in which the game begins in is fairly small and the corridors are fairly narrow, this makes melee combat more difficult than it would be otherwise. But there are times i was able to abuse the AI and get an advantage by jumping onto objects when possible, For most enemys if you are even slightly elevated they are incapable of attacking you, but you can attack them. One way of dealing with this is put invisible walls around every object that you can jump on, but that doesn't sound like a good solution as invisible walls are very annoying.

The game isnt very scary despite it being a horror game, i think the dev used the mindset of ""darker is scarier"" when making the game, as even with the flashlight your vision is still extremely limited. The games music did make it somewhat chilling at times, i don't think the dev had any involvement in the production of the music, (EDIT: They did have involvement in the music production) but it is still one of the better parts of the game. 

Given that this is a game guru game it isn't very demanding for hardware, i was able to easily run this on my quad core I3 and 1050 ti

Overall this isn't a good game. But it has several aspects which make it miles better than most game guru games. The size of this game on its own is very impressive, it took me over 8 hours to finish. And i can tell this game had an insane amount of effort put into it. There are little details here and there that show the developer really put hard work into this game. And despite its short comings i enjoyed parts of it (some more than others). But i don't think its worth 4$. And i can not recommend this for most people. 

If the developer is reading this, i think you did the best you could with a limited engine. And if you were to remake this game in a better engine such as unity, i would gladly buy that. And i look forward to your future games.",1610051182,1613078548,False,8,1,0.649212777614593506,1,True,False,False,False,,1613070870.0,"Hi and thanks for looking at the game.

Yes the engine was not nearly as good as they wanted everyone to think and by the time I realized this I was already too far into the project to change it.

I put two years of my life in my money into this project so I think the fact that you got eight hours for a $4 game is more than reasonable.

it's not perfect and the engine had a lot of problems but all my work was solid and I'm very proud of it. Everything that I made worked well and then the engine had all of its problems which were hard-coded so I couldn't even touch those and though the developers of the engine promised and promised and promised all kinds of fixes they never came. would you believe that they're actually selling the same exact engine for a third time now with some slight upgrades?

The fact that you found enjoyment out of it and got a solid hours of gameplay is pretty good to me.

It's honestly asinine to me when people complain about not using original assets for games made by an indie developer especially as a one-man team. That is absolutely ridiculous. It makes no difference if Bob made them or if Eric made them. If they work in the game then they work. You said yourself I made good use of them so what difference does it make? I wanted to focus on the storyline and innovative mechanics and I tried my best to do so with the tools that I had at hand. Furthermore the engine is specifically designed to help first-time indie developers with their first FPS game so I think it's pretty reasonable.

If it wasn't for the loading times and the engine malfunctions that caused crashes and bugs then the game would have been really solid.

And yes I did have direct involvement making the music. The music assets are all original work."

Das man angesichts dieser Game Engine kein Meisterwerk erwarten kann, sollte wohl jedem klar sein. Im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen GameGuru-Gurken, welche Steam überschwemmt haben, gehört dieses Spiel aber zu den wohl besten seiner Art. Man merkt das der Entwickler hier nicht einfach per Drag & Drop schnell etwas zusammengeschustert hat, sondern sich hier wirklich bemüht hat ein anständiges Game auf die Beine zu stellen. Da ich selbst ab und an was mit GameGuru mache (nicht Kommerziell sondern nur zum Spaß), merke ich hier sofort das ""Corrosive Studios"" hier sehr viel mit eigenen Scripten gearbeitet hat, und er weit mehr Arbeit in sein Projekt gesteckt hat als die meisten Anderen.

Grafisch ist das Spiel eher sehr simpel, ja fast schon Comichaft gestaltet. Der Soundtrack ist recht ansprechend, wiederholt sich aber zu oft. Die Story ist recht interessant und wird teils in Videos und teils per Notizen erzählt. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist meiner Meinung nach etwas zu hoch angesetzt, da auch die Steuerung nicht die präzisiste ist. Hinzu kommen leider noch extrem lange Ladezeiten, welche auf eine sehr alte Engine-Version hindeuten. Dafür wurden aber die Levelabschnitte sehr klein gehalten um die Zeiten zu reduzieren. Trotzdem, selbst mit einer M.2 SSD Festplatte mußte ich hier zum Teil bis zu Zwei Minuten Ladezeiten hinnehmen.

Fazit: Für poppelige 3,29 Euro kann man bei dem Umfang des Spieles echt nicht meckern. Es hat mir auf jeden Fall Spaß gemacht. Deswegen eine Empfehlung für Ego Shooter Fans, welche nicht vor extrem langen Ladezeiten zurückschrecken.

PS: Falls die Grafik zu dunkel oder sehr schlecht aussieht, einfach mal das Steam Overlay für das Spiel deaktivieren. Es scheint da irgendwie Konflikte zu geben.",1594637134,1594644130,True,6,0,0.617058336734771729,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[list]
    [*]Wonky Graphics and jarring shadows especially in the rain.
    [*]Long load times even using an SSD coupled with maps you can get through in all of 5 minutes.
    [*]Enemies don't feel threatening and are more of a joke than anything.
    [*]Unclear mechanics, such as what objects in the world are interactable and in what way.
    [*]Questionable invisible walls, an area might be wide open but you're not walking there.
    [*]The enemy pathing in this game is the biggest wildcard.  Half the time they're walking into walls, and the other half they're climbing over fences.

Believe me, I won't be using the engine again. It was an under development engine and that's where 99% of the issues came from. Sure, sure, I could be just all like ""blame the engine for everything"" but it's true. The engine itself has potential but it's still very far off. All of the custom content I made and did was solid but unfortunately, the engine wasn't up to par with what I was trying to do. It is called gameguru and it's been under development for years by one guy and I thought I'd try it as it's a good first time fps creator engine. I know how to code and build stuff from the ground up but I wanted to try it out. Again, unfortunately, they had some of the biggest and most important stuff locked down so even with coding, I still couldn't touch it.

В этой игре есть парочка качественных уровней, которые действительно интересно проходить. К сожалению на первый такой качественный уровень ты попадаешь спустя полтора часа игры, затем 5 минут крутого геймплея, после возвращаемся назад к плохой игре, сделанной на коленке. Освещение не настроено, во многих участках уровня попросту отсутствует. Эффект ""Cell Shader"" здесь отвратительно выглядит , но это скорее из за отсутствия настроенного освещения (шейдер можно отключить в файлах игры). Такое чувство, словно задачей автора было просто выпустить игру в стиме. Он даже не пытался сделать качественно.

Элементарно отсутствует радар, навигация, отметки, чтобы игроку было проще ориентироваться в мире игры. Исследование начинает раздражать, когда ты уже целых 20 минут бегаешь по маленькой локации туда сюда и не понимаешь, что нужно делать (в итоге оказывается, что нужно было открыть незаметную дверь где-то в углу). Неужели автору было сложно в места взаимодействия с объектами добавить значки, картинки, иконки, хоть что то... чтобы игрок не заблудился. Зачем заставлять игрока страдать?

Я следил за этой игрой с первых дней открытия раннего доступа. Очень хотел поставить палец вверх за старания, но разработчик бросил незавершённую игру, поэтому отзыв исключительно отрицательный. Моя справедливая оценка 3/10 - это всё, что игра заслуживает в таком незаконченном состоянии.

P.S.
В комментариях разработчик очень часто винит движок GameGuru в проблемах игры. Частично это так. GameGuru не идеален.

The gameplay is pretty standard that you'd expect from an FPS, however the last time I played recoil was weird and impacts onto targets didn't appear to be noticeable at all, so it was hard to tell if you were destroying the targets that came across the screen. I'm also not a fan of the lighting, it is as if all maps have no real light sources or a lighting engine of any kind.

I'm marking this review positive because the developer, Corrosion, has always been able to work hard and do his best to create a product that ends up being way more fleshed out than initially published onto the Steam Store.

Story: While far from complete, the notes left around the game write a pretty morbid one. The horror elements are more in these than anything else. Granted, the horror in this is more about the evils within men than the horrors of the monsters. I would go into detail, but that would be major spoilers.

Soundtrack and sound effects: The soundtracks fit the theme of the game well, helping to build on the intended atmosphere, and the soundclips accomplish the goal there were meant to. May need some fine tuning, but they are not bad.

Graphics: Not bad considering the engine and it's state as an early Alpha. Some of the assets are custom, so a fair bit of work has gone into it. Which leads into the next category, which you will not likely find in most reviews.

Support: Corrosion does listen, and he does work with people to solve issues that arise. The recent update that fixed the redistributables, I helped him solve that. Took months, but that was months of narrowing down something that is easily overlooked. There is a team of testers working to make the experience the best for the players, and we are working to the best on our first FPS title. Speaking of the best efforts.

Gameplay: When it is not bugging, the gameplay is decent. Enemies have different defence and health values, and you can actually guage them with visual estimates. A normal zombie will be nowhere near as tough as an armored zombie, and an armored zombie with a helmet will take less headshot damage than one without. It is these little details that are often overlooked in many games that give this one a bit of charm. But now we get to the meat of any gameplay...

Bosses: As there is only one so far, let me just say this. Do NOT underestimate it. The game blatantly gives you a rocket launcer and two rockets just before the fight. If you headshot the beasty twice with them, you may take about half of his health off, the rest keep moving. The boss is easily the best part of this game so far. It does not let up, but telegraphs its moves, so if you get hit, it is solely your own fault, and you will be punished for your recklessness.

On the whole, a good early beta, even though we are still tecnically in the alpha stages. Yes, this game is an ALPHA.

So it's quite playable and hooks you in. 

The Dev has a good record with an earlier RPG maker game, Waste Walkers so you can expect a lot of improvements and updates and community involvement as time goes on.  Brave choice of game engine too.

+ It has a story. The storyline keeps you playing to see how it all unfolds.  It's the storyline that keeps you playing Affliction, and it takes the first couple of levels for it to start to unfold, but after that you want to play on to see where it's going.  

+ Frequent updates and improvements since release and involvement with the community

+ Video cut scenes mostly made in the game engine itself. A lot of work has gone into these for an indie dev.
 
+ The many levels, more like ""scenes"" suit story driven side of the game very well. 

+ For a game using the GG engine he's managed to keep a very good framerate going, mine's ranged from over 170fps  down to 50 fps on a 4 year old machine which isn't even entry level today (i7, 16gb ram, gtx 750 ti)

+ Very good use of sounds gives the game a great atmosphere.

+ cell-shaded is a nice look. It can be changed but I left it on.

+ you have to figure stuff out, it's not handed to you on a plate, and where there are hints they are mostly just that, hints.

- Loading times between levels are very long (due to the GG engine), but this is the current engine version, so that ought to be fixed while the game is still in early access. I do hope so because after a while you start being very careful not to die because the loading time is more than punishment enough for a mistake or forgetting to save.

The game is not yet complete, but given the dev's proven track record with Waste Walkers and that game's great reviews and feedback, this early access is going to turn out a real gem.  The developer does see through his projects until they are properly finished, and always puts a lot of work into them, no reason why this should turn out any different.  A lot of work and thought has gone into Affliction, the story, the cut scenes, wringing every last FPS out of the engine, voice acting, custom scripts, and it is only going to get better and more polished.",1510176959,1510177105,True,6,0,0.38950800895690918,0,True,False,True,False,,1510186707.0,"Thank you for checking out the game!

This is one of the better gameguru games, although it also has it's shortcomings.

Let me explain shortly, WHY I liked this game, and what I did NOT like that much:

+ Custom Main Menu and Music.

+ very nice Movement

+ great health system and a lot of Items to collect.

+ Some retexturing going on (hands and weapons)

+ Very much effort put into this, I can say this because the game has many levels and a lot of custom scripts and sounds.

+ I like the look (cell shading) and the sound design (footsteps & gunsound)


What I did not like that much:

- Sometimes poor Enemy AI (wich is mainly a gg problem)

- Little thrown together like level Design. Expecially in the 2nd part of the game
 ( Still, it's not terrible - I liked the first part of the game very much ) 

- sometimes unfair placed enemies 

- MANY loading screens 

- (at least for me= completely dark laboratory levels wich made them really hard to complete.

- overall lighting seems to be out of place sometimes.



Still, I like this game very much because of the effort that has been put in.
I appreciate this and I know how much time it takes to do a game like this.


Overall a cool gameguru-game with some nice Ideas and definitely some inspiring things for me.

Keep it up! Yours sincerly, DK Productions

Das Menü ist einfach gehalten und dann habe ich ohne das Tutorial das Spiel mal gestartet und kam direkt klar wie das Spiel gespielt wird.

Bei den Waffen ist Handlungsbedarf in der AIM Steuerung das beim Schuss besonders bei der Pistole der Schuss nach rechts verzieht. Aber wird noch vom Entwickler behoben und das man dann auch ein Fadenkreuz einschalten könnt.

Thankfully Steam no longer count ""paid for"" reviews (people who were given keys in exchange for positive reviews or who bought copys for $1 from bundlestars for greenlight upvotes) in their scores.

First off the store page is full of superlatives that the dev attributed to his game himself (haunting, frightening, intense, detailed, immersive) which in no way fit with the terrible experience the game itself provides. The only ""immersion"" you will get from this game is beleiving you are playing a free cover-cd game from the early 90's.

Secondly the dev can in no way whatsoever take any kind of criticism, instead preferring to blame the reviewer and tell blatant lies about them, while flooding them with derogitory comments which he then deletes minutes later.

The developer is using a game engine that's basically a fun way to learn Lua scripting and or create basic games for your kids, or simplistic 3D maps for your DnD sessions, it's certainly not, at least for the most part, intended to be used to create games you are going to charge money for, but that's been the way Steam has been going for a couple of years now so it's no suprise to see this in Early Access and asking for your cash. But, for now, let's ignore the engine used and look at the game itself:

There are 0 options for changing settings or rebinding controls, the control screen (and every other menu screen) is nothing but a blurred image with even blurrier text. The intro video is the same, just a bunch of super blurry images and text with ""old film"" overlays on top.

I played the first 5 levels or so, if you can call them that, they're so small that ""scene"" would probably be more accurate than level. Each one took longer to load than it did to comlpete, seriously. This is certainly not open world as the store page says.

The AI is laughable, it should honestly be renamed ALOI, if you cant work out what the LO stands for then maybe this game is right up your alley ;) . Often times you will walk around a corner to see the ai walking into a wall, all other times they'll just stand on the spot and shoot in your general direction, not posing any kind of challenge.

The crouch button only works properly on the first press on a level, only letting you stand back up if you jump and then only working if you hold the c button down afterwards, very sloppy.

All the in game sound effects and animations are terrible, clearly stock assets or out of cheap asset packs, just like every other asset in the game such as buildings, characters, vehicles etc etc. Some of these assets, such as the brick walls dont even have tile-able textures, so you get horrid seams down the middle of walls.
The overall quality of the assets, as well as the heavy limitations of the engine itself honestly make this game feel and look like a 3D game from the early 90's, except they tended to have decent size levels and fun gameplay.

The game then crashed when entering the police station level, which was level 5 or 6, after 12 minutes of gameplay, with about 60% of that being loading times between levels.

Yes, it is in Early Access, and at this point it can only improve (if you are at rock bottom then the only way is up), but this is also something most developers should/would be embarrased about asking money for, whether it's in EA or not, and I cant see that improving as long as GameGuru is the engine that's being used. And again, yes, I acknowledge it's in Early Access, but you can't polish a turd, no matter how much you buff it.

Definitely not worth your's or anyone else's money, and here's a tip, if Jim Sterling plays your game on his ""Spray and Play"" series (which he did with this) and you still cant see that what you have ""made"" is utter rubbish then you may be dillusional, seek medical attention!
Also in the 2 weeks since release the developer has only put in a maximum of 20 minutes dev time into the game, but according to him, this equates to ""a ton of changes and improvements, requested by the community"", what requests? what community? 2 lies in 1 there.....",1509041746,1510509599,False,31,3,0.563195705413818359,8,True,False,True,False,,1515709684.0,"https://media.giphy.com/media/srTYyZ1BjBtGU/giphy.gif

USER IS DELETING COMMENTS OF THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH HIM, HAS BEEN STALKING US ON STEAM FOR THREE YEARS.

You were one of the guys who has bandwagoned on since the very beginning and insists on bringing me down. Won't work. Keep it coming and bring it on. It's been what now? 3 years? And you're still at it. You had to troll and then I had to get rid of you and it became a big thing. Again, here we are.

Some things you said - I agree with. The scene system in fact. Gameguru has a lot of issues with large maps with fps and even longer load times so I decided to make the maps small and have a bunch of them to all form levels combined. Most of the maps load within 10-25 seconds but some have a load time of around 30 seconds.
Once you get further in the game (chapter 2) the maps start to get much larger. Probably 3-4 times the size of the first 5 or so. The crouch button thing I've never encountered or had anyone else mention. I can look into it but I don't think there is any issue there.

This is (as you know very well because you've harassed me since my first game) my first FPS and my third project. You gotta start somewhere and what better way to learn than with an engine a one man team can easily use? It might not be the best engine for my vision, sure. I'll give you that. But, it's not just plain crap either. A lot can be done with an imagination and a little hard work. Of course the game will continue to improve. I will do everthing in my power to make it as good as possible.

The ai used to be very difficult to fight and would kill you before you even knew what was happening but I changed it based on what my testers said. Slowed them down. Took their accuracy down, etc. 

The options for graphics and such are in the game menu in game. Controls cannot be remapped unfortunately, but I took the schemes from other games to match.

Load times are the biggest issue I'm trying to tackle. Of course, that is more of an engine issue than game issue but I am looking for what exactly causes this.

I couldn't post this as a comment since it was too long, so I'd like to post it here for the developer to view. It'll provide more insight on why I disliked the game:

Before I write anything else, I'd like to thank you for responding to my criticism and appearing to be open to it. I appreciate a person who is open to hearing another's opinion, especially in a case such as this, where it is a developer hearing from a consumer. It's a very rare thing, as most developers, especailly indie devs who are relatively new to releasing games, are quick to ignore or quash differing opinions regarding their games in favor of valuing their own thoughts or preconceived vision above all others. Since you've taken the time to outline your thoughts, out of respect, I'd like to respond to you in kind.

I think you're absolutely right on a few points. I certainly should have focused more on your game as a whole rather than the engine itself. I have a very bad track record with games made in this engine, and by bad I mean all duds and not a single passable game among them. To this day I've played about a dozen if not more games designed in GameGuru itself, and most of them are guilty of the sins I listed in the review above. However, I will give you credit in that I did notice that the characters were not from any of the asset packs that I have come across before. I commend you on taking that extra step and working on your own, since I feel that way too many people have become too comfortable (especially on steam) with buying and reusing the same standard, tired npcs and character models found on asset stores or that were packaged with the software itself.

I also think it's great that you're tackling neglected engines in order to challenge yourself. I genuinely believe that is a very interesting means of expanding your creative horizons and promoting your own growth as a game developer. Having graduated from RPG Maker, I can see that you're no stranger to adversity, and I can't help but find it a little amusing that you decided to try your hand at this particular engine, since it will no doubt lead you into familiar territory as far as reputation goes. 

Finally, after some thinking on the issue, I'd like to also agree, to a certain extent, about your views regarding Early Access. If I were to look at your game again and omit my feelings regarding the engine and other games associated with it, I'd say that I can see where you're coming from. Early Access is designated for games that want to take their audience along for the development cycle, and if what you say is true, and you intend on listening to user feedback and ironing out the quirks and bugs that may arise as a result, then you're using it the way it was intended, and I applaud you for that. Unfortunately, countless games have abused the EA system in halfhearted attempts at easy cash. So sometimes it's difficult not to judge a game, especially an indie one, based on that brading alone. In your case though, it does seem like you genuinely have an interest in improving your game, which is refreshing.

Now then, here's what I don't agree with. And I'll do my best to be constructive.

This is a little nitpicky, but I don't agree with you framing this game as an RPG. Absolutely no part of this game can fall into that category. Believe it or not, I bought this game (judging by the screenshots, tags, and your own description of the game), believing that I'd get an experience similar to a game I played awhile back called Brigand: Oaxaca. This is 100% a shooter. There are no other elements to this game other than shooting, unless you consider finding keys or moving a box RPG elements. It'd probably be best to remove the tag and reword your description a bit in order to frame it a bit better.

Your level structure is far too short. I realize that GameGuru is a difficult program to work with when it comes to realizing your vision for the game, since it's pretty limited, but when it takes me more time to load a level than to clear it, you have a problem. One of the areas took less than 10 seconds to clear before I reached the next loading screen, and I'm not exaggerating. Expanding your areas in order to provide more gameplay before having to wait to load the next would be a huge improvement. And just to be clear, I don't blame you for the loading times. That's all GameGuru's fault. EVERY game I've played that uses the engine, no matter how small, takes the same amount of time to load each new area.

I did not approach this game with a predetermined, bitter mindset. Quite the contrary. I wasn't expecting anything stellar, but I was expecting something slightly entertaining and possibly funny. Since 2015 I've made a kind of ritual of streaming what I deem bad or unknown games on Twitch. As of today, I've played well over 400 bad games alone, and I'm very good at sniffing ones out that fall into one of these categories. Every once in awhile I find a hidden gem that actually turns out to be an enjoyable experience, either because of how hilarious it is, or because it's legitimately fun. Your game falls into the bad category. The story and environments are bland and forgettable. The enemies are dull and do not pose a threat unless you run directly into them (this again is the engine's fault, not yours). Nothing that transpires draws me in or begs me to invest myself in theworld or what's going on despite what you claim in your description of the game. So, while I agree with you that my ranting about the engine should have been left out of the review, my opinions regarding your game were determined by nothing other than the game itself.

You and I are similar. We both love video games. We both are passionate in different ways about video games. I wasn't expecting a AAA title. I wasn't expecting something that would blow me away. I was just expecting an enjoyable experience, nothing more than what you claimed you would offer. And this wasn't enjoyable.

So, I'd like to ask you something. If you were to remove yourself from the mindset of a developer, and if you were to play this game as a consumer, could you call this game, as it is now, enjoyable?

Thank you for your time, and for taking the time to respond. I really appreciate it.

****Here' is the review****


I usually go about my reviews in a joking manner because I enjoy not taking games too seriously.

I will not be doing that here. This game is a complete piece of garbage. Let me warn ANYONE and EVERYONE to stay away from anything made in GameGuru. 80% of the time, it's a flip of a map already made in the game. 19% of the time, the map is made from scratch and littered with assets that make not a lick of sense (because the dev either doesn't want to make his own npcs/skins, etc or he wants to get his money's worth because he bought assets). 99% of the time it's a horrible disappointment and a waste of your time and money. This software should be a stepping stone for people with an interest in game development. They should move on from it once they understand some basics and explore other more demanding software. GAMES SHOULD NOT BE MADE IN THIS. It's beyond amateur and it makes you look bad as a developer.

The levels in this game take 10-30 seconds to beat before loading the next one. There are also game breaking bugs within levels that, once a save file containing them is loaded, will prevent you from continuing and you will have to start from the beginning (you don't want to do that. Read a book, study the bible, teach your son how to throw a right hook, deworm your dog, cook a fancy meal for you family even if you dislike them, discuss rick and morty with people of a lower intelligence and explain why you need a high iq to truly appreciate it, create a facebook and catfish indian men, etc. All of these options are more productive, and will cost you less, than the money and effort it will take you to try and enjoy this game).

This stinks. 1/10",1508979648,1509005856,False,116,16,0.75050586462020874,67,True,False,True,False,,1509003000.0,"Thanks for giving the game a quick look. Let me start by reminding you that this is Early Access and a work in progress. This is my first FPS game and I have a lot of plans for it.

Your review is based on a general ""all gameguru games do this"" and doesn't really focus on Affliction. What assets don't make sense? What maps are just littered with assets? Seems like you may be taking this specific game a bit too seriously, completely contradicting yourself from the first line.

As I am still learning (in college) and this is kind of a stepping stone game for me, it's bound to not be perfect, but it's very cheap and fairly decent for what you pay. I have warnings all over the store page and all over the community hub. There isn't any reason to be ugly about the game's current state as no one is forcing you to buying it or playing it. You obviously didn't play long enough to have to keep it so you can safely get your money back. But hey, I'm the developer. Why should you listen to me? I'm biased.

I did make many of the characters you'll see in the game myself. All the human enemies and some of the monsters but yes, as I have said before, many assets were purchased or made by the community.

Just because an engine has a certain track record, doesn't speak for the engine itself, that is the individual developer. Any engine can breed a bad game if the developer makes it bad. RPG maker has many of those, but also some good ones.

If you have some constructive criticism, I'd love to hear it. Seriously, I would. This is my third project. My other two did very well despite being on a heavily hated engine and this is my new goal, to do the same here. I love video games, I love making them, and I love making them so as many people as possible can enjoy them. I like using engines that are somewhat neglected both because I am still learning and they are usable by a one man team and so more people can experience them. Sure, I can't do super amazing graphics or effects like AAA companies, but I'm not trying to. I'm making games for people to enjoy that have some good gameplay and are enjoyable.

I appreciate you checking out the game... and your concern about warning everyone away from it. 

No one seems to understand what early access actually means or what a work in progress is. I know the game has issues right now, and I know that is has problems that are somewhat of a pain but I plan to do everything I can to solve them and deliver an enjoyable gameplay experience. 

Instead of coming straight here and instantly condemning the entire project, you might have thought to have gone to the forums that I have organized for player ease and reported the issues you experienced so I can fix them and make a better game. Could it be this was an already predetermined review of the game?

Thanks."
