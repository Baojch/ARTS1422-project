I LOVED Gemini Rue and got into this one because I was genuinely intrigued. I sadly cannot recommend it, at all. My last straw was the  [spoiler] monocle screen puzzle, got it up to that Redlien prompt, [/spoiler] but hit a brick wall after that. I was determined to brute force it but it ended up feeling like a waste of time. Other puzzles that I ended up figuring out were also leaving a lackluster feeling, like there was no reason to make it work that specific way other than making it convoluted for the sake of it. TLDR I didn't feel proud i just felt frustrated after finishing half of the puzzles [/spoiler] (like the subway door and the ""sticky"" bomb.) [/spoiler]. Overall the experience got less and less fun with each step.

[spoiler]  After throwing the towel I consulted a guide and found out the word I was missing was ART, somehow that had to be deduced from the  result for ""Redlien"", because it was a poem and a poem is ART... Not gonna lie this royaly pissed me off, how is ART a valid prompt where before all others were capitalized and also all prompts had a very direct or clearly implied connection to what was displayed on screen. I could have kept going after reading the guide but felt cheated [/spoiler]

Besides that, general navigation felt frustrating, something that did not happen with Gemini Rue. Having to  pixel hunt the exit for a room is not what I'd call compelling design. There were also issues with a logics puzzle that I endlessly had to repeat to write down all the information needed to progress, with no option to streamline the whole process. It wasn't a bad puzzle per se, but the execution ended up being annoying and  after figuring it out I was left feeling frustrated instead of proud.

Edit for developer: I think you missed the point of the review, I love more complex point & click games, I've been playing point and click adventure games my whole life but this is the first time -even after reading a guide- the solution seemed forced or even pretentious. And again, mechanically, the game could've used a lot more polish on the UX side.

- The limited set of interactions and non-punishment for experimenting. Sometimes even your bad ideas bring unexpected surprises with little dialogue treats.
- The pacing and changing focus of the player's story, leaving a lot to the imagination for most of the time.

Pros:
+ Decent puzzles with a good variety. Most on the easy side
+ Interesting scifi setting
+ Decent story
+ Good voiceover work
+ Multiple endings

Cons:
- Unfortunately, this game falls into the all-too-familiar adventure game trap of ""hunt the pixel"". Multiple puzzles require you to notice and click on a tiny clickable area in order to advance, none of which are ever hinted at or called out by the characters. This is made even worse by the samey color palette meaning noticing these one-pixel-wide areas is extremely difficult.
- Brown/gray color palette + lack of any stunning vista-type locations means the scifi setting is wasted a little bit. There's no area in the game that looks particularly impressive or makes you say ""wow""
- Story, while decent, is incredibly predictable. If you've experienced any type of scifi at all you already have figured out the entire backstory of the game within the first five minutes. This leaves the game without any real twist, which is unfortunate as the game builds it up as if one is coming but it never does
- On the short side, even for an adventure game
- Nitpicky (spoilers)- there's one puzzle that requires you to click on a specific part of the screen that does not even contain a textual indicator that its different from any other part of the scene. I'm talking about finding the battery in the junkyard. Despite almost the whole scene being described as ""junk"" without any additional description dialogue, you're supposed to someone intuit this one specific spot will work with your energy locator despite the lack of any textual or audio indicator that it would. This is even more egregious given that all prior junkyard items have specific descriptive text for their locations. I'd go so far as to call this a bug that should be fixed.",1705452966,1705452966,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,1705455361,"Thanks for your thoughtful review!

On the specific junkpile puzzle you mention, though, I think your critique is slightly off.

Starting as one of those robots named Horatio your power core is stolen which is what kicks off the game, your primary objective being to retrieve it. An intricate point-and-click adventure game follows with a compelling story and unique, engaging puzzles. While Primordia does feature the standard point-and-click puzzles(combining things in inventory, interacting with objects, using inventory items on outside things) there‚Äôs a logic to each that makes sense. The actions taken aren‚Äôt out of left field and are things someone might reasonably think of. While it is sometimes a bit obtuse in how exactly it has to go and the proper order, compared to similar games in the genre it is quite intuitive, largely avoiding the most unnecessary parts, In subsequent playthroughs you might forget a step or two, and try something but that is a result of you knowing already, a first playthrough won‚Äôt have this problem. The game features some minor choice dialogue though much of the story remains the same until the endings, these choices can affect achievements or how certain robots treat/help you.

Dealing with heavy themes, the game is interested in religion and creation and how these ideas are allowed to exist in society. Man is a stand-in here for god and is directly called god by some characters this layer of abstraction grounds the game in the real world and keeps it distinct enough to not be bogged down too much, it is respectful of each party as well. Aside from creation, the game delves into destruction, how did man die exactly is a question that the game presents. Collective vs individual need is also a theme and each side isn‚Äôt exactly going about things in the best way, the proper answer to this is ambiguous and you might have your take on it based on the endings, I‚Äôm not sure which is correct or if I did the correct thing.

This is all helped by some great writing, characters are real people with their ideals and motives, not always willing to help out especially if you can‚Äôt prove yourself. The game while heavy also has some nice comedy added in, especially from the sarcastic side-kick Crispin who is a great contrast to the more serious Horatio. Later characters can feel equally serious or comedic and in some instances perhaps not all there. A particularly interesting character speaks only in rhymes, and not always great rhymes.

Taking place in a sort of post-apocalypse and post-man world the world is quite ugly, largely brown and rust as the world is filthy and lived in, despite having pixel graphics the art style conveys this very well, most of the robots appear rugged and like their made from lose scarp and parts as opposed to the more sleek looks that are often seen with robots. Some interactable items allow you to look closely at them, giving a close-up picture for more added detail which further adds to this aesthetic.

Unfortunately, the soundtrack is rather simple and largely lacking, mainly featuring the same theme repeated it adds nothing to the world and is mostly forgettable.

It is not often that a game makes me think about my actions and if what I‚Äôm doing is correct, there is often an obvious good or evil answer but here there is seemingly none, and that adds a great deal to its story. I‚Äôll be thinking about it for some time.

Update after Dev's answer:

After Mark's (the developer) response to this linguistic rampage above, I felt ashamed of my short review. 

Primordia is a masterpiece of independent development, creative spirit and beauty. Beauty in every screen, character, and dialog. I can't believe I was able to once again get emotions similar to the dynamic between Nameless One and Morte. 

Primordia is one of those ""made for you personally"" games. A few people can make art that stays with you forever. I'd like to separately mention the incredible soundtrack - I've been listening to it since 2012, from time to time.

I've only just gotten through the game - I was hampered by OCD, because the default settings had an ugly filter and the game didn't look the way I wanted it to on the screen. But this is purely an engine problem. I didn't like any of the settings. 

But the most current version looks different by default - I'm happy to have enjoyed this game, after 12 years of wanting to do so.

I will definitely go through the rest of this team's games.

Unfortunately, the art style was a major hindrance to enjoying the game as well. Trying to figure out what I was looking at at any given time was a bit headache inducing.

The UI was fiddly, and some of the game's mechanics were very obscure. I didn't find the puzzles particularly satisfying, either - many were quite simple, and the ones that weren't were a bit too abstract for my taste.

On top of that, the plot didn't grab me even after getting all the endings. Also, I have a low tolerance for certain tropes from 1970-90s sci-fi, and this game was full of them.

Condition: Doomsday

The world ended decades ago. There seem to be no organic beings left, and even the great machines of the Primordium, the fabled golden age of creation and the reign of Man the All-Builder, are falling into rust and ruin. Our hero is Horatio Nullbuilt, v.5, a robot who has set before himself a rather ambitious task: to restore the world, no more, no less - starting with a majestic airship, the UNNIIC (pronounced ‚Äúunique‚Äù ‚Äì who needs proper spelling?) lying in the wasteland for as long as anyone remembers. And then an unexpected turn of events sends him and his friend Crispin to chase a formidable enemy across the desolation and even farther away.

The game is simply perfect. The writing has a precise rhythm, a perfect cadence brought to life by celebrated voice actors. The setting is fantastical but internally consistent, which is crucial for puzzle solving. It features high-tech tools that work on more-or-less scientific principles, so the puzzles are refreshing in their originality. For once, you will have a plasma torch and a scintillation counter instead of the usual pair of wrench and screwdriver.

Hand-painted backgrounds in the baroque railgun-gothic style highlight the stark beauty of the post-apocalyptic world, and it‚Äôs simply amazing how evocative and sympathetic pixellized characters can be. Not only they crack tech jokes and color their speech with peculiar jargon; they behave like *robots*, not humans in metal suits. Figuring out a robot‚Äôs logic, the goals and constraints of its Artificial Intelligence is just as important as keeping your plasma torch close at hand.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not our property or our problem.‚Äù

This quote is emblematic of the puzzles, and, indeed, the plot structure of the game. Primordia treats its characters and you, the player, with respect: you won't be doing nonsensical things or picking up random items. It is a game that rewards intelligence, creativity and logic, not lucky guessing and a mastery of web search.

And if you‚Äôre stuck, you can ask Crispin for a hint. The game does not penalize this ‚Äì why should you be discouraged from asking a friend for help? The hint system is precise and elegant; and you‚Äôll be delighted by insightful, funny and heartwarming exchanges between characters. (And, of course, the hints contain no spoilers that could have ruined the game‚Äôs intricate mysteries.)


‚ÄúOne more setting‚Ä¶‚Äù

By adjusting the graphics settings, you can make Primordia look awesome on a screen of any resolution, without stretching and artifacts. The engine supports letterboxing (5:4), pillarboxing (16:9), windowboxing with integer scaling (any) and, of course, total immersion fullscreen (16:10). It is also playable in a window if you so desire.

Primordia does not use unstable external plugins; all special effects are custom-coded by the talented developers at Wormwood Studios, so if you are able to run AGS games on your computer at all, you will be able to play this game.


‚ÄúWe are Man‚Äôs miracle, Crispin. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

The central mystery is *fair*; you can figure it out early (not ""guess because you have seen/read/played something similar - it's rather unique), in which case the mystery becomes dreaded anticipation, and the plot *works*: if anything, the little ""I see what you did there"" details enhance the experience even further.

There's a widespread notion that a person must read/watch/otherwise experience specific artworks before he or she dies. And that notion is plain wrong. The time one spends *not having experienced* a great work of art is the time they have wasted. Buy this game now.

Primordia has devious enemies, unexpected allies, and indifferent mechanical gods. It‚Äôs a game about what it takes to pull civilization from the brink, and what it takes to make you want to push it down. It‚Äôs a game about truth and hope, law and duty, justice and vengeance. It‚Äôs a game about what it means to be human. (Who‚Äôd have thought you need robots for that?)

Search an area top to bottom, interact with every conceivable thing.  Leave area.  Find out you need a Thing.  This Thing (which had been there the whole time) can now be found by re-searching in the previously empty rubble if you happen to go back to that area and search that bit of rubble again.  Where was it the first time?  In another dimension, apparently.

If you don‚Äôt mind puzzles like the above, you can find something to enjoy.  For me, they sapped the fun I had been having.

Edit:
Response to the developer: You're reading something into the review that isn't there; this is the opposite of metagaming.   What I described is being frustrated that what I'm looking for is in an area I already thoroughly searched.  And it's actually a pretty easy problem to avoid from a development perspective.  If there's something that I'll need later, don't make it nonexistant until I need it; either let me pick up a currently-useless thing like the hoarder I am, or lock it away in a box I need a key or tool to open and have the character comment as such (or the lazier but serviceable last resort, the character can say something like, ""I'll check back on this later"", etc.).  I'm not huge into point & click adventure games but I've played others (including one also published by Wadjet Eye Games, Technobabylon) where I didn't run into this issue, so it's certainly not inherent to the genre.  In any case, don't take it too personally; a guy on the internet was disappointed by something you made, but many more people had a great time with it.

What you describe is an interesting pickle in adventure game design.  I'm not actually sure what puzzle you're describing in Primordia (maybe the fallback way of proving your righteousness to Ever-Faithful Leobuilt?), because I'm hard pressed to think of where that happens.  But it is fair to say that there are instances where -- particularly if the player is using a walkthrough or is clever enough to use adventure-game metaknowledge -- the player might want to do X before it makes any sense for the *character* to do X, and thus the game won't let the character do X.  Since the player imputes his metaknowledge to the character, it feels totally arbitrary.  (This comes up a lot with the 187th Legionbuilt puzzle regarding the Refuge Law.)  If you let the player get ahead of the character, it can present its own set of problems, so careful design is necessary to navigate both hazards.  I certainly tried my best to strike the right route in designing Primordia, but every so often it seems not to have worked for a particular player.

So, really, all I can say is sorry that your experience wasn't better! It's possible that Strangeland (our sophomore game) would be more to your liking, but who knows?"

It is amazing how many players that tripped up... we just assumed everyone knew those controls from back in the 90s.  When the issue was first reported, we added the How to Play section to the options menu and put controls on the first page.  But players still got tripped up, so we added a timer (I think 10 minutes) and if you haven't used right click when it expires, it gives you a pop up message telling you about right click to examine.  But I think a lot of players still miss it (like you did).  We learned our lesson and gave an explicit, unskippable controls tutorial in Strangeland. :)

-the pixel hunting is not egregious here, but a button to highlight all hotspots could be a nice accessibility feature

Game length is about 4ish hours if you are moving quickly, but there is tons of fully voice acted optional dialogue which fleshes out the world, its characters and your playtime.

Seamlessly merging humor, awe-inspiring storytelling, and thought-provoking themes, it stands as a testament to the heights that interactive storytelling can achieve.

For those of us who hold a special place in our hearts for the pixelated adventures of the 90s, Primordia serves as both a nostalgic throwback and a testament to the enduring quality of classic game design. It's heartwarming to see that the spirit of those beloved, retro games has been channeled into crafting a modern experience that retains the charm and creativity of its predecessors.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Primordia is its intricate narrative. The game masterfully weaves together humor, drama, and philosophical exploration, prompting players to ponder profound questions while navigating a world of wit and wonder. This seamless blend of emotions and intellectual engagement is a rare gem in the gaming world.

Even for those who might be new to the world of point-and-click adventures, Primordia stands as a shining example of what the genre can offer. Its user-friendly mechanics and intuitive puzzles make it accessible to all, while its rich storyline and captivating characters ensure that players of all backgrounds can immerse themselves fully in the experience.

In my gaming journey, Primordia has rekindled my passion for classic adventures while introducing me to a world that feels both familiar and refreshingly new. The attention to detail, the clever puzzles, and the beautifully crafted environments all come together to create an experience that is undeniably enchanting. It's more than just a game; it's an odyssey through imagination.

To all those seeking a gaming experience that seamlessly bridges the gap between nostalgia and innovation, I wholeheartedly recommend Primordia.

[u]Primordia[/u] is an Adventure Game with 2D animation and a very low pixel count. This is very similar to Monkey Island or other SCUMM based games. You click on the environment, pick up items, and use them on different items to solve puzzles. Very standard fare.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[u]Primordia[/u] is shorter than most adventure games. A lot shorter. As in there are 2 major zones you go to through the entire game. This is the equivalent of 2 Monkey Island chapters. Fortunately the quality of those zones is good, and not many of the puzzles are terribly unfair. I wouldn‚Äôt say any are especially clever but they at least give you that smug satisfaction when you figure out what to do. The weakest puzzles are the ones that use the game‚Äôs future tech. Just what exactly is a ‚ÄúSignal transducer‚Äù? These unintuitive little gadgets make solving some portions more difficult than they should be.
If you do get stuck, your traveling partner can be questioned for hints. Although the hints are less ""What is my general objective?"" than outright spoilers. some games will just put a walkthrough into the game's UI,  but here it‚Äôs built into the story. I have mixed feelings about this. First, it‚Äôs easy to accidentally click on your partner and have him spoil a solution. Second, when your sidekick knows how to solve all the puzzles, it detracts from the story some what. Gameplay is fine, but nothing we haven‚Äôt seen before.

[h1]Story[/h1]
From the screenshots you can tell something special is going on in [u]Primordia[/u]. The sprite based artwork is probably its most striking feature. A weird mixture between Dune and Geiger, the alien designs of the space machines and spaceports are a visual treat. The main story starts off with the simplest of premises: Someone took your ship battery and you gotta go find it. The game is best when it sticks to this simple whodunnit mystery. But this is a short game. It really can‚Äôt be spending time fleshing out a huge lore driven narrative about the Fall of Man, the Rise of the Machines, and the internal political machinations of the robot overlords that eventually turned robo-society into an autocracy. This is all a bit much to cram into so little game. There are too many major characters for a story that is better serviced by something lighter and tighter. They do the best they can with the time given, it‚Äôs just a bit more than what a game of this size should be trying to do.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
In almost every facet but one, the game is perfect. The low pixel art VGA graphics may be off putting initially, but stick with it and you will see some wonderful landscapes, ship designs, and of course, robots. The sprites are just marvelous, and there are many equally great animations. Sound design is also good. Laser guns, ship doors opening and closing, engines, etc. all work well. And the voice acting is all on par. The range of different personalities you meet ‚Äî especially given everyone‚Äôs a robot ‚Äî is surprisingly varied.
But we still have to talk about Crispin, your sidekick. Now, I‚Äôm sure some people love this little guy but right from minute one his role as the comedic relief was just not working for me. Maybe it‚Äôs his poor voice acting or bad lines, but this integral character is just grating every time he opens his mouth. I can best describe him as the Jar Jar Binks of the Primordia Universe. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[u]Primordia[/u] is a pretty, fun, tight little title. It‚Äôs not especially long, but it looks great and is satisfying enough to finish. Intermediate to advanced adventure gamers should give it a try,",1684728489,1684789598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,1684764068,So glad you liked it!

Primordia is an adventure game and, as such, you're not really here for the gameplay. The puzzles can be hit or miss, generally being logical and consistent, but sometimes falling into that ""rub every two thing on my inventory and the screen to try and make progress"". I found it a lot less obtuse than other adventure games I played, but this still happens a couple of times. However, the game is very generous with it's tips (talk to Crispin!) so it doesn't hurt as much.

What IS good in Primordia is the setting. It is fantastic. It presents a cyberpunk, post-human, dystopia wherein machines struggle to get by and find purpose. Interestingly, Humans are worshiped as gods, the first Builders, and the main characters, Horatio Nullbuilt, Version 5, is a follower of this religion. Through the game you explore the junkyards and leftovers of old humanity and old wars, and eventually reach a sprawling city where you can get closer to robot society.

Really, the setting is awesome, and the twists are satisfying (if a bit predictable).  This is a heavy recommend for anyone looking for a quick sci-fi fix.",1682986732,1682986732,True,3,0,0.530097067356109619,0,True,False,False,True,,1683037152,"Thank you so much!

I actually played this one a long time ago back before it even had achievements and I wasn't too hot on it then, but it definitely helps having played not only more adventure games in general but specifically those that influenced this one. Cause honestly, in a lot of ways, this feels like a fan remake of Beneath a Steel Sky. It has a similar premise of a post-apocalyptic world where one man from the wasteland has to go to one of the last known hubs of civilization, which happens to be a massive metropolitan city that was previously at war with other cities and is divided into multiple levels of height based on function, and must deal with the computer that has taken over the place while uncovering details he never knew about his past, collaborating with a robot buddy that he built and a female dissenter. Thankfully, this game is a massive improvement on Steel Sky in just about every way.

Primordia is the story of Horatio Nullbuit, a robot who is holing up in and trying to fix an airship called the Uniic, when one day a mysterious robot cuts right through the hull of his airship and steals his power core. Unfortunately, he only has an emergency generator that won't last long, so he needs to find out where the robot went and recover the power source or he, and his robot buddy Crispin will die. One thing I really appreciate about this over both of the Steel Sky games is that you spend an almost equal amount of time in the Dunes searching for an alternate power source before going to Metropol. In Steel Sky, you only saw the wasteland in the opening cutscene, and in Beyond a Steel Sky, the first hour of the technically took place in the wasteland but it was right outside Union City and most of the context was still centered around getting into the city. Here in Primordia, you get to travel to various different locations, meet some people, and get context on the world and the war that came close to ending it, setting up some things about Horatio's past that pay off later. There's more intrigue which the second half of the game builds upon rather than the plot slipping into the background till the very end like in Steel Sky.

The background art in this game is superb, some of the best I've ever seen in an adventure game in fact. Some might complain about the overly brown tone of the game, but the level of detail and the variety of environments you move through more than makes up for it. The color tone of the game actually does really help with the desolate atmosphere of the apocalyptic world where everyone is holding on by a thread. Similarly, the character designs are excellently done which you can see right from the cover of the game as a lovingly rendered image of Horatio is what they're selling the game with. All of the other robots in the game are also excellent, some looking stylized and curvaceous like something out of 50s sci-fi art and others looking very blocky and 80s industrial. 

The puzzle design in this game actually isn't bad. The only reason I had so much trouble the first time is because I didn't think to examine things and I didn't ask Crispin for help enough, as he does offer up specific advice or clues whenever you're stuck. The only time I had trouble figuring something out was the Memorious puzzle as I believe the hints for figuring out the third phrase are too vague and can be interpreted in the wrong way too easily. Everything else has a fairly logical correlation for at least one of the solutions. Yes,there are multiple puzzle solutions you can do for achievements. You can even attempt to break into the final area yourself if you can figure out the code without the codebreaking robot which the game nudges you into several times. The final puzzle is especially great as there are a whole bunch of options on what you can do for alternate endings.

Primordia may not have some of the polish that later games in Wadjet Eye's catalogue do, but it is a really solid effort. It has an interesting story with some decent puzzles and the game helps you out with the most of the more obtuse things you need to do. I would recommend this to all adventure game fans, though I think the older ones will get more of a kick out of it to be honest. I'm really eager to play the spiritual successor that Wormwood made in Strangeland after replaying this.",1681666583,1681676711,True,1,0,0,6,True,False,False,True,,1681675320,"Thank you so much for the kind and thoughtful assessment.

Maybe I posted one after a million hours on my GOG copy and mixed them up, I don't know. Well, whatever! Primordia is easily one of my top favorite games of all time, and probably one of my most replayed; it's like picking up an old comfortable favorite book or putting on a movie I've watched a hundred times at this point, popping back in to spend a casual weekend in the robot apocalypse hanging out with some wacky well-acted old friends again.

And it's a game that genuinely rewards multiple playthroughs - not just with the commentary track, which should absolutely not be enabled in your first run as it's full of spoilers, but because there is a really delightful amount of side dialogue via RNG banters and environmental/item/Crispin interactions. You're definitely not going to encounter all of that in only one run, and I love the feel of getting to know the characters and their relationships a little better every time I've come back. Similarly, there's a lot of foreshadowing and background stuff that's easily missed in a first playthrough, and I've enjoyed the characters' arcs (which aren't, Horatio slightly excepted, completely/directly spelled out for the audience as some games' dialogue tends to do) more every time I revisit them and catch something new, or put something together I didn't before. *And* some endings are incompatible with one another, though once you know when to make a backup save - I'm not spoiling! - it's fairly painless to see everything in a single replay. So while Primordia itself is technically not the longest game, you can get a lot of hours out of it if you like what it's offering!

Anything more I could say in praise of the art, music, acting, dialogue, gameplay, and the humorous but effective in-game hint system has probably been said thousands of times already and this is already running long, so I'll just say I love it and add: big thank you to the devs and cast for this one. Primordia's one of those stories that's meant a lot to me over the years, and I have a lot of affection for its characters and their struggles.

I think my favorite aspects of this game are both the intentionally-vague background lore that the player can try to piece together with their own interpretations and the phenomenal dialogue that really makes the world feel lived in and makes the player want to learn everything they can about the characters and their pasts.

Additionally, I thought the puzzles were awesome in this one overall - some were decently tough while still remaining at least somewhat intuitive - not an easy feat to pull off in this genre!

This is the type of game that really makes you think about tough, philosophical concepts that are more relevant than ever in the real world. The writer does a great job of making a solid argument for opposing philosophical solutions presented by the different characters.

I would definitely recommend this game to all other history/philosophy nerds out there who enjoy top-notch writing, incredible atmosphere, and uncovering lore via detective work and puzzle solving.

The writing was very well done, and while the puzzles were a mix of extremely satisfying and occasionally head-scratching, the worldbuilding and memorable characters more than made up for its shortcomings. 

I did appreciate being able to 'incorrectly' solve certain puzzle chains, and that the game tries to tell you that you've done something wrong. One such instance led to me reloading an earlier save and doing the whole sequence again, which ended up being an *extremely* good decision. 

If the game had one major flaw, it would be that its climax felt a little rushed and underwhelming [spoiler] (the underground section in particular, it felt a little strange to have control taken away from your character in such a pivotal moment, and it was too short for the return afterwards to feel meaningful) [/spoiler] but other than that, the story was very good and the underlying mystery kept me invested the whole time.

Also, bonus points for including a character that talks only in rhyme. I don't know why, but something about that trope gets me every time.

I love the world and the atmosphere, but the story and the climactic moments didn't do much for me. The build-up to the end of the game didn't feel as impactful as I was hoping, but the journey there was a fun experience nonetheless. I loved the dialogue and the worldbuilding. It ranges from funny and charming to bleak and existential and it rarely fell flat. And the voice acting is really well done for what I assume is a low budget game.

The puzzles for the most part were fair and satisfying. But one puzzle in particular was way too obscure--I never could have figured out the answer on my own. What's more, I recommend clicking the ""How to Play"" button in the menu when you start because I never realized you could right-click on the environments to examine things, and it turns out that a certain puzzle requires you to examine something in order to proceed. Took me a while to get past that hurdle. But besides those hiccups, the rest of the puzzles were great.

The setting, the low-res but very atmospheric visuals, the haunting music and then the excellent writing and no less excellent voice acting drew me in for the opening act like few other games ever did.
While the first act in the wasteland was almost perfect, the second one in the city was less so. There were two things that didn't work that well:
- The game wanted to tell too much backstory compared to the gameplay. This resulted in text dumps, more of them as we approached the end of the game. They were interesting, I would have liked to read them as a novel - but this is a video game, not a novel.
- Several puzzles were opaque to the point of WTF-ness. I may have enjoyed them in the 90s, but now I simply couldn't find the patience to tinker with them all. May be the game's fault, may be mine, hard to tell.

Gameplay wise it is a point and click adventure/puzzle game from 2012, but it hold up well. The problems are easy enough to solve once you have all the pieces, but I personally struggled to find some of them. 

The main standouts if the game are its writing and world building. This is a game about a world where man is gone and all that is left is the robots and machines we made. They share many of the same ideals and flaws that plagued man, and that is what makes it hit home so well. You follow Horatio and his sidekick Crispin on their journey to get back a power source that was stolen from them. Along the way they wrestle with the woes of ideology, religion, and what it means to exist all while learning about what brought this world to what it is now. On top of that, the dust and rust builds a great atmosphere throughout this story. As for my favorite character, it is a toss up between Clarity and Primer.

While it is indeed a tough challenge to objectively quantify how popular an artwork actually is, I feel safe assigning Primordia a recognition level of [i]not nearly enough[/i]

Primordia is engrossing, endearing and entertaining. It starts with a short introductory cutscene where the two main characters are introduced - the deadpan, stoic protagonist Horatio and his charming comic-relief sidekick Crispin. They live a reclusive, quiet life, until a hostile machine invades their home and steals the power core - retrieval of which remains the guiding objective throughout the entire game. Forced to leave their secluded desert shelter, they soon find themselves in the city of Metropol, delving deeper and deeper into the history and intrigues that shaped the dystopia they reluctantly explore.

The relationship between the two is with no doubt one of the game's strongest selling points. On one side, it's a reliable, instantly recognisable goofy-guy-deadpan-guy pairing, functioning especially well here as a contrast to the grim reality. Ever since the Wasteland game, moments of comic relief accompany bleak postapocalyptic landscapes to prevent the atmosphere becoming too oppressive to enjoy. On the other side, Horacio is by all means and purposes a father of Crispin, having built him according to his own design. While not shying away from challenging his ideas, Crispin lets his mask of tease slide down sometimes, revealing a deep affection and respect to Horacio, his father figure. [spoiler]One of the funniest and most heartfelt moments when this aspect of the relationship comes to the light is an optional puzzle where Horacio helps Crispin get over his timidness and speak to another robot he likes.[/spoiler] It's an interesting twist on the formula by itself, expanded on by the tension arising from the fact that Horacio had the opportunity to shape Crispin in whatever way he desired. Was creating a companion that questions him a purposeful act, or did he leave in the design a space of freedom for Crispin to develop a personality on his own? I feel this fragment from the short story on the game's official site is the best way to sum up this train of thought - [i]Horatio pre-loaded a lot of data when he built me.  For example, all these words, our core logic, how to field-strip a screw (is that right?) and tie seventeen kinds of knots.  You would think he would have filled us up with this nonsense in his Gospel. But, no. ""You can always ask, Crispin.""[/i]

The internal struggle between the predestined identity devised by one's creator and the freedom of continuous development is probably the main theme shaping the narrative of the game, along with its extension in form of characters whose purposes are either fulfilled or no longer valid, forcing them to find new guiding principles and values. The writers did not stop there however, delving into questions concerning the nature of law along with the problem of unjust law, problematic nature of established knowledge [i](understood in this case as a collection of facts about the world)[/i] and its interaction with the threats of censorship or malicious interventions, the role of imagined visions of the past in shaping the identity of a person or a society, struggle between a chase for an utopia and respect for personal freedom and many, many more. Multitude of themes and ideas at play in Primordia shows just how much love and heart the devs have poured into their work.

Setting of the game, being not just a delivery vector for the inquires and questions concerning general ideas shaping the world, is also genuinely interesting as an imagined world with an expansive history and lore. That exploration is somehow constrained by the game's relatively short playtime. Still, almost every encounter is not just an obstacle to overcome or a plot device, but brings with itself revelations concerning the broader background of the setting. My favorite example of this would probably be [spoiler]the alien robot who might be communicated with only through the radio, their surname created with a different rule than the one player is used to at this point[/spoiler].

One cannot forget to mention the game's gorgeous, distinctive and imaginative artstyle. Drawing inspirations not just from the classic postapocalyptic visages of [i]Mad Max 2[/i]'s ramshackle, improvised bricolages, added to the mix have been features of H.R.Giger's skeletal, oppressive sharp forms and Art Nouveau sleek architecture, [i](the latter mostly in the design of Metropol)[/i] creating a truly distinctive and fascinating vision. It's a shame how the low resolution of the game does not do the style justice, sometimes turning the characters and objects into featureless brownish-grayish pixel blobs with a hint of blue.

With the game being as great as it is, there are some grievances that stopped me from giving the game a full 5/5 rating. Apart from clunky interface and already mentioned low resolution, the design of some of the riddles leaves a lot to be desired. There is some pixel hunting, not helped by the points of interest blending with background sometimes. The biggest offender here would probably be the [spoiler]hatch on a car in the sewers[/spoiler]. Some may find the puzzles to be obtuse, especially with how many of them presuppose either some knowledge, or intuition, concerning the programming principles and formal logic. However, the toughest puzzles usually have some kind of alternative [i]skip[/i] solution and the Crispin is always there with optional tips prodding the player in the right direction, so I believe this problem to be alleviated somehow [i](except for [spoiler]the Primer's puzzle, where a critical clue for the ""right"" solution is hidden in an unrepeatable piece of dialogue[/spoiler]. Ugh)[/i].

Still, Primordia remains to me one of the most original and inventive worlds ever created. With witty dialogue, interesting setting and charming characters, it manages to present one of the best post-human [i](and yet still very humanistic)[/i] narratives in gaming, and perhaps among even cultural works in their entirety.",1677442859,1677442900,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,False,False,False,True,,1677459454,"What a beautiful review.

[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]

Primordia is point and click world building, puzzle solving, and decision making done very, very well. Multiple choices for some puzzles, with consequences and minor changes to the world based on how you go about it. This also includes an entire plethora of endings, covering a massive array of possible story beats.  

You are Horatio, a highly intelligent robot living in the ruins of some kind of ship, when an apparently big bad evil dude breaks into your home, shoots you, and steals your power core. Given you need that to live, it poses quit the challenge to your ongoing wellbeing. Thus begins your journey across the wastes, rubbing things on other things, making people repeat themselves, and showing them random junk in a one-sided and unsolicited conversation until you get back what‚Äôs yours.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
[list][*] What an interesting world. Very different to most others while drawing some clear inspiration. I loved the BASS references, the idea of a ruined echo of humanity screaming on into the void over a dead world they themselves had killed, and the idea of bluescreening being a curse.  
[*] Multiple methods of solving many of the puzzles, with some of them essentially being optional. 
[*] Philosophical in a nice way. Primordia doesn‚Äôt ram the questions it raises down your throat, nor do they form the basis of the story or the axis that the plot revolves around. They just [i]are[/i].
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list][*] Frustrating as all hell. This is a true pixel hunter, and there were at least two occasions I just booted up a walkthrough because I didn‚Äôt want to comb every section of every screen for the doodad I had missed.
[*] For every puzzle that is intuitive and has multiple paths, there are two which require oddly specific ways of getting around. 
[*] Massive steaming plot holes. Why didn‚Äôt Crispin need a ticket? Why couldn‚Äôt we climb over the bus into town? Why couldn‚Äôt we recruit friendly bots more effectively? When metro did what she did in the tunnels, why didn‚Äôt arbiter shut her down? 
[*] The game felt like it was meant to be so much bigger, but got stripped back last minute. Unused places, assets, and interactions. I‚Äôd like to see an ‚Äòextended edition‚Äô. 
[/list]

[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]
 [list][*] Allow the data pad to open in conjunction with interaction puzzles. 
[*] A double click to move/change scene.
[*] More variety in the base puzzle solving, the elements available when utilised were exceptionally strong. 
[/list]


[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]

Primordia is extremely good. Post-apocalyptic atmosphere, decent voice acting, and strong world building give it major punch in a PnC environment, it is also reasonably priced.

This is an absolute must for people who like to think about their games. It‚Äôs a solid investment for a veteran point and clicker looking for a challenge, and it‚Äôs got a ton of depth for people who like to get immersed in their games.

Primordia is not for newcomers to point and click, partly because of the pixel hunt frustration, partly because it doesn‚Äôt explain itself well. It isn‚Äôt for people who want a clear story and very tight writing, and it isn‚Äôt for children, with some quite dark scenes and concepts. 

Overall I recommend this, even at base price.",1676740132,1676740171,True,15,0,0.685567975044250488,2,False,False,False,True,,1676783887,Thanks for the long and thoughtful review!

- Using items on sidekick looking at nostril instead of actual hotspot since my character ""can't reach it""

Set in a post-apolgcapse scrap zone where humans are treated as gods but don't exist more, whereby intelligent machines are scavenging for survival and reason. We play as Horatio Nullbuilt while controlling his witty sidekick, Crispin who just wants to get their power core back that was stolen from their ship by an uninvited. The plot thickens once they get involved with robot politics and discover more about the religious subtext that was embedded into them by mankind. You can say these plot progression scenes are quite similar to the first Shrek movie, (please don't force me to explain how or why I felt the effort that comparison).

To avoid getting off track, if you're someone who wants to move on from this recent discussion about AI art and algorithm being able to write stories give Primodia a try. Many things, like voice acting, visuals and narrative are what carry this game. There is also a fascinating discussion about the relationship between humans and machines, code and order and the purpose of these new life forces being programmed to do in life.

There are also many quirky characters, they're all machines of course but are interesting in their rights thanks to their robotic language pattern swimming with personality which says a lot about their creator and what they went through to make it this far.

If any player reading is not familiar with part components and engineering, some puzzles may be difficult to navigate, but for the most part, it is pretty simple to pinpoint what you need to do.

By the end of the playthrough, I felt the story completely wraps itself nicely. Just while I was typing this review I notice how much I miss this game, wanting to replay it again to relive the amazing experience.

I'm trying to resist screaming about how amazing this game was because it is truly a great game that got me thinking deeper about my purpose on this pile of rocks. Want something deep and philosophical, play Primdoria.

You play as Horatio Nullbuilt, a simple robot living in a crashed airship with his floating companion Crispin, until one day a big bad robot steals their power core, and they track him to the mechanical city of Metropol. You will meet many other robots that will either help or hinder you. The setting is unique as there are no human characters, they (we?) have long been extinct and are referred by some as gods. Usually, post-apocalyptic stories always deal with human survivors looking for food and water. Here, bots only need power.

The post-human wasteland is very well presented in my opinion. Like the desert wastelands with metallic ruins, and the city that is seemingly made of scrap. The artwork kinda reminds me of H. R. Giger, but somewhat more mechanical and less biological. One thing that this games lack is the ""speech portrait"", where they show a pretty detailed close-up artwork of the speaking character's face. Maybe its not needed since these robots look pretty distinct from one another, with some probably don't have faces. Still would love a closer look at their speech portraits though.

Gameplay is the usual P&C formula, collecting and using items and talking to characters. There are some puzzles to solve along the way. I'll be honest, some puzzles here can be really hard as sometimes you are given clues, and do not know what to do with them. Or maybe even almost nothing at all! Maybe it's just me not catching up on clues on dialogues or the world, but I think without a guide I would be very, very confused and lost. A helpful tip is to keep an eye on your data pack, as important info are stored there and might present clues.

Despite the lack of human characters, it doesn't make this game less relatable in any way, since these bots have personalities and their own motives. It's probably one of the better P&C games out there, and one of Wadjet Eye's best work. However, there is a problem, which is its length. Its very short, even shorter than Gemini Rue. I would love to see more of this world, as there are sections of the city left unvisited, but mentioned in dialogues or in-game articles, and they seem interesting. 

Primordia's an amazing game, despite its difficulty. The atmosphere and artwork are great enough reasons to try this game, especially if you're a fan of the post-apocalypse genre. And be sure to try its 7 endings! Don't worry, all of them are achievable if you play nice and collect everything. If you're looking to buy this, I recommend just getting Wadjet Eye's Dark Futures bundle, as these games present 4 different, but each amazing, takes on the future world.",1674056249,1674056249,True,9,0,0.607665956020355225,6,True,False,False,True,,1674064345.0,"Thanks so much for the kind and detailed review!

Technically speaking, Primordia is not ""Wadjet Eye's work"" -- WEG was our publisher, but the game is all Wormwood Studios' work (I did the writing/design, James the programming, Victor the graphics). Gemini Rue was by another developer (Josh Nurnberger).

For what it's worth, Wadjet Eye Games (WEG) is both a developer and a publisher.

GAMES PUBLISHED BY WEG
- Primordia and Strangeland were developed by us (Wormwood Studios).
- Technobabylon was developed by Technocrat Games, but with art provided by WEG.
- Resonance was developed by xxii games, but with some writing (though no design AFAIK) by WEG.
- Gemini Rue was developed by Josh Nuernberger.
- A Golden Wake and Shardlight were developed by Grundislav Games (which also made Lamplight City, not published by WEG), but Shardlight was developed while the one guy who is ""Grundislav Games"" (Francisco) was being paid by WEG, which is why WEG is listed as the developer..
- Puzzle Bots was developed by Ivy Games.
- Da New Guys was developed by Icebox Studios.

GAMES DEVELOPED BY WEG
- WEG developed The Shivah, the Blackwell Series, Unavowed, and Emerald City Confidential.

All of these games share some similarities because they're all made in Adventure Game Studios (a third-party freeware engine) and because they use similar voice actors, but there's quite a bit of difference in the developers' philosophies.

So you might want to try out some other games by different developers published by WEG, as it's possible Primordia won't be the only one you enjoy."

It‚Äôs the kind that stays with you long after you have finished playing it.

Primordia is a game with outstanding writing, stunning artwork, soulful music and simple, but charming animations, all of which come together to create a truly captivating and memorable world.

The puzzles are fun and personally I had a blast exploring the world and hearing what the characters have to say in order to solve them, Memento‚Äôs being my favorite. Some might seem difficult, but the solution tends to be pretty simple. I haven‚Äôt played a point and click game in ages and it took me a bit to re-familiarize myself with the mechanics, so if you‚Äôre finding yourself struggling, that‚Äôs probably why!

The amount of voice lines written and recorded for the game is incredible, from simply inspecting things and interacting with them to idle banter and using items on something that you wouldn‚Äôt even expect to have a custom line. If you think you‚Äôve heard most of what the characters have to say, chances are you haven‚Äôt!

Friendly banter between the characters gives me life. The fact that Horatio and Crispin care so deeply and genuinely for each other not despite their differences, but rather thanks to them, is really heartwarming. I am absolutely in love with these guys.

I‚Äôve had only two problems with the game, first being misleading wording on the second question of a certain logic-related puzzle, which damaged my perfectionist I-solved-every-puzzle-myself pride a bit, but it‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt live down, especially considering this seems to have been discussed with and heard by the developers dozens of times by now. The other one is, in my understanding, an engine-specific bug, which causes music playing in the background to move to the audio setting, essentially causing two tracks to play at the same time. It affects your entire save and it cost me my second playthrough and quite some footage I'd been gathering due to me not realizing it was happening on time. (Moral of the story? Keep more save files!)

I‚Äôm not a particularly eloquent person in either of two languages I speak, but hey. This game pushed me to actually try and put my thoughts and emotions into words for a review for the very first time, so that has to mean something. I have been thinking about this game for the past few days and probably will continue doing so for years to come. Horatio and his friends have etched themselves deep into my soul, right next to stories I hold very near and dear. Did my personal history amplify that resonance? Probably. But that‚Äôs what stories do, don‚Äôt they? Among other things, they show you that you are not alone in whatever you‚Äôre going through.

Very grateful for being able to experience such a gem, even if I am a decade late. Thank you for creating and sharing it and good luck with your future projects, WWS.

So I'm going to rectify that on the 10th anniversary of the game's release being spotlighted by the developer.  

When I think back on the last 10 years of P&C adventure games, it's truly been a golden age.  There have never been so many quality releases from such a wide range of small one-off, one-person indie developers and more established indie companies with full teams and higher production values (for smaller indie companies at least).  I'm old, so I've been playing adventure games since the Infocom text adventure 'grey box' games thru the first Sierra graphic adventures into Lucas Arts' prime and then the subsequent prematurely declared 'death' of the genre when for the most part only a few European studios were putting out what (in retrospect at least) were at best mediocre games, and then the revival of the past decade or so, when the genre has never been stronger.  

And as I think back on the cream of the crop of this flourishing of the P&C genre, Primordia has a place in the top tier.  It's been a while since I played it -- which the 10th anniversary has reminded me I should remedy with a replay --  so specific details of the game's plot and puzzles have faded from my memory, but when I think of the game, I continue to have very fond and well maintained memories of its story, world building, characters, puzzles, et al.

The story throughline is presented early, and maintains a steady beat towards its' conclusion. It isn't particularly long, but I feel it goes far enough to tell a story and flesh out some convincing characters. I think the most gracious aspect of the game's design was the ability to consult your sidekick, Crispin, if you get stumped. Though sometimes I wish his responses were less candid and more cryptic. Second to that was the handy data-reader, which tracked most pertinent puzzle information. The overall puzzling here is mostly functional / logical, and rarely leaves you lost. But at the same time, I do recall having a couple hitches when the puzzles weren't as obvious, or the logic wasn't easily telegraphed by the conversation. Overall though I had a fine experience with this game. I think the art design is also noteworthy for its simplicity and effectiveness.

[h1]Tone & Humor[/h1]

Primordia has a very contradicting and yet very specific manner that it uses to project tone and humor. It's somber, sarcastic, bleak, self reflective and aware, silly and outright clever all at the same time. More than anything Primordia is very hard to describe!

[h1]Palette[/h1]

Everything is dull, dark, washed out, faded, and at times monotone. To understand why this is a positive for myself and part of the reason I recommend this game, I feel a good place to start and describe is the world setting.

Life has ceased to exist. Mankind now only a myth. You Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot built with an unclear purpose, accompanied by your sarcastic creation Crispin, go on an adventure through Primordia tracking down the heavily armed robot who stole your power core.

Without this power core, Horatio and Crispin cannot continue tinkering away the days. In time their power will run dry leaving them another empty husk like so many that litter the scorched earth.

[h1]Puzzles[/h1]

I found the puzzles in Primordia very hard and at times obtuse, that is until a certain in-game logic clicked into place for me. I was finding it frustrating at times not knowing what exactly to do because I myself didn't fully grasp the fact that I was controlling a robot coming to terms with the society that it's in and attempting to learn about a civilization that no longer exists (humanity).

Specifically I am referring to the location known as the [spoiler]city of Metropol[/spoiler]. It was this area that I started to struggle. The puzzles in this area requires the player to learn and understand the environment they're in in order to reach the logical conclusion.

That is where my enjoyment of Primordia sky rocketed.

[h1]Ridiculous Example[/h1]

I'd give an actual in-game example however I feel like that'd be beyond a spoiler so instead I'll have fun dreaming up a silly metaphor. Imagine you're Dante from The Divine Comedy. You are in what appears to be the third circle of hell, know as gluttony. You look around and are unable to comprehend your surroundings fully nor are you able to figure out what you should do. After piecing together all the information you've read and heard since arriving, you realise that you're in hells equivalent to McDonalds. You are now aware that you're expected to order food here. Understanding this, the environment begins to make sense (more sense than this awful metaphor I'm enjoying typing). Armed with this information you can understand the logic of the items around you, what they do and why. Using this new information, you order a cheese burger overcoming the puzzling situation you're in.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]

I really enjoyed this title. The pace of the plot is great. You can check yourself via trailer, the animations, soundtrack, ambience and over all art style as a complete package etc are fantastic.

I love Point & Click Adventure games and I even seek out retro style ones.  I don't mind playing 8-bit or new HD graphics.  What I do generally prefer is an escape, a sense of grand adventure.  My preferences are more high fantasy, but it seems like the majority of P&C games over the past few decades are all post apocalyptic dystopian type futures.  That's okay, it must be what the majority of people want, but I have a difficult time enjoying those settings unless the game is absolutely spectacular in other ways.  For example, I very much enjoyed Daedalic's Deponia series which also takes place in a post apocalyptic type dystopian future.

The game's tone is perhaps a little to somber for me.  Although artistically I can see a lot of work and details that went into the games design, it's not colors or settings I enjoy seeing.  Everything is dull, dark, washed out, faded, a bit too monotone.    That seems to be the same sort of way that the characters come across to me as well.  They just don't have enough personality... but what can I expect they are all robots.  Even wen they display some type of emotion it then seems out of place since they are, again... robots.  Everything considered I do think they did a fairly good job with the story.  It is interesting but it feels oddly paced.  You either progress it at a snails pace or it's sort of revealed in large chunks all at once.  I also feel like there should have been more to it that you could discover.  You learn early on about your own past name but don't really get much more on that till the end of the game and what I got didn't feel complete or satisfactory.  It would have been more interesting to unlock pieces here and there throughout the game and had a clearer more in-depth understanding of who you were/are.  Also the world feels large, but what you are allowed to explore feels so small.

My other issue with the game is that it seems to have a lot of the problems people often complain about with P&C adventures.  A few here and there are forgivable but too many and it makes the game far less enjoyable.  The first is the ever unpopular pixel hunting.  Unfortunately it's difficult to tell what items you can and can't interact with and where items you need are.  For example, finding the tape deck or noticing scrapers bomb, even finding the extra battery.  An option to highlight hotspots would have been nice for making sure you've not missed something.  Though I don't always use them, I do appreciate those options when I'm stuck.

The second issue is that the game doesn't offer quick travel across screens by clicking.  Now this one is arguable because you can use the map to quick jump to other locations, but I found the act of going to the map and selecting the locations more cumbersome than just walking there from one screen to another.  A simple ability to double click the screen exit and quickly jump to the next screen would have been a great addition.  Also, the ability to adjust the character's walk speed could have helped as well.  In addition, I found it odd that when you start in the wastelands you can't navigate around the wastelands by exploring from one screen to the other, the only mode of exploration is to use the map to select locations.  I would have enjoyed ""discovering"" locations by walking through the wastelands more than just entering the coordinates and then jumping to the location.  While quick jump map points are great especially after you initially discover a location, nothing really beats that sense of exploration and ""finding"" a new location.

Thirdly, I found too many of the puzzles to be obtuse.  They didn't seem to have a logical solution.  I will admit that I recently broke my arm and had to have it surgically repaired and that as a result I had to take some heavy narcotics.  Being that I couldn't really get up and do much of anything during that time, I decided to play this game.  It's possible that the narcotics were just dulling my mind too much but I felt like the puzzles and solutions just didn't seem obvious enough, didn't have good clues for solving them, weren't logical or we're overly complicated.  I ended up having to use walkthrough or randomly guess at things.  Especially the puzzle involving the information kiosk and the Robot Law puzzle.  I guess considering my condition while playing you'll have to judge these ones for yourself, but even replaying it for missing achievements after weaning down on med I still found myself wondering ""how would I have gotten the necessary information to proceed?""  I already knew at that point having played through once (with a walkthrough) but it didn't seem like I found any additional information that would lead me to those solutions had I not already known what to do.

I did find it interesting that the game offered multiple endings.  You could join Metromind, you could kill yourself, you could Kill Metromind.  There were variations on the different endings depending who you helped or saved too.  However, this also brings up another issue I had with the game which is another one that people often dislike from P&C's is that to get some of the endings required you to make certain choices early on in the game without knowing they would have any effect on your ending.  Meaning to get the other endings you probably have to start over from the beginning.

I did enjoy that there were 29 achievements in this game and that they were not all just story unlocked.  Several of them were challenging, but mostly because they required doing certain actions correctly from the beggining and following through to a specific ending.  There's an achievement for pretty much each of the different endings.  If you save at the right time you may not need to replay it to get those endings.  About 11 of them are missable achievements, I believe 10 of them are ending related (if I'm remembering correctly) and that would leave 8 story unlocked ones.  While it's not a bad mix you'll need to get almost all of the missable ones if you also want to unlock all the ending options.  Strategic saving could possibly eliminate the need to replay completely.  Replaying for missed achievements is something I often do with games and I usually don't mind.  This game felt like a chore to replay which tells me how little I enjoyed playing it and how little replay value it has.

I think the best part of the game has to be Crispin Horatiobuilt.  To be honest he reminds me a little of Cedric from King's Quest 5 (with a less annoying voice and more interactivity) or Joey from Beneath a Steel Sky (which I believe this game draws some inspiration from).  Crispin is the majority of comic relief and emotion in the game and in my opinion ,the most interesting character in it.

Overall, I think there are definitely Point & Click fans who will enjoy this game and it does offer a good story, well done graphics and animation, good voice acting, and about 4-6 hours of play time for one playthrough.  If robots and dystopian futures are your thing and you love P&Cs especially with puzzles... you might want to give it a try.  If you don't care for those things you might want to pass.",1663163992,1663163992,False,3,0,0.488061487674713135,18,True,False,False,True,,1663165610.0,"Sorry you didn‚Äôt enjoy it! I agree that players who don‚Äôt like P&C games with puzzles should skip it. To me the two are inextricably intertwined, but I know lots of folk prefer the more purely narrative sort like Unavowed!

(Both puzzles you mention as stumping you are optional as it happens, though. You can just ask Clarity to judge that case, and you can skip the kiosk entirely! But no matter what, it‚Äôs a game with lots of puzzles.)

I‚Äôd steer clear of our follow up Strangeland given your preferences. It‚Äôs not post apocalyptic and it does have double click to leave rooms, but is even less comedic, still puzzle oriented, no highlight all hotspots button (I have a deep opposition to that, even though I myself use the feature when it‚Äôs there‚ÄîI won‚Äôt derail things by monologuing on it).

Where Strangeland excels in telling its incredible narrative through the harrowing winds of a tempestuous madness, Primordia excels in delivering an equally provocative narrative through characters, worldpieces, and subtle messages told along the way that reveal a far darker, more sinister background to this bleak and dilapidated landfill we once dubbed Earth.

First off, I need to get this off my chest because I've waited nearly 3 years to say this: Primordia's aesthetic is jaw-droppingly, tear-jerkingly gorgeous to me. I sat for hours in the Unniic just listening to Metromind preach of the grandeur of her City of Glass and Light, and I wish I could go back to make those hours an eternity. Every dusty, broken-down heap, gilded with the faint remnants of a false life, flickering with the melancholy flakes of a binary will that inches to survive; it all was just so haphazardly beautiful to me that it lingered in my psyche for years to come. I think it goes without saying, but the art direction that these games receive is some of the best in the indie industry.

There are a TON of things I'd love to talk about in this review, but I just don't have the time, so I'll limit it to this: Primordia is the first game I've ever played to make me truly question if the antagonist is truly a villain or not. Metromind is a character masterclass on how to truly maroon your audience in the limbo of their own morality. And don't mishear me: other video game antagonists, such as Gwyn, Lord of Cinder from Dark Souls or The Pale King from Hollow Knight, make it perfectly clear that they are morally grey; that have done equally good and bad things and that characterizing them as hero or villain is, at best, shortsighted and foolish. But halfway through her monologues at the peak of the tower, I was seriously questioning whether or not Metromind was truly unjust in both her actions and her ideals, and if I was the fool all along. She's characterized by many to be an authority-hungry power-junky, but if she really wanted to hoard power, she would never have created a city where robots could thrive and never worry about energy usage. She bans religion, and the act of leaving the city, but the robots she cares for just don't know any better. They don't understand that if they leave the city, they'll likely perish in the dunes, or if they worship Man, then they will become preaching slaves to ideals that staunch the act of progress; the very ideal that Metropol runs off of. Every action she took had me question what would truly be the best course of action if NOT that: Either steal the power-sources from outside the dunes and neutralize any hostility in your way, or let Metropol slowly bleed out without the means to provide for its citizens. Either usurp the regents and adjudicators that once held the city together, or let all perish in the wake of your humility. Either stop Horatio and Crispin from taking what's theirs, or let them have it so they can die in silence amidst the nil. It's SOOO interesting, and lingered in my system years after I had completed the game. Because of that ALONE, this game enters my top 10 favorites, and I don't feel a shred of doubt saying that.

Where other mechanical medias focus so much on the age-old, beaten-to-death question, ""What does it mean to be Human[?]"", Primordia pushes far past that to the point of no return; to a world where we had our chance, and failed, and naught but the scattered shrapnel of that failure remains in our wake, asking us with sorrow, ""What remains of Humanity when we are gone?"" I can think of few other games that left me staring dead at the screen when it was all over, begging in my mind to relive it all again, if only to die once more.

A fascinating story told in an intersting way, and while the art has kind of a monolithic color palette (i.e. brown) the art is so well done and interesting on it's that what seems at a glance to be a very bland visual style is in fact one the best looking games Wadjet Eye has ever released!

The soundtrack also stands on its own in comparison to other indie titans in several regards.

There's also a little bit of extra fan service content on the ""Primordia game"" site for people who don't want to part with the world yet in the form of a spoiler-free visual novella, a character log and a short poem.

Maybe humans wanted to make their creations seem more like them?

I wish there was a little more of the world to explore, There are really only two locations and many associated locations within those.

It's aged pretty well too for a ten year old game, assuming you like SCUMM style point and clicks that is.  This very much had some strong Beneath a Steel Sky vibes tot it.

EDIT: responding to the dev comment:  Forgot about Steeple.  So the robots built by humans built robots as they were made themselves, which makes sense I suppose.  Kind of like the zeroth law of robotics.  Anyway thanks so much for commenting, and of course making such a fun game.  Looking forward to some of the other titles I saw as well.",1643110681,1643197527,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,1643123732,"Glad you liked it! Even finishing a game of this scope was hard for a team of hobbyists, as we opted for depth of areas (plenty of things to interact with) rather than breadth (more rooms). Certainly compared to something like Monkey Island 2 it is much smaller!

The robots have gender (in a very loose sense) because humans gender all sorts of things (ships, tools) including concepts such as justice or the homeland. Most of the gendered robots in the game were made that way by humans‚Äîthink of Clarity like the statue of justice outside a courthouse. After humans were gone, surviving robots continued to play out the roles they had been assigned, and some even gave themselves such roles to make sense of the world. 

The game mentions that humans had delegated even religious functions to robots (hence Steeple) and after humanity disappeared the AI responsible for religion used that as a lens for explaining the relationship of humans and machines. 

Hope that helps!"

Pros:
- Very well voice acted
- Pretty funny at times
- Interesting take on what would happen to self-aware robots after humans are extinct
- The robots all had definitive personalities that came through well
- Lots of different endings to try out. I like that it gives you options for how to resolve the story - I found it lets you do what *you* would do rather than forcing you to choose between less-than-ideal options.

Cons:
- Very difficult at times. Even having a function to highlight all interactable objects would help significantly. As it was, I ended up having to use a walkthrough for more of it than I'd have liked.
- There is a hint system, but most of the time it doesn't tell you anything, and when it does it's often useless (e.g. telling you your next objective without any hints as to how).
- Unlike most P&C games, you can't double click an exit to quickly go there. You have a fast travel system for most of the game so this isn't a big deal, but it would be nice.

Mechanically, the game has smoothly incorporated a lot of functions that would otherwise mess with immersion. For instance, I ended up utilizing the hint function several times before I even realised that's what it was - I thought I was just making conversation.

Highly recommended for anyone with a passing interest in point-and-click games.

The graphics are as you see in the screenshots; exceptional and stylistic with a retro resolution.

The story is excellent but impressionistic. It feels true to life in that common knowledge is never explained, but that leaves us in the dark about so much of the world's history.

Which is all great, but there are some flaws.

You will get immersed inside its fantastically designed, post apocalyptic world with the melancholic atmosphere, the emotional dark story and the unique characters. But it is not only the narrative that shines here. The pixelated visuals are so artistic, the puzzles are well built and creative, the music is remarkable, the voice acting excellent and the humor discreet but enjoyable. ""Primordia"" was developed by a small team but managed to become one of the best point and click adventures of the decade.


Manometer: 9/10[/b]


The good
- It is so artistic visually. Great pixelated graphics with a unique brownish color palette. Fantastically designed post apocalyptic world with a lot of details here and there.
- Awesome melancholic, dark atmosphere. It has something metaphysical in it.
- Great sci-fi story full of mysteries, agony and emotions. The past and the present come together gradually managing to maintain your curiosity till the end. One of the best stories in the genre.
- Marvelous, weird characters. They are well designed visually with unique personalities. Some of them are really crazy. The protagonists, Horatio and Crispin are so loveable and iconic.
- Puzzles are genuine, well built and creative with good variation. They are very challenging without being too difficult. Each one of them gives you enough clues to proceed to the next one. You won't get stuck somewhere for long. Great balance that helps the game's excellent pacing.
- Fantastic music. It is mostly calm and subtle but enhances the atmosphere in the best possible way. Each place has its own musical identity.
- Very good and convincing voice acting performances. Nicely processed robotic voices.
- A lot of well written dialogues. You will never get bored of speaking with the NPCs. Horatio and Crispin can comment on so many different things and object combinations. Also if you stay inactive for some time the characters start making clever comments by their own. There is a lot of work here.
- Good, discreet sense of humor (mainly coming from Crispin) that gives you a small break from the melancholic atmosphere without ruining it.
- Simplistic but smooth and pleasant animations.
- Great overall design that manages to direct your gaze to the interactive objects, although the game is mostly brownish visually. There is almost no annoying pixel hunting here.
- It is philosophical enough. It makes some deep thoughts about communities' structure, artificial intelligence, humanity and civil rights.
- Instead of adding a typical hints' button, they have incorporated it inside Crispin. If you are out of ideas you can have a short conversation and he will give you a little push. It just feels more natural this way.
- It offers fast travelling through a map you are carrying. This is a nice addition to avoid big and boring walking sessions.
- It has multiple endings depending on you decisions during the last parts of the game.
- There are many hidden things to discover, while some information will be revealed only if you do things in a certain way. That gives the game some extra depth and a little bit more replayability.
- It is cheap for a game that good.

The bad
- The upper dropping menu is a little bit annoying. It comes out much earlier before your cursor hits the top side of the screen. You will end up opening it accidentally all the time.
- There is only one puzzle that I found its logic a little bit odd (the memorioum one).
- There are two or three objects in your inventory that are used too many times in multiple puzzles. This is not necessarily bad, but alternative solutions may be more creative.
- I wanted more. Wish it was longer.",1638228409,1638241437,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,1638231326.0,"What an amazing review! Extremely generous, both in its assessment of the game and in the way you have taken time to provide key information to potential customers.

For what it's worth, one tiny tidbit re: the reusing items con. This was a deliberate choice, maybe right, maybe wrong, based on my view that when you have an item repeatedly used, it enhances the character by becoming a sort of signature accoutrement (Indie's whip, Bobbin's distaff, etc.). Agreed that it can make some puzzles a bit dumb, though. :)"

The pixelized graphics are gorgous, audio design is great for the most part.

Some puzzles were a bit headscratchers, until I realized the game had an automatic notes-list, which had the clues to the puzzles I was stuck on... doh. The puzzles generally were sensible, but one particular one was a bit too much for me, even after reading a walkthrough I still don't have a clue how was I supposed to figure out [spoiler]the last word to enter in a terminal.[/spoiler].

I'm not much of an achivement hunter, but I did see through few of the possible endings (at least some of them can be seen just by loading a save from last possible room & trying out different outcomes). 

On technical side, the game did not crash, ran well, but alt-tabbing caused few odd issues. The audio kept looping in the background, and windows were jumping around as if the display mode had changed. There were odd colored bars on the sides of my screen, it looked like the game wasn't meant to run on a 16:9 display. Nothing fatal, but just weird.

Within the first hour of gameplay you'll probably be confused about what exactly the story of Primordia as but the slow build up is a great pay off and helps to develop a strong relationship between the two main characters and fantastic world building. 

Primordia has some really great writing, interesting and even challenging puzzles, characters you'll connect with and some fun references to games like Fallout. Even the voice acting is great and really helps to draw you in to the story and characters. Normally I would quickly go over the plot of the game but I feel like anything I say could be a spoiler. 
Primordias art style is almost Gaudi like which pleases the eyes because nothing is ever boring to look at despite the heavy use of orange and browns.  
The relationship between Horatio and Crispin harkens back to that of Foster and Joey from the Steel Sky games another great sci-fi post apocalypse point & click game, and their back and forth will keep you amused throughout the whole game.
 The Gameplay itself is very user friendly like any typical point & click adventure game Primordia is controlled entirely with the mouse making it easy for anyone to play. Primordia can run on just about anything unless you're trying to run it on a potato.
Primordia is honestly an amazing adventure game and I think it's one of those games that you just have to play to really get what makes it so fun.

The game tells an interesting and well thought-out post-apocalyptic story. The story allows for a certain degree of variance as to its flow as well as it offers multiple endings.

[b] Assets [/b]
The game's assets are really unique and well-made. The decision to keep the game in the style of the 90s, i.e. pixelated sprites, has made the game feel nostalgic as for someone growing up in the 90s.

The ambient background music and sound effects are climatic and fit the general atmosphere of the game.

[b] Puzzles and item interaction system [/b]
The puzzles were interesting and a pleasure to solve. To the contrary of some point & click games, all the item interactions are well thought-out and logical. It was nice to have Crispin give you hints whenever it was necessary.

I was impressed with the amount of work the developers put into the item interaction system. Noticing how trying to combine certain two items results in a very specific, witty and unambiguous comment from the main character surprises the player in a positive way.

I liked the many computer science references and jokes, be it hardware or software related.

[b] Summary [/b]
[i] Primordia [/i] can easily be classified as one of the best point & click adventure games I have ever played. Merging the two worlds of post-apocalypse and cyberpunk together and expressing them so beautifully through art style, music and interesting ideas requires a lot of creativity and effort for which the developers deserve praise.

[i] Primordia [/i] easily deserves a 10/10 rating.

I'm giving a thumbs down to water down all the praise. I genuinely think that this game is overrated.

First of all, the worldbuilding in this game is exceptional. Everything is thought out and I can see that the developers spent a lot of time making this world live and breathe.

However the gameplay combines the worst aspects of point and click genre. Pixelhunting, collecting every piece of junk to your inventory and then combining it all together or applying to every interactable pixel you have successfully hunted down. In the end, the gameplay was quite tedious to me.

The single reason why I completed the game is because I had a walkthrough. I don't mind being stuck, but only if it happens occasionally. I don't mind hard puzzles, in fact, I love them. But only when they are built on logic instead of trial and error.

The story for the most part is pretty basic: they stole something from us, let's take it back. Only in the very end there will be some development for this.

I won't say that this is a bad game. It clearly isn't. But I was expecting a lot more after seeing its Steam rating. Maybe I was just unlucky when I got stuck for the first couple times and then my initial displeasement affected the rest of the game. Or maybe I just need to accept the fact that point and click games are not for me.

Anyway, I can't really recommend this game, unless you are a point and click fan and want to experience a carefully built world. Don't hesitate to check a walkthrough once you're stuck.",1623948297,1623948297,False,12,0,0.604058146476745605,0,False,False,False,False,,1623954851.0,"Sorry you had such a disappointing experience.

I wouldn't want Primordia to discourage you from trying other P&C games, though. Some have no meaningful puzzles to speak of (e.g., Unavowed, Backbone), others have no inventory puzzles (e.g., Loom, Botanicula), so you can find games in the genre that might bother you less. Obviously I'm biased in its favor (else, why bother making such niche games?), but I've always felt that point-and-clicks offer a unique experience that can be a very special one, though obviously not for all players.

As for your Primordia-specific criticisms, they're all fair reasons to dislike the game. You can get hints from Crispin, so consulting a walkthrough is not per se necessary, but some players find the hints themselves inadequate.

Sorry you came away unsatisfied. Our goal is always to provide greater value than the player invests in the game, so that he or she comes away enriched. Sorry that didn't happen in your case."

edit:
I was too lazy to write a review but if a developer actually cares enough to respond to my lazy period I guess i'll write one. 

This game feels like a classic. The puzzles are all really well made and don't feel like your just arbitrarily clicking on things hoping to progress, and genuinely make you feel like you solved something. One really good example of this is one of the chapters revolves around you getting a bunch of number sequences that make up a code for a door and you need to figure out how all of the numbers fit together in the larger sequence and it doesn't tell you how, and nor will I, but when you figure it out you'll understand why it's such a brilliant puzzle. 

On the story side they managed to create a world that feels lived in, with a history far longer than what is seen from our perspective with characters that feel both real and consistent. Horatio and Crispin have a great dynamic and their dialogue and voice acting are great. The story is really well written and it really drives you to learn as much out the world and explore the secrets of the past.  

(Minor spoilers... sorta?)

I would say my only gripes with the game is that most of the endings you can get are achieved the last like 3 minutes and can be completely missed if you fail to click on a single dialogue option in the final confrontation and there's like four achievements tied to endings so you have to keep replaying that final dialogue multiple times to get them. It didn't really feel like my ending was as a result of how I played the game up to that point but only choices made in those final moments. I wouldn't say this ruined the experience for me or anything as I was still invested enough to go and see those endings but maybe something to think about for any future releases.",1623698201,1623702134,True,29,3,0.766083061695098877,2,True,False,False,False,,1623707150.0,"Thanks so much for this extended, and lovely review -- you're very generous, and I think your mild criticism at the end is quite fair.

Once I was hooked by the story I wanted to see everything the game had to offer in one weekend.
It has a very intriguing story, if a little brief. I find the world the developers created captivating and close to an actual future for us if technology is left to run rampant. Robots have become the primary life form and what has happened to the human race is a mystery. The plot unravels at a brisk pace, which I find refreshing. The more I played the more I wanted to learn about the game world and the lore behind it. 
The voice acting is exceptional. You may recognize several of the voice actors from other indie games. The main character is voiced by Logan Cunningham, best know as the narrator from Supergiant Games' Bastion. 
The gameplay will be familiar to any veteran of the point and click genre. I was able to start the game and hit the ground running without any instructions. The puzzles aren't too difficult, I was able to brute force my way through some of them. 
If I had to give this game a numbered score, it would be 8/10. My only complaints would be its brevity, but honestly that could be seen as a positive aspect. Also there is no way to highlight objects that can be interacted with, which would be a nice option.

Very charming game that is well worth your purchase.

The puzzle design in this game is its main draw as the puzzles not only feature multiple ways to go about solving them, but even feature choices that alter the world and other characters. I also especially enjoyed the character interactions and humor the game has to offer. The game is very engaging. It's only about 6-7 hours long but you can easily play it a second time to explore other options so I would say its worth the $10.

The story is a bit shallow and the lore leaves me with some unanswered questions, but overall still of high enough quality.

[h1]The Pros[/h1]
‚Ä¢ The art direction is really, really cool. It's steampunk, but not at the same time. I love the designs for the various robots you interact with.
‚Ä¢ The premise is also, [i]really, really cool[/i]. There's a lot of lore and it sorta just sucks you in.
‚Ä¢ It's fully voice acted, and the voice acting is well complimented by a witty script that kept me grinning.
‚Ä¢ For the most part, the story makes sense (I may need to replay it). I'd say it leaves me with ""healthy"" hypothetical questions, rather than plot holes or cliffhangers.
‚Ä¢ Speaking of hypothetical questions, there's a lot of science fiction themes being explored here. However, I'm very impressed that they address some that I've never seen before in a robots-only setting (which I won't spoil).
‚Ä¢ This is one of the few games I've played where the only character arc was my own, and I was extremely satisfied when Horatio reflected my sentiments to uncovering the plot.
‚Ä¢ I found pretty much all of the characters to be likable and distinguishable from one another. Even if the names are similar, the personalities are not.

[h1]The Cons[/h1]
‚Ä¢ The game in and of itself is a puzzle. You're piecing together how to get from A to B, because someone told you about B but you can't find any evidence of B at A until you've explored all of C, which someone else will tell you about. Needless to say, there's plenty of sleuthing and there were a couple of occasions where I was stuck banging my head against a wall until something clicked.
‚Ä¢ Some environments didn't entirely sell me. For example, characters just happen to have been standing in place for an indeterminate amount of time until you come along. Others felt like going through a grandiose entrance to find that the only animals at the zoo are a few flamingos and an anteater.
‚Ä¢ To add to that, environments are needlessly complicated. There's plenty of things for Horatio to observe but carry no functional purpose. If I got lost I'd just examine everything and eventually Horatio would give a massive clue that I'm supposed to interact with it.
‚Ä¢ Some dialogue checks ask for the ""most correct"" answer. I screwed up on one and did my homework, came back to retake it, gave a correct answer, but not [i]the[/i] answer.
‚Ä¢ Trying not to spoil the plot, but there's only one ending that I found satisfying and I wasn't able to get it on my first try.
‚Ä¢ This game has a locked aspect ratio that makes black and red bars appear on the sides of my screen, which was weird. Steam overlays don't work well and the audio gets really janky if you alt-tab.

[h1]The Indecisive[/h1]
‚Ä¢ Graphically, I'm uncertain. It's obviously pixelated to an extent, but it appears as though it was originally hand drawn (as aliasing on many sprites suggests). However, the steampunk-esque asthetic falls apart in some places because wood, metal, and brass are all very [i]brown[/i]. This made some areas boring to look at.
‚Ä¢ Though I don't really play point-and-clickers, this game has some of the tropes that I associate the genre with. Characters say their dialogue once, and I often forgot crafting recipes or points of interest. However, when I pulled off a puzzle I felt really good. In that way, this game feels a lot older than it actually is.
‚Ä¢ Crispin, whom you can talk to for hints, can get confused if you mess up on things or do them out of order. For example, I failed a dialogue check and Crispin had no idea on how to advise me thereafter. You should really try and do all the conversations before moving on so that way Crispin works correctly, because though you've spoken to someone, you may not have selected the dialogue tree related to the hint he gives (otherwise the hints lose their luster or he can tell you about stuff you haven't discovered yet).

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
Overall, [i]Primordia[/i] gave me a unique experience in a stimulating setting and story that reminds me of [i]2064 Read Only Memories[/i]. The characters are all robots, but they're neither apathetic nor overly emotional. The story unravels well, even if I end up running in circles during some of the sleuthing. I'm glad I bought it and will likely play through it again.

Aside from the obvious (unique art and an interesting setting), you're able to ask your sidekick for guidance. He doesn't give you the answers, but he often offers a sanity check. ""Maybe what we need isn't in this area, boss."" Similarly, your character offers up sanity checks and just-helpful-enough advice such as, ""I'm not here to fix that"", so you know you don't need bang your head against the wall trying to fix it.

This may be the first point-and-click adventure game since I first got access to the internet, where I didn't get so frustrated with a puzzle that I gave up and looked it up. Sometimes you just need a little nudge in the right direction to know where to apply yourself without giving away the solution, and Primordia walks that fine line well.

In addition to the style, setting, and great voice acting, the story outdoes itself with multiple endings that involve doing different solutions to the end puzzle, instead of just letting you pick a different dialog choice (though a few of those are on the table as well). I highly recommend Primordia to fans of point-and-click adventure games.",1616622027,1616622027,True,1,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False,False,,1616627600.0,"‚ÄúThis may be the first point-and-click adventure game since I first got access to the internet, where I didn't get so frustrated with a puzzle that I gave up and looked it up.‚Äú

That's really the best way to describe it; it has an interesting setting, it has interesting characters, it has an interesting progression of events. The ideas, the lore, the commentary on different aspects like progress and individuality. All of it is interesting, contemplative and creatively rich. There is a lot to talk about, so let's get right to it.

The visual design of Primordia is alien, quite literally so as it seems to draw some inspiration from Ridley Scott, and it affects everything in the game. The UI design, the layout of the starting ship, the dirtiness of its setting, the questions of sentience and morality in its narrative; it's all steeped in this sense of slow decay, where choices are made with the realisation that it won't really make the world better or regain what has been lost, but instead secure a bit of happiness in the face of an ultimate end. It's bleak, but not entirely hopeless, as there are happy endings to be had even in a world of rust and sand - if you can get to it, that is.

Scavenging is important in the world of Primordia, which fits perfectly with its point & click gameplay. Primordia was a game that clearly helped Wadjet Eye Games to set a pretty impressive image of adventure games that make sense, with logical puzzles that still requires some thought to figure out. The amount of solutions that rely on ""moon logic"" (meaning using random objects with each other for a nonsensical result) is close to zero, which makes the experience so much easier to digest. With that said, Primordia does require more thought than most of its siblings in the Wadjet Eye library, but has a handy sidekick to give you hints as well as alternate solutions for some puzzles to make up the difference. It's quite effective in establishing trust, which leaves room for the game to be a bit more complex. A lot of the time I was stuck simply because I hadn't listened closely enough, or just didn't remember a certain piece of information. In other words, the game requires a bit from you as a player, but it's rarely unfair.

However, there is a negative in the game, and it's somewhat severe; the way that it focuses on exploration clashes with its artstyle. The way that the game handles hurdles is through exploration, meaning that the best way to get unstuck is to look around; maybe there's another puzzle that gives you an item, or maybe you need information from some NPC. The problem is that environments are difficult to see clearly and many interactable elements simply blend into the background. I don't know how many times I walked back and forth across a wooden walkway in the sewers before I noticed that there was something in the water right next to it, and I only discovered it because I happened to move my mouse over it by accident. This is a problem in many point & click games (""pixel hunting"" is a term for a reason), but it's particularly bad in Primordia because of the muddy colour pallet and the way that you normally solve problems - by going around the entire world talking to people. 

You can imagine the situation yourselves; you can't for the life of you figure out the solution to that one puzzle, so you end up looking everywhere, interacting with everything just to make sure that there isn't anything new, only to go back to the beginning and find that you just missed a piece of texture that apparently was something important. It's partially a failure of the visual composition where many things could have been improved, from colour choices to visual effects to camera angles, and partially the failure on the mechanical side, with a lack of a ""view all interactables"" button of some sort. This game more than any other needed to consider the user experience when crafting these aspects simply due to its artstyle, and failed miserably in doing so.

And yet, for being the only real issue in the game, I can't say that it had an enormous impact on the experience. I've given it a lot of space because it simply deserves being pointed out, and Primordia is a great example of the problem. It's annoying and bogs down the pacing, but it doesn't make the world or the narrative less believable like some other games are guilty of. In a way you can say that the flaw matches the game, with its intricacies and mysteries and alienness. If there would have been more urgency in the narrative I would have probably felt much worse about it, but the main character is a scavenger in an unfamiliar place; it almost makes sense for him to stumble around a little. It is still a flaw though, one that undoubtedly should have been discovered and adressed.

In the end, Primordia is a great adventure game. The setting is great, the characters fit in perfectly, and the tone of a world in decline is perfect for the narrative it presents. It has its flaws, and much like many of Wadjet Eye's games it doesn't quite reach the level of truly breathtaking, but dang it if I don't end up caring and feeling satisfied by the end anyway. There is a core of greatness in this game, a reflection of what a dystopic future actually means for the inhabitants of it and if good can still be preserved in it. It's a thoughtful game that deserves your attention, so I suggest you simply give it its due.",1613336113,1613336113,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,1613340257.0,"What a beautiful‚Äîand thoughtful‚Äîreview.

This game it's a classic style like...but with a serious reflexion about humanity.
you get lot of soft humor
this kind of game could be judged by 3 criterias : graphics, story, puzzle
Graphics ; it's old PnC style, ""hand drawing""... old gamers would love it
story : interesting ,easy to follow...maybe too much...it's linear, you smell easily the conclusion, but humot and multiple ending it makes the job.
Puzzle : easy...reeeealllyyyy easy... it's impossible to be blocked.

i recommand PRIMORDIA, maybe because i like the old fashion style PnC... but i spent a good moment, not too long, not too short, it's more like a movie to watch  than a book to read.

One of the best, if not the best point & click I have ever played, the story is amazing, it has some different endings too depending on the actions you take along the game. Every problem the game brings at you can be solved with pure logic, if you put your brain to work you will surely come to a correct answer unlike many other games in the genre, where if you don¬¥t know the answer then just try throwing random objects at the problem and it will eventually work. This game discourages you from doing that, making you have to take a longer path to solve the problem if you just try random things. 
The writing is phenomenal, every character is fleshed out, has his own desires and fits a perfect place in the game's world, which is also very well done and feels very real, every detail is thought out and more than once the game surprised me by allowing me to take on a problem from a different approach. The pixel art is really beautiful, and although the resolution is rather low, it's not a problem, as everything is detailed and easy to identify. Also, this game gives me Planescape: Torment vibes for some reason, and I really love that game.

Pros:
Excellent story
Really well produced world, lots of back story and consistent theme.
Puzzles are well balanced, they can be tricky, but always fair.

Some of the lines, are funny, but become a bit overused for my liking (like smeg in Red Dwarf we have a lot of B'soding).
Resolution on modern systems is a bit of a problem, I had to read community guides to get it looking half decent on my Surface Book.
Because of the above, I couldnt use my pen as a pointer, which I value.

This game deserves a higher rating than I'm giving it , I enjoyed it and can ""feel"" the effort and quality of work put in. Something just didn't quite click - like it has done with other modern point and clicks I've played. (Kathy Rain for example)

You're right that the graphics' resolution is really about a decade or more older than when the game was released.

Our next game, Strangeland (which should be out in February) is SVGA resolution (four times as many pixels!), but that actually makes it even more antiquated relative to the present year given how long it's been since Primordia -- SVGA adventure games came out about 20 years ago. :)"

There was good: great story, characters and setting/lore, some puzzles that were satisfying to solve, good voice acting and music, immersive art and multiple ways to do some things. The game was very atmospheric which was great.

But there was also the bad, of which was mainly how frustrating the game could get. A lot of the puzzles just don't have a deductible solution. I either had to click each and every item with every other item, and then every item with every object in a scene and if that didn't work, give up and look up a guide. It's never a good feeling to have to look up a guide to get through a game, and I rarely resort to that, but this game was just often aggravating. Sometimes there's a random item hidden away in a place you could hardly notice it at, sometimes you'd get stuck even after clicking everywhere on the scene because you had to [i] right [/i] click something instead of left click it...

Maybe this kind of game just isn't for me. But after finishing a game, I step back and ask myself three questions. How much did I enjoy playing it? How do I feel about the game as a whole now that I've beaten it? And will this game have any lasting effect on me, like scenes and quotes that stick with me or affect anything I do in the future?

The answers to these questions are: 1) not really, 2) satisfied with the ending but indifferent about the rest of the game, and 3) this game will probably not influence me as a person or the choices I make.

I won't say the game is [i] bad [/i] but I really don't feel like the experience was worthwhile, considering not only the cost, which I believe is quite fair, but also the time invested in it.

If you really like point-and-click games, I do think you'll probably enjoy this game, but if you're just a casual player, I wouldn't really recommend this game to you.",1607034151,1607034151,False,5,0,0.579904794692993164,5,True,False,False,False,,1607039756,"Sorry to hear about the frustrating experience! At the outset, I should say: a game developer's responsibility is to entertain players, who have invested their money and time (as you note) but also their hopes in the game. If the player isn't entertained, the developer hasn't just failed, he's broken an unspoken promise between him and the player:  ""If you will reward the work and love I put into my game with your enthusiasm and money, I will reward your enthusiasm and money with the entertainment my game offers.""  

Every time I hear from a disappointed player, it is a great disappointment for me, as well.  But it is particularly disappointing when the shortcomings in one aspect of the game block a player's enjoyment of some other aspect of the game.  In that instance, it's not just a broken promise, but a missed opportunity -- it's clear Primordia *could* have been a game you enjoyed, but sadly wasn't.

Whenever a player is disappointed, I always ask (small recompense) whether the player would be interested in one of the various games I've backed (either on Kickstarter or charity bundles) over the years, since I never have time to play them myself and thus have an endless backlog of keys.  If you'd be interested, let me know.

As for your specific comments, these flaws are, to some extent, inherent to the genre. Unless puzzles are made trivially easy, the seem to turn *very heavily* on a ""flash of insight.""  Some players' minds (perhaps simply from playing a lot of such games) turn out to be aligned with the designers' minds, so puzzles seem logical, reasonable, and straightforward.  But the exact same puzzles can seem obtuse, unfair, and convoluted to other players.  Primordia gets a number of reviews praising how rigorously logical its puzzles are, and a number of reviews criticizing its puzzles for having no logic at all.  I'm not sure either review is right; the puzzles are logical enough in my mind, but my mind is subject to preconceptions, biases, blindspots, etc.  The puzzles are not logical in a formal sense; they are conventional, and the question is whether the player has the same conventions I do.  If I were a better designer, I probably would be able to find a way to teach those conventions to players unfamiliar with them -- but even with a How To Play description, automated hints, hints you can solicit, and ""wrong answer"" quips designed to steer players toward the right answer, it's clear that Primordia falls short for plenty of folks like you.  I'm sorry for that, especially because it seemed like you might have liked the game if I could've designed it better!"

It's a short game although the obscurity of some of the puzzles/achievements can make it longer. But the world building is pretty phenomenal. The characters are great and you immediately love them rust and all. Multiple endings are available, some obvious and some hidden away. I admit to using a guide occasionally. Now there's a BEAUTIFUL hint system built in where if you talk to Crispin he'll sometimes give vague allusions to what you need to do or where you might need to look to find an item to solve a puzzle. Say things like ""Hey didn't we see a _____ earlier?"" or ""Maybe we could do something with X?"" But I'm not the sharpest crayon in the box and I was fairly new to the point and click genre so I missed some things and sometimes the hints went over my head. He'd say ""Maybe we should check around the Junkyard"" and I went ""I did though!"" not realizing where in the junkyard or with what item I needed to be looking. Looked at the guide and went, ""Oh. Why didn't I try that?"" The achievements though I really NEEDED a guide.

En segundo lugar, si a√∫n tienes el juego, definitivamente puedes cambiar la resoluci√≥n de dos maneras. Primero, en el men√∫ Opciones, una vez que inicias el juego, hay una opci√≥n para alternar entre el modo Ventana y Pantalla completa. En segundo lugar, en la carpeta donde tiene instalado Primordia, hay un programa llamado WinSetup.exe que puede ejecutar para cambiar la configuraci√≥n.

Por supuesto, Primordia es un juego de baja resoluci√≥n (320x200x256): 1985 es una exageraci√≥n, pero es consistente con los gr√°ficos de principios de la d√©cada de 1990. Lo hicimos porque esos juegos de aventuras fueron con los que crecimos y siempre quisimos hacer. Y cuando lanzamos el juego en 2012, los monitores de pantalla ancha enormes eran menos comunes. Estoy de acuerdo con usted en que, en la configuraci√≥n predeterminada, se ve terrible en un monitor de pantalla ancha grande. Me complace trabajar con usted para encontrar la configuraci√≥n para que se vea lo mejor posible.

En cuanto a un reembolso, deber√≠a poder obtener uno a trav√©s de Steam dado que solo ha jugado durante .4 horas. Pero si no puede, POR FAVOR, h√°gamelo saber en Steam o env√≠eme un correo electr√≥nico a mark @ wormwoodstudios.com.

Taking control of Horatio, a stranded robot just living out his life with his sidekick Crispin in a crash-landed ship, you find yourself getting robbed of the only power source of your home by a murderous robot. In order to survive and take back what's yours, Horatio and Crispin venture out into the unknown to recover the precious power core, using any and all salvage, scrap, and determination they can find. Who knows what awaits them in the Dunes, or worse.

Primordia is a fantastic story driven game. It was the one thing that kept me going whenever I got stumped by one of its many puzzles. A very cool factor is that most puzzles can have multiple outcomes, determining on what items you use, characters that help you, and all together choices you make. The ability to make friends or enemies depends on you. And speaking of friends, the characters, along with the whole world, are expertly designed and especially memorable. Each conversation is uniquely voiced out and each robot has their own traits that make them important and interesting. It was always fun to talk to every robot that came across my path, even when some just sounded like a corrupted printer from two decades ago. Pair that up with the bleak and vast world of the Dunes and Metropol, and it's a perfect match that kept me engaged to explore every pixel of this game.

The puzzles are equally interesting. You got your usual point and click style to solving these puzzles with using items, combining several items, destroying and creating certain items using tools, etc. Each puzzle is unique and as said before, can have different outcomes depending who or what you use. [spoiler]This is especially important on the multiple endings[/spoiler].

Primordia is a high quality, addictive point 'n' click adventure I wish I tried out sooner! The game has an intriguing story, a likable protagonist, plot twists galore, multiple endings and professional voice acting. It's also accessible for newcomers and veterans to adventure games alike, thanks to logical puzzles, alternate solutions, a lack of dead-ends and an in-built hints system (i.e. your sidekick Crispin). There's not much I can fault about this game except maybe they could've gone more wild with the colour palette, but it's a post-apocalyptic adventure after all, and robots probably don't care much for that sort of stuff, hey?

Some carry the mental ""genes"" of their creators; others don't even know what humans were. 

There are no humans in Primordia. They have long since disappeared. The new age has come and gone. And while the robots are the best possible version of themselves in a way, the world is just as broken and mistreated as it is today.

Primordia is an exceptionally good experience which I recommend to all people who have at least a bit of those little grey cells Monsieur Poirot keeps talking about in the Agatha Christie stories.

Also recommended for fans of the cyberpunk genre - you will see some familiar ideas and ideals in Primordia, as well as depictions of great robots and small ones. 

This is one of the top cyberpunk games in the 2010s without a doubt.

An awesome little game wraped up in a very classic style click and point adventure. The hero (Horatio Nullbuilt) and his humorous sidekick Crispin Horatiobuilt (you get the surnames, I reckon) is on his search for his stolen power core he needs badly for his aircraft. What begins as a simple story after a stolen item opens up fast in global and somewhat transcendental. It asks some philosophical questions without being way to out of line or focus-lost. Most puzzles are logical and there are even some allowing for different solutions. The inventory keeps sorted and won't overstuffs. There are no wild and irrational item-combinations. There's just one puzzle that gets heavy on your brainpower. Crispin with his humorous remarks gets in perfect contrast with the highly focused and rational Horatio and the pretty dense and gritty atmosphere of this game. There are some easter eggs like some trader is offering you a water chip for a G.E.C.K. The voice-acting is top-notch for an indie-game and the art-design is just beautiful. Beware of low resolution (640x480), though.

The plot thickens the further you progress and it won't loose itself within numerous sideplots distracting you from your goal. So it's rather fast paced and do favors my preferences regarding story-telling. There are different endings for the plot and those endings aren't simple button pushers (Deus Ex: HR, Far Cry 3, etc.). Some are pretty easy to achieve while others require aditional brainpower and are rather inconspicuous. So you'll probably achieve a different ending than your buddy because there are many actions you probably do instinctively causing different endings.

I honestly don't find anything I dislike on this game so I highly recommend it to any adventure-fan.",1600017038,1600017038,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1600018587,Thanks so much for the thorough and kind assessment!

The interface is well done, and the design of the game removes many of the tedious elements of typical point-and-click adventures.

oh and the endings. Feels like each ending the game offers could start a grand new story to be told.
Like when  [spoiler] horatio jumped off the tower [/spoiler] i didn't feel like it ended, it felt like they story could go on. 
like [spoiler] factor could wake up and take horatio to its care and begin taking over the city forcing horatio to choose sides or something like that [/spoiler]  
and when [spoiler] horatio got the ship running [/spoiler] i thought i was going to see an epilouge chapter and was so bitter that i saw the credits roll. 
i wish that maybe the company will try to create a sequel or a new game based on the same universe.

I always wanted to fly.

The setting is a dystopian world, where no humans survive and only their robotic creations (and their robots' robotic creations) are left.

It's a unique world, fully fleshed out with appropriate backstory and leaves you longing for more.

The characters are amazing, especially the protagonist and his sidekick. I love their banter and the way they care for each other. Brilliant voice-acting makes the characters come alive.

The puzzles are clever, but not too difficult. There's a little bit of pixel hunting involved, however. And the terminal puzzle can be difficult for some.

The game opens with two robots under a turbulent sky, in front of a ridiculously ornate telescope. I thought a post-post-apolcalyptic setting would be dark and drab, and there is a lot of brown, but the quality of the art means every panel is beautiful regardless. The voice acting is excellent as well, and as such the game immediately displays the care which went into it's production.

While the point-and-click gameplay is fun and well-done, the writing is perfect. It's a fun conspiracy story but also manages to ask deep questions about the purpose of religion. Does religion need to be true to be useful? Who knows but I enjoyed the way the game asks the questions.

I haven't finished the game yet, but the 4 hours I have so far have been some of the most enjoyable P&C I've played.

But when comes to the later half (reaching Metropol) it become a completely different game : The story telling become information dumping and most of it unrelated to the current gameplay, the puzzles are illogical and awful (eg: you need to type in specific words in computer to progress, or rearrange about 10 arrays of codes without rule, or password hint given is in between 2~199 you have to try each possible number) you have to watch guide to figure it out.

Probably it was just on the steam queue, promoting post-apocalyptic games for me? I really can't say for sure at this moment.

Let's, however, try to think on what makes a story good:
‚Äî Storyline
‚Äî Characters
‚Äî Style
‚Äî Theme
If all these parts are actually present and show thoughtful work on them, it's at least worth your attention.
But hey, it's a game, isn't it? Well... I've never really looked upon P&C adventures as full-fledged games. Sure, they're more complicated than visual novels (which clearly aren't games), but the gameplay is all about some puzzles. At worse times, it's about ""use everything on everything"" ‚Äî and yes, sometimes the game felt like it, but maybe it's because I hardly ever play these games.

So, what do we have here? A short game set in a post-apocalyptic world. With engaging story, which is not too long and not too short. A solid one, I'd say, with a strong, prominent theme that we gradually come to realise with the small pieces we find.
The art is great, contributing a lot to the mood of the whole game. Can't forget to mention always breathtaking Logan on VA. Man just can't do a non-fantastic job at it, can he? That, of course, doesn't mean other voice actors didn't do a great job. I believe I can still recall Ever-Faithful and Crispin even now, years after I played it. Even the song we can play at the ship did catch my attention for a couple days.
What I also love is a seemingly highly-detailed world with little of it shown. I love when a story makes an impression of an enormous history and worldbuilding, but doesn't tell you much, leaving most of it to your imagination. The whole fact that you actually wonder what happened here and there, off-scene, means the author made a great job.

However, I need to say that it has flaws: namely, the endings. You don't have to work much for them, because decisions for them are made in the very end, so you basically don't feel like you've worked for them at all. I get it, more story branching requires more work, and most people who finish the game once probably won't even roll back and try it differently. But then again, I think it could be just a little bit expanded. But well, I'm not the dev of this game.

Overall, I think it's worth that little time it takes to complete the game. Especially when it's so cheap even without a discount.",1593367661,1593367661,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1593372813,"Thanks for the thorough and thoughtful review!  I was especially glad to hear how much you liked Dreams of Green (the song in the ship), which was my effort at paying homage to two very different things (the poetry of my great aunt, whose poem ""The Inheritors"" inspired the overall theme of the game, and whose poem ""Mimosa Tree"" is where the ""dreams of green"" comes from, though also from Lorca's ""Romance Son√°mbulo"").

Regarding the endings:

[spoiler]What you say is a fair point, although I think it's an example of how the marketing of a game (or achievements within a game) can distort the game's content.  ""EIGHT DIFFERENT ENDINGS!"" is something that Wadjet Eye mentions a lot when marketing our game, and many reviewers praise it, but the reality is -- as you note -- they depend mostly on what you do in the end game, not on a pile-up of earlier decisions throughout (which are tracked in a more modest way, determining which robots help rebuild the UNNIIC).

These were not intended to give reactivity comparable to a game like The Age of Decadence (one of my favorite RPGs) or The Mask of the Betrayer (another favorite).  Instead, the choice at the ending is meant to be the player's opportunity to give meaning to the story up to that point.  Is Horatio's journey a futile one?  Has he succeeded in overcoming the hatred and destructiveness hard-coded into him, or reverted back to it?  Has MetroMind persuaded him, or repulsed him?  Does he want to die fighting, or reenact HORUS's self-annihilating refusal to fight, or what?  All of those, to me, are legitimate places for Horatio to end up, and different ways to interpret the story up to that point.  (Is it a revenge story or a story of renouncing violence?  Who was right in the debates?)

I have a completionist streak myself, so I was realistic in expecting players to just reload and get every ending.  But my hope was still that each player would have his or her own ""best"" ending, the one to them made the most sense and gave the most meaning to Horatio and Primordia as a whole.

My memories of the game may be off, like needing a refresh, but still I will keep stating that it is one of the best point-and-clicks I have played.

First you need to look at the graphics. The pixel art visual on this one is simples outstanding, having a feeling of an old game on modern times and bringing perfectly the cyberpunk theme to life. Everything so gloomy, melancholic and robotic. This alone made me go after the game.

The story is also very nice, especially the dialogs and the interaction between the main characters. I just didn‚Äôt like much the ending. The game has tons of endings and I watched all of them. Some are pretty good, others not so much, and I first got one of the bad ones, not like in bad ending like in a light novel. Bad as in something I don‚Äôt like. So it was kind of my fault plus my on taste interfering.

As for the gameplay, basic point and click stuff. And yes, you can be stuck in this game. Not by bugs and such, but by not understanding how to advance. I think it‚Äôs not particularly the easiest game on the genre, but still worth playing. Also, be in mind that this will be a very short game.

With all that said, I still recommend Primordia. I loved this game, even with my complains, and I hope you like it as well.

The writing and story are where this game excels, surprisingly so. Playing this game is akin to reading a good book. Elements of religion and philosophy are all the more enjoyable amongst the backdrop of a world without humans; where machines like protagonist Horatio Nullbuilt can only ponder their existence. The world feels fresh, and though I am a novice at the point-and-click games, it still managed to drag me in with compelling and exciting writing.

This is not an easy game, but note that you cannot die.  Some situations are very hard to decipher, and I ended up using a walkthrough for a couple parts because I didn't see some pixel-hunting items or areas (they are not always visually contrasted like in most games).

I really liked that you had multiple ways to get through certain puzzles.  I ended up getting the best ending because I did something good earlier in the game to get a necessary item to achieve that.  So save often, although the game is worth replaying if you don't.

My main gripe was the data unit, the screen is tiny and you sometimes have to hit the down arrow to scroll through pages of text one line at a time.

Hats off to Wormwood for developing this one. 

Biggest reason to play Primordia - atmosphere and very well written characters. Post-apocalyptic, unhabitable world where only robots remains and human existence is remembered (and revered) only by an obscure religion is a fantastic tone setter that hooks you right into the plot, and characters met along the way keep you engaged in the story to the very end. To the question of ""the best character in this game?"" I could easily answer ""everyone"" and that would be a very defendable stance, but I will give a final nod to our main duo - Protagonist Horatio and his floating sidekick Crispin. Their personalities seems typical (serious, matter-of-fact, a little bit stiff Horatio and energetic, snarky and sarcastic Crispin) for a duet, but the writing level mentioned above gives a fantastic dynamic between them, which leads to a plethora of genuinely funny dialogs. Not often can a work of fiction score a genuine laugh from me this days, but Primordia succeeded on more than one occasion.

This one is much shorter than many of other WE published games, but it actually does have some replay value, as you can approach puzzles in several way, and they can have interesting consequences, up to unlocking two additional endings.

Edit: Got it! The engine all of these games use (AGS) is a little creaky. We recently updated Primordia to the newest version of AGS, which is probably why it worked but Gemini Rue didn‚Äôt. My guess is that Unavowed might work as well (it‚Äôs WEG‚Äôs latest) but you will likely have glitches in the older ones.

[i]Primordia[/i] nous invite dans un monde post-apo dans lequel les robots, d√©barrass√©s de la pr√©sence humaine, se retrouvent malgr√© tout confront√©s aux m√™mes probl√®mes que notre soci√©t√© r√©elle. Si l'Homme est devenu un mythe, le besoin d'√©nergie, la recherche du bonheur et le souci de justice √©quitable reste une pr√©occupation. C'est ainsi qu'Horatio et Crispin se rendent en ville suite au vol de leur pr√©cieux cristal.



[b][u]J'ai aim√©[/u] : [/b]

[b]+++ l'histoire : [/b]Si elle n'est au d√©part une traditionnelle aventure motiv√©e par une qu√™te, elle devient de plus en plus int√©ressante √† mesure que l'intrigue progresse et le tout est surtout bien √©crit. 

[b]+++ la profondeur : [/b]Les th√©matiques abord√©es sont s√©rieuses et actuelles et le destin des robots de Metropol est naturellement une belle m√©taphore de notre soci√©t√© humaine.

[b]+++ l'univers du jeu : [/b]Un ensemble coh√©rent et la possibilit√© d'en apprendre pas mal sur le pass√© si on se donne un peu la peine de chercher, par exemple dans le terminal d'information.

[b]++ le style : [/b]La DA est tr√®s sympathique avec un style visuel tr√®s attractif (malgr√© les pixels) et une bande sonore bien agr√©able.

[b]++ les dialogues : [/b]Nombreux et autorisant des choix vari√©s.

[b]++ l'humour : [/b]Il est fin et subtil et le duo compos√© d'Horatio et Crispin fonctionne particuli√®rement bien dans ce domaine.

[b]++ les personnages : [/b]Une jolie galerie de pnj qui ont chacun leur personnalit√© bien affirm√©e.

[b]++ le gameplay : [/b]Il est certes tr√®s classique sur bien des points (inventaire, carte, action, √©nigmes) mais am√®ne r√©guli√®rement quelques petites surprises davantage originales tout en restant toujours parfaitement intuitif.

[b]++ les √©nigmes : [/b]Les puzzles sont bien int√©gr√©s dans l'univers du jeu et son gameplay mais la logique est surtout √† chercher dans l'histoire, ce qui donne un ensemble pertinent et coh√©rent.

[b]++ les diff√©rentes fins : [/b]Le sc√©nario poss√®de des embranchements qui proposent plusieurs mani√®res de r√©soudre certains probl√®mes et permet d'aboutir √† des fins assez diff√©rentes.

[b]++ bonne dur√©e de vie : [/b]Non seulement on peut compter sur une certaine rejouabilit√© pour tester quelques variantes mais on peut aussi consid√©rer que la relative difficult√© peur aussi prolonger le temps consacr√© au jeu.

[b]+ les doublages : [/b]Uniquement en anglais mais de qualit√©, ce qui contribue bien √† l'ambiance.

[b]+ l'aide int√©gr√©e : [/b]Pour les joueurs les moins perspicaces ou peu concentr√©s, il y a la possibilit√© d'obtenir subtilement quelques coups de pouce sans quitter le jeu pour chercher une solution compl√®te sur le net.

[b]+ la traduction FR :  [/b]Toujours agr√©able de disposer d'une traduction FR, surtout qu'elle fait au mieux pour retranscrire les nombreux jeux de mots de la VO.



[b][u]J'ai moins aim√©[/u] : [/b]

[b]- les graphismes : [/b]Ils sont naturellement tr√®s pixelis√©s mais s'ils restent parfaitement ad√©quats dans le d√©cor, en ce qui concerne l'apparence des h√©ros, il vous faudra certainement passer par les fichiers locaux et quelques manipulations conseill√©es pour modifier certains param√®tres pour obtenir quelque chose de visuellement plus agr√©able.

[b]- la lenteur : [/b]Si elle fait pleinement partie de l'ambiance, la lenteur devient parfois un peu p√©nible lors de quelques s√©quences, ...surtout dans les moments o√π on tourne un peu en rond.

[b]- le choix secret : [/b]Tr√®s t√¥t dans le jeu, une action qui semble parfaitement anodine peut avoir en r√©alit√© un impact significatif sur la suite de l'intrigue et notre pleine compr√©hension de l'histoire. En v√©rit√©,  si on a pas rejou√© et test√© un peu par hasard les deux variantes, on ne le d√©couvre qu'en se renseignant un peu sur le jeu.

[b]- la formulation des √©nigmes : [/b]Elle peut √™tre ambigu√´, notamment pour la 2√®me question de Cornelius et Oswald, ce qui peut provoquer des √©checs un peu injustes.



[b][u]En bref[/u] : [/b]

Un [i]point&click[/i] qui excelle dans bien des domaines et qui sait s√©duire par son ambiance, son univers, son histoire, ses personnages, son humour mais √©galement par les th√®mes abord√©s.

A conseiller aux amateurs du genre, en particulier ceux qui aiment le style [i]old school[/i] et qui ne sont pas contrari√©s par les gros pixels.


J'ai bien aim√©, je recommande.

It was the perfect length too; after the 'END' or what felt like the end I was worried I'd be sent on more errands but this was not the case.

The story was intriguing and beautiful. Such a good worldbuilding and deep lore. The artstyle is amazing, I absolutely loved every single location, the details of the environment were so good, and the sepia tones perfectly gave the idea of the atmosphere. Especially metropol, the apartments and roads in the background were so detailed and cool. Seriously, the art is the absolute best part of this game, so pleasing to watch. 
I really loved the lore behind it, how you learn bit by bit about the game's world, the robots and what happened to humans. I like how even when they dont tell something, they still give a good reason behind it, for example [spoiler]when you learn about the war that caused humans death, but you don't get to know why humans were at war, and it is told you its because the robots remained intact weren't built for war or did not have data on the war, which makes sense.
I gotta say, the ending that struck me the most was Horatio jumping from the tower, committing suicide cause he had no other options. Like, that ending got me emotional. This whole game can make you emotional, but that ending, god, it got me so much,, I still cant get over it. Tho my fvorite ending is ""too much power"", where you blackmail metromind into letting you go home with the power core. The final monologue Horatio gives, talking about the destruction Metromind will bring upon her city, as well as knowing he's now alone, with no friends, left to witness the downfall of robots, is just so powerful. Really gets me.
[/spoiler].

I loved the puzzles, some of them were very thought-out, for example the questions the two robots ask you in front of the court, or the code for the tower door. I love puzzles that require reasoning and I gotta say these two were a good challenge. I wish there were more like those, tho. Its a pity they didnt put more, but I guess its fine considering how much effort they put in for the rest of the game in general, it was still very enjoyable nonetheless. 
I like how actions you do at the beginning of the game can determine the choices of endings you get at the end. A bit frustrating, but nice.
Also, gotta say I loved the memento Moribuild little ""sidequest"". took me a little to figure out the solution, but it was pretty cool designed, loved doing it.

I really like the variety of endings that we are given, its nice to see the different outcomes, even tho some are less cured and detailed than others, and feel a bit cheaper and emptier. But the main endings are very well made. This whole game makes you think so much.

I liked this game very much, it was a beautiful experience, and a rollercoaster of emotions. I kinda wish the characters interactions were more thought-out, tho, cause the current ones didn't give me much. I didn't really feel any connection with clarity, she seemed very ""cold"", it felt like talking to an object every time I talked to her. The only one you can kinda feel the connection with is Crispin. I just wish you could get deep into knowing better more of the characters. Like the little lamp robot that Crispin likes, wish they did more with her, instead it feels she's just there for the achievement. 
I just overall wish there was more depth to characters interactions.
(Also I lowkey wish you could enter the door near the info terminal, like, that door has been bothering me for the entire game, you can knock but can never enter? Idk I just wish they made it ""enter-able"", and make it be a hotel room or something. I just like interacting with the environment in point and click games, so I wish there were  more environmental things to interact with.

But yeah overall it was a beautiful experience, totally worth the money, I had a really good time (and to be honest, this game has a deeper and more thought out lore and worldbuilding than most sci-fi movies or games out there. I lowkey would love a movie/tv series/ cartoon based on primordia lol)",1591551286,1591551826,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1591552871,"Thank you so much for the long, and lovely, review!

I'm going to cut straight to the point.

This is the best point-and-click game I've played.  I haven't played a ton, so perhaps that's not saying much, but I think this game is much more than the sum of its parts, where each of those parts is masterfully crafted in their own right.

Feel free to read the rest of my thoughts below if you want more than a TL;DR.

[h1] Characters and Dialogue [/h1] 

The characters and the dialog are the apotheosis of Primordia.

I was shocked at how well done the characterizations of Horatio and his sidekick were (I'm desensitized to the kind of characters you find in most modern games, after all).  They are congruent in their beliefs and behavior most of the time while allowing for slight deviations and quirks when the situation calls for it.  In other words, they are not flat, two-dimensional characters that serve as cliches or archetypes or devices to allow for the advancement of the plot.  They feel real and alive, and it might fly under the radar at first glance because of the subtlety with which it is implemented.

Horatio and Crispin may be the highlights of the game since they are the main characters, but that does not mean that the rest of the characters you can interact with in the game were sort of swept under the rug as an afterthought.  No, each of them has their own distinct personality and motivations as well, and none of them, in my opinion, are overdone, underdone, obnoxious, or boring.  I enjoyed interacting with all of them and their dialogue never overstayed its welcome, which brings me to my next point.

The writing in this game is smart, witty, and entertaining.  It's a pleasure to read, it's immersive, and you look forward to the next exchange of words between characters.  This is the hallmark of good writing - when you're able to savor the text and voice acting instead of skimming and quickly clicking through to get to the next exciting plot point.

And it's genuinely funny at times.  I have an obscure sense of humor and it takes a lot to make me go from not cracking a smile to a slight smirk.  But this game did it.  Some of the absurd stuff Horatio, Crispin, and other characters would say to each other was so well done.  If sentient machines with personalities had a great sense of humor, this would be it.  It pays a nice homage to people who have dealt with computer programming as well (Horatio, at one point, sarcastically compares something unfavorable Crispin suggests  with having unbalanced parentheses somewhere inside of him).  This programming humor has the potential to be unfunny and cringe-worthy as it usually is in your typical office space or classroom, but the delivery was smooth and self-aware enough to make it work.

[h1] Art [/h1] 

If you're reading this review, you already know what the art looks like.  Yes, it's heavily pixelated and low resolution.  But of course, that's part of the aesthetic.  I couldn't really imagine Primordia being a game with high resolution artwork and animations.  It just wouldn't be the same.  I wouldn't like it as much.  The way it's done is perfect for the atmosphere and setting, I think, and I wouldn't change a thing.  If you like this retro, low-resolution aesthetic, it's all the more reason to buy the game.

A few times throughout the experience, you view higher-resolution cut scenes at important moments.  It's a pretty large contrast to the pixelated art you're used to seeing, and when you come across these cut scenes, they seem magical and intriguing because you get to see what the characters really look like.  It reminds me of  the contrast between looking underwater with and without goggles.  Both are cool in their own right, but the comparison our brain makes between the two perceptions is where the wonder exists.

[h1] Story [/h1] 

The story of Primordia was unorthodox and interesting.  Perhaps not groundbreaking or original on all fronts, but well developed enough to warrant a playthrough even if the character and dialogue features described above were toned down a few notches.

My favorite part about it is that it's stripped of the extraneous to the extent to where you don't get bogged down in the details and can just enjoy the plot as it unfolds.

It's not very self-revealing until towards the end, where you encounter the truth and a few twists along the way.  The story of Horatio was hinted at a few times earlier in the game, but the way it was fleshed out at the end was a satisfying and cathartic ending to a journey of self-discovery and knowledge.

Two of the endings were very good.  The rest were ok.  I recommend you save at a certain point in the game where you're given the option to [spoiler]think about your final decision[/spoiler] and reload it to get the rest of the endings.

[h1] Puzzles [/h1] 

The gameplay of Primordia is centered around its puzzle mechanics.  You cannot progress forward until you solve them.

The solutions to the puzzles require creativity, backtracking, and odd combinations.

Unless you want to spend a lot of time exhausting all possible options, you may want to use a guide at some points, because a few of the puzzles were so non-trivial that it was hard to find a lead on where to even start or gain a hint from short of wandering around and trying random things.  When I consulted a guide to find out what to do at a few places, I was like ""How was I supposed to come to this conclusion?""  In some places, it's like you need preconceived knowledge to move forward.  I'd like to think I'm not a dumbass, but maybe I am, and maybe you will have an easier time.

That said, I'd prefer the difficulty of these puzzles over having boring and generic ones.  If you like problem solving in the context of an interesting plot and likeable characters, well, here is your game.

[h1] Primordia [/h1] 

I've tried to break this game down into its constituent components so you can more easily evaluate the game.  However, the experience of Primordia, like I said at the beginning of the review and like all good creative works should be, is more than the sum of its parts.  So don't take everything at face value.

You'd have to play it to know what I mean, and I cannot recommend you do so highly enough, especially if you're a fan of point and clicks, non-obvious puzzles, sci-fi, or just entertaining characters and dialogue.

Other games in the same genre will have to step up their ingenuity if they want to compete with these developers and writers.  This game is highly deserving of its overwhelmingly positive reviews.

Looking forward to what they put out next.",1590351629,1590355825,True,53,2,0.840588390827178955,7,True,False,False,False,,1590360028,"Thank you for this generous review -- generous in its judgment of the game, and generous in the amount of time and effort that plainly went into writing it.

Mas o interessante √© que voc√™ realmente tente resolver tudo sozinho, sem olhar videos e outras fontes.

Gameplay is what you would expect; a standard Wadjet Eye Point&Click. Like most, you may find yourself dealing with a small handful of contrived situations.

I was just discouraged earlier on, to find that the thing I was doing was indeed correct, It's just I had to do it in a specific order or click on the correct thing (eye roll). Out of mild frustration or maybe just being lazy I used a walk-through for some of the more cryptic puzzles, in hindsight I would have had more fun if I made an effort to figure them out.

Regarding a high-res version... While redoing the backgrounds in a higher resolution would be relatively easy, animating the characters would be quite hard -- we'd need to not only have higher resolution sprites, but also more frames of animation because of the higher resolution, otherwise the animation looks choppy (the Secret of Monkey Island remake demonstrates this problem, IMO). Also, while the backgrounds were penciled and then digitally painted (and thus stylistically amendable to higher resolution), the sprites for the most part were pixel art from the outset. To make them work a truly high resolution would require a stylistic shift (again, the MI remake is a pretty good example of this).

Ultimately, we'd rather spend our limited time on new projects, and use what time we spend on Primordia supporting and patching the existing game to make sure it offers the best experience to current users."

The characters--their scripting, their voices, their personalities--whether major or minor are all interesting and likeable, if not full-blown intriguing.

The story, told in bits and pieces (with mostly unreliable narrators) is fantastic and the environmental vibe of post-apocalyptic robot-only living is really cool. I never had to look up any walkthroughs (which is common for me with point-and-clicks) because I could always click on my lil sidekick for good hints. No puzzles were drawn-out or unpleasantly grindy. I was very happy with the level of detail, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring entire dialogue trees with everything that was interactive.

Ez egy ilyen szerelem els≈ë l√°t√°sra volt sz√°momra, a Primordia vizu√°lisan val√≥sz√≠n≈±leg nehezen befogadhat√≥ lesz azoknak, akik √≥dzkodnak a pixelgrafik√°t√≥l, √°m sz√°momra ez a fajta retro k√ºlcs√≠n nem csak, hogy egy irgalmatlan nosztalgiabomba, ami m√©g az alacsony felbont√°s ellen√©re is k√©pes volt irgalmatlanul beh√∫zni a maga porlepte, rozsd√°s kis vil√°g√°ba. Csup√°n 2 k√©ptal√°lat azonnal meggy≈ëz√∂tt arr√≥l, hogy a j√°t√©k nekem val√≥. 
A kopottas sz√≠nei, a lepusztult vil√°gk√©pe nem kicsit eml√©keztet a D≈±ne vil√°g√°ra, melyet a Gigeri biomechanikus forma√°br√°zol√°s tov√°bb boostolt. √ìri√°s, h√°trahagyott monolitikus robottestek a sivatag homokj√°ban, g√©ptemet≈ëk, g√©pv√°rosok √∂r√∂k√∂s narancsos f√©lhom√°lyban √©s az organikus l√©tform√°k gyakorlatilag teljes hi√°nya. A bolyg√≥ egy homokba fulladt roncstelep, csup√°n egyes roncsok m√©g mozognak, k√ºszk√∂dnek a t√∫l√©l√©s√©rt √©s ami enn√©l is √©rdekesebb: megvan a saj√°t hitvil√°guk.
A Primordia bizony teljes m√©rt√©kben a G√©pek kor√°ban j√°tsz√≥dik. A j√°t√©k egy poszt-hum√°n vil√°gba kalauzol benn√ºnket, ahol az emberis√©g utols√≥ marad√©ka is m√°r gener√°ci√≥kkal ezel≈ëtt elpusztult, s az √°ltaluk k√©sz√≠tett robotok √∂r√∂k√∂lt√©k meg a f√∂ldet. 
Kifejezetten tetszett, ahogy a t√∂rt√©net egy √∫jfajta szemsz√∂gb≈ël k√∂zel√≠tette meg az am√∫gy t√∂bbsz√∂r is l√°tott alapfel√°ll√°st. Itt nem az √∂ntudatra √©bredt gonosz robotokat kapjuk, akik leig√°zt√°k az emberi fajt, hanem egyszer≈±en: a g√©peket, akik egyed√ºl maradtak n√©lk√ºl√ºnk √©s pr√≥b√°lnak valahogy fennmaradni a saj√°t szubrutinjaikba √°gyazott elvrendszereik alapj√°n. 

A g√©pek k√∂z√∂tt is megoszt√≥ eszm√©k alakultak ki, egyes robotok humanistak√©nt, egyfajta idealiz√°lt Istenszerepbe helyezve a let≈±nt emberi fajt, mint Alkot√≥jukat, pr√≥b√°lj√°k √©lni az √©let√ºket, kutatva csod√°latos l√©trehoz√≥ik ut√°n, m√≠g m√°s g√©pek elvetve az Embernek m√©g csak az eml√©k√©t is, √∂n√°ll√≥s√°gra t√∂rekedve pr√≥b√°lnak tov√°bbl√©pni √©s a g√©pi f√ºggetlens√©get el≈ëmozd√≠tva igyekeznek biztos√≠tani a mesters√©ges intelligencia fennmarad√°s√°t. 

H≈ës√ºnk, Horatio Nullbuilt v5 egy humanista, mag√°nyosan √©l a sivatagban, folyamatosan jav√≠tgatva egy kis ≈±rhaj√≥t t√°rs√°val, egy Crispin Horatiobuilt v1 nevezet≈± lebeg≈ë robottal, akit nev√©b≈ël ad√≥d√≥an ≈ë √©p√≠tett.
Horatio nem egy kalandv√°gy√≥ karakter, egy√°ltal√°n nem h≈ës t√≠pus, nem akarja az eszm√©j√©t sem terjeszteni, nem akar semmit, csak megjav√≠tani a lakhely√©√ºl szolg√°l√≥ haj√≥t. √Åm a t√∂rt√©net elej√©n egy Scraper nevezet≈± robot eltulajdon√≠tja a power core-j√°t, √≠gy k√©nytelen annak ut√°naeredni √©s egy j√≥val nagyobb konfliktus k√∂z√©ppontj√°v√° v√°lni. 

A Primordia... retro vizu√°lja mellett sz√°momra a dial√≥gusokban cs√∫csosodik ki igaz√°n. Nem csak a Horatio √©s Crispin k√∂z√∂tt lezajl√≥ humoros √©s gyakran vit√°ba csap√≥ p√°rbesz√©dek rendk√≠v√ºl sz√≥rakoztat√≥ak, de ugyanakkor az elt√©r≈ë n√©zeteket vall√≥ g√©pek k√∂zti m√°r-m√°r vall√°sos √©rtekez√©sek is kifejezetten sokat hozz√°adnak az √°br√°zolt vil√°gk√©p mili≈ëj√©hez. M√≠g Horatio idealiz√°lja a teremt≈ëit √©s pr√≥b√°lja elford√≠tani a fej√©t azokr√≥l a t√©nyekr≈ël, melyek mind az emberis√©g cs√∫fos v√©g√©nek k√∂r√ºlm√©nyeir≈ël sz√≥lnak, m√°s g√©pek ink√°bb egy j√≥val kollektiviz√°ltabb √©s egys√©gesebb robot-t√°rsadalomr√≥l √°lmodoznak, elvetve az embert, mint alkot√≥t, gy√°rt√≥t, l√©trehoz√≥t. Merth√°t, ahogy ez egy √∂r√∂k vitak√©rd√©s a j√°t√©k robotjai sz√°m√°ra... ki is az alkot√≥? Az ember, aki megtervezte a g√©pet... vagy az ember, aki √∂sszerakta a g√©pet? Vagy nincs is sz√ºks√©g ezt elismerni, hiszen mindannyian saj√°t tudatukn√°l l√©v≈ë indiv√≠dumok m√°r, de igaz√°b√≥l ez is probl√©ma, hiszen a g√©peknek nem f√ºggetlenedni√ºk kellene, hanem egyes√ºlni egyetlen rendszerben, vallja azt a helyi f≈ëgonosz.

A Primordia antagonist√°ja egy Metromindnak nevezett mesters√©ges intelligencia, aki azon igyekszik, hogy Metropol v√°ros megmaradt g√©peit kiv√©tel n√©lk√ºl uralma al√° vonja, egyfajta kollekt√≠v tudatt√° √∂sszegy√∫rva a t√∫l√©l≈ë robotokat. 
A j√°t√©k leg√©rdekesebb aspektusai mindenbizonnyal a vil√°g√©p√≠t√©sben rejlenek, abban, ahogy fel√©p√≠tette robot t√°rsadalm√°t √©s prezent√°lja azok int√©zm√©nyes√≠tett rendszereit. Robotrend≈ërs√©g, robotb√≠r√≥s√°g, robotkorm√°nyzat, mind-mind alaposan bemutatva a dial√≥gusokon kereszt√ºl, gyakran alapos humorral √°titatva. 
Emellett persze a Primordia alapjaiban egy s√∂t√©t vil√°g√∫, melankolikus hangv√©tel≈± j√°t√©k, de valahogy sosem cs√∫szik √°t teljesen komorba, h√°la Crispin t√∫lvez√©relt szarkazmus√°nak, aki a legrosszabb szitu√°ci√≥kban is igyekszik bedobni egy-egy m≈±k√∂d≈ë po√©nt. 
Ugyanakkor a j√°t√©k egyes momentjei megmaradnak az emberben, el√©g csak arra a robotra gondolni, akivel aligha l√©phet√ºnk interakci√≥ba azon t√∫l, hogy k√∂zli vel√ºnk, ≈ë csak a buszra v√°r, hamarosan indulni fog haza...
Ezzel a probl√©ma annyi, hogy mi m√°r azel≈ëtt elhaladtunk a busz romjai mellett, tudjuk j√≥l, hogy nem fog meg√©rkezni, de a g√©p csak √°ll √©s v√°r. 
Szeretem, ha egy j√°t√©k a t√≥nus√°t igyekszik a f≈ësztori szempontj√°b√≥l irrelev√°ns apr√≥ kis f≈±szerekkel meger≈ës√≠teni √©s √∫gy gondolom, e t√©ren a Primordia b≈ëven jeleskedik. 

Aki r√©gi motoros √©s nem ez lesz az els≈ë point and click kalandj√°t√©k √©lete sor√°n, hanem mondjuk ovlt n√©mi k√∂ze a 90-es √©vek Lucasarts j√°t√©kaihoz, vagy azon era m√°s alkot√°saihoz, akkor a Primordia egy igazi id≈ëutaz√°s lesz sz√°m√°ra. A j√°t√©kban van pixelhunting, amikoris az √°ltalad haszn√°land√≥ t√°rgyakat el≈ësz√∂r is meg kell tal√°lnod a k√ºl√∂nb√∂z≈ë apr√≥l√©kosan kidolgozott helysz√≠neken √©s ez pixelgrafika eset√©n n√©ha el√©g tr√ºkk√∂s tud lenni. Sokan, a kalandj√°t√©kosok k√∂r√©ben k√∂nnyed√©n a falra m√°sznak ett≈ël a r√©szt≈ël, √©n megmondom ≈ëszint√©n, kifejezetten szeretem kutatni az artworkoket felvehet≈ë objectek ut√°n, de nem tal√°ltam ezt kifejezetten neh√©znek a Primordia eset√©ben. Viszont a j√°t√©k fejt√∂r≈ëi... h√°t az nem k√≠m√©li az agyunkat. A primordia igazi hardcore kalandj√°t√©k, miut√°n √∂sszegy≈±jt√∂tt√ºk a t√°rgyakat, azokat kem√©nyen kombin√°lgatni is kell az inventoryban, s mivel gyakran elektronikai eszk√∂z√∂kr≈ël besz√©l√ºnk, a legjobb tan√°csom az, ha mindent mindennel IS megpr√≥b√°ltok kombin√°lni. De emellett rengeteg fejt√∂r≈ë √©p√≠t a k√ºl√∂nb√∂z≈ë robot karakterek saj√°t kis c√©ljainak el√©r√©s√©re, ki kell tal√°lnunk, hogy is felelhetn√©nk meg nagyj√°b√≥l mindenkinek, hogy v√©g√ºl eljuthassunk Metromind torny√°ba. Az a fajta ember vagyok, aki nem k√∂nnyed√©n n√©zeget v√©gigj√°tsz√°st, csak ha m√°r huszonn√©gy r√©teg arcb≈ërt kapartam le magamr√≥l, √≠gy a kalandj√°t√©kok neh√©zs√©g√©t √°ltal√°ban abban m√©rem, h√°nyszor is k√©nyszer√ºltem m√©gis e tett megcseleked√©s√©re. 
A primordi√°n√°l 2-szer kellett v√©gigj√°tsz√°s ut√°n n√©znem √©s NAGYON meglepne, ha hozz√°sz√≥l√°sok k√∂z√∂tt valaki azt √≠rn√°, hogy neki nem volt sz√ºks√©ge r√°. Nem, ezzel nem azt mondom, hogy nincs jogod okosabbnak lenni n√°lam, s≈ët, megmondom ≈ëszint√©n, sokszor pont az evidens dolgok ker√ºlik el a figyelmem, DE a Primordia egyik fejt√∂r≈ëje... te j√≥ √©g... Az a termin√°l a pixelpokol legkem√©nyebb puzzleje, amit m√©g v√©gigj√°tsz√°s ut√°n sem teljesen tudtam elfogadni logikusnak. De azt lesz√°m√≠tva a j√°t√©k fejt√∂r≈ëi logikusak, kifejezetten kreat√≠vak, abszol√∫t megadj√°k azt a bizonyos el√©gedetts√©get, amit az eff√©le j√°t√©kokt√≥l elv√°rn√°l. Ha pedig megakadsz, miel≈ëtt r√∂gt√∂n keresn√©d a walkthrought, el≈ëbb a seg√≠t≈ëdh√∂z √©rdemes fordulni, mert ha eleget kattingatsz Crispinre, szinte minden szitu√°ci√≥ban van egy kis javaslata, megjegyz√©se, ami seg√≠thet a tov√°bbhalad√°sban an√©lk√ºl, hogy a sz√°dba r√°gn√° a megfejt√©st.

I started playing almost 4 years ago in 2016 but got stuck shortly after arriving in the Metropol section. I felt the puzzles were too hard and the graphics didn't help with finding items. On and off over the next few years I tried to continue but never made progress. Yet during that time I finished almost every other WadjetEye game (Gemini Rue, Technobabylon, Unavowed, etc)

Yesterday I tried again, but what do you know - my save games were suddenly CORRUPTED and I had to RESTART the whole game.  Right there and then I wanted to leave a NEGATIVE review for this game. But seeing the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating, I figured there must be something worth playing to the end for.

So I was determined to finish the game this time, and I started playing from the beginning. 
And miraculously I managed to REACH THE END without a guide within a day. :o

Now that I've finally completed this game, I can say the story and writing is definitely worth a playthrough. The characters, dialogue and world building are some of the best ever. However the puzzle design is really hit or miss. Many times I felt I solved a puzzle through luck instead of logic. So be warned - you'll probably get stuck a lot. (The puzzles are still probably easier than 90s Sierra games you could get into a totally uncompletable state with Sierra games).

Overall for me the pros outweigh the cons, so I'm giving this a recommend to people who enjoy point-and-click adventure games with very challenging puzzles.",1581448905,1581455803,True,5,0,0.611501455307006836,0,True,False,False,False,,1581453045,"I'm amazed, and grateful, you persevered and left a positive review!

The saved game corruption was a result of radically updating the game a few months ago to make the engine more compatible with modern machines, to integrate French, German, and Spanish translations, and to fix various bugs throughout.  Sadly, the engine we used (AGS) breaks saves if the game is updated in a way that changes what it stores in memory, which generally means that any major patch breaks saves.  We felt like the imposition on players' saves was outweighed by having a better version of the game for existing and future customers.

Anyway, I'm so glad you stuck with it, and better yet, enjoyed it!"

In general there were a lot of nuanced characters with different personalities and I like that there‚Äôs different ways to solve some puzzles as well as multiple endings depending on what actions you take. It‚Äôs a relatively short game, but it packs in a lot of world building considering that, and I found it very enjoyable.

Initially, I had down-voted this game that I truly LOVE because it  ran so slowly on my Win10 PC that I had to go do other things while cut-scenes and the like completed.  There are just too many places where what should have been moments of anticipation turned into long lags of annoyance.  BUT the developer quickly showed up to help! Wow! You can't beat that kind of care and concern!

We try to provide basically round-the-clock tech support to anyone who posts in the game's discussion page, and I'd be happy to try to sort out what was causing issues for you.  I've tested the latest build quite a bit on my own Win10 machine (granted, not an over-spec'ed one) and didn't have any slowdown issues -- but the engine we're working with (Adventure Game Studios) is finicky enough that combinations of drivers, anti-virus software, Steam overlay, etc. can sometimes gum up the works.  It sounds like what otherwise would have been a very positive experience was soured by these technical defects, and I'm really disappointed that we weren't able to offer you a better time.

If you could shoot me a message on Steam or an email at mark@wormwoodstudios.com, I'd like to learn more about the tech problems (so we can squash them if they come up for anyone else), and I'd also like to see if there's some other game we can offer you a key to as an apology for Primordia falling short.

As an added bonus, multiple endings exist which is always fun.

The difficulty is average with some more frustrating puzzles thrown into the mix, if you're used to point and clicks this should be entertaining without letting you get stuck for 4 hours on a puzzle, especially since slight hints are given when needed.

All in all, I've no complaints at all about Primordia (even finished it twice because I wanted to play the story again) and would heartily recommend it. The only little thing is that interactable objects are sometimes hard to see, like any pixelated P&C, which often leaves you scanning the screen to check if there are in fact objects or interactions you missed (which is, arguably, a part of most old P&C's anyway)",1578066785,1578073625,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,3,True,False,False,False,,1578072962,"Thanks so much for the generous review!

One thing I'll correct -- we don't have a highlight objects feature!  I don't want players coming in expecting that and then being disappointed.  While I see the reasons for such a feature, I've long felt that it is a net negative (for reasons too longwinded to get into in a comment on a review!), so we did not include it.  However, when the cursor is over an interactable object (""hotspot""), a tooltip appears with that object's name, and the only small hotspots are for items that are, for narrative and gameplay reasons, hard to find (like a lost crystal).  Most of the time, we've tried to have small hotspots indicated by other means -- for example, the crystal gleams from time to time.

Anyway, thanks again for the kind words!"

This line might've made me even happier, since I'm fairly sure in the history of Primordia reviews, no one has ever said this, they've generally said the opposite (that it's annoying that small oversights or choices can foreclose certain endings). I'm glad one person in the universe liked that design decision. :D"

This is a pixel-graphics point-and-click adventure, not usually my thing, though i've played some others.

For one, there are multiple outcomes to many situations, as well as the  game's ending. Even once you get to the final moments of the game, I found about 5 different endings available on the final save point I made.

Most of the annoying logic puzzles can be skipped, using an NPC or finding an alternate approach. You can also find multiple ways to get the same thing done, although each of these may alter your story and ending to various degrees. Some of these puzzles will actually lock you you with enough failures and permanently alter your path, though lockouts can be avoided if you save ahead of time. This gives the game more replay value than most games of it's kind, allowing you to find ways to have happier outcomes for the machines you encounter.

The story is also far more complex than I expected, it feels like your playing a single character's story into a much larger universe, rather than a universe created for the sole purpose of your play through. There is also a free online graphic novel somewhere (Which I could never actually find but If it were on store shelves I'd buy on sight given the game's writing) that further expands your view into their world. There are also hundreds of little details you find throughout the story that help make the story more interesting.

When I bought the game, it was on sale for 3 bucks, down from 10. I thought it was just going to be some quick run through a slapped together adventure game someone pieced together as an experiment, occasionally getting stuck to click everything onto everything for an hour or two.

‚ÄúPrimordia‚Äù ist ein starkes Point-and-Click Adventure im Stile der 90er-Jahre Klassiker.  

[b] Story: [/b]  
Hier handelt es sich um eine postapokalyptische sehr interessante Sifi-Story in einer d√ºsteren Zukunft, in der scheinbar nur noch Maschinen den Planeten bev√∂lkern. Interessant wie menschlich sich diese Maschinen verhalten.  

[b] Das Wichtigste zusammengefasst: [/b] 
[list]
[*] Sch√∂ne Grafik in Retro-Optik (Pixel-Art). 
[*] Stimmige Soundkulisse und musikalische Untermalung. 
[*] Professionelle Sprachausgabe, aber leider nur in Englisch. Untertitel sind in Deutsch vorhanden. Schade, warum gibt es hier keine deutsche Lokalisierung mit Sprachausgabe so wie bei dem Spiel ""Gemini Rue""? Da gab es eine deutsche Lokalisierung vom deutschen Publisher ""Daedalic"".  
[*] Das Duo Horatio und Crispin erinnern an das Duo Robert Foster und Joey aus ‚ÄúBeneath a Steel Sky‚Äù. 
[*] Eine erh√∂hte Wiederspielbarkeit ist aufgrund unterschiedlicher Enden und L√∂sungsm√∂glichkeiten gegeben (vermutlich √§hnlich wie bei dem Adventure ""Blade Runner""). 
[*] W√§re das Release von ‚ÄúPrimordia‚Äù in den 90er-Jahren gewesen, man w√ºrde dieses Spiel in einem Atemzug mit den Kultklassikern des Adventure-Genres nennen. 
[/list]
[b] Fazit: [/b]
Alle die Spiele wie ""The Dig"", ""Blade Runner"", ‚ÄúBeneath a Steel Sky‚Äù oder ""Gimini Rue"" mochten und gut fanden, werden auch an diesem Spiel ihre Freude haben. Spieler die zwar nicht unbedingt was f√ºr Sience-Fiction √ºbrighaben, aber 2D-Adventures wie ""Gabriel Knight"", ""Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis"", ""Kathy Rain"" oder andere Adventure-Klassiker mochten, sollten sich den Titel ansehen. Ich war so gefesselt, dass ich das Spiel in 2 Tagen (laut Steam in 11 Stunden) durchgespielt habe.  Ich f√ºhlte mich jedenfalls sehr gut unterhalten und habe Horatio und seinen Sidekick Crispin gerne durch ihr Abenteuer begleitet.

Die ""Wormwood Studios"" arbeiten derzeit an dem Adventure ""Strangeland"". Vielleicht wird es da ja was mit einer deutschen Sprachausgabe, auch wenn es derzeit leider nicht danach aussieht. Das Spiel ist jedenfalls auch schon mal auf meiner Steam-Wunschliste.

Even though I loved the game for an adventure game it was I cannot recommend it as it is, for it kept crashing or getting glitches where all sound was lost until resetting. Even after long time searching for fixes and reading through bugs and glitches other people had encountered, I could not find any workarounds; or rather, many workarounds each being all different and the developer helping these people (atleast the person posting in steam community discussions) was almost as clueless as the players suffering from these were. 

If this game had no game-breaking crashes or glitches that removed all sounds, it would be extremely enjoyable point-and-click adventure game that only suffers from typical point-and-click troubles them being ""use object X to thing Y"" to progress or ""now after irrelevant event X go to location Y to pick up object Z to use on a thing in new location"" to progress. 

In the end, since there is a great chance anyone who is thinking of trying this game now on a modern PC is going to encounter same problems as I have I cannot recommend this game with good conscience, as I don't want anyone suffering the same as I did: getting a crashes trying to load a save, constantly restarting the game trying to change settings to stop the sounds from getting glitched (which btw I never did manage to fix and suffered them all the way to one of the endings which it ruined for me), getting crashes from playing certain sound-files or getting crashes during cutscenes where game was trying to load a line.

Aside from all this, Primordia is an excellent point-and-click adventure game and I really hate the fact I could only enjoy it to about a halfway until all technical problems emerged. Only buy this game if you acknowledge the danger of crashes and glitches because it can happen to you too and you may have to stop playing midway or spend lots of time troubleshooting, killing your experience.

Story

Primordia is set in a post-apocalyptic setting with only robots and no humans. We follow the story of Horatio Nullbuilt and his sidekick - Crispin Horatiobuilt - on their hunt for their ship‚Äôs energy source.

The entire world in which you move around is sculpted with an incredible love for detail. We are passing through a world which is populated by robots only. Some of them believe in man as their creator, as a kind of religion, others deny their existence. While I usually do not digest religious aspects in games very well it added a lovely mystic touch to the game, without it becoming too preachy or dull.

While the main mission is to retrieve the energy source of Horatio‚Äôs ship, it is also a quest of discovering who Horatio is, where he came from and what happened to the world he travels through.

The story ark was lovely and I was intrigued and captivated the entire time till the very end.



Characters & Dialogues

Horatio Nullbuilt is a very pleasant character, including his design, his voice and his attitude, so it comes natural to feel with him on his quest and during his struggles.

When it comes to sidekicks they can quickly end up being annoying because they are trying too hard, but frankly, I really enjoyed the humor they used for Crispin. He is witty, sometimes sarcastic, but also very loyal. He is indeed more than just a sidekick used for comic relief.

All NPCs you encounter are fleshed out characters, with their own special quirks, that are sometimes very robot-y and sometimes very human. In general the vocabulary and the expressions were chosen very well to transfer human concepts on to machines. Fragmentation and viruses are as much synonyms for death and corruption as there are hints at something as a soul hidden deep within codes and processors‚Ä¶

Something that made it a bit tricky for me is that characters sometimes will utter a hint for you at some point, but they will not repeat it again. Occasionally Horatio will make notes of it, but in general you have to play the game paying close attention to what is being said all the time.



Controls & Usability

Like most point-and-click adventures the controls are pretty straight forward. The menu was designed well so that you can access your map, your inventory and your notes easily. There was little collision for me during the game except at one time, where it also crashed entirely. This only happened once to me though and I might have accidentally triggered it by tabbing out of the game.

What was a bit difficult was to find all the items and characters you can actually interact with, because they are not highlighted in any way. It is easy to overlook them. This made solving some of the riddles harder for me, but then I am not that skilled in the riddle-solving-area anyway.



Graphics

The game has retro-like 2D graphics that I found very appealing. The overall design of the game was very lovely: gloomy, a bit forlorn, but still very pretty and atmospheric. Each and every robot you encounter has a unique design going along with the character, making them stand out as individuals.

My favorites got to be ‚ÄúEverfaithful‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrimer‚Äù.



Sound

I LOVE the soundtrack. I adore it. But then I am a big fan of electronic retro-ish music anyway. It does carry the emotions of the game very well though, having a slightly melancholic and lonely touch to it,

The voices for the characters have also been chosen incredibly well, introducing a broad variety of how you can portray robots - not only visually - but also accousticaly.

Not much else to say there, besides the sound rounding up and also valuing up the game in its entirety.



Overall Review

A point-and-click adventure that was resonating so well with me that I cannot help but just love it: The design, the sound, the story, it all fit so well and it was all just right up my alley.
Some of the riddles were tough and I sure didn‚Äôt solve them all without help, but they were not as ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù as many of the ‚ÄúDaedalic‚Äù games for example.

If there is one thing I did not like about this game is that it was over comparably soon, but since there are several endings available it actually encourages me to replay it once more. So yeah, I am rather biased about this game. *g* :)",1577274669,1577274669,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1577290585,Thanks for the generous and thorough review! So glad you enjoyed the game!

Primordia is one of my favorite games. A story set in a wold after the fall of humanity.
You play as Horatio, a robot just trying to accomplish his dream of flying in the skies with the help of his little sidekick. He tries to keep to himself, but sometimes trouble finds us.

[h1]Sound[/h1]

The soundtrack and environmental sounds perfectly set the mood to complement the story. The voice acting in all the characters is really good and fitting to the characters. Every character that you can talk with has really good voice acting or fitting robotic sounds.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Primordia plays as a point and click puzzle game and plays a bit with that fact on occasion, sometimes even referring to genre tropes in a light hearted manner. However, the game is more than that. The puzzles in this game can be solved in various ways and one neat little thing that this game does and I wish others did as well, is the fact of having a little gadget where the main character keeps notes of things that may or may not help him solve the puzzles to progress the story. Veterans of the genre might be used to using pen and paper to keep track of all the possible hints, however in this game, it does it for you. So that is a nice feature in my book.

[h1]Story[/h1]

The story really shines in Primordia. From the soundtrack to the visuals and even the gameplay, all blends together to make a really incredible experience. The game has around 10 ending paths, and I say paths because in those endings, even if you have the same ending twice, it might not be the same depending on the things you did in the current playthrough.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

In Conclusion, Primordia is a great game where every aspect of it complements each other to give a great experience. It nails many aspects in the point and click adventure genre while being creative in some aspects to give the player a better overall experience.",1577259230,1577794157,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1577290930,Thank you so much for this elegant and thorough review!

The world building is nice and it has some touches of humor. It leaves you yearning to return to this world.

As an added bonus, it runs great on linux with proton out of the box.

It has a very interesting story that you learn and discover as you play through the game with superb voice acting, effects and OST that gives it Life, and with the addition of multiple endings it has a certain replayability that'll leave me coming back again just to hear some of the bombastic quotes.
If you like robots. Post apoc settings, puzzles, and story with cute sprites? This is a GAME for you. 
Moving on from that: 

Pros: 
-Runs on just about EVERY Computer model out there, even my Potato
- Excellent OST to keep you ingaged
- The puzzles don't baby step you through them. You have to search to figure them out
- A handy hint system by clicking your companion. 

Cons: 
- Sometimes using a item you might have use for later and having to improvise without it. 
- Good luck finding the OST to listen too by itself!
- Even with hints sometimes the puzzles can leave you stumped for hours. Best come back and try again later.

One of my favorite things about this game is that it doesn't ever monologue to you about what happened to make this world the way it is, rather you come to understand the world as you interact with it. This rewards curiosity and means that the more times you play through it the more you'll understand about the world.

I've only played through it once, but have often thought about giving it a second go. There are multiple endings, so there's definitely a reason to play it again.

The visuals are gorgeous in my opinion, a proper mix between windows 2000 game and dystopian post-apocalyptic earth.

Audio is good, music is only okay but the ambiance and dialogue are top notch.

You've been searching the dumpster Steam has become, looking for a game worth your time, money and effort? Look no further, you found one of the very few gems around here. Owning around 2000 games, I feel like playing only around 10% of them and Primordia is one of them.

The game has great, thought through story setting and interesting characters. It has a deep message if you want to search for it. But what if you just want to have some fun without studying game philosophy? You can have that too. You can roam the created world listening to great music, enjoying the jokes that developer put into his creation. 

Like in other games Wadjet Eye Games published or developed the puzzles are logical without some nonsense like trying to use a tree on a painting to open a door. I also haven't encountered any bugs.

All in all, it's a great game with nice music, graphics, voices that everyone can enjoy.

EDIT: 
To be fair, I wasn't expecting a dev response, but since you took the time to view the comments made to the game, i'll take the time to give an honest review:

This game took me back.  And i mean that in the most genuine way that I can say it.  I was always a fan of the point and click adventure games, everything from Sam and Max, to wizards quest, and monkey island.  Those games were my delve into computers, and what got me interested and hooked onto computer gaming; which at the time was drastically different in selection than what the mainstream systems had been offering.    But to digress, Primordia brought me back to the whole experience that was computer gaming.  Everything from the art style, and graphical choices, to the menu options and hud overlay that acted as a time machine.  The art itself was beautiful. Bleak landscapes and sandy wastelands of a post-war world inhabited by robots.  The setting was captivating, and the plotline kept me engaged for the totality of the game, start to finish.  The voice acted lines were fantastic, and the wit and charm of the character banter just made the experience all the more fun.  Without rose tinted glasses, this game still holds up on it's own as an incredibly fun ride.  The best part about getting to play this was that my wife, (who had very little patience for the games that she sees me play) sat with me for the entire play through, start to finish; which was a quality experience that we shared thanks to your wonderful game.  I look forward to seeing what you do in the future, and will be absolutely supporting your work from here on out.  Thank you so much!",1576389041,1576475625,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,False,,1576392617,Thanks!

Non √® tanto una recensione, quindi non parler√≤ di grafica, storia, enigmi, sonoro, personaggi, ecc, ma far√≤ un avviso al popolo italico. Se non conoscete bene l'inglese evitatela: battute veloci e non arrestabili, inglese spesso arzigogolato, ecc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
AGGIORNAMENTO dopo la traduzione italiana
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Cominciamo con la grafica, che, si sa, nel caso delle avventure, √® l'aspetto pi√π trascurabile, a meno che non faccia parte di una visione progettuale complessiva dell'autore, ma comunque √® la prima cosa, assieme alla componente musicale, che salta agli occhi. Pur tuttavia quella di questa avventura sembra molto deludente; anche se datata, suvvia, non risale ai tempi del DOS di Monkey Island: le scritte non nitide, i pixel abbastanza poco definiti, l'interfaccia un po' grossolana sembrano non scaturire dall'arte della grafica a pixel. Si aggiunge qualche imprecisione, come il non segnalare oggetti, come le porte, al passaggio del mouse sopra di essi (ma perch√® quasi tutte le porte soffrono di tale imprecisione?); o il fatto fastidioso che non sono segnalate a dovere le due solite funzioni dei tasti del mouse, cio√® di inspezione e di azione, anche se questo non √® di grosso intralcio.
Gli enigmi sono fatti bene e non facili, e l'avventuriero di vecchia data subir√† un effetto di d√©j√† vu quando se ne trover√† davanti qualcuno veramente impietoso, di quelli 'vecchia scuola' che in passato lasciavano bloccati per settimane se non per sempre, anche se nel nostro caso il  nostro simpatico compagno Crispin ci pu√≤ dare qualche dritta.
La storia ricalca il ben risaputo schema del personaggio protagonista accompagnato da un altro fido compagno, Crispin, appunto, che fa da sponda sia per i dialoghi che per le azioni: lo schema prevede che con questo accompagnatore si consumino continui scambi di battute, quasi sempre di stampo sarcastico, e questa avventura non √® da meno, ma con l'aggiunta di una gradita sorpresa pi√π avanti nel gioco.
Come inciso vorrei dilungarmi su una riflessione. In quasi tutte le avventure o giochi che prevedono la presenza di esseri artificiali, come i robot, si d√† per scontato che questi ultimi superino tutti il test di Turing: infatti i loro comportamenti e reazioni sono praticamente indistinguibili da quelli dei normali esseri umani in carne ed ossa. Ed allora assistiamo, per esempio, a robot o comunque esseri artificiali, seduti sconsolati per terra, che discutono di realt√† alienanti o che sono vittime di diseredazione sociale; o che vendono facendo profitti; o che siedono pigramente al bar. Come se, raggiunto un certo livello di complessit√† intellettivo o sociale o di civilt√†, i comportamenti degli individui si uniformino, e non fa differenza se questi ultimi sono di origine biologica o cibernetica o di altro genere. Forse che gli esseri artificiali devono copiare necessariamente la matrice sociale, caratteriale e genetica dell'uomo perch√® giustappunto da lui costruiti? E quindi ecco la caratteristica comune della sopravvivenza, della sopraffazione, della ricerca del potere e del comando. Le Macchine non possono avere una loro evoluzione indipendente ed originale e non ricalcare quella del genere umano? E mentre Mass Effect rispondeva a suo modo a questa problematica, questa avventura si adegua alle convinzioni generali senza dar vita ad una sua soluzione personale.

Ma in definitiva qualsiasi gioco di spessore e creato con passione vuole mostrare qualcosa di suo, spera di trasferire al giocatore il suo carattere, e premiarti per averlo seguito. Ed allora cosa vuole mostrare questa avventura, che prescinda da aspetti tipo quello della grafica sui quali creda non faccia vertere la sua qualit√†?  Io credo voglia mostrare una sua storia. In un mondo le cui conformazioni e tale per cui gli eventi che lo hanno fatto arrivare al suo stato attuale vengono via via delineate e rivelate a poco a poco vivono degli esseri artificiali che formano una civilt√† ed una societ√† con le varie sfaccettature che il gioco cerca di forgiare. Prescindiamo dalla considerazione che questi esseri in realt√† potrebbero benissimo essere uomini in carne ed ossa aventi varie tradizioni, usi e comportamenti, nel loro caso rimpiazzati da considerazioni legate alla loro programmazione: in ogni caso questi 'robot' manifestano odio, strafottenza, violenza, pazzia, attaccamento al dovere, ecc. ed hanno tra di loro interelazioni abbastanza complesse. Vale la pena stare attenti ai loro dialoghi, che spesso sono articolati e che rappresentano uno dei noccioli dell'avventura: vedi ad esempio il ragionamento arzigogolato di Sempre-Fedele quando confuta le risposte del nostro protagonista.

In tutto questo ad un certo punto ho avuto l'impulso, confesso iroso, di lasciare la valutazione negativa. Il problema sono proprio l'ossatura delle avventure: gli enigmi. C'√® un caso di enigma 'difettoso',  caso questo che indispone oltremodo un avventuriero per le inutili perdite di tempo e gli altrettanto inutili tentativi infruttuosi che gli sottraggano l'unico premio possibile immaginabile per un avventuriero, il suo ambito premio Oscar: la risoluzione di un enigma. I dettagli dell'enigma sono in calce alla recensione ben coperti dal neretto dello spoiler. Ma quello che ha fatto traboccare il vaso √® che la traduzione italiana ha 'rotto' uno degli enigma clou dell'avventura: come √® possibile che ci sia questa disattenzione da principianti? Faccio un altra digressione. Tutto questo mi fa ancor di pi√π sembrare di essere in un ghetto, il ghetto di noi italiani che non possiamo ambire a videogiochi che ci rispettino. Non si tratta di volont√† e sacrificio del volontario di turno che si arma di pazienza per offrire il suo lavoro di traduzione: √® che il panorama videoludico, come il mondo, che forse comprende l'Italia stessa, negletta bellamente che esiste una nazione che si chiama Italia. Ed allora ecco che, per esempio, mancano le lettere accentate perch√® i lor signori anglofoni hanno deciso a tempo debito che l'alfabeto principale doveva essere il loro. Inoltre, purtroppo, quando si fa un'opera in cui si mette un contenuto intellettuale non basta solo tradurre, come si farebbe in uno sparatutto, dove 'shot' √® 'spara' e amen: l'opera nasce con la lingua con cui √® stata creata, spesso non pu√≤ prescindere da essa. Non si traduce 'A Silvia'.

Questa avventura √® da giocare per la storia e per le emozioni che trasmette, anche se manca quel quid che la avrebbe fatta diventare memorabile. I personaggi tentano di entrarci dentro, non credo ci riescano, ma un certa impronta ce la lasciano. Ah, dimenticavo: √® 'difficile', √® per gli avventurieri, desistano gli altri.


PS [spoiler]Ad un certo punto c'√® una cupola con porta chiusa ed ho in inventario un trasmettitore radio. Provando ad inviare un segnale alla porta con il trasmettitore vedo che il protagonista automaticamente si allontana ed invita il suo amico robottino ad allontanarsi: ma perch√®? In verit√† non capisco questo comportamento. Va b√®, andiamo avanti.  Cerco, con vari ragionamenti, di giungere a scoprire il codice di quattro cifre da inserire sul trasmettitore, ma niente. In definitiva: sulla porta si deve attaccare una bomba, che trover√≤ dopo, da azionare con il trasmettitore. Ecco spiegato perch√® si allontana! La gestione corretta dell'interazione porta-trasmettitore √® errata, sarebbe dovuta essere qualcosa del tipo: il protagonista dice 'non va bene', 'manca qualcosa', ecc.[/spoiler]",1572357245,1640695984,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,8,True,False,False,False,,1572364762.0,"Mi dispiace molto per i tuoi problemi con Primordia. Abbiamo provato tre volte a lavorare con un traduttore italiano in modo che, come per il francese, lo spagnolo, il tedesco e il russo, avremmo potuto avere una lingua ufficiale o non ufficiale in lingua italiana. La verit√† √® che tradurre il gioco √® piuttosto complicato (sia linguisticamente che tecnicamente) e la maggior parte dei traduttori rinuncia. Spero ancora che un giorno avremo una traduzione in italiano, ma non mi aspetterei che qualcuno lo aspetti. La tua recensione sembra assolutamente giusta se un giocatore non riesce a capire l'inglese (o ha difficolt√† a tenere il passo con la velocit√† dell'inglese nel gioco), non ha senso giocare a Primordia.

Il nostro prossimo gioco, Strangeland, avr√† almeno un'impostazione in cui √® possibile mettere in pausa il dialogo dopo ogni riga (in modo che sia necessario fare clic per continuare). Ma anche allora, non sono sicuro che sarebbe molto divertente per qualcuno lottare attraverso battute, riferimenti e puzzle che richiedono molta familiarit√† con l'inglese. (Probabilmente Strangeland verr√† lanciato con le traduzioni, ma non sono sicuro di poterne consegnare uno italiano, per lo stesso motivo per cui non abbiamo trovato un buon traduttore italiano con cui lavorare, soprattutto perch√© non abbiamo molto da compensare un traduttore con).

Comunque, scusami ancora per la tua delusione. Vorrei che il gioco potesse essere accessibile a tutti. Se avessi le risorse, lo farei cos√¨. Nel frattempo, aspetta. Ho sentito che Gibbous, un gioco creato da alcuni sviluppatori che mi piacciono, ha traduzioni molto forti e credo che l'italiano sia incluso."

This is your classical point-and-click adventure game with smart and engaging puzzles, excellent writing and retro graphics. I had so much fun playing this. The humour is spot on. Crispin, your flying robot sidekick, had me laughing so many times.

The puzzles are challenging enough to have you scratch your head a couple of times. But they all felt very logical and were never impossibly hard. If you get stuck you can always talk to your flying robot sidekick, he will give you some subtle hints or clues. I recommend using pen and paper to write stuff down. At least for me this helped a lot in cracking some of the puzzles in the game. This includes the whole info kiosk puzzle + door code, those were by far the most pleasing puzzles to solve in the whole game.

I like that some puzzles can be solved in more than one way, resulting in different parts of the story opening up depending on your choice of action. There is also a multiple of different endings. So even if the game is not that long, it has a lot of replay value.

If you are even the slightest into point and click games, you absolutely have to try this.

In all seriousness, thanks for the very generous review (and triple patronage!).  We are very lucky to have such supportive players.

That puzzle you mention is one I regret. There actually is a basic in logic for it -- it's a reference to the DIY ""sticky bomb"" in Saving Private Ryan.  (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_grenade)  I'm fairly sure that the sock is an essential part of the real thing, but a sock would've made the puzzle seem even more nonsensical.  Really, though, the question is why should there be a Saving Private Ryan reference in Primordia, and I can't really say. I think the impetus for the whole thing was wanting to have some use for the dripping grease that Vic drew for the UNNIIC background....  Anyway, more information than you possibly could have wanted!

Thanks again, and I hope your girlfriend doesn't leave you over your taste in adventure games. :)"

Primordia es una aventura de la vieja escuela, con una buena trama y unos personajes maravillosos... pero ante todo Primordia es una estupenda obra de autor que ning√∫n amante de las buenas aventuras gr√°ficas deberia perderse. 

El juego nos sit√∫a en un futuro dist√≥pico donde toda la humanidad a perecido por la guerra y solo han sobrevivido los robots y los androides, que han desarrollado su propia civilizaci√≥n en un mundo post apocal√≠ptico devastado por la guerra y con una gran escasez de recursos. 

Si bien el fuerte del juego no son los puzles, hay alguno que otro especialmente malo o incluso absurdo, el juego destaca por la buena ambientaci√≥n post apocal√≠ptica, los elementos de cyberpunk, los carism√°ticos personajes y la buena trama. Una trama aparentemente ligera y entretenida que esconde en realidad alguna que otra idea mas profunda y que nos va planteando dilemas morales sobre los que, si el jugador quiere, poder reflexionar. 

El juego no es muy largo y no resulta demasiado dif√≠cil... lo cual no quita para que sea una aventura diferente y muy disfrutable. 

Me encontr√© con un bug que me hizo reinicar mas de una vez el juego y aunque este es completamente jugable no cabe duda de que el bug termina siendo una desagradable molestia. En todo caso por lo que he podido comprobar no es un bug frecuente. 

Una obra de autor muy peque√±a pero muy coqueta que consigue atrapar al jugador y logra diferenciarse de la mayor√≠a de aventuras gr√°ficas que se hacen hoy en d√≠a. 

En definitiva, y pese a sus mediocres puzles un juego altamente recomendable para todos los amantes de las aventuras gr√°ficas. Sobre todo para los amantes de la vieja escuela y aquellos que busquen buenas historias con nuevos y originales enfoques al hora de desarrollar trama. 

Primordia es sin duda un juego con defectos pero tambi√©n es un juego muy interesante de jugar. 

Estar√© muy atento a su pr√≥ximo juego. Eso seguro.

There is a downside though that I think everyone should be aware of before you buy. Point & click adventure games are notorious for moon logic, brick walls with no obvious solution, and ending-changing decisions at easy-to-miss moments. This game is no different. I had to consult a guide many times throughout. Maybe the solutions to some of these are more obvious to longtime pros of this genre, but I think most people will find this game has too many frustrating moments.

At one point you're supposed to use the frequency transmitter to say something to little Rex? How is anyone supposed to figure that out? The frequency transmitter is never used for something like that prior, and you've never interacted with Rex directly before either. Just one small moment among many. I know that one isn't necessary to complete the game, but still annoying.

What I love most about Primordia is the intrigue you built up about the lore. Not too heavy handed, you gave us enough to mull over and keep us hungry for more. You gave us a few different ways to interpret the history, which I love. The idea of man being a mythical, god-like figure to the machines is really fascinating.

I've not played a lot of Point & Click games, and those that I have, weren't anything like this.

Since it's been so long, I'll just give a short and sweet version: [b]This game is f#@king awesome.[/b]

And I'll be honest, I absolutely suck at the kinds of puzzles and half the problem solving that was in this. I needed a guide. But just as honest, I don't care that I did. I'm glad I did. The story, theme, setting, just the entire tone of this had me dying for more. Several months later, writing this, remembering the best scenes, I STILL want more. I want a series of novels. I want a mini-series. I'll even take a movie. Hell, this game felt almost like all of that somehow as it was. I still get chills thinking about it.
The voice acting, characters, settings, all fantastic. Favorite side-character was definitely Ever Faithful Leobuilt. Spooky and fascinating, full of a lot of information. Best creepy robotic voice I have ever heard, and I love it. I wish I had a text-to-speech reader that sounded like him.

I'll say that this game is incredibly depressing, bittersweet, and and a bit nihilistic in a couple ways if you're someone looking for hope for the future. Even The Good Ending of this game still had me contemplating how long anything might keep existing. But... there was so many unanswered aspects of the world lore, I can't do much but keep wondering.

My only negatives are probably that some of the puzzles were impossible without a guide, and that, as other reviews have written, it seems to raise more questions about the world than it answers. And I guess I'm... sort of okay with that. Although, I'd rather read a series of novels set through the history of the world to learn more.

Story:
Der Protagonist der Story sind Horatio und sein selbstgebauter Gef√§hrte Crispin, deren Energiekern von ihrem Schiff gestohlen wurde. Somit machen sich beide auf den Weg, diesen wieder zur√ºck zu bekommen, sonst geht den beiden Robotern fr√ºher oder sp√§ter der Saft auf. Und w√§hrend sie auf ihrer Suche nicht nur eine Postapokalyptische Welt aus Stahl und Sand durchqueren, treffen sie dabei auf viele andere Roboter und ergr√ºnden nebenbei das Schicksal der Menschen. ...

Mehr sei zu der Story nicht gesagt und verraten. Die Geschichte wei√ü den Spieler zu fesseln und zu unterhalten, auch ohne gro√üartiges Drama, gezwungenen Chiffhangern, Explosionen und/oder unsinnigen Comedyeinlagen. Das ganze ist sogar eher D√ºster gehalten und erinnert den Spieler jederzeit daran, dass man auf einer sterbenden Welt unterwegs ist. Es muss jetzt zwar keiner bef√ºrchten, von der Geschichte Depressionen zu kriegen oder wegen herzzerrei√üenden Dramas in Tr√§nen auszubrechen, aber das Spiel schafft es, eine eher ged√§mpfte Stimmung r√ºber zu bringen. Finde ich zumindest. 
Man bekommt keine zu schwere Kost vorgesetzt, die Themen die aber w√§hrend der Geschichte durchleuchtet und/oder angeschnitten werden, geben einen trotzdem zu denken. Sofern man sich darauf einl√§sst. 

Gameplay:
Gespielt wird mit Maus und Tastatur, wobei sogar die Maus alleine vollkommen ausreichen w√ºrde. Man kann jetzt zwar nicht interessante Objekte mit einer bestimmte Taste anzeigen lassen, wie in moderneren Point&Klick Spielen, aber sofern man sich kurz die Zeit nimmt und in jedem Kartenabschnit mal die Maus sorgf√§ltig √ºberall dr√ºbergleiten l√§sst, findet man eigentlich alle wichtigen Punkte, mit denen man interagieren kann. 
Die R√§tsel sind eigentlich nicht zu schwer und wer Adventure Spiele mag und ein K√∂pfchen daf√ºr hat, der kommt sicher problemlos durch das Spiel. Ich selbst habe eine L√∂sung als Hilfe genommen und ja ich sch√§me mich zumindest dezent daf√ºr. *hust* 
Das Spiel ist vom Umfang her jetzt kein gro√üer Zeitfresser, egal ob mit oder ohne Komplettl√∂sung. Wer eher gem√ºtlich sich ein paar Stunden am Tag g√∂nnt, hat zumindest ein paar Tage etwas von dem Spiel. Ansonsten ist man eigentlich nach ein paar Stunden Zocken recht schnell durch. Manch einer lockt vielleicht die Archievments f√ºr einen zweiten Spieldurchgang, aber das war es dann auch. 
Eine St√§rke von dem Spiel ist auch, dass es keine Sackgassen gibt. Man kann sehr wohl hier und da L√∂sungen f√ºr R√§tsel finden, die nicht wirklich Ideal sind. Aber haupts√§chlich ist das nur f√ºr die diversen Achievments von Steam wichtig. Es gibt am Ende des Spiels verschiedene Enden zu finden. Je nachdem, was f√ºr Schl√ºsselgegenst√§nde man am Ende bei sich hat. Und die Auswahl ist nicht klein. Soviel ich nachgelesen hatte, gibt es f√ºnf bis sechs (?) m√∂glichkeiten, um das Spiel zu beenden. 
Nicht schlecht wie ich finde. 

Grafik/Soundtrack/√úbersetzung:
Erwartet ein gutes altes Pixelspiel. Wer so etwas nicht verkraftet, sollte das Spiel nicht kaufen. Wobei man gestehen muss, dass trotz Pixeloptik alles sch√∂n Detailliert ist und selbst kleinste Gegenst√§nde einem nach kurzen Bildschirmabsuchen ohne Probleme ins Auge fallen. Musik und Hintergrundger√§usche fallen nie nervig aus und passen stimmig in die trostlose Welt aus Rost, Sand und Eisen. 
(Kleiner Spoiler: Die Musik die an der Bushaltestellte kam, war passend zu der ganzen Szene richtig traurig. ... Fand ich klasse!)

Die Englische Sprachausgabe war passend zum Spiel sehr gut und auch √ºber die Deutsche Textausgabe kann ich eigentlich nichts sagen. Das was gesprochen wurde, stand zwar nicht immer Sinngem√§ss da (z.B. Crispins Englischer Kommentar ""H√∂rt! H√∂rt!"", was als Deutscher Text als ""Oho!"" √ºbersetzt wurde. ... Fand ich nicht ganz passend aber ist allemal verschmerzbar.) aber ansonsten war sie sehr gut √ºbersetzt. 

Fazit: 10/10 Das Spiel ist sein Geld wert. Kauft es ruhig ohne bedenken und unterst√ºtzt damit die Entwickler. Solch kleine Sch√§tze geh√∂ren sich gef√∂rdert und in die eigene Bibliothek verewigt.",1567288399,1567288399,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1567362134.0,"Vielen Dank f√ºr die sehr nette und umfassende Bewertung unseres kleinen Spiels.

This game is a new gem that plays TOO MUCH like the old school games with all the obtuseness and none of the handholding/helpful elements modern games of the same genre have today if your okay with that then i recomend this but personlly i didnt love it as much as i thought i would . i think i would personally want a meh rank but since i dont i cant recomend this.(unless you like the old school style)",1564974261,1564974261,False,4,0,0.511352419853210449,0,False,False,False,False,,1564979561.0,"Hey Shawn -- Sorry about the frustrating experience, but thanks for leaving a review, which seems fair and balanced to me. We certainly did want to create more of an old school experience, but it's not for everyone.

I have a huge set of Steam keys for other games that I either backed on Kickstarter or got in charity bundles backed using Primordia proceeds, and my policy is to offer players who have time/interest to pick from them when Primordia comes up short. You have any interest? If so, shoot me an email at mark@wormwoodstudios.com.

- Excellent story and setting, with very interesting themes and well developed characters.
- Beautiful artwork for a pixel graphic game
- Great music and atmospheric sounds, as well as very good voice acting
- Story with good choice and consequence, different ways of solving problems and endings

CONS

- Tough puzzles which may not be easy for players who do not play Point and Click adventures in the past (Like me)
- Some resolutions of said puzzles are not completely logical

OVERALL: Excellent game, with an awesome story, great characters (I loved Crispin!) which makes you want to continue playing in order to see how everything unfolds. Some puzzles can be very difficult for not seasoned players like myself, but that is totally subjective. I have to admit that these puzzles did not diminish the game experience for me, but can be for some players.

It presents a mesmerizing world, that seemed to me like a mix between things like Nausicaa, Wall-E, Dune and Moebius comics, among other references. With inspired writing and charismatic characters, it can go from light-hearted dialogues to grim and philosophical remarks, with a very competent voice acting.
 
I normally play these kind of games for the mood, story and setting, so I can't say that I remember specifics about the puzzles after all this time, but I do remember that they were what I expected at the time.
 
I usually prefer to play on consoles, but games like these are the reason why I come back to PC gaming from time to time.

Gli enigmi non sono semplicistici, ma seguono comunque una logica e sono razionali (a differenza di molti giochi degli anni '90, quando usare un pollo di gomma era cosa comune), quindi bene o male ci si arriva anche senza avere costantemente sottomano una guida o tentare sistematicamente ogni combinazione di oggetti ed azioni per ore.
Ambientato in un futuro post-apocalittico abitato da robot, dove degli umani non rimane altro che una manciata di leggende e miti, il racconto parte con il classico setting dell'antieroe dal passato sconosciuto (perfino a s√© stesso) che cerca di farsi gli affari suoi lontano da quello che rimane della societ√† ed arriva al capitolo finale dove si scopre il passato del nostro antieroe che si ritrover√† in una posizione di dover scegliere il destino non solo suo, ma anche di tutta la vita robotica che ancora sopravvive sul pianeta. Per quanto l'impostazione non risulti qualcosa di nuovo, il plot √® godibile e si sviluppa ben articolato, svelando non solo la storia del personaggio, ma anche dell'umanit√† e dei robot.
Un particolare della meccanica di gioco √® l'implementazione di una sorta di ""scelta e conseguenza"" grazie alla quale possiamo risolvere in pi√π modi le situazioni che si presentano durante il gioco e che andranno ad influenzare in modi diversi, ma marginali, la storia. In realt√† non c'√® possibilit√† di un game over, qualsiasi scelta si faccia si avr√† sempre la possibilit√† di avanzare, ma i personaggi ed i dettagli delle ultime scene vengono influenzati dalle scelte fatte durante la storia.
Un altro particolare da non sottovalutare √® quello che in ogni caso si pu√≤ avere ognuno dei finali multipli dalle azioni fatte durante la scena finale, quindi non c'√® bisogno di rigiocare tutto l'intero gioco perch√© nella prima schermata si fatta una scelta invece che un'altra.",1561799176,1561799176,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1561828306.0,Mille grazie per la recensione gentile e approfondita!

As a person who loves super bleak post-apocalyptic worlds (Kenshi and The Road to name a couple) this game makes itself so distinct in its setting. It tackles the very interesting themes of creationism, existentialism, the impact of war and artificial intelligence and what it is capable of. I would have never thought of a world where all humans have gone extinct but before that occurred they invented robots that were capable of free-thinking and would end up worshiping their creators as a god. But then have a tyrant super AI make the religion illegal like this is some shit out of the Spanish Inquisition. They make the robots feel a lot more like humans but I genuinely like that about the game. Then there is the art style. I love the warped and sometime incomprehensible designs of some buildings and landscapes. It gives this alien feel that tells the player that this is no longer humanity's home. The low resolution feels like it was intentional but I'm not the biggest fan of it. I'm not too sure if they did it for the retro feel since point and click adventure games were a big thing in the 90s. This brings up another thing. These devs managed to make someone my age who has never played a point and click adventure game not only interested in the game but to play it all the way though. Some of the puzzles will definitely need some high IQ logic and memory skills, something I do not hold. If you are big dum dum like me just look up a walkthrough for the puzzle you are stuck on but try to solve each one on your own at first. The story and the writing are pretty solid. At first the story starts off a little basic but it eventually branches out into something bigger. And even though I saw it coming since it's all explained in the trailer I was still thoroughly invested in the game's story. The writing certainly helps. All the characters are very interesting and I wish there was more I could learn on a lot of their backstories. This game overall was an incredibly solid experience that had very little hiccups along the way. I'd give this game a 9/10 you should definitely play this game.

The dialogue is top-notch regardless of the tone it‚Äôs carrying, and the narrative it conveys is stellar. It tackles many of the themes that [i]NieR: Automata[/i] would later be praised for, but stuffs them into a much tighter package. I especially appreciate that there are few disposable characters ‚Äì nearly all of them have significant histories to suss out.

[i]Primordia[/i] also avoids the usual adventure game trap of having to ignore the gameplay to enjoy the story. The puzzles are clever and surprisingly varied, requiring nearly as much codebreaking and syntactic logic as inventory management. Furthermore, hints are neatly integrated into the scenario as the main characters naturally discussing what they should do. The primary thing holding [i]Primordia[/i] back is that it‚Äôs [i]just[/i] an adventure game. Outside of small additions like using your tiny, floating sidekick as a puzzle-solving tool, it‚Äôs a pretty bog-standard AGS product.

I couldn't help but feel like the devs had to have drawn influence from games like I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream and especially Beneath a Steel Sky. If that peaks your interest, its worth a few bucks and a few hours...

Graphics 4/5:
For a classic 8 bit style point and click, the graphics were enjoyable and on par. They brought the feeling that I miss and love about these games.

Story 3/5:(after chatting with the devs i slightly altered this portion to better reflect my view)
While i did enjoy many of the characters in this game, there wasn't any obvious plot holes and the story was thought provoking and interesting. It did at times, and ultimately, seems a bit preachy. Not in relation to a certain theology per say but it seemed the writer has certain points of view that they are trying to convey to the audience. It bounces around from feeling very libertarian to sort of anarchist to socialist etc. If you wish to know what I thought I'll tell you but its a bit of a *spoiler* [spoiler]I definitely got a pro-progressivism message out of it. Im not hating on progressive values but thats just my honest opinion.[/spoiler]

Sound 4/5:
Once again, as with the graphics, the music and SFX held that old charm that I enjoy so much. As for the score itself, it was pleasing but did not blow me away by any means. I almost gave this a 3 but the voice actors were so solid for a low budget game, that I gave them the extra 1 for kudos.

Gameplay 4/5:
Mostly standard puzzles here not too hard, not too easy. There are a few tricky ones that are very rewarding and a couple of very esoteric ones that required meta-knowledge or dumb luck to be able to solve. Luckily for me I don't mind doing a little research online but some folks may not like the idea of having to do homework to get passed one little puzzle.

Contra James, I do think of myself as a political person (who isn't?), but my hope with the game was to give a good voice to various beliefs and creeds.  In some ways, your concern that the game is ""progressive propaganda"" strikes me as an interesting contrast with this one by a user named KilledByPropaganda (!) (https://steamcommunity.com/id/killedbypropaganda/recommended/227000/), which describes it ""mak[ing] a strong case against collectivism which is more important than ever these days.""  I'm reminded of a time when the first and second threads on the game's GOG forum were one guy denouncing the game as outrageously creationist and another denouncing it as outrageously irreligious. :)

But all of that is really irrelevant -- if the game's politics annoy you, that annoyance isn't going to lessened by anything I can say!  Ultimately, there is no arguing with the player's likes and dislikes; he is the only person with a right to say what does and doesn't work for him.  So, I'm just glad you enjoyed it notwithstanding the writing."

These are classic PC titles, and Primordia is no different.  The love put into the game is evident immediately and carries through all tenish hours of its story.  Clever and occasionally obscure puzzles were never so difficult I smashed my face into the keyboard and the world of Primordia is full of both well written characters and hauntingly beautiful narrative.

I was nervous getting the game, because it didn't look very appealing to me based on the screenshot but positive reviews convinced me to give the game a chance. Never regretted the decision.

Although the game is kinda short it's very fun to explore it. You have a chance to learn a lot about the lore of the game in the city in the info kiosk. Once you read up on the world, War of the Four Cities and Humanist religion you'll see that the game has a very developed world which shows through environment and characters really well.

Puzzles are also great. I wouldn't say they're hard but in some cases you'll need all your brain power to solve them.

The only downside that this game looks pretty bad  on a 4K screen. There are some setting to make visuals less painful and more sharp but it doesn't help a ton. Still it's playable and great story overshadows visual issues.

Overall I highly recommend the game. It's a great journey into the post-humans world ruled by the machines. Great game!

But despite these issues, I would still recommend Primordia, as the story is interesting and I liked the fact that not everything is explained about the world. But you do get enough information to get your imagination running. The world is beautiful and desolate at the same time and everything looks so weird.

Cons:
-Not a lot of set pieces. I felt myself wanting to explore more but was confined.
-Some of the jokes fall flat.
-Voice acting a little dull. Falls in to the average for most adventure games. One thing I thought was interesting at first was how their last names are who built them but near the end it seemed overused.

This game is great with good logical puzzles, enjoyable characters, decent voice acting, and an absolutely incredible world and atmosphere despite what could be seen as a generic or bland color pallet the game tends to feel alive in an alien way, and the contrast of the bright vibrant blues and the rusted decaying brown just makes the game look incredible.

Pros
---------------------------------------------------------
-Fantastic artwork for a point and click game
-Voice acting is on point and well done
-Engrossing post apocalyptic story/world
-Built in hint system able to get you through most dead ends
-Very stable (recent as of 2018 update seems to have taken care of a multitude of issues)
-Great music 
-Most achievements are attainable without extensive replays

Cons
---------------------------------------------------------
-A few very esoteric puzzles.  Some objects are very hard to locate against the background art
-Somewhat short playtime (~6 hours for me, although i am willing to trade playtime for a cool story like this one)

Seldom frustrating, though perhaps a little brief, Primordia doesn‚Äôt outstay its welcome offering six to ten hours of enjoyable adventuring, and suitable for those new to the genre and the grizzled veterans seeking to satiate their addiction.[/quote]

I‚Äôve redrafted the start of this review four or five times, each time scrubbing out the words I‚Äôd written as being inarticulate and not expressing what I‚Äôd like to say. And that‚Äôs because Primordia deserves to be lauded for what it is and does‚Ä¶ for whilst a point and click adventure is a relatively easy thing to create (just ask any HyperCard enthusiast), a good point and click is not. Primordia is a good point and click adventure, and whilst it doesn‚Äôt top some of my experiences with the Lucasarts treasury, the fact that I‚Äôm placing it on that pedestal close to the classics should be some indication of its quality.

Primordia, despite its post-apocalyptic setting, doesn‚Äôt fall foul of some of the easy clich√©s that might so easily rear their heads. Its protagonist doesn‚Äôt really want to ruin his day with bothersome adventuring, isn‚Äôt hugely interested in the wider world around him, and, but for a lack of power, would happily remain at home. Sadly with events conspiring against him, Horatio and his robo side-kick Crispin are thrust on a journey which leads them to question their place in the world and the nature of their existence (well Horatio does, Crispin just wants arms).  Primordia‚Äôs narrative is thoughtful without spreading it too thickly, touching on deeper themes but devoid of the heavy handed storytelling that might mar just its philosophical musings. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it explores the ideas it presents in a way that is complimentary to the game, and not in a manner that‚Äôs jarringly incongruent to the experience.

Part of what assists this narrative is the presentation, going the Adventure Game Studio route and opting for low resolution, pixelated graphics. Whilst this necessitates windowed play (you can try to stretch the game out but I guarantee you‚Äôll be back to a window within minutes) the game looks lovely when viewed appropriately, with genuine care taken in its appearance. Despite the inherent limitations, the characters are illustrated distinctly, their forms representing the different personalities that each has. What few cutscenes there are fail to disappoint, and but for those playing the game with subtitles, will find place in the screenshot galleries of many a player. The world could perhaps be described as drab, but how better to describe a ruined and decaying world?

But atmosphere is not created through visuals alone and it‚Äôs easy to forget the importance sound plays. The voice acting, whilst not necessarily stellar, is solid and Crispin‚Äôs quips are especially notable, providing notable light relief in a game that, at times, might become a little dour. Nathaniel Chambers‚Äô soundtrack is integral to the experience, fitfully embodying the dark and oppressive or the sense of wonder and discovery that accompany the journey. If anything the soundtrack recalls Vangelis‚Äô Blade Runner compositions, which whilst I would imagine is intended, nevertheless is high praise indeed ‚Äì these soundscapes may not be individually memorable, but in conjunction with the world, they enhance the gameplay immeasurably.

Of course all this would be for naught if the puzzles were awful‚Ä¶point and click games live and die by this facet of their design. Thankfully Primordia adopts a very logical approach, with potentially real world solutions to the problems that Horatio and Crispin must overcome. What also must be commended is the limitation of inventory junk that might litter lesser games, with our protagonists‚Äô options sensibly limited to prevent frustration or obtuse puzzle design. The puzzle areas aren‚Äôt tiny by any means, but are relatively compact and it‚Äôs nice that it‚Äôs rare to bump into arbitrary walls because an inconspicuous item might be missed. Furthermore, Crispin functions as an in-built hint system providing the player with titbits of help should they be stumped about what to do next. This is a fantastic idea, and something that should be a staple of point and clicks ‚Äì allow the player the opportunity to progress naturally, but should they become stuck and want help give them the chance to seek it without resorting to a guide. 

Primordia isn‚Äôt faultless however, and there are occasional bumps in the experience. Once or twice it may be difficult to work out what to do next (and on one occasion Cripin‚Äôs advice was out of sequence, giving help with a puzzle that occurred after the current roadblock) and separating the right mouse button into a dedicated look did cause one moment of frustration. However, Primordia has all the elements that go towards making a game that‚Äôs enjoyable for everyone rather than just hardcore point and click purists, and it‚Äôs for that reason that it becomes an easy recommendation for those looking at games in this genre.

Unlike their more recent post-apocalyptic effort named Shardlight, where you explored  how human civilization and society can reshape its future after a catastrophe, this time in Primordia the player wanders a devastated barren and sunless wasteland devoid of any life where humanity is all but a memory and old decrepit machines and robots wander aimlessly, others seemigly lost in madness and religious zealotry or simply trying to maintain a purpose in life (?) and keep going. 
Our protagonist, indifferent in the world around him, without memories, with a sole friend/sidekick is drawn in an adventure that will see him travelling and exploring what was once earth,  out of necessity for survival, to mainitain his gears running. As the story unfolds, in typical adventure fashion, he will find himself entangled in a plot full of intrigue and facing some important philosophical questions.

Despite the bleak setting I just described, the game is surprisingly sprinkled over with strong doses of humor, and hearing the banter between our hero and his snarky sidekick is always a delight, making a perfect balance with the grim situations you encounter, but never feeling out of place, instead enhancing the melancholic and sometimes outright strange futuristic world,

And what a beautiful world! The amazing artwork and music really evoke a sense of decay and apocalyptic imagery, with seas of sand swallowing decayed ships, tanks and giant machinery, or streets and undergound passages full of distorted steel and cable. One small gripe people might have is that, again, the game is created using an old engine, so expect low resolutions and especially if you like to play your games fullscreen, things might look a bit messy. Despite that, the pixel art is phenomenal so feel free to tinker the graphics options to find what suits you best. 

Puzzles while never too difficult or too easy, are logical, challenging, some offering slightly different ways to solve them and beautifully designed in general. There are a couple of tough headscratchers but absolutely no dead-ends so patience and careful observation is the key. Sometimes you must learn new clues in order to trigger new interactions  for a puzzle to work (a small criticism)  and in typical fashion for such a game, some pixel hunting is required a couple of times causing a small bit of frustration. However, if you ever feel stuck, there is a very useful hint/help guide built within the game, simply by speaking to your sidekick. Another helpful innovation is the map system that allows you to quicktravel between locations and an extremely useful notepad that writes down all the important and useful info to solve puzzles and progress the game.
Another quality of life addition is the ability for both manual saves and an autosave feature.

What also got my attention is the wide variety of endings that you can get , mostly towards the end of the game, depending on your choices, but a small advice (trying to keep spoilers as low as possible) [spoiler] save before you attempt anything with Gamma, losing him will lock you out of some options later [/spoiler] a design choice that even the devs admitted it was not the best. 

If another small nitpick can be made to the game is that the endings felt a bit underwhelming to me and towards the endgame I would love to explore some avenues more, especially regarding our protagonist [spoiler] and his past [/spoiler], perhaps even an even bigger exploration of the ideas proposed in the story and maybe visit more locations. 

For fans of point and click adventures, Primordia is a really great game that you should add to your collection. With brilliant art, top-notch music and voice acting, its haunting apocalyptic world will definitely offer a few good hours of enjoyment and food for thought after the credits roll.",1549406375,1549408437,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,1549414967,"Thank you so much for the lovely, and thorough, review.

Sorry to hear of your bad experience.

There are two separate things with resolution.  One is that the game's art is 320x240, just as seen in the screenshots.  That's not an engine issue, but (1) a conscious aesthetic choice to emulate the adventure games we grew up with and (2) a resources decision based on the quantity of animated sprites and the fact that we had a single artist.  The art style is in the screenshots/videos, so if people look at that and think it's outdated and unattractive, they definitely shouldn't buy the game, as there's no helping it.  But it's not something we would (or could) blame on the engine.

There's a separate issue that the engine (which we're in the process of updating) requires some massaging to work with high resolution, widescreen monitors, particularly in Windows 10.  In some instances, the engine can't do fullscreen in that scenario, and when people run the game in a window, it can be very small because it is 320x240 pixels on a monitor with a very high resolution.  That can be fixed by enlarging the window, which I'd be happy to walk you through if that's the issue.  This is an engine issue, but we hope to have it resolved at long last in a couple months.

Either way, if the game isn't playable for you, it isn't playable, and I feel bad that you're disappointed by it and that we've made a liar of your friend. :)  As you've probably seen in other reviews, I'm always happy to share a Steam key to other games to try to make up for the deficiency, so let me know."

I'm not even sure the story had any specific themes it was trying to tackle. Definitely something to do with authority, with a dash of a redemption arc with the main character's past being what it is.

As for the gameplay, it resembles an old point-and-click adventure games from LucasArts back in the 1980s and 1990s. Lots of guessing what the developers thought would be clever puzzle solutions without getting any significant context. Lots of clicking on every piece of the screen to make out the one thing that was an object with gameplay functions only to realize it was the 5th time you clicked on something that was a dull gag.

The commitment to poor game design left in the dust decades ago is commendable but leaves a sour taste in my mouth realizing I have to look up an online guide for assistance on something the game should have guided me toward from the start. True, the game does have a hint system in the form of your companion Crispen, but it usually informs you of going to a specific place or doing an obscure task that you can barely determine because of the aforementioned pixel-scanning for every screen your face.

This one felt like they nailed exactly what they aimed to create. It‚Äôs a masterclass in world-building. I love a dystopian world, and this one in which robots rule the land and man, their creator, is but a distant memory was fascinating from the beginning. They did such a good job of immediately setting the tone of the story and drawing you into the world.

Many puzzles can be solved in multiple ways, and each way may lead to a different ending, which isn‚Äôt often the case in point-and-click adventures. I will say that some of the puzzles required more pixel-hunting than you normally find in Wadjet Eye games, but it didn‚Äôt ruin anything for me. 

They also included a great fast-travel system in this, which is something I‚Äôd like in all adventure games. And as a bonus, the main character is voiced by Logan Cunningham, who is the narrator in Bastion and is always a happy inclusion in any game.

Which is probably the main draw of the title - its beautiful looking retro-futuristic surrealist post-apocalyptic landscape, the curious post-human world with humanity turned into some mythical beings of ancient times, great animation work and one of the best voice acting jobs done for the Wadjet Eye game to this day. It also tries to be really nicely paced and designed, with many puzzles having multiple solutions and approaches and story dynamically adjusting itself to some little variables that can happen due to player choice.

That said, it does feel like by the time second half of the game starts, the game starts losing its focus. Some scenes, even with the different approaches to solving them, devolve into the usual trappings of ""try to use each item on the thing/other item"" and trying to figure out if there are any important things/exits on the scene that aren't obvious. And the common for most AGS games issues with resolution being way too low if you have a 4K screen (especially if you use DPI scaling) is also not particularly pleasant. But the game is nice, it tells a compelling enough story and tells it well and is something I'm glad I spent several hours on.
Edit: According to the developer response, the resolution issue should be addressed soon via an engine update, which will certainly make the game much more pleasant to play on higher res screens. So that's awesome.",1546894050,1547060054,True,2,0,0.506578981876373291,0,True,False,False,False,,1546896333,"Thanks for the review -- I think players will benefit from reading pros and cons together.  We are working on a port to a newer version of AGS, which may help with resolution issues.  We just need to have WEG sign off of the quality control and then we can push it out.

The low resolution of the graphics is a problem for this game in the same way it is a problem for similar ""indie adventure"" games like Gemini Rue and Resonance. Point and click adventure games by definition have puzzles that rely on visual cues, and the low resolution makes it impossible to see some of the cues. Another issue is that enjoying the art is part of the pleasure of point-and-click adventures, and the low resolution detracts from that. The production values on the sound, voice acting, game design, etc. on this game are very good. It is too bad that the graphics resolution is not up to the same standard.

The good: this is an excellent sci-fi story. It is told in an engaging way, and the gameplay meshes well with the story. Even though it is somewhat apacolyptic, the tone of the story is not dark or depressing. The game play elements are creative and there are meaningful puzzles to solve. There is a certain amount of pixel hunting, which is made more challenging by the low res graphics. The music and sound effects are very nice and mesh well with the story. The art is very nice, although hampered by the low resolution. One of the characters provides both comic relief and hints, and this is a nice touch. Overall this is one of my favorite adventure games in spite of the low screen resolution.

Played with the commentary from Mark, Dave, Vic, James, and everyone on from the beginning. As a game dev myself I really felt like I was playing their game with them, so the bloopers and insights into the process felt like part of my own experience as a developer and actually made playing the game the first time more immersive. 

I especially felt Dave's insight as a producer, but Mark's writing insights were great, especially the moments where he reflected on the end of the game before release outside MetroMind's lair. That really hit home for me and helped me accept letting go of my own project we just ended. It felt good to hear that commentary and very refreshing to hear someone able to let go with some words of wisdom while they still love the project. Not many people appreciate what goes into a game. It's far more than just code and art. Your children grow up. Your body ages. Your mind changes. 

Your life is in that screen, living apart from you in another world, which goes on to become part of the private lives of strangers you'll never meet. It defines a tangible sense of place in a shared imagination. I love feeling that as a player. Always have.

And Primordia did that very well. 

The art, while it does suffer from that low res pixelation that I would have loved to see at 1080p without the noise filter, especially as a future-proofing measure, it was still beautiful. And in fact, the resolution actually made my imagination work with the art, which lent itself to the style. That's part of the genre after all. 

The voice acting felt right at home. Every day on my own game I read comments from people who hate the voice acting in my projects, but there's so many good personal memories in each of those recording sessions. There's something beyond a game just being professionally recorded engineering wise, and the performances fitting the world, there's fingerprints of the artists behind it that feels homey. 

And that to me is more important than high production quality and exacting standards. I appreciate the feeling of hanging out with friends making art and imagining a world, playing pretend for a while. I love that. Makes me feel like a kid again, and it's why I wanted into this career. I like having that back, before facing the wrath of Gam3rKill69 for not being ripped out of a hollywood soundstage. 

Maybe I'm alone in that, or unique, but I have a feeling the audience for adventure games with a rich world like this feels the same way. Is it a little cheesy? Yes. But I love it. We don't all have to be Game of Thrones all the time, we can have fun. And this is exactly that.

Logan and Abe were amazing, they sound like my friends. All the supporting cast, the dev team's voices in various cameos -- I loved it all. 

The puzzles were great (except that Kiosk terminal and robot hidden in the dark in the courthouse) and I could generally solve them quickly without interruption. I really liked combining and reusing items. I rarely got lost thanks to that fast travel system, and even when I did I loved the art style so much I didn't mind seeing it again. 

Reviews on a game from 2012, that feels like it was made in 1996, feel more like a review of a moment in time in the life of someone you've never met. It's like traveling back in time and going into their house and looking at photos of their kids and playing with their dog. You can feel them at their desk and hear them working on the game as if it were yesterday. 

You're reviewing a moment in someone's life, and the heartbeat is still in it across time.

It's done. It released years ago. 

But it's never finished. Something in there always lives on, and you can go visit it for a while. 

That's beautiful, and so is Primordia.",1545040270,1545040794,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False,False,,1545067023,"Thank you for the beautiful reflection -- I don't think it's adequate to call it a review -- which does a wonderful job of capturing the hopeful melancholy of Primordia and of the experience of making it.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]
Like most adventure games, the play time is relatively short in comparison to games of other genres, but: better short and great than too dragged out and drifting into mediocrity. If you are a fan of old adventure games and want to relive that experience of playing a great adventure game for the very first time, give this modern classic a try, it's worth every cent and second. Once I finished the game, I felt sad that it was over and wished for a sequel that would bring me back to this fascinating and melancholic world and the likable characters that live in it.

Playtime: 6-9 hours

It absolutely was an inspiration for Primordia -- the principal one, from a writing standpoint.

(""What if TNO were a robot??"")

I had the great fortune that Primordia served as an entry to working on TTON; I got to write a small amount of the text in the game (some of the Meres, the Council Clerk, the philethis, and Inifere, plus some other sundry material).

I stuck gold because what we have here is a high quality four-man (+Dave as producer / voice caster) point & click adventure game with gorgeous 320x200 graphic.

Story is set in post apocalyptic, distant future cyberpunk world which is a rich environment for imaginative locations, story, characters. You name it. Overall story is pretty solid and will satisfy even the most seasoned adventure players.
What really stands out are the dialogues. Intelligent, interesting, believable, diverse, humorous and account for your actions if you do them if different order. Professional voice acting enhances everything with appropriate styles for each unique character. Protagonist for example is voiced by Bastion narrator. You can tell writer truly put effort and thought into it because the text never feels like a boring filler and there is plenty of it.

Puzzles are smart and original but grounded in logic. Also greatly vary from one another in terms of solving mechanic, making classic 'use object here' just a part of the repertoire. Difficulty wise they sit in the sweet spot between obvious and complex but lean a bit toward complex side. Until you solve them that is, when you'll realize it was just the right amount. To help with steady progress game tracks hints you collect and notes them conveniently for review at leisure. And for when you get stuck, clicking your sidekick will provide a very nice subtle hint for every possible situation. I even dare say this part is so well done it might be best in-game hint system ever done in an adventure game. Think of it as more advanced and fully voiced [url=http://www.uhs-hints.com/]uhs-hints.com[/url].

Another innovative detail (for an adventure) is ability to fast travel to and from nearly every location, neatly and stylishly incorporated into the UI. Good thing it is because there is no way to skip walking animations. Same goes for lengthy conversations, you'll have to skip text in small chunks at a time. But ok, as world-class nitpicker, I managed.

The one shortcoming is its a bit short (8 hours) with roughly only 40 screens to visit spread across two main areas and a lot of revisits, especially in the second part. Most locations are two screens wide though, and view smoothly pans as it follows your character. Gorgeous visuals and rewarding sense after solving puzzles more than make up for its length and repetitive locations.

Nice bonus are numerous and highly detailed Dev Commentaries (and voice actor bloopers) that you can enable right from the start (mind the spoilers). Lastly, a spoiler-free digital novella [url=http://primordia-game.com/Fallen/Fallen%20Complete.pdf]""Fallen""[/url] by Mark Yohalem (Primordia designer & writer) tells about a spin-off story set after the game reached its conclusion.

Like most Wadjet Eye Games this one is also made with proven Adventure Game Studio, meaning it's light on resources and runs on all major OS. Technically, things could have been better. In fullscreen game does not run on monitor's native resolution but changes it to a multiple of 320x200 and then stretches to fullscreen. Typically such games render in native but draw in best-fit multiple and then get stretched to native. Difference is: in the former has more blured pixels and Steam overlay is low resolution, while in later everything is fine. I had to play in 640x400 fullscreen (native 1366x768) because GPU apparently does not support 960x600 I always set multiple to in these cases. Windowed mode does not suffer from any of this but unacceptably breaks immersion. I believe the issue is down to AGS version but may be how the its features were implemented in the game itself. No clue really but highly doubt it's my drivers. All I know there are no solutions or I'd find something in couple of hours of troubleshooting. Experience was slightly less of what it should have been because in windowed the pixels looked so much better (sharper). And I love my pixels as I remember them from the 90s - crystal clear.",1543622632,1543622632,True,9,0,0.608928978443145752,2,True,False,False,False,,1543642545,"Thanks so much for this generous, and thorough, review, and for persevering through technical headaches.

In this world humanity is nothing but a myth. Humans have dissappeared a long time ago and many do not believe they even existed. Only some still wonder about them and keep their memory alive. The Gospel of Man acts as their holy book and they do their best to honour these enigmatic creators, even in the face of adversity and downright persecution.

The two main characters of Primordia, Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin Horatiobuilt [all robots have their maker incorporated in their 'family'name ], make a pretty good team. Horatio's seriousity is well tempered by Crispin's humour, while his ingenuity is completed by Crispin's mobility. Any time Horatio gets stuck and can't find the solution to a particular problem, good ol' Crispin may actually help him out with some kind of suggestion or advice. [This mechanic offers help to players while at the same time preserving in-game immersion] Secondary characters are also well designed, though I wish some of the less important ones were given more lines. 

Puzzles are neither too easy, nor too difficult. Dialogues are interesting and very funny. The music is fine and the pixelated graphics are well-suited for the job. Some backgrounds are really beautiful. Last but not least, the game has multiple endings, for basically any kind of solution available at the end. 

What makes Primordia stand out is neither the interesting graphics, nor the great voice acting, though I do admit to finding both of them endearing. The game's great virtue is telling a important human story. Its heroes are involved in a easily recognisable struggle, especially if one belongs to a country or nation which suffered through the ravages of totalitarisism. 

The game's robot world ponders important questions. What is the greater good? What is progress? What sacrifices are we willing to make for the greater good or progress? What is justice? What is truth? What does it mean to believe in a religion or an ideal? What's left when we are left alone? How do we best honor the memory of our gods, forefathers or fallen? Is there redemption for our sins? 

Though at first it may seem completely at odds with the setting, Primordia offers a original tale about truth, friendship and freedom. And for that it has be commended.

1) Die Story:
Die Geschichte kommt etwas langsam in Fahrt und gerade der erste Akt hat durchaus seine L√§ngen. Dann aber entfaltet sich eine spannende Geschichte welche durchaus auch einen gewissen Tiefgang besitzt. Zwar besteht die Hintergrundgeschichte aus alt bekannten Versatzst√ºcken, andererseits muss man das Rad ja nicht jedesmal neu erfinden, zumal dann nicht, wenn alles so sch√∂n ineinander passt. Und w√§hrend man versucht herauszufinden was im hier und jetzt passiert lernt man gleichzeitig entscheidendes dar√ºber, wass die Welt zu dem gemacht hat was sie heute ist. Wenig √ºberraschend stand am Anfang ein Krieg. Eine insgesamt sehr sch√∂n komponierte Geschichte. Einzig das Gef√ºhl f√ºr die zeitlichen Ma√üst√§be will sich nicht so recht einstellen. Liegt der Krieg jahrhunderte zur√ºck? Oder vielleicht nur Jahrzehnte? Oder noch weniger? 
Die Story an sich ist recht d√ºster. Aufgelockert wird das ganze jedoch durch Crispin, unseren Robo-Sidekick, der gerne mal einen Spruch auf unsere Kosten heraus haut (und umgekehrt).

2) Die R√§tsel:
Die R√§tsel sind nie wirklich unfair, aber oft durchaus knifflig. So kann es z.B. nicht schaden bei Gelegenheit auch Bogen und Stift neben sich zu haben, denn obwohl alle wichtigen Informationen sch√∂n praktisch mit geloggt werden hilft die eigene Visualisierung manchmal doch am besten. 
Obacht sollte man bei den klassischen Inventarkombinationsr√§tseln geben, denn hier kann die Reihenfolge manchmal den Unterschied machen: Objekt A l√§sst sich dann z.B. nicht mit Objekt B kombinieren, Objekt B jedoch sehr wohl mit Objekt A. 
Sollte man einmal wirklich nicht weiter kommen kann man seinen Robo-Sidekick befragen der einen dann zuverl√§ssig wieder auf die richtige F√§hrte bringt.

3) Die Steuerung:
Es handelt sich bei Primordia um ein Point & Click Adventure mit 1-Click Steuerung. Sprich es werden keine Verben oder Symbole ben√∂tigt. Der Klick mit der linken Maustaste bewirkt eine je nach Objekt angemessene Aktion (reden, nehmen, benutzen, dr√ºcken, √∂ffnen, etc.), mit der rechten Maustaste schaut man sich das Objekt an.
Die Tastatur kommt aber auch zum Einsatz. Nicht nur, dass es Shortcuts gibt, man muss bei Gelegenheit auch schon mal ein Terminal bedinen.
Dank der praktischen Mini-Map kommt man auch blitzschnell von einem Ort an den n√§chsten ohne wie bei den meisten anderen Spielen lange durch die Landschaft laufen zu m√ºssen.
Verl√§sst man einen Bildschirm kann man allerdings die Situation nicht wie schon lange √ºblich per doppelklick abk√ºrzen sondern muss warten bis die Figur √ºber den gesamten Bildschirm gelaufen ist. Umso √§rgerlicher, dass man sobald man geklickt hat seine Meinung auch nicht mehr √§ndern kann sondern abwarten muss, bis man am n√§chsten Schauplatz angekommen ist um dann umzukehren.

4) Die Technik:
Dieses Spiel f√ºhlt sich wirklich alt an. Und zwar nicht nur 2012 alt (das Jahr in dem es erschien) sondern 1992 alt. Und man mag es nicht glauben, aber standardm√§√üig wird die Grafik via Direct3D gerendert. F√ºr das echte Retro-Feeling empfehle ich aber, dies im Optionsmen√º auf DirectDraw umzustellen. Dann werden vor allem die Sprites besser (bzw. pixeliger) gerendert. 
Trotz der bewusst veralteten Technik erzeugt Primordia aber auch in anderen Belangen Retro-Feeling. So ruckelt die Kamera beim scrollen doch gerne einmal.
Anders als 1992 √ºblich gibt es hier aber auch eine (wirklich gelungene) Sprachausgabe (in Englisch).

5) Das Fazit:
Mit rund 6 Stunden Spielzeit bewegt sich Primordia am unteren Ende dessen was ich f√ºr angemessen halte. Diese 6 Stunden sind daf√ºr aber umso spannender und ich hatte zu keinem Zeitpunkt das Gef√ºhl, dass mir reines F√ºllmaterial vorgesetzt wurde. Ich war eigentlich von Anfang bis Ende am Knobeln. Wer Point & Click mag und dabei einem Endzeitszenario nicht vollkommen abgeneigt ist kann bei Primordia bedenkenlos zugreifen.",1543092377,1543092377,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1543267160,"Vielen Dank f√ºr die sorgf√§ltige und gr√ºndliche √úberpr√ºfung!

Trotzdem vielen Dank, dass Sie das Spiel einmal probiert haben. Ich bin so froh, dass es Ihnen gefallen hat!

In all seriousness, though, I think it's a beautifully put together game. The love everyone at Wormwood poured into it really shines through. The deep melancholy of the soundtrack and haunting art style build such a solid atmosphere. I loved picking around the ruins of the world and unraveling the full story bit by bit with each puzzle solved, or item examined. I loved the characters, the personalities they exuded in their dialogue, and all the idiosyncrasies of their cobbled together robot society I was exploring. I loved my jaded, weary, hermit of a protagonist who was still lonely enough to build himself a friend. I love Horatio Nullbuilt v5, my favorite robot.

The first adventure game I've ever played, Primordia is a unique (or, perhaps, a uniic) experience for me. As far as it goes I've seen a few other adventure games before, mostly in text lets plays, but actually playing one and running head first into their major faults is an interesting feeling. So, pros and cons
PROS
-Interesting story full of gray morality and no real answers
-interesting characters that are fun to interact with
-a few clever puzzles that will make you feel brilliant for figuring out
-numerous endings
-pleasantly ambient soundtrack that adds much to the atmosphere

CONS
-adventure game logic
-no real ""satisfying"" ending

Seems like a short list of grievances, but that first one is about 50 different complaints rolled into one. ""Adventure game logic"" usually ends up meaning puzzles that have one UND PRECISELY ONE solution, meaning you can ONLY use that cable on these specific items and you can ONLY open that door by doing something that only the person making the puzzle would think of. Without wishing to spoil, that is NOT how I would clean a rusty gear. Some of the puzzles are just obtuse in a way that would make sense in the real world, but it's honestly not fair to call it a puzzle when the game doesn't say there are certain ways certain things interact, so often the only ways a person can see to proceed is to rub everything they have against everything else, or to look up a walk though. Some puzzles are brilliant and do actually punish you for taking the easy way out or not thinking laterally, but most of them, particularly in the back half of the game, make a bad habit of either withholding information or just forcing you to try everything on everything else. In a more personal complaint, I would think that covering something in oil would make it slick, not sticky. Clearly the developers have different ideas.

All in all though as an adventure game, though i have little experience with them, I'd say this one isn't bad. The story is it's main selling point, and it is an interesting one. From a starting point of looking for the thing that stole your ships powercore, you learn there's an entire city of robots run by a psychopathic train system with a warped idea of progress and no implementation of Asimov's Laws. You learn how you used to regard the city, how you've changed since, and what your whole purpose was in the process. You might even make some friends along the way. There's even a kind of melancholy in a lot of the endings. Without question this is a place where you don't get easy answers and the work it takes to get those answers makes them all the more precious. I won't say any of the endings are satisfying, but at least I can say they all fit. 

If you're on the fence about it the real question comes down to ""Do you like adventure games."" If you do, this is a good one. If you don't, it's not likely to change your mind on the genre, but hey, at least it's not space quest. Give it a try, if it pleases you.",1542002998,1542002998,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1542006852,"Thanks for the thoughtful and thorough review.  On top of being well written and fair, I think it will be helpful for a lot of players.

I will say that the rusty gear puzzle might be a bad example for the adventure game logic point -- it actually has three solutions (clean it with oil, get another robot to clean it with oil, or have it cleaned by the rust-eating submersibles [a play on cleaner fish]), so it may just be that you stumbled into the least logical of them. :)  Still, the overall criticism, or perhaps simply ""highlighting,"" of adventure game logic is fair.  Ultimately, these aren't true logic/physics puzzles.

I hope you try out other adventures.  If you're finding the puzzles frustrating, you might check out Loom (which has logical and fairly easy puzzles) or Quest for Glory (which has lots of different puzzle solutions)."

* A natural feeling inbuilt hint guide (Thank you Crispin)
* A wide set of different puzzle types, that are fun and challenging.
* Choices and optional puzzles that make the game replayable and also more rewarding to your story choices and playstyle. Theres also 'non puzzles' that are simply interesting lore points and secrets the player can figure out themself.
Cons:
* One or two puzzles didn't really feel that intuitive to me and took me poking a walkthrough to figure out [spoiler] It did not occur to me that grease would work as an adhesive, and a few things I only figured out after mashing items against interactible objects[/spoiler]
* Some of the optional achievements can be troublesome to get unless you want to replay and know what to look out for.

I love Wadjet Eye games, I love that they keep doing what they're doing. But I just can't with them anymore. They have got to (even if it's just upscaling) offer a real settings menu including modern resolution options. The only excuse for releasing your games in 480(!!) with  no customization options is that you're working with an ancient engine that only renders to that resolution - which presents its own list of questions and issues.

Primordia has more of the great voice acting and lovingly-drawn setpieces you know and love, but unfortunately also does literally everything you remember hating about adventure games. Get ready for:

- Use [X] on [Y] in every scene until something randomly works
- ""Adventure Game Logic"" that honestly isn't as bad as it could be, but still present
- No in-game note-taking tool, despite having events that are mentioned only once, include important numbers/words, and will not be repeated
- No ""Current Objective"" box. I'm not asking for the breadcrumb trail and big yellow arrow, but if you Alt-F4 out of this game and come back to it two days later, you might as well start over, because you will not know or remember what you have or haven't done, so you're just lost all over.

At this point, I feel almost like Wadjet Eye is just cargo-culting old adventure games, doing what they know was **in** those titles without understanding **why** those titles did that, or why it does/doesn't work. Wadjet Eye, I just can't recommend (or buy) any more of your games until you get with the times and make an adventure game that feels like it was made this century (and I don't mean graphics-wise)",1540862928,1540862928,False,3,0,0.536509573459625244,0,True,False,False,False,,1540873207.0,"Sorry you didn't enjoy the game, but you shouldn't take it out on WEG -- most of their games have different developers and we only did Primordia.  So the problems you have with our game, aside from those that are engine-specific, shouldn't necessarily be present in other ones.  For instance, many of WEG's more recent games hardly have puzzles at all, so they shouldn't be as frustrating.

We're working on updating the engine (something of a fool's errand, since Primordia's more than half a decade old at this point), but ultimately we can't ""solve"" the underlying resolution issue since the pixel art is what it is.  What we can do is make it so that it requires less fiddling to *run* at modern resolutions, but the graphics will always be fairly chunky.

The other criticisms are well taken and the feedback is appreciated.  The only thing I'll note is that we do have an in-game note system, the datapouch, which records all of the codes, clues, etc. that are necessary for advancing.  I'm not sure if you missed it or found it un-user-friendly.  To some degree it, and Crispin's automated hints, function like a quest journal, but you're right that it's not like modern RPGs in giving you explicit reminders.

Hopefully you were able to get a refund, but either way, my policy is to pass along a key to some game (from one of the many charity bundles or Kickstaters I've backed with Primordia proceeds) that you might enjoy more. If you're interested, please either shoot me a message or email me at mark@wormwoodstudios.com. Hopefully I'll have something that's more satisfying.

Primordia was sitting in my back log from a Humble Bundle or something at some point, and it was something I'd kept putting off.  The last time I'd played a point & click adventure game was probably over 20 years ago, playing Kings Quest VIII.  I didn't have particularly good memories of the genre, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  I am quite glad that I did.  Primordia is actually built so that you can't get truly ""stuck"", unlike the forebearers of the genre.  It has an attractive setting, very good voice acting, and some good humor in there too.  There were a two instances in the back half/third of the game that I ended up having to consult a walkthrough for a push in the right direction, but otherwise careful reading (and failing that, diligent experimentation) and a little thought was usually enough to work through the puzzles.  There's even in-game hints that you can get from your companion if you need them.

The ""walking dead"" and ""no path to victory"" framework that plagued some of the adventures of the 80s and 90s is more or less gone from point-and-clicks. And while nostalgia does bend a lot of indie titles in ""retro"" directions, there are significant novelties in indie adventures too -- here, I'm thinking like Dropsy (a very weird game), Resonance (where you have a ""party"" and gather dialogue topics like inventory items), and the various Amanita Design titles (kind of easier, opener versions of the Goblins series).

Now, usually when I see concepts for great stories, I expect a bit of disappointment, where the devs will explain too much, or too little, and the story will fall into a ""bad intrigue novel"" kinda territory.
This game is a marvelous exception, and is intrigue done well, with the game's creative (and very ironic) view of humanity topping this desolate, interesting world.

So yet another Wadjet Eye point'n'click masterpiece? Definitely, and kudos to the main developers at Wormwood for the fun open-ended puzzles, at least half of them have multiple solutions, even the ones that seem entirely hopeless! And I can't go without crediting the amazing art, voice acting, and story that surrounds this world of sand and 'rustpunk' utopias, filled with lore and worldbuilding at almost every screen you visit and antique you pick up in an odd mix between Utopia and Dystopia. The story will struggle between the two, and whether this world is a potential Utopia, or a crumbling Dystopia, and your decisions can be based on if you think Humans were real in this game's lore, or not, or if you think Robots deserve something better than what was left for them, or not. This game gives you just enough story that you feel satisfied by the ending you choose, and just enough mystery that the game stays memorable long after your playthrough.

Of course, some of the puzzles are difficult, but none are illogical, and the pixel style Wadjet Eye loves to use can put off a few people, heck, the fact it's point and click can put off people even more, but this game is wholeheartedly worth it's positive reviews, and this game's dark charm can help keep this game memorable, also, developer commentary, free dev commentary, mmm gimme, get this game, experience it now.",1535398696,1535398696,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,1535428526.0,Thanks so much for the kind review!

We do have some detailed suggestions as to how to address the issue, which arises from an incompatibility between the engine in which we made the game (Adventure Game Studios or AGS) and modern mouse drivers.  AGS has its roots in DOS software, and as time goes on, its compatibility has gone down.  The mouse problem is one example of this, but not the only one.  You're right that it's ridiculous to ask players to work around problems like this; I wish I didn't have to, and you've appropriately posted a negative review.

A new version of the engine seems to have fixed some of the compatibility problems, including the mouse.  But porting Primordia to it is not so easy; the new engine breaks the game in other ways, and we've been working to make sure that we've fixed those breakages.  It's slow going though, because it's largely a matter of testing every little thing in the game since the glitches from the new engine are unpredictable and idiosyncratic.  Again, this is not an excuse to, or relief for, a player who paid for a broken game.

The only reliefs I can offer are: (1) to give you personal tech support to help get the game running acceptably, if you're interested in giving it a go or (2) offering you a key to some other game that doesn't suffer from Primordia's flaws.  On the latter point, I've ""tithed"" Primordia's proceeds to back Kickstarter projects and support charity bundles, so I have a large number of keys I'll never use (I have no time any more) that are properly earmarked for players like you who supported Primordia and got shabby treatment in response.

The puzzle design is incredibly frustrating which hurts it especially because there are so many ""puzzles"" in this, far more then in your average wadjete eye game, you are NOT restricted to a set of rooms when expected to solve them, there's barely any logical connection between items because they are so sci-fi, you can't cancel animations like in later wadjet eye games and the inventory is very fiddly tho it's very reliant on item management.

Everything else is still really good like you come to expect from wadjet eye games, but the puzzle design sadly is very frustrating.

If you can look past having to use a walkthrough in order to enjoy it, it's still well made but if you like me are not that enticed by the setting ontop of it, it's only recommendable if you're, like me, playing through their whole catalogue.

Really wouldn't recommend this to newcomers or if you haven't played any of the other ones.",1534423055,1661543439,True,0,0,0.519833028316497803,1,True,False,False,False,,1534435747.0,"Hi Woolsow:

So sorry that you found the puzzles frustrating.  While we think that challenging puzzles are an integral part of adventure games, the line between ""challenging"" and ""frustrating"" is a fuzzy one, and as inexperienced developers I'm sure we didn't always stay on the right side of it.  We did try to help with this by providing an in-game hint system (via Crispin, who will automatically provide contextual hints if you've been stuck for more than a few minutes, and who will provide hints when asked if you click on him), but it turns out that the lines between ""vague comments,"" ""helpful clues,"" and ""puzzle spoilers"" are *also* fuzzy, so some of Crispin's hints are probably not helpful enough, while some are probably too direct.

It's certainly not players' obligation to put up with, let alone *pay for* a developer's learning curve, however, and I hate to see someone put their time, energy, and attention into Primordia and come away unsatisfied. I've got a large number of keys from various projects I've backed in Kickstarter or charity bundles I've backed -- I try to ""tithe"" Primordia's proceeds to support other indie developers, so these keys really belong to Primordia's customers more than they do to me.  Since I don't have time to play them, anyway, I'd be happy to share one to a game (or a couple games) that you might find more rewarding than Primordia.  It won't make up for our shortfalls, but it might offset them.  If you're interested, just let me know.

Thanks for taking the time to play our game and to leave a review!"

Firstly I just want to say that I did not expect much from Primordia since I never play Point & Click games. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I picked it up during the Steam Summer Sale and gave it a chance. This game was enthralling in every aspect. 

I love games that are set in a post-apocalyptic world which is what intrigued me initially. The story is one that I personally have never known to be done before. A world where humans are extinct and all that remains are robots. I LOVE IT! I also found the graphics to be charming and brown (or rusted red).

Now the part I was not prepared for was the actual gameplay. Since I was not familiar with Point & Click games, I did not know how smart this game was going to be and what it would require me to learn. So I have to admit that I got stuck almost immediately and I shamefully looked up a walkthrough guide. But if I would not have done that I would not have known the things I needed to closely look at and pay attention to. I did not use the walkthrough the entire game because I didn't want to ruin all the fun so it was just at the beginning of the story. Eventually I started writing things down with pen and paper. Which wasn't necessarily required since anything important is recorded with the in game data pouch item. But I found it more fun when I started writing down clues and decrypting them.

Overall I had a blast playing Primordia. I recommend it to anyone looking for something new(If you're like me and never really played a point & click game) that is a challenge, while also being entertained by characters in a story-driven game. 

Thank you! to Wormwood Studios & Wadjet Eye Games for this enjoyable experience. Now I must move on and look for my next adventure.",1532193950,1532193950,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,1532198293.0,"Every part of this review made me smile, but most of all the last sentence.

This is my second game of theirs to play, and I am now actively seeking out their back catalog to complete. If you enjoy adventure games, but find yourself frustrated with overly simplified stories, then I suggest checking Wadjet Eye out as a publisher and developer.

Primordia is an intimate game despite it being about a vast stretch of wasteland and giant city-state, and its writing manages to be accessible and adult-themed without being sensationalist. Writing for most games seems to be driven by an algorithm something along the lines of: children's games have elements A, B, C, so, logically, our adult-oriented stories must contain the exact opposite. This can produce unnecessarily sordid content that actually intereferes with the story-telling. Thankfully, the writing here is much more nuanced. Some uncomfortable things occur. I felt shock, dismay, and despair, but it all served a purpose -- nothing was in there just to induce those feelings. By the end, I was both elated and saddened and I had a great time getting there. Two thumbs up.

EDIT: For factual accuracy and grammar.",1530550699,1530557587,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,1530555081.0,"Thanks!  Most of WEG's catalogue was developed by third-party developers, and each developer had a different writer.

- Primordia was made by Wormwood Studios, and the writer was Mark Yohalem.
- Resonance by xii Games, writer Vincent Wesselmann.
- Gemini Rue by Joshua Nuernberger, solo developer.
- Technobabylon by Technocrat Games, writer James Dearden.
- A Golden Wake and Shardlight by Grundislav Games, writer Francisco Gonzalez.
- Puzzlebots by Ivy Games, writer Erin Robinson.
- Da New Guys by ICEBOX Studios, don't know the writer.

The in-house WEG games are the Blackwell series and The Shivah, with Dave Gilbert as the writer.

But your positive reaction definitely is a credit to WEG as a publisher!"

It is about a world where no humans seem to be around [spoiler]-because they went extinct-[/spoiler], and you're a scavenger robot who lives in a wasteland with a company of a robot you built. A robot comes and steals your powercore, and there the game begins.

So, I loved the conspept, it is quite clever. But the slow-pacedness of it just kills some hype in you. Art style seemed to be cool at first, but as I continued playing, it got a little old.

Obviously, point-and-click adventures aren't for everyone, but that doesn't make it any less of a failure on our point that you came away unsatisfied.  As I often say, when we offer our game for sale, we're asking players to take a risk -- to put their money, time, and excitement into Primordia.  When the game disappoints, that means we didn't hold up our side of the bargain; it's really a breach of trust.

It looks like you're past the point where you can get a refund, but even when people *can* get a refund, I always like to offer to a key to some other game that a disappointed player might like more.  For a long time, I've backed Kickstarters and charity bundles use Primordia's proceeds, and since I don't have time to actually *play* these games, I think of them as pinch hitters when Primordia swings and misses.  Can I offer one to you?

Feel free to shoot me a message on Steam or email at mark at wormwoodstudios dot com.

Primordia is an old-school style adventure set in a post-apocalyptic and post-human world where various factions of robots control cities and mirror certain aspects of society past. The gameplay is quite difficult and I did need a guide a couple of times. Despite being able to ask for Crispin's advice the game doesn't hold your hand or make things too obvious compared to many others. To solve the puzzles requires some thought but sometimes there are multiple ways to achieve an objective. Unfortunately I found the interface a bit clunky and it was a little difficult and slow to keep track of all the information you need. The voice acting is definitely a highlight and brings Horatio and Crispin to life along with the other characters. Even those which are essentially voices of computers are really well done. 

Where Primordia succeeds the most would have to be the story, which is deep, intelligent and humourous. Although it is a little predictable overall regarding AI/machines, the game discusses topics such as religion, creation, justice and politics through the lens of its robotic characters. There are multiple endings depending on your actions and choices. Some are ""happier"" than others but I think my ending must have been one of the worst. Overall, Primordia is a very good game despite some of the frustrations regarding the B'Sodding interface.",1528884638,1528884638,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1529001809.0,"Thanks so much for taking the time to review Primordia, and for your balanced assessment of it.

Great voice acting and dialogue, the writing is really good and never overexplains or pushes boring walls of text at you. The characters you meet are immediately likeable and helps shape the narrative.
The art and the setting is cool, I was immersed right from the start.
As for the puzzles they seemed surprisingly fair without being boring, there were mostly logical solutions. I only had problems once or twice.
Telling a narrative through the setting, the scenery and slowly encountering new characters made for a very interesting world, the plot also ties itself up really well.

It's a very detailed, stylish, and interesting game, with just the right amount of real worlld allusions; a nearly perfect post-apocalypse that leaves just enough hidden from the view. I was absolutely enamoured by its gloomy, rusty looks, and the fact that all the actions and quests were quite obvious (as in you never had to combine a toad and a chest to created some potion many adventure games used to do) is only a plus. It has good voice acting, and great sound overal.

It is clumsy at times. It has a few plot holes, some things don't make sense, metaphors are quite in-your-face, however, for a short adventure those aren't real sins. I am sure, was it a longer game with much larger budget, it would answer all the questions there is left, and dwell deeper into the lore, but with what we have, it is almost perfect.

I only whish it wouldn't be so short. Additional (for an adventure game) features implemented (log with important notes stored, or a map instead of the classical edge of the screen sliding) suggested a much longer playtime, more locations, and more content, but alas, it was very short. Be it as it may, I still very much recommend it - it won't leave any adventure lover unimpressed.",1528579475,1528579475,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1529003124.0,"Thanks for the kind assessment!

It may not help with the game's limited scope, but we do have some other (free) material in the same setting available on our website, http://primordia-game.com/.  There's an illustrated short story / animated audiobook set after Primordia, a few entries from Crispin's journal, a poem by Primer, some artwork, etc.

My intention with with ""ragged edges"" of the world was that they would encourage the player to add his own material from his own imagination -- the way old maps became less detailed as one gets farther from the center, forcing the traveler to fill the blank spaces up with imagined adventures and dangers. It doesn't work for every player, of course; I think sometimes it comes across as a tease or a broken promise, which is why it's good to have some extra content on the website to offer by way of apology. :)

(1) It's definitely not your fault, at this point AGS (the engine it was made in) is like the crazy rat's-nest electrical wiring you see in Hanoi, and meanwhile Windows 10 computers are expecting well-grounded, up-to-code infrastructure.  (Err, that metaphor didn't really work...)  If anything, the miracle is that people manage to get Primordia running at all.

(2) Would be delighted if you tried the game again, but it's not your obligation to find a way to satisfy the game's demands, it's our obligation to satisfy the player's demands.  We let you down, not vice versa.

(3) I have a pile of keys to other Steam games, which likely will work much better than Primordia, that I've backed on Kickstarter or charity bundles using Primordia proceeds.  (A kind of ""give back"" tithing I've tried to do.)  Since I have no time to play games any more, they just sit around bit rotting away.  As a matter of basic justice, I offer them to players disappointed by Primordia.  Can I hook you up with one (or a couple, there really are too many at this point)?  Feel free to shoot me a message or an email at mark at wormwoodstudios dot com.

I swear, that's me favourite line in the whole game.

This game has a way of grabbing your attention and not letting go until the very end.

   Yes, with a lot of point and click games, some parts WILL be frustrating and you'll undoubtedly think you clicked yourself into a hole that you can't escape from, but the beauty of Primordia is that is no matter how lost you think you are there is [b]still[/b] a way to continue. 

   The thing that got me most about this game was the world that Primordia is set in. I couldn't go anywhere without finding something interesting. There's a thing with humans that I'm not sure if I should give away, but it made me wonder what Horatio would do if he found a human on his travels.

They're the kind of puzzles that you want to figure out on your own, because you know they make sense and you don't want to break immersion. I recommend turning off the auto hints.

If I had any gripe with this game, it would have to be the voice acting. But you can turn that off as well in favor of text only if it's not to your taste. 

This game knows how and where to leave a trail of hints building up to a powerful theme. It's masterful storytelling in a world that feels like a real place with characters that feel like they have souls. What more could you ask for?",1521749471,1521749471,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

At such a low price, I can't imagine why you wouldn't pick this up. If you're still on the fence, allow this review to push you to (hopefully) the buy-it-now side.

[h1]PLOT (8/10)[/h1]
You are Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot hermit living in the wasteland with his floating lamp sidekick Crispin. Life is quiet, until a large robot breaks into your house and steals your power core. Energy is a precious resource, so you aim to get that core back before you black out.

The story unfolds into a grand adventure with many memorable characters, good pacing (though slow to start), clever writing, and some strong philosophy. The only drawback I would say is how short it was, though equally sweet. I would estimate it took me around 10 hours to complete. The review says less hours because I play a lot in Steam offline mode.

Finished [i]Primordia[/i] and want more story? Check out [i]Fallen[/i], a spin-off extension of the story post-game!

[h1]GRAPHICS (10/10)[/h1]
Goodness gracious, the art is masterful. Every scene had my eyes glued to it like candy, and most areas of the game were a picture I would use as my computer desktop. The environments are so beautifully detailed, you just can't help but admire the effort it must've taken. Mind you, the setting takes place far beyond apocalypse and the world is in a state of decay and ruin, so expect mostly Earth tones. Great for a colorblind guy like me.

[h1]SOUNDTRACK (6/10)[/h1]
Haunting melodies that match the melancholy atmosphere of the game very well. They're not distracting in any way, however I was paying more attention to puzzles or dialogue throughout the game.

[h1]PUZZLES (8/10)[/h1]
As you'd expect with a P&C game, there are a lot of them. These generally revolve around logical reasoning, or memory of past locations and dialogue. The puzzles were great fun, and while a couple had me scratching my head, they all were reasonable enough that I didn't get frustrated. My favorite puzzle of the game was getting [spoiler]Memorious's code![/spoiler]

[h1]VERDICT (9/10)[/h1]
I haven't played a P&C game in a while, so I'm glad [i]Primordia[/i] was the first to welcome me back to this genre! A big thanks to the devs who made such a great adventure!",1520829561,1520829561,True,15,0,0.670014560222625732,3,False,False,False,False,,,

As for the cons, there is a bug that skipped over entire dialog sequences at times, only fixed by reloading a save or re-opening the game in my experience. Some key items are hard to miss as they blend into the background because of the low resolution or the overall general artwork blending in at times.

Pixel graphics, pixel hunting (mostly due to the low resolution and everything blending into one brown mess), some puzzles have nothing to do with logic and even when you know a solution you think ""wtf?"". Furthermore, the main hero is followed by a really obnoxious sidekick (he calls himself that) who tries to be witty, but instead produces boring monologues written by a 10 year old.

Moreover, the game also has a bug when all dialogues are instantly skipped without a single button press.

The atmosphere is excellent, being a post-apocalyptic setting that does not feel as used and abused as the label. The reds and browns feel fresh despite their lifelessness, the barren, blasted landscape seems alien rather than cliche, and the ruins impart a sense of history, the sensation of a world frozen in its last moment as the sands and rust slowly consume it. 

The inverted parallels with our own society I found interesting. The way revelations wove disparate elements together was also great. The story was touching, with the opportunity of a best ending but also *choices!* and *consequences!* that allow one to explore other paths. It won't completely change everything, but enough to not feel arbitrary. 

I did not feel it was too short. The pacing was right, it was a complete story, and everything was grounded in the overall narrative. If absolute length is a concern consider it a novella, short yet satisfying.

I have a soft spot in my heart for dystopian/post-apocalyptic/cyberpunk/steampunk settings and stories so this game quickly became a favorite of mine. Great writing with quirky humor, fun characters, and a memorable world all made the experience thought provoking and enjoyable.

I appreciate that the puzzles, while challenging at times, weren't overly difficult so they didn't bring the game to a screeching halt or distract from the story. 

There are a few choices to be made in the game as well as a variety of endings depending on aforementioned choices so this game does have replay value.

Forwarning: I'm not an avid point and click adventure player so I can't compare this to other games in the same genre - If that's what you're looking for my review probably won't be helpful to you.



If you're not a fan of point and click adventures, and stories aren't drawing factors for you for whether a not a game is worth playing (despite gameplay that may or may not suit your tastes) then this game isn't blowing anything out of the waters with its gameplay enough for me to consider you buying it.

HOWEVER, if your into stories at all and the point and click formula is even slightly tolerable (or curious to you) this is a must buy.

Price wise unless if you get profoundly more stuck then I did at certain sections (about 10 hours for me to beat it and look over each ending - reloading is fast) and the time to cost ratio is worrying to you (or your more skeptical at the base price) wait for a sale. I bought this for $2 on sale and I'd STILL recommend the game at base price despite the time to cost ratio because of how good the story of the game is itself.

________________________________________________________________________________


I was hooked on the art style before I was hooked onto the description. You generally shouldn't judge a book by it's cover but I'm an absolute SUCKER for pixelated games of any nature.

I'm also a sucker for sentient robots and post apocalyptic scenarios that don't involve zombies.

This game was gorgeous enough just from the screen shots that despite it being a point and click I considered it. The deciding factor was the rating of the reviews and the fact that it was on sale so I said ""even if I end up not liking it it's 2 bucks I can't be mad"".

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Again coming from someone who doesn't like the genre, gameplay was better then I was expecting it to be. Beginning lead you through a lot more easily then I would have thought a point and click would have put into a ""tutorial"" section of the game and (at least for the early areas) I only had one real nag point and it was the one section of your ship home that I didn't realize you could walk out onto by walking through a wall that didn't seem at all (to me, anyway) to be a door.

And the point and click puzzles towards the end are generally me being frustrated from not seeing clues that are kinda slapped into your face once you realize what they were (which is it's own kind of annoying but I digress). Dialogue can't be repeated, and EVERY bit of dialogue needs to be listened to. You're given very few hints from your companion Crispin and in some sections they aren't even helpful. ""Do this thing you already know you need to be doing"" Yes, Crispin, but [i]how[/i]. 

I won't lie the amount of times I skimmed or had an NPCs comment fly over my head to be stuck for an hour wondering what I was doing wrong only made everything harder. There are brief but unreliable auto saves -- it's better if you save before talking to people so if you need to you can listen to their dialogue again.

If you like thinking there are a lot of challenging puzzles that put your mind to work though. Not too much, but just enough to make you feel smart for getting it. The only hard part is figuring out what pieces you need to solve things, if you're missing anything at all.

As a side note this game is not friendly to pick back up after a couple of days or a week. You might as well restart from the beginning - you don't really get a feel for what you were doing previously at all unless if you have a good memory.


[h1]Story Story Story (and art)[/h1]

Before I actually start this out, can I just point out that this game has voice acting? Yeah, [i]voice acting.[/i] I was taken by surprise but pleasantly so - it was great work and generally fit the game well.


When I say this game has the background story building of games like Horizon Zero Dawn I'm not kidding. You're given a world and a small objective to begin with, before being given an area that might as well have jumped out of the past. That past area at a superficial glance is nothing much but then it becomes SO much more after just a little delving. The art, meanwhile, draws your curiosity in and really settles you down into the games atmosphere and how the world really does seem to be crumbling into nothing but rust.

As you keep exploring the story goes from your first objective to a much more intense objective and then all the pieces of the old world slowly come together. Getting clues from ones left behind in the age of man, figuring out what exactly happened who your character actually was (or IS) was intense and the multiple different endings that can spur from it being a point and click adventure game where your mind is the only limiting factor in what ending you go for HONESTLY has given the genre some pointers in that regard for story alone. It wont be as easy for me to pass over them in the future, and it's definitely earned this game a spot among my favorite games (including but not limited to Aragami, Breath Of The Wild, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ori and the Blind Forest, etc).

The only thing I found extremely disappointing about this game was that there wasn't more. I'll definitely be chewing on this story for weeks to come.

[h1]General Impressions[/h1]
There is a certain wistfulness that permeates an existence without affection. In [i]Primordia[/i], building a robot is the equivalent of birthing one. To oil cogs into a machine's first breath is a labor of love. However, just as much as human birth can blossom from a seed of spite, machines too can click and clank about as the result of nothing short of duty and necessity. 

Playing as Horatio Nullbuilt (built by [i]null[/i]), wistfulness is your paragon; humanity, your faith. 

With that premise, [i]Primordia[/i] may prove not be a game for everyone ‚Äì even if such thing did exist. On the other hand, its infinite amount of excellently delivered wisdom make the game quickly and universally take root within every heart brave enough to play it. 

In that sense, I believe there has never been a point and click game quite like [i]Primordia[/i]. Although it stands atop of a hill with the classics ‚Äì the [i]Monkey Island[/i] series, The [i]Broken Sword[/i] series, [i]The Longest Journey[/i], etc. ‚Äì it holds something that few of its older peers have: it has the vision, the eloquence and the language of modern day games. It takes the best if its genre and holds it close to its heart, while tossing away the majority of what so many people have always disliked about it ‚Äì like not knowing when or in what order to combine items or being stuck in convoluted puzzles ‚Äì and from that, it draws its strength and appeal. 

However, [i]Primordia[/i]'s strongest trait lies elsewhere: in its story. The universe it weaves is one that begs you to belong to it. Which is quite the accomplishment, considering how the vast majority of said universe is tarnished by decay and, upon a first glance, seems wholeheartedly uninviting and cold. 

And yet, as my last decision of the game dawned to an epic close, I didn't want to leave. That scrap of the Earth deemed as its most crude and barren shell felt like home, and Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin Horatiobuilt felt like family.

There are, out there, creative births that make us wonder how far we can stretch the definition of 'art'. In [i]Primordia[/i], it is just as endless as a robot's love.",1515377864,1515378203,True,40,0,0.812138557434082031,15,False,False,False,False,,,

The story of Primordia takes place in what seems like a distant future, where humanity is but a bleak and redundant memory in the most ancient of machines. Biological life has been eradicated and solely machines roam the surface of the dying planet. We, the player, follow Horatio Nullbuilt V.5 and his companion - Crispin Horatiobuilt V.1 - in a quest to retrieve the power core of their ship that has been stolen. The duo search the dunes in the first arc, but soon arrive at Metropol. The Last City. The City of Glass and Light. Though they soon discover that their expectations were wildy inaccurate...

In my opinion, the plot of Primordia is quite intriguing. Morality [spoiler] and the preservation of mankind and machines [/spoiler] is discussed [spoiler] in an excerpt from the files of Horus and conversations with MetroMind [/spoiler] and we encounter myriads of wacky characters all with their own personalities, motives and backgrounds. There are several endings, although most can be achieved by [spoiler] going back to a save from the last scene in the Tower [/spoiler].

Overall, the game covers the adventure of a machine suffering from partial amnesia (not a medical term) who is dragged into intrigues and conspirations and who is forced to realize his identity in a abysmal post-singularity world. Will you save your friends? Will you save Metropol from descending into chaos and ruin? Will you fulfill your [spoiler] ancient mission or your [/spoiler] dream? Is there even hope for the Last of the Four Cities?

Art: What can one say but simply [i]astounding[/i]?

Music/Soundtrack and SFX: Really quite atmospheric. Fully voice acted.

Story: Solid 

Gameplay: There isn't too much 'gameplay', but it runs smoothly. Minor graphic glitches and movement errors. 
I suggest that fullscreen mode should be added for increased immersion, but sadly, the game likely won't be getting any updates. 

Some issues I had included text being shown at a ridiculously rapid pace [spoiler] and my inability to steal Oswald's oil before Clarity started accompanying Horatio and Crispin [/spoiler].  

Primordia isn't all too replayable, but the first playthrough will be fascinating for the player. Remember: almost EVERYTHING interactable has a use, so when you obtain a new item always try to combine it with all other items in your inventory, and most objects and structures out in the map. (Always click everything with everything you have.) If you're stuck, try consulting (clicking on) Crispin. 

I genuinely love Primordia and of course recommend it.",1515090208,1515090332,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,False,,,

As an old graphic adventure's player and a experienced gamer in many genres i must say im impressed with every single part of this game since i buyed and completed it. 

The music ambient songs fit with every enviroment of the game and this last ones make the player get involved in the actions of the game. I liked the puzzles and map exploration of the game as well as Horatio and Crispin comments and jokes in the decissions and findings.

Also i've seen Crispin's comments and advices make the game easier, wich is not a bad thing for unexperienced graphic adventures players who want help, because you can choose not to ask Crispin for advice, so the game maintains its dificulty and makes you think.

The art is fantastic, a perfect example of decayed futurist world with an own and original style that i believe every graphic adventure fan and game art fan will love.

By the way I've read some negative comments about this game complaining about the ease or difficulty of the puzzles and also the ""pixel hunter"" expresion refering to the map exploration and its secrets and i can't less than ask myself: isn't that part of the game genre? why whould it have to be that easy? aren't the graphic adventures about thinking the different puzzles and ways to get the final satisfaction of completing the story? I understand the ""i'm stuck"" problem, i've lived it many times in this genre, but it's not an excuse to make developers responsible for ""not making the game as easy as i want to"". I think the game is perfectly complete and does not need facilities but mindful players who must apreciate the details and think more when doing the puzzles, wich are created to think and resolve them.

At last i must say the only thing i dont like about the game just to help devs: the Metropol city robots. The robots make a constant walk along the maps you can explore into the city, and i liked the way how diferent robots appear and leave when you change of map and in the different parts of the game, but the ones moving constantly into the maps just go nowhere turning at the end of the roads and coming back the same way. That gives you a kick in the city involve sense(if you know what i mean).

To end this reviwew I definitely recommend this game... no... this piece of digital art to every single person who's searching for an adventure with a great story, many ends depending on decissions and a impressive way to get involved on it.
Thanks to Primordia developers for this story, i wont lie, i want more and me like others in this community would like to see more games like this soon.",1515008067,1515008418,True,1,0,0,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The characters too, were excellent. A lot of character, even if they seemed simple and one-dimensional, they evolved depth throughout the game, and developed into a lot more nuanced characters.

I would have liked for a bit more personally, but the game works well with the time it has.

I, personally, stayed mainly for the characters. Your floating assistant is f*cking hilarious, and the protagonist and him play off each other so nicely, it's worth playing the game for those two alone. My favourite character has got to be Clarity though, I just kind of like her personality I guess.

The gameplay was frustrating for me though. I have never been a big point and click fan, and as such a lot of Point and Click elements frustrated me greatly. Some of the puzzles were very clever and rewarding, but a lot of them also basically couldn't be solved by any other way than by walkthrough or blind clicking.

6/10 - Above average, but not worth the current price, pick up on sale.

You play as Horatio Nullbuilt, Version 5, and supporting you is Horatio's sidekick/son, Crispin. The premise is pretty standard, you are on a journey to reclaim what was taken from you, but the execution is where the game truly shines. Primordia's world is devoid of life, and yet a few machines persist in carrying out what functions were once prescribed to them. Primordia's world, however, is not devoid of feeling or emotion.

The dialog in Primordia is very strong. From Crispin's snarky remarks to Primer's street poetry, every single character in the game is charismatic, memorable, and interesting to interact with. For example, Clarity, a character you meet in the later half of the game, has some fairly amusing dialog. The writer for Primordia, Mark Yohalem, works in the legal field, and Clarity is a robot built with little to no error margin when it comes to matters of law and justice. She is rigid, uncompromising, and she lays the absolute legal beatdown on poor Horatio on matters of property ownership. It was also not surprising that Horatio had to resolve some unrelated ownership disputes later on, but I digress.

Primordia's main antagonist is another example of a well-written character; it truly believes that it is doing the right thing, and in a way, it is. In a world devoid of humanity, right and wrong are just words, and ideals are worth clinging on to. I have to commend the voice work in the game, too, as it is spot-on. Logan Canningham, of the Bastion fame, voices Horatio. Horatio is appropriately raspy, somber, the perfect tone for a religious leading man. Others are similarly well cast, such as Crispin's upbeat attitude that doesn't wane throughout the game, the Legionbuilt, and so on. There is more to mention about the characters in Primordia, but suffice to say, the game strikes gold when it comes to characterization. 

The story, which is fairly short, is satisfying: there are emotional moments, there are moments of idle banter that flesh-out the world and the machines ‚Äúliving‚Äù in it, and there is an inevitable conclusion that changes everything. There are several endings to Primordia, and I don't think any of them are weak or abrupt, and it was cool to see how certain plot elements were referenced or expanded on. I felt satisfied viewing each individual ending, and that's not something I can say about the majority of games that have multiple endings. My only real concern about the story is that it could have been a little longer, perhaps utilizing some of the cut content, but it's not a big deal. I was just sad that it was over.

The mechanics, on the other hand, I do have some issues with. The game has a really low screen resolution, and while the pixel-styled graphics lend well to the desolate world of Primordia, alt-tabbing or using the Steam overlay can be really jarring on modern systems. On several instances the game would auto-skip all dialog and sound after alt-tabbing or using the overlay; not game breaking, but a little annoying. Another problem, I feel, is that because of the game's screen resolution, item-hunting can be a pain. This really goes for the point-n-click genre in general, but finding stuff on screen can be a chore when you can't highlight everything you can interact with. That said, if you're a veteran of the genre, this shouldn't be much of a problem.

When it comes to gameplay, I never felt like Primordia was unfairly obtuse or poorly designed. Crispin, Horatio's sidekick, can provide some valuable information if you're stuck, though his advice can be fairly vague at times. I did scratch my head several times, completely oblivious to a puzzle's solution, but prevailed eventually. As with other games, trying everything usually resolves the problem in the end. Also, I feel it salient to mention that certain puzzles in Primordia can be failed and the game can proceed regardless. This doesn't have much of an impact other than modifying one ending sequence‚Äîthe only exception occurs early on in the game, and failing this puzzle locks you out of future content. Keeping several save-states as you're playing through is recommended.

Mark Yohalem originally recommended that I play through Primordia, and I am certainly glad that I did (after much delay though). The dialog, and some of the atmosphere, actually reminded me of Star Control II, probably one of my all-time favorite video games: a game that combines humor, melancholy, and strong characterization. While the gameplay elements may lack in some way or other, the overall experience is rewarding and worth the time. If you've been eying the game, give Primordia a try.

Primordia is a game about the earth after us, the stuff we leave behind: junk, devastation, and robots. The game readily explores the concept of religion in non-human sapients, which is fresh and unique in sci-fi settings where religions are regulary viewed with disdain and are associated with less advance societies. The humanist religion is based around man the builder, creator of wonders and robots. In this world humans are missing, where they went and how they went are mysteries; but our lovely robots have carried own in our absence. Our inventor protagonist, Horatio Nullbuilt, is trying to reclaim what was stolen from him in the opening scenes of the game. This puts him on path to solve his immediate problems and eventually his quest leads him to the city of Metropol where the secrets are slowing unraveling the city.

The game is not without it's humor from the banter between Crispin and Horatio, references to other famous robots, and Horatio's object commentary.  

If your stuck on a puzzle try using Crispin, on an area you can't reach. The game never tells you about this before you have to figure it out. 
  
If you like post-apocalyptic worlds without mankind, adventure games, and robots: this is probably up you alley.",1511723827,1511723827,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Review[/h1]
[b]Overview[/b]
Primordia is a very good point & click adventure game that I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys story focused games to play. Although Primordia plays like any other game in the same genre it truly stands out from the crafted world and story. Many of the actions you choose to take has some effect on the world, some may be small while others completely change the course of your story.
The world of Primordia is so carefully crafted from the inhabitants, the environment, and the music to make the world feel so alive and real making it so easy to immerse oneself.

[b]Story[/b]
At first the story may come off simple and cliche but as you play more and explore the world, things start appearing more than it seems. There is an obvious and straight forward path available where you simply play the formula and reach the end easy but exploration and curiosity may reward you with more twists and revelations to the story.",1511581185,1697610097,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Key points for me were: nice art, great atmosphere, interesting setting, likeable characters, and engaging story. 

Primordia is a solid point and click adventure overall but also stands above the crowd in a few ways. I really liked the portrayal of the main character; you get a good feel for his ideals and personality through play and he is much more defined than your standard ""blank slate"" style main character. The dynamic between the main character and his sidekick is very enjoyable as well. The story has strong mystery elements and piecing together the lore of the setting and the history of your character as it progresses is highly satisfying. The game also explores some philosophical issues in a way that didn't feel forced or hamfisted, instead characters' philosophy drive their actions and affect the world in a naturalistic manner.

In many newer adventure games, these act largely as roadblocks to progress, and fall back on tried and true formulas we've all solved many times before.  Primordia has some great new puzzle ideas that I don't recall seeing in other adventure games, as well as puzzles with multiple solutions.  They're well integrated with the story, and are challenging without being illogical or ridiculous.

It does fantastically with art, voice acting and plotting but falls a little short with design and original story. Still it is a fantastic game worth your time.

Wadjet has the production quality down.  While the visuals are still pixel-art, the quality and detail rich world are superb. Visual design is reminiscent of Mad Max, the world is a dystopian nomadic future. However, the color palette does leave you wanting as the game is entirely brown and gray.  This is understandable due to the setting being a post-apocalyptic world, but it makes places feel smaller and objects in the scene indistinguishable from one another.  That said the world is actually full of characters. NPCs move freely about with their own purpose, unrelated to the story but framing the world. 

Game design is closer to standard point and click than Wadjet‚Äôs previous Blackwell series.  You find objects, rub two of them together and get a new object. But there are a few problems.  Pixel hunting in this game is abundant.  I had to refer to a guide multiple times only to find out there was some inconspicuous spot on screen that was clickable. This is not just a failing of the art but a failing of design. If something is vital for game progression it should be noticeable inside the massively detailed visuals. With the abundances of clickable spots and NPCs that do nothing it is easy for little things to get lost in the details. There are also some awkward quizzes that kind of pop up out of nowhere, but they are mainly for achievements. But despite that there are some interesting choices.  You have multiple solutions to problems. Some are just for variety, but others actually affect the possible endings in the game. With that in mind, choice matter, so save often.

The first part of the story plays out like a dystopian techno-fantasy, but once the setting changes to the city the style changes somewhat sharply.  The second part of the story resembles Raymond Chandler novel.  A gruff character minding his own business gets pulled into a conspiracy that only he can sort out. Also there is a dame and a bunch noir-esque characters. Overall, the themes are nothing new, you can see similar from Planet of the Apes, Mad Max, or Wall-E. Despite the un-originality of the plot, it is well written. The main character Horatio Nullbuilt has a few interesting parallels to the Shakespearian Horatio, but this time playing the lead and foil to man.  The multiple endings are quite varied.  The Characters ultimate choice for his sense of justice is entirely up to the player.  

Primordia suffers a bit from pixel hunting but overall is a fantastic game. It has great visuals, great voice acting and an interesting story where choices matter.

Playing a good and original Science fiction game....that's even less probable, it feels like finding a very special treasure.
Good words have been around for Primordia since it came out in 2012 (I'm now playing it for the first time in 2017) and i can say it's all pretty much justified. 
The game has a good story, with interesting characters, both main and secondary ones. It has an interesting beginning, a well handled middle and an ending ( and a pretty good one at that, although that depends on which ending you get). 

Besides been good or bad, it's always satisfying to see that the creator of the game has put as much dedication to the ending(s) of the game as the beginning. The game has a good flow all around and it (almost) never comes down. It's 97% good, which is a rare thing in itself.
The game has a late 1990s graphic adventure style, although it is from 2012. You can either take it or leave it. I know that's not the reason why i was interested in playing this game, and i'm really not nostalgic at all for playing a game like that.

That being said, there is a certain time for ""getting used to"" the low res graphics and full screen style, but once you are past that and well into the game, it is a very interesting story, you will forget about everything else. 
And that's only because the story is good, the voice acting is also good, the script is well written and feels right and compelling. And the design of the game is as much original and though out as the script, you really feel like looking, if not at least reading a visual novel of the future.

Humans have disappeared from the earth. All that survives are machines built by machines from the past, the Primordium. And you are a loner, a robot living in the dunes outside the city in a broken ship that you are fixing, hoping one day,  it will fly away... but all those dreams are put on hold when suddenly one day your ship is sabotaged and the power core stolen from it. You face a slow death until your energy drains out, so you are forced to go out of your comfort zone and into the big city Metropol, in search of your missing link.

It really feels like it could work for any good movie or even a AAA game. The music also fits very nice within the game.

The puzzles are very original, as the story and for the most part are very fun when you find the solution. There are one or two exceptions, especially one certain  game of words....which at least in my case, needed and external reference to be completed, and of course that's not good at all when you have to, go looking for a clue outside the game, that's a total killer, but besides that all the rest of the puzzles are very good.

The pace of the game is very fluid, and the inclusion of a hint system built into your sidekick works very organically without ruining the game experience and the satisfaction of figuring out most of the things by yourself.
The story has even time to be not only serious, and funny, but also a little philosophical , posing real science fiction questions about time , technology and the future of human society.",1503780324,1504418332,True,13,0,0.663853228092193604,7,True,False,False,False,,,

- The story, while great, never fully fleshes out the characters backstories to a satisfying depth.

- nice story (kind of reminds me The Big Lebowski where the guy don't really care and just want to get back his stuff, except this time he will have the fate of all robots life in his hands).
I also like the similarities you will find between the robots world and human's world.
Overall it is clever writting.
- cool ambiant soundtrack
- puzzles are not too hard but not too obvious either.
- like the design and the post apocalyptique universe but...

CONS :
-... I wish graphics could have been just a bit better.
- One puzzle got me stuck though (the memorious code at the kiosk), not really obvious solutions on that one.

Despite of having a resolution problem (for 1980x1080), Primordia is a wonderful post-apocalyptic graphic adventure. The puzzles aren't extremely difficult, but they're not easy neither; and what it's more important: the puzzles are logical and based in mathematical problems, which gives to the game a deeper sense of immersion.

Moreover, it counts with a wide variety of endings (7 in total) and achievements (in which you'll need a guide for some of them), all of this makes the game be replayable. Finally, the dialogs, the jokes and the OST are immersive and well designed, allowing the player understand what's happening in depth, but in a good fragmented order (which makes you feel curious during the whole adventure).

For these reasons, I highly recommend this game in its full price.

Well where to begin? I purchased Primordia initially just because I was captivated by the games art style and aesthetic that I saw on the steam store page. The murky, decayed and organic (almost HR Giger-esque in places) qualities of the scenes and designs caught my eye immediately.

In short summary Primordia is a world run by robots - man has vanished. Everything is slowly decaying and power - the lifeblood of the machines and robots who inhabit this world - is running low.

What first struck me when I first played the game beyond the look of it was the quality of the voice acting - especially of the lead character Horatio Nullbuilt (played by Logan Cunningham who also voice acted the narrator in Bastion). Other stand outs for me included your limb challenged sidekick good ol' Crispin, and my personal favourite the medieval old English speaking Ever-Faithful Leobuilt.

There are some deep theological questions and revelations in this game centring around the relationship between man and machine that I won't spoil here. That there are subtle parallels to our own world I also found to be clever and well executed. 

Although the game is melancholy in tone, it is counterbalanced by a ton of humour - usually provided by your best friend and ever complaining sidekick Crispin. Listening to some his dialogue genuinely made me laugh (which is an achievement in itself since I'm generally a miserable b'sod).

As it is a point and click adventure game I best mention the puzzles. On the whole they are fine and make sense with a bit of lateral thinking although I did have to resort to a guide once to get past a particularly tricky one. However, in this genre of game I would accuse the developer of not making it hard enough if I wasn't having at least one instance of  being completely at a loss! I reckon it builds character...

The game has multiple ways of solving particular puzzles and also multiple ending which is nice. If you're anything like me you'll want to play through a couple of times at least to see them all.

In conclusion, I would rate Primordia as one of the best point and click adventure games I've ever played and up there right beside one of my other favourites [b] The Dig [/b]. More than that though I would rate it as one of the most enjoyable and involving games I've played for the last couple of years. I just wish there was a sequel in the works! The world, setting and characters of Primordia are too good not to revisit.

The puzzles are quite varied and put together so very cleverly, offering a real challenge for anyone looking to put their heads to work. Loved every minute of this game, much credit to the amazing devs <3",1499917109,1499917282,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Este juego es todo lo que promete y mucho m√°s. Como ya habr√°s visto el arte del juego es excepcional. El estilo y la calidad se mantienen a lo largo de todo el juego. La m√∫sica no es tan llamativa, pero combina perfectamente con el arte para crear una atm√≥sfera l√∫gubre, desoladora y confortable a la vez.


Ahora deber√°s estar pensando ""todo muy lindo, pero ¬øqu√© hay de la jugabilidad?"". En mi opini√≥n es excelente. Los puzzles son razonables pero no obvios, de manera que puede llevarte un rato darte cuenta de qu√© debes hacer, y nunca ser√° algo descabellado como en algunos juegos de anta√±o. No puedes morir ni quedarte trabado, aunque ciertas acciones bloquean o habilitan distintos finales. De cualquier forma, no te olvides de que como en cualquier Point & Click en alg√∫n momento pasar√°s algo por alto y estar√°s bastante tiempo hasta darte cuenta de que la soluci√≥n estaba a simple vista. Yo creo que esto √∫ltimo es un problema del g√©nero y no del juego, y solo me sucedi√≥ una vez durante toda la aventura.

Y hablando de aventura, prep√°rate para una de las mejores de tu vida. Primordia no tiene escenas de acci√≥n deslumbrantes ni efectos especiales, pero tiene una de las mejores historias en de ciencia ficci√≥n jam√°s contada. Cada lugar que visitas y cada personaje que conoces dejar√° una impresi√≥n en ti. Al principio no hay mucho, el juego te da a conocer el ambiente y a los personajes principales, pero dale tiempo y terminar√°s tan enganchado que no te sacar√°n de la silla ni con una gr√∫a.


¬øC√≥mo? ¬øA√∫n no est√°s convencido? Yo no puedo hacer mucho m√°s, pero Primordia s√≠. La p√°gina oficial del juego ofrece un demo gratis. Este abarca poco de la historia, pero creo que te dar√° la impresi√≥n necesaria para hacerte comprarlo. ¬øNo sabes ingl√©s o andas medio flojo? En esa misma p√°gina puedes bajarte un parche con el doblaje del texto en espa√±ol (te perder√°s algunos chistes y juegos de palabras, pero nada trascendente).


Los √∫nicos motivos por los que alguien no deber√≠a jugar al Primordia son:
-No te gustan los juegos de Point & Click (aunque si nunca has probado uno este es un buen comienzo) o no tienes mucha paciencia.
-Si no te agrada el arte del juego (la calidad es excelente sin discusi√≥n, pero sobre gustos no hay nada escrito).


En mi opini√≥n Primordia es una obra maestra, un juego como pocos. Pru√©balo, no te arrepentir√°s.",1499729851,1499729851,True,5,0,0.60000002384185791,3,False,False,False,False,,,

More than a few games have speculated on the synthetic future but few are as grim a vision as Primordia. Not even the worst of the brown military shooters can match the muddy wastes and rusting towers of this title. As unappealing as that might sound it's all by design, to make the colorful characters of this adventure shine even brighter against a dim backdrop. And as long as you can get past the dark overtones, you'll find that it really is a brilliant journey.

In the barren wastes of a far-future world we find Horatio Nullbuilt, a humanoid robot who could be mistaken for a tusken raider animatronic. He and his faithful hovering companion, Crispin Horatiobuilt, reside in the ruins of an ancient aircraft that Horatio is intent on restoring to service. Those plans are interrupted in a dramatic way that leads the duo to Metropol, a decaying city of robots in service to an unseen despot. By the end of their adventure, Horatio and Crispin find themselves at the center of a social and political conflict that will determine the fate of the city.

Right away, it should be apparent how much thought went into conceiving of this mechanical world. The naming conventions, the manners of speech, and even the robot designs themselves indicate a deeply developed and stylized world without humans. These robotic denizens define themselves by the builders and functions, and their personalities match to a T. Their digs are just as interesting, with wrecks and ruins re-purposed into mechanized living spaces. It's a living, breathing world of machines that don't even breathe, and the differences are striking and apparent once you get past the pleasant familiarity of the characters.

I really can't say enough good things about the writing, but Lord knows I'm about to try. Plenty of adventure games stumble over stiff scripts and unnatural characters but you'll get none of that in Primordia. Horatio is an excellent mix of gruff and kindly, and his sidekick bubbles and prods in just the right ways to play off of him (and others) without becoming grating. Just the first few scenes should be enough to ingratiate them to you, an important hurdle for any character-driven game. And the supporting cast is delightfully varied and colorful as well, spanning the full range of devout mystics, shift traders, duty-bound servants, and adorable beeping things. There's creativity here that I haven't seen since Planescape: Torment which did a lot to keep me invested in the plot.

On the mechanical side, Primordia again does everything it needs to to keep the puzzles clever and moving. Your inventory allows you to examine and combine items, often with Horatio or Crispin voicing little hints about how an object can best be used. Crispin himself pulls double-duty as a source of hints and a usable object, something you would be wise to remember anytime you spot an item just out of reach. There's also a PDA-type device that tracks important puzzle info and provides a handy map, and while the display is absolutely tiny it gets the job done and is used in some clever ways on its own. At no point did I ever get stuck on any of the puzzles, despite a few that taxed my brain in unexpected ways. There's a really good logic puzzle and a tricky text parser sequence that stood out as high points in the genre, though the overall spread of puzzles is well above average.

There's not much I can level against Primordia, honestly. I mentioned that it's a grim and muddy future but the characters elevate it above that and keep all the gloom to the periphery. While the scope of the game is just as grand as it needs to be, it plays out over a pretty small number of scenes so it might feel smaller than it should. There are also some political overtones that you might not agree with when the multiple endings roll around, which is to be expected from a game whose plot is so steeped in robo-sociology but nevertheless might rub the wrong way. I'm absolutely not going to knock the art, intensely low-res though it is, because the far-future designs of the robots and their environs are absolutely fascinating to behold. The sound design is far more reserved but does what it needs to, and in particular provides some excellent voice acting throughout. Primordia is the total package, an adventure game that challenges and inspires in every aspect from its characters to its puzzles.

Primordia was a wonderful experience, but also very hard to play. The puzzles were quite a challenge and getting all achievements can be tricky, but possible with only one gameplay (as is getting all the endings) but only if you save often.

Players should check everything in the area, try to merge items in their inventories, and listen closely to Crispin's dialogues and hints. 

As for the story, Primordia is very amusing game, with a very great humor and sass, fantastic voice acting and the choice of multiply endings. Not to mention that all the endings have that unique ""I did not see that coming"" aura, and getting them all had been experience. The only thing that players should really pay attention to are dialogues. They contain hints to the future and past events, and only if you listen closely (sometimes they literally tell you what is going on, and you might not even notice it). 

All of the characters are unique. All the robots you find during the play have their own personalities, way of speaking and behaving. Some will consonantly remind your controlled character that you forgot about implementing some very vital parts in their mechanics, or will question your belief in humans and of the current world. You can also help your best mechanical friend and companion to flirt with a lamp, so he can practice before trying it on on a real robot.

I am not a fan of point and click games, but this was just fantastic experience full of fantastic characterization, rich world building and gameplay based on logic, not to mention amazing humor and great dialogues.",1495386714,1512562559,True,1,0,0,2,False,True,False,False,,,

Primordia is set in a post-apocalyptic environment with robotic machines,  you play as Horatio Nullbuilt, a stoic robot who values his solitude and independence. Although due to unforeseen events he has to go to the robot city Metropol, from this adventure he will find out about his own existence, what happened to the human race and the choices he needs to make.

A must own for anyone who love's Point & Click Adventure Games or for gamers who want something different from the mainstream marketplace.

I have plenty of fun with games that require twitch-like reflexes, induce high octane action, and have me screaming and yelling at the screen. This game did none of those, but it did something no other games, in my experience, have. 

It's simply the most thought-provoking game I have ever played. 

The setting and context is beautiful and philosophic. It's not just creative, however, it's also executed to perfection. The voice acting is also incredible, adding on to an already perfect atmosphere that the art style fits seamlessly with. If the protagonist sounds familiar, that is because he (Logan Cunningham) later went on to other famous games such as Bastion and Transistor. He is not by any means the reason this game is good, but again, is an incredibly important element. All in all, everything works. 

Whether you're a fan of the genre, or just trying to pick it up, Primordia is a great choice.

If you don't like pixel graphics, this might not be for you. However I felt Primordia has better pixel usage than other games. You don't need glasses to find the on-screen hotspots. It has bigger pixel region to select the item in game world. 

The story is little bit meh. It's a far future world where human doesn't exist anymore. After creating AI, they are gone. Now AI robots are living in this world, salvaging parts and creating new robots and process goes on. This game is a journey of an ancient robot, made by human and its sidekick, made by AI robot. 

The game doesn't tell why and how human were destroyed (or maybe left the world). There are few petty humor by sidekick which doesn't even matter.

Get this game if you're wadget eye game fan, pixel adventure / point n click fan.

This was one of the coolest Point-and-Click adventures I have experienced in a long while!

I am surprised that this game was so enjoyable, since Blackwell sucked and was a huge disappointment...When I saw Wadjet Eye Games associated I was concerned for the same, but I was compelled by the beautiful art and concept.

I cannot say there was anything in particular I disliked...Not too much back tracking...Great humor...Wonderful characters...Awesome art...great concept...fun puzzles!

This is a must for adventurers!

The graphics looked pixelated, but even giving it some leeway for being fullscreen, they were still a bit too pixelated for my preferences. There seemed to be no antialiasing at all. 

Sometimes the things you have to find, despite having no clue they are supposed to exist, are small objects, blend in very well with the clutter and trash, or are in dark areas and not really visible.  This isn't exactly an uncommon theme with these types of adventure games. 

Still, I rather enjoyed it, and hope the author takes the criticisms to heart and makes an even better game next time.

If you can handle the challenge the game is a very solid adventure from beginning to end. Starts with a simple premise and snowballs the plot through the end. It also offers multiple endings so you can experiment with alternative solutions and choices in consequent playthroughs. The graphics and artstyle offers wonderful atmosphere and character design, but I advise you to play it windowed since the sprites don't transition well in full screen.

The game makes explicit, though with subtle insertion, reference to other  speculative fiction masterpieces from multiple media. Fallout, Half-Life and A Canticle for Liebowitz being the ones I could clearly identify. Furthermore, the development team, usually the writer, provide liner notes revealing the design decisions they made in making this compelling tale.

In case you are interested in why this is important to be mentioned, you can find the original review below. But first for the important point:

This game has the nicest developer I have ever heard of, in my entire life. Although I couldn't enjoy this awesome game as much as I should have, he was friendly and really supportive. This review was intended to be a negative one, but after I was responded it's really not fair to give him a negativ rating. So yes, this is basically a review for the developer, not for Primordia, but I just have to point that out. If you don't believe me, check the other reviews. He literally responded to every single one, even after more than four years of service. ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989271430]Go check him out[/url])

However, so far for this review, every single line under here is what matters according to my view on the game. Thanks for reading until here. [/quote]

[quote]You may hate me for this review, just as a warning.[/quote]
[quote]I know that the pixelart style was created on purpose, but a game doesn¬¥t get good by looking like it¬¥s retro or whatever they meant to. I don¬¥t mean that it¬¥s a bad game, please no, Primordia has a rich story, good gameplay and awesome sound design. But also... bad graphics. I am conscious about this game was intended to look like this and I don¬¥t want to say that Primordia requires cinematic graphics. Point and Click games usually don¬¥t look astonishing, that¬¥s not important for the genre. But in this case it¬¥s a little worse. I am almost sorry that I have to complain about this game, which is nice in all other aspects, but the graphics are what makes Primordia really less enjoyable. Eventually it¬¥s NOT helpful for solving puzzles when all objects look the same and you have to find them by slowly moving your cursor all over the screen, as if this was a hidden-object-game. It¬¥s hard to even recognize the textures and by looking closer you¬¥ll get more confused than you already are. I bought this because I like point ¬¥n click games a lot, and I have to admit that Primordia looked a lot better in the trailer. I wish the developers would have designed this more like Daedalic would have done, instead of Lucas Arts¬¥ way, so that I could enjoy the game. The harder I try, the more I see how pointless it is. Playing such an awesome game is exhausting if you can¬¥t clearly detect important elements. [/quote]

To write a review for this bright gem of adventurous point and clicking is like ignite a dim star on dark hevenly arch which is already littered with thousand brightly shining suns.
Yes.... I know.... my words and sentences will imediately drop down through a grating of review sewage to simply form higher mean value of positive review percentage, BUT!!!!.....

.....I do not mind.... that is how good this game is.

Well for review: Its great, its hand drawn, got great SFX and music, its about robots, its about apocalypse, its about war, about our extinction, but then you find out its also about hope and friendship and like six people that got together and made wonderfull game. (and did not try to rip you off for 50 bucks or so(I got mine for ten!!))

Its really abut much more, but I am confident that you will find out for yourself.

It's got good voice acting.

- robotic steampunk hybrid style (Gotta love them hybrids)
- immersive story telling (they still didn't tell me a bed time story!)
- dragging and clicking the mouse cursor over ever pixel on the screen (It is fun.... . . .  .   .   .    !)
- Multiple endings (You don't really HAVE to save the world!}

- cant stand to see pixels (Under 12 years old?)
- dragging and clicking the mouse cursor over ever pixel on the screen (Is it fun.... . . .  .   .   .    ?)

This is what I WANT from a point and click game.  

a) Beautiful artwork (why?  cause it is a point and click...you need some bang for your buck. Syberia is a great example of this, though it fails in other regards)

b)  Puzzles that are challenging, but intuitive (point-n-clicks RARELY get the 'intuitive part'...I'm looking at you Longest Journey).

c) Good voice acting (if they are not text-based) and dialogue.

d) Memorable characters (yes Myst...your puzzles were lovely, but there was no one there!!!)

e) A cool mechanic (you know, like the time-turning or the pill-popping‚Ä¶ala Fran Bow and others)

f) Consequences (if not, choices are meaningless, and point-n-clicks are the perfect medium for giving players choices that matter).

Given these personal metrics, I must give this game high marks in all categories.  

a) 9/10.  Many folks may disagree. I admit, I was skeptical when I saw screen shots of the game...it looked dated and drab.  But the music and the voice-work mixed with the pixelated brown and reds...somehow it worked beautifully. The style perfectly suited the story.  I thought it was an absolutely beautiful game, with its own unique atmosphere.  Nothing else is quite like it.

b) 8/10 ‚Äì Seriously, this is the first point and click game where I said ‚Äúwell, if I really had these things, this is what I would do‚Äù and lo and behold‚Ä¶it was the solution!!!  Plus, there was a fun mix of number-based, logic-based, and text-based puzzles.  The only downside is that I wish there were more!!  And to be fair, not all were challenging‚Ä¶it is a pretty easy game.  But I was never bored or frustrated, so I consider it a win!

c) 10/10 ‚Äì loved every single voice.  And‚Ä¶I mean‚Ä¶they are robots.  And somehow, this game had better voice acting than 90% of the games out there!

d) 8/10 ‚Äì Loved the leads, loved the sides, loved that one lone guy (*sniff*).  More interaction would have allowed better character development for side characters‚Ä¶but it is just a point and click game after all.  The banter is spot-on!

e) 6/10 ‚Äì you get a sidekick who helps you out. Nothing to write home about‚Ä¶although‚Ä¶to be fair‚Ä¶he is a really awesome sidekick personality-wise!! 

f) Yup.  Consequences and multiple endings.  Woohoo!! (I don‚Äôt want to score this part‚Ä¶just wanted to cheer for the effort!)

Cons?  Not much.  It is a good time for the price. It is a little short‚Ä¶but it is not ‚Äúempty‚Äù.  Ie, I would rather have a short, full game than a long game of needless filler. If you feel the same, buy it!

Buy it!

Long story:

First of all, when you start the game having a 1080p display, the graphics seem extra old, pixelated and just ugly. The reason behind it seems to be the fact that the pixels were drawn by hand. There is a way to ""resize"" the original 300xsomething resolution and get a nice 1200xsth window without losing quality of detail. (Settings are changed using a separate exe file located in the installation folder)

The atmosphere of the game is fantastic. You immerse yourself into a beautifully done post-apocalyptic world filled with dust, junk and characters with their own personalities, thoughts, beliefs and so on. It is a well-thought world based on one of the possible continuations of mankind's history. The game offers multiple completely different endings affected by your interpretation of the world and events around you.

The puzzles are fun to solve, you can get hints if you get stuck and there is only a couple of moments when the solution felt not 100% logical to me personally. The interface needs 5-10 minutes to get completely used to, there is a ""how to play"" option in the menu.

To be short, I believe this game is more than worth the price and provides enough to be recommended to veterans of the genre and people unfamiliar with point-and-clicks alike. Without further ado, let's dive into it.

[h1]Story[/h1]

[i]""Man built us to build, Crispin."" -Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.[/i]

The world of Primordia is one of the most original sci-fi settings I've seen in video games thus far. Humanity is long gone and the almost uninhabitable Earth is populated with robots built by other robots. Very few, if any, remember who humans were. Some worship ""Man, the All-Builder"" in their memory, others believe they were just a myth. Power is scarce in the wasteland and those who still function must do what they can to survive. The nature of the world is shown very well and sets an unforgettable mood for the whole adventure.

[i]""All of this for a b'soding power core!"" -Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.[/i]

The plot starts simply: you, Horatio Nullbuilt, lose the power core of your ship to a mysterious intruder. Facing certain death from slowly running out of power, you pursue the thief and get involved in mysteries far beyond your understanding. The adventure is quite interesting and, while the plot twists are somewhat predictable and the mystery isn't too hard to solve, the tension and tone of the game keep you on your toes, wanting to explore the mysteries of insane ancient robots, Man himself, and a city of glass and light whose promises of free power seem just too good to be true.

[i]""Why is everyone we meet crazy?"" -Crispin Horatiobuilt, version 1[/i]

The characters are by far the most interesting part of the story. Despite being robots, pretty much all of them are relatable and believable. From our sarcastic sidekick Crispin and a devout Humanist preacher named Ever-Faithful to a pair of upper-class robots trying to settle a legal dispute and a warbot who encrypted his own logic to deal with the horrors of the war, the cast is diverse to say the least. There were a few who I've found to be a bit bland and one-sided (Clarity and the main villain for example), but those were few and far between.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

[i]""Are you really trying to build us an energy sensor from a bunch of garbage?""
""Crispin, I built [b]you[/b] from a bunch of garbage.""
""From spare parts, boss! Spare parts!""
-Crispin and Horatio[/i]

The gameplay is standard for the genre: pick up stuff, combine stuff, use stuff to solve puzzles. In addition to that, when you can't reach something yourself or simply need some help, you can use your floating companion Crispin, who also acts as the game's hint system. Perhaps the biggest strength of the game here is that the puzzles integrate well into the story. The hints make sense as actual conversation, the solutions are usually as straight-forward and practical as possible, and the characters react adequately during these situations. There were only one or two cases of ""pixel hunting"" in the whole game so that is a big plus as well.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

[i]""Look at all those lights! It's amazing boss!""
""It's trouble. Trust me.""
""Sweet, sweet trouble.""
-Crispin and Horatio[/i]

The world and the characters are both beautifully crafted. There are many games these days that use pixel art, but Primordia took it as a challenge rather than a cop out. The game is simply gorgeous. The only negative thing I can say about its look is that the characters have very few sprite animations and the reuse becomes noticeable in a few scripted events. The music is similarly amazing. I still remember the track that plays when you read the Gospel of Man. Finally, the voice acting. In case you haven't noticed from the trailer, the voice of Horatio Nullbuilt is Logan Cunningham, the main voice actor in Transistor and Bastion. His work is as top notch as it is in those games and the other VAs are quite good as well. All in all, presentation is one of the game's strongest points, perhaps even more so than the story.

[h1]Possible negatives[/h1]

[i]""It jes needs a little fixin' up, tyro."" -L.S.[/i]

- The game is quite short. Depending on how much you explore and how quick you are with the puzzles, it will most likely take you between 6 and 10 hours to complete.
- There are some technical difficulties. The game forces you to a pretty low resolution due to the engine limitations and alt-tabbing can cause voice over to break. Also some of the achievements may be bugged. A few people reported not getting achievements when they should, I on the other hand got a final achievement while still missing two very important parts of the ending.
- You can solve a few of the puzzles in a multitude of ways, but these ""choices"" may have long-lasting consequences that are not properly telegraphed.
- Most puzzles are logical but a few are still obscure. For example, the game never tells you that something inside your inventory can be disassembled.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

All in all, Primordia is a great game with a fantastic story and amazing presentation. The not too difficult gameplay might leave a few veterans of the genre slightly disappointed, but it makes the game accessible for people not usually interested in point-and-clicks as well, and the story more than makes up for it anyway. While the game is short, the price is very generous and I'd say Primordia uses the play time it does have very well. This one is a definite recommendation from me.

The game is exacly what the store page leads to belive, and than some more.
The game is not too short, like some other games in the genre. There is enough content to enjoy.
The puzzles are not very hard, but also not completely obvious. The art style is robust but very good!
The voice acting is falwless. And The game is filled with (mostly sarcastic) humor. Humor is difficult to do right, but I assure you this game is done just right!
You can tell work and love was put into this game. It wasn't made in one day, so to say.
The storyline progresses as you progress in the game, keeping the game even more interesting. I find the story original and interesting. Not predictable, but once you progress it makes sens. A good storyline!

There is something truly unique and amazing about this game, and if you're reading this and wondering whether or not you should buy it, let me give you the rundown.

Excellent:
-The story is compelling, and populated with incredibly unique characters. One of my favorites is a fairly minor character that speaks in a religious cadence, and it's just such a cool little scene, it really stuck with me.
-The characters are diverse and incredibly easy to become attached to. They are so well written, that you could name a character from hearing just a TINY snippet of their dialogue.
-There are some truly genius puzzles here that absolutely blew me away. 
-The art is pretty breathtaking. The whole game feels alien and strange, but a familiar shadow seems to hang over it. It's just fucking great.

Meh:
-The voice acting for both Horatio and Crispin, the two main characters, is a little...off. Horatio I kind of got used to, and his monotone drone ended up being more part of his personality than anything, but Crispin has some pretty well-written lines that are delivered pretty awkwardly, and I found him pulling me back out of the game a little bit every so often. That being said, Crispin is delightful, if a tad annoying.
-Some of the puzzles are absolutely rediculous, with some of them being outright pixelhunting. With as intelligent as the rest of the game is, it makes these puzzles even HARDER, because you expect the answer to make more sense. For instance (No spoilers here, don't worry.)
     There is a part of the game where your path is impeded, and the answer is the first thing that comes to your mind: ""Crispin should just move that."" And that is, indeed, the answer to that quandry.
     There's a part where you need to find an item, but you aren't told where it can be found or where to start. Had to resort to a walkthrough on this one, because the answer lay in a very cluttered, dark area of the screen. You never think ""This game will resort to pixel hunting"", because the rest of the game is just...too well thought out.

So most of my complaints are ""Come on, Primordia, you're BETTER than this!"", which should absolutely tell you something. How this isn't a HUGELY known game is beyond me.

It's a PCA (Point and Click Adventure). No actual puzzles, just good old-school inventory combining and environment clicking!

Graphics:     8/10 (Sub-HD resolution. All the scenes, characters and animations are VERY well drawn/animated.)

Sound:       10/10 (Fully voiced, fully music'd, and it's all high-quality. Doesn't get better!)

Interface:     9/10 (Art'ed menus that fit the game; intuitive and minimalistic.)

Story:           8/10 (Engaging, entertaining, fascinating and everything is tied together. Nice!)

Characters:  9/10 (Horatio reminds me of Ben from Full Throttle. Crispin is quite entertaining, deep ""B"" listers, too!)

Toughness:  5/10 (Security through Obscurity. Score with autohints off. Discworld = 10/10, for reference).

Length:        7/10 (Took me 12h to beat without hints. I liked it and didn't want it to end!)

Overall:        9/10 (Great fun if you like PCAs, post-apocalyptic themes, robots, and a fun 
sidekick!)

My heater was broken, it was freezing outside. But this wonderful adventure had hooked me. The world is one of the best-presented I've ever seen. The characters are very well presented to make you curious for more. I just wanted to spend more time exploring this world. It's also filled with humor that lightens up the somber setting, it's difficult to explain just how well the combination works.

The puzzles themselves vary in quality, with some doing a great job in feeling like you're just solving problems that would exist in the world rather than an arbitrary roadblock by the developers. Others... Not so much. One particular puzzle stands out as an example of this problem (slight spoiler warning, though I won't give the answer)

You need two different objects that can obstruct a vent. The first is easily gained by cutting off the tip of a robot's finger. However, the game doesn't allow you to cut off the tip of another finger for the second item. This is a frustrating limitation, and can easily lead to resenting the puzzle. The fact that important objects are often indistinguishable from the background only adds to the frustration.

HOWEVER, and I can't stress this enough, while this kind of uneven quality in puzzles should suck the fun out of an adventure game... It doesn't. The rest of the world is too entrancing. It single-handedly rekindled my love of adventure games. I bring up these drawbacks to help emphasize how truly great the rest of the experience is, that even these issues don't sour it.

TLDR; If you're considering buying this game, do so. Do it now. Play it. Enjoy it. Have fun.

A very classic-feeling adventure game with a perfect blend of science fiction and noir - and not the watered-down versions you might be used to, I mean think classics, the genre-defining stuff people still remember from 50+ years ago. As a fan of both, I was very satisfied. It's a smart story excellently told with top-notch writing and art. Kudos to the devs for having the game run in super-low resolution - no accidental ruining of the retro feel by hi-res glows or particle effects. You want retro? This is retro. The art direction is consistent right down to the screen resolution.

As a game... not so much. See, it's an adventure game, and that means exactly what you think it means. Personally, I bought it for half-off and after the first 40 minutes or so I opened up a guide - so much more enjoyable! The writing is witty, the world-building is amazing, the story unfolds with perfect timing... why be bogged down with ""find the hidden active zone in the dozen screens you have access to"" or ""use X on Y in order to use X, Y, and Z together, no other combination works""? Those games are dumb. When you actually have all the items and clues the puzzles are usually not stupid, but you never really know if you do - the fundamental failing of adventure games. Don't put yourself through that just to get at the good stuff. Keep a walkthrough open and peek at it any time you're starting to get the slightest doubt on how to proceed.

I am not the kind of person who usually goes into games for storytelling, but I am a sucker for sci-fi and an even bigger sucker for noir, so this was totally worth it. If I'd known how good a time I would have I might have even paid full price! If any of what I wrote sounded interesting and you have the time to kill, it's definitely worth at least the price of a movie ticket.",1483169573,1483212331,True,2,0,0.501333355903625488,3,True,False,False,False,,,

As a point-and-click storybook game, Primordia does not dissappoint. It's smart, well-illustrated, and presents a compelling story. The writers took care to build an internally consistent world complete with mythology and believable motives. It's a world I would not be dissappointed to return to in a follow-up title. 

There is an obvious retro-feel that permeates not only the art style, but also the story and game-mechanic. Primordia's writing reminds me of 1980s robot sci-fi including a few text-based games from that era. The art is clearly influenced by visual work from that period including Lynch's Dune. There are multiple endings, and I enjoyed that the best of them still presented a dark and morally clouded set of choices for the main character.

The only criticism I have of Primordia is the same criticism I have of similar point-and-click games; many of the inventory combinations and item uses are not intuitive and are occassionally inconsistent. Also, while the side-kick character was a wise choice for an in-game hint system, his personality occassionally feels out of place. FYI: There were also 2 achievements which I believe I met the criteria for but did not recieve. Probably not a bug, but other reviewers have had the same problem.",1483125839,1483125839,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It could be a little bit longer maybe but I guess I can still give it a second run later - with the developer commentary turned on and with trying to find out the solution for a few ""side stories"" i missed.  Puzzles and solutions did make sense which was quite refreshing. In a whole game there was only one point where I really needed to look the solution up*.

Sometimes the game engine is a little choppy, especially in scenes with parallax scrolling attempts, which is funny with all the power computers have nowadays. I see the 320*200 -ish resolution is kind of intentional ""retro style"" but the engine does not have to :). After seeing some concept art which obviously was not low-res I even wonder whether it would harm the game If it was made in high resolution... The current result is still fine. So, I guess it was not the worst decision anyway.

All in all, a very good adventure game. With the current Steam sale price any adventure games lover should give it a try.

Only machines remain, struggling to survive in the junk-filled wastelands. The protagonist will have to face many challenges in order to retrieve his source of power, gradually learning about the hidden thruth of his world along the way.

The gameplay is very simple, as is every other adventure game: you'll have to explore, find and combine multiple items and use them at the right places to progress. What separates this game from the others is it's theme and its great humor. The last being delivered by a lovable sidekick who also serves the purpose of a hint bot. The puzzles are clever and challenging but not impossibly hard. 

The story is filled with rich and interesting lore, but is very linear (except at the very end, where you have multiple endings available). Each dialogue feels thought out and unique.

The graphics are very reminiscent to those of Fallout 1: pixelated and low-resolution with dark brownish tones, which is tolerable since they seemed to be aiming for the retro theme. The only exception is the handful of brief cutscenes presenting very detailled close-ups of the action, which help with the immersion. The soundtrack is atmospheric and blends well with the setting. The voice acting is truely amazing.

There's even some replayability value for those who wish try the commentary mode.

Primordia ist ein klassisches Point&Click Game im Retro Stil der fr√ºhen 90er Jahre. Die Handlung entwickelt sich durch das L√∂sen von R√§tseln, kombinieren von n√ºtzlichen Gegenst√§nden, sowie den Entscheidungen √ºber das falsche oder richtige Handeln. 

Worum gehts?
Der mysteri√∂se Android Horatio und sein kleiner Gehilfe Crispin durchstreifen ein postapokalyptisches Szenario in einer W√ºste. Woher sie kommen und welches Ziel sie verfolgen bleibt ungekl√§rt. Was ist mit dieser ehemals fortschrittlichen Welt passiert, von der nur Ruinen √ºbrig geblieben sind? Und welche Entscheidung f√ºhren die Beiden Freude an Ihr eigentliches Ziel?

POSITIV: 
+ detaillierte Szenarios
+ guter Soundtrack
+ d√ºstere Atmosph√§re
+ super (!) Synchro
+ fein ausgefeilte Charaktere
+ Spiel l√§uft fl√ºssig, gute Steuerung, jederzeit speicherbar

NEGATIV: 
- keine deutsche Vertonung, schade
- frustrierende R√§tsel, ziemlich knifflig
- Das Volumen der Musik kann nur bedingt reguliert werden, Volumen ist manchmal schlecht abgemischt. 

FAZIT: 
Ein wirklich sch√∂nes Spiel mit viel Atmosph√§re und einer interessanten Handlung. Die Dialoge haben mich oft zum lachen gebracht weil Horatio und Crispin ein wunderbares Team sind (was sich liebt das neckt sich). Als alter Hase darf ich das sagen: die 90er Atmosph√§re wirkt NICHT aufgesetzt, ganz im Gegenteil. Ich habe mich dabei erwischt wie ich das Release Datums des Spiels √ºberpr√ºft habe, um sicher zu gehen. 
Das einzige was mich frustriert hat waren die kn√ºppelharten R√§tsel. Nachdem ich Stunden umher geirrt bin habe ich einen Blick in die Ausl√∂sung geworfen nur um fest zu stellen dass ich da wohl nie selbst drauf gekommen w√§re... dies ist jedoch ein sehr pers√∂nlicher Kritikpunkt.

But wow, I wasn't expecting it to be [i]that[/i] great, either.

Obviously, most of the reviewers around here have already described the game much better than a non-native English speaker ever could, though it never hurts to praise a masterpiece. And as with any other masterpiece, it doesn't seem necessary to break it down to individual components and discuss whether the mechanics lack gunplay. The only thing that matters here is the feeling, what it's like to live through the story of Primordia.

You know when you're close to finishing a book so good you almost don't want to read the last few pages? It's as if a significant part of your life is about to be taken, and you try to savor every single word there's left. Oh boy, I still remember the devastation I felt as a kid when 'Pippi Longstocking' ended. [spoiler](don't judge me, I love that book)[/spoiler] A horrible yet extremely satisfying moment of experiencing something beautiful and important. And it's exactly what a quality adventure game should be ‚Äì a book you will never forget.

Primordia bears this very feeling in its core logic. Its world, consisting of rust and despair, might not be of the attractive kind, but the minute you dive into it, you'll have enough reasons to stay. It is surprisingly smart, detailed, vivid and, even less expectedly, highly amusing thanks to the characters populating it. Despite the depressing tones, the amount of intelligent humour makes it one of the most likeable worlds in the recent adventure games history.

No wonder leaving it is incredibly hard. I found myself thinking, ""This is not enough! Why would you end it so soon? I want more!"" and loading random saves to listen to random dialogues once again. But while Primordia surely is a short experience, I doubt making it longer would've made any difference. You just can't have enough of worlds like this one. 

Primordia is indeed a hidden gem of the genre. Well, not really hidden anymore, but it definitely is something that deserves more attention. Every piece of attention you can afford, to be precise.

[i] Primordia [/i] is here to answer that question. This amazing point-and-click game takes place on a dystopian Earth at an unspecified point in history. The few humans that remain have fled underground, living in low-g bunkers and looking at a once-green Earth through pictures and little garden chambers. Over the years, we have faded into myth, and now the Earth is ruled by our creations, some of who worship our memory as a creed called ""Humanism.""

You are Horatio Nullbuilt, a wasteland-dwelling robot of undeterminate origin whose only companion is Crispin Horatiobuilt, a floating, armless robot with an endless supply of sarcastic remarks. Together, they lived a pretty uneventful life. They were trying to fix up a crashed airship, a relic of the long-forgotten War of the Four Cities, so they could at last fly away from the Dunes and go wherever they want. Unfortunately, their progress is halted when a mysterious robot named Scraper shows up and ""plunders"" their power core--an item they cannot survive without. When trying to find power in the Dunes fails, they have no choice but to travel to Metropol, the last city, where their power core has been taken. To make matters worse, an anceint robot named MetroMind has claimed your power core for the betterment of the city, since it is crumbling under her inept rule and she needs all the power she can get.

From there, it is up to you how the story ends. Choose carefully, your every move has consequences.

The voice-acting is masterfully done. Every character is unique and full of personality. The story and lore are very well-crafted as well. Unraveling the mystery of the world you're in never fails to be fascinating, and if you play through it just right, the ending is beautiful and cathartic.

On the surface it's an old shool point-and-click adventure, but the story, the voice acting, the art and the setting are simply amazing.

Set in a post-apocalyptic world where machines have became sentient and capable of build (and re-build) themselves.
In this world, humans are only a fading memory, kept in partially corrupted data gathered by some and spread in a form of a religion.
Most of the world is now covered by the desert, where most of the androids live in a single huge city.
This is the background where Horatio, the protagonist, starts its (his?) journey to find a stolen component of his ship, revealing part of his (and our) past in the process.

It is a classic point & click adventure game set a in post-apocalyptic world with stunning and handcrafted pixel art, outstanding narration and one of the most atmospheric soundtracks you will ever encounter.[/b]

[h1]Graphics:[/h1] Each place you visit during the game offers very well-drawn and thematic pixel art with a good animation quality. More importantly, everything offers a feel of authenticity, which keeps you immersed in this post-apocalyptic sci-fi world.

[h1]Sound, Music & Voice:[/h1] The soundeffects are very decent for a point & click game. What really outshines all else are the soundtrack and the narration. The soundtrack is the most immersive and fitting I've ever encountered in this genre. It has around 40 (!) different tracks, which is very rare to see for such a game. The narration of the two main characters is very well done and their lines vary between fitting, serene and often amusing. In fact, it was so well done that I had to listen to the hints despite having solved a puzzle, just to hear all they had to say!

[h1]Gameplay & Story:[/h1] You control two robot companions, stranded in a post-apocalyptic world, where man has perished and become a myth. Your task is to solve different puzzles in the typical point & click style. Your goal is to repair your broken down ship and leave this world. You will visit different locations within the gameworld to find objects and solve puzzles which consist in many cases of applying one or two items to a certain location. Many of the puzzles are challenging but fair. Only for a few I had to go 'pixel hunting' and click everything on the screen to find what I was looking for. Should you have trouble solving a puzzle, your trusty robot companion at your side will always have a few hints for you ready!
The world is incredibly well built and the story kept me glued to the screen until I reached one of the many endings after around 12 hours.

[h1]Funfactor:[/h1] I enjoyed this game more than any other point & click adventure game I have ever played. In my opinion it even outshines the well praised Machinarium. Minor gripes were some technical issue while trying to launch the game for the first time.

It's a point and click adventure game with an older sprite style and more detailed Giger-esque backgrounds. Overall I would reccomend it.

Pros:
>Good story - robot society after humans are gone
>Variety of characters with personality
>Easy to get around - you can walk and you have a map that teleports you to key spots.
>Puzzle quality and variety - From building tools to opening doors to judging court cases I can't think of a point that really struck me as needing unintuitive logic to solve.
>Hint system - robot buddy that you can ask for puzzle suggestions, usually helpful
>Takes notes for you - game jots down important information for you, which can help for puzzles. Couple spots you might still need pen and paper to work something out, though.
>Hot keys for menu stuff
>Does a good job getting into your thought processes - a few puzzles with multiple solutions, some puzzles animated to let you try something even though it doesn't actually work.
>Flavor text - if you like subtle characterization and banter, you can look at most everything for description stuff.
>Multiple saves - Save whenever you want however much you like.

Cons:
>Can't easily get out of item use - have to go into inventory to get your regular cursor back (hot key makes it bearable)
>Some pixel hunting - at least one puzzle where you need to notice a small, muddy colored item in a dark, muddy colored area
>Hints aren't always helpful - sometimes it hints what you know you need to find, not how or where to find it. Other times it's so obtuse that it's really no help at all.
>One or two puzzles that use a game feature only once - ran into one that required using the describe feature, which I didn't know was there and which had never been necessary to get info about items or progress puzzles before then.
>Loading issue - due to the chosen game engine, can't load saves past your 20th most recent save. Have to delete saves to get the one you want in that 1-20 section.",1477965492,1478019571,True,1,0,0,1,False,True,False,False,,,

-Nice puzzels

The controls are simple, just point and click, getting into inventory is simple as moving my mouse up to see it and if I ever feel lost what to do next, I just need to ask someone what they would do.

This game also feature the multiple endings, but I don't know yet how much there is since I did play for couple of hours.

If my review is pretty confusing, I don't blame you.
When I review MY reviews, I'm thinking myself: ""What was I talking about""
So I put some pros, neutrals and cons with reasons on this game.

PROS
+ Art style
It has nice pixel art style like those old school point and click games and I like the designs of the characters and others

+ Voice acting
Like any other point and click games (or any games) they have voice acting and they sound pretty good or even well done in my opinion, especially Crispin being sarcastic and mostly paranoid about like giant cannibal robot.

+ Good sidekick
Like I said about Crispin, I like his charming punchlines and sarcastic nature.
He also is reliable on certain area where you need get something or get somewhere, he even give some ideas what to do next

+ Puzzles
Who doesn't like puzzles, not you?
Then why did you pick this game, if you don't like puzzles?
Anyway, this game mostly puzzle on certain parts where you have to either combine, poke with it, ask or anything else and this game is not like you can get stuck forever, you just need to think about what would you do or first gather info and then figure it out or ask Crispin what would he do on that, not like he straightforward tells you, but suggest something.

+Robots
It's about robots

NEUTRALS
= Story
This game has that simple story, I wont spoil anything else, but the beginning, you are Horatio who is trying to rebuild the crashed ship to fly with it, but then some big unknown floating robot comes to ship, shoots you and steal your power core, after that you woke up and decided to do something about it.
Welp, I'm not usually care about the story, but it is huge part of this game, but I don't usually follow it or even ""know"" does story make good sense, so that's why I put it as neutral because... I'm terrible to review the story part.

= glitchs and bugs
there are some minor bugs and glitch on this game, but it's not severe or annoying, it's just there and it wont stop you to continue to play this game, just some quick freezing that you almost don't notice all the time and other rare glitches.

CONS
- Games length
I do admit, it does make the game longer since you have to figure out the puzzles, but when you finish the game on first time, you just know almost all of it and you can just blow this game maybe almost under of hour, unless you think there is still something missing in it.

CONCLUSION
I really like this game, too bad it is short, but it did took me over 5 hour to pass it first time and it is pretty addicting since I did played nonstop from 22:00 PM to 4:30 AM.
It has only one cons in my opinion and that is not even a huge problem and I think this game pretty great since art style is beautiful and progression interesting on it.

In other words, this game is worth for your attention if you like point and click games.

Welp, that's all for now.

I grew up playing point&click adventure games, and I played pretty much all of the 90's classics, so unfortunatly nowadays it can be quite hard for me to find a game that keeps up with the expectations I have for this kind of games but I can tell you that Primordia is on par with the best games of this genre. 
It's a blast of joy and nostalgia to play a title like this that makes me feel like a kid again exploring a new awesome unknown world.

Primordia has a Beneath a Steel Sky vibe to it that instantly got me hooked, but even if you didn't play any of the older point&click titles Primordia would be a great place to start because it's so damn charming!

The story of the game is engaging and well-written, the soundtrack and voice-acting is great, the characters are memorable and make you feel attached to them.
The game puzzles are not too hard but they offer a good challenge, although this may vary from person to person depending on the experience you have with this genre.

The only downside I can think of is that the game is a bit short but the multiple endings and achievements give Primordia a good degree of replayabilty that other games lack.

This game is a MUST-PLAY, and I just want to thank Wormwood Studios and Wadjet Eye Games for this amazing experience.",1475877978,1480108858,True,6,0,0.584905624389648438,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The past years I haven't had much patience for these kinds of games (even though I used to love them) mostly because I can rarely get engaged enough with the story and characters to keep playing and paying attention to long conversations. In Primordia every single piece of dialogue is very interesting and mysterious, revealing more about the world and its history, or it's just plain witty and funny. The puzzles are great too, very intuitive most of the time. The hint system is pretty good too, not breaking immersion and sometimes just the right push in the right direction.

A tem√°tica do jogo √© p√≥s-apocal√≠ptica, toda a humanidade foi exterminada da face da terra e tudo o que sobrou foram os rob√¥s que os seres humanos constru√≠ram, e tamb√©m os rob√¥s que foram constru√≠dos por outros rob√¥s. Os pr√≥prios rob√¥s s√£o a √∫nica for√ßa na terra que os mant√©m sobre opera√ß√£o, eles se auto reparam e at√© constroem outros rob√¥s a partir de partes de coletadas dos escombros e lixo do mundo. Como o menos complexo e menos avan√ßado n√£o pode gerar o mais complexo e  mais avan√ßado, isso gera uma cadeia de degenera√ß√£o em que os rob√¥s v√£o ficando mais decr√©pitos e desgastados com cada gera√ß√£o conforme eles pr√≥prios caminham, lentamente, para serem tamb√©m finalmente apagados da exist√™ncia junto de seus criadores humanos.

Voc√™ experiencia a est√≥ria atrav√©s dos olhos de (Ou o termo correto seriam receptores oculares?) Horatio Nullbuilt, um rob√¥ eremita que habita uma aeronave destru√≠da no meio do deserto. O objetivo de Horatio √© restaurar sua nave, ele tem o sonho de voar, mas o n√∫cleo de for√ßa da nave √© roubado de Horatio por um rob√¥ coletador; Scrapper. Nisso Horatio √© for√ßado a perseguir esse inimigo para tentar recuperar seu n√∫cleo de for√ßa, vital para tanto o funcionamento da nave como para o abastecimento de energia do pr√≥prio Horatio, sem o n√∫cleo Horatio pararia de funcionar.

O jogo tem um ambiente pesado e triste, a arte do jogo tem uma qualidade muito alta; os personagens e o plano de fundo dos ambientes s√£o todos muito bem desenhados, o jogo tem toda uma est√©tica bem original e muito bonita. Toda essa qualidade nas ilustra√ß√µes do jogo refor√ßam a atmosfera s√≥lida de tristeza e desola√ß√£o que o jogo exala.

Essa qualidade est√©tica do jogo sofre, todavia, n√£o por erros do desenhista das sprites e background arts; mas sim por limites relacionados a engine do jogo. Como eu mencionei, Primordia foi feito na Adventure Game Studio e essa engine √© muito antiga e tem limita√ß√µes muito extremas para os padr√µes atuais, a mais gritante delas sendo a resolu√ß√£o de tela muito baixa. Durante as cutscenes em que o foco se aproxima mais do personagens √© poss√≠vel ver claramente como a qualidade da arte do jogo √© muito maior do que a baixa resolu√ß√£o nativa nos permite enxergar.

Apesar da premissa deprimente de Primordia, o tom geral dele √© muito menos ""pra baixo"" do que ele poderia ter sido. H√° tamb√©m muitos momentos c√¥micos entrela√ßados na hist√≥ria gra√ßas aos di√°logos entre o personagem principal, Horatio, e o seu fiel companheiro que ele pr√≥prio construiu; Crispin. Enquanto Horatio faz o papel do personagem mais s√©rio, Crispin √© o personagem mais engra√ßado que faz varios coment√°rios engra√ßados sobre os eventos e outros personagens os quais os nossos her√≥is encontram durante sua aventura. Esse tom de com√©dia ajuda muito a aliviar o peso da premissa do jogo, tanto para o bem e para mal que isso implica.

Os personagens do jogo s√£o todos eles muito interessantes e bem escritos. Crispin, por exemplo, recebe atrav√©s do arco de sua hist√≥ria majoritariamente marcada por momentos engra√ßados um desenvolvimento surpreendentemente s√©rio e heroico no final. A pr√≥pria antagonista do jogo √© um personagem bem equilibrado no sentido de que, apesar de suas a√ß√µes parecerem mal√©volas a primeira vista, ela tem raz√µes l√≥gicas e razo√°veis para agir da forma que age e faz v√°rios argumentos at√© bem fundados.

Existem muitos outros personagens √∫nicos e memor√°veis no jogo tamb√©m, mas o que pessoalmente mais me cativou foi um que participou muito pouco da hist√≥ria, o apropriadamente nomeado; Sad Robot. Ele √© um rob√¥ de programa√ß√£o aparentemente corrompida, ou extremamente simpl√≥ria, que espera solit√°rio e paciente por algo que nunca vai acontecer e √© imposs√≠vel fazer ele perceber e entender isto. Achei ele algo metaf√≥rico da condi√ß√£o humana.

De fato os personagens que povoam o mundo do jogo brilham tanto que ofuscam o personagem principal. O Horatio, personagem principal, em si pode at√© n√£o ser o personagem mais interessante da trama, mas enquanto protagonista; enquanto her√≥i, a√≠ sim ele pode ser tamb√©m visto sobre angulos interessantes quando comparado com os her√≥is de outros v√≠deo games. Horatio √© quase um anti-her√≥i, ele n√£o est√° afim de aventura, ele n√£o quer salvar o mundo, ele n√£o usa da for√ßa bruta e nunca parte pra briga, ele n√£o tem interesse em matar nenhum vil√£o; ele √© simplesmente algu√©m que quer sobreviver e restaurar a sua aeronave, para completar ambos esses objetivos ele precisa resgatar um item que lhe foi roubado.

A est√≥ria do jogo √© definitivamente o ponto mais forte, ela √© marcada por personagens carism√°ticos e √∫nicos. A atmosfera do jogo √© segurada bem firmemente pela alta qualidade da m√∫sica e da arte visual e do voice acting, e o conjunto desses elementos √© algo que fortalece ainda mais o efeito de uma est√≥ria que por si s√≥ j√° √© interessante e bem escrita. Analisando ela do come√ßo ao fim √© poss√≠vel ver como ela foi bem pensada e tamb√©m bem realizada, os eventos s√£o amarrados de maneira muito boa atrav√©s da trama, coisas que os personagens dizem no come√ßo da aventura se tornam muito mais significantes √† luz dos eventos no final do jogo. Os mon√≥logos que os personagens lan√ßam nos v√°rios finais poss√≠veis s√£o altamente reflexivos e bem escritos e refletem bem a perspetiva dos personagens atrav√©s dos eventos que se passaram. Se trata obviamente de uma est√≥ria que foi escrita com muito amor e esmero.

Os √∫nicos pontos verdadeiramente negativos que eu tenho contra o game est√£o contidos no seu gameplay: At√© os melhores games point-and-click sempre tem esse ou aquele quebra-cabe√ßa que n√£o faz sentido absolutamente nenhum, geralmente resultado de o jogador ter que usar de uma solu√ß√£o que requer uma l√≥gica totalmente absurda que s√≥ fez sentido na cabe√ßa do designer. √â nesse quebra-cabe√ßa maldito em que voc√™ vai agarrar e n√£o conseguir progredir mais na hist√≥ria sem consultar um 'walkthrough' na internet. Quando voc√™ tem que fazer isso, voc√™ inevitavelmente se sente menos investido no gameplay do jogo. O Primordia em si faz at√© um bom trabalho em impedir que o jogador tenha que consultar a internet para se desagarrar de um puzzle, faz isso usando um sistema de dicas atrelado ao seu parceiro Crispin. Todavia, houve um puzzle relacionado a um terminal em que eu simplesmente n√£o vi l√≥gica absolutamente nenhuma e a dica que o Crispin deu em rela√ß√£o a ele foi praticamente in√∫til, mesmo depois de ter olhado a solu√ß√£o na internet eu ainda fiquei sem ver como √© que o designer do puzzle esperava que eu fosse adivinhar a solu√ß√£o.

Primordia definitivamente tem a minha recomenda√ß√£o, se trata de um cl√°ssico moderno dos point-and-click, mas o que mais brilha nele n√£o √© qualquer coisa inerente ao g√™nero point-and-click ou mesmo aos video games, o que brilha nele √© o seu enredo; ele conta uma hist√≥ria que seria ador√°vel em qualquer meio. √â um jogo que ""passa por baixo do radar"", n√£o recebe o reconhecimento e aten√ß√£o que realmente merece, mas os poucos que conhecem ele sabem que se trata de uma obra-prima, um cult-classic (n√£o √© atoa que o mesmo est√° entre os 100 jogos mais bem avaliados da Steam). Primordia, apesar de n√£o ser t√£o conhecido hoje, sem d√∫vida ser√° vindicado pela hist√≥ria. Daqui a vinte anos muitos poucos se lembrar√£o dos jogos de grandes t√≠tulos que hoje muito vendem tais como Halo ou Gears of War, mas quem jogou Primordia, dele se lembrar√°.",1475722707,1475722707,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,8,False,False,False,False,,,

You will guide Horatio Nullbuilt through the futuristic, rusty dystopian wasteland known as Primordia. Horatio, and his floating comic-relief sidekick Crispin, need to get their stolen power core back; either that, or face death when their charges run dry and they shut down. They soon find out that getting their power core back is the least of their worries, as there's an entire city known as Metropol that's run by a corrupted master computer.

As you wander the lonely, desolate landscape of Primordia, you will come across many robots to interact with. Some of them are self-aware, some of them utter their pre-programmed responses, some will become friends, and some will be enemies. Man has ceased to exist for many years, though the exact timeframe is undetermined, but long enough for them to have vanished into legend. Horatio is a believer in Humanism, a religion that sees man as god; he even carries his copy of the Gospel of Man with him. The story is absolutely stunning, and the same can be said for the dialogue; I will forego delving any further into either so that you may truly enjoy the experience for yourself.

This is another point and click title that is obscure in its puzzle solving. There are many times that you will need an item which is hidden in a place that you'd never think to look. For people like me that completely suck with even the simple point and clicks, a guide will absolutely be necessary. However, for more advanced enthusiasts of the genre, you're in for a real challenge and treat. Every puzzle is a ""think outside the box"" type, and very few are expected or familiar. Even a large portion of the achievements are enigmatic. With a guide, you're looking at about 5-6 hours of playtime, without one you'll easily approach 10 hours.

The artwork of Primordia is done in a monochromatic rusty theme, for the most part consisting of dark browns and dirty oranges. There are subtle glimpses of neon reds and blues, and some places that are steel grey, but they're few and far between. The art does a fantastic job in bringing out the feeling that everything is coated in thick layers of rust, dirt, and sand, and that humans have been dead for centuries. Likewise, the pockmarks on Horatio and many other characters and places conveys the likelihood of near-constant acid rain. The melancholic, dismal, void-of-life atmosphere of the title is both exceedingly strong and somehow calming. The soundtrack is comprised of ambient, semi-industrial tracks that compliment the art wonderfully.

If you've been holding off on grabbing Primordia, stop waiting and just go for it. You simply cannot rob yourself of a detailed, highly immersive experience such as this one. Truly one of the greatest point and click adventure games of the modern era, Primordia is the complete package; visuals, audio, enjoyable characters, story, dialogue, and challenging gameplay. Even though it's a steal at $10.99 CAD, you can also find it on sale for $2.19 CAD at times, either one is a huge bargain.

If the writer reads this not that I minded the ending but I think the twist would have had even more punch if Horus had followed through with his mission instead of Metromind carrying it out, big bad being the big bad is not as fun of a twist as the good guy was the bad guy. Would have made the final choice more interesting and a more interesting realization for the player ""I'm a humanist trying to save humanity but I killed them?"", my two cents as a wannabe writer, was still good though

I have to admit that I didn't fully enjoy Primordia on my recently finished first playthrough (there will be more) - it started excellent so the further into the story I got, the more I was waiting for it to disappoint me. But it didn't. 

It's somewhat ironic, that game so ""retro"" - from it's visual form, through mechanics, to themes - feels so fresh. After playing so many contemporary adventure and semi-adventure games it's nice to see that there are people who don't see stories just as shiny boxes filled with emotions. Instead of killing some characters who got a lot of screen time to make viewer shed a tear and considering job well done, Primordia focuses on building an atmosphere, allowing emotions to occur naturally, and, what is recently rare in storytelling, tells a story. Rather than having a bunch of characters hoping from place to place pushed by expendable plot, the game has a topic which it wills to explore.

I might say, that Primordia is philosophical, that it's meditating upon metaphysical themes, but we may not quite understand each other, since the meaning of word ""philosophical"" has devalued. The game isn't trying to make some ""social commentary"" or present a political concept, but it asks fundamental questions, questions that, one may say, are ancient. But, as a (great) poet once said, only weighty ideals live long enough to be called ancient.

Every element of Primoridia harmonizes with each other. Unique and rich world isn't original only for originality's sake - a wasteland world where robot's seek their raison d'√™tre, a city ideologically based on vague and hollow Progress, a court where the judge has two advisers - justice and mercy, the Gospel of Man which was given to robots by their creators... Primordia becomes more like a biblical parable than a typical belletristic story.

The meaning of life, the wonder of existence, presence of evil in the world, relationship between creation and creator, between robots and man, between man and God - Primordia not only mentions these themes, but also discusses them. It reminds us why people used to tell each other stories. It was because they had something to say.",1472571986,1472571986,True,7,0,0.587076187133789063,2,False,False,False,False,,,

In general, Primordia creates a powerful discourse about justice, law, charity, industry and energy, community and knowledge, energy and history. Most importantly, about logic and free will. As a player, you are brought to wander in an environment that is partially an echo of men's life, partially an odd representation of robotic life, where to the decay of humanity is counterposed the need for energy of the last city on earth. Every knowledge is lost in the dust, and Metropol, the city where the two protagonists will find themselves in, is a ghost city whose only side still provided with energy is a long road.

Much like in the movie Tron, the main character is a robot with a mission he forgot. A mission given by his own creator, Man.

Primordia is a point-and-click adventure game by Wormwood Studios. The main character is a robot with amnesia, but made for a very significant purpose. It is still his choice to fulfill this purpose. He can be a faithful warrior that defeats the evil progressive mind and unites the robots, or he can run away from it. In the game, the robots live under a totalitarian secularist regime, where the belief that the machines were created by a mysterious being called Man is forbidden. His faith in Man keeps the protagonist alive. It is a very interesting twist for the cyberpunk genre.

The graphics are beautiful, as well as the soundtrack. The voice acting is complete and very well done. The voice of Crispin is the best. The dialogues are funny and the developers opted for a more dynamic gameplay, allowing the player to engage in the story without huge dialogues.

One of the advantages is a map that saves the player a good time that would be wasted wandering around. Another advantage is the ""automatic notes"", which saves you the trouble of writing down important information. There are several ways to solve the puzzles, and the developers sought to avoid puzzles that are incoherent with the setting. There is a great internal system for tips, preventing players from getting stuck.

If you like games like Beneath a Steel Sky, or games that allow you to immerse in an engaging and deep atmosphere with unique and intriguing stories, you should give a chance to Primordia.

The story is kind of...sad. Beautiful. The puzzles interesting and fun. I liked Technobabylon more though. Those fucking crashes ruined it for me to an extent...

The end was just...hm. I miss the feeling of a final closure to the beautiful story. I revolted against MetroMind to the very end but the story ending was like....like the authors wished to finish the game early and stopped caring about the script. 

I sensed considerable laziness from the developers in the game, here and there, mainly in the story development. Not in the puzzles though, some of them were sure tough to solve - the kiosk was the worst hurdle and figuring out some codes literally hurt my head. 

Also, the puzzle where you need to answer two robots in answering three questions is broken...in the second question only though. You are asked which of selected statements MUST be true but all of the statements DO NOT NEED TO BE true so I had to find the answer online.

Also, I'm not a good puzzle solver.

All in all...this game DEFINITELY needs more story into it. And the story parts of ""Humans destroyed themselves""? Cmon...that's lame. Human destroyed themselves / robots destroyed humans / wars between robots and humans....it's just not original. I mean: the Gospel of man, that is so beautifully written, I swear I read it many times. That is poetic. That was ART!! So was the philosophical laments of the MEMORIUS in the Kiosk. And Crispin! The Dunes! The Goliath!! All beautiful and very original, at least to me. 

Honestly, reading the gospel of man at the start of the game hyped me incredibly. I expected that the game was going to be preseting very hard, unsettling, maybe existential questions in its story. Conflict of religious beliefs among postapocalyptic robots? With philosophical insights and two-sided arguments I can relate to? 
I dig that. 
After reading the gospel of man at the start of the game, I realized that not only the author means the story, he is actually capable of meaning it! But...the story does not really go fully in this direction and remains a ""beautiful adventure game"" with a great story plot. At the start, I thought ""this is going to be a masterpiece"" but it was not.

Primordia es un juego que consigue mezclar aventura, puzzles, distopia, e incluso humor, de una forma que jam√°s hab√≠a visto.

Lo √∫nico que puede tirar a alguien hacia atr√°s es la jugabilidad, en ocasiones puede resultar algo frustrante pues el personaje no se mueve muy r√°pido, y el sistema para usar objetos es un tanto rudimentario.

Otro apartado notable es la dificultad, a la cual le pongo muy alta. No en el sentido de que puedas morir, pues es imposible, si no que los rompecabezas que se nos presentan suelen ser verdaderos rompecabezas, y puedes pasarte mucho tiempo intentando resolver algo. Es m√°s, da igual el orden en el que consigas objetos: no te olvides de uno solo, porque habr√° cosas que las usar√°s todo el juego.

This game is as close to flawless as an adventure game can ever be.  It has the best writing and the best soundtrack of any video game I've played and has a surprisingly deep setting and lore to it, which is impressive considering the small size of the game world.  With just a few locations, it creates a realistic world that had me immersed for hours.

The story and atmosphere of the game did a remarkable job of drawing me in and building tension, but where I believe the game stands out the most is in its setting.  The game takes place in a future in which life has long been extinct and Man has become a mythical deity worshipped by the remaining robots that now wander the lifeless desert that covers the earth, or even dismissed altogether as nothing more than legend.  Glass and light have become precious resources and what little remains of human invention is constantly scrapped to build new robots.  This is the kind of creativity that is lacking in most adventure games, and the subtlety with which it was presented was refreshing.

It was surprising to see a post-apocalyptic setting in which humans take only a background role and the nature of the world before is long forgotten.  Rather than barrage the player with the history of the world, Primordia puts the story and gameplay first while allowing players to discover the lore on their own, avoiding many (though not quite all) of the tropes that plague post-apocalyptic, dystopian, and robotic science fiction settings.

The game takes itself seriously and the comic relief exists for the amusement of the characters rather than that of the player, which is a skillful way of keeping the story believable, though Crispin's lines did make me cringe in more than a few points.  The primary cause of the chaotic dystopia is the degradation and corruption of the robots' programming, which becomes increasingly apparent as more of them are encountered.  All of the robots from the days of the humans are dead, insane, or rebuilt to the point of having no memories of the previous era, and the world inhabited by the rusting automotons that remain of civilization is chaotic, unpredictable, and bleak.  The dramatic irony of many characters' situations as well as the limited color palette contribute a depressing and hopeless tone that makes this an especially memorable experience.

Primordia is an essential contribution to the adventure genre of computer games, and one that I will gladly recommend to anyone who has an interest in interactive stories.  If you are considering getting Primordia, then please do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake I made of waiting for several years before buying it.",1469159072,1469231297,True,1,0,0,10,True,False,False,False,,,

However, the game has a critical flaw that permeates the entire experience: discovering how to progress is less an exercise in logic and more an exercise in clicking and walking the world. Many of the components of each puzzle are only tangentially related, oftentimes only in the most esoteric ways. Progression is further  hindered by the game's lack of robust programming. Sometimes you will try something that should work, only to find out that you were supposed to perform that action through slightly different mechanisms. 

The game also does not handle choices well. Now, there aren't many story-altering choices to make in this game, but the creators should have given the player more indications of what the effects of their actions would be, as well as more indication that certain paths could have been taken. I felt cheated out of the ending I would have chosen because of the problem I mentioned above. I clicked on something, nothing happened, and I went on my way, not realizing that I could have performed the intended action. This changed the ultimate ending.

Still very much recommended, but don't be ashamed to open up a guidebook if you get stuck.

Great ending(s)!

Minus:
Could be bigger. 
Hardcore Adventurios will blast through in one, albeit long, day
Lastly, the game could communicate some plot aspects better, if only through repetition. Miss a few dialogues and you might miss out on some twists.

Fallout

Primordia is a well-written point-and-click adventure game of a sci-fi world gone wrong. Much like Fallout or Deponia, the entire world is a post-apocalyptic mess of hostile robots, conflicting phiosophies and religious nutjobs. Many of the puzzles seem somewhat obscure as is tradition when it comes to adventure games like this, but for the most part many of them can be solved through exhausting the very few resources presented to you. Sometimes the game requires you to make a leap of logic that doesn't make sense, but other times the solution is as easy as thinking like an engineer (or a demoman).

There are some items and scenes that ultimately serve no purpose in progressing through any of the plots whatsoever, and at times it feels like the characters didn't develop all the way through, but outside of that this is a very fine adventure game. Probably one of the best you can get on Steam at the moment.


tl;dr It's a good puzzle adventure game that presents some basic concepts of social-political structures and has some of the best writing in its genre. A good game at its price and amazing on sale.",1468452713,1468452713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

These have varied wildly in quality, but in more recent years indie studios such as Wadjet Eye Games have managed to churn out charming retro games with regularity.  They generally strike the right balance in difficulty, the hand-painted art is often beautiful, and the stories are often interesting.  These games are not for everyone, of course, as games of this sort may seem ""dated"" or slow to modern gamers

To me, Primordia exemplifies the best aspects of most retro adventure games, with wonderful graphics (again, in a low res way that some appreciate more than others) and classic point and click exploration.  Primordia, however, distances itself from its peers through superior story, characters, and story structure.  The basic premise is an interesting one, and game designer and writer Mark Yohalem develops that premise expertly and meticulously.  The world unfolds naturally as you join Horatio and Crispin on their adventure.  The themes are more complex and nuanced than what you will see in most games.  The puzzles feel true to the world rather than thrown in just because you have to have them.

This is, in my opinion, the best game published by Wadjet Eye, and one of the best adventure games in recent memory.  If you're interested in going out on a limb and try an adventure game, consider trying this one.

First of all: I don't typically enjoy point-and-click games. I haven't played very many of them, and I usually get frustrated with the puzzles and either look up a guide (which kind of defeats the point) or quit. 

I LOVED Primordia. Maybe it scratched the right itch at the right time, but I enjoyed every second of this game. The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating (the only times that I had to look something up were just because I didn't realize I could scroll down on my data pack, for example, or that I could interact with an object in a certain way. For everything else, Crispin's hints were more than enough). It's gorgeous and thought-provoking. The voice acting was excellent and really brought all of the characters to life. The world is endlessly interesting. Looking at the achievements after my first playthrough, it also seems that there is a great deal to discover that I missed my first time around, which is good, because in my desire to experience more of this world I will probably play through it at least one more time. 

A lot of reviews have commented on it feeling a bit short, and I'm tempted to agree. The second half of the game in particular feels a bit rushed, but it seems to have more to do with there being lots of questions to answer, and they all get answered in a shotgun blast at once that seems to detract from the feeling of discovery that permiates the rest of the game. However, if the only bad thing I have to say about a game is ""I wanted more..."" is it really a bad thing after all?

Primordia is very literary. It's a game about the preservation of individuality within an increasingly communist society. It's about one's ""design,"" and whether or not it's possible to act against it. It's about friendship, religion, creation, preservation, degeneration, and hope.

√úber die Geschichte will ich nichts sagen, aber zum Spiel. Die Stimmung ist trotz des distopischen Settings nicht deprimierend, dies ist besonders Crispin geschuldet der mit seinen losen Mundwerk viel Heiterkeit verbreitet. Die R√§tsel sind logisch und lassen sich mit ein wenig Hirnschmalz gut l√∂sen. Steckt man dennoch mal fest steht einem Crispin mit Rat beiseite, wenn man ihn den fragt. Mit jedem R√§tsel erschlie√üt sich ein weiterer Teil der Geschichte und am Ende steht der gro√üe Showdown. Hier punktet Primordia mit einer Reihe alternativer Enden, f√ºr die zum Teil dann noch einmal einige Kleingkeiten zu kombinieren sind. 
F√ºr mich war das Spiel ein absoluter Gl√ºckskauf und empfehle es jedem weiter und kann nur hoffen ihr habt mit dem Spiel so viel Freude wie ich.

Nur einen Nachteil hat das Spiel, es ist so b'soding kurz ;)

There are few negative things to say so I'll start there.

[h1]CONS[/h1]
Starting with the only downsides I can think of, it was bothersome finding the right settings so the game would scale perfectly and look sharp on an HD display, but it worked fine once that was taken care of. 
Gameplay is somewhat akin to classic point and click with character displacement handled like any old 2D RPG, but it sometimes isn't clear which items are to be interacted with, or even whether it is possible. This was sometimes annoying but can be considered inherent to the game genre.
It's too short. Don't get me wrong, the length of the game is appropriate but the mood and story are so enticing by the end you'll definitely be left wanting more.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
The art. I'll come out with a bit of an unpopular opinion by saying gameplay is not a good reason to buy this game. Its geatest asset is without a question the art. Not only is the style 100% distinctive from anything I've seen before, the devs actually pulled it off perfectly. While it resembles moody postapocalyptic or cyberpunk art commonly seen in high-res online, the low pixel count makes it particularly impressive. Combining intricate convoluted shapes with pixel-art is just something I didn't think was possible until playing Primordia. The dark and brown color tones used and occasional neon accents really set the atmosphere as a surrealist cyberpunk universe. I can't stress enough there is nothing else like this.
On top of the visual aspects, the soundtrack is just great. Maybe I wouldn't listen to the ambient sounds on their own but they really do a great job of accenting both the story and environment.
Last comes the story. Oh boy. Not only was I surprised at every turn by a creative plot, but the character development is the cherry on the cake. Whoever wrote the story really knows how to blend humor, mystery, and tragedy in a story that never left me bored (except when I got stuck desperately looking for some object to interact with).

I won't oversimplify by rating this game with a number, but I'll say this:
Since I was about eight years old not a single day has gone by without me reading a novel. I have watched thousands of movies, played literally hudreds of games, and amidst all the classics, the worldwide hits, the big budget productions, all the various forms of entertainment, this comes out easily as one of the favorite stories of my lifetime. If you can sit through a few tedious puzzles and don't mind spending half an hour looking for items in a pile of trash, then I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Hell, even if you hate the gameplay it's affordable enough that you can buy it just to appreciate the art and ambience.",1460404752,1460503107,True,3,0,0.562565743923187256,3,True,False,False,False,,,

like in most other adventures.

Multiple ways to solve puzzles.
Multiple outcomes to situations.
Multiple ENDINGS ! - I love it.

And the attention to detail is really striking, - not ONCE did I encounter a single line of dialogue that didn't fit, although that's something developers quite ALWAYS glitch up in a minor way when
allowing their game to follow multiple paths.

On top of that, FOR ONCE an adventure game orients itself in reality, in the sense that you can use the same item in different but similar situations - most other games just find one excuse after the other, why ""Crowbar XY"" can IN NO WAY open Door #2, when just minutes ago it was  perfectly capable of opening Door #1.

As someone who grew up on Lem's Cyberiad, for me, robots inhabiting a post-mankind world was a must buy... but what really managed to awe me was how incredibly well they were executed. No throw-away characters and no bad cliches in this game.

Everything is spot on here: Story, voice acting, score and graphics.
The best thing for me: the puzzles are logical so far.
I always expect this of ""point&clicks"" and often get very disappointed early on.

Make sure to run ""winsetup.exe"" in your local game content folder 
to setup the graphics and other options before you run the game.

Even though the characters in the game are robots they retain many human properties that makes them quite relatable. To add to this, their human traits are merged with some very interesting quirks based on what purposes they were coded for. This makes almost every character you meet really interesting and memorable, and also drives a lot humor in the game. In particular, the bond between the playable character Horatio and his creation and best friend Crispin is consistently entertaining thoughtout the whole game. It's not just the setting that's great though, the writing and story in general is fantastic, and the voice acting is amazing.

The gameplay draws really well from the setting too. Scavenging for spare parts and pieceing machines together might feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played an adventure game before, but because of the setting and design of the game all of this feels really organic and fluid. It helps that there are core items in the game aren't simply used once and then thrown away, but instead you are gathering an array of tools (Your friend Crispin being one of them!) that you will keep reusing throughout the whole game. There is still the odd puzzle that had solutions I wouldn't have thought of and got me turning to a guide, but I would put this down to my own impatience rather than design faults of the game. I never really took the time to think things out completely as I was too compelled to move forward with the story!

Long story short, I would strongly recommend this game. The only negative thing I can think of is that I had a couple of very minor technical issues that were resolved easily.

Set in an extreme post-apocolyptia, our hero attempts to recover a power source he desperatly needs, stolen from him by a hulking robot. As his simple quest progresses, he finds himself drawn into the day-to-day conflicts of many men and women bots, deepening the story and lore of the world naturally. On the way you, the player, solve simple yet satisying point-and-click puzzles with elegent conectivity and solutions. The vast majority of the puzzles feel very natural, not forcibly integrated with the environment. The few esoteric ones can be figured out by paying careful attention to the dialogue of NPC bots. As you travel from your humble abode across vast wastes, to a sprawling, decrepit city, you meet incredibly interesting characters. The amount of work that went into the art design is astounding, and reflects well on the amount of work that went into the writing. The story is driven by dialogue rather than the environment, though all the scenes are breathtaking. I will say Crispin's playful banter leaves something to be desired and feels off-key, coming as it is in such a bleak game. But the story and gameplay merge so seemlessly you can forgive it.

I'm the kind of person who usually buys huge batches of cheap new indies and revamps of old adventure games, starts point-and-clickers excited but leaves them even before half-way, bored of the theme, disillusioned by the lack of immersion, redundant puzzles and all. Somehow it all gets diluted into a non-engaging mess. But this was not the case with Primordia; I played it through twice, once genuinely without any help, and then second time with a walkthrough / achievement guide to see what I had missed. 

I loved the dystopian atmosphere. The writing was excellent, as well as the characters. The graphics were surprisingly fitting - somehow the artists filled just the right amount of atmospheric detail in ""cinematics"", and the gameplay was fluent enough. Puzzles did involve every once in a while some actual thinking and not just random inventory combo-womboing, and once I even took pen and paper to solve a key puzzle. I must commend that the narration for Horatio, Crispin, as well some other key characters (without spoilers) were excellently done, which played a huge part on why the game was so immersive for me.

On the down-side, some of the puzzles were kinda redundant pixel searching, as one might expect. Luckily the hint system was just on the correct level for a guy like me, who doesn't like hunting for pixels for eternities, and might dismiss an ""obvious"" clue every here and then. I never felt stuck, and I always had a sense of progression in my first playthrough. Without spoiling too much, there isn't that much of difference in the endings or how your choices end up as consequences, but second playthrough (with a walkthrough) did reveal more of the lore and modest alternatives that I had missed. I must also admit that dystopia/sci-fi as a genre is probably my favorite (1984, Brave New World, Neuromancer, you name it), so I am biased to liking this game.

Overall, I can highly recommend this excellent adventure-novel to anybody that can overcome the barrier of point-and-click, and instead enjoy a ride of well fitting retro graphics, excellent narrative, good writing, and a neatly packaged ~4-6h adventure in a single playthrough - all for a very modest price.

Despite the above I feel I am qualified to give a review of a large portion of the content, since the core backstory is static.

This game is wonderful. It happens to be my favorite game in the world, but that is a subjective assessment and I intend for this to be an objective review so I will explain WHY my opinon has formed the way it has.

First: the world is unique.  The spectacularly different setting in which the protagonist finds himself is interesting and deeply realized. I found that as I played this game I wanted to learn more and more about the backstory, the reason things were the way they were. It is likely that not everyone will have this response but I found that the somehow quite human cyberpunk characters drew me in. The robotic population of this game have dreams, hopes, and problems which make them relatable, but also special. They are obviously not human, but the similarities between them and humanity are evident in many portions of the game. That, however, is not to say there are no differences. Indeed some of the differences are what drove me to be more industrious in my exploration of the world.

Second: the voice acting is stellar. While the voice acting is not particularly flashy, it has an underplayed value in making the protagonist and his little helper come to life. Throughout it gives simple but essential relatability with the main character, putting the player in his shoes so to speak. The voices are diverse and unique and this additionally draws the player into the world, which now not only has depth, but also seems broad.

Third: the art is dead center with the rest of the game's feel. Though robotic, many tubes and unique shapes cascade through the art design, giving the machines an organic feel (this is not the only game I've seen do this but this game does it well). Most of the tones are dead-feeling beiges and browns but there are many glowing lights throughout the game that give the overall impression of a world with a soul beneath all the lifeless metal. Again this fits perfectly with the world's history and vibe.

Fourth: the audio is wonderfully immersive. The sound is electronic with a common use of ethnic sounding pad synths. Deep, slow rhythms give the game a dark and somber feel which meshes perfectly with the mechanized art and characters. There is at least one old record you can listen to, which deepens the games portrayal of the world's past.

Fifth: the gameplay is solid. The puzzles are not hard, but they have an obvious digital slant that only increases immersion and interest. Each one is unique, although each of thier formats is fairly standard for point and click games. If this game had to have a weakness it would be the puzzles, if you don't play this game for the story and immersion, I think you're not playing to the game's amazing strengths. If you don't like stories/worlds that you can lose yourself in and just want hard puzzles, don't play this. However, if you've ever been interested in a cyberpunk world, or a fantasy story, or even basic philosophy/worldviews, let this game tell you a story. It does it well.

I am a big fan of the Blackwell games, and this game has many of the same strengths.

Pros:
+ Excellent story. There's legitimately a lot to think about in this game, including political, religious, and social commentary. The game is set in a world where humans are extinct and only robots are left. We see how the society they create is a very clever mirror of our own, with plenty of parody of our own flaws along the way.
+ The point and click puzzles are solid. They are somewhat difficult, but solvable without having to consult a walkthrough because the solutions make sense once you get them. To me, this is one of the most important things about gameplay in a point and click. You have to use your brain to solve the puzzles.
+ If you do start struggling, you can get hints by talking to people (especially your sidekick Crispin), which again means you don't need to consult the internet to get a nudge in the right direction. Normally, he will give you a clue about which area you should be searching, or which object you should be fiddling with.
+ The art and aesthetics in the game are good. The characters are interesting-looking, and the world is very neat.
+ The game is paced well. It does a nice job of moving you from place to place, advancing the story and revealing the mysteries by steps.

Cons:
- Hard to think of any. I suppose the UI can be a bit clunky until you get used to it, especially how you access your inventory.",1454430559,1454430661,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you like robots, themes of AI, and/or adventure games - especially classic ones - this game is for you.  

The game follows the pretty standard adventure mechanic - click on things to make things happen - sometimes click on things with things from your inventory, or mix things in your inventory together until they become clickable on other things.  Take notes.  (Most of which actually happens for you with the in-game ""data-pad"".)  Solve puzzles with said notes.  

The game runs at 640x400 resolution - which can be off-putting to some, but really lends to the retro-adventure feel of the game, and I've come to love it.  (On my 1080p tv, it won't actually fill up the whole screen, but it doesn't really bother me.)  That said - I highly recommend going into the options menu and chosing the ""DX"" display mode as opposed to D3D if it works for you - the sprites mesh with the backgrounds much better this way in my opinion.  DOS nostalgia!

What really shines in Primordia is the story - and the art.  They come together to create a fascinating atmosphere that makes me want to revisit the game again and again - and the developer commentary is great on a second or third playthrough.  The excellent voice acting and seven or so potential endings don't hurt, either.  (The narrator from Bastion plays the main character - and the sidekick that follows you through the game is entertaining at every turn.)  The music and sound mesh well with the art to create an engrossing atmosphere - despite the retro low-res graphics.  

There aren't many puzzles in the ""puzzle game"" sense - but there is plenty of puzzling to be done in the game in terms of figuring out how things fit together, what things mean, and what the significance of certain items or pieces of information may be.  The story is mostly linear, but there are a few opportunities to take different approaches to solve situations - especially near the end.  Observation and careful contemplation are rewarded.

The setting is in the distant future in a post-human world - no organic life is to be found anywhere - even the bugs and little things swimming in the sewers are machines - but make no mistake, they have lives and thoughts of their own, and are no less interesting than any human character.  And for the robot fan, there are references to other robots from both popular and obscure culture everywhere - along with a videogame reference or two.  MST3K, Short Circuit, Metropolis, and Fallout - just to name a few.

I would highly recommend this game to any fan of classic graphic adventures, narrative-driven games, or robots.",1453862746,1453863542,True,1,0,0.479452043771743774,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's description is: ""What happened to the Humans"", but that isn't what the game is about. 
I thought this would be an Adeptus Mechanicus themed Adventure game with a Sam and Max buddyish element, but was actually wrong.
Instead, this is a game about logic, law, and a divide between liberty and community. 

The main characters are both charming and the other characters all have little quirks that ensures there is no ""that guy"" of the game. The puzzles are good without ever being too challenging and the story is tightly knit, with only about 10-11 locations and about 15 characters in the entire game. It's concise without any red herrings. Actually, because the game is so tightly knit, some important secrets are left out in plain sight, which makes it interesting to replay. 

What I also like about the puzzles in this game are that there's dialouge if the game understands what you were trying to do with a puzzle, but you were using the wrong piece and there's multiple ways to solve several of the puzzles. In fact, the biggest and longest puzzle of the game can literally be bypassed from the moment you enter the second act. 

My only complaint with the game would be the antagonist. The antagonist has a trait that they can ""never lie"" but then you manage to catch them in lies several times and when confronted with this, the antagonist says ""no player, you must be mistaken because I am not"". In a game where the entire second act is about logic, it just seems silly. Additionally, my other problem with the antagonist is that at one point the antagonist just says ""I know you have a lot of questions about the world and history of this game world, so let me answer all of them for you"". 

However, that small gripe aside, this game had me engaged and immersed the whole time, trying to figure out its secrets and lore (until the minute that it got bored and laid out its cards on the table).",1452806434,1452806434,True,2,0,0.536423861980438232,1,True,False,False,False,,,

We had a walkthrough since neither of us could understand English. Since then I have gone mostly to other genres but the adventuring spark were left in me somewhere. That‚Äôs why I have bought a great many point-and-click games but every time I play one the same thing happens: I click around for a while and get bored. They just don‚Äôt get a grip on me. That was until Primordia.

The player takes role of Horatio and his sidekick Crispin, who live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. What seems like a peaceful existence is interrupted when a robot crashes through their wall and steals a power core that is keeping the two alive. The game is a quest to find and get back the power core. The mood is melancholic and sad but is lighten up by Crispin‚Äôs surprisingly funny dialog. Every other character was also fascinating and had some personality to them.

This was the first ever adventure game that I completed without looking at a walkthrough. Most of the puzzles are logical in a sense that if you have an item that might fit it most likely does. Every solution made sense. The puzzles are quite varied: There are use-item-on-item puzzles but also drawing, memorization, code breaking and so on. I was surprised at how many different kind of obstacles the creators had thought out. It took 7 hours to complete the game, though length varies greatly depending on how fast you solve the puzzles. There appears to be different endings and outcomes since I only got half of the achievements on single playthrough.

The graphics in this are amazing. Everything is a post-apocalyptic bleak wasteland but the world that was destroyed has this art deco kind of style (think Bioshock) that is really nice. The game actually runs at the tiniest of resolutions but is stretched to full screen. Not a lot of pixels to work with but what has been achieved is wonderful. I‚Äôd love to see full resolution images of the art since it‚Äôs so great. This is also why the game probably runs on pretty much any potato as long as there is electricity. For some strange reason in one room, after certain thing happens, my fps dropped to single digits but it was solved after I got out of the room. You cannot die and there is no rush so it doesn‚Äôt matter. Even better than the visuals is the sound and music. I think the voice acting is great but, together with the art, it‚Äôs the music that shines the most. 

If you have any interest in point-and-click Primordia is a must play, no doubt about that. For someone new to the genre it‚Äôs also a good place to start since it‚Äôs not as far-out weird with its puzzles as some games in the genre.

Puzzles were decent and quite logical, although at times the game had too many red herrings going on, which made some puzzles a bit difficult for me. Still, only in one puzzle I had to go to a walkthrough and check it out.

[b]HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.[/b]

Beautiful (if grim) setting and atmosphere. Excellent dialogs.

The puzzles are quite intuitive (after thinking for a bit! =), at least some of them have multiple solutions (I finished the game without solving every puzzle), and the game has a very robust hint system which is nicely integrated into the narrative.

I enjoyed the retro/pixelated visual style, but since mileage varies greatly do check screenshots and videos and see for yourself.

Maybe a tad short, as adventure games tend to be (about 5-8 hours in this case) but you can save the game at any point (and you have as many save slots as you want), which encourages exploring alternative solutions & dialog choices.

[h1]In detail (*Spoiler-free*)[/h1]

Personally, I play adventure games mostly for the story, setting, and characters, with a bit of puzzle-solving to spice the mix. As noted above, in this genre I don't care much for AAA high-end graphics as long as what's on the screen is clear.

""Primordia"" delivers on all counts:

> The setting is amazing: robots in a post-apocalyptic, nearly Mad-Maxian world (minus the cars), with an orwellian Big Brother on top. Although, to make it better, the mood is nostalgic and bittersweet rather than oppressive.

> The plot is itself quite good.

> I found most characters to be very well crafted. The protagonist's companion deserves a mention of his own: not only he fulfills his Sassy Sidekick role and provides the humor this otherwise grim tale needs, he's also part of a very comprehensive hint system (and seamlessly integrated into the narrative)

> The puzzles themselves are quite intuitive, and the few that may be too obscure are enlightened by the hint system. Several puzzles have multiple solutions, too (I finished the game without solving every puzzle), and at least a few of them affect the endings of the story.

""Primordia"" (as other adventure games) may feel a bit too short when comparing the playtime/cost ratio with other genres, but IMHO it's the price of well crafted plot & characters... and, perhaps more important, of setting and themes you keep thinking about even after finishing the game.

I've written a new review on completing the game. First I still think the warning applies: it should be made clearer that it runs 640x400.** That's not a full screen size image in the video**. However I found it best to turn on x4 anti-aliasing, this is the best option.

This is a great story, nice main character and side kick, good voice acting, setting is interesting. I only got stuck a couple of times, and you know when you do in these games it's because you've missed something obvious or not so obvious on the screen. I'm not a fan of searching the screen for a clue and there is'nt  too much of that, but if you get stuck chances are it's that. The memorious puzzle was in fact a bit oblique to me, like I'd forgotten something in a trunk.

I'd also say this is the type of game where even though the in game data collection works fine you will need a pen and paper for a couple of the code and logic puzzles but that's it. Mostly because getting it wrong the first time locks you out of achieving some of the achievements, though this does give you incentive to play again.  

It has multiple endings so there's some replayability to it at the end. 
I'd compare the setting to Machinarium, but story style wise and feel more Beneth a steel sky. I happen to think those are two top games.

To dev: I dont think a sequel would be possible *right now* but maybe a prequel  would fit really well here. Do a Star Wars and make a trilogy and jump around the timeline.
Having read the Fallen pdf it did give me much more of a sense of story, I can see how things would be missing with out it. I'd put a link on the store page for download if it's not already there. Add the setting to right click change settings to the library entry.

=== old review
I bought a bunch of point and clicks at the same time, and when I got this I really didnt realise it ran this size. It's too fiddly and post stamp size. I'm aware I can scale it up x4 but then it becomes quite hard to discern things in the picture, which is annoying.
I don't have a problem with pixel art, and in some cases that's easier for finding things on screen rather than a high res style, but the art style here makes it too difficult to recognise things. I played through Techno Babylon no problem, which is at a larger resolution but something about that game has cleaner lines where as Primordia has a lot of detail. I'd compare this more to Machinarium style but pixelated.
This could really benefit the clarity it has at 640x400 at a larger frame. I know that won't be possible without remaking it, but that might actually be worth doing...
At the moment im in two minds about it and getting a refund.
Which is a pity because im pretty sure it is good. 
Depends if you can live with that size. edit: use 4x anti-aliasing, it goes a bit dream like looking but it's certainly better. cheers

Not only is this a great game for many reason's but its done more then just play and run wonderfully.
Its opened my eyes to what amazing storys and places are in all types of games not just your AAA titles.
This game is why I love steam their's something for almost everone to enjoy and being someone whos super into mecha,
robots, mechanical design, pixal art, and post apocalyptic setting this game hit all the right buttons.

But for the game itself I will keep this simple.
Its got amazing characters.
Great voice acting.
Amazing art and styling.
Super interesting story and lore I can't get enough of.
Gamplay is fun and inventive.
And the sound design and soundtrack is just prefect.

I really want to thank the people at Wormwood Studios and everyone who took the time, And effort to make this game.

The puzzles provide a good challenge and the story is well written. I really enjoyed playing through this, unlike other point and click adventure games. The themes are also pretty dark, but very satisfying and aided in keeping me playing. I tend to put these kind of games down because I get bored or suck. I hated mine sweeper as a kid and randomly clicking around the screen got tiresome. Primordia even has some cheeky and cleaver dialogue incase you need to run around clicking everything. Didn't help with the frustration, but the occasional joke helped keep me from just giving up. Plus CYBERPUNK! PLUS POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELANDS!

SPOILERS!!!!--------

There are multiple endings. I assure you, saving right before the big confontation helps you experience them all! Each is pretty cool, but even some optional items can have an impact on the ending. Mainly items belonging to your companions. Also certain events may occur that have an impact on your endings. Save different files often as kind of a bookmark so you can go back and attempt for different outcomes. I had about 17 so I could see everything with three files for all the endings (confrontation save)  

For example, there's a situation where you can corner a rogue AI. Save before you attempt! Trapping him gives you an item that aids in the true ending, but killing him changes the ending of that chapter. So if you want to experience both chapter endings, you'll need 2 saves, but after that, the two paths merge and continues normally. 

ALSO! SPOILERS!

Have Crispin talk to the lanterns. He needs the practice!

The characters, the art the atmosphere and music and the backstory just everything about this game is perfect and I am mourning its end as I could sit in front of my computer playing this forever.

If you for what ever reason are on the fence about buying this masterfully crafted game please take my advice and just buy it. I would have paid double for this without hesitation.

You will gather, combine, and use items found throughout the world to solve problems, and you will be asked to solve the occasional riddle.

You take on the role of Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot who lives in the wasteland, salvaging parts to repair a derelict flying ship. The game begins when a strange robot cuts his way into the side of your ship, shoots you, and steals your vital power core. Without a power source to recharge your body you will surely die, so you and your companion (a floating, armless sidekick named Crispin Horatiobuilt) set out to recover your core, or at least to find a suitable replacement.

The game is divided into two major parts: first, you wander the wasteland searching for a power core, then eventually you leave the wasteland for a second location. Once you transition to the second area, you will no longer be able to access the wasteland portion of the game. Along the way, you will meet many strange robots, unravel mysteries about your world and your own past, and uncover a sinister plot.

Storytelling is Primordia's greatest strength. Once the narrative picks up (beginning about halfway through the wasteland section), the story really engages the player. The cast of characters (most of which are found in the game's second area) are surprisingly well realized. Each has a distinct personality and a clear motivation. Your relationships with each of them feel genuine, and even your enemies feel well rounded.

The game's setting and art style combine with the well realized characters to create a compelling sense of place. Despite the low resolution environments and sprites, Primordia's world feels bigger than the screen it plays out on. Stellar voice acting and a droning ambient soundtrack put the finishing touches on a beautifully desolate world.

For all its strengths, though, Primordia's downfall is the gameplay. In the 80s and early 90s, point and click adventures were among the best represented genres in PC gaming. Since the rise of 3D graphics and the emergence of new styles of adventure game, they have retreated to the niche and indie markets. My memories of those old adventure games are pleasant, and it takes a game like Primordia to clear the fogged lenses of time. Simply put, even the best made adventure games tend to have puzzles whose solution only seemed apparent to the designer. And Primordia is far from the best made adventure game.

The first issue is that puzzles in Primordia often have nonsensical solutions, or worse, do not permit you to use the most obvious solution. One puzzle early on asked me to plug a pair of ventilation ducts. The first I plugged easily with a piece of scrap cut from a nearby structure, but despite there being three more identical pieces of scrap to cut from, the game would not permit me to do so, and instead demanded I locate an unrelated item that did not seem to fit (according to the visual representations in the game). And these logical disconnects are such frequent occurrances, you will soon find yourself simply trying to use every item in your inventory on each puzzle in the hope that a solution will present itself.

The second issue is the way the game arbitrarily cuts you off from certain areas, objectives, and even major plot threads. It is even possible to lock yourself out of ""winning"" the game (you can still complete the game and achieve one of the ""bad"" endings) through a blindly made choice in the first 30 minutes of play.

Lastly (and this is a small complaint), the inclusion of achievements seems to undermine the freedom built into the game's choices. When there are three ways to resolve a puzzle, but one awards an achievement, there is a real sense that there is a ""right way"" to play, stifling any sense of freedom the system might have otherwise provided.

These serious and frankly unforgivable design flaws sour what might have been an excellent game. Die hard point and click adventure fans will probably push right through, but if you are an average modern gamer with fond memories of classic adventure games, prepare to be reminded of all the bad mechanics that made those games such a frustrating experience.",1444022628,1444023654,False,165,8,0.704753220081329346,23,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm a story guy and this game delivers it in spades both at a macro level (the main story arch) and micro level (the single scenes). It does suffer a bit from the puzzle adventure syndrome, that is, it's not always clear how to solve a problem with the stuff you have, even when you have everything that's needed. I know this is to be expected in a way but it still bothers me.
The old nerd in me suspected some of the details revealed in the final scenes right from the start but the game was compelling enough to just draw me in the atmospheric setting and make me concentrate on what was happening at a certain point. Hard to say the same about most games I've tried.
The music may be a bit repetitive in the long run but it really adds to the mood, it fits perfectly. So much so that I actually noticed, appreciated and left it on: in other games I usually have it on low volume or off entirely.
The graphics are retro, but in a good way. A shiny AAA engine would only marginally enhance the game. Some may even think that this old school style is actually better/more suited to this kind of game, can't say they are completely wrong.

Things i liked:

- Good story, with cool characters.
- Excellent polylogues.
- Jokes.
- Sense of progression.
- ""I am waiting"", ""A simple model.""

Somethings i found annoying were:

- I wasn't always able to discern clickable objects (objects that had a hover-over text component) which hindered my progress. (MOST ANNOYING)
- I couldn't always tell when story paths were diverging, though this more subtle style of nuance might be a aesthetic feature.
- Some puzzles required an excessively broad associative horizon, which didn't always match real world thinking (according to me).

I could tell just from looking at the trailer and screenshots of this game that it looked interesting, and that ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" next to the user reviews made it seem like a no-brainer. So, finally I picked up this game and boy, I am not disappointed.

Let's get the bad out of the way first.

This game runs in a very small resolution, at least for most modern monitors. The highest resolution possible is 1280x800, which looks best in a window. It was also a bit annoying that the only way I could find to change these settings was by a launcher in the actual folder containing the game files. I only found that much by perusing the game forum when I was disappointed with the resolution.

There isn't much replayability. I can definitely see myself trying this game again to do a few things different, but overall it is a story-driven and therefore linear experience. It has several endings, but most of those endings are decided at your own whim by how you play out the final scenes.

Now, the good.

The obvious first thing you'll notice about this game is that artwork. I found it to be very cool to look at and definitely gives you that feeling of despair - a world wasting away around you as you desperately try to rebuild what you can. You also have atmospheric music that adds to these scenes but mostly stays in the background. It adds a lot, but doesn't overtake it. Instead, it's all just working together to give you an experience.

The voice acting is likewise excellent. The main character and his sidekick both do most of the talking, so it's great to see them so well performed. It's easy to pick up on their personalities and they're both likeable.

I'm always a bit bad at puzzles in games, but I thought the ones here were challenging but always possible. Nothing ever felt frustrating or beyond my abilities to figure out. I did get ""stuck"" in a few places where I had no idea what to do, but it usually came down to me not thinking about the situation well enough or remembering details that I simply overlooked. It's worth saying, almost everything matters in this game. There are few things that are superfluous.

Overall it took me about six hours to complete this game. I would have liked for it to be longer, but I could say that for any good game.

My favorite part about these games, as a kid, was that they whisked you away to a completely different, and foreign place. Though many adventure games seek to do this, few fall short, and end up feeling like ""just another point and click"" derived of any rich narrative. Primordia is not one of those games that falls short at all.

I should admit before I go any further that I've only played the opening sequence of this game thus far, and am extremely excited to get back to it after this review, but this particular summary will be noting the aesthetic, and initial response of Primordia.

I absolutely love post-apocalypse. It's not an uncommon scenario, thankfully, so there's lots of material to dig through on the subject. Unfortunately, there's quite a lot of BAD post-apocalypse games out there, and so with some hesitation, I bought this game, and sat down with some skepticism. For ten bucks, I was hoping it was going to deliver, and the reviews spoke for themselves.

Primordia does something a lot of post-apocalyptic stories don't, and removes humans altogether from the character roster. You begin the game as Horatio Nullbuilt (the surname meaning some dude presumeably named 'Null' built him, which is a common theme throughout the game), the 5th version to be precise, and are accompanied by Crispin Horatiobuilt, your custom companion and comic relief. The world around you is an age-old Earth, looking very barren and very post-war. A strange robot cuts down your door one day and steals your power core, without which you can not charge your own batteries (nor Crispin's). Since that simply won't do, you venture out into the world in order to find the strange robot and reclaim your power core. 

Easier said than done. What follows are scenes common to Adventure/Point+Click games: You meet hosts of interesting robots, travel to new and exciting places, and spend a good deal of time trying to combine every single item in your inventory to see if it does something cool. Excellent (okay... MOSTLY excellent) voice acting, a (so far) riveting and comedic script, beautiful artwork, and intriguing characters make this one of my favorite Adventure games to date, and I've barely even started it.

Should you get it? I mean, it's a point and click. You know what you're getting. The deciding factor, in most cases, is the story and artwork, and both deliver wholeheartedly. Even this early, the story is already showing to be incredibly promising, with twists and turns, and dark comedy as only robots can deliver. The script, as mentioned, is really quite good, and I don't find myself simply reading through the subtitles and clicking through in order to progress, but rather relishing the lines and the delivery. The art, while simple and ""retro"" in style, does not detract at all from the story, but actually enhances it with far-off vistas, incredible robot designs, and teeming robot cities, both very alive, and strangely dead. 

Fans of point and clicks, this is another excellent addition to your collection, reminding me of titles like Deponia, Riven, and (of course) Monkey Island. Fans of sci-fi, post apocalyptic fiction will also love this game. All in all, I think it's one of those rare games on Steam where I feel like I absolutely got what I paid for, and then some.

And I haven't even finished it.

There are some very unique things that set this game apart from other point-and-click adventure games.
     One element that is so different about Primordia is the surprisingly large amount of dialogue that is incorporated into it, unlike most other games of the genre.
     Another characteristic that adds to the game is Crispin, the protagonist's ""sidekick"" if you would call him that. He adds a sense of humour to the game (although sometimes rather corny) and can offer hints to the player that are valuable, but not always completely revealing of the next course of action that must be taken. Crispin is an often uplifting character in this post-apocalytic setting.
     Another trait that won me over is the atmosphere in the game. It seems realistic in the post-apocalyptic setting, and it is one of my favorite things about this game. The backrounds always seem beautifully made.
     The puzzles in this game are very engaging and are not always clear-cut which may seem like a bad thing, but I personally enjoy the extra challenge. Not every puzzle is as simple as clicking on one thing and then another. They often include various items and/or certain actions to be taken. This is a huge difference between Primordia and other point-and-click adventure games.
     The only complaint I really have about this game is that it seems to include a few creationist concepts that I personally do not agree with. It is brought up through the concept of humanism in the game which is symbolic of today's major religions that believe that a god created humans.
     Another piece of this game that I am not fully content with is the way the protagonist moves. It can sometimes seem somewhat clumsy, but I won't be critical about it seeing as how that is how it is with most other point-and-click adventure games.
     Overall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It is definitely a worthwhile play for those who like games such as machinarium or other big point-and-click adventure games because of the unique elements it includes.
     One last thing I would like to address is that it sometimes has multiple choices that can be made, leading to different outcomes. They do not alwyas have a huge effect on the story, but it adds a sense of independence in the game.
I highly recommend that you all look into playing this game :)

I enjoyed the world, characters and story the game offered. It was quite entertaining. Solving the puzzles felt good and the story (though not character driven) evolved in a way that made sense. 
There was only one major flaw in the game - a puzzle that required the player to know a different language!

Et pour couronner le tout, les univers post-apocalyptiques sont plut√¥t ma tasse de th√©. Pour moi, il √©tait √©vident que j'allais passer un bon moment avec Primordia !

Il y a beaucoup d'√©l√©ments pour faire un bon jeu dans Primordia !
H√©las, malgr√© tous mes bons √†-prioris et ma volont√© de m'amuser, je n'ai jamais r√©ussi.

Histoire en r√©sum√©:
L'humanit√© a disparu compl√®tement depuis des lustres et ses seuls h√©ritiers peuplant la Terre sont les robots, qui ont reconstruit une soci√©t√© bien √† eux, h√©ritant toutes les tares de leurs cr√©ateurs. L'Homme n'est aujourd'hui plus qu'une l√©gende, certains robots y croient, et d'autres non. Horatio, le h√©ros, vit en ermite dans le d√©sert et se fait voler la pi√®ce ma√Ætresse de son vaisseau par un robot mena√ßant. Aid√© par son petit assistant Crispin, il se lance √† la poursuite du voleur, ce qui l'entra√Ænera dans diverses p√©rip√©ties...

Premi√®res constatations : les graphismes sont d√©licieusement mornes et d√©primants, et la musique est du plus bel effet.
Les doublages sont pas mal, m√™me si l'intonation des personnages (robots) est constamment monocorde, et que leur voix est souvent distordue, ce qui se r√©v√®le un peu fatiguant √† la longue. On retrouve l'ami Abe Goldfarb, qui doublait Joey dans les Blackwell, et qui se cantonne ici encore au r√¥le de l'assistant du h√©ros, Crispin. Mais √ßa fait toujours plaisir de le retrouver !

Plus on avance, plus on se rend compte que l'histoire et l'ambiance sont tr√®s s√©rieuses. Les quelques traits d'humour sont surtout des r√©f√©rences de geek (jeux vid√©o comme half life, fallout, etc) et des blagues d'informaticien, bref, tout ce que je d√©teste. Dommage !
Le rythme est lent et je me suis demand√© de nombreuses fois quand l'intrigue allait finir par d√©coller, ou quand les choses allaient vraiment bouger. Ca vient peut-√™tre aussi de l'ambiance pesante ou simplement de l'univers assez fig√© et monotone. C'est s√ªrement voulu, mais du coup, √† aucun moment je ne me suis amus√© sur ce jeu. Je ne me suis jamais senti non plus emport√© par l'intrigue, qui passe rapidement de retrouver la pi√®ce du vaisseau √† sauver une ville enti√®re. Un rebondissement un peu trop classique dans le genre.
Difficile de se sentir impliqu√© lorsque cette ville est peupl√©e de seulement quelques robots. En effet, avec le recul, vous n'int√©ragirez pas avec beaucoup de personnages : ceux avec lesquels le h√©ros peut vraiment dialoguer de fa√ßon √©labor√©e (hormis son compagnon) ne sont pas nombreux.
Les dialogues montrent √† quel point les robots du coin sont compl√®tement tordus / bugg√©s, ce qui peut √™tre amusant. Vers la fin, le h√©ros affirme qu'il en consid√®re certains comme ses amis alors qu'au bout du compte, ils se sont crois√©s dans la journ√©e et n'ont eu que des √©changes assez limit√©s (hormis avec Crispin, encore une fois). C'est assez bizarrement amen√©. Mis √† part Horatio, les personnages ont un background assez peu d√©velopp√©, ce qui ne permet pas de s'y attacher vraiment. Leur (non) charisme n'aide pas beaucoup non plus, mis √† part Crispin, qui fait de son mieux pour caser des blagues et des remarques cyniques quand il peut.

Reste alors les √©nigmes. 
Certaines sont plut√¥t originales (le branchement des c√¢bles par exemple), certaines sont juste usantes. Avec le recul, encore une fois, je me rends compte que j'ai pass√© une bonne partie de mon temps √† trouver des codes et √† jongler avec pour ouvrir des portes / r√©parer des trucs. Le reste du temps, je l'ai pass√© √† trouver des objets pour les donner √† un gus X ou Y qui m'en refile un autre en √©change, et ainsi de suite. La forme est parfois vari√©e mais le fond ne l'est pas du tout. Le peu qu'il reste se compose d'√©nigmes de r√©paration et de dialogues de type questions-r√©ponses - vrai/faux selon ce que vous avez retenu du dialogue.

L'outil qui r√©cup√®re les donn√©es part d'une bonne intention puisqu'il vous permet de stocker les infos et de les garder sous la main √† tout moment pour r√©soudre les √©nigmes, comme une sorte de calepin. Le probl√®me, c'est qu'il stocke √† la fois des informations cruciales et des trucs compl√®tement inutiles ou dont vous ne vous servirez plus jamais (il n'efface pas automatiquement les infos qui correspondent √† des √©nigmes r√©solues depuis belle lurette), ce qui vous oblige √† faire d√©filer tout un tas de pages sans int√©r√™t avant de retrouver celle qui vous int√©resse. A quoi √ßa sert ?

Point appr√©ciable cela dit : aucune erreur / mauvais choix n'est consid√©r√© comme un √©chec dans le jeu. Vous pouvez tout √† fait foirer une sc√®ne, le jeu consid√®rera toujours qu'il s'agit de votre mani√®re √† vous de faire avancer l'histoire. Ca vous laisse donc de nombreuses possibilit√©s de d√©bloquer des situations. Autre point positif qui en d√©coule directement : de nombreuses fins sont disponibles !

Au bout du compte, le jeu est plut√¥t court (entre 4 et 6h), sauf si vous comptez le recommencer pour tester toutes les solutions et les fins. L'histoire est assez t√©l√©phon√©e, et plut√¥t basique sur le sujet Science-fiction / robots.

En r√©sum√© :
Si vous aimez beaucoup les point and click, les ambiances post-apocalyptiques, la science fiction, les r√©f√©rences geek, les robots, et surtout, si vous √™tes un grand nostalgique, vous appr√©cierez sans doute ce jeu, en plus le prix est plut√¥t correct.
Seulement voil√†, ces crit√®res sont g√©n√©raux, et cette critique refl√®te uniquement mon avis personnel. Oui, il est possible d'√™tre d√©√ßu par ce jeu, il s'agit plus d'une mise en garde. Si les points n√©gatifs que j'ai mentionn√©s sont importants pour vous, donc si vous avez plus ou moins les m√™mes exigences que moi, r√©fl√©chissez bien.

J'esp√®re que ceux qui se laisseront tenter l'appr√©cieront, car j'adore ce studio et j'ai beaucoup de respect pour le travail qu'ils accomplissent habituellement.",1435403552,1435403552,False,3,0,0.535816967487335205,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm not sure on their decision to making a game in this day and age for a 320x200 CRT screen though, and have to upscale it on you screen. Is it just trying to capture the look of old games for old times sake?
I assume the art would have been drawn at higher resolution to start with, why not keep it like that instead of downgrading it into pixels? The only reason games use to look like that was because that's all they were capable of.
Would have been nice to have the option to choose the original art of the downsampled pixel art.

During the first 20 minutes I was pushing myself to continue based only on the positive reputation of the title. I‚Äôm glad I stuck with it, because when it gets going it‚Äôs an admirable game. The world and the story has as much rigorous thought and attention put to it as you could ever demand of a title. 

My only problem with the game (apart from the slow start) is the puzzles. I don‚Äôt mind slow paced games, or solving puzzles. But there‚Äôs something with the point-and-click form that makes me lose patience faster than 3d puzzle games like Portal or Antichamber. There‚Äôs always walkthroughs to help out players like me, but I don‚Äôt like going that route. There‚Äôs puzzles in Primordia where I have no idea how I would have ever solved them, like in my entire life, without looking up the solution. I want to see what happens next in the story, that‚Äôs my primary interest in these titles. But the designers thought otherwise, and because they thought this was a good idea, I‚Äôm not going to think ill of anyone who likes the puzzles. It‚Äôs just not for me. And I guess it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot really a problem‚Äù because faqs exist. But I wish there was something else that could be done with this type of game. Of all the point-and-click games I‚Äôve played there‚Äôs only a couple where I haven‚Äôt hit a wall because of pixel hunting. Those moments always make me wonder what the point is.

Despite that rambling second paragraph I would absolutely recommend Primordia to anyone who likes the look of it. It‚Äôs superb sci-fi, of the kind that‚Äôs not just rare in games, but rare anywhere. It treats its characters and the world with intelligence and respect. What made the first 20 minutes a bit dull was that I couldn't tell how ambitious it was going to be with the setting. I mean I've seen a ton of stories start out like this with lonely scavengers in the desert. But when it started dropping hints about what the game would really be about it made me increasingly excited. It takes a serious stab at exploring what life as a machine in a world run by machines would be like. What their religions and laws could be. Echoes of their human ancestors, now adapted for their style of thinking. And it does this without any attempt at dumbing it down for a wide audience. A gutsy thing to do, and it works.",1435124379,1435133132,True,14,0,0.647854030132293701,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The graphic style is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù kind of haunting and wistful, unique and beautiful.
Play is somewhat frustrating because you have to find items then combine them while in your inventory for use on items in the environment.
Some of the combinations that need to be used are just not intuitive or easily figured out.
Also if you combine two items by putting one on the other it may not combine until you put the other thing on the one thing. 
(In example, maybe you put water on dirt it doesn‚Äôt make mud but if you put dirt on water it DOES make mud)

My only issue with the game was it crashed on my a few times. I was able to fix the crashing but there was still a glitch were the images of my inventory looked like colored blocks. It did not really effect the game play though.

Characters you actually care about. Very interesting story told mostly through implication rather than blatant exposition. At least as many allusions as any Fallout game.

[list]

[*] Should be longer 
[*] Really too short

[b]Verdict[/b]

It's an incredibly beautiful game, with beautiful music and funny jokes. I really hope for a sequel or anything happening in the future. It has multiple choices of how to solve a puzzle, which is somewhat revolutionizing, since in the early games there was only one way to finish the game. Now I really want to replay some of the scenes because of different interactions. The one and only CON that I could think of is, that it's simply too short. I finished it in less than 20 hrs and after it I felt sad that it already ended. It had a lot of fun and interesting characters.

I experienced absolutely no bugs in my playthrough,
 I thoroughly enjoyed the voice acting, and the writing is excellent. 
I was able to play this game with my 3 year old in the room (you don't generally find such a dark story free of offensive language or innapropriate visual content so it's a huge plus for me.)
Easily the best point and click game I have ever played (I've been gaming for 27 years now I like to think of myself as a connoisseur).
If you like the point and click genre you NEED to play this.
If you don't, but like a good story then I'd say you wont be dissapointed.
You can read more about the story and setting in other reviews so I wont go into it. I'd just say that it was enthralling start to finish and the puzzles aren't brainwracking but you need to use your head throughout the game.

All in all, a short point-and-click adventure game with puzzle elements and some philosophical nods.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]

* Some very cool little puzzles add a little bit of depth and side objective. One puzzle, for example, has you exploring an encyclopaedia style database of information via an information kiosk to try and unlock information pertaining to the current objective, and is a nice side-step distraction
* Incredibly good game design, nothing is over or under designed and it takes all the good elements of old point-and-click games and none of the problems
* Fantastic sound assets, voice acting and soundtrack

[h1]Mistakes[/h1]

Finding mistakes and problems with this game is difficult, though there are some minor and non specific design mistakes.

* It can be finicky trying to find solutions to progress at times which can impact the pace of the story
* The graphics are arguably too low-res or dark. For me, that adds to the appeal

[h1]Recommendations[/h1]

Primordia is listed at ¬£6.99/9,99‚Ç¨/$9.99 which is fair for it's 6 hour+ story. There's also a [url=http://www.wormwoodstudios.com/p/primordia.html]short demo available for free[/url].

GOG offers a copy of the soundtrack, a MAC version and some other small extras at a cheaper price and may be a better choice for some.

* There are a number of interesting cutscenes and small story elements to discover, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=152701150]most of which are married with Achievements[/url]
* Everyone who enjoys Primordia should take a few minutes to check out Wormwood Studios' other IP which includes 3 games; Like a Raisin in the Sun, Salt and Beacon, and a number of short stories, all of which are [url=http://www.wormwoodstudios.com/p/small-games.html]available for free from Wormwood Studios, hosted on The Escapist[/url].

The only thing left is their own invention: machine. Machine that prospered and slowly became just like human, with their own ideas and vices. Even if they're limited by their programming, they could still interact with others like normal folk. Taking the reigns of Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin, what starts as a simple retrieval turns into a full blown adventure, albeit a somewhat short trip.

[b]Gameplay[/b]: The game itself follows the point and click style of gameplay, so its hard to screw that part up. That said, it does a good enough job being difficult and leaving you wondering ""what the hell do I do now?"" Thankfully, Crispin has a built in hint-o-tron to give you tips on what you could do or should do if you're ever stumped. The puzzles themselves are, in my opinion, pretty darn easy. The only difficult ones would be where you meet your unfriendly thief again or when you need access to a certain place with a long string of code. Other than that, it's pretty straight forward. Then again, I play puzzles for kicks so take that with a grain of salt. 

There [i]are[/i] some puzzles with different methods of completion, usually a good and bad way. Sometimes the bad way is the only obvious way, where the good way will require a save here and there to help you out should you pull an oopsie. By the way, you'll probably be doing this often. Puzzles do have ""soft-fail"" states, which can be pretty infuriating, so save often! The actual game itself is, unfortunately, pretty damn short. You could probably finish the entire game within 5 hours or so (after knowing everything and everyone and all the choices). There is [i]A TON[/i] of going back and forth. No joke, you'll probably find yourself going back and forth between robots, trying everything, for a good 10 minutes until something works. It can get annoying fast. There are also a few references sprinkled here and there to earn a few chuckles. Some more obvious than others.

[b]Art[/b]: Holy hell, this art style. While a mess of browns, it works so damn well together. Not to mention Horatio and Crispin always seem to stand out from the environment whenever possible, so that's also a plus. Unfortunately, the overwhelming abundance of browns makes finding some robots or items kinda difficult. Had to pull the hover method to find a few things sometimes. I understand its supposed to be post-apocalyptia, but sometimes you have to look away and rub your eyes.

[b]Music[/b]: It's amazing. Done.

[b]Acting[/b]: The VA in this game are beautiful and, at the same time, somewhat phoned in. Sometimes you can tell the lines are being read from the script. Other times you feel it from the heart. It is, overall, a very good experience to feel the voices actually try when they do. Funnily enough, it was the side characters that, in my opinion, had the best acting compared to our main characters.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves a good point and click adventure with a fanfuckingtastic sound track.",1432790352,1432790352,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This one kept me going though and I played it all in one sitting. What kept me going? The setting and the story were original (at least they were to me) and engaging. The gameplay and puzzles were simple enough to not get tedious without being pure pushovers. Most importantly, though, the characters were interesting and absolutely beautifully voiced -- far superior to a recent so-called ""AAA game"" that I played where I grew to hate the characters. Not in Primordia: every character was great and the voice actors and sound design was perfect: Horatio, Crispin, Clarity, Ever-Faithful, Gimbal,  Goliath, Oswald, Primer, 187th, Memento Moribuilt -- so many awesome voices and dialogues that I enjoyed immensely.",1430863797,1430863797,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Both the story and atmosphere are great, and Crispin, the sidekick, serves not only as a great jokester, but also as a nice hint system that ensures that we are not left wandering aimlessly, like in many old adventure games. 

The game is quite short, but it‚Äôs better for it, as it doesn‚Äôt suffer from overreach, and it achieves the goal of telling a good story and exploring interesting themes.

There‚Äôs not many downsides to this game, but one particular puzzle, near the end of the game (involving a kiosk), annoyed me, and didn‚Äôt played by the same rules as the rest of the game. I also thought that the voice of Horatio never felt appropriate for a robot (it‚Äôs the same actor as the main character of Gemini Rue, but in that case it fit great) , but it‚Äôs just a minor quibble.

This is their only commercial release to date but they did do two games for Indie Speed Run 2013 called Like a Raisin in the Sun and Salt. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all the humans are gone and you play a robot named Horatio Nullbuilt.  You have a broken down ship that you live in and another robot breaks in shoots you and steals your power core. Now you are on a mission to get it back.

Gameplay:
	It plays just like a typical point & click adventure game. Finding objects to use and figure out puzzles to progress further in the game. Puzzles were a little challenging for me but were fun to figure out. They require some logic and can have multiple ways to figure them out. Choices you make in the game can change things later in the game. If you‚Äôve played other adventure games then you‚Äôll have no trouble playing this.

Story:
	It kept me interested and curious to dig deeper. It all starts out over a power core but there‚Äôs a deeper secret you can uncover if you make the right choices in the game. Great supporting cast which brought some comedy to the game. I really enjoyed the banter from Crispin your little sidekick throughout the game. There‚Äôs also seven different endings to the story if you care to see them all.

Visuals & Sound:
	It has retro style graphics with some great looking hand drawn rooms. They did a great job of showing you a dark and grim world. An easy to use interface, and great voice acting. You can also change it to text only if you are one who just wants to read it all.

Overall:
	Primordia was a fun and enjoyable game. The story was a little slow in the beginning but picks up a little ways in. I laughed at times and even felt a little sad at times.

What makes this game so special is how the story develops and the awesome caracther design.

SPOILER ALERT:
The story begins with Horatio and Crispin on top of the UNNIC, a half broken airship that has seen better days.
Horatio is fixing the telescope on that resides on top of said ship, when suddenly he hears a strange noise comming from down bellow.
Appon entering the room, he is now faced with the fact that there is a giant robot that has claws and shoots lasers ( you will probably get the joke if you have played the game ) that invaded his ship by cutting a hole in it.
The giant robot demands that Horatio ""forfeits"" and that he hands over his power core, Horatio does not give in to the robots demands and the following shoots Horatio in the chest region with a lazer beam.
From then on, Horatio and his side kick crispin set off to find out who this robot was and where he went, so that they can get their power core back.

Now let me tell you something, at this point I was already hooked on the story and I was like ""okay let's continue playing for a bit more"". That ""bit"" more turned into hours and hours of continuously playing this game. This game just throws at you the mix of a great story line + good caracther development + Not too hard to figure out but still good puzzles and great comedy. It doesn't have the same funny tone all the time however

When Horatio and Crispin fail to find a power source in the wastelands they are forced to head to Metropol, the self proclamed city of glass and light. ""Free power for one and all"" is what they advertise and they do have power for everyone, but it does come with a price. When Horatio and Crispin step out of the red line train, Horatio finds a robot who collects 1 megacycle from him. At the time, Horatio has no idea of what a megacycle is, but he does find out eventually that the megacycles are brain power, we could also call it processing power. Anyways, the story goes along and Horatio finds out that his power core is stored on the big tower where Metromind is. He then goes on to try and get it back and that's when things take a darker turn. BUUUUUT I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who might have read the spoil alert and then thinks to theirselfs ""you know what, Imma read it anyways"".

The story is great, the caracthers are great, the puzzles are excellent and there are multiple endings which means you can replay the game and let me tell you, you will want to replay the game because it is so damn good!

I would rate it an honest 9.5/10 , I would even dare to give it a 10/10 .

Tuve que echar mano de una gu√≠a para darme cuenta de algunos detalles que habia pasado por alto en las conversaciones, ya que en mi caso, con un nivel medio de ingl√©s, te enteras de la historia pero pasas por alto parte de la informaci√≥n. Por ejemplo si se ponen a hablar con lenguaje t√©cnico o nombrando r√°pidamente personajes y situaciones puedes pasar por alto alg√∫n detalle que te guie en la soluci√≥n de los problemas. A parte hay caminos que cambian los finales, acciones que se pueden resolver de varias maneras y otras sirven para desbloquear logros. Estos son imposibles de conseguir en solo una partida o, si lo prefieres, puedes ir guardando bastantes veces para intentar conseguirlos desde diversos puntos.

No es la mejor aventura que he jugado ni la m√°s f√°cil por el idioma. Aun as√≠ he de decir que no est√° mal y el ambiente post apocal√≠ptico junto con la trama cyberpunk con toques √©ticos, morales y religiosos la hacen recomendable.",1425076721,1425076815,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

For some reason I absolutely love any story that mixes machines with religion.  Perhaps I have that bias as a Christian who loves science fiction and philosophy (mind/body problem anyone?).  For those who are adverse to religion, I wouldn't say it's a huge part of the game (some of the robots have their own faith, not practicing a real one), but it is certainly obvious.  If you've ever watched Ergo Proxy, it kind of has a similar feel in that regard.

The characters are great, the story is great, the voice acting is amazing... I have nothing but good to say about this game.  Expect a Horatio cosplay from me soon! ; )",1424715216,1424715216,True,1,0,0,6,True,False,False,False,,,

The story back drop is extremely enticing and will make you want to do some playable digging to find out more about the story and the characters. The puzzles are not as easy as they look and decision making trees offer differing outcomes to the story. As an added plus you get to know and love these characters and in some small way emotionally invest in them within a relatively short time. You‚Äôll laugh at their jokes, good and bad, and you‚Äôll care whether or not they succeed in their endeavors. Overall Primordia offers a very, very good post apocalyptic science fiction experience in a point/click format. Totally worth checking out!!

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Primordia is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Wormwood Studios and made available on Steam through the Greenlight system.  It features a fully voice-acted cast with a retro graphical art style that pays homage to the classical age of gaming.

[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]
The story of Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where machines have taken over the world after the human race fought itself into extinction.  You follow the adventures of a self-aware android named Horatio Nullbuilt and his companion Crispin Horatiobuilt both residing inside a crashed ship called 'The UNNIIC'.  When a mysterious and powerful robot steals their power source, both Horatio and Crispin embark on a quest to seek out a new power source which eventually leads them to the mechanical city of Metropol.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Good Retro Art Style
+ Great character writing and developments
+ Good story with an interesting back-story
+ Atmospheric environment and world design
+ Consequence-based choices that can affect the final outcome of the story
+ Fully voice-acted characters
+ Healthy game time of at least 6-8 hours depending on how quickly the player solves the puzzles
+ Steam cloud support

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- No 'HD' or Widescreen Support, in which the game opts instead for a pitiful 320x200 resolution which, frankly speaking, makes my eyes hurt.
- The game has a fetish for the color brown
- Puzzles are sometimes irritatingly difficult
- Does not expand much on the back-story which, in my opinion, is far more interesting than the main story
- The game's humor is a hit and miss

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
[b]GREAT POINT-AND-CLICK EXPERIENCE.[/b]  I Green-lit this game when it showed up in my Queue because I was very interested in its concept, setting, and back-story, and once it was released I purchased it and found a fun and absorbing point-and-click game with homage to the classical style of the genre. 

[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]
Overall, Primordia is a great point-and-click adventure game that provides at least 6-8 hours‚Äô worth of game time. In addition, for only $10 (or your regional equivalent), it is definitely worth a look especially if you're a fan of the genre.

The most notable ones (namely, those by LucasArts) were before my time, so my only games in this genre I‚Äôve played are the new Sam and Max games and this one.

This genre greatly focuses on its writing and story, and I feel Primorida does well in that regard. What starts as a simple story of tracking a robot who stole your stuff turns into a one with many hints about the world and why it‚Äôs in the state it is, and Horatio‚Äôs role in it. Each character, from the straight-laced and practical main character Horatio, to his perpetually floating, snarky sidekick Crispin, and everyone else you interact with is written with enough skill to give them unique personalities without falling into two-dimensional archetypes. While many NPCs fall into some stereotypes of their characters (ex: a soldier robot speaks how you‚Äôd expect him to, likewise with a robot with a monocle), they get moments where they flesh out their character and have some very clever lines.

The overall plot kept me guessing all the way to the end, but stayed mostly clear about what was going on the whole way through. The story is straightforward in that regard, although the littering of hints of the details behind the game world really helped the story shine when it revealed big plot elements.

However, I NEED to talk about the gameplay. It‚Äôs your typical adventure game fare of solving puzzles by figuring out how items interact with each other, listening to context clues, etc. The game doesn‚Äôt go too crazy with the solutions.

That being said, I will be honest and say I had to use a walkthrough for this game. This is most likely due to my inexperience with the genre, but many times I felt clueless on what to do. Furthermore, when I looked up the solution, I felt like the game gave me little to no inclination that what I was supposed to do may be the answer.

PUZZLE SPOILERS

One of the most ‚Äúhow was I supposed to do that‚Äù moments was when I needed to figure out how to remove rust from gears so I could open a door. I hadn‚Äôt met anyone who was a cleaning robot or the like, and I had no items on me that implied they could clean. It turns out that in one segment, there are underwater ‚Äúsubmersible‚Äù robots who, when I dunked the gears underwater where they were, cleaned the gears. When I clicked on them normally, the main character said NOTHING about their potential cleaning ability.

Another annoying one was a moment of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know I could do that‚Äù. I had to inspect a door in order to solve a puzzle, but left-clicking it gave me a quote that didn‚Äôt help me. However, right-clicking it gave me a different one relevant to the puzzle. I know that could right-click on items to hear a description of them in my inventory, but I didn‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt just left-click this door to hear the contextually-important quote for this puzzle.

END PUZZLE SPOILERS

So overall, I‚Äôd say that you should not feel ashamed if you need a walkthrough for certain puzzles in this game. The second half of this game has quite a few rather obtuse ones, which is a shame since they can halt the progression of what is otherwise a really cool story.

My other problem is a technical one: this game has no resolution options! It can only either run in fullscreen (which I think is 1024x768!!!) or windowed which has a default size that is most suitable for ants. Thankfully you can turn the ‚Äúscaling‚Äù up, which means increasing the size of the internal resolution (window size in windowed mode increases with this), but the lack of proper resolution options just strikes me as lazy to me.

Lastly, and this is sort of a nitpick, but this isn‚Äôt Logan Cunningham‚Äôs best work. He does a decent job not sounding bored in his lines and emoting properly when necessary, but either due to sound engineering, low quality audio files, or otherwise not as much strength in his voice work, he isn‚Äôt as memorable as he was in Bastion. I felt the sidekick Crispin out-did him in passionately delivering his lines. It doesn‚Äôt detract from the game at all really, I‚Äôm more just feeling like he could have done better.

SUMMARY:

I strongly suggest you guys pick up Primorida. It‚Äôs got an interesting plot inside a unique atmosphere of a post-human world, and the writing does those both justice. The puzzles can be result in premature baldness due to hair-pulling difficulty, but they didn‚Äôt stop me from enjoying the game.",1420685322,1420685322,True,2,0,0.532019674777984619,3,False,False,False,False,,,

My primary interest was the visual style, which reminded me somewhat of Machinarium, a lovely adventure puzzler I played a few years back. Primordia is more a traditional adventure game however and I wasn't prepared for how fully it sucked me in once I began playing.

It all begins with a robot named Horatio ... Horatio Nullbuilt v. 5 to be precise. Horatio has a problem, the power core to his fixer-upper airship the UNNIIC has just been stolen by a badass bruiser bot and without it, he and his floating companion Crispin will die a slow death out in the dunes, unable to recharge their batteries or get anywhere that they can do so in time. Thus begins this rather unassuming, but ultimately rather epic point-and-click adventure game.

My few problems with Primordia are the same I have with most retro-style adventure games, those being the combination of low res graphics and archaic systems making it difficult to know what is clickable and what is not. Playing ""hunt the pixel"" along with environments filled with ""flavor"" clickables, meant I missed a few crucial objects here and there, leading to a bit of frustration. Other than that however, the puzzles of Primordia are mostly logical, with only a few moments of ""how was I supposed to know that?"" or where a lack of full understanding of all that Horatio and Crispin together could do kept me confused.

The story and world building in Primordia more than make up for any shortcomings however. Set in a world populated only by robots, where ""Man"" is nothing more than a myth for all but a few devoted ""Humanists"", Primordia frames the typical post-apocalyptic dystopia in a fresh light. While at times predictable, the interactions between characters makes even a conclusion you've already jumped to a joy to behold. The dialog in Primordia oozes with personality, especially between the stoic Horatio and the sardonic Crispin. While oft-times broadly drawn, getting to know the denizens of the world of Primordia is half the fun, especially learning the quirks of their robotic society. There is plenty of lore to uncover as well throughout the game, fleshing out the periphery of the world and ultimately contributing to the main story in interesting ways.

By the time all is said and done, you'll have explored a rich world in Primordia, made choices that actually matter, and experienced one of several endings, some of which are locked by key decisions earlier in the game. On sale or not, I cannot recommend Primordia enough to adventure game fans.",1419567601,1419567601,True,5,0,0.52486187219619751,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Overall I really enjoyed this game, but there are definitely a few things that could have been improved. The game setup before you launch the game can only be accessed in the game folder and can't be launched in game or through steam. When the setup is run it's somewhat confusing and I always felt as if the graphics weren't set up right. Watching the trailer for the game confirms this when I see crisp, clean graphics on the store page and fuzzy, muddy graphics on mine and changing to higher settings just seemed to make it look worse. It seems though that that developers are continuing to make improvements, so maybe this can be fixed in the future.

Balance in the game seemed a bit lacking as solving puzzles became an effort in frustration at times. Having your sidekick Crispin give you clues helped quite a bit, but even with his help some areas required random trial and error because you had no clue what to do. Without a little help from a guide I probably wouldn't have finished the game. 

Minor gripes aside though, I had a great time playing this game. With a quality soundtrack, voice acting and funny dialogue it was well worth it.

As a point-and-click adventure game (and as a story) its all really well put together. The graphics and music create an eerie setting.

Every step taken is a direct threat to the big bad, for the mere fact you aren't obeying her every word from the get-go. The knowledge that the bad guy is watching your every move and is intelligent enough to start planning hundreds of steps ahead makes me shiver.

The puzzles are what you'd expect in a robot apocolypse: very technological, a strict sense of rules behind each one. All give off an extra feeling that speaks to me as ""yep. Puzzles caused by robots alright.""

By the end though, I didn't feel particularly emotionally affected. Which was weird because I did feel for the characters. I gasped at plot twists, I shivered at the Big Bad, and my heart felt like it was stepped on when spoiler stuff happened. But I suppose it was just brief moments of emotions rather than a lasting impact. Maybe apocolypse stuff isn't my thing. Maybe it was that the darkness of the plot sort of negated any victory.

Ein √ºberragendes Spiel, verpackt als klassisches Adventure.

Hin und wieder gibt es Easter Eggs und Anspielungen auf andere Spiele (so tauscht ein H√§ndler einen Wasserchip gegen ein G.E.C.K.)

Wer also von klassischen click & point Adventures begeistert ist, kann hier bedenkenlos zuschlagen.

Primordia is a point and click adventure game that more than rivals titles like ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, Machinarium, Botanicula, etc."" It takes place in a post human world, where advanced AI have claimed what is left of the wasteland that is the planet. 

The voice acting in this game is top notch, incorporating even the talents of Logan Cunningham. The characterization of the entire cast though, hinges on the environment they are thrust in. And how each sentience has chosen to deal with their circumstances. 

The game itself is quite serious in tone and changes in severity depending on which ending you achieve. Though there are many breaks from this dark nature when Horatio and Crispin interact with one another, often ending in clever word play or sarcastic optimism. It's something I hope they continue with a sequel or a run off featuring different characters.

So let's get those out of the way first. The biggest flaw is that the game occasionally has pixel-hunting puzzles, which are never good. Bad developers. Only time in the game I looked at guides was when I was missing something from pixel hunting (random LCD screen, bah, random floating junk, what even?)
The palette's also a bit dull overall; I get the point of having so much brown but it gets a little tiring to look at after a while, though the game's gorgeous looking otherwise.
That aside, only the postitives left. The two protagonist characters each have quite a bit of personality to them and play off each other well for plenty of amusing moments, though the game still keeps a fairly serious and dark tone throughout. The other various characters are all quite unique and memorable and serve the overall plot in interesting ways, usually having their own mini-arcs. The backstory and worldbuilding is also very rich, not outright saying a lot but leaving the pieces scattered for the player to put together. 
The puzzles are also generally good. Plenty of the standard item-trading things but there's no moon logic present there. And there's straight up logic puzzles on occasion, too, which are probably the most fun. There's no need to memorize strings of numbers or information, either; the game auto-saves all relevant data in the main character's datapouch, as well as providing a map for quick travel. It's got a lot of old-school adventure game design with a more modern feel to it, making it both well-crafted and elegant in execution.

I'm no stranger to adventure games.  I've always been a fan of these types of games but Primordia simply doesn't do it for me.  I found the puzzles to be frustrating and counter intuitive.

Part way through the game I ran into a game breaking bug that caused it to be impossible to continue without a guide.  After an hour of rubbing things on other things and clicking on every pixel I did the unthinkable and went to a guide only to find out I've run into a somewhat common glitch.  On this Steam forum I see a post from one of the writers/designers for the game say ""Sigh. If we ever do another patch, I'll make sure it gets fixed.""  This is my ulitmate woe with the indy developer.  I pay for the game and I would hope that known bugs would be fixed.  I don't like to hear ""IF we ever do another patch.""  A bug in an adventure game isn't like most other games.  You don't always know there is a problem.  You just keep trying to solve the puzzle till you give up or turn to a guide.  For me that ruined half the experience.  Now every time I get stuck I wonder if I'm wasting my time because of another bug or did I forget to pick up a cup of coffee three screens back.

It is thoughtful and meaningful, and addresses some serious theological and philosophical points, while remaining mysterious and exciting (most of the time).  However, I found the gameplay to be very lacking, in a number of ways.  I'm now going to complain about all the things I need to complain about, but do please recall that I actually enjoyed this game :)

The puzzles in this game were difficult, and not in a good way.  While many of them had ""cool"" solutions - which would be awesome in a movie, for example - they were often not cleanly solvable, in the sense that they were the only plausible solution and made everything ""make sense"" when you figured it out.  For me, a lot of the reason I want to play a puzzle game is for that awesome feeling of everything coming together when I figure it out.  This is not the sort of game that does that for me.  Here's a few of the problems that I saw:

1. Trying to create a clever solution rather than a good puzzle.  The solutions to puzzles are often the sort of zany solutions that are fun to watch heroes think of in movies, but not reasonable to force the player to think of.  In other words, they don't feel like THE solution, just A solution (and yet in the confines of the game, they are THE solution).
2. Tooooo many items.  Unlike a lot of games, in Primordia you almost never get an item taken out of your inventory when you are done using it.  By the end of the game, I have so much stuff in my inventory that the task of getting through a locked door has dozens of reasonable-sounding solutions - crowbar, plasma torch, signal transmitter to pick the lock, etc, etc - but only one of them is right (and it's probably none of the standard things I've learned how to do throughout the game, because that would be to easy).
3. Generic, reusable items.  This is one of my pet peeves in puzzle games.  When you have a generic item like a hammer, there's a trillion and five ways that the player can think of to use this item.  Even if the game designer could think of all of those, allowing those solutions would make many of their puzzles too easy.  Anyway, this game is full of generic items that you use again and again throughout the game (but are never allowed to use when you think of it).
4. Confusing items.  I had a whole bunch of electronic gadgets and doodads that it took me a long time to figure out how they worked - a signal transmitter, a decryption device, a memory reader, etc.  All of these could be used only in very specific circumstances (i.e. as far as I can tell, the memory reader can only be used to access memories from a severed robot head - which you encounter in this game a lot more than you would think!), but this information is never explicitly told to you (I never really figured out what the rules for the decryption device were).
5. Just too much going on at once.  The game is basically divided into two parts.  During each part, you slowly unlock more areas, and then can travel freely between all areas that you have unlocked during that part, which by the end of each part results in a huge environment in which to look for a small number of remains tasks.

The end result of all of this was that I played the game with a walkthrough constantly ready.  And I do not regret it :)  Most of the things I had to get help on (""most"" because I started getting lazy near the end), I think I would have felt frustrated rather than satisfied if I took the time to solve myself.

The interface is unfathomably archaic and unintuitive.  For example, the process of using an item - one of the most base necessities of a point and click game - requires (1) hovering near the top of the screen to open the tool bar, (2) selecting the inventory button to open your inventory, (3) selecting the item from the inventory, (4) clicking outside the inventory to close it, then finally (5) clicking on the thing in the world that you want to use the item on.  On all the interfaces mentioned, there are also many confusing and sometimes unnecessary/duplicate buttons.  The datachron (which automatically takes notes on things you have learned) has a horrific interface that looks something like an old school gameboy, with giant text on a tiny screen, and buttons (that you have to click with your mouse) for scolling up and down.  Similarly, the signal transmitter - on which you frequently need to set a 4-digit number to transmit - is pretty obnoxious, requiring you to click on the left and right sides of two dials (not even buttons that you can see, so it's hard to find the sweet spot to actually click on) - one to cycle through numbers, and one to cycle through DIGITS.  DIGITS.

All that being said, however, I think this game is definitely worth playing for the story alone, which like I said is fantastic.",1410401845,1410401845,True,2,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Constructive advice to the devs: Don't make your hint bot refuse to give hints, especially in a snarky tone. Make your puzzles actually make sense. Tell the player when the path of a mostly linear game is going to diverge. Better yet, auto-save right before that divergence. Allow the player to be the hero at the end.

Pros:
- Great/Mature story
- Multiple endings
- Challenging puzzles... to the point I required help from walkthrough *ahem*
- Funny dialogues
- Great voice actors
- Decent price point

Bad:
- Weak graphic engine, seriously. I even had a Developer helped me to get the game up and running.
- Art isn't up to my standard.
- A bit short game (approx 5 hours), but for 2.5 USD when discounted/on sale (or bundled), well... I guess  can't be helped.

The gameplay is just another point and click adventure. You pick up one object, deliver it to one character, get another item to unlock another area... rinse and repeat. You also are required to pay attention to hints collected. Not so much new invention in this aspect.

Story, well, I can't say much without spoiling anything, but the story is interesting enough. In fact, I wouldn't have completed the game had the story been bad. It's like, again, The Cat Lady - light story in the beginning and developing slowly until the finale.

Soundtrack is so-so, not that good but not that bad. Voice actors, however, are top notch. They really portray the characters well. Oh yes, don't forget about hilarious exchanges between Horatio and Chrispin throughout the game. More often than not I laughed on many occasions thanks to that funny Chrispin. 

Overall, Wormwood Studios, I think, have a success creating a good game for us all.

I stopped because i couldn't stand some design choices made by the developer. If you don't have a problem with some of the issues i have with this game, then it might be a better game then i let on.

This game is good, the stories a bit so-so (i am not a sci-fi fan, so this may not be the case for you), but there is a depth to the world that makes exploration satisfying. For an adventure game (and a sci-fi), it's not bad. Adventure games are usually sold based on their stroy, or their atmosphere and world; this one falls squarely with the interesting world brand of adventure games. It takes a serious stance to its story, so if you wanted another monkey island-ish adventure game, keep looking. The visuals are solid, and what humor there is (mainly in the form of referenceses, such as the crowbar) isn't very satisfying, but it's harmless. 

Where the game lost me is its choice on puzzle design. There comes a time when you have to do some tasks, like convince 2 robots to stop arguing. The problem i have with it is they don't give you the information for long, so you either have to write it down or memorize it. Only after writing it down can you try to solve the riddle. It's a bit backwards, where you have to work around outdated, missing, or omited mechanics to get to the puzzle before you've even had a chance to ponder it. There is a device that records important pieces of information, but what it deems as important can be hit or miss sometimes (such as the robot diologue riddles, where the riddles aren't written down). 

The game also does a very poor job of giving hints if your stuck. This problem, and a few others, are indicitive of the genre. One such problem is having puzzles where you have to guess at what the developer wanted you to use to progress. An example would be ruining soup in some adventure game, where you have mud, shoe polish, and a rat. Only one will ruin the soup, despite all of them being viable in a realist sense. 

In the end, this is an adventure game, so replayability is already low. I'd rather not waste my time reruning the same diologue trees over and over, which is what i found i had to do for the robot riddle puzzles. If I couldn't write fast enough (cus memorizing the jargen and name drops was not easy), i would have to guess and restart. There are i believe 5 riddles or so, so having to restart from the 4th on can be annoying to say the least. At this point, the game felt more like work then fun, so i gave up on it. I didn't want to put in that much effort for what i felt was not enough in return. 

You are expected to bring a lot to the table to get through the game. Good memory, write stuff down, and replay the same section over if you experiment. You will find that trying to force your way through diologue puzzles is very time consuming. If you get stuck and fall back on this, you might feel inticed to cheat (as i was). When i feel like i have to resort to a walkthrough to make progress, the game begins to feels like a chore. It's not fun when you have to use a walkthrough for an adventure game, because relying on it really takes you out of the world. Personally, i call it quits at that point, as i did here

To reiterate, this is not a bad game. It's a game with a vision that i fell outside of. If you played a lot of old-school adventure games, or you're a sci-fi fan, you might find a lot to like. If you find you didn't like older adventure games (or Daedelic's brand of adventure games, like The Dark Eye or Memoria), or you gravitate towards newer games like the Telltale brand of adventure games, this game may not be to you're liking.

If an old-school sci-fi adventure game with some of the problems of older games, as well a bit unforgiving approach to game design (in that you will solve problems for yourself, without more help then the developer deems nessassary) sound good to you, then this might be a game you will enjoy.

If anyone should wonder why the developer of the game commented on this review (i was very suprised about it, personally), it's because he questioned some of my reasons for quiting, as well as questioning why i would post a review of a game i played so little of. After being initially pissed, i thought a lot about the review and realized how many assuptions i had taken as fact. I heavily edited the review after i thought about it, namely because the initial review didn't convey what i wanted it to; this game was not for me, for the reasons listed above, but it might be the game for you depending on your tastes. 

The developer didn't harrass me (though initially i thought he had), and i am changing this review because i feel like it. Mark was a decent guy, and he responded more calmly and professionally then i thought he would. I made the changes i did because i was initially wrong, the developer earned my respect, and i had gone back over the review and found it unsatisfactory. If you think this makes my review less reliable, then so be it. You have been informed.",1406603523,1406788898,False,68,0,0.735548257827758789,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Visually it all works and the music pleasantly chugs along - Along with some humour from Horatio and Crispin.

Here's the problem though; Just as the game allows you to get more comfortable and eager to explore the story more, it stops becoming fun. The middle section of the game has some painful 'swap this for that' puzzle sequences that become a chore, and you are only driven to continue because of the story, and trust me, you will be looking at a walkthrough at some point, some of the puzzles are too obtuse.

It also ends far too soon - overall only having 2 main environments in the whole game is not that satisfying at all, and what could have been quite atmospheric starts to feel a little brownwashed. The character development was never built up long enough for me to feel any emotional connections with the characters, and there were some uninspired and cliched plot turns. Beneath A Steel Sky never varied too much in environment either but at least it stayed enjoyable right to the end. There are multiple paths in the game to take which will lead to different endings - but it really depends on whether you enjoyed the first run to want to do this, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play this game again for a while. Shame there's no windowed mode either, can appreciate the Lucasarts style resolution/graphics decision but couldn't easily leave the window or tweak anything.

Pros: 
‚Ä¢ Thought-provoking story full of moral ambiguities and juxtaposed viewpoints making you question your own judgments of the characters and their actions.

‚Ä¢ Varied endings dependant on choices made by the player.
‚Ä¢ Interesting scenery, good voice acting, and excellent atmosphereic soundtrack.

Cons: 
‚Ä¢ Completely unnecessary gender references at various points.  It's a world full of robots... Why does there need to be a ""female"" robot with boob-curves, or gender binary relationship references between androgynous mechanoids?
‚Ä¢ Serious tone somewhat undermined by numerous 4th-wall jokes by  a main character.
‚Ä¢ Lots of back-tracking and occasionally preposterous leaps in logic were needed to solve puzzles.  Several times I found myself resorting to ""randomly combine junk until something happens"" or having to look up walkthroughs, and being utterly baffled how someone would arrive at that solution.

Backgrounds full of rich details, as a subtle score carries you from scene to scene, each character I met was -interesting- and -entertaining-...ohh Primordia... you welcomed me kindly and at times I was deeply impressed with you. However, your on point dialogue and voice acting is what really convinced of the adventure.  If only other dynamics of the game followed suit.  

The story is very engaging but the ending left me a bit bored with it all.  The ""action"" scenes are almost comical and felt clumsy.

There were blemishes in the walking animation that I think could be easily fixed.  In the end it leaves me disappointed but memories of conversations between the lead characters, Horatio and Crispin, make me smile and feel it was all worth while.

There are more interesting characters to see. All kinds of machines who inhabit the few remaining places in the world. Be it a bomb from some long-past war that never detonated and which is worshipped for it is a creation of man, the remains of colossal titan robots buried deep within the desert or old human cities maintained by robots just enough not to collapse totally.

Primorida is a middle-scaled adventure for what I can tell. It has an interesting story, great characters, powerful voice acting (every character is voiced - and those robots who cannot talk bleep around in their own manner) and a significant amount of puzzling too. If I remember right I had to look up a walkthrough a few times, though I guess I was just blind on one eye for the solutions seemed reasonable afterwards. There are several endings, they all seem fitting and interesting in their way, and while the decision which you will see is made very lately in the game it is still somewhat relevant what you do mid-game. 

There is a significant amount of lore background. You will meet characters who share their stories and views on the world. You will learn more about them, their motivations and failures. There is a robot society that kinda imitates human society. It has it's own leadership and entities. However barely anything about is perfect. It is in demise, and Horatio is trying to find his way through. He is connected to the world around him more than he admits, and getting to know him better was done very well I think, from robots remembering him to data logs hidden within the places he visits. The art is nice, there are some great dark or soothing music tunes, everything seemed crafted together well and I thought I was satisfied with all aspects of the game even though it has been a long while since I've played it. Definitely the best adventure from Wadjet Eye Games I've played thus far.",1404751624,1404751876,True,3,0,0.486959964036941528,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is an exciting tale about two robots and their powercore. I would recommend it to everyone who likes point-n-click games (and even if you don't, this game might be a refreshing change of pace). It took me 10 hours to complete it, and I do not regret it!

I think this game gets the point-and-click puzzle/adventure aspect right in a way that many of these types of games fall short - the puzzle solving logic is straight forward and makes sense. You won't get left scratching your head, unable to move forward because of a vague goal or illogical item use to solve puzzles. Very enjoyable to play through and though I haven't finished the game just yet I can see the replay value being high considering there are multiple endings.

Sobre la parte art√≠stica se nota que se ha trabajado muy bien. Una gran ambientaci√≥n, una comicidad que te puede recordar a las antiguas aventuras gr√°ficas de lucas arts. 
Un apartado sonoro correcto, una musica que te sumerge. Unas voces bien elegidas. Si tengo que poner alguna pega en esta parte... Es que me habr√≠a gustado ver m√°s primeros planos de los personajes, me ha llamado mucho su estilo art√≠stico. Para terminar, hay ciertos finales que no han conseguido encajar con la historia ( da la sensacion que los autores quer√≠an darte a elegir un final m√°s que la coherencia argumental, Horatio es ante todo un buen chico).

Donde flojea es en el apartado t√©cnico. Apenas tiene opciones de configuraci√≥n. No puedo ejecutar el juego en ventana, no puedo modificar la resolucion del juego. Tampoco puedes modificar la velocidad de los subtitulos. El juego es terriblemente corto. En unas 20-30 horas tendras todos los logros.

The story is very interesting from start to finish.  You play as Horatio Nullbuilt version 5.  A robot sort of obsessed with fixing things, building things and correcting problems.  He lives aboard his ship with his creation Crispin Horatiobuilt version 1.  They live in the middle of a wasteland aboard the UNNIIC, a crashed ship with a long lasting power source.  That and the nearby scrap gives them all they need to survive.  A problem arises when that power source is stolen from them though and they have to find a way to get it back before they run out of juice and are shut down forever.  

The story just gets more interesting from there as you meet more and more interesting, very well written I should add, characters and solve some very interesting puzzles and problems.

None of the puzzles are overly difficult, with each having a sensible solution.  Nothing like I had always heard point and click games can be, with solutions that are so removed from reality you pretty much have to have a walkthrough to beat it unless you are supremely patient.

the fact that there is several endings as well as a way to alter the best ending slightly by how you play is quite wonderful.

All told the game shouldnt take you very long.   4-5 hours give or take allowing for some time to get stuck on what to do next I think.  Shorter if you are really fast, with some replayability in terms of endings and getting the achievements.  

If you like well written stories give it a go.

After replaying Primordia again, I have decided to keep my review as a negative one. I was simply more frustrated than I was intrigued and I found the puzzles to be exceedingly obtuse. I consider myself to be a very patient person, especially when it comes to video games and puzzles. However, I really could not get through this game. Some problems' solutions were just nonsensical and when I finally figured them out (a few took over 30 minutes of me just randomly clicking and searching), I was even more frustrated by the fact that they were supposed to be solved in that manner.

To give specific examples, [spoiler] the oil on the table that Oswald is drinking was extremely misleading. Crispin tells you that he saw oil in that area to clean the gears and that's the only oil you can actually interact with. Horatio says that Oswald won't let you take it, so it leads you to believe that you must do something to obtain it. However, you are supposed to give the gears to the shopkeeper, even though Horatio says something along the lines of, ""There's no point in talking to him."" It took me about half an hour to finally stumble upon the idea of giving it to the shopkeeper arm, because I had done just about everything else possible. Additionally, the floating pile of junk in the underworks that contains Oswald's chain and the Gospel of Man is hardly distinguishable from the gunk around it. It would be nice if the pile shined every few seconds or something to indicate that it's not just another collection of useless garbage in the Underworks. Or you could even have Crispin say something like ""I thought I saw something shiny by the bridge where Clarity shot that husk."" Also, the transmission code that you have to send to Factor ""0518"" was quite confusing considering you were given the code ""518"" and you only have a 4-digit transmitter. Of course, ""0518"" seems like the sensible first thing to do, but previously in the game when you were given a 3-digit code, you had to find the prefix number for it; ""0XXX"" would not work. My final gripe, where I stopped in this most recent playthrough, is the ""Redlien"" haiku in the kiosk terminal. Not only is it obscure and seemingly meaningless, Crispin's 'advice' is something similar to [i] it seemed like you could read that Redline poem in two different ways [/i], as if that helps at all. It didn't. I think I spent another 30 minutes on the ""Redlien"" puzzle, just rereading it and clicking on Crispin a bunch of times to no avail. [/spoiler] I eventually decided I wasn't having any fun and I should just stop. I should mention that I really enjoy the story as well as the writing. Horatio and Crispin are extremely likeable when they aren't repeating 'clues' that don't help with the puzzles. I [i] really [/i] wanted to enjoy this game; if I didn't I wouldn't have replayed it. I simply couldn't get over the confusing puzzles. Maybe I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind reading a walkthrough every step of the way, but I just didn't have much fun playing this.

 

Original Review (June 2014):
Primordia is a point and click game that has beautiful artwork and immersive music. The story is enjoyable and I encountered zero bugs. The characters are well-developed and the occasional humor is pretty funny. Sounds awesome, right? Well, there's just one problem: I didn't have fun. As I played I felt more annoyed by the puzzles than I felt happy that I completed them. Because as soon as you fix a problem, PLOP new thing for you to fix! At first, Crispin's (your comedic companion) hints helped but when you get farther he seems to just tell you what you already know. The items you must obtain are typically in places that you wouldn't expect, and the hitboxes for them are typically small. This game just drives you to the point where you try to use every item on every object, even if it doesn't make sense, to see if that will work. I found myself sitting there trying to combine my crowbar with my memory pouch. What will that do? Nothing. But I HAD to try it because I've done everything else. And then it turns out all you had to do was something simple but there was no way you could have known about it. This game has so many amazing qualities; I wanted to like it so bad. But I just couldn't. It's just not fun. Overall, I just found this game more frustrating than satisfying. If you've got the ten bucks and you LOVE point and click puzzle adventures, go for it. You might like it. But for the average gamer, I cannot recommend this game.",1402903704,1497125650,False,28,0,0.566678643226623535,5,True,False,False,False,,,

It has a LucasArts Loom vibe to it, with the protagonist Horation NullBuilt conjuring up an idea of what Bobin Threadbare would be if he was competent and decided to use his amnesia to his advantage. Yes, both characters have amnesia, have lost their home communities, and the fabric of society quite literally rests on their creations. Elements of the story definitely seem similar. The setting of Primordia is more exciting. It's a colorful combination of dystopia, cyberpunk, and steampunk. While that mix is becoming more and more common these days, finding 'good' games in that genre is still rare.

I mentioned the writing: the story is captivating if only to explore the lore, and the main plot-arc is mediocre. The dialog writing is where the game shines; Horatio's sidekick levitating robot Crispin is a very well written NPC that integrates into the game nicely. The character is used to solve some puzzles, though not too much, and offers rather direct walkthrough-type tips if the protagonist is stuck.

With it's marvelous writing, I wanted Primordia to feature more NPCs and dialog quests. A particular stand-out quest involves a logic puzzle attempting to legally assign the surname of a pet robot. While the logic is difficult to follow without pen and paper handy, the writing and voice-acting attempts to seduce the player away from choosing the logical option and I was tempted to go down a logically-flawed path (which the game teased would result in different endings and impact late-game quests). Rarely does game-dialog inspire this anymore, and it is where indie games such as Primordia stand a cut above the rest.

The game has a relatively short playthrough and the puzzles become more difficult, sometimes to the level of ridiculousness, later in the game. This is caused by the game too early allowing me to use multiple items for different quests, and in the late game suffering through trying every permutation of item combination to solve the puzzles. Nonetheless, I would recommend this game to a casual or hardcore adventure gamer, as it is both enjoyable and tells a well-written, albeit cliche story.",1402538807,1416507352,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I can't really say how without spoiling, unfortunately. Let's just say that I expected some pretty grand moments that the game never even came close to delivering. But I would still recommend this game, as parts of the story are pretty interesting and some of the puzzles and conversations are cool.

I do have to talk about Crispin though. It feels like they tried to make a Wheatley-esque character who follows you everywhere, and is kind of annoying but also endearing and adorable. Unfortunately they made Crispin too much of a smartass, so he comes off as not very endearing, not even remotely adorable, but still quite annoying. His lines also get very tiresome, as they are often just lame puns and jokes, and he doesn't have a very large number of them. And aside from scripted scenes, his comedic presence didn't change in response to the increasingly minatory plot, which often ruined the tone.

Lastly, the voice-acting generally isn't very good. The villain probably has the best voice-acting. The voices themselves? Very good, well-chosen, well-suited to their characters. But the acting itself wasn't very good. It's fairly boring and I got tired of listening to everyone speak pretty quickly.

As in all adventure games, things start innocently (loosely applied) enough as a giant robot looking like the mobile version of HAL crossed with a lobster (I know, right?) invades your home on a derelict ship and steals your power core.  You, Horatio, from a long line of previous Horatios, must now find a way to retrieve it.  It should be mentioned that everyone in this game, including you, is a robot, and as you begin to explore the world and meet its denizens, you'll find yourself wrapped in a robot existentialist's wetware runtime environment, rolling around in what amounts to be the robotic version of a Kafka story... okay, maybe not that weighty.  There's just something about the ending (of which there are many) that just never seems satisfying, even if you take all the steps to do the 'good' one.  That being said, Primordia still manages to tell its story with care and it's delivered in perfectly-bleak dialogue for a perfectly-bleak world.

Technically, the game suffers a little bit from a few questionable design decisions.  Being (I assume) an homage to the point 'n' click (PNC) games of yesteryear, the developer insisted on a low-res, 2D game - which is great - but instead of doing what most modern games do which is make a hi-res game look low-res, this game is actually 800x600.  This isn't really that big a deal until you notice that often the character sprites don't 'belong' to the scene.  In classic adventure games, different sprites were created depending on where the character is supposed to be standing; in Primordia, the technique used instead is simply scaling down the larger sprite with the end result being a much crisper sprite on a purposely-blocky background.  Not a dealbreaker, but it can be a little bit distracting.

Other design decisions that were made are quite inexcusable in a modern PNC game.  Despite the genre being declared 'dead' for years, the truth is that the genre has thrived (loosely applied) throughout the decades and made many advances, all of which are ignored by Primordia.  For instance, in most modern PNCs, there's a hotspot-highlight button to speed along play; Primordia does not have that.  In most modern PNCs, you can usually double-click an exit to skip the slow plod of the character walking offscreen; Primordia does not have that.  To be fair, it -does- have a map system for quick travel.

Finally, there is what is known as adventure-game-logic and Primordia is rife with it.  If you're unfamiliar with the term, it is a criticism of classic adventure game puzzle solutions and how they often make little logical sense.  For example, if you needed to sharpen a pencil, logic would dictate you find a pencil sharpener, but older adventure games were known for instead making you combine a stick with a piece of glass and some tape in order to whittle the pencil... while you stand in front of a pencil sharpener.  While the puzzles in Primordia aren't quite so asinine, two extremely dense puzzles spring to mind that are just bad ideas.  Like older adventure games, you could totally sit there and work it out and feel that ego boost, but I find it hard to believe that most players won't be looking for a walkthrough when they encounter them.  That being said, most of the game is paced out well so long as you can get your head into that mindframe of the 90s and just tough it out.

All in all, Primordia is an accomplished title and a lot of love went into it, especially in the art department.  For a game entirely populated by artificial beings, there is a sort of haunting organic decay that pierces almost every piece of art in the game.  Similarly, the voice direction is quite good and despite Crispin - your sidekick floaty robot buddy - sounding a hell of a lot like Otacon from Metal Gear Solid (it doesn't fit, believe me), every one of the actors gets what the director is trying to accomplish and paints a beautiful, if desolate, piece of work.

By all accounts, I did not enjoy (but did not dislike) Primordia particularly because I found a lot of the puzzles to be purposely obtuse and the story was not one that resonated with me.  However, that does not make this a bad game and so I cannot possibly give it a thumbs down.  For some people, the story is a mindblowing, harrowing look at the nature of existence, life, its foundations, and its possible future.  It is a fascinating perspective, to be sure, but I was left unsatisfied.

Thus, if you're looking for a new PNC game, there's no reason to steer clear from this one.  What I present above are not detractions, but warnings.  PNC veterans will not bat an eye at anything that goes on in this game, but fans of modern PNC games might find a lot of things in Primordia to be frustrating.  Stick with it and it mostly rewards you - just remember that it's more about the journey than the destination in this one.",1399258565,1399258565,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's a super hard game though. You'll be looking up guides for sure. Although there are a few times it seems impossible anyone can figure it out without cheating, it at least makes sense. Example: Move the cat off the couch without entering the room. other games: put the phone in the microwave which god knows why you wanted to, but it scared the cat and now hes gone. Instead the solutions are more like: search the house, find a mousetrap, ignore the mouse hole, find a ball inside of your neighbors vacuum cleaner and use the mousetrap to shoot the ball into the room for the cat to get up and chase.

Very rewarding though!",1398657468,1398657468,True,7,0,0.516446888446807861,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Resonance tried cool stuff with the character switching, but I found it confusing at times. I was stuck multiple times in Gemini Rue (which obviously could be me being stupid) and think that the game sometimes had no direction to push the player to.

Primordia is just a pleasant ride from start to finish. Some of the code puzzles are a bit hard, but never frustrating. The story is just great. I loved the dark and gloomy tones and the sarcastic MC. Set in a dying world the game throws all kind of grey moral choices at the player.

Synopsis: A fantastically simple little adventure game. Explore the ruins of Earth to find the fiend that stole your power crystal, the device you need survive. In the process, find out what happened to man, and your surprising role in the end of the world. Make choices that change the final results of the game, and tackle puzzles that can be, at times, a bit too challenging. Enjoy the humorous back and forth between the main character (voiced by the narrator for Bastion) and his flying sidekick. A great game to play in short bursts if you tend to get stuck, or in a longer sitting if you have the fundamentals of combining items in you inventory together to form the key piece you need.

Multiple playthroughs, or saving at critical moments, are required in order to see all possible endings, of which, there are at least 7, but what happens after those possible ending scenarios depends on what you accomplished during the game - who  you saved, who you let die, etc. Took me about 7 hours during the first playthrough, largely because some of the puzzles are a bit tricky (oh, wait, I can use the Signal Transmitter on that blue light to solve this puzzle...huh.). A second playthrough took about a third of that time. I found the environment and story the game told, as well as the solidness of the gameplay, well worth my $2.50 investment, but it wouldn't be a bad deal to get it for a bit more than that, because I've rated this one 9/10.",1395012282,1395012282,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Primordia is a game about robots.  Unlike Machinarium, it is a very dark and gritty setting.

The story, however, makes good use of the setting and is well-written and even includes multiple endings, but that unfortunately is the extent of the the game that I enjoyed.

Primordia is the best example I have run into of a modern adventure game succumbing to the classic adventure game failing of very confusing and obtuse puzzles.  If you don't already need a guide to complete the story, and you probably will, trying to complete the optional achievements is even worse, essentially necessitating the use of a guide.

Pros: A very well crafted and engaging universe, with it's own history and mythology. Some excellent puzzle design in parts. A haunting atmosphere facilitated by a decent soundtrack (probably inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner music). Fans of Beneath a Steel Sky will find much to like here.

Cons: Impossible to enjoy without a walkthrough on hand to get over the occasional obtuse puzzle solution. Could have done with more blind testing to deal with this, or a more robust hint system.

My one nitpick is that there are a few disappointingly easy to miss parts of the game that (unless you have meticulous saves) you could lose the opportunity to try out without starting a new game. A lot of games solve that kind of problem by the use of chapters/episodes. Not this one.

Some puzzles actually have multiple solutions and the game has multiple endings. There is a built in hint system that you have the option of using. The hints gently nudge you in the correct direction but do not give obvious answers. I liked how the story pokes fun/satirizes modern day society and its views on religion without making it overly obvious. It was done subtley and in good taste. The story is just really well done; it is one of my favorites and certainly memorable. Primordia isn't just a well designed game; it is also beautiful, sad, and poetic. Overall, definitely another great title from Wadjet Eye. 

Side note - There is an option to turn on commentary from the writers. I highly recommend turning on the commentary if you are enjoying the game - it provides a ton of context and for me made the experience even more so enjoyable.

I first discovered the studio with Gemini Rue and this is what i believe make their trademark: Point n' Click adventure games written with talent, involving dark/noire universes, with great dialogues and cynical humor. The characters are great with superb voiceacting. The graphics take it back to old school 2D art, which i am very fond of. It gives a very classic look, but remain very serious on the plot, twists or endings. This one has many, by the way. I had fun discovering them all.

Some of the criticisms i could think of is, for exemple, a couple of particular scenes or plot resolutions going too fast or being technically rushed (but they are very rare, though) and also the game being very short. Still, at the end, i enjoyed a great story with very original characters. I really wish for the sequel ""Fallen"" they might produce later on.

The melancholic mystery of the lovingly rendered post-apocalyptic setting is off-set by often light-hearted dialogue and cleverly ironic story elements (Freud's ego, id and superego populate an enormous defunct robot's skull at one point). The gameplay is deceptively simple, but my actions and choices had consequences, as I learned on my second play-through, which surprised and thrilled me. Like The Dig, Primordia's adventure game format ultimately serves as a vehicle to tell a subtle and poignant sci-fi fable. I highly recommend this game.

It was an amazing experience and I URGE any and all of you to try it out. I am thus writing a review to leave my mark.

Gameplay : the puzzles are sometimes a bit contrived, but satisfying overall. It's all a matter of investigating the area and DON'T FORGET YOU CAN USE CRISPIN. He's essential to many puzzles and I got stumped because I didn't know I could use him as an item! Otherwise, despite being occasionnaly frustrating, the mechanics are very well implemented and its a joy to interact with the game's world. 

Graphics : All the graphics in this game are simply GORGEOUS. You can tell the makers put their heart into the art (pun intended), despite there being not all that much since the game is a bit short. But you can tell from the screenshots that this game really shines visually.

Audio : The real beauty of this game : the voice-over. The voice actor for Bastion's Narrator is the main character here, and he doesn't disappoint! And neither do the other characters! Each and every robot has a unique personality, and I loved just examining every little detail just for more of the voice talent. There's even a robot that only speaks in rhyming riddles! And the music, simply entrancing. When you play this, be sure to put up the volume!

Story : As usual, you are an amnesiac and you live with your faithful companion Crispin. While short, the adventure is really gripping, and charming- despite the post-apocalyptic setting. Similar to Machinarium, the world is only populated by robots, and they live in a big city of lights! There's two main sections to the story : exploring the desert, discovering various different areas, and exploring the city, which sadly wasn't that big. Unlike the desert, which had a map with a few area markers you could jump to, the city was only a few connected screens, which blocked you with puzzles. Despite the city being a bit small and the story short, it ends (according to the good ending) on a good note and offers the possibility of a sequel. 

At least... I hope...

I give this game a 9/10, with frustrating puzzles as the only negative point. Try it out! Don't worry, there's plenty of comic relief thanks to Crispin :)",1388197088,1388197088,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story revolves around Horatio and Crispin, two robots who live in a wrecked ship.

They live far away from the city, isolated, until their power supply is stolen and they are forced to go to Metropol. As they search they discover the corrupt system that the city is operating under and Horatio's past. 


The characters themselves were enough to keep me playing. I enjoyed each one's own personality, their dialog, their story, it was all well done. The art style very well sets the tone for Primordia and was pleasing to look at while playing. The story was actually surprisingly well done and with multiple endings it just increases the replay value as well as my interests. It was challenging enough to where I felt incredibly accomplished once I finished it, but easy enough to where I didn't rage quite and ignore it for days.

The story is set in a sci-fi world, where all humans have died and only robots remain. Even though the game has an interesting setting, the story was kinda dull.

Graphics-wise the game looks like the classic point-and-click adventures of the 90's. The world looked interesting with its post-apocalyptic look, but often the graphics were quite low-res, which is unfortunate. 

Music was pretty nice although I didn't pay much attention to it. However, I thought the voice acting was pretty bad even though most reviews online say it's great. The voices didn't seem to fit the characters, which made me dislike some of them. Especially the voice of the droid companion was kinda annoying.

The puzzles were kinda hard, because they weren't very logical and sometimes required you to backtrack to a previous area to get an item that wasn't available there before. It would have been fine, if you had to use a certain item to get that other item i.e. the item was there, but you couldn't get it yet.

And what a welcome blast from the past it is indeed.  Following the travels and trials of Horatio and Crispin, this game tells an amazing story with all the conventions of the P&C genre.  But it's not QUITE to same as the games of old, such as King's Quest, or Broken Sword.

For starters, the game tells you outright that you cannot die, or can you take an action that renders the game ""unwinnable"", a flaw that made many of the classic staples of point-and-click, like King's Quest 5, atrocities of game design.  The locales don't require meticulous pixel hunts to find that one item you need in order to progress.  Travelling the maps is expidited by a fast-travel system that easily lets you jump from place to place.  Combining items is no longer a nonsensical MacGuyver mish-mash of parts, it's all explained and makes perfect sense.  No longer do you need a notebook to take down vital information, a handy item in-game records all the most relevant information for you, and your helper will at times offer a light nudge towards the next possible objective.

And that's just the mechanics.  The game's art and sound, two of the major foundations of point-and-click, which lives and thrives (or fails and dies) off it's atmosphere, are in full force.  The discoloration of the game's settings isn't just to be ""realistic"", it's a compliment to the setting and aesthetic.  And the music is highly atmospheric.  From the haunting melody of the game's menu theme ""Primordia"" to the tune of ""The City of Glass and Light"", the music compliments the setting as much as the color palette.  The characters are all fully voiced, and the voice work is clean and quality, with voices befitting each character and role.

Of course, Primordia isn't perfect.  For starters, the biggest and possibly most glaring flaw, is just how SHORT the game is.  Even if the puzzles make you spend extra time (and at first, they will), you'll likely only wind up spending 5-7 hours on this game.  It's basically over before it seems to really begin.  While it follows the classic story-telling formula, the climax of the story seems to be on you before you know it.  A point in the game that feels like the 50% is more like the 75% mark instead.  And before you know it, you're already at the final scene.  Even with multiple endings (which can be achieved by just reloading and making a different choice) the game feels painfully short-lived.  You'll be left wanting to hear and see more.

The music, while perfectly fitting the mood, never seems to stick with the player much.  I couldn't tell you a moment in the game and point out the music for it, besides the music at the main menu.  Which isn't to say the music is bad, because it's not.  But it's not catchy much.  Or very present.  The music mostly serves as a background to the game, ambience.  And it does it's part amazingly well.  I just wish that perhaps the music felt a bit more powerful at certain scenes.  Speaking of sound, the voice-acting and sound effects are a bit off as well.  Some scenes would have effects, like gunshots, with NO sound accompanying them, which removed something important to the scene.  And the voice actors themselves, while very good, still felt a bit rough.  Horatio's voice actor in particular, either does a stellar job, or seems a bit too stoic when you'd think a situation would call for a more forceful, emotional or venomous delivery.

Overall though, Primordia definitely feels like it was a game that SHOULD have existed back in the Golden Age of the adventure genre of PC gaming.  It feels like a game that I missed from my childhood and I'm just getting to sit down and enjoy it now for the first time in years, and it's not even that old!  But it takes me back to that time in gaming that I've almost forgotten and reminded me of what games I use to partake of, and that's a feeling I can't being to say how much I enjoy.  If you are a person who enjoys the point-and-click genre, grew up in that era, or want a relaxing, easy-paced game that can still deliver a great story, Primordia is worth every possible virtual cent you pay for it.",1385677288,1385677288,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Although I haven't really read books or played other games on this topic, I think it does a pretty good take on the setting, enough so to spark some creative interest of my own.  The characters and full-game voicework are for the most part fairly well done but dialogue kind of falls flat in a few places, mostly because of the script writing and not because of the voice actors.  The story is fairly cohesive and events therein are weighty and interesting, but in a few places I feel like the scenes were not given -enough- weight.  This is especially true of all the alternate endings and post-game cinematics, which although included to give the player some logical options, needed a bit more fleshing out.  It is also interesting to point out, it is impossible to game over although some decisions can change your endings.

The visual aesthetic of the game is quite nice, as is the music.  While pleasant to listen to and not annoying in any way, none of the tunes were especially catchy or easily memorable, and in a few of the dramatic scenes a stronger musical touch would have gone a long way.  Sound effects are unfortunately fairly weak, lacking thematic when operating devices and having little oomph when explosions occur, and in some places the game seems bugged and plays no sound effect at all.  The voice work has a nice robotic emulation added, although some characters seem to exhibit multiple variances in recording quality or style that doesn't seem to be a character quirk.

Performance-wise the game runs fine.  Although it resizes itself and forces fullscreen (thus making dual-monitor setups a little wonky), the resolution is not a complaint.  I never had pathing issues or pixel-hunts (just me being blind).  The game interface is functional and unobtrusive, as well as autosaving.  There are some included commentaries as well in the options menu.

All in all, I really did enjoy the game despite some of its flaws.  Its not very expensive, and it's about 7 hours of gameplay for one playthrough, with low replayability.  The setting is done very nicely and the story is good, what's there to complain about is mostly some rough edges and needed spitshining.  It doesn't ruin the game at all.

He‚Äôs a cocky little robot, full of witty banter and useful advice (although, that advice can be hard to coax out of the little guy at times).

But I digress, back to the story. All I can say is, ‚ÄòWow‚Äô. Ok, so it starts a little slow, but once you start learning about you character and his past the game really opens up. Playing as ‚ÄòHoratio Nullbuilt V.5‚Äô, your character has four versions of prior history of which the data has become fragmented and corrupted.

The voices of the many robots that populate the world have a slight tinny, and sometimes electronic sound to them, each different from the last. Being how it‚Äôs set in a world of robots, Wormwood Studios could have simply hired the same vocal artist and applied filters to his/her voice, but they haven‚Äôt gone this route thankfully. Every robot you meet oozes personality, and the voice acting is top notch, adding real character and a human touch to these robots that were, at least in the past, touched by humanity.

Despite all the things that make Primordia such a wonderful game, there are a couple of things that bugged me whilst playing through it. The first thing is the heads up display, or HUD for short. The HUD is located at the top of the screen, and when you drag your mouse up to the top it will pop down, allowing access to the various menu‚Äôs and inventory. Sometimes it can get in the way though, as it‚Äôs not located at the upper most pixel, and sometimes when you are on the lookout for that next pick-up, or you want to exit to another area, the HUD can slide down, thus breaking the immersion ever so slightly. It‚Äôs not a deal breaker by any means, but it can be a slight annoyance at times.

The second thing that got to me the whole time was the graphics. Don‚Äôt get me wrong here, I absolutely adore the art style. This game looks great, my problem is that it could have looked amazing. This game isn‚Äôt HD, you can set the resolution higher, but you then have to apply a filter to smooth out the jaggies as the game wasn‚Äôt designed to run at high resolutions! This results in the image being a little washed out when you play full screen. This wouldn‚Äôt be as noticeable on a smaller monitor, but on my 22‚Äù screen it was a slight issue.

Gripes aside, Primordia is a polished and lively world with a great story that compels you to finish the game. Clocking in at around 4-5 hours, it‚Äôs a journey so full of history and lore that you can‚Äôt help but be fascinated by it, the world they have created is really captivating. The central character and his companion guide you through this gritty world, and even though Crispin can be a little on the sarcastic side, you become attached to all you companions, and enemies.",1385469564,1385469564,True,30,0,0.76207965612411499,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Point and click adventure games depend on their characters and setting, and Primordia delivers in both. The NPC robots who inhabit the world are all distinctive and have personality, but the real centrepieces are the two main characters. Horatio, the playable protagonist, plays the straight man to Crispin, his robot sidekick who I personally found kind of annoying. However, Crispin's sarcasm and jokes do a lot to lighten the mood established by the setting. Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited entirely by robots. As a crucial and interesting element of this world, some of the robots worship humanity, who they view as their creators and the originators of the world. The world itself is interesting to look at and there are some really striking setpieces in several of the stages. I won't really discuss the story, but I will say that the ""good"" ending resolves much more than any of the other ones. Though you have to be careful as there are a couple decisions in the game that can lock you out of getting what seems to be the only ending that gives you some sense of closure. 

The graphics are done in a retro, psuedo-16 bit style that can occasionally make it difficult to determine which objects are in the background and which are interactive objects. Furthermore, my biggest problem with the game comes when you try to use these objects. Several times in the game you have to use Crispin to retrieve objects that are out of reach but the things he can do and the types of objects he can get aren't consistent. Sometimes he can bump things off ledges but other times he can't, sometimes he can use a keypad and other times he can't, sometimes he can fly into a pipe and get something and other times he can't. What it boils down to is trying everything you can and relying on trial and error to solve several puzzles as things that worked last time don't now for mainly arbitrary reasons.

Overall, Primordia is an interesting, well-fleshed out point and click adventure game that occasionally doesn't follow it's own rules. But if you can get past hearing ""I don't think that will work"" several dozen times you'll find a fascinating world filled with a host of unique characters.",1385409888,1385428503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After having learned a great deal more about history than I knew when I originally played this, I don't think I can recommend it for its writing any more. Originally I was floored by a brilliantly optimistic vision of machines overcoming their need to serve the extinct humans and start living for themselves, but most of that was my interpretation at the time and not textual. Upon replaying recently, that theme is present, but only barely. Far more central to the entire narrative is the idea of private property being more important than any societal good it might do otherwise. I'm not going to argue that metromind is some misunderstood savior, because she's not and those kinds of delusional shitheads have certainly existed in reality, but she was written quite explicitly as a strawman of any government entity that wants to extend a social safety net to its citizens, so that the rational strong-man protagonist can triumph over her with sheer facts and logic.

The fact that one of the ""good"" characters you meet along the way is a law-code fetishizing, quasi-fascistic murder-hobo also says a lot about this game's worldview.

I still adore the art style of the game, and if you're the type to play games entirely to look at pretty pictures (no judgement, I do it fairly often myself) feel free to grab this because I would rank it with machinarium in terms of wonderful world-building through back-ground art.",1385163346,1590352782,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,1593235728.0,"Sorry your views on the game changed!

I think you might consider the possibility that your present experience is no less an act of interpretation than your earlier experience, and that your present view might not be entirely based on the text of the game.  For instance, a character who says ""Mercy is malware"" might not have been presented as having the right worldview, and a protagonist who ends the game by remarking that the only way for his airship to fly again was to understand that the work of fixing it was too much for ""two hands"" might have changed his view on private property.  

To the extent that you don't subscribe to ""the death of the author,"" the game is about reasoning oneself out of bigotry and violence. Through logic and experience, Horatio overcomes his ""core logic"" of needing to destroy Metropol and the Metropolitans and learns to build and welcome the refugees from that city. But, anyway, a review is about your experience, not my intent!

And, of course, as the line goes in The Red and the Black, ""Nothing could have been more absurd. Argue yourself out of being disliked?""  Bad wine ages to vinegar; good wine ages to great wine.  It's our fault, not yours, that you didn't enjoy the game the second time round.  Perhaps in 2028, you might give it another try and see if it ""reads"" differently.  In the meanwhile, I hope you find games that you find more congenial and can wash the bad taste of Primordia's vinegar out of your mouth!  Times are tough enough without bad games."

Primordia changed my opinion of this setting and I must say, I never thought that would be possible. For starters, there are no fucking humans. Thank God! Fantastic!

Suddenly he is faced with an intruder who attacks and robs him of his ship's vital energy core.

So I gave it a try, and was blown away by how much I absolutely enjoyed it. It's your standard point-and-click; you collect items, open your inventory, and can combine items or use them on characters or objects in the world to progress. So there's little to mess up when it comes to controls, and Primordia succeeds there. 
The game is set some ambiguous number of years in the future. The world is inhabited by robots, no sign of organic life anywhere. You play as Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot designed to build and repair. While aboard your ship, the Uniic, you are attacked by a strange robot and stripped of your ship's power core. Left without transportation and limited power keeping you running, you are left with no other option but to wander out into the world, trying to track down a power source, or as a last resort, enter the city of Metropol, ""the city of glass and light."" Not much is known about Metropol, other than there is supposedly unlimited power for everyone. Still, Horatio has his reserves about entering the city; despite his logic-driven robot nature, he doesn't trust the place.
As I mentioned, the art style was much of what first intrigued me, and it's prevalent throughout the game. It's designed to look very old-school and pixelated, but the amount of detail that can be projected by so few pixels is astounding, not to mention the general apocalyptic dystopian feel it gives off, which as a fan of Fallout, I enjoyed all too much. 
Overall this was one of those games that gave me that feel of reading a really good book; I'd sit down and play and not want to put it down until I found out what happened next. The only problems I had were a few vague or confusing puzzles, in which I had to resort to the old ""try everything with everything on everything"" play method common to point-and-click games. Aside from that, the game offers multiple endings, some far more underwhelming than others, which left me feeling a tad unsatisfied. Still, the game was extremely enjoyable, and one of the few games that I'd almost like to forget playing so I could enjoy it all over again.",1379141185,1385407224,True,4,0,0.545454561710357666,3,True,False,False,False,,,

I should one day get around to seeing all multiple endings as I'd like to know how you can complete the game with all robots and so on.

Edit: The story is set on an Earth far in the future where humans are such a distant memory that robots view humans as some kind of a god-like beings complete with a bible that teaches robots that mankind is ""A perfect machine from the heavens that built them in it's own image"" and so on. You even get quizzed on this to get a bomb from a old military robot that's guarding them.

The start of the game you play as Horatio Null-built who even built his own little sarcastic companion who can help out in reaching items and such that are out of reach. Horatio is building a ship to take off from this planet where energy is scarce and he had just discovered a energy core, but a robot comes and steals it, taking it back to this city that Horatio has to investigate to find out where the item has gone.

I do love how all the robots have a surname based on who build them and because Horatio has amnesia, he doesn't remember who built him, but his companion's surname is ""Horatio-built"" and there's even a case where you have to solve a dispute between two who have fallen out and each wishes to name the robot they created together and take full ownership of him.

As you can guess, the oldest and rarest of machines are named ""Man-built"" because they were built by humans and had most-likely seen and interacted with humans when they were still on the planet that is now a giant polluted trash-pile.

The tale follows robot Horatio and his floating companion Crispin as they try to retrieve a power core stolen from them by a boxy robot with lasers in a post-apocalyptic style world - however, the story is much more than this basic premise. One of the central questions the player wants answered is what exactly happened to the humans who presumably once inhabited this Earth and created the robots left behind. Added to this is a tapestry of moral and philosopical themes such as the meaning and existence of free will, individuality, progress, and what constitutes the 'greater good'. These sometimes rather heavy themes are pulled off through excellent writing, and are offset by a quirky humour that runs through the whole game. This off-beat humour and occasional breaking of the fourth wall are reminiscent of some of my favourite, genuinely old-school games such as Simon the Sorcerer, and I think anyone who was playing this kind of thing in the early 90's will appreciate it. The worldbuilding and background detail is fantastic - my one gripe is that the game just doesn't go far enough. There are hints of exciting other locations that we don't get to visit, and the larger philosophical themes are never fully explored. 

As this is a game and not just a visual novel, I should probably mention a bit about the gameplay - it's pretty much standard of point & click games, and uses the traditional inventory system. Nothing stood out as unique, but equally nothing was inconvenient or jarring. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, and there's plenty of hints on hand from Crispin if one chooses to press him for them (it's also pretty fun to hear him getting annoyed and snarky when you try and use him too many times). I prefer simpler puzzles so the flow of the story doesn't stall, but others might find this game too easy. 

In terms of visuals, the pixel art is gorgeous, and the colour palette of browns, rusts and muted golds perfectly realizes the dusty, disued world. The audio content is also great, from the music to the voice acting. Even minor characters are voiced, and the robot voice effects are pretty cool.

Overall an 9/10 for this game. The presentation is beautiful both visually and aurally, and beneath this is a solid story rooted in a world that feels like it really could be our future. Horatio and Crispin are likeable and memorable characters to journey through this tale with, and their easy banter creates the emotional anchor to this crumbling planet. Points are lost for the sense that the game could have been bigger both in terms of the number of locations, and the philosophical ideas that never seem to be explored quite as far as you hope. Regardless, 'Primordia' is highly recommended!",1362319797,1362319797,True,1,0,0.501915693283081055,0,True,False,False,False,,,
