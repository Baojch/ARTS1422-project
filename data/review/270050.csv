I saw the steam sale one day and went, will I buy this finally or remove this out of respect for the developer?
And honestly, it came for me at the perfect time in my gaming life, as I was coming off a bad experience with another game. In terms of ""flaws"" the art in this isn't high grade, and there's some minor age issues I'd warn ahead of time (you will need to go and change the resolution in a txt file manually if you use a 4k resolution monitor or television; then you must also change the resolution in-game. controller may require toggling steam input) 
But overall I like it. its a roguelike game that you can easily lose 30 minutes-2hours in a run with its charming subplot humor that plays well with controllers. Even when you try to spend extra time using the avoidable side quests for cash/exp/gear, you will always be at risk if an enemy boss stats are high enough (enemies have a potential to crit just as much as you are) so you're never truly safe. And with variable difficulty, with the dungeons also getting progressively harder, the casual player can enjoy themselves just as much as the hard nosed roguelike lover. Usually in this kind of game, its either mostly easy, or way too hard, so it tells you the devs actually put some thought into this. And a certain character making an appearance from another game, for those who know, genuinely caught me off guard and made me excited! So kudos for that collab.
Good purchase, one that if you're looking for a low end spec time waster you'll find many far worse then this especially at its price point. I think if you're looking to get into the roguelike genre, this may be a more gentler introduction then most to see if you would like to try this genre or not.",1711801455,1711801455,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's got a nice simplicity about it and it's good for killing a few minutes when you have nothing else to do.

But the big reason I can't recommend it is because the game trains you to just keep spamming your most basic attack on every enemy you come across, and then when you encounter a boss you end up attacking it too quickly and not noticing you've been losing huge chunks of your health and need to use a recovery item.

There are so many ways that could be mitigated - some kind of warning noise when your health gets too low, purposely slowing the player's actions down when facing a much tougher enemy, having an auto-heal feature.

Or even if the rest of the gameplay had more substance than 'charge through everything and occasionally manage your inventory or visit a merchant' it might help to avoid training the player to just spam attack everything.

(Note that the way you interact with loot-containing obstacles on the map is also to just charge into them, the same way you attack things.)",1701559446,1701559485,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Spielzeit: ca. 9 Stunden
Spieldurchläufe (2 beendet, erste 2 Karten, 3. Karte Endbosse)

Simpel, durchaus anfixend, aber leider furchtbar unbalanced und 0 geeignet für kleinste Aufmerksamkeitsschwächen

Es gibt ein hervorragendes Review von ""Ryutaa"", das zumindest bei mir direkt das erste Review auf der Shopseite ist (English). Er/Sie beschreibt im Grunde in aller Ausführlichkeit, warum das Spiel ziemlich sinnlos gebalanced ist. Jeder Mini-Questboss kann der Tod sein. Im Grunde sind alle immer OP, wenn man sie direkt von der Karte säubern will und nicht erst z.B. in Level 3 geht und später zu Level 2 zurückkehrt. Ja, man kann jeden Boss durch diverse Tricks runterschleifen, aber das ist für so ein simples Spiel viel zu komplex. Wie Ryutaa schreibt, sind alle Range-Gegner eine Katastrophe, wenn man selbst nicht in der Lage ist, sie vor dem Angriff zu töten. Andererseits sind die eigenen Range-Heros völlig op im Vergleich zu den Melees. 

Das man nicht mal 1 Extraleben bekommen kann (wäre für diese ""kleinen"" Abenteuer vielleicht zu viel) ist trotzdem frustrierend. Ja, auch was andere schreiben stimmt: Das Spiel an sich geht, wenn man zügig ist, 30-60 Minuten, danach ist man ""fertig"". Man kann die Runs noch auf 2 ""neuen"" Karten wiederholen, aber die gehen alle ungefähr gleich lang. Trotzdem: Man stelle sich vor, man spielt langsam, vorsichtig, full clear aller Quests (tolle Idee an sich!) und Gegner und hat sich Equipment/Level aufgebaut, die basically alles oneshooted und dann stirbt man, weil man einmal kurz nicht aufpasst und den Dot nicht sofort bemerkt hat (ist mir im letzten Run auf der 3. Karte passiert...)

Alles, was man tun kann, ist wieder von vorne anzufangen. Dafür gibt das Spiel zu wenig her. Zu wenig Spannung, Inhalt, Belohnung. Konstantes Konzentrationshochhalten, obwohl 99% der Zeit nix relevantes passiert, wenigstens kann man Musik dazu anmachen, da der Sound seine Abwechslung schon nach 10 Minuten verliert. 

Ich habe, um mich mal in das Spiel vorzutesten (ich hatte durchaus vor danach bewusst den Schwierigkeitsgrad zu erhöhen) mit einfach angefangen, also 1/4. Ich habe sofort den Krieger gepickt, weil das normalerweise meine Klasse ist, schön rein in Nahkampf, viel Leben, viel Rüstung, dicke Waffen. Zumindest im klassischen RPG-Auswahlverfahren mit Magier und Schütze. Nun, was soll ich sagen, nach 3 frustrierenden Runs hätte ich das Spiel fast schon wieder deinstalliert. 
Weiter gings mit Mage. Das ist einfacher, aber durch das Mana-Management auch langweilig/anstrengend. 
Weiter zum Ranger/Schützen und, naja, viel leichter gehts wirklich nicht mehr. Die Bosse sind zwar immer noch ein Pain in the A**, aber im Grunde kann den Schützen nix stoppen. Außerdem hat er nicht so viele Skills, also kriegt man meistens schnell Gratisbücher und kann die Fähigkeiten wirklich gut nutzen. Vor allem ""Schlaf"" hatte stets 100% Erfolgsgarantie, auch bei jedem Boss, das ist völlig op. Aber selbst das hilft nichts (diesmal auf ""Normal""), wenn man, wie beschrieben, nur 1 Sekunde nicht aufpasst, wegrennt, den Dot nicht sieht und einfach stirbt...

Ich will nicht wissen, was man auf Schwer und Hell so erlebt. Dafür muss man das Spiel wahrscheinlich sehr, sehr lieben...

Fazit: Das Spiel ist eigentlich grundsolide und macht auch zuweilen Spaß.

With an incredibly simple design that lacks any draw to pull players in to replay the game, some key missteps in the battle system, and an imbalanced roster of playable characters, this subpar roguelike offers players no reason to purchase it above the more polished competitors in the indie roguelike space. Go try [i]Vampire Survivors[/i] if you want a taste of mobile game-inspired mindless combat done right, or the [i]Rogue Legacy[/i] games for fantasy-themed roguelikes that actually satisfy.

You play as one of four fantasy archetypes: the Warrior, the Wizard, the Assassin, or the Shaman, each with their own attack pattern and abilities to discover. You're tasked with crawling through floors of a dungeon with successively more difficult enemies. Play a game of cat-and-mouse as you try to survive and grow stronger, looting treasure and equipment along the way to enrich and empower yourself. Can you make it to the bottom of the dungeon?

[i]Quest of Dungeons[/i], which to my knowledge began its life as a Steam game, feels like a mobile game in a bad way. The experience presented is an extremely rudimentary roguelike: face randomized assortments of enemies in random map layouts with random item drops. The problem lies not with the randomization but the lack of content to actually be randomized, as every floor looks and feels the same, pretty much every enemy has the same nondescript melee attack, and the treasure hunting/equipment purchasing loop feels unrewarding due to just how little of an impact new weapons and armor have on the gameplay experience. The draw of this really is just exploration and killing enemies, over and over and over again.

Combat in this is a rote affair, too, because of what little info the game shares with players. By far the biggest challenge here is not the final boss nor floor bosses, but random minibosses that can spawn in due to taking quests and that scale way above the player's level. With most enemies being disposable mooks when one plays attentively, you'll never know when one happens to come along with ranged attacks that can one-shot you. Any indication of enemy power level could've helped solve this. Enemies also can't be fled from if they get too close as they perfectly track player movement, and downing healing items takes a turn of combat, meaning there's no way to gauge an enemy's strength and tactically retreat. So combat is just a random guessing game - and it only takes one bad roll of RNG to send your efforts down the drain.

Even the four playable characters are inherently imbalanced. The Assassin (who should've been named The Archer) is far and away the strongest playable character, as they're the only one with a long range basic attack that's not subject to mana costs. This means only one-shot attacks from long range threaten them, while everyone else is forced to trade health for experience points in melee combat, vastly increasing the risk of engaging an unbeatable foe. Even on Easy Mode the imbalance in character design and unspecified threat levels of enemies tarnish the player experience.

[i]Quest of Dungeons[/i] is an undercooked roguelike. Uninspired enemy design, imbalanced character loadouts, and a lack of crucial information provided to the player makes this an annoying and shallow experience. For most players, you'll get to see everything there is to this game from a partial twenty minute playthrough. While some players familiar with the design pitfalls of the cheap mobile game formula may feel at home with this title, I doubt many would be interested in coming back for seconds.

From controls that lack basic functionality (eg, the ability to use left or right click to move and the other click to attack; Instead, expect very limited mouse controls) to lacking user conveniences like pathing-pausing on monster reveal, to clumsy interaction polish, the game's design is extremely dated, being in some ways worse than games from the 80s and 90s, and certainly comparing poorly to most modern offerings. 

The keyboard only movement is too clunky to favor, and the mouse movement.. well, it's so quirky that my attempts to attack the boss monster simply got me killed before I could even take another action, due to it deciding I should circle around the boss instead of attacking it with my bow. Solid. 

And let's not get into those moments where the game just flat out didn't let me attack at all, for no clear reason whatsoever, and I died to trash mobs for, again, no reason whatsoever. And this happened, well, a lot. Honestly, this may be one of the hardest roguetypes I've ever played, for all the wrong reasons.

So from that, we can determine that the game is significantly lacking in both user appeal and polish. But then there's the gameplay which, well.. I honestly prefer Castle of the Winds (1989), or similarly straightforward flash roguetypes. Even the most basic roguetype options out there, including the three decade old CotW, have better developed loot, {narrative, lore, and/or questing}, combat, and other systems. Ouch. But when you also factor in that so many roguetypes have been presented over the past three decades, especially in more recent years, that've long since pushed past the basic explore+click to attack generic mobs+basic RNG loot dynamic..

Well, to call this ""unambitious"" is an understatement. Frankly, it's not on par with your basic free flash roguetype, and it's structured in fundamentally the same manner. So why pay $5 for something you can get a better experience on for free? Nevermind all the paid options out there that are legitimately interesting, or traditional offerings that far exceed this game on both controls and gameplay options.



So, rather than being an issue of the game being outright bad.. Well, ""extremely low-effort knockoff of Nethack/CotW/etc"" would have been a hard sell for recommendation decades back, nevermind these days, where we're comparing roguetype releases against entirely different games. Simply put, it's not something most modern gamers would expect to be paying money for and, if we go past that, it's just not an interesting enough game to hold up against competition even if it were a free offering. And I really want to emphasize that, the game is just profoundly uninteresting. 

Again, it's not only lacking many modern systems of appeal, it's lacking nearly all of the older rogue format game systems as well. It's an extremely barebones offering that really'd only appeal to those who want a barebones tactical RPG without any real unlocks or tactical depth or exploration appeal or questing or, well, anything. And even if you've got such unique tastes, you can still find offerings with better polish on controls. 


Put another way: You see what's listed on the store page description for the game? That's literally all the game has. Don't expect any unlock systems, and combat depth, any interesting dungeon mechanics, or anything else. Just expect the barebones elements listed on the store page. 

In fact, let me cover those real quick:
* Procedural dungeons, 4 difficulty levels, Procedural weapons, Permadeath: Okay, those're all just basic, and none of them are really done especially well despite that.
* Boss encounters: Also standard, and also underdeveloped. Other'n being able to kill you easier, and having different skins, these are pretty uninteresting, and don't earn you anything notable. In standard gaming terms, these'd be more in line with ""Elites"", rather than mini-bosses or bosses.
* Quests: These are basic ""find X monster on your floor and defeat them to get bonus xp and gold"" bounty tasks, as per a typical MMO or Final Fantasy side quest. As far as I've seen they only first start appearing on the second floor of a dungeon. Nothing remotely interesting from any of a gameplay, lore, or reward perspective.
* Shops: Uninteresting, just like the loot system on the whole.

And let's not forget that you also get:
Terrible controls, a very glitchy game, poorly polished recognition of input, and buckets of frustration.

Beyond those extremely basic things, there's just nothing else to the game. Rather, you DON'T get these staples of the genre: User-convenience features. A full looting system. Special encounters. Pets. Complex weapons and spells. Complex dungeon layouts. In-game or post-game trait, ability, or feature unlock functionality. Tactical depth. A good time.

As a final note, non-toggleable perma-death is an absolutely terrible inclusion in a game that sabotages your controls. For that reason alone, I'd Not Recommend this game, even if it did have merits- which, again, it sorely does not.

If you absolutely have to play this game, at least do it with the warrior selected. At least you don't generally get screwed over too badly if a melee character spontaneously suicide rushes enemies. Though if that's what you're into, I'd just recommend you get a D&D CRPG and play as a barbarian, with suitable associated roleplay, instead.

- Guerriero: buono per i primi livelli, ma dovendo affrontare tutto in mischia (ossia: avanza contro il nemico e continua a schiantarti addosso fino a che non muore) è totalmente inutile contro un qualunque boss (che per ragioni assurde infliggono una quantità di danni spropositata, tanto da essere inaffrontabili in mischia);
- Mago: tanti danni coi sui incantesimi, ma la rigenerazione del mana è terribile (2 di mana ogni quanto, 20 caselle percorse?? seriamente non esiste alcun oggetto per la rigenerazione del mana, ad eccezione delle pozioni? no equip? il bastone da mago è nulla di più di una spada, non serve ad altro!); pochi incantesimi realmente utili (palla di fuoco iniziale, pioggia di fuoco solo perché saltuariamente incendia e teletrasporto... gli incantesimi di cura sono inutili se consumano la metà del mana totale) 
- Arciere: vedi mago, ma togli il mana e metti un arco che fa la metà dei danni (ma almeno le frecce sono infinite!), non male fino a che il nemico non te lo ritrovi in faccia perché le tue frecce non gli fanno danni..e  quindi sei morto, perchè giustamente i boss fanno una quantità di danni pari alla tua vita massima, il che buol dire che sei sei di fianco a loro sei morto
- Druido: un guerriero... depotenziato?

In conclusione: sconsigliato, tutti gli equip sono uguali, o quasi (+ difesa per tutti in genere), e i boss in normale ti fanno fuori con un colpo, così a caso (e se ti sono di fianco? non puoi allontanarti da loro se non sei un mago, curarti non ti serve se tanto ti tirano via, se va bene, metà vita massima ad ogni singolo attacco)... in poche parole: sconsigliato",1641427845,1641427845,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ein Spiel, so einfach und doch so schwer. Quest of Dungeons ist ein prozedurales Roguelike, dass aussieht (und sich manchmal auch spielt) als ob es schnell im Game Maker zusammengezimmert worden wäre. Quadratische Tiles in Pixeloptik, man springt immer ein Feld weiter, Animationen gib es kaum.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2570362496

Und doch... es hat etwas. So simpel wie es ist, so schwer ist es zu meistern. 
Anfänglich stehen vier Helden zur Auswahl, später fünf, die sich alle in ihren Fähigkeiten und im Kampfstil unterscheiden. Nahkampf, Fernkampf, Magie, gemischt, für jeden ist was dabei.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2570362809

Das Prinzip ist einfach: man läuft durch den Dungeon - quasi rundenbasierend, man bewegt sich ein Feld, dann die Monster - killt Monster, lootet, bringt das Zeug zum Händler, verkauft es und kauft Tränke oder Equipment. Mittels Treppen wechselt man eine Ebene nach oben oder unten. Dazu gibt es ab und an eine Tafel mit Quest (töte xy, finde yz#) oder ein Bossmonster. Soweit so einfach, oder? 
Nein - Zum einen geben Skills und Spells mit Cooldownzeit bzw. Mana dem Spiel etwas taktische Tiefe, Findet man die richtigen Schlüssel (oder kauft sie) bekommt man Zugang zu wichtigem, starken Equipment. Zum anderen verzeiht es keinen Fehler. Da hat man einen schon quasi unbesiegbaren Helden, öffnet eine Türe und trifft den falschen Boss oder das falsche Questmonster, sieht nicht gleich, wie viel Schaden man frisst oder verklickt sich, läuft quer in den Raum und zack- Permadeath, man beginnt wieder von neuem. Neues Level, neue Gegner, man unterschätzt eine Art (Blutungsschaden, Frostschaden) oder ein kritischer Treffer und man verliert mehr Energie als man dachte ... Und in der Tat - die meisten Tode wären vermeidbar, wenn ... ja wenn man die Aufmerksamkeitsspanne hoch halten würde. Doch umso stärker man wird, desto automatischer kämpft man sich durch und übersieht dann eben genau das eine kleine Detail, wegen dem man dann abkratzt. Und das ist der Nervenkitzel daran, den perfekten Run hinzukriegen. Mein erster Sieg dauerte etwas über eine Stunde (Einstieg bis Boss besiegt)- ich hatte zu dem Zeitpunkt aber schon 10h im Spiel verbracht.

Für ein paar Euro ein schnelles Spiel zwischendurch, das oft frustriert, aber hin und wieder gönnt. Mir macht es Spaß und ich geb mir das Spiel immer wieder mal. Vollpreis ist ok, wie etwa ein Mobilegame ohne Ingame Transaktionen. Im Sale macht man nichts falsch.

It's a simple game, yet can be challenging. 

Highly recommend this game.

The music is repetitive and oddly upbeat for a dungeon crawler. Most traps are visible and are not a threat. The game is too easy for a roguelike.

But I wanted to get all the achievements.
Disregarding that, it is actually a really cool adventure/rogue-like dungeon crawler.
It has 5 unique characters with different builds with 4 different levels you can play them on. 
The game is pretty challenging even on the easier difficulties but still feels rewarding when completing bosses or stages especially with the achievements that are very well implemented.

I do have a few issues with it though. 
The biggest one for me without a doubt is the permanent death, coupled with the useless feature of savegames.
Why have a save feature if you would die permanently anyways? This feature feels overlooked and lazily implemented.

And then there is the problem with character balancing. Some of the characters are literally useless especially on the higher difficulties. The necrodancer for example is awful in most aspects, she has a few good defensive spells but pretty much all her offensive spells are very weak in comparison to the mage. The Assassin class (which is basically an archer build), is way too overpowered compared to the other classes. It has a long range attack without using mana plus it has spells like sleep which can never fail, which is just insane. It can also move much faster in the grid than the other characters which doesn't really makes it more powerful or anything, it just makes it faster to complete a level.

Another thing I noticed is the difference in the difficulty levels. I noticed there is a difference between like Easy and Hell. But I can't really put my finger on what exactly makes Hell more difficult than Easy. Because when i played my Hell playthrough it didn't really feel much differently compared to easy or normal except that I cleared the rooms more subtly. I still got an amazing build with great weapons and armor and stuff. And I easily managed to kill the last boss. It could be the economy system that maybe made it less lucrative to use the merchant or something i'm not sure.

Also a cool thing I noticed when I started playing this game is that it uses the same sprites as the GPS-based RPG game Orna uses. Which I also play and recommend. It's on google play and appstore as well i believe. 

In conclusion a good casual game worth playing, I typically enjoyed playing it while watching a podcast or listening to music.
I think I got this game for free somewhere or in a bundle. So content in comparison to my price 10/10. For 5 bucks, I probably rate it 7/10.

It's a bit fun crawling around the generated dungeons and it gives you a retro feeling. But there are just a bit to much RNG and you have to get lucky to have a good chance of beating the game. For example, some times you get a lot of tomes that are almost crucial if you want to kill some of the bosses further down the dungeon. But if the RNG is not in your favor you will just be killed. Bosses are usualy placed in a way where you have 5 round before they get close to you and when they do you are just in for a battle of luck unless you have good tomes in stock. Usually your normal attack get dodged andthe boss kills you in 2-3 rounds.

Two issues I had with the game were certain quests you would recieve, and aspects of the final bosses.
There was a drastic difference between them and the typical enemies you encounter, given that they have the potential to kill you in two turns. When I ran into these moments, I did feel cheated, but that's what comes with permadeath games. 

It is entirely possible that I just feel this way because I often fall into auto-pilot mode, where I move the character as if it was a real-time game, instead of move tile-by-tile and plan my actions. (If you are willing to adopt some unusual tactics, you can make it through. You decide. *shrug*)

Nevertheless, it's a fun romp, so its worth taking a look at.

Pros:
+ Random generated dungeons.
+ Unique characters and their skills.
+ A lot of items and weapons.
+ Two kinds of side quests. You need to kill a boss or find something.
+ Sometimes you can find secret floor in a room.

Cons:
- Player is alone in the dungeon. You can't form a team in this game, and it doesn't support co-op mode.

There was a game I was obsessed with years back called Nethack, a game where I would get so dialed in with it, it felt almost like I was in a trance. You look up after playing for a little bit and realize that you've been playing for three hours. This is very similar to that game.

QoD is a rogue-like game (look up the original Rogue dos game to get an idea what started it all), much like Nethack and ADoM. Those games had extremely simplified graphics, no sounds, very little dialogue, but enough to get you into the spirit of adventure. A dungeon crawler. They were simple at the surface, but way more complex I realized the more I played. It was easy to fall down the rabbit hole.

QoD has that same spirit of adventure, but in a much more manageable (but no less addictive) way. The cute graphics, the nudges of humor, the little sounds, the music. I loved that there were tiny quests to do. One thing Nethack and ADoM lacked was the short-game payoff. The quests were long and it was rare to finish a quest before you died, but there are at least three or four quests on each floor of QoD. It makes it much more satisfying for the short game sessions.

There were a few differences that made the game a little more restricted and that I missed, such as clicking on the overview map to quickly get someplace, the ability to use an item on another item or throw it at an enemy (would have been nice to heal my minion). While the depth of the originals is a dangerous beast to approach, it does make it so rich--gaining a deity's favor, sacrificing corpses, identifying objects...

*ahem* anyway, yes. I recommend this game. Not only is it a fresh and modern take on an old classic, but the short game session appeal is unmistakeable.",1553853447,1553853447,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1. Game runs MUCH worse than it ever did, moving can cause incredible frame-rate issues that clear up sometimes for a minute, then go back. Makes everything very jagged and annoying.

2. This could just be coincidence, but in the last 3 playthroughs I've played, the number of quests and dungeons have lowered to 2 quests and 1 boss every 2 floors on average.

3. I never had this issue until now, which could just be my fault: in my last 3 playthroughs, I've been killed by accidently pressing a floortile instead of the ability. It's incredibly frustrating to know, 'oh, I died because I mis-clicked'. And yes, in the settings I have 'Stop moving when hit', yet they don't even when hit. So unless the setting is just poorly-named and does something else - it doesn't work.

I love this game, and I've been wanting to get more achievements for it; it's been impossible though, thanks to mistake alone that has got me killed. Some of these issues I believe have been around since when I last played, before the recent update - doesn't change a thing though, really.

Overall, about what you would expect given the price, to be fair. But then again you can buy Tales of Maj'Eyal for only $2 more so... meh?

[i]TL;DR version: Just buy it! You WON'T regret it (IMO), I know I didn't and my potato PC loves it![/i]

Having bought almost all the platform versions (3DS/2DS, android & PC) of this game, I've probably accumulated a total of 100+hrs of gameplay time. If you like rogue-like TD dungeon crawlers, at least check it out, definitely worth every penny (IMO). But, that's not the game's only focus. It has a strong focus on inventory management (deciding what to keep to sell and use and what to leave behind), procedurally generated (randomly generated) dungeons, unlockable classes, unlockable stories/crawls, beautiful nostalgic pixel art, good and dark humour, strategy and it even presents a customised experience so you can choose how hard, big, deep/tall you want your crawl to be! I personally love this title and have it in my featured games tab on my profile and aim to get all the Steam Badges and achievements for it and beyond! With the developer being so active, it gets regular updates, bug fixes, hotfixes and new features. Plus, it's replayability is immense! Of all the playthroughs I've done, not a single one has been like an other. I say just give it a try! If my potato can play it, so can yours! ^~^

ADDITIONAL NOTE: The developer of this game is VERY interactive w/ us players on multiple forums and social media fronts (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit), providing him w/ bug reports and suggestions that constantly help him update and upgrade/hotfix the game.

-Les personnages qui ont vraiment des caractéristiques très variés et qui offrent un gameplay complètement différent tout en restant facil à prendre en main.
-Le tour par tour est bien réalisé mais un peu traitre quand on passe en spped run.
-Les effets de vision du personnage sont bien pensés, on voit pas l'autre bout du donjon si on a un mur devant nous!

Bref on a tout ce qu'il faut : un donjon, des boss et de la baston

Mais au bout d'un moment c'est assez répétitif, on arrive très loin dans le donjon une fausse manip (ça pardonne pas) et bim one shot tu recommences à zéro.

Au final les seules choses que je repprooche vraiment à ce jeu c'est que sur les versions smartphone et Nintendo 3ds on peut pas passer de tour (touche ""Entrer"" sur PC) et ça complique beaucoup quelques techniques que j'ai réussi à utiliser sur pc.

This is not worth your money at all. And here's why in this long list of issues.

-The game is overly simple. The game throws at you ton food items that any experienced Roguelike player would expect them to serve a greater purpose aka hunger. Here, their only purpose is simply to (restore a bit of HP). They are basically just lesser Health Potion. Also, The only strategy involved with any character is to spam skills whenever they are available. There's no wands of teleport or rings of polymorph to be found here. No fun silly deaths that you'd find in other roguelike eitheir. Here. [i] Your deaths will be solely attributed to dying to a boss you shouldn't have tackled yet.[/i] (But you had no way of knowing prior).

- One design choice of other turn based Roguelike is to walk or pass a turn to restore HP, usually you can fast foward this to make this take second and you can't do it forever or you will starve. In this game however. It becomes a gigantic issue that ruins replayability. 

As the Warrior. You gain a very small chunk of HP by walking 5-6 steps. It takes about 2 minutes of walking back and forth aimlessly in a room to be fighting fit again. THIS IS THE OPTIMAL WAY OF PLAYING. THE GAME ENCOURAGES YOU TO DO SO SINCE THERE'S NO HUNGER SYSTEM. So if you're playing on Hard difficulty. You'ill want to save as many health potion as possible for later. So after every encounters. You should be ready to do the tedious task of regenerating HPs. By walking in a circle around the room. Also, enemies that doesn't appears within your view range just doesn't move at all. So you'ill never be taken by suprise by doing this tedious task. By the way, The Mage character only restore MP while walking around, not both. Enjoy the tedious task of spinning right 'round the rooms for MP instead of HP. 

[b]Now I want you to picture this: You open a door, a boss appears a few square away. You use any skills available to prepare for the encounter such as Defense Skill and the Warrior's Shout Skill that can stun an enemy for a long time. You manage to stun the boss, you go in for the kill, inexplicably miss thrice. Then the boss acts, he gets a critical hit. You took half you HP bar on that one crit. You get out of the boss room into the other square shaped room you came from, then walk in a circular motion around the room as the boss tails you the entire time without any way of actually hitting you, since nothing will ever come and block your path. You keep turning around the room for a solid 2 minute to replenish all your HP. Then go in for a hit, you hit the boss a few times and so does he, your HP are at critical. Which only means... More of the silly cat and mouse chase around the room until your HP bar is full again[/b]

-Quest of Dungeon encourages grinding, as much as possible to progress. The anwers to everything is just to have a stronger character instead of having more knowledge then a less experienced player. The only thing to learn are the way to cheese the skills you learn trough randomly dropped books. Basically. All the Warrior's skills has a cooldown after use. (He doesn't have MP to worry about) Let's say your Bleeding Hit skill failed on the boss, You now have a 50+ turn cooldown before you can use it again. You know what that means? You're gonna be running around in circle around the room some more until the skill is available again! Superb! 10/10 gameplay right here. Also on a lesser note, trough the dungeons are stones that activates quest. But there's only 2 variety of quest. Quest A: Kill that boss. Quest B: Find an item that just randomly spawned around the dungeon. Both serves the only purpose of making you revisit the entire floor again with a vague hint of (The item or boss is situated north). You HAVE to do these quest if you want to survive on Normal or above. Pretty lackluster for a game called Quest of Dungeons.

Now on to the smaller stuff...

-Unlimited skill slot, at no point you will have to make a choice of having a healing spell above stun effect spell. The only anwers is just to read all the spell book you can find until all further books you find becomes (Book of Nothing) which you can sell to the merchant for a quick buck.

-Pointless traps that are always in plain sight. In other Roguelike, traps would be invisible to the player until they stepped on it, or had a method of finding them. Here, you will want to step on the spawn monster trap. So you can grind more XP.
Also the game features props like a shelves, pots, boxes and other thing that can be destroyed or search for gold or items. And sometime breaking a pot will inexplicabably trigger a trap that makes enemies spawns from the ceiling. (I guess these skeletons were really pissed I just broke their favorite pot?) One last thing about special tiles. There are invisible stash that can be walked on that yeild more gold, but those are stumbled only trough pure luck, or walking on every tiles of a dungeon. But you'd have to be crazy to do that.

-Equipement makes no friggin' sence. Very rarely weapons has additional attributes like (More gold) or (2+ Crits). There's a multitude of weapon sprite, however, that sweet crystal shield you just found could be beaten by that random wood buckler you had laying around in your inventory stats wise. Don't get me started on the equipement name etheir. In the same playtrough, I've got two exact looking pair of boots. One was named (The Boots) with 12 point of DEF, the other pair was named: (Damaged Boots) with 16 points of DEF. 

This is explained by the fact that all piece of equipment you find seems to have random generated names, it slaps random adjective to the item, so you'ill get things like (Dark Sigil Sword Seeker). Way to confuse new players to think there's actually depth to be found here.


-Enemies with ranged capacities are the bane of your existence. And if it's a boss with spells or a bow. Run, and pray that you don't get immolated by that fireball or get a random crit from that arrow. You can ultimately trick them to follow you around the room like other melee bosses, but first you got to walk up to them, and by then you're already on the brink of death.

-Item menu, as far as I know, cannot be used with arrow keys or keyboard imput, you have to use your mouse. Same goes for choosing a skill. It would have been nice to be able set the skills to the F1-F6 keys instead of clicking the spell book every time you want to switch.

-Along gold, you'ill find gems along the way, there's at least 8 or so sort of gems that are worth maybe 15 to then 20 GP each. Each kind of gem stack with each other, but if you find 6 sort of gems in a row and you're short on inventory space, you'd rather just leave that gem there and avoid the clutter, because ultimately, finding just one random piece of equipement will make those gems feel like chum changes when you realise that even the worst shield can be worth 1000+ GP. 

-Enemies sometime spout some random lines like: (The cake is a lie) or (You should have taken the blue pill) or even worst (I am your father). Too bad that the humor stops the moment you step in the dungeon. Because the trailer and intro was really funny in comparaison.

-Your sprite will never change to reflect the equipement you've equipped and that's really unfortunate and lazy. 

- Last and more important. It's a roguelike where you have to grind and it's never fun to die.


Ultimately, I can't recommend this game to veteran or neophytes alike. At best this game is a good distraction while watching something on the side or eating...

Firstly, you have to choose between four different classes (Warrior, Wizard, Assassin, Shaman) and four difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard, Hell).

Then the game starts, and you have to go through 7 floors killing monsters in order to get xp, money and items.

You will encounter bosses that are quite challenging to kill. Do not hesitate to escape, by closing the door that you opened a few seconds ago for instance, if you think that you will have a hard time killing a scary boss !

You will trigger quests (between 0-3 at each floor) that require to either kill a boss or find an item. You'll be rewarded with both money and xp. I think that you should clean an entire floor before triggering a quest (at least in Hard /Hell difficulties). The point I want to make is that if this is a boss quest, you might be in trouble if you have to fight a boss that you've just spawned plus some regular monsters.

Cleaning an entire floor will bring you everything you need : xp, money and items. You should get the best stuff you can and some potions before fighting the final boss. Regarding this final boss, I do not want to spoil people, but there is one thing I want to say : how is it possible to give him the ability to kill us with one skill and one shot ? If the skill ""Death"" hits you, you will die 10 turns later, no matter what you do ... You have to hope that it will fail :s

About The Game: Quest of Dungeons is a turn-based, rouge-like, RPG. The object of the game is simple, DON'T DIE!. Navigate the dungeons killing monsters, gaining exp, and collecting loot. You can switch out your equipment but leveling up just gives strait stat boosts. Skills come in the form of tomes you find. Some skills work better for some classes than others. The dungeons are randomly generated and can have multiple stairways. Some of the doors take keys to open them and there is no garantee that you will find that key on that floor. Backtracking to open a door on a previous floor might not be worth it since loot matches the floor you are on and not your level.

Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)
Graphics: 2.5 Nothing special here. 8 bit characters and monsters. The map shows what keys you need to get through the locked door but sometimes they are hard to see.
Playability: 3 With WSDA movement and some changeable hotkeys you are never confused on what to do.
Fun: 2 Perhaps it is because I chose the archer for my first run, but after the challenge of the first boss I didn't have much problems. I only died because I gave up caring. The game also trolls you right at the start with a sign showing a skull. I clicked on it looking for lore, instead found instant death.
Sound: 3.5 Even though the game is in old school graphics they actually tried with the background music. Different tunes play when you enter certain rooms and floors.
Replay Value: 3 There are 4 classes to play so there is some replay by challenging yourself on how far you can get with each class. Plus randomised maps and loot make each attempt a little different.
Final Score: 2.75 
Final Thought: At $4.99 definitely wait for a sale. I believe I got this game for 49 cents.",1484710687,1484710687,True,5,0,0.560498893260955811,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In this game, you choose a character, you choose dungeon, and you progress between floors by killing enemies, looting stuff, finding keys, opening chests, killing bosses and finding stairs. (Be sure to read this list well. It's all you'll do in this game.)
There are two dungeons in total plus a custom dungeon mode. No story at all, almost no text or cutscenes.
Each floor works exactly like the last. Only the colors and the enemies change slightly.
Also, all enemies are basically the same. Some have a ranged attack or a special ability, but most of the time it doesn't change anything.
Bosses really are stronger than other monsters but they're still not interesting at all.
There are five playable characters in total.
They can gain new abilities during the course of the game. One 2 hours game where I explored everything was more than enough for me to unlock ALL my character's abilities.
Also, most of these abilities are pretty useless. Your first ability will always be the main one. Most abilities aren't even subtle or interesting; it's mainly just ""deals more damage in a larger zone but costs more mana and has a longer cooldown"". There's almost no strategy at all in this game.

Some games have a bad repetitive gameplay but are still fun. That's because in these games you can unlock things, which is a nice perspective for players who like to collect things or access to new ways to play. Others have a nice story or atmosphere and make you dream. But this game doesn't have any of that. It is both boring and pointless, and its gameplay is almost inexistant.
Your first game will be nice. But as as soon as you finish it and read the achievements, you'll understand that you have nothing more to do here.

Gameplay is turn based, very laconic and, therefore, easy to get used to, but I think that this game still has enough diversity to keep you entertained. You have four characters (actually five, but the last one is unlocked after you've beaten the game for the first time), and due to unique skills each one of them has from the start and can learn later from the books, they are all different and playable in their own way. The dungeon you are to go through has seven floors with randomly located bosses, and, of course, the final boss in the end, but it is your choice - to thoroughly explore each floor or rush through them as fast as you can. There are also locked doors and locked chests that will require one of five types of key (or even two keys at once!), but some things are designed to make your life easier - like the hidden stashes you can find by just walking through a room, or fountains that can be used once and restore your life or mana. Another classic element - merchants, who can buy treasures you find and sell you potions, keys and armor/weapons. 

Of course, there are minuses. One of them is the quest system - there are only two types of quest, ""find something"" or ""kill the champion version of the regular mob"", and doing them is nothing but boring. Another minus is that, for me, the game was pretty easy, even on Hell difficulty. 

Still, overall I found it an enjoyable little piece, and for its price I would recommend it to anyone, even to those who are not familiar with roguelite games.

J’ai bien aimé mon expérience avec ce jeu et le recommande à tous les amateurs de jeux de rôles.

POINTS POSITIFS : 
- Ne se prend pas au sérieux, humour subtil et amusant
- Mises à jour constantes pour rendre le jeu meilleur
- Un excellent hommage aux jeux du genre Gauntlet
- Interface de jeu simple à comprendre et à utiliser
- Variété des styles de jeu bien équilibrée
- Offre un bon défi aux vétérans avec le mode enfer
- Style rétro bien réussi

POINTS NÉGATIFS :
- Aucun tutoriel pour enseigner les bases du jeu
- Les premières parties sont impardonnables, courbe de difficulté abrupte
- La progression des personnages en pouvoirs dépend des trésors
- Manque de fluidité dans les animations
- Contrôles peu intuitifs sur ordinateur
- Musique répétitive

To be clear, there is only one dungeon and multiple quests, a more accurate title would be 'Dungeon of Quests'.  That aside this little rogue style dungeon crawler gives you the option of player one of four characters to delve deep into a hostile environment filled with monsters but also loot!

The art holds the theme well but the lack of animations is a weakness for the overall product.  Monsters are varied and the simple quests drive you to explore each floor thoroughly.  Character advancement lacks depth with skills being acquired by loot drops instead of a leveling path.

Indie developer?
Full Controller Support?
Rougue-lite RPG?

This game has that, and more.

Pros:
+Soundtrack, though small, isn't terrible.
+4 classes available, each with an identity
+challenging, rougue-lite gameplay at every level
+Active modding community?

Cons:
-Soundrtack is small.
-The game's enemies are your standard RPG stock, without innovation. (spiders, bats skeletons, etc.)
-No progression system, meaning every death results in a complete restart, with no rewards for progressing.
-No mods as of yet for other recent pixel art games such as shovel knight and towerfall ascention.
- No multiplayer, local or online.

Quest of Dungeons adds a few elements to the formula, some good and some bad, but doesn't really aspire to improve it so the few flaws that Fatal Labyrinth had are still here in Quest of Dungeons. 

This game adds more loot and a store to sell and buy items. But most of the loot is just junk to sell anyway, and there is nothing worth buying except healing potions. Quest of Dungeons also tries to add personality to the player character and the monsters, but fails completely. The character says random things like ""This game was made with C++"" and ""This game was made with OpenGL"". The monsters say equally weird things, according to another reviewer they are mostly references to movies that have nothing to do with the context of this game.

Like in Fatal Labyrinth, the only way to heal between battles is to run around a bit. In this game the healing is a lot slower so the running around just to heal yourself gets even more tedious after a while.

I quit playing soon after I got to the 4th floor of the dungeon. There you encounter monsters who steal stuff from your inventory. This is another ""feature"" that was present in Fatal Labyrinth as well. But again, Quest of Dungeons makes an annoying feature worse. In Fatal Labyrinth the monster sometimes stole an item from you, in this game they almost always succesfully steal from you, so you see the few good items you didn't sell before going to the 4th floor disappear from your inventory at an extremely frustrating rate. And you can't get stolen items back from the monster after killing it. Within a few minutes I lost the three keys I had in my inventory (the most important items in Quest of Dungeons and not easy to find) and the better part of my gold. This is such a cheap mechanism to make a game more difficult (and Quest of Dungeons has a few of those) that it made me decide to quit playing.

Conclusion: the premise of the game is good but we saw that 25 years ago already in Fatal Labyrinth. And Fatal Labyrinth is still the better of the two games: it's longer, more balanced, less frustrating and annoying, it doesn't have the weird and even childish atmosphere and it has a ""continue"" system (if you play it via the emulator that comes with the Sega Megadrive Classics / Sega Genesis Classics collections, you can even save at any point).

Most of my play time with Quest Of Dungeuns has been via the Humble Store (DRM-free + Steam key + Android apk file) version. I've also played it ALOT on my Android phone. My Steam stats don't even scratch the surface of my experience with it.

PROS:
+ Fun.
+ Randomized dungeuns keep the experience fresh.
+ 4 playable character classes, with a rumored 'unlockable' fifth.
+ Very modest hardware requirements; netbook friendly.
+ Windows, Mac, and Linux versions all included.
+ Easy 'mouse click' controls, with gamepad support being added.
+ Humble Store version is DRM-free and includes a DRM-free Android 'apk' file for Android phones and tablets.
+ Android version uses a very simple touch-screen interface.
+ Steam version includes Achievements and cloud saves.

Permadeath.  Get used it.
Premise: Return the ""light"" stolen by a Dark Lord.
Deceptively simple, easy, roguelike, single player, quest adventure.  Can be done in 30 minutes or less if you are good and lucky.
Did I mention Permadeath?
What makes this game a challenge beyond the randomly generated dungeons is Permadeath.  Each and every time you die the dungeon respawns and the player must begin again from the very beginning as a new character.  No in-game save points.  No tutorial.  Learn as one goes, and player arrogance and over confidence is the biggest enemy.
7 levels to traverse through with random encounters, traps, loot, side quests, and mini-bosses that will kick your butt. 
4 difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, Hard and Hell.  For Hard and Hell all those OMG 'these are stupid tricks' come in handy when the monsters are OP and there is no shop keeper to buy health or mana from.
Four character classes: warrior, wizard, shaman, and assassin each with their own unique play style and power ups (which one may or may not get during game play).

Instead consider playing Tales of Maj'Eyal or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. 

Quest of Dungeons is not a roguelike, it is a roguelikelike. It is a dumb, poorly made abomination that merely contains elements that an ignorant may ask and be told, probably from a bored and indifferent source, can be found within roguelikes.

This insipid program is a mannequin of a roguelike. There is next to no variety in abilities or items. Most gear is a flat upgrade, additional stats are rare and usually as significant as +1% crit chance. It has draped itself in the trappings of a roguelike but nothing more.

It lacks many basic features such as auto-exploration, travel to landmark, or rest till fully healed. And may the Good Lord in Heaven have mercy or your wretched soul if you should even attempt to make use of the click to move feature.

Clicking on a square causes you to move to that square, even distant squares that take many turns to walk to. In those subsequent turns you get to watch your character get mobbed to death without you being able to stop it. Yes, this game lacks the basic feature of stopping auto-walk when an enemy appears or you take damage. The first time I had a character die to this I had to immediately kill off a few more just to convince myself that yes, this game is just that badly made. Had the developers placed into this game any sort of love, care, attention, or to be frank, competence, then they would have caught this.

No love was put into this game, and I presume only minimal effort. Where are the random and unindentified potions, scrolls, and wands? Where are the whacky item egos and curses? Where is the innovation? Where is the fun? Where are the things that people who love games hold so dear that they want to dedicated a significant portion of their lives just for the chance that they can share them with the world? Where is this game's voice? Oh no, not That Friend's voice. But yes, it is, and we will discuss it.

Throughout the game monsters will say famous quotes from pop culture. “Welcome to your doom.” You might open a door and see a walking tree that announces “I am your father.” No reason, no joke, no connection to anything. “The cake is a lie.” These things are just said and said and said, repeated constantly through the game. “Run you fool.” It isn't funny.

Say you find yourself, despite all good efforts, alone in a room with That Friend. You know of whom I speak, we all know That Friend.

“Do you remember Portal?” he asks, then guffaws. Using his thumb he counts down the greasy fat fingers on his other hand. Star Trek, Terminator, Lord of the Rings, Scooby-Doo. Each punctuated with a false high pitched screech that his dim mind approximates to laughter before moving down the queue to the next reference. No jokes, no punchlines, just references to the existence of pop culture icons. And then braying.

Grabbing you by the shoulders, That Friend pulls his oily face within millimeters of yours, dilated eyes blood shot and half mad, spit foaming in the corners of his filthy unwashed mouth, he screams his putrid breath into your nostrils: “Do you remember Star Wars?!” And then the noise, which you will never forget, not laughter, but a robotic repetitive pronunciation of a syllable without variation, screamed at the top of his lungs, into your face, into your rattling suicide-contemplating bones. “HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!”

These syllables are devoid of humor and the halls that they echo through are indelibly darkened, even memories of mirth and joy past are erased.

It was made by bad people.

The weapon/armor system is pretty stupid too.  You constantly receive ""cracked"" and ""broken"" items.  I don't actually recall seeing an adjective that implies the item is in good condition.  There's no correlation to how 'cool' the item looks and how much it helps you.  You might be wearing a blood sword one minute and find a wooden stick that's +25 damage the next.  It makes no sense at all.

The differences between easy and hell modes are pretty much nonexistent.  As others have said,  you  can just outrun your enemies until you heal/gain mana/ etc.  You can also lure  enemies on  to traps, so if you're out of mana and don't want to risk being attacked, you can just lure them onto traps over and over and over again until they die.",1433579546,1433579546,False,1,0,0.491266340017318726,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

QoD offers about 30-60 minutes per game. It plays fast and intuitively and has catchy tunes and sound effects.

Goal of the game is to get to the lowest floor (6 or 7), where you can defeat the end-boss and thus winning the game. 

You gain experience by killing monsters and completing quests as you progress through the floors. Mana and hitpoints (depending on difficulty level) can be regained by either ""wandering around"" (avoiding the word ""exploring"" in this context, because it's effectively possible to replenish mana and health simply by running around in already explored areas), or consuming potions or food. When having explored all of a dungeon floor, your level and equipment will be good enough to proceed to a lower floor with more difficult monsters and boss(es). 

Magic books can be found in chests and monster-drops, which you can read to learn a new spell. Each spell has a short explanation and is easy to memorize. Every spell has a cooldown period and mana cost. 

Gold is collected from monster-drops, destroying breakable objects, chests and or selling items at the shopkeeper. Equipment (weapons and armor) can be looted from monsters and bosses, found in chests or bought at the shopkeeper. 

Quests can be initiated by activating ""quest poles"", scattered around the floors. Basically, there are two kind of straightforward quests: ""search quests""; which require you to locate and collect an object or ""kill <name of boss> quests""; in which you'll have to find the boss' hideout and defeat him. While the overall approach of the game feels rather easy, the bosses can be tricky though... make sure you come well prepared. It's mostly the spell arsenal you possess at the moment that makes the difference between victory or defeat, this especially counts for the battle with the final boss.


[h1]Summary[/h1]

Fun, fast, easy to learn, easy to master; therefore making QoD an excellent beginner-roguelike, no more-no less. For experienced roguelike-players, this game is simply too basic and too easy to be taken seriously into account. Even the hardest difficulty (Hell) it is fairly easy to beat.  When having achieved a perfect game (100% achievements in 18 hours), you've about had it with the game. For me at least, i can see no further challenge and/or the need to play QoD again (soon), therefore offering little, to none, replay value.

The weapon and armor system, class and combat systems are all a joke. Just the most generic randomly generated garbage being offered to you. Whether you're a knight or a mage, the combat is still the most generic and lackluster thing ever. Like, it's really hard to find a dungeon crawler that has exceptionally boring combat as that's the case with pretty much all dungeon crawlers, but this game just feels the worst out of anything I've ever played.

The end result is a game where you walk around in circles and fight random monsters. Sometimes you find stairs to go a new room to walk around in circles in. There's no incentive to do anything. You don't really change except getting slightly higher stat numbers and occasionally new abilities that don't really amount to much. The fact that this is being sold for $5 is an insult.

Basically this is a rouguelike game which you play as one of the four characters and complete a dungeon with multiple floors. Sounds easy right? No. For some reason the ""easy"" difficulty is harder than most games i find difficult to play. You get two-shotted by bosses on Normal mode and the only good character is the ranged one because they can't directly attack you from afar unless they are mages or archers themselves. You spend two hours on a regular run and you probably won't finish the game in this time because you die by the bosses since a crit does like 60% of your HP for some reason- and in higher difficulties a crit would end your run.

Do i reccomend this game? Yes, it's so much fun. But only if you don't mind having to start over again. Basic combat that everyone can understand sounds horrible, but it's actually not that bad as it looks on paper and fits the game very well. The graphics are very nice for a pixely game and the music really gives a nice ambience, even while it sounds so... stupid?

Trust me, you will spend an hour, die, probably not play the game again for a couple of hours or even a day and do another attempt on it the next day. You will try your *ss off so hard that you will ragequit over and over again, but you still want to see that booty when you finish the game. You will get really pissed when you open a door and a boss shoots at you or uses magic at you and crits you, making you lose the game. But you will come back. And you will pick the archer 90% of the time since you hate the other guys being f*cking more hardcore than hardcore hardcore. You will deny your gf for sex because you you are so far playing this game and you haven't died yet...

It's pretty cheap. It's a pretty small download, and launches very quickly, and uses mimimal CPU and pretty low RAM. And it works on Linux and Mac as well as Windows.

On the minus side, everything else. I can't imagine why anyone would recommend this game unless they'd never played another roguelike—and if you've never played a roguelike, there are much better ones to start with, including free ones, so don't buy this one and inflict it on other people. This is basically a roguelike, minus all the things that make roguelikes fun. I'm not expecting every game to be Nethack or Zangband, but it should at least have as much depth as the original Rogue, or why waste your time?

There are effectively two kinds of monsters: the ones you can kill without blinking, and the ones you can't possibly beat head-to-head, but can kill 100% of the time if you circle around an obstacle (or make a bigger circle with teleporters or stairs) healing after each blow. And, since there are no status effects and no actions besides attack and 9 skills/class that you will mostly not use, that's pretty much all there is to the tactics.

As for larger strategy--well, there is none. Min/maxing your character is as impossible as it is pointless—yes, there are a ton of stats, but you can't even _see_ them, much less influence them, whatever they do is opaque and largely undiscoverable, and they don't even seem to affect the game much anyway. Exploration is straightforward, because there are no real choices—there's always exactly one path between any pair of rooms, no cycles anywhere; there are no wide vs. narrow corridors, or different kinds of entrances to deal with; the only real difference between any room and any other room that matters is whether they have something to circle around or not. I suppose there are keys, and sometimes you won't have the key you need, but it's not like the key will be somewhere interesting on the level (which would at least make it as complex as Doom…); you just have to slog your way back through the previous levels hoping one of the shopkeepers will have randomly gotten the key you want, so that's just annoying, not challenging.

Beyond the basic control scheme, some things are incredibly tedious (like selling most of your inventory to a shopkeeper—mouse to the item, click, mouse to the Sell button, click, repeat 30 times). There are some keyboard shortcuts, but not for any of the parts where you'd want them.

Also, the graphics aren't really ""16-bit"", except for the title screen. Yes, the tiles are the same resolution as late-80s sprites. But they aren't particularly SNES-looking, or inspired in any way. And they're just static tiles; you don't get the cheesy step animation, multi-level parallax scrolling, different-sized sprites on the same screen, palette animation, or other effects that define the 16-bit look. What it _does_ look like is one of the early tilesets for the old roguelikes—and if you want that, you can play one of those games.

Also, while the game does a pretty good job keeping its resource use low, on a laptop with switchable GPUs (at least on Mac or Windows) it'll force you onto the discrete GPU and burn through battery power anyway. Not the developer's fault (I'm sure it runs just fine on a typical Intel integrated GPU, but both OS's are overzealous about switching…), but still a shame.",1428739567,1428739567,False,1,0,0.491266340017318726,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game play is one of the simplest you will ever see, You can play the whole game by just using your mouse or you have you the w,a,s,d keys to move if you so chose. The game throws you into the dungeon with no tutorial so you are going to find your self dying quickly but I think it this challenge of the game that make it so enjoyable unlike most games of today if you die you have to start again. there is a ""save"" but this is only so you can take a break if you die the save is deleted and you have to start again, This can be annoying but it also makes you want to play it again and again. 

You start the game by choosing one of four characters warrior, wizard, assassin and shaman then you are in the game. from this point onward your goal is to kill monsters to get money to buy better stuff to kill more monsters  and repeat. you do all this so you can get further down in the dungeon in a wild hope that you might really beat the game. alone the way you find shops to spend your money, random boss's and the odd chest if you're lucky. then from you lose track of your health and die. then you press new game and give it another go  and after a few 100 goes you might really win and then you will do it all over again with the other three characters. 

over all I think this game is one of the rare case's of getting more than you are paying for because than game is simple fun and something you can sit back on a lazy Saturday and play for hours not caring about the world and for £3.99 I don't think you're going to get much better.

Все это развивает интерес к игре, но стоит рассмотреть некоторые ньюансы, перед тем как покупать игру:
1)В игре происходит строгое распределение главного героя (ГГ) по боевым классам: воин, маг, шаман и стрелок. Для каждого класса присущи свое оружие и снаряжение. Стоит отметить, что предметы одного класса некогда не встретятся в игре за другой класс, ну просто б***ь перебейтесь (К примеру: Мы начинаем игру за воина, и ему никогда не выпадут предметы мага или лучника).Это немного огорчает :(
2)На каждом уровне встречаются определенные типы мобов или боссов 
3)Управление шаговое: тоесть при совершении шага ГГ с одной клетки на другую передвежение мобов осуществляется также на одну клетку. Когда же ГГ остается на клетке и не совершает движений, мобы также немогут совершать движение, что помогает воспользоваться предметами во время внутриигровой паузы :)
4) Нет мультиплеера.Тоже печально 
5)Перманентная смерть в игре!
6)После смерти ГГ доносится зловещий смех или крик нооооооууу!!! :)

首先是最基本的游戏性问题，这个游戏内所有角色和所有怪物移动速度完全一样，而且一切角色在出生时均没有任何控制技能，而新技能的获取也不是依靠升级，而是在游戏内随机获得在使用获得技能的魔法书，完全随机。
这使得大前期当你遇到打不过的BOSS时，你几乎没有任何办法摆脱那家伙，因为你们移动速度完全相同，你只能跟boss保持亲密的0距离一起一路狂奔，找到地图中随机生成的传送门，传送离开到同层别的位置回复，然后回来继续磨boss的血。
然而当你熟练的使用这一战术后，游戏内的所有BOSS又都变成了傻逼，因为传送门只有玩家能使用，怪是传不走的，而游戏内的生命值魔法值均可以通过回合的流逝自动回复，而boss不会，所以磨死一切boss不是梦，而这个战斗过程弱智无比又重复枯燥，你不会喜欢的。
而游戏进行了一小会之后，角色的数据会迅速膨胀，尤其是在钱的方面。游戏刚进入第三层，一瓶可以让我瞬间满血的药水只要450到900块钱，而我钱包里揣着5万块巨款，然而我惊讶的发现商店里出售的装备全都是比我身上差不少的垃圾装备，也就是说我的5W巨款除了买药水也不用干别的，而这个药水在你买干净以后还会刷新你怕不怕？喝药水没CD只消耗一回合你怕不怕？与钱包迅速爆炸相伴随的是，我的角色学会了一大堆一大堆一大堆技能，有用的没用的都不少，游戏难度随之骤降
前期过于困难，中期过后难度直线暴跌直接变割草无双的难度曲线肯定是有问题的
=========================================
总之，这款游戏作为一个传统模式的RL系统过于简单，游戏深度过浅而且数值强度和难度曲线的设计明显存在问题。但是物品、技能等游戏内容还算比较丰富，作为一个廉价的拿来休闲打发时间还是可以的。然而作为一个“RL游戏”该作品并不合格。

""The Orc and the Pie"" is a joke about how, when you get down to it, the lazy standard of RPGs is to just say there's some monster that wants to kill you, and if you kill it, you get some random loot thing, and then get offered a chance to go kill another orc to get more pies.  Whoever made this game didn't get that it was supposed to be a joke.

Play as one of four pre-defined stereotypes with no real character customization in a series of square rooms where you can either spam the ranged attack button (if a ranged attacker) or just ram directly into enemies until they all die.  

Then, once the orcs are dead, you get to run over anything in the room while spamming the ""pick up"" button, and occasionally run all the way back to a shopkeeper to empty out your pockets so you can carry more random crap.  

This game's version of pies are largely uninspired.  You have potions, ""food"" that are potions in disguise, armor and weapons that just straight give +damage or -damage with very few exceptions, and you'll largely be fighting enemies on floor 5 the exact same way as you did on floor 1.  In fact, you'll probably be fighting the SAME ENEMIES, too, since this game palette swaps all the enemies.  

Thanks to a lack of enough mana potions, if you play the mage, you'll be treated to a basic attack spell that takes 5 MP, enemies that take several bolts to kill, and needing to waste a dozen turns to get 2 MP back.  Enjoy the tactical depth of running in circles or smashing the wait turn button for hours to get your MP back after clearing a cramped room.  Since there's no hunger mechanics, you can waste infinite time, and are directly rewarded for doing so, with only the toll upon your own patience as a disincentive.  

Bosses may be tougher than you, but thanks to the I-take-a-turn-you-take-a-turn nature of the game, you can simply walk away from bosses to prolong combat as long as necessary for your passive regen to put you back up to full health while the bosses have no regeneration.  As a bonus, ""poison"" type effects keep working, so getting a single lucky fireball to start tapping away 3% health per turn and then kiting the boss across the whole dungeon is easy-peasy boss cheesing. 

Beyond that, everything in this game is either scenery or a target for vandalism.  It tries to add ""humor"" by having random quotes put out there like Dungeons of Dredmor did, but honestly, that just reminds me of how Dungeons of Dredmor is a much, much better game than this.  The ""jokes"" are even mostly recycled, and I can't even be bothered to stop to read them, after a while, much like I can't be bothered to stop to pick up the bajillion coins that fall out of the hundredth palette swapped rat I just barbecued with my thousandth fireball.  

Procedural content is only as interesting as the effort put into making each area actually feel different.  This game is just the same room copy-pasted every single time.  Kick in door, kill orc, take pie.  Kick in next door, kill orc, take pie.  Rinse and repeat until your eyes bleed.  Few games manage to be as offensively boring as this...

In summary, don't play this game, it's a lazy knockoff Dungeons of Dredmor wannabe.  Play the real Dungeons of Dredmor.",1426556650,1493409844,False,143,11,0.752787411212921143,10,False,False,False,False,,,

But if you're at all familiar with roguelikes, just don't bother. 

This game lacks any real depth or strategy. Enemy behavior patterns are drop-dead simple and can be trivially abused (if even boss-monsters don't know how to chase you around a one-square obstruction without making mistakes and going the wrong way sometimes, expectations have to be set pretty low). Monsters don't have different speeds, or different pursuit-patterns, or even different immunities (even skeletons and slimes and golems and vampires and, yes, boss-monsters can be made to sleep with 100% success); they DO occasionally have different ranges and special-attacks, but that's it. It doesn't feel like an effort was made to have the treasure progression make sense; a few floors into the dungeon, you can sell inferior gear for thousands of gold, but the increasingly high-quality gemstones you find are still hovering between 10 and 20 apiece, which means the only reason you would pick them up is to make sure there's not another item hidden beneath them. Selection of gear could have been interesting, but this is another missed opportunity; few pieces of gear provide any stats other than the primary stat always provided by the gear-slot, meaning that choosing the best gear means just picking the highest number rather than making meaningful strategic tradeoffs. Any difficulty comes purely from the fact that some boss-monsters or special attacks can remove half of your health or more, but that's okay because if you know anything about tactics in roguelikes you don't have to let them attack you at all, if you play a ranged character and have patience.

Graphically, the game delivers on everything its trailers promise. There's good variety in learnable skills, incorporating status effects and areas of effect in ways that would force you to make meaningful strategic decisions, if not for the homogeneity and simplicity of the threats you face. The music is varied and enjoyable enough and fits well with the game's themes. Overall, the game's production values feel decent for its price-- except for the deep, gaping hole where game-design and strategic challenge should be. 

Long story short, if you're a halfway-experienced roguelike player, you can jump into this game on its hardest difficulty, win on your first or second run, and have no reason to go back, as was my experience.

You are able to learn books, If you have found a book that you have learned already. And you are gonna use it.. The book will be removed from the inventory even if they told you ""you learned this already"". Every action or move that you will do, Performs and completes a turn.


Character is able to level up.
No walking character animation. It just slides over.
Okay music.
Trying to be funny with some texts like in ""Dungeon of dredmor"".

Если Вам надоела жесткая конкуренция в играх, [b]QoD[/b] подарит достаточно положительных эмоций. 

Тем не менее, стоит быть крайне аккуратным при встрече с боссами. Не стесняйтесь запасать бутылочки для Маны и Здоровья. Вполне неплохим маневром будет отступление, если босс зацепил критическим ударом. Смыться от преследующего босса можно через телепортер или лестницу на другой этаж. Накопите сил и вернитесь к обидчику.

Если Вы играете в первый раз, я бы [i]не рекомендовал[/i] Воина. Лучше возьмите Шамана ! Геймплей за него выглядит более разнообразно. Ну и конечно есть несколько советов для новичков, без которых не обойтись ! )

[b]1.[/b] На первых этажах, всегда покупайте у торговцев [u]ключи[/u], которых у Вас нет в коллекции ! Стоят они не много, а пригодиться могут в любой момент. Запоминайте комнаты, вход в которые возможен только с ключом. (Если у Вас нет нужного ключа) Когда нужный ключ появится, не поленитесь вернуться к такой комнате !

[b]2.[/b] Не слишком заморачивайтесь на квестах ! Иногда дают [u]квест[/u] найти ""Сломанный колокольчик"" или что-нибудь в этом роде ... Мы все таки играем тут как крутые ""адвентюреры"" а не как старьевщики ! Денег и экспы за такие квесты дают - мало. А потому обыскивать весь этаж сможет разве что - педант. Другое дело квесты на боссов. Их выполнять обязательно нужно. Ведь кроме нас никто не очистит подземелья от нечисти.

[b]3.[/b] Не экономьте [u]ману[/u] перед повышением уровня ! В верхней части экрана ползет оранжевая полоска экспириенса. Как только она доберется до края экрана, персонаж получит новый уровень. При получении уровня, - полностью восполняется здоровье и мана ! Поэтому перед повышением уровня, смело кастуйте самые дорогие заклинания.

[b]4.[/b] Аптечка* всегда должна быть под рукой ! Еще раз напоминаю что [u]бутылочки[/u] для восстановления здоровья и маны играют ключевую роль. Встреча с боссом редко проходит без использования этих чудодейственных эликсиров. Пусть Вас не смущают боссы на первых уровнях, которых легко вальнуть. 

[b]5.[/b] Игра может показаться Вам слишком жестокой ! И не удивительно, так как действует эффект ""[u]пермадеат[/u]"". Проще говоря, если Вас убивают, считаться Вы не сможете. Поэтому убаюкивающая простота прохождения, - самый опасный враг ! Нужно все время быть в тонусе. Все время иметь лучшее оружие из имеющегося, лучшие бутылочки из имеющихся, лучшие шмотки и набор ключей. Так например для меня, 3-ий час игры постоянно складывался сложно. Думаю именно тогда действие ""убаюкивающей простоты"" особенно коварно.

[b]6.[/b] [u]Денег[/u] всегда навалом ! Поэтому смело закупайтесь у торговцев самым лучшим товаром. Что Вам следует знать о деньгах, так это то, что есть ачивка ""накопи миллион !""

Пожалуй это все советы для новичков, которые пришли в голову. Теперь вопросы к старичкам. То есть к тем кто в игре разобрался как следует. ) 
А. [i]Как находить скрытые сокровища ? [/i]
[spoiler]Не уловил честно говоря как их находить ?! Просто время от времени выпадают сокровища откуда не возьмись ... Может кто-нибудь прольет свет ?[/spoiler]

Б. [i]Что есть чтобы увеличить Сопротивление магии ?[/i]
[spoiler]Обратил внимание что фаерболы совсем не бьют персонажа, хотя в предыдущей партии отнимали приличное количество здоровья. Из-за чего это произошло определить не смог ) [/spoiler]

В. [i]Не все то золото что блестит ?[/i]
[spoiler]Вопрос который у меня напрашивается, а получает ли персонаж бонусы от [i]комплектов одежды[/i] ? Если я одену его полностью в красное/зеленое/черное да еще в руки дам подходящее по цвету оружие ?! Не будет ли это круче самых крутых доспехов ?[/spoiler]

I am going to go ahead and give my review because I don't really want to spend more time on the game unless it is fixed. Maybe with the beta that is out, but I could care less.  The game looks great and it has great appeal. The classes are fun to play, and the skill books throughout  the game give the characters a good edge. The main disappointment about this game is that the bosses are extremely overpowered, and do a good double the damage that you do to them. You also have minimal health compared to them. But they are also easy to kill because all you have to do is run around the sides of the room with them following you, so that you can heal. Pointless. A good solution to this would be that the only way you can heal would be a wait button, you hold it to heal and you stand there while stuff happens around you. 
Another bad thing about this game is that NOTHING happens around you. You leave the room, everything stands there with their thumbs up their butts. Come on, make them do something. 
While playing my first character I looked at the sign with the skull on it, and it killed me instantly. Pointless?
I played a second character and walked around for a good while, beat the first floor with the boss run-away technique. Tried to go to the second floor and the game crased, erased my data. Just my cup of tea
Made a third character, a warrior. The game gets pretty simple when you get the roar attack that makes enemies scared, because you beat on them all you want. I got to floor four I think, and then stepped into the stairs on accident, game crased and erased my data. Dandy.
Edit: I have mad numerous more characters, almost all of them have died the same way, wizards freezing me continuously. This is absolutely ridiculous and there is almost no way to counter it.
Needless to say, this game requires A LOT of work.
1.) Fix the healing run, or make bosses easier.
2.) Fix the crashing.
3.) Make inventory stuff stack, it's annoying having 8 chicken legs in your inventory.
4.) Stop the intro crap. I don't want to look at that every time I start a game.
5.) Fix the spam freeze. 
6.) Make characters change with different gear. Maybe even make it more complex, instead of seeing the same art for two different swords.
7.) Some sort of auto-save, cause the crashes cause erasing of data

　操作、戦闘などすべてにおいて極めてシンプル。そこが最大の利点でもあり問題点でもあります。
　ユーザーに示される数値はHP、MP、攻撃力、魔法攻撃力、防御力程度。極めてわかりやすい物になっています。
　しかし、装備品に書かれている数字がそのままこれらの値に適用されるわけではありません。見えない各種数字と掛け合わされた上で最終的な値として出てくるようなのです。例えば、+5の装備から+10の変えたとしましょう。この場合、今までの装備より+5されるように思えますが違います。+1～+2程度の上昇しかしません。このあたりの直感的ではないものがストレスになります。

　隠されたステータスの謎
　画面上で示されないのは見える数値に直接関わる物ばかりではなく、間接的にものが多数あるようです。レジストや命中率などなど。これら存在のヒントはステータスアップが付いた装備品の表記のみ。それら数値がプラスされたとしても、元がどれだけあるのか分からないため、（数字的には）強力な装備を拾った嬉しさなどが全くありません。結局攻撃力や防御力と言った具体的に見える数字だよりの装備になってしまいます。

　ゲームとしての難易度
　ほどほどの難しさ。雑に遊ばず、それなりの慎重さで挑めば打開は目の前だと思います。
　満腹度（空腹度）が無いために、足踏み回復し放題です。手間さえ惜しまなければ雑魚戦で死ぬことはないでしょう。
　1プレイの時間はおよそ1時間～1時間半。ちょっとした時間に遊ぶにはちょうど良い長さですね。
　言語は英語のみですが、読まなくても困ることはありません。kill,sell,buyなど最低限の単語背読めれば遊べます。

　まとめ
　偶然のクエストボス戦のの理不尽死を除けばサクサク遊べて悪くありません。上に書いた隠された数字のもやもやを無視できるならばお勧め。スマホゲームと割り切って遊び捨てる分にも悪くありません。とても「おもしろい」ゲームや、やり込みを求めるならば他のゲームを選んだ方が良いでしょう。


攻略メモ
　次の階層へ行く目安は雑魚敵を一撃で倒せる強さ。
　常にライフは満タンに。
　回復ポーションは全買い。装備品は拾い物で十分。
　万全の状態では無い時にクエストボスに出会ったら扉を閉める。
　各種ボス戦は　防御（回避）アップ→足止め→スキル攻撃が楽。ポーションはケチらず消費。

分かりにくい部分
　スキルは選択後に対象を選ぶ。自分にたいして使うスキルであろうとも自分を選ぶ。グリーンの枠が出ればその対象に使える。レッドならば不可。",1420880659,1420880659,True,46,1,0.803078830242156982,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There is no character development - you will gain experience that will level you up, but you have no infuence on how it affect your hero. There are spells - a few for each character class - and some of them are overpowered, others aren't usable at all. The gameplay is too simple; what is fun in such games is finding best strategies, finding weakness in different enemies, and constant threat, but there aren't any of them. All this makes this game too easy. What is more - design should be kept fully oldschool. Although i like style everything is made, the animation of dying monsters is terrible. Imagine this: everything is made of really, really BIG pixels, yet, when monster dies, there is animation of rotating and rescaling it, showing full potential and resolution of your display. It just doesn't suit there.

So, this is a roguelike you can finish. It is enjoyable for a while, but once you have finished the game with one character there is little incentive to keep playing other than to see the skills of the other ones (which, as said, can be done quickly).

I was mashing former bosses into pieces, and I one or two shot everything, and I was generally untouchable. Then I run into some weird mage, and it fucking one shots me!

I guess to sum up if you've got a couple bucks, and a couple hours to kill go for it. It's not bad, but the game doesn't seem to have a consistent diffaculty curve, and you can easily find an entire hour wasted because of some random one shot.

Quest of Dungeons is a 16 bit 2D rouge like adventure game. Where you are sent by your party to adventure randomly generated dungeons and defeat the bosses that lye ahead. The game was designed by David Amador and released back in March, 2014.

Review

Quest of Dungeons is not for the hardcore rouge like player but, the simplistic and average player that wants something to do for a couple mins because you have time to spare. The game has many features such as:

Randomly Generated Dungeons
Four playable classes
Comical humor
Many different items
Chance to fight your own ghost
Achievement system (Beta)
Unlock-able content
Large inventory system
Replay Value
The game lacks from a ""real"" rouge like dungeon crawler when it comes to survival. In Quest of Dungeons David got rid of the food system so you no longer need to eat to survive, larger inventory so you do not have to make those drastic choices of keeping an item or not.

Although, Quest of Dungeons may not have everything a rouge like game would. It is fun none the less and would recommend this game to anybody looking for a fun dungeon crawler with much replay value. For $4.99 the game is worth the time and enjoyment you will get out of it.",1419399023,1419399023,True,2,0,0.496453911066055298,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Mit anderen Worten: Rundenbasiert, RPG, Dungeoncrawler, Looten und Leveln und BOCKSCHWER. So gehört sich das für einen Vertreter der Zunft. Beim achten oder neunten Run auf easy habe ich das erste Mal das Spiel geschafft, und das auch nur mit dem Assasinen (Bogenschütze).
Insgesamt stehen im Spiel 4 Klassen zur Auswahl. Ein Krieger, ein Assasine, ein Magier und ein Schamane, wobei die beiden Magieklassen wirklich Bockschwer und sehr von ihren Skills abhängig sind. Übrigens beide Nahkämpfer und sehr, SEHR schnell tot. Der Krieger als klassischer Nahkämpfer ist nicht gar so schwer, der angenehmste Charakter ist der Assasine, der allein schon deswegen einen riesigen Vorteil hat, weil er auch ohne Skills auf Distanz angreifen kann. Damit ist er von allen Klassen die, die am einfachsten zu spielen ist.
Das Gameplay geht sehr flüssig von der Hand, mit der Maus steuert man den Charakter (geht alternativ auch mit den Pfeiltasten oder WSAD), öffnet die Menüs (geht auch mit Shortcuts), visiert Ziele an, also Gegner und Gegenstände, und wählt die Skills aus. Diese müssen im Übrigen jeden Run neu erlernt werden, das passiert in dem man sie aus Büchern lernt, die von Gegnern oder Kisten gedroppt werden.
Kein Oberhammer, aber durchaus erwähnenswert ist der Soundtrack, welcher atmospärisch durch die Ebenen loopt und einem die richtige Stimmung vermittelt (Highlight: Die Shopmusik!).

For example:

You recover HP by moving around. Okay, that's pretty standard. But every monster moves exactly as fast as you, and they do not recover HP. So you can beat every single monster in the game by running in circles while they fruitlessly chase after you, chipping away at their HP when it's safe. This is unbearably tedious, but it's the ""correct"" way to play, especially since the game has no qualms with guaranteed boss monsters that two-shot you on the first floor. 

Better games solve this problem (that, again, was established twenty years ago) through a variety of methods. Monsters that are faster than you, monsters that heal when you walk as well, wandering monsters that can show up and block your path, etc. Quest of Dungeons' developer has made a technically competent game, but he is a very poor designer.

Pro Tips for aspiring roguelike developers: read this, the design philosophy of the best roguelike out there. http://crawl.develz.org/other/manual.html#n-philosophy-pas-de-faq . I'm not saying every game has to be exactly like Crawl, but for the parts of yours that are different, you should be able to explain why you chose to make them that way.

Speaking of boss... Why so hard? You need to go farm the floor after just to get a few more levels before facing the boss of the prievious floor. Why?

Melee characters are weak as fuuu compared to mage and rogue. Even rogue gets super weak very fast. I managed to get floor 8 with the wizard and died of a boss which was right at the door and managed a single lucky crit. Also, I don't know for the others, I had nearly one million gold before I died, and I never had anythingt good in shop beside once or twice I got a doom key (which are kinda rare) Otherwise, I always got mana potions because the mana regen ridiculously slow.

Monsters in general are relatively easy to beat other than some floors where the difficulty increase very quickly (I think of floor 5 I think with the vampires)

Actual Review

Quest of Dungeons is a game that doesn't require much skill to play as it is a point-and-click dungeon explorer, however, that does not mean it is an easy game nor is it a short game, the goal is to make it to the end of a certain amount of floors (seven I think?) and beat the final boss. You play the game in turns so everytime you move one square, attack or use a consumable that counts as a turn and your enemies can move or attack you in that time.

 On my first actual playthrough on the easy difficulty it took me about an hour and a half to get to floor 5 after exploring every single room and doing all of the quests, i had some of the best gear i could find when i went up against the boss of the floor, got cocky and didn't drink a potion, he killed me, again that was on easy the difficulty goes up to hell.

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good roguelike game that allows them to just sit down, relax and click the left mouse button.

I get it, it's a rogue-like/retro/classic RPG with a snarky attitude. It's also just plain bad. The original ""Rogue"" and its character based followers are superior to this game in every respect. But I'm not going to try to wax poetic about why this game stinks. Let me just give a clear list of points that illustrate, very plainly, why this game is deeply flawed.

1. You and everything else have the same move speed. That means that you each move (or preform one action such as attack, open door, drink potion, etc) per turn. The problem with this system is that when you are facing a fight you know, mathematically speaking, you cannot win, you may as well just restart the game then and there. Why? Because you aren't going to be able to out damage what you're fighting and you cannot run away either. Because everything else has the same movement speed, anything that you fight will follow one space behind you... forever. They will chase you through the entire dungeon, always one space behind you (did I mention there is no actual animation in this game either. Just sprites moving along in linear motions along a grid? Yeah. Even NES RPGs had some semblance of animation, but not this ""retro"" release. But I digress) and when you stop, guess what? You're gonna get hit and die. 

2. Health and Mana slowly regenerate on a per turn basis. What this means is that after you've cleared a room, you can just spam WASD (moving one space=one turn) and pace around for a little while, to get your health back. It will regenerate to full, if you are patient enough. It doesn't take long enough to be a great nuisance to do, but it's not so quick either that it's not annoying. The main issue with this though is that it completely makes the inventory system, complete with food, health and mana potions, totally useless. You don't need to drink or eat anything because you'll always just be able regain health and energy after you've completed a room. As for actually using the potions and such in combat? That too isn't really practical because anything that you're fighting that you'd need to drink a potion for is going to kick your ass regaurdless of how much you drink. That's the biggest problem in this game. You're either gauranteed success or failure the moment you walk into a room. Either way it's just as boring.

3. The actual combat is really boring. For the wizard you're always going to be better off using your spells but your mana runs out. But, again, that doesn't really matter because you can just walk around for about a hundred turns (so about 20 seconds) to get all the mana and health you lost back. The knight is just awful. All you can do is hit stuff and then let it hit you, walk around, get back health, repeat.

I think I've made my points very clear. There are still a few bugbears though. For example, there are bear traps scattered throughout some of the rooms. Why? No reason. The player can easily avoid them, the enemies can't knock the player into them nor can the player use them to his advantage. Why are they there? No clue, but it's just a little aspect that really shows how little thought, effort, play testing, and just plain common sense went into this game.

This is an absolutely boring, cliched, uninspired game that still somehow thinks it has the right to mock the player on death (such as flashing ""Seriously?"" and ""Let's just pretend this never happened"" in red when the player dies) and ask ""leaving so soon"" when trying to quit the game. Yes, I am leaving and I will not be returning. If this were just a little flash game on Newgrounds or whatever, I'd take it as a budding game maker spreading his wings and getting his barings in. But charging actual money, no matter how little, is rediculous. Take those couple of bucks this game costs, go to a McDonalds, and get something to eat off the dollar menu. Trust me, that alone will give you far more joy and satisfaction than this game ever could.

It's cute and humourous but also pretty daunting, once you start the game you'll instantly feel lost, unaware of all the controls and options etc. but you can and will learn these pretty fast on your own, it's more the gloomy vibe of the layout that will get to you. You're actually a little scared to see what you might come up against, you have no idea how strong you are in comparison to the monsters you know are there but are yet to see. 
No idea what any of your stats mean or what any items do that you may have been fortunate enough to find early on, there are interesting looking tiles and things everywhere so here is the biggest thing you'll be doing off the bat CLICK EVERYTHING that looks at all different from the normal tile you see. 
In fact in the very first room there's a signpost you might want to click on and check out... :3
Since that's such a large part of the games experience (IMO) I won't say much more but, go everywhere check everything and be careful! You're sure to enjoy it regardless c:

[Design changes I'd like to see]
I love this game, but there are some things design wise that I think should be improved. You should be able to move your items around in your inventory at will imo since there are so many items that need to be sold at points, organising this would be majorly helpful. I also think that entrances to new rooms on the map should be marked as a different colour since its quite easy to miss if you aren't looking at it every 5 seconds. Only once you're looking back over a floor do you suddenly see you may have missed or forgotten about a few rooms.
Also I'm sorry but I have to question why you're only allowed one save file... What if I want one file per class/character? Can you not give us at least 4 slots? I don't want to have to come on and commit to one class every time and only be able to change it once I die :C
And what about a 'graveyard' of sorts, or a 'hero's plaque' where you can choose to record your past characters exploits after death ^^

Final Thoughts:
I don't know if anymore will be added to the game but I'd certainly buy DLC if it were available X3, maybe I'm a sucker, but Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is like the same genre, and I was 100% addicted to it AND it's sequels, if there were more content in this... well [i]I[/i] would love it at least <3

基本的には金色の宝箱から手に入るアイテムで装備的に金銭的にかなり楽になる。ボスはスキルを上手く使いポーション回復でゴリ押しできるが、倒すメリットが薄いため無理して戦うことはない。よって金色の宝箱が置いてある部屋の鍵とポーションは重要。クエストにしても、討伐クエストは不意の死亡率をあげる要因になることから受けない方がいい。金策のためなら別だが。アイテムについては付加効果の影響が予想以上に大きいためよく見て装備を整えること。

また、途中で出てくる盗賊系の敵は倒しても盗品が戻ってこない。[strike]しかもアイテムのスタックまとめて盗んでくる鬼畜な仕様だ。[/strike]さらに後半の魔法を使う敵にはもっと注意が必要だ。難易度ノーマルまでなら問題はないがハード以上は即死する可能性がある。特に敵のスタンを食らうとアイテム使用や回復も出来ずに一方的に攻撃を食らい死ぬことがある。運がないと回避できないので理不尽だと言わざるをえない。敵を見かけたら即殺するしか手がないためなんらかの回避方法が欲しかった。

Gameplay? Addictive, simple, rewarding, easy to streamline into faster paced dungeon delving
Story? Who needs it?
Personal Opinion? Working towards a powerful character with all abilities/spells feels great. It also provides a real sense of loss when you die and have to start all over again, though the game is simple enough that it won't take too long. So far I've not made it past the 4th floor, so restarting may not be as bad yet as, say, dying on the 10th floor (if it even goes that far).
Pro Tips
- keep everything with you until you find a merchant. All that bad gear you keep finding? Sell it. You can easily make 20K gold if you sell as much stuff as you can.
- once you have lots of gold, always buy keys from the merchants. You never know when you'll need them.",1404522169,1404522169,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

QuoD is, essentially, the ultimate 'generic Indie game'. Given the range and breadth of the so-called Indie genre, this should be impossible. Nevertheless, QuoD manages it. It's like opening your library to discover a mythical creature: something that, fundamentally, should not exist.

At this point, I feel the need to stress, [b]that is not a recommendation[/b]. The fact that it such a thing exists is marvelous, the game itself, however, is therefore not. It is the ultimate testimony to the fact that a great game requires more than a full range of acceptable elements.

There is a great misconception that, if you just throw together a bunch of tried and tested game mechanics, with a sufficiently pleasing 'Indy-pixel' aesthetic, and some decent music, and brief if moderately amusing story, and then polish it all up a bit, you will get at least a [i]decent[/i] game. QuoD is this game, and it is [i]dull[/i]. Every element of this game would prove perfectly adequate in another, better, indie title. Together, the result is far, far less than the sum of its parts.

The game mechanics are generic as they come. It's like someone took the mechanics from the original [i]Rogue[/i], and then threw in all the standard RPG sub-mechanics that players expect today. Oh, and removed most of the challenge. Upgrades are linear (and dull), combat is simplistic (and dull), level design is randomised (and dull), items are generic (and dull). You get the picture. There is not a single idea in this game that you have not seen before, probably so many times you don't even register its presence any more. Fittingly, the game does not see fit to provide a tutorial. Perhaps it sees itself as a sort of 'Wiki-learning' game, like Minecraft. Such delusions of grandeur are utterly misplaced, but fortunately you don't need one, because it's [i]so damn generic[/i].

The frippery is, similarly, so generic as to be barely worth noting. It's got cutesy pixel graphics. Gosh. In an Indie game. Someone phone the fucking press. I guess the execution's acceptable, but it's, like everything else about this game, utterly unremarkable. The music? Well, I guess it's got some. It's not chiptune, so maybe it loses a little bit of Indie cred there, but it's dull, repetetive, loops over and over again, and is repetetive, so I guess that's nearly as good. What there is of it is fine, and it isn't actively obnoxious for the first hour and a half, so I guess that's OK. And the game has seperate audio sliders, which is useful, when you finally get sick of it. Finally, the story. Um... Not much of that. There's a tiny opening cutscene, and, I'd guess, probably an ending cutscene. I freely admit, I couldn't be bothered to finish the game. I guess the story's adequate to explain why you're doing what you're doing, but Spec Ops it ain't.

So, the result? Look, I don't know if I've got the point across yet, but [i][b]OH GOD IT'S SO DULL[/b][/i]. This is proof that it possible to find an Indie game not merely lacking in execution but in heart. It's just utterly soulless. It's like someone took Realm of the Mad God and removed the elements that made it fun. The only reasons you should buy it are as a dire warning for budding game designers, and so you can get a really rare badge for your Steam profile.

If you are no real roguelike-fan and want to get into these kind of games without just throwing yourself into the real stuff like Tales of Maj'Eyal or Sword of the Stars: The Pit, then this may really be a game for you.
It basically takes out all depth there is:
You don´t need skills, enemies literally damage you nothing (with 120 life endgame getting 3 dmg from everything....), shopkeepers are just a ""lets see if he has something i want"" as you can just buy everything they have without ever worrying about money and bosses are ""hit, hit, hit, potion, continue 3 more times"".

Quest of Dungeons just might be a dungeon crawler in it's purest form. This game accomplishes it's intent save for a few exceptions:
1- The bosses are slightly imbalanced throughout the game. On the first level, they will one-hit kill you, on the seventh, you will one-shot them from across the room. Somewhere in the middle you will encounter bosses at about the right level.
2- The randomized levels have a chance of ruining your game. I finally made it to the last level on my third play-through, and what was immediately behind door #1? THE FINAL BOSS! I discovered later that the final floor has it's own unique bad guys and rooms to explore. So beware, lest the final boss is at the foot of the stairs.",1400690700,1400690700,True,58,9,0.815504074096679688,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Perfekt für die Kaffeepause!

+ Sehr einfacher Einstieg in die Welt des Rouge-like & Perma-Death Genrés
+ Die 8/16-bit Grafik
+ Einfach gehalten, kann also sofort losgespielt werden, ohne erstmal ein Handbuch auszugraben
+ Dungeons werden nach jedem neustart neu generiert.
+ Sprüche der Monster, u.a. ""The Princess is in another Castle"" oder ""Error 404 not Found""

- Die länge des Spiels ist relativ kurz (ca. 2-3 Stunden, wenn man von dem ganzen gesterbe und der Vorarbeit absieht)
- Für 4,99€ daher auch etwas teuer
- Quest (Also ich bin mir der Meinung es könne auch bessere Quest als ""Töte den Skellettkrieger"" oder ""Finde Item XYZ"" geben)
- Balance der Klassen. Die Assasine wirkt und spielt sich sehr overpowered im Vergleich zum Krieger. (Ein Minus für die Balance, nicht für die Klassen selber!)

Игра просто как мир, ходишь по замку сперва, и спускаешься всё ниже и ниже. На выбор 4 класса, один ближний и три с дальним боем, в целом игра понравилась (всё таки обожаю игры под ретро).
Плюсы:
- генерирующиеся подзамелья.
- разнообразие экипировки персонажа (при каждом классе, свои вещи генерируются).
- книги со скилами.
- боссы. (выпадают хорошие вещи). см. минусы...
- квесты на уровнях (см. минусы)

Ну и так как я люблю пиксельные игры, и такой жанр игры, то минусов я увидел больше, чем плюсов
Минусы:
- собирать всякие изумрудики и монетки не целесообразно, очень мало стоят, лучше находить вещи, и продавать их, они на много дороже.
- квесты двух типов: найди предмет, убей золотого или красного чудика...
- у боссов нету никаких отличительных черт, бьют и бывает накладывают бафы, но бафы эти есть у простых мобов.
- ключи, ещё одна проблема, то их нету, то находишь аж на другом уровне, доходило до того, что на 1 уровне не мог открыть сокровищницу, а ключ нашёл на 3 уровне ниже...
- с каждым уровнем не ощущается трудность, только на последнем уровне реально уже сложнее мобы.
- не стакающиеся монетки и еда. монетки и еда не стакающиеся очень бесят, занимая место в инвентаре, а стоят они дёшево, и еда не лучшая, вообще смысла нету.
- при использование еды, засчитывает ход, тоже всё бы ничего, но когда на последнем уровне воюешь с боссом и собираешся поесть еды, смотришь, а она востанавливает 10-25 еды, когда же босс бьёт в пределах 25, это очень тупо, ты её использовал и почти сразу потерял всё что приобрёл...)

You select your class of hero, each recalling the 8/16-bit sprite design of Final Fantasy characters, and plunge directly into the evenly tiled and sparsely furnished dungeons. By selecting a a tile (all the control is straight-forward and quite standard), your character dashes there, revealing the surroundings and leaving the rest behind cloaked in the 'fog of war'. Battling is either direct (square-to-square melee), or ranged (archery or spell-casting), and no one battle lasts more than a few hits, besides the boss battles that is.

The dungeon maps are large but unvaried - this room connects to that room which branches on to two more, and so on. Occasionally you will need a key (or three) to access a room, and these can be tricky to find, or expensive to buy. Luckily, gold is left by almost every creature you kill, and also every wardrobe, vase or box you do away with. Items are given at just about the perfect timing, with the areas levelling alongside you nicely. Boss fights break this steady curve, and are often able to perma-kill you with one-and-a-half hits.

The game is pretty charming, but is quite repetitive. When you reach a new level, you see new surroundings and new enemies, but they will remain as such until the next floor. In essence, each floor is its own stage, and sometimes the stage tends to outstay its welcome. I put this down to a lack of meaningful discovery. There's little mystery and only slight threat in each of the floors, and as said above, it is only the bosses that will pose any real worry. The special music and on-screen warning helps you from stumbling onto them too suddenly, though.

It's a fun game, but quite simple and a touch repetitious. That said, the game is quite repetitious. Repetition is the game's burden. It's worth playing, but wait for a flash sale.",1398763994,1398764026,True,4,0,0.505882382392883301,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Quest of Dungeons es un juego de Rol Point and Click al estilo Old School desarrollado por David Amador, contamos con 4 clases de guerreros, muy típicas entre estos juegos, Arquero, Caballero, Chaman y Mago. Tiene una durabilidad media, pero a la larga se empieza a hacer muy fácil y repetitivo, las misiones están carentes de creatividad. Es un juego para pasar un rato, solo eso ya que después comienza a aburrir.  En cuanto a gráficos, es carente de efectos, los único que posee son las habilidades de los personajes y los “hits” (golpes) a los enemigos.  Con respecto a sonido, la música de fondo es increíble, pero en cuanto a efectos sonoros son muy pocos los que hay. En cuanto a originalidad, tiene muchos aspectos cómicos, como los diálogos de los personajes, pero en cuanto al juego en sí, es lo mismo que otros.

Un Dungeon Crawler por turnos de estilo Roguelike que conseguirá que si os engancha, paseis unas cuantas horas recorriendo mazmorras sin parar. El juego es sencillo y simple, y tiene suficientes opciones y variedad como para que no acabe resultando tedioso y aburrido tras unas pocas horas de juego.

La historia cuenta con bastante humor como la Muerte robó el candil que albergaba la luz del mundo. Cuatro heroes deciden entrar en su guarida, plagada de enemigos y peligros, para restaurar el bien. 
- Uno es el guerrero, fuerte en el cuerpo a cuerpo y soportando dolor, con habilidad destinadas a protegerse y a destruir enemigos.
- Otro es el mago, debil con las armas pero destructor con la magia. Cuenta con numerosos hechizos para protegerse, curarse, hacer mucho daño y frenar a los enemigos.
- El Chaman es un personaje equilibrado, con habilidades potenciadoras para el y penalizadoras para el enemigo.
- Y finalmente el asesino, un arquero certero y agil con numerosas habilidades en la lucha cuerpo a cuerpo y a distancia con las que burlar y acabar con los enemigos.

Las mazmorras estan llenas de enemigos, jefes, cofres y secretos por descubrir. Tienen un tamaño bastante decente y si se exploran enteras dan para al menos 2 horas de juego hasta llegar al final. El equilibrio de dificultad es un poco desigual, segun el personaje que escojas, pero en la dificultad dificil puede suponer un reto hasta que le coges el truco al juego tras varias partidas. El personaje que quizas es mas desafiante es el guerrero, ya que debes atacar siempre cuerpo a cuerpo y pueden ponerte las cosas un poco mas dificiles.
La musica es bastante buena, y al final se hace pegadiza y te sorprenderas taraeando algunas de las musicas del juego (la del mercader es genial).

São 4 poderosas classes que você pode tomar o controle, que são: Guerreiro, Assassino, Mago e Shaman. Cada uma possui especificações como os equipamentos e as habilidades que usarão e encontrarão durante toda a jornada. Durante tal jornada você enfrentará dezenas de monstros e chefes poderosos, coletará ouro e itens e tudo que um bom RPG pode oferecer. 

A trilha sonora é bem interessante, e remete muito aos clássicos da era de 16 bits, principalmente no tema de calabouços (como o nome do jogo já sugere). 

As batalhas são feitas por turnos, mas não turnos como a maioria dos RPGs. Basicamente, um passo é um turno e isso incluí os inimigos também. A cada passo / ataque que der, será a vez deles e assim eles andarão ou te atacarão se possível. A duração de cada batalha dependerá da velocidade com que você aperta o botão contra o inimigo, que pode ser em 1 segundo ao infinito, já que se você não se mover, o jogo basicamente não flui.

Bosses are about the only thing that require any thought or effort (and the ones I met still never came close to killing me - they just required the use of skills).

Random dungeons? Sort of. Yes, the dungeons are random, but they ALL follow the exact same pattern of hub and spokes. If you go out a 'spoke' you won't find any way to connect to the spokes next to it - except by going back to the hub.  You will NEVER find a circular route.  So, explore north, come back to the middle along the same path, explore east, come back to the middle along the same path, explore south, etc. You will NEVER find a path that connects from center to north to east back to center.  A forced path would have been better - at least that way your not spending half your time covering ground you've already covered.

Gems aren't worth picking up. Their value is just too much lower than the equipment you find.

This is one of the first Portuguese games ever to make it to a major videogame digital distribution platform (previous examples fall to A Walk in the Dark on Steam and Under Siege on PSN), and the results are positive. Let me explain the topics I've mentioned above: the game is simple. You only need the mouse to play it, but the WASD keys are also very helpful. The mechanics themselves are very simple and pleasant, and even if one hasn't ever played a rogue-like there will be no difficulty in adapting to the game mechanics. Funny, because the plot is based on clichés and ironies. The plot is not a big deal, of course, but that's the objective. Hard, because there is permadeath: you die, you're over. There is no respawn. You have to start from the very beggining. There are also random bosses that can bring instant death if they are found early in the game. Addictive, because of the very reason that makes games like Binding of Isaac addicting: every thime you die and have to start over, you reach further areas and advance a little more with each time you play. You discover new things, new techniques, new content and came, step by step, closer to finally reach the end of the game. So, I have written this review without finnishing the game, and my opinion might change a bit when I finally do it. If that proves right, I will edit this review in order to make it more actual. Now, if the game is worth the 5€: it depends. If you're a fan of rogue-like games, then buy it. If you are just looking for a game to relax, consider buying it with a discount.

The game doesn't wow you with its retro style graphics, or overly complex game play.  You're given a choice of 4 heroes, each representing a different style of play (melee, magic user, archer, or fighter/mage combo), a difficulty level (easy, normal, hard), and you start crawling through a randomly generated dungeon.  Your goal is to navigate your character through the levels to reach the bottom and have a showdown with the final boss, the Dark Lord.  

The character is controlled with simple arrow keys to move up, down, left and right.  The two icons on the lower right allow different attacks.  The ""i"" button allows you to pull up the inventory and character screen.  The ""m"" button pulls up the auto map.  The red and blue potion icons at the top left corner shows your current health and mana.  Your inventory is limited, and your goal is to stay alive while gaining levels and accumulating gold, healing items, and finding better equipment.  Every level has a shopkeeper to sell your excess or unwanted inventory for money to buy keys or items.

The main issue with QoD is permanent death.  Once your hero dies, you gotta start over with a new game.  And do expect to die a LOT while you figure out how to fight the various aggressive monsters that go straight for your jugular.  You have the option to save and quit as long as your hero is alive.  But once your character dies, you can't reload from that save point.

That being said, I was able to finish the game on easy mode with a mage in 3 1/2 hours.  For a gamer who manages to finish a game once every few years, that is an achievement.  I may go back and replay in a more difficult setting in the near future.

I should probably play it again on hard. Another thing that is a little upsetting is the game ends so abruptly. You're not given the option to continue or even to finish the floor you're on.

My first run I tried out the archer who can hit anything he can see while they slowly creep towards him. As soon as I figured that out, I never got hit again. The most difficult part of being an archer is finding shopkeepers to sell all your loot so your inventory isn't full anymore. Not that you need any loot, all you need is  the sleep spell, which as far as I can tell puts anything you want to sleep such that it cannot act until you kill it, which is how i beat every boss.
I played again as the warrior to see what it'd be like to play something that couldn't just kill everything before taking damage. I still quickly became a god, though I had to use health potions at first. Luckily I found the warrior's version of ""sleep"" within the first 5 minutes. Only this version is an AoE shout wth a 95% success rate which paralyzes everything until you kill it. However, this time I did not succeed on my playthrough. This time I walked into a room and was promptly frozen by some random non-boss mob, I couldn't move or heal or do anything but watch it slowly kill me after hitting me several times. As far as I can tell, there is a random mob who can instantly kill you from any range no matter how strong you are. The only thing you can do is not be unlucky, or just play an archer.
I didn't try the other two classes, but if they don't both have the ability to at least instantly kill everyboss for free then they are severely underpowered. If you still feel compelled to play this, probably try either the mage of the druid (though im sure the mage has something and wouldn't be surprized if the druid did all the same.)

The only thing I liked about this game were the graphics. That's actually what drew me to play again, something about them I us find very appealing.

Unless you are really stuck on the 8-bit art style, I'd instead go with Wazhack or Sword of the Stars: The Pit, both of which are excellent.

Here are the pros:

1) A little humor in the game which is mildly amusing.

2) Scratches your 8-bit nostalgia itch, if you have one. 

3) The music tracks are cool if you like 8/16-bit MIDI tracks. I quite like them personally. 

Here are the cons:

1) Waaaay too easy on normal difficulty. Only the boss fights are hard. The rest of the time you will rarely if ever need to use your special abilities. Overall gameplay is fairly simple compared to some of the other rogue-likes I've seen. 

2) Loot system and the game in general is not well balanced. You gain skills by acquiring skill books. These drop way too often, so by level 3 of the dungeon you've already acquired all the skills for your class.

3) There are ONLY 7 LEVELS for this game. VERY short for a rogue-like game.

4) Generally uninspired and derivative. Absolutely nothing new is introduced to this ancient formula. It's been done better many times before.

It's not a bad game, particularly in terms of polish. It's finished, it works, it has a proper structure... But it's very, very low on actual content and challenge.

You'll learn all your spells within about 10 minutes, your level doesn't really matter (there's no other progression either), items are all boring with no visual effects and they rarely even have extra stats making it a game where you just look at one green number to choose all your gear and by the end i didnt remember even a single item I had on.

The upside is the game is fast and you can finish it within 30m (so sayeth the achievements, I suspect faster is possible) so if you want something to play in short bursts its good for that. But with so little content I find it hard to believe you'd want to play this much.

The game is a ton of fun and you should check it out.  I'll give you guys a run down of some of the stuff I like and a few things that could be improved.  I do want to point out one thing though.  Since the release of this game the developer has done many updates addressing any and all problems found.  Always good to see a developer so passionate and eager about righting wrongs, tweaking things, or just addressing issues.

Quest Of Dungeons is an extremely fun turn-based dungeon crawling roguelike game.  You gain loot, experience, levels, skills and spells as well.  

If you liked Hack, Slash, Loot, and wanted a little more out of it, or you are a big fan of Dungeons Of Dredmor, but feel it might be a bit TOO complex, then THIS is your middle ground.  The graphics are minimalist but not bad, the sounds and music are well done and the gameplay is very nice.  

You get loot from killing stuff and opening chests and your skills are found the same way in the form of skill books or tomes.    No clumsy skill trees or crazy keyboard commands here.  Just a combination of mouse clicky clicks, keyboard movement (If you want it) and your skill.  Really fun game, I highly recommend you check it out.

I was able to review/preview the game through a review/press copy of the game from the developer.  He's a super nice guy and I feel he did an amazing job.  All that being said there are still some things that need work.

*** Please Note:  I left the below section in to show what I had said about the game upon release.***

********************************************************************************************************************
The difficulty of the game (at least with the two heroes I beat it with) needs an overhaul.  The first floor or two can be relatively difficult and if you are just completely not paying attention bad juju can happen, but overall the game is a touch too easy.  I did beat the game on hard and I felt there should be a larger difficulty increase between normal and hard as well as the different floors.

Not only that, you also seem to max out your skills well within the first two floors as well.  Now, I'm all about having options but it tends to make tricky situations a bit easier when you have your full array of abilities about 10-15 minutes into the game.  I suppose this could be the reason the game gets much easier after the second floor as well.  My suggestion would be to possibly lower the drop rate or spread out the skill books a bit more.

You gain a tremendous amount of gold as the game progresses, far more than you could ever spend.  Again, the first two floors of the game you are sort of skill/gold/gear starved, but after the second floor, little can touch you or at least do much damage before you kill it.

Now that's not to say there are no challenges in the game.  The quest mobs and the boss mobs are still pretty nasty, but they really are the biggest challenge.  Traps and normal mobs really offer little challenge at best.
********************************************************************************************************************

The developer pretty much addressed any and all issues I had above.  He added a new difficulty level, adjust the gold issues, and it seems lowered the skill tome drops as well.  It's almost TOO hard now.  So, if you like a challenge, it's here in spades with the new difficulty setting!  Well done Sir, well done.

I still find the game insanely fun and quite enjoyable.  As I stated earlier the developer is updating and making changes frequently and I feel he has a solid game.  The tweaking and work done after release on Quest Of Dungeons has turned this extremely fun and enjoyable roguelike game into an extremely fun, enjoyable, and challenging GREAT roguelike game.  I highly recommend it, even more so than I did before.  Quest Of Dungeons is well worth the small $4.99 pricetag.

Overall, the game is worthy of several fun hours of play, and quite a lot of replayability.   Simple gameplay, with simple graphics, and rules with basic rogue strategies.   The downside right now as on release, is the GUI.  It could benefit greatly from an overhaul, as there is a lacking of hotkeys, along with cluttered inventory management.  Spell, and Skill selection consists of several mouseclicks to use, so setting up defenses, buffs, and attacks is a matter of 5 to 20 mouseclicks of manually selecting.    Also, was the lacking of passing time by standing still, which from a strategic POV, hinders you in battle if there is 1 square difference between you and a foe.  Even on Easy mode, there was a large gap in learning curve between dungeon levels.  Almost as if it could use a tad bit more game balancing for one or two classes.

If you can get past some of the quirks, then it can lead to many hours of play.  Be warned, its a true roguelike, with perma death, so it may not be everyones cup of tea.

I'm down to floor 2 and I have over 200.000 pieces of gold with me I don't need, because the Items in the shop to buy are rubbish compared to those, I carry with me. Why?
Because this game is still inbalanced!

Why collecting gems to sell them later for 12 gold each, when you just can hold on to those books with your skill spells? After completing half of floor 1 I had all my skills, but those books kept coming. So I collected them. With over 5.000 gold per book and dozens of them to sell I am rich now. And bored.

Being a completionist I killed all enemies in floor 1. Now I am so strong that I just rush through the rest of the rooms. I can't say what the game is like after floor 2. Because it is too boring to find out. Everytime the same thing. Go into a room, kill the enemies with 2 punches and then the fiddling with your inventory. Why should I carry so many items, when I can buy some potions (stackable). Compared to the food items (non-stackable and less health-giving) these are the best. But in the case of beeing -that- rich: Why having those stupid food items which just overload your inventory?!

So you try to keep vour inventory clean. Which is hard work! Why? Because if there are some items on the ground, for example 5 bottles of water and a piece of armour and you just want to collect the armour, you still have to pick everything up, when the armour is on the ground and the bottles above.

Every enemy has the same schematic of fighting, the A.I. is also boring as hell - Which isn't exactly true, because I think that being tortured in hell would be more exciting than playing a game which is very, very, very, very, very easy. Maybe you should call your ""Normal""-Difficulty that way. Although it would be a very long button - but not as long as my annoyance will go on.

I have played games with the same price and wasn't bored after 1h of gameplay, so I have a right to expect more than being bored and unimpressed after the first floor.
Do better. Now. Or announce your little game as not finished. Or announce it as ""Give us your money for nothing. Thanks."". What a great and fun title for your game!

Usually I am not this enraged by anything, but since there are so many bad games in steam, people should be warned. I have no problem at all with low-budget games which are finished after 3 or 4 hours. I have no problem with games I can't finish because they are too hard.

Horrible.  Turn based RPGs may be my favorite thing ever but this....  Beat it in an hour an a half and enjoyed about the first 10-15 minutes.  I have NEVER uninstalled a game so fast (not an exaguration I've play hundreds of games and it was a first).  It is clear that ZERO effort went in to this game.  I almost never write reviews but when a game is this bad you just need to.  I will list just a few of the billion complaints I can think of.

1.  There are like 8 floors and I got every skill in the game for my class (yes EVERY SKILL) by half way through THE FIRST FLOOR.  Every skill book there after was pawned off for lots of gold which I don't understand cause they are worth like 200 pieces of chicken but I turn over a rock and 3 of these books come tumbeling out.

2.  Balance is non-existent.  I only played one class but with how horrible the game is won't try the others.  The shamens first skill will kill almost anything anything by itself.  Goen are the days are combining skills with other skills for cool combos cause hell I can just use Terror and they wont attack for like 7 turns!  How my severaly underleveled shamen was able to scare death (the final boss) over and over, shank him repteadly and then when he would wake up put him to sleep (probably the most combo esque thing i ever did) while I wait for terror to come off cooldown in 3 more turns is beyond me.

3.  Enemies are all the same.  Almost every enemy is exactly the same.  They move the same but have different health and damage ratings.  All they do is melee.  A few guys shoot but those are the only other type and they just act the same as eachother.  I dont remember if bosses were the same as I would just fucking fear/sleep lock them (and set them on fire for fun).

4.  First floor i explored everything.  2nd and 3rd I was bored and just wnated it to end but figured if I dint at leats get the items the bosses and merchents had I would have no chance.  OH HOW WRONG I WAS!  See I guess there were 8 floors in my first complaint but I honeslty don't know because I would enter a floor and leave it for the next one just a few turns later.  Sure the enemies were much more powerful then me after I did this like 3 times but I guess I can just be glad the Vampire Lords and Mummies are so afraid of me that they can't even attack.  Oh and did I mention potions?  The best health/mana restore items stack and take only 1 turn to use!  Gj almost one shotting me Death due tot he fact that I skipped 6 floors!  *sleeps then heals to full health*

5.  But items are procedurelly generated like levels!  It is like borderlands!  that is cool right!?  NO!!!!!!!!  They have random stats and random names.  The only procedurale thing about them is the names vaguly remind me of the way you might put english words together and the damage values tend to be hiigher on later floors (that requires a very advanced algorithum you know!).  I did love the VERY RARE stat adjustments on items though!  Wait what?  What do you mean there is no way to tell what any of the stats do!?

I could go on but honeslty I feel like if I havnt convinced you not to buy it (and if you already bought at least dont install and/or play it as it isnt even worth that) yet then you probably were going to buy it no matter what you read hear.

Quest of Dungeons is a traditional roguelike game in which the Dark Lord has stolen all the light and it is up to you to venture down into the dungeon and defeat him to reclaim it. While the premise doesn’t seem to offer anything significantly original, how well does it stack up against other recent roguelike’s and what exactly does it offer compared to others?

Mas não sei se vale a pena comprar.
Sou fã de jogos do estilo mas Quest Of Dungeons é tem um problema...
Apartir do inicio do game você tem que esplorar e procurar as coisas 
matando os npc's que aparecem mas e quando morre ?
Apartir da sua morte o mundo é excluido e tem de começar des do 0 .

There's still rough edges but the game is heading in the right direction.

Things are changing so fast that I've tried to reduce my review to a set of bad points and then marking them when they are fixed. This way people can see what the original release was like and what steps the dev has taken so far to rectify the situation.


The game itself doesn't teach you how to play or tell you the controls.

[FIXED] No manual

[FIXED] You can't redefine the keyboard controls

With keyboard you can only pickup from square you're on not around you like mouse

Stairs are bump to go up or down them

Map gen can block rooms with stairs

[FIXED] you can bump to smash pots and things, but you can't bump chests to open them or bump little grave like things that give quests or bump shopkeepers to begin trading.

Have to use the mouse to examine objects in your inventory and to use them.

[FIXED] Unclear where the hotspot of the pointer actually is.

You have to click on items to see their stats. Tooltip would be better

[FIXED] Have to use the mouse pointer for ranged combat

[FIXED] When you open the minimap it obscures the middle of the screen. would be better top right corner

When you damage a mob, its lowered hp doesn't show on its hp bar until after it's taken its next turn 

Resting gives you hp and mp back but there's no rest until full option. You can hit skip a turn (enter) but that doesn't auto repeat, so you would have to spam it far too many times (I'm talking hundreds of times). The best way to get your hp and mp back after fights is to run from side to side of a dungeon over and over again

Also above means that in boss encounters you can just kite melee bosses in a square and take no damage. Giving bosses diagonal attacks would solve this but would make them a lot harder so it's probably not something you would want to do.

[FIXED]  movement keys auto-repeat almost immediately which I think he's done so people can treat it as a real time game although it's turn-based. This leads to moving twice when you only wanted to move once though.",1395782797,1398596705,True,1,0,0.344847738742828369,7,True,False,False,False,,,
