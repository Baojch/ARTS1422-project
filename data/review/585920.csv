Thanks to Puzzle One, I can now attempt to solve colorful group theory puzzles from the comfort of a 2D monitor, without risk of destruction to plastic objects.

The orientation markers are helpful for me to get my bearings. I'm a fan of puzzles, but color swippy-swappy puzzles are still kind of new to me.",1688234758,1688234758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Gameplay consists of rotating puzzle sections around until all the colours match and are in the right positions, that's all there is to it.  On the upsides this is a bit more sophisticated than most mobile apps that get dumped on Steam pretending to be mobile apps, but that's really a lot like bragging about being pretty tall for a midget. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.  The implementation here is of such poor quality, the developer couldn't work out how to make the game display in fullscreen, it only runs in a window.

The game features extremely lazy, minimalist ""art"", of the type you normally expect to see in low effort Flash/browser games and mobile apps.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes ""Puzzle One"" might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected in the general public reception.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 5 players.  That's right, only 5.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in the game is to be expected.  Gamers just didn't take this low quality game seriously, and for good reason.

Puzzle One is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.",1679238792,1679238792,False,2,1,0.242881670594215393,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The editor is not friendly to begginers, you will need to know how to code in XML.
