The visuals are cool and I really like the variety of art styles between levels, it's nice to look at. The game feels like it is unfinished in ways though and could probably use a few more months of polishing up. I did have some fun with this, I even got to try some of the split screen multiplayer today because I thought that's probably where most of the fun would be. It was okay but even more problems seemed to creep up as I played.

The levels are very short and only 2 laps and I didn't find a way to change them. There are 5 tournaments with 4 tracks in each for a total of 20 tracks but they are over so fast. I wish the tournaments were at least 3 laps with an option for more.

The characters are all weird looking but in a way that I like. The opening movie intro is laughably terrible in the same way a terrible movie can be enjoyable. I liked that, very cheap but hilarious. I like the colors and the art, it's decent especially for a 5 dollar game.

The controls feel strange, they need more updating or tweaking to get right where it would feel good. There is no way to drift corners that I could find and that's sort of a staple in cart racing these days so it feels lacking. You often will get stuck on the walls, especially if using the boost item because the speed is so fast and the tracks are so small. In some tracks there are objects that completely stop you and you can get stuck in them forcing a manual respawn. Sometimes you get sent backwards from an item or something but it's so hard to slow down and go back to forwards, I don't understand why that needs to be so difficult. I also at one time must have missed some invisible checkpoint somehow because I ended up having to race through at least half a track with it telling me the whole time I was going the wrong way when I wasn't.

While racing the game is practically silent with the exception of the decent music. Your characters do talk a bit or have reactions to various things but it seems like you only hear it when within a couple feet of the character due to the audio range so most of the race is just engine and music. 

It's little things like this that are for the most part fixable or can be tweaked to work better. The game really needs more polish and work. I did have a bit of fun with it but at the same time if I bought this I would be feeling pretty dissapointed with it in it's current state. I think this could be okay but it needs more work for sure. It's cheap so get it if you want but I'd wait for a sale or hopefully some more updates first.",1567905705,1666753908,False,10,0,0.626317322254180908,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I think the difficulty and control scheme is aimed towards VR or a younger audience because it lacked power sliding or jumping like you would find in some of the more popular kart streams.  Once I get a newer video card, I'll be interested to see how the VR plays.

Power Up Notes:
Override protection - If you have a power-up that you want to keep, running into another power-up shouldn't over-ride it.  There were many times I'd get a less desired power up so i would have to try to dodge the power-ups instead.

Missiles - Either track targets better or at the very least stay parallel with the ground.  There were times where my missiles would just shoot straight into the ground without any chance of hitting a target

Unlucky/Lucky block:  instead swapping the exact position, try to make the swap easier.  If I got a unlucky block, I could just drive into a wall and then usually pass the person I just swapped places with.  Honestly, it's a bit annoying to pull this when you're in first so I'd be fine with the removal of these.",1567545038,1567545038,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Lo bueno es que su pronta llegada al acceso anticipado de Steam le dará (esperemos) la retroalimentación necesaria para hacer las muchas mejoras que deben ser implementadas para que logre ser un título relativamente aceptable.

Renzo Racer tiene un estilo caricaturesco, su estilo visual se asemeja mucho a los juegos que teníamos por allá en final de los tiempos del PlayStation 1. Su desarrollador comenta en la descripción que se «va a poner a prueba nuestra habilidad de conducción», y bueno, ¡Por la barba de Lord Gaben que sí! Pero no necesariamente porque tengamos frente a nosotros una experiencia de simulacion inmaculada, no. Eso recae más bien en dos puntos importantes; primero, la maniobrabilidad de los vehículos apesta, es como manejar un camión en Euro Truck Simulator, pero en un kart de cuatro ruedas, para poder tomar algunas curvas sin chocar con los costados de cualquier circuito es necesario ir a una velocidad absurdamente baja; segundo, las físicas de los automotores deben mejorar, se tambalean mucho, demasiado para mi gusto. Necesita cambios en esto o no pasará de ser un juego más.
 
Es tanto el tema del problema de intentar maniobrar con los carritos que incluso veremos a la IA chocas sus autos en las vueltas. Aunque confieso es bastante divertido verlos, no pasa de ser un área de mejora para Renzo Racer.

Los circuitos son pequeños, en eso si aciertan: fast paced, osea, que tendremos partidas rápidas. Es un juego de carreras casual, en el que estaremos por un corto tiempo hasta que la impotencia de no poder controlar nuestro personaje nos lleve a un salvaje ALT + F4. Arreglen este tema, y pongan el multijugador local, y tendrán en mí y mis hijos 3 jugadores asegurados todos los fines de semana.

Pero no todo es para que haya mejoras, Renzo Racer tiene cosas buenas. Sus escenarios son variados, coloridos, muy bonitos. Siento que es para un público de corta edad, al ver sus personajes no me es complicado pensar en que a mi hijo le gustará mucho el señor ardilla, o ver a mi hija queriendo escoger a la pequeña conejita (aunque su mirada es un poco perturbadora, se le ve cierta angustia).
 
Las carreras pueden tener variantes, algunas son terrestres, otras acuáticas, todas de diseños bonitos, cortos, con atajos (nada  disimulados) y con muchos colores, hasta este momento tenemos 20. Algunas pistas nos recordaran a Mario Kart, como la carrera de arco iris en Renzo Racer. Mencionamos los personajes anteriormente; de momento hay 16, y son animales, como lobos, osos, cuerpoespines, etc., cada uno con su propio kart, que a su vez, tienen prestaciones distintas cada uno.

Renzo Racer tiene un precio bastante razonable de momento, cuesta $5 USD, una suma bastante pequeña, para apoyar un bonito juego, que posterior a algunas mejoras podría ser mejor.

I started a new short segment called ""Lost on Steam"" which features games that have few reviews for one reason or another. Definitely not necessarily negative, just games that slipped by people.

This is one of the featured games this week! 

Renzo Racer is an interesting cartoonish racing game, similar to Mario Kart in that... they are both cart racers. That's where it ends. The animations are bland and missing in many cases, the actual cart physics are akin to dropping marbles down a well on Jupiter and the items and combat have the range of a potato.

There are no redeeming features of this game that would make you want to play it besides the fact that it has a quit button on the main menu. 

Oh right, they also are stealing music from Undertale. The song in the last race I play? An Enemy Approaches, Undertale.

tl;dr - Actual copyright theft. You can check my video below.

From all the bad reviews I went in with zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised.

It’s true some tracks are just OK. The single race track was meh and super hard compared to the grad prix races. Those are fun and more colorful. And if you can manage to keep your kart on the track and get ahead it usually is pretty easy to place first or sometimes third after you know a track.
The only improvement I’d suggest is an option to unlock all tracks and racers from the start. I’m thinking some racers will get frustrated and give up on a race game that’s actually pretty good.

While many times we expect AAA quaility from titles with this modifier, this game is not that. It is very much a pre-alpha tech demo. That being said, I feel it has potential. It isnt great atm, it is missing quite a bit of polish as well as a bit of meat as well. But if you look underneath it, I see a game that has potential. The characters are fun, if a bit static (Note again this isnt a criticism, more of a sign it is very early in development) and each of the tracks I have raced in so far are fun and a bit memorable. This reminds me of the old CroMag Rally by Pangeasoft back in the early 2000's. Now that being said, there are a few tweaks that will help it do better, and while I am sure they will take time, the game will be all the better for it. The physics of the game feels, for a lack of a better term, floaty. Each cart needs to feel like it has a bit more weight to it and to stay down on the track a bit easier. Also while it is due to mario kart, there is also a reason drifting is ubiqitous with Kart games, and it is because it just feels better to play with. Add those in and tighten up the steering a bit, and you will have a solid game to develop for and play for many days to come. 

My only other technical requests are the ability to customize the controls and a quit game button.

TLDR: This game is early access in every sense of the word. It has a long way to go, but it has potential. Give it a bit more time in the oven, and you have the makings of a fun little kart racer.",1529264495,1529264495,True,3,0,0.46128574013710022,0,False,True,True,False,,,

[i]You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/1VCVUrGEDn4 [/i]

This is a fun budget-title arcade kart racer for VR, but if you're expecting Mario Kart VR then you'll be sorely disappointed. This is not triple AAA quality, I'm not even sure it's one A quality. There's a lot of issues with this title that keep in the budget-title category. But that's okay, it's good for what it is .... cheap, semi-broken fun.

The controls are really what hold this title back. Turning should not be this questionable. If you're okay with careening on the edges of the track and having your kart go sideways and on the edge of flipping over and utter chaos, then this is a game for you. The race always starts with chaos & madness as you try to make your way up the ranks. If you're able to get ahead, then things generally tend to go a lot smoother for you. Getting out in front is the name of the game. However, if you can't get near the front by the first lap then it's almost impossible to finish first. There's just too many things that can go wrong.

There are power-ups / downs along the way. It's totally random on what you'll get. You can get that speed boost that you really need or you can get something else that is probably not useful or worse, an unlucky shamrock that will set you back even further. Conversely, if you're ahead what you really want is bombs to place that will make it impossible for your enemies to get ahead. 

There are also several obstacles along the way. They seem to always be a problem when you're behind but never a problem when you're out in front. There are 20 different tracks and 16 different racers. Each track is unique and some are just outright plain crazy in their design. I had trouble with all the water tracks. It's just even more difficult to control your racer. Each kart animal is also different, they vary in speed, acceleration, weight, and handling. Once you find one that's good, the game gets a lot easier whether on easy or normal difficulty. 

Besides the hectic controls, there were graphical issues. I had frame-rate drops no matter what setting I had the graphics on (beautiful, good, or fast). The only other option is for sounds. I would have liked the controls to be better (even better if we could have used our motion controllers to move the steering wheel). The graphics also could have used some fine tuning for VR as it seems the scales are not correct and the textures just aren't the best. There are pop-in issues at a distance on my 1060 GTX.

Still, despite all the issues, I had fun. This is a silly arcade racer where lots of mayhem can happen, especially early on in the race when you're trying to get out in front. The different tracks & racer unlocks will keep you entertained ... at least for a few hours.

Проблема не обогнать соперников, у них интеллект не большой, а удержаться на трассе первым ни во что не врезаясь и вписываться в повороты, что на водных трассах ещё сложнее сделать так как управляемость там ещё хуже. Кто был тестером у игры, как в неё играть можно!? Надоедает завывания двигателя и довольно скоро, как-то непонятно реализовано переключение коробки передач со второй на третью - вместо того что бы просто переключиться она циклично завывает и ещё некоторое время так набирает скорость.
Визуально игра сойдёт для совсем нишевой категории, но она малоиграбельна в управлении и ребёнок уж точно в такую играть не захочет, она не даст радости и фана.

Renzo Racer is another pothole in my search for a great kart racer, and I'm not sure Early Access is going to fix it. Praise where praise is due, RR comes with 16 characters (without special abilities) and 20 maps out of the garage, and depending on the track you can play either in a car or watercraft, and destroy certain object as advertised. But ""fast and furious racing action"" is where the ""obstacles and surprises"" collide.

Despite being a grubby machine, Renzo could have most of its problems buffed out; its characters are charming, but their full potential is brought down by an amateurishly animated opening cutscene, and there's just some vehicles that are objectively worse looking than others (EDIT: The developers have made an effort to improve vehicles in places, increasing character appeal). Take for example the titular Renzo - he drives in an security buggy, whereas Walter Wolf drives in a beastly machine. No matter his stats, I'll always go for style over substance, what little there is. Because the stats like speed, acceleration and weight mean nothing. It's become quite a trend for games to not explain what these mean, and Renzo Racer is no exception.

The worst thing about the game was how it controls, now no longer much of an issue. Turning is still slightly stiffer than I'd like and because of this it makes sense the roads don't have many sharp turns, but this isn't a good thing. Not when powersliding and drifting have been a staple of kart racers for decades, something that is woefully lacking here. What's even stranger is that when you hit a surface (and you will because the brakes are shoddy too), you miraculously find yourself facing the direction you came from. Always. It defies physics to make you drive around in a circle or reverse painfully to get back on track. If you leap off a ramp, you might find the car's sensitivity shooting through the roof, swaying from side to side uncontrollably. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground.

RR now features three powerups; a speed boost which is too fast and causes the physics engine to soil itself and rockets which only work when locking onto people. Despite the lack of originality or quantity, this is surprisingly a pleasant offering. No more sifting through 17 or so powerups for the 3 good ones like in a Sonic racer, and it's not as though the game requires the tactical, competitive genius of Mario Kart 7, again overwhelming the player. It's the one thing Renzo Racer has in moderation. Thank God.

I had previously said ""I'm not sure Early Access is going to fix it"" because Renzo Racer seems to be designed around its hideous controls, but despite my firm belief in this the developer has gone through Hell and high bridges to improve the game. I'd thought that if the tracks remained as wide and one dimensional as they were, powersliding will have as much thrill as throwing a hotdog down the M1. For six minutes. With the greater top speed and controls, I could see a place for powersliding to better help the player navigate the maps. And thanks to the well needed boost, maps aren't as long and tedious. 

Renzo Racer is a cutesy if bog standard karter, brought down by some uninspired tracks and janky controls. Still, it does a lot well with its character roster and level hazards. For the low low price of £3.99, you can't go wrong.... but you can easily do better for a few quid more.",1497635274,1574796459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A cart racer to me would be drifting around corners, getting power-ups that either boost your speed or weapons/things that stops your opponents and this has neither on the firstt track at least. (no way to e-brake as far as I can tell and I pressed all the buttons, the only one that did anything is Y and it's just changing the camera)

You'll encounter some minute obstacles that will make your cart flip over on it's side even though they're small enough to just be slightly annoying to an ant.

If you hit the wall you'll get turned around/face it dead on, the AI is even more stupid than I am and that's saying a lot as you'll see a bunch of them going the wrong way here and there.

This is Forza horizon without the control or any of the fun where it should be super arcade ridicilous in the vein of Re-Volt...

Sure, it has nice enough graphics and super cute animals you can play as but it has nothing fun about it, not to mention you can't (at least I can't on my PC) quit it without Win telling me ""the program has stopped working""....and I do wish the computers used by the devs had told them that they stopped working way too soon....",1496180962,1496180962,False,15,1,0.547233879566192627,5,True,False,True,False,,,
