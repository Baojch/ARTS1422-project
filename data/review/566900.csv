Fly your wings through each level dodging the obstacles in your path while also collecting fuel to stop yourself from crashing down. Simultaneously try to collect the coins to earn yourself higher grade medals which unlock different novelty wings and skins [i](Dragons, Brooms, Drones, UFOs etc.)[/i]. The levels are randomly generated which offers the challenge by putting your reflexes to the test and each world provides new environments, obstacles, soundtracks, and day and night cycles. [i](Worlds: Country, Snow, Sea, Desert, Cavern, City, Volcano, Toy, Space)[/i]. There is also the option to fly in 1st or 3rd person mode which can be activated via controller during gameplay.

After the campaign there is the added bonus of blitz mode which is practically a new game itself. Set in WW2 in a vintage black and white atmosphere you must use new controls to shoot down enemy planes to gain fuel for as long as you can.

You're rewarded once again after blitz mode with the added bonus of endless mode (I love this one). This mode features all the campaign world levels in an infinite cycle but as you progress dodging obstacles the speed increases infinitely also, making it become hectic really quick. The tempo of the soundtrack also increases with the speed which adds to the fun!

The graphics are limited to an old Atari style presentation, but with the modern flash and smooth animation of VR.  The simplicity of it has you flying fast automatically while you try and stay airborne by hitting fuel signs in a constantly depleted fuel situation, all the while avoiding collision with the obstacles in your path, and collecting coins all the while.  40 levels are passable with bronze and silver medals coming with ease, but gold medals require a large portion of coins being captured and you need all 40 gold in the 40 levels(10 sets of 4 common themed maps) in order to advance to the 2nd thrid of this game.  

The 2nd area is blitz mode, giving a black and white WWII style rainy night over london firefighting.  You must shoot down 40 planes, all the while collecting the fuel they leave behind when destroyed.  It took a while before I finally jumped all thw way to 59.  Before that I had reached 30 once followed by a heartbreaking 39 and then many more trys before I blasted on through this section.  

Finally comes endless mode, a short, fuel heavy replay of all the standard maps, connected indefinitely while you fly through the sun cycles of dawn to day to dusk to night and back to dawn again.  You hear the cheers that ended levels before but do not stop.  Actually you speed up just a tad with each segment of the sewed together endless stream and a nice arcade music track plays, speeding up in sync with the increase of your flight speed as you hold on and build up as much speed as you can surive past.  

Platinum medals are bonus skins for the many different flyers you unlock.  Besides comsmetic value there is one difference that really adds up over time and that is the tight quickness each new vehicle increases in handling.  This allows you to try tighter, more aggressive cuts and cross over manuevers.  I still have 3 to unlock still.

Great little game. I'm pleased to discover the controls are really well supported using a single Vive controller, tilting to manoeuvre works perfectly balanced and intuitive. I was soaring away in some tight spots but always felt in control, and it was only my misjudgement sent me into oblivion.

Can't fault this game for what it offers, it's fast, fun and the level design ramps up difficultly moderately each level. Nothing deep, just simple arcade fun.

Only one warning, this type of game can trigger motion sickeness. Being semi-prone to this depending on the game motion, I felt a little nausious after a few minutes and quit to fight another day.",1503755910,1503755910,True,5,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I don't think it is worth the full price on Steam (5 EUR). But for a bundle. Absolutely, go for it.

You are controlling a little plane with one of the Steam controllers. You can move more less only to left, right, up and down where you have to collect coins and get more fuel. Very simple. The whole screen moves forward, so take care if you have problems with nausea. With enough coins, you level up and you can get some new little planes. Easy but motivating. Graphics are decent and perfectly fine for VR (huge plain coloured blocks, not too many details).

I had fun for the short test and I think I will come back to it again.

RECOMMENDED in a bundle or on sale for half the price.

As you progress, you unlock other flying machines, including helicopters, drones, dragons, a harry potter style broom stick, back to the future style cars, etc.

It is a fun ""feel the sense of flying and things zooming past your head"" kinda game and it is a solid game. The levels have a nice design and good artwork nice audio and music too.

There are some levels I liked better than others. Some levels it's impossible not to earn platinum and live and others it is the opposite. Some you will blast through and others will proceedurally kill you with impossible situations. The city I found was the worst. Others were super amazing like volcano and caves. Pro tip: get the FUEL! 

Unlocking all the extras took longer than I thought. For example getting the Blitz mode required me to beat the regular mode. Blitz mode I didn't find that fun. Endless Mode was pretty fun as it is a bit more forgiving than regular but the speed gets much much faster!

I first heard of this game in relation to a competition to gain early access to Dimension Hunter - another game by Pocket Money - the stylized ""graphic novel"" looking shooter game -

I saw the rules of this competition - to post your furthest distance traveled in Endless Mode - seemed doable - so I got the game for a little over $5 -

What I didn't know was that in order to unlock Endless Mode, you have to kill 50 enemies in Blitz mode. 
To unlock Blitz mode, you have to have gold medals on all 40 levels - yes, 40 levels spread across 10 worlds. 

Worlds include:

Farm
Sea
Cave
City
Under Water
Volcano
Giant (toy room)
Space

sure i'm forgetting some -


In Wacky Wings, you control a little flying vehicle or creature as you navigate your way through linear courses set with different themes (see world list above) - you use an xbox controller or motion controller to move the avatar around, collecting coins and fuel. 

Interesting things about the game - 
excellent handling - motion controls work very well with wonderful haptics, you can 'feel' when your fuel runs out - more than a rumbling, more like a torque/twisting inside the controller. 

You can swap between thrird person and first person view during gameplay - first person is very very immersive - I did not get sick one bit, others may be more sensitive, not a problem for me.

Lots of different ""wings"" to choose from, including:
delorean from back to the future 
W-wing (like an x-wing from star wars)
Tardis from doctor who
person on a broomstick
dragon
propellor plane
helicopter
submarine


Mechanics of the game -
FUEL: you fly down the course, and you need fuel - if your fuel runs low, you begin to sink to the grown and will eventually crash, fuel appears as a pickup scattered along the course. Pick them up and you are fine. 

COINS: You collect coins for medals - to unlock higher modes and new wings --- and you collect coins for increased handling/manuverability - cool concept, makes you want to go out there and get those coins so that you can pull off some tight turns. 

Overall -- strongly recommended, a very fun game with lots of replay value. pretty immersive, soothing gameplay - can play forever. 

Oh - and I livestreamed my gameplay from pickup to putdown ( in two chunks) - first session was almost 4 hours of me standing, playing the game (you don't have to stand, I like to stand). Second session, I hit endless mode and made it to lvl 11. 

The game is very inexpensive, but I think is worth at least 3 times the price. Fun! More fun than other games of the same variety, fun for the whole family. 

Gets your pulse pounding when you are going for a long stretch in endless mode. 

Here is me unlocking everything and drilling down to lvl 11 in endless mode",1485736808,1485737539,True,11,0,0.575430095195770264,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My Thoughts:
A very cool racing game with an authentic arcade style vibe. If your new to the joys of VR this should be on your list to help you boost those VR legs (as they say). I translated 1 of the negative reviews and to be honest I didn't have a problem with any of the handling issues. it was fluid and responsive.
ALSO If the Dev's are reading this.. I would have loved a replay option.... sat in the vehicles!  ;)
