After the campaign there is the added bonus of blitz mode which is practically a new game itself. Set in WW2 in a vintage black and white atmosphere you must use new controls to shoot down enemy planes to gain fuel for as long as you can.

You're rewarded once again after blitz mode with the added bonus of endless mode (I love this one).

The graphics are limited to an old Atari style presentation, but with the modern flash and smooth animation of VR.  The simplicity of it has you flying fast automatically while you try and stay airborne by hitting fuel signs in a constantly depleted fuel situation, all the while avoiding collision with the obstacles in your path, and collecting coins all the while.  40 levels are passable with bronze and silver medals coming with ease, but gold medals require a large portion of coins being captured and you need all 40 gold in the 40 levels(10 sets of 4 common themed maps) in order to advance to the 2nd thrid of this game.  

The 2nd area is blitz mode, giving a black and white WWII style rainy night over london firefighting.  You must shoot down 40 planes, all the while collecting the fuel they leave behind when destroyed.  It took a while before I finally jumped all thw way to 59.  Before that I had reached 30 once followed by a heartbreaking 39 and then many more trys before I blasted on through this section.  

Finally comes endless mode, a short, fuel heavy replay of all the standard maps, connected indefinitely while you fly through the sun cycles of dawn to day to dusk to night and back to dawn again.  You hear the cheers that ended levels before but do not stop.  Actually you speed up just a tad with each segment of the sewed together endless stream and a nice arcade music track plays, speeding up in sync with the increase of your flight speed as you hold on and build up as much speed as you can surive past.  

Platinum medals are bonus skins for the many different flyers you unlock.  Besides comsmetic value there is one difference that really adds up over time and that is the tight quickness each new vehicle increases in handling.  This allows you to try tighter, more aggressive cuts and cross over manuevers.  I still have 3 to unlock still.

Great little game. I'm pleased to discover the controls are really well supported using a single Vive controller, tilting to manoeuvre works perfectly balanced and intuitive. I was soaring away in some tight spots but always felt in control, and it was only my misjudgement sent me into oblivion.

Can't fault this game for what it offers, it's fast, fun and the level design ramps up difficultly moderately each level. Nothing deep, just simple arcade fun.

I don't think it is worth the full price on Steam (5 EUR). But for a bundle. Absolutely, go for it.

You are controlling a little plane with one of the Steam controllers. You can move more less only to left, right, up and down where you have to collect coins and get more fuel. Very simple. The whole screen moves forward, so take care if you have problems with nausea. With enough coins, you level up and you can get some new little planes. Easy but motivating. Graphics are decent and perfectly fine for VR (huge plain coloured blocks, not too many details).

I had fun for the short test and I think I will come back to it again.

RECOMMENDED in a bundle or on sale for half the price.

起初我有点担心这游戏玩法单一，会不会不耐玩，没想到，一玩就上瘾了。虽然好玩的VR游戏并不少，但能够让我忍不住连着玩几天通关的VR游戏，目前只有几款，这是其中一款。

作为一款竞速VR游戏，我最看重的是这游戏支持VIVE控制器，几乎所有竞速类VR游戏都不支持VIVE控制器或者就算支持也很不理想。这游戏同时支持手柄和VIVE控制器，我个人更喜欢用控制器玩，操作手感甚至比手柄还好，而且沉浸感也要更好。看得出是一款为VIVE控制器而生的竞速游戏。

操作简单，你的控制器就是飞行器，只要操作一个控制器，但要掌握好并不容易，需要不断练习，没掌握好会觉得操作很不灵敏，但当你掌握技巧后，就会玩出乐趣了。可以先试玩demo，如果觉得自己能够掌握好，那么我强烈推荐这款游戏。

用控制器玩的沉浸感，是其他竞速游戏感受不到的，虽然是原地站立，但你还是会经常随着飞行器而动，有时甚至会站不稳，不是因为晕眩（我一点都不晕），而是你在操作中会不自觉地跟着飞行器转动，玩起来还会有心跳加速的感觉。玩其他VR游戏玩久了一般是体力消耗过大导致太累，玩这个玩久了是腿发麻。当然能坐着玩，但沉浸感还是站着玩更好。

游戏画风舒服，共10个场景，每个场景有4个关卡，关卡的障碍物是随机的，由于只要撞到任何东西就过关失败，经常失败几十次甚至上百次才过关，就算玩这么多次你都不会遇到完全相同的。不同的场景有不同的配乐和声效，烘托出各种类型的氛围，比如其中一个很阴暗的洞穴场景，在背景音乐的渲染下，竟然有点恐怖阴森的感觉，特别紧张刺激。

这40个关卡是收集金币和燃料模式，完成所有关卡并获得金牌后，会解锁一个空战模式，你的飞行器终于能够射击作战了。完成空战模式的任务后，会解锁无尽模式；游戏还有10个飞行器可以解锁；还能够切换成第一人称，第一人称相当于一个新体验。

我花了8个小时通关并获得所有金牌。就算经过了前面40个关卡的训练，还是觉得空战模式难度有点高，无尽模式暂时还没解锁。正好赶上开发商搞活动，在无尽模式排名前三的能够免费获得他们的另一个游戏，当然会继续挑战下去。

这个游戏证明，用VIVE控制器也能做出好的VR竞速游戏，就看开发商肯不肯动脑，不要想当然认为VIVE控制器天生不适合竞速游戏，顶多只是不适合传统竞速游戏而已，完全可以开发出全新风格竞速游戏。",1485862029,1485862029,True,5,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I first heard of this game in relation to a competition to gain early access to Dimension Hunter - another game by Pocket Money - the stylized ""graphic novel"" looking shooter game -

I saw the rules of this competition - to post your furthest distance traveled in Endless Mode - seemed doable - so I got the game for a little over $5 -

What I didn't know was that in order to unlock Endless Mode, you have to kill 50 enemies in Blitz mode. 
To unlock Blitz mode, you have to have gold medals on all 40 levels - yes, 40 levels spread across 10 worlds. 

Worlds include:

Farm
Sea
Cave
City
Under Water
Volcano
Giant (toy room)
Space

sure i'm forgetting some -


In Wacky Wings, you control a little flying vehicle or creature as you navigate your way through linear courses set with different themes (see world list above) - you use an xbox controller or motion controller to move the avatar around, collecting coins and fuel. 

Interesting things about the game - 
excellent handling - motion controls work very well with wonderful haptics, you can 'feel' when your fuel runs out - more than a rumbling, more like a torque/twisting inside the controller. 

You can swap between thrird person and first person view during gameplay - first person is very very immersive - I did not get sick one bit, others may be more sensitive, not a problem for me.

Lots of different ""wings"" to choose from, including:
delorean from back to the future 
W-wing (like an x-wing from star wars)
Tardis from doctor who
person on a broomstick
dragon
propellor plane
helicopter
submarine


Mechanics of the game -
FUEL: you fly down the course, and you need fuel - if your fuel runs low, you begin to sink to the grown and will eventually crash, fuel appears as a pickup scattered along the course. Pick them up and you are fine. 

COINS: You collect coins for medals - to unlock higher modes and new wings --- and you collect coins for increased handling/manuverability - cool concept, makes you want to go out there and get those coins so that you can pull off some tight turns. 

Overall -- strongly recommended, a very fun game with lots of replay value. pretty immersive, soothing gameplay - can play forever. 

Oh - and I livestreamed my gameplay from pickup to putdown ( in two chunks) - first session was almost 4 hours of me standing, playing the game (you don't have to stand, I like to stand). Second session, I hit endless mode and made it to lvl 11. 

The game is very inexpensive, but I think is worth at least 3 times the price. Fun! More fun than other games of the same variety, fun for the whole family. 

Gets your pulse pounding when you are going for a long stretch in endless mode.
