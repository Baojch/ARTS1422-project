It's a whopping 36 years old at the time of this review.  The game lacks support for any modern gaming display resolutions (or widescreen monitors), hasn't been modernised or updated to run smoothly on modern gaming PCs.  Despite this lack of modernisation, it carries a pretty high price tag for such an ancient game.  This seems to have been put on Steam as a nostalgia gouge, or just a cash grab to try profit from abandonware.

It's a sequel to ""Déjà Vu: MacVenture Series"" and suffers from all the same defects, lack of modernisation and so on.  Once more, gameplay is a matter of Zork style text adventuring, ""enhanced"" by the Apple Macintosh OS's ability to display multiple windows on the same desktop (wow, such technology, it really is the 1980's).  It was never a great game even for the Apple Mac, which never had great games anyway. 

This is the third of these nostalgia gouges I've had the misfortune to try playing today and I can confirm without any doubt that it really is just too old to be enjoyable.

On the upside, the game does feature customisable controls and resolution, so at least some of the basic, minimum requirements have been met.  Unfortunately there's a number of other technical defects and shortcomings which contribute to the game being difficult to recommend to gamers.

While there are options to change the resolution for the game, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the game, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.

The game interface is mostly just text boxes/dialogs and features mostly static, barely animated 2D images, the kind of thing you expect to see in browser/HTML games from the 1990s.  While that might be fine for the 1990s, gaming has evolved a lot since then, the ATI Rage became mainstream in 1996... it's 2024, and that kind of thing just won't fly anymore, it's just not visually up to scratch.

The implementation here is of such poor quality, the developer couldn't work out how to make the game display in fullscreen, it only runs in a window.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The game never really caught on with the millions of gamers on Steam, with a very low peak player count close to launch, and then just a handful of players launching this game every couple of days.  This is undoubtedly caused by factors such as those raised in this review.  It's always helpful with buying decisions to consider how popular and successful the product is, and unfortunately while this did accumulate a few participation trophy reviews, overall, people just aren't using it.

So, should you buy this game?

The Uninvited: MacVenture Series is relatively expensive for an abandonware nostalgia gouge, at $3 USD, and it's not worth it.  The game is just too old, hasn't been modernised.  And as the old saying goes, you can't go home again.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

Old-school adventure gamers will like the style and feel of this game, which has colour pixel graphics and barebones sound effects, as well as plenty of easter eggs to discover. But many of the puzzles are not set up very well, and you'll most likely need to refer to a guide on how to solve them. This is coming from someone who's solved many an adventure game (including the original Monkey Island) without hints. Some puzzles just leave you frustrated with how asinine they are (e.g. you have to [i]open[/i] a bottle in order to effectively use it on something), while others simply don't make sense (e.g. ferocious, hungry-looking dogs not wanting meat but instead [spoiler]being afraid of lightning[/spoiler]?!)

You can also die numerous times, simply because you do not have a particular inventory item on you when faced with a puzzle.

POSITIVES 

While the unusual and ahead-of-its-time user interface of the MacVenture games remains unchanged through all four games in the series, each game (that isn’t a sequel) adopts a different setting. In this case, Uninvited adopts a classic horror setting, complete with a haunted mansion, a skeleton key, various monsters, and even some spell casting. 

Unlike its predecessor, Uninvited requires considerably less (gun) violence to solve problems. Instead of shooting everything in sight, enemies are dealt with using specialized inventory items that can be found hidden in various hard-to-find or hard-to-open locations. There’s even a fair amount of treasures that are left behind by enemies, similar to D&D-style RPG games (even though this isn’t that type of game). 


NEGATIVES 

With this game, I feel as though the game designers leaned a little too heavily on an otherwise questionably-efficient method of navigation to the point where the limited realism created by the area pictures is further devalued. 

One of the more unusual interface components in the MacVenture game series is an exits diagram that depicts all of the potentially-available area exits as clickable boxes. In the previous game (Déjà Vu), this feature was an interesting and useful substitute for clicking on the exit objects in the main viewing window; however, in this game, use of the exits diagram becomes a necessity because half or more of the available exits aren’t even shown in the (too-small) viewing window because there’s no way to rotate the viewing perspective by turning. 

As a comparison, imagine you were playing a Myst-style CD-ROM game from the 1990s but you could NEVER turn to face the direction you needed to go. If that were to happen, you’d be left with an unsettling feeling that would cause you to distrust the images you see because they don’t provide you with all of the information you need to navigate. That’s how I felt about this game, simply because I was spending less time looking at the scenery and more time staring at the exits diagram. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 

Despite that criticism, I enjoyed exploring the Uninvited gameworld more than the Déjà Vu gameworld. Although it can be hard to figure out which objects will ward off a particular enemy (without a walkthrough), once you know what the objects are and where to get them, playing through this game is virtually risk-free. Well, except for the lighting storms in the IIgs version. If you’re playing the IIgs version, I highly recommend you always save the game before going outside. Unexpectedly dying is always a shocking experience, especially when its a shocking experience.",1656485361,1656485361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

They were a series of excruciatingly punishing point and click titles released throughout the mid-to-late 80's, with The Uninvited being the second in the line-up; coming out originally in 1986 for Mac, and 1988 for the IIGS, the two versions included in this Steam release. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Famicom, NES, and Windows 3.x were all completed between 1986 and 1993 as well. Needless to say, this was a game that got around.

In a time before elaborate cutscenes and thrilling plotlines, the MacVenture series relied on reading like an old, yellowed book. You know, the kind that has been sitting in an attic for a while, and therefore each turn of a page fills your nostrils with a very familiar musty smell. The text is intricate, and it serves as a compelling reminder and sustainable source that atmosphere can sometimes come purely from exceptional, immersive writing. The story itself is very basic, you play as an unnamed adventurer who is travelling with their brother. You see an object in the road, swerve to avoid it, and end up in a wreck. When you wake, your brother is nowhere to be found, but you spot an old Victorian mansion in the distance; he must be there, and thus you set out on your adventure.

The real challenge to this game is its hidden, unforgiving time limit that will brutally beat you down no matter how many save files you decide to make. This concealed mechanic only ticks down when you perform actions; whether that be using an item, opening a door, looking at objects, travelling to a different screen, or speaking. Every single action has the consequence of eating up precious time, and once all of the time has been used then the mansion possesses you and it's game over. New for its time and still cruel some 34 years later, the time limit mechanic forces the game into the corner of trial-and-error exploration, and may even reduce some people to pulling out old fashioned pen and paper to map their right and wrong interaction routes. The puzzles are easy enough to solve, as all of their solutions are found plainly somewhere in the game, but actually finding and using them before time depletes completely is the biggest obstacle, as there are so many elements that can be interacted with.

Despite its punishing nature, aged gameplay, cheesy sound effects, and lack of an actual soundtrack, The Uninvited manages to still hold up over three decades later. The atmosphere is truly compelling, propelled by Choose Your Own Adventure style graphics, and poetic storytelling; surprisingly, the black and white Macintosh version is actually offers more ambience than its color counterpart, so it's nice that it was included in this re-release. Although it doesn't look like much by today's standards, the game was actually praised for its innovative mouse-based gameplay, complex puzzles, and user-friendly interface back upon initial release. Of course, all of that, with exception of the puzzles, is now inordinately dated and those who were born closer to the turn of the century will probably not find much novelty in going back and attempting to solve the mystery of the mansion. In essence, that's really what these re-releases are at this point; a novelty, whether it be for nostalgia, or for the sake of saying that you played it.

Additional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library

TLDR: Dialog window gets cropped. UI is dated and relies on an old OS to give engine to adventure. Try Kingsway instead for same idea in an RPG format.

Walk clickers are arguably the more primitive version of doing adventure games compared to classic point and click. Even walking simulators have the potential to be more fluid with their freeform environment navigation.

The stiff scripting required for progression, along with the insta-death pitfalls peppered all over hurt the experience.

The writing looked decent and the presentation was good for the time period.

The game has no audio either which further lowers the entertainment value.

This is utlimately a notalgia piece, or a museum exhibit of gaming era that has gone by. I prefer to archive the Macventure titles in my hidden library to give better visibility to more entertaining and better executed modern adventure games. The idea to open a browser window to see items when you for example open a container is a nice idea but better executed in kingsway.

Not wanting to be a philistine, I thought I should play the ""older""-looking of the two; and besides, if I ever replayed the game, I'd ""upgrade"" to the colour version then. So the Mac version it was.

   Er...until I realised that blowing the Mac version up to full-screen didn't quite format correctly, cutting off some of the letters at the end of each line. Now, I'm sure there was probably some easy fix for this, but being a lazy, technologically-impaired kinda doofus, I just opted to immediately try the Apple version. Bingo! Looks good. Colour it is, then.

   The UI is a bit confusing at first, with an awful lot of options presented, so I figured the best thing to do straight off the bat was experiment. Oh, look...what does this ""self"" button do, then? Erm, not much it seems, until I then press ""speak"" on a similarly impulsive whim, and voila! A new box appears on-screen, containing the words ""What do you wish to say to yourself?"" 

   Now, the human mind is a prickly thing, positively bristling with thorns. Being asked a question like this is like gazing into the abyss itself; and being requested to acknowledge one's innermost self so unflinchingly is a task fraught with no end of existential peril. My fingers poise hesitantly above the keys, genuinely afraid for what they might have to say about me; the TRUE ME, the one which I keep hidden, even from myself. Somehow, I find the courage, and tentatively, I begin to type:

   ""You are a worthless cunt.""

   Instantly, a reply pops up in the main text window:

   ""What would Freud have to say about that?""

   Gotta say, I'm instantly impressed, especially for a game from the mid-80s. Didn't think they'd even invented that word way back then. Ooh, I am so deliciously naughty. My Mum would be ashamed, to say the least.

   Fortunately, all shenanigans and early explorations aside, the game as a whole proved to be quite impressive ""for its time"" also. For starters, the writing itself is rather nice and borderline poetic at times: e.g. ""you pry yourself free of the steering wheel's embrace"". An impressive quality, especially in this era where eight out of ten horror games are made by Europeans whose idea of ""speaking English"" is employing the talents of Google Translate.

   Secondly, the way you interact with objects by first choosing an instruction like ""examine"" or ""open"", then clicking the part of the image which you wish to perform said task upon, was simple but effective; and the minimal size and non-photorealistic detail of each image further made this game a little ""easier"" than those dang-blasted MODERN point-and-click adventures, in which you have to spam virtually every inch of the screen with clicks to find each and every detail that you're missing. 

   Perhaps my problem is that I never really played these games when I was a kid in the 80s, and haven't thereby steadily ""evolved"" with this style of game design to be good-and-ready for the more sophisticated modern equivalents. Damn all those youthful hours spent playing Asteroids and Moon Patrol!

   Inventory. Have you ever, like myself, wondered just how your Silent Hill or Resident Evil character just somehow KNOWS, in a room full of potentially desirable objects, which one or two items to pick up; somehow psychic about which item will come in handy later on? No need to puzzle over that one any longer, 'cause for better or worse, this game lets you pick up almost EVERYTHING in sight! So it's not nearly as obvious which items you may need to solve a particular puzzle. Shock-horror, you may even have to work things out a bit for yourself (yeah, okay, so I'm not sure this is an entirely ""positive"" thing, especially for dumb-dumbs like myself...but it's a praise-worthy premise just the same)!

   Sound. Ah, yes. Cheesy, but charming. Simplistic, not-exactly-convincing simulations of thunder, breaking glass, punching and so forth. And when you die, you get an image of a skull and the words ""I've got you!"", the aural uttering of which sounds for all the world like Stephen Hawking reimagined as an evil undead sorceror. There is, however, a regrettable lack of creaking doors and wooden floorboards; but hey, you can't have everything I suppose.

   Now for something I definitely DIDN'T like: the time limit. Throughout the game, there are ominous allusions to a storm getting closer, and a generalised ""evil"" slowly closing in. And sure enough, if you don't finish the game quickly enough, it's boo-sucks for you. I had to Google this lovely little feature to make sure it wasn't something I specifically did wrong. Nope, it's just a slowly encroaching, inexorable thing, best as I can tell. So in other words, unless you're especially brilliant at these types of games, you probably won't get through it the first time, or even the TENTH time; and will in all probability give up long before reaching the end just like I did.

   For the time that I humoured it, though, I actually quite enjoyed this. It was like revisiting a childhood I never quite had, and almost made me yearn for ""simpler"" days. Definitely not a game for the A.D.D. generation (of which I am only an honorary member, thank God, but an honorary member just the same).

分别是:
恐怖鬼屋题材的“Uninvited”
类似黑色电影，以侦探故事为主题的“Déjà Vu”
和14年出了个美工超棒，难度最高的奇幻冒险“Shadowgate”

和现在的点击式解迷的不同在于，游戏中玩家多数行为并非只要简单的寻找调查点
相反画面右框里会把每个房间的可互动点标出，玩家多数情况下点击右边快捷栏即可前进
开发者把难度集中在了互动上：玩家需要对物品，机关等物件进行正确的行为
打击、开启、观察这些行为系统是不会帮你自动完成的，只有结合文字描述来判断如何处理
另一个难点就是遍布整个流程的死亡了，甚至在同一场景逗留太久都会触发BAD END

虽然我们现在总喜欢吐槽某些游戏年货化，互相抄袭吃老本
但其实过去在业界这种现象就已经是很常见了，尤其是混乱的发展初期更是什么好卖抄什么
于是为了保持新鲜度，开发者在当时的方法除了将同一玩法的游戏题材多样外，文字描述上也下了功夫
你可以看到游戏过程中调查物品，移动，观察都有详细的环境描写
从某种程度上，这种方式只要和画面配合得好，甚至比如今许多逼真的3A级大作更有代入感

uninvited是一款以鬼屋冒险为背景的老苹果机器上运行的游戏，看介绍和视频貌似挺符合我的胃口，但是在通关了2个版本以后我不得不说这款真的很差劲。
说实话我很少给老游戏一个差评，下面列出为什么这么评价的原因：
1，解密游戏我不反对给出一些高难度的谜题，但是完全脱离逻辑范畴的谜题实在是让人无法容忍，打个比方，我要得到某条信息需要获得一本日记，为了获得这本日记我需要赶走一个幽灵，为了召唤这个幽灵我必须对一盏台灯进行“使用”命令，而为了吓唬这个幽灵我又得去抓蜘蛛，为了抓蜘蛛我必须要上2楼的储物间去找一瓶粘着剂。。。
其他谜题更是脑洞大开而且提示几乎没有。实在不知道这种完全无厘头式的解密方式哪里吸引人了。
2，可以互动可以拿的东西太多，但是实际能用上的很少，我可以说这个游戏里面90%可以拿的东西都对实际游戏没有任何用处。然而配合无厘头的解密，要想在没有攻略的前提下拿到正确的物品几乎是天方夜谈，更别说还要在正确的时间使用在正确的目标上面了。。。
3，流程很短。

[i]a spoiler free review[/i]

[b]Rating: Recommended[/b]


Some games give you what you pay for. Others disappoint, leaving you with an empty wallet and an unstimulated mind. And sometimes, once in a very great while, you get far more than what you pay for. [b]Uninvited[/b] isn’t the greatest game ever designed, but for a non-sale price of $2.99, it delivers. For all you classic Mac gamers out there, you might have even heard of this game or its series. 

[b]– Now in Color! –[/b]
The original Uninvited was released for Mac in 1986; several ports to other consoles and OS soon followed. A neat feature of this package is the newer, color version of the Apple IIGS Port; I suggest playing this one, at least for your first playthrough or two. After you’ve got a handle on what’s going on, I encourage you to try the original; it’s in greyscale, but the effect is more unnerving when you get to the scary parts (also, sound effects are cooler in the original).

[b]– A True Classic –[/b]
[u]Uninvited[/u] is an early adventure game that helped shape the face of modern adventure games, a “Missing Link” in the transition from fully text-based to modern character control and exploration. Every object has a unique description and some smaller ones can be moved or picked up. This is a critical element of the game; items you find early on may be needed later on down the road.

[b]– Story –[/b]
The general backstory is that you and your kid brother have crashed your car outside of a large, spooky mansion. As you rush to get out of your car, it explodes, leaving you stranded. Your brother is nowhere to be found; you must search for him on the estate grounds and in the mansion. Demonic forces are running loose – danger is everywhere. Save frequently; this game has numerous instant-death situations. And don’t dawdle. There’s a counter of how many actions you can perform (including moving stuff and examining objects) before your body is possessed and you lose.

[b]– Difficult? –[/b]
I really liked this game, but, as with all adventure games from the eighties, it is nearly impossible at some points. If you get [i]really[/i] stuck, Google search “Kiran S. Kedlaya Uninvited Walkthrough”. Should be on AtariArchives.

[b]– What I Liked/Disliked –[/b]
This game is funny if you have a macabre sense of humor. There are numerous ways to kill yourself that are quite amusing; oftentimes you won’t realize it until it’s too late. Then you debate whether to get angry that you have to replay the last five or more minutes or laugh at how idiotic your character really is. The object descriptions are all very humorous in a condescending manner, further solidifying your subconscious theory that the protagonist is an idiot.

This game is really, [i]really[/i] tough. There’s a ton of backtracking, loads of insta-death situations, seemingly useless objects are actually essential while others that look promising are just red herrings, lots of annoying thunder SFX scripted sequences that slow you down while exploring and, to top it all off, a “time limit” that kills you if you don’t figure out what’s going on in time. Aside from difficulty and annoying thunder, though, there’s really nothing to complain about in this game; it’s a fun, cheap brainteaser.

[b]– The Price is Right! –[/b]
This game is only $2.99 [i]off[/i]sale. If it goes on sale (especially under  $1), you have no excuse not to buy it. It’s very worth it. Also, there are Steam trading cards, if you’re into that.
