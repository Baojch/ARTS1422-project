My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707155618,1707155618,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Arevan is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

This time Andorlea/Warfare/SimProse/whatever other shell account this guy uses to try hide his identity has once more stamped out a painfully generic copy + paste RPG Maker asset flip.  This time we're investigating a murder in one of the most incredibly, painfully generic fantasy settings imaginable.  If RPG Maker had generic plots, the developer here would rip those off, too.  It's horribly basic, riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, full of stock copy + pasted RPG Maker assets... no real game development has taken place here, this is just a cash grab, it's shovelware polluting Steam for profit.  This ""developer"" has dumped over 100 copy+pasted RPG Maker asset flips onto Steam, and keeps pumping out minimum viable product RPG Maker asset flips as rapidly as possible to try gouge gamers.

We must ask why this ongoing pollution has any serious value for gamers or the gaming industry.  This kind of cash grab construction kit shovelware from bad actors like Andorlea gives amateur developers a bad name.  This pollution takes marketing space away from genuine indie developers who are doing the right thing, and making real games instead of copying+pasting premade assets in a children's video game construction kit.  It makes it harder for gamers to find genuinely made games.  This pollution is harmful to Steam, to gamers and the gaming industry.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Arevan has the laughable, eye-watering price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

首先就剧情而言，试图通过宏大的世界观设定来吸引玩家，然而故事叙述的方式显得单调且拖沓。主线任务线索混乱不清，支线任务又大多流于形式，缺乏深度和吸引力，导致整个游戏流程在推进中缺乏张力和惊喜。角色间的对话冗长而空洞，使得角色塑造苍白无力，难以引起玩家的情感共鸣。

其次在游戏性方面，沿袭了早期RPG的回合制战斗系统，这本应是其特色之一，但在具体实现上却显得颇为落后。战斗节奏慢，战术策略的选择空间有限，敌人AI设计简单，战斗过程重复枯燥。同时地图设计过于线性和繁琐，探索的乐趣大打折扣，而装备、技能树等方面的成长系统也显得单一，缺乏足够的激励机制。

再者游戏的画面和音效并不能与其宣称的“复古”二字相匹配。尽管怀旧风格是可以接受的，但是《Arevan》的视觉呈现过于粗糙，角色模型和场景贴图的细节处理明显不足，动画效果僵硬，背景音乐和音效的质量也相对较低，听觉体验并不愉悦。

最后游戏还存在一定的技术问题，包括偶发的bug、卡顿现象以及不稳定的性能表现，这些问题无疑进一步影响了玩家的整体体验。

综上所述，虽有致敬经典的意图，但在实际的执行过程中，无论是叙事手法、游戏机制、视听体验还是软件优化方面都未能展现出足够竞争力。对于喜爱RPG游戏的玩家来说，可能更多感受到的是失望而非怀旧之情。希望开发者能够在未来的作品中，真正吸取经验教训，不仅继承传统RPG的优点，更要努力突破现有局限，打造更为优质的游戏体验。",1661009623,1711799456,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The problem is...  this game has an absolutely wonderful story and battle system.  I can easily rejoice in those aspects of this.

The problem is, that this game for some reason as Windows OS has updated over the 7+ years that this game has been made, that one of them screwed with how this game operates.  Meaning that if you play it nowadays there's an unbelievable amount of LAG.  It is visibly jarring how bad it is in this game.  But I had this on my list of stuff I needed to complete, and I did.  

It's just a shame since if it wasn't for the lag this game would easily score a personal 9.5/10.  The game's story is THAT good.  Sure the first act is a little disorienting (I went to the second kingdom first and wasn't able to get the party member there yet), but by the end this game is FUN.  With lots of twists and turns.

TLDR: Kiddish plot with immature themes. Pixelated. Variety of other technical issues. See full review for details.

Oustanding Issues:
-Pixelated mess
-Maps were made to look great zoomed out in the editor but with the limited FOV of the actual game it is constricted, and it just feels like endless swathes of empty barren RPGMaker land
-Audio assets are repetitive, limited, and low quality
-Plot seems aimed at young boys age 8-12. With a generic blonde student protagonist bickering with schoolmate
-Engine is unacceptably choppy and janky, cursor transition is not smooth, walk animation feels broken, text display feels lagged out and ponderous
-Most of the assets are uninteractable, and most NPCS are filler NPCS with one generic uninteresting line about their immediate surroundings or a vague line about the world setting
-Game has no early plot hook, no obvious way forward, letting you roam and waste time, not even a clear place to go to for combat or recruitment
-Not too thrilled by the very stock asset feeling and low quality of all the visuals
-The mouse only limitation felt artificial and not very ergonomic or intuitive",1503467636,1510161413,False,0,0,0.498420834541320801,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Full review can be found here: http://www.the-backlog.net/arevan-the-bitter-truth-review/

This review is based off a copy provided by the publisher.

Arevan will send you through a lot of twists and turns. Unfortunately, they’re fairly predictable. The game is also not overly long for an RPG, with my playthrough clocking in at 14 hours. A good chunk of that 14 hours turned into unneeded grinding and some idling time while I did other things. So really, for your money you’re getting an around 10 hour adventure.

Leveling in Arevan is a bit of a hit-or-miss thing. On one hand, a system exists so that you never actually have to FIGHT any bosses in the game. On the other hand, leveling up enough to be able to pull through these bosses offers some great rewards. And yes, you read that right – you don’t actually have to fight the bosses in this game. Should you die, you can choose to just continue on or try again. Choosing to continue on will automatically kill the boss, and in the cases of storyline ones, continue on in the story.

Arevan provides no in-game world map, and you’ll likely also end up hard pressed to try and find one online. And, of course, it ends up becoming very easy to get lost on said world map. Luckily, the game has a system of usable runes that let you quick travel to cities. While you have to actually find the NPCs that sell them, these prove to be a very handy to have around.

Arevan’s combat is a turn-based system. You’ll input everyone’s commands, and then based on the speed of you and the enemies, actions will happen in that order. If you know which character will go first (PS: It’s probably Pascal), you can manipulate to do certain actions at certain times. This can prove useful for landing those status effects as well. And luckily, you can scan every enemy in-battle by use of the shift key (or on controllers, at least on mine, the A button). It will be a bit confusing at first what each symbol means and what the colours mean, but you’ll eventually get the hang of it. If you see red though, use that and try and land the statuses that show as red. Just do it.

The biggest issue in Arevan is, by far, the sheer amount of spelling and grammar mistakes. From simple things such as words missing a letter to flat out spelling mistakes. I don’t know about you, but knowing I have a ]man and he’s being hemself heading intodungeons doesn’t leave that great of an impression. Sometimes the issues will be in every other line, sometimes they’ll just vanish completely for a bit. The game could use a good, thorough proof reading by a few people to try and clean up some of these mistakes.

I also had issue with how the quest log was handled. Sometimes it was really clear on what I should do, other times not so much. Near the end, I got extremely lost on where to go until I finally stumbled upon something after over an hour of searching. In that time, I had done practically everything else I could do then. I’d done all the little side dungeons to make the last boss easier, I’d rescued a mermaid, and I’d helped some selfish treasure hunter find his secret dungeon. Of course, little did I know what doing all those side dungeons to make the last boss “easier” actually meant. I won’t spoil it, but needless to say I was left extremely unsatisfied at the end.

So, like most RPGMaker games, Arevan is not for everyone. You’ll need to deal with a gigantic amount of spelling issues and general getting lost. Luckily, I found the combat system and general story – minus the spelling/grammar issues – quite good. I also enjoyed the music and sound effects, even if some of them were things that were stock with RPGMaker instead of original. Overall, I would suggest the game, but only to folks who are fans of RPGMaker titles. If you’re looking for some big, fancy, 3D title, you’d best look elsewhere.",1439076398,1578028827,False,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,False,True,False,False,,,

A well told and deep story, a mix of fun puzzles, and a different system of skill acquisitions give this game a different sort of feeling that is interesting, involving, and keeps you constantly alert as to exactly what is going on.

As with all rpgs the story is important and fundamental to keeping the player interested enough to move forward. And this game has that quality that begins with the young prince of Arevan (Maurean) being called on by his father to find out what exactly is going on with a series of murders in Arevan and surrounding kingdoms. And so Maurean sets out to recruit his party and explore the world to solve the mystery.
And a great thing with this game is that each location gets better and more complex ---- the action intensifies, and this gives you that ""one more scene, one more battle"" feeling. Plus, there are a ton of side quests that will keep you very busy.

Skills are learned not by leveling, but, instead, by consuming ""skill pills"" which can be bought, found, stolen, or by defeating foes throughout the world. And there are an abundance of these pills. It is up to the player to determine when and how and by who these skills should be used. Of course this adds to the fun of determining how to move forward in the game ---- there are multiple ways to strategize, which adds a lot to the replay value.

I thought the art was fine, especially the unique monsters.

And the music is a very big positive, with different tracks everywhere that I've never heard anything similar to before.

So don't let the first easy maze/dungeon fool you ---- it will get more challenging and involving as you move forward with lots of ""a-ha"" moments that add to the great fun of the game.

I think it's a great addition to any library of these 16-bit style rpgs.
