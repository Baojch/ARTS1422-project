The number of options in the game will blow you away. The ability to tailor the game to your liking is completely unrivalled in the genre. I don't even know how to begin listing the number of things that have surprised me so far.

Do you prefer playing 2D overhead pool or 3D perspective based? Doesn't matter... this game does both. Prefer to play EU pool on a 6ft table with smaller balls over a 7ft table with standard snooker size balls... no problem, two clicks and you're good to go. Wanna go crazy and play 9 ball on a 10ft table with giant balls? Easy. Don't like the look of the balls, no worries, here's another bunch to choose from. Worried about having to set everything up switching between US and EU styles of pool? Well don't worry because the two option sets are separated from each other. Fancy a game of snooker... no problem! Fancy a silly game of snooker on a tiny 8ft table with big balls? Done! Wanna play with a group of friends in the same rule, go ahead! Oh, your friend in 600 miles away in another country just bought the game? Go ahead and play him too... the list just goes on and on and on...

That's without even mentioning the ability to tailor the rules to your liking. Without any learning curve I managed to change the default EU 2-shots rule to be more in line with the current International ruleset.

The only thing missing is the ability to place the ball anywhere on the table after a foul so I asked for it to be added in the community discussions section. Based on what I've seen looking through other posts I'd expect this option to be added by the end of next week!

Which leads me on to the developers...

Just WOW! They respond to their players like no other developer I've ever seen. In one of the most recent 5 posts at the time of looking I saw a guy mentioning a rule he uses in the pub with his friends when playing Killer (an obscure mode also available in this game!) where potting the black ball gives an extra life. The developer agreed it was cool and 4 days later it was patched into the game. Not only that, but the AI was even tuned to prioritise the black ball when possible!!! I've never seen anything like that in my 30 years+ playing computer games.",1710268995,1710268995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The first thing to mention is the incredible amount of options. Cue's, ballsize, ball-make up, which kind of pockets you want, Size and speed of the table and that just the start. You can make it as hard or as easy as you want it, with no help-lines at all or extensive help and anything inbetween. Switch between 2d & 3d at will, save shots to try again in practice mode, set the number of games to win a tournament at each level, etc etc... .
 
Besides that, it offers a wealth of games, from different kinds of snooker to all kinds of poolgames. As if that wasn't enough, if you feel, like I did that I  made it myself too easy with help-lines and wished I could start again, you can. It let's you do  away with all the steam-achievements (or just the ones you want), so you start at absolute zero.

I'm pretty sure I  listed only half of the options, but it all would mean nothing, if it didn't feel like playing pool or snooker and fortunately, it does. If you like snooker or pool (in my view those 2 are a world apart), get this, recommended at any price.",1707991053,1707991166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The developers of this game are a real credit to the industry in general, every single time there is a concern or tweak the playerbase wants, these guys are there in the forums and take it all onboard and sometimes within hours there will be an update tuning the game and making minor adjustments, ive witnessed this multiple times and im honestly blown away they care as much as they do for a game that obviously is years old now and likely does not continue to sell much at this point, just within a few days of me writing this review ive seen a guy mention in the forums that the killer rules should be updated to reflect uk rules and within hours it was updated, then they updated the sound in a general update to improve ball on ball contact sounds and it seemed a little loud, I mentioned it in the forums and its updated hours later again with improvements, i don't know what more players could ask for from the developers. Updates still drop monthly. Compare that to VP4 which was last updated... what, 2 years ago now, its a different mentality and attitude towards their game entirely.

Visually it looks good but more importantly it performs great, not many games i can play on my steam deck at 4w with 12 hours battery life and 90fps, but this is one of them. Sound wise its fine, there could be more music choice but it is what it is, balls click and clack as expected.

Gameplay wise its very good if not quite perfect (yet), lots of options, different table sizes, different cloths, different balls, different games to play from snooker and pool to variations, 9 ball, 8 ball, killer the list goes on... its missing a career though, some kind of in depth career would be icing on the cake but i suspect that may be too much to ask considering the age of the game right, they would just call it cue club 3 at that point and make more money and im fine with that and i would pay for it.

The ball physics them self are a sticky point for me and many others, they are like 95 percent where they should be but at times you don't get the action you would expect on the cue ball or the speed/weight of the balls seems off, i mean they have options for the speed of everything, cloth speed, ball speed, friction etc etc, the options are endless but you never quite land on what you think feels right, like slow seems too slow but normal feels a bit heavy and there's no in between, so maybe a slider with more minute adjustments would be good but then it becomes a question of why do i need to make the physics feel right when they could do it for me, but i really cant blame the developers, it just feels like it might not ever get there for feel when compared to VP4 perhaps from a limitation of the game engine. Controls can also feel a little off, you either hit the balls too hard or sometimes not hard enough as you try to tame the power and again there are so many options to make adjustments its difficult to know what settings you need for it to feel just perfect (especially on steam deck using track pads). Its like so close but that 5 percent that feels wonky is almost enough to put you off the game while VP4 is just about perfect in how the balls roll and react but the game around it is dead and lifeless in comparison to CC2.

Honestly its hard not to recommend this game, difficult to criticise knowing the love they clearly still have for it. I think there is a really really solid game of pool/snooker here and i cant give the developers enough credit for their attitude towards the game and i hope they have done well enough to start crafting a cue club 3 with a serious career mode and they will have something special in this sport as far as videogames go.",1707424621,1707424621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

- Physics is good because I don't have a high demand for it to be as accurate as in real life.

Cons: (These things are minor anyway)
- Menu design somehow is still not well arranged.
- In games vs AI, there is always a notifying panel appearing to inform that cue ball control is passed to the opponent. I accidentally clicked it twice during that panel and the AI was somehow stuck and not made a move. 
=> This should be fixed by replacing with a notification that even AI and I cannot interact. Just a notification and automatic changing turn. That's all.",1704904017,1704904017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's a pretty good recreation of the games.  Ball physics seem good, there are all the expected variants of Pool (6, 7, 9 and 10 ball as well as the standard 8-Ball version that every pool table in a pub in the UK has the rules for on a poster).  Snooker also has 10 red and 6 red versions for shorter matches than the proper 15 red version.  

There's some challenge in working your way up through the AIs (15 somewhat distinct AIs, each at 5 different skill levels).  At times the top level AIs will pull off ridiculous shots, but I can't complain too much since very often my tactic is hit the target ball as hard as possible and hope it goes in off five cushions.  There are then extra achievements to try to win four-round tournaments, so there's stuff to keep you playing.

The devs are also active, still releasing updates on a regular schedule and addressing bug reports in the forums.  And there's no subscription or pay-to-win cues for sale in a cash shop.

I got this game probably a couple of years ago now, and I still play regularly.  No complaints here.",1703619158,1703619158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'm glad I made the right choice. The game does exactly what a good pool/snooker game should do, offering a lot of options. I've already played two games and I already LOVE IT. I can't wait to play online with other human players in the multiplayer mode.

I highly recommend it!!!!!

Update: The developer pushed out another new update on 16/11/23 with even more gameplay options, which are amazing and perfect for playing multiplayer on the same machine, allowing the ability to set different skill levels for each player.

这一作的气氛就缓和很多，有轻快的音乐，除了比较正式的竞标赛还有以酒吧为背景的，然后也有辅助瞄准，就感觉轻快了很多，而且加入了3D模式，这是一个大进步，最难能可贵的是还在一直更新，虽然都是点小调整，但是至少证明作者还在努力改善

那么接下来我来说说Steam上几个我玩过而且比较好的台球游戏各自的优劣

· 首先是这款，手感比较经典，内容丰富性适中，没有乱七八糟的内购，买断制，买了就能舒舒服服地玩；而且有比较完善的练习模式，你可以自己去摆每一颗球的位置，你甚至可以手动摆一个残局出来然后想办法去解
缺点的话，线上基本上没有人，可能其它优秀的作品比较多所以没人玩这个吧，还有就是那个3D模式的效果还可以继续优化，现在看着还是有点怪怪的但是说不上来，它本质上还是用本来的2D模式魔改的，我感觉比较明显的一个问题就是球进袋的时候那个物理效果不太自然

· 台球2D/3D (Poolians)
这款我是最看不起的，有人会说啊这个游戏不是免费吗，体积又小，很好上手，呵呵，那个免费是骗人的，只是免费试玩，你玩到一定时长之后就要你开会员才让你继续玩了，好，问题就在这，你要是买断的会员我也不说什么，我靠，每一种球的玩法是独立计费的，也不永久，一年的费用比我能在Steam找到的任何一款台球游戏都高，我不知道他怎么敢的，就凭这一点我妥妥的差评没商量，就这么低配的东西他怎么好意思搞这么贵，这么好赚？
但是也要说说人家好的地方，如果你不是想深入钻研台球的，只是跟朋友打个乐呵的，那这个确实可以，毕竟可以免费玩蛮长一段时间，只是闲着没事打一把不会打到那个时长，而且体量小，下载快，不占空间不吃配置，2D3D模式都有，娱乐玩家玩2D有辅助线，硬核玩家玩3D，完全没有辅助线只能靠自己手感，纯纯的比技术，8球9球斯诺克都有，但是不开会员只能玩8球和斯诺克，而且时长有限（怨念），最重要的是线上玩家理论上来说是最多的，8球大厅不管什么时候都有一大半球桌是有人在玩的
缺点么，它没有练习模式，跟人机对打还是只能去球桌上等人的时候，所以就导致你没办法一个人安安静静地练，你上桌了就一定会中途有人来找你，还有就是它摆自由球的时候你摆下去就不能改位置了，照理只要不击球我还是可以调整位置的
它但凡不把收费模式搞得吃相那么难看它都是一个比较优秀的游戏了

· Pool Nation
这玩意有好几个版本，其中那个LITE的版本是免费的
优点是这玩意是这几款台球游戏里面把物理效果玩得最花的，甚至应该说花式台球占了这款游戏很大一部分内容，加塞、弧线球、跳球什么的各种都有，还有专门让你打花式台球的地方，还有每日挑战啊、精彩击球存档&回放，有时候打出一些比较极限或者比较好的击球还会有慢镜头特写，你想正经打也可以，想打花式的也可以，任君自选；然后还有些自定义装扮，像球杆啊、桌布啊、球啊、胜利结算动画等等都可以用游戏内货币买；有辅助线而且有5种可以自己选择，觉得自己比较菜的跟朋友打着玩的，开最长的那种瞄着打，要真实体验的，就关掉；默认是3D视角，但是也可以开上帝视角当2D游戏打
缺点，首先那个机翻中文是真的受不了，我看英语都能看得更明白一点，那个机翻中文给我整傻了都；然后那些装扮什么的说实话太花哨了，而且有一堆内购，你玩免费的版本是阉割版，完整的版本你要加购各种DLC，不过也有一部分是可以用游戏内货币买的，这是好的；还有一点就是它是我玩下来这几个游戏里面最容易崩的，它是虚幻引擎，但是同时这也导致了它画质其实是比较不错的

Have you tried clicking the middle mouse button immediately after the shot is played? Similarly, on a game controller use the left shoulder button. This pulls the camera back further so you can see more of the table action. Also, you can use left and right mouse movement to rotate or pan the camera following a shot (game controller right stick).

In the menu at 'Options > Cameras' make sure you set the the option 'Action Camera (All Players)' to 'Auto Tracking  + Rotation'. This is the default setting and supports the above features.

Pamiętam jak kiedyś się grało w Cue Club (wówczas pod nazwą Trickshot) i widząc teraz Cue Club 2 zdecydowałem się to natychmiast wziąć.
Nie ma czego żałować. Fajnie widzieć gdy znacznie przewyższa swojego poprzednika - pod kątem dostępnych gier (swoją drogą dodałoby się też ""piętnastkę"" lub 14+1) czy oglądania swojego dłuższego brejka w snookerze.

Być może przesadzę ze swoją rozpiską, ale nie ukrywam że trochę przydałoby się do Cue Club 2 kilka innych opcji, głównie dotyczących rozgrywania turnieju, np.:
1. ""Trochę"" więcej profili przeciwników (kolejnych 8-16), co miałoby nieco większy wpływ na losowość graczy;
2. Zarządzanie formatem turnieju - 8, 16 lub 32 graczy + ewentualna faza grupowa obok drabinki;
3. Samodzielny wybór przeciwników do turnieju (jak choćby w Killer Pool);

Oczywiście nadal gra mnie cieszy i co jakiś czas się włącza którąś z gier - nawet offline.

==================================================

EN:
I remember when I played Cue Club (known as Trickshot) and when I saw Cue Club 2 I decided just to buy it.
Nothing to regret. It's really good to see when it's beating its predessor - about some available games (I would include also 15-ball or 14.1) or watching our long break in snooker.
I'll probably risk too much about writing this, but nothing to hide I prefer to see some other options in this game, mainly about Tournament mode - for example:
1. ""A little bit"" more A.I. player profiles (another 8-16);
2. Tournament management, about selecting 8, 16 or 32 players + group stage alongside traditional ladder;
3. Manual selecting A.I. players for tournament (similarly to Killer Pool);

Using Steam's remote play option mitigates this if your internet connection and hardware is decent enough to deal with the the stream and the turn-based nature of play means this works pretty well as an alternative if you like to see you opponent (if a Steam friend) play in something closer to real time.

The online lobby has seemed pretty quiet the times we've played so it's probably best to set up a game beforehand with someone if the online play is something you'd like to focus on. 

If solo, there's still loads of game modes and plenty of customisation options to keep you occupied.

It's an issue I've seen other games like Pure Pool also struggle with from the discussions I've seen on Steam. This game didn't even have to be told what resolution I was running (2560 x 1080). It just did it from first launch with no glitches. But this widescreen awesomeness was just the beginning!

I LOVE the way the camera works and setting shots up is such an intuitive joy. The tables, balls, cues and scenery all look amazing and one of the things that comes across straight away is how much attention they've put into making all the elements feel right. The cushions repel the balls exactly as you'd expect and the sound is spot on too. The balls themselves roll perfectly and somehow you can tell their weight and how much energy they have from their motion and the sound they make when they strike other objects.

Pros:
* Graphics are good enough and just ok amount of light/effects etc. not to ruin visuals but look good.
* A lot settings, different game modes, rules, etc.
* AI players are good enough, so this is fun to play without multiplayer too
Cons:
* No real career mode feeling, even when Bar games and Tournament modes are a bit like quarter of that
* No player characters really visible anywhere, just non-animated drawn artwork for AI players
* Even when there is multiple settings for rules etc., still missing a lot rules that people seem to use in non official games

Default settings make game a bit too easy probably for anyone who are not totally new to snooker/pool, but there is a lot different settings that makes game difficulty and feel more like what you feel when playing in real life.

[h1]Avis personnel :[/h1]

Après avoir essayé de nombreux jeux de billards, et de moins nombreux jeux de snooker, variante du billard que je joue principalement, Cue Club 2 est le 2ème jeu que je trouve bien réalisé, le 1er étant celui qui m'aura fait découvert la discipline il y a une quinzaine d'années sur PS2. 

De nombreuses variantes sont proposées et les ayant toutes testées, je peux vous annoncer qu'il y a pas mal de façons de s'amuser ou d'améliorer son style de jeu. J'apprécie tout particulièrement le snooker comme vous l'aurez sans doute deviné. Si vous décidez de jouer contre l'IA je peux vous confirmer que tous les niveaux de ce dernier avant le ""Professionnel"" sont très mal gérés, l'IA faisant des coups qui n'ont aucun sens, et qui auront pour conséquence de vous faire aisément gagner la partie. En revanche en Professionnel, l'IA est au niveau d'un Ronnie O'Sullivan et ne sera d'aucune pitié, ne vous laissant parfois pas même jouer un seul coup ! La moindre erreur vous sera fatale si vous avez la main.

Concernant le mode Online, il est totalement désert, le jeu ayant peu de reviews et étant sorti il y a plus de 6 ans, c'est tout à fait logique. Par contre, je ne comprends pas pourquoi ce mode Online comporte des IA contre lesquels on peut gagner des points de ladder. Incompréhensible ! 

En conclusion, je recommande ce jeu, si vous voulez vous détendre en frappant quelques billes, surtout que le son des cannes qui frappent les billes, ou celui de ces dernières qui s'entrechoquent, sont très satisfaisants.

Bien à vous, chers lecteurs !",1665162543,1665162543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I don't often play games for that length of time, so this alone should tell you, Cue Club 2 is well worth your time.

I'd not long received my Steam Deck, and after trying out many games in my library, I was really in the mood for a pool game, which I didn't yet have. In terms of my history with pool games, I feel like the last time I got majorly into one was Bankshot Billiard 2, on the Xbox 360. I remember playing that game for many hours when it was released on Xbox Live Arcade back in the day. But my all time favourite pool game would be Arcade Pool on the Amiga. And I feel Cue Club 2 shares a lot of what I loved about that game, but in a much more modern package, with many more game types, including snooker. You still have the same top down view, but you can also play in 3D if you prefer. It's as simple as a click of the back button on your controller, to switch between the two views. I prefer to play mostly in the 2D top down view, but I do switch to the 3D view for the occasional long shot, where it does help with aiming, especially the long shots in snooker. 

I've been slowly trying to get all the achievements, which are mostly for beating each game type's tournament on each of the difficulty levels, as well as getting certain breaks in Snooker up to and including a 147, and also scoring so many points in the online mode. I haven't found anyone playing online sadly, but luckily this will not stop you earning the achievements, as there are a couple of bots in the online lobby. So you can still earn those points by playing bots, if you are having trouble finding anyone online to play. It's been great fun working my way through the achievements, and I'm now at 67 of 77, and I still have a good few hours of gameplay left trying to get the remainder. 

The physics for me are excellent. I'm certainly not an expert at pool/snooker in the real world, but the balls react as I would expect them to. You can add spin to the cue ball to curve it round other balls on the table, and it feels great doing this. There is nothing worse than getting a pool game, and the moment you start playing, the physics feeling wrong, so I'm very pleased with the physics here. 

Both pool and snooker play great, and although I was originally looking for a pool game, I've spent a ton of time playing snooker too, and it's brilliant. I'm still working on a 147 break, although I have managed to get the achievement for the 100 break which I'm happy about. 

I don't really have too much more I can say about this game. If you are looking for a pool or snooker game, you really can't go wrong with this one, and with it being a few years old, it won't break your bank either. I picked it up on sale for around £6.50, and got an absolute bargain, but i'd have paid the current full asking price (£12.99) if I'd had to. It's well worth that price. 

If you've got this far, just buy the game already.",1663242438,1663242438,True,3,0,0.555958688259124756,0,True,False,False,True,,,

There is an auto-save feature and so if there is a crash or accidental power-off during a game then you can easily restore the match.

For tournaments, select 'Games > Tournament' from the main menu, then click on the button at the bottom of the screen labelled 'Resume Previous Game'. This will take you back to the last point in the match before the shut down.

From here, you can then select 'Save and Exit' from the in-game menu at any time, if you wish to have a break and resume the match later. The entry will appear in the usual save game slots.

I hope this helps."

Don't let the cheesy cringe-inducing AI opponent artwork put you off. This is a fantastic simulation; the physics are excellent.

Complaint:

The snooker AI is disappointing. There are a total of 75 matches to play in the snooker bar challenge. For the first 74 matches the AI never won a single frame (note: I am a decent player using short visual lines, your mileage may vary). 

Only twice in 74 matches did the AI score a break above 20 points (28, 25). I even purposefully on occasions smashed the balls up and missed shots so that the AI could go for it. It refuses to string more than 4-6 balls together. BUT on the very last match (match 75) the AI came alive! Totally took me by surprise with a break of 58 and 45 in the first frame!

Such a shame that the progression up the ranks provides only novice difficulty right up until the final match. I understand that by turning off the secondary line it will make the game much harder, but it doesn't change the fact that the AI difficulty is flat up until the final match.

Conclusion:

The simulation itself is so good that I can only recommend, despite my complaint. And it is still actively being updated by the devs.",1643813776,1656584356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

先说优点吧：
1.偏好设置极其丰富，为迎合玩家喜好可谓诚意满满。
2.细节拉满、制作用心、氛围轻松。
缺点是游戏性很差，和真实台球差距太大了，如果你会点台球且性格较真，那游戏体验就是场灾难！
1.杆法、力度、加塞等物理效果不太真实，差别明显。
2.AI的走位、选球次序和击打合理性不堪入目，这是所有台球游戏的通病或者说技术难点，然而该作几乎集中体现了所有的通病。
以最难难度（pro级）说明（低难度就是故意瞄歪放水，没什么好说的）。
a）准度100%，只要有进球，不管多薄多远，必进；
b）杆法和力度瞎用，走位随缘；
c）解球准度100%，不管多少库解球必中，除非贴球，换言之做斯诺克对AI无用；
d）没有进攻机会时，从来不主动防守，都是瞎抡一杆，但主球必定不可思议地停在没有你进攻机会的位置；
e) 美式台球中有safety shot、push，但AI从来不用。
结果导致：走位要求不高的美式台球强无敌、走位要求较高的斯诺克台球菜的一笔。[strike] 所谓的pro级，感觉有辱所有现役职业选手。 [/strike]",1632919416,1708173928,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The physics are ok, there are lots of game modes to choose from, there are tournaments and single play and the controls are workable. 

The practice table is pretty bad, the controls for setup aren't great and there should be preset practice challenges (like the pros use for practice) where you can practice specific elements of your game (cue ball control around the table, a certain spin, swerve, angles off the cushions etc). You don't even have a setting where you can have the colours replaced (which breaks any chance of creating some rhythm mid practice).

The main reason I can't recommend this game is that the AI on the harder levels are the worlds most unbelievable flukers. You can put them in the hardest spot and they pull out a crazy double or foul but then snooker you (in a gamemode where you don't get a freeball/ball in hand/opponent play again) so you lose a life as well. The odd once in a blue moon fluke is ok (as in the real game) but I have played an AI who has had 3 outlandish flukes in one frame. 

I quite enjoy playing the harder levels outside of this as you can see how to improve your overall game/matchplay skills (you can see the spin and cue angle they are using before their shot). But the harder level games will always be close margins of victory and I can not reward a game where you can work hard and virtually earn a victory against a tough opponent to lose to outrageous flukes.",1610276483,1610277130,False,0,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cue Club 2 is an excellent pool and snooker game. I would say the best I've played. The graphics are amazing, and the snazzy jazz/lounge music is really cool. There are many different game modes and play styles, so much so that it actually felt overwhelming at first, in a good way! You can play 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Ball Pool, Speed Pool, Killer Pool, and Snooker any way you like. There are also great guides that provide detailed instructions on the specifics of each game and how to learn and master them. The value here is excellent.

If you love personalizing your game, then you’re in for a treat. Almost everything is customizable, including the cues, ball sets, chalk, table (such as the size, cloth, pattern, finish, pockets, etc.), background, effects, lights, colours, music, visuals, cursors, you name it… Literally everything, and in the moment to moment gameplay, that really makes a difference and greatly adds to realism and immersion. It feels like you're there.

The physics are ultra realistic, the controls are tight and the gameplay is super smooth. Once you get the hang of it, this game can get addicting! The developers are also great and committed to making the game even better with regular updates. All in all, Cue Club 2 has it all and is an impressive pool and snooker game that any fan of the sport would surely not want to miss!

I only got like 12 hours here so far but so far it has been quite nice. 
A brief comparison vis-a-vis its predecessor is present below for reference.
Better in Cue Club 2 - Game dynamics, game types, improved graphics, multiplayer, music
Better in Cue Club (older)  - Cue and ball varieties,  Bar system, smoke on the table 

I think I will give the older one a go if I can find my iso collection. Hopefully it will run in compatibility mode.
______________________________________________________________________
Major negative thing that I missed out in the original review (posting on 24 July 2020):
1. AI freeze is quite regular. Balls won't get placed back on table, AI opponent may not play at their turn.
2. GUI freeze is also quite common. After a ball is pocketed, the control panel won't show up again. The button to switch between the top control panel views is greyed out.
3.  Speed pool experience is badly hampered by ball dropping into pockets animation. May be the control to disable the control panel view switching is somewhere, at present I am unable to find it. The window reverts too late for me to figure out when can I play my next shot.
________________________________________________________________________

Updated on 25 July 2020 - Changed review to negative as game has regular issues
Game GUI/AI froze once again while playing 10 Red Snooker Tournament. Option to 'save and exit' was also greyed out so basically my whole progress is gone. In case any developers are paying attention to issues, please find below the sequence of events:
1. Pink ball was potted and wasn't placed back even though red balls were still there on table.
2. After missing on the next red, AI opponent took one shot where white ball was not present even though the whole animation was played.
3. Despite no red ball being potted, it still shows as the AI opponent's turn again.
4. Switching between windows and other gimmicks  with visual settings didn't get it back.
___________________________________________________________________

Final review update: Changed to positive recommendation following prompt help from Cue Club support team. I will add the workaround method on the forum so that it can be used by all players till the formal fix is issued as part of the next release.

Revised review ( 05 June 2022) - This game gets changed too often and some of these changes affect the ball dynamics.  I no longer find the ball dynamics consistent enough for me to like this game.  The weird ball movement is very frustrating considering that these days I only play snooker and that too on medium or low power without spin. The number of times I just Alt+F4 this game in frustration must be in hundreds

辅助线：这款游戏似乎不鼓励用辅助线，在选项里有相关描述。它的目标球辅助线只有在你明确指出目标球时才会出现，这也造成了你不知道母球是否会先擦到别的球而根本碰不到你想要打的球。这点似乎是作为了玩家技巧的一环。

I play a lot of pool myself and this is as close as I've come to playing a true digital representation and I own pretty much all of them. Not been this impressed with a PC pool/snooker game since I first played Archer McLeans's superb Jimmy Whites eon's ago.

Two gripes though - 

1 - Most importantly. Intermittently, the back spin doesn't take effect which can be frustrating on a big break or in a tournament situation.

2 - Waking away from the game or not playing for a a while can lead to the game freezing. This loses your progress in a tournament if you haven't saved.

This shall be my second review for a simulation of cue sports. Colloquially refered to as “billiards”, we can all agree that it’s an activity which still poses great interest even after more than five centuries since its invention. There may be at least a dozen online alternatives to Cue Club 2, yet few offer as much customization as the title I’m reviewing today. It is Bulldog Interactive’s Steam debut and their project has certainly improved substantially over time. You might be wandering about Cue Club 1 at this point. This particular developer has focused on cue sport simulations since 2000, which is almost as long as I’ve been gaming on PC. Cue Club 2 saw an initial retail release in 2014 and it has graced the Steam Store since 2016. If you’re good at something, never stop improving it. Or do it for free, since I’m certain that you’ve stumbled across plenty of F2Ps featuring billiards and snooker. They were rather thin on content, am I right?

[h1]Story[/h1]
Now, I could bore you with more historical details about cue sports, but I shall obviously avoid that path. Cue Club 2 has no story mode per se, yet the Bar Challenge can be considered a solo campaign designed specifically for players which do not wish to sink their teeth too deep into multiplayer that's ranging from championships to casual matches. Before discussing the Challenge, let me share my own experience with billiard simulations. Long before I enjoyed the activity in real life, I developed a taste for it in it’s digital format on PCs. There may have been several self-standing games based on pool, which I played earlier to some extent but quite surprisingly, it would be the Grand Theft Auto series (San Andreas, precisely) which managed to prove how fun and lucrative this activity can be. A visit to the Ten Green Bottles would both relax and allow for a friendly wager (crucial funds during a fresh start).

The sheer versatility of cue sports cemented their reputation as a favorite pastime of both blue and white collars. From watering holes in the middle of nowhere to pretentious social clubs, billiards receive the appreciation they deserve. Cue Club 2’s Bar Challenge is divided into three sections of gradually increasing difficulty: Basement, Cocktail and Penthouse. Three bars filled to the brim with worthy opponents. We get the usual assortment of skilled female and male players, but also more exotic rivals such a talented ape and a robot. Let no one claim that pool titles can’t mix some humor into the already established formula. In fact, the AI of your opponents will ensure that the Bar Challenge lives up to its name. It won’t be easy and it proves to be the perfect tutorial/warm up for the subsequent modes. As good a replacement for a story as you could hope for, given the gameplay. No cheesy cutscenes in Cue Club 2.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
I couldn’t find any information about the graphics engine, so we’ll proceed with the default assumption that it is proprietary to the developer. A hybrid 2D/3D perspective is a feature that we’ve all come to expect from contemporary cue sports simulations. Cue Club 2 does not disappoint on this front whatsoever. Depending on your preferences, you can enjoy the game in either 2D top-down view or fully rendered in 3D and far closer to the real life experience. I’m obviously a fan of the latter, since the former can make the game somewhat easier than intended. We’re not cheating on the Bar Challenge, fellas. Speaking of which, ball trajectory estimations will fully cater to new players. You don’t have to fear being left completely helpless, if your pool skills are rusty or non-existent.

As far as performance was concerned, I have no complaints. Everything scaled perfectly to 4K resolution and the frame rate never dropped below 60fps at any given moment. The aforementioned rich customization options come into play during the breaks between matches (not during ongoing championships though). I strongly suggest you fiddle with the settings menu and discover for yourselves, exactly how much you can tweak the experience. From changing the appearance of tables, cues and ball sets, to modifying the rules which shall govern the matches and ultimately ensure or hinder victory. European Pool doesn’t have to be much more complicated than the streamlined American version, which is also my personal favorite. Don’t even get me started about Snooker!

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Indeed, there’s no voice acting in Cue Club 2 but the soundtrack manages to compensate that, while text boxes represent the only interaction between players and the rivals you’ll have to defeat during your playthrough. Song diversity is balanced. It never got too close to repetitiveness since I was more focused on the game than on the sounds. You can always opt for listening to your own tracks of choice, so no cause of concern over acoustical inadequacies.

 [h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The bread and butter of any cue sport simulation will always be represented by the versatility of its various modes. It would have been far too simplistic to slap a US, Euro or Snooker label and call it a day. Bulldog Interactive offers some much needed variations: Killer Pool, Red Snooker and the “rapid fire” 6 Ball Pool which I compare to Blitz Chess in terms of duration and challenge. The standard pool game on both sides of the Atlantic, contains 15 balls (stripes and solids/spots) and a cue ball that’s usually blank or featuring a dot pattern. Snooker on the other hand, uses 22 colored balls along with a cue ball and can drag on for longer than I’m comfortable with. It’s always a matter of preference and Cue Club 2 offers either the standard or tailored versions which may speed up the process to a certain extent. Cutting corners quite literally, since table customization enables several pocket designs.

One key aspect I always seek out when analyzing cue sport simulations, is the Artificial Intelligence’s capabilities even on lower difficulty settings. Multiplayer matches and human minds are more difficult to predict and mistakes are rarely made on a consistent basis if you’re playing with someone skilled enough. How about the AI in a pool game? I judge their competence or the lack thereof, by observing the involuntary early pocketing of the 8-ball. That is the “cardinal sin” of any cue sport afterall. It spells “game over” and an easy, albeit somewhat undeserved victory for an opponent that might have fared badly in terms of pocketed balls. Out of turn pocketing is more lenient for stripes & solids but not for the “dreaded” eight-ball. Cue Club 2 surprised me by how rarely would the AI commit such an error. The Bar Challenge proved to be a worthy experience and I had my share of defeats against an AI which calculated both the approach angle and strike strength with alarming alacrity. 

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Overall, Cue Club 2 distances itself from its competition by giving players some much needed freedom for the rule sets as well. Custom profiles that transcend mere chromatic choices, offer flexibility to an otherwise rigid sport and pastime activity. It was only natural to allow billiards their chance of adapting to the audience, since the real life version has managed that quite admirably. Whether you play pool in a roadside bar or in a downtown club, the game depends on more than just a steady hand and a clear mind. It takes plenty of creativity and patience. Enjoy a cold pint and only pocket the 8-ball at its right time!

 [h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Steam Achievements.
+ Adequate challenge scaling.
+ Pleasant graphics and soundtrack.
+ Excellent simulation with replay value.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- Inherent repetitiveness of the gameplay.
- No Steam Trading Cards.

There are legions of options, a number of billiards variants to play, various competitive setups available, and it's loads of fun. Note: this game includes UK pool and amazingly 7-ball! (Never seen the latter anywhere else). I won't labour the point too long, I just urge you to give it a go, and for the price, it's a steal. The physics are also pretty realistic. Snooker is in my view well implemented, and this must be especially tricky to get right. The look and feel of the game is attractive and professionally done. The game even features a live audience, complete with applause, cheering and gasps! Now for some suggestions for further improvements (the British devs are constantly refining the game, they're among the most responsive devs I've ever seen!). Spin play needs improving – especially screwback is not ideally implemented and spin in general could be refined. A career mode would be a huge bonus. Some controls are occasionally a bit clunky. The AI is generally good and plays a solid game, but it doesn't always take the best chances, e.g. it will not try to knock in a money ball hanging over the pocket using a plant (the AI in Virtual Pool 4 will do this). At present, the AI is an aggressive (and highly competent!) potter, and is skilled at escaping snookers, but does lack in some other facets of play, e.g. laying snookers, and playing safeties, plants, and doubles. A further suggestion: once you've beaten all the AIs on Bar Tournament at any level, that's it, you've unlocked all the AIs for all the variants. But wouldn't it be better to make the player beat every AI for every billiards variant and at every difficulty, and not just one? Multiplayer exists but currently is not well implemented and needs some work. The devs are working hard on an ongoing basis to make this super product even better.

Реалистичная физика шаров. Отзывчивый разработчик. В случае выявления каких то багов, реагирует быстро. К примеру, вчера попытался поиграть с другом в мультиплеере. Кликаю на мультиплеер, меня выкидывает из игры, перезапускаю, такая же фигня. Описываю проблему разработчику, он связывается со мной, выявляем баг и сегодня выходит багфикс и вуаля, мультиплеер работает!!!   Сыграть после работы несколько матчей под ненадоедливую музыку, самое то!!! И кстати, приятный факт. В обозримом будущем разработчик обещает добавить в игру «Русский Бильярд». Надеемся и ждём. Кому интересно, об этом можно прочитать в обсуждениях. Вот ссыль http://steamcommunity.com/app/366690/discussions/0/1692659769960751698/
Ну и о том, рекомендую или нет? Конечно рекомендую!!! Я купил себе пять бильярдов в стиме на распродаже! За четыре вернул деньги, а в этот играю до сих пор! И даже купил еще трём своим друзьям)))
Так что приятной игры! Если ценник кусается, дождитесь распродажи!  10 приятно проведенных игровых вечеров из 10!!!

I first discovered ‘Cue Club’ about twenty years, by pure chance when I was wandering about the net, looking for a good game to play – any sort of game, just something to pass a bit of time. Well, as luck would have it, one of the apps I found was this snooker game, called Cue Club, which looked mildly interesting, so I downloaded it, just to give it a go. My thoughts were, (as a regular league snooker player myself), something like, ‘I suppose this will be a bit crass and totally unlike the real game, but it might be a bit of fun for a few minutes’. 
How wrong I was! Right from the very first I was impressed with the graphics employed, very realistic and with accurate reactions between the cue and the balls, just as had been claimed in the ‘splurge’ supplied; something to do with quantum math or something – it was so long ago I can’t recall the actual details. I also had complete control over things like colour of table top, type of cues and even the games themselves, because it wasn’t just snooker, but a whole list of other pool games as well. That first attempt provided me with more fun on the computer than I had enjoyed for a very long time.
As I said at the start, this all happened about twenty years ago, and I have been a ‘hooked’ player ever since, indulging several times a week, usually against the computer, but also occasionally against friends of mine, (because that’s one of the things you CAN do with this game!).
I’d always been impressed at the accuracy and realism of the game, and thought it had just about reached the limit, as far as that was concerned – until, that is Bulldog Interactive brought out the next generation, just a few months ago. This has had several improvements and alterations made to it, such as being designed to fit modern wide computer screens and better layout of game information, etc.
And so, the fun starts all over again – it’s just like having been promoted into a higher league! I would recommend anyone who enjoys snooker on the real tables, to give this game a go; I don’t think you’ll be disappointed! I should add that I have nothing whatsoever to do with Bulldog, I’m just a very happy customer who wanted to let the world know that there is fun to be had, and at a very reasonable price!

Currently they must be XInput compatible controllers, although Steam controller support is under consideration (please feed back to us on this).

The game looks absolutely beautiful. The graphics are clean and detailed.  It’s a top down snooker/pool game and this type of art-style looks very good for it. The art-style is very similar to the first game but in this one is HD and it’s much more polished and has more eye candy. Some of the effect that were included in the first game seem to be missing, namely the strobing disco light effect. The game is locked at 60 FPS and I did not get any dips in performance throughout my gameplay.

Cue Club 2 features very awesome soundtracks. These soundtracks, I can listen to them all day long. It’s sort of like club music but a bit slower paced. The sound of the cues, balls hitting other balls, even chalking your cue are good. Just listen to the music in the video posted below.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

The gameplay is pretty simple and straight forward. The good part is the variety of things you can do. You can play 8 ball pool, 9 ball pool, 6 ball pool, killer pool, full snooker or 10 and 6 balls snookers. You can play against the AI or play 2 players locally taking turns each. The physics of the table cloth can be adjusted and the size of the balls can also be changed. The game’s physics is one of the best pool physics in a pool game I have seen. The AI opponents will say stuff like “nice shot” if you manage a good shot, which can be pretty entertaining. Another thing missing is the virtual chat option. That was one of the prominent features of the game and highly entertaining. As you could get in chats with the AI players and mess around.

There are tons of design choices you can select for almost everything in the game. You can change the table cloth color, the finish of the wood, the pattern on the table cloth. The balls size can be adjusted and plenty of different types of balls can be selected. You can even choose the color of your chalk. Many different types of cues are available as well. Even some match rules can be changed. All of these are unlocked and ready to use, so no more grinding to unlock these cosmetic items.

You can play different modes such as a tournament mode where you and several other virtual AI opponents will enter and there are fixtures just like a real snooker/pool tournament. Other than that there’s also bar mode where you start off in the lowest basement level bar and make your way up to a more expensive penthouse bar. The difficulty will increase as you progress to higher level bars. You can play solo as well. You can also play quick mode where you can just go and play any type of game with AI opponent. Another mode is solo mode. This has a game type called “Slam”. In this you can drag the cue ball with your mouse as if it were attached with a string and play that way. This mode was pretty fun. Other solo game types include speed pool mode where you have to clear the table as fast as you can and that time is recorded so you can come back and try to beat your own time. 

A short gameplay video of a bar challenge game can be found below:

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

If you have played the original Cue Club back in the day, you’re in for a pleasant surprise with this game. Even if you haven’t played it, this game is so amazing. One of the best pool/snooker games I have ever played. Super addicting, gorgeous with an amazing sound track. If you like pool/snooker in real life or in games media, then this is the game for you. The game has some nice achievements too.",1469217873,1469219070,True,59,2,0.813522756099700928,3,False,False,False,False,,,

游戏直到昨天还在继续更新，目前有了3D视角，
而且做得很棒，无论光影还是声效，
都比别的一众台球游戏更加真实和出色，
很有质感。
目前击球线路提示也可以自己设置了，
默认是没有开启的。
按住右键调整击球力量，
右键按住的时候同时按下左键可取消该次击球，
这个功能更新好久了，还是写出来吧，
给新入的朋友参考一下，
基本上这个游戏左右俩键就全控制了。

真的是个用心的作品。推荐。

---------------16.10.05---------------
经过两次反馈，一两个小bug都被修复了，
建议增加的练习模式还原上次击球的功能也在第二天就更新了，
开发者的反馈很迅速，好评！

---------------16.09.15---------------
看到有说操作麻烦得来回点的什么的，
明明右键就能直接击球了呀，
选择个力度和击球点应该很合理吧....
这代除了酒吧里没那么多AI跟你bb了，
别的哪儿跟上一代变化太大了...
现在联机模式也上线了，虽然我网不好T_T
不过即使打AI也挺好玩的啊，

Первый обзор на игру был больше негативным, но кое-что подправлено апдейтами. Поэтому скорректирую... 

Плюсы:

1. Визуально игра звёзд с неба не хватает, однако марку держит. Вид сверху однообразен, но для многих игр данного жанра привычен. Лично я бы хотел иметь вариативность в этой части. Есть несколько фенечек вроде выбора кия, шаров, стола и т.п., мел оставляет след на сукне. В целом терпимо, но можно лучше.

2. ""Физика"" шаров на уровне без вопросов. Придраться не к чему.

3. Есть несколько уровней сложности, тренировочный режим, присутствуют интересные варианты пула (кроме обычных 8-ки и 9-ки). Порадовало наличие снукера. Не порадовало отсутствие стрейт пула. Не помешали бы дополнительные настройки в матчевой игре. Например, настройки количества партий, шаров и т.п. до победы.

Минусы:

1. Самая большой хренью этой игры (сорри за мой французский) был абсолютный дисбаланс искусственного интеллекта, особенно на высоких уровнях сложности. На начальных уровнях оппонент едва бил в сторону лузы, на уровне профи - не знал, как промахнуться. Причём забитие происходило из самых странных положений. ИИ мог со всей дури ударить в скопление из, допустим, пяти шаров и с кучей рикошетов нужный шарик падал в итоге в лузу. И это норма. Я уж не говорю про ""открытые"" удары, и использование бортов с любого расстояния и на любой резке. Попадание было 100%, даже не 99... Переход хода был реален только при ""слипшихся"" шарах либо биток случайно упал в лузу. Остальное - статистическая погрешность. По факту снукер сильно проседал. Выигрывать партию с кия в пуле можно, в снукере - это бред, даже для профессионала. 

Эту проблему слегка пофиксили. Играть стало менее напряжно, но трикшоты ИИ всё равно""проскакивают"".

2. Игра однозначно заточена под пул. Снукер обделён. Во-первых, над ИИ в части снукера еще стоит поработать. Лично я не хотел бы видеть трюкачество в снукере в качестве нормы. Во-вторых, в снукере по-прежнему не реализована часть важных правил. Например, отсутствует так назывемый Foul and a Miss (Фол и Промах). Хотя в некоторых ситуациях прям напрашивается. То есть позиция снукера при неудачном выходе из него никогда не восстанавливается. После удара можно либо продолжать самому, либо дать продолжить противнику. Что удручает, ведь порой грамотным снукером можно  до смерти затерзать оппонента, но увы не здесь...( Есть и другие неточности в реализации правил игры в снукер.

3. Музыка в игре, что есть, что нет. Выключил почти сразу, чтоб не напрягала. Но это болезнь практически любых симуляторов бильярда.

4. Заявленная цена великовата для ""сырой"" в целом игры. Приличный мультиплеер, пусть и локальный, мог бы хоть как-то её оправдать)

Итог. Довольно попсовенький бильярд с несколько завышенной ценой. Можно поиграть в своё удовольствие в свободное время, если при этом поставить фоном свою музыку и не жаль копеечку. Пожалуй, 7 из 10 с перспективой 8-ми.",1459628126,1463921116,True,29,1,0.707899868488311768,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I dunno whether it still is, perhaps it's tied with it's sequel.

The original Cue Club had plenty of games including Killer Pool and a few other fun options for party play. I'm glad they're all here in Cue Club 2. I also love the fact that you have every aesthetic option available from the beginning, unlike the original in which you had to unlock things mighty slowly.

There were several features now missing in Cue Club 2. Some were quite fun, such as disco lights, strobe, and ""dynamic"" cue play. Of all of these I miss it's the ""dynamic"" cue play, as it made the mouse become the friggin' cue. No such feature here. A feature that some might miss from the original is the ""chat"" feature, but that had too many flaws for me to work it out. I'm glad it's refined so the computer actually feels more human. Pretty cool.

OK, now that I've gotten an old vet's fit out of the way, it's time to put the olive branch where it belongs. Cue Club 2 is well worth your money if you're looking for a pool game. The music makes you feel like you're in a club, which is awesome. The physics are as equivalent to real life as humanly possible, and the visuals can fool you into thinking you're playing the real thing. You actually click the chalk block in order to chalk your cue, in contrast to a command in the original. In my opinion, Cue Club 2 is the very closest you can get to playing a real pool game on a computer.

Would I recommend this over the original? No, I wouldn't. But does that mean I want you to have the original instead? You're silly if you didn't see the fact that I think this game's worth it!",1459458204,1459458204,True,17,1,0.636578202247619629,5,True,False,False,False,,,
