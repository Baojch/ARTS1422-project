We strongly believe in words: 'Pay once, Play forever' and will provide all future content updates for free. 
There are at least two planned expansions with new ships, abilities, campaigns and a multiplayer support.

Those two lines were there when I bought the game. After a LOOOONG time with no information of any kind, the developer showed up, actively promoting a planned sequel, which was to include multiplayer. When asked about this game's multiplayer, which does not yet exist, they took a long time to respond.

When there was a response, it was a very ACTIVE response - there was a sale on the already-low price of the game, an announcement of a major free expansion of game content, andsince then... a paid DLC which seems to directly contradict the promise of ""all future conent updates for free"". I mean, to be fair, it WAS a $5 game at the time that promise was made, and it's been heavily revamped with a ""redux"" release now and had the price bumped up a bit.

I previously gave this game a ""not recommended"" rating, but because of suspicions about the developer failing to deliver on promises, NOT because of the quality of the game. There's still no multiplayer, and the original promise of that as a future update has been - with a well-intended apology - removed from the game's store page. But the ""new"" product (since it has been significantly overhauled) is worth it for what it promises now.

It takes a little figuring out at first, but once you get it, gameplay flows quite well. Anticipating enemy movements to line up your torpedoes or strafing runs feels satisfying when you get it right. Using abilities at the wrong time, or using the wrong ability for a situation, can lead very quickly to an early grave, but it consistently feels like you got outplayed, not like the game cheated you out of a win. My original review complained about a lack of polish, and while it looks like they may have some issues with the English language in places, the graphics have been cleaned up, the gameplay feels even smoother, and I can much more happily recommend the game.

Also note: The dev did kindly offer me a DLC key, but it doesn't appear to have given me access to the DLC. Additionally, it claimed I already owned the content, so if you're reading this, feel free to try using the code yourself, I think it might be a key for the game instead.",1499478822,1534434733,True,1,0,0.444154083728790283,1,False,False,False,False,,1518950224.0,"Hello!

A Revised Review (2018):

[url=http://awkwardmixture.blogspot.com/2018/02/a-voyage-into-already-explored-space.html]A Voyage into An Already Explored Space[/url]

In conclusion: Star Tactics Redux is a serious effort to improve on the original game. Most of the major flaws have been dealt with, like the AI, overpowered missiles, game modes, and ships. But though the Steam Store page describes it as “a hardcore turn-based strategy and tactics game full of spacefleet battles” with “30+ hours of gameplay, infinite randomized battles,” and a “huge campaign with different ways of completion.” I would say it's a fast casual game, which probably has about twelve hours max for the base game if one is determined to earn all the three star scores. Sure the DLC will increase, and maybe double, the time, but it's not included in the fifteen dollar price. If one is willing to play skirmish and the DLC more than once, the game could eat up a lot of time.

For what it is, it's certainly an enjoyable little game. And now comes the toughest part. For the first time, I've been asked to review a product. I'm not sure how that's impacted what I've written, or what I'm ultimately going to recommend. I've tried to honestly considered whether I'm being kinder than I would be. After all, I've given harsh reviews over the last two years to Sins of A Solar Empire, Brigador, New 'n' Tasty, Oxenfree, The Vanish of Ethan Carter, Dungeon of the Endless, and XCOM® 2 (lol). Some of these are acclaimed games. Some people may find this as splitting hairs, which pleases no one, but I would recommend Star Tactics Redux, but only for those looking for a simple, fast, casual style game.  Perhaps that's why it's a mobile game as well.",1483409629,1519148017,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,True,False,False,,1518950514.0,"Hello!

If you're looking for you're gonna marry and have kids with, this is probably not your game.
If you're looking for an AAA title with the best graphics of the century, this is definitely not your game.

But if you're looking for a simple but challenging game to have a few hours of fun with, this is it.


Star Tactics takes the mantra ""less is more"" as its basis and creates great game around it.
It is based on very simple mechanics, but these open up to a quite large amout of tactical decision making, sometimes even feeling similar to chess.
Sure, the graphics are nothing to write home about, but I feel the minimalistic wireframe-like style actually adds to the immersion, making you really feel like a commander directing the battle through his tactical display.
The UI is similarly minimalistic as the grapics and I think it might even be the best part of the game. It's intuitive, clear, and doesn't feel cluttered or complicated at all. While part of this might be due to the simple underlying mechanics, I feel like many bigger game companys could learn one thing or the other from this game.
The levels are quite well designed. Most of the time you're facing a larger opponent fleet, so you actually need to gain an advantage through better positioning and using your ships' abilities well.

While this game is great, I have found four notable flaws.
One, Torpedoes/Rockets are really overpowered. Many battles, you can win through ""french-american"" tactics: Run away as fast as you can while bombing the hell out of your enemy. If your battleship or dreadnought isn't already in range of the enemy ships, it's a sitting duck.
Two,  sometimes, the enemy AI is dumber than bread. Lay a line of mines, hide behind it and wait for the enemy to run into its doom. Most of the time this is mitigated by being outgunned or outnumbered, though, so it's actually a balanced fight.

Three, the game has no gamemode where you can build your own fleet.
And last: NO MULTIPLAYER. I'd love to play this game against a friend!

В вашем распоряжении находится целый флот космических кораблей, который поможет вам выиграть в жестокой войне за ресурсы на других планетах.
Вам предстоит управлять сражениями через электронную сенсорную карту (очень похожую на радар), которая позволяет быстро отдавать приказы любому кораблю. Сражения здесь довольно сложные. Враги очень хитрые и умные. Чтобы выходить победителем из каждого сражения вы должны будете придумать собственную оригинальную тактику боя.

Геймплей тут, конечно, очень разнообразен:
В игре присутствуют 2 компании: Основная и Дополнительная (с участием малых космических аппаратов);
Много различных кораблей (начиная от маленьких скаутов и заканчивая огромными дредноутами) с полноценной прокачкой способностей (ракеты, торпеды, щит, форсаж, разворот).

Стоит отметить так же оригинальный графический стиль и качественное атмосферное музыкальное сопровождение (отсылка к X3 and X-Rebirth).
Не забываем так же про наличие достижений Steam и коллекционных карточек.

...Благо, в тактическом плане здесь есть, где развернуться. Не пройдя и трети одного из режимов игры, вы познакомитесь уже с десятком различных типов кораблей, у каждого из которых свои характеристики, способности (ускорение, ракеты, разворот на 180 или 360 градусов, мины и т.д.) и особенности (радиус и направление автоматического огня, количество орудий и т.д.).

Instead of airships, you have capital ships; instead of propeller-driven or jet-powered aircraft, you have space fighters, etc.

That's pretty much it. Even the control scheme (where you guide your units using arrows) and special abilities (such as a defensive shield or a 180 degree turn) are nearly identical to Steambirds. 

After requesting an options menu be implemented, the developer readily responded and added one. The options menu now lets you set music and sound effects, as well as resolution, advanced effects, and gives you the choice to play in windowed mode.

Despite my harsh comparison to Steambirds, the fact remains that Star Tactics is an entertaining, albeit somewhat simple, game. It's not meant for people to spend all day playing, but for those who have limited time and want to play a game in short spurts.
