The premise is interesting but the game just doesn't deliver. 

The earlygame relies too much on 'grinding' through a separate mini-game which involves scooping out a litterbox - read: repetitive poop scoop which is no fun at all. No health bars on the regular enemies makes it more of a guessing game rather than a strategy challenge. And the biggest issue I have with this game is the combination of the bosses having too much health, being able to spawn multiple minions and that individual arrows fired are rendered - I came to write this review because I [u]literally[/u] spent an hour going from level 1 to 50, and took the final boss down to half health... only to be greeted by a pop-up which said ""Fatal memory overflow"". Clicking ""OK"" killed the game... and all my progress.

Cute/silly fun, well balanced, challenging, slightly tedious.

I bought it during the 50% off sale just to give it a try. My first time playing, I enjoyed it enough that I played for almost three hours straight.

Some people have mentioned a problem launching the game, but I haven't encountered that, nor any other problems.

I get why some people are getting stuck. Near the beginning, your progress will be a crawl unless you do the two mini games at least once each. Once you do this, you're able to buy some upgrades that make the battles go much better. Once you get a few upgrades, the battles themselves will give you all the money you need. They're very well balanced so that it's a tough challenge to come out ahead on money, but if you plan it right, you will.

The mini games are just silly phone-app type games that are a bit monotonous, but they're not terrible. They're just there as a way for you to earn extra money IF you need to. They help to ensure that you won't be stuck if you can't come out ahead in the battles. In one, you have to feed the cats in a dumbed down version of a diner game. In the other, you have to scoop their litter box. The only real challenge or interest in the litter box game is just seeing how fast you can rack up the money and how many hidden treasures you can find.

There's also a spy-dog on the main screen who offers to sell you items at very high prices. I found out by accident that once you buy these, they are permanently available to you in the main game at a small cost. Once you can buy some of these, it makes getting to higher waves in the main game much easier, which means you'll gain plenty of money in every battle.

At $2.50, I consider this a great buy. It's cheesy fun, something different.  $5 is probably about just right for this game if it speaks to you, but if you can get it on sale, I recommend it even if you're just somewhat curious.",1465293978,1465294157,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

One major flaw: Bugs. The game has crashed several times on me while playing one of the ""mini-games"". In this mini-game you clean the communal cat litter box. You essentially shovel excrement when it pops up in the litter box and while shoveling you can happen to find all sorts of items... or get nothing its a cr*p shoot. If you are not shoveling, then you are spraying to rid the communal litter box of stench. 
The game has crashed on me consistently when shoveling when clicking moderately fast. And crashed once while spraying the stench. Others have reported it crashing while clearing waves. Fortunately, that didn't happen to me. This would be extremely painful as there is no auto-saving. So, if the game closes while clearing waves, then you lost all of the progress. You have to complete all of the waves or exit the current wave and Save to keep all of your progress.

The other flaw is Design/Ideas. As with other tower defense games, you can unlock and upgrade your defense units. This game has a one time purchase feature with a buff for all of your units versus upgrades for individual units. These upgrades are accomplished with money. As it is a tower defense game, you would think the majority of your money could be made with clearing waves.... Unfortunately this is not the case, at least not in the beginning. The mini-games was where I made the most money. There are two. One is a kind of ""feed your troops"" game which I was a little confused about at first as there was no mention of what to do. I did figure it out, but you can only attempt this mini-game after clearing some waves. A decent amount of money can be made from this. However, this presents some difficulty as you need money to purchase upgrades to progress further.
The other mini-game is maintaining the litter box, which I mentioned has problems above. It has been frustrating to try to save money for upgrades only to have it crash and lose all the time attempting to dig for gold. Why is this one of the main ways to make money in a tower defense game? Also, there are items that you can only find while digging in the litter box, you cannot purchase these in a store. The only way to purchase these items is if you unlock the airlift support feature and then the items you can purchase are completely random. When these items are purchased, you must immediately use them; you can't save the items for when you need them. 

There is a feature to increase the speed of the game.... by one speed. For some of the bosses, dealing with them is very tedious and you wish there was an increase speed button to increase the speed even more to get through. As once my units where established, there was nothing else for me to do but sit and watch my units slowly decrease the bosses health bar. 

I did eventually beat the game without getting all the upgrades. Tip to beat the game: get lots of items from the litter box. After I did, it unlocked one of the modes. However, this disabled the ability to level up my units as they were upgraded to the maximum level. The achievements for this game require you to reach the max level for upgrades. This is no longer possible with my current game. There is no feature to start a new game; I would have to uninstall the game and then reinstall it or clear the saved files for the game. All things I have to do outside the game, not in the game. As all my units are fully upgraded and no other upgrades are available, money becomes useless. There is nothing to strive for aside from trying to clear as many waves as possible, which just becomes tedious as some of the bosses just take time to kill. You can just walk away and come back and the boss will be dead. A few of the bosses do take effort. But overall, this game in its current state doesn't have me wanting more. 

I will say I did have one interesting experience. I was listening to music while maintaing the communal litter box when some epic music songs started playing. Shoveling cat excrement while listening to epic music was interesting and took some of the dullness out of what I was doing.

If you want to play it casual sure go for it. The game is cute.. A basic tower defense game with mainly kittens and puppies!

Final thoughts? Do not bother with the game until the game is fixed. Like srsly fixed not just some minor patch. 50% of the time it will crash with a ""Memory Error"" problem.

In general the game is a cute and has a fun concept. Do not need much skill to complete it just farm loads (hrs and days just scooping poop) and bam you should be able to still beat it. if you are lucky enough it does not give you any errors. Skip this game and find yourself a more stable title!

I got this game from groupees.com for 3 bucks as a bonus but it feels like it's worth is more than what I paid for.

It's  a different kind of Tower Defense, it requires decision making wether you have to take the beating alone to gain more gold at game over, or you can continue to dare and try if your cat defenses are strong enough for the next wave.

There are 6 cats with different attacks and each with 2 modes(needs upgrading). And the king can have up to 6 different modes/attacks.

There are a total of 13 dogs with different attacks and you need to remember how to deal with them so you can protect the king.

The Bosses are quite challenging, but there's a line up of who's coming first so you can prepare and set up your defenses accordingly.

The mini games are a nice change of pace since the main game can get frantic. [strike]But the only thing is the litter box can be tedious.[/strike]

Since last update, there are now two game modes where the king requires donation everytime you go to battle and the other one is more casual and relax mode.

There are three additional games to unlock, one you have to buy from the dog, the other one from finishing the main game, and the third which is night mode only(hard).

Overall, it's a fun game and yes it has some flaws, but it looks like the developer is putting a lot of efforts and constantly updating it. You can see the dedication and love that the developers puts in it.

Changed to ""recommended"" for anyone even slightly interested in tower defense games and cats. The best part is probably the dev's quick response to fixing the issues myself and other reviewers have had with the game, including bugs.

Since the dev has now fixed the bugs preventing me from progressing, I can now see more of the changes made since my original review (below). I have not earned my way to the different modes yet, so I'm just on the first one and my review only covers that. I'm playing in ez mode where Kingkat does not take your coins down to 500 as he did originally (and still does in the harder mode). In ez mode you get to keep whatever you earn and take as much as you want into battle. This may be OP and not challenging for many players, and those players can of course choose to play the harder mode. Since tower defense games aren't really my favorite (this is the only one I own in fact) it's a welcome casual feel for me and anyone looking for a casual but still fun experience would enjoy this, no doubt. Even with unlimited coins allowed in battle, you still can't expect to breeze through the game without earning upgrades and being tactical in your approach to defense.

Dev has also made the litterbox minigame much less annoying than it was originally. It's now much faster paced. Now too that I've been able to progress well it's not even necessary to play it since I can get a ton of coins from actual tower defense, but you do get free items from playing it and coins are always useful so it's never a pointless game, but can be avoided after a lot of progression if you desire. The Chow minigame could be avoided as well if you find yourself drowning in coins from simply chewing on dogs instead, but I find it interesting.

In case viewers opt not to read my original review below, the last part is still valid, so a repeat here: ""The music is also quite catchy and the style of the game is fitting for what it seems like it's trying to be, not really sure how to describe the style though without coming off as though I don't like it. I'm neutral on that stance if anything, it's in no way bad.""

The only issue I see now is that there doesn't appear to be a way to swap modes, so once you choose ez or hard you're stuck with it. Will suggest that among a couple other things in a post on the forums, otherwise I feel it's solid from what I've seen so far.

*ORIGINAL REVIEW*
I suppose I should start with the disclaimer that I'm not usually a fan of tower defense games. This is in fact the only one I own. Unfortunately, this is much less a tower defense and more a litter box cleaning simulator. Yes, you can earn coins by other means, but here's the main problems with those means:
1. The ""chow"" mini game (where you feed cats for coins and to be able to earn them for free use during battle) can only be played once and only if you progressed during your last run. I've not been able to play it after 3 runs now, I assume that's because each time I only managed to make it to wave 10 each time, never beating my highest score.
2. If you have more than 500 coins before entering battle, Kingkat takes all of your excess coins from you. He does NOT return them afterwards. If you're stuck like I am, this really sucks because that means you can't actually gain any coins simply by battling, you absolutely must play the litter box mini game and ONLY the litter box mini game to earn upgrades.

Now, this would be fine if the litterbox mini game was not tedious and irritating... but it is. Grab one poo, another appears, sometimes multiple. The small ones are worth 60, large worth 100, and it takes a bit of time to sift them, so it's not instant pick up. There's also the little waves of urine odor which can be dealt with with a spray that you earn through the litterbox mini game, but they also vanish over time if you just leave them. If you do manage to clear out the whole litter box you get a rain of money until something appears again. It's quite difficult to keep the box cleared though, so you sit there having to poke at it for quite a while before being able to upgrade anything.

If the dev reads this at all, I would ask you to consider either changing the way the litterbox minigame works (make it less tedious or make cleaning it more worth while) or add other means of making money, maybe more mini games or make battling more worthwhile (no more greedy Kingkats maybe). If any of that gets changed I will gladly revisit the game and consider changing my review to ""recommended"" instead of not.

If you can get past the tediousness of the upgrades system, the tower defense part is pretty fun from what I've been able to see so far. The music is also quite catchy and the style of the game is fitting for what it seems like it's trying to be, not really sure how to describe the style though without coming off as though I don't like it.

The main game is a tower defense where you defend against waves of dogs but later you can play as the dogs attacking.
basics are: get money, upgrade castle, get new mercs, buy items and repeat.
you get cash from 2 mini games and fending off hoards of dogs.
the 2 mini games are feeding your mercs (they sit and ask for stuff and you drag it down from up top to them), and cleaning the litter box (shift litter for droppings and item).

the tower defense is basic stuff if you played one before.
if not you have some cash to start with and buy then place units.
as you take out incoming attackers you'll get a cash value for them so you can buy more units or items.
you can also steal money with rogues and by sending kitties on adventures.
each unit has 2 abilities with 6 units in all not counting the kitty king with his own buyable abilities.
the round ends by losing your kitty king or downing all 5 bosses.

the big bad wolf mode
here you play as the dogs storming the castle.
the wolf wonders the field and uses cards to do various thing but mostly to summon other dogs to attack.
this mode ends when your wolf dies or you down the lead cat.",1440886087,1441425652,True,10,1,0.492831707000732422,0,False,False,False,False,,,
