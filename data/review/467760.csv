[i] Title: ""Makarov's Trappers 'Delight'""

[Scene: The Fairy Tail guild hall is bustling with activity. Natsu, Lucy, Gray, Erza, Gildarts, and the rest of the guild members are gathered around a table, discussing something with Makarov.]

Natsu: Alright, Master Makarov, we've got something exciting to show you!

Makarov: Oh, what's that, my dear boy? Another one of your hair-brained schemes?

Lucy: No, no, Master Makarov! It's something fun! It's called Trappers Delight!

Makarov: Ah, a delightful little game, I presume?

Gray: Yeah, it's all about traps! You know how much I love traps!

Juvia: [blushing furiously] Gray-sama loves what?!

Gray: No, no, Juvia! I meant I love traps in games! Like the ones in Trappers Delight!

[Juvia swoons and faints dramatically.]

Erza: [sighs] Gray, watch your words. Anyway, Master Makarov, Trappers Delight is a game where you set up traps and try to navigate through them.

Makarov: Ah, sounds like a challenge! I could use a bit of excitement in my old age.

Gildarts: Heh, sounds like my kind of game! Let's see what you've got, kids.

Natsu: Exactly! It's all about strategy and quick thinking.

Makarov: Strategy and quick drinking? Count me in!

Lucy: No, no, Master! Strategy and quick thinking!

Makarov: Ah, my hearing isn't what it used to be, my dear Lucy. But it sounds like a hoot!

[Scene: The guild sets up the game on a nearby console. Makarov peers at the screen with curiosity.]

Makarov: So, how does this work? Do I press this button here?

Natsu: No, no, Master! That's the self-destruct button!

Makarov: Self-destruct button? In a game? What madness is this?!

Gildarts: Relax, Makarov. Just dive right in and let your instincts guide you.

[As Makarov starts playing, he immediately falls victim to the first trap.]

Makarov: By the gods! What devilry is this?!

Natsu: That's just the beginning, Master! You have to be quick!

Makarov: More like a trapper's nightmare than delight!

[The guild erupts into laughter as Makarov struggles through the game, misinterpreting each instruction and falling into trap after trap.]

Lucy: Master, watch out for the spikes!

Makarov: Snakes? Where?!

[He leaps into the air, narrowly avoiding another trap.]

Erza: No, Master Makarov! Not snakes, spikes!

Makarov: Spikes?! Even worse!

[Gray tries to contain his laughter as he watches Makarov navigate through the treacherous levels.]

Gray: You're doing great, Master Makarov! Just a few more traps to go!

Makarov: Great? I feel like I've aged another decade playing this infernal contraption!

[Despite the chaos and confusion, Makarov manages to reach the end of the level, albeit with a few bumps and bruises.]

Makarov: Haha! Victory is mine!

[The guild cheers as Makarov proudly looks at the screen, completely unaware of the chaos he's caused.]

Natsu: See, Master Makarov? Trappers Delight isn't so bad after all!

Makarov: Perhaps not, my dear boy. But I think I'll stick to my good old-fashioned magic from now on!

Gildarts: Haha, good call, Makarov. But hey, it was worth a shot!

[The guild laughs and cheers, relieved that Makarov survived his encounter with Trappers Delight.] [/i]

Имеем графику аля Jones on Fire и геймплей-калька с Ultimate Chicken Horse (далее UCH), но с другого ракурса?
Знакомимся, это Trapper's Delight (TD).

Игра не плоха, мне нравится её концепция, но не нравится реализация.

Вы и ваши друзья\сопернички получаете в своё распоряжение какую-нибудь ловушку, может быть как позитивную, так и негативную, а так же может быть открытая-видимая или скрытая-невидимая.
Все ставят свои ловушки на карте и задача дойти до финиша.
Но вот проблема, из-за обилия всего скрытного (что мне нравится), а так же геймплея по клеткам, игроки КРАЙНЕ быстро портят уровень до состояния непроходимости.

Если в той же UCH это делается в равной степени всеми и для всех, и если путь непроходимый, то это видно сразу и все стараются это как-то исправить, но оставить сложным, то в TD никто до конца даже не знает где какая сложность.
Лучшим решением было бы делать ловушки невидимыми лишь до их первого обнаружения игроком. Или если уж прошли, но не активированы, то открывать их так.

А тут получается, что люди строят не зная на самом деле что уровень уже непроходим. Из-за того что всё по клеткам, нет возможности маневнировать как при платформинговом геймплее.

Суть по пунктам

[h1]Плюсы[/h1][list]
[*]Много ловушек
[*]Много уровней
[*]Первое время весело, на пару вечеров норм[/list]

[h1]Минусы[/h1][list]
[*]Игровая механика скудна на интересные повороты
[*]Малый простор для скилла проходящего уровень
[*]Уровни быстро загаживаются из-за сетчатого передвижения
[*]Реиграбельность. Самый важный пункт для таких игр здесь загублен.[/list]

[h1]Вердикт[/h1]
В итоге данная игра стала больше про тактику, но не справилась с собственными механиками. Просто не вывозит в тех рамках, в которые игру заточили. Дешево стоит, неплохо играется, но ни на какие лавры не претендует.
В игре так же есть кампания, или что-то вроде того, но разве ради этого вы берете подобные игры?

Но всё равно на пару вечеров с друзьяшками можно взять.
Игра вовсе не плоха, но рекомендовать её трудно, когда ещё до её появления были аналоги получше.

Разрабу стоило бы довести игру до ума, проект то перспективный. Но игру уже давно забросили походу. Отзыв нейтрален.

It's fairly simple to learn and can get quite difficult, especially later in each round where nearly every inch of a map becomes deadly. There's a good number of different maps included and there's workshop support as well, so there's quite a few maps online that can be played as well. The UI can be a bit busy and it can definitely get a bit overwhelming when you're playing with 4 people (I personally prefer playing with 2 or 3 people), but these are really my only complaints and they're fairly minor.

Note that the game is also quite different when playing online multiplayer vs. local multiplayer. When playing online, you can only see where you're placing your own traps, so you can never really be certain that any tile is safe, as there could be hidden traps anywhere. When playing locally, everyone places traps at the same time, so you can see exactly where people are putting their traps. Playing local multiplayer then becomes more of a challenge of perception and memory, as you try to watch and remember where everything was placed. Playing online is much more of a game of trickery and strategy, as you must instead guess where people placed traps and keep an eye on where your opponents walk to try to spot any hidden traps or shortcuts. I think I personally prefer online multiplayer, but they both offer their own slightly different experience.

There's also a singleplayer ""challenge"" mode which I found to be fun as well. It offers what are essentially a set of puzzles, where you need to place traps on a map to reach the goal, collect all the coins, and beat in under a certain time. I did find most of the included challenges to be fairly easy for the most part, but the later challenges got more interesting, and there's workshop support as well, although there weren't a ton of challenge levels uploaded the last time I checked.

The graphics have a nice voxel aesthetic and the game runs well. The stability is excellent, as I encountered no bugs while playing this game.

[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a fun competitive level-building game with both fun mechanics, both local and online multiplayer, interesting singleplayer challenge levels, nice graphics, and excellent stability. I'd recommend this game if you're looking for some chaotic fun with friends, and the singleplayer experience isn't bad either if you're looking for a simple puzzle game, although the game definitely shines the brightest in multiplayer.",1641245108,1641245108,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It's continuously fun, and every match will be different. Figuring out how to screw over others while trying to create sneaky advantages for yourself never gets old.
On a technical level, the game is great too. Highly optimized; with absolutely no lag even when my friends were playing with dial-up internet. Obviously the graphics aren't exactly detailed, but that simplicity ends up helping, I found. All of the traps seem to be very well balanced, nothing felt overpowered or cheaty. The maps are challenging while allowing you many ways to maneuver and place traps. The only time the game gets slow or truly frustrating is if you and your friends end up putting so many traps at the start of the course that you can't actually progress. While that can happen, there are ""traps"" that clear tiles and remove other traps, so rarely were we stuck like that for very long.

Overall, this is a VERY fun game to play with friends. I'm glad my mate generously got it for me, because I probably would have assumed this is just another cheap party game, had I not actually played it.

+ Most of the traps are very original, only a few annoying/dumb ones

o Traps are have the colour of the person deploying it, it would be much more interesting if you wouldnt know who placed it
o With 4 players the maps are very fast overfilled with traps. The game works best with 3 players.

Buy it if you have friends who will play it with you. Its a very easy game, not really for long term usage.

O jogo parece simples: há um único mapa para todos os players, cada um coloca suas armadilhas e quem chegar no lugar marcado e matar inimigos com armadilhas bem-sucedidas vence. Uma rota que permita que todos os players passem ou em que todos morram começa a ganhar marcações negativas pelo próprio jogo e, após algumas rodadas dessa situação, é mudado o mapa e começa tudo de novo. Há o placar, e em dado momento são mostradas as colocações de cada um.

Entretanto, o jogo não se leva tão a sério. Por exemplo: algumas armadilhas são invisíveis, o que faz com que apenas a morte de alguém a revele. Ser eliminado do jogo em determinadas situações é inevitável, enquanto em outras exige habilidade. Dito tudo isso, o jogo às vezes é hilário, e dificilmente é levado a ferro e fogo.

Com amigos, o prazer de ver alguém pisar numa plataforma escondida e ser arremessado para um inferno de armadilhas é arrebatador. É comum ver que as mortes de um jogador foram causadas em sua maioria por ele mesmo, porque em alguns momentos são TANTAS armadilhas que nem quem colocou consegue lembrar de todas. O caos gerado é divertido, insano e, na minha opinião, vale ter o jogo na biblioteca, até mesmo pela possibilidade de coop local.

A while back Geeky Hobbies looked at the game Ultimate Chicken Horse. What I enjoyed about that game was the fact that players created their own platforming levels where players added new obstacles in order to mess with the other players. What Ultimate Chicken Horse did for platformers, Trapper’s Delight does for puzzle games. While it is not perfect, Trapper’s Delight is already on track to be a satisfying party game.

Let me preface the rest of this review by saying that Trapper’s Delight is purely a multiplayer game. I don’t even think you can play the game without other people and I don’t know why you would want to anyway. Trapper’s Delight is the type of game that is meant to be a multiplayer game as that is the best way to enjoy the game. The game can be played split-screen or online. Personally I think the game works better online since you can’t tell what the other players are doing with regards to traps like you could playing the game split-screen.

Although you can play the game with anyone online, I would recommend playing the game with friends and family. While the game would still work playing with strangers, it would probably be best enjoyed playing with other people you know. The more people playing, the better. I believe playing with friends and family is best because the game thrives on being able to laugh at yourself and your friends/family as you fall into traps or lead the other players into traps. It is surprisingly satisfying watching another player walk into one of your traps when they have no idea what it going to happen. It is even better when you create a chain of traps that work together to kill the other players. Even though it is embarrassing, it is even funny when you run into your own traps that you forgot you placed.

At this point the variety of traps is pretty good. You can really mess with other players by placing a trap in just the right place. A player could have a safe path to the flag and one trap can mess it all up. The game is even more enjoyable if you play with more devious players. Some of the traps can be placed in the trees which make them hard to see if you’re not paying attention. Then there are the hidden traps which are the best traps by far since no one can see them coming, sometimes even the player who placed them. I kind of wish the game would make the hidden traps a little more common since they are the best part of the game right now since it is funny to see/hear the reaction of the other player when they step on a hidden trap.",1520446935,1520446935,True,2,0,0.542857170104980469,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Das hört sich einfacher an als es ist, denn bevor es los geht darf jeder Mitspieler diverse Fallen im Level platzieren, welche den Weg zum Ziel erheblich erschweren. Lustig wird es immer dann, wenn man seine Mitspieler beobachtet wie sie zielstrebig in die eigens platzierte Falle und somit in den sicheren Tod steuern. Denn es gibt nicht nur sichtbare sondern auch unsichtbare Fallen, die erst aktiviert werden, wenn ein Mitspieler auf das Feld tritt. Das kann dann schon mal im schadenfrohen Gelächter enden. 

Erreicht ein Mitspieler das Ziel bekommt er einen Punkt. Sobald mehr als ein Mitspieler das Ziel erreichen kriegt niemand einen Punkt und in der nächsten Runde können alle wieder Fallen platzieren. Wenn drei Mal hintereinander keiner das Ziel erreicht wird automatisch das Level gewechselt. Natürlich lässt sich ein Level irgendwann mal so mit Fallen verbauen, dass es unmöglich ist das Ziel zu erreichen. Das Gute allerdings ist, dass man nicht nur Fallen platzieren kann, sondern auch Felder wieder von Fallen neutralisieren kann. Beispielsweise lassen sich mit einem Sprungbrett Fallen oder Abgründe überspringen oder neue Felder im Level platzieren. Dadurch entstehen immer wieder neue Wege und das Ziel bleibt erreichbar. 

Man bekommt eine Menge geboten für sein Geld:
- 4 Player Couch Multiplayer
- 4 Player online Multiplayer
- Single Player Kampagne
- Steam Workshop mit einer Vielzahl an Leveln aus der Community
- Leveleditor
- Die Entwickler fügen immer wieder neue Features hinzu (neue Fallen, Game Modes, etc.)

Many of you have probably player UCH, which is a frantic game with no time limits on rounds, but utilizes platforming mechanics, traps, and coins as each person vies for the top score. Trapper's is similar in some of these regards, but differs on multiple key aspects:

First, the graphics of Trappers is a 3d-Poly design versus the drawn 2d graphics of UCH
Trappers has a time limit on rounds, but also the pace of movements is 'calmer' and more strategic
You can misdirect trap placement with Trappers by holding A and then moving the cursor, which is especially useful for one time use traps. These mechanics and traps like these are generally not present in UCH.
Coins and trap deaths increase you score in UCH, in Trappers, you instead build up a separate meter that helps you get more powerful/unique Supertraps.
Both games have a sort of balancing feature where offered items per round seem to vary if everyone performs poorly. However, Trappers still lets you build up to Supertraps if you get kills with your traps or collect coins. With UCH, the coin is only valid if you reach the goal with the coin.
Both games have built in level editors, but Trappers you download any number from the Steam Workshop, whereas with UCH you choose four for quick access with a Code system.
Trappers has a steeper learning curve with it's mechanics. I have found that UCH holds a better reception for a wider audience, but my matches in Trappers with people who enjoy it are more intense and exciting.
Stalling/camping is a viable strategy in Trappers: you can get ahead and then make the map impossible. This is theoretically possible in UCH but not really, especially without knowledge of a defined round count.
There is no autobalancing in Trappers, also, it is possible to individually customize your character but it is hard to really see what customizations you have done, and your sprite/avatar is relatively small to begin with.
UCH operates on a single level map for the entirety of the match, Trappers cycles through multiple maps in your playlist after a set number of failed tries on a map. This keeps gameplay somewhat fresh, especially if maps are made impossible.
UCH has multiple modes, but you cannot individually enable/disable traps. Trappers allows you to precisely select each trap you like or dislike, and has lots of fine tuned customizations available for the mechanics.
UCH maps tend to be more sparse, and rely upon platforms and moving objects to build a path to the finish. Trapper's maps tend to be finished maps with built in traps by default, but bridges and secret bridges are available.
UCH traps are always visible, Trappers has some traps that are invisible and others that blend well with surroundings.
UCH has fun dancing animals, although Trappers has a fun win screen.
Trappers has theoretical support for 8 players where everyone speed runs a map and no extra traps are placed. This mode is OK, but only really works well with certain maps. UCH does not have this feature nor would it benefit from it.
UCH has a higher sticker price but does occasionally go on sale, I got it from Humble Bundle so that was great. Trappers has a lower sticker price and may go on sale for a cheaper price.

Overall, while these comparisons may seem biased in favour of Trappers, especially with my longer experience owning and playing it, the real purpose of the comparison is to show the various differences between this game and another well known game with a similar concept but very different execution. Both are great games and I would personally recommend buying both games, keeping in mind which audiences are best suited for each, and that both don't have single player gameplay.",1491631496,1491631496,True,6,0,0.596860110759735107,0,False,False,True,False,,,

フレンドと数時間プレイした感想です。
　
ゲーム内容自体にはとても楽しくて満足です。
一緒にトラップを仕掛けるターンが設けられた後、
一斉にスタートして誰かが脱落した中でゴールにたどり着いたら1ポイント。
そして5ポイントで勝利となります。(設定で変更可能)
またコインを集めたり、1番最初にゴールするなどで別のポイントが溜まり、
数ポイント溜まると次のターンで強力なトラップが置けます。
　
あまりに難しすぎてゴールする人がしばらく現れないと
リセットして別マップに切り替わるのも泥試合になる事を防げて良いです。
　
目に見えるトラップを並べて難しくするのも良し、
隠れるトラップを置いて相手を疑心暗鬼に陥れるも良し、
自分しか知らない隠し通路をコツコツ作るのも良し。
仲の良い友達とボイスチャットを用いて遊ぶと盛り上がります。
　
ただ一つ難点を挙げると、現状プレイヤー数が非常に少なく、
単独でマッチ部屋に混ざろうとしても滅多に部屋が立っていません。
なので今のうちはフレンドとプレイするべきだと思います。
改めて、ゲーム内容自体は面白いので今後プレイヤーが増えれば
評判のゲームになれると思います。おすすめです。
　
あとタイトル画面のBGMが個人的に気に入ってます。

-When first playing, the UI is very in-your-face and the scoring system isn't easily discernable (thankfully, everything is explained in-depth in the help menu, but having to navigate there on first play makes this neutral)

-Relatively small amount of traps / tiles (could be remedied in the future via updates or possibly community involvement)

I played this with multiple family members on local multiplayer and it was a lot of fun. This is a great game if you have multiple controller devices to use (e.g. a keboard and a gamepad). There's also a bit of game rules customization. You can exclude certain traps and pick which maps will be played on. It's a little difficult to view the maps you're choosing since they are tiny, but it's doable.

[h1]There's a Level Editor now![/h1] You can make levels and upload/download them from the Steam Workshop! I think if people make challenging maps that you can do by yourself, this should solve the problem for singleplayer content in this game. I made a few challenge and puzzle levels myself and I think this game now has the potential for great content creation independent of the developer making it. Speaking of the level editor, it's really simple and easy to use. 

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
I absolutely recommend this game [b]if you want to have an open party experience.[/b] For online multiplayer, I haven't seen any open servers so I can't recommend it if you don't plan on playing with people you don't know online. However, if you want to try playing challenging premade levels from the workshop, I think there will be more good content like that in the future. I don't think the levels will get too complex, though, but we will see how that turns out.

[h1]Local Multiplayer Building Phase[/h1]
If you want to know how the building phase in local multiplayer works, basically everyone builds at the same time, but since you are so focused on where you are placing your traps, it is hard to cheat and look at other people's traps unless you finish placing all your own.

[h1]Do I recommend this game? [/h1]It's a resounding yes! Play with friends IRL in local multiplayer, and download levels off the Steam workshop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I always love a good trap, who doesn't, this game looked interesting right off the bat, I love the idea. 
I played this with my daughter and we had fun, So the local multiplayer was cool, the Biggest Gripe I had was the time before you begin to set up traps is really short, and with not much of a tutorial it takes a few times to figure out whats goin on, but once you figure it out its not that bad.
Music is a nice juanty tune, I dig it. The Game has online play too sadly, no one was online when I played tho.
Would be nice if they offered a 4 pack of this at a discount to hook your friends up with copies.
The Character design is a cross somewhere between minecraft and cross road, more like cross road tho, and that is kinda exactly the way you move one block at a time.
The Art style is the same way, Blocky on purpose but it works for the gameplay.
Overall the Gameplay is fun, but I really hope the online community puts out a ton of levels and lots of people play as having more levels and players is what will ultimately make or break this game for me.
As of now it is still fun to play, But Id recommend picking up a copy for a friend if you don't have anyone local to play with.

Pros:

+ Local Multiplayer
+ Online Play
+ Trading Cards
+ Achievements 
+ Partial Control Support

Cons:
- Kinda Cheesy
- Not alot of time to set up traps
- Not much of a tutorial

[h1]TL:DR[/h1]

Trapper's Delight is a lot more entertaining than it looks. Build traps to stop your friends from reaching the end of the course but also trying not to fall for your own traps. Only negative is lack of players. A good game, but best to play with friends, unless you like playing by yourself.

[i]Now for the full review...[/i]

Trapper's Delight was made rather well for an Early Access game. It's turned an idea so simple into something thats higly memorable and amusing. The main objective is to reach the end of the course whilst avoiding traps that you, and the other players have placed. Each round you get 4 placeable items. These always include a coin, and almost always a bridge to go over water or lava, with the other 2 being randomly selected traps. Before a round starts you have the opportunity to place these items in places where you think the other players might fall for. When a round starts, it's all played in real time, meaning you move with the other players.

The game prompts you to read the other players movements and find a safer route through the course. If the other players die and you survive, you get a point. First person to reach 5 points, wins overall. However, if all players survive, no one gets points. If all players die 3 times in a row, the map changes. Players get rewarded with stars for each milestone they achieve such as most coins collected and closest distance to the finish. Every 5 stars gives you a super trap which is a special type of trap.

There are dozens of maps and traps in the game making it possible for many different trap combinations to be made to fool other people. What makes this game even more challenging is that some traps you can't actually see, but are triggered when you go near them.

One of the most interesting parts of the game I found was the ability to customize your character. There are dozens of different customization options, ranging from changing the colour of your clothes to putting hats on your characters. Some people might not really be that interested but I think it's a nice feature to have.

The maps are set on a grid with little bits of detail such as grass, trees, walls, water and lava. Each map varies in layout. Some traps you can place in trees and walls. Graphically the game doesn't actually look that bad. It's very colourful and vibrant. Sure it may not be HD but it's nice to have a basic looking game for a change. The game's UI is layed out perfectly well in a way that shouldn't be confusing. The sound effects for game are neatly done, besides the annoying main menu theme that will probably drive you insane.

The only main negative I can give this game isn't really a fault of the game. It's the lack of players. While the game prompts you to play with friends, people might not have friends who play this game, and because of that, you'll very likely be playing by yourself, and avoiding your own traps, which in my opinion gets boring really quickly. 

Being an Early Access game there isn't much content, but I can see updates being made to the game so I doubt this will be an issue for much longer. The game runs smooth and shows great promising. Me and my friend had many laughs playing this game, and it's definitely something we would gladly go back to. A nicely made game thats definitely worth your money.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- Amusing
- Challenging
- Runs smooth
- Nice customization system

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Lack of players

[h1]==========================================================
---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Note: Trapper's Delight is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was Early Access Build 100.

Trapper's Delight is a multiplayer casual party game for up to four players. Dodge your way around your friends' traps to reach the goal, while laying your own to prevent them from reaching it as well.

[h1]==========================================================
----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Graphics - The graphics in Trapper's Delight are fairly low in polygon count, but do a great job. The game is played from a three-quarter overhead view with free rotation, but only minimal manual zoom and no tilt. Each level is tile based, but many of the tiles are animated, with trees and plants blowing in the breeze, water seething gently against the walls in waves, and traps animated appropriately.

Player characters are blocky and only customisable in very minor ways, but what they lack in individual personality they more than make up for in their eagerness to run the gauntlet of traps straight to their doom.

Interface graphics are big and colourful, and the little fade in and other effects for popups and the like work very well. It's a professional-looking game.

Graphics options are relatively minimal, but functional, with an overall detail level, coupled with the normal resolution and screen mode settings. I encountered no performance issues while playing.

Sound - Music is good, but it's from Incompetech, so that's not surprising. The title music is a particularly good fit, especially since the title animation looks like it's been timed to fit with the music. Another nice touch with the music is the play speed increase when the current game round timer is about to expire, invoking a brief sense of panic.

Sound effects are functional. I'd like to see (hear) the addition of some death sounds from the chirpy little player characters, as they currently remain silent even while being impaled, roasted, or otherwise fatally inconvenienced.

Gameplay - Trapper's Delight is a sort of casual party game. It is multiplayer only and with the current very small player base, finding a game is very difficult. Not having any friends on Steam who play the game, I've thus only been able to play a game by myself, which completely defeats the purpose. It has allowed me to see how the game works, though.

Each game is divided into a number of rounds, with each round involving two timed phases: trap setting and movement. In the trap setting phase, you use WASD to move the camera around the tile-based level and the mouse to place and rotate traps chosen from your trap inventory at the top of the screen. Once players have run out of traps or time for trap placement, the game enters the movement phase, in which you use WASD to move your character through the level, trying to be the only character to reach the goal at the other end. The fun and the challenge come from trying to place traps in such a way to make the other players' characters die while you navigate your way to the end safely.

Each round in which not everyone reaches the goal awards a point to those who did reach the goal, and restarts back in trap placement and then movement again, repeatedly, until someone hits the target score. If all characters navigate safely through the level then no one scores. If no one navigates safely through the level before the timer then it is counted as a failure for that level. If this happens often enough then the level is thrown away and a new level is loaded.

The traps available are nothing too out of the ordinary, but are good fun, ranging from lava tiles, to push or jump tiles, pit traps, spiked walls, and a collection of others. I'd like to see a lot more, perhaps unlockable through successful plays, but this is a good start.

There's a really good help system with text and demonstration videos showing how to play the game and use a number of the traps, although there are a number of grammatical errors in the text, which is a bit disappointing.

[h1]==========================================================
-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Pros:
+ Great idea and (mostly) very professional and 'clean'
+ Help system is excellent, apart from the errors in the text.
+ Excellent use of Incompetech music; particularly the title music and playback speed adjustment when time is short
+ Cute and colourful graphics with nice animation touches

Cons:
- No one is playing; it's very hard to find a public game
- No bots, so no way to play single player when you can't find a game
- Timer for each phase is too short, especially for beginners. This should be adjustable by the host.

[h1]==========================================================
--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Trapper's Delight looks like a great fun party game for a group of friends. Unfortunately there is no one playing it at the moment, so unless you buy it for your friends, there's a good chance you won't be able to play it at all!

For this reason I just can't recommend it to the general Steam populace at this point in time, but if the playerbase picks up I'd love to be able to revisit it and actually play a game.

ただし、キャラクター同士で攻撃しあうような要素はなく、心理的なトラップのカモフラージュ、トラップ設置場所の記憶力、操作精度で競い合います。

久々にプレイすると数十ステージのシングルが追加され、ワークショップによるステージダウンロードなども充実していたので、おすすめするに評価を変えました。定価はもう少し下げてほしいですが…

ちょうど日本語も来ましたね。日本でも流行るのを期待したいところです。

[h1]良かった点[/h1]
トラップで対戦相手をハメたり、トラップを潜り抜けてゴールを目指すところの、基本的な魅力があります。ある意味死にゲーですが、マルチならばストレスが軽減されます。

同じマップで何度か繰り返して遊ぶのですが、毎回トラップを追加していくので、前ラウンドに対戦相手が通ったルートに罠を仕掛けたり、気づかれにくい抜け道を仕込んでおいたりすることができます。ここはUltimate Chicken and Horse的ですね。
最終的にトラップだらけのカオスな状態になるのがまた面白いのですが、誰もクリアできなくなってくると自動でリセットするシステムが用意されています。

また、1ラウンド終わったあとにリプレイが入るようになっているので、まれに対戦相手がおもしろい死に方をするところを見ることができます。

[h1]悪かった点[/h1]
プレイヤーは少ないので、Discordやフレンドを駆使して対戦相手を探す必要があります。

内容の薄さから言って定価500円前後で、セール時にフレンドにばら撒ける価格ならよいのですが、実際はセール時に500円になる程度なのと、公式サイトに4パック3000円のがあるだけです。

また、罠ゲーといえば影牢シリーズのようなコンボによる爽快なトラップを思い浮かべますが、演出は地味めです。
一応トラップをチェーンさせられますが、もともとローポリゴンのシンプルなキャラクターなのであっさりしていて、間によるシュールさなら味わうことができます。",1469256194,1529939154,True,6,0,0.572508454322814941,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have not played UCH, but if you liked that game you'll probably like this one.

If you havent:
Trapper's Delight is a fantastic party game where players are set on a randomly selected grid filled with passable tiles, trees, walls, and water (which will kill you). 

Every round, you're given ~3 traps/bridges/jumper tiles and a coin to place anywhere in the field to both kill your opponent and avoid their traps. 

This repeats until the map is too riddled with traps for anyone to reach the finish line and then resets, repeating as such until X rounds pass or someone wins a certain amount of rounds. 

The game has fully functional local, online, and LAN multiplayer, and is entirely based around it. I dunno if it has single player, but the game's not meant to be played alone anyway. We've played 4 rounds total and have never once ran into any kind of network issues with online play, which is a huge plus.

The game looks pretty basic Unity, with low-poly characters and very little detail or animation. This actually makes the game better, as the cleanness of it all makes it a lot easier to understand.

The soundtrack/music is awful. I recommend listening to your own music instead.

Despite being early access, this game is fully functional in its current state and I didn't even realize it was EA until I wrote this review. I'm actually really happy it's EA, cause this means I'll have a reason to come back to this game every few weeks/months.

Honestly, if you have friends to play with pick this game up. There are few games that get me to laugh as hard as Trapper's Delight, and that alone is why I'm writing this review.",1468977769,1468977769,True,17,0,0.631765425205230713,0,False,True,True,False,,,

Basically in Trapper's Delight you and the other players are trying to get to the other side of the map. That would be an easy task except that you and all of the other players will be placing traps to try and stop your opposition from making it to the flag on the other side of the map. 

Trapper's Delight is the type of game that is going to work really well with groups that like playing party games where they can mess with the other players. It is oddly satisfying setting up a trap and watching your friends/family walking into it. It can be just as funny when you forget about one of the traps you laid and you end up killing yourself. 

While the game is not perfect yet, it is already fun and shows a lot of promise. The game is not the type of game that I would play for hours at a time but it is a game that I would play for an hour or so and then come back to another day. While I hope the game adds some more traps, I think the game already is pretty polished.

If you like party games where all of the players try to mess with one another, I think you will enjoy Trapper's Delight.

相信大家或多或少都应该听说过或玩过一款互坑友尽类游戏，例如
《鸭王争霸赛Duck Game》，
《不动就会死move or die》，
《究极[strike]激活码[/strike]鸡和马Ultimate Chicken Horse》.
而这款游戏方式比较贴近Ultimate Chicken Horse，可以说是低模俯视视角版的究极激活码，
是以陷阱为主，操作为辅的一款友尽游戏。

这款游戏的特点就是陷阱很多，非常非常多，种类也五花八门，[spoiler]以及看不见的陷阱[/spoiler]
而且全是坑人的陷阱，一个走位失误就免费回城。
不像究极激活码，大多数情况下每回合每名玩家只能放一个陷阱，
这款游戏每回合每人可以获得三个陷阱，以及一个金币[spoiler]xiàn jǐng[/spoiler]供你差遣。
如果你赢了某回合，或者捡到了金币，各会获得1个星星奖励
累积5个就会获得额外陷阱，
而未使用的陷阱也可以保留，最多攒9个，
这样一来你就可以在一回合内搞突然袭击完全堵死一条路！
而且陷阱也会一直保留，于是数个回合之后，原本人畜无害地图就变成了I wanna be the guy哈哈哈
当然如果地图太鬼畜了，没有人过得去的话，连续如此3回合后就会刷新地图。

也有一些缺点，目前游戏地图比较单调，游戏模式也只有这样一种，可能玩过几次后就会失去新鲜感而没有意思了。
[spoiler]以及失去了你最好的朋友而孤身一人[/spoiler]

这是一款非常适合与基友互动娱乐的小游戏，主播组队更有对喜剧效果886%倍的加成。
游戏时请务必和基友开语音（话说语音软件推荐Discord，比某Y不知道高到哪里去了）
游戏还自带动图GIF生成功能，但目前好像不是很好用的样子
[spoiler]但如果你像我一样孤身一人，并没有基友可以陪你一起玩的话，那你就只能左右互搏暗自YY了QAQ[/spoiler] 

[strike]此外这款游戏本地模式不能单人进行(本地模式不能使用键盘)，且需要额外手柄，只有在线模式可以使用键盘以及单人游戏[/strike]
7月25日已经更新了对键盘的支持

I think all concepts of this game are solid and in a workable state, a lot of them could be greatly increased upon. But that's why it's in EA. Great potential here.

For me, this is a pretty pure distillation of the concept of ""just one more match"" multiplayer fun, and still sees a lot of time at parties and with friends (and will continue to into the future I'm sure). Place both hidden and visible traps, try to get to the other side. Simple concept, but with persistant traps building up and the decision between using your traps to help you or harm others, strategies and trickery emerge fast. 

The thing I maybe love best is the type of friendship-ruining moments that the best multiplayer games have. One moment you're triumphant as you catapult your friend into lava, then suddenly you are getting laughed at for walking into a wall of spikes. Couch especially, with the fact you're able to fake-out and use mind games when placing traps adds a different layer to the play, and means that couch and online games with the same people have a whole different feel. 

Throughout the playtesting the dev has been open, responsive and quick to fix things, and I'm happy to see this seems to be continuing! There's a few features I'm hoping get implemented as time goes on, but there's a lot of fun already here, and I think it's definitely worth the price.

I have put a ton of hours into this game as it has developed off steam (hence the generally low play time here), and I love showing it to people when they come over. This is definitely a game that has been and will continue to be requested to play at gatherings, and I'm excited for the future.",1468933607,1468933607,True,7,0,0.547410845756530762,0,False,True,True,False,,,
