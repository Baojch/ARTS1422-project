Does that bother me? Nope.
You are a civilian trapped in a warzone in jungle environments trying to escape.
Simple premise, not so simple game.
How you escape is up to you. There are various ways (which I have not accomplished yet) to make your getaway.
The main game can be very tense as you trek through the jungle, scavaging for food, water, and weapons to survive.
Making your way hoping an angry hostile isn't creeping around the next turn.
Just because you shoot someone does not mean they just intantly die. Numerous times I have shot an enemy but it was not a fatal shot and they got back up and killed me.
Same goes for you, you may think you died but you stumble up, screen tinted red as you try and find where the shot came from.
The game has some interesting mechanics that reinforce the fact that you are not some military tough guy.
Some things that I do not like though are how you can't put a pistol from an equipped slot back into your inventory without first dropping it.
You can only have 2 equipped weapons and no ablility to put large weapons in inventory (which makes sense)
A way to unload a gun would be nice as well.
There is another part to the game called Operation Freetown which is a more ""shooter"" experience.
You are a soldier behind enemy territory all alone. Pretty fun, let's you play around with the mechanics and guns without risking anything on your survival playthough.
Be warned when you start the game it loads everything, so depending on system it could take awhile.
Putting it on an SSD sees massive loadtime improvements.

TL:DR
Fun game, shows promise. Dev seems to care about his game (solo dev team)

I will not recommend this game at this time. I understand very well its EA and a WIP but the Progress does not seem to be far along.

Positive or negative, constructive feedback is always welcome. However, the two games are quite different. I have not played subsistence, although it has been on my wishlist for some time. The main difference I perceive between the two is unlike most games, mine pushes the player into moving. Staying and setting up camp for a couple of days in game is usually the maximum you'd want to hang out at one safehouse. In a later patch, this will be enhanced even more by attacks being mounted on safehouses you're camping out at for too long. But for now, there is the fact that your supplies will dwindle and you cannot simply craft a gun or grow crops in a matter of days, so you must keep moving. After all, the only goal is escape, not to set up a fortress. But at the end of the day, the game is really designed around constant movement, and a ""turtle"" approach won't make for much fun. It's really a matter of taste whether you like this style or not, I can appreciate base building games as well, but a big focus in this game is to get to the main island and get a vehicle to move around it rapidly.

As for updates, I've been doing them almost weekly for the past 5 months, I would like to do more but I'll admit they haven't been as comprehensive as I'd like them to be. I've been busy looking for a second job to help fund the project further for things such as voice actors, etc.

P.S. Have you tried Operation Freetown? It's pretty early right now, but next patch it'll be a lot more playable. Instead of jungle combat it's urban and the AI don't have many places to hide. Also there are no NPC's that have handguns, so looking for a handgun on a dead body will be a fruitless task."

Escape: Sierra Leone is a tough game in its own way, the AI is accurate and deadly, Balistics are well simulated, food and water are scarce, the protagonist is Joe Average with no special skills or a gift of divine destiny. What makes this special is that it puts you the player into a mess of trouble where you and your actions really make the success or break it.  Stealth is the order of business and a gung ho frontal assault is not going to get you much but a bullet in your gizzard, however in the right moment with  luck and surprise on your side it might be just the thing needed to move forward. Be warned, realism is a pain in the rear. You can carry about a dozen items and will have to make some hard choices about what to take and what to leave behind as you travel. I guess the best I can do is list some pros and cons and let you decide for yourself whether this game is your flavor.

PROS: 
Smooth graphics
immersive environment
simple controls (though see below in cons for some comments)
interesting crafting as well as hunting and fishing
challenging but attainable goals
Developer is VERY active and interactive, take constructive criticism well and CARES about the game and players.
Open world / sandbox that does not hold your hand or give you beacon style goals.

CONS:
Inventory system: The inventory can be frustrating in that unless you follow a very precise sequence of action you will constantly be tossing items on the floor as you attempt to switch items. While most games have an 'auto rotation' that automatically puts away one item when switched for another, this game does not really work that way. Sometimes small items will rotate into the pack sometime not (and the when or why is not very clear).
The inventory has slots for roughly a dozen small items (backpack)  and then a single large slot (hands) that is your ONLY hot slot. What I mean is that it represents what you are carrying in your hands and while you have two items available in this large slot (one holstered and one active / in hand) they may be a combo of large items like rifles and a small item like a pistol.  If you have in your hot slot two 'large weapons' (rifles, ammo boxes for extra items, shotguns, fishing rod, sleepingbag etc) and you pick up an item or rotate something out of your pack that is classed as a weapon you will toss the in hand item on the ground. many times I had my pistol in hand (fits in my back pack) and my rifle holstered yet when I picked up an item it did not put my pistol in my pack, it tossed it on the floor.
I could then pick up the pistol from the floor and it went directly into my backpack....
there is a key to drop items but no key I could find to put something from your hands back into your packnor can you drag and drop from the hand slot to a pack slot.

Lets say I have a pistol in my backpack, a rifle in my hands and no second item in my hot slot / hands. If I decide I want to use the pistol I must open my inventory, then 'holster' my rifle, select the pistol in my backpack and thenchoose 'use'. This moves the pistol into my hand.  No problem, now I can use my mouse wheel while in play to switch between the rifle and pistol. However when I open the inventory, the item that shows in my 'hand slot' is the holstered item, not the active item. This is counterintuitive and can lead to confusion. Furthermore it is not uncommon to pick up a weapon only to have the weapon in your hands thrown on the floor even though it would fit in your back pack (proven by the fact that one can immediately pick the item up and have it go directly into one's pack). Frankly after 8 hours of play this confusing pack - floor - hands system had me frustrated as heck. The interface needs two hot slots / hand slots, one that is highlighted as the active item and one for the holstered item, in addition it needs to allow a drag and drop movement between slots.

This said, I would still concider this one of the greatest games I have ever played.",1491193840,1491193840,True,14,0,0.659429788589477539,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This one will not be for everyone. Of my friends, and no cut on them, I can safely say it wont be a large number of them enjoying this. 

It is an EA I noticed sometime ago. Like most of us these days I try and watch a bit before I grab one.  That doesnt always work out still, but every now and then.. yeah, it does. This is one I am glad at this point I grabbed. Even in the worse case scenario, its got enough going to make it worth the while now. But on that, the Dev is active ( yeah, also normal during the early days.. ) But! This Dev is not only acknowledging and commenting on bugs, and suggestions, he is working them. The record so far is "" That is a great idea.. I am adding it "" and it happens. "" Wow, thats a bug I totally didnt think of.. "" and its fixed.  Plus he has been brutally honest. Its a one man show. He is working on this project. He does not have $$$$$ to use at once. But what he is doing, is using it wisely so far. So.. Far..  I stress that because looking over the information, the guy wants to make this game. He is making this game. He has not been distracted so far. 

Now onto the game. It is indeed a survival type game. But unlike that term thrown out so much of late, it really is getting about as close to the RL type of survival that has occured before.  Sure, it is still a game, but it's one that hits close to being life like.
  
To start. Our hero has no uber special talents. No magically acquired skills at building a full blown base / house / fortress. He doesnt know how to craft machineguns out of a pile of rocks and bubblegum.  He is not a wonder ninja. He is just a guy who worked at trying to get by day to day, and was aware of the bad events going on in the RL Sierra at the time frame.. and was hoping to not see the storm of trouble come his way. But it did.
  
The guy is just trying to walk home to fix his boat, and finds the war has come. Now here is where the RL intense stuff starts.. he has nothing. Zip. Nada. The only things he finds at first are what you might indeed find in RL. An ignored handgun, a few dropped magazines, some small food items.. etc. You get the idea. No one man army start. No map, no compass, no GPS etc. 
The only ' unusual ' skill our guy has... he can fly a heli. He only can do that because he was a very basic pilot for a tour company before.  Doesnt help in the slightest tho' at first... since he has no access to a heli just sitting around.

Now, survival. He has to eat, drink, rest, heal and watch his mental state. None of it is magical. If its not food he finds, he has to create it. He doesnt heal instantly from a bandage to a gunshot..  and getting shot hurts.. he staggers, falls.. fails to aim correctly. But so do the bad guys. On the badguys.. they are not some ' how the hell ' ones. They have a reason to be there, they are not uber soldiers, not amazing at what they do.. but if you approach a conflict like a normal game, you die. Simple. Run in like a guns blazing FPS hero... hope your save was not long ago. Because you are dead. Better figure a way to get by, or kill more of them before they gang up on you..  and they dont appear from thin air.. you get the jump on 4 and kill them. They are dead. You get the jump on 4 and forgot to find the guy on gaurd by the trees.. oops. 

Gameplay.. is hard. I looked in on Easy, and played on Normal. No way am I trying out the Hardcore yet. There is a pacifist mode.. which is geared to explore, survive. But honestly, I dont see that holding many peoples attention long. Sure it is all about living minus the rebels.. but there is not that much to craft yet.. and even then, its not a base building survival game. Its a build to survive to get the hell away game. But that mode is great for learning some  of the trickier things.. like INVENTORY.

Inventory. Its tricky at first. Its ' kind of ' realistic in limits. You can only carry so much, which is handled in management vs bulk. You can add to that amount and transport things for storage etc with extra things like an ammo can... but you have to sacrifice a hand..  The inventory is a bit tricky to learn to use also tho'. For example, to use the ammo can you have to hold it. then press fire. Not really complex.. but no documents about it yet. 

Crafting. Its pretty basic. But so far only in the scope of realistic on what you can make. You can make your common mans items. Molotov / food / clean weapons / break things apart. No uber bases or auto cannons... 

He can hunt, find fruit and food left, make a rain catcher ( he cant boil water yet, tho' he can cook. Boiling is coming )

Graphics are not bad at all.. the jungle is thick.. and while a great way to try and sneak around, the enemy cant see you. But you cant see them either. Step out of the dense bush, and dont be shocked to surprise a group standing around. Unreal 4 is the engine at work BTW 

Now on the gameplay. Totally open. As in really and truly open. Do what you want. No maps. No quest target arrows. You are simply trying to either escape the conflict and no one is guiding you on how to do it. Or you are simply trying to get by and live as long as you can .. Also with no help from the game, quest etc. 

Your HUD is not there. Yep. No HUD. Which is good. You have to know how many rounds are in your weapon. You have to know what direction you were facing. You dont know how to read a map? Better figure it out. Plus you better find one. You dont start with that. How many of us walk around with a map and a compass of our state in our purse / pocket? 

So yes. I am loving this concept. Even at this state of EA, missing things, and not being complete. Its worth it to me. Will this be a much loved game? Doubtful. But not because of the game being bad. Simply because this game is saying.. I am not a game of FPS. I am a sadistic journey into how much life can suck if you decide to buck the RL type situation and play one man hero. I will kill you. Often. 

I am liking it. ( Saves can only be done in found safe houses / shacks at this time. Death does go back to last save. So its not perma death.. )",1485976665,1485982185,True,25,1,0.709102988243103027,5,True,False,True,False,,,

1.Great game, Major potential.
2.Has its flaws, But honestly not many right now. 
3.Does lack a variety of ambient life (at the moment)
4.It is actually challenging to a degree, as it's intended to be. 
5.Haven't noticed any major bugs or glitches yet, great work!
6.A.I. Is actually fairly decent so far
7.Lack of A.I. activity though is a bit meh, They need to roam around more, do things when idle, etc
8.Weather is so far pretty nice

Gonna play it more and see what else i could say later on. 

So far so good though! 

As with any early access, it will show its flaws. But the developer is highly focused on this game! So i know great things will come. 

Give it time, i could see this being a solid game with replayability like no other. 

Now, People have suggested PvP, That would be a bit much for this game. 

I do think 2 Player Co-op would be nice though. That's as far as i would go.

So, my first run-through I got shot at by a guy in a hut on the beach roughly SW of the starting point...a mile and a half maybe. So I flank around to the other side. He's still looking where I had been. Damn the hard tiki floor! As soon as I stepped on it he turned around and shot me with a pump-action. I run through and go a bit more right this time and came up on a burning hut/small village of three huts. A dead chick with a battery in her hand and a hole in her head is lying on the ground between the first two. I grab the battery and circle around to get inside the big hut where I discover another dead body holding a .45. Aha and it has three rounds in it! Yay! I head back towards pump-action Al, only this time I come up over a ridge from the other side where I can look down on him better. I see no one else. I sneak as close as I can with my gun aimed at him until he begins to turn around. I fill him with lead!  Inside are another pump-=action, fully-loaded, (8 rounds) fuel and lots of food. Not bad, but I had to quit so I can work-out and get ready to crash. So far, it needs work, but pretty fun and definitely, if you think someone can see you but they haven't fired yet...back off and try to get around them from behind. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

The real life sounds of all the different guns plus the reloads of those guns, how cool.
I think the world has more faint hearts than purple, and I guess alot of them need silver spoons at the beginning of their games.


Quick Update:  Before the original review, I must mention Operation Freetown.  It is a village full of enemies looking to defend their turf.  You are given a high powered rifle with plenty of ammo to start you off.  Smoke bombs, grenades, pipe bombs (with remote trigger), land mines and eventually the good old rocket launcher are at your disposal.
   I killed a handful of guys in the beginning, and now I'm trying to break my record of 17 kills. I recommend this game as a whole but Freetown takes the cake and eats it too. 
   There are also stats that you can monitor during the Freetown operation by pressing esc or just simply receive them when you die. I like stats.


The game is intense folks, search around on the first island not knowing anything or where to go.

   The bush is thick, like real life.  You have to look at the lay of the land to navigate until you find the map and compass.  Even after finding that it only helps you on a minimal scale.

   Finding where enemies are, then dying, and come back to sneak up and kill them on the second try to collect their goods.

   You can only save in certain places, this makes it alot harder which is awesome!

   Your inventory is like real life, maybe ten items you can carry so you're left with deciding which items to keep/drop.

   Very challenging trying to figure out exactly where I am on the map.

   No problem with the graphics, very detailed underbrush, world is beautiful.

   Feeling like a deer in the headlights the entire time as water is limited, actually everything is limited.  

   This game is not for the faint of heart, prepare to die and learn.

   Do I keep these bullets or those bullets?  Which gun should I keep? Do I drop my fully loaded AK-47 for the rocket launcher? My god people!

   Where am I going now? lol

   P.S.  I was ignorant of the system requirements and had some trouble playing,
           the developer bent over backwards for me and resolved my issues!

   Completely Recommended.

Update:   Every battle with the enemies is different, and very intense.  Once I snuck up and shot a guy and he dropped down behind some barrels.  I walked over and looked behind the barrels to collect the ammo and... nothing!

To be fair, the description covers pretty much everything you listed. It is a realistic game, not an arcade shooter. If you want quick strafing and close quarters combat, I'd recommend the new Doom game (which is awesome).

Also it's pretty clearly outlined in the Early Access FAQ that: ""There are small graphical imperfections and other aesthetic issues still to be worked out. Some weapons and vehicles are not in yet, or may have placeholder models or animations... There are also very few side quests, methods of escape, and friendly NPC's. These will all be bolstered as time goes on.""

Also the tagline for the game says right there ""no forced objectives or quests"" as well as one of the points in the description where I outline ""No hand-holding or magical GPS-like maps or arrows to push you to success, it's all you!"" The whole point is to wander around and not be shoehorned into missions. So yeah, do get this game if you like wandering around in the brush with no idea where to go! Avoid it if you want quick gratification and an easy victory.

This game will make you feel that uncomforable pressure in your taint that occurs only when you are at your most stressed. No, you dont have ass-cancer, you are just enjoying a round of Escape: Sierra Leone. 

First of all, the enemies are quite realistic. The affects of obvious cocaine influence is quite accurate to the real deal. I'm not even trying to be funny, or exaggerate, you might find white powder. The fact that I had to worry about finding clean water every half an hour made me feel like this was also an accurate simulation of a Whole Foods patron. Again, this is not a bad thing, its just an additional step that any other game that claims to be HARDCORE BRAH isn't even allowed to relate to. 

The vehicles are a great addition to the game. 3 hours in and I'm rightfully the most priviledged man in Africa. The sense of satisfaction you get when you step into a AH J6 Helo after struggling to find raw fish for 7 fucking days gives you the sense that you may in fact actually be jesus. 

No child soldiers. Now, I know this might be a controversial idea, but I would love to shoot children.

So before this becomes a discussion point, lets just appreciate that this is a scenario where ""either-or"" applies.

In summary, I have enjoyed my time in Sierra Leone greatly. The food is horrible, I have countless diseases, and theres a huge lack of friendly people, causing thoughts of suicide to come to light.

What i love already :

-Unreal Engine 4, really mastered by the dev, day and night cycle, beautifull sun effect, reflections, lightning and foliage, etc etc.
-The sound, audio in general, music, gun sounds, everything is top notch.
-The exploration of the island which is huge, and could even get bigger with time.
-The nostalgic feel of games like far cry and with next gen graphics now.

Overall i strongly recommend !!! Will play more and discover more, really am happy with my purchase !!",1481093242,1481093242,True,18,1,0.519956588745117188,2,True,False,True,False,,,

Little things like the picking up mechanic are wonky as well as some others. Somethings I found great about the game are . . .
- Movement as decent. Did not feel clunky
- Scenery in game is beautiful
- Combat isnt horrible

Now for the things I found bad/annoying
- Picking up feature isnt great. Takes a few taps to get things to pick up
- When changing key bindings, my game stopped working and I could not start a game. Had to quit out and restart.
- When the character is tired (which is always) he breathes heavy which is annoying. All you can hear is him breathing.
- Picking up things while things are equipped is awful. You cant really switch things out
- Couldn't figure out how to unequip my gun.

Just little things like that are annoying but can easily be worked out. Again, I only played for about 30 minutes so I could just of not spent enough time with the controls.

If you're interested in seeing the first half hour of the game here is some gameplay.

I've experienced a bug, but after talking to the dev(Who's a pretty friendly bloke btw) I was assured it was known and already being worked on.


Edit: I take it back, the dev can't be arsed to work on the game anymore from the looks of it",1481017611,1673922443,False,0,0,0.542852699756622314,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The shooting felt pretty damn intense (mostly being shot at) from the AI. Everytime I heard the first shot go off I jumped running to the nearest Rock or Tree trying to hide for cover. Another thing is getting to a weapon trying to kill off the enemy AI they are persistant in keeping everything including there guns but the shooting either with the RPG or Shotgun is very fun. Did a youtube video for what my experience was an I do like this game hopefully more guns or any new ideas are put into this game in the near future... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er4q7soyStY,1481003746,1481003746,True,9,1,0.440938949584960938,0,True,False,True,False,,,
