The games is bugged and still keeps crashing even with the bugfixes to Version 1.1. Playing the white colours it often (still) happens that some white pieces change their colour to full black (which, in chess, can obviosly be  most irritating). 
But worst of all: You can never be sure to end a match, because the game simply crashes occaisionally.
Apart from that. The ChessEninge is not that strong. This game is not for you if you are seriously intersted in learning chess or improving your play. And even if you just want a funny match, ist all gone, when the game crashes. 
So..due to the lack of stability definatly no buy.

Die Idee zum Spiel mit den lebendig werdenen Schachfiguren ist ganz nett. Die Animationen sind auch gut gemacht. Wenn man das aber ein paar mal gesehen hat, wird auch das langweilig und motiviert nicht länger. Zudem ist das Spiel, trotz Update auf Version 1.1, nach wie vor verbuggt. Als Spieler der weißen Steine kann es vorkommen, dass diese unvermittelt die Farbe auf komplett schwarz wechseln (was im Schach ziemlich irritierend sein kann).
Schlimmer noch ist: Das Spiel läuft trotz Patch nicht stabil und stürzt unvermittelt ab. Man kann sich also nie sicher sein, ob man die gerade laufende Partie auch zu Ende spielen kann (es sei denn man speichert nach jedem Zug ab, was aber an sich nicht im Sinne des Spiels ist).
Die Schachengine ist nicht sonderlich stark. Wenn du ernsthaft Schach lernen willst, oder dein Spiel verbessern möchtest, ist das Programm ohnehin für dich falsch.
Es WÄRE was für Gelegenheitsspieler die ein paar spassige Partien machen wollen, WENN das Spiel stabil laufen würde!

people as a whole, don't seem to care to play animated chess.

for a bit, those errors start going away...although fair warning to anyone who might purchase this:
the game has no auto-save, and typically if you're red or black, after turn 5, I would do just that:
save the game each and every round...!!

Pros: 
*the animations are great and funny 
*the game plays like chess
*the AI actually knows what it's doing
Cons:
*Some textures will randomly disappear, leaving the piece holding its weapons in full color, but the soldier itself has turned black. This is forgivable, but please try and work on it.
*The Combat Vault is, for whatever reason, broken. I like good animations, and I don't want to have to play a game to see them again- hence why the Vault should exist. 
*The game will randomly crash. This is inexcusable and needs attention.

In conclusion, this game has one of two options I can see; A, fix the multiple problems in its design and keep its $40 asking price (but I honestly think it's worth $10, as most chess games are), or make it free. Honestly, for the longevity of the game, go with the former.

I've had it constantly crash on me, not even with an error message, just minimizing and dying for no reason. The game also is bound to crash, after changing any of the options, so expect that to happen.

The music does my nut in and I'd highly recommend turning it down before playing. It's not that there is anything wrong with the music itself, more that the music is rather loud and conflicts with the ingame sound effects. Sometimes two tracks end up playing over eachother and given that this is a game that is strategy oriented, it's a major drawback.

Another glitch that I encountered (at least I think it's a glitch, if this isn't then it's pretty poor game design) is that character models can just go all black sometimes. I was playing as the black team and stupidly allowed the bishop to take my queen, because I thought that him being all black signified that he was on my team. 

Otherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes chess. It's nice to see it come to life and the kill animations are pretty funny.

Considering how the developers gave up on this, it's not much of a game at all. You can't even get through a single game of chess without the game crashing, and there are numerous other bugs and glitches that make the game unplayable even if you *can* get through most of a round. Many people-myself among them-were excited about this game. But our hopes were dashed. This ""game"" should either be finished, or taken off the site. It's certainly not worth $30.00; in fact, until it's finished, I don't know if it's worth *anything*. It's just a waste of space. 

I-and the other people who've bought this program-want to be able to enjoy it, and get our money's worth. But I doubt it's even possible to contact the developers. So please, if anyone reading this has the authority to remove this game from Steam, do it. It's a total waste until it's completed.

『Battle Chess』といえば1988年に発売された往年の名作である。言ってしまえば普通のチェスに擬人化アニメーションをつけただけなのだが、当時の水準ではなかなかのインパクトがあり、日本のPCを含め様々な機種に移植された。
そしてこれはそのオフィシャルリメイク。もちろん今の時代チェスならフリーのものがいくらでもあるし、ポリゴンキャラを動かしたくらいじゃ誰も驚かないが、しかしチェスソフトがありふれている時代だからこそ「一つ選ぶならあの怪作の再来を」という声が出るくらいの需要はあったのだ。

かくして2011年に開発がスタートしたわけだが、彼等はほどなく資金難に陥ったらしい。Kickstarterに救いを求めるも目標額の16%しか集まらなかったり、デベロッパが逃亡して別会社に交替したりというすったもんだを経て、ようやく2014年春にアーリーアクセス版が発売された。$9.99であった。
ひとまずはトレイラー通りのゲームプレイを披露できており、悪くはない滑り出しだったと言える。収録コンテンツは少なかったし、リプレイなどの基本機能も欠けていたものの、そこはアーリーアクセスということで今後に期待できる部分だった。

しかし明確な問題が一つあった。とにかくクラッシュするのである。AI相手でも3戦に2戦は落ちる有様であり、ましてやマルチを完遂することはほとんど不可能だった。
それでも最初の一ヶ月はパッチが出ていたのでまだ望みがあった。しかし二ヶ月目には早くもアップデートが止まり、たまの「Sorry for the delays!」という言い訳以外には何の進捗報告もない状態が続くと、さすがに楽観的なファン達も事態を察し始めた。

待つこと九ヶ月。久々に出たパッチは何も変わらなかった。いくつかのバグは潰されたのかもしれない。だが相変わらずゲームはクラッシュしていた。
そこからさらに一年が経過した頃、唐突に製品のステータスが「正式リリース」に変わった。機能やコンテンツは一つも増えなかったが、値段は三倍になった。「今度こそ全部のバグが取れたと思います！」というアナウンスと共に最後のパッチがリリースされたが、相変わらずゲームはクラッシュした。
こうして伝統ある『Battle Chess』のIPは終了した。

先日久しぶりに思い出してこのゲームを起動してみた。5戦中2戦しかクラッシュしなかったので、最終パッチには若干の効果があったのかもしれない。だが三年前から報告されていたテクスチャが剥げるバグは依然そのままだった。棋譜を保存する方法がないのでどんな勝負だったかはもうわからない。


ちなみにSteamで販売されている『Battle vs Chess』は本作とは何の関係もない類似品である。あまりにもまんまだったため版権元のInterplayから訴えられ、アメリカではタイトル変更と賠償金の支払いを余儀なくされている。でもレビューを見た感じ安定性もコンテンツもあちらの方がはるかに優れているようなので、もうあっちだけでいいんじゃないかな？",1492851465,1498481499,False,12,6,0.679128348827362061,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Music plays constantly over the top of fight animations, even with the music for the fight playing underneath it. Not that that would make too big a difference as the frame rate issues cause animation to be jolty and out of sync. The clash of metal after swords are drawing back for their second strike is a little off putting to say the least.

So first, remaining problems I still see:

- still see that odd error message but not until I'm finished and exiting the game, so it doesn't affect play anyway
- except for the dungeon board, still occasionally see a piece blacken - I've seen knight and bishop do this, but now I'm still able to finish the game even then.
- combat vault not activated yet, but not a priority to me
- don't find anyone in any to play in the online rooms, so if anyone wants to, let me know

I would love to see:

- the above remaining things fixed
- trading cards!
- maybe some add-ons with more battle scenes, higher levels, etc, more puzzles, new piece sets, boards, etc
- online activity

Představte si hru, kde se figurky v okamžiku tahu vyřazují ve vtipných animovaných scénkách zcela ve stylu cartoon violence. V tomto ohledu tento remake svůj úkol plní na jedničku, jenže…

Battle Chess velmi dobře převádí staré pixelovaté animace do 3d scén, dokonce přidává i mnoho vlastních, ve vcelku slušné grafice, zvláště srovnáváme-li s originálem, ale platí za to jistou daň. Hra byla velmi dlouho značně nestabilní a padala jako přezrálé švestky, to se už naštěstí spravilo, ale stále přetrvávají některé grafické glitche, kdy třeba figurkám vypadnou textury a jsou pak čistě onyxově černé. I zvuky často zazlobí a kamera by se též dala zvládnout lépe (ačkoliv ta je naštěstí nastavovatelná). Pokud jde o aktivitu v updatech a opravách, tak je to dost špatné, příliš bych na výrazná zlepšení do budoucna nespoléhal. Nicméně hra už konečně funguje a dá se hrát. 

Jádro starých Battle Chess je stále dobré a zábavné, když už vás animace začnou otravovat, lze je případně i přeskočit, takže už konečně mohu, po pekle kterým jsem se hrou prošel, vydat kladné doporučení. Chyby jsou stále, na jiných počítačových sestavách by se mohly, vyskytnou další, takže opatrně s nákupem, případně počkat na pěknou slevu, aby vás ty peníze případně nemrzely. 

Hodnotil bych 4 z 10, ale kdo měl staré Battle Chess opravdu rád a je tolerantní, může si i dva body přidat.",1435019118,1440239324,True,4,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,True,False,,,

There are some key features to the world of Chess that is missing such as a option to request/offer a draw instead of having to force the draw. It came down to King and Rook vs King and Rook which is a draw any computer should take. Instead it forced it for me to exchange the rooks to force the draw.  The game design is nice textures smooth except for a minor glitch and one game crash.  The game does everything that chess player would want, Yet there needs to be more meat to the bone, After seeing all the fights the characters become annoying and old fast and just get in the way and I found my self switching to the classic pieces to avoid confusion. 

There needs to be more of a challenge as the AI seems to be the same on all levels, It grabs what it can and has no ambition and the AI certainly is no Deep Blue.  So once you get passed the New feel, beat the AI and compelete the Skill challenges there is nothing to keep a player from coming back, the multiplayer feature is empty of players, I left it on for a week and no players came in except for 1 admin to see if I was a bot.  So although this game as a lot of sentimental value to me and I'm sure to so many others, unless some major re-vamping is done to the AI and more added to the game, I stick with my chessmaster 10 to tutor me further,  It will be perfect for beginners and new players however more seasonal players and above will just see it smile play couple of games and move on.

The AI never tries to win and just always pushes to draw - and that sums it up for the game. It does the bare minimum leaving a game with a lot of potential, left wanting...

### Pros:
- Nice graphics (3D environment, animations) for a chess game ^^
- Single or multiplayer game
- Training area (but the latter should contain more puzzles)
- Steam Achievements
- I love the sneaky/sly Queen behaviour when capturing pieces

### Cons:
- It often crashes during a game on my windows7-x64 PC … a really bad point for chess software since a game can be very long in theory
- It should be nice to switch between 3D and 2D piece depictions during a game (e.g. 2D for thinking and 3D for capturing pieces, if desired)
- As many others, I don’t like the design of some character (knights look like other pieces, the rook is quite singular but please remove that ugly beer belly)
- More skins should be available for the 2D (standard) pieces, and the latter are not exactly centered on the cases
- I can run most recent games but I have to disable features (anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering) on this game => optimization problems that should be fixed in future.

### Conclusion:
There are currently too many cons to recommend this game … but it could become more interesting by fixing these issues.

10/20

/edit : the crash issue can be solved by disabling anti-aliasing & anisotropic filtering

You don't see actual effort put into things all that much these days. And I'm glad to witness an exception now and again.

Battle Chess, at least for now, feels like a strictly newbie-oriented chess game. The emphasis is mostly put on model/animation variety. It sure does look pretty, animations flow well enough for the most part. Fully-animated tutorial gives you some basic ideas about the rules and history, as well as an actual impression that enthusiasm is strong with these ones. If the developers aim to keep adding new piece textures, boards, clash animations etc. this may one day become the best casual chess game on steam. Not that there's all that much of competition, but you get the idea. What I'd really like to see added to the game is two things - chess-puzzles and some reenactments of history's professional arena matches. Or at least the first one - easy enough to implement, serves a clear noob-friendly purpose, all that good stuff.

Some of the minuses I've encountered so far:
1) Music volume slider doesn't seem to be affecting anything. Sound FX, on the other hand, does.
2) Bishop's voiceover work in the tutorial sucks. A lot. Coincidently, it's also the shortest one of them all. Was it really so hard to get some old dude to do the role that you had to keep it short with what you got?

It only took 5 years for the game to be MOSTLY playable.  I am leaving my original review and update below incase anyone wants to read it..

First of all, I don' think this game is worth the current price of $29.99 considering you can still not play the game to its full potential.  The options are Red V. Blue or Black V White.  Black V. White will still crash your game every time, but I was able to play repeatedly on Red V. Blue without crashing.  I even played on the highest difficulty and left the game running for hours at a time, trying to make it crash (No, my chess skills aren't that good, I used a program to help me to make sure the game would run properly) 

If you are willing to do Red Vs Blue and don't mind the fact that the online multiplayer appears to be dead, then this is a fun game.  I would add it to your wish list and snag it when it goes on sale.  On a side note, I will never buy anything else new by this dev.  The way the dev screwed everyone on this is disgusting and is an insult to the battle chess legacy.




****ORIGINAL*****


After 18 months of waiting for this game to be completed, I am giving up.  This game has been abandoned and I am forced to change my recommendation to stay away.  It's a shame that this game was never finished properly.


If the DEV ever finishes this game and it works, I'll change my review back to positive.


Update:   After owning this game for 5 years, I was able to finally complete a game for the first time tonight.    It seems that the game will run as long as you run red vs blue and not black vs white.  I know the dungeon map was causing issues, don't know if that's still an issue or not.  Either way, I would recommend staying far away from this product unless you're happy knowing that it was a BS money grab by a Dev who abandoned their work, released it out of early access anyway, then trippled the price on a product they KNEW still wasn't working properly.

I think I will avoid any more early access products from now on.  Not worth the risk.",1404437218,1564257285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Still getting the all black characters and crashing errors unfortunately and the game still crashes before finishing more often than not.  Cannot recommend. (updated 3/2/2024)


Original Review:
While still in Alpha I have had quite a bit of fun with the game.

Pro: The animations are fun to watch (I hope more come out in the future they are awesome)  Due to the animations I have been able to get friends who know how to play chess, but are meh about sitting down playing, to actually play again.

Con: I've had one crash so far and the Vault is not working properly yet.

Thoughts: They can likely do very well in the future offering up alternative DLC for skins & animations, ex: Civil War.  Although that would require almost as much work as the game so far (due to all the animations) so wouldn't expect it to be cheap, still might be worth it for more variety.",1403447134,1709421437,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

When I press the windows key on full screen I cannot get back in the game.  And on windowed mode the audio stutters.  I think it still needs more polishing. 

I hope the developers launch a patch to fix this anoyances and then it will be an outstanding game.

There once was a chess game like none others, and it roamed the land of DOS.  It was fun to watch your pieces bash, slash, and dismember each other.  Now the game is back, and so far is just as fun as I remember it.  

Well except for textures dropping, crashes, and other issues.  However as this is early access things like that are to be expected.",1402285234,1506544391,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The cutscenes are painfully long and once you've seen one once you may just feel like skipping over it to get back to your game.  I only played one full game with the animations on.  After that I turned them completely off an just played chess.  These terribly long animations take you out of the game.  I would suggest some short animations on the board which do not require a cut-scene.  I love playing animated chess but i don't want to watch a short film everytime I take a pawn.

Also the game crashes in about 1/4 of the games I play.  From what I understand this issues is getting better.

I only weakly recomend this game because it's still fun to just play chess without animations, and it's early access status still excuses the issues.

The game description advertises that ""it took 2,000 years for someone to make chess better!"" If this is the case, I'd rather be stuck in the stone age than play this game for an additional hour. Save your $10. 

What's to hate about this game? The animations seemed like a great opportunity to introduce some gruesome carnage to the game - however, this is a completely missed opportunity. It's quite slow and the combat scenes leave you wanting for something more - more blood, more action, more... everything. Within 20 minutes, you'll probably be pressing the 'skip' button for both the character animation walking scenes and combat scenes.

I purchased this game with the thought that it might introduce a storyline - something that would make this unique. Wasn't to be found, or I completely missed it all together. 

I played the game for 20 minutes - maybe, I didn't give it the chance it deserved - but within that time I found a bug: my characters clothing were changing colors to the opposing team (from white to black) which made it difficult to distinguish my pieces. I love Chess... but this game... at best is terrible. 

Suggestions might include: allow the use of the ESC button to quit the animations (fast-track) in game and to exit out of the menus. 

This is a poorly designed game from the ground up. Wish I had my money back. I'm not even sure if you could pay me $10 to play this game again - regardless what 'version' or build stage this game is in.

The game itself is still fun as I posted below, but it's FAR from a finished product. I would advise everyone to stay away until Becky and the team release a COMPLETE version. 

While still in its beta stage, Battle Chess is a great throwback to the classic 3D0/Dos classic game of medieval strategy. The 3D pieces are well-animated, with a variety of animations for each capture (my favorite being ""Boogie Knight"", where rather than engaging in outright combat, the knight and queen engage in a dance-off, after which the knight snaps the queen's neck), rather than the single one offered us by the original, or by recent attempts like Battle Vs. Chess. The music fits with the medieval atmosphere, and the voice acting is... okay, though I honestly miss the whiny pawn from the original. 

At this moment there are stil. a significant number of bugs and crashes to deal with, but as previously mentioned, the game is still in beta, and the developers are taking input from the community as they address each. If you can look past the relatively minor bugs, $10 is a GREAT price for this early access game, especially if you are, like I, a fan of the original Battle Chess.",1396534908,1504710186,False,2,0,0.504276931285858154,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My opinion is besides the multiple bugs rapant during Early Access which render the game frustrating to use. (On this side note, the game has only very recently been released, and so bugs are understandable; assuming that they'll be fixed in due time.)

Let me start with thegood. The graphics are great! The silly-at-heart battle sequences, as Battle Chess has been known for, are creative and hilarious, and there were a whole lot more of them than in the previous versions, which played the same single ones over and over again. The design for the skin meshes is very fancy. (My personal favorite's the Bishop.)


And now, ""onward"" to my stark critique.

I feel as if the proud traditions of Battle Chess has been spat on and  replaced with a mocking version which claims to know BC's history but doesn't show it well in its performance. This is speaking especially in regards to the programs ability to play chess; its ""artificial intelligence"" (""AI""), if you will. The ability for BC to calculate moves has been severely dumbed down in GoK. Anyone who has played BC from its beginning (I myself grew up with the 1992-3 version, which I hold very dear to) will know just how damn hard the thing is to beat, even at its NOVICE level: Battle Chess's AI saw EVERY possible move and, more so, every possible opportunity to gain and save material points 5, 6, 7 and more moves down the line; it knew how to schemingly find skewers, pins, double-checks and silent evasive maneuvers that no average good player could humanly find within a few seconds (or even minutes) of thinking. BC has beaten several other excellent chess computer programs, including ChessMaster. It was freakin' frustrating as hell! Such frustrating superior ""AI"" has given BC its reputation. Obviously, such a hard e-opponent is designed to teach you to become a more prominent chess player, even if the defeats are diabolical. 

On the other hand, it was sandbox-easy to beat the Game of King: the powerful tactics as described above simply weren't there. Rather, GoK's tactics, juxtaposed to BC's, were hind-sighted, unholistic and predictable, if not simply lunkheaded. For instance, in a game played at “Nobleman” level, the Black queen captured my pawn on g2, which is undefended by the Bishop on f1 since I moved him out to check the King, and my right-side knight on g1 hasn't previously been moved; an extremely dimwitted blunder on my part; in fact, Battle Chess 1993 was the one to harshly teach such a lesson to me over and over again. I can't even believe that, after years of experience in chess, I would make such a foolish mistake. My restricted undefended Rook on H1 was DOOMED for capture without any immediate opportunity for me to capture back!! Or, was he? The next move Game of Kings played was pawn on f7 to f5 to threaten my other knight on e4. This equally foolish move played by the computr opened up a diagonal line for my own queen on C3 to capture ITS Rook on H8!!! It's almost as if GoK deliberately DID this because it didn't WANT me to lose material points easily. Battle Chess would have never allowed itself to make such a move: unless there was an opportunity to cleverly steal more pieces from me, it would have immediately and mercilessly captured my poor Rook on H1, while leaving none of its own pieces up for danger without re-capture. I thought for a second that perhaps it was some sneaky way to expose my own queen for capture. Hey, after all, Battle Chess is known for its surprise attacks, right? Unfortunately for me, surprise attack against my queen was rarely the case. After I did indeed move her up to H8 to capture its Rook, Game of Kings didn't even seem to bother to try to capture my queen back after 4 or 5 moves. Worst of all, and this is the best part, ladies and gentleman: the black queen never took my easy defenseless Rook on H1! All of this was the ""Nobleman"" level, which was supposed to be Game of King's 4th level of difficulty. I simply closed GoK in dire frustration, knowing that I wasn't playing against Battle Chess; I really wasn't.

I haven't played GoK's hardest level, but I can only imagine that it's barely as good as the original BC Novice level, let alone their level 1, and BC had 10 levels excluding the novice one! I understand that there have been negative reviews in regards to BC's extreme difficulty, pointing to the fact that it's been TOO frustrating that players could never beat it. People obviously want something playable so that they’ll actually buy it. Understood.  On the other hand, I don't think that should be any reason to take out all those difficult levels altogether. Those original difficult levels 1-10 should still be there, in addition to the incorporation of easier playable levels. Again, I can't emphasized this enough: they were what defined the Battle Chess series!!

I've covered the main part of my review, but the ""AI"" is far from the only thing needed be mentioned.

The tutorial is a rather cheesy duplication of the one made in the 1992-3 version. It offered nothing new in explaining chess, and then the mediocre voicing of the characters were pretentious, trite, unenthusiastic and simply uninteresting. The ""sumo-""sized rook, for example, spoke in a rather superficial European accent (Italian?), and one would not feel the threat of his almost-monotonic dialogue, ""If you don't understand, I'll smash you."" (In the original 1992-3 tutorial, the rook had a rasp, crass and intimidating voice that varied in pitches as he emphasized the different words of that same dialogue, which excellently portrayed the sense of threat that he means to.)

Speaking of which, isn't the Rook supposed to be a tower that transforms into a wretched stone beast, not a tactless obese ""Sumo"" guard?? Again, another proud tradition of Battle Chess which has been broken, since in all of its previous versions the rook indeed was a stone beast.

Finally, another BC tradition broken, minor though not insignificant, is the color coding: it appears that OldeSkuul has switched the colorsaround so that red is assigned the BLACK pieces and blue the WHITE pieces. I contactedtheir FB page, and BurgerBecky responded that she will create an update with the option to switch the colors around. So far, no such update was made. (I'm guessing it's on queue to be worked on after the bugs.)

In conclusion, while it's pleasantly enjoyable for a pastime, Game of Kings is as good as any decent chess program and is nowhere near as good as the Battle Chess it’s supposed to be an upgrade from. To save my pride for the chess program that has taught me so much about chess since I was7, I can't call this Game of Kings version ""Battle Chess"". The 1987, 1988 and 1992-3 versions are the ones I feel rightful to call Battle Chess. However, take heart, my word is only the unofficial opinion of one user in the minority, and it's not to discourage folks from buying it. As far as anyone's concerned, it does after all do the job nicely. Furthermore, most of the younger generation will probably not be able to relate to anything I'm saying, since this is probably their first exposure to the BC series. Finally, I'm aware OldeSkuul is putting much effort in making updates to the game. There's always a chance to turn an unofficial negative opinion around. ;)

p. s. I want to extend a note of gratitude to Olde Skuul and express how much I appreciate them having taken on the project to finish Game of Kings when it couldn’t be finished by Subdued Software. I was aware what financial trouble they had to go through to finally gained enough to open the option for online play.

I still remember getting my copy of the original Battle Chess as a young boy and being fascinated by finding out what all the different animations were ... being amazed by the humour behind it (not knowing at the time how much of it was basically Monty Python-esque) and playing against my friends for hours ... Some of the combat animations still make me giggle today when I think of them .... ahh childhood memories ... 

I bought this early access over the weekend with hesitant optimism ... I spent a while playing around with it and the game definitely has promise ... some of the transitions bug out a little bit ... and some of the cuts are a bit jarring ... but the foundations are there for a faithful sequel to the original ... the humour is there (even if some of it feels a little bit forced) ... and there are now multiple combat animations for each 'combination' of pieces! ... What I would love to see is them making it a bit more adult (more blood! more brutal combat animations) even if that is an option you have to select ... and also additional character sets (medieval is already there ... but what about fantasy, futuristic, etc ... how awesome would that be!) ...

I can't comment on the AI yet as I played a game on easiest just to have a look around at how the whole thing fitted together ... but all chess games live or die by their AI so I hope that in this day and age we have a great AI ...

I'll update this review as performance improves.

[Update 4/15/14] Still crashes every game. Gets further with blue/red than black/white. Cannot recommend.

[Update 1/26/15] Decided to give this another try. Game ran very smoothly at top settings, then in mid-game individual pieces would start losing their textures and turning black, then... crash. This has been in Early Access for a rather long time with little to show for it.

[Update 2/12/15] Signs of life! After the latest patch, the game can be completed without glitches under some setup conditions (primarily as Blue vs Red in the Dungeon setting). However the game still suffers from a variety of crashes, especially when playing Black/White, or starting any game with CPU as first player (unless character models are disabled and regular pieces are used.... but that's not really Battle Chess). This is a start, however, and if the fixes start coming in a more timely fashion my recommendation on this could turn around.

The Nice: Nice aesthetic, mostly true to the original look. 3 varied environments. Smooth animation with good options for movement speed. Simple effective in-game interface.

The Meh: Mediocre graphics. Animations have some variety but still rapidly become repetitive. Music is ok but animation music sometimes clashes with soundtrack. All 4 colors have identical faces and wardrobes, varying only in color, which is a lost opportunity in my view. Pieces have impatient shuffling animations to try to add some life but the sounds become annoying.

The Crap: No controller support. Needlessly slow and ugly menus. Lacking in customization options. Crashety crash crash crash.",1395354832,1423792642,False,9,0,0.483513742685317993,4,True,False,True,False,,,

It's brilliant, go to the forum to see my ongoing game diary...

But in short, the great game you remember is back...
Still the same humour... loads of different duel animations...
3D camera or fixed board camera (just like the original version)
Totally adjustable camera (brilliant)

And a really friendly and active developer...

DON'T WAIT - BUY IT NOW!

ENJOY!
