Yes, it is a story of nicey niceness and all the fluffy pink clouds that follow.

Edit: The dev corrected me stating that benevolence isn't always the answer either which didn't make this better for me but further warranted my attention to the game's heavy dialogue sessions which I normally try and click through quickly.

I should note that the novel being forced here isn't as obnoxious as many cookie-cutter JRPG games of recently which use a puppet show of still sprites on  a static background. The text and interactions are spread out more through the course of the game.

The problem lies int he combat. Its like it could be good but there are so many little things that screw it up. The percentage chance just doesn't seem to work, i have never had such bad luck with a game, when all shots are at 80% + to hit. Enemies will almost always survive with 1 health for some reason instead of dying, which gives them another turn to attack and is incredibly frustrating. Its also really really hard, like the third fight i got into i had 4 warriors against about 12, who seemed to be better equipped than mine. At least there is a retreat option.

Possibly an interesting spell crafting system.  But in-game descriptions are completely missing and the codex is an unusable mess.  So there is no real way of figuring out how to do anything in the game.   

Take healing spells for instance.  Characters with high defense resist healing.  So either you make a glass cannon that you can heal,  or a tank that you can't heal.  Either one will get killed by 2 or 3 enemy hits.  Especially since you can only use the heal spell every other turn.  So the magic system is pretty much broken.  The ""correct"" way to play seems to be to cross your fingers and hope the enemy just consistently misses with their 70% hit chance,  because you have absolutely no way of healing and death is permanent.

Casting Teleport is also completely broken.  There is no way to cast the spell,  you can't even teleport 1 square.  To make matters worse,  because of the mechanic to forces you to cast one spell to charge the other,  it makes both of your spells unusable in combat...  Horrible design.  The developer said they were going to fix it a year ago.  Obviously abandoned.

Other elements also suffer from very bad UI.  The game is nice enough to show you a red blinking bar for how much damage you will do to the enemy.  Only problem is it is completely bogus.  The bar will show 100 - 150 damage.  Then you click the enemy...  And 17 damage is done.  Pointless UI.

The balance is also very poor.  At the very start of the game you will face simply battles,  and then battles against swarms rock monsters that can 1H KO your characters.  Very little thought was given to enemy progression.  Some battles are easy,  and some are impossible without scaling your HP. 

It looks like a nice idea,  and maybe it could have worked if they had a UX professional or a competent writer on their team.  As is,  its pretty much unplayable.",1602646005,1603055198,False,24,0,0.737462520599365234,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The aggressive cattleprodding timers add a level of frustration that is simply unnecessary.  I have read the related discussions as to why these exist, and even tried the timer free (and apparently plot free) mode that actually...still cattleprods you along it just does it less.

This delivers in somewhat of a desperation genre for me, being a mixture of XCOM and a medieval/fantasy setting. The game shines in its complexity and freedom of developing your units. It's got loads of procedurally generated gear to loot and equip your soldiers with, which i found fun, but it also becomes a little bit generic.
A positive mention deserves the magic system, which enables you to design your own spells and effects from a number of different modifiers. Clearly a lot of thinking went into that one. 
Graphics, while being somewhat simplistic, totally get the job done. I don't think the game is ugly.
The games campaign is comprised of a lot of different quests, that you can choose to complete and an overarching war campaign, that is tied to a timer. Now that's gonna turn some poeple of, i am sure, but it generates a sense of urgency, that games like that sometimes need, in order to not become grindy.
The negatives i have are mainly the repetitive nature of the fights, with limited enemy types, the art design of your own units (that one might just be a personal preference, though) and the fact, that the game is  sometimes quite unbalanced. You have to find builds, that work and sometimes cheese things a bit. That can be fun in and of itself, though.

The combat system, magic system and strategic layer are top notch - probably some the best Ive seen in this genre. Where the game fails, though, is with the fight design - and it fails hard. It is so bad, in fact, that I am uninstalling the game after I write this review. 

The biggest issue is the opening turn. The enemies always seem to get to attack first - and you have no control (in any form) over where your party members spawn into the fight. That means, with just a little bad RNG (which happens a lot), it is possible to lose 1-3  members of your 4-5 person squad on turn one - before you even start. And, it doesn't really get better from there.  Cover is also done very poorly, attack strength seems to vary from turn to turn for no logical reason, and enemy AI has them pathing illogically back and forth on the far side of the map while you slowly creep your way to their location (after chasing another group to the OTHER side of the map).

Again, the pieces are there, and if the company were to build upon them with better encounter design, the game would be among the - if not the - best in the genre.

My only gripe with this game is that the magic system is not explained particularly well.  Perhaps I accidentally skipped over some load-bearing tutorial text, but I didn't know that I could cast spells more than once so long as I alternate between the expel mode and drain mode of the equipped magurite.

Also, the spell designer isn't as helpful as I'd like.  In a modern game, I expect some helpful tooltips, at the least.  

For example, the ""staggered"" spell modifier: it is intended to convert a spell with duration to a spell that pulses (takes effect every X turns, or w/e).  However, you see it used on spells without duration all the time, by default, which made me suspect that I had some fundamental misunderstanding of what pulsing meant in that context.  Turns out, this effect can be used to increase power of spells without duration for relatively cheap -- increases your spell power by 0.75 per point of stagger, and because the spell doesn't have a duration, the other effect doesn't apply.

I bought the game on sale, but after having played it for awhile, it would have been worth it full price.

Like a number of other reviews state, this is basically medieval X-com. Figuring out some of the nuances of effective builds definitely takes some time, but the game is mostly straightforward to get into. The tutorial does a good job of familiarizing you with the different systems. The magic crafting system is definitely still clunky in my opinion, but there is still a lot of potential.

What really stands out is that Forged of Blood definitely tries a number of new takes that work really well together overall (even with a few rough edges). The lore is intriguing and its just enough to get one invested in the plight of the main character without being overly burdensome; yet, there is definitely a lot of room to expand the world in future installments.

The map is beautiful, and definitely gives you the feel that you are directing a war effort as the pawns representing your parties (or ""Talons"") move to various objectives.

This game is NOT for everyone (But it could be with a few adjustments).

This is a low fantasy conquer-the map style game, with excellent turn based combat and command of 3 battle parties at once. I have been hoping someone would tackle just such a game, and some are doing just that (Like Glorious Companians, Wyldermyth, ect) and this one in particular looks very promising.

But even though I enjoy it, and I am sure fans of the genre will too, its still.....Missing something.

I believe it still needs to be patched and tweaked and added to a bit to be truly stand out, and a game for all. I believe the developers put alot of heart into it, though, and yes it IS enjoyable as it stands but ONLY for  hardcore turn based-tactical game fans looking for a fix. If they would just clean and polish the inventory system, add a wider variety of character portraits and maybe even recruitable portable seige/heavy weaponry, and maybe even low fantasy non human beasts in ""kennels"", and make the ""invasions"" go BOTH ways (attacking AND defending lands. I have never seen them invade! You know, bells and whistles to give the game more character and flair, this could truly be a standout title. Yes, the recomendations can be seen as ""cliche"" but there is a REASON that these features are more common-Because they WORK.

If you already have a long queue waiting though maybe just throw it in your wishlist and wait for a sale.

Combat animation speed can be increased which is such an amazing QoL feature I wish all SRPGS would implement. 

I want to address a couple of the major complaints I saw about this game and explain why I feel they weren't a big deal and were even somewhat positive.

1. Teammates will abandon your cause if you swing too far to any one alignment.
[list]
[*] I understand why this would be frustrating to people but I'm a little surprised it's such a big deal.
[*] First of all, if this is an issue to you they've now patched it so you can control how sensitive people are to your alignment so just go ahead and nerf this feature for yourself, otherwise, it's an easy solve.
[*] Once one or two people leave you start to realize you're doing something wrong so pop open the alignment chart, figure out what direction you're moving too heavily towards, then start making some decisions that will bring you back to the center. 
[*] For me, the first time around, i was being too altruistic. So after I lost a guy I started being a little less giving and started demanding payment for my jobs and being a little more self interested and  after a few of those decisions my team stopped complaining, easy. My second time around I made the decisions from the start, stayed a good balanced leader and listened to my people, and no one left. 
[/list]

2. There is timer and loss conditions in this game.
[list]
[*] You can also turn off this feature so again this is another non-issue. But here are some tips if you want to leave it on.
[*] Once the Summit timer runs out your progress in the main quests so far will determine if you win or lose, much more so than how much of the map you have conquered thought that also comes into play.
[*] You'll want to get two working armies up  and running as quickly as possible so you can pursue multiple threads of the quest at once. 
[*] Once the capitol of a nation is revealed, you can attack that city and upon capturing it, all other cities in that nation will fall under your control as well. This makes a huge difference when it comes time for the Summit so if you notice the timer running near and you're still working on the quests, I would suggest considering just attacking the capitols.
[/list]

3. General tips:
[list]
[*] Support magic > dmg magic for the most part. Increased attack dmg and increased attack # and speed or something are the best. It's been a while since I've played so I can't remember exact names
[*] Both short and long bow archers will mop up the battlefield when buffed with a different spells.

I feel as though there's more I wanted to say but I've been at it a while now so I'm going to stop.
I really liked this game, if you like SRPGS I would imagine you will too.

《Forged of Blood》是一款采用奇幻主题的回合制战术 RPG 游戏。游戏世界因种族之间的纷争和邪恶势力的崛起而处于动荡不安的状态，而玩家所扮演的则是一位王族的次子，因父亲遭人谋杀而走上了一段从难民转变为英雄的冒险路程，玩家必须通过自身的战术应用来重回故土。虽然这是一款RPG游戏，但是游戏并没有坦克、治疗和输出这种铁三角的设定，官方设置通过全武器种类（9 种）开放和非常多变的魔法创造系统带来了非常高的选择自由度，玩家可自由的打造理想的英雄作战风格，也可打造各式各样的魔法来影响战局。

[h1]打破铁三角的RPG，不禁让人眼前一亮！ [/h1]
这款游戏是由来自印度尼西亚的独立制作组：Critical Forge游戏公司独立制作发行的。而这款游戏，在他们2016年正式成立后，便开始着手开发和打造。据开发者日志说，他们在2017年曾经为了足够的资金，而发起过一次众筹募捐。虽然最后结果并不乐观，但是他们还是坚持不懈，砥砺前行，最后在2019的TGS国际电玩展，为大家带来了这款多重意义上都突破了传统RPG风格的独特作品。

在游戏战场上，角色的塑造、转换命令的效率和定位将是胜利的关键。在战场之外，玩家在世界地图上的选择将决定自己王国的命运和人民的未来。游戏中玩家将组建并带领自己的小队前往危险地带展开冒险。无等级的团队组建和战略管理，配合小单位战术，创造了一个多层次的体验氛围，使玩家深入一个奇妙的幻想世界内战的中去。

这款游戏最特别的地方在于，它本身虽然有着典型的奇幻 RPG 元素，但并没有坦克、治疗和输出这种铁三角的设定，他们通过全武器种类（9 种）开放和非常多变的魔法创造系统带来了非常高的选择自由度，玩家可自由的打造理想的英雄作战风格，也可打造各式各样的魔法来影响战局。而游戏除了单一战场的作战外，玩家也得在国土领域上指挥最多三个由各路英雄组成的小队四处直行人物和探索，借此逐一收复国土或是打压对手。而除了世界各个领土会变动外，玩家所作的各种剧情抉择也影响往后的作战行动和走向。

目前，游戏已经走出EA阶段正式发售，笔者还惊喜地发现近日还正式解锁了成就系统。目前售价90元，但是尚无中文。如果是喜欢RPG游戏，且乐于体验新式游戏要素的玩家老爷，可以考虑入手。

The game really suffers from a ""reputation"" system based on Altruism, Hedonism and Rationalism. When given many dialogue options your choices will align with one of the 3 indexes. Every region and character in the game favours some particular balance of all three so whichever you choose you will likely be annoying two thirds of all the NPC's. This results in soldiers getting upset and leaving your army, characters abandoning you and eventually you lose the campaign - which is decided by the AI voting at the end of the game (which is on a time limit in the main story). Even regions of the campaign map you control may not vote for you if they don't agree with the actions you've taken through the game. Fortunately a pure conquest mode has been added to avoid this sort of rubbish if you so wish. But you will be plagued all the way through the game by npc's constantly moaning that they don't like the choices you are making no matter how you prefer to play.

Combat mechanics are not very well explained. Particularly weapon ""range"". The range value does not directly correspond to the number of squares the weapon may reach to on the battle map - so while a sword may have a range value of 2, it only attacks 1 square away. More annoyingly, some melee weapons can attack diagonally while some cant (range 2-3?) and reach weapons cannot attack a target adjacent to you (range 2-4?). Just stick to ranged weapons, its much easier.

Magic is very deep and complex with loads of options for you to completely build your own spells. Unfortunately its also quite restrictive and not worth your time compared to just equipping a bow instead.

Cover doesn't work too well either. Stand behind a chair in a tavern and you get partial cover, but so does the enemy stood in the middle of the room as the adjacent chair that are shooting over counts as an obstacle between you. this is because the game engine takes no consideration of the height of the cover - eg you can shoot and swing an axe through an 8 foot high bookcase and hit the guy on the other side, despite it looking like it should block everything. Same with carts.

Very good skill system I will say, but you will spend a lot of time fine-tuning and respeccing (which is free) your characters skills only for them to leave when they decide they don't like your decisions, or get killed by an encounter thats impossibly tough for your level - there is no warning or indicator or suggestion of how hard an encounter is, you just learn the hard way.

[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]
Forged of Blood is a mixture of strategy and RPG in a fantasy world of Attiras. In around 72 quests and in 3 narrative arcs you will decide if you conquer your world by force or by solutions during story arcs. As info from devs there are 64 possible ending combinations. I didn't finish the game yet but i liked the atmosphere of strategical turn-based combat, character developement, resource management as of money, recruits and caravan transportation system. At the beginning you will be maybe confused about story and background but some hours in-game you will understand what is going on.


[b]Technical/Gameplay[/b]
Tutorial and the point till you start the real war + reconquer are easy to do, but as you gain control later, you will see it like 60 days after tutorial, you can be frustrated. The 1st 1-2 missions are on average difficulty but then as you progress in 2nd region you gain quests where you simply can't win with your 4-5 soldiers against 2-3 waves of 8 soldiers each. Bowmen and magic users are not recruitable from start, you need to train them by yourself. If you couldn't get some recruits during tutorial maybe you need to restart.

On the other side you get a lot of options and possibilities to develop your own style: recruits have 4 core attributes, 10 weapon skill trees and 1 magic skill tree, general skill trees and so on. You can cast spells and fight with swords, you can always switch weapons during the combat. Magic system is little bit complex and with a lot of sliders on spell making, so you need to find out your own style. Level cap of recruits is 26 and you can command 3 war parties.

Interesting is also the philosophical system, where you decide in quests, speeches etc your alignment maybe, hedonism, altruism and rationalism. Your recruits have moral system, your regions have moral system, global system and so on.

Overall interesting and worth the money game, i miss only achievements, but maybe it's either from technical or other reasons not possible to make them now.

- хорошая оптимизация, особенно для игры только что из релиза.
- интересная боевка, большое количество оружия
- богатая кастомизация персонажа
- возможность эксперементировать благодаря возможности скинуть очки прокачки в любой момент без каких-либо проблем, а также прокачка любой другой ветки оружия сразу после первого боя с этим оружием, что не мешает перепробовать любые связки оружия и талантов уже со старта.
- музыка хоть и не потрясает до глубины души, но и не вызывает оторжения и даже не мешает. Желания отключить ее не появлялось.
- Отличная камера, которая мало того что крутится как хочешь, но и имеет возможность отдаляться и приближаться для обзора полной тактической картины. Большой плюс т.к. многие другие тактические игры такой возможностью пренебрегают.
- На глобальной карте постоянно что-то происходит, так что скучно не становится, противники тоже не сидят без дела.

Кроме плюсов есть хоть и не претензии, но вопросы к магической системе, она какая-то бесполезная на поле боя, куда как хуже лучников, да и не совсем понятно как она действует. Зато танк с щитом в одной руке и магическим шаром в другой имеет наибольшее количество брони...Может это и плюс, а может и недоработка.
 Также замечены парочка совсем уж мелких косяков при описании стат от экипировки, но думаю, что скоро поправят.

Decent game. Some story issues and some mechanics issues. It should have a manual for mechanics, terms , and options. Below is the previous observations if you are curious. If it was a 60+ dollar triple A it would be not recommended but at 30 bucks I think the price is fair and the game has value.

I find the nakedly elitist authoritarian tone to be one I would prefer to play on the other side. I shall struggle on a bit then. I do enjoy the mechanics. Perhaps I will change the recommendation option in time.

So the story line is resolving to be less unpalatable but the mechanics are going the other direction to some extent. One simple example is that hit penalties are capped at -50% while the hit penalty for high cover is -65% which is a pointless endeavor due to the much lower absolute cap. We can manipulate magic and there is enchanted gear but I see no evidence that we can have our own enchanted which is not option but pot luck. 

With incontinuities like that coupled with the fact that I had to put up with hours of slaughtering people that just wanted freedom and the inevitable hattrick that the game will ultimately purport to be about freedom but at the end of the day it is leaders and led (yes, no surprise but still a manipulation to rationalize hierarchy, not more palatable for being clever, only harder to unpack for the masses), I will call it a 8/10 and give it a tentative recommend. The civ style diplo timeline element tends to be poorly done and absurd in most every game it is in as well but I shall take it for what it is, an artificial timeline.

I do enjoy the scope of the customization. The concept is also good.

Your adverse reaction is actually the commentary that is intended in the game. If you'd like to push through beyond the tutorial and the start of the game you'll find that the much hated ""elitists"" whose shoes you are filling have a bit of an arc to go through and that you are very much in control of their fate.

From your reaction it would seem that you do care about the story or at the very least the world that is presented. As the writer, I would urge you to press on and let the story unfold naturally as it is told through the very narrow perspective of your main characters. I know that this sort of storytelling is less prevalent these days, but I do personally feel that it allows for more personal agency on the part of the player and lets it grow organically without spoon-feeding it to you.

The game play is fun and surprisingly quick for a game like this, but it is challenging. Fair but challenging from the first battle.

Also the visuals are more realistic than normally in such games (often cartoony) and the writing is better and the story is more unique than in most, I find.

Hindered by very poorly explained mechanics and many bugs/glitches. (actively being worked on by devs).

As of 08/10/19, the game is currently at ""Mixed"" reviews. While I understand the frustrations and complaints of several of the negative reviews, It seems many of those writers never even explored or spent time learning about the various systems and mechanics of this great little gem.
YES, there are bugs and poorly explained mechanics/systems, but the small dev team is working on them and are active in the forums, answering questions and taking feedback from the community.
[b]The positives of this game FAR outweigh the negatives in my opinion.[/b]

[h1]1) Alignment and Story.[/h1]
This game avoids the stereotypical Good/Evil axis and choose instead a more realistic Altruistic/Rational/Hedonistic system.
Altruism corresponds to choosing the typical ""good"" path in most games, but can also mean choosing to sacrifice the few for the good of the many. It could also mean forgoing a reward or a powerful new recruit that benefits your character to gain the approval of a city state's population instead. This could be a double edged sword as being ""good"" is typically not the most efficient route and one could be betrayed easily and then ambushed.
Rationalism would then mean to simply act using logic and not emotion. This could mean many things such as spending time to observe a battle between two enemy factions, then pouncing at the weakened winner. It could also mean refusing to believe a plot offered by a defecting enemy spy, as there is no logic in believing a known betrayer. Rationalism could also be a flaw as trending completely towards logic could sometimes disqualify one from quests or choices that need faith or belief in traditions and myths.
Hedonism is a little more confusing as it pertains to one's Pride, self-indulgence and belief in one's superiority over others. 
This would typically correspond to the ""Evil"" aspect of most other games, but here it highlights the character's self-confidence and pride in the MC's near-immortal and physically MUCH more powerful race over humanity. This ofcourse could be a bad thing... as pride and vanity can cause potential allies to become enemies and friends to question their loyalty.

[h1]2) Loyalty System.[/h1]
This one is connected to the above alignment system. One's followers and territory also have an alignment and just like in real-life, will follow a leader who has the same or similar enough outlook at life. This means that moving too far away personality-wise could lead to followers resigning or flat out deserting; it could also mean one's territory not providing the appropriate gold income or support. I comment though that the baseline personality shifts are excessive leading to mass desertions relatively quickly, thus I recommend moving the personality shift slider to -75%.

[h1]3) Magic and Magic-Crafting.[/h1]
The magic system is very unique and interesting. The level of customization and power shows off why the different types of ""stones"" (Spirit/Arcane/Thermal) used in-game are in such high demand and fought over so fiercely as a single skilled mage could dominate a battlefield near single-handedly, decimating whole groups of enemies and causing terrain to be impossible to traverse. The spellcrafting mechanics apply to ALL spell types, be they damage, healing or support type spells.
The problem it seems to me from several negative reviews I've read is that at this moment, there is still no tutorial or manual regarding the magic system and one needs to experiment and tinker around with the mechanics to create effective or powerful spells. Several spell mechanics are simply not explained very well such as Chaos (randomized spell power, causing weaker OR stronger spell effects), Resistance (active avoidance of spell attacks using fortitude/reflex Saving throws), and Dampen (Passive avoidance of spell attacks, basically a flat negation of spell power) being the primary culprits.
This game flaw is actively being worked on by the developers, with a codex manual in the process of being written and a recent patch adding in description text (still not enough imo) to explain what each spell crafting mechanic does.

[h1]4) Difficulty and Combat.[/h1]
At baseline (all sliders at their default levels), the game is actually quite dangerous and tactically exciting. Enemies seem to scale somewhat to your groups and could deal some impressive damage and debuffs if one doesnt use line-of-sight and cover appropriately. Combat is quite fun as well with many fun interactions between the various mechanics and enemies seem to use alot of the mechanics of the game fairly well, so you can see the AI using cover, line-of-sight, attacks of opportunity and debuffs against your own guys.
Example: Bleed an enemy to cause a physical damage-over-time effect, knock them back towards a fire so they take a fire damage-over-time effect and trigger a bleed due to movement, then Area-of-Opportunity lock them in place, ALL while this enemy is providing cover against their archer friend trying to snipe a ways back, and preventing their two-handed hammer buddy from coming within range to hit your guys.",1565455891,1565455891,True,10,0,0.538744449615478516,0,True,False,False,False,,,

La gestione dell'equipaggiamento causa troppe statistiche può diventare noiosa

We are actively listening to the feedback and while we'll never quite have those large scale armies that you're looking for, we have improved the performance alot. While the gameplay settings updates we've pushed will give you the ability to the combat to your liking.

=========================
It's a fun and engaging Xcom-lite. It's not super difficult in terms of tactical demand but has enough challenge to stay fun, and the battles are somewhat less repetitive than some other TRPGs. The magic system is a bit hard to understand but really cool and the spellcrafting is really, really cool, some of the best I've seen. The combat mechanics can be too easy if you abuse spellcrafting and too hard without, but good spells are always very custom and need to be thought out. 

Other details:
- The overland map is pretty and the battle maps are fine
- Character design seems solid if nondescript
- Dialogue is very over-verbose but otherwise well done.
- Story seems decent and choices matter to some extent, but doesn't grab me; I feel it goes very fast.

Major Wins:
=========================
- Depth of team composition is very deep with many strategies feeling valid - Magic is clearly strongest so far but I am not pigeonholed into only magic, only melee, or only ranged and it's great. Good variety and each weapon tree is not just ""axe-flavored swords"" - they play very differently.
- Spellcrafting is awesome
- Fights are sufficiently varied and you don't need to grind levelups.
- It's punishing but recoverable if you wipe a team, leaving room for making up for mistakes with future smart play and better team optimization.
- Progression of individual team members creates more interesting gameplay, not only higher numbers.

How to improve:
=========================
- Tutorial needs slower explanations, more demonstrations with accompanying images; especially around magic. 10hrs with four separate caster characters and I still don't fully understand when my spells will be ready again between Expel and Drain schools.
- Make swapping weapons a little less penalizing, maybe with some perks/talents. This would make loadouts feel more impactful.
- It's really frustrating when overland is set to fastest speed, and you cannot pause between battles to manage other Talons. Start the overland map in paused mode after every encounter!
- I'd really love to see more enemy team variety, especially with more casters.
- I immediately missed tactical RPG staples like overwatch/ambush mode if you have points left. This would go great into the weapon perk trees, Definitely do counterspell-mode as well, keep the awesome magic system involved.
- The spellcrafting effects can be difficult to understand. Especially hard is Inverse Magic, it's probably the coolest variety-adding effect but I can't usually tell what my spell will actually do - and if I misinterpret my team could die.
- I don't recall any sort of hardcore mode without savescumming, etc; but I imagine would really improve the longevity of the game especially to Xcom-veteran type players.

As others say it's somewhat a medieval xcom with a twist of pathfinder. You travel around a larger map gaining influence of zones and building your empire, while doing individual battles in a more xcom turn based tactics. The difficulty is rather... brutal by default. There are multiple game setting modifiers to manually reconfigure the difficulty to the way you want though, so after a few brutal battles I've tweaked in some buffer for myself. Maybe as I learn the game systems better I can tone down how much a handicap I've given. It would be nice if there were some preset difficulties provided -- maybe something to be patched in.

Speaking of game systems -- there is A LOT going on and some crazy customization to the magic system. Characters can also spec into lots of different things based off what they use. It can be very complex to figure out what is going on -- by the sounds of it the devs are aware of the complexity and are prioritizing a codex for some more info in game based off their post launch post. I’m excited to play around with the build options and the ability to respec at any time is nice. 

It is from an indie studio so it does lack some of the refined polish you see from the latest AAA releases, but it still feels like a solid complete game. Maybe some balance tweaks and patches like the codex helping the learning curve will help improve other’s opinions of it.

Still lost because the rebels outvoted me by a landslide. even though I owned about 60 percent of the map since the loyalist joined me completely and the rebels would've joined me completely in a few days bout then the conclave appeared.

Second the strategy portion of it leaves much to be desired.  You have your quests and talons that can explore the map. However the money you earn is meaningless. No diplomacy, No spying, No development.

All it is used for is to hire new people when other inevitably leave you. You're comrades should shift with you or at least give the option of talking with them since they leave frequently.

I really wish I could like this game, as almost everything about it is just up my alley, but...

Animations and graphics look very unpolished and, as mentioned previously, janky (something that specially stood out for me as I've recently been playing another indie turn based strategy game with MUCH better animations than this).

Gameplay is fine, but, again, it suffers due to the animations and graphics, which constantly took me out of the game.

Adding to it is a number of small thigns such as what I feel is a bad, UI and lack of polish (such as important character's in game having generic voice clips, like THE KING refering to your vague presense as 'my liege' or talking as if he was a common soldier... same for the very character you are playing as)

Maybe its just me, but the animations, graphics (including cahracter portraits loading up all pixelated and staying like that for a LONG time) and those small bits lacking polish just rubbed me the wrong way.

It really just feels like this is an early access title, a very good one, but still early access.

I do hope it gets proper updates and support to fix all its issues.",1564843690,1564843860,False,10,0,0.52230381965637207,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Strong points:
* X-Com style combat with cover
* a deep system for shaping spells
* a cool skill tree system with different weapons having different ability trees and semi ""learn by using""
* compelling setting and story! In a way you are the ""bad guys"" who get rebelled against, except the rebels aren't really good guys either
* large world map that works kind of like the Geoscape in XCOM 
* squad based - recruit soldiers, build squads (called Talons), equip them and send them to missions on the map
* conquer territories for more income
* ton and tons of story driving events which choices that leads to consequences

Weak points (some being worked on):
* confusing - the game is quite detailed and can easily overwhelm the player with all its systems. Information is easy to miss or is just completely missing in places. A codex is being worked on which will help this
* scarcity in assets for customizing soldiers and equipment - basically this was out of their budget for the game
* small bugs, none of which are game breaking
* had one CTD in 11 hours - these are being worked on

The first and foremost is the good/neutral/ev--- wait, ""altruistic, rational, hedonistic"" alignment system.  It sounds like something that will make a big difference and have major impacts.  However, after starting the game proper (reaching the old capital - about 5-6 battles to get there), and then fighting another 2-3 fights, all your starting troops will desert your armies due to ""difference in values"".  At first, I thought it was because I was picking evil -- err.. hedonistic options.  So I restarted and went through the tutorial parts again, picking only good options.  Guess what?  My entire starter army deserted then, too.  Plus, the obvious implication in on of the earliest parts of the game is that if you don't ""win the hearts of the populace"" you will lose the game even if you're doing fine in the war.   And since people are deserting constantly, you basically have to play good to keep recruiting from events, or you'll just run out of money constantly buying new troops.  So, thanks for the choices that are:  Lose, or maybe don't lose.

Since everybody is deserting like mad, it makes spending time customizing the extensive and otherwise fun skill tree feel extremely annoying.  Oh, you just spent 15 minutes tweaking my ability tree?  Lol see ya!

The other great promise that the game has is its unique and interesting magic system.  Here's the problem.  It's super cool, and allows for huge amounts of customization.  It is also half as powerful even for a skilled mage as non-magical options.  I crafted a healing spell early on that listed ""10-700 healing"" in its description.  After the 5th cast in a row of 20-30 points of healing, I decided to change the formula to avoid using chaotic elements, which are apparently garbage.  So it was consistently doing ~70 single target healing.  But one attack from a non-magic build was doing 150 - 200 damage by that point, so it would take 2-3 turns of just healing to undo one turn of damage inputs (but actually 4-6 turns - keep reading!).  Damage follows similar numbers, lagging behind weapon attacks by half or more.  So it's underwhelming by the numbers; grab a bow and be done with it.  But what about utility?  Yeah, the ability to manipulate enemies can be useful as a way to remove enemies from combat for a few turns, but even that's pretty obnoxious because spells can't be cast twice in a row.  You have to cast spells from two different sides on subsequent turns.  And usually one side is an underwhelming damage/heal effect, or a mediocre buff/debuff (underwhelming numbers again), so you can, at best, get good utilities every other turn.  Since you can bring 5 troops into battle, mages are almost always better off being respecced as non-mages.

So yeah, the most important and hype systems just... kinda suck.

Other than that, the difficulty is a bit annoying to tweak.  I just want to play, and the default difficulty is pretty dangerous, so I want to select an easier mode.  But I don't want to spend time fiddling with 10 sliders.  So I just made everything as easy as possible and ignored the skill-trees entirely, since all my troops were going to desert anyway.  But it turns out that bypassing the only interesting systems because they're broken leaves a thoroughly mediocre game.

The combat itself is pretty fun if you can find the right settings for you.  The obvious fantasy x-com feel is there, with cover and grid based movement.  The devs also clearly spent a lot of time thinking about the events going on in the world and put a bunch of effort into the events and encounters.  If the alignment system didn't result in constant desertion, and if the magic system actually felt satisfying to use, this would be a great game.  As it stands, though, I really can't recommend it at all.",1564841720,1564841720,False,232,13,0.833897173404693604,0,True,False,False,False,,1566579720.0,"[UPDATE, PATCH 1.1.4502]

We've implemented a slider that allows you to enlarge the PDT circle that would help curb the desertions to the appropriate level of difficulty you would like. There also a brand new Attiran Conquest as well that throws you into the war unhindered by the narrative constraints. 

Cheers, hope you will give us another shot.
-----

Hello, thank you for such a detailed review.

Our latest patch addresses the healing complaints we've received and we've since buffed the base healing by 20% and altered Canae's Grace preset to be a more effective spell overall. I can't speak be to your usage of the other spell effects, but the initial commentary of their utility (or lack thereof) can largely be attributed to the early game and the lower magurite control stats which will make the spells feel a little weak - that said, we've pushed a bit of a nerf to some of the spells as many have found them to be rather powerful when built appropriately. To this end, we are working on a codex and have put out more detailed descriptions to potentially aid you in taking full advantage of the the system.

As to your point regarding the tri-axis philosophical index, the system is there to give you the feel of the challenges faced by people in leadership positions. The fact that your roleplay choices of going down the hedonistic route is thwarted by desertion is a consequence of your actions. Needing to juggle the fickle ideals of your men and your own preferences is the exact commentary on leadership and consequence that I had intended in the system, but I also understand that it is not for everyone and we give you the ability to adjust the shifts to your needs.

We are also actively discussing ways to lessen the blow and potentially provide a way to deter complete desertion as it is a rather harsh consequence that just isn't for everyone. 

I'm really sorry that you dislike our game so much, but please know that we are actively listening and making adjustments. In the meantime, if there are any redeeming qualities of the game that you do enjoy, I encourage you to try our latest patch and press on with the war. 

Thank you again for the fair review and your feedback!

Но то, что я успел увидеть, можно описать двумя словами ""Избыточность"" и ""Непродуманность"".

Избыточная ролевая система:
- слишком много всего, причем меня не оставляет чувство, что большая часть никогда не понадобится.
- слишком большие числа производных характеристик заставляют думать о слабости автора ролевой модели;
- слишком навороченная магическая система, нужная в основном для галочки, а не для выполнения задач (меня не оставляет чувство, что ее делали для строчки в маркетинговых воплях о ее необычности, а не для того чтобы реально пользоваться).

Корявый тактический бой:
- сложно понять, что происходит во время хода противника, т.к. экран затемнен и поперек него висит громадный знак ""ход противника"" и нужно ориентироваться на журнал боя;
- рваный конец хода бойцов - немедленно начинает ходить противник с переводом камеры на него, плюс экран затемняется - нельзя даже толком посмотреть анимацию удара своего бойца. Тут помогла бы галочка в меня - ""конец хода вручную"", но ее нет.
- противник ходит слишком быстро для того, чтобы разглядеть его действия (на затемненном смещенном экране), но при этом достаточно медленно, чтобы устать ждать своего хода.
- Корявое управление камерой: движение и поворот на васде, мастаб на колесе (вашу ж мать, я, за последние двадцать лет, с момента масштабного распространения мышек и 3D привык двигать камеру мышкой);
- очень малоинформативные иконки бойцов - маленькие изображения оружия, которые НЕМНОГО увеличиваются на активном бойце. Даже своего активного бойца приходится искать в первую очередь по точкам возможного перемещения.
- бредовая система укрытий: на кой дьявол она здесь нужна вообще? И если уж она есть и у вас такая сложная боевая и ролевая модель - какого дьявола она дает только два фиксированных значения?

Визуальное исполнение на три с плюсом - неплохие модели и корявенькое, почти анимешное 2d в портретах персонажей.
Главный недостаток всего этого стиля: главные герои истории - плохо нарисованные уродцы. Глядя на них, разом теряешь интерес к тому, что же будет с ними дальше.

В целом - отличный замах, но на полметра мимо и в стену. Хочется пожелать авторам удачи, скорее всего, их следующая игра будет гораздо лучше. Но эта - не очень.

The Tactical-Roleplaying genre has been near void of new releases in recent years. It’s interest in it in 2019 has been nonexistent. Genres like Battle Royales, Shooters, and even MOBA’s have dominated the limelight. But Forged of Blood, though the popularity may not speak for it, has the potential to rival most Triple-A titles. 

Forged of Blood excels in many of the things that makes its genre great, but takes them to the next level. 

One of the things that sets Forged of Blood apart, is its detailed story exploration and believable characters. Every decision you make contributes to the future of the world. Forged of Blood takes the fluid story mechanic used in TellTale games, and combines it with rampant civil war. Not only can your decisions affect personal relationships, but also National outcomes, as well as those outcomes affecting relationships themselves. The story adds many layers of complexity for the player to explore, but what solidifies the story are the characters. Many RPG games struggle to create interesting characters that feel like real people, often with them feeling like generic fulfillments of archetypes. But the dialogue and character interactions in Forged of Blood feel both real and full of emotion. I was entranced watching the relationships develop between my favorite characters, and couldn’t wait to see how it affected the story.

But what’s most important in the Tactical-Roleplaying genre is the gameplay. I found Forged of Blood’s difficulty to be incredibly rewarding. There is no selectable difficulty level, but it thrusts you into the game. Similar games like Fire Emblem Heroes, have preset difficulties that tweak stats for each corresponding selection. Forged of Blood is a game that both respects and expects its players skill. You never fail to feel excited during an encounter. I had to experiment and tweak my strategies in order to succeed in even the earliest missions. Your tactics assuredly matter, and I myself learned that the hard way. 

One of the ways you strategize is outside the battlefield. Unlike others in the genre, in Forged of Blood, there is no class system. Class kits and strategies are built yourself by allocating equipment and points in various skill trees. Any preset class you have in mind can be built yourself, but the opportunity to hybridize and innovate is also there. Games like Payday 2 with in-depth class systems, have built communities on those options. Forged of Blood has brought that concept to the Tactical-Roleplaying experience.

Unfortunately, for all the praises I have, Forged of Blood still needs work. One of the things that immediately stood out to me is the clear lack of player assistance. Forged of Blood is a hardcore gaming experience, but it felt gated to players new to the genre. I expected tutorials on the various systems, but had to explore and research them myself. There is an argument for letting players discover but outside of the initial combat tutorial, I was completely overwhelmed. I ended up having to put it together as I played, not learning until much later how to use the different skill trees. Ideally it would have a more expansive tutorial, but even my rampant confusion wasn’t my biggest qualm with the title. A couple times through the gameplay, I experienced game interrupting bugs. The biggest one halted the game completely. I couldn’t progress further until I created an entirely new save game and start from the beginning. I recognize what happened could have been unique to me, but it definitely put a damper on my experience.

Though ignoring unintentional features, I found myself incredibly satisfied with my delving into the Tactical-Roleplaying genre. I’d always heard of it, but never explored it outside of watching recorded gameplay. Forged of Blood is complex on several levels, and although sometimes to a fault, it has the capacity to turn the genre on its head. At its current state, I rate Forged of Blood: 7.5/10.

I have now played the tutorial, and started the main game - there is a lot to learn so have invested 12 hours so far.

So lets get the ""bad"" stuff out of the way:
There is no character customisation such as how you look, name etc - personally for me this is fine as the game is good enough that this is a minor thing.
Linear story (sort of).  Again the story is pretty cool and drives the game giving you decision to make that decide how it progresses.
Some of the controls are a bit finicky but once you get used to them they are fine.

The good stuff:
The magic system is superb, the best I have ever come across - you can basically ""craft"" your own spells using stones and developing the ""attached"" spells, this in itself makes it worth buying.
Story is pretty good, and gives you something to aim for while not restricting how you play (in some ways reminds me of Tyranny in that respect.
Class less system that for me really works.  You do have a few basic stats, Strength, Agility, Dexterity and Endurance which can be increased, these are also influenced by the characters ""race"".  The main perks are based on your weapon choices and builds (ie I have a sword and shield build with magic, a ranged unit with melee back up and then concentrate on these, you can also re stat these at any time).
Once you have done the long tutorial/intro which is worth it as it sets the scene and helps you develop, you end up with one main character who then ""leads"" one of up to 3 groups that travel the map doing quests and conquering regions, you hire troops for these groups and develop them.
Graphics are pretty good and it is relatively bug free game, with the odd bug reported being tackled by the Devs.
Sound I can't comment on as tend to play with sound off (for family's sake LOL).

I highly recommend this game if you like this type of game - read the description, the above review and watch the vids that should help you decide.
I can see I am going to spend many hours on this game.  I hope they will in the future be able to expand in some ways on it maybe through some DLCs but so far I am loving it.

There is a lot of information to swallow for newcomers, don't let it scare you, it's easily understandable.

The best things I can say about this game:
- free and unlimited respecs
- possibility of every character to have 2 weapons and you gain levels with each at the same time regardless of use in fights
- story and your impact on it via choices (kinda like Th Witcher tales)
- map and the domination mode makes me nostalgic for Battle for Middle Earth 2
- spellcrafting and party recruitment (up to 3 parties at once)

What I dislike so far:
- camera in fights
- clumsy controls",1564683123,1564683543,True,8,0,0.518674194812774658,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It fills a niche that had been begging to be filled for a while - A non-open world tactical turn based RPG, with loot, in a lowish/dark fantasy setting. The fully realized world, lore, and overworld strategy meta are just icing on the cake. It released in full, not Early Access, which for this type of game is rare and highly commendable. If the game seems interesting to you I would recommend checking out the developer videos that explain gameplay rather than rely on steam reviews, as it does have some robust mechanics built into it. That said, it is an easy recommendation for fans of the strategy rpg genre.",1564676682,1564720420,True,20,0,0.605674088001251221,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The magic system is very customizable.  You can basically make your own spell effects - which gives a LOT of room for customization.  The difficulty is also customizable based on sliders so you can very easily make the game more or less difficult without much effort.

It doesn't have the ability to remap a lot of the key controls at the moment, so you are stuck with WASD for camera movement.  Also it lacks a defensive stance/hold/wait function when you end your character's turn.  Traditionally in tactical games you could delay your turn and move later in the combat order or turtle up.  That feature is currently missing from this game.

My biggest complaint at the moment is the lack of story background.  The beginning of the game doesn't explain the setting very well.  I'm hoping later on I will encounter some more lore that fleshes things out a bit.

TLDR: Character customization very good, lots of abilities to learn.  Needs more setting lore and information about spells and abilities.",1564668603,1564668603,True,36,0,0.754436254501342773,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
• Good story (basically fire emblem)
• Great looting system (when you win each battle you can loot everything they had equipped)
• I love the great character sheet you can basically pick 2 weapons you want someone to have say like greatsword & bow and gain points in both, don't like what you have built? just reroll your character it costs nothing it's a great feature since im afraid of messing up builds.
• the magic system is amasing and fun since you can have a mage character with 2 crystals in each slot with different magic in them is the best thing to try and find what goes best with what.
Cons:
• The tutorial, it's not really bad and not tedious but it's just awkward if you don't know that a great axe has more reach then a greatsword
• During battle if you scroll out during your phase and want to zoom back in again you have to wait for your turn it locks the camera in place so you have to stare at a pillar or a wall for the enemies turn.
• Voice acting is just hit or miss it's awkward it's funny it's dorky but brilliant also i do notice the same voice actor doing multiple roles ;)
• not being able to stab with daggers, daggers are a throwable but that should be an ability where as in they do quicker attack for less points or do critical attacks more often or backstabs
• i killed a gurrahorr and got nothing but experience, no leather or bones or meat or anything for such a big and lovely creature this was just shocking.
• the moving on the map is slow (i know i can make it go faster with F3 but still)

in my opinion it's worth the 30$ it's fun, immersive and the lore is there for anyone to get sucked into.",1564656463,1564656463,True,111,2,0.750488638877868652,9,True,False,False,False,,,
