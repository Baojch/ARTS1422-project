The ambiance and music are nice and I appreciate a first person puzzle game that isn't trying to directly copy portal, but the story is just a haughty biblical voice that feels like some sacrilegous uncanny valley because they are obviously going for a diety but they wrote it like it was straight out of the holy book itself. My favorite aspect of games is the sense of exploration, which I think is what they were going for here, but for me it turned into hunting for puzzle elements and mechanics, which is probably a lot more tolerable not in VR. It's cool to feel your way through a puzzle and really engage with spacial puzzle solving, but so much is ocluded on every level that it takes more time rooting around to discover the puzzle elements and hazards than it does to mechanically solve the puzzle. There is so much shrubbery and shadows around the castle ruins that it is hard to find anything, and turning a corner into a laser or bomb will reset so you have to take it cautiously, I'm not saying that everything needs to be sterile lab theme but it's just obnoxious to have to have extraneous corridors in puzzle and put puzzle elements out of sight around a corner just so you have to go find and grab them and bring them into the puzzle every level before even starting rather than being able to see the puzzle elements clearly.

On world 4 there is a new puzzle mechanic that appeared just as a shadow on the ground that I couldn't interact with, so I looked around thinking it needed to be activated somehow. Nothing in that stage, so I looked in the other stages in the world thinking maybe I had to do one of the others first like a tutorial for the new mechanic, but they just had ghosts of the object too. So I wandered around the outer area of world 4 searching for anything, and found nothing. Finally looking it up I had to go back to the hub area and UNLOCK the ""connector"" from the hub area, why???? There is no opportunity for me to have used this piece before world 4, and it's not like you can take it out into the overworld, the necessary pieces spawn in each puzzle, if it's how they wanted to lock progression why not lock world 4 from being entered? On the next world there is a multi-stage puzzle that involves toggling a lot of gates in a sequence multiple times which requires a lot of movement, so after traversing the stage multiple times I reached the final part of the puzzle which was blocked by a pair of orbs that need to be offset which requires undoing the whole puzzle to offset them and the redoing the entire thing. It was possible to see this from the start, and to prevent the backtracking if you ALREADY KNOW how the solution to the puzzle, otherwise the visual obstruction of this feels like a ""gotcha"" and in VR my tolerance for backtracking is lower. This is just one example of how this is a good port but the game itself is not made for VR and that hinders the experience.

Obviously I'm struggling with things that have not a problem for others, but I wanted to report on the obtuse edges that I was grinding up against in this game. I find it hard to believe that the positive reviews from this game aren't just from people who enjoyed the non-vr version and bought but only played a little of the VR version, since the achievement for activating the elevator after chapter 1 (of 5) only has 10% global completion. I would suggest playing the non-vr version instead of VR but I've played better first person puzzle games than this so personally I wouldn't suggest the non-vr version either.

I played this game back in 2017 and loved it.  I'm a huge puzzle fan and I think this might be my favorite puzzle game. It has some really fierce competition, but this game scratched all the right itches. It's got a cool existential story, it's got robots, it's got puzzles, and it's challenging. I've listened to a lot of talks, podcasts, and discussions on AI, free will, existence and meaning, and this game does a great job of actively making me question these concepts. It also does a surprising job at making me think about life and death and I found myself choked up a few times when reading something and applying it to my own life.

It's been six years since that time and I never really thought about a sequel. Somehow it flew under my radar. Two weeks prior to launch of the sequel, it popped up in my newsfeed. I immediately bought the sequel. I then decided, let me watch a recap video in case it's relevant. A minute into the recap video, I decided I needed to replay the game. I very rarely replay a game or rewatch a show/movie, so that's a big deal to me.

I am very glad I decided to. This game stands the test off time. And while it's a VERY basic VR port and has no VR gimmicks other than being VR and picking things up, it's such an awesome way to experience a 3D puzzle game. The game is every bit as fun and challenging as I remember. I don't remember the puzzles, but I did retain the out of the box thinking required for this game. It's not the hardest, not by any stretch. It's moderately hard, even on it's most challenging levels, but it's very rewarding when I would solve a challenge that had me scratching my head.

For the most part, the base game is pretty straight forward and it's easy enough. Road to Gehanna is where the real challenge begins. And it has a really cool story and way of interacting with the world.

For the VR version, some things worth noting:

1. My one trackpad (Vive) didn't always go fast enough, not sure if it's an issue with my controller or the game. But I started using both and it assured I was always going max speed. There is also an option to go max speed all the time, which isn't ideal, but can also solve the issue.

2. If the game tells you this, I sure didn't notice it. But holding both jump buttons (grips on Vive) speeds up the game a lot and makes certain tasks bearable. It obviously mutes the volume, so you could potentially miss some dialogue, but since dialogue is scarce and mostly predictable, you kinda know when not to do it.

3. If you are having difficulty with some jumps, make sure your speed is set to max. You can also try toggling to teleport for certain jumps. I'd say this is really only necessary for easter eggs.

4. Some easter eggs are gone for the VR edition. Others, I couldn't get because of platforming difficulty. I don't think you can go as fast as the non-VR version. I wish they had planned better for this. I was halfway through an easter egg guide when I started to encounter ones I couldn't complete and I got frustrated and stopped.

5. In Road to Gehanna, I was stuck for over an hour on one star because, at least with my setup, the solution was basically impossible. It required a degree of precision that made it seem like this wasn't the solution, and I was just tricking the game, which you can do sometimes. So I moved on and looked for other solutions. Coming back to this one several times. Finally I managed to get it to work. I corroborated my solution with others online and this appears to be the correct solution. A little frustrating, but mostly the game was ported to VR well.

I highly recommend this game, sale or no, it's worth every penny. The first time around it took me about 60 hours to get 80% achievements and everything. This time, it took me around 50 hours and I think I got one more achievement (82%).",1699584551,1699584551,True,1,0,0.489451497793197632,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Инструкция: В библиотеке Стима выбираем игру и нажимаем на ней правой кнопкой мыши, чтобы открыть «Свойства». В появившемся окне, что называется «Общие» смотри вниз и видим поле для ввода, где написано «ПАРАМЕТРЫ ЗАПУСКА». Туда вводим следующую команду, чтобы модифицировать параметры запуска, после чего игра должна заработать без системы виртуальной реальности: +vr_strAPI ""Emulated""
Для отключения данного параметра и возвращения к стандарту прописываем такую команду:
+vr_strAPI ""SteamVR""
Для более комфортной игры можно сделать следующее: В главном меню игры переходим в «НАСТРОЙКИ», после чего в самом верху выбираем «VR CONTROLS» и отключаем настройку под названием «COMFORT MODE». Да-да, в нашем случае всё станет комфортнее после отключения её.
О переносе сохранений: Важным моментом является то, что перенос осуществляется только из обычной версии в версию виртуальной реальности, а не наоборот.
Итак, выйдя из обеих игр начинаем… Выбираем версию виртуальной реальности в библиотеке Стима и нажимаем на ней правой кнопкой мыши, чтобы открыть «Свойства». В появившемся окне, что называется «Общие» находим раздел под названием «ОБЛАЧНЫЕ СОХРАНЕНИЯ» и отключаем синхронизацию. Далее осуществляем перенос, но прежде можно сделать резервную копию того, что у нас есть сейчас в версии виртуальной реальности, а можем просто перетащить сохранение из обычной версии в виртуальную.

First off I am not a true gamer or flight sim player. 
I got a Reverb G2 headset and was desperate to get games that used “realistic” backgrounds and scenery; I was actually waiting for the VR release of Myst. I got The Talos Principal on special offer mainly because of the way it looked and I was not disappointed. 

It is a puzzle game, where you have to work out how to use objects and move yourself to achieve the possession of a Tetris like piece: having enough of these pieces, and fitting them together correctly, allows you to progress. Each challenge should only take a few minutes. Sounds simple, but some of the individual puzzles are quite difficult and there are many, many of these, with all sorts of different equipment and environments. There are also hidden “stars” in each game level, which take some hunting to find. So that’s the game.

As a huge bonus there is the whole strange world to explore, with great and varied scenery, and the back story of the creation of this world, which contains some deep philosophical questions. Did I mention the game was big? After 45 odd hours I think I am approaching the half way point, but probably less than that.

The mechanics work flawlessly and visually the game stunning. (for the G2 to work you must not be on the Beta Steam release). That said the VR game is now 5+ years old, so it is not exactly cutting edge by today’s standards but it has held up remarkably well. It does not stress my pretty middling VR system at all. I can’t imagine playing all through the game, but you can easily abandon it to come back when you want to, playing it in suitable chunks. Voice acting and sound effects are spot on. 

If you enjoy VR for its ability to immerse you in new surroundings, and want some thoughtful puzzle to solve, this is a must have game, even with no discount as it is now pretty cheap full price.

Controls are clunky and simplistic. Every interaction is simply point and click. One of the first puzzles involves a big beefy lever, and I was really disappointed when I tried to grab it and it just magically moved by itself.

Interacting with the MLS also feels pretty bad. The UI is text boxes that appear over the keyboard, and you have to just poke the reply you want and try to not accidently hit the wrong one.

There's also a jarring effect where if you try to reach your hand out of bounds like through the window in the peephole mission, you get teleported slightly backwards. I think that's unnecessary.

Similarly, ladders teleport you to the top, or the other side of the wall. It's unpleasant.

I think this version of the game would have been pretty killer in 2017, but today it's just unimpressive. It reads like a low-effort VR port.

I've had this on my wishlist since it was released and only now got around to getting a VR headset to give it a spin. I'm a little disappointed.

This isn't a bad game by any means. Talos is a *fantastic* game and if you're considering playing it, you will enjoy it. But the VR version doesn't stand up to the quality of VR games today.

While there may be a flatscreen PC version available, when you're playing in VR, the level of personal impact it adds cannot be overstated.

There is a ton of content as well. Aside from each of the individual puzzles, there are extra stars scattered about to collect, and even on top of that, there is a plethora of easter egg content, ranging from hidden rooms to statue puzzles, and even crossover cameos.
The only complaint I have is that several of the stars/eastereggs required movement that is almost impossible in VR, either needing to switch out of classic controls and use teleportation mode in order to have enough control over landing points to not be an exercise in futility. Alternatively, some easter eggs were outright removed entirely (no telescopes for viewing the aperture moon or lady liberty apparently) The VR version also has very limited guide support on steam. I ended up opening the guides that were on the page for the flatscreen version. The easteregg guide was particularly helpful, if only because I would have otherwise thought that content was part of an actual puzzle.
The other complaint is that I may have inadvertently cheesed a massive amount of content with an exploit involving the cubes that may only be possible in VR. Despite this, even the cheese methods required a fair amount of effort to pull off, so perhaps it was left in intentionally to offset the movement difficulties when compared to the flatscreen version. It still felt next-level cerebral regardless of whether it was the intended solution or not. (and sometimes breaking the puzzle is even more fun than solving it)

The difficulty of all the puzzles ramped up at a nearly perfect level. I would always feel like I had a general understanding of what needed to be done, but then be forced to revise my evaluation as I got deeper into each puzzle. The puzzle would clearly convey what pieces were needed, and then the task of finding out how to get the needed pieces to the location in question became the trick to solving the puzzle. The unorthodox applications of each mechanic would also have some basic puzzle designed to teach you about the potential use on future (sometimes even previously encountered) puzzles.

It wont be for everyone. I have a knack for these types of puzzles, and even for me, several of the puzzles were incredibly frustrating and finicky. There were one or two stars that I absolutely HAD to use the guide to be able to solve, as they were OBNOXIOUSLY obscure. A lot of the content that lets you know what exactly is going on is also conveyed through big walls of text, so if you're not big on reading, you're only getting about 50% of the context for everything.
That all said, the scenery is beautiful, index controllers are supported, the content is introspective and thought provoking, and steam has plenty of guides that cover practically everything the game has. If you can play in VR, and you have a graphics card that can handle the load, then it's one of the best VR games and/or puzzle games I've played, period.",1669272175,1669272175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The controls are a little wonky with the Valve Index but it's not a big deal. Just use your left hand to pick up the sigils and you'll be fine.

I didn't know what to expect when I bought it. I kept seeing the title pop up in old threads where people recommended their favorite VR games. I had it on my wishlist and picked it up when it was on sale. Long story short I fell in love with this game and it is one of my all time favorites now.

I loved the combination of the puzzle complexity within the 3 ancient worlds; Roman, Egyptian, and medieval. Despite being hard at times the atmosphere was always super chill until you got to the very last level before you beat the game. The only level that required a time limit was the very last one. The music is great and appropriately themed for each of the three worlds. There are easter eggs everywhere if you look for them. The puzzles range from being pretty easy and able to be done in a few minutes to extremely difficult that may stump you for over an hour or longer.

Solving these puzzles using moveable components in a life-sized setting is something that in my opinion should only be experienced in VR and it works so well. You won't be able to get that same effect of feeling like you are there within the massive and complicated puzzle unless you're playing it in VR.

The lore is deep enough to be interesting but not overly complicated and it's certainly not half-assed like most games. It delves into AI, the past, and the future. It doesn't get as deep as SOMA but it's interesting enough. It's all a nice medley of concepts that merge together wonderfully and make for a game that I always looked forward to playing and I'd want to read everything I came across.

It's funny that the puzzles can seem so daunting at first but then when you solve them they seem easy in retrospect. I recommend not looking at any guides, videos, or walkthroughs and trying to solve the puzzles completely on your own. If you're stumped by one, move onto the next one, and come back to it tomorrow.

My favorite thing about the game other than the feeling of solving a puzzle was the nostalgic library assistant '90's computer terminals that you interact with on every level.

In conclusion, it's a must-play VR game if you are into puzzles, especially if you're at all interested in the future of AI and ancient cultures. I'd love to see these developers make more games like this. I honestly can't even comprehend how a team of people can make puzzles this complicated to solve. It kind of blows my mind.

You wouldn't assume it's any different from the regular version, but VR adds depth to small things that you wouldn't normally think about. You really feel like you're inside a virtual garden of Eden - visual glitches in the simulation happen to your entire field of vision, the different instruments have a ""physical feel"" to them because you handle them precisely using motion controllers, Elohim's voice really is coming from all around you.

It may not have the gigabytes of detailed assets of HL: Alyx, but it makes up for it with pure gameplay - there are more than 100 puzzles to figure out, and they are structured in a way where the difficulty scales very linearly. Certain concepts and tricks are introduced on earlier levels, which are then expanded upon for later levels. The environments are beautiful and pleasant to spend time in, the game doesn't rush you for anything and you are free to explore. There are plenty of hidden secrets and puzzles to discover. The soundtrack is excellent. If you are sick of cheap Quest2 Beat Saber clones definitely give this a try.

It is of course more immersive as VR always will be, but there are some trade-offs as things can be a bit more clunky to interact with such as placing things on top of moving objects. It's also a bit less enjoyable reading off the computer screens but that's more a fault of current VR tech than anything else.

I would say if you enjoy puzzle games in VR this is an easy purchase, but regardless if you haven't played this or the original, I would recommend the original to anybody who even slightly enjoys puzzles. The story is great, the puzzles are amazing, the world is interesting and atmospheric, the secrets are very sneaky and difficult. There's pretty much nothing I can fault about the game - absolutely amazing. 

Below is my review for the original:

Easily the best puzzle game I have ever played, and it even has a fantastic story to go along with it. Numerous diverse and interesting puzzle mechanics that are used in creative and unique ways, alongside very interesting and difficult secrets that can have you searching for ages. Puzzles often require thinking multiple steps ahead to prepare things in advance to complete later sections, and rarely (if ever) is a solution immediately apparent without some thinking involved after the first few levels.

If you even SLIGHTLY enjoy puzzles then I couldn't recommend this game enough. A bargain at any price. Can't wait for the 2nd one!",1660580276,1660580276,True,0,0,0.45649072527885437,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unfortunately, most of the puzzles in the base game are mindlessly easy (coming from Stephen's Sausage Roll and The Witness, anyway) but Road to Gehenna provides some challenging and truly ingenious puzzles. Overall, the puzzle-solving is fun, and occasionally truly challenging (hence, rewarding).

There's regret.

TLDR; I loved the original Talos Principle, but I cannot recommend this version. Read below for details.

For folks using the Valve Index controllers, the controls make the game unplayable, or at best, hugely frustrating.
In the teleport movement modes, picking up an object and teleporting are mapped to the same control (squeezing the grip). So half the time when you pick something up, you also teleport. It also happens when you drop stuff, sometimes. Cue annoyingly avoidable deaths caused by teleporting into hazards instead of picking up or putting objects down.

Tapping the touchpad will also teleport you. If you turn off ""click to move"" it teleports you whenever you barely touch the touchpad. There's no way to turn off teleportation from the touchpad. To be clear - you can teleport using way too many controls. Gripping either controller, both A buttons, both touchpads, both analog sticks. The trigger is completely unused.

It's really difficult to move to locations very close to you using the teleport, since it's not point-and-move. It's more like lobbing a ball high in the air and hoping it lands in the right spot.

The above is slightly offset if you use ""Classic"" movement mode, where you just spontaneously jump when manipulating objects. But this can make many people nauseous, and there's not even a setting to change the snap-angle for rotation (no continuous rotation either).

Graphics settings are... Glitchy. Setting GPU speed to ""Ultra"" and ""Medium"" work, but ""High"" and ""Low"" cause huge glitches (everything monochrome purple, or vanishing textures, etc). Mixed Reality settings can crash your headset entirely (even on a Windows MR headset).

There's individual finger tracking... But it doesn't actually [i]do[/i] anything.

You will wake up in a garden and hear the words of Elohim, god-like creature claiming to have created you, guiding you one of his children to a temple and telling you to pass different kind of tests.

You will learn that you should be collecting Sigils to progress. Each of these is at the end of a spatial puzzle. Each of the puzzles is taking place in a closed area that can often feel like a labyrinth. You will have to deal with forcefields, sentinels (some explode when you walk closer to them), laser guns, closed door etc. For that you can use one or more tools you will get on your journey. For example, one tool will allow you to redirect laser beams, other will disable a forcefield or stop a sentinel in its track. There is also a cube that you can use in various ways (climb, or use to put pressure on something) and a fan that allows you to get to difficult to access places for example. One of the weirdest tools is a recording device (when you need two people to solve the puzzle).

The Sigils you will be collecting have a form of a tetrimino and are used to unlock doors. You will unlock a way to other very distinct worlds. In each world there is a hub from which there are doors leading to other parts of that one world. There you have the individual puzzles rewarding you with the Sigils. The Sigils have different colors and the difficulty of the puzzles is also reflected in that. You will start with collecting Green and Yellow Sigils mostly and these puzzles are quite easy. The green ones are good introductory puzzles, yellow ones are about testing what you learned from the green ones. In the later stages of the game all you will be collecting are red tetriminos and it is where it starts to get complicated. While exploring the worlds and solving puzzles you might come across golden stars. Those you can also collect and will take you through a hidden door to other puzzles. In order to get a golden star you will have to think outside of the individual puzzles, you will often need tools from different puzzles. There are different ways how to solve these and are very fun. Actually sometimes you won't even see the star itself, you will just encounter something that's not supposed to be there and after you get there you will discover a star. All the puzzles are very satisfying to solve and the star challenges were really brilliant and often breathtaking. The names of the puzzles are something to pay attention to, especially if you get stuck because they will give you a hint.

One of the great things is also the fact that you don't need to do any of the puzzles in a certain order but you do need to collect specific tetriminos and certain amount of stars in order to open doors. It gives you freedom and also won't frustrate you if you get stuck. You can just go do different puzzles and come back (to realize how simple the solution was). All the puzzles are very well designed and while some need you to stack objects in a certain way you will mostly be thinking about how to effectively use the tools at your disposal since you've got a limited amount which is lower than the number of obstacles.

While exploring you will encounter QR messages from other children, audio logs, and (beeping) terminals. This is where the story part of the game takes places. When you hear a beeping sound and go closer you will discover a terminal on which you can read messages and articles from a corrupted archive and this way you will learn that something went terribly wrong. You will start asking yourself questions and later you will start a conversation with conscious artificial intelligence. It is here where most of the philosophical questions will be asked. This being will start questioning you and you will have to think hard how to answer. Your point of view will then be questioned and it is up to you whether you change your mind or not. The thing is, you are a robot while you think you are a human being, but are you?

You will start to think about mythology, eternal life, God, technology and (trans)humanity. Maybe you'll start pondering about your own future and the future of today's society. You will always be given a lot of time to ponder about all these questions and doing puzzles in the meantime. When you hear the next beep, you will most probably be ready for next encounter.

The conscious in the computer system will start making you doubt your creator - Elohim. You will most probably start questioning Elohim (hopefully because than the game will end prematurely) and start wondering what's at the top of the Tower which he forbid you to visit and will remind you of it whenever you start climbing up. If you decide to climb the tower you will learn even more and will still be able to decide what the outcome of the game will be.

I'm not entirely sure how to write about all that is going on in the game, I'm not that good of a writer. The experience is very unique and personal. The story is very deep, poses very important questions and everything is very well written. In all that there is even room for humor.

Even though I wanted to end the review here, I should also comment on graphics and sound. The game is very beautiful. The environments are large and I spent hours just walking around enjoying the view, the atmospherical effects and even tried to reach different places to see the environment from different point of views. This sometimes resulted in me stumbling upon a golden star. I had no problems with performance in VR and enjoyed a crystal clear and sharp textures all the time no matter how fast I moved or how close I was a wall. I was actually surprised how well the game looks on Rift because many games don't that great compared to Index. I would have never guessed this game is from 2014. Music and sound is excellent. Music is a delight and I'd just stand on the beach, watch the setting sun and listen to the music. The little voice acting there is, is impeccable - in terms of it makes you feel emotions and not many games I played achieved that.

Verdict:
I bought this game for the puzzles but very soon realized that it is not about the puzzles. While the game can be played just as a puzzle game, and very good one, you will miss a lot if you ignore the story. The story is philosophical, thought-provoking, well written. The game has a very good learning curve, is also well structured and offers even more challenging puzzles to hardcore players. The game environments are distinct, beautiful, breathtaking and simply serene. The music is soothing for the soul. In overall it is a perfect game.",1637586298,1637586298,True,3,0,0.538461506366729736,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Cet avis est simple : il s'agit du meilleur jeu de réalité virtuelle auquel j'ai joué jusqu'à présent et pourtant, les puzzle games ont le même effet répulsif sur moi qu'une messe dans une mosquée pour Eric Zemmour. Seulement, voilà : la VR se prête à merveille au gameplay et à la dynamique de jeu de ""The Talos Principle"", ainsi qu'à ses ambiances envoûtantes prenant place dans l'univers gréco-romain, en Egypte antique ou dans le Moyen Âge chrétien de l'Europe (les férus mélancoliques d'histoire et de vieilles ruines émouvantes comme moi vont adorer - non, je ne parle pas de la chanteuse Madonna, là) ; lesdites ambiances deviennent immersives comme pas possible une fois que l'on a le casque sur la tête.

Concernant le DLC ""Road to Gehenna"", je n'en dirai malheureusement pas du bien : il reprend le même principe (récupérer nos figures géométriques, donc), les mêmes environnements (pourquoi ne pas en avoir créé au moins un nouveau, comme la Chine de Confucius ou les goulags de Staline ?) mais pousse les énigmes jusqu'à un niveau de complexité parfaitement inouïe. Les concepteurs n'auraient pas du oublier qu'un jeu vidéo est d'abord une récréation mentale, pas une torture cérébrale. Bref, j'ai décidé de ne pas terminer ce DLC.

[h1]Техническая часть[/h1] 
Изначально игра не сильно подготовлена, но это связано с тем, что существует много разновидностей шлемов, компьютерного железа, ну и в конечном итоге предпочтений самих людей. Эту игру реально нужно изначально хорошо настроить, и хвала разрабам, она позволяет это сделать, как в графическом плане, так и в плане управления.
Это не первая ВР в которую я начал играть, но она была первой, где я для передвижения не использовал так называемые телепортации, а решил использовать реалистичное движение. По началу вестибулярному аппарату было очень тяжело, но я этого хотел, понимая что впереди ещё много других игр, где реальное передвижение дают лучшие впечатления от игры, нежели комфортные телепортации, потому продолжал это делать, чему в конечном итоге я благодарен этой игре, которая буквально натренировала мой вестибулярный аппарат (первые 2 часа были очень тяжелыми, после 10 часов уже особых проблем не было, а спустя 20 уже даже не задумываешься об этом, ощущаешь себя абсолютно комфортно).
Я также исправил множество проблем в моем шлеме и графических проблем (использовал драйвер NVidia 445.87 и Vulkan, только в этом сочетании игра выдавала лучший фпс, настройки были высокие), и рад что сделал это в этой спокойной игре, где ты можешь находиться сколько угодно, где время не является решающим фактором.
 
[h1]Игровая часть[/h1] 
Спустя столь долгое время я хоть и помнил в общих чертах как игра выглядела, но я буквально позабыл все головоломки которые там были, даже существование некоторых инструментов в головоломках забыл. К счастью. И рад был вновь проходить эту игру, будь то в первый раз, хоть уже и в ВР. После прохождения я смотрел как выглядит ПК версия, и могу с уверенностью сказать, что это очень качественный порт в ВР, её точно отшлифовывали под ВР долгое время, потому что версии очень сильно отличаются если смотреть на детали и механики. К примеру те же терминалы или QR коды отображаются иначе потому что в ВР мелкий текст сложно читать. Все головоломки проходились хорошо, будь то изначально игра задумывалась под ВР, потому было учтено очень много различных особенностей, и все они проходились без каких либо проблем (не требовалось каких то особых ВР выкрутасов, чтобы достичь какой то цели, все было очень линейно и плавно).
 
[h1]Сюжетная часть[/h1] 
Эта игра не для веселья, это головоломка с очень глубоким философским лором, и будучи взрослым, в этот раз я иначе воспринял эту игру.
Игра через терминалы постоянно задает вопросы, от простых таких как: [b]""В чем смысл жизни?""[/b], до сложных: [b]""Что значит быть человеком?""[/b].
Пока ты играешь в эту игру, ходишь по местам умерших цивилизаций, и получая ощущение того, что место, где ты находишься, существует уже тысячелетия, ты порой сам задаешься вопросами, которые игра тебе прямо нигде не задает, таких как: [b]""Что будет после смерти?""[/b] или [b]""Какого это жить бессмертным?""[/b].
Все неспроста, в этой игре вообще все неспроста, эта игра очень продумана и в плане механик, и в плане визуала, и в плане философии, объединив все воедино в одну эту игру.
Эта игра не для всех. Я бы естественно рекомендовал эту игру всем и всея, но я также понимаю что она специально проектировалась таким образом, чтобы отсеивать. Далеко не все её пройдут. И я также понимаю что те избранные, сами найдут эту игру.
Терминалы в игре давали крупицы информации, различных, зачастую повреждённых файлов, за счет которых можно было примерно понять где ты находишься, какой сейчас год, что ты такое, и в чем цель. Но этой информации было так мало и иногда она бывала так трудно доступна, что ты понимал, что так и не сможешь собрать всю картину происходящего... Но практически все терминалы объединяла одна вещь ""Ошибка: сеть недоступна."" что подтолкнула меня на мысль, что ответы нужно искать за границей этой игры, где сеть есть, то есть наш интернет.
Да, интернет огромная штука и там можно найти что угодно, но лишь задав правильный вопрос, ты сможешь найти нужный ответ, и сейчас мы ограничены своими же знаниями, что бы задавать эти правильные вопросы, но я смог ответить на свой вопрос, у меня буквально сложился пазл в голове, истинного понимания нашего мира и сути вещей. Спасибо проекту Сома/Талос, и всем кто в нем участвовал.
 
И все же, [u]что значит быть человеком?[/u] 
Я бы мог ответить по философски: [u]Значит понимать слова.[/u] 
Или по научному: [u]Значит иметь сознание.[/u]

Admitted, with those settings I'm not getting solid 90 fps - in extremely large locations I do go below 90 fps, but most places are 90 fps.

I was amazed with how awesome the graphics look - actually just played some DeMagnete, and the contrast coming to Talos VR was really great, like mind-blowingly great. Talos VR has close to Alyx graphics, and I don't state that lightly. Of course Alyx wins, but using Ultra settings in Talos VR the dynamic lights and shadows are fantastic. I guess texture quality isn't quite similar to Alyx, but Croteam adds a layer of additional details when you get close to textures - it looks amazing.

Your hands look great too - not better than Alyx with the gravity gloves, but apart from Alyx I'm not sure I can recall a game with much better VR hands :-)

В игре нет опции играть сидя, есть опция скалирования мира в диапазоне 50-100%, которая должна заменять сидячий режим, но всё равно ощущения странных масштабов мира не покидает если её юзать.

Часто возникают проблемы с поставить что то в определённое место или взять, возможно это из-за изменения масштабов мира, но на поздних этапах где есть загадки на время это адски бесит.

Проходил эту версию только из-за планов перепройти игру, и уж лучше бы перепрошёл плоскую, а зная о проблемах с vr версией даже не стал бы её покупать.

Wow. This game has really been amazing so far but this port to VR is simply revolting. Walking, picking up items, entering the gate-puzzles, interacting with ladders, all of it takes twice as long in VR than if you were to just play the original version of the game. This just feels a like a cash-grab with none of the attention to detail put into the original. This is not meant to be a fun experience, just to cash in on VR-Gimmicks.

Here is a solid piece of evidence for how bad the Port is based on the Steam achievements Global stats:
54% of players actually beat the first 1/4 of the standard game (The Land of Death Achievement)
9% of players actually beat the first 1/4 of the VR game (The Land of Death Achievement)
^^There is a reason that only 1/6 of the player base reaches this checkpoint in the the VR edition. Its because they get frustrated with the port and quit.

This game is absolutely beautiful!  I love the puzzles and the little bits of story I've uncovered are fascinating!  

A bug in the game prevents moving beyond the first area.  You reach an elevator, push the button and it just *buzzes* but never moves the elevator. 

I've found multiple forums talking about it (including the community board here on steam).  Croteam has known about it and apparently not bothered to fix it since 2019.  The advice I've found is to just try pushing the button from different angles until it registers. I've tried pretty much every angle, depth of push, and quickness of push imaginable with zero luck.  I emailed them for support 10 days ago with no response at all.  Steam refuses to even consider a refund because I've played for more than two hours (most of that time spent backtracking thinking I must have missed something to unlock the elevator and they immediately close every ticket I send them asking them to communicate with me about WHY I'm asking for a refund.

Talos nie jest grą stricte pod VR, ale został na gogle sportowana i działa bardzo dobrze.

Talos to zbiór zagadek logicznych o różnym stopniu trudności, po których przejściu dostajemy puzzle rodem z tetrisa, które później służą nam do odblokowywania kolejnych etapów. Gra nie różnie się absolutnie niczym od wersji bez VR w tytule. Również narracja została nienaruszona, dalej jest to filozoficzna opowieść w dodatku w jeżyku polski wraz z dubbingiem co zbyt często się nie zdarza i warto to docenić, że Polska wersja nie zaginęła przy portowaniu. Dla osób wrażliwych gra posiada poruszanie skokowe. Nie jest to teleportacja, gdyż wszelkie zagrożenia chcące nam zrobić krzywdę zauważą, że będziemy przechodzić przez ich pole widzenia i zaatakują nas. Nie da się też w ten sposób skakać po wszystkim jak kozica górska. Dla mniej wrażliwych na ruch można poruszać się na gałce analogowej.

Nie ma tu zbyt wielu rzeczy, które dawałyby nam się bawić, w sensie cegłówek, liści i temu podobnych. Wszystko co można ruszyć jest ściśle związane z mechaniką gry. Jeśli coś można podnieść, znaczy, że jest nam potrzebne. Nie ma tu zapychaczy, ani rzeczy, które nas rozpraszają. Ani przez chwilę nie miałem potrzeby by sprawdzić, czy ten, czy tamten przedmiot da się podnieść, a zwykle gdy w gry VR gram, to jest to pierwsze co robię. Interfejs też jest znakomicie przemyślany, gdyż prawie go nie ma. Na rękach mamy zebrane elementy. Jedynie klikając przycisk otwierający menu psuje ten efekt, gdyż dostajemy brzydkie czarne tło z napisami, które kompletnie psują nam klimat.

The big draw to The Talos Principle is the philosophical story, and the mystery and all that.

To earn that you have to do endless amounts of these boring puzzles that are all kinda similar to each other.

Ideally you'd want to play alot of this on your monitor, but surprise! You have to buy the original version for that! It's just like Skyrim or all the other Croteam games. They're reselling the whole game again with the VR addon packaged. Both titles are 40 dollars. I'm not saying they can't sell the VR game for the same price as the other one, or have to package the port as a DLC instead. This would be fine if you could play the VR version on a monitor, but if you don't have the original game, you can't, and if you do, you still have to install both games and futz with the save files! There's a chance I'm wrong, or that maybe (with mods or something) you can play the game in 2d mode without buying the original package, if so, disregard. Still, Croteam and Bethesda price gouged on their VR ports like mad, and these are games that haven't been updated in years.

The VR elements are a major improvement over the original interactive controls but do not augment the gameplay in a meaningful way. However if you have not, this is a good excuse it again, with the added suffering of collecting all the stars by not just thinking outside of the box, but becoming the box itself. 

Anyway, with that out of the way I'll review this from a fresh faced never played the pancake version before perspective. The Talos Principle is not necessarily a bastion of brand new ideas or a roadmark in the progression of the gaming industry, but is instead a culmination and even perfection of already existing functionality and mechanics. Despite not being something completely new or inventive, this is an incredibly memorable experience that will leave you thinking long after you finish the game. 

Starting with the VR implementation, quite frankly it's fantastic. The range of configuration options is extreme and even a little overwhelming so definitely take some time to dial it all in for the best experience. The texture quality is exceptional, and you'll notice this especially on higher settings as your framerate absolutely tanks. I'm running a 2080 Ti and it was working out like a procrastinator two weeks before a marathon. Interactivity is fluid and intuitive, especially with the Index controllers; however using the computer terminals could become a bit of a chore and I'm sure there's a better implementation for such a large part of the game. As someone with fairly strong VR legs (I do my virtual squats), I can't vouch too reliably for motion sickness induction, though I can safely say it's not great, but not [i] horrible /[i].

I'll not be covering the main game elements as they're already reviewed to death on the pancake version of the game, so for a look into the actual gameloop quality head over there. All I'll say is, the game is an absolute masterpiece and a serious treat.

Now the hard question: worth £30? If you've never played it before, absolutely without a doubt. If you've completed it normally with no extra content, maybe wait for £20 or so (or whatever you local currency equivalent is). If you've already played it 100%, then only if you're really bored, have too much money, or just really really want to see it in VR.

The VR port is breathtakingly beautiful, so much that it's fun to just wander around and enjoy the environment.

Unfortunately the VR controls are quite frustrating. Some puzzles require precise placement of objects (or of yourself!), which is difficult to do with teleport, often with a high cost of needing to restart / redo large chunks of a puzzle because the teleport didn't land in the right place. ""Grab"" for grab object and ""tight grab"" for teleport is insane: here comes a bomb, better not drop this thing I'm holding, oh wait I accidentally jumped directly into the bomb. Hmm. Grab really needs to be an on/off button anyway, not a touch sensor. It's too easy to drop something accidentally, or NOT drop something when trying to place it exactly.

Po przebudzeniu tajemniczy głos dobiegający ze wszystkich stron świata wyjawia nam swoje imię i nazywa swoim dzieckiem. Przemierzając ogród rozwiązujemy zagadki w celu zebrania tzw. sigili, które wyglądają po prostu jak zwykłe klocki z klasycznego ""Tetrisa"". Po zebraniu odpowiedniej ilości, możemy przy ich pomocy odblokować bramy prowadzące w różne inne zakątki świata, jednak warunek jest jeden - nie wolno nam wejść do wieży znajdującej się pomiędzy ogrodami. W trakcie podróży napotykamy na tajemnicze terminale, pliki oraz dziwne wiadomości które wprowadzają gracza w konsternację.

The Talos Principle VR to klasyczna wersja Talosa przeportowana na wirtualną rzeczywistość. Mam obie wersje i pomimo tego, że są fabularnie i zagadkowo takie same to tak naprawdę robiąc przejście z kompa na VR'a trzeba się tej gry uczyć od samego początku. Nie chodzi tutaj o inny typ sterowania - nie da się tego w pełni wyjaśnić słowami - co innego jest patrzeć na monitor i podziwiać grafikę lub detale, a zupełnie inne jest doświadczenie kiedy cały umysł przenosi się do tego świata gry. Właśnie ta imersja VR'a sprawia, że pomiędzy tymi grami jest wielka przepaść pod względem emocji jakich doświadcza gracz. 

Interakcja z przedmiotami jest podobnie jak w klasycznej wersji ograniczona wyłącznie do przedmiotów z których musimy skorzystać by popchnąć fabułę do przodu. Standardowo, mamy 3 opcje poruszania się i tryb komfort dla osób wrażliwych - osobiście polecam chociaż spróbować to wyłączyć bo świetne uczucie jest kiedy wskakuje się na trampolinę lub wentylator. 

Nie brakuje tutaj również - a jakże - bugów. Póki co udało mi się znaleźć dziwnego buga, który występuje w momencie próby wskakiwania na obiekty (w grze, nie w realu). Kiedy odpowiednio wyceluje się kontrolerem i będzie skakać przy murku to w pewnym momencie zostaniemy.........ciężko to nazwać ""wystrzeleniem"".................. po prostu wyje**** z prędkością 2,5 macha w powietrze, gdzie możemy na 2 sekundy zobaczyć całą mapę z góry, po czym uderzamy głową w ""sufit"" tego świata i spadamy pionowo jak po wielkiej linijce dokładnie w ten sam punkt z którego wystartowaliśmy. Przy kilku próbach można przebić się przez ten ""sufit"" nad którym prawo grawitacji już nie obowiązuje co jest jednoznaczne z brakiem możliwości powrotu na mapę, a każdy skok powoduje unoszenie nas coraz wyżej i wyżej aż w końcu (nie, nie spotkamy Elohima) lądujemy w limbo. Ot taki sobie bug.

Innym bugiem jaki znalazłem to brak możliwości zdobycia jednej z gwiazdek, ponieważ nie ma FIZYCZNEJ możliwości aby po zrobieniu małej wieżyczki z kostek która unosi się na głowie miny, wskoczyć na te kostki. W klasycznej wersji nie ma tego problemu, ale na VR'ze spędzając 30 minut na tym stosując wszelkie możliwe sposoby łącznie z podchodzeniem w pokoju, gra nie pozwala zrobić markera do skoku na tę wieżę, tak jakby była za daleko. Brakuje dosłownie pół metra, aby wskoczyć ale mina już bliżej nie podchodzi.

Podsumowując, gra to klasyczny Talos jednak w wersji VR doznamy dużo większych emocji poprzez przeniesienie się do świata Talosa. Dopiero tutaj można zobaczyć jak ogromny jest ten świat i jak ogromne są obiekty które zwiedzaliśmy w klasyku (o ile oczywiście miał ktoś przyjemność zagrać).

Pros:
-Very good VR Port (Played on Oculus Rift)
-The Graphics are quite good and it makes for a zen like experience just taking in those beautiful Environments
-The puzzles are amazing and there are just soooo many of them
-The Game starts out pretty easy but gets decently hard towards the end
-Most of the story is optional, but i really recommend it, it is one of the deepest and most philosopical storys i have ever encountered in a game
-It doesn't get repetitive as new puzzle elements are unlocked at every stage

Cons:
-Multiple Savegames would have been nice
-The game lacks a clear indication when it saves your Progress (but tells you ""Last Saved X Minutes ago"" so i haven't lost any Progress to it)

Overall the game is amazing and completly UNDERRATED as in my Opinion it is as good if not even better than the Portal Series. All the Cons are fairly small and nothing that would be a deal breaker for me.
If you enjoyed Portal (who hasn't) you will probably like this game too.
I recommend you buying this right now, it is totally worth the price.
If you are unsure, the game is also often on sale for 5 bucks and thats a STEAL.

This was one of my favorite games of all time before the VR version, so to be there in VR is almost a dream come true. VR is the way I'd go for this game.

There are only a few drawbacks for this VR port, which are:

1. You can't carry two items at once, just like the flat version
2. Picking up the little tetris puzzle pieces used for opening doors or unlocking puzzle objects is more annoying than it needs to be
3. If your controllers go to sleep while the game is running and you wake them back up, the game menu might have trouble recognizing them
4. No ladder climbing animations

So no serious issues at all. In this game you explore various ancient ruins, including Egypt which is a place I've been to in person, and boy did Croteam do their research. It's like this game was made for VR, some of the visuals that were impressive in the flat game are just perfect in the VR version, most notably the tower.

The puzzle design of this game is some of my favorite of all time. They are as logical as it gets as every puzzle has a specific set of tools used to solve them, so you're working within confined rules making them the opposite of the abstract puzzles you see in other games like the Myst series. Every puzzle is a straightforward logical challenge so their complexity is very impressive and clever, most notably in Road to Gehenna which must have been designed by geniuses.

Everything including the puzzles, the computer terminals, the voice in the sky, it all ties back to one of the most thematically rich and emotionally powerful stories ever written for a game. The Talos Principle was always one of the least flawed masterpieces in gaming, and the VR version is the best way to experience it.",1595550922,1595550922,True,21,0,0.723082304000854492,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I couldn't figure out how to sprint, but I did find out that holding both grip buttons on the Oculus Touch controllers sped up in-game time.

As for the ending, [spoiler] I didn't know how Croteam would achieve third person cutscenes in VR, but they managed to rework the scenes. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't do the scene with the zoom out revealing the outside and the EL Facility. I feel like they could've made this work by keeping the player stationary outside of the EL facility as the sun goes up to slowly reveal the EL facility and the world around it.

Many games that are VR-exclusive are short and gimmicky; making up for their lack of content by ""being VR"". This game is not like that. It stands on its own as a game, with the VR being a bonus added on top. The game doesn't benefit greatly from being VR, but it doesn't hurt either unless you are prone to ""VR sickness"". If you like me are used to VR movement and have a VR headset, then I recommend getting it for VR, otherwise the pancake version might suit better. I also can't guarantee that it runs well on all headsets. Personally, I had no major technical problems on my Rift CV1.

The graphics quality is decent, but environments are severely lacking in variety. The puzzles are perfectly fine, nothing revolutionary, but for the most part really enjoyable. And there are a lot of them. The game started slow with many easy puzzles at first, but the difficulty increases at the later stages and some of the puzzles (in particular some of the optional star puzzles) are pretty challenging. (I have yet to complete everything though, and I have not even touched ""Road to Gehenna"" yet.)

The philosophical discussions are above expectations in my opinion. I was worried that the game would force you to pick from a narrow set of viewpoints, lacking any real depth, and although there is some of that (thee is only so much you can fit in a finitely sized set of dialogue trees) it still posed questions that made me think - sometimes several minutes - before deciding which of the four or so options best represented my viewpoint. You can't expect maximum expressiveness, but as long as you are willing to compromise a little bit it allows for a surprising amount of introspection. The point is not to defend your world view, but to explore the options. I found that I often looked forward to the next discussion with the terminal when solving puzzles.

There were some instances where I accidentally solved some puzzles in a unintended ways; it is a bit too easy to break some levels. But at least you can't get yourself stuck, because you always have a reset-ability at your disposal.

Some minor technical problems that I experienced were some weird graphical bug when using paint cans which forced me to either restart the game or play around in the settings menu until it resolved itself. I ended up mostly avoiding the paint cans in the end. Some graphical options had weird results, but fortunately everything I cared about worked, including the default settings.

Yes, the game hasn't been made for VR and it shows, but the immersion is astonishing.
I found myself stopping with any progression to enjoy the beautiful scenery and listen to the game's calming soundtrack so often I bet it took like half my total playtime.

Pros:
[list]
[*]The game is absolutely beautiful. The visuals are a bit dated and there is some visible model pop-in, but it still looks great.
[*]Amazing soundtrack
[*]Unlike most VR games, it doesn't feel like a tech demo, but a truly complete experience.
[*]It's one of the only games out there that natively supports Linux, and I can't thank the devs enough for that.
[*]I don't know much about the story yet due to my short playtime, but it's promising. I will update this review after I finish it.
[/list]

As for the cons, there are quite a few that I cannot overlook:
[list]
[*]It doesn't make much sense to stand in the game, yet it doesn't have a seated mode. You technically can change the world scale to better fit seated gameplay, but it's not a good solution. The devs mentioned on the forums that the vr_fDesiredVRHeadHeight config option should solve it, but it doesn't do anything for me. [u]We really need a working height slider in the options![/u]
[*]Door animations are glitchy - sometimes when I insert a key into a door, the opening animation doesn't play and it appears as the door stays closed. You can still go through it, so it doesn't break the gameplay, but it's annoying
[*]Low performance on Linux - I blame that on the flawed SteamVR implementation, so I think Croteam can't really do anything about it. If you're playing on Linux, expect some minor reprojection issues when looking at some areas. Nothing really bad, but worth mentioning.
[*]If you played the flat version, I don't think it's worth paying the full price again for essentially the same thing, just way more immersive. Thankfully, I haven't played it before.

you see, the talos principle is probably one of the best games ever made. on a flat screen, its presentation, gameplay and storyline are all phenomenal.

in vr, however, the experience falls apart before it even begins. the opening cutscene is simply not there, and i suspect other cutscenes (which are few and far between I must admit) may also be missing. this is important because the big reveal at the end of the game is a flat cutscene. the base game looks fantastic for its age, but the graphics don't survive in vr. things are pixelated and blurry, models are jagged, plants are flat and fake looking. you can put your face inside anything that's not out of bounds, including cubes, jammers etc, but if you do physically walk out of bounds instead of blocking your view or something, you're jarringly and awkwardly teleported backwards. everything you can pick up is weightless and feels unpleasant to handle, things sticking to your hand rather than behaving like real objects.

[spoiler]and you know, i get it. the whole point of the talos principle is that the world [i]is[/i] fake. but a big part of that is how convincingly real everything looks at the beginning, so i fail to see this as any sort of excuse or scapegoat to have such a shoddy and shockingly lazy vr port.[/spoiler] it's buggy too - if i squeeze both of my hands into fists, all audio stops until i release them again. this is probably the best example i could find out of all the various ways the game manages to find in order to break or otherwise shatter your immersion.

i paid £4.49 for this on sale, and i've already asked for my money back. i cannot believe that they charge £30 for this normally. this is the absolute worst way to play talos principle, and charging just about £10 short of the new half life for that experience is anything from scummy through to stupid. don't waste your time, money or effort.",1587676388,1587676388,False,2,0,0.537037014961242676,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]To VR Or Not To VR?:[/h1]

VR elevates a bunch of the existing qualities here. The hand-held devices, physics interactions, and 'jungle gym' puzzle solving put you right in the centre of the action. It makes for a fun mix of cerebral tinkering followed by active enacting. (And occasionally combines the two. There's something to be said for soaring 20ft up on a column of air to get a bird's eye view of the puzzle ;))

The Cryengine locations form a lovely expansive backdrop (even if the 'photo realistic' style can't always survive you nosing right up to its more budget bump-maps). And the whole 'ghost in the machine' / 'simulated world' story gains some extra vibe when you're actually injected into those digital spaces ;)


[h1]It's A Laser Trap:[/h1]

The five core tools that you unlock aren't the only way they keep things fresh, with further twists arriving downstream. There are a few moments were they over-rely on the core techniques though. (Oh, more laser-round-an-impossible-corner conundrums?). But just as frequently they'll surprise you by making a novel physical interaction the crux of the next map, or add a new use for an environmental hazard instead.

As a puzzle game, the key thing for me was: I frequently stood in the middle of these breezy virtual spaces, hands on hips, and said: 'That's impossible'. And then worked it out anyway. Sometimes multiple times in one map . They've got the 'make you feel smart' thing pretty nailed down, with only perhaps one or two maps that bordered on feeling unfair / frustrating.


[h1]If A Story Is Trapped In A Box, Is It Really There?[/h1]

The primarily text-based story is almost entirely optional, but I found myself welcoming the dips into the computer terminals in every realm. It does help if you like ancient philosophy, arguing theology, AI ethics, and pondering the nature of 'self' though 

Not that their archive of mythical excerpts and a 'chose from these answers' interface can really encompass this spread of dialectic disagreements and contemporary mysteries. But they have a damn good go

[h1]Too Long Didn't Read Your Metaphysical Treatise:[/h1]

[b]Positives:[/b]
[list][*]Tons of content, scaling over time, with various flavours of twists to the trickiness.
[*]A playful nested story that taps into themes of consciousness, free will, ethics and theology. And then occasionally sticks its tongue out at you 
[*]Lovely settings and audio work.[/list]

[b]Negatives:[/b]
[list][*]Slow, slightly insipid, start.
[*]A couple of unintuitive story twists can leave you locked out of further progression, having to restart from a few saves back. It's clunky. (Hint: If you 'exit' from a story terminal you often can't turn it back on...)[/list]

[b]Motion Comfort:[/b]
[list][*]Despite the consummate control options, you may need your VR legs to deal with some of the shunts and jumps involved when boxes misplace or airstreams propel you sideways through the air...[/list]

[h1]Postscript:[/h1]

And I'm still going with the free DLC content, which has kept the difficulty fiendishly ramped up, and given the story some new fun twists

The only problem is Index Controller mapping, which by default jumps when you grip harder. So you pick up an object and as you grip harder, you jump. Fortunatelly, this can be reconfigured in SteamVR settings in Controller/Custom mapping. I just removed that jump action from the Grip event and saved as my own mapping. The game will reset to the original mapping each time you start it, but you can just switch to your custom (by then saved) mapping and game on. It takes 30 seconds.

Playing The Talos Principle in VR is like hacking your own consciousness. Yes, you have a brain. And you also have two hands that let you interact with this strange anachronic world of ancient ruins and technology. And you will learn it has great plans for you.

You'll go for an introspective journey that'll help you unfold your Metaphysical intelligence. The puzzles are incredibly clever and often requires you to think out of the box you were comfortable within.

You could also find yourself have a stop just to contemplate the shadows of the upper clouds sliding on those beautiful sceneries or be impressed by the gigantic size of this tower... Magical moments of VR.

The lifetime of the game is pretty larger than what we were used to up to now in VR and the VR version also includes Road to Gahenna DLC wich is awesome too.

Plus Croteam refused to fall into the wall garden strategy trap that FB/Oculus was offering them. So it's still available here for every VR player today. We, as users, could reward this attitude if we care about standing for freedom of choice in this merciless world.

That's a fair price in regards to what a good VR portage it is, and VR definitely unleash the beauty of this existential work of art. [/quote]",1577641090,1577641391,True,4,0,0.488711804151535034,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Графика радует глаз, музыка радует слух, а качество перевода (и озвучки, и титров) вызывает только гордость за отечественных локализаторов. Попадая внутрь игры, можно легко забыть о реальном мире, настолько сильно передается атмосфера. Это всё уже не единожды было воспето. От себя хочется отметить следующее: Дойдя до края игрового пространства, ты не чувствуешь, что банально упёрся в край, за которым осталось на пару шагов текстур, а то, что в тот обширный открытый мир, из которого веет ветерком, тебе запрещено высшим разумом. Нельзя просунуть голову сквозь текстуру, чтобы подсмотреть и сжульничать. Эффекты глюков картинки усиливают эффект реальности окружающей тебя нереальности. И уже за одно это можно купить принцип Талоса в свою коллекцию.

  Что касается игрового процесса, то через несколько часов рутинной расстановки предметов (их в арсенале всего несколько), я понял, что так же красиво, как у Бенуа Сокаля вовсе не значит, что это и так же увлекательно. А когда прошёл первый мир, стало откровенно скучно. Вся игра, это решение «шахматных задачек» двух типов – за сигил в отдельно взятой комнате и за звезду, которая может быть и вне комнаты. С ростом сложности на «шахматные доски» подбрасываются новые фигурки, которые открываются за добытые сигилы. Что касается сигилов, добыть их вполне реально и собственным умом, со звездами же задачи на голову сложнее. Здесь мыслить предстоит нестандартно, не забывать, что фигурки запрещено выносить только через парадный вход и что прятаться они могут вне комнат, и даже быть готовым искать чёрную кошку в тёмной комнате. А если вы не входите в 5% особо одарённых логиков, то пару-тройку раз вам всё же придется признать свою несостоятельность при обращении к прохождению. Может быть, это дань уважения Стратону и его «принципу Талоса»? Если «даже самый верный философ не сможет жить без своей крови», то почему самый упорный игрок должен обходиться без солюшена? Лично я окончательно развёл руками после того, как пять раз ставил куб на курсирующего дроида, и пять раз он с него сваливался. А дело было в том, что куб нужно было ставить на дроида немного дальше по его курсу. По мне это абсурд, обманом разрушивший ход моих умозаключений и указавший мне на выход из апартаментов сильнейших логиков.

パズルと言っても、一定の動きを繰り返す「自爆する球体型メカ」や「設置型のガトリング砲」を 、「動きを止めるビーム発射タレット」を動かしてゴールまでの道を切り開く、言葉にすると物騒だが、荘厳な雰囲気やBGM、謎の多いSFの様なファンタジーの様な神秘的な世界観が彩る、（ガトリングの見た目以外は）血生臭さの欠片もない微アクション含有のパズルゲーム。

My first impression was it looks stunning. I have a fairly high end setup and ran everything in ultra which may have helped. The first world is reasonably large and the game takes you through the first easy tutorial levels without it feeling too forced. The puzzle pieces themselves are not new lazers, blocks & switches and there are a few baddies orbs and guns. I didn't have any trouble getting into the game and getting solving. I think I cleared 2/3 of the first world in about 3 hours, including some exploring of the wider areas.

Then things start to get tricky. There are a few more tools to play with and some far more complex puzzles. One mistake I made was to stop for a few weeks then went back to it. I'd forgotten a few key tricks and that made working out some of the later puzzles much harder than they needed to be. Though tricky they rarely felt impossible and I only came close to reaching for a walk through twice. I'm not sure if it's a spoiler but every puzzle is contained in its box, getting stars on the other hand often requires thinking outside the box.

As you get used to the style of puzzles the story and philosophies discussed in Talos do become more engaging. I liked listening to what she had to say and reading the material was an interesting break that adds to the feeling of progression more than just ""here comes another puzzle"". Talking to the serpent did bug me occasionally because sometimes you're limited to a small number of unhelpful responses, but its only for a bit and it gets better. And personally I'm not overly keen on the getting killed by baddies in puzzle games. Really a baddie is not much different to a door (i.e. you can't pass till you get the key) but they reset all the solution you had so far. So you have to redo the part of the solution you already puzzled out. Not so bad at the start but when it's the last thing and you get caught on a wall or rotate accidentally it feels like you've been cheated.

Given the subject matter it shouldn't be surprising but I found it made me feel quite lonely on occasion!

There were only a few  puzzles where I felt the answer relied too heavily on precise placements or dodgy physics (maybe there was a better answer) and I could forgive it because they were rare and the sense of achievement from completing a puzzle that has had you stumped is always good.

In short it's a good puzzle game with an engaging story and well worth the asking price.

Si no se puede jugar sentado, ¿por qué mienten en la ficha? 

En realidad, con otros visores si se puede, además de Rift S tengo un WMR de HP, con estas como le indico desde la configuración del visor la altura que yo quiera, pues le pongo mi altura en la posición sentada, y entonces en el juego es como si estuviese de pie aun estando sentado.

Since the exact same review still applies, I'm going to copy-paste it here. However, before that some comments about this VR version.

Firstly, for anybody who already owns the original non-VR version, be advised: This is *exactly* the same game as the original, with the exact same content. The only difference is that it's in stereoscopic VR, with VR controls. However, that being said, if it has been a long time since you played the original (as was my case) it may still be worth to grab this, in order to re-experience the game in VR.

Secondly, many people are saying in their reviews that this has poor support for Oculus Rift controllers. I don't understand what they are saying since that's not my experience at all. I have the Oculus Rift S, and the game plays perfectly with it. I have not noticed any issues of any kind.

The game can be controlled with the ""teleporting"" mechanic, or with the free-movement mechanic (ie. you move with the left joystick, as with any FPS game). The camera can be rotated with the right stick, either as normal, or in steps (45 degrees) for comfort. Personally I find this mode of control (free movement with left stick, rotation in steps with right stick) the best. (I do not suffer any sort of motion sickness in this mode, no matter how fast I move in game with the left stick.) It can be played sitting down or standing up. (I recommend a rotating chair, if sitting down.)

Given that the original game looks quite beautiful, and the VR version uses the same graphics, it makes this one of the best-looking VR games out there, which is really nice. It might need a relatively hefty PC to run smoothly, though (I myself have a high-end i9 CPU and a GTX 1080, and the game works very smoothly, with only really rare hiccups sometimes. They happen so rarely that they aren't bothersome.)

My original review of the non-VR game:

During the past few years I have played many, many games, the vast majority of them being mediocre, and even the best of them being just ""ok"". Too often have I felt that game developers are running out of ideas, or lack the talent to make a good idea into a great game... Too often have I felt that playing a game through is more a chore than a delight.

The Talos Principle, however, feels like a breath of fresh air. It has been a really long time since I have felt so enthralled by a video game, since I have been so involved and so addicted with a game that I have to play for hours to discover what new the game has to offer, since I have been so motivated to find every single secret, and solve every single puzzle even if optional.

Among countless mediocre and ok at best video games that inundate the market, The Talos Principle is certainly a gem. It might not be for everybody, but it certainly was for me.

If you liked Portal and Portal 2, chances are that you will like this. It's somewhat similar in gameplay and even in idea, but certainly without being a ripoff or clone in any significant way.

I still haven't climbed the tower. The Talos Principle must not apply.

The environment is perfect for VR. It can be hard to max out without reprojection though, so having an Index in 144hz mode really helps since then it drops to 72fps instead of 60 or if you have a Rift S what.. 40?(!)fps. I have a pretty powerful PC but without risking pop-in with the LoD, at native res, I still can't keep things at a lofty framerate without reprojection. Such is VR though. Having full finger control is pretty great too though and it works well.

My only complaints are the autotargeting of placing objects can suck, and having grip be Grab AND Jump was an odd decision. There's already the A button for Jump so I have accidentally moved while attempting to pick up an object dozens of times. Also needing to keep your finger on the track pad when placing sigils in the door puzzles seems like a bad holdover from Vive Wand controls.

Other than that this game has been one of my favorite experiences period.

E' un gioco che probabilmente non avrei mai acquistato per giocarci su monitor, sbagliando, poichè la trama è un qualcosa di intrigante, profondo e toccante. Inutile dire che giocato in prima persona è stato fantastico poichè la grafica è una delle migliori che ho provato sin ora su VR (1080 impostando tutto a palla) e soprattutto è un gioco con ambientazioni che lasciano spesso a bocca aperta, con musiche di atmosfera anche se ripetitive a volte. Non essendo un gioco frenetico dove c'è da sparare me lo sono goduto appieno sfruttando il movimento libero (soffro pochissimo il motion sickness) dando così un senso di immersività impareggiabile e le ore che ci ho giocato lo dimostrano. Da dicembre ho scaricato molti altri giochi per vr, di vario genere, ma questo mi ha tenuto incollato più degli altri, che per un motivo o per l'altro ho abbandonato dopo un ora. Ho finito ieri anche il dlc e merita tantissimo pure lui, specialmente per le vertigini che mi ha fatto provare facendo certi salti..chi non ha provato mai un VR non può capire cosa si prova a buttarsi nel vuoto da un ponte, seppur virtuale! E' un genere che non avevo mai provato e sono rimasto sorpreso perchè il senso di appagamento nel risolvere gli enigmi è stato notevole e la frustrazione si è presentata di rado. Se avete un VR non fatevelo scappare, probabilmente a livello di immersività e appagamento grafico non esiste di meglio sul mercato, a patto di non abbandonarlo alle prime difficoltà, perchè la storia si fa intrigante dopo qualche ora.

Runs well enough, especially given the sorcery that is asynchronous timewarp.

I mean sure, whenever I looked on the backside off my right hand there was a huge black rectangle blocking basically everything, the controls were unintuitive at best and somewhere around 20hrs in a patch landed reconfiguring the controls which I had internalized by then. Go figure. 

Now, just after 33 hours, I'm pretty positive I've got all sigils and stars from the main game as well as Road to Gehenna. You could say I've made it to the hall of fame, which took me quite by surprise.
But let's be honest, I had to look up the eagle's landing just like everyone else. The rest was all me, though.

But all in all, what's my verdict? The VR implementation feels rushed and unpolished, the puzzles are not for everyone and some can be quite maddening. The story will not allow you to major in any kind of philosophics course and coop is basically just you playing with yourself. 
You here for any of that? Well, buy it anyways, keep your mind open, answer as you actually would when asked and just be part of the world you'll find yourself in. You might just learn something or another about yourself. I sure did.
And even though the graphics are quite a bit dated nowadays; the visuals are plain stunning. Same goes for the amazing soundtrack. And the terminals. Especially the terminals.

These 33 hours will not be my final time for this experience. I still need to take a friend with me, even though he declined the first time around; and I'll try not to be as stubborn with strangers in far lands from now on.

03.: Die Steurung lässt sich wirklich sehr gut konfigurieren, alle Wünsche offen.
04.: Für Knobelfans ist an alles gedacht, bisher kaum Zeitlimits, man kann sich alles genau anschauen.
05.: Es basiert weitesgehenst auf physikalischer Basis. (Kein Kreuzen von Lichtstrahlen, etc.) Also alles logisch wie ich es liebe.
06.: Es wird eine Geschichte darum erzählt, da kommt wieder die Vertonung ins Spiel.
07.: Man merkt das mit der gegeben Welt was nicht stimmt, alâ Matrix also ""forscht"" man weiter.
08.: Die Idee mit den C64 am jeweiligen Level Start (oder ähnliches) den man abfragen kann verdichtet die Story.
09.: Man wird ""seicht"" in die kommenden Aufgaben invulviert, kein ""Was ist das denn jetzt?""
10.: Obwohl wenig erklärt wird wie es denn nun weiter geht ist das Einfinden in da Spiel sehr gut gemacht.
11.: Zwar wohl kein Open World aber abzulaufen um ein paar Goodies abzugreifen ist da. (Man freut sich diebisch wenn man wa gefunden hat was nicht auf der Karte ist.)
12.: Kann ich echt empfehlen! War ja ein ""Form"" Fan und darüber kam nichts. Ich revediere meine Meinung.
Wer ""Form"" mal gespielt hat und eine ""bodenständige"" Alternative sucht wird hier fündig.

This is one of those games where the less you know about it, the better it will be.

It has physics puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, and some puzzles you really need to think outside the box to solve.

If you like those things, this is definitely worth a go.


The technical details:

i played with an oculus rift, and i did find i had to change graphic settings to swap the game from using Steamvr to using the oculus one in order to unlock the ability to jump, as some puzzles are impossible without it. bear this in mind if you have one also.

For movement, the game has some options you can choose, from basic point and teleport to classic analog, i did not get motion sickness from this but i ended up using teleport anyway simply because it was quicker, but i think this gave me an unfair advantage in time limited puzzles.

There is some comfort options to help those who get motion sick easily, but i ended up disabling them because all they really did was limit my vision and cause confusion with unexpected camera changes.

You can change the scale of the world, making the world smaller so you can reach higher things while sat down, which i did because i am too lazy to stand up, but could be a very helpful feature for those who cant stand up.


The negatives:

i had trouble with some puzzles, not because i couldn't figure them out, not because they were very complicated or difficult to pull off, but because the way the game lets you move objects can be unreliable.

It works by displaying a silhouette of the object you're holding where you point your controller, sometimes with the silhouette being directly on top of puzzle objects if you point at it.

I solved some puzzles way to early because for some reason an item i was trying to place ended up on a pressure plate behind a wall i couldn't see, opening up the prize room early and pretty much ruining the puzzle.

i ended up outright unable to solve some puzzles because an item phased through a wall after being placed and ended up out of the map bounds, and sometimes even inside a different puzzle room, making that one stupidly easy.

i spent way too long on simple puzzles because the item just would not plant where i wanted, even though it's placement silhouette is where i wanted it. 
[spoiler]Moving platforms are unnecessarily difficult to put items on[/spoiler]

Настроек VR очень много, но они не переведены; есть даже поддержка API, за что разработчикам отдельное спасибо. Отмечу сразу немногочисленные минусы:
● Телепорт в некоторых головоломках является читерным: можно нажать на кнопку для вентилятора и и телепортироваться на этот вентилятор – он подбросит вас. Но таких ситуаций очень мало. В DLC я встречал такое 2-4 раза, учитывая звёзды
● Гораздо более важным является изучение мира – некоторые QR-коды не читаются, за F8 E8 F4 F0 EE E2 E0 ED ED FB E9 20 F2 E5 EA ст удобно читать используя телефон, а в VR-шлеме это очень неудобно
● На определенных настройках графики [spoiler](уже не помню каких, что-то связанное с тенями)[/spoiler], [url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xvc-DJ6j8CZeK88LiwC9KT1tERF-MBe1/view?usp=sharing]некоторые объекты[/url] на одном глазу чёрные, на другом – нет (наверное, вы понимаете, что на такой объект больно смотреть)

Maybe puzzle games just aren't my thing. The game started off okay but then was very boring and repetitive. Don't understand the hype at all.

It's a port to VR, but still makes use of motion controllers. Given that it's a puzzle game though, the additional immersiveness of VR doesn't add as much to the game as something like Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. It's still worth playing in VR, but I wouldn't bother buying the VR version if you already have the non-VR version.

A warning for achievement hunters: leaving the terminals till the end may make it faster to get all achievements, but the game is *much* more enjoyable if you read them as you go.

Pros:
- Uses tracked motion controllers
- Movement is heavily customizable, supporting both teleport and traditional movement, snap and smooth turning, and reducing FOV to prevent motion sickness
- Includes the DLC
- The difficulty curve from easy puzzles to harder ones is good
- Lots to explore and find, with multiple endings possible
- There are backups automatically created that you can restore to get other ends/achievements without having to replay the whole game
- I thoroughly enjoyed the story, especially the audio logs
- Road to Gehenna is a brilliant addition

Cons:
- I found the elevator buttons to be really finicky to push
- Towards the end the tetromino puzzles get really large and difficult. Personally I didn't enjoy them so I ended up just using a guide to get past them. I'm not sure how this could be improved though.

I played a few houres of the non-VR and absolutely loved it. Then i saw this game on sale and also saw that the Serious Sam VR bundle (Which i was going to buy) was only 50cents cheaper than the Croteam VR bundle that included all Serious Sam VR games + The Talos Principle VR so i thought i might give it a try in VR. Teleportation weirdly gave me a headache but walking locomotion works fine for me.
It allows you to transfer over your Non-VR save (only from non-VR to VR and not in the other direction). 
The VR version feels way better. The immersion you get from VR is great for puzzle games (epecially ones that look this great) and it is all portet perfectly.
I don't know how long the game is but it is a port from a non-VR game so it is on the longer side (I played 5 houres and am no where near the end). The VR version also adds the DLC ""Road to Gehenna"" for free.
It would honestly be worth the asking price for me but if you are sceptical you can wait for a sale (it is usually around 5€ 
when its on sale)
A must have for anyone who like puzzle games (i got it because i loved solving puzzles in Portal) and it gets quite challenging at times (Eventhough I'm only 5 houres in). I dont want to talk too much about the story but lets just say it gives you something to think about when you are stuck in puzzles.

In contrast to other VR games I did not encounter any technical issues with the controllers, startup issues or such with my Windows MR headset. Moreover they offer an astonishing level of customization of the controls and the ways of movement. (I prefer continous movement, but discrete turing at 45° angles, for instance.) The game works smooth on my GeForce 1050 Ti with relatively high graphics settings (higher than auto-detected).

The VR experience however is mixed bag. Yes, the ability to look around is nice, but this is not needed often for the game itself. Certainly not when running through narrow corridors within puzzles. What's more important then is a snappy navigation. And that's a problem: If I don't configure different controllers I constantly inadvertedly turn instead of running straight, so I bump into walls too often. The discrete turning makes loosing orientation easy (but using continuous rotation makes me go crazy immediately). Given that in later levels movement speed and precision are crucial (e.g. when moving between hovering mines) the VR version makes the game harder than it should be.

What's more, some of the easter eggs where you pick things up [spoiler](such as a message in a bottle"")[/spoiler] simply don't work for me with VR. The game doesn't let me grab anything from close to the ground. Poking the PC terminal's on/off switch with the finger is also less fun than it sounds. Grabbing or manipulating the environment doesn't feel half as convincing as in games like ""Moss"". 

Then there is this issue that the sky box is wrong (its actually closer than far-away trees or buildings). Not a big thing, and there is a thread with a simple fix for this from a user, but this should be corrected by Croteam together with Steam VR. Leaves or other small objects in the background seem to waver slightly and I found no graphics setting to improve this.

So what do you gain with VR? An only slightly more ""immersive"" feeling with 3D effect, but at the cost of a more difficult game-play, lower-resolution graphics and louder graphics card fans. And you have to wear these glasses for a long time to finish this game. I felt, I had enough after few hours.

Verdict: I recommend playing the non-VR version unless you need something to justify your VR glasses purchase ;-)",1548182656,1579944192,False,5,2,0.510889291763305664,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A truly spectacular piece of gaming craftmanship, and looking at the other reviews I appear to be in a minority, but I do not think this game has transferred to VR well at all. I went into this game expecting to relive the original Talos adventure and was left wanting. 

The original version let you smoothly walk through the world allowing you to slowly take in the world around you and let it sweep you up in it's tranquility. In contrast the lurching leaps of the teleport system totally shatterred this feeling for me making moving through the game world feel frantic and violent. WASD movement in the original game meant you could change direction quickly, you could strafe to look around corners from a safe difference. The games levels are perfectly designed and wonderfully envisioned, but they were never designed for VR movement systems. 

 The beauty of the mechanics of the original game was in it's simplicity, move around, pick things up, put them down. This simplicity is there in VR but means that there isn't much to do within the VR setting. You can play this game one handed if you want, sans the minor difference of a little bit of aiming with the various items.

The beauty in this game was always stunning but I was already stunned by the spaces the devs created to bring about this game, and while seeing the temple in VR was beautiful I had already been stunned, it was better but honestly? I had hoped for more.

The Talos Principle is a fantastic game. If you have never played it before, get it. Get it and with fresh eyes you probably won't see any of the problems I have and you will have a truly fun puzzler with an immensely touching story in your hands. If you have played and loved the original, you may find yourself immersed in the game in full 3D, but feeling less connected to it than ever.

The devs obviously put a lot of time and effort into getting them right so that even a VR newbie like me can cope with the step locomotion. The locomotion configuration has lots of settings you can change independently of each other so you can set things up exactly the way you want them. The one complaint I have, and it is very minor, is that locomotion speed is hidden under game settings instead of VR controls. There don’t seem to be any limits to roomscale support. I have a pretty small area, but I was able to move around inside it freely and even walk off ledges. Walking into a wall is pretty weird though. Talos doesn’t let you clip through walls via roomscale, so it feels kind of like my brain ran into a wall even though the rest of me is still walking. This isn’t a complaint, Talos handles walls well. Other games let you clip into or through walls, and it is terrible. I’m really impressed with how well locomotion was implemented in Talos; I wish all games would give their movement systems as much polish.

I spent most of the day playing it and haven’t cleared all of the first set of puzzles yet, so it seems like there’s a fair amount of content. Some of the earlier puzzles were too easy; however, difficulty ramped up quickly. The primary puzzles in the game have to be solved to collect sigils. In addition to these puzzles, there are also much more difficult optional puzzles. These puzzles are not just hard, but they’re often hidden and the game doesn’t inform you that they even exist until you solve the first. This is a great way to scale the puzzle difficulty so that players new to puzzle games can still enjoy the game and make progress while providing truly mind bending challenges for hardcore enthusiasts.

In addition to the two main puzzle types, there are also a number of messages secreted around the world adding an exploration and discovery layer on top of the puzzles. The challenge puzzles being largely hidden also provides an incentive to look in every nook and cranny.

The terrain looks gorgeous. Trees look like trees and grass looks like grass, even when you get up close. The sky just looks right for the most part and the way Talos handles horizons is fantastic. I don’t want to spoil what happens when you try to walk off into the distance, but it completely fits the game’s tone. You definitely should give it a try when you play it. The sculpture and walls are admittedly lacking in detail, but that just means they support the narrative of being in an artificial world even better than they would if they looked entirely real.

Throughout, the developer’s devotion to producing an excellent game shines through. There are so many fantastic little details. The popup display embedded in your wrist that tracks items you recover as you solve puzzles is genius. As are the signposts that indicate which puzzles have been solved and all the ways the game provides information about what areas have or have not been fully cleared while still encouraging exploring every nook and cranny.

Bottom line: I booted it up intending to play for just 15 minutes and only stopped playing an hour and a half later because I got hungry. This is VR done right.

I played the regular version to the level of 22 achievements, and loved it very much (but accepted my limits.) But the VR version is a whole new ballgame, and I suspect I won't be quitting so easily this time. While the VR navigation takes a bit of getting use to (and I believe a tutorial not so much in movement, but in nuance would be VERY helpful) the ""Talos World"" is simply an amazing place, and one that I hate to ever leave. I'm not sure if my increased success is due to more puzzle game experience in the interim, or the fact that VR is simply more ""there"", but in A level alone I gained at least three sigils that eluded me before (and in fact have them all, and with zero assistance.)

Please, if the money is the issue, $6 (USD) is almost a gift in itself, and I think I can assure anyone wondering that they will never regret the expense. And if you played before, the experience alone is stunning enough to eliminate feelings of repetition.

Admittedly, I'm new to VR, but this is what I always fantasized that VR would be. All I have to do for maximum enjoyment is sit on the couch, and on rare occasions stand up for a little extra height. No effort, and a world I can believe in for an amazing price.

I put the game aside and restarted my quest, to give it another shot, the next day.

I'm not giving a negative review because the game is trash. I'm giving a negative review because it's the honest answer to the question: ""Do you recommend this game?"" I do not. Here is why:

Movement is exactly the opposite of intuition--as is interaction:

Grip button to teleport; trigger to grab.

There is also no option to rebind these to be more logical.

Further, this is the first VR game where teleporting made me motion-sick. Usually the teleport option is to avoid motion sickness, but that doesn't work when there is stuttering in the middle.

And as a final insult, the teleport scheme itself is lousy--though perhaps I was just spoiled for teleporting systems because my first VR game was Robo Recall--but it makes for a good point of comparison to understand what makes The Talos Principle's teleporting so lousy.

In Robo Recall, you use the thumbsticks to set up your teleporting, with additional aiming by pointing. The thumbstick also serves to set what your facing will be at the end of the jump. This makes it simple and intuitive to BAMF! around, changing your facing to be what you want or need it to be at the other end of the jump. Teleporting three feet ahead but facing the opposite direction is effortless and natural.

Here, in The Talos Principle, your facing is locked during teleportation. To change facing, you use the thumbsticks. The default is to rotate in 45 degree increments.

For much of the game, that's fine, if a bit inconvenient. Where it falls apart is when you have to actively avoid a patrol--which happens pretty early on. It means that any action that requires you to outpace a threat more difficult, because your facing will be off--and you will likely find yourself getting turned around in real space because it's so much more instinctive to turn your body to deal with the problem.

That last probably isn't much of a problem if you have a roomscale setup. But if your play area is smaller, or if you're trying to play seated, it can be the difference between making it through a puzzle, and starting over. I only have a half hour of playtime, but in that time, it happened a couple times--I ended up being killed mid-puzzle because the controls were in my way.

This isn't exactly a frantic game. But it manages to be challenging in a similar manner simply because the controls don't work the way one might expect if you come from other VR games.",1545534342,1545632509,False,21,0,0.62078779935836792,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What if... God was real?

But instead of wanting you to be nice to other people, there were no other people and instead He wanted you to mess with Tetris™ pieces in order to live forever?

That is the terrifying premise of The Talos Project. It is the best game of [strike]2014[/strike]2017[strike], or at least this December[/strike].
As shown in the promo images, this game also features two of my favorite things:

• Being a robot
• Petting a cat!!!

I've always wanted to be a robot, so it's pretty neat that I can do that in the game. No cats though! (Update: I found a cat, but I couldn't pet it :((( )

[spoiler]You can pet the cat![/spoiler]

It reminds me a little of the Mac game Marathon because of all the computer terminals. But in that game, you couldn't see if your hand were human hands, so if you were a robot or a cyborg was a mystery. The Talos Principal is better, because you can tell you are a robot right away, it's like the first thing that happens. Also, in the game you can type much faster and more accurately than I can in real life. I guess that's a third awesome feature!

• Typing quickly and accurately

I haven't finished yet, but if you like platform puzzles, reading about the nature of existence (Actual Kant excerpts in game, for real), and thinking about how sad the apocolypse is going to be, this is the game for you.

I give The Tavros Principle 10/10 ""sigils"" (Although it didn't manage to find the eleventh secret sigil)

Dabei kann ich gar nicht sagen woran das genau liegt, aber wenn man eigenlich nur mal in das Spiel rein schauen möchte und dann kurz darauf merkt dass schon über eine Stunde um ist dann ist das meines Erachtens ein Zeichen dafür dass die Entwickler irgendetwas richtig gemacht haben.

パズルゲームですが世界観が素晴らしい。
明らかに地球では無いがどこか地球に似た感じのパラレルワールド？
異世界感が凄く雰囲気が素晴らしい。

このゲームはそんな事が全然無いのが素晴らしい。
私がＶＲ機買って酔いに辟易していた初期に出会ったゲーム。
テレポート移動が選べて、ＶＲ機購入後初めて1時間以上ぶっつづけでプレイしたゲーム。
パズルはじっくり腰を据えて考えられます。（急かされない）
30面位解いたが（18年11月20日現在）5面位は反射神経が必要な面があったかな。
難易度は程よいって言うか頭を使えばどうにかなるパズル。理不尽に解けないってのは無い。
詰まっても考えに考え抜けばきっと解がみつかります。
年配の方にもおすすめしたい。ＶＲ機買ったら何よりも先にこれやっとけって位素晴らしいゲーム。（私はこのゲームに出会うまで遠回りしたので、もっと早くから出会っておけばよかったって思いましたね。）

Unfortunately the port to VR made the game both difficult to play and unenjoyable, mostly due to the movement mechanics. This is the only VR game I have played that has induced nausia for me, and I have played other open world games without issue.

The game is graphically wonderful, and I was really hoping to use this as one of the examples of what VR can deliver when I have friends over to try my VR setup, but with the movement mechanics as they are at the moment, I would not do so.

Due to the poor porting I would not recommend the game in its current state.

It's a port, though, not built for VR, and it shows. It breaks some rules: get too close to a wall and it'll push you back, which can be very unsettling. Step down a ledge or up onto a step and it pushes you up or down, which might be even worse. The purple semi-transparent level barriers that are fine to walk through in 2D are disturbing and difficult to walk through in room-scale.

It has a good sense of scale, which is fine until you grab a jammer that's big enough to intersect with your actual body unless you hold it at arm's length, which is awkward and creepy. If you want to primarily walk by flipping your space around to line up with where you want to go - which can be really immersive - instead of blinking everywhere or using smooth locomotion, the locomotion options aren't super well-suited for that. It allows changing the distance covered by a snap turn, but you can't both cross a field (180 degree turns) and turn corners (90 degree turns) with a low number of turn presses without going back into the menu.

It's definitely still pretty, has a good sense of wide-open space. I was able to get down on the ground and stare at where the grass didn't meet up with the (beautiful and bumpy) brick wall, which was interesting.",1534660416,1534660416,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Areas for improvement:
1. Perhaps give the option to run or sprint - I find walking too slow
2. This game sometimes makes me feel nauseous after a long session - and I don't feel this way in too many other games. It's not bad though, fairly minor and only happens after an hour or two playing.

Positives:
1. Graphics are great
2. There are tons of puzzles, and they vary in difficulty. There are many different elements introduced to the puzzles over time

One of the best VR experiences currently available. Even if you're not a fan of puzzle games, you will enjoy the immersion into this VR philosophical world questioning existence. There's a tactile feel to puzzles when you use motion controllers and can look around and be in the puzzle, not just see it on a screen.

This is a complete game. Your mileage will vary, but expect anywhere from 10-20 hours in this game. Puzzles start simple and slowly but surely get more complicated the further you go. You learn as you go on, like a child. The voice of God is well done and brings atmosphere to the puzzles. There's also a story to piece together by going to the terminals and input is done well by just touching the highlighted areas.

I already owned Talos Principle non-VR version and I'm so happy they brought this to VR. It just feels like a natural fit. I would say it's still worth purchasing even if you played this before. However, I do recommend changing the default controls. Enable full locomotion, smooth turning, and turn off comfort mode for the best VR experience.

VR，关卡式解谜，探索

[h1]游戏方式[/h1]
使用诸如干扰器、棱镜、激光、方块等等工具来解开迷宫拿到拼图。

[h1]内容[/h1]
是非VR版游戏的完整复刻，自带地狱之路DLC。
关卡非常多，没有注意统计，但肯定上百了，再加上隐藏的星星关卡，还有一些文件收集，作为参考，我的非VR版游戏时间是47h。制作者也明白塔洛斯存在关卡过多的问题，所以没有把关卡做成线性的，一般在一定阶段的时候，可以自由选择先进行哪个关卡后进行哪个关卡。
根据关卡的完成情况和玩家的选择，游戏本体一共有3种结局。

[h1]特色[/h1]
塔洛斯自带两个版本的中文音频（普通话+广东话），画面精美，还含有一些关于哲理问题的探讨（主要集中在文字上，我不喜欢这种闷头看文的形式）。
游戏内提供了四种移动方式，传送、步进、滑动（传统显示屏3D游戏的经典移动方法）、目的地跑动。非VR版的塔洛斯是当时我唯一晕过的3D游戏，在VR中为了避免这个问题制作者还是费了一番心思的。
1.传送：点哪儿立即就传送至该地；
2.步进：每次以传送的方式移动一步的距离；
3.滑动：不知道有些游戏是为了适配尽量多的VR设备还是单纯制作者想当然，将VR中的前进方向和视角方向做成一致的，操作起来极其难受，不便于移动时观察环境。塔洛斯则是将移动方向与手指着的方向保持一致，头可以灵活观察四周。可能考虑到显卡加载速度的原因，采用滑动形式移动时，只有中间视野是实时更新的，其余视野被模糊掉了。
4.目的地跑动：指定一个移动地点后，玩家会看到自己跑过去的过程。

[h1]感想[/h1]
塔洛斯的本体我是一直不怎么感冒的，虽然它制作精良，但是本体难度偏简单、关卡过多，隐藏要素又很不友好。地狱之路DLC是这部游戏真正的精华所在，极为具有挑战性的关卡，将道具的本质解析得淋漓尽致，尤其是终极星星关卡。
不过这次玩了VR版后看法有很大改观，从前嫌弃觉得是食之无味的鸡肋的精致画面（太花了太绕了以致经常因为找东西而卡关，特别是星星关卡），现在在VR版中是真正让人感受到舒适和可以欣赏的东西了，配上中文版埃洛希姆娓娓道来的磁性嗓音，玩起来是一种享受，有点像回到小时候在草地上探险的感觉。

[b]总之，如果玩家觉得关卡重复比较多玩起来太单调，可以直接转入地狱之路DLC，这个DLC是我作为一名解谜爱好者最推崇的四个解谜游戏之一（另外三个分别是环绕走廊、传送门故事：梅尔、史蒂芬的香肠卷），相信它的精彩不会让玩家失望的！[/b]",1524406344,1524406344,True,33,2,0.80032271146774292,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Играть заметно интереснее, чем просто на пк, + как-то проще. Или потому, что помнишь часть загадок, или потому что высматривать решение становится удобнее. 3D на уровне, атмосфера тоже.

・VRでない版のTalosではDLCだった「Road to Gehenna（ゲヘナの道）」は、VR版では同梱されている。
・ステージは美しい。これだよ！　この[b]ゾンビとか虫とか怪物とか出てこないキレイな風景をVRで見たかった[/b]んだよ！
・パズルはやや難しく、歯ごたえがある。星まで集めるとなお難しい。100ステージほどあるが、1つとして前のステージと同じパターンで解決できるステージが存在しないパズル設計がすごい。どのステージでも今まで培った解法＋αが求められ、解けた時が気持ち良い。
・デフォルト設定だと移動はVRゲームでよくあるテレポート式だが、オプションから[VR CONTROLS]の[MOVEMENT MODE PRESET]で[CLASSIC]を選ぶと、VRコントローラのジョイスティックで[b]自由に走り回れる[/b]ようになりおススメ。ただしVR酔いも加速する（慣れないこともない）。なお走行時は視界が狭まる。描画速度の問題もあるんだろが、VR酔いを軽減する効果もあるんだろうな、たぶん。
・Oculus Touchでプレイしているが、ジャンプ用の[b]中指トリガーを両手で同時押しすると早送り[/b]になる。通常移動やエレベータの移動、Recorderでの時間稼ぎなどを早回しにできる。
・VRコントローラを持ち上げて左手の甲を見ると、甲の中央にステージをリセットするボタンと、それから各ドアやアイテムを解放するための印章収集の進捗が出てくる。
・高所から落ちてもダメージを受けたりはしないが、VRのリアルな風景を高速で落下するのはかなり怖い。何度やっても足元がすくむ。是非あなたも高いところからダイブしていただきたい。ゲームが進むとものすごく高い建物が出てくるので、そこから一気にイっていただきたい。
・あとマイン（球状の自爆ロボ）に予期しないタイミングで突撃を食らうと迫力ありすぎてビクッとする。
・それにしても２番目に難しいエンディングの、ムービーの凄まじさよ。なんかスゴいもの見たみたいな感想しか出てこない。今のところVRで見た物の中で一番素晴らしかった。

Not  Croateam.  Talos Principle VR is the result of what happens when devs actually care about creating the best experience and clearly understand what makes VR great.

If you like 1st person puzzle games like Portal, chances are you will enjoy this as well.  The story has an introspective and enigmatic tone which helps drive progression.  VR mechanics are implemented thoughtfuly- only where they make sense, serving to enhance the game and improve immersion without getting in the way of the core game.  The amount of control you are given over the settings options should be standard practice for ALL VR games. It is so refreshing and nice to be given the freedom to tailor everything from locomotion and color saturation to resolution and other performance tweaks.  Lastly, the amount of content you get- it took me 33 hours for both endings- and I didn’t even get all the bonus stars -not to mention finish ‘The Road to Gehenna’ is especially generous for a VR game.

[i]The Talos Principle[/i] is perhaps the most widely revered puzzle game since [i]Portal 2[/i], but for the life of me I can't understand why. The mechanics you can make use of are so basic it's annoying: immobilizer towers just stop anything and are the only thing you can use for the first 10+ puzzles, and the other unlocked mechanics still involve just placing immmovables on the ground and don't have any sort of objects that can move outside your grip (and you can only hold one at a time for some reason even though it only takes one hand to hold anything but the cube/hexahedron). 

Many of the puzzles in the [b]green[/b] and [b]yellow[/b] difficulties require little-to-no brain effort to solve. Simply walk through the puzzle once and the solution is blatantly obvious. The [b]red[/b] difficulty puzzles are the only ones that require any real thought process to figure out. And the secret stars, which are supposed to be even harder accolades than beating [b]red[/b] puzzles, are pretty much all found as part of going through the motions of examining all your options.

As for the story, I can see that they've made an effort, but since I was spending so much time speedrunning to find a redeemably difficuly puzzle in this game before my return window closed, I wasn't able to focus on it enough to get any kind of opinion or even follow the plot. All I know is that I'm a robot in this game and that human civilization seems to have kicked the can long ago.

All of the above problems could also be considered part of the desktop version of [i]The Talos Principle[/i], but I must also complain about the VR implementation some. There is no inventory indicator for anything other than the tiles you've obtained. If you're holding something like keys, there is no inventory indicator that you have them in your posession. And why in the world are there two different movement buttons that do exactly the same thing? The touchpad and the grip buttons are both associated with movement and both are broken in some way. The touchpad-movement has about a 30% chance of working on any given click, and the grip-movement is forever barred from taking you through barriers that have been disabled. How much time in QA would it have taken to identify these issues? It only took me 10 minutes to notice them!

For the difficulty of the puzzles and the basicness of the mechanics in this game, I might recommed the desktop version for ~$10-$15. But the VR version has its own issues that make it annoying and difficult to play and very difficult for me to recommend at all. This really shouldn't have been a separate purchase from the desktop version. Maybe then I wouldn't be asking for a refund.",1514564017,1514564396,False,1,0,0.339764028787612915,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Forty dollars is, in my opinion, too much to ask for a three year old video game with VR support. Hardware is expensive, damnit. Not all of us can afford to drop full price on these ports. I can't even play Fallout 4 or L.A. Noire, since I have a 970 and can't afford the 400$ for a 1070.

But if you're the type of person who somehow thought sixty dollars for Fallout 4 was okay, you'll probably see this as a steal, considering the actual VR implementation is miles better. You can actually pull switches to activate them, instead of pointing and clicking. This should obviously be standard, but since FO4 VR is charting at #1 for doing less, I suppose this game is luxurious in comparison. 

Lots of great VR options. Lots of great options in general - Croteam is always good about this sort of thing. I got this game for twenty dollars, and at that price Talos VR is completely worth it if you've never played the game before, like me.

Ya deberían aprender otras grandes desarrolladoras cómo se debe hacer un juego, tan sólo por la calidad técnica ya merece tu dinero, enumero las virtudes que le veo habiéndolo probado un rato:

- LOCOMOCIÓN: Te permite configurar absolutamente TODO para que te muevas a tu gusto, en esto de la RV cada uno es un mundo y es algo que se debería hacer en todos los juegos. Puedes moverte con el típico teletransporte o movimiento clásico, pudiendo cerrar el campo de visión o no para evitar mareos; lo mismo a la hora de manejar la vista, continuo o a ángulos, pudiendo cambiar los grados del giro (15º,30º,45º,etc.)

- GRÁFICOS: Aparte de la buena calidad gráfica, decir que tiene unas opciones gráficas que no tienen nada que envidiar a cualquier juego triple A, te permite incluso cambiar la API entre DirectX 11, 12, OpenGL y Vulkan. También te permite configurar la resolución tanto en las oculus como en el reflejo del monitor de forma independiente. Esto es algo que debería ser lo habitual pero en el mundo de la realidad virtual estamos cansados de ver juegos que tienen para configurar cuatro cosas o ninguna en absoluto, por eso debo resaltarlo.

- LOCALIZACIÓN: ¡Totalmente traducido y DOBLADO al castellano! Y además un doblaje de buena calidad.

- ADEMÁS a los que tenemos Oculus nos permite ejecutar el juego directamente en la app de Oculus sin tener que tener abierto el SteamVR, lo cual se agradece muchísimo y es algo que no he visto en ningún otro videojuego.

Yo suelo esperar a que baje mucho el precio de los juegos, pero con éste he hecho una excepción y lo he comprado rebajado a 18,50 euros. Creo que los usuarios de Oculus y Vive debemos apoyar los pocos productos de calidad que nos llegan para que se generalice esta forma de hacer bien las cosas, máxime cuando viene doblado al castellano y en RV no vienen traducidos ni la mitad, y de los doblajes ni hablemos.

Haven't logged into Steam in a few months and found a few comments letting me know most things have been fixed and to edit my review so it's not outdated or potentially misleading. Changed it to 'recommended' but keep in mind, I have not played the game since 2017 when there were tons of issues. I have no idea if they're fixed and I likely won't buy the game at full price to find out/verify the comments' claims. I just don't want a 2-year old review that's hardly relevant anymore bringing the game's sales down when it's likely been greatly improved since.

If I do purchase the game and verify, I'll make sure to update my review to something that's actually helpful/relevant. 

=======================================================================
REVIEW AS OF 2017:
Can't recommend this for Oculus, unfortunately. I've played and beaten the original version to full completion as well as Sigils of Elohim and all available DLC for the base game. As such, I come from a place of understanding with this game and have something to refer to as a ""proper"" experience.

I own an Oculus Rift with Touch and a 3-sensor setup. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game for Oculus, at the very least. Movement is finicky at best, which left me jerking around through walls and barriers to the point where I saw my character model teleport a few feet ahead of me. Anytime I would lay down a jammer to turn off a blue barrier, I would try to move through it and would get caught in the middle of it, unable to move. I've found the only way to get through these barriers is to spam the teleport button in order to move through it. This happened so often, I can't defend it by saying it might have been a hiccup. 

On top of this, the Oculus Touch controllers were absolutely not considered when porting this out for VR; this game was absolutely developed with Vive in mind, and does not accomodate Touch well. I say this due to the strange button mappings. Using the grip buttons does not allow the player to pick up objects, the trigger do that. Instead, the grips teleport the player, and the joysticks only turn the player. Many games developed for Oculus map the joysticks to teleport when pressed forward  and allow the direction to be changed when spinning them.

This last one is just a minor complaint, but it definitely shows how little was considered when porting this out: the character models makes stepping sound effects when the player moves their head. I understand that this is likely just a ""The player's facing direction moved, therefore his body turns, therefore he steps, therefore use the step sound effect"", but this definitely shows a lack of polish for a $40MSRP game. 

Overall, this does not feel even close to premium, and you will likely be fighting the game's programming throughout your playthrough. There is a ton of content and the game itself is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played, but I cannot recommend this port in its current state.",1514361257,1571084858,True,1,0,0.47413790225982666,11,True,False,False,False,,,

Since it's been so long since I've played it, the puzzles feel fresh again, and figuring things out from my own perspective makes solving them feel even more satisfying due to the physical nature of moving the set pieces around.  

Movement is handled very well in Talos Principle VR!  I personally prefer the teleport system, but that's augmented with the ability to click the touchpads and rotate and/or take small steps forwards, backwards, and strafing.  The results in movement that doesn't result in me getting sick but still lets me fine-tune my position without twisting every which way to get the perspective ""just right"" to solve a puzzle.

So, I grabbed this during the recent sale having loved the original, but not having played the DLC. It helped to sell me that I was at least getting some value added just past the VR conversion. I started playing the game and quickly came to the realization that while it was a very excellently done port, I didn't find VR added much to the experience. If you really liked the world and environment and want to explore it more intimately, then absolutely go for it. But as far as it being a game for VR, in my opinion it just felt like a game better played outside VR.

It felt fine enough to play in VR, so there is no problem with it feeling clunky or poorly done. It did feel a little less...smooth to play in VR? It's hard to put my finger on it. It did remind me how much I liked the original until I got stuck near the end on a time-warp puzzle, and I think I'll go back and play that. Heck, I will probably buy the DLC as well. But I think I'll end up refunding this and buying some other games I don't already have.

There is plenty to like here and I think, for the right person, even double-dipping isn't out of the question. But if you already played the game outside VR, then give it a little bit more thought before you take the plunge.",1513385597,1513385679,True,1,0,0.492843061685562134,0,True,False,False,False,,,

They did a really great job of giving options to the player.  Controls include teleport, step movement, free movement (classic) or various combinations of all of them.  The only thing missing as far as I can tell is free movement on one hand with teleport on the other which would be my personal preference.

The game ran very well in Direct3d11 (Direct3d12 performance was awful but that's in beta) and I was able to run at 150% resolution without reprojection although my system is powerful (1080ti) so YMMV.

I also find that the pace of the game really lends itself to VR since solving puzzles in 3D space feels natural in VR.  It also has the plus of being a different game from a lot of the others out there (no shooting!) and since it's a full game it has a lot of hours of real quality Vr gameplay.

I'm currently finishing the ""star puzzles"", as I've heard there is a second ending if you do so...trying to avoid seeing spoilers.

My perspective is from someone who bought the original to try the DK2 beta branch in 2015, then decided to wait for a proper release version for VR, which took two years! This means I had experienced practically nothing of the game on a screen before jumping into VR, and to me personally I am happy I waited as I only play puzzle games once as the challenge is removed for me after that.

[b]What hooked me[/b]:
[list]
[*]The ever increasing variation of puzzles, mechanics, items and environments.
[*]The subtle but intense story delivered through various means, I so love mystery. Very suitable for a VR game too.
[*]Solving puzzles in VR is a favorite, because the deep reasoning it has me do makes me forget about reality and quite transports me. It's slightly reduced in this game due to the levels being larger than room-scale, but it was still quite meditative at times.
[*]Plenty of options for locomotion, no pigeonholing.
[/list]
[b]Pro-tips[/b]:
[list]
[*]If you use joystick locomotion, you can change your speed under Game Options, it's not under VR Options.
[*]When you see the highlight of two feet on a surface, it means you can automatically jump there with a button press, this means you don't have to do platforming if you don't want to. Pretty convenient.
[*]They made terminal scrolling go whole pages instead of single lines, at first I thought it was just hyper speed scrolling which made me careful to use it, but it's really a single page-down action so it's fine.
[*]If you hold both grip buttons you fast forward time, which can be useful. I figured this out after I had finished the game already...
[/list]
[b]Gotchas[/b]:
[list]
[*] As in the original you moved things around with a mouse cursor/cross hair you are limited to carrying one thing at a time in the VR version, anything else would break many puzzles. This of course felt strange early on as you do get two hands in the game. After a while I just used my secondary hand for navigation though, and moved things around mainly with my primary.
[*] Story and interactions are mainly told by interacting with text interfaces. At first I thought I would get tried of reading text in VR quickly, but then they fed me tidbits of the story and I compulsively read any terminal message I could find. Pretty deep stuff.
[*] I pulled down quality after a while to get better performance, the visual fidelity was not that different so it felt like a good compromise. Many areas work just fine but there are places where it does slow down, I'm on a 1070 and an i5 though, so mid-tier I guess?

For one puzzle, I did have to switch controls to smooth motion to solve.  Otherwise, the rest of the game seems solvable with teleport while teleport gives you no real advantage over smooth that I noticed.

This game gets me hooked for at least an hour or two each time I turn it on. So far none of the puzzles have been all that difficult but I am just now unlocking more tools and the puzzles are starting to increase in complexity. 
Items I enjoyed: 
- The atmosphere is great. The game is very scenic and they allow you to venture out a little in the world even though there isn't much to do aside from a few hidden pieces of the story or notes here and there. 
- Sound: The sound of the ocean,waves and birds adds to the atomsphere. When god speaks down to you it the surround sound is tremendous and makes it feal like the devine maker is really addressing you.
- Story: So far so good it is really deap and and probably not for everyone.
- Puzzles: while I haven't hit any challenging ones yet, I like all the different dynamics that come into play. I can see how the difficulty might progress with all the different ""enemy types"", road blocks as well as all the different tools. I do like that it appears to open up some and there are going to be many puzzles where there are multiple ways to solve.
- Options: I like a all the options and settings that are available. I prefer trackpad movement but ended up teleporting in this game. Since there is so much ground to cover I prefer to teleport to get across faster. The ability to rotate your postion with the trackpad is nice too. I only seem to get motion sickness when I use trackpad and have to physically turn alot. This game will not cause sickness issues with me.
Things I didn't like: I can't say there is anything I really dislike but a few things I didn't care for. 
- Reading a lot of text: I know this is how the story was originally told in the pancake version but for VR reading a lot of notes on a monitor to get the story is not welcome. I am not sure what the solution is maybe offering a text to speach option. 
- Need more reasons to roam: As I mentioned the atmosphere is great and some of the areas are really relaxing. They give the the ability to explore the beaches a little and the cliffs but there is nothing to do there. Maybe add a few more story element notes, collectibles or add a few VR mechanics like skipping or throwing rocks, fishing, flying a kite I don't know something to do out there the land is vast and void. 

Overall loving the game I have a lot more to go, support these devs they have given a lot of content to the community when a lot of other studios are waiting. I know a lot of people have already bought this game years ago but it is so clever I am sure if you liked it then you will enjoy it again. If you are just searching for VR content this game doesn't add any mind blowing VR mechanics but it is extremely deep and fun will keep you busy for weeks (until December when a few more great games get released).

* Do yourself a favor and try to avoid googling for answers or using guides. You'll get there eventually and the experience is so much more satisfying.

This has been my most interesting VR experience so far - and I'm not even finished yet. I was wanting to play the game for a long time but didn't get to it so I jumped right into the VR mode (which is on point by the way - there are tons of customization options to make you feel comfortable in VR - exactly like the Serious Sam VR versions - nice work Croteam!)

I tend to take my time in games, read all the lore and look around for a while, so the slow pace seems perfect for me. The overall aesthetics are also very nice in my opinion. I even caught myself cranking up the visuals in between just to get the most out of it when I'm not moving around too much or solving puzzles (which can be quite challenging - it's a good thing!).

As for performance: Runs relatively smooth (just a few hiccups here and there) on a 1070 with 200% rendering size and GPU on high with an i7-6800K.

If you like portal, only a little bit slower; if you daydream about the human mind and consciousness; if you like greek mythology and ancient architecture - go for it!

Grade A

Although The Talos Principle was a 2014 title – I have never played the non-VR title. The Talos Principle is a puzzle game in which you are a robot given the task of solving various puzzles from a “hub” to smaller “trials” with clever names. The names of the puzzles usually are a hint to the task ahead of what you face.

Unlike some other puzzle games I’ve played – Talos Principle is very fair. It shows you the pieces of the puzzle such as tools to connect beams or beams that suppress force field doors. There is no easter egg hunt to find random components or parts. Your goal is to use these tools to reach an end sigil of each trial. As you play the game, you unlock more tools and more worlds to explore.

There is a deep story written within the Talos Principle utilizing voice-over memories and computers you can interact with. To be fair, I haven’t engrossed myself into this aspect of the game but I can tell there was effort put into creating more than just the puzzle game itself.

I am not usually a puzzle genre player but The Talos Principle VR feels great to play. The visuals are polished and movement is natural with teleport(and they have other locomotion options enabled!). When you figure out a puzzle and have that eureka moment – it’s a great feeling to hear that “claimed sigil” sound.

The game currently retails at $39.99 on steamVR which might be high but it is a true polished, finished game that won countless awards for it’s NON-VR version and I can see why.",1509565217,1509565217,True,1,0,0.456060975790023804,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay itself is just the same as the base non-VR version: they didn't cut out various bits of the game to make it more VR-compatible. It still looks, and feels, like The Talos Principle.

Visual wise, its pretty bland. The same low res wall over and over. The puzzles did not grab me at all, just super boring and uninspired. Maybe things get better later on but it just wasn't interesting enough to make me want to play more and explore the world.

Esta review va a ser corta. 
Realmente no voy a analizar el juego porque creo que todos lo conocemos de sobra. Para mi está clarisimo que es uno de los mejores First Person Puzzlers que hay en el mercado.

Puntos importantes en la version VR: 
-El juego está adaptado a la perfeccion para VR. La inmersion es brutal y los graficos lucen muy bien. (Probado con oculus CV1 + Touch). Es una gozada el simple hecho de pasear por los escenarios y admirar todos y cada uno de los detalles que en la version ""no VR"" pueden haber pasado desapercibidos.

-Tengo muchos juegos VR y creo que es el juego que mas opciones de locomoción tiene de todos cuantos he jugado. Además dentro de algunas opciones hay variaciones, como por ejemplo locomocion libre girando con stick o girando hacia donde miramos o girando hacia donde apunta la mano. Todo un ejemplo que deberian seguir TODOS y cada uno de los desarrolladores de juegos VR ya que cada persona es un mundo y cada jugador se siente comodo con ""su"" metodo de locomoción favorito.

-El juego es compatible desde el principio y además incorpora un asistente para realizar videos de Mixed Reality. Todavia no he podido probarlo, pero creo que es un punto muy a tener en cuenta y que nos hace ver lo muy en serio que se ha tomado esta gente la integracion absoluta de la VR en su juego.

-Este ultimo punto está mas enfocado a la gente que hace gameplays o streaming, pero por si acaso lo pongo. El mirror del juego es bastante correcto y capturando la ventana normal se ve bastante bien.

En resumen. Yo recomiendo el juego 100% para fanaticos de los first person puzzlers que tengan acceso a un HMD y creo que lo disfrutareis sin ninguna duda. No parece una adaptacion, sino mas bien un juego creado expresamente para VR.

Of course I read plenty of the Steam reviews beforehand so I seem to be in the minority in thinking that it was a tedious VR experience.

To me, satisfying hand-tracked VR comes from small-scale actions, even when in the context of large-scale scenarios. Lone Echo has some great examples of this, such as having to turn on and use a handheld laser cutter to free somebody's leg before a spaceship explodes. It's a simple task at its core but it lets you engage in a direct and compelling way. In my hour with The Talos Principle the majority of the action was moving large items around the environment and coming up against the locomotion issues that plague VR.

Lone Echo's motion works because it is tied to your hands and feels almost natural, and is offset by lots of small-scale tactile, hands on activity. Even using your VR tablet to select dialogue responses feels good. The computer terminal in The Talos Principle VR felt similarly satisfying to use.

Robo Recall's teleporting works because it simply gets out of the way of the action, wherein you stand still and shoot/punch/grab/throw stuff. It's simple and almost mindless but it's immediate and satisfying.

Superhot VR has an extremely limited approach to motion: you are teleported to predetermined points and have no choice where they are. You are plopped down in a location for a cool set-piece and then, like Robo Recall, left to stand and murder stuff with fun mechanics.

In my time with The Talos Princple VR there was a shortage of such intimate satisfying ""handplay"", except for that moment pushing buttons on a computer terminal or solving a tetronimo puzzle. Teleportation is a workaround and doesn't seem appropriate for a game about world-traversal like The Talos Principle, and being somebody who feels sick with full locomotion (mainly rotation) I had to rely on the peripheral-vision-reduction and/or 45-degree snapping, both of which reduce sickness but make it a chore to look around because they are restrictive. All the while playing, I was thinking about how much more effortless it would have been with a keyboard and mouse.

Basically, the game feels like too much time spend engaging with VR weaknesses without enough of VR's strengths. I should clarify that I thought the world was gorgeous; indeed I spent a good while in the opening area just ogling the scenery, and then a while later on a beach, but actually playing the game felt laboured.

Overall....Dont NOT buy this game. Even if you arent big into puzzles this game one will have you questions reality and our existence or what it means to be a human.

My Initial Thoughts:
From the creators of the Serious Sam series of games comes an amazing portal-esque puzzle game. The normal 2D version of this game has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam and is 1 of my top Steam Curator Recommendations. It's now in VR and is a dream come true. DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS GEM! - AWESOME STUFF!

Zur Story selbst schreibe ich mal nichts, ist schon in der Spielebeschreibung ausführlich erklärt. 
Als erstes fällt die schöne Grafik ins Auge. Trotz GTX 970 läuft das Spiel flüssig und einwandfrei. Und sieht dabei richtig gut aus. 
Auch die Steuerungsoptionen sind gut durchdacht, sowohl Teleportation als auch ""normales"" Laufen (mit Geschwindigkeitsregelung) sind möglich. Allerdings läuft man bei der Standarteinstellung sehr schnell, was leichte Motion Sickness auslösen kann.
Ein weiteres großes Plus ist, dass das Spiel komplett in deutsch ist (Text und Vertonung, und die ist gut umgesetzt). Bei den vielen englischsprachigen Titeln mal eine nette Abwechslung.
Die Rätsel steigen im Schwierigkeitsgrad ständig an und sind abwechslungsreich. Wer das Spiel schon am Monitor gespielt hat, kennt leider schon alles, da es nur eine Neuauflage ist. Trotzdem ist es einen Blick wert, weil es einfach ein anderes Spielgefühl ist, mitten in dieser wunderschönen Welt Rätsel zu lösen.
Mit einer Spielzeit um die 15-20 Stunden gehört Talos zu den längeren VR-Titeln, womit auch der etwas höhere Preis gerechtfertigt ist.
Für jemanden, der nicht am Monitor gespielt hat, eine klare Kaufempfehlung. Wer es schon kennt, weiss worauf er sich einläßt und wird es vermutlich auch kaufen (25% Rabatt für Vorbesitzer)
Ich werde auf jeden Fall der göttlichen Stimme folgen und noch einige Stunden in der Welt von Talos Principle verbringen.

Playing The Talos Principle in VR is like hacking your own consciousness. Yes, you have a brain. And you also have two hands that let you interact with this strange anachronic world of ancient ruins and technology. And you will learn it has great plans for you.

You'll go for an introspective journey that'll help you unfold your Metaphysical intelligence. The puzzles are incredibly clever and often requires you to think out of the box you were comfortable within.

You could also find yourself have a stop just to contemplate the shadows of the upper clouds sliding on those beautiful sceneries or be impressed by the gigantic size of this tower... Magical moments of VR.

The lifetime of the game is pretty larger than what we were used to up to now in VR and the VR version also includes Road to Gahenna DLC wich is awesome too.

Plus Croteam refused to fall into the wall garden strategy trap that FB/Oculus was offering them. So it's still available here for every VR player today. We, as users, could reward this attitude if we care about standing for freedom of choice in this merciless world.

This review concerns the VR update to the original game, not the original game which I consider a superb puzzler.
They did a superb job. A great port should make the original medium irrelevant and it's impossible to tell that it was not a VR title to begin with.

The options are amazing. I'm playing classic movement with the comfort at the largest circle possible so I can nearly see everything while moving yet very comfortable and I removed clicking to move which is MUCH easier physically for long periods and better for the controller. I also made turning do a 45 degree angle which is great for seated. I recently was contacted by Croteam on reddit and told that a seated mode is even in the making which is very exciting! Seated mode works well enough but there are a few parts where you need to stand up to reach something.

The graphics are really good and I experience very little stutter and minimal when it happens on default settings which were quite high for a 7700k cpu and 1080 gpu. Pretty flawless experience. Caught myself just staring at various visual effects like the drones bumping into force fields or the lasers - it's pretty amazing.
As a return player I was a bit concerned that a second playthrough wouldn't be that great but I found that the experience is so elevating in VR that it's worth it. One of the best VR games.
Thanks for including the DLC and giving original owners a discount Croteam. I'm going back in!!!

Wow just wow how this game can suck you in. But what did you think would happen if you take an amazing 2D Game and make a VR port with much love out of it?
Yes an outstanding game.  And it does not feel like a port. It feels like it was made for VR. 
For everyone on the edge it seems prizy but it offers way more in return.

J'ai attendu, attendu et attendu. Et il est sorti ! Enfin !

A 3 heures de jeu, je trouve les enigmes plutot faciles mais passionantes. 
A 4, ca devient costaud.

Les graphismes ne sont pas extraordinaires mais bon ce n'est pas le plus important et ils ne sont pas trop degueus pour autant. Un peu pixelisé mais bon on va pas faire la fine bouche pour un adaption d'un jeu AAA.

Tous les modes de locomotions sont dispo et customizables. Perso je le joue en slide, head direction, vitesse max ,clic sur trackpad et c'est parfait.

Ambiance sonore au top et tout le jeu en Francais ,voix et textes.

Et le DLC fourni avec.

Now for the VR aspects...

I played the flat version (several times) and earned every achievement possible. I was hyped for the VR version, and I was NOT disappointed.

Even remembering the gist of the beginning levels, the gameplay did not feel stale at all. In fact, completing the puzzles by hand and in person added a whole new freshness that makes me rather excited to go through the game again and seeing things from a whole new perspective.

Even if you are coming in without having played the original, this is a game that should be in your library. IMO, this is one of the most polished VR experiences to date and a very solid example of how VR games can and should be. It is incredibly immersive and the controls very intuitive.

Highly recommended.

For anyone who hasn't played this game before, I would compare it (as many have) to Portal. Similar to Portal, this will challenge you mentally, without ever being too difficult.  The progression of difficultly is linear and within reason, allowing the player to adequately adapt to tackle most challenges.  Additionally, it does not require that you solve all the puzzles in a given sequence, allowing you to throw in the towel on a puzzle for a while, and come back to it later with a fresh set of eyes. The gameplay is fantastic.  Additionally, the game is absolutely beautiful.  There seems to be zero sacrifice in graphic quality.  The environments and general atmosphere is stunning (and even better when you are standing inside of it). Among the best graphics seen on the Vive so far.  Unlike Portal, the story in Talos does take on a more serious tone.  It is extremely thought provoking and pulls together themes of technology, metaphysics, existentialism, and religion.  

Croteam has truly outdone themselves. This port is amazing. There was clearly a lot of attention to detail when porting the controls and overall experience. Small things (like being able to aim a jamming device as you drop it, or the upgraded VR controls which allow you to freely arrange sigils to unlock doors) makes the VR controls feel even more natural than playing the original game on the flat screen.

I'm using classic locomotion, medium speed, no comfort, touch to move, and head oriented movement. If you use hand oriented movement, you have to keep your controller level, and I want to play it with my hand/controller hanging comfortably.  

It's identical to the flat PC game, which is good. The environments remind me of Serious Sam (for obvious reasons), and I can't help but like the chain gun sound when you grab a laser tripod thing.

First off, I never played the pancake version (as the developer jokingly put it) of the game but my first hour was incredible fun. The game is super beautiful (maybe the best looking VR game I played yet, even compared to Robo Recall or Lone Echo), the atmosphere is fantastic (and VR adds a lot to the titles immersion) and the first few puzzles were fun and engaging.

What blew me away though was the option menu of all things, because it is one that is truly worthy of a PC AAA title instead of a PC VR AAA title. Nothing comes close to how polished it feels (except the scroll bars); no Steam VR indie title and no Oculus Studio release. There is an auto detect functionality for the performance stuff, individual presets for GPU performance, VRAM and CPU performance as well as a few dozen options in each category with everything from Ambient Occlusion, the number of internal sound channels, multiple shadow implementations, the ability to switch sound API and so forth. And of course the game supports MSAA (up to 8) as well as allows to set render scale in game. Take that blurry as fuck Obduction as well as all those titles that make me use third party tools (Oculus Tray Tool or Open VR Advance Settings) to set render scale.

All of those take effect immediately and if the renderer needs to restart it does so on its own within a few seconds and w/o you loosing your progress. And this is even true for the ingame (!) option to switch between Steam VR and Oculus SDK (performance seems on par as expected btw...). Take that Bridge Crew and Arizona Sunshine!

When it comes to locomotion, the game supports everything from full locomotion, teleport and blink. Not only that of course, you have a few additional comfort and immersive options. Want full locomotion but something more comfortable? Turn on a reducing FOV while moving (of course you can adjust its level to your liking). Don't have a Rift 360 setup or not enough space to turn around? How about snap turning. Want smooth rotation, they got you covered. And of course, full locomotion is per default controller bound like Onward (take that Mage's Tale), but you can also choose to have it bound to your head direction or play space based (no idea, haven't tried it).

What adds a lot to the graphic is the existence of not only multiple post process color profiles (I use vivid) but also contrast, brightness, saturation and gamma sliders! Oh god, I can't even start to express how much I missed a higher contrast picture in VR, especially (but certainly not limited) for games that I played already on my monitor before (like iRacing). Why the fuck have both Oculus and Valve decided for us that something like that is not needed in VR? Any theoretical possibility to fine tune a games visuals exactly thanks to knowing what VR headset an users has (and the lack of ambient light) never came to fruition and with most games these days being multi platform and a lot more Steam VR headsets coming out in the near future (actually Windows MR released today IIRC) its doubtful that this will ever happen. None of that accounts for player preference anyway. I prefer more saturation and a bit crushed shadows a lot no matter how much the developer fine tunes the composition for a Rift headset (not even mentioning differences in OLED panels).

What is the point of this post? Not completely sure. Probably just to make people aware that Talos Principle is really polished and a cry towards Oculus, Valve and individual game developers to remember that PC players actually value options and customization.",1508271454,1508271454,True,195,3,0.904920995235443115,5,True,False,False,False,,,

I will say if you're going in blind, TP a Portal-esque maze puzzler. You go around giant worlds solving puzzles as a sentient lab rat, but Talos Principle has a much more philosophical bent. You're the subject of a kind of Turing Test, and are never quite sure if what you see and hear is true, or if it's part of the test. Especially interesting are the interactions with Milton on the library terminals, who may be a simple library program, a complicated AI, or a researcher messing with your mind. The more I played, the more I realized I was solving puzzles just to get access to more terminals to continue the conversation. I found it to be an extremely well written, emotionally evolving story with a beautifully designed, fun to play puzzle game thrown in as a bonus.

The puzzles are fun without being punishing, and though you can die from sentry turrets and roaming mines, there are very few gotcha moments, and checkpoints are never very far behind. There is a small bit of jumping puzzle action toward the end (which I'm not a fan of) along with some timed events but those are few and far between. For the majority of the game, Talos is a very peaceful, relaxing game experience. The beautiful open air environments and soundtrack give the game a very zen garden feel.

From the VR side of things, the developers did as good of a job converting Talos Principle to VR as Serious Sam. The best thing I can say is that you'd never know it wasn't made for VR. It has 100%  motion control and roomscale support. It also supports seated and standing if you don't feel like walking around, and full gamepad support if that's your thing.

And locomotion? Play as you like with ""classic"" FPS style movement on the trackpad or teleport, and steer with headlook or controller aim. Adjust your walking/running speed, teleport speed, with comfort options to curtail motion sickness. Plenty of options to control the game how you like.

The virtual worlds are lovely and have a real sense of place, and the 3D audio is good enough to let you know where enemies and obstacles are just by listening. Again, TP feels like it was made for VR.

If you like puzzles, philosophical sci-fi and are hungry for an AAA quality VR game with substance and playtime beyond a few hours, Talos Principle will make you very happy.",1508266525,1508266525,True,78,1,0.846404314041137695,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The puzzles go from being extremely simple progressively to being quite challenging. The landscapes and graphics in general are simply breathtaking in VR. 

The movement style is extremely configurable so you can dial it in just like you want it. 

Yet again, Croteam has also provided a dedicated method for those who like to use mixed reality! 

This game is simply a must have for those of you who enjoy puzzle based VR games set around breathtaking scenery.",1508257943,1508257943,True,65,1,0.720677673816680908,6,False,True,False,False,,,
