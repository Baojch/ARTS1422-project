It was so inspiring, and resulted in my bar for VR being extremely high. I haven't felt that sense of awe, amazement, and fun since then. Until Cosmic Sugar. 8 Million particles, I just played with 8 million particles in real time VR. No flipping way. At first, before buying the DLC, I was convinced that I was warping a dynamic mesh, and most the particles existed inside it as a texture on that mesh with some extremely next level mathematics and shader work. Nope, after getting the DLC, 8 MILLION particles, the patterns you've chosen are utterly mind blowing. There's so much amazing simulation potential in VR, I'm once again inspired. I hope you come back to this project one day and maybe add another DLC pack with some more cool patterns, like an atom shape, or even some kind of shapable spline with adjustable influence points on the tangents to make our own. I'd definitely buy it! Amazing work! 

My favorite way to introduce someone to this is to sit them down with the headset on, and I be the controllers and put on a crazy show first then let them go crazy lol

Games contain meaningful gamelike interaction and game loops, which are absent in this software.  This is a VR exclusive software application that allows you to create various trippy, spacey particle patterns by waving your controllers around.  It's as much a game as filling up your sink, putting a couple of drops of food colouring in, and then swirling your hand around to see what happens.  

For those unfamiliar with what actually makes something a game, a ""game loop"" describes the interaction and feedback a gamer has when playing a game.  Tetris, for example, has a game loop where a random block appears, the gamer interacts with the block to position it, and then the game decides if that finishes a row or not, removes the row if it does, adds to the score, then gives the gamer another block to position.  Counter-Strike has a game loop where a player seeks another player, tests their skill against that player by shooting them or being shot, the game rewards the player if they win, and then repeats that loop.  There's no loop here, no true interactive feedback.  It simply is not a game, it cannot be ""played"". 

This has misleadingly been launched in the ""Games"" section of Steam instead of the ""Software"" section. This is a common mistake for developers who are new to Steam, or don't understand the difference between games and software which isn't a game.  It seems this software published incorrectly as a game is simply lack of experience/knowledge of the correct process.

Here's a link for the process to publish non-game software on Steam: 

[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=925]Steam Developer Help With Software Publishing[/url]

It's unfortunate this process was not known about/followed, resulting in a software application being published in the wrong place.

Publishing things which aren't games on Steam in the Games section as games is misleading to gamers and somewhat harmful, because it pollutes the Steam marketplace and takes away visibility and market exposure for genuine game developers who do the right thing and make games for gamers.

There are no gameplay loops in this software, no ""gameplay"", no meaningful game like interaction. It's a software application and as such has no merits as a video game for gamers. Because of this, I cannot recommend this non-game software as a game to gamers.",1649925076,1649925076,False,2,2,0.187650993466377258,0,False,False,False,False,,,

***********HAVE SOME TIPS TO GET YOU GUYS CREATING SOME SERIOUS MAGIC AT THE BOTTOM********
 guys seriously. just an amazing experience. especially if enjoying from a certain perspective ;-).. no but seriously.. there is so much to work with here, I through on some beautiful relaxing uplifting music and just went to town for hours. I was so excited to rewatch the magic i made after all was said done and I realized it didnt record, have to say i was extremely heart broken... 

**TIPS**
this is just for what's free. not much there but sooo much to work with... 
1. Utilize those triggers.. to create some magical swirls without a bunch of chaos, be gentle with the triggers and it'll allow those specs to chase you around like a comet.
2. it's helpful to keep one hand on the pull and the other hand for repel, together you can make some really nice effects with a quick collapse and expand but also toppling over one another if you apply tiggers just right. 
3. get familiar with using the reset slider during game play, if you throw the particles too far out, it may be a little akward trying to get them back if making a show of sorts. by sliding the reset inward will pull them all together again but be very brief with this, you dont want to take away from the illusion of having control. after bringing them close I recommend keeping the reset all the way outward leaving the particals to remain under no external forces other than you. 
4. with that being said, the best part is using the grip for screen shots. yes by pressing both it will take a screen shot, but by pressing one, it freezes every particle is place. allowing for an amazing canvas to work with, quickly jumping back into motion with a pull or a push followed by another freeze. twisting and turning to the melody of the music (your choice) I will soon be posting some of my own music wonder shows on youtube.

Thanks guys for making this... best partical thing out there..

now... how do i get to unlock the rest of features?

That said, I'm pretty sure this is the same dev as Singularity on Viveport and I'd recommend that instead. Maybe the pro features add something more, I'm not likely to try it because at minimum settings on a fairly powerful GPU and no supersampling, the framerate is absolute trash and the pro version seems like it only adds more demanding features. 

Singularity on the other hand runs well over double the framerate at it's worst and locked to 90 fps with plenty of head room when you're doing anything with your controllers at all, even with significant SS. The only real differences between this version and Singularity is a little larger and possibly less particles (I mean, I'm not gonna count them) and even comes with a time-slowing feature which may or may not be in the pro version here. Cosmic Sugar used to be in white-only but has since added the rainbow colors like in Singularity.

Still my favorite simulation. Actually it's less of a game and more of meditative 3d fractal zen painting.

One thing I didn't like at first though is that the new update had boundaries that stopped the particles from going out of bounds. This made me feel trapped. In the old version you could send particles way out into the infinite space and it made me feel limitless. The boundaries made me feel a little trapped counteracting my enjoyment of what VR is to me. 

So I emailed David, the creator of this amazing simulation and brought this to his attention. Surprisingly, within minutes he got back to me saying I was in luck because he was updating it at that moment and he was able to send me a version without the boundary walls. This is an amazing attitude towards a fan base which I think other developers could really benefit from. 

Hopefully within the next update he will release an option to play with the boundary walls. Especially if enough people comment or bring it up. I definitely foresee this simulation updating and getting more intricate with time.

Hard to believe that something this simple could also be so beautiful. The perfect VR experience to simply relax to. No points, no score, no guns, no enemies. This game is best experienced either standing or sitting, but ideally with some relaxing music playing. This is basically a mesmerizing iTunes visualizer (you remember the good ones? From the early 2000's.) that you get to control. So, to make this a proper review, the good:

1. This is pretty unique
2. It is exceedingly simple in design, but still elegant.
3. It is easy to get lost in this game just playing with the physics.
4. It runs surprisingly well given the CPU intensive nature of the physics.

So the bad (not really bad, just niggles.):

1. There are no options as far as setting. It's a blank dark expanse you stand in. Dev please add some choices for backgrounds. A beach at night, the surface of the moon, etc.

2. No music either. There's plenty of open source chillstep music that would go perfect for this game.

3. Minor performance dips, i'm running an FX-8350 @ 4.2 ghz and a R9-290X and sometimes would see gameplay slow, especially when the particles star clumping tightly. To the Dev's credit, framerates appear to stay solid, but the game time slows to compensate.
