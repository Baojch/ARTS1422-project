Saving all that, I think the game is still enjoyable with mods, but I can't recommend the game. The community is wholly toxic, and the lack of information exchange is to the detriment of new players. In short, it's just textbook gatekeeping. People want to feel good about themselves and need to feel better then others, so they will just revel in your misery instead of help you. I guess it's not so much a problem with the game itself as much as it is that the game relies on exchange of information and ideas, and that is short-circuited by gatekeeping.

This is a game that has the balls to have the classic mage archtype as a locked class from the start to push for engagement with it's world building.
It's an early example of the idiosyncrasies that make this such an absolute gem.

Early on, the class and race combinations and options available are quite limited (although all well capable of achieving a victory), with more options being unlocked with various benchmarks reached, a real nod to the gameplay of the heydays of the 90's and early 00's.

It's not a game that will hold your hand whilst you learn the ropes, but nor is it unfair. Almost every character death a player will experience will be because of something that they could mitigate or have avoided entirely - and considering the genre we're talking about, that's refreshing design.

Finally, there's the sheer variety of options available, far beyond the standard Fantasy Roguelike fare. Yes, you can play a sturdy immovable Dwarf fighter, yes, you can play a stealthy Halfling Thief, but beyond that, there's a wealth of options. A time-travel oriented fighter/archer hybrid? There's a class for that. A freak with a sentient tentacle arm? There's a class for that. An Archmage from a race of giants who cannot use magic? There's an option for that too - and as a mark of how much freedom the game allows, there are recorded winners on the hardest ""non unfair"" difficulty with that exact class/race combination.

While I've played many roguelikes, RPGs, and Diablo clones, there's something fundamentally wrong with the balance in this game. I've tried different approaches on Nightmare and normal difficulty, encountering vaults and optional bosses that are essentially death traps. It raises the question: why include them at all?

I opted for a melee physical class, but it's frustrating when enemies boast 60% resist all and a whopping 80% resistance to physical damage, with elemental resistances hovering around 60-70%. In most games, resist all is a combined stat, not a unique one. In some cases, I can't even overcome their HP regeneration. The best items I found were only offering +15% ignore physical resistance, while elemental resistances were about 30% on same lv range. Why?. Additionally, why include both armor AND armor hardiness?

Gold doesn't have much utility, as there are no NPCs that can reroll stats on items or provide other useful services. The items available in shops are sparse like one floor loot, and the game could benefit from more variety. If the game finish after defeating the ""Master"" boss in Dreadfell, it might not be as bad, but the Far East section becomes a tedious slog as enemies scale significantly. While I'm able to take down some orc bosses in castles, random encounters on level 40 and above feel like a death sentence. Kinda kills atmoshpere. Or i manage to kill Corruptor boss in spellblaze. Hard for melee class. And then i touche some tree and this tree boss spawn use some speed abilities or something and kill me in one turn... lol... so who was boss on this level hahah.

The game should perhaps conclude in Dreadfell, and the Far East could be a separate campaign. A 20-30 hour single playthrough for a roguelike is overkill. Some may enjoy abusing game mechanics to lower enemy levels in instances going there on like lv 10, but I find it rather lame. Moreover, why do enemies scale when mobs don't respawn?

That being said it is still a very hard game, you will die dozens if not hundreds of times before your first win, the game takes some learning on what choices you should make, how to fight certain enemies/bosses, and what gear you should prioritize, but once you get a character that can blaze through the tougher stages of the game you really feel that sense of power, at least until you open a late game optional vault and get blasted by a randomized boss enemy 20 levels higher than you, that's always fun.

I like how you unlock classes/species by finishing quests or finding interesting things, and I do like the turn based combat.

The lore/story is ""Deep"" but not very interesting, its mostly a rehashed LOTR with a little original D&D stuff. You can't really talk to anyone outside of quest dialog.

I think the attempt at slightly more detailed visuals hurts it more than helps. When you have very low detail graphics like ASCII or low res pixels your imagination has to do a lot of the work with abstracting it, when you have clear but often very empty and un-interactable visuals like this everything just looks empty and may as well be a grid of squares on graph paper.

[h3](Some) Key Features[/h3]
The classes each have sufficient depth to the point that changing classes feels like playing a different game entirely. The difference in available classes and builds means that it is very easy to spend several runs learning the intricacies of each class, gradually progressing further each run.

The interfaces are (mostly) easy to read and have helpful popups for explaining stats and features, though these are sometimes insufficient to fully explain the subtleties of the  mechanics. This is partially offset by one of my favorite features: the integrated chat where players can ask questions and talk about the game. 

The community of players is very helpful and are often willing to provide advice for builds and explanations of more complicated mechanics. This is helped by the ability to easily link stat blocks to the chat for others to see, and your current character can be viewed on the game's website by the other players.

The game is mostly bug free, and most of the bugs I have found are cosmetic (loading screens missing their art images for example) or are related to creating a new character without reloading the game (stats/effects from other characters sometimes seem to follow the new character, leading to things like enemies that were generated for the other character's level). During gameplay the interactions between abilities and the enemies/environments seemed to work without any problems.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The main storyline is decent, but the game's best writing is in the (optional) lore books that can be bought/found throughout the games dungeons and shops. Important details are referenced in your quest  log, and lore unlocks can be easily read from the game menu [spoiler](and can be shared between characters by completing an early-mid game quest)[/spoiler].

[h3]Difficulty[/h3]
The game offers two different difficulty types, the first which governs the power-levels of the enemies (easier, normal, etc.) and the second which governs the number of attempts you have (exploration (infinite lives), adventure (extra lives every few levels), and roguelike (no extra lives)). The default combination is 'normal-adventure', standard difficulty with extra lives (but not infinitely many).

The normal mode of the game is sufficiently difficult to provide a challenge without being overwhelming. On normal, I was able to progress through the first few dungeons on a single life, and each life usually entailed progressing an additional 1-3 dungeons farther than the previous. The primary difficulty is learning how the stats of your equipment plays into the effectiveness of your talents (skills/abilities), and the order in which to prioritize your talents. 

[h3](Potential) Pain Points[/h3]
The largest pain point with the game is that as you progress you will likely lose farther along than before, necessitating a rerun (sometimes many) of the starter dungeons you have already cleared previously. To an extent this is unavoidable (just like the early levels of other roguelikes like NetHack), but it can feel a little dull to have just lost a tense fight with a mid-boss only to spend several minutes speedrunning your build through the early game.

Another potential pain point is the complexity of equipment and comparing different pieces. There are a multitude of immunities, resistances, and damage types in the game, and managing your items to balance your needs for defense and offense simultaneously can be difficult at times. While this complexity adds a lot of customization options and strategic planning (do I use the artifact that gives me resistances or the one that gives me escape powers?) it can be a bit hard to know if your build is a good one or not until you start fighting some enemies and suddenly your previously unstoppable character is being cornered by trash mobs while enemy mages keep you disabled.

[h3]Differences From Other Roguelikes[/h3]
One key difference from other roguelikes (such as ADOM or Caves of Qud) is that your character's development options are largely determined during character creation. There are several ways to unlock certain talent categories while playing, and there are a large number of artifacts which can replicate classes' abilities, however a warrior character cannot unlock all (or even most) of the magic talents, and a mage cannot unlock many physical combat talents.

These limitations make sense in the context of ToME as it helps each class preserve its unique flavor [spoiler](and there is a bonus class that lets you mix and match anyway!)[/spoiler].

One other difference is that there isn't really any sort of 'intrinsics and extrinsics' system (such as that found in NetHack). While there are several side-quests that can provide various talents and stats, there are relatively few ways to gain abilities or immunities that are a part of your character and not obtained through equipment/talents. You cannot (for example) find and eat certain enemies to become fire resistant, or to obtain telepathy.

This also makes sense in ToME as a large part of the gameplay is balancing risk and reward when exploring for gear. Many of the best items are 'artifacts', and many of these have the sort of abilities that would be character intrinsics in another game (e.g. water breathing, elemental resistances, teleportation, etc.). If it were possible to obtain these abilities without equipment, there would be no reason to go fight dangerous enemies for the chance of finding good gear.

[h3]Overall[/h3]
ToME is an excellent roguelike with a (very) large amount of replayability. Its many classes, unlockables, and achievements mean that there is always another goal to set, and the game is still in active development meaning that the number of things to unlock and explore are only growing. I would rate the game a 9/10 in general (only losing points for the occasionally under-explained mechanics/systems), and a 10/10 for the roguelike genre in particular.

I suppose that I will start by saying that I probably have put in at least a hundred more hours than what steam shows, as I played this game a lot before I got it on steam with all the expansions. (can't wait for lost land!) I got the game from it's official website, where the base game is available for free. Therefore while I am far from a veteran player, (In fact I will openly admit that I am quite bad) I consider myself well informed enough to write a review. 

With that said, lets start with the basics. Tales of Maj Eyal is a traditional roguelike game, and I consider it to be one of the most polished of modern traditional roguelike games. (modern being as of 2012, or so google tells me.) It takes place in a high fantasy setting with typical Tolkienesk elements, as well as some more modern fantasy ideas, such as time wizards, as well as some steampunk and Lovecraft, if you get the respective expansions. All this combines to make a rich, original high fantasy world with detailed histories and lots of lore. You cane even find some interesting and amusing poems lying around if you look for long enough. While the game has a lot of wonderful lore, the plot itself is not particularly inventive. I'd say spoiler alert, but there isn't a particular lot to spoil. The first half of the game you just spend going around the world investigating exotic and dangerous locations where you fight some baddies, and then for the second half of the game you almost exclusively fight orcs (how terribly inventive) and then take down the evil wizards that were using them as pawns. Yes there are some more details that tie that into the games far more interesting lore, but seriously, I could probably come up with a more interesting plot in fifteen minutes. Now is this really a problem? Not really. People who play play traditional roguelikes, which probably includes you, my reader, aren't really coming here for plot. You're here for strategy and frustrating deaths that make you put an axe through your computer monitor. On that note, let us talk about difficulty.

I have found Tales of Maj Eyal to be a very challenging game, and although ultimately how difficult you find the game can be determine by you and only by you, I'll still discuss what I found difficult about the game, as you may find it insightful. What I have found that makes Tales of Maj Eyal difficult is also related to what I believe to be one of the game's issues, so we shall discuss both here. Tales of Maj Eyal contains an over abundance of trash mobs, which can make a decent amount of combat rather boring (and it is basically just combat, if you were not aware.) Even enemies that it seems should be dangerous, like the elder vampire, which has a description that would make you think you ought to be running for your life aren't much more trouble in my experience than a giant rat or a slime. Enimies only become dangerous when they have the label Unique, Rare, or Randboss (forgive me if I don't have those correct) which can become absurdly dangerous. Allow me to explain. Occasionally, or quite commonly if you are playing on higher difficulties, an enemy has a chance to get some skills from one of the games many classes (more on those later.) They often don't get enough skills to be as powerful as the player, but they can still be deadly, and to the Dev's credit, they can be quite fun to fight. The troubles begin in the fact that certain classes lend themselves to make particularly dangerous enemies. The marauder, for example, is a class that is capable of dealing a lot of damage very quickly, and if they are lucky stunlocking their opponents to the point that they can't really do anything, but if things don't go according to plan their lack of durability shows itself and they are in a bit of a pickle. This makes for a pretty balanced player class, but for a very dangerous enemy. Because the computer is concerned not with it's survival and only with killing you, it will take big risks every time. While the chance of winning as a marauder in a fight by fighting riskily might be only one out of three (terrible odds and they are probably better than that for the player)
Those are very good odds for an enemy, and can become a real problem when you end up fighting quite a number of marauder Uniques, Rares, and Randbosses. Unfortunately, however, it gets even worse. Its possible for these enemies to get skills from multiple classes, to the point that if they are lucky, they can become basically unstoppable. Imagine an enemy with the burst damage of a marauder, the tankiness of a bulwark, and the ranged capabilities of an archer, and you'll be thinking along the right lines. These enemies can hit you from where you can't see, disable you with stuns and similar effects, and then have you dead in a few turns leaving you wondering what you could have possibly done differently. And yes, you probably COULD have done something differently. Tales of Maj Eyal is a strategy game after all, and as a result losing unavoidably is almost theoretically impossible. But all the same, that's hardly justification for what I feel like is bad game design. As a rather unpopular negative review also said, the number of boring enemies can leave you so bored and secure feeling that the one Randboss that has the potential to oneshot you will get under your radar completely undetected because your used to being able to play sloppily and take an excessive number of hits from those bothersome rats and slimes. With that said, onto some good stuff.

What saves Tales of Maj Eyal is the extremely good character building. I'm not going to do the math to figure out how many skills there actually are, but its got to be around two hundred. The game also boasts 29 classes without DLCs and 37 with, as 22 races with dlcs and 16 without. (correct me if I'm wrong on those numbers please) That is INSANE! You'll be hard pressed to find another game with so much character variety. This is what saves Tales of Maj Eyal for me. Making different builds with all that variety is fun and rewarding. I don't mind killing those rats and slimes because it gives me experience which I need to level up and progress with my cool build. And that cool build being good could mean the difference between life and death against those bothersome overpowered Rares, Uniques, and Randbosses. 

Another issue that I would like to touch on is where Tales of Maj Eyal lies on the item to skill spectrum of roguelike games. As the game has so many skills, you can probably already tell that it leans very much that direction. Items rarely ever have activated abilities, there are no one use items, and when they do have activated abilities, they are rarely game changing. As a result, I often wish that Tales of Maj Eyal would do away with items entirely, and focus all of it's attention on skill trees. 
I'm not saying that an item based roguelike can't be good, (I love caves of qud) but Tales of Maj Eyal just doesn't go far enough with it to make it so. In the steampunk expansion (Embers of rage) it even tries to branch out into tinkering, but this feels so weak next to caves of qud's system that I find it almost painful to use. But this is more opinion based than some other issues. I'm happy for you if you can enjoy the tinkering and items :) I Suppose that if you have played many traditional roguelikes you might be thinking: ""No single use items?!? What about potions?!?"" I'm very glad that the developer decided to not use potions in favor of a far cleaner system that gives you a certain number of slots onto which you can place certain skills called runes and infusions that you find. For example, if I find a shielding rune of the warrior, then I can use it to fill on one of my ""inscription slots."" (the standard number is three) when I activate it it will give me a force bubble that takes damage instead of my heath bar for a given number of turns.",1702954240,1702955750,True,1,1,0.502551019191741943,4,True,False,False,True,,,

Subjectively, this is also my all-time favorite:  I keep coming back to TOME because the diverse races & class combinations makes each character feels like a completely different play experience.  No other game I've played has had as much replayability, and still feel fresh.  On top of that, the developer is always tweaking/improving the game and reworking existing classes; so even the same class may play very differently with a major release.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Very solid roguelike rpg. Very light on story, very heavy on combat and looting (loot is similar to ARPGs like Diablo).

Pretty impressive for a 3 man project. The game is actually free on the website (see Steam store page for details) and after dropping 30 hours on the game I decided to buy all the dlc since it's a fun, although frustrating game (because it's pretty hard).

I play on Nightmare Adventurer mode and haven't won a run yet :x

There's not really any modern games out there to compare it to, since it's an oldschool roguelike. So if I had to explain what it plays like, it's a turn-based DnD style roguelike rpg where combat is very heavy on cooldown-based abilities, and you only control one character.

自定义图形界面，按键手势控制，完全汉化，支持创意工坊，角色数据云存储，可选难度，甚至可以公屏聊天，用户友好这一块拉满了。
相比传统roguelike的大量模拟属性，tome4更简单也更纯粹，游戏流程基本是“我不知道我是谁，也不知道我在哪，我只知道我要大开杀戒”，绝大多数时间都在战斗——升级——调整bd中循环，rogue？什么rogue，我是纯良rpg。愿意探索的话也有新职业新种族新支线之类的隐藏要素作为回报。
战斗过程非常直接，不需要侦察技能，没有黑箱怪物，只要右键查看就能看到怪物所有属性和技能，剩下的只有纯粹的走位和技能策略，好处是身为同步回合制游戏却有即时游戏一样的快节奏和攻防快感，坏处是没有很多另辟蹊径的操作余地，像经典crpg或者nethack那样利用各种道具地形事先准备杀死敌人还能写个小作文的情况绝少出现，但是快死了仔细想想还有什么技能能用然后翻盘的快乐是存在的。另外在战斗间隙，没有全局的体力限制，没有多场战斗的续航要求，没有花里胡哨的消耗品，只要把眼前这一战打赢，就永远是完全体，强烈推荐强迫症玩家游玩。
剧情基本靠各种收集到的文本，愿意看的话，什么克苏鲁、神圣的卡拉链接着我们、蒸汽朋克、古典复仇剧、泳装福利回、种族战争、教派斗争乱七八糟的要素也能看个乐呵。
人物build，这位更是重量级。一局十几个小时的删档rpg怎么让人玩下去？因为17个种族+48种职业+六大属性+数十种大小系技能组+通用技能组+觉醒技+纹身符文和可替换道具+特殊装备词条。复杂的人物bd带来的是持续的新鲜感，很多时候一局打完也没玩明白某个职业，有经验的话看看技能组就能大致规划发展路线，但是实际玩起来总会想着也许那样更好，然后慢慢调整成你想要的样子。比如影舞者职业，可以潜行强度拉满，突然现身全伤害暴击打满一套再走进拐角进入潜行；也可以学习法术，大范围致盲眩晕，召唤分身双重打击。比如被诅咒者，可以拉满抗性，层层buff，双持光剑，站撸一切；也可以依靠多件装备的主动技能快速叠满恐惧debuff，配合特殊词条精神伤害触发高伤技能每回合打出一串精神伤害。这些bd不是平衡的，但是通关主线没有问题，因为游戏对数值并没有卡得很死，装备虽然有随机数值但强度更多来源于思路和选择，与暗黑2那种数值的精妙取舍差别较大。
这么多bd当然也是有同质化现象的，坦克类近战打起来都像是贴buff然后rua脸，法爷都像是一发大火球没打死就传送走，看起来各种各样的实现过程，打出来的效果却很像，也许这些职业的乐趣在于读技能吧，在庞大的基数下，部分同质化也是可以接受的。
技能设计是bd乐趣的重要来源，时空守卫有一个大招，重复接下来的若干回合三次，结束后选择其中一种世界线；熵教徒可以将自己必死的命运转嫁给敌人，受到致命伤害时让目标即死；苦痛者一条手臂变成触手，还能控制可以加点穿装备设置ai的分身；蒸汽系职业可以制作装备插件和药剂；毁灭使者可以变身大恶魔将目标拉入独立空间单挑；末日使者可以召唤影子用来移形换位抵抗死亡护卫友军；夺心魔可以控制小怪，连boss都能控制几回合。这些只是冰山一角，一百个小时连种族职业都没解锁完，已解锁的有一大半碰都没碰过，噩梦比基尼一命挑战也没打过，仅仅是皮毛就足以支持数十小时的游戏时间。
总结一下就是，极致堆料，快节奏，高度rpg化，但是高度精简系统的同步回合制roguelike，快餐、现代、写不了小作文，但好玩。",1700725917,1700725917,True,16,1,0.692614734172821045,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Lots of different classes with their own distinct playstyles, resources and mechanics that change the way you approach and experience the game, leading to practically infinite replayability. 

Dedicated dev that has developed, supported and updated the game for more than a decade and added even more content and options to it with the DLC expansions.

Game interface that can be controlled by both mouse and keyboard with ease, fully configurable and rebindable keys and shortcuts.

Easy of use QOL features and streamlined systems makes the tactical combat the focus of the game, akin to a turn-based  ARPG.

Helpful community with lots of information and in-depth discussion across sites, forums, wikis and the in-game chat.

Serious contender for a ""game that you would take to a desert island"".

On a personal note, the sheer amount of options and mechanics (since each class is almost a different game in itself, plus the long campaign run length) leads to a feeling  of being overwhelmed, so I mostly play in spurts once or twice a year. But thats on me, and if anything this is more of a positive than a negative. 

All I know is that whenever I play another roguelike or think of getting  into an ARPG I'm reminded of this game and that I could be dedicating more time to it, learning more about its mechanics and trying different classes, and all other similar games feel lesser or lacking.

This, to me, makes ToME objectively the best roguelike ever made, and one of the best games ever made, without a shadow of a doubt.

ToMEs key aspects consist in:
- [b]Tactical fighting [/b]
- [b]Skill tree progression [/b]
(with so, so many spells and possible hotkey fillers; mouse gestures are bindable and in my opinion recommended for relaxed gameplay)
- [b]Fine-tuning [/b] (by gear stats and order of level-ups, zones, ...) 

Achievement Hunting is fun when you do not aim for perfection and the manifold of classes and abilities provide for a sheer endless blast.
The story and worldbuilding are also great - and optional with lore scrolls enhancing immersion and often times containing clues for what's awaiting you at the end of those corridors.

Information for beginners:
Most players consider the insane difficulty as the main difficulty to play on. If you begin, start out on normal, but aim for nightmare. Fodder enemies will get less and interesting fights requiring strategic action will spice up your game - there the fun really starts.
The graphics might deter you when beginning, but it'll grow on you (""acquired taste"", isn't it?).

Finally, ToME is really cheap even though the developer (DarkGod) deserves way more!
I also recommend the DLCs (but only if you have played a bit - they add some brutal enemies into the main game that are not to be recommended for beginners) - especially Forbidden Cults, but that's just personal preference as all are absolutely worth their money.

It's not for everybody, but if you get used to it, you'll propably really enjoy it!

After you get into the swing of things, unfortunately you will find the classes play pretty same-y, even between runs, and that there isn't really any story present beyond some snippets of setting-building you find as drops around the world. The game appears to be quite long, which would normally be a great thing, except for that initial point where the difficulty curve seems to wildly swing between a snooze fest of easy encounters punctuated by a surprise one-shot that you are left wondering how you were supposed to counter. This means you will spend a ton of time repeating the same early content over and over again with the same classes that offer no variation between runs, and little substantial between one another despite superficial differences.

That kind of superficiality seems endemic to the design, where effort to penetrate artificial inaccessibility masquerades as depth.

While I was trying to get into the base game before I decide to buy the DLC I went on their Discord to ask some questions, then I noticed one member in their 'Tarven' channel actually getting verbally attacked and ganged up on by 5 or 10 (if not more) different members in the Discord server after they started a lie about him, claiming ""he hates women"", that he's a ""misogynyst"" and ""doesn't think women are people"" when that wasn't true at all from what the guy was saying (the guy was just basically saying he spends some of his free time learning about women and their needs to improve his success with them over other guys and not get dumped by the girl like what eventually happens in many if not most relationships). One member even pointed out that this guy they're constantly insulting didn't even say anything bad or hateful. 

But because the people in this community are so extremely hateful and miserable, seemingly jealous of the guy, they decided to go with their little lie about the poor guy and run with it as their justification for essentially cyberbullying the guy for over an hour straight and the guy never even said anything hateful or disrespectful to any of them or anyone period, didn't even really acknowledge any of the people throwing insults at him for no reason yet they continued to do it unprovoked for over an hour straight! 

This community is infested with angry, miserable 4Chan trolls.

Moderators were talking right there as this was happening in the chat and my direct messages to the owner/admin of this game on the Discord server, 'DarkGod', went ignored for many days even though he showed up in the server multiple times. Yet they have a rule on their Discord about being respectful and ""be nice"" but actually do nothing when people form little cliques to gang up on others taking turns insulting a member for no reason. So this community has 'moderators' who ignore cyberbullying taking place in front of them and the owner/admin of the game as a whole doesn't care to read his direct messages on the Discord if you try to contact him about serious issues like this going on in the community. 

This owner/admin named 'DarkGod' clearly cares very little about members of his community. Not going to put my money and time into a game ran by such careless 'staff' who will ignore a guy doing nothing wrong getting picked on and cyberbullied for no good reason, allowing so many evil, miserable, hateful people to do and say what they like to anyone with no consequence. Oh and it looks like their 'moderators' in this community play favorites too - one of the members said a guy in the Discord server can't be banned, the same guy I watched ping the moderators to try and get the guy they were ganging up on for no reason banned, which obviously never happened, which confirms that they were ganging up on someone and cyberbullying them for no good reason and lying on him.

On the bright side, all of those Discord members that were engaging in the cyberbullying of the guy doing or saying nothing wrong were reported directly to Discord. 

Just makes me sick to my stomach to be around so many evil people like that in this community, it is nearly the same as 4Chan seeing how hateful and miserable people are in this community, some of them even saying they do something called ""hate read"" (lol) not worth my time.",1696524631,1696526780,False,3,2,0.355439186096191406,0,False,False,False,True,,,

По традиции есть бесконечное подземелье. Так же имеются две сюжетки. Карты в них уже готовые, а подземелья генерируются, но по заданному типу. 
По поводу врагов - не знаю, так положено ли или это особенности и видение разработчика, но есть мобы которые буквально неубиваемы твоим билдом (А может быть и любым другим). У них просто хил больше получаемого урона, хотя раньше с этим проблем не было. А еще, на сюжетной карте на любой локации нас услужливо встречает табличка рекомендуемого уровня. Она пиздит. Я пришел на локацию якобы 15-25 уровня на 28м и меня вежливо встретили мобы ~33го уровня, угостив после приветствия пиздюлями.

Может, конечно, я неправильно качаюсь ввиду того что буквально лишь слегка окунулся в этот жанр, но довольно часто ты просто ловишь глыбу льда лицом, становишься этой самой глыбой от рядового подсоса, одного из двадцати на локации, затем пока ты стоишь в анимении глядя на происходящее вокруг, толпу крипов распихивает босс и дает по тебе ульту, что снимает 2.5 полоски твоих хп иии... твое приключение окончено.

Система лута просто ужасная. В игре есть легендарки, которые, как я понимаю, прописаны разработчиком, потому что встречал их на разных персонажах и они не отличались, а вот весь остальной лут - чудеса генерации, и уже пройдя обучающие локации, по завершению уровня у вас будет 20 типов разного эквипа, и в каждой варежке, в каждом носке, в каждой кепке будет по 2-20 разных модификаторов, баффов, дебаффов, спеллов, влияния на навыки, на сопротивления, на пробивания, на скорость, на дамаг, на все в этом чудном мире. Поиграв часов 20 я уже просто забил хуй на это дело и стал выбирать исключительно среди легендарок. Грусть правда в том, что легендарки нередко хуже сгенерированного шмота по понятным причинам.

Мне было интересно смогу ли я достаточно кратко объяснить, что конкретно мне в Tales of Maj'Eyal нравится и не нравится, и стоит ли садиться в нее играть более чем через 10 лет после ее выхода.

Как и любой рогалик ToME рассчитан на то, что вы будете много… ОЧЕНЬ МНОГО умирать, анализировать свои ошибки, и начинать заново с полученными знаниями и умениями. Так же реиграбельности способствует просто огромное количество разных рас и классов, которые обладают уникальными механиками и играются совершенно по-разному. Для того, чтобы полностью освоиться с одним классом может понадобиться недельки две достаточно плотной игры по вечерам после работы. И это я скорее преуменьшаю, так как в игре огромное количество артефактов и сетовых вещей, которые могут серьезно влиять на ваш билд, и далеко не все из них вы увидите во время своих первых нескольких десятков попыток игру пройти. А без хорошего билда вы игру не пройдете даже на нормальной сложности. Потому что противники тут…

Да… противники… скажем так: они могут все тоже самое, что и вы! Видите вражеского саммонера или некроманта? Готовьтесь к тому, что уже на следующем ходу он призовет толпу своих подопечных на подмогу. Вы играете за класс, который обладает какими-то сложными механиками с кучей условий, но при их выполнении ваншотит врага? Ну, в следующий раз, когда сдохните так и не успев понять от чего именно, задумайтесь о том, чтобы перед боем внимательно посмотреть, какими классами обладает монстр… да, вы правильно поняли… элитные противники ТОЖЕ имеют уровни в классах, как и ваш персонаж. И пользоваться способностями этих классов они будут не стесняясь. И порой сочетания этих классов настолько убийственны, что вы даже понять не успеваете, что произошло, как уже видите экран смерти.

Казалось бы, все это должно делать игру очень интересной. Однако есть одно «Но!», и оно относится к продолжительности компании. Для рогалика, в котором нормально умирать, игра ОЧЕНЬ долгая. И чем дальше ты проходишь, тем более муторной она становится, потому что противники, как было сказано выше, тут очень опасные, и чем дальше, тем они опаснее. Тут нормально умереть просто расслабив булки и забыв об осторожности буквально на пару минут. И если ты умер где-то в начале компании, то это не так страшно, хотя по десятому разу проходить одни и те же подземелья все-таки задалбывает. А вот если ты умер часу на 20, потому что тебе попался очень неудачно зароллившийся элитный противник или ты случайно сунулся не туда, то от такого просто опускаются руки. Чтобы было понятно, представьте себе, что эта игры – Dark Souls от мира рогаликов, но костров тут нет. Вы бы были рады после смерти в DS начинать всю игру заново? А если это произошло из-за того, что вы случайно перекатились в какую-то яму почти под самый конец игры? Вот игра в ToME вызывает примерно такие ощущения.

Чтобы первый раз полностью пройти игру одним классом у меня ушло часов 70. После этого я ее удалил и не возвращался к ней еще несколько лет. Не так давно я ее проходил снова, и под конец делал это уже на чистом упрямстве. Сколько раз мои персонажи подыхали почти в самом конце компании я даже вспоминать не хочу. Именно в конце, даже при полной прокачке и хорошем билде, умереть проще всего. Я много раз думал бросить эти попытки и снести игру, но ослиное упрямство не давало этого сделать. Я хотел ее победить! И я победил!

После всех этих мучений мне бы хотелось сказать, что больше я ToME не хочу видеть до конца своих дней, но даже несмотря на все перечисленные выше претензии, сказать этого я не могу. Потому что знаю, что вернусь в нее после длительного отдыха, чтобы попробовать какой-нибудь другой класс, найти какую-то новую комбинацию способностей и шмоток и снова ее победить… возможно даже на более высокой сложности. Поэтому рекомендовать ToME я могу только людям с огромным количеством свободного времени и... мазохистам.",1695497752,1695584738,True,5,0,0.584664523601531982,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I hold the belief that Indie developers make the best games because having a single complete vision is the most important part of making a game and DarkGod has certainly contributed to that belief. 

The skill trees take me back to Diablo 2 and the feeling of growing in power but also in flavor. Designing inside the limitations of a turn based square grid has allowed DarkGod to come up with some IMPRESSIVELY creative skills.  Skills that REALLY color the story of the class you're playing in ways that just seem too perfect to put into words. The years DarkGod has put into the game really shine when you look at the impressive list of classes in the game.

A few of my favorite things:
-A spell that makes a save point, you play through 3 different timelines and then choose the one you want to be the real one.
-A spell that takes any damage you receive and smears it over the next 3 turns, potentially giving you critical time to escape and outheal what would have been a fatal blow.
-A Difficulty curve that goes all the way up if you want to. I browse some of the Insane/Roguelike winners just to see what crazy shit they cooked up to beat the game.
-You know that scene in Ratatouille where the food critic takes a bite and is suddenly a child again? That's this game but for the Necromancer class in Diablo 2. DarkGod just nails it. The feel is perfect.
-Oozemancer, make slimes, split up, lurk through your goo and spit phlegm at your enemies until they're dead.
-Solipsist, Nothing exists outside of your mind and if you believe that enough, you can make it true.
-So you wanna play a wizard ay? What kind? Ice? Fire? Lightning? Stone? Arcane? Time? DarkGod has a skilltree for that and you will spend hours thinking about the best way to magically destroy your enemies. Do you want flames to burn the entire screen in every direction as far as the eye can see? Bet. Do you want to encase yourself in a brick wall while an earthquake breaks everyone's ankles? Go for it. Meteors, blizzards, thunderstorms, firestorms, tornadoes, tentacles. DarkGod has skillfully painted the scene. 
-Summon Demons
-Be a dragon
-Be a paladin that turns evil
-Be a paladin that turns into the SUN
-Be a 5 foot stack of worms...yeah really.
-Replace your arms with buzzsaws and rain gore.

I could go on but seriously I can't recommend this game enough. Just get the damn thing already.

Buy? Yes!
Good: Gameplay; Lore; Progression; almost everything!
Bad: Sound; Visuals 



This is a really great game with lots of additional potential. After playing the free version for an evening, I decided to purchase the collector´s edition (non-discounted). 

I can confidently say that the purchase was worth it, even with only ~15hours into the game. 

However, you should be aware this is more of a niche product, both in terms of mechanics (going Roguelike is unforegiving, but not unfair so far). And in terms of ""visuals"". 

Currently, my main request for improvement would be the sound. Maybe it is just a bug, but there is basically no ambience (foot steps, enemies, ...). There are some door and death sounds, but it feels a bit like a game on mute. The music is okay, but I prefer to run my own ambient playlist in the background.
For immersion, even stock sounds would do wonders.

The art is basic, but does its job. It would be great to have some tile rework done at some point to touch up a few things.

All in all, I think it is well worth getting it even for the full price. With the small improvements it could even be fantastic.",1692002307,1692002307,True,0,0,0.491360694169998169,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Longer Review:

How did I miss this hidden gem?  I honestly wasn't looking for a game like this, but it brought back memories of an old PC game and for $7 I didn't consider it a big loss even if it sucked.  Well, it did suck!  It sucked me in so hard that I'm super addicted!  This is a build up your character from scratch kinda game with more build options than you'd expect from a $7 game.  It is hard and unforgiving.  You can't save scum because the game autosaves as soon as you die.  You do have options to get more lives and there are items in game that can resurrect you as well.  The campaigns are long, but not arduous and gathering loot is always a blast.

A huge plus is that you can play the game for free from the developer's website if you think it might not be for you.  After 60 hours, I've had at least 5 characters die and each time I learn more about the game and progress further.  I have since purchased all of the DLC because it has been a wonderful gaming experience for me.  It brings back the memories of when games were actually difficult, didn't hold your hand, and left you feeling victorious when you finally conquered it.  Admittedly, I still haven't conquered it, but I keep getting further and getting past whatever killed me previously is always satisfying!",1691805485,1691805485,True,3,0,0.538005232810974121,0,True,False,False,True,,,

All jokes needless hassle that things like autocast solve (ie making a build around buffing yourself) makes the combat extremely frustrating, why would I not cast a buff that takes almost no resources to cast and 0% of my turn use?
Too much of the game boils down to leveling only passive abilities (since you always get the benefit) vs hotkey management so that you can just go 12345678 + ctrl12345678 + alt12345678 before a fight to have all your buffs up. You could just play a character who has almost minimal active ability usage but that invalidates a lot of the more interesting combos you could pull off, just level passives and pseudo passives and have 1-2 things you actually want to use.

It can be fun but intentional annoyances like not being able to have spells that trigger as soon as a fight starts ruins too much of the balance, it becomes a game of ""Do I want to win"" vs ""Do I really have to do all this uselss busywork before a fight"", then you die because your forgot that among your 50 abilities is an everything proof shield that just came off cooldown and got lost in the noise.",1691226115,1691226115,False,0,0,0.471014469861984253,1,True,False,False,True,,,

You can play as the same race + class multiple times and have each playthrough feel wildly different depending on how you spend your skill points and which weapons and armors drop for you. 

Additionally, a lot of the races and classes are locked initially. I recommend unlocking them naturally instead of using mods to unlock all of them instantly. It's lot more fun to unlock everything and experiment with what you have than it is to just have everything available right from the get-go.

Tales of Maj'Eyal zakupiłem ostatnio na steam summer sale i jednym słowem... Było warto!
Gra (podstawka) jest dostępna za DARMO ze strony producenta, więc każdy może ją przetestować. 
Gra typu klasyczny rogal. Jeden z moich ulubionych. Wielki świat do zwiedzania, mnogość ras, klas, umiejętności i tony sprzętu do zdobywania. Dla fanów statystyk będzie to niezły kąsek bo jest tego mnóstwo.
Na szczęście początkujący gracze też będą zadowoleni bo można wybrać ""uproszczone"" statystyki, więc nie powinni być przerażeni. 
Rasy i klasy odblokowujemy z czasem, wykonując questy. Każda rasa/klasa ma swoje unikalne bonusy ect.
Rewelacyjny tutorial wbudowany w grze, sprawia, że szybko łapiemy co i jak.
Grafika bardzo przyjemna, interfejs obsługuje myszkę, więc można grać jedną ręką :)
Świetna, klimatyczna muzyka.
Lokacje tworzone proceduralnie, szeroki wachlarz przeciwników sprawia, że gra się za każdym razem inaczej.
ToME jest chyba pierwszą grą, która ma prawie 1800 !!! osiągnięć na Steam :D
Jeżeli drogi graczu martwisz się tym, że permaDeath nie jest dla ciebie to w grze można wybrać między Rouglike a adventure mode (możemy albo mieć daną ilość zgonów w grze i RIP albo odradzać się i tracić exp, złoto ect)
Gra ma rewelacyjne community (chat zaimplementowany  grze! )
Sam twórca gry ""nawiedza"" graczy i od czasu do czasu ""odpala"" eventy :D Eventy dla danej rozgrywki możemy kupić za prawdziwą gotówkę w samej grze. Daje ona nowe lokacje dla wszystkich grających w danej chwili!
Warto kupić grę i wspomóc twórców gry bo...warto :)
Jest to la mnie topka z takimi tytułami jak dungeonmaster, FTL, Slay the spire, DCSS.
Gorąco polecam i powtarzam raz jeszcze. Grę można (bez expansion packów) pobrać za darmo i przetestować. Sama podstawa gry jest obszerna i daje setki godzin frajdy.

- A lot of the fun comes from switching from class to class and discovering their talent sets; there are a lot of options in term of play style for each one, so this is quite advanced in term of customisation.

Its not trying to give you a deep story, though there is cool lore.

It offers a challenge, I had an adventurer die at level one early on. I have not made it past level 13 even though I had a very good build. 

There is deep strategy in how you rank up your adventurer. But at its heart it is a rouge with permadeath plus skilled based progression and loot. Not too much loot though so you dont have to check for better gear every 5 minutes. 

I have only played for 3 hours so far but this game is a lot of fun. It reminds me of a much better version of that mobile game that was popular a couple years ago. The one where you pick one of three classes and see how far down you can get in the dungeon. It was a rougelike with permadeath. 

Anyway to this game. The presentation is charming but thats it, yet the systems are very advanced. The class system is awesome. There is tons of equipment, different enemies and its challenging. My first run was with 10 lives but now I am going to play the way this game is meant to be played. I will update my review as I play more. 

But GET THIS GAME NOW FOR ONLY 2.99 ON SALE. LITERALLY LESS THAN A COFFEE NOWADAYS - its full price now and more than worth it

He kept talking about his game, but for some reason I never tested it. Well in fact I tested the old version, before it was known as Maj'Eyal, and did not like it much. Too complicated. 

For some reason I decided to have a go at it again recently and boy, I should have done it much sooner (or maybe not, given the amount of time sunk into it). 

This is a completely different game from what I tested 15 years ago. A difficult, complex but intensely rewarding game. Probably one of the best games I've ever played, and the best roguelike for sure. 

The writing is excellent, and there are many story surprises you will discover. The  gameplay is complex, rewarding, easy to understand but hard to master. There are more classes than you'll be able to play. The game is very well thought out, with everything done to make your life easier, and all the annoying stuff of roguelike (like trips to the shop to sell your inventory) cleverly taken care of in a lore explainable way. 

ToME is difficult. Took me a few tries (10? 15?) to win on normal,  More than I can count to win on nightmare, and I never won on insane. But I enjoyed every minute of it. 

A note, it works well on steam deck. You will have to tweak the controls and bindings a bit to make it playable, but once you have found your perfect setting,  it will be almost easier to play on the deck than on desktop.

To conclude, I have to add that the most notable thing about tome is that it is the work of love of one man, that does it out of love and not to get rich. Personnally, I think he is a genius, and he deserves all the appreciation you can give him, and all your donations. Give him, and ToME, some love. You won't regret it.

Years ago when I first dove into the roguelike scene, I would have said ADOM was the best traditional roguelike out there, but that title is easily held by ToME now. ADOM is still the great game it was back then, but the changes to ToME over the years have been steadily raising the bar past anything ADOM, DC;SS, DoomRL, Brogue, CoQ, etc have to offer.

If you only play one roguelike, make it ToME. Possibly the first traditional roguelike to include progression via unlockable content, and there's quite a bit to unlock and play around with. Tons of procedural content along with immense amounts of lore to discover make this a game for the ages.

From the moment you start playing, you're immersed in a rich and engaging world full of interesting characters and deep lore.

One of the things that really sets Tales of Maj'Eyal apart from other RPGs is its deep and complex character customization system. There are dozens of different classes to choose from, each with its own unique abilities and play style, and you can mix and match them to create your own truly unique character. Whether you prefer to play as a powerful mage, a deadly assassin, or a stalwart warrior, there's something here for everyone.

The game's combat system is also incredibly well-designed, with a variety of different tactics and strategies to employ depending on the situation. You'll need to think carefully about your positioning, your abilities, and your equipment if you want to emerge victorious in battle.

But what really makes Tales of Maj'Eyal stand out is its story. It's a deep and complex tale that will keep you engaged and invested from beginning to end. The world is richly detailed and full of fascinating lore, and the characters you meet along the way are all well-written and memorable.

This is quite likely one of the best roguelikes [i]and[/i] RPGs I've ever played, even if you consider the genres separately. Do not be fooled by its simplistic art style, beneath it is a very complex RPG with an absurd amount of content and replayability. ToME is clearly a passion project by a very dedicated developer. 

[h1]The Good:[/h1]
[*]You can try the base game for free on the developer's website. 
[*]Highly intuitive, customizable UI. Full M+KB support, plays like a modern tactical game.
[*]Full price is more than fair for the amount of content you are receiving.
[*] Workshop and addon support.
[*]In-game global chat: 
[*]Interesting gameplay loop, multiple campaigns, difficulties, and game modes.
[*]Many unique unlockables that contribute to an enormous sense of progression even as you lose characters.
[*]Ingenious ownership model. Your account tracks ownership of the game and DLC, so you can install it even on computers without Steam by using the game's client.
[*]More forgiving difficulties with more or infinite lives if you are initially daunted by roguelike difficulty.
[*]Combat is varied and fun.

[h1]The Meh:[/h1]
[*]Some of the music is great, other tracks can start to grate after hearing them for the 100th hour. Sometimes I play music in the background instead.
[*]Sound effects can be a little basic. Others can be great (WO tentacle attack)
[*]More like a learning cliff than a curve.
[*]You will be randomly one-shot a lot until you learn to be cautious.
[*]ToME is a niche game with a small player base, so you may need to do some research if you have questions.

名前も読めない10年以上前のゲームがフレンドから送られてきた時は正直困惑しました。
バタ臭すぎる操作を確認しながらチュートリアルを終えて、よくわからないまま人間の戦士キャラを作り森に出かけました。トロールのボスを倒したあたりから「（あれ、もしかしてわりと面白い？）」と思うようになり、帰還システムやインベントリ整理用のアンロックアイテムを手に入れてワールドマップを散策するうちに冒険意欲が沸き起こり、1キャラ目をロストする頃には間伐入れずに魔法職のキャラクターを作ってすぐさま冒険に戻るほど熱中していました。

グラフィックはチープです。UIは分かりにくいです。操作も快適とは言えません。でもなんなんでしょう、このノスタルジーだけではないゲーム体験の魅力は。きっと開発当時、挑戦的で先進的なゲームを提供しようと野心に満ちた設計で開発されたのでしょう。その熱量のおかげで、それぞれの技術分野が洗練された現代においても、開発当時のプレイヤーのワクワク、没入感、時代感、すべてそのままに体験することが出来ます。自分は今、2012年にこのゲームを遊んでいるのだと錯覚させてくれます。

初めて聞く名前の世界、よくわからない種族、知らない歴史、洋ゲーらしくオリジナル世界を展開することに躊躇がありません。死んだら終わりの世界では手探りにもリスクが付きまとい、ほどよい緊張感が生まれます。
よくあるいわゆるターン性ローグライクなのですが、敵はわんさか装備はジャブジャブ手に入り、ハクスラのような爽快感もあります。要素のアンロックという形で次の周回に変化が起きるのも嬉しいバランス。不思議なことにキャラロストすら新たな始まりのための必要な犠牲と割り切れてしまいます。

決して万人にオススメはできないゲームですが、このレビューを最後まで読む程度に興味を持っている人になら、恐らく勧めても問題ないでしょう。
あの頃のドキドキ、記憶の中にしかないはずだった美しいゲーム体験をそのまま味わいたい人に。
画面を覆う派手なエフェクトに疲れた人に。
乱立する攻略サイトの最強やらマラソンやらの客寄せ文句に辟易している人に。

That is the biggest issue with this game, a lot of the gameplay you do feels a little bit meaningless as it's just killing low level enemies, in the end (After I got my first victory) I downloaded a mod that makes an AI take over my character until it reaches low health because that's the moment when combat becomes interesting, at least all of what I have said applies on normal difficulty.

Then you play the nightmare difficulty and normal mobs (in numbers) become actually difficult, If you give up on this game because it's too easy, try the nightmare difficulty as that's what it feels like the ""intended"" difficulty is.

I like pixel graphics and this was the first true rougelike pixel game I got fully immersed in. 

At this point - with 10 hours into the game - I'm still not sure if there is an overarching story .... all my time has been spent in exploring forests, mines and ruins where you find bits of lore to read and I've enjoyed every moment. The lore though hasn't yet pointed to a story and has random bits from other travelers about the area you are in.

The bosses and higher level enemies are good challenges and it is interesting to strategize and fight them with a mix of talents, spells and physical abilities.

 I'm playing my current character on ""Adventure"" mode where the game gives you an extra life every few levels (max 7 lives in total). This is enough for me to fear death and get a rush out of trying to tactically fight or retreat from a harsh fight.

All in all, very satisfying gameplay. I don't realize how the hours pass by when I'm in the game.

There's some interesting lore, but you're not going to give a damn after you've seen the first dungeon for the twentieth time this week.  Getting anywhere is a question of pure RNG:  Did you get any good drops?  Did the encounter table roll up something manageable for your class choice?  No?  Then back to start!

Don't get me started on the bosses.  For the first ten levels or so, they're fine, they're beatable.  But once you start to approach level 20, they become impossible.  Let's look Urkis.  He is the bane of the early mid-game.  After your first attempt at a character fails to kill him, you'll start your next character by preparing for him, gathering lightning-resistant gear.

Except it doesn't matter, because he cheats around the lightning resistance.  Even with 70%, his Hurricane spell was still taking me for about 1/10 of my health every turn!  And once you reach the level where you start to fight bosses of his caliber, no status effects that would be useful against them work.  It would be great if I could lock him down with Stun, Mindblast, and Daze; that would show that there's an element of skill to this game, since I could beat him with good preparation.  Even getting lucky one time and finding a Prismatic Rune before fighting him, I still died a couple of times before I could bring him down.

And that leads me to another problem:  The descriptions of how certain things work are God-awful.  What does the Prismatic Rune do?  The description suggests that it makes you immune to a certain number of elemental strikes over the course of several turns, except that's clearly a lie, as I'm still taking damage from dragonbreath and the like.  My most successful character died to the Orcish Pyromancer explicitly because I could not use this rune the way it says it works, to shrug off his opening salvo and gain an early lead.  Once again, an example of good preparation being of no use in this game.

RNG screws you over once again on loot drops.  They are entirely random, and don't scale well with your level.  My MOST successful character was forced to delve into Dreadfell with a weapon that I had found back when I was level 8, because it was the best one I had found in all of that time.  I only succeeded because I found two better ones on my way up, each one nearly doubling my damage cap because of how under-equipped i was.  And even then, I once again only beat The Master because I was lucky!

Caught off guard in the middle of fighting some underlings, i dropped a Quake and happened to trap him in a little 2x2 room with me, so that he couldn't escape and couldn't summon more than two minions to hit me.  If I hadn't managed to do that, there's no way I would have ever beaten him!

If they would fix their broken mechanics and loot tables, this game MIGHT be playable.  I certainly must have gotten some amount of fun from it to have given it so many chances to persuade me that it was good.  But I can never recommend it, given the experiences that I had.",1674210101,1674210101,False,0,6,0.353028446435928345,0,False,True,False,True,,,

其实很简单，这个游戏鼓励你多点不同的技能而不是精通其中某一个，技能等级越高收益越小，换句话说就是可能的话尽量多点新的技能而不是加强已有的，除非是技能随升级会额外多出一些作用范围或者持续时间，那就可以卡着提升的阈值点一下，如果升级只是提升数值的话一般来说只要点两级就够了，再往上点收益很低不划算。

明白了这个之后就比较容易上手了。。。

然后就是，逃生能力＞生存能力（抗伤害能力）＞输出能力，输出能力通常是最次要的，除非面对某些回血极强的boss，生存能力只要保证你作为脆皮不会转角被秒或者作为坦克可以抗住几轮围殴就行，逃生能力才是最重要的，打不过至少也要跑得了。

种族推荐选普通人类，多一个大系点数build的时候不要太好使。

职业的话，刚开始玩推荐盾战，突出一个肉，玩起来也不需要什么操作，堆肉就行了，缺点是输出不高，逃生能力差，切人能力也差，容易被风筝或者被一大群肉度不低于自己的怪围殴致死。法师职业一开始只能选炼金术士，这个职业能不玩就别玩，整个一下水道，不仅操作起来很麻烦强度也不高。

However, if I'm going to be honest, the more I played ToME4 the less I enjoyed it, so I'm not sure if I can give this offering a positive recommendation.

My main points of criticism are:
- The game receives periodic updates, however almost all of these are purely additive and only add content to the game (e.g. new classes), and do very little to improve the core of the game.
- Though the tile graphics are nice, the interface in general is overall quite minimal as far as usability goes. Inventory management is only one step up from 80's roguelikes. To give an example, ""19 foos"" will be sorted before ""2 bars"" because the ""1"" in ""19"" comes before ""2"".
- The gameplay itself, though interesting at first, becomes tedious and repetitive quickly, with most of the excitement coming from the difficulty curve which often resembles a seismograph. Unlike most other classic roguelikes, Tales of Maj'Eyal does not have consumables (potions / scrolls) to allow overcoming difficulty spikes, and does not have grinding (the amount of XP you can earn in one playthrough is capped), so your only tools are kiting, and coming back later, which may not be an option depending on the RNG.
- In my opinion the game's author seems to take too much of an interest in players' progress. Features are gimped unless you create an account on the game's website and upload your gameplay data. The game also, without warning or explanation, messes with your operating system's settings when you run it and, for whatever reason, associates itself with some subset of the Discord protocol.

I think most of these shortcomings are entirely forgivable considering that ToME4 is a free game, so my review above only applies to the paid Steam offering.",1671587196,1671587404,False,10,1,0.575539708137512207,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Moreover, sudden BS unfair deaths are extremely minimal, but you will still get instantly smitten when you accidentally walk into a high-tier dungeon boss room (which can be avoided once you know the dungeon tiers). On the plus side, there's a difficulty setting which allows you to gain lives at certain levels which further mitigates permadeath from misclicks or dumb mistakes.
- There are many viable and fun classes to unlock and try out, so if you die it's an opportunity to play a different class. 
- There's an in-game online chat (mature boomers all around so it's nice) which also displays active player deaths sometimes hilariously so.

毋须讳言，就当今的新游戏而言，画面表现是构成吸引力的最直观因素，也是游戏体验的重要组成部分。但对于一些老游戏，在外观上占据天然劣势的情况下，仅仅依靠其无与伦比的游戏内核，也足以令人沉迷其中。《Tales of Maj'Eyal》正是这样的一款作品。
很难用一两句话去概括我的游玩过程，因为其本身存在一定的上手门槛，搞清楚游戏的框架就需要一点时间，且我这300小时自觉也还有很多摸不清楚的事情。但它就是有那种吸引力和魅力，让我一次次的暴毙又一次次的重新建立人物。它既是复杂的，可以给我上百个小技能树供我选择；又是轻松的，我不必有那么多的算计，只需要投入一场似曾相识的全新冒险。
作为一款传统rogue游戏，它天生兼具有rpg的流程感和roguelike的随机性；类似于回合制的游戏机制也不会带来难度上的操作压力；海量的独立文本构建出了独特的世界观；丰富的种族和职业相互搭配更能让人永远保持新鲜感；更不必提流程中俯拾皆是的小小巧思。它有一种常见常新的独特魅力，像是标签泛黄的陈年老酒，沉淀着时光的芬芳。
优点：世界观独特，build丰富，内容量大管饱，且永远令人沉迷
缺点：上手有难度，整体很有nerd气质，作者怎么还不更新

It's more like Adom, has the feeling of a crpg shoehorned into a roguelike. This is kinda nice, because I found the story compelling, but also kinda bad, because being it a roguelike you will have to play again and again at least the beginning part of the story. 

It has tons of items/monsters/resistances/attributes/whatever. This makes it hard at times judging if an item is better than others or how the several resistances/attributes are playing together.

One negative aspect is that randomness in enemies generation is so high that every now and then an almost unbeatable enemy gets generated. This happens usually mixed with other trash monsters you'd usually slash trough like butter, thus giving you an easy death.

This is a good game, very addictive. But, after having played hundreds if not thousands of hours (I played the free version from the developer's website before getting it on steam), the fundamental problem is the same shared with others roguelikes with tons of enemies: you have to pretend to pay attention/care to trash mobs in the rare case where an almost unbeatable rare boss gets generated among them if you don't want do die. And this is kinda not a very funny way to play the game.

However, to let you enjoy the game as an  rpg and not a roguelike, you can play the mode with limited (7) number of lives or unlimited (only pay versions). After all, the purpose of playing a game is having fun.",1669146211,1700592786,True,0,0,0.481859415769577026,0,False,False,False,True,,,

So many different classes and races, which you unlock as you do certain things in the game.

I love the campaign style to the game in that rather than it being one dungeon like most traditional roguelikes, you explore many smaller dungeons each with their own backstory and boss. Each dungeon also has an alternate layout which can quite drastically change enemy types and the final boss. Although the campaign style takes some getting used to, there are some great guides of order to tackle particular portions of the game which helped me get a lot farther and avoid situations where I may get a 1-hit death (although this still happens on some of the harder difficulties). 

A good guide is Cath's BFG: https://forums.te4.org/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=48660

If you have ever played an MMO, the itemization and abilities will click for you.
If you have ever played a TTRPG, character building and leveling will click for you.
If you like both, and have struggled with Traditional Roguelikes, this might just be the game for you! :)

In more detail:
The really clean UI and the option to use your mouse for most menu actions while still maintaining a lot of keyboard control feels awesome. Animations are simple and easy to read, as are the tiles. This is the first game where I'm not opting to play ASCII. 

As for the gameplay itself, I've decided to start playing and learn the game on Nightmare Roguelike difficulty. So far, everything seems really fair. There's definitely more longevity in the early game, and you're given a decent bit of room for error in your first 10 levels. I can't exactly speak for later -- I haven't hit 10 yet. 

There doesn't seem to be a super strong punishment for not knowing builds, at least early. It feels like you have a lot of room for experimentation in each of your runs. I get the feeling I'll figure out what's good and what's not good naturally over time without a lot of frustration. 

TOME also has Metaprogression! This comes in the form of convenience items, races, and classes.

Not having 16 races and 20 classes to choose from right off the bat made my introduction to the game really pleasant. Even though not everything is unlocked, there feels like just enough to suit most playstyles from other roguelikes.

Overall, this feels like a breath of fresh air after having tried many, many, many traditional roguelikes. (This list inludes Rogue, Nethack, Sil, DCSS, Infra Arcana, Qud, ADOM, Brogue, Cogmind, and a tiny bit of Angband.)

I may have just found my favorite of the genre! :)

This is a very high fantasy game with humans, dwarves, elves, trolls, undead and all those archetypes you'd expect and luckily the lore is quite well written more so than the quests however if you have the DLC's there's more interesting themes added on to the original fantasy setting of the base game with the first DLC being more evil themed and the second going for a steampunk meets fantasy approach reminiscent of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magic Obscura (which is a great but heavily flawed game worth checking out as well) and the third DLC being Lovecraft themed and all these DLC's add more classes and races to the game while expanding on the already extensive content of the main game. The main highlight of the game is of course the tactical turn based combat that varies by which class you play and how you choose to build said class since ever class has multiple skill trees as well as passive skill trees, the classes range from what you'd expect from most fantasy RPG's to some really strange and unique ones like a time controlling warrior/ranger known as a Temporal Warden or a wizard who uses Sun and Moon magic known as an Anorithil or even a warrior with the powers of elemental dragons known as a Wyrmic, they are very creative with these classes even the more basic ones and there's significantly way more than I just mentioned but just to let you know, you have to unlock a lot of these classes since you only get a select few to start your first few runs with and they do have some oddly specific criteria's to unlock certain classes so I recommend reading the game's wiki. Despite being a Roguelike, there are modes for unlimited lives (the usual save/load or respawn after death) and limited lives (think of it as Super Mario where you got limited lives before a game over where you have to restart entirely) but personally I don't mind the traditional Permadeath in this game since it feels more rewarding to me at least knowing my build is viable enough to make it far. Also the music in this game is amazing, sure it's pretty typical fantasy game music but it ranges from very chill to sounding like an epic battle is going on, I personally like it a lot since it works with the general theme of the game anyways and most importantly this game is mostly made by one guy which is even more impressive. I highly recommend this to old school RPG fans who prefer to focus on building characters with unique and fun playstyles rather than choice and consequence, get it with all the DLC too its more than worth it considering how much content is given and it being made primarily by a solo dev.",1663627200,1663627200,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Several interesting/viable class and generic skill trees for each class/race.
Truly a passion project resulting from a mountain of effort. Difficulties for all types of gamers (from easier to very very hard, roguelike or multi-life modes).

Unlike a normal roguelike that have at best 2 hour before the game absolutely will kill your character, you can and have to play for 12 hour for one run, AND survive! Or you can pick infinite live mode and make the dev low key mock you for ""Not playing the intended way""

Game progression always revolve around carefully grinding every single enemy in all map with a somewhat very specific sequence, less you will die a horrendous instant death. Using the item and skill you need will feel like a RNG situation where you hope that the next enemy you fight is weak enough to die in a single turn, or not, and you have to run if that happen.

There's a massive amount of build that you can choose, but knowing will it work require either trial and error, or you could just read the description for each skill, foreseeing if it work or not, then die after testing it as your character is locked into that bad set of skill. All Item is very RNG, and having the right equipment for the right skill tend to be tied to each run, but there's feature that allow you to get through this after you discover the Shertul fortress that act as a home for all of your character when unlocked.

The character is diverse, combined with a lot of background that you can choose, and most of them are terrible / challenge mode. Play as Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Human, Taller human, Skelly, Undead, and some more i can't remember. Some of the character and background are locked with achievement, but to know how to unlock them will require googling. The build you can choose is diverse, but at higher difficulty you have to use specific build to survive.

The story...are not memorable, the npc.. i don't remember anything, my memory of this game is filled with agony of each unfair death, as if it was supposedly avoidable but i failed to do so. Trial and error will be your only memory of this game.

The build, the skill is not all you need to survive. In this game after playing for long time you will gain wisdom to know the strategy for each situation. Like you are not supposed to open locked door unless you are overpowered, or near endgame there's a door that must NOT be opened at any time, taunting enemy so you can 1v1, and many more.

And for the final score...

uma absoluta masterpiece. quanto aos gráficos, o jogo possui um aspecto horrivelmente retro e à primeira impressão, parece mais um jogo mal acabado, que deixa a desejar. mas depois de se jogar dez ou quinze minutos, percebe-se que os aspectos positivos do jogo contrabalanceiam FORTEMENTE os contras. 


[h1]RESUMO[/h1]
o jogo é um RPG roguelike de turnos e o seu aspecto mais positivo é ser complexo na medida certa. você é capaz de criar builds até com aspectos antitéticos, e da maneira que quiser. conta com uma complexidade de classes absurda, por exemplo, você consegue jogar com um arqueiro especializado em facas, um guerreiro que usa magia, ou um monge que possui poderes de possuir inimigos (possessor), um mago antimagia (!), etc, etc, etc. tudo é possível. são tantas as opções, que estatisticamente dizendo, é capaz de você criar uma classe com combinação de talentos jamais antes usada.

não se engane, esse jogo é um indie, é um jogo de nicho. mas apesar disso, faz muito bem o seu papel em entreter e em desafiar o jogador diante das mais diferentes situações e cenários. não existe build perfeita: se você toma proveito de uma build forte no começo, ela certamente será fraca em algum momento do jogo e vice-versa, te obrigando a utilizar abordagens diferentes para vencer os seus desafios - que por muitas vezes, serão obrigatórios para prosseguir nas quests. os itens possuem tantos atributos que você é capaz de escolher qual o atributo primário que quer focar no seu personagem.


[h1]PONTOS FRACOS[/h1]
a história do jogo, apesar de poder ser desprezada, não é recomendado que se faça. são mais de onze mil linhas de história, que explicam o contexto e os motivos para os eventos acontecerem, tal como o caminho que você deve traçar. não se engane, a história como um todo é linear, mas você é livre para fazer quantas side quests que tiver oportunidade. a comunidade não está morta, visto que o idealizador do jogo (darkgod) ouve bastante as opiniões dos jogadores e trabalha nos novos updates também com base naquilo que lhe é sugerido.

por ser feito por uma equipe pequena, o jogo possui, uma vez ou outra, bugs que irritam, mas nada que autosaves ou reabrir o jogo resolvam. algo muito negativo é que ele conta com um sistema complexo de conquistas steam, dividido para cada tipo de gameplay (soft, medium, hardcore), e isso, talvez poderia ser unificado ou simplificado de alguma outra maneira. os gráficos são feios, não espere um jogo bonito. mas definitivamente espere um jogo F0D4.


[h1]TEST DRIVE GRATUITO[/h1]
o jogo consta aqui na steam, mas somente como compilado organizado de arquivos que são auto atualizados se tiver algum update. você pode baixar uma versão de graça completa na internet (no site ""te4(PONTO)org"") e jogar à vontade, com os mesmos recursos do que aqui. inclusive sugiro que seja feito isso, que prove o jogo de graça no site, e se achar que o jogo merece uma força, comprar por aqui.

Using a turn-based WEGO system (hooray for the 21st century, begone IGOYOUGO!) ToME asks the player to choose a class, a race and a few points to be invesed in said class before shoving you into the world of ToME. There are more classes and races to unlock and these require various achievements (mostly hidden). Each pairing of class and race has many ways to build; some certianly more effective than others. For the more intricate classes, a few deaths will be required on the players part before you begin to understand and figure out which abilities to combine/put points into and honestly, that is half the fun. You might initially feel a class sucks, only to realise on a replay that there are other tricks and combinations you didn't try. 

If you like these games for the loot, then fear not as this game is bursting at the seams with generic, graded and legenadary items to mess around with. And as I said in my opening line, this isn't just a rogue like with RPG elements; it has a proper world with its own lore and many quests to try out, so there is no risk of being turned off the game in the long run due to being shallow. Often these kinds of games struggle to find such a balance between depth of options and narrative and this is especially true of rogue likes. ToME has managed to find that sweet middle ground. 

It also has a very active developer; the official Discord is awesome (unlike most official game rooms that are toxic cesspools of basement dwellers just waiting to find something to be offended about), a nifty in-game chat room for bragging and crying over your adventures and there is heaps of more content in the form of multiple DLC.",1659448209,1659961598,True,14,0,0.671713948249816895,0,True,False,False,False,,,

2. 테일즈 오브 마즈'에이알 지도 / 본편 던전 공략 순서

https://gall.dcinside.com/rlike/412955

참고1) 키보드 J키를 눌러서 퀘스트를 확인하세요. 마도사 시작퀘('너무나 광활한 공간' 던전의 마법 폭발의 후폭풍 퀘) 하는 분은 위상 관문 스킬로 섬을 옮겨 다니며 랜덤한 위치에 나타나는 3개의 웜홀에 주문 스킬을 적중 시켜야합니다. 마나 회복을 위해 몹 1마리 잡을 때마다 R키나 Shift + R키로 휴식을 취하세요.
참고2) 폭풍우 봉우리는 앙골웬 마을 안 서쪽의 npc와 퀘스트를 진행, 대화 후 입장합니다. 
전기 저항템 필수!
참고3) 발명 스킬(팅커), 아티팩트 옵션 변경 기능(리롤), 새로 추가되는 직업 때문에 Collector's Edition (모든 DLC 포함) 을 추천합니다.
참고4) 지구르 마을에서 반마법 서약을 한 캐릭터는 반마법 캐릭터로 분류되어, 마법장비 착용이 불가능합니다. 초보자는 반마법 서약 하지 마세요.
참고5) 샌드웜 굴에서 획득한 샌드웜 여왕의 심장을 사용하면 스탯 3 , Class points 1 , Generic points 1 , 자연의 권능 / 조화 기술계열(Category)를 얻게 됩니다.
참고6) 세계지도의 랜덤한 위치에서 나타나는 NPC 은둔자 - 아그림레이를 먼저 만나서 직업기술(Class points) 2 점을 주는 연금술사 형제단 퀘스트를 가장 먼저하세요. 퀘 완료시 인벤토리에 집중의 영약이 넣어집니다. 그 다음 마지막희망 마을 안 5시방향 건물의 웅그롤의 집에서 퀘스트를 진행하면 일반기술(Generic point) 2점을 주는 기초의 영약을 줍니다. 그리고 엘발라 마을 중앙 건물의 말루스의 집에서 퀘스트를 진행하면 능력치(stats) 4점을 주는 기술의 영약을 줍니다. 위 3가지 퀘 모두 미리 받아 놓는 게 가능합니다. 이후 연퀘는 취향 따라 보상 받으세요. (미라화된 뼈는 고대 엘프의 폐허에서 구할수 있음, 고렙존)
참고7) 데르스 마을 안의 NPC 수상한 코르낙 남성과 대화하여 투기장 퀘스트를 하세요. 일반기술(Generic points) 2를 줍니다. 14렙이 되기 전에 꼭 투기장 퀘스트 하세요. 14렙에 폭풍우 마을 퀘스트가 시작되며 NPC가 모두 죽을 수 있습니다.
참고8) 폐허가 된 하플링 복합 단지(4) 에서 한길을 구할 경우, 정신 내성+15, 혼돈 저항 10%를 얻습니다.
참고9) 일부 직업은 전투 기술 / 전투 훈련이 열려 있지 않습니다. '마지막 희망' 마을에서 구입할 수 있습니다. 활/투석﻿구/총기 사용에 필요한 사격 기술도 '마지막 희망' 마을에서 구입할 수 있습니다.

5. == [팅커(발명 스킬) 해금법] ==
https://tome4guide.tistory.com/#5tip

장비에 붙이는 부착물, 일명 팅커(발명)가 사기라서 DLC - Embers of Rage 는 구매 필수입니다.
캠페인: 오크:분노의 잉걸불을 선택하고 발명가 - 톱도살자와 총잡이 두 캐릭 모두 전초기지까지 깨서 동대륙(본대륙)으로 갈 다리를 열어야만 팅커가 해금됩니다.

스팀 창작마당에서 Select your Escorts 와 Escorts Enhanced, ZOMnbibus 를 게임 시작전에 구독하세요.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=588789394
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295210042
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203060064
 
6. == 팅커 사용하기 ==
https://gall.dcinside.com/rlike/394246

위 6번을 따라 팅커(발명가)를 해금했다면, 캐릭터를 만들고 Escorts(호위) 선택지에 발명가가 보일겁니다. 순서 정할 때 1번으로 나오게 하기 위해 제일 먼저 누릅니다. 발명가는 1번 밖에 안나옵니다. 호위 실패하면 새캐릭으로 다시 시작해야합니다.
호위 순서를 잘못 지정했다면 ESC키를 눌러서 맨 위의 Escorts (again)을 눌러주세요.

호위 도달 지점은 Tab키를 누른 후 마우스로 이동, 확인할 수 있습니다. Tab키를 두 번 누르면 미니맵이 원위치됩니다.
호위가 완료되면 선택지가 나오는데 제일 아래쪽의 발명가의 위치를 알려달라고 합시다. 
그러면 세계 지도에 발명가의 대가 동굴이 나오는데 Category Point를 아꼈다가 20렙 쯤에 가서 몹을 잡고 길을 뚫은 후, 맵 중앙의 기계장치 상점에게서 500골드와 Category Point 1을 주고 배웁시다. 

참고) 발명 스킬(팅커)을 배우면 자동으로 아이템을 변환 상자가 아닌, 휴대용 자동 추출기로 녹이게 됩니다. 쉐르툴 요새의 기능 해금을 위해 에너지가 필요할 때는 인벤토리의 퀘스트 아이템 탭에서 다시 변환 상자를 사용하여 아이템을 녹여주세요.

ゲームオプションは最初は英語だが
ゲーム内でオプション開くと日本語になる

ほぼ変わんないフリー版があるので、買う前に試した方がいい
違いは共有倉庫が使える、クラスが1つ解放される、DLCが使えるだと思います
私が良いと思う買い方はフリー版で試して気に入ったら、
全部入りセットをセールの時に買うという方法です
別にセールじゃなくてもいいです、十分その価値はあります
はまったらDLC全部ほしくなるのでいきなり全部入りでOK

正直、無料と有料版の詳しい違いとか
オンラインアカウント作るとどんなメリットがあるのかとかよくわからない

分かってる限りではオンラインはオンラインイベントがある
チャットで実績取得や死亡ログが全世界に公開（他のプレイヤーの情報も見える）
公式HPに自キャラのキャラシートが公開などなどです
チャット欄がちょっと邪魔ですね、チャット欄だけ消したい
自キャラのキャラシートは使ってるAddon(＝MOD)、難易度、スキルその他
ほぼ全てのゲーム内情報を確認できる
オンラインであれば常に更新され、死亡済、プレイ中、クリア済キャラを見れる
検索もでき他プレイヤーの高難易度の
アーチャーのクリアキャラが見たいなと思ったら
その条件で検索すれば参照できる
MODの追加難易度・クラスにも対応してるので
MOD追加クラスで検索することもできる

ただナイトメア難易度のクリアキャラでも
入れているMODによっては額面通りの難易度とは限らない

このキャラデータは一部ゲーム内の言語で表示される
（スキルやアイテム等、日本語でプレイ中なら日本語で表示）
日本語でプレイしてるキャラデータは英語日本語混合で
外国の人が見てもわからんかも
中国語のキャラデータとか英語中国語混合でわかんない
アイコンがあるから辛うじてスキルとかはわかる

スキル・アイテムの名前とかは意訳されてます
このゲームの情報って基本的に日本にはなくて
解説情報も攻略情報もビルドも英語圏の情報頼りなんで
そのまんまカタカナ直訳名詞とかにしてくれた方がよかったかも
ほとんどの攻略情報は英語だから
意訳された日本語訳とスキル・アイテム名が違うので？？？ってなる
日本語なのはとってもありがたいんですが

ストーリー関係の文書とかは意訳のおかげで読みやすい

ターン性ローグライク
消耗品はなくてスキルと装備アイテムで攻略していく
消費アイテムとかはない為、育成メイン
育成に失敗したらマジでどうにもならない
格上や苦手なタイプに相対した際シレンみたいにアイテム使って
切り抜けるみたいなことは難しいと思う
とりあえず緊急回避して他のところで育成して再挑戦みたいな
やばい奴にあった時どう切り抜けるかみたいな情報があんまない
たぶん英語圏にはある、まぁ逃げるしかないと思う

ゲームバランス等は細かく調整されている（と思うたぶん）

自動探索機能があるためサクサク遊べる、自動探索機能最高
といってもまぁクリアまで20時間以上かかるのでそれほどサクサクでもない
慣れているプロローグライクプレイヤーなら別

パラメータが敵味方ともにシークレットではない
敵味方自キャラの能力は普通にほとんどプレイ中に見れる
これ超重要、これのおかげで私のような素人でも自分で考えてビルドを作れる！
ただ一部のパラメータ（Luckなど）は隠されてる、見せてください
ただスキルの説明がよくわからないというのが時々ある

余計な部分をそぎ落として、ノーストレスを目指して要る様に見える
問答無用で名作で楽しい

ただし一部ダンジョンはストレス（砂虫の巣とか）
パズル要素のある崩壊したダンジョンとか
ダンジョンに仕掛けられてる罠は自動探索を妨げるだけできつい
NPC護衛クエストの救出対象NPCが
敵モンスターに突っ込んでいくのが意味不明
Solipsistのアンロックもきつい（難易度の高い運ゲー）
いくつかのきつい部分はMODでなんとかなる

ウィンドウ切替てもバックグラウンドで動き続けるのがつらい
止まって

エキスパンションモード（残機無限）は
タレントのポイントの振り直しができるので
慣れないうちはエキスパンションモードでいいかもしれない
ゾンビ戦法でごり押しできちゃうので死んだら

TOME has a disgustingly huge amount of content, even before you add the expansions.

TOME manages to avoid that feeling for me. There's some light progression systems in class/race unlocks (and at least one item I've found that is a persistent unlock that loads in with new characters after you find it,) that can give you something to strive for in a meta-sense, and while yes, I have been shafted pretty hard by RNG at least once or twice (An enemy in a crypt spawned with 1.5k health, massive resistances, a shield with a large bar that could be cast near back to back for their purposes, a big free heal that had no limit beyond cooldown and a summonable healing pillar... etc.) overall it has a good curve, a lot of pathing options, a lot of character building options, classes that are BOTH fun and feel distinct from one another, writing that's oftentimes really neat if a little sparse at times...

O jogo é bom , é um Roguelike tradicional de turnos , tem poucos elementos sandbox só pra dizer que tem , as classes são bem diversas e diferentes , as raças nao fazem tanta diferença no final , mas no final a classe mais quebrada é o Adventurer 

os mapas são sem segredo , geralmente não faz diferença 
os inimigos são pouco explorados, a não ser que vc esteja na dificuldade nightmare , não vai ter tanta dificuldade , os únicos inimigos que me deram trabalho foram uns dragões que invocam uma copia sua com as mesmas skills e atributos que vc

as batalhas contra boss são até divertidas, geralmente eles tem magia de cura , então vc tem que encaixar uma estratégia pensando nisso , e usar as habilidades de debuffs com cuidado e no momento certo, cada turno importa

o crafting existe , mas não é mt legal , não bem aproveitado , muito limitado
o mesmo da pra dizer dos equipamentos , um equipamento tem milhares de atributos, mas o que vai importar no fim das contas é só uns 3 ou 4 

o sistema de runas é legal , você dropa uma runa que tem uma skill, vc ""implanta"" essa runa no seu corpo e pode usar a skill quando quiser , porem se for colocar outra, vc perde a anterior (da pra ter até 5 diferentes) 

existe vários itens únicos com habilidades ativas , vc não precisa equipar eles, só de ter no inventario ja da pra usar as habilidades deles , embora só uns 2 ou 3 únicos me ajudaram de fato

as quests são legais , e bem simples , geralmente se resumem a buscar algum item , ou matar algum boss, porem as recompensas são horríveis , umas 3 quest me deram pontos de habilidade (que foi o melhor) , mas a lore do jogo é boa!

a DLC dos orcs nao tem nada de novo RELEVANTE , é uma campanha diferente , mapa diferente, mas é tudo igual...mas não quer dizer que seja ruim 

o Sistema de Dungeon infinita é meio sem balanceamento e sem proposito , é meio que um ""desce ae até onde tu aguenta, mas tu vai morrer! , porque sim"" você não ganha nada com isso. 

as lojas dos NPCS só vendem itens inúteis...sério , não usei nada deles , é irrelevante no endgame comprar item TIER 5 ego++ , sendo que vc dropa UNICO TIER 5 à-vontade no endgame

o dinheiro no jogo num serve pra muita coisa, quase nada na verdade , tem uns NPCS que te treinam e liberam skills pra vc , ajuda bastante dependendo a sorte , porem é só. 

o Multiplayer nao devia existir , é simplesmente ruim , assim como as features Online , só atrapalham o jogo
depositei uns itens no ""baú online"" e tenho dificuldade de acessar ele no jogo

o jogo num te permite farmar, então se tu curte grindar level e itens , lascou.

o jogo podia ter um New Game+, é broxante depois que vc chega level máximo e fica com um equipamento descente, nao resta nada pra vc fazer  [spoiler] a nao ser zerar o jogo e sacrificar o personagem na quest final  [/spoiler]

enfim , o jogo podia ser muito melhor aproveitado, vamos ver futuramente como vai ser.
mas se voce ta procurando um roguelike legal , esse daqui é, e vai render varias horas de gameplay e vc vai morrer duns jeitos muito estranho.

Tales of Maj'Eyal is a very cool rogue-like. It doesn't have a lot of complexities that other rogue-likes like Nethack have, there's no need to deal with mechanics like hunger and there's no ""scumming"" - you're not gonna pile up a bunch of items and transmogrify them, or transform yourself into a worm to eat a ring to gain its power. Instead, your power comes from ~skill trees~! It's like an entire RPG over here! There's an impressively large amount of classes and races, and variety even within those classes, that every new character I've tried has felt fresh and for the most part, a lot of fun. The game also has a difficulty mode that gives you a significant amount of extra lives, if permadeath isn't entirely your thing.

If you're interested in summoning swarms of undead, time travel, subjecting your enemies to the horrors of entropy, bare-fisted combo attacks, using the power of hate to curse everything around you, using your massive brain to twist reality, becoming a mage that REALLY likes beam attacks, or being an anti-magical sludge summoner covered in fungus, this is the game for you!",1653936831,1653936831,True,24,1,0.752229690551757813,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's a huge variety of classes/races available, and most classes have gotten at least one overhaul during the game's lifetime, so pretty much everything's playable. Races are a little less so, but not by so much that you can't make do. More recent stuff tends to be more complex and work better - Necromancer got a full overhaul just recently.
Traditional consumables are replaced by cooldown-limited infusions and runes. The space saved in the inventory is replaced by the enormous amounts of trash loot you scoop up. Shops in the game are very important - you can buy access to utility skill-groups, and shops are a reliable source of the cooldown-limited consumables I just mentioned.
The game's Angband roots show in the item system - there are an awful lot of elemental and status resistances to keep track of. Status resistances, in particular, are vital - getting to 100% stun and/or silence immunity is a big breakpoint in QoL for some classes.
Difficulty settings are very important. The default is Adventure mode, which gives you some extra lives based on story progression, which is nice for reasons I will touch on shortly. Then there's Roguelike (perma-death, etc), and after that... well, difficulty settings after that are for people who enjoy pain. Oh, Nightmare isn't quite as hard as you'd think because more and better loot drops, but after that, good luck. I don't think every class has even cleared the top difficulty level yet, it's that rough.
The main reason Adventure mode is the default difficulty is because of rare monsters. The game takes a base monster type, and then slaps one or more classes on it. The higher the difficulty, the more classes get added. As a result, the power of rare and unique monsters varies wildly. Some combinations are actively counterproductive for the monster, others will one-shot your max-level geared-to-the-gills superhero before you even get a chance to read the tooltip. It is customary to screenshot the most ridiculous murdermachine rares you see, to share with your fellows.
I got distracted, bored now. If you like dungeon-crawling with extremely complex and distinct character classes, TOME4 will last you a very, very long time.",1652773172,1652773172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unlike say, Nethack, TOME has far more of a focus on building your character and methodical use of skills and tools, rather than using items. Each class in the game is insanely meaty, containing multiple skill trees that allow you to customize them to your taste. Many classes have mechanics unique to them that make their flow a lot more interesting than just ""cast damage spell, repeat"" - for example, one of my favorites, Necromancer, has various summons that require ""souls"" - a resource unique to them that is gained from absorbing the life force of enemies, as well as a passive that allows them to live even when their health is in the negatives. One of the most interesting classes, Paradox Mage, manipulates a force called ""paradox"" - your abilities get stronger as it increases, but the potential for anomalies that distort you and possibility get you hurt in a crucial situation also increases.

As far as tile-based roguelikes go, the visual polish on this one sticks out too. Your character has a paper doll like visual, so any armor and weapons you pick up actually appear on their graphic. All spells and skills have icons you can discern at a glance. There's various particle effects to indicate sprays of fire, auras, necrotic air, etcetc. It's still basically not animated at all, as other games of its kind are, but it's definitely a lot more pleasant in presentation than the usual ASCII @-sign grid.

The classes, gameplay, and overall polish make for a genuinely enthralling and surprisingly modern experience (as modern as a roguelike can get, anyway).

Don't get me wrong if you enjoy turn based diablo games stuffed with 99% useless loot that you sell, you will enjoy it.  

I also don't reccomend playing anything but exploration mode that gives infinite lives.  Rogue likes are supposed to be fair.  As in if you die it's because of a mistake you made.  This game kills you while lying to you.  going to a zone that says it's a level 30-40 zone, and then opening a door in the dungeon to find level 90 dragons that one shot you?

Yeah that's common in this game.  It's deliberately and goes out of its way to be as unfair and bullkrap as possible.

Again, if you like that kind of thing this is your game, I do not. I beat this game, and in exploration mode only, I died over 100 times.

Love it: A whole lot of different classes / races / skills - tons of variety in character creation / evolution. A huge number of monsters, and excellent procedural generation with many alternate zones (which come with their own boss and mobs) and monsters. I've played the starting zones dozens of times and I still occasionally get a surprise. Lots of random side dungeons with their own little quest / lore. Writing is good, some stuff is really wholesome / funny like the Trollish poem ""I like to club"". It's about how this troll likes to club various things to eat. Big world - I thought the game was the first 2 sets of dungeons - lmao, that's more of a prologue. You're not finishing a run in one session (unless you die). If you play on Roguelike difficulty (ie no respawns whatsoever unless you find ... 1 of 2 very rare consumables) even normal difficulty is quite hard if you aren't using an optimized build. I'm probably not doing it justice - it's a great game though.

Stuff I dislike: Sometimes it just feels like the game decides it's time for you to die and, well, get fucked. You very rarely run into truly IMPOSSIBLY situations, but like, once in a long while you'll open a chest in a level 10 area and a level 25 slime'll pop out and be like SUP BITCH!? So, not all deaths feel great. A small complaint which is common among roguelikes and this is no different; You'll rarely find anything useful in shops, so outside of a few quest interactions I've come across gold feels pretty useless. On the bright side, the game does a great job of bulk selling all your junk so at least its not a time consuming process.

One quick tip for anyone thinking of buying ToME - If you don't like the graphics, try using the Sharpen feature in the options. Honestly, I hate to say it, but the visuals really put me off at first - it felt muddled and it was hard to tell what was what. Once I found that feature though, I started finding the game actually quite pretty. Personally, I really like 6-7 sharpness, so give that a try. It's all personal preference, but it can make a HUGE difference in how the game presents and a big QoL improvement imo.

Перво наперво скажу, что в игру можно поиграть совершенно бесплатно! Ты можешь прямо сейчас зайти на сайт игры, скачать её и опробовать. А после уже решить стоит ли брать её или нет. За покупку тебе всего лишь дадут один уникальный игровой класс (который с выходом новых длс можешь измениться, такое уже случалось).


Русский язык отсутствует, но энтузиасты уже перевели игру и все длс к ней. Русификатор можно сказать в мастерской стима, или на сайте разработчика.

А теперь можно поговорить об игры, Tales of Maj'Eyal - игра жанра рогалик, а значит тебе мой дорогой друг придётся умирать, умирать, и ещё раз умирать. Тебе придётся умереть более сотни раз, чтобы понять, что твой билд на варвара сосёт, и надо попробовать что-то другое.
В игра КРАЙНЕ много классов персонажа, некоторые отличаются не сильно, например плут и ночной клинок. Но у некоторых есть настолько уникальные механики, что голова разболится от запоминания всего, что они умеют. 
Вещи дропаются по системе суффиксов. Но есть уникальные вещи, которые всегда будут иметь одинаковые статы, так сказать ""Именные вещи""

Метапрогрессия ""Практически"" отсутствует. Тебе не надо покупать какие то улучшения между своими забегами, но есть пара вещей которые обязательно надо сделать, чтобы разблокировать некоторые улучшения. Например выполнить секрет квест, чтобы разблокировать ветку ядов для плутов. 

Боссы - Большая часть боссов из забега в забег будут одинаковы. Например в лабиринте минотавра в 90% шансом будет именно минотавр. И зная его сильные и слабые стороны, ты всегда можешь подготовиться к боссу. И так с любой локацией.

Что касается длс, можно ли играть без них? Ответ да. Длс несут лишь дополнительный контент, однако я крайне рекомендую их купить, пройдёмся кратко по ним.

Пепел Урхрока - Длс добавляет 4 новых класса и 1 новую расу, кучу предметов, и целый ад! Рекомендую купить если хочется разнообразить свои забеги.
Забытые культы - Если вы любите Лавкрафтовскую неведомую хрень смело брать, 3(4) новых класса с уникальными механиками. Новые локации, и самое главное неведомая хрень!
Ярость Эмбера - Рекомендуется покупать если вы прошли игру хотя бы один раз. Длс добавляет целую БОЛЬШУЮ новую компанию, действие которой происходит после финала игры. Добавляет 4 уникальных класса которые значительно отличаются от того, что было раньше. И несколько новых рас. Берите!

Надеюсь тебе понравится игра мой друг, я крайне её рекомендую. Просто пройти порог вхождения!

El referente del género para todos los que quieran probarlo. Tiene una cantidad de personajes, combinaciones, clases, profesiones, habilidades, hechizos, objetos, armas, etc... IMPRESIONANTE. Es a efectos prácticos un juego infinito a pesar de no serlo por diseño pero tiene tantísimo contenido y tan variado que yo creo que nunca podré ver todo el potencial del juego por muchas horas que le dedique.

Tiene una historia fija con puntos fijos como las localizaciones (aunque algunas son aleatorias) pero lejos de eso cada zona dentro de las localizaciones de mundo son aleatorias. Es un juego muy, pero que muy retante. Verdaderamente difícil si quieres pasártelo entero en dificultad roguelike (mueres y se borra tu personaje), por lo que recomiendo encarecidamente que se juegue en modo aventura que te permite morir un par de veces pudiendo revivir. Así tomarás conciencia de que te puede matar con solo verte mientras que el modo entrenamiento que te permite revivir infinitamente lo pondría solo si quieres ver el final de la historia si todavía no eres muy bueno en el juego pero de esta forma el juego pierde mucha emoción ya que el miedo a la muerte es lo que hace que sea una verdadera aventura y no un paseo.

Es de mis roguelikes favoritos y todavía no le he dedicado ni la mitad de las horas que quiero echarle pero sentía la necesidad de expresar con los demás que este es un gran juego y si os gusta el género es un juego que debéis comprar si o si. Realmente podéis jugarlo de forma gratuita en la página web pero este juego tiene tanto trabajo y amor a lo largo de todos los años de desarrollo que tiene que me sentiría mal si no le diese dinero al creador, lo merece y con creces.

Been playing these two classes. Possesser. Whom uses capsure bodies to buff them self greatly. Like i managed to steal boss bodies and use them kill 10x stronger enemy´s to steal their bodies become immortal! untill cunt of 40 level shooter enemy one hit kills me........

Then one demonic type i don´t recall its whole name. But you can use magic and strong close combat abilities to handle eneme´s like passives what give fire dmg AoE on melee.

Jogo há mais de 10 anos, fora da Steam, e considero o TOME4 o melhor roguelike dos últimos 20 anos. Tem a melhor interface, mecânicas interessantes (algumas são chatas), o auto-explorer é o melhor do gênero, excelentes addons do workshop e até a música é boa. As conquistas são muito bacanas, muitas delas verdadeiramente inesperadas.

Minha crítica é que o jogo tem alguns chefes bem difíceis em relação a outros roguelikes, e a história do jogo é bem longa, além de ser um pouco ""grind"" em alguns momentos. Porém o jogo tem um ""quality of life"" muito acima da média, então o player não se sente ""explorado"" pelo jogo. 

Recomendo jogar no modo ""Exploração"", pois o jogo é cruel com novos jogadores e a morte permanente, depois de horas de jogo, pode ser muito frustrante, especialmente para jogadores mais casuais.

RNG can be a massive asshole and the reliance on excort quests with *impossibly* brain-dead AI that will walk straight up to a group of monsters -- even if it means walking away from you while your stuck in a different fight -- but that's more a minor nuisance than any kind of deal-breaker.

*However,* FUCK this game with permadeath. There's nothing so infuriating as putting 7 hours into a character only to stumble on a dreaming horror (also, whoever designed *that* thing deserves to be punched directly in the dick) so you get to spend the next 10 minutes rapidly clicking through the *many* turns you spend asleep until eventually it wears you down and kills you because it can teleport faster than you can run away even with a speed boost. Or putting 4 hours in, only to randomly come across a unique enemy that's a full 10 levels above the area's supposed cap and his entourage and *instantly* die.

I tried permadeath because it's what the devs intended, and while the first character I lost was wholly on me, the next 2 were down completely to random, *enormous* difficulty spikes that whittled away my extra lives until I lost all progress. I don't understand how anyone can prefer losing progress like that, it's so disrespectful of your time.

Luckily, there's a permadeath-free Exploration mode, which while it will keep you from unlocking certain things that are tied to achievements, is just a *much* better experience that completely fixes the only glaring issue I have with the game.",1645382013,1645382013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you like open world RPGs with permadeath, this is for you. It's a true roguelike, with lots of stat & build nerding, lots of exploration & routing, and lots of dying & trying again—But when you get ""the run"" it feels amazing and can last dozens of hours. 

The game is fairly consistent between runs, but mixes some randomness in drops and enemies, always allowing you to iterate on your build but keeping some of the nuance fresh based on what you stumble upon. There is a staggering amount of content, I've around 150 total hours in the game (steam hour count is inaccurate as I played standalone for awhile), and I've barely scratched the surface. The more I play, the more hooked I get... It's a bit of a slow burn, but once it clicks, you won't be able to stop. 

I recommend starting on Nightmare difficulty with Roguelike mode on, playing blind. It requires dedicating some time to really sitting down and understanding what's in front of you; read all your stats, skills, infusions, and inspect the monsters you come across. Personally I started to make progress once I started keeping notes about the dungeons & my progression paths; you can look up guides I guess, but it's the type of game where guides will only get you so far, the sheer amount of freedom and customization means builds and progression can really be tailored to you. I think if you look up guides you'll be a much worse player. The only thing I'd really recommend looking up are the classes and how to unlock them, I found the game to be a bit of a slog before I finally got muh Archmage.

At first you'll die in the first couple dungeons you come across a lot, don't feel discouraged, just keep learning. Your runs will slowly go from lasting 20-30 minutes, to an hour, to a couple hours, and so on... you'll find the gameplay loop really teaches you about the world and you'll start naturally refining/optimizing your build to adjust to whatever gave you trouble last. It's the ideal open world roguelike loop with enough RPG mechanics to keep you entertained for a long while.

Don't put too much emphasis on quests or else you'll have a bad time, just explore the world and get stronger, quests take a backseat to exploration here. You'll know when you feel ready to do your main quest, and it certainly isn't right as you spawn in; find dungeons, get levels, obtain gear. Focus on survival and information, then mix in more damage as you can. You'll make progress and optimize your power soon enough.

The workshop also has some nice mods, in particular the ""ZOmnibus Addon Pack"" is probably worth picking up right off the bat. The graphics are a turn off for some, but once you get in game, it isn't really a problem. Especially if you use a custom character tile that you like. Not to mention the client feels good to use, anywhere the visuals don't feel up to par, you'll find the technical competency in the client offsets it. It's also fully customizable, there are people who have modded the game with RPG Maker tilesets and stuff, but I dunno, I think the base graphics are perfectly fine. But, probably turn the music off after a couple hours and put on your own stuff else that'll get tedious.

There's too much to say about this beastly game in a short steam review. But if the keywords ""challenging, deep, open world, RPG, customizable"" are ones that get you excited, then just go in right now, you won't regret it.",1643849921,1643948685,True,19,1,0.687671661376953125,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The worst part about this game is the first thing you'll see and the one you should ignore:  static art.

This game is detailed, offers a very large amount of ways to play which are enjoyable and different, and has a lot of depth.

If you like more traditional roguelikes, you absolutely will enjoy this game.  Even if you generally prefer NetHack-like games with traditional ASCII-console graphics, TOME doesn't suffer from the common issue many GUI roguelikes suffer from, in which items or monsters tend to look too similar.  Play different combinations of character races and classes and you'll open up new content.

But, to reiterate, the big art in particular is some of the most atrocious I have seen in any game, particularly in a game I enjoy as much as TOME.  I'm sorry for being so harsh here, but it's something everyone sees and presumes means the game is amateurish, and it simply isn't.

When the game has this much depth, several ways of playing each class, levelling up feels meaningful and so does items, stats and skills - you're set for having fun. I don't remember a game coming close to this level of replayability and character development.

It can also appeal to non roguelike fans since it adds more or even full forgiveness, has simplified mechanics (no time demanding and/or gimmicky stuff from traditional roguelikes) with a higher focus on developing your character through fighting.

You can try it for free (the base game is free and can be downloaded at the official page, what you get here are the features that donators get) but i'd highly recommend you to snatch it with all DLCs whenever they get on sale.

You get your randomly generated items, colour-coded for your collecting convenience, you get lots and lots of abilities, spells and other gubbins, and there's of course an endless horde of monsters to kill. It is of course, turn based, and uses sprites, so a lot of the meaty details is given through text, or the sound effects/visual effects. I'd put it's graphics quality on-par with an early 2000's flash game, but let's face it, that's not what these games are about.

The game has some interesting classes in the game, which you have to unlock. There's something for just about everyone when you have unlocked several classes. That said, I would recommend going into this game without any information, and just go where the game takes you. You'll unlock more stuff along the way. 

The story of the game is wild, and you can spend a lot of time reading lore and journal entries, talking with NPCs and inspecting items. I've barely touched on a portion of this with 14 hours of play time.

One thing I cannot personally recommend, however, is playing the game 'as recommended', i.e. with Permadeath on. Now, I am no stranger to permadeath games, however this game does like to spring some 'funny surprises' from time to time. And some randomness keeps you on your toes, but believe me when I say that you can, and will, walk down a corridor and straight into the teeth of a boss-level 'random' enemy who'll one-shot you before you can even realise what's happened. If you like your games with extra CBT, by all means keep it on, but unfortunately, that's just not for me.

Overall, if you are really enthused by what you've seen and read, by all means go ahead, but if you have any doubts, but it on sale. It usually has big discounts during the seasonal sales, so pick it up there. I believe the game is still getting updates too, so there are potentially other things to look forward to in the future.",1639523130,1639523130,True,3,1,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a traditional roguelike that will take a lot of hours and time and practice to win with any sort of regularity.  

That said, the effort is worth the pain.  The lore and story are entertaining and engaging, and the number of different unlockable races and classes with very different playstyles will keep you occupied for a while.  Sometimes your runs will or won't have certain areas, or if you're online, you may be blessed with a special level, such as a Bearscape.

Also, there are decent mods that make the game more accessible with or without changing the difficulty.  Fan made races and classes add even more life into the game.  Some are just QOL changes, like easier to read item stats, the ability to add notes to items, or plan your build.  Others are intentionally ""cheating"" to various degrees like giving you a precious few extra skill points at early levels or increasing the number of items in shops.  You could go further, and use mods that make your skill levels multiply more, or allow you to take negative points to get every skill available.  What's great about doing that is you're only improving your chances, not guaranteeing a win.  My most ""cheaty"" character still managed to die to one of the bosses (admittedly, at the time I didn't know what I was doing, and faced a lightning boss with no lightning resistance whatsoever).

Also, I have borrowed enemies from this game for my tabletop RPG.  My players now know the fear of opening a pit of Gunsnakes.  They'll never trust the forest at night again after being awoken by a [b]Grizzly Bear Sawbutcher[/b] (that is a giant bear wielding a spinning power saw in each paw).

* A LOT of powerful items
* Nice story 
* Maus and keyboard controls equaly well implemented
* Shortcuts and automatization for some tasks

Weaknesses:

One of the best features is the full keyboard support. While the mouse is supported, it's (almost?) possible to play the entire game without taking your hands off the keyboard.

There are two downsides to note:

 (1) The balance has a lot of room for improvement. Every class and ability should contribute to a viable build. The underlying ideas are great, but some of the numbers need to be adjusted to make them viable. The lack of balance means that restarting a character after death becomes repetitive. I may have preferred to restart the same class but try a different build on the next run, but when that's not viable, it really lowers replayability.

 (2) There are times you hit a wall and encounter a randomly-generated enemy that is simply too difficult for your build. In this situation, you really need to be able to backtrack, gain 5-10 levels and perhaps alter your gear in order to proceed. However, the ""no-grind"" design of the game means that previously-cleared areas remain cleared. You can run into a situation where there isn't enough left of an appropriate level to proceed. I think you should be able to re-populate areas when needed.

Note that there are game mods available in the Workshop intended to address such problems.",1638868339,1638870703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First off, it's not a very good rogue-like specifically. Going through the story is way too long for that and there is pretty much no variation in the quests outside of some choices you can make.

What makes the game fun, it's the depth of the mechanic, trying different classes, finding unique items and skills and taking the right decisions to survive tough fights.

It's not perfect but it's specialised in what it's doing well.

A few tips.
If you try it, be sure to abuse the ""auto-explore"" key to save time.
If you want to achievement hunt the game, you'll need to go to their website to unlock achievements on lower difficulties which is a little annoying.

I have countless games in steam library, both classic and modern roguelikes, and none of them comes close to Tales of May'eyal. Compared to TOME, every other roguelike becomes boring relatively quickly. It is because TOME cobines sollutions of every roguelike that was before it and gives much much more. It is the true feeling of adventure that made it so special for me - every run is a long trip, with good mix of what is random and what is known, it lets you observe, prepare and be terrified of circumstances You are not ready for yet. SOme of TOMEs unique trade cards :

1. No other roguelike has such vast and immense character customization. Experience dependent growth is not linear, it is like in follout2 intensified - there are stats every level, class/race skills not every level, skill category unlocks about every 10 levels, game changing perk about every 25 levels and so on. But most interesting about character customization is that a lot of it comes from game events and decisions ! Saving random hostages may give you category of skills outside of your class, You can choose faction that makes You  abandon magic and unlock antimagic, there are countless of passives and actives in items, You can encrypt skin with skill containing runes and so on. 
2. TOME has a different way of handling difficulty curve. It is some boring game design scheme, that difficulty should be linear or parabollic. In TOME difficulty curve goes up parabolically, but it is inconsistent and fluid along the way - there are times it goes ridicolously high for no reason terrorizing You, in other times challenge becomes too easy for a chapter, so You can take a breath, but than it goes up and down again. This is the reason why this game brings such a vibe of real adventure.
3. This game is absolutely most tactical of all RPG roguelikes out there. Just check random screen from gameplay and notice amount of active skills in UI. Even when You plas as some brute dumb warrior You end up using 20-30 skills frequently, while other classes have serious problems with menaging shortcuts and icons for all their skills ( which they actually use every now and then ). It is typical behavior in game, to meet elite in place You did not expect to, swap equipment in battle, and need to use another set of skills to survive.

I am 31.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game too many times, or play nearly as long as some of you. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Нет многих фирменных возможностей старых рогаликов по взаимодействию с окружениям (без которых для меня рогалик - не торт...), например, поиска скрытых дверей, окунание предметов в зелья (+отравленные стрелы, освящение предметов или их превращение за счет магии зелья), поедание добычи (тел противников) и сам менеджмент еды в походе, религия и прочие нюансы ""старой школы"", которые все вместе делали классические рогалики глубже по механикам, чем современный tome. Сама по себе идея, что можно кликнуть по врагу и получить все его статы, для рогалика смотрится странно (для именно классического рогалика), вся суть челленджа теперь сводится к оценке статусов врага и подбора ""ключика"" под эти статусы, в то время как в классическо рогалике основная опасность в том, что большинство свойств противников скрыты и их нужно выяснять разведкой боем на собственном опыте. 

Нынешний Tome нарочито пытается занять нишу альтернативы АДОМу и Нетхаку, чтобы собрать современных игроков, привычных к Диабле, но якобы желающих опыта ружлайк-рпг старой школы.

It claims to support the poor, handicapped Mac users and me, a very averagely handicapped Mac user myself, decided to believe it and bought it on a whim. 
After starting, I noticed it decided to hard-lock me into a full screen that I could not exit from by any means other than throwing my MacBook into the sun. 
After reinstalling it on my backup laptop, I decided to try the natural thing, namely enter options and change the video mode from fullscreen to windowed. This worked like a charm to shut the game down, and it even gave me a bilateral auricular hemorrhage as the pleasantly medieval background music began to stutter exactly on the drum's bang, turning into a high-voltage power drill for a solid minute or more. I don't actually know, as the paratroops had to evacuate my unconscious body from what they thought was the entrance to Tartarus. 

After my full recovery, I gave it yet another chance and rebooted the game, only to notice that it wouldn't be displayed at all. 
See, there's a practical feature called ""minimize"" for Mac, which minimizes whatever it is you desire to minimize. Only if I entered a certain display mode that summarizes all active programs and gives a little preview of them could I actually confirm that the game was opened. 

I tried navigating the settings via my keyboard, blindly that is, entering said display mode every couple seconds, frantically, like an opossum on LSD, to check what was going on. But it turns out that the game actually requires a mouse input to change the resolution back to full-screen. And good luck navigating something you can't see with your mouse where every click will, instead, be registered outside the program and redirect me to my desktop. It lastly was stuck on a 500% zoom onto the majestic outline of a pixel of grass, which made navigation even more pleasant as I now had to channel my instincts and rely on educated guesses solely. What a gamedesign!

After having scoured the internet (briefly, I must admit), I concluded that maybe if I reinstalled I would be able to crack this nut. But no luck there. So I went into my steam folders and deleted TME altogether, but it turns out that the devs already anticipated cheeky brats like myself and made sure that my settings would be stored in the cloud, so that I would never have to reconfigure anything twice. God bless 'em. 
Never have I seen a better implementation of successful gatekeeping! Chapeaus. 

I will try to run it on an old windows laptop at one point to see wether it manages to brick it, too. So far, however, the gameplay of navigating a minefield blindly was very entertaining.",1634745993,1634745993,True,1,6,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There is also really well written and engaging lore for some reason.  Did I mention that it's still in active development and the trailer is super outdated?  

Death is a part of the game, and it can be frustrating, especially if you are new and don't know what you did wrong (which is why I suggest Adventure made since it gives you a few lives).  However, looking at the action log, figuring out what killed you, and coming up with a counter measure is how you improve.  Did you get overwhelmed by negative statuses?  Where you unable to heal fast enough while getting chunked for half your health?  Did you get oneshot by a crit?

射手给予了他最坚定的反驳

从南方大陆来了个斗士
宣称其有万夫不当之勇
斩巨龙之首如探囊取物

他说自己曾到了一个陌生的遗迹
遗迹里有一只黑山老妖
妖怪万年的疯狂,憎恨与暴走
在勇士的剑锋上划下了句号

能媲美最古老的巨龙
见到一个人能如此的强大
简直能让一个帝国也惭愧汗颜

一文不名的他
一跳,一闪之间只用了一把隐藏的匕首
就让三名英雄都感觉到一阵的剧痛

射手倒下了，连弓都没来得及拉开
斗士也步了其后尘
法师发现他中的毒

- 后期关卡（兵营、巅峰）流程较为单调乏味，这也与角色逐渐成型停止升级成长有关。
- 部分职业技能与金色道具尚欠缺打磨。金色道具作为固定效果的稀有物品，理应更加有趣实用。
- 剧情演出相当薄弱，主要靠对白支撑（时限逃难与陷入梦境等桥段除外）。
- 对白文学性非常弱：在内涵上无法与某些经典 CRPG 相提并论的同时，趣味性与真实感也差了不止一筹。作为主要内容的「战斗与剧情」，如今只剩下了「战斗」。耽误了好的剧本构思。
- 作为柏林准则模板，缺乏 Roguelike 所倡导理念中的世界互动部分。
[h1]评测，抑或情书[/h1]
　　做好考古翻车的心理准备，我打开了这款画风古早的半回合制游戏。（其实我对画质需求一点也不苛刻，更何况这是回合制游戏。但后来我才知道这游戏的早期版本是 ASCII 字符集画风的，那我还真不一定顶得住！）
　　咳咳，自然，出师不利：[b]骷髅弓箭手[/b]暴毙在了初始地城；[b]夺心魔（Kiri）召唤师[/b]死在第二个洞窟里。
　　但[b]死灵师（Necromancer）[/b]终于还是让我爱上了这款游戏。
　　第一次打到军营、第一次通关 Normal 难度——再到攻克 Insane，再加上 Roguelike 模式、再加上 Bikini 成就挑战……我像初生牛犊一般谨慎地探索着埃亚尔大陆，在这片趣味盎然的奇幻世界中踏遍了身影。
　　我记得自己击败了水下遗迹的超强触手怪[spoiler]其实是古神[/spoiler]，夺得夏·图尔堡垒来充当自己的据点。看着弹出的成就窗口上写着 ""[i]Home, sweet home[/i]""，我怔怔地想着自己有家了呀。
　　我记得自己上传到官网的角色。角色数据中赫然写着它觉醒成为了巫妖（Lich），终于得以窥见死艺的终极奥秘。很可惜这个存档死于兽人军营领袖・大法师沃尔，而且自动上传官网时出了 Bug 而同步出错了。但那份欣喜与兴奋我还记得！
　　我记得自己误入邪教地窖，悟打误撞地上演了一出英雄救美的戏码。我遵照指令来逐步操作，心里却不大情愿地担忧着属于巫妖的深沉生活就此告终，结果发生一件意想不到的转机——我才想起来曾经戴上过那件奇怪的项圈，后来好像发生了诡异的变化。于是我心满意足地转头[spoiler]把猫也吃了[/spoiler]。
　　我记得……太多了，真的。新鲜惊奇、秒趣横生的回忆太多太多，在刹那间纷至沓来，让我不禁一怔。如果说克服困难的成就感是我意料之中的，那沉浸扮演的代入感绝对是意外之喜了。我想，这样好的游戏，总会成为我最宝贵的回忆的。

I'm a big fan of traditional roguelikes and have played many of the major ones. This is yet another addition to my ""major-roguelike-I've managed-to-dig-into"" list. My 'roguelike resume' improves and so does my street cred! Woohoo! So let's get started.

Backstory: I still remember playing the old tome (called Tales of Middle Earth), only a variant of Angband at the time. To me, it was this lore-rich and heavily tactical variant which wasn't fully complete. Yet it was awesome and playable. That was my initial push to try TOME. I did not give it much time then and it was a completely different game to the old tome. I could only give it my undivided attention a few months ago.

TLDR: [i][b] The most tactical traditional roguelike I've ever played. Very accessible due to its range of difficulties. The difficulty takes time to show itself. At one point, I asked myself ""If I feel it's so easy and my previous death was a stupid one, then why don't I pass it in my next run?"" And Baam! I clocked my current playtime and it's reached the exact hours of another game I played the most, which is ADOM, at the time of writing. A nice coincidence.  [/b][/i]


[b]Pros: [/b]
Extremely good tactical gameplay - The few major classes all feel unique. They can suit different playstyles. I've never seen this level of intricate mechanics before! (the last game which comes to mind would be DCSS). Each of those classes felt balanced and not too overpowered or underpowered, they all had their thrills when playing them. Some I took time and enjoyed that process of figuring out the strategy to play them myself.  I either did not try enough or like the other more ""niche"" classes or races the game offered, quite a few were left to unlock by me. It feels some of them could do with more improvement. But hey, four major classes from the usual backgrounds (archer, warrior, mage and rogue) sold me, what more can you ask for or expect. Anything else would be a bonus.
Nice lore, plot and good writing - The story got to me even though it was slow-paced. It does not have the ""reach-this-level-and-kill-the-nemesis"" objective shown instantly at the beginning of most traditional RLs. The narrative only gets trajectory after decent progress (without revealing spoilers).  It is a big task to get the attention of a player, especially when we're used to all these RPG story cliches and motifs. I would say it does it well. I further commend its good writing, some suspense and even humour at places.
Unlockables: A lot of classes/races can only be unlocked via progress of some kind. I never played an RL with this feature before and liked the experience. The thrill of finding out you unlocked something by making a specific choice/exploration/trying something different or thanks to sheer progress felt quite good. Also my curiosity on wondering how to unlock the remaining. Any stone left to unturn. More replayability value.
Accessibility/Ease: In general, I can say I got on board without much help and refrained from using spoilers of any kind (A personal quirk I like to appreciate in any RL). It has a high degree of difficulty ranges and permadeath is an option. It is very accessible to players new to the genre. For players used to traditional RLs, I recommend the permadeath option and the highest available difficulty (remaining are locked).

[b]Neutral: [/b]
Difficulty - Moderate. By this I mean, per the usual classic roguelike ""harsh"" standards, I'll give Tales of Maj'Eyal a moderate rating. Its difficulty too takes time to gain traction and isn't outright ""harsh"" like most other RLs. Its ""spiritual predecessor"" Angband is what I compare its difficulty to, but still easier. Just like how Angband lacks any harsh events, ruthless monsters or weak classes but rather has a slow but persistent difficulty. Deaths usually occur towards mid or late game once you learn the ropes and your characters tend to last long and die less frequent. Deaths and retries are proportionally lesser so it balances out. At one point, I asked myself ""If I feel it's so easy and my previous death was a stupid one, then why don't I pass it in my next run?"" And Baam! I clocked my current playtime and it's reached the exact hours of another game I played the most, which is ADOM, at the time of writing. Pure coincidence indeed.  I still can't pass the darn game though.
Online: This was interesting. The game optionally requires you to be online. You can still play offline and miss only some minor features. It keeps the records of your character highscores and deaths via your registered account, unlike other games. It also has an in-game log of all the players and what achievement/milestone/death they just faced. Knowing where you stand or seeing someone do some achievement you've yet to discover felt cool. All in all, this was really was a curiously fun experience

[b]Cons: [/b]
Technical glitches: The only con I feel which deserves to be considered non-trivial. I did encounter a major bug here and there, it's a work-in-progress and it did fix itself in another release. However, I faced another issue that acted like a killjoy in this party of mine. I lost my character saved game twice, once while migrating to another PC. Steam cloud didn't do its job. Without getting into the details of the other, this experience was enough for me to list this as my only negative gaming experience.
(minor) Layout/UI: Due to its vast amounts of abilities and information, especially as you level up, it becomes hard to manage all the various windows. However, it is entirely customisable and within some time I found my preferred layout after resizing and repositioning. Minor quibble since the user has to figure this out on their own and the default layout doesn't quite cut it once the characters are mid-level and greater.
(minor) Gameplay mechanics jargon: While I did mention that I didn't need to consult online help and the game provided enough information. Later on, I couldn't find the meaning of some game terms on my own and had to look them up online. Though again, they were simple enough to understand and it just took seconds.",1633842265,1633842265,True,10,0,0.583547294139862061,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game isn't all bad, even though you might think that from my first paragraph and my score - the game is 95+% positive on Steam at the end of the day, so people obviously like it.

I'll just do a short summary of some pros and some major cons that I found in my 100ish hours on steam (and probably 20ish more on the free version from the game's website).

[b] Pros: [/b]

- [b] Massive amounts of content and variety [/b] - the amount of classes and races that can be unlocked and played are astounding and really just outright impressive and the constant updates and expansions make this game just ridiculously packed with stuff.

- [b] Potentially huge replayability [/b] (the reason i say potentially will be explained in the cons section) - this is basically because of the previous point and because of the way gear and builds are constructed (much more similar to ARPGs like Diablo, PoE and Grim Dawn than to roguelikes).

- [b] Many, many stats are just laid out for the player to see and use [/b] - for every enemy you encounter TOME will give you the exact description of everything that enemy can do and every single offensive and defensive stat it has.

- [b] Great community and developers [/b] - Darkgod (the main dev) is a friendly fellow, the community will help you out when you need it and overall the atmosphere in the in-game chat is always nice and helpful.

- [b] Streamlined roguelike mechanics [/b] - what I mean by this is TOME either gets rid of some potentially annoying roguelike mechanics from ye old days (for example an optional non-permadeath mode for people just learning the game, removal of food mechanics that can be tedious...) making it easier to pick it up as a newcomer to the genre.

- [b] Lore [/b] - like, there's a lot of lore and not only that but it's quite charming and fun to read and collect from letters, statues, books etc. It's mostly lighthearted with some dark moments plopped in here and there.


[b] Cons [/b] - now just to preface this, I'm [b] not gonna mention the obvious indie game cons [/b] (the poor sound fx, average to dull looking graphics, somewhat clunky UI), they're just part of the charm when playing these games and really are to be expected from small indie teams that focus more on gameplay and content.

- [b] Monster RNG [/b] - this is by far the biggest and most annoying problem. Sometimes just no matter how lucky or unlucky you get with finding gear, no matter how carefully you plan your every move, every attack, every movement skill and infusion, you are sometimes gonna run into that one randomly generated rare monster that is [b] faster than you, stronger than you, is a caster and possesses multiple class abilities [/b] - this can even happen in the early game (first 30 minutes) while your build hasn't even started to take shape, making this a huge pain in the ass - [b] this con is the one that broke my will to play the game, I can't stand just seeing a rare monster at the edge of my screen, and the next 3 turns being my health dropping by 25% per turn [/b]. The rares need to be more manually fine-tuned to not allow for some godlike super-melee-ranged caster movement speed god to spawn when i open a random door.

- [b] Some skills that you can spec into seem like noob-traps, while others seem mandatory [/b] - if you're playing a rogue and you don't pick up tumble I can't see you running away from any dangerous situation ever (hell, even with tumble + disengage + rune of tp I sometimes couldn't outrun ghost-rares that walk through walls). When talking about class variety class balance is of utmost importance - most of the skills need to be viable and none should be 100% mandatory (in a perfect world, of course) for finishing the game on normal setting. Everyone has different opinions on this one, so I understand if others don't think like me and think more in the lines of ""duh of course you should take mobility skills as a squishy melee class, it's so obvious"" - [b] if it's mandatory, then it should be auto-given to everyone, not represented as a choice. [/b]

- [b] There isn't that much randomization world-wise for a roguelike [/b] - sure, items are totally random, as are rare enemies, but when you make a new character you're gonna be auto-piloting the first 30 minutes because you'll be running the same easy-as-hell early game dungeons until your build actually gets going. There's nothing to keep you engaged during these first few zones - they're too easy and they're not randomized almost (there are some with multiple possible bosses and layouts) at all, apart from minor layout changes.

- [b] The combat is too easy and brainless 90% of the time [/b] - the challenge in TOME doesn't come from normal white-tier monsters - the challenge comes from random rares that can be super-easy or super-hard and from bosses (well, mid and late game bosses at least). That means that when going trough zones (especially the early game dungeons - like level 1-20 ones) you're just gonna be on autopilot killing trash mobs while waiting for something challenging - this eases you into a false sense of security, and when that challenging fight comes your brain will be so invested in killing trash mobs that it won't even notice that you're dying until it's too late. [b] The game just requires attention, but it isn't able to stimulate that attention in the player because it's doing something entirely opposite - shutting the brain down with hundreds of easy trash mobs [/b].

- [b] The game is too trial and error based [/b] - This is a consequence of the game not giving the player enough information so the player can know if they are strong or not (combine this with the previous con and you've got yourself a ""feeling godlike but dying randomly in one hit out of nowhere"" situation - You wanna know if you character can clear Dreadfell? Well... Uh... Go into Dreadfell and if you die the answer is no, and if you live the answer is yes... I guess. After 100 hours i can still barely tell if my shitty character can kill the master in 2 crits or if I'm gonna kite him and his minions around the dungeon for 10 minutes and die to a plague at the end of that without killing the boss once.

- [b] The game is sometimes far to oldschool for it to feel comfortable [/b] - look, I'm a boomer in gaming, I like my OG Dooms, Quake 1, Shadow Warrior Classic, Old Total War games, Old Crash Bandicoot games, Diablo 2... But seriously sometimes the lack of direction/tips/tutorials, anything, is just weird. Like I'm not even asking for fully fledged-out tutorials, but at least, for example, give me a proper warning when opening dangerous rooms (instead of a warning the game literally says ""do you want to open a door?""), or have some npc adventurer tell me there are some other dungeons in the world i should go check out to become stronger (took me 50 hours to find out there are more than 2 beginner dungeons and more than 4 tier 2 dungeons on the map that never get mentioned by town-npcs) or teach me about debuffs and CC - all these systems are just pure trial and error, as in you have to teach yourself to use them cause the game sure as hell won't.

Like I said I won't be putting UI, sound design, graphics etc. into the cons sections since this is a labor of love indie game, but I'll just quickly say that the UI isn't too terrible - it's sometimes clunky and too secretive tho.

This game has good dedication and love pored into it, but it just never clicked with me since I prefer other ways to challenge players. All in all TOME isn't for everyone.

It satisfies some weird caveman part of my brain that likes pretty colors. Every time I level up (with the Adventurer class), I can spec into a new part of the game, and it adds another pretty bar to my UI. I have a health bar, a mana bar, a stamina bar, a VIM bar, a vigor bar, a light bar, a shadow bar, a corruption bar, a temporal anomaly bar - and these systems actually synergize and work together. The absolute mad lad devs are randomly adding new unexpected content, and updating past content to make sure old classes and systems work with new classes and systems in an interesting way.

Most of the starter classes are weird, ( DO NOT PLAY POSSESSOR, WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. ) but you'll unlock the classes and races along the way.

you're deliberately started with some of the more approachable classes (plus the doombringer, two tinker classes, and writhing one, if you've bought the DLC) and eased into the engagement of mechanics in the game. the more you die, the more you get on what works with what you did and what doesn't. the further you get, the more classes and races you can unlock.

as you push the brink of your progress, you'll be going from playing simple human berserkers and magic-elf alchemists to insane things, like a tiny fuzzy humanoid creature that can evade being hurt by simply dismissing it from their mind, or a gigantic rune-infused ogre capable of delivering devastating blows in concert with a variety of evil spells powered by stolen life force.

tome really pushes its inspirations to new ideas very well, adding all sorts of weird and interesting ideas to the well-established fantasy genre. this is not to even mention the tons of interesting little stories, lore, and vignettes scattered throughout the world, waiting for someone to find them.

Plenty of classes and jobs in a system that promotes many tries and exploring the gamestyle that you want to play, I have to recommend this game to anyone who has ever gotten a little too into a good game of DnDs class systems. Fair warning to not get disheartened and to read the tooltips on quick movements to make sure that when you have the systems down that you can move around quicker. A solid and simple game that is easy to get into but difficult to master.

Every single class is unique enough to be worth playing.
Even I, someone who basically only plays the simplest melee builds in most other RPGs, enjoy playing mages and archers and all the unique classes ToME has to offer. Among others, there are: A nature ""mage"" who spawns slimes for defense and offense and surrounds himself with mucus and moss; a sleeping psychic, who uses his mind powers to damage and debuff enemies and manifests sleeping enemies' nightmares; and an otherworldly warrior with a tentacle arm that can summon other horrors and has a lot of nasty abilities. 
In addition, the dangerous enemies usually have the same abilities as the player can have, so playing different classes also teaches you about what the enemies can do.

Every single class has a fun playstyle.
Depending on the class, the gameplay will vary wildly from carefully setting up traps and critical attacks as a Rogue, casting spells from apart and teleporting out of danger as an Archmage, or just straight up charging at your enemies and mowing them down as a Berserker.

There is a lot of content in this game. 
250+ hours in (and I haven't touched Embers of Rage DLC yet, which, among other things, adds a whole new campaign!) and I still haven't played with all of the classes and races, and I just got the last unlocks a few hours ago. I expect to sink thousands of hours into this game without getting bored, because there is just so much stuff to do.

There are a few things that may annoy people, though.
Firstly, the game is not perfectly balanced. It also isn't terrible, but there are classes and talents and artifacts that are obviously better than others. This is usually doubly true for DLC and harder-to-unlock content. Overall it is not too bad, though, as everything is more or less viable. The enemies and the game itself is pretty well balanced, with one caveat, which brings me to my next point.

Secondly, the game is very difficult and has a steep learning curve. Expect to scour the wiki for information and ask lots of questions in the official Discord, especially if you want to win on Roguelike and higher difficulties than Normal. For reference, by the time I had spent around 250 hours in total (playing + gathering information) on this game, I only managed two wins on Normal/Roguelike (as Skeleton/Brawler and Yeek/Summoner). You die to something, then you figure out why you died, then you prepare yourself for that enemy next run, only to die to something else this time. It sounds frustrating, but it's actually very fun and rewarding, because eventually you'll be prepared for everything the game throws at you.

Thirdly, connected to the second point, you will play through the same zones and bosses dozens and hundreds of times, while only rarely seeing the later parts of the game (especially if you're playing Roguelike aka permadeath mode, like I am). The zones and bosses are always one of two variants, though the individual ""stages"" are randomly generated, as far as I can tell. Since the 100 hour mark I have been getting a bit bored / annoyed by this, but it's by far not bad enough to make me want to stop playing.

And if you take issue with a few things mentioned here, ToME has solutions for that too!
If you don't like permadeath, you can also play game modes with infinite or many lives. If you don't like some of the game mechanics, you can change them with addons from the workshop and you can (relatively) easily interact with the code, if you want to (or so I'm told, I haven't actually done that yet), because it's an open source game. That's also why, if you don't want to spend money (yet), you can play it for free by downloading this game on its official website!

In conclusion, I can not recommend this game enough.  There is no reason for you to not play this game (besides not being interesting in roguelike RPGs and not having enough time, I guess), so just do it!",1627919616,1627919760,True,11,0,0.616168618202209473,0,True,True,False,False,,,

Whew, what a game. 

What. 
A. 
Game. 

It's in depth. Has great, detailed lore. Tons of replayability. Absolutely A+ community. Tons of excellent humour. The dev, Dark God is extremely involved and is a very nice person. Really addictive. And most importantly, extremely fun.

To get into a bit more detail, this is an old school, grid-based fantasy roguelike rpg. You start by making a character from a great variety of ancestries and classes which include both the tried and true ones like elves, dwarves, humans and halflings for ancestries; and warriors, mages and rogues for classes; and also some more creative ones. 
The gameplay is definitely focused on combat and ability (which are called talents) and loot optimization. You go around the world, killing monsters, getting loot, completing quests and leveling up. And dying. Definitely dying a lot. 
The world is always the same template with a healthy dose of randomization for events, locations and such.
During your playthroughs you'll gain a lot of permanent unlocks which grant you new starting options and more. And achievements. Tons of achievents.
The game provides you with several difficulty modes to ease you into it if you don't want to go full masochistic right away. There are also various gamemodes to try, like an endless dungeon or an arena if you want to test your perfectly minmaxed build to the limit.
The DLC are well worth the price, and so are the minimal microtransactions the game features. In truth, it doesn't feel really fair to call them microtransactions, they are just a really good way to support the dev and spice your playthrough a little bit (or even other player's playthroughs).
The dev is also very involved both with the community and with creating new content/updating the game.

a.进游戏主界面的插件--DLC页面--点击某个DLC--页面最下方点download下载（就是贼慢）
b.也可以直接上官网下载（用steam账号联动登录）--选择DLC--直接下到本地以后，放进steam的TOME4下的game/addons文件夹下，游戏会自动识别

Right now at 117 hours I have not quite gotten into the high level of gameplay of this game and feel as though I am still learning this masterpiece of a game. Additionally this game is incredibly modifiable and the devs complete support modifications to their baby.

何個かアンロックしたのでとりあえずレビュー。
とてもオーソドックスなダンジョン探索系のゲーム。
キャラクリエイトで職業・人種を選んで、ある程度ステ振りしたら、はい、よーいスタート。
ただし情報量が多くてどれが正解か雰囲気でしかわかってない為、
とても調子よく進んでてもいきなりあっさりやられたりする。
死んでも即ゲームオーバーモードもあるが
レベルがあがったり特定条件をクリアすると残機数が増えるので、一般的なローグライクよりは多少有情。
ただしその場で復活→再戦→また殺されるとか余裕である。
耐性はとても大事。
テレポートやデコイ系統での緊急脱出手段が非常に大事。
道中の雑魚は雑ぁ魚ｖ雑魚ｖとサクサク行けてていきなりボスやレアに封殺されることもあるので
備えは大事。
残機がなくなるとセーブがなくなるので、一瞬虚無るけど
全体的なゲームスピードがかなり速いのであまり苦にならない。
移動で何もなければスキップ移動できるし、ある程度進むと回収も楽になる。
ゴミは店売り価格と同じに等価交換がいつでも可能になったり
あれこれこうなったら便利かなぁというのが手に届く。
まぁ、どうしても古いスタートなのでグラフィック関係はしょうがない点は多いけども

　古典的なローグライクRPGに分類されるであろうゲームだが、フィールドマップがあるタイプのローグライクでは必要性がほぼなくなっていた食料値が廃止され、デフォルトの設定だと数回蘇生できるなど革新的な部分は多い。
　種族もクラスも非常に多いが最初は大半はロックがされており、アンロックするには特定の実績を解除する必要がある。
　日本語化、蘇生可能などもあるため敷居は比較的低め。
　とはいえ難易度が低いわけではなく、自分はこれまで一度しか勝利することは出来ていない。

　難しい理由は属性耐性、状態異常耐性どちらもカバーしようとするとリソースが全く足りなく、敵もしっかり回復をしてくるため火力が低いと数百ターンかけても倒しきれないなんてことにもなる。
　その上状態異常は非常に危険な物が多く、属性耐性はしっかり積まないと中盤以降は容易に即死する。
　圧倒的火力で即死させられるほど強敵はもろくないので雑魚の群れに無双していたら気づいたら死んでいた人も多いだろう。
　そんなの無理ゲーじゃんと思うかもしれないがそれをなんとかするのが面白いところ。

I started as a lighting mage and finished as a dual-handed fighter that does 2.5-3k damage in a single turn with multiple 1k-2k damage shields with a duration 7-8 turns and 99 defense.

Before the review starts, I just wanna tell anyone that comes across this review, and wants to buy this game because it has the most achievements on Steam. Don't do it for that reason :P! Unless you really, REALLY wanna play this game, it's not worth it. The reason there are so many achievements is that you have to do em one time for every mode in the game, which means you have to the same achievements as much as 9 times each! ]]]]

It's been years since I played Tales of Maj'Eyal last time, but I somehow forgot to write a review. I can see that I quit at 80 hours, and that is in my opinion more than enough time to try to make sense of a game as immense as this one. 

First of all. Many people might have had the same idea, that finding the game on Steam with the most achievements in one game would be a real challenge, and fun to try to get through. I myself have been playing Binding of Isaac for years, and passed 1300 hours on the game...but the difference is that I actually have had lots of fun with Binding of Isaac. Realising that at least 1/6 of these achievements are just the same ones, over and over again, was not something I was very impressed over. Maybe fun if you're playing 1000s of hours in the game, and actually wanna try the different modes.

I remember trying alot of classes and playing the game normally. I did get somehow far, and I did get to explore and see alot of the game. I can't exactly remember the lore and story as I write this review, but it was kinda random what part of it you got. Probably also something you need to play alot to get.

Anyway. To make an 80 hours long story, shorter. I played the game, I died alot, tried new classes, and even did some never ending dungeon with over 100 floors. At some point I got tired, very tired, but I wanted to try one more thing.

I gave myself millions of HP, by editing a notepad file, and tried to do the game over again, just one last time. Now it just felt meaningless, because I couldn't die, but I did get to explore alot more, and see the story. Did I say I couldn't die...well, I was wrong...because at some point, even with millions of HP, insane strength and just everything maxed, something managed to kill me. I might have clicked too much, too fast, but yep...that is how hard this game is. Sometimes I can finish a game like that, but not with this one.

I tried to get a friend to test Tales of Maj'Eyal as well, but I don't think he even played for 2 hours...

Anyway. To sum this up. I didn't like the game. I might have found it more interesting to play, if the achievements were unique, and not added up 6 times over, for every single mod. I really like to do achievements, and in almost every game I play, I try my best to finish them, but for this game it's kinda silly, unless you actually wanna spend those 1000s of hours on it.

个人体验，这游戏是完全舍弃了画面优化，换来的是同类型最优秀的build职业系，比如从锁一血的狂战到召唤大军的死灵法师，到驱动蒸汽兵器的链锯屠夫及反魔法的绿色孢子植物人等等，几十种职业和种族间互相搭配，再配上各自差异很大的技能与特殊传奇装备，可以延展出花样繁多的各种玩法。

音乐上，tome4意外的带感，听起来高昂雄壮又凄凉，我也不懂这种简单音乐是怎么选的，反正挺配，剧情则是不跟npc对话，而是以散落在迷宫卷轴和装备上的方式描述（史诗感很强，但不少手札写的还挺逗，例如高塔的吸血鬼主人那段），会比魂系列更有孤独感，非常适合游戏内角色孤军深入黑暗地下的风格，难度上我不推荐无限复活的模式，那个模式就是练练手，也没法完成成就，最好的自然是永久死亡，会从各种墓碑里深刻感知到为什么法师脆，战士手短，刺客不能露头的终极奥义。

It's had so many QoL updates that at this point, anyone can play it without any prior knowledge of how to play a typical turn-based ascii rogue-like.

・英語に抵抗がない。
・他プレイヤーのキャラ情報を元にビルドを考えるのが楽しい。

・レベルによって残機が増えるAdventure
・1回死んだら即ゲームオーバーのRoguelike(いわゆるHC)

Normal，NMをクリアし，難易度Insaneで遊ぶのが一般的。

Insane-Roguelikeをクリアするのが一つの目標になるだろう。

Amazing world, amazing story, well worth for the texts and to find out the game's inner stories BUT!
BUT!
You will pay a heavy price for it ;p the game is madly unfair, tells you nothing at all and generally tries to be as garbage as it can be and use every cheap unfair trick in the book to show the player (oooh haha you died) cos the devs clearly are sad little virgins with 0 skill in designing actual difficulty for their games ;p
Also 95% of the builds won't make it through the cheatfest even with godlike luck (which you wont have; my last 3 heavy armor wielders just walked around in robes cos i never found an even HALF decent armor and shops offer only the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst.)
Basically money exists only to buy books with interesting stories and to get dwarf that sweet resistance bonus for having lots of gold. Otherwise you can ignore it cos shops NEVER have any good items (outside when you have lv. 1-3 cos the items in all the cities in the entirety of the game are locked to SUPER EARLYGAME power; that and the fact that these are the greediest vendors in gaming history cos they pay you literally 1/1000 the items worth and i am not joking ;p thats the sad part).

And a Prime BS example this game likes to pull off and both rudely and ignorantly call it ""difficulty"":
A boss that can autoheal to full when he touches an item, can teleport to the item automatically on wish with nothing in extance that can stop him, even when antiteleport is active and he is confused, cannot be stopped from touching an item and the item cannot be destroyed cos... for some reason the game allows you to explode walls but not glass chairs?
The answear is only one: You need to hit him REALLY REALLY HARD.


I may be wrong, whatever, this is for people that agree that leveling enemies always to your level is horrible. And making it mechanically IMPOSSIBLE to cheese just to force you to beat an enemy in that one and only one way (worse yet the way is ""punch hurrdurr""...) is even worse.

IN SHORT: If you like to read and want to read some amateurish but actually very VERY good quality writing, then this game is great, go to the elf town library and buy the entire Spellblaze chronicles, great read.

At the start, there's 7 classes (with an additioanl 21 unlockable as you proceed through the base game for a total of 28!), and 6 Races (with 7 unlockable for a total of 13). Each offers something new and unique, both in terms of actual playstyle, and in synergy with abilities.  Depending on race, and\or class selected, you will end up in different start-zones, doing different beginner quests.

The game features multiple different difficulty modes to help tailor your experience, but ultimately the recommended (and design-target) is normal/roguelike.  Normal do not alter stats or effects in anyones favor, while roguelike is an perma-death mode. Beyond that, you have adventure mode (gain a new life every x- levels) and exploration mode (infinite retries). The highest difficulties (madness\insane) must be unlocked through winning the game on the previous tier of difficulty.

There are optional online functionality in the forms of an in-game chat-log (that mostly show activity of other sonline, such as achivements earned, or deaths), storing of character information (not the save itself, but stats, quest-log, etc), and the item-vault (which allow sharing of items between your characters)

Seriously, think of pretty much anything and it either is included in the base game, one of its expansions or the many mods.

Wanna be a yeti brawler? Go for it.
Dwarf necromancer? Sure thing, king.
Feeling like a skeleton with chainsaws? Of course it is there.
Perhaps a demon gunslinger? Take it for certain.
What about a time mage elf? I'll give you three flavours of it.
Perhaps an eldritch abomination bent on consuming or possessing all life? Guess what.

The options are so many that I still haven't run out of fun stuff to try. But maybe you are worried about it being a difficult game. Well, as far as roguelikes go, I'd say it has a medium-tier entry barrier (not too difficult, but it has some specifics that you will have to come acquaintanced with after a few test games). If you are not feeling brave enough to try your luck with a character build of your own you can always find ones that are already tested as good enough for general play and campaign completion.

Talking about campaigns, I'll be blunt here: they are fairly long for a roguelike, and while quirky and with some interesting turns on certain tropes, for the most part it is ""generic D&D fantasy"". You know what stuff to expect from it. On the base game's campaign you have to do the full hero's journey: from the bottom to saving the world from a calamity. However, Embers of Rage, its most interesting expansion, allows you to play a sequel to that campaign in which you can see the consequences of what happened previously, and technology has advanced enough to guarantee chainsaws, guns, mechas and the like.

For what's worth, I'd advise you to get the game if you like roguelike RPGs, it will give you waaaaay more entertainment for its price than you would expect. If the graphics feel like a deterrent, I know that it can be a big hit or miss. Personally, I am not a big fan of the art style, but it doesn't bother me and it is pretty consistent, so there's that.",1613464943,1659809915,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1) Great game, great experience (overall), highly recommended. Available for free as well (without the infinite lives mode - don't think this has or will be changed) on all 3 platforms (works perfectly on Linux).
2) Worth it for the lore alone, on easier/story mode. Game is not easy or ""fair"" since it is partly luck based, but if you git gud this ain't that much of a problem.
3) Still being developed/expanded. Tons of features have been added. New expansions aren't being added fast enough, though the quality is quite good. A lot can be potentially added in the context of the already existing world.
4) Hard to master, but has great resources such as the official site (te4 org) and the wiki, tometips, forum, character vault, addons. The game might require you learn from your mistakes or spend some time getting to know the basics. The cool arcane blade didn't work for me at first, as ""mages"" have some weaknesses (alternate Maze boss, oozing horrors, antimagic adherents, etc). Shadow blade was an easier ""mage"" win for me.
5) Tons of races and classes, though most are locked (can be easily unlocked most of the times). For the less patient ones there is an addon for this. Also, a few require one of the 3 extensions (Ashes: 1 race, 2 new defilers; Embers: 3 races, 4 tinkers; Cults: 2 races, 2 demented).
6) Relatively ""poor"" graphics, but good looking for me and much better than the pixel like graphics that are for some reason popular (which make my eyes burn).

The game is presented similar to Rogue, with a top down grid, but simple raster graphics tiles have been presented instead of the raw ASCII characters. 

While it's good to see proper western RPG game mechanics in an RPG game, this is let down a little by the simplistic/low quality graphics.   The game does feature some sort of UI scaling, but it's more of a zoom feature.  If you run the game without scaling on a typical 4K monitor in 2021, the text is too small to read.  If you use the zoom, the text is too fuzzy.   This makes the game generally unplayable.   While the procgen that made Rogue/Hack famous is present here, it's important to remember Hack didn't have a lot of competition when it came to RPGs.   In the post-Pool of Radiance/Baldurs Gate/Might & Magic/Morrowind era of gaming, using procgen is just a copout because writing proper level design is hard... too hard for some developers, apparently. 

The simplistic/low quality graphics, the display issues, procgen used instead of content all make this too hard to recommend.  On top of that, there's a $10 price tag for this, which is higher than you would pay for Skyrim, Baldurs Gate, etc etc etc.  It's not good enough to recommend.",1611656518,1611656518,False,4,8,0.129505306482315063,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Traditional roguelikes always suffer from a complete disregard to explaining mechanics or gameplay strategies and TOME is no different.

My only major complaint is that the current version (1.7) is a little unbalanced. The game has a tendency to spawn random elites with abilities that you are categorically unequipped to handle and it is incredibly annoying. You will plow through trash mobs who can't touch you and then die in 2 turns to an elite. How is this properly balanced? After reading complaints about it I rolled back to version 1.5.10 in the steam beta tab and was pleasantly surprised to find that I wasn't getting 2 shot anymore. Elites still represent a threat, but my heart rate didn't jump 20bpm from just spotting one.

You still get lots of choices in how you play, but without all the fuss of real visuals. There is a lot of loot and lots of places to go. When you level up you get to add fun new abilities.

Tales of Maj'Eyal doesn't [i]need[/i] to be brutally hard thanks to the options it provides, but I genuinely believe it is best enjoyed when it's played at a difficulty where the game is still capable of destroying you. Really mastering the game requires sometimes taking your time and planning things out via the extensive tactical options available, but the sheer amount of freedom and flexibility you have in controlling character growth is incredible. 

Graphically...Maj'Eyal doesn't look the most impressive and won't wow anyone. The story...exists. The writing, however (despite the story being an excuse to walk from dungeon to dungeon) is actually fantastic and the world lore is extensive once you start to dig into the meat of the game. It isn't a game for everyone, though. If you're looking for something lighter or less crunchy, this is probably not the direction you're seeking. Even so, the ways in which Maj'Eyal seeks to streamline the roguelike process with auto-explore and healing via infusions instead of potions to get back to making meaningful decisions as quickly as possible is something to absolutely be lauded. In 2020, it's certainly not the only roguelike doing this -- but even after all these years I still say it's unquestionably the best.",1609288365,1609288365,True,2,0,0.528672397136688232,0,True,False,False,False,,,

プレイを進めるほどに実感するキャラクターの成長を楽しみながら敵をなぎ倒していくゲームだ。

つまるところ、このゲームの難易度設定におけるローグライク、即ち「パーマデス」はオプションであり、やり込み要素に近い。ディアブロのキャラクター製作時にハードコアを選ぶのと同じである。

Unfortunately for me, I didn't realize how dangerous it was... over a hundred hours later, I am playing it while at work, hammering hotkeys while burning through hordes of orcs. Despite how it looks, Tales of Maj'Eyal (also known as TOME4) is a wonderfully complex breath of fresh air; a genuine Rogue-like experience swimming in a sea of mediocre indie ""Rogue-lites"".

Graphics have never been a strong point for Rogue-likes and yet screenshots of this game don't really do it justice. All of the icons are sharp and easy to read, spell effects are well animated and colorful, and there's a large variety of environment tile sets. While the audio is nothing impressive, with its stock sound effects and bland music, this is one of the few games that I prefer to listen to music or podcasts to while playing. Currently there are 35 classes across 11 meta-classes which all play wildly uniquely. When combined with 16 races, you'll be able to craft a unique run every attempt regardless of what the game throws at you. It's honestly hard to find problems with this game... The last tier of dungeons get tedious because you're fighting walls of different archetypes of orcs, alt+tabbing seems to trigger a bug with movement, and there's a steep learning curve (but is that a bad thing for a Rogue-like?). 

TOME4 is as close to a masterpiece as you'll get for $7. Even that is a bit of an understatement because this game is actually free on the developer's website. However, purchasing it on Steam gives you the ""donation"" benefits along with access to Steam's benefits such as achievements. As long as you're ready for an uphill battle that requires reading forums and guides to survive, you'll lose dozens of hours to this game. I've only managed to beat it once on Normal/Adventurer difficulty, with a second character getting to the last tier of dungeons before dying, but I am still thinking ahead to my next play through.

Tales of Maj'Eyal (TOME) can be described in brief as a traditional or classic rogue-like RPG. It captures the true essence of the genre with turn-based combat, randomly-generated maps and loot, permadeath, unlockable permanent classes/races/abilities for future playthroughs, optional zones and quests with big risks with big payoffs, and importantly, a strong sense of satisfaction when you finally overcome a tough challenge and eventually beat the campaign(s).

Although the game can be downloaded free of charge, I encourage you to purchase it outright if you enjoy it (or just purchase it to begin with if it sounds even remotely interesting to you). I nominated this game for the 2020 Steam Award ""Labor of Love"" due to the dedication from the developer to continue enriching the game with content, and to diligently optimize and fix bugs. The dev truly takes pride in the game and it shows; with as much enjoyment as TOME continues to provide me, it deserves a solid review. If you're on the fence, I strongly recommend buying it with all the DLC. Full price is worth it and deserved but sales are always nice. Each DLC adds a great amount of content, including a full sequel campaign (Embers of Rage) to enjoy a different perspective of life in the game world. Read on if you want a more detailed breakdown.




[u]High points[/u]:

+ The combinations of classes and races allow for a great deal of replayability - at almost 500 hours as of the time of this review, I have hardly tried half the possibilities.
+ The numerous ability trees, divided by those offered by your choice of class and sometimes race, offer further customization and experimentation with different builds. Relatively easy to understand with a bit of a learning curve if you are new to rogue-like RPGs; a challenge to master as the randomly-generated maps provide new experiences every time. No two runs will be the same; as you unlock permanent access to new trees through in-game achievements, even playing a repeat class/race combo will provide a new experience.
+ The game world is filled with bits of discoverable lore that, after a certain point in a run, will become preserved for review on future runs.
+ Optional quest to obtain your own personal domain complete with optional (for a very small and well-deserved donation) access to a permanent, inter-dimensional vault to store your most prized rare or unique equipment. Should you pursue the permanent vault access, it enables stashing equipment sets over multiple runs so that you can plan a build tailored to maximizing its benefits.
+ A consistent world map with consistent low-, mid- and high-level areas rewards persistence by letting you plan around familiar challenges and bosses, or in many cases skip them altogether. You will come to hate certain unique endbosses until you develop a strategy and/or character build combo that satisfyingly crushes them.
+ Starting class, race and ability choices are interesting and plentiful enough to carry you through the initial hurdles of familiarizing yourself with unique game mechanics and learning the world map while you unlock more character options.
+ A handful of classes and races provide an alternate starting location and quest, and additional lore. These areas are typically inaccessible to other character builds.
+ Various difficulty settings enable you to adjust to an appropriate challenge for yourself at your own pace. The strength/weakness of the player character and mobs can be adjusted in traditional difficulty settings, and the permanency of death can be set to infinite lives, a handful of extra lives to cushion bad luck or mistakes, or classic rogue-like permadeath.
+ Optional vaults and world map zones sometimes appear and can be undertaken by the brave, the overconfident or the foolhardy. Higher-level and higher-rarity randomized mobs can be a difficult challenge and may unexpectedly end your playthrough, but they are just as often full of rare and powerful equipment that can improve your odds of continued success.
+ The tiles and mobs are fairly detailed and easily identifiable at a glance. Graphics and effects are certainly minimalist overall, but the default character tiles change their look to reflect your equipment (and some status effects) at a given moment. If you pursue the optional domain quest, there will be an opportunity for you to change your character's look based on equipment you have encountered throughout various playthroughs.
+ Technical requirements to run this game are low and have been optimized over time.


[u]Low Points[/u]: (but not really)

- Some might consider the graphic style to be outdated, I guess. I think the graphics fit the game fine, but it feels like something worth mentioning as a potential turn-off for some.
- The world is rich in lore and a familiar and mostly consistent zone placement on the two continents. Despite all that fuel for the imagination, all playthroughs feel vacuously devoid of sentient life with which you could interact socially. At worst, the most common non-hostiles exist as cardboard cutouts; at best, the important NPCs or those few with conversation cues resemble animatronic automatons (or sometimes exist only in the mind's eye as they talk to you from behind a closed door. How rude!). My counterpoint is that this style of game isn't meant to recreate a living, breathing world. It is designed for you to erase all evidence of life other than your own, by transforming it into loot and experience - through the magic of creative violence.
- Mastering the game mechanics will take a while. Certain unique abilities may take longer to learn by virtue of being initially locked from availability until you achieve some particular feat; some by accident or luck, sometimes a result of significant choices in optional dungeons, and some by just following/completing the campaign. Learning the basic game mechanics can be a trial-and-error process, but I remember having several ""a-ha"" moments where certain nuances became easier to recognize and predict. There is also the aforementioned option for infinite lives to provide a safety net while you learn.
- Some of the unlockable content requires you to risk permadeath. Some of it requires access to other unlocks first. This promotes replayability and is an appealing challenge to most, but it bears mentioning for those more easily frustrated; there are options to get immediate access to unlockables, but you won't earn any progress toward unlockables on that playthrough.
- You may not beat the game on your first playthrough. Or even your 10th. Some of this is just a gradual learning process and familiarity with the consistent aspects of the game. Some of it amounts to unfortunate crits or bad luck with random loot drops. Your favorite character will die permanently, and only their great deeds (in the form of expanded character creation options) and legendary gear (if you survived to reach your shared character storage vault and have donated at least once to obtain permanent vault slots) will persist beyond your death. Take risks with optional areas early and often - learn from them to increase your odds of survival in the future.
- The tradeoff for having a largely consistent world map, and only randomly generating the contents of the individual zone maps, is that after enough playthroughs it can lose a bit of luster. In spite of hundreds of hours invested in this game it never truly feels like a grind, but you'll probably end up with a ritual order of zones you stick to every time and some aspects of your later playthroughs may feel like you're marking off a checklist or going through the motions to get to the part you ""really care about"" for that particular run, whether it's in pursuit of an unlock, trying a new character combo or some new strategy. This perception of monotony is hastened along by the relative lack of friendly or meaningful interactions.

+ Insane character customization
+ Feeling of constant progression
+ Interesting lore and atmosphere
+ constant updates and bug-fixes. Even after years this game gets love from it's one-man game-creator. This keeps me coming back.
+ ""Just one more dungeon""-feel
+ even my girlfriend watches me play sometime. 

- you will get addicted and neglect other things. Sleep will be your first neglection.
- while addicted this game will haunt you in your dreams, leading to very bad sleep.

~ It is highly recommended to take a look at mods, although several may brake the fun or brake the game altogether, you have been warned!
~ if you have performance issues (which at later levels with massive spawns and effects might happen): there are several mods that fix this!
~ remember that mods need to be installed before starting a new char!

Final verdict:
This is THE GAME for in-depth character-creation nerds, like myself! Basically the whole fun and all the hours of this is char creation and planning before starting a new go. Another batch of hours is trying to get (really fun and special) achievements with special hardcore builds, if you are into that! (you probably are, if you are into building chars)!

When you start the game, you have the standard tolkien-esque fantasy fodder races [human, halfling, elf, dwarf] and classes [warrior, wizard, rogue]; but this is just the beginning, each time you play you unlock new races and classes, even a fortress which you can trade items between characters. The game currently [as of 2020] three expansion packs which have new races, classes, and areas to play. The game is a roguelike and unforgiving be prepared to spend hours levelling a character and have them die in one turn, especially in the later areas, especially with some of the unfair encounters that can demolish you.

The Good: massive game world and plenty to do, easy to learn difficult to master, classes each have their own play style, unlocking new content feels really rewarding, music is decent, pixel graphics are charming, mammoth amount of achievements, multiple difficulty settings for different styles which range for the slider [explore, rogue, etc.] to challenge modes [kill the final boss without taking off your starting bikini] and hidden hard modes [fight for control of your body with a parasite that makes you act randomly]. I recommend  playing a few times on roguelike to try out different classes and then playing through the whole game on exploration mode with your faves. 

The Bad: the main story is the bog standard orcs/dragons/demons vs. elves/humans and overall forgettable. The gameplay is addictive, if you have important things in IRL to do, maybe set a timer?

My first run lasted like 12h, and as far as i can tell i just barely scratched the surface of this game. So many classes/races, so much really interesting loot, incredible variety of enemies, ect, ect. I saw a fucking bear that summoned (or was it some illusion idk) another bear that had a bow and shot at me with explosive acid arrows...
If this game was 3d skyrim like, it would be an amazing mess. This really works well as (kind of) grid based combat with ""turns"" (with abilities/equipment you can slow down time, and perform more actions).
Also, so many ways to play. You can go full roguelike permadeath, or have many lives, or just exploration mode with infinite lives. Not interested in story? Just unlock arena or infinite dungeon crawler modes and just go full hacknslash...

The only bad things would be that some parts of the UI are kinda bad - like key bindings - why are the key names shortened? How am i supposed to know that C5 means Ctrl 5, and not the letter C... Or the equipment that has an insane amount of stats, but a lot of info is shortened and not really well explained, so if you really want to understand everything, its either to test how it works yourself or just go read the wiki...
But you can pretty much ignore most of it and just equip what you want and kill some mobs. The complexity is here for the hardcores who want to play on ridiculous difficulty settings.

First off, this Steam version is only a little different from the free version you can get from te4.org; so if you'd like to try the game, it's pretty much there for free in it's entirety. Purchasing on Steam only gives you small buffs, like being able to use custom tiles for your characters and of course it gives you the ability to purchase the amazing DLC so far. The Steam purchase is moreso to support the developers than anything.

ToME4 is a traditional roguelike along the lines of Angband, Nethack, etc. This means Turn-Based, Grid-Based combat around procedurally generated landscapes and dungeons (though this game also has different options, like multiple lives instead of just one, etc.). This game has a huge amount of variety in it's character creation, races and classes; as well as the ability to mod your own in with ease. If you're a fan of the character building aspect of the old Diablo games, then this game will automatically appeal to you.

This game doesn't throw much unfair insanity your way like a fair amount of Roguelikes do, and so every move you make feels immaculately strategic as opposed to just pure luck; though that certainly is an aspect too. The UI is fairly slick, controls modular and very easy to learn in comparison to other games in the genre, and the gameplay loop is incredibly addictive.

The devs are wonderful and work on the game non-stop pretty much, sometimes they'll hop on the game and grant players some items to help through their run, or just some goofy abilities; like the Sheer Badassery ability, which makes all creatures in a certain radius compliment your badassery when you kill them. It's a load of fun, and the game is fairly social for a singleplayer experience. All your characters are saved online on the website if you have a profile, letting you share your amazing builds, items and the inevitable varied ways your character will perish.

The game is a lot of fun, and the setting is creative; ranging from generic fantasy stuff, to lovecraftian stuff, to hellscapes, etc. I highly recommend this game. Amazing experience, and I'll undoubtedly pump more hours into it as time goes on.

Be warned that this videogame has a very VERY steep learning curve, but once you understand the core mechanics and how the game work, you will be sucked in in this vortex of pure gaming pleasure.

It's fun, has a huge amount of replayability and you can run this game on a potato computer.
The only negative, is that the learning curve is very steep as i have said, and that could potentially turn off many people (myself included back in 2016 i think) 
But as i said, once you get around the first four hours of torture, you'll find a hidden gem of gaming.
The story is a bit ""Dark"" and very grim i must say, and there's a lot to read. 
You can literally spend hundreds of hours just reading stuff. and you will most likely find a class for you, but it does get a bit of work to find it.
I highly suggest to either donate and/or buy the DLCs, for they do add a lot of extra content to the main game. like: More campaigns, character, maps, classes; items and more.

It’s not perfect but it’s among the best rogueLike games. I really have enjoyed my time with it despite not getting very far. Every class feels fun to me and they’re all viable. The game itself is very hard imo. I destroyed Hades, Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain 2, but I’ve struggled to survive in this game. The combat is unique and a bit strange. It’s an isometric turn based action rpg. I say action because mostly the fights flow and resolve quickly. 

A few pros and cons:

Pros: 
-tons of classes. No fixed route through game, even though certain classes and races start you in a certain location, you can simply leave and start elsewhere if you want. 
- lots of skills : each class have several viable ways to spec and level up. 
-a huge amount of items. This game has armour pieces, weapons of a large variety, and even has cool items called wild runes which give you strong survival abilities. 
- fun and worthwhile side missions where you Escort a person to a zone safely in exchange for a stat increase. 
- bosses and treasure troves are hard - if you’re not careful it’s easy to die very quickly to them. 
- I should also note I’ve only played on normal and rogue like difficulty. There’s a choice upon new game to remove permadeath which is nice imo. 

Cons
- time to die is very, very, very fast with some builds. If you build a damage oriented build like archmage for example you can get to level 15 ish like I did and still die pseudo instantly. Quite a few times I’m not even aware of the danger until it hits. I’m probably not the best at this game, but I think I’m better at this type of game than most people. So I think it might be a little too hard tbh. That said, I bet when I finally beat this game it’s gonna feel great, 
- the escort missions Can be incredibly frustrating when your escort moves towards the goal like a moron, and you lose track of them. It happens a fair bit and feels more based on luck than skill. If you fail an escort mission your run can be set back big time because you’re missing a huge stat boost. 
- DLC - there is stuff hidden behind dlc. I don’t like dlc so I put this as a con. The dlc aren’t expensive but neither is this game.

Overall, a good, cheap rogue like that’s hard af.",1604254191,1604254191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has permanent maps though, and completing various quests unlocks classes etc. If you survive a decent way into the main game you can find a spot to transfer loot from character to character, although storage is limited. I would say the spots where the game excels is in character building (TONS of classes, skills, augments, Items) and lore (well written with a good bit of dark/wry humor). There is also a story line to follow which is fleshed out enough to distinguish it from stuff like DCSS. Another place where it beats most classical rogue-likes is the UI, which is fairly intuitive and keeps the majority of skills and stuff on an extremely large but visible hotkey bar.  The base game stands alone, but the DLC is good too.

============

★★★　有繁體中文就是好   ★★★

這款遊戲我已經很久沒有玩過了~~~
最近看到他更新所以想說再來玩一下

沒想到關注了一下才發現，竟然出現了繁體中文版本
沒甚麼比這個更開心的事

以Rogue遊戲來說，這款遊戲真的會給予最高的評價
別看畫面好像品質很低的樣子，玩起來可是超級有趣的
強烈的推薦這款遊戲

這裡要評價幾個希望可以改善的缺點部分
(不過因為我很久沒玩過了，
所以不知道缺點是不是有改善了，
如果改善了我會再修改評價內容)

★★★   希望改善的缺點   ★★★

1. 雲端備份
這款遊戲好像沒有雲端備份，
有聽說他有內建雲端備份，只是沒有啟動，要透過一些方法手動啟用

2. 角色的解鎖
我之所以抱怨沒有雲端備份，
最主要原因就是角色解鎖的部分
很多角色要解鎖真的非常麻煩
好不容易打通解鎖了角色
可是重新安裝WINDOWS系統之後
全部都消失了
一想到要全部重新解鎖角色
我就想要放棄遊戲了

★★★
所以我希望，要嘛就是一開始就解鎖全部腳色
要嘛就是可以雲端備份(STEAM CLOUD)
讓資料可以保存下來
不用重新再打一次

除此之外，沒想到啥缺點了

強烈推薦這款遊戲
對Rogue遊戲有興趣的玩家
強烈的推薦

Можно стрелять по врагам из паровых пистолетов, и пилить их паровой пилой. А если пила на колесиках это даст бонус к скорости!
А можно превращаться в демона и забрать врага в свой ад чтобы расправиться с ним там.
Есть чем развлечься.

[h1]Abstract[/h1]
This is not a game or even a roguelike — this is a lifestyle! Works perfect on Ubuntu 18.04. Notebook with Intel® HD Graphics 4400 and i7-4600U CPU @ 2.10GHz is enough. 

[h1]Настоящий рогалик![/h1]
Начинается с того, что глаза разбегаются от вопросов вида «Кем быть?» и «Где тут можно выбрать мага?» После почти случайными кликами сляпываешь протагониста, выходишь во вводную локацию наводнённую какой-то нечестью,  выходишь в мир, открываешь журнал, следуешь совету и почти сразу же умираешь… Правда некоторые умирают ещё в «тьюториале».

Главное: если игра вам говорит «А вы точно хотите коснуться этого жуткого торчащего из земли щупальца?», то отвечать утвердительно — это 100% способ получить премию Дарвина. И да, даже если вы будете вести себя аккуратно,  издалека разглядывать монстров, проверять их характеристики, вы всё равно вскоре умрёте, так как этот мир весьма разнообразен на разного рода пакости, так что обежать его в лёгком темпе не получится. 

Поэтому для «поглядеть» следует выбирать бессмертие или уровень Exploration. Во всех остальных случаях смиритесь с тем, что вы потратите не одну _сотню_ часов для того, чтобы дойти до конца, открыть вот этот вот интересный класс под вот эту не менее интересную расу, чтобы налезла вот эта артефактная шапочка, чтобы опять же убиться этой комбинацией наиболее глупым образом.

[h1]Open Source[/h1]
Да, вы не ослышались — исходник игры доступны под лицензией GPLv3  и бесплатную сборку можно скачать прямо на [url=https://te4.org/]родном сайте[/url]. Лицензия на графические ассеты  к сожалению более ограничена ""with the Tales of Maj'Eyal game only"", но в любом случае развивать её имеющемуся сообществу это не мешает.  Донат или покупка игры на Steam открывает некоторые дополнительные возможности и расширения, в частности уровень сложности Exploration, но по большей части это возможность просто сказать спасибо DarkGod — создателю этой вселенной. Поверьте — есть за что!

[h1]ЛОР[/h1]
Тут есть История, буквально с большой буквы. Она возможно не сразу заметна, но тексты, свитки которых можно найти на просторах Eyal, написаны весьма и весьма хорошо. У каждого народа тут есть своя правда, даже у орков и демонов. Абсолютно у всех есть скелеты в личном шкафу…

[h1]Роль протагониста в истории[/h1]
С одной стороны её нет, так как это рогалик и никто особо не стремится сказать вам что делать за исключением некоторых ключевых моментов. Это рогалик, где по идее всё завязано на геймплей. Да и мрут эти самые протагонисты как мухи, поэтому обращать на них особого смысла нет, но с другой стороны по сути дела вы реально спасаете этот мир, ну или захватываете…

[h1]Советы казуалу[/h1]

✔ Не усложняйте себе жизнь и выберите Exploration, так как удовольствие от регулярного «геймовера»  получает разве что мазохист, а сунуть нос в каждую щелку очень хочется…

✔ Почитайте какое-нибудь из кратких руководств, например, [url=http://forums.te4.org/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=48756]это[/url]

✔ Запаситесь терпением — этот мир стоит того, чтобы его изучить.

[h1]🐧 GNU/Linux[/h1] 
Спас этот несчастный и полный чудовищ мир посредством полурослика-варвара с огненным вампирским двуручником и умер при этом каких-то 205 раз в среде Ubuntu 18.04 на ноутбуке с видеокартой Intel® HD Graphics 4400 и ЦПУ i7-4600U @ 2.10 ГГц. Графические спецэффекты от заклинаний иногда тормозят процесс, но игра пошаговая и по хорошему основное время должно занимать обдумывание следующего хода, если вы не хотите умереть, конечно.

If you are just getting your feet wet in roguelikes, maybe you've heard of ToME from doing some research online or happened upon this game and are trying to make a final decision between Caves of Qud or a number of others popular at this time, [i]start here[/i]. This game deserves a recommendation to that specific audience, and high praise for the level of simplicity brought to what can be a very complicated genre. No ASCII, no arduous keyboard commands, hell you can play ToME almost entirely with a mouse. Many have spent likely thousands of hours mastering the many intricate classes in this game, there's mounds of content, and winning feels good.  This review is not for you, and this is a good game for you to get your feet wet, or maybe even soaked for a while.

[b]To everyone else[/b] - I'm not an extremely experienced roguelike player, I've got a couple hundred hours here and there but I am far from a salted veteran, [i]I should not think this game is easy[/i]. But it is... But its not.. But it is. 

Let me explain. 

The most likely element to kill you in ToME is far and away, without a doubt - [b]boredom[/b]. There are just WAY too many trash mobs and so much of the combat is meaningless, tactic-less, skill-less filler. The fact that on each floor of a dungeon you can easily encounter [i]dozens[/i] of one shot-able foes lulls you into this repetitive trance all to be broken by some beefy elite that can KO you in 4 or 5 turns, a couple of which you've likely burned through before you even noticed there was [b]FINALLY[/b] a real threat. Everything about ToME screams, ""more is more"", with a complete lack of restraint in consideration to the gameplay loop itself. I have not been at this for long, but I have to commend those of you have frequented the 8 monotonous levels of [spoiler]Dreadfell[/spoiler] just to get the the 9th and final meaningful one. Then there are the pages upon pages of items to skim through when exiting each floor, because even the most seemingly benign enemy can somehow drop random uniques 2 or 3 tiers above what you may have (it appears gear is level-based, not enemy-based). [b]Every enemy doesn't need to have a loot pool[/b]. I found myself really wanting to try other classes and skill combinations, an area I'm actually happy to see this much content overload, but just simply could not sell myself on the monotony of it all. Its a real shame too because I feel like this is so easily fixed, [i]cut some of these dungeon levels[/i]. I found myself actually happy to find a new area that had only a single floor, or the nice design of the Tannen's Tower with multiple floors but compact rooms. And most importantly, above all else [i][b]cut some of these meaningless hoards of fodder[/b][/i]. Fighting elites and boss level enemies is fun, ToME has masterful tactics and thrilling combat that is quite simply ruined by the overabundance of rats and snakes and ants and slimes and [b]oh my god why am I still fighting this stuff at level 47[/b]. I'm sorry, I know there is a lot of love for this game, and my opinion is likely unpopular, but it comes from a place of love. There were some really, truly amazing experiences throughout my time here in Maj'Eyal, this game does some things so incredibly well. But the fact that in another round, my end of days would no doubt come from glazing over and dying from [b]the encounter I actually wanted the whole time[/b] has me signing out. 

I'll finally just touch on the fact that increasing the difficulty does somewhat bandage this problem. As I played mostly on normal and just a tiny bit on nightmare I actually feel pretty strongly that nightmare is bit more fun.

К сожалению. не обошлось и без недостатков - количество трэш-мобов и трэш-лута зашкаливает, что приводит к усталости от игры и ошибкам при долгих сеансах. Тем не менее, проект является несомненным хитов среди роликов. Рекомендую попробовать.

P.S. Важная подсказка для тех, кто считает графику мелковатой. Для исправления ситуации лучше всего измененить размер плитки с со стандартного 64x64 на что-нибудь вроде 80x80. И игра сразу преобразится.

Можно не спеша обдумывать каждый ход, сделать перерыв на чашечку кофе.
Я наиграл мало часов, потому что сначала купил ее в GOG, но там нет привязки к аккаунту на сайте игры https://te4.org/ Пришлось покупать второй раз со всеми дополнениями. Но если играть без дополнений, то можно вообще не покупать - базовая игра бесплатна.
Плюсы:
Отличный баланс. Автор годами его выверял, получилось очень гармонично.
Огромный мир, ре-играбельность. В конце надо убить злодея, но для этого надо открыть несколько континентов.
Много персонажей и контента. Причем для открытия персонажа надо еще попотеть, у многих не очевидные условия открытия. Например, чтобы играть вирмом, надо съесть сердце королевы червей.
Весь прогресс и все персонажи сохраняются на сайте игры. Можно создать аккаунт и прямо оттуда смотреть свои достижения, инвентарь и прочее.
Нетребовательность к железу. Свежая версия игры пойдет на однопроцессорном ноутбуке HP Compaq nx6310. Конечно, приятнее играть под Win 10 на стационарном компе с видеокартой и процессором intel5.
Графика и в плюс (не грузит систему) и в минус (ну нет тут лучей!)
Минусы (а как же без них!):
Нет русского языка. В игре надо много читать, хотя английский простой.
Не очевидные настройки. Хотя, как плюс, настроить можно почти все.
Всем любителям РПГ и рогаликов рекомендуется!

Главный плюс игры - огромная вариативность при создании персонажа: доступно множество рас и классов. Причём, большая часть из них в начале игры заблокирована. Проходя квесты и выполняя достижения игрок может разблокировать их, а также дополнительные навыки и скины для персонажей.
Причём, игра за разные классы отличается. Подчас - довольно сильно. А иногда - полностью. Разработчики сильно заморочились, и придумали огромное множество механик и параметров, так или иначе взаимодействующих друг с другом.
Причём, каждый класс можно развивать по разному, и подбирать разную экипировку. В итоге получаем практически бесконечную реиграбельность.
А ещё ведь есть несколько кампаний, разные пути выполнения квестов и дикое количество контента. Подчас открываемого по чистой случайности. 
Нашли вы, например, подозрительный воротник с хорошими статами. И, недолго думая, надели на шею. И ничего, что у него зубы растут. Но вот после очередной смерти этот зубастик предложит спасти вам жизнь, нужно просто предоставить паразиту полный доступ к своему телу.
И всё, больше мы не гном, хоббит или эльф. Мы теперь существо, управляемое паразитом, поселившимся у нас на шее и голове. Причём, этот паразит обладает собственной волей, и может сожрать ни в чём неповинного NPC,  не спрашивая нашего разрешения.

For the gameplay, it's great with tons of classes and specialization, the ability to reset the last points invested can make it so you can still turn around and change your skills at the start of the game to best make use of the first unique item you find. Speaking of items, they're really interesting with sometimes build-changing effects, the bosses will always drop one so you're not completely at the mercy of RNG. The game also has good original lore and an overworld to explore it, while the dungeons change in shape the overworld stays the same and the quests are (mostly) always at the same place so you can play faster once you know where things are. The unlock system is nice, you have to do certain things in game to unlock the different races and classes, which is way more interesting than juste grinding.
The game is hard and even on the base normal/adventure(multiple lives) mode you'll be challenged, and then there is roguelike mode with only one life if you really want to challenge yourself, or there's the exploration mode(unlimited lives) if you just want to play for fun.

A good amount of mods is available too, giving you access to more classes and Quality of Life changes.

With this in mind i want to point out... $7, and my 280 hours is actually on the light side for this. 
the value is ridiculous, ive spent 50-90 on high end games that while also fun, lose me somewhere between 25-50 hours (thats not ALL AAA games, but alot of them)

If i had more time I can easily see my time played going 10 fold higher, I'm not great at the game but i ONLY play permadeath style, with that being said in my hours played ive beat the game ONE time.

The fact that it is even compared to other roguelikes is baffling to me. In my humble opinion, this game is far superior over any title of the genre I've played so far (incl. ADOM, DCSS, Caves of Qud, maybe Elona comes close but certainly isn't as polished):

1) Multiple weird races and classes. You don't just have your usual suspects aka mages, paladins, fighters etc. There are ""Writhing Ones"", ""Possessors"", ""Paradox Mages"", all with their own slew of talents which make them unique. 

2) Huge talent screen. The sheer amount of abilites and their interactions with each other make for a lot of different character builds, a very deep RPG-like feel and complex tactical encounters.

3) Some item tooltips are a sight to behold haha.

4) Lots of ""plot"", side quests, story, unique bosses. A lot of roguelikes feel like you're just thrown into an empty world full of mobs. TOME has a unique boss for every single part of the world, a story progression that uncovers another ""continent"", lots of lore, multiple side quests and very importantly, a world that actually feels alive. Oh and every zone looks different and plays different soundtracks. It's not just dungeon after dungeon after dungeon and all look the same. Which is a nice touch.

5) This game will kick your butt on higher difficulties. And no, it's not because of RNG. It's you who made the mistakes and there's always a number of things you could've done better if you're actually honest with yourself, stop crying and turn on your brain. This isn't a hack'n'slash.

6) The game is being actively updated to this day.

7) Icing on the cake is the incredibly friendly and helpful community. There's a well-frequented in-game chat that you can always ask questions in, and some veterans of the game will be there to help you out.

- I enjoyed any and every class I played. This has never happened to my in any game I played.
- Customization of each class is great and has a lot of flexibility.
- Combat is always hard and is paced properly. I never felt like things we're too easy or too hard.
- You always know when you mess up and you don't feel like its out of your control. 
- Item and skill upgrades come at the right pace.
- Interesting bosses and enemies. There is a lot of variation.

In general, TOME really just has the whole package deal. It has this great foundation in terms of game design and utilizes its tools very well to deliver an entire experience.  A lot of games fall short in certain areas but I can't really  think of anything that this game really sucks at. The only thing I can even think of shitting on really is just the graphics. I don't even care. If most games today could be as well thought out and designed as TOME, I would take that over the graphics.

I really didn't play very many roguelikes before this. Now, I have an interest in the genre. I always look for things that are distinctly different than TOME because I'm fairly certain that they will always fall short.

My favorite game is DCSS, to give you an idea of what I like about the genre. I really want to like TOME, but I can't.

The choices for player creation are awesome in this game, and they make each playthrough meaningfully different... when you are fighting the stronger enemies. Unfortunately you are mostly going to be mashing low cooldown abilities to clear thousands upon thousands of enemies in dungeons that have far too many floors.

The worst part of this game is the places that disable your autoexplore or resting. Water levels make you drown after a period of time which messes up the AI from autoexplore, rarely some floor tiles deal damage every turn, and some levels (or even small areas WITHIN levels) automatically fizzle your teleport without warning, wasting your turn.

There are quite a few UI changes that would make this game a lot easier to get into. I had to install a mod to remove some of the ambient noise to eliminate some of the shrieking birds. There simply isn't a slider for ambient noise separate from sound effects. I spent way too long trying to wrangle my AI so that it wasn't hiding the playable portion of the map TOO much. The default keybindings are really bad (you have to turn off numlock to move a targeted spell diagonally???). Certain characters and common objects (TREES) are made to look they are two tiles tall, obscuring the tile behind them and making it harder to read the map. Bizarre.

I think it would be a better game if you could unlock all the player races/classes by playing whatever character you wanted. Or if you didn't need to rely on a % chance of something spawning. Or if you didn't need to unlock them at all.

I just beat the game with a 33 hour long playthrough. I would say the fun/challenging part of the game was about 10% of that. Granted, my first victory was on normal/roguelike. Maybe I would have had more fun if I played on a higher difficulty (having no idea at the start of the game how difficult it would be), but right now I don't want to touch this game again for a long time.",1595704820,1595704820,False,1,0,0.440673500299453735,0,True,False,False,False,,,

More:
One key feature that makes this game so incredibly good is that it is *eminently playable*, meaning that it's very easy to learn but deep and complex enough to be extremely difficult to master. The many years' worth of work that's gone into this game absolutely shows: The interface and gameplay are so straightforward and intuitive, it makes it a breeze to pick up and play.

This is an absolute paragon of outstanding game design (which explains why it's won awards and universal praise). From something as basic as the UI to the game's deep mechanics, ruleset, and the brilliant subtle aspects of the procedural generation, it all just *makes sense*. 

As one example of why the procedural generation here works so well and feels so natural: I was exploring a forest with animal enemies you'd expect to find in a forest. I come across a stone building, and it's filled with human enemies (cutpurses, bandits, rogues) and loot. There aren't random bears or sentient trees in there; it's a bandit hideout! Yet another stone building might have undead; it's a crypt! You might come across a grave that you have the option to disturb....and oh crap, bad move!! An ancient vampire comes out!

*Feel* is such a critical piece of what makes a game enjoyable, and TOME feels so organic and authentic. I find it as easy to completely lose myself in this game as any of the best, most engrossing games I've ever played in my life. And the fact that the gameplay is so intuitive and fun means that you can easily pick this up and make your way through a dungeon when you have some free time.

Better yet, TOME pulls off an impressive balancing act in this regard: While you don't have to sit through endless tutorials or read an encyclopedia worth of information in order to play and have a good time....this is one of the deepest, most complex, most varied games I've ever encountered. From the lore to the items to the dungeons to the HUGE bestiary, named elites/bosses, locations, quests, etc....this is just a huge, deep world. You'll make your way through dungeons, reading diary entries from some dead explorer about an ancient civilization, and then realize you may have to come back some time later because the ruins are underwater, and you have no idea how to breathe underwater (yet). By the way, did I mention you can drown?

One very cool feature in this immense game is the fact that you can see live (optional) chat from other players (though it isn't an MMO). Any time you have a question on *anything*, helpful veterans are always on to give you clear answers and worthwhile advice. This is a very welcoming, friendly community. A breath of fresh air these days! Another fun feature in the live chat is that you also see real-time updates when other players get achievements....and when they die! It's hilarious seeing a red message that so-and-so ""was ripped to pieces"" by monster X.

If you're on the fence, all I can say is that the price of this game on Steam is insane; for the amount of content you get, the fun you'll have, and just the sheer enjoyment of the experience...it's a no-brainer. Look through the reviews here and notice that some folks have over 1,000+ hours. I get it now. You will too.",1595178137,1597983219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You have your warriors, rogues and mages - but also chronomancers who manipulate time, mentalists who run around with heavy shields and heavy nukes, steampunk gunners, and other cool toons. Combat is deep, hard, tactical, and fast.

One of the best games ever! 10/10, highly recommended.

EDIT after 100 more hours recently: Comrades, this game is godly. Here are some of the things that make it so awesome:
- High quality variety and content - there are a couple of dozen playable classes and a dozen races, two campaigns, infinite dungeon mode, hundreds of artifacts, and hundreds of cool monsters. The classes are not just stat sticks or variations on a theme - they are fully fledged archetypes gathered from all of scifi pulp. You can wield lightsaber-type ""psi-blades""; time travel; fry enemies with elemental torrents; maintain your own army of demons; snipe enemies with guns; or turn into an earth elemental and pound your enemies into dust. The mobs come in all shapes and sizes, and the mean ones are nasty in a good way! One can put you to sleep, another put you in a chokehold, a third one can strip your defenses and heal to full in a couple of turns.
- Speed - you can complete a full run in ~10 hours, and have a good idea about your build in 2-3 hours. There is no grinding - you just push onward. 
- Good looks - the monster and character art are both grade A. Some of the levels are also neat.
- Balance and pace - it's hard to balance a game this rich in content, but DarkGod has done it. No monster, item, or skill breaks the game; but at the same time, they all feel like they pack an oomph.
- Tactical richness - you will often find yourself in tight spots juggling 30 cooldowns and thinking of a good way to dodge another death. And in TOME4, every death feels deserved and avoidable, and you can always raise the difficulty on your next run.

Bottom line, this game is phenomenal. TOME4 isn't just another rogue-like - it sets the bar for roguelikes in the 2010's and into the 2020's. This thing will be fun and playable 30 years from now. I hope Valve hires DarkGod (the main dev) and the artists and lets them make Volvo the Roguelike.",1595120752,1596902968,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+Adjustable experience through difficulty settings, keybinds, mouse gesture bindings, and community addons
+Visual feedback through sprites, small movement animations, particle effects, auras, etc. (I hate staring at the plaintext ascii that most roguelikes make you sit through)
+Wide variety of playstyles from whacking enemies with a club, cutting people down with pain inflicted to yourself through eldritch reflection, using energy swords made out of psychic power, hijacking bodies, and much much more.
+Unlockable objectives that not only reward you for playing but contextually make sense when you get them.
+Interesting writing. I actually like reading the lore notes in this game (which can be read anytime after the first through a menu).
+Challenging gameplay. It feels good to get far or even win because it feels hard-won.

Okay, on to the negatives.
-Random events. Sometimes for your build you REALLY want to get a certain escort quest to show up or a certain event to happen that could define the build you are after, and sometimes it just doesn't happen (this can be fixed with an addon, but i'm judging just off vanilla).  In some ways this makes things more interesting, but after you have ran into them before it just becomes annoying.
-Random enemies. You could be cruising through a dungeon because you got lucky and have an awesome gear and skill setup and the normal mobs and bosses just cant compete, however you run into one rare enemy that has just the right randomized talent setup to kill you instantly, and it feels BAD when it happens.
-Class imbalance. Some classes are much more powerful than others. Some races are much more powerful than others. All of them are capable of pulling wins but some are just painful to play compared to others; like alchemist, who has a total of [[ONE]] good talent in their entire kit and the dev is like ""yeah, this is good enough :)"".",1593751833,1593751833,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Edit:
So. It seems this game is a pretty cool character builder. Levels come pretty fast and the choices you have when leveling up really feel varied and meaningful.

Regular mobs are fairly easy but the quest bosses offer a bit of a challenge, although not too much.

The problem is it feels like a game of skill, but at the end of the day it's really not. It's just about luck. It's about how far you can get before the game drops something in front of you that one-hits you and you're back at the menu deciding if you'd like to start over or not.

I've played other roguelikes where it feels like if I had done something differently, utilized my skills in a wiser fashion, I may have survived. So play, lose, learn from it and don't make the same mistakes again. But I don't get that feeling here, it just feels unfair. The game will spawn something that is so far beyond your ability to deal with there's nothing you can do but lose. Nothing to learn.

硬派なゲームバランスに豊富なアップデートと不遇職などの定期的なテコ入れ。

■難しい、だが無理ではないバランス

Most of the game is a slog of combat where you easily destroy hordes of weak monsters until at some point 10-15 hours into your run you encounter some boss monster that's far more powerful than anything you've seen before that kills you.

Most of the game being combat would be fine if the combat was engaging, but it's not. There are no interesting decisions to make. It's mostly clicking on a monster until it's dead, then moving on to the next monster and clicking on it until it's dead. There are some basic strategies that you always want to use, like backing into a narrow hallway so that they need to come at you one at a time, but there are never any novel situations that require or reward innovative solutions. After 20-ish hours I got an achievement for killing 1000 monsters, which says something about just how much of the game is this boring and mindless combat.

One notable thing about the game that's a little different from most other roguelikes is that is doesn't include consumables, inventory management, hunger, or really any other kind of resource management. Even your health bar refills very quickly over time, and there's no cost for resting between battles, so health management is a non-issue. Apparently the developers thought that those mechanics were onerous, and wanted to liberate their players from them. But they didn't utilize any of that space they freed up to add in any other mechanics.

So without the interesting battle tactics, resource-management, or difficult trade-off decisions, the game is basically Sword of the Stars: The Pit (another roguelike), minus all the things that make that game so compelling.

There's a story, but it feels uninspired. There's nothing particularly engaging about the world or its atmosphere.

I kept at this game for as long as I did because I thought that there must be some reason it had such a high proportion of positive reviews that I would come to see.

If you like fantasy roguelikes then you should LOVE this game as much as I do. It's UI is great with a whole bunch of QOL features. I will say a *few* more obscure QOL features could do with being more apparent as you may play the game for a while and then suddenly realise that there was a simpler way to do things. But really that is splitting hairs at trying to find something wrong with the game. Rich lore, unlimitted replayability, many diverse classes with each class being able to be played in different ways, many diverse creatures, some customizability in difficulty - you don't have to play on Hardcore setting if you don't want to.

This game rocks. I'm going to fire up a game :)

This game is INCREDIBLY fun - others have likened it to other hack-and-slash and loot-based games like Diablo despite being turn-based, and while that might be a little hard to believe on paper, it really does feel like this game hits the sweet spot that those kinds of games strive for. That's partly because ToME will always flow at your pace, and the mechanics are deep as hell.

Just to get this out of the way really quickly: although the game doesn't look the prettiest, the visuals are still quite indicative of what you're supposed to be looking at. I quite like the tileset's look, and it's much better than looking at ASCII characters like you'd have seen in other roguelikes IMO (I guess they're fine, but I have a hard time adapting to them). Music and sound is generally pretty good, too, and they add to the game quite a lot. My only complaint is that you do hear certain sound effects way too much, especially if you're playing certain types of characters (breaths and lightning much?), but that's more a nitpick than a criticism considering how unbelievably expansive the scope of the game's other aspects are.

Also, I love the class and character build depth of this game. While some races feel a lot better than others in several cases, and a handful of classes lack depth of choice in their skill trees (looking at you Bulwark), I can't deny that each race and class I've tried has been fun and unique in their own right. Gear and various story events also help contribute to build diversity in a more dynamic, often unpredictable way, and can either round out a build that's lacking in certain areas or build upon your class fantasy in an intriguing way (the rare one-off runes/inscriptions come to mind). This is especially true now, it feels like, with a decent amount of early equipment now sporting unique or activatable effects compared to earlier patch cycles. The lore and setting bits are well written and established, too, often providing unique, creative, and sometimes comedic glimpses into various aspects of the world without projecting a long info dump about them in the middle of your play session. 

In terms of gameplay, almost every movement and action you take on the field will shift time forward by a single turn, and those actions take only one or two keystrokes or clicks of the mouse. Walking into an enemy or clicking on one that's next to you will instead 'bump' your character into them, dealing your weapon's damage to them for that turn. You can also utilize skills, pick up loot, activate special tiles and use items in your inventory in a similar manner. It's a fairly simple yet robust system for a turn-based game that doesn't waste your time waiting; as soon as you use an action that takes up time, everything around you takes their actions instantly, and control returns to you for the next turn. This means you can explore and cut through easier mobs very quickly (especially with the help of auto-explore), and this pace can feel rather familiar to Diablo and its contemporaries. On the other hand, more difficult enemies and bosses will usually require more thought on your approach and will require more time spent thinking and deciding on your actions each turn. This game can be incredibly difficult and punishing, even if you're prepared for its more dangerous fights, so planning out your build and picking through your well-earned loot will greatly contribute to the success of your character. Even then, expect to die and remake your characters... a lot.

For my perspective, I started this game a few years ago on Easier/Adventure, which is basically the easiest difficulty and allows your character a growing stock of up to 7 lives as you level up. I played a Rogue a couple of times, with one of them reaching the mid-level 40's towards the end of the game after a couple dozen hours, but I sunk a lot of my extra lives on silly deaths while learning the game. Feeling a little more confident, I immediately started over on Normal difficulty as a Shadowblade. Despite the added challenge, I had an easier time of it and enjoyed the familiar setup to Rogue with shadow-based spellcasting thrown in, and I even reached the final boss fight with a couple extra lives in tow. Even so, I couldn't do enough damage to take the win, and my character ultimately lost the remainder of his lives in a few vain attempts. I was a little bit frustrated at that point; though I felt I had learned a lot and managed to defeat most of the content I came across at that point, I still struggled against the tankier bosses and felt my options ran low in the middle of some fights. I hadn't used any guides up to that point, so I had been focusing on maxing a few skills and didn't fully grasp the tactical usefulness of all my options. I took a different approach on my third try: having just unlocked Temporal Warden, I took the character into Normal with a character build in mind, one I had found on the ToME forums. It's still probably my favorite run of all time, not just for being my first win against the dastardly final bosses, but with how much fun the concept of a time-travelling warrior was, being very different from the Rogue and Shadowblade I previously played. The guide I read had also helped me understand to look for useful increases from your skill points and taught me the value of saving skills and inscriptions for escaping difficult situations. 

I still haven't played the game enough to feel like an expert or anything, but few games feel so challenging yet so satisfying when you manage to conquer a difficult boss or situation. I took a long break after beating the game with my Warden and came back to the game somewhat recently, and I'm happy to see the game still going strong with new content consistently being released. Since then, I've played a Bulwark on Normal for a (surprisingly easy) win against the final boss, then turned around and went through the 2nd campaign for EoR as a Sawbutcher. At the time of this review, I'm going through on Nightmare difficulty as a magic-oriented Wyrmic, and it feels like a whole new *terrifying* experience. Currently on my last life though... wish me luck!

Something with such a wild variety of content should not be as much fun to play as this game is - It's clear the amount of work and fine-tuning that has been put into this game to sidestep the many traps that could be present given the broad scope.

It's fun, and it remains fun after however many runs (in some ways the fun gets better; building for known checkpoints over a longer term of the character build).

It's balanced well; some character classes will be a bit stronger or weaker than others; but the development of each character involves genuine (and mostly fun) choices; and when you inevitably DO die; normally you can put it down to some kind of error (even if that is just not running away quick enough).

Not a whole lot I can say that hasn't been said before over the 20 or so years this game has been around. I didn't start playing it until last year and the first dozen or so runs I thought this game was 'overhyped garbo'. It took many deaths and about 60-80 hours of 'off & on' play (mainly when buzzed) before I was able to begin seeing the sheer beauty this game has to offer, hidden behind it's incredibly retro graphics and at times obtuse UI/stat boxes. 

Simply put after I'v amassed over 800+ hours thanks to Covid 19--it's the BEST game I've ever played. PERIOD. Everything I like about my games, the way I feel when playing them and how it fits into my life is here in ToME--checks all the boxes and then some. 

Just a small list off top of my head of why I love ToME..

[h2]replayability[/h2] infinite? numerous race/classes to mix and match, difficulty settings and more
[h2]lore[/h2] best ever in a game in my opinion/abundant and 800+ hours in and still learning it all
[h2]awesome loots to find[/h2]gives you the same rush casino's do without throwing money away!
[h2]easy to play, hard to master[/h2]every game session has meaning. you never stop learning. ToME also has some a lot of neat features compared to other classic roguelikes in terms of inventory management, storing loot, selling loot and more--all of which is done seamlessly in an easy way that doesn't require DOS like coding knowledge to understand. 
[h2]achievements[/h2] my goal is to unlock them all 1770+ before I die irl, wish me luck!
[h2]environment[/h2]unique and interesting. best described as tolkien meets star wars. (want to kill medieval orcs in a mech suit or with chainsaws? sure, why not!)
[h2]plays like MMO but is single player melding the two perfectly.[/h2] ToME online community is the greatest folks on this planet. seriously. never met a nicer community that's always willing to help you, motivate you or be there for you if you die or just have a bad day!
[h2]stat tracking.[/h2] characters get logged on te4.org to be viewed forever for better or worse. Not only cool just to look back on your guys but a powerful tool to get better or help others get better. 
[h2]Still supported with Updates and even DLC[/h2] that is LEGIT, no funny business even after 20 years! Looking forward to a possible Switch Port, then I'd be in heaven!!! 
[h2]music[/h2]mostly top notch. Newer stuff from the DLC campaign Embers of Rage though, that music for it is insanely good. 
[h2]perfect anytime to play![/h2] quick sessions or long sessions--whatever you want. multiple game modes, multiple ways to die. there is a way to play and mode to play that will fit whatever time you have to game. it's perfect for pick up anytime, anyday and play. 

I mean.. Overall. I think this game should belong in every man, woman and childs gaming library. It's not only the KING of roguelikes, it's the best RPG/ARPG mashup I've ever romped around with.. It's original, unique, difficult and habit forming because of the fun you have. So much fun! 

Don't let the old retro graphics put you off. Real gamers know it's not on the outside that matters, it's the gameplay and holy **** the gameplay for ToME is SOLID Gold. Doesn't get any better and probably won't, this game is the last of it's kind and deserves your patronage on sale, off sale, free, w/e. Get it. Die. Learn. Die More. Win. Taste Victory Hero. Turn up Difficulty. Repeat. 

I mean I just love ToME. So much I even donate to the cause on the monthly through Patreon because I figure--I used to buy games left and right but not nearly as much these days lol Have been saving loads of cash thanks to this game. Seems fair to throw devs of ToME something for the amount of time I get out of this game each month all things considered. 

But the cool thing is for new players? You can go download the WHOLE freaking game for free at te4.org and play it 100% without missing any of the basegame stuff. It's incredible. On the fence? Check it out. Ask for help in-game too, we are there to support your journey hero. 

Kind of a sloppy review I know but I just felt inclined to write something since lately this is ALL I play anymore and you know what? I don't feel like I am missing anything. I've found an enlightenment I didn't know existed. It's bliss and can be for you too should you give this game a fair shake!

Une fois en votre possesion vous pouvez le re télacharger sur le site officiel. Ce qui permet donc d'y jouer sur n'importe quel ordi, sans avoir a passer par steam.
Donc les heures des joueurs affiché n'est pas toujours la bonne ^^ (pensez a ceux qui en ont plus de 400h).

La qualité du jeux est, 
la rejouabilité énorme, 
les evolutions du personnages peuvent vous surprendre,
tout comme l'evolution des quetes.

Et plus on avance dans le jeux, plus on découvre le lore. 
Les découvertes ne sont pas juste la pour le RP qui est top. Elle débloque de nouvelle race, classe, histoire, voir meme mode de jeux.

Donc en gros : Jouer au jeux, si ca vous tente biensur.

Ah : niveau graphisme : Ca peut avoir l'air ""moche"" mais vous découvivrez une certaine subtilité des graphismes. Des monstres originaux, armure et stuff plutot cool, beau et original. Mais surtout les sorts, certains en jette. 

Bref une perle.

Soyez bienvenu dans cette perle caché :) 

A plus sur le tchat en ligne permetant de communiquer avec tous les joueurs de TOME.

Tales of Maj'eyal é um rogue-like Tradicional (Assim como ADOM, DOOMRL, Ananias e etc.) onde tu escolhe uma dentre as várias espécies de personagens e uma das diversas e criativas classes. Você segue explorando a história do game entrando em dugeons, conhecendo o mundo ao seu redor, matando milhares de monstros (e esse número não é um exagero). Luta contra monstros únicos, lida com cenários que sempre mudam conforme a gameplay e por ai segue.

Tome possui gráficos bem simples, mas não se engane, esse é um rpg de alta qualidade, dificil e complexo.
Ele funciona em um sistema de turno, onde, dependendo da ação que você faz, um turno acontece. É uma dinâmica que eu gosto, mas sou suspeito por gostar do gênero.
Você tem centenas de builds possíveis por conta das centenas de variáveis que esse game possuí. Tu pode fazer um morto-vivo arqueiro, um anão rogue, um Halfling necromante. Enfim, opção é o que não falta.

Além disso, o game possuí uma boa história e dinâmica. Você acompanha tudo no meio da ação, tu vive a história conforme ela acontece e isso é um detalhe simples mas muito divertido. Exemplo disso é quando você entra em uma dungeon localizada na cidade dos anões e você vai acompanhando a história de um anão que nara sua história se tornando um monstro. Em outro exemplo, tu lê cartazes engraçados de um necromante lidando com seus minions. Onde todos cartazes começam com um energético: MY MINIONS.

Por enquanto eu tenho apenas o jogo base, e provavelmente estou longe de termina-lo. Eu acho incrível como a cara run eu aprendo mais e vou ficando cada vez melhor, indo cada vez mais longe. Ou seja, o game possuí um fator replay excelente.

Do meu ponto de visto, esse é um dos Rogue likes tradicionais mais acessíveis que há atualmente. No começo ele pode assustar, mas comparado a um ADOM, ele é muito mais noob friendly e você realmente consegue aprender com o tempo. Se quiser explorar esse gênero, recomendo começar por aqui.

O game é atulizado até hoje e possuí comunidade ativa em foruns e no canal do discord deles.

Por fim, existe um site oficial do Tome e vocês podem baixar o jogo de graça por la se estiver na dúvida. Recomendo baixar primeiro, experimente. Se curtir, compre e apoio o desenvolvedor. (Por sinal, ele sempre entra no chat global e conversa com os jogadores, eu tive essa experiencia pelo menos três vezes. E eu nunca tinha visto isso acontecer.)

Eu simplesmente não tenho como não recomendar Tome.",1585533759,1585533759,True,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What it may lack in terms of visual fidelity, Maj'Eyal easily makes up for in ambition. Here is a game you can play dozens of times, trying something new, discovering whole new ways to play the game—and break the game, and be broken by the game—each time.

The main appeal of Maj'Eyal is, I think, there sheer variety of potential character builds as well as the enormous repository of areas/worlds to explore and conquer—or, if I'm being totally honest, survive.

It all started with reading some Let's Plays of old classic roguelikes; Nethack, Angband, and Troubles of Middle Earth. Curiosity set in and these games are free to play, so I looked into the rebuilt ToME.

Holy crap! A roguelike with an interface? Graphics, music, and sound effects are just the icing on the game. I've played Dwarf Fortress for over a decade and I'll argue I'm still an utter newbie, that game has no UI, it's a pain in the ass to play. This game makes sense, you have a nice hotbar for all your skills, spells, and items. You can move with a click, inspect an enemy, cast said spells and whatnot with the right mouse.

So many class and race options. I've only unlocked three classes and I'm desperately looking for more. There's a bunch of different resources to keep your mages and druids from being the same guy with a different spellbook. I've really only scratched the surface of ToME's classes have to offer.

Simple as it may be, it's really a dungeon crawl for loot, I'm captivated. I get excited when I see good gear and let down when it's for other classes. 

Already bought the expansions. The free version had no problems being merged with the Steam release and all my progress was saved.

It's a game where one of my best characters died and my first response was to be mad because it was an unfair situation. Only to realize a few mintues later that I had options and tools I didn't use, that death was completely on me and I immediately dove back in on a new character.

Loot: This is/was probably my favorite part of the game.  No gripes there.

Controls and UI:  Pretty decent.  Easy to figure out and use.  No gripes.

Graphics: It's like an old-school roguelike but with higher resolution bitmap graphics instead of text-based/ASCII sprites.  It's so much like an old-school roguelike that you can actually play it in text/ASCII mode instead of bitmap mode.  I wish the sprites had animations for walking, idle, attacks, and extra sprite variations for the direction sprites are facing.  This is probably my biggest gripe.

Character progression: The character classes are very complex and there are so many classes, potentially overwhelming to new players.  I wish the character progression was metered a bit better, introducing smaller sets of skill selections and character progression relevant to as-you-go progression in the campaigns or maps.  I felt a bit of analysis paralysis when choosing how to allocate points.

Story: I didn't find the story in the campaigns especially immersive or engaging; a few walls of text here and there.  I didn't expect much or anything here, so I wasn't disappointed.",1584761304,1584805684,False,9,0,0.582499206066131592,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game requires massive dedication and an uncountable toll of death and loss, as with any roguelike worth its' salt. Once you understand the game's mechanics and flow, the amount of customization to each run is limitless and beautiful, and your ability to finagle your way out of every seemingly impossible situation will hit on an adrenaline rush like no other.  Much like Elite Dangerous, this is not a game for everybody, or even most people. But it is a game that everyone should try, to see if they have what it takes to become a Champion of Maj'Eyal and land a spot on those coveted leaderboards.

Tras mas de 800h y contando, sigo recomendando este JUEGAZO.

Tienes un montón de clases y builds de las mismas, razas, equipo, dificultades etc.. una vez te pasas las 2 dificultades ""tutoriales"" (normal y pesadilla) empieza el verdadero juego en Insane.. menuda experiencia, aprender paso a paso los entresijos del mismo es una delicia. 

El juego puedes probarlo en su pagina web (juego base) y ya si ves que te gusta, apoya con sus varios DLCs (expansiones), estos los recomiendo comprar si te gusta el juego y quieres apoyar al dev, añade mas contenido y desafios. 

De verdad es un pasote, dale un try, eso si.. mucha paciencia, pregunta por el chat in-game o Discord oficial, merece cada centavo y tiempo de tu vida. El dev actualiza cada X tiempo, con parches grandisimos y expansiones. (si te vas a anuncios, podras ver los planes que tiene para el juego, en el Discord podras ver sneak peaks de lo que tiene preparado etc).

En lo personal me ayuda bastante, ya que paso todo el tiempo en casa debido a una enfermedad desde hace años y esto es lo mejor que me pudo pasar.. Gracias Dark God y gracias a la comunidad.

After more than 800h and counting, I still recommend this GAME.

You have a lot of classes and builds of the same, races, equipment, difficulties modes etc ... once you pass the 2 difficulties ""tutorials"" (normal and nightmare) begins the real game in Insane ... what an experience, learn step by step the intricacies of it is a pleasure. 

You can try the game on their website (base game) + I recommend buying its various DLCs (expansions) if you like the game and want to support the dev, they adds more content and challenges. 

Srly is a great game, give it a try, but... you need a lot of patience, ask for help in-game chat or official Discord, it deserves every penny and time of your life. The dev updates every X time, with great patches and expansions (if you go to announcements of the game on Steam, you can see the plans he has for the game, in the Discord you can see sneak peaks of what he has prepared for years to come etc).

Pretty old-school Sega Dreamcast, ey?

Don't be fooled.  This is a a surprisingly well-developed and deeply-engaging game.

You'll die.  You'll lose characters you've invested some time in, and be frustrated by it.  You'll be penalized for taking one wrong step in a game where movement is deceptively casual.  You'll wonder why Maj'Eyal has gotten so many overwhelmingly positive reviews.

And then you'll find yourself coming back to it, over and over again...

This game can be played in short bursts or in huge life-wasting swaths of time.  The chat is surprisingly active, and it wont take long before you notice that developers appear in it.  Real-world holidays are often accompanied by in-game events (bonuses, opportunities to complete elusive achievements, etc).  While Maj'Eyal is a roguelike, there are modes for more casual gamers; modes which let you survive past the accidental deaths a few times (but not indefinitely).  You'll discover that talent synergy is a key component to surviving those deaths, such that gear (while important) takes a bit of a backseat.

The game is very obviously a labor of love.  It's updated and expanded by developers who enjoy doing so.  There's so much variety to the character creation / growth process that May'Eyal will seem almost endlessly replayable.

Plus, it's a huge entertainment value for the money.  You'll slowly find yourself willing to buy all the DLCs just to show support for the developers.

This game is full of varied, unique classes (my personal favorites are Anorithil, Doombringer, and the Chronomancer classes) each with unique skills (and weaknesses). Unlocking a paticular class can take time and effort, and after over 400 hours playtime I still has a few classes to unlock.

It furthermore solves many problems people thought were inherent to the roguelike genre.

1) ""Adventure mode"" gives you a very limited amount of resurrections. You get one additional life per 10 levels. This lets you make a few mistakes without losing a character, but still keeps the game hardcore.

2) Very visually expressive graphics... avoids the problem with ASCII-type roguelikes where you wonder ""WTF is an @?"" and then get killed randomly. Lightning bolts go off, zones of the map with some evil enchantment are clearly marked. Furthermore, has full mouse support so you can actually just mouseover anything and find out what it is. Customizable and very clear drag-and-drop UI. 

3) Tons of unlocks, some of which are easy and some of which are complicated and rare. This gives you goals beyond the simplistic ""Find the amulet of Yendor"" you see in most RLs. You actually get gains from each playthrough rather than starting from 0. In ways it feels like Tony Hawk Pro Skater (unlocking Rob Mullen is a joke, unlocking Darth Maul is damn hard).

4) Really diverse classes. A Possessor (possess monsters) plays completely differently than a Fighter, which plays completely differently from a Rogue. Position yourself, set traps, summon decoys... Lots of tactics beyond ""press 1 for this ability, press 2 for this ability"".

5) Excellent music.

I have been immersed in games my whole life and I've never seen anything that plays like the Temporal Warden - where games have traditionally balanced hybrid classes by penalizing their effectiveness at each, the developer (that's *the* developer, one guy) has managed to engineer a class that actively rewards you for switching between melee and ranged combat as frequently as possible without forcing your hand.

Also, in a genre full of ""bumping""-based combat with maybe an ability or two, ToME is refreshingly rich. You will have an MMO-style hotbar, and you will need multiple rows. It's surprising that other combat-heavy roguelikes haven't made similar strides towards engaging combat, but the developer again shows originality and mastery.

Did I mention the game is jam-packed with lore, in a surprisingly original setting? While the world of ToME might look like generic fantasy at first glance, it has a way of unfolding its setting and story to you, a layer at a time, like a slowly-blooming orchid. If you give the game time to get to know you, it will get delightfully weird once you're ready.

In fact, the entire game has that same unfolding quality - all the most interesting classes, races and ability trees are locked when you start out, and that's probably for the best. ToME is *enormously* complex, with a community just small enough to give you a general idea of how to build your character without keeping any important information fully up to date. The default classes will stretch you plenty, and by the time you unlock the truly unique options you'll be ready to wrap your head around ToME's mad genius. This game is far from solved, and the 1.6 update shook up the meta in a way that is either frustrating or exciting, depending on whether you like your puzzle boxes pre-opened. Luckily, all previous incarnations of the game are available for download and play, and the base game is completely free on the developer's website.

ToME is not for everyone. The UI is opaque, the mechanics are dense, and enemies are punishing. But ToME also wants you to figure out how it works. The default permadeath option gives you a limited number of ""lives"", perfect for giving you space to learn from your mistakes without compromising the tension roguelikes are founded on (yet another way the game stands head and shoulders above its competition), and the difficulty sets in gradually once you enter the midgame.

It is true that the 1.6.0 patch had indeed some scaling problems (thought not what you describe, level scaling ""now working like in Oblivion"" is false, it never changed how it works, there is a min & max per zone as it ever was and NPC skills have always scaled higher in talent levels than the player, because they don't have much equipment to compensate like the player do).
They have been and are being addressed with each of the next patches, same with the AI that was too good. For example the 1.6.6 release deeply altered how the AIs talk to one an other and how they try to find you so that it become much more fair.

In a more general context, I not only do listen to the community but I *enjoy* it, it has over the years been the source of many great improvements to the game and I intend to keep it that way :) Do I miss some feedback? For sure, I can only listen to so many people in the time I have, but I try to and all the 1.6.x releases should be proof as that as many of the highlighted problems has been looked at.

To finish, I want to make it clear that 1.6 however was simply too big (as I've already stated multiple times elsewhere), I crammed so many new things inside that it got out of hands and took a few patches to fix indeed. It was a mistake to do such a gigantic content patch and it most certainly will not happen again. So I'll keep doing like I've always done: making new free content updates, but I'll try to do them in smaller batches and more often instead :)

Review:
(Steam hours is nowhere near accurate)
When people talk about classic fantasy Roguelikes, theres two main ""branches"" 'hacks and 'angbands.  Out of those, theres two main games everyone who's into the genre considers the ""must owns"": ADoM and ToME. ADoM is a 'hack. ToME is an 'angband. They are different, so its hard to say one is ""better"" than the other. Both are amazing in their own right. I'm partial to 'hacks mechanics wise. But ToME is *the best* classic Roguelike out there as far as UI and depth. Great tiles, sounds, and the UI is *amazing*, with a webpage which logs all your stuff, a vault to keep items, multiple hotkeys, and in game chat so you can chat with other players (and it broadcasts your deaths and achievements too). Theres a zillion classes and races to unlock, amazing world lore, quests, multiple game settings - Dont like permadeath? Turn it off. Want multiple lives to give yourself a chance, but still permadiedie after they are used up? Straight permadeath? Difficulty sliders? Its all there.
This game is hands down amazing and everything awesome about a *real* roguelike, and thats even before you get the DLC expansions. If you at all like roguelikes, this is it - the cream of the crop of fantasy roguelikes. Get it. Right now.

About the microtransactions-
There was a big deal about ""microtransactions"" but there isnt actually microtransactions. DarkGod always accepted donations. Now you get a currency in return for them, which you can use to buy future DLC, cosmetics, let everyone play a special zone, unlock more vault slots. Basically, its as it always was, but now when you donate, you get something in return. Believe me, I'd be the first to be screaming if there was actually real microtransactions - but this is just a way to say ""Thanks for supporting ToME"" from the dev himself. Its not microtransactions the way most people think of them.",1578541266,1578541266,True,2,0,0.54666668176651001,0,True,False,False,False,,,

''This game is a roguelike'' - yes. In practice this means you will start a run, set a goal, die for no particular reason and with no particular lesson learned, and be expected both to repeat the process and to enjoy it. What on earth?

''This game is continually actively developed'' - so don't get too attached to any particular class or game feature, because it will probably be changed beyond all recognition or removed entirely. My favourite is the item for Necromancer that forces you to wait 30+ seconds of real time for it to recharge if you want to play optimally.

''This game has a great community'' - I'm unconvinced. It seems to contain the same mix you'd find most places on the internet - some people are friendly and helpful, some are arrogant and argumentative. There are better, healthier ways to make friends.

''This game has great lore and storytelling'' - It's pretty good if you like to read about horrible things being done to people. I don't. Also some of it is at best old-fashioned in its view of women and at worst misogynistic.

Finally, this game is surprisingly laggy considering it's turn-based and tile-based and the graphics and animations are nothing exciting. I've had games with physics engines run far better.

TL;DR: Game is an infuriating, bleak, laggy mess. Would not recommend.

I know my review is not very in-depth, but these are the reasons why I love it. I never cared much for rogue-like games, but this game really feels like it is the king of the genre. It is so much fun to play because of many characters I can create and the levels of difficulty I can adjust. Yet there is substance in the game as you play through story and tons of items to collect, enhance, sell and explore.",1578038901,1578038901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Allow me to explain.

ToME is heavily based on a game called Angband, which is both free and also quite old, dating back to the mid-1990s. It makes a bunch of changes to streamline Angband's core gameplay loop: Angband had a lot of grinding and also some really crap things the RNG could do to you, like disenchanting your weapons or draining experience on hit. They also took out things like potions, wands, and spellbooks - these were all mostly survivability options that got destroyed if you were hit by magic, which could be game-ending solely based on that and let to a lot of dumb behaviors like dropping all of your stuff at the start of a level.

The positives it has over Angband are numerous: the first is the streamlining, while the second is the addition of a mode in which permadeath doesn't exist - either you have a limited number of lives or an unlimited number, which prevents you losing simply because the RNG generated an enemy that instakilled you. There's also the fact that you're guaranteed access to all of your class's core abilities without needing to find certain items to learn them (this was one reason why magic users were basically non-viable in Angband).

Now, here's the bad part: for whatever godforsaken reason, the developers decided to put in an unlock system and lock about 75% of the character classes and racial options behind it, which can make or break viability for a lot of builds. The best example I can give is the Archmage class, which is one of the first classes you're likely to unlock. Archmages right now are basically non-viable past a certain point unless you also unlock a bunch of skill trees for them (unlockable skill trees basically only apply to the Archmage) that require an insane amount of grinding. 

Another problem I have is that the game.. has character builds. The problem is that each class really has one or two viable builds (if that) and doing anything but the most viable build is a one-way ticket to losing. The problem is that a lot of the viable builds require unlocks, usually of a particular racial option. I kind of wish that builds weren't a thing, because all it really does is restrict you to using the developer's forums to look up what the most viable build is. I get that not every build can be necessarily viable, but it seems like an extra wall to new players where a set progression tree would be much easier.

Overall, I think I could only recommend this game if you're a hardcore Nethack or Angband/Zangband fan, and even then it might be better to try those first.",1578017143,1578456229,False,3,3,0.470919489860534668,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Honestly I put off trying it for a long time due to how basic it looks in the screen shots above but once you start playing it actually grows on you really quickly. 
Tiles are easy to distinguish, spell/ability effects look nice, attack sounds are satisfying, monsters and areas are varied, lots of ways to adjust your build with random skills gained from quests, items and magic tattoos without being overwhelming or redundant.

If you are on the fence you can download the full base version FOR FREE on the developers website, it only takes like ~2 minutes to download the full game.

If you could just start the game, make a new character (no matter the class/race/campaign), save and exit and then send me the te4_log.txt file from the game's install folder; I should have the infos needed to find out what's wrong and help you fix it.

Again I repeat, this is obviously not normal and there is no way this can't be fixed, so help me help you please :)

Thanks

PS: You can upload the file well, anywhere, and send me the link through the contact form on te4.org"

First off there is mechanical detail everywhere you look in your stats, skills, and abilities. I've played as mostly some of what I'm assuming are newer DLC classes? The Doombringer, Writhing, Possessed, Alchemist, and an Archer.

Combat is intense, choices are hard, the map is gigantic and as I approach near level 10-12 in a playthrough I see gear starting to evolve that I can barely get my hands on. 

There is no spamming magic potions, hope you inscribed some defensive/healing abilities or found some charms, or gear that can save your ass. Defensive utilities are a must to survive this game!

All sorts of fun abilities like having a tentacle for an arm, a magical golem that you can equip with gear. HELL EVEN A MASS OF WORMS IS MY SUMMON... but wait, hes humanoid and walking and has his OWN gear slots? and I can take control of him?

Traps, dungeons, an overworld to explore and a TON of classes I am yet to unlock. I hear rumors of time manipulation, I see skills and prodigies of great power I'm nowhere near achieving. I look forward to many more hours in this game and I'll update this review as I play it more.

I was right, but the complexity (and difficulty) was ramped up to 11. This game will bash in your skull from the start. Then it will beat you into submission once you get comfortable.

There are so many points of praise for this game, but I'll start with the developer Darkgod. A true legend, oversees the game, constantly makes balance changes, reads the forums, and makes a real effort. This has to be my #1 reason for why this game is great. It's a work of love and dedication.

The content of this game is deceptively deep. At first you'll have a couple basic classes: some warriors, rogues, an alchemist class, but that's about it. On your first couple playthroughs that will change quickly. You can pick up all sorts of other classes. But the real beauty of it is that not only does each class play inherently different, most usually have several ways to play them. The rogue for example, you can run a sneaky assassin type, or a throwing knife, trap dropping, poison applying trickster. Or something in between, whatever floats your boat. My friend suggested using heavy armour and forgoing mobility for defense. TRY ALL THE CLASSES.

The lore is unbelievable. There is so much lore. You'll pick up a scroll and suddenly be assaulted with a wall of text. Some people might get annoyed, but it's not like you have to read it, you can just skip it (what a shame though). The unique items all have unique descriptions, bosses all have unique descriptions, even regular stuff has flavour text.

The achievement list is massive, toting a whopping total of 1700+, but they're mostly duplicates from 6-8 different difficulties. Not that there aren't 200+ unique ones anyway. The flavour text on them is pretty funny too, and some of them are really no joke.

I guess if I'm going to give the downsides, the obvious one is the graphics are very retro-esque. Simple. If that turns you away I'm sorry to hear that. The sprites are impressively complex, and the animations are satisfying most of the time.

The second downside is how difficult the game is for beginners in the genre of strategy, turn-based roguelikes. I came in as a newbie and it ate me up. I'm thankful I stuck with it. There is a lot to learn about strategies and builds that work in this game. All I can offer is try all the dumb sh*t you can think of until something works. 

If a 95% review rate doesn't sell you after all this, let me offer you a story.

My latest run was a run of desperation. I recently built a new computer, but that meant that when I booted ToME, I had lost all of my characters. I was sad, but I figured it wouldn't take too long to unlock a character I'd like to play more, so I booted up a Thalore Berserker. Very basic. I played for about an hour, going decently, running a crit-based build. Next time I logged in the characters were all fixed so I could use all the classes I had before, but I kept with the berserker thinking, ""may as well play this out to see where it goes"". I pick up a couple items with high resistances, I learn a couple skills from escort missions (importantly lots of mobility), and then I pick up a prodigy (high power talents, you only get 2 per character) for my dash that lets me hop around on the battlefield quickly and violently. This quickly gets out of hand. I'm suddenly in the second half of the game, and find that my character has 50% damage reduction to all damage. This was my most recent winning run, out of seemingly the most basic class, I played it a way I thought was mostly a meme, and took it all the way. I did however lose the character trying to complete the 500 enemies of the sludgenest, since that challenge gets way out of hand very quickly.

Excuses aside I still suck at this game, and have only beaten it 4 times at the time of this review. (489 hours)

Also you don't have to pay for the game, you can get it for free from the website. https://te4.org/download (just google it if you don't trust the link) The cost that you're paying from steam is the ""donator"" benefits, which aren't a lot, some cosmetics, some item vault slots (which are only available after you're about 2/5ths of the way through the game if you can find it :) ) and a class I think? But I've never regretted it, and there's no other dev that deserves the money as much as Darkgod does.

It was a character graphics Angband variant set in Middle Earth, with a cool magic and skill system. I went many years without playing it, but happily picked up the Donator Edition here on Steam simply to support many hours of quality dungeon crawling in the past.

It took me a few hours to get to what makes ToME 4 so creative and expansive and cool. At first it felt a little clunky, with early maps mostly full of wolves and bears. But once I got a character up to around level 5-8 and started opening the skill tree, it got harder to put down. Even basic fighty types have a good assortment of moves to combo and buffs/debuffs, and some of the more exotic classes get pretty creative (like Alchemist, which has a full suite of pyromancy tools, itemcrafting skills, and an upgradable golem servitor).

Permadeath is how I've always played roguelikes, but if that's not your thing there is a gentler ""Adventurer"" difficulty with multiple lives, or a unlimited life ""Explorer"" mode. There's also multiple difficulties (which I think populates easier/harder monsters).

I was happy to discover the world of ToME 4 wasn't just a bland M*ddle E*rth with the trademarks filed off. The lore of Eyal is colorful, creative, and sometimes takes genuinely surprising turns. I've learned about a half-deaf (from explosions) halfling alchemist, a necromancer forcing his undead minions to enter a poetry contest, and gotten fashion assistance from a tentacled alien hologram. Eyal is a fun place to explore without getting mired in silliness — it's not super serious, but it maintains a cool pop-fantasy-horror-scifi sensibility.

ToME's difficulty curve can be, let's say old school. Things can go from trivial to OH NO within a couple of steps. You cannot just click an arrow key against a pack of monsters, this is a game that expects you to use all the tools at your disposal. I've had good runs come to an end REAL fast, but looking at it afterwards I've always been able to identify things I could have done better or more carefully.

Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup might be the best-balanced modern roguelike, which is important for a competitive community, but ToME has its own thing, an open world / sightseeing aspect, and the relatively slower pacing of the early game gives it kind of a Sims feel almost.

Je ne dis pas cela en paroles en l'air. Je parle en connaissance de cause puisque plutôt fan du genre et avec des milliers de jeux, et Maj'Eyal, un jeu que j'avais abordé pour ensuite y revenir, n'a jamais eu son pareil en matière de richesse.

Le jeu se déroule en ""tour par tour en pause active"". C'est-à-dire que le monde s'anime et les monstres se déplacent dès que vous accomplissez des actions. Le jeu gère d'ailleurs très bien un système de vitesse capable de vous faire exécuter plusieurs actions avant que les monstres ne jouent les leurs, comme vous le verrez par exemple si vous jouez un Chronomancien (des sortes de combattant agissant en créant des paradoxes, comme dans l'univers de Matrix).

Vous pouvez jouer à la campagne principale, ou débloquer d'autres modes de jeu comme l'arène ou le donjon infini. Chaque mode recèle ses propres dangers.

En matière de roguelike, les modes exploration (sans mort permanente) sont disponibles (avec des succès propres !) et le mode normal lui, avec sa mort permanente, est présent mais avec plusieurs vies, ce qui est très adapté au style de jeu. En effet, si vous tombez sur plus fort que vous en prenant trop de risques, c'est très agréable de pouvoir reprendre et mieux gérer ! Et pour les plus durs à cuire, le full hardcore est aussi là.

Même si le jeu n'est pas multijoueur, il l'est tout de même, puisque vous pouvez parler à un tas de joueurs depuis le chat international ingame. Plus amusant encore, les morts de tous les joueurs et les succès exceptionnels sont annoncées hauts en couleur sur ce canal, avec de petites tournures drôles.  

Les races et classes de personnage sont nombreuses, on peut jouer des mort-vivants différents, des elfes ou nains classiques, des démons, toutes sortes de choses. Mon dernier aventurier est un Champion Squelette maniant épée et bouclier, et ayant appris un tout petit peu de magie.

Mais surtout, toutes les classes du jeu sont extrêmement détaillées. 

C'est même un modèle du genre avec une exploration de compétences variées réellement propres au thème de la classe, et très efficaces mécaniquement.

Tales of Maj'Eyal est un modèle de game design mais aussi un modèle de suivi par le développeur.  Vous ne serez pas déçu !

Vous y découvrirez votre propre forteresse, le cube de transformation qui fonctionne automatiquement et vous permet de ne jamais être encombré par le loot, et toute l'histoire du jeu. Par contre, vous serez peut-être intimidé par le nombre de choix possibles, ou la difficulté du jeu par moments. 

Essayons de brosser tout de même quelque défauts :

Le look du jeu est très adapté en somme, mais n'est pas le plus vendeur visuellement.
Le jeu contient d'innombrables bons écrits, et des quêtes intéressantes comme celles des Alchimistes, mais l'histoire principale n'est pas toujours engageante.

Les équipements finissent par procurer des effets de dégâts arc-en-ciel (càd de tous types de dégâts) et on ne gère plus vraiment le type de dégâts que l'on cause. On ne s'y intéresse plus trop. De même, résister à un type de dégât précis n'a d'importance réelle que contre certains boss. Pour moi cela contribue à moins apprécier le loot. Cela manque aussi de set items. 

A un certain stade du jeu vous trouverez ça trop difficile, jusqu'à bien maîtriser certains aspects. Ensuite, il est possible que cela soit un peu trop répétitif.

Cependant le jeu arrivera souvent à vous placer dans cette ""zone de décision"", là où vous êtes seul à gérer votre risque, le combat actuel, utilisant vos différents tampons et skills pour occire les ennemis les plus dangereux, ou vous enfuir; que ce soit via un town portal, ou en vous rendant invisible, ou en traversant les murs... tout est possible ici !

Cons:
-Balance can be weird, classes with innate regen and/or AoE dominate, while classes without like Rogus and Rangers kinda suck

You can play one class in many ways, which gives you alot of replayability, and talking about replayability.. randomized loot, enemies, layouts.. and you can unlock f tons of new classes and races by playing, or if you feel lazy, just grab unlock all classes/races from steam workshop.

IF YOU BUY THE DLC YOU CAN BE A SKELETON WITH A TENTACLE ARM AND BARF BLOOD ALL OVER YOUR ENEMIES AND HAVE A BUDDY MADE OF WORMS

it's a roguelike. but it's a better one than most of the ones that get on here.

if you're worried about difficulty, don't be, there's several game modes and permadeath options, including explorer which straight up gives you infinite lives, though i prefer adventure which just gives you a life every couple of experience levels. 

the game itself is fun. there's a variety of classes that play differently, and you can play them in different ways. you can unlock new classes and races by playing the game. It's a roguelike, but things like scrolls and potions have been cut out and replaced with ""infusions"" that are tattooed on to your characters skin and can be reused. you'll still find random loot but generally you'll find useful things, and theres stores to buy things from too. don't worry about being stuck in store menus for ages selling everything you found, you can choose what things you found to keep, and the rest are automatically turned into gold when you change areas. the game's developers seem to really hate grinding, so once you go through an area, that's basically it, you're not getting more enemies. if there's something you don't like, the game has a lot of add-ons and modifications players made for you to find in the workshop, which are definite quality of life additions worth looking through. i definitely recommend ""escorts enhanced"" because there are nine random escort missions with great rewards and they're really hard to do without it since they'll move forward with considerable disregard for actually being safe if you don't ""escorts enhanced.""

the lore is pretty cool too, so that's nice.

I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with a fondness for ""classic"" rougelikes.

More legitimate pros I can number are:
-no tedious systems like hunger or ammo count
-a wide selection of exotic classes and races (no boring pick between 3 archetypes every single fantasy game sees)
-control over difficulty (suitable for both those who want hardcore difficulty or a leisure experience)
-good lore
-replayability (see the previous list of classes and races, plus a long chain of patches that kept things fresh for years)
-majority of content is available for free
-no pay2win (the game depends on donations, which can net you cosmetic bonuses and nothing else)

As for the cons:
-roguelike

I am aware that the genre isn't for everyone, and that is fine. I just hope the game recieves the recognition it deserves- the people working on it are passionate, especially the dev, and have stuck to working on it for a couple years now. The players are all welcoming and helpful, and make good addons (mods) on top of that.

Play in the mode it's meant to be played in (rogue) and expect at a minimum 80-100 hours before you finish it. The first time; With one race/class combo.  You unlock other playable classes as you go along and it's a really nice touch and doesn't limit the game because you will still be trying to finish it on your first class. After all that there is still nightmare, insane, and madness rogue difficulties.

 There are also easier modes to those new to the genre where you can get extra lives and dead doesn't meant dead if that sort of thing interests you.  

Something I didn't see mentioned when I was scanning through the reviews before I bought the game was that even though it's a single player game, there is an in game chat that not only allows people playing to interact if they wish, but also displays when someone dies (showing their level, class, and where), along with when someone gets an achievement, and allows item posting.

Now realize I played the free version of this game outside of steam for over a year before i bought it, and frequently after that in various places where it is inconvenient to sync my steam account, probably doubling that number.  This is, simply, undeniably, a fantastic game.  For the price ( >75% of the content is FREE) there is none better in the lexicon of gaming, certainly within the genre, and arguably anywhere.

Why is it so addictive and delightful?  It is, at its heart, a tactical decision making game.  You pick a class and build its talents and gearset to accumulate resources that allow you to win battles.  The game throws randomly generated (within a predictable subset, for the campaign, or truly random, if you unlock that feature) dungeons at you to challenge your build and your skills at resource management.  I could gush endlessly about the finely-tuned balance, about how every class has multiple viable builds presenting you with playstyle variety galore, and about the fascinating and challenging enemies and lore to spice up the indefinitely variable tactical puzzles presented by combat -- but that would take way too long.

Instead, I'll just end with this:

Randomly bumbling into an extremely challenging tactical situation where your death is nearly assured is honestly chilling and gut-wrenching, especially in a game you have already spent 5+ hours progressing through, much less one where you are 20 hours in and nearly done with the campaign.  Multiply that extensively if you are in rogue-like mode and won't get another chance should you die.  Commensurate with that tension--taxing your tactical skills to the limit, squeezing out every resource of your build and inventory and then overcoming certain death by the seat of your pants brings a rush of victory like little else I have felt in all my years of gaming.  Even when you lose, there is enduring additional entertainment to be had from reviewing where you went wrong, kicking yourself for mismanaging your resources, and developing ever more-detailed strategies to get you further on your next run.  And this entertaining strategy-building is PER CLASS.  This game has 30+ CLASSES.

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tactical thinking.  It is the only game I played longer than World of Warcraft.  It is the only game I've ever played that I loved so much, I was legitimately angry it didn't cost more, and sent the developer an extra donation in gratitude for innumerable hours of enjoyment.",1572574958,1572574958,True,34,0,0.784143328666687012,0,True,False,False,False,,,

TL:DR - buy this game. Right now: There's a huge variety in builds that can keep you entertained for hours, the writing is good, the game-play is challenging and fun, and oh boy will you get hooked

I could go on and on about ToME, I've played nearly 100 hours. But I think I can sum my love of this game up best with a simple story:

My first character who got even remotely good was a brawler. I was enjoying the heck out of playing him. He was super powerful, a veritable one man army. Played for many hours, got all the way through the story, got to the VERY FINAL ENDGAME FIGHT.

Died.

Like a chump. Wasted, barely even scratched the Big Bad.

I was devastated - it felt like a kick in the stomach, I was so invested in this character, all the unique and rare artefacts they'd gathered. And now they were dead. Rogue-like-deleted-save-dead.

And then I had to go to bed for work, so I did... 

But I couldn't sleep, because I was plotting my revenge.

So I went to work the next day, ridiculously tired...

And plotted my revenge some more.

Then I got home, and I put all that plotted desire for vengeance into building a pure, rage-fuelled abomination of a rogue-like machine character - and I went through the game again, having a harder time because instead of spec'ing power at that moment, my every choice was dedicated to killing the Big Bad. I played like a demon, until I got back to that final Big Bad Boss Chamber, and I still had a tough fight, and with maybe 4 HP remaining out of several thousand, I beat them to death with my specially crafted Beating The Boss To Death weapon. And I felt so much vindicated joy it was like my first play-through of Dark Souls all over again, but with the added knowledge that I didn't have infinite lives to bash against the brick wall head first. I'd beaten them fair and square with my limited supply of chances and it felt amazing.

The moral of this story? I was so invested in this game, I spent a full day and night plotting revenge against a robot for ""killing"" the maybe-30mb text file that was my last character. And I enjoyed every second of it.

That kind of immersion doesn't come along every day.

Buy this game.

ToME is a deep, technical and complex true rogue-like. There's a ton of lore, a ton of classes and a ton of achievements, all of them accomplishments. The 1700+ achievements are not spam, there's just that much to do. There are several difficulty options, a lot of races and classes, plus you are given the ability to make an adventurer class after beating the game on normal difficulty -- handing you the power to make a truly powerful or weird gimmicky character. 

There are 2 campaigns, many things to unlock, from extra classes, to races and talent trees; and a lot of ways to play the game. All the DLCs add great content and the devs/mods are great. 1.6 just launched at the time of writing this review, and the game is still being updated and going strong after several years. Dev darkgod is always working on things, and the community is small but active. (It's a fully single player classic rogue-like rpg, but there is a general chat for all things ToME and its pleasant and helpful towards new and experienced players alike).

I'm almost at 700 hours playtime at the time of writing this, and I fully expect to play 700 more. One of my all time favorite games, and one I always eventually return to. Its hard as nails, a bit confusing at first and definitely niche, but is obviously a huge labor of love and is a world that rewards you for your time invested in playing it. I'm still learning new approaches and coming up with different strategies this late in. 

And maybe one day I'll beat Madness difficulty... or just die trying. A lot.

Edit: I still haven't beaten Madness but I haven't been playing that setting at all. I have gotten a couple of Insane roguelike wins under my belt, though. And I've also nominated this game for the 2023 steam awards under the ""labor of love"" category as it most certainly is — and the magic still hasn't worn off for me as I check back in at almost 2,000 hours clocked now.

A hidden gem & better than FTL.
Looks horrible but is fun to play.  Is designed & works surprisingly well for a Rogue RPG hybrid.  The creator took a lot of lessons learned from similar games and stuffed them neatly into this title.  I feel bad for how little i payed & will probably pick up the DLC / other titles.

An enormous game that, even after playing tens of hours, I barely feel I've dipped my toes into. I really like the combination of grid-based roguelike mechanics with more modern RPG spells/skills and loot, it's a winning formula. The only thing that tempers my enthusiasm a little is the way enemies are thrown at you in massive hordes. Where most traditional roguelikes use fewer, more deadly enemies to make you exercise extreme caution, Maj'Eyal can feel almost like a musou game at times with how many weaker enemies will swarm you. This makes for a sometimes awkward dynamic where you want to be careful and put thought into every move (it's still very challenging), but the amount of ability spam you have to use to clear out groups of enemies can very easily lead to carelessness. I've often found myself pinned into a corner by weak enemies while a tougher boss creature pelts me from afar, which can be frustrating.

This isn't necessarily a negative point, just something to be aware of, especially for people who've played and enjoyed traditional roguelikes before. Still really enjoyable, regardless.",1572050992,1572050992,True,4,0,0.548723340034484863,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Game has it is own setting. It is high fantasy world mixed with lots of stuff like steampunk and [spoiler] psycology [/spoiler]. Most things you'll encounter are very generic, like orcs, elfes, dragons, righteous paladins, vile mages. And then you run into a ninja-gunsliner-treant, bear psychic or slime demonologist. Main plot is also typical for high fantasy. Most of the lore you encounter is contained within books or scrolls which you can find in shops or in dungeons. 
Interface is very customizable. Game mechanics are easy to learn, not so easy to master. There is decent amount of different stats and charachteristics. Some of them are a bit vague, but you can always ask in game chat what a specific stat does, how it stacks or when it caps. People often help with advice, but generally chat is slow, unless dev joins. Which happens unsually often compared to any other game. When present, dev also can directly act upon gameplay, adding events or giving you 10 turns of invulnerability for no reason. Is patched and has updates from time to time. ToME's sound and graphics are simple. 
Game has very adjustable difficulty. If you have never tried a roguelike I am encouragin you to make it your first one, gameplay isn't that oldschool. There are many classes to choose from (35 classes), they differ very much from each other and the same class can have several ways of playing. Every class is deeply thought out. 16 races with upsides and downsides.  Most of them are closed when you start, so there are META-GOALS, you can progress by opening new classes and races. Loot variety is also good, you can find all kinds of stuff. Lots of unique gear too, which can change the style of play. Game is close to being perfect for anyone who likes replayability. What I dislike personally is that every run you have to run into same dungeons almost in the same order. There is also a feeling that much more endings are intended. Endless mode map variety is poor. Enemy variety is very low if you don't have DLCs. Mix ToME's gameplay with Dungeon Crawl stone soup dungeons variety and it is perfect.

I'm personally not keen on the art style having been more used to ascii, but the spell graphics are super pretty.

it removes the normal boring jobs of scroll, potion and loot management, with cooldowns for the former two and at the end of each map screen converting unwanted items into gold without the need to wander back to town sell, top up on supplies and come back, I find this streamlined approach much better for the player in keeping up with the sense of exploration and discovery

It's worth noting there isn't a progression system to make following tries easier, by unlocking a new super weapons that can be spawned for example. But new character classes are unlocked as you play through and hit different conditions (a couple irritating).

The biggest criticism is the artwork. While it isn't terrible it is perhaps showing it's age. But it's easy to overlook once you get playing. Also on low-end systems performance can to be an issue. Things can slow down especially when playing a long session, requiring a game restart to return to normal.

It is a hard but rewarding game that you can easy sink 100s of hours into. It has lots of classes to try and master with interesting lore to read, it all that makes this one of my favourite games.

It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're interested in this sort of game, I can't see why you wouldn't like it.

If the gameplay videos haven't turned you off, you can download and play a free version of the game from its official website.  The free version is quite extensive, the only things it truly lacks aside from all of the DLC content are modes and features that make the game easier (Exploration mode, which gives you infinite lives without restricting your ability to unlock new classes and races, and the item vault, which lets you save and transfer items between characters), unlockable cosmetic options and a single class (possessor).  I personally played the free version for upwards of 60 hours, unlocking all non-DLC content before deciding to buy the game.

The game itself is extremely replayable, more so than any other game I've played.  There are an absurd number of classes, each of which has multiple builds.  Even with simple classes, like berserker and bulwark, there are extremely important decisions to make.  Do you want to go anti-magic and lose access to a number of useful items in exchange for an extremely useful skill tree?  Which category do you want to unlock first?  What race are you, and whats the best way to exploit your racial skill tree with your chosen class?  All that combined with the standard roguelike random loot ensures that your runs, even with the exact same class will be wildly different from one another.  If you find the game engaging at the start you'll probably still be engaged 50+ hours later and then will randomly come back in a few months only to get hooked again.  Or at least that's how it usually works for me.

I heavily recommend checking out the free version if the game seems at all interesting, then coming back and buying the steam version + DLC's if you like it.  The DLC's are all really good, by the way.  Plus they give you more item vault space, which is nice.",1561958320,1561958320,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It also has a heavy focus on unlockable options that you can earn through gameplay and achievements meaning even if your character doesn't beat the game (very expected for new players even on the easiest difficulties) their death can still have meaning unlocking new classes or races or other options for your next character. It also has other misc features like being able to chat with anyone else currently playing the game sometimes including developers and player deaths being broadcasted to others also playing but these features are optional and can be turned off if preferred but there are a couple of exclusive events for being online. Despite these features the game isn't an MMO by any means and you won't interact with other people besides the simple chatroom... besides maybe Darkgod (the main dev) messing around with your character occasionally. (Nothing harmful, only funny jokes or helpful buffs.) The game also has a... smorgasbord of achievements especially at first glance but many of the achievements are the same except on a different difficulty or mode. 

Overall the game is quite great especially if you want a more story based and interesting roguelike that isn't just a standard dungeon crawl however due to the game's more story based nature it can be quite disheartening when you die and have to repeat the same story beats but it is a bit more forgiving than other roguelikes in that there are modes where you have a limited number of lives or even an infinite number of lives (however you can't unlock things in the ladder) but the good ol' one death and you die still always exists for the more hardcore out there. Speaking of which there is also a variety of difficulty options separate from permadeath options but again no unlocking things on easy mode. I also want to commend this game's classes, there's a large variety and many have unique and interesting mechanics and play completely differently from each other. Lastly there is also steam workshop support with a small variety of mods to choose from but a couple of really good ones. There's also more mods on the game's website.

If you still aren't convinced you can actually play the base game for free from the developer's website but it will be missing donator features such as infinite lives mode, the adventurer class after beating the game, some classes, customization options, and other small misc things. That's what you are actually technically buying on steam, the donator features, but I recommend buying the game on steam anyway because the game is good and the developer deserves your money especially considering it is only $7 when it isn't on sale or even buying the game off of the website instead if you prefer no DRM.",1561852206,1561852206,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Everything is usable with the mouse, UI is straightforward, inventory management is simplified, the setting is familiar, visuals are serviceable and gear stats, classes and skills are for the most part easy to understand. You can expect a plethora of varied classes, each with many possible builds, an array of legendary items with special effects, secrets to discover and lore to find.

There is a ton of replayability, but for how long it'll stay interesting varies from person to person. The campaigns do have randomly generated layouts of the combat areas, but their theme and order will always remain the same. Eventually you might start to notice the biggest problem I have with the game, and that is the pacing. After a few runs you will start to perceive long stretches of the game where you're just mowing through weak common mobs without a real challenge. Rarely, but certainly at least once in a run, the game's random miniboss generator will spit out a very broken monster at this time that can and will wipe you out within a few turns if you're not careful, which after a time you certainly won't be as these parts are long and unengaging, meaning you'll probably end up mashing buttons to get through. It is for this reason that I'd recommend playing with the multiple lives option rather than one life only, as these deaths feel very cheap. As a sidenote, the game does offer an arena or endless dungeon mode.

That said, this problem - and the other issues the game has, especially the very poor class balance, should only start to bother you dozens of hours in. The game is still receiving expansions, free balance updates and has regular events. If you're on the fence, the free vanilla version is available on the official website.

The developers interact with the community a decent amount and support the game heavily. (even doing server-wide events that can effect any save loaded at the time - example that I witnessed in my most recent run: A unique dungeon caled the Lost Land of Poosh, atleast iirc thats what it was called...)

We recently got teased an upcoming expansion being in development, and even though microtransactions ARE coming, it's literally only cosmetics and PAYING FOR THE GODS TO COME KILL YOUR CHARACTER along with paying to cause those events to happen at your will - supposedly for the whole server!

The free version is on te4.org as you can go there and try the game with around 95% content FOR FREE, excluding the following: Possessor Class. Anything added by DLC. Item Vault Slots to transfer items between characters with 1 hour delay before able to withdraw. (The full bundle on steam comes with 12 slots when I bought it, not sure if it'd scale up or down depending on current price as I did so when it was on sale. Site says 2€ = 1 slot though for donations, ontop of providing 10 silver coins per 1€ to spend on the game / DLC / etc.) Shimmering Mirror! (Alter visuals of any worn item to another of the same type) Custom Tiles! (look on the site's donation section for more info on this)
Note: If you're going through the site for these purchases, the cost is 24€ for the full package from my understanding. 60 coins for the donor perks, 40 for ashes, 70 for embers, 70 for forbidden cults. So I'm pretty sure the slots are fixed rate. Slots have no extra cost from what I've seen.

It took me nearly a hundred hours in order to get my first win, going through several dozen characters. That win was on the DLC campaign from Embers, so I'm now working on getting through the regular campaign & unlocking the rest of the stuff.

Oh, and I nearly forgot to write this down: This game has mod support! (Called Addons) - You can either go through the steam workshop (which may be missing some from non-steam users) or you can go through the te4.org site for them. If you're going through the site, I'd advise browsing to it from ingame browser for simplifying the install, as the download link in the ingame browser for the addons auto-installs it for you. Addons only apply on newly made characters, to prevent any conflicts. This also applies for when disabling them, however you can completely remove it from your files if you need to on the fly. (Note in several cases doing this will cause other issues most of the time, ranging from just minor errors to making the save essentially corrupted - This is part of why they set it up where it only naturally adds or removes addons for NEW characters.)

The game involves exploring generated zones, killing monsters with skills, looting, building your character and going as far you can until you inevitably get slapped from the shadows. There are A LOT of classes and a lot of different race/class combinations with skill trees you can opt in/out of for a HUGE amount of build possibilities. You can play a standard archer/beserker class or play a Saw butcher which will have you cosplaying sonic while you rip your foes apart.

It will make you angry and annoyed, worse than Darkest Dungeon but it is not really RNG based you just get fucked by monsters you weren't ready for.

I still know barely anything about the game either so I hang out in the discord which is very active and helpful. People in their know everything so I highly advise joining it to learn the game. Also you don't need the DLCs to have a billion hours of gameplay.

So I just finished this game. After 44 hours of glorious and stuipid deaths of my characters, I finally did it. My halfiling brawler sacreficed himself in the process, but I was still really happy. .But that's not the end. It's the opposite - I'm going to buy every expansion there is going to be, and I'm going to try every class and every race possible. Because it's just so COMPLEX and FUN at the same time. Honestly, i just feel overwhelmed by the amount of things i can do here. 

[b]I'll list some of most important PROS and CONS here ( in my opinion of course ) : [/b]
+ LORE - usually comes in a form of small notes left on the floor of dungeons. It's great, because at first, when I was concerned only about being better at slashing my opponents, I could just skip it effortlesly and go on. But when i finally started reading them, I was just in awe. Everything was written well, an it was a JOURNEY. Really, I just spent my day thinking about how unfairly orcs have been treated, and how complex their situation is. I don't want to spoil anything - but just read anything that regards orcs. It's a great story. There were many others obvously, some made me laugh, and some made sad. 
+ CONTENT - There is just soooo much of it. To put it simple  : Just one class can be quite complex. Finding some combos, and exploiting them is really fun, and there are several in each class. Combine it with races ( which often have their own skill trees ) and many MANY items, and you will just always learn something new about this game. 

+ UNLOCK SYSTEM : most of the game classess and races were locked for me in the begining. But unlocking them often came naturaly, because I was curious about some book and read it, or just stumbled across some necromancer and killed him. It didn't feel as a chore, it actually felt quite rewarding. 

+ THEY CARE ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE : I will explain this by showing an example. I breached some infamous orcish armory. In most of the games, the armory would be just 5 racks of weapons and 2 crates of unusable junk. Here, i just saw like 100-200 items i could get. Many of them were really good. It felt real, it was not only some stupid armory i have to clear, it was  [i][b]THE ORCISH ARMORY[/b][/i]

+ AND MANY OTHERS ... 

[b]But now CONS. Not many, and minor, but still [/b]
- BALANCE : I just feel like some classes are far better than others. I just defeated end game boss ( lvl. 75 ) with my 
( lvl. 42 ) Halfling Brawler. Meanwhile, playing rogue or summoner, I had trouble fighting many enemies on my lvl. Maybe I'm just bad at them, or I didn't unlock a important skill tree yet. 

- BALANCE OF ENEMIES : any character i created had problem with ranged minons. Especially casters. They can deal a LOT more damage than mele fighters, while pinning and freezing from safe distance. If you overcome those CC, they will just teleport away. That were usually intense and epic battles, especially with caster bosses, but I feel like melee minions in end game need a little bit of buff to be treated seriously. 

- NOT TOO MUCH CONVERSASION : i just feel like NPC in this world are too few. Yeah they were fun to talk to, some of them were quite unique. But there were maybe like 20 of them, that you could talk to during the playthrough. I would like to for example chat with the ""Master"" - a Infamous Necromancer.  Maybe there are more that I just not unlocked yet ? Probably, but the basic playthrough was quite poor in terms of NPC characters.

I’m the kind of person who leaves a game on while I’m doing other things (in fact I have another game open right now), but nonetheless, my 3k hours in this game is a fair indication of how much I love it.  I’m not blind to its faults, so I will mention them later, but first I’m going to talk about what makes this game worth all the time I’ve spent in it.

To my mind, the best parts of this game are within three elements of the game design, and how they interact: the class design, the enemy design and the tactical gameplay.

[h1]Class design [/h1]

The game has 35 character classes and 16 races, most of which are locked to begin with, but you can unlock them by playing the game, except for the seven dlc classes and races.  Each class has around three to four dozen skills.

The greatness of this part of the game comes from the sheer number of well designed classes with skills that interact with each other in all sorts of interesting ways.  You’ve got your standard warrior/rogue/mage classes, and then likely every possible variation you’ve ever thought of and several that you haven’t.  Things like the Writhing One class where you play a Lovecraft inspired half-whatever-race-you-picked, half-horror, using the tentacle you have in place of an arm together with a 1h weapon, or the Time Warden which has abilities where you use time travel to attack enemies several times all at once, or the Doomed class where you have shadows that follow you around and you can do things like throw them at enemies or swap places with them.

Often classes will have more than one way to play them, and on top of all that, the first time you complete the game you unlock the adventurer class, which allows you to pick skills from any of the other classes, so you can mix and match however you like.

[h1]Enemy design [/h1]

The basic concept of enemy design is fairly simple, but very effective at creating all sorts of interesting encounters.  They have a base type, like “brown bear” or “luminous horror” or “elven mage”, which will have their own particular skills, and then you can come across rares, which are upgraded enemies with a class, as in one of the classes you can choose from, meaning that they have extra skills from that class and relevant equipment.  There are also unique and boss monsters, which only appear in particular areas (usually at the end of a zone for bosses) until you get to insane difficulty where there’s a chance of random uniques and bosses, which can have more than one class.

You can see how, with all the various classes available to you, this is a system that can keep you on your toes.

[h1]Tactical gameplay [/h1]

So the first two elements of the game that I’ve mentioned combine to give an amazing tactical gameplay experience.  You build your character and buy them equipment with the goal of being ready for any encounter, then you test your build against all the different enemies that you come across, and of course you can sometimes come across more than one rare monster at a time.

With the difficulty settings at an appropriate level, you will get many chances to really push your character, however you’ve built them, to it’s limits.  I've had fights where I'm one move away from death for dozens of turns, I've had fights where I have to eke out every bit of damage I can get from my character to out damage an enemy's heals, there are times when I've faced down half a dozen rares at once, and you get that feeling of relief when you pick off one, so you know the rest of the fight is going to be that much easier.   Because of the rng aspect of the game, you’ll always have the possibility of challenges you haven’t faced before, and the difficulty settings go down to a point where you don't really need skills and up beyond the point where most classes are even capable of winning without the game being modded, so there's very little chance that you won't be able to adjust things to your taste.

[h1]And now, the bad stuff [/h1]

The first thing is pretty obvious.  Just look at the screenshots.  If you’re looking for a game that’s pretty, this isn’t it.

Also text.  Lots and lots of text.  To be fair, if you've read to this point in the review it's probably not a problem.

Then there’s the game’s complexity, which might be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your personality.  Fortunately all the important mechanics are actually explained in the game if you mouse over everything and read the tooltips.  However, there’s a lot to wrap your head around, especially each time you decide to learn a new class.

The above three issues are really more like obvious barriers to entry rather than flaws.  The next few points are more like actual flaws in the design.

EDIT: Just removing a criticism that was patched out in 1.6 (you can't drown friendlies for xp and loot any more and higher difficulties were adjusted so that this tedious process is no longer necessary).

I’ll also mention balance.  Some classes are simply not as strong as other classes.  To be fair it’s not like they have to fight each other, and if you want to play a more difficult class, there’s always the possibility of lowering the difficulty.  However, it’s disappointing when you look at a class and conceptually it’s everything you want, but it’s just not as strong the last class you played.

Finally I'll mention the story.  The history and lore of the setting is all great and in depth and fairly well written, but there’s not much of a personal story to be found here.  You’re an adventurer, you decide to go fight things and get more powerful because reasons.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

It’s niche, but it’s probably the best thing in its niche.  If this isn't your kind of thing then no amount of recommendation can sway you, but if this is your kind of thing then you won’t regret buying this game and its dlc’s.  You’ll probably feel like it’s worth more than what you’ve paid.",1555632570,1592848115,True,38,0,0.742675244808197021,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While ToME touches on many of the high fantasy RPG tropes, it also takes much of what you know and expect and throws it out the window. The end result may not work for everyone, but for me it's a wonderfully quirky and colorful experience I have come to love.

ToME was designed around the idea of giving the player possibilities. Almost anything the enemies can do you can do and vice versa. This shines through in a large and diverse set of options for your character class. And you're not just choosing what color sparks you want to shoot out of your fingers; the classes feel incredibly different. Erasing your foes from existence as a time-manipulating Paradox Mage, cleaving a hate-fueled rampage as a Cursed, and channeling fireballs through your sword as an Arcane Blade all have their own distinctive style and all are satisfying.

The downside to all this is that ToME is unbalanced (though this doesn't bother me personally) and unintuitive. Some classes are simply much more powerful than others. Since there is no competitive multiplayer, I think this is fun in a way: choose your challenge level. On the other hand, it can be a little deflating to know that a class you think sounds cool is tough to play. That being said, on the lower difficulty levels, any class can easily win the game with reasonably skilled play. It's more so if you choose to play on the higher levels that you might start to have trouble.

The bigger problem is that ToME is unintuitive. The game is highly skill based and quite challenging, especially at first. However, much of the challenge comes from understanding how ToME works. Some of the lessons you can learn just fine by experience: positioning is more important than in most games, scouting can be very useful, and sometimes yes you should run away and come back later.

On the other hand, some things you probably won't figure out on your own. For example, you have defense and saves that help you avoid taking hits and status effects. So these are important to improve, right? Well, actually because of the way the game scales, monsters are so good at hitting you and applying statuses that even if you try to boost your defense and saves, the benefits are minimal. And speaking of statuses, ToME has a ton of them and some of them matter a lot. Managing and applying statuses is more important than just blasting out damage for most classes. In particular, the ""stun"" status is devastating. Sometimes it feels like ToME is ""Don't Get Stunned: The Game.""

Fortunately, there is a good community of players to give newcomers tips. There are class guides in the ToME forums, and live chat if you play while online where people are happy to give advice. In addition despite its age, development on ToME continues. The devs work on updates and reworks to make the game a smoother experience.

It's also worth noting that while ToME has a story, graphics, characters, etc, everything is stripped down. The heart of the game is challenging tactical dungeon crawls, character builds, and loot. This gives the game a huge amount of replayability. But it also lacks some of the elements of a more traditional RPG.

Overall, while ToME is a quirky game, if you like tactical dungeon crawling and creative character builds, I think ToME is one of the best games out there to satisfy those desires. It's a game I keep coming back to and expect to still play for years to come.",1555313255,1555313301,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ToME, like many other roguelikes, superficially resemble chess as a tile based strategy game. In ToME's case, there is a much larger and nuanced board, and the pieces are developed beyond movement and replacement, but this is not to portray chess as any less sophisticated; if anything, chess is more sophisticated. I am not a chess player, but I presume this sort of thing would appeal to those players who want many more visuals, actions, and a system of rules & conditions developed in a completely separate environment, which is most likely a minority. 

The depth and potential length of the gameplay rivals a 20th century russian novel. The loot & lore have a unique color & feel fitting for the epic fantasy setting. The playdoh looking models weren't preferable, to say the least, but character development possibilities are nigh infinite, and that isn't an exaggeration. 

The game offers a smorgasbord of offensive, defensive, and supportive skills, too many for me to keep up with at the moment; soon enough I have plenty of abilities to forget that I have when they would be the most useful. That isn't to say there are mostly situational abilities, or that there are too many ways to fight, I just tend to use only three or four at any given encounter, which means I'm limiting my gameplay options, which means less novelty, which means less fun.

After passing the ""1,000 Hours Played"" mark, it occurred to me that I never stopped to give this game a review. I could go on and on about this game, but I'll try to keep it short. Uh, [i]relatively[/i] short.
(TL;DR version: Less frustrating nonsense than other roguelikes, tons of player character options, neat story, challenging but chill.)


If I had to describe this game, it would be not quite a ""Roguelike"", but a variation of the ""Rogue"" formula. Whereas classic Roguelikes (Such as NetHack) place more emphasis on the 'survival' aspect of gameplay, ToME focuses more on aptitude in combat. Items are auto-identified when you pick them up. There is no hunger system that will starve you to death when you try to heal by resting. A clear and concise ""infusion"" system replaces drinking strange unlabeled potions that can either help or hinder you. Hidden traps won't oneshot you from full health. 

The game, instead, provides challenge by testing your character build. Even the most basic Berserker class can use special techniques and abilities rather than the plain ""Walk into enemies until they die"" approach similar games use. Your ability to understand your own talents, strengths, and weaknesses are what will determine whether you win or lose in this game. Once you understand the logistics of the game, it can be pretty relaxing in a way. I often play this while listening to something else on my tablet!

Not to say that this game will be [i]easy[/i] once you know what you're doing! HOWEVER, this game has another feature that other Roguelikes don't: Adjustable difficulty and permadeath. Changing the difficulty will change the levels of enemies encountered, along with the frequency of 'Rare' enemies that have the talents of player classes. There are also three permadeath settings:
[list]
[*] Roguelike: Your standard ""One life to live"" setting you're used to in other games.
[*] Adventure: You gain extra lives as you increase your experience level.
[*] Exploration: A donator-exclusive setting that gives infinite lives.
[/list]

Your potential character builds start off pretty standard, but as you unlock more content, you obtain more advanced and absurd choices. 
Human berserker? Sure.
Halfling rogue? Of course!
A dwarf channeling its inner hatred to become a cursed slasher movie villain? Absolutely!
An elf that's [i]so[/i] attuned to nature that they just start melting into a blob? Without a doubt!
A skeleton that reaches across timelines to assault foes with a squad of itselves??? YES!
PSYCHIC STEAMPUNK COWBOY ORCS??? AHAHAHAHAHA, YES, YES!!!!

...Ahem. You get the idea.

On the subject of the characters, it's easy to dismiss the plot of the game at first. A fantasy setting with humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and so on. Dangerous dungeons are around because wizards did a bad thing a long time ago. Nothing you haven't seen before, right? But that's just the surface level. As you get deeper into the game, you will discover rather unique takes on these classic fantasy tropes, things that you never would have guessed based on your preconceptions! 

So yeah. All of that stuff ends up making for what has turned out to be a colossal time vacuum for me. Like I said, the base game is free, so there's no reason not to check this game out!",1551610422,1551610422,True,31,1,0.759479343891143799,0,True,False,False,False,,,

但主观讲的话更喜欢elona在伊尔瓦资料馆里写完却没做到游戏里的剧情……

Seriously though, Tales of Maj'Eyal is extraordinarly depthed, balanced, interesting, innovative, and it offers challenges that can be approached in a thousand different ways. The class system, combined with the sheer amount of items available, means you can build your characters however you would like. Want to be a typical shield and sword hero? Sure, no problem. Want to summon monsters to do your bidding? Necromancer it is. Want to kill your future self and become a paradox mage, taking control of cosmic forces to wreak havoc and chaos on armies of slimes? You got it, bud.

This, all combined with a great universe filled with curious lore for you to read and explore, an upgradable leveling system with skills you've never seen used in any other game, and side quests that are actually relevant to the plot, (I know, you probably don't believe me) makes Tales of Maj'Eyal a must-play for anyone who enjoys dungeons and Dragons, rougelike RPGs, or classics like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Crawl Stone soup. Like any rougelike, it takes time, patience, and intrest. Once you get going, it's very, very hard to stop. (Especially if youre a stone warden hurling boulder missles)

This is a ridiculous amount of content for $6.99. Don't be afraid to play just because theres *gasp* PERMADEATH (insert ghouls screaming above your mutilated body). You can play casually in story mode and die as much as you would like. There are also amazing, full-game-sized DLCs.

This game is so RNG is hurts, you can carry as many resistance items to counter enemies and look at plenty of guides, but it wont prepare you for when an extremely hard rare monster comes out of the woodwork and happens to freeze/stun your character even when you have plenty of stun resistance, causing insta-death.There are options to play with lives instead of straight up rogue-like, however it doesn't matter when that unique monster appears (even when playing safe and not opening any locked doors or chests), and ends up killing you 3 or 4 times in a row basically ending your run anyways. Going through every hallway manually will add on another 3 hours through uninspired setting makes every run a drag, many enemies blend together after killing so many and eventually you'll be pressing the auto-explore key more than you ignore the scrolls of exposition that are thrown everywhere on the floors of dungeons. 

So in the end, I feel like theres no sense of skill progression when playing this game. It's impossible to avoid insta-killing creatures, the settings are uninspired, and the runs last so long that its heart-breaking when you die due to situations you cant avoid.

And that's just a few of the options available to you. These differences, along with the randomly generated dungeons and monsters within, help keep every game of ToME fresh and unique.

The game isn't perfectly balanced, nor can it really be with so many options available to you. There are also a few moments where the randomness can feel unfair, though not nearly to the extent that most other roguelikes have. Overall, though, there's very little to complain about.

The screenshots and videos show you pretty much how it goes. Some of the actions are mouse clicks but everything else is bound to hotkeys. I haven't played it much yet but it was fun and easy to get into. The graphics and sound are good, I look forward to unlocking more classes because you are limited in the beginning to a few classes.

One thing I really liked is that you can find items that will inscribe new spells onto you that you can then use on the hotbar just like any other spell. Different spells are boosted by different stats, so I found a rejuvenation healing spell that was boosted by strength as well as one that is boosted by magic stat. Each class has fixed spell lines that they can level up with skill points, but you can still add more cool spells that can be used in combat (not single use or limited use items).

Overall intuitive interface (except for things requiring hotkeys), and it is easy to get into exploring the land and dungeons, and fighting. Most things have left or right mouse click to bring up a menu to perform an action, but it seemed like i needed to hit '<' after standing on the box to go in and out of areas/up down stairs etc. The Alchemist has a pet, and using F1 and F2 switches you back and forth between controlling your pet and yourself. While controlling the pet you press I for inventory and you can equip items on your pet.

Rating: N/A  (but probably E)
Price: $6.99
Genre: Rogue-like, RPG
Time played: 164.7 hours

Gameplay - 10

Turned based strategy rolled into a roguelike game. You start off by picking a class and race, options are limited at first.  Each race has pros and cons as does each class.  Depending on what you pick you’ll start in different places, with different objectives. Magic, weapons, armor it’s all there, you just have to figure out how and if you can use it.  

Story -  10

The world is alive with, well everything.  There’s ancient lore, mystic ruins, normal ruins. Necromancers and Trolls to fight. You’ll travel to distant locations, fight off various bad guys, or good guys depending.  Learn about the Spellblaze and why magic is forbidden.

A very rich and … well not inviting they are dangerous things out there. But, a world filled with adventure for sure. 

I really am underselling this.  It’s amazing. 

Graphics - 8

For a roguelike game this has pretty decent graphics. Your spells and the enemies will put off various effects and provide a very immersive feel to it.  Well at least for me anyways. 

Controls - 8 (mouse/keyboard)

Most things can be done with the mouse, however as you play more and more you’ll start looking up the keyboard commands so you can play faster… well not move your mouse hand as much I suppose. 

Repeatability - 10

Starting out you’re going to die. A lot.   Get over it. Rogue games mean you need to learn from your mistakes and try harder.  If you don’t learn, you’re gonna have a bad time. You’re not going to enjoy this game. Luckily, this is a roguelike, meaning you can earn things (races/classes/equipment) that will carry over to your later runs, making them easier and more rewarding. The zones(dungeons) don’t really change much, just your character and how you handle them.  As an alchemist, one of my favorite classes, you and your mighty Golem, yes you can summon a golem to tank for you, will probably handle things much much different than say an Archmage or different than a Warrior. Each run will be different and exciting so tons of replayability. Also looks like they recently updated the game with even more stuff, more DLC and free race/class upgrades.   Why aren’t you playing already? 





Music - 8

Atmospheric and pleasant. Unless it’s dangerous out and then not so much. Still worth it. 

Multiplayer - N/A 

Initial Thoughts: 

Ooo another rogue-like.  I first started playing this game off the T.O.M.E. Website(server? I don’t remember) so the 164 hours isn’t correct.  I played and unlocked a few classes, then life caught up to me and forgot about the game for a while.  Then found it on Steam and dove right back in, I love rogue type games and this is one of the better one. 

Soma Says: 

Fantastic game.  Love everything about it. Looks like the game recently got an update which means i need to dive back in and start playing more. Also found out that apparently I backed this game? Or donated? I don’t know. But I have the ability to use “Exploration mode”, things have changed so maybe everyone has this.  Basically you have unlimited lives and can respawn over and over.  You can also unlock various classes/races that carry over to the ‘real’ game. … why did i ever stop playing this?  

I wrote about one of my characters a long while back. Sadly too much to put here. But I wrote it all here :  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2h2IU5yWzG-NDsr0DXxUhvmsT-Ju_W13rrY5OUxY3s

Más de mil horas de juego, y las que me quedan si quiero pasármelo en dificultades mayores. Este juego y The Binding of Isaac son los juegos de los que estoy más orgulloso de tener en mi biblioteca de Steam.

Pros
- Repleto de razas y clases donde elegir, cada una con múltiples opciones donde especializarse
- Estrategia por turnos donde manejas a un solo personaje
- Mecanicas de sigilo, magia, velocidad, iluminación, trampas, arcos,...etc. Siempre hay una clase del gusto de alguien. Incluso existe una clase, el Aventurero, que es capaz de combinar, al gusto, sus habilidades según tu estilo de juego
- Múltiples opciones de selección de dificultad y de regular la muerte permanente
- La mejor interfaz y la mayor calidad de vida, gráficos incluidos, en un roguelike clásico (para mi gusto)

Contras
- Puede apabullar al principio su dificultad. Demasiada información sobre la descripción de cada una de las habilidades, los atributos, etc.
- La mayoría de razas y clases se irán desbloqueando según vayas avanzando en el juego y su historia, lo que te limita al principio. Aunque a mí personalmente me gusta este sistema, ya que te desafía a seguir hasta desbloquear todo
- Morirás mucho, prepárate


En definitiva, si buscas una experiencia inmersiva y desafiante, ToMe es tu juego. Por el precio que tiene es una ganga, junto a sus expansiones, que por cierto merecen mucho la pena. Aunque si no te atreves a desembolsar ese dinero, prueba el juego, que es gratis, y si te gusta, pagarás el juego encantado, como hice yo.

If you're the sort of person that's conscientious about the effort a dev puts into their work or someone that doesn't get too worked up over their time being wasted for trying something new, this review isn't for you. 

With that being said, let me say straight up that the design philosophy for this game completely fails to work. As an RPG this game fails to respect the player's willingness to commit and as a roguelike it fails to provide a smooth experience to make the replayability aspect work.

In terms of gameplay it seems really simple on the surface, which can be good, simple is sweet. Unfortunately, the reality is that it simultaneously requires too much of the player's attention to be a mindless passtime, but is too uninteresting in its gameplay to compensate for the attention it demands.
As you learn the flow of the game from frequent deaths, you'll find just how much micromanagement is actually necessary  to be optimal. You have to optimise your equipment and skills, which means pouring over every bit of relevant loot and new skills after every zone and level up, but this game is awful at presenting this information so you never become familiar with it even after 20 odd playthroughs. 
The game doesn't give much context for all the stats in a game either. Platemail is hugely diminishing for energy usage, but it offers a whopping 7 armour. But what is 7 armour in this game, 7/100? What does it mitigate, is it a flat deduction from attacks or a percentage? How should good gear for my character's level look like?
The player will expend a lot of effort for what is effectively monitoring numbers and moving tiles on a map. Even then you don't ever feel in control over what's going on. Attacks occur so quickly that you'll just get confused and frustrated as to what just happened, it's punishing but not in a coherent way.

How about the replayability?
The start of every game is too repetitive to encourage a player to push on after you're familiar with it, but getting the unlockables is utterly asinine so chances are you won't have much variety to play with after you've experienced a good chunk of the original classes. 
So then you have to pigeonhole yourself into playing terrible characters just for a chance to unlock new stuff, but chances are you'll die before you can even accomplish that much because even the most thought-out minmaxed character is at risk of dying instantly from a random thunder mage.
Ultimately it doesn't end up playing differently on reruns, just gearing differently. Which all goes to waste in the end either way since you'll die. Even if you think you're fully content with losing all progress when you die, you won't be. You will be far from Okay when you die.

In conclusion, this game isn't worth the commitment it requires to succeed at it.",1541386279,1541386279,False,41,1,0.668222606182098389,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On a basic level it is still a solid, unique experience worth trying out.

Tales of Maj Eyal is really only a roguelike by inertia at this point. Stemming back to Angband mods, TOME has been in development in its current form for nearly 15 years and the author has been working on related projects for even longer. With TOME you are getting an ancient product that has been retooled and upgraded and expanded almost nonstop for most of the author's life and probably longer than most of you have even BEEN alive.

Along the way, TOME has abstracted away almost all roguelike genre conventions. Traps are nonexistent. Hunger is gone. All items are identified. No potions, no scrolls, weight management is a formality at best... Everything is focused on Diablo loot and dozens of unique skill trees for the game's over two dozen classes. There is almost nothing I have seen in the whole RPG genre that gives you the sort of variety TOME's class trees offer. Everyone from the fighter to the wizard has two hotbars full of cooldown abilities and will usually be cycling 2-4 of them in any fight. Potion equivalents in this game are runes which are simply more equippable cooldown abilities that facilitate your get out of jail functionality. This game is honestly closer to turn based Diablo at this point than Rogue, with the piles of loot to match along with the single greatest QOL upgrade I have ever seen in the genre: a to-sell box that holds all the loot you grab in a level. Before you leave, you can sort through it all, pull out anything that catches your eye, and anything left is auto-sold. More games need to rip this feature off.

The problem is this game is still bloated with 15 years worth of weight. For a game with so much class variety, runs last way too long, 10-20 hours just to clear it once. The world map is bloated with dungeons and other crap that serves no purpose except for a few side quests that you must randomly find because they give skill points for garbage busywork. You will hit the level cap before you are even 66% through the game. Even worse, some of the content is tuned so tough some insane people insist on running extra dungeons on top just for earlier leveling or to fish for more loot.

Worse still, turn based Diablo means you are constantly blasting hordes of trash enemies one at a time, slowly, one by one. ARPG hordes without ARPG speed and where bump combat is mostly discouraged in favor of alternating 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2... hundreds of repetitive trash enemies in far too many pointless dungeon floors there to bore you until you find the one tough enemy. You can see his abilities, but your own are a dizzying mess of numbers spread all over the perk tree, good luck reading his and being able to guess ""Man that debuff sounds nasty. Can I resist it with my save stats?"" (Pro tip: enemy level means almost nothing) Its a surprise and the prize is all your stuff goes on cooldown all at once and then he hits you for 3x your max hp on your second hit.

That's the other problem. You have all these interesting stat trees but the game doesn't end up giving you any useful info with them. Gear descriptions are horrific and basically require mods to present info in a useful fashion. Most of your skills are braindead picks (the only defense skill) but the ones that are not are tickets to reading online and see if in THIS version of the game is X dps route a noob trap or is Y? And even then you cannot really make a guess as to if you can take this or that boss without having died to him already or hoping your escape options can actually get you out if you got knocked down to 2 hp in one hit. All this glosses over how long you have to play as a character to finally start amassing more complicated skill combos than just defense passive and two DPS actives you alternate between.

The end result is a game that is full of contradictions. It aims high, almost to Etrian Odyssey tier in variety of class skills, a focus away from roguelike garbage and instead on tactical combat and ARPG build cobbling together, but it doesnt actually reward or engage with clever play, runs too long to let you actually enjoy the variety, does not make early game growth fun like even Battle Brothers, a game almost ENTIRELY about endlessly repeated early game growth, can. For the scope of what it offers, TOME is one of a kind and, again, a lot of these issues wont show up until you start playing to win over and over and over, but these are still significant problems for a game built around repeated play. I have tried to come back to this game over and over after my successful spite clear but I feel I have given it all the chances I can.

I have been playing this game for years now (not all on this account and not all on steam) and still find it entertaining, even after playing the predecessors to this game, Angband and Tales of Middle Earth for many years prior.

It is a great game, I really want to convey this information... so I'll take a shot at it here.

Why is it so great?  A multitude of classes and races, each with many different skill trees to explore.  Tons of different dungeons. Semi-linear gameplay (don't need to do all dungeons and to some degree can choose the order they are played in). So many different strategies to explore and always a sense of discovery, whether it may be some random gear or some terrible foe.

I was not interested in the DLC, thinking the main game was good enough, but in my fashion of occassionally paying/donating to the developer, I decided to just buy the DLC time around (on another account though). To my surprise they are so far some pretty nice chunks of content for the game.  They add new classes, races, and they do some unique things not found in the main game, such as add some more engrossing narratives.

Also, love that it has Linux support (and Windows and OSX).  Finally, it should be noted that this game is open source and can be downloaded for free elsewhere.  What buying it on steam gets you is the cloud-save feature, an ""items vault"" that you can use to pass whatever miracles the RNG sends your way between your characters, and some other cloud features I haven't really explored.

felt like minutes, no... hours, days... years? Millenia even? The very fabric of time

""You're disgusting! Scribbl'doo was raving like a madman at Todd's words. He wouldn't accept it. 

yellow foam frothed ferociously from his mouth. It came out in a spurting spread of spittle with 

every word. He wouldn't accept it.
His life was rooted deep in hatred of the Ziguranth. ""They hunted our magician families for 

years!"" He recalled the family stories. How the Zigur's killed so many magic users, even his own 

family. 

Todd conituned. ""I hearby take my leave from the council! I urge the others... no, all of 
you to follow me. This senseless bigotry cannot stand! By hilmsgoroth's beard, I will not stand 
in this country again. Goodbye Todd... My one true love"". Drips of water gently flowed down his 

face. It wasn't raining out. 

Scribbl'doo's countenance changed. He stood calm, as if he just woke up from a peaceful sleep.
He looked up at Todd, and his face slowly twisted into a sinister snarl. He had but one last 
thing to say.

You will be presented with the crypt random encounter at level 24 that if you do not enter, you will never be able to enter again.

Too bad for you start over.

Want to have fun playing a class that utilizes mana or many of the interesting class resources? Get rekt. There are several enemies in the game that can drop your entire class resource to 0 before you can even see them from maximum distance.

For some reason, when playing a magic user on Nightmare (the difficulty after normal, not even close to the hardest difficulty), when you encounter a follower of Zigur on the world map, they are always 2X your level? Is this a joke? At almost every stage, this encounter will kill you. You will either get one shot, or two shot. Game over, try again.

This game has a huge amount of variety and a lot of charm too it. But it is too bad that you cannot enjoy it because of mechanics that screw over certain classes and some completely unbalanced encounters that get you one shot killed through no fault of your own.

All that being said, kudos to the developer for putting effort into making this game. It isn't an expensive title, and a lot of creativity can be found here. Probably has the most interesting mechanics and armchair fun gameplay you could ask for in a low budget title. But considering the tediousness of it and the unfair rare enemy one shotting you because you didn't stack resist to a single damage type, I cannot reccomend to the average gamer.",1536558459,1536558459,False,28,2,0.624179363250732422,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A roguelike with an active developer. ToMe may look prettier than Rogue and Adom, but don't be fooled. This game is just as brutal. The classes are fully fleshed out, you have entire skill trees to work your way through. Its also a fairly complex system, with everything from world speed to specific resistances. ToME is a rogue for rogue lovers. Open World? Check. Expansive Lore? Check. Rediculous amount of classes and races? Check. Want to be a time traveling defender of time? You can. Want to summon your own personal horde of monsters? Its got a class for that. Want to worship unseen terrors and turn your hand into a tentacle? Yup. Sure you have your Archer, Mage, and Beserker, but have some fun! Be a Cursed, or Oozemancer. Every class plays completely differently, and the strategies in your class build help alot. I've been playing summoner for my last ten or so runs, and I still adjust my build so my next run will go smoother. 

ToMe is MASSIVE even without the DLC, and its totally worth it. This game will kill you over, and over again, until you emerge at the top. Ignore most of our hours, as most true fans have been playing since before the game was on steam. So much gameplay here if you can overlook something as minor as graphics. If you love roguelikes, ToME is one of the best, and if you are new, this is a great starting point. Learn to love dying, and explore a massive fantasy world that only wants to make you cry. DLC is cheap, and the ones that add stuff to the main campaign are worth it. The main world is so rediculously huge that none of it is necessary however. If you get tired of the lore and story there is an infinite dungeon as well.

...and if you get stuck? If you choose to play in online mode, the game has a chat so you can ask for help or just talk strategy with folks.

A word of warning: this game is hard.  It's supposed to be.  In my (as of time of review) 250 hours (edit 11/25/2020 up to 1k hours now, still just as enjoyable and the updates that have come out and are upcoming are making it pretty easy to keep playing), I've won five times, on Normal Adventure mode (aka you're allowed a handful of deaths before it's permanent).  I've been told by the friend who got me into the game that this is a surprising number of successes in that time.  That's a lot of time not winning on the difficulty settings the game is explicitly balanced around, let alone going on to any higher difficulty.  That's a lot of charaters invested in who croaked somewhere along the way.  Unlike a tough game like Dark Souls and Cuphead, there are no infinite lives here (unless you play on Exploration which kind of defeats the point of the game in my personal opinion.)  If this sounds like a dealbreaker, you do not want to get this game.

Tl:dr:
Pros - great gameplay, amazing variety of character types, friendly community, helpful, active developers, lore deep and well-developed, but not overbearing for those who don't care, addicting despite being brutally hard.
Neutrals - Soundtrack is hit or miss
Cons - UI is mediocre on the default, free range of control fixes this but the process of fixing is in and of itself unintuitive.
Verdict - I love this game, cannot recommend it enough.

This was my first true roguelike.  I've played several roguelites before, my favorite being Crypt of the NecroDancer, but this was the first time I've ever played a game where you can lose all of your progress 7 hours in.  And it's been a wonderful experience that I actively look forward to coming back to when I'm not playing.

ToME is a turn based Roguelike that focuses on high fantasy.  The world you're in is still recovering from the Spellblaze, a cataclysmic event that rocked the entire planet, and beyond.  Whether or not you care beyond that is entirely up to you for the entire first half of the game.  The story is all told in lore snippets up until you find a certain artifact that kickstarts the true plot, and it's up to you to read and understand what the world you're travelling around is like.  Until the plot does kick in, you are Random Adventurer #4765108, who starts in whatever dungeon your race/class combo starts in, and then just explores the continent for loot and fun.  The race and class pool is shallow to start so as to not overwhelm you with choices (and a lot of the more complex ones are locked at the start to encourage you to learn the base mechanics first) and you unlock the others by playing.  Witness a summoning event to get summoners.  Save a Yeek being attacked to unlock Yeeks.  Some are straightforward, others aren't.  Every class plays different from the others, and races add flavors to what you're playing making for hundreds of combinations.

The gameplay is turn based and (as someone who has never played a roguelike and therefore has no other tile-based roguelikes in my past to draw from) feels a lot like a combination of the difficulty of Crypt of the NecroDancer with the dungeon style of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.  It's a great style, and the depth of the combat system is something I only realized when I started asking why my mages all sucked, only to find out that while I'd been doing well on stats I'd neglected spellpower focus, rendering them useless later due to resistances.  The RNG nature of dungeon creation and enemy types/spawns means every playthrough is holding something unexpected, but this can also hurt the experience...if your luck just isn't working out some night, you can have no character get past level 2 due to poorly timed rare enemies.

The game is entirely single player, but there's a chat that everyone is automatically in, and this is honestly one of the best features of the game for me.  ToME is complex, you're going to have questions, and the wiki for this game is nowhere near up to date.  But, you have several hundred other players, most of whom are likely to know the answer to your question, and generally people are happy to answer (I've been on both sides of this).  The developers are active in chat often as well, and several of my questions were answered directly by them without any prompting.  When compared to the big wig developers, it's truly nice to see the support the devs have for their players.

...I'm trying to think of any real cons, and I guess the only one I can come up with is that the default interface isn't great, and while you're allowed to move things as you want, the things you'll want to move may have their move icons hidden when you unlock the interface (my advice, change the talent bar so it's two rows deep, you'll want it, and that requires moving the chat and log up, which is the hard part due to the chat move icon being hidden behind another thing).  Otherwise, the only thing that even is kind of a con is not every track in this game is a winner, and some themes get a little grating (I love Kor'Pul's theme for two loops a night, then it just bothers me)

This game is great.  If you're on the fence about getting it I seriously suggest doing it, and getting the DLCs too...the added classes, races, areas, and events are worth it at a fraction of the cost a larger developer would charge for the content.  It's a great game, and I'm looking forward to continuing to explore the world of Eyal.",1533879172,1606337577,True,5,0,0.584897816181182861,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I originally just bought this game because I love RPGs, it was cheap, and the reviews were Overwhelmingly Positive. I actually didn't know anything about ""roguelikes"" at the time, although I've now become pretty fond of this long-standing genre, all thanks to ToME! So, in case you may be a newbie like I was, this game is a ""traditional"" rogue-like, which means it has turn- and grid-based combat, ""procedurally generated"" (random) dungeons, and ""permadeath"" (once you die, your character is no longer playable, and you must start again from the beginning). And you WILL die -- a lot. In fact, this is what many people most enjoy about the genre. Beating the game is actually pretty rare and typically reserved for skillful, knowledgeable players, who have cut their teeth on the corpses of many past characters.

This genre inspired many of the rogue-""lites"" that have exploded in popularity in recent years, for example Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Dead Cells, etc. Its influence is also clear on ARPG titles such as Diablo and Path of Exile, once you know what you're looking for! The whole idea of ""learning by dying"" also lives on in Dark Souls, and by extension all of the ""souls-like"" imitators. That makes this a highly influential, but niche genre, that will probably appeal most to players of CRPGs, MMOs, or especially old-school MUD veterans.

**Tales of Maj'Eyal:
With that in mind, what makes Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME, or ToME4) itself unique? What we have here is a modern, streamlined, and accessible rogue-like title that does a great job welcoming new players, while still retaining the core features that appeal to genre purists. This makes sense when you consider this game was released in 2012, giving it as much as 30 years+ of collective ""lessons learned"" from some of its major competitors... and it shows!

Combat is WAY more complex/tactical than most other rogue-likes, with significantly more abilities available (not just ""bump, bump, bump"" combat like some of the others). There is deep, complex character development as well, including talent trees to invest in as you level-up. Itemization is also fantastic, equipment being generated right from the beginning with random stats, properties, tiers, etc. There is also later game, powerful ""artifact"" gear to be found all over the world. WoW or Diablo players will be right at home with these aspects of the game.

Did I mention there are TONS of classes and races, many of which are unlocked by previous playthroughs? Combined with, I believe, literally the most Steam achievements of any game on the platform, it helps to give some limited feeling of persistence/progression even after your character dies, which is a very welcome addition in my humble opinion. In-game chat and the online character vault are two more awesome feature that help the game feel more modern and ""alive"". Oh and fully visible equipment is a huge plus too, making every character that much more unique. Plus, ToME has done away with some of the ""resource management"" mechanics from past rogue-likes which some players may consider outdated, e.g. hunger/thirst, etc. This game really has a look and feel all its own that stands apart from its competitors like ADOM, Dungeonmans, Rogue Empire, etc. I dig it!

On the other hand, there are a couple things I think ToME could do better. For example, other rogue-likes such as ADOM seem to have more depth overall, maintaining a certain sense of scale and mystery that is hard to match. Similarly, although ToME's world is certainly rich in lore and immersive in its own right, it does not have any central storyline to drive it forward, and the quests that I've seen so far are somewhat generic and bland. Comparing to ADOM again, while ToME does have some difficulty and gameplay settings (like modes which limit or eliminate permadeath), it is missing some of the more complex configuration tools such as monster scaling, drop rate tweaking, etc.

**Conclusion:
ToME is probably my top pick so far as I have been playing around lately with numerous rogue-likes. Admittedly I am still a relatively inexperienced player, but overall this game just seems to appeal strongly to my gaming sensibilities, so to speak, offering many modern conveniences which I really appreciate. As a life-long gamer, especially of JRPGs, CRPGs, ARPGs, tactics & strategy wargames, MMOs, and even some MUDs, I was honestly pretty surprised to discover this genre I'd never really given a proper shake before. That said, I've had a lot of fun and would certainly recommend rogue-likes (including both ToME as well as some of the others I've mentioned above) to other gamers with similar tastes to my own.

所以单单只说它的一个方面，说一下它极其丰富的游戏内容吧。
该游戏具有10+1（第一个dlc）+3（第二个dlc）+2（第三个dlc）个种族，28+2+3+2个职业。这么庞大的种族和职业数目，在其他游戏中你能够想象吗？而且不光如此，它还不像某些声称拥有若干不同职业、实则各职业大同小异的游戏，该游戏的各职业、种族异质性是相当高的，玩法和技能各有不同的侧重、各有不同的优势和弱点。如此丰富且异质性极大的种族、职业、技能所交织出的是几乎无穷无尽的build策略和游戏体验。
并且基于这些丰富的内容，游戏提供了两类难度，使得“体验派”和“挑战派”这两类玩家都能得到满足。你想要体验式的游戏享受？在普通难度和探索模式下试试不同的build和风格吧；你想要挑战性？噩梦和疯狂难度将迫使你规划出build和战术上的最优解、最高效方式。
此外，游戏的世界观庞大而独特，它并不是类dnd体系或托尔金体系那样的传统奇幻，而是原创了一个相当奇诡的科幻与奇幻交融的世界，拥有别具一格的魅力。游戏中有着大量关于Eyal世界形形色色方面的lore碎片等待你去发现。你喜欢《黑魂》或者《空洞骑士》里那些优秀的碎片化叙述？并且你认为自己脑洞很大、头脑灵活，能够通过各个叙述碎片提炼和整理出整个世界观？那么你同样也会喜欢这个游戏的。

其他的就不说了，游戏时间证明一切。并且我觉得我还能在玩300小时。

- Extra classes and races that are unlockable through game challenges or story events

[b]Pros:[/b]

[list]
    [*]Streamlined controls / UI: really easy to grasp controls. This tends to be an issue, especially with older roguelikes. There is still a bit of a learning curve but it is not a chore and pretty intuitive.

    [*]Lots of races and classes, and they all play very differently. Even with in the basic grouping of ""melee/ranged/magic"" you get distinct differences. Playing a shadowblade is very different from an archmage. It is hard to explain but the class design is amazing.

    [*]Great music and solid artwork. Some roguelikes suffer from the pasted over graphic packs, not an issue here

    [*] Deep... DEEP game play. A single run can take days (I have yet to win with over 300 hours in). The map is the same but dungeons and mini bosses change. There is also an insane amount of lore in the game which is well written

[*] A solid roguelike with some unique features: namely you don't have to worry about food / water or carting gear to sell to merchants. Don't worry, you will still die horribly embarrassing deaths, this game just focuses more on combat

[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]

[list]
    [*]Min/maxing: you can really go down a rabbit hole and try to create the best character

    [*]Perma death and the mighty RNG: you can switch off permadeath (or play with limited revives) but if not be prepared to eat it to random highlevel bosses that pop out of chests. Pretty common in this genre so if that isn't your thing this might not be the game for you

Few reasons why i downvote and won't waste anymore time here.

1. The interface is rubbish, the invetory screen is horrid and the tooltips are so hard to read, all the workshop mods to make things more readable are out of date. Everything about the interface is hopeless when playing with only keyboard. Bugged, can't effectivly swap between interface, you will be forced to use the mouse at points.

2. The game is all over the place and you have no idea where or what to do next unless you read guides or just die over and over again through trial and error. DCSS is much more like chess, go down levels and finish branches. 

3. You die but it only shows you the combat log of like 20 lines, i died and the enemy was ofscreen somewhere and 1 shot me, go and check the combat log and all you see is ""something hits you for xxx damage"" yeah thanks for being so informative.

4. Everything takes too long in the early game.

5. Loot is like an RPG with shops and selling loot and bleh.

- tons of classes, races, skills, randomized dungeons, and modes makes for a VERY replayable game. You can even make completely different builds for each class, and there are over 30 of them, so that makes for a LOT of potential gametime.
- interesting, unique class and race mechanics with lots of buttons to push
- does a good job of alleviating some tedious tasks (transmog chest, autoexplore, autorest, etc.)
- has pretty decent theme with lots of variation
- better art than almost every other true roguelike
- sound is actually very useful
- lots of features to unlock
- lots of mods

cons:
- although the game has been beaten by every class on Insane (not by me, obviously), class balance is still a big factor in how well you do if you're not an expert
- graphics aren't great. monster design can be cool, but it's hard to really appreciate them when they're so small
- very steep learning curve. Oh, you want to play a rogue? Prepare to get 2-shot by the first rare mob you encounter.
- gear can be problematic. On certain levels, you want a lot of lightning resist. However, your best gear probably doesn't have lightning resist, so you'll have to carry around a spare set of gear. On other levels, it's fire. You also want a constitution set to level thick skin. You can only carry so much gear, though. These are easy problems to solve in comparison to figuring out which gear you need to actually win the game with, though, and it varies for each class. I've beaten the game, and I still don't feel like I have a good handle on which gear to wear. I do know that +HP at low levels and max stun resist throughout the game is a good place to start, though.
- random rare mobs can be harder than bosses. I know this is an intentional feature. It's just something I wish was different.
- perhaps a bit too long for a roguelike. If I'm going to lose my character forever, and I probably will, I'd prefer not having invested quite as much time into each one.

Experience:
I played on normal adventurer, starting out just trying to unlock as many features as possible, and had a great time with it. After unlocking almost everything, I tried beating the game. Took a few tries, and I actually got pretty discouraged at one point, but I managed to stumble on an OP build by accident (Doomed) that was basically invincible and had great damage. Other classes felt really weak, in comparison. It starts off slow, but once you reach a certain point in the build, you can faceroll your way through to the end.

DLC:
They're cheap and worth it. You get new classes, races, zones, items, prodigies, talents, and even a new campaign.

All in all, time well spent. I'm sure I'll be playing this game for years to come. 8/10",1530074422,1530074422,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

죽지 않고 플레이를 한다고 해도 최종보스까지 15시간은 넘게 걸립니다.

Steam recently ran their 'Spring cleaning event' and it was one of the tasks of this event to play a game that was previously downloaded but not played for a long time.
I cannot even recall how/when I downloaded this game but according to the player profile webpage that all registered players receive I have had this game for over 2 years !!
I am stunned that I have not previously discovered the games immersive lore and quest plots coupled with the ever addictive nature of procedural loot drops.
As a veteran gamer the graphics do not give me any cause for concern at all.... it is the addictive gameplay that offers genuine opportunity for strategy and planning during dungeon runs.
Many games out there in this genre tend to be completely unforgiving with the use of RNG and procedural encounters and quckly destroy all your time spent efforts in one ridiculously overpowered encounter...this may help with the sales of keyboards and monitors after they get trashed but it is not my idea of fun.
ToME is also at times very unforgiving but as you quickly discover there is always opportunity to overcome seemingly unbeatable encounters once you delve into the incredibly deep skill/talent/stat trees.
There is a great community ingame constantly discussing builds and strategy... (no barrens chat witnessed)
The community is clearly a mature and helpful one.
There is also a discord channel as well as a player profile webpage that makes superb reading and analysis for the number crunchers and stat heads.
This game takes me back to one of my favourite games ever... Amberstar on the Amiga
Although both games are rather different in many ways the reason I make this association is that since Amberstar I have yet too find a game that has lit my RPG furnace fuelled by stats and progression and a genuine sense of achievment...
By discovering Tales of Maj' Eyal I think I have finally found that game I have yearned for so long !!
Unbelievable value and amazingly addictive !
Guaranteed to be cited in future divorce cases...probably mine

This isn't some review of the pros and cons of the game, but just an explanation of one experience I had with it that I think is not only worth sharing, but might convince at least a few people to get the game.

In my time with ToME, I've not gotten very far at all, never really made it even halfway through, but I had an experience today that made me feel like I [i] needed [/i] to write this. I was playing as a class that, in my experience, tends to exceptionally hard to kill, but not very strong. 

Being one of the Chronomancer classes, it uses Paradox, and I'll spare you most of the details, but know that if your Paradox gets too high, weird things (called anomalies, which can be minor or major) start happening, like summoning time elementals, teleporting you randomly, protecting you from harm, [b] summoning Dwarven lumberjacks to your aid, [/b] etc. etc.

Now, I was fighting a mini-boss in an otherwise empty level, and being my nigh-unkillable self, I was confident I'd win. This behemoth, though, kept healing and shielding and just being too hard to kill because of its own abilities. I wasn't going to just give up when it got tough, though, so I kept at it. Even once my Paradox started summoning time elementals, wormholes, and literal rifts in the spacetime continuum, through which all manner of nightmares flooded out. None of that could kill me at that point, so why just give up because they were there? Just fight around them!

Things got more and more chaotic as my Paradox was getting higher and higher, summoning more and more things, and both myself and the mini-boss were teleporting around both of my own volition, and because of the Anomalies my excessive Paradox was causing. This went on for a solid 35-45 minutes, a fight that seemed like it would never end, because both participants seemed to be unkillable. 

It felt like one of those horribly cliche bits of fantasy lore where two immortal gods are locked in an eternal battle, but where one god was RNG'd up by the game, and the other wasn't even halfway through the game. Without taking into account every possible build and playstyle, no game without RNG enemies is going to even have a chance of giving you that kind of battle.

Simply put, if you want a chance to be locked in a battle against a creation spawned from your own bad luck, in a battle that wouldn't end without giving up or fleeing, then buy Tales of Maj'Eyal.

P.S. That battle I had? I fled from the level. I have to go back to the [i] mini-boss fight of eternal anomalies [/i] later in this run (if I don't die).",1527183669,1527183669,True,3,2,0.537970542907714844,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Coming from more conventional experiences like Nethack and DCSS, ToME is kind of weird. You play actual classes that have, like, talent trees. You don't necessarily only have one life. There's an overarching plot, for better or worse, with a procession of quests you go through each time (unless you're playing one of the Other game modes).

That being said, the game does a rather good job with most of the classes in it. Each one, generally, does SOMETHING special, and certain and more powerful ones on runs that lucked into ideal gear can make you feel like an utter badass on even the highest (well, second-highest) difficulties. Have you ever played a turn-based, top-down single-character RPG and longed for the ability to spit deadly globules of ooze at people, while negating attacks by undergoing binary fission AND making friendly backup oozes at the same time?

No? Well, pretend you have. This game has that!

Overall, it's a roguelike that has some more conventional RPG elements layered on top, and it works out rather beautifully.

You'd think that a game this deep, yet with mostly easy to use controls would be great for someone like me that enjoys roguelikes. But with this game that turned out not to be the case.
To take a few examples. All the equipment has a ton of stats, too many infact for me to bother reading them, so it just ends with me comparing it to my current equipment and if theres enough pluses and not too many minuses I'll switch, as far as that's concerned it could have just been +/- damage and it would have done the same job.
Another thing is randomized levels, one of the staples of roguelikes, and the reason why they have so much replayability. Well in this game, theres an auto-search function that has your character walk around until it spots something interesting, or the whole map is uncovered. Well it moves so fast, and the terrain is so bland, that I really wouldn't be able to tell if it's randomly generated. A few other games like DCSS also have the auto feature, but somehow I feel it takes away a lot less from the experience in that game. I think it has a lot to do with speed and presentation.
And speaking of presentation. This game has graphics, lots oand lots of graphics. There's like 3 or 4 types of bears in the first quest alone and the same goes for everything else. But the graphics holds no appeal to me. It's clear someone put a lot of time into it, but it all has this empty, air-brushed feel to it. And besides, it ain't always functional. When you or an enemy walk behind something like a wall or a tree, you can't see the healthbar next to it, that's just sloppy.
The story is the usual fantasy rubbish that thinks it's really clever but just comes out feeling really unnatural.",1527079171,1527079171,False,0,0,0.422332435846328735,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A turn-based RPG game with a very old school design. Everything about this game screams 'old school'... the graphics, inventory, combat and character design are all thoroughly infused with old schoolness... so don't expect a 'flashy and shiny' game, because this game isn't that... just look at some gameplay, and decide for yourself it you'll be able to play the game without getting bored (I'm still enjoying the game after many hours played, so that's good).

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

If you are familiar with the game ""Dungeons of Dredmor"" it's more or less the same, However this game is alot deeper, faster paced and has so much more to offer.

As soon as you are ready to play the game, you will have to pick your own class, role and difficulty. Each class and role has their own stats and has their own benefits. You are able to pick a difficulty along with perma-death enabled. I will recommend to play the tutorial as you may get confused in the beginning. There are many things and it could look complicated. Once you are ready to go to play the game you will be teleported to a location. 

Each class spawns at a different location, so if you are playing as a dwarf you will be spawned underground.  You can totally mix your own character with different roles. You will move around with the mouse with a quick pace which is really helpful but can be dangerous on the same time. You are not able to see inside the fog and could be very dangerous. Your character is able to rest which will allow him to regain health until seen by the enemy or full health.

As the game is turn based, any action/movement/item swap/activations will use a turn and monsters may be able to attack or move closer to you. Your character has a weight limit and has an Encumbrance marker. Overcrossing the limit will prevent you from walking. You are able to quick move around the world and if you are encountering an enemy/event/item or anything the game will automatically stop. This could be useful and makes you aware.

Multiplayer: No
Completion: 24 hrs
Cards: Yes
Cloud: Yes

Tales of Maj'Eyal is your classic roguelike - overhead, square grid, turn-based, (partially) procedurally generated, high difficulty, and (optional) permadeath. Tales of Maj'Eyal offers a few rather nice features that many roguelikes lack, namely limited automatic use of abilities under certain pre-defined conditions. 

Gameplay is your standard roguelike. The world map and some dungeons have static maps, but there are some dynamic ones that change each time. It's hard to tell what the completion time for this game is. Being a true roguelike, death is very likely and frequent. Much time will be spent learning from past mistakes, and even then, there are many situations that are likely to kill you outright anyway. It's worth noting that you can shoot in any direction, not just the standard 8. However, this also means that enemies can also fire from any direction, which puts you at a significant disadvantage when fighting in wide open spaces. There's a large number of races/classes to unlock, though a number of them can be a pain to acquire. Interestingly, despite the huge number of classes, there's enough skills do differentiate how one subclass plays from another. A brawler and berserker for example have wildly different playstyles despite both being melee.

The starting area and story you experience changes a bit depending on the race and/or class that you start as, though it all converges once out of the area. There's a surprising amount of backstory and lore weaved into the game, however, most of it is depicted in the usual plain-text-in-a-book that I've come to despise. Thankfully, it is all optional and the story does not require reading any of it to proceed.

The graphical tiles in this game are better than most roguelikes, and are easy on the eyes. Music is quite pleasant and soothing to the ears, though I did eventually hear it too much and had to switch to my own music player. Sometimes there's slowdown when there's a lot of stuff going on the screen, and typically the game lags when you die, as it tries to send information to its servers, but overall it's not too bad.

The itemization in this game is weird, at least to me. I have difficulty telling if a new item is better than my previous. It would have been nice if the game would calculate my expected damage per round or effective health were I to equip it, rather than figure it out myself. The armor system is not what players might be used to. I suggest taking some time to read the character sheet tooltips to understand what's going on and how it works. I feel the game has too many elements and status effects. It's pretty clear they don't want you to be immune to everything, so at any given time, you will likely be vulnerable to something that could very well kill you.

For me, I have two major complaints about this game. First is the fact that outside of the starter dungeons, all dungeons pretty much scale to your level. See, the way players measure their progress is by comparing their performance to something they have encountered before. But since enemies match and exceed your progress every step of the way, it feels like the game is punishing you for leveling up. My second problem is tied to the first. Rare spawns are grossly overleveled. It's not uncommon to steamroll common enemies, lulling you into a false sense of security when a rare/elite monster comes along and eats half your health in one go, or is overly resilient. This problem is magnified by the fact that these are frequent and you can run into these multiple times on the same map. The game provides a number of escape tools, but some are RNG-based, and running away isn't always possible.

Something people might not realize when browsing this game is the fact that is is free! Simply visit their website to download a copy. Buying the Steam version provides the benefits that donators get. One of the most fascinating features about Maj'Eyal is how all your runs are stored on their website. You can look up all sorts of information from the characters you've made, the mods you've installed, your victories, your defeats, and a whole gaggle of other stats of yourself or others. Aside from still actively being developed and added to, ToME also has an active Workshop. Don't like how something plays? There's a pretty good chance there's a mod for it. Interestingly, most(all?) mods do not diable achievements, so feel free to go all super-powered to unlock stuff in the game.

If I were to describe Tales of Maj'Eyal in a word, it would be ""Gotcha!"" because that's far and away how I died. Bunch of giants throwing boulders? Gotcha! Boss chucking lightning storms? Gotcha! Didn't have Freeze resist? Gotcha! And it saddens me because I can be playing a very good game and then suddenly I am whacked by an unusually powerful mob. I give Tales of Maj'Eyal a B-.

Para empezar, han quitado algunas de las características que, en mi opinión, son las más cargantes de los roguelike clásicos. No hay que comer, y los objetos se identifican automáticamente. Dependiendo del nivel de dificultad puedes tener más de una vida, o una sola como en los roguelike de siempre. 

Pero también han añadido algunas cosas nuevas. Los personajes tienen una serie de habilidades que pueden activar en combate, lo que hace el juego mucho más interesante desde el punto de vista táctico. El interfaz está bastante bien, y los gráficos, aunque feuchos, son bastante claros. 

Luego hay cosas que no cambian. Mucho lore, con una enorme variedad de enemigos. Los combates pueden ser difíciles, pero son interesantes, y hay una sensación de estar en peligro siempre. Trae muchas razas y clases, algunas de las cuales hay que desbloquear, lo que unido a que muchas zonas son aleatorias, hace el juego muy rejugable.

More character development options than most roguelikes, with an immense array of different skill trees to unlock and talents to choose from.   You can play for hundreds of hours and not run out of different classes to explore.

It honestly fooled me that its a good game cause people of this genre will support any game like this but in reality this game fails; let me explain
-My biggest issue is the types of playstyles..I particularly like to explore and do not enjoy permadeath. Theres three options, adventure, explore and one permadeath game. Playing 20 hours into a game just to die to lag or some bs death and losing my character is the dumbest idea ive ever heard in any game. So scratch permadeath game mode. Then theres exploration, which is the next dumbest play style ever. You get unlimited lives and can spawn right next to the mob you died to, so you can easily kill even the highest mob in the game if you feel inclined to spawn 1000 times. Then there is adventure mode which is fine I guess as you get a certain amount of lives. 
-This brings me to my 2nd point, dying is so stupid easy. I have accidently entered a portal once and lost 5 lives in a row cause I kept spawning next to a strong mob. I had no escape plan and everytime I spawned I would be screwed. So basically I lost that character on the instance. 
-When you see a mob that you cant kill, you simply get locked into combat until its 2 inches in your face and you have nothing to do but die. There needs to be skills to run away or some type of thing to avoid death sometimes. 
-Overall, the game is quite a joke because it takes no skill at all and simply revolves around knowing the best path to go at your level and what places to avoid. Its basically trial and error until you find the right sequence to progress in the game. 
-Sadly, an awesome world with all these creative mobs only to click on them and destroy them with ease. So theres no real value in finding a rare mob or any cool looking mob because the fight will be over quickly and all you need to do is click a few times. 

Overall, I would tell you, if you enjoy permadeath games and learning very linear gameplay in the style of progression in trial and error then buy it.

Instead of them, Tales of Maj’Eyal focus on tactical gameplay, offering multiple ways to deal with each encounter, with a very rich spells and abilities repertoire. Also, there are so many races and classes combinations to play that it can offer a unique experience each time you play (races have different starting points on the campaign, by the way). And don’t forget the procedural generation: with it, the computer will generate ever changing dungeons and locations to explore – the world map is still the same on every playthrough, thought. 

Curiously, despite being a single player game, Tales of Maj’Eyal has a global chat where you can talk with other players to ask for tips, and you can even donate some of your items there if you want to. But that’s not all! In a middle of a run, sometimes the developer comes in and trigger a special limited event for everybody, so sometimes you can get a free item from him or he can add a special new dungeon with exclusive loot. There’s also scripted events, like on 19th of September ([i]Talk Like a Pirate Day[/i]), when everybody on the server is transformed into a pirate for the sake of it. 

There’s also a few DLCs. Some of them adds [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/404250/Tales_of_MajEyal__Embers_of_Rage/]a new campaign[/url] (that feels like a totally new game), but you don’t need to get them as soon as you buy the base game, since the main campaign will keep you entertained for dozens of hours. If you’re unsure if you will enjoy this game or not, you can download the full version for free from the [url=https://te4.org/]game’s official website[/url]. Don’t worry, your achievements will be transferred to the Steam version as soon as you buy it and connect your old ToME account (more info about that [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/259680/discussions/1/540734168173757236/]here[/url]). 

With a dedicated developer, easy to use  interface, 100% rebindable keys, mouse support for every command, a huge world to explore and unlimited replay value, Tales of Maj’Eyal is one of those games that will survive the test of time. If you’re willing to discover the fantastic world of roguelikes, or even if you’re already a roguelike player and want something fresh, Tales of Maj’Eyal is an excellent choice that is worth both your time and money.

오래 전 마법사들의 자만으로 오크들의 침략을 완전히 끝내기 위한 마법이 실패하는 바람에 일어난 마법폭발은, 세계를 반갈시켜서 끝장내 버렸고 이제 마법사들은 전 지역에서 완전히 미움 받는 존재가 되어버렸다는 아주 중요한 게임 설정을 알아야 함.
 반마법 동호회 일원들은 마법사들의 가죽을 벗기고 목을 따서 마을에 걸어놓기 위해 항상 맵 구석구석을 순찰하고 있고, 반마법 친구들의 선도활동으로 인해 물약과 마법 스크롤은 이 세상에서 영영 사라져 버렸음. 플레이어는 이 세상에 얼마 남지 않은 마법사 견습생으로서 세계를 다시 계몽시켜 마법이 최고인 세상으로 되돌려 놓을 수도 있고, 혼란스러운 세상 정세를 이용해 불멸의 언데드 리치가 되거나 아니면 그냥 다른 마법사 반마법사 정령 언데드 다른 차원 생명체 뭐든 죄다 죽여버리는 파괴신이 될 수도 있음.

[게임 목적]
뽕 차오르는 설정을 가진 여러 직업들로 마즈에얄 대륙을 위협하는 마지막 보스 조져서 세상을 구하는 거임. 그 과정에서 몇 가지 선택을 할 수 있음,

[좋은 점]
현실을 조작하고 다른 애들 꿈에 들어가서 싸우는 유아론자, 시간을 멈추고 적을 미래로 날려버리고 미래의 평행우주 몇 개에서 원하는 미래를 선택해 그 세계로 이동하고, 적의 출생/탄생을 아예 없었던 일로 만들어버리는 괴리술사, 슬라임/점액/곰팡이를 이용해 대자연의 힘으로 마법사들의 기술을 봉쇄하고 녹여 버리는 반마법 점액술사, 양손 무기 하나만 들고 고함 내질러서 매직볼트 총알 화살을 부숴버리고 마법 영창을 못 하게 만들고 수십 칸을 한 턴만에 돌진해서 적을 배갯잇처럼 갈라 버리는 광전사, 증기 발생 장치로 움직이는 전기톱으로 사지를 토막내서 그 신체 부위들을 증기 발생 장치에 갈아버리고 톱 회전력으로 걷는 것보다 빠르게 이동하고 증기공학의 이점을 이용해서 마법들마저 무효화시켜버리는 톱도살자 같은
듣기만 해도 설정충들이 거품 물고 쓰러질 만한 기가 막힌 설정들.
정신이 나가버리고 머리가 돌아버린 신박한 컨셉의 스킬들이 넘쳐남.

이거 때문에 사람들이 이 게임 한다고 해도 과언이 아님.

내 캐릭터 직업의 토 나오게 많은 스킬들을 내가 원하는 대로 찍으면서 RPG의 참맛
수 없이 많은 희귀 아이템들 모으는 끝없는 파밍!


 원래 게임의 참맛은 자기가 게임을 지배하고 완벽하게 통제하고 있다고 착각하고 있을 때 제일 재밌는 거 아니겠음? 스킬 포인트를 하나하나 꼼꼼히 찍어 가면서 완성한 내 캐릭터로 과거에 힘들게 잡았던 보스 몹들을 손쉽게 발라먹으면서 앞에 있을 고난과 시련도 모른 채 게임이 생각대로 굴러간다고 착각하는 건 이 게임에서 느낄 수 있는 최고의 희열임. 해본 사람만 암.

보통 난이도에서는 정해진 스킬 트리만 따라가면 재밌고 수월하게 스토리 보면서 엔딩 볼 수 있음.
고난이도로 올라가면 게임이 개 좆같아지긴 하지만...

[시작하기 전에]
일단은 게임 시작하면 뭐가 뭔지 하나도 모르겠고 너무 게임이 불편하고 가독성 씹구려서 가시성 높이고 가독성 높이는 애드온 깔아야 함. 시작부터 개판임. 뭘 깔아야 할지 모르겠으면 걍 창작마당 들어가서 인기 높은 것 중에서 몇 개 읽어보고 인기 많은데 게임 밸런스에 영향을 안 미치는 거 있으면 그냥 그거 깔면 된다는데 그게 쉽나? 
그 후에 느끼는 건 게임 내에 버그가 존나 많다는 거임. 게임 시작한 후 메인 화면에서도 루아 에러가 낮은 확률로 걸릴 정도임. 게임 안으로 들어가면, 스킬들끼리 지 좆대로  상호작용하면서 아이템에 달린 스킬들도 상호작용하고 거기다가 버그까지 걸리고 가끔씩 내가 잡은 몹들을 한번 더 잡아야 되고, 내가 얻은 아이템을 한번 더 얻게 되고. . .

[문제점1]
이 게임은 몹이 나한테 거는 상태이상이 20가지가 넘음.
 상태이상을 해제하려면 상태이상의 종류를 알아야 함. 그래야 그 상태이상 속성에 맞는 스킬을 쓸 수 있음. 근데, 그 종류는 물리/ 마법/ 정신 상태이상 3가지로 나뉘어지는것도 개같이 고통스럽고 적이 거는 상태이상도 더럽게 많아서 한정적인 스킬 슬롯으로 풀기도 ㅈ같이 빡셈.
 예를 들어 혼란이라는 기술이 있음. 적이 나를 세게 쳐서 물리상태이상으로 혼란을 걸 수도 있고, 초능력을 이용해 내 머리를 헤집어 놔서 혼란이 걸릴 수도 있음(이 혼란은 같은 혼란이라도 물리상태이상이 아닌 정신 상태이상임.) 
아니면 그냥 마법을 사용해 적에게 저주를 걸어 나한테 혼란을 걸 수도 있음. (이 혼란은 마법 상태이상 혼란임)
 그래서 이걸 극복하는 방법이 기본적으로 게임에서 얻는 템 중 스턴/혼란 이런 물리 상태이상 저항템이 나오면 무조건 100퍼센트로 맞추고(죽으면 끝인 게임이니깐)  정신/마법 상태이상을 아예 무효화 시키는 수단을 챙겨야 됨.

이 게임에서 챙겨야 할 게 그것뿐만이 아니라
방어력 체력은 기본적으로 당연히 갖춰야 될 사항이고 (안 갖추면 죽으니깐)
은신한 적 탐지능력도 얻어야 되고 (없으면 뭐에 맞는지도 모르고 죽을 수 있으니깐)
특정한, 게임에서 치명적인 단일 상태이상(스턴,혼란,무장해제같은 물리상태이상)에 대한 내성도 따로 맞춰야 되고
save라고 해서 물리/정신/마법 상태이상 종류에 대한 전체적인 내성도 갖춰야 되고
거기다가 원소 속성 상태이상도 갖춰야 되고...
지랄났다 그죠?

[문제점2]

There is a lot of variety between various rogue-likes out there, but one of the most marvelously addicting elements of ToME is the combination of an enormous adventuring backdrop and plentiful potential for different characters.

Numerous race and class combinations lay the foundation, with a variety of talent trees and progression paths then adding even more options on the table for the enthusiast player to explore--often playing in very different fashions from one another that leave the increasingly elaborate engagements of foes evolving throughout your adventures.  An element which has proven particularly engaging for me has been the broad pool of unlockables one can pursue along the way as well--additional races, classes and even talent trees that, once attained, further and further expand your options with every future character you decide to undertake.

With the adventure laid out in the campaign, there's an enormous amount of content to keep you plenty occupied along the way--and I feel that the way a player can acquaint themselves with persisting familiarity (e.g. particular dungeons having specific different bosses at the end, the risk/reward level of different tiers, etc.) with the unexpected procedural element (dungeon floors and encounters being randomized, many dungeons have multiple entirely different alternate setups from play-through to play-through) affords a sense of overarching progress even as many a character may succumb to permanent peril.

ToME manages to take these foundations to the next level with a number of excellent quality of life / modernization enhancements as evolutions in the genre; with no 'consumables' and a focus on exploration and conquering dungeons over grinding, the pace keeps at a nice clip--and the presence of the chat available to correspond with other players for advice or help along the way is quite neat as well.  For players anxious about the finality, in addition to the traditional 'rogue-like' one death -> done format, there is also 'adventure' mode which provides a slightly more 'generous' pool of lives as you level up--albeit with an ultimate cap.

Almost every class I've played thus far has had plentiful 'active' abilities and skills to play with, affording a lot of tactical maneuvering and thought with tougher engagements--and while the 'tier 1' portion of the game may seem like things are straightforward, once you're acclimated and tackling the higher tiers of content you'll find with growing intensity challenging encounters that require you to think on your toes and use your built-up kit to its fullest to survive.

In the base game there are additional unlockable game modes including the arena, which is also a fine place to test out new character race/class combos through a rigorous gauntlet of combat encounters, to the endless dungeon, which is just what it says on its tin--death is inevitable, but see how deep you can go before it comes.  The core campaign for ToME is -quite- beefy however, and the Embers of Rage expansion adds another follow-up campaign entirely.

All in all, it's been a long time since I've been quite so uniquely hooked and excited about a game like this; even in the face of numerous deaths (and as is proper in these games, almost all were unilaterally 100% my own fault--and every one a lesson and learning experience for future runs,) I keep coming back for more.  Add to this that development continues to this day, with new content, new expansions and other exciting adventures around the corner--and I can see revisiting ToME for a long time to come. 

As you can probably gather from this, I wholly recommend ToME if you're even a little bit interested in the rogue-like genre--there's a phenomenal amount of fun (and fist-shaking bellows to the powers that be) to be found herein.",1518794242,1518794242,True,10,0,0.651562094688415527,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I first met the gameplay of roguelikes in Dungeon Crawl. It was a new world to me. A hard and not forgiving world.  As for today all the classic RPGs seem less interesting and very easy.
 ToME is a bit easy at start of the game compared to other classic rogue-likes (ADOM,Dungeon Crawl e.t.c) but very fun and challenging to play after you get past lvl 15 and mobs wll start hitting the hell out of you :D
A lot of hard-to-play and specific classes. I can even imagine how to best the game playing one of those (i prefer easyer classes like Berserker,Archmage and Bulwark).
The game has a lot of difficulty options, so if you find yourself in some trouble - just create a char on easyer mode or without permadeath.

Tales of Maj’Eyal (ToME) — это, пожалуй, один из самых больших и крупных классических Roguelike’ов на данный момент присутствующих в Steam, создававшаяся как подобие старой ADOM игра в последствии выросла в огромный самостоятельный проект с собственным движком, сайтом, воркшопом и т.д.

Подразумевая под похожестью на классические рогалики, я конечно же имею ввиду устоявшуюся архаичность игры т.е. двигаться можно только по клеточкам, если умираешь, то навсегда и генерация уровней каждый раз происходит заново.

Начинается игра с выбора расы и класса персонажа, которых тут очень много, каждая раса имеет какие-то свои уникальные особенности вроде увеличенных статов, особых навыков, штрафов к опыту и т.д. Какие-то классы, имеют свои особые ветки навыков, мультипликаторы для этих веток, свои билды, ветки развития, используемые предметы и прочее.

Пожалуй, в построении своих билдов и состоит все очарование в ToME, потому как скиллов и персонажей тут очень много и большая часть из них активные, каким-то можно научиться прямо в игре поболтав с внутриигровыми NPC вроде ветки антимагии, а каким то, выполняя скрытые ачивки, вроде убийства подземного босса, за которого можно получить ветку магии земли для следующего прохождения, новые классы кстати тоже получаются подобным образом.

Без внятного плана на игру и без какого-то особого билда, ваша игра закончится достаточно быстро, просто потому, что игра генерирует противников случайным образом, кроме некоторых боссов, что и представляет собой, пожалуй, самую сложную задачу в игре, потому что бывает вполне такое, что какой-нибудь самый обычный враг, даже не редкий и не уникальный, появляется с такими модификаторами, характеристиками и статами, что просто убивает вас за три, четыре удара.

В какой-то степени это весело и добавляет вызова в игру, заставляя отступать и наносить удар вовремя, но с другой стороны из-за банальных ошибок в коде игры, ваш даже самый удачный забег может закончиться очень быстро и неважно насколько вы профессионал, потому что эта игра не на реакцию она о гринде и манчкинстве в самой наивысшей его степени.

Не выбили Bill's Tree Trunk? Раскатали губу на Withering Orbs? Все до свидания! Игру вы уже не пройдете. Конечно я утрирую, именно эти артефакты не самые полезные, но в общем и целом это правда, без лютого манчкинства или везения игру не пройти, причем ладно если бы игра предоставляла возможность перераспределения очков, каждый раз при изменении ситуации в мире игры, но она к сожалению не предоставляет этой возможности и далеко и далеко не все навыки одинаково полезны чтобы их вообще прокачивать.

В принципе к игре сложно придраться в этом плане, так как во всех рогаликах что я когда либо играл есть элементы везения и манчкинства, взять те же one way heroics, the binding of issac, don’t starve, Crypt of the necrodancer и прочие Roguelite игры, но тут когда приходится идти в стартовую локацию эльфов, тратить свое время на то, чтобы выгриндить все живое ради пары копеек на гнома и заодно найти редкие артефакты, то тут конечно становится не до смеха, а потом еще и выясняется, что вы глобально во время игры делали что то не правильно и у вас 20 уровень, хотя у ваших врагов 30, а больше в игре опыта добыть нигде нельзя, так как все локации на карте низкого уровня вы зачистили.

Или вот ещё тут крайне тупые генерируемые миссии сопровождения, у НПС нету никакой защиты и намеков на самосохранение, он говорит на север ты идёшь впереди него на север и он тут же поворачивает направо потому что в него игрой заложен самый короткий путь до телепорта и тут же ловит медведя в лицо и умирает.

Из-за таких неприятных недочетов 5 часов игры улетают в помойку, можешь начинать заново дорогой игрок, там, где в остальных roguelite играх можно сыграть на скилле и вылезти из даже самой безвыходной ситуации, тут же все решает RNG и манчкинство в самом неудачном его проявлении.

Даже не надейтесь начать игру, не прочитав предварительно всю вики по игре и все возможные гайды, порог вхождения очень высокий, не знаете, как работает armor, armor hardiness и Armour penetration? Инфузии и руны? Вам тут и делать нечего, внутриигровой туториал крайне неинформативный и узнать из него как вообще выиграть в эту игру невозможно, вообще в игру невозможно выиграть, предварительно не прочитав вне игры как работают механики, в тоже время во всех остальных рогаликах — это не обязательно условие.

Локации на генерацию очень бедные, меняются крайне несущественно, а то что изменяется не вносит ничего нового, в тоже время они настолько огромны, что приходится использовать специальную кнопку для авто исследования и отдыха, что невероятно затягивает время игры.

Также, локации визуально бедны, вполне обычное дело, что какой-нибудь лес размером в стадион, может состоять из двух деревьев, расставленных просто везде, возможно эта графика и лучше, чем старая ADOM использующая ASCII для изображения графики, но уж точно не для 2012 года, тем более, когда сейчас выходит так много хороших roguelite игр.

Отдельно пару слов о лоре, я так и не понял на самом деле почему игроки в Maj’Eyal превозносят лор игры, изначально игра должна была стать чем, то вроде копии рассказов Толкиена, но потом, что-то пошло не так и в итоге, все скатилось в чернуху, в хорошем смысл... тотальный нацизм, анархизм, наутрализм, сверхестественная хрень (даже по меркам магии) по всей планете — это не шутка в игре есть натуральные концлагеря, средневековые сжигания ведьм, так же прилагаются.

Я конечно понимаю, что мир уничтожили магическим взрывом, все ненавидят магов, произошло тотальное переселение и все такое прочее, а мы потом в конце такие хопа и спасаем мир, но объективно говоря из всех 300 с лишним лорных записок, подавляющая часть из которых пара строчек, мы не узнаем чего-то нового, игра слишком слабо втягивает внутриигровой лор, к происходящему геймплейно и визуально.

Я хоть и ругал лор Dark Souls, но там если ты находишь кольцо пустоты ты можешь ходить по пустоте, что же тут у нас? Void Orb… 15% к сопротивлению аркановой магии, ммм ясно понятно... Эй торгаш! Что ты дашь мне за доспех анигилятора бесконечности, который хотел уничтожить наш мир? 10 золотых? Ну что тут сказать… По рукам!

Если бы вы заходили в темницу DS где пытали пленных вы бы видели черепа, кандалы, ржавые пруты - я незнаю, что угодно! Тут же знаете, как отличаются концентрационные лагеря от обычной деревни? На полу будут валятся три записки, которые будут появляться при каждой новой игре и рассказывающие о лютых зверствах. Это ВСЕ чем отличается какой-нибудь поселок городского типа от лаборатории для опытов над людьми.

Такое чувство, что по тупизне сюжета мы вернулись в первые части Ultima, разве что лазерных бластеров и космических шаттлов не хватает… погодите, это что там вдалеке Огромный Боевой Человекоподобный Робот? 

Подводя итог хочется сказать, что несмотря на то, что в игре весело подстраиваться под сложность врагов и выстраивать свои билды, сам баланс сломан на корню, игра создает обычных мобов способных убить вас с четырех ударов, а некоторых боссов вообще не представляется возможным убить героем ближнего боя, при этом каких-то логических табличек вроде “не влезай убьет” тут просто нет.

Без лютого задротства играть в игру не представляется возможным, а лор игры недостаточно визуализирован, чтобы его хотелось изучать и оставаться в игре. Если уж и соберетесь покупать версию в Steam, то покупайте ее по очень большой скидке, благо полезных донатных плюшек не так много, а сама ToME полностью бесплатна на сайте разработчика.

(With ASCII graphics, because when I was a kid we used to walk both directions in the snow, uphill, to play our PC roguelikes).

As an adult (technically, I guess) I have happily bought this game, ADOM, and Caves of QUD - all true to the original spirit of roguelike RPGs, in my opinion.

Specifically for TOME:

Pros:
* Graphically Accessible - for modern day and age...all the old-school roguelike spirit with reasonably pretty sprites.
* Replay Value - perfectly encapsulates the 'one more turn' feeling that a certain class of gamer like myself craves.
* Non-evil Developers - gamers vote with our wallets. Shut up and take my money, you beautiful developers!! :)

Cons:
* Steep Learning Curve - again, I love these but it might be an individual taste thing. I feel like the game gives you enough info to get you going, but 90% of the game's complexities are underwater, waiting to be explored. If you like deep, meaningful games with tons of choices, a bunch of mechanics to explore, exploit, learn, then go for it!
* I'm trying here. I really am. I just can't come up with anything significant that is worth mentioning. It's a niche game, in a niche genre...and so worth playing whether you're a fan of the genre or not.

Notes:
* Many levels are procedural, but quests are static - this is 100% like ADOM used to be, but it does inherently limit replay value, to some lesser degree, when compared with other models (I thought FTL handled this nicely...retaining the story arc but leaving the order of operations highly variable).",1514497108,1514497108,True,4,0,0.557020843029022217,0,False,False,False,False,,,

On paper this game should be right up my alley. My Steam profile details hundreds of hours spent on rogue-like games which doesn’t count the hours I spent before Steam was even invented.

For a few hours, I was in the zone with an archer type build called ‘Robin’ that was most enjoyable. He explored the world, dealing mass destruction to enemy types that got too close. Fantastic loot was found everywhere and Robin’s character sheet was the dictionary definition of potential.

The character building is most enjoyable for people that like overwhelming stats to comprehend and nurture. Different races and classes are available on character build and then others unlocked as you progress. I liked spending more than a few moments staring at the screen comparing the stats of loot trying to decide whether to keep them or not. Your character learns skills as they level up, some which must be activated whilst others are ‘passive’, remaining on all the time.

I liked that my character had a Ray Bradbury, Illustrated Man feel by having the ability to transfer tattoos on my body, tattoos that can be activated in combat for buffs, instant healing, regeneration and even teleport abilities!
Later on in the game I came across a town with a bunch of vendors that had me drooling and even some sort of strange arena for budding heroes.

Before all that fun though, note TOME is a top down, old-school, simple graphics, bare sound, complex game. A very helpful tutorial helps you on your way and then you are thrown into the deep end. The game can be mostly controlled by mouse and it contains the worst in game map I have ever seen since Wasteland 2.

There were some “One More Go” moments that any gamer wishes for like the Holy Grail. But in the end, the game ground me down. Too many elements of the game unexplained. Too many locations described in-game as suitable for low level characters that ended up being devastating. Too many instant deaths where my character was wiped.

Instant Deaths is the bane of computer gaming and players die not due to their own lack of planning or skill. But to some error of the programmer. 

If you can get around this with superior patience and knowledge, you will be able to find a lot to enjoy in this game. For me it just misses some basic elements that would please me immensely. 

In the end though, the stark reality of some design choices makes me reluctant to recommend this game where on paper I should really love it to bits.

I would recommend Rogue-like

Также у мира достаточно интересный лор с кучей текста, не сказать, что для такого жанра это важно, но это реально сделало мир живым. И еще музыка, саундтрек хорош, за это спасибо.

You start the game with a very limited selection of races and classes, and then must unlock the others as you play. 

That prelude said, the game is relatively linear in that you pick a race and class and start at Level 1. You move through tiered dungeons that never change. The content within them is relatively random except for the dungeon bosses, however the dungeons themselves and the order in which you move through them tends to always stay the same no matter how many times you have been through them or which character you play. The only thing that really does change is the race/class and the points you spend in them as you level up. This is constrained by the fact that certain class/race builds tend to always be more successful than others. In addition, one race in particular - Shalore - is very overpowered making some of the classes you play as Shalore basically an automatic game winner.

The main developer Dark God is very responsive to the community and he works as a volunteer, as is customary in most Open Source projects. You can donate to the game if you like it to help support his efforts. The game is user friendly for Linux and MAC as well.

There is an overworld with things to find and explore, tons of quests, and tons of things to unlock. There is quality lore here that I am enjoying, as well. Many classes have their own mechanics and skill trees, giving each one a unqiue feel. Those at first seemingly complicated systems were actually pretty easy to understand. What helps is there are plenty of tooltips for everything. Just mouse over it and you can see what something does.

The control scheme can take a little to get used to, but it isn't that bad. P is used for skill trees, I for inventory, M for mapping a skill to your hotbar (just drag it down), and Page up/down for different hotbars. Those are the most important and everything can be reassigned to a different key. Pretty much everything else can be done with a right click. The context menu when you right click offers a lot of options and the ability to inspect your enemies, which can be very useful.

Robust levelling trees and a decent amount of skill progression control.
Community is stellar.
Devs actively support game.
Extensive mod support, allowing you to play your way, whether ye be a god, or peasant facing horrible, horrible odds.

Randboss bullshit is always amusing. Can someone please explain how that wolf is operating a bow and arrow?
This is RNGesus's domain. Sometimes you find voratun goodies early!

Cons:
This is RNGesus's domain. He's the monster who made multiclass randbosses that can really ruin your day.
Mechanically beautiful, visually not so much.
Can be a timesink, especially if you play at higher difficulties as the smallest things can mean life or death.

ToME is my first rogue-like, and what attracted me to it was the fact that it looks like the love child of a SRPG and an ARPG.  If that sounds good to you, let me tell you that it really delivers on that promise.  This is essentially a single character game of Final Fantasy Tactics staged across a series of Diablo dungeons.  I love it.

I have hundreds of hours logged so far, and even though I've won a few times, I still feel like I have lots to do if only because of the sheer number of classes and achievements, not to mention that I've yet to move beyond the Normal difficulty level or try any of the numerous community developed add-ons.  Even so, I'm well aware of just how flexible the add-ons make the game.  If you like unlocking everything yourself as I do, there's a fair number of unlocks to chase, but if you want all the classes immediately, you can get the add-on that does that.  Play how you want to!

Speaking on which, if you are turned off by by the idea of a rogue-like but otherwise think this looks interesting, it's worth knowing that the default mode is the more forgiving ""Adventure"" mode, which is more akin to the limited continues of an old-school NES game.  The game remains hard, but with some practice, a few extra lifes prove to be a pretty good cushion.  There's even an ""Exploration"" mode with unlimited lives if you'd really rather be sure you can finish.

The game still gets updates as well, and that looks likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  There are two additional DLCs in the works at the moment, as well as occasional updates to the core game for balancing or even the occasional new class.  Good stuff.

There are tons of classes with different skills that allows different playstyle though it does go with my one complaint - too many of these classes rely on just a differently named resource bar (i.e. renamed mana) though some do have unique ways of generation/replenishment.

Damage of certain magic/ranged enemies can also be reduced as they can 1 or 2-shot you and newbies are advised to avoid ""vaults"". This does somewhat restrict builds to require some sort of ""ohshit"" button or certain damage migitation skills. Melee classes are naturally harder to play/weaker because of this. Randomness on drops (but what's a roguelike without this?) and escort quests can also be annoying but that can be worked around because..

Now imagine the opposite, a pretty meh character you don't care for never getting the right stuff you want. He somehow survives twice as long as previous character.

Even though they both die, you probably managed to unlock a new class, or race or skill tree on top of all the already existing choices, allowing you to try for a fresh start with a character that can play completely different than the previous one, which combined with random elements make it surprisingly replayable.

Nightmare difficulty is my recommended difficulty, it helps speed the starter levels up which is great when you are constantly remaking characters on permadeath (which I recommend over the lives system personally), as well as adding more rare encounters.

Its worth the 7$, otherwise you can get the base game for free as well from the game's website. I played it for years, and purchased the game on steam later to support the development. Plays well on both linux and windows.

Der Wiederspielwert ist dementsprechend hoch. 

Ich kann das Spiel nur empfehlen. Bringt eine Menge Zeit mit!

There a several reasons for that. The acessible graphics and interface helped, but what truly sets ToME apart is how it blends the roguelike formula with more traditional RPG elements AND an amazing tactical turn-based combat.

First, it's a roguelike, but you unlock new classses and races as you play, so there's a sense a progression things even if you die. And if you don't enjoy losing your character you can disable permadeth - or give youself some extra lives.

The world is fixed, but races/classes have different starting points and many quests have multiple solutions, so there's always something new to see or try in each playthrough. In one your Psionic Dwarf might become a mage hunter that vows to never use magic items, in the other your Elven Necromancer might join an evil warlock and raid the mage hunters.

Finally, the classes, races and items are all designed to offer you plenty of choices in combat. ToME will throw crazy challenges at you, but it also offers crazy powers - travel back in time, turn into a demon, redirect damage, teleport, raise walls, summon tsunamis, become a lich, etc. It's never about level or DPS - what's important is using your skills wisely.   

So if you always wanted to try a roguelike but ADOM, NetHack and other classics never got you hooked, try ToME. :)",1511419110,1511419349,True,45,0,0.827586174011230469,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Tome 4 é um roguelike (está bem, eu confesso que sou apaixonado por este estilo de jogo) código aberto, totalmente desenvolvido em lua, extremamente divertido e old school. A melhor forma de descrever o tome 4 seria como um roguelike super tunado, isso porque além das características comuns aos jogo estilo rogue como morte permanente e calabouços gerados a cada partida, ele ainda possui melhorias como gráficos caprichados ainda que sejam apenas tiles, possui áudio dos monstros e espadas em combates, alem de possuir um tema musical muito gostoso de se ouvir enquanto é jogado. 
Mas as melhorias que realmente me impressionaram no tome 4 é o fato do jogo ser mundo aberto, diferente de outros roguelikes como stone soup, onde você explora apenas uma masmorra. Outro ponto interessante é o game também possuir quests e trama interligando todos os acontecimentos.
Outra inovação do tome 4 é o jogo possuir recursos online. Deixa eu explicar. Você infelizmente não vai poder jogar cooperativamente com outros players, nem desafia-los, mas poderá se comunicar com outros players em tempo real, seja para pedir dicas ou comemorar quando matar um monstro poderoso. O modo online também comunica a todos os jogadores de forma automática quando um determinado player completa uma quest, passa de level ou encontra algum segredo. E o melhor, ele grava todas as informações do seu jogo no site do tome 4, lá você pode comparar seu personagem com o de outros amigos e até estimular uma disputa para ver quem consegue evoluir e ir o mais longe possível.
O jogo não é tão difícil como seu irmão stone soup. Mas está longe de ser uma baba, os jogadores casuais vão sofrer um pouco no inicio, mas vão se apaixonar quando entender o funcionamento. Para finalizar gostaria de dar algumas dicas ao jogadores iniciantes:
Algumas classes são desbloqueadas após jogatinas no game, então fique esperto para explorar o máximo que conseguir, isso te garantirá mais opções de escolha de classes em futuros games.
Abuse das suas skills, elas são importantes para te manter vivo em muitas batalhas.
Evite carregar tudo que encontrar nos calabouços, leve apenas o que encontrar de valor, isso evita você ficar pesado e receber penalidades em combates.
Aperte J no teclado para abrir as quests disponíveis, siga a ordem delas para evitar entrar em uma área com monstros muito fortes para seu level.
Venda sempre seu loot na cidade para conseguir mais dinheiro para equipamentos.
Evite lutar com vários monstros de uma só vez, busque no cenario locais onde possa enfrentar um por um.
Recomendo o jogo para todos aqueles que adoram jogos de exploração no estilo rogue. Alem de tudo o jogo é gratuito fora da steam. Terminei comprando na steam para ajudar mesmo, mas tenho muitas horas de tome4 desde a epoca de sua primeira versão.

The class roles are deeper than any other roguelike I've played with Diablo-style leveling trees for every class and several opportunities to learn secondary trees from quests. ToME also has a well written and extremely lore-intensive story, setting it apart from more barebones games like DCSS. Try it out, it's free. Or buy it!

[h1]Я пройдусь по всем основным пунктам игры, как рогалика. Постараюсь писать кратко, но объемно:[/h1]

[list]
 [*]Игру можно бесплатно скачать на сайте. Никаких подводных камней. За покупку игры и — по желанию — дополнений, игроку присваивается статус донатера (как назвал разработчик), дается один дополнительный класс (которых в игре итак 33), и пара приятных, косметических плюшек. 

 [*]В ToME отсутствуют ""проклятые вещи"", рандомные зелья, несбалансированные ваншоты и т.д. 99% смертей можно избежать (1% приходится на баги), если ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО(!) захотеть: в некоторых случаях достаточно было нажать другую кнопку на прошлом ходу, в других же потребовалось бы подготовиться заранее; а все ваншоты - предсказуемы (конкретные типы урона/враги/дебафы etc). 

 [*][b]В игре много классов[/b], которые разделены на мета классы и сабклассы.

Метакласс — разбойник, воин, маг и т.д.

Сабкласс — подкласс (класс персонажа, которым мы будем играть) у каждого метакласса. У разбойников, к примеру, будут ""классический разбойник"", ""теневой клинок"" и другие. У остальных метаклассов — аналогично, но с другими сабклассасми.

Геймплей у сабклассов внутри метакласса очень похож (хоть и не всегда), геймплей между метаклассами различается существенно. Например у ""классического разбойника"" и ""теневого клинка"" очень много общего, а геймплей, в целом, идентичен (хотя и не во всех билдах!). А вот геймплей разбойников и магов (или любых других мета классов) отличается существенно

[b]Присутствуют уникальные классы[/b], а так же нестандартные гибриды и гибриды гибридов.

У классов сильно различается кривая сложности прохождения игры: некоторые уже на первых уровнях получают такой набор умений, какой другим не увидеть и в конце игры, что выливается в легкий ерли гейм для первых и в сложных - для вторых.
Некоторые классы уже в начале игры вынуждены кайтить там, где другие фейсролят и райт(лефт)кликают. У некоторых классов в середине игры, внезапно, открываются способности к ведению ближнего/дальнего боя, которых вы не заметили у них в начале игры. Кому-то нужно оружие/броня/конкретный спелл, вокруг которого можно было бы строить бой. И т.д. и т.п. 

Все это несколько блекнет на низких уровнях сложности, коих тут, к слову, пять.

 [*][b]5 уровней сложности и три типа смерти[/b] (пермадес, несколько жизней, и бесконечные жизни — для донатеров). 4-ая и 5-ая сложности открываются за победу на предыдущей.

Начиная с 4-ой кол-во редких (и выше) врагов увеличивается, что делает игру куда более интересной (соотношение сложность/награда за сложность). Так же повышаются их хар-ки и уровень.

 [*][b]Генерация мира довольно слабая[/b]: статичный мир, генерируемые подземелья. Около 40% всех игровых местностей нарисованы разработчиком (целиком локация или же её кусок). Оставшаяся генерируемая часть не особо влияет на геймплей (точнее не так сильно, как хотелось бы от рогалика). Хотя есть и свои отличительные нюансы (например локации с узкими коридорами, в которых не развернуться, обширные пустые локации, где негде прятаться, лабиринты, где можно быть зажатым в пару ходов и т. д.).

 [*][b]Генерация врагов вполне сносная[/b]: большинство врагов, чей уровень выше «белого», представляют собой какой-то класс или гибрид классов (против одних опасно воевать на месте, против других опасно получить контроль, ибо из него не выйдешь итд), но иногда бывают убойные комбинации, когда существо с высокой скоростью получает способности класса с высокой скоростью атаки и парные кинжалы с высокой скоростью атаки — можно получить 10+ атак за ход. Если у врага будет бонус «+Х урона к каждой атаке» - будет больно. Но бывают и боссы-крыски, что умирают за тычку. 

 [*][b]Генерация предметов является системой суффиксов[/b], дополненная цветом (качеством) и уровнем предмета. Частота выпадения и качество лута претензий не вызывает, плюс в игре есть предметы-артефакты, нарисованные разработчиком. То есть их хар-ки не генерируются, они всегда одинаковые; артефакты со специальными эффектами, на которых могут строится целые билды. Частота выпадения вполне приемлема (с учетом того, каким образом можно получать артефакты в игре.  Сами разберетесь, если будете играть).

Есть возможность перекинуть шмотки на другого чара (правда способ этот... Ну не самый легкий и удобный).

 [*][b]Итог по генерации[/b]:

Мир/подземеья — слабая, почти не влияющая.

Враги — ничего нового, но неплохо сбалансировано и представляет, как интерес, так и сложность. Рандом, который порой дает бесплатный лут, а временами заставляет пробежать по всей локации, в попытке раскайтить врага, но в целом — годно.

Лут — вполне хорошая генерация, есть мусор, есть из чего выбирать, радуешься классным шмоткам, не успеваешь заскучать в ожидании новой. Вполне можно расчитывать на определенные РАНДОМНЫЕ предметы (да, такой вот парадокс).

 [*][b]Способности классов продуманы и сбалансированы[/b]. Также, если при прочтении способностей на первых уровнях вы видите сильные связки, то так оно и будет, когда вы их выучите (за очень, очень редким исключением). Разработчик не лишает игроков фана, занижая силу/эффективность. С другой стороны враги обладают аналогичными способностями. 
Хотя зависимость от сильных способностей/связок, что вы будете брать каждый раз, игнорируя при это другое, вполне может появиться... Но это уже на выбор игрока. 
В целом: интересно, есть разнообразие билдов, есть место для придумывания своих.

 [*][b]Игра предоставляет хорошие возможности для микроменеджмента[/b], но это не обязательно. Просто за определенные классы играть будет сложнее, если вы не любите осматривать всех врагов, продумывать способности и движение, использовать и менять активируемые предметы и тд. 

 [*][b]В игре килотонны текста[/b] в виде историй, что подаются посредством записок, дневников и аналогов. Готовьте английский.

 [*][b]В игре открытый исходный код[/b]: аддоны (на офф. Сайте/в клиенте игры, некоторые еще и в стиме) для облегчения жизни, с новыми классами, с фиксами, с читами итд.

Можно редактировать файлы игры самому: язык логичный, весь код аккуратно разбит самими разработчиками, а все «нужные» данные/цифры выделяются Notepad'ом автоматически, что позволяет сразу находить нужную информацию. Папки с файлами, так же, удобно отсортированы.

В коде присутствуют комментарии разработчика. Немного, но полезные и порой — забавные. Даже обидно, что большинство игроков их не увидят, пусть и пару строчек.

[*][b]Достижений в игре раз в 7 меньше, чем написано[/b] т.к. бОльшая часть (но не вся) - является дубликатами одной и той же ачивки, но на разной сложности/типе смерти. Синхронизация ачивок присутствует, а потому пройдя игру на сложном режиме можно сразу же получить ачивки и на более низком, просто нажав пару кнопок.

[*][b]В игре присутствует онлайн чат[/b] с оповещением смертей, ачивок, линкованием рандомных шмоток и обсуждениями игровой составляющей на англ. языке. Чат живой в дневное время: помогают с билдами и игровой механикой, радуются выпавшим шмоткам, и редким ачивкам. Да и пообсуждать смерть того или иного персонажа тоже могут. Частенько мелькают люди участвующие непосредственно в разработке игры/конкретных классов. Нередко можно узнать новости о будущих дополнениях, поделиться идеями о реворках/нерфах/бафах.

[*][b]Есть возможность настроить размеры деталей интерфейса и их положение[/b] без танцев с бубном. Дополнительные панели и их положение на экране. Несколько типов внешнего вида UI. ""Отдалить камеру"" можно путем уменьшения размеров тайтлов в опциях.

[*][b]Имеется ASCII режим[/b]. По умолчанию отключен.
[/list]


[i][h1]PS базовая сложность игры - ""нормал"" (2/5). 
Я же играю на ""Инсейне"" (4/5), и считаю именно эту сложность - стандартом: старт немного нудноват, зато  мид-лейт гейм очень и очень хорош.  
Мой вам совет: не играйте в демку, сразу открывайте Insane, и получайте удовольствие от настоящей игры!

It was my second Roguelike game that I played seriously and totally fell for it.
I'll jott down some of the main reasons:
[list]
[*] Incredible different play styles depending on the class/builds, I had never seen something remotely approaching before
[*] Despite this a remarkable overall balance
[*] Excellent system of meta-progression
[*] Deep lore, lots of love here from the developper
[*] Great tactical combat system, not too hard, not too easy
[*] Huge and helpful community
[*] Always being updated with new contents and fixes
[*] TE4.org that keeps forever the memory of the fallen heroes 
[*] Not only for hardcore Roguelike fans, difficulties settings for everyone
[/list]

As nothing is perfect I'll suggest a few improvements, which I am not the first to make:
[list]
[*] Part of the second half of the game is kinda repetitive and plain grinding, namely [spoiler] the Orc Fortresses [/spoiler], there is room for improvement here. The character has almost reached its peak performance at this stage, the focus should be on story rather than mob genocide.
[*] Limited vault size even for fully purchased game
[/list]

To conclude, if you are a RPG enthusiast and can tolerate retro graphics you MUST buy this game.

Aber es ein Roguelike zu nennen, trifft es eigentlich nicht wirklich. 

Es hat eine große Kampagne, für die ich über 60 Stunden gebraucht habe. Man hat unzählige Texte zum lesen, also jede menge Lore über die Welt, die Rassen, die Artefakte..usw. die tlw. wirklich gut und spannend geschrieben sind (alles Englisch) - und ich habe noch lange nicht alles erforscht und gesehen. Obwohl ich mir Mühe gegeben hatte, jeden Winkel zu erforschen, habe ich gerade mal 1%(!), ja, -ein- Prozent der Errungenschaften.

Man wählt aus vielen, auch recht ungewöhnlichen Rassen und Klassen, Fähigkeiten, Zaubern, Infusions, Gegenständen, Artefakten und was-weiß-ich noch alles. Zu Beginn, also beim ersten Spielen, ist man jedoch auf sehr wenige (Rassen, Klassen) begrenzt, man schaltet durch Spielen immer mehr frei.

Beim Spielen sind die Levelaufstiege und auch der Loot, also neue Ausrüstung, von Anfang bis zum Ende sehr befriedigend. Man weiß oft nicht, was man nehmen will, weil die Auswahl so gut ist. Und auch weil das System sehr komplex ist - bei weitem nicht alles versteht man auf Anhieb - aber im Laufe der Spielstunden kommt das fast nebenbei. 

Anfangs, die ersten Stunden, dachte ich, daß das Spiel viel zu leicht ist. Ich hätte gerne etwas, wo man nachdenken und taktieren, den Charakter und die Ausrüstung optimieren muss. Aber das kommt! In einer perfekten Lernkurve, bis hin zu einem sehr anspruchsvollen Schwierigkeitsgrad.

Is that a problem?

Not at all. The awesome class mechanics, dungeons and range of items more then makes up for the lack of pleasing visuals and I had a blast playing the game so far.

Allow me to relate two encounter my archer had that hopefully illustrate the brilliant randomness from the game:

1) Carefully exploring a dungeon she was jumped by two vampires who disarmed and offbalanced her. Being helpless she struck her rune of random teleportation and vanished from the vampires eyes!

Only to appear smack in the middle in a huge oval room filled to the brim with HUGE spiders, still disarmed and off balance. She managed to survive by jumping over six ranks of spiders into a corridor and fighting them one by one but it was some frantic combat.

2) Walking in an empty room my archer walked to the far wall where some items where on the floor, avoiding a so called lava floor in the middle. When she picked up an item four walls slid back and four powerfull orcish mages surrounded her utterly. Surrounded by four spellcaster who could toast her easily (she couldnt shoot more then one due to their placing and they had heaps of status affects that would completely render her helpless) she used her rune and vanished!

Only to re-appear in the same room smack in the middle of the lava ground, still surrounded by no doubt snickering orcish mages. RIP archer. May their death be as painfull as yours was.

That brings me to my last remark: Don't play this game to succeed, play this game to have fun exploring and expecting horrible death at every corner. Never get careless for death can hide EVERYWHERE!

(There are however modes to give you more life so worry not if you like your mayhem more casually and forgiving)

具体说就是，你先在效果限定时间的数回合内正常进行行动，然后跳回到数回合前，再进行行动，再跳回一次，再行动，一共行动三次，根据结果来选择其中比较满意的一次作为现实。

这个例子已经很强大了，还有个装备的例子也很有意思，叫“命运之轮”，是个戒指，应该算是欧皇之戒，因为它的特效是随机重置戒指的属性。

但是重置次数是有限制的，每3级获得一次机会，并且，在没有重置机会同时没到50级的情况下，不能卸下戒指。。这游戏，50级算是后期了，所以前期要是运气不好，随机到对职业没好处的属性就有点难受，这倒没什么，但是重置时的系统提示有点耐人寻味：

Hands down the pinnacle of Turn-Baased Strategy RPGs.   

Classes that truly feel different and unique.   A well written campaign that will honestly take you nearly 40 hours to complete your first time. A sliding difficulty level to challege the greatest tacticians to a nice and casual adventure game. Randomly generated items, dungeons, bosses and world events.

Once you think you've seen it all the game will throw you a curveball surprising you with new locations and events.

Be ready to spend hundreds of hours in this game!

Think Darksouls.

I do not know of any other games where you can feel overpowered at high levels while actually fighting enemies that can easily kill you, if you are stupid, let your guard, try to rush or underestimate enemies.

So many moments, where you just stand there after a seemingly hopeless fight that you got yourself into and ask yourself: ""How am I still alife?"" Then you collect the loot, get to town and say: ""Yeah it was totaly easy, no big deal"" and then get credit for beeing the hero, they think you are.

Do that a couple of times and you notice that your gear doesn't look as shabby as when you started out. You notice, that you actually filled you whole skillbar or maybe two and remember how each and every one of them safed your life at some point, not to mention those cool wings you got now, or the sick looking aura.

And when you think that nothing could kill you now, the game throws something at you, that you were not prepared to deal with and you try frantically to search for things you can do to survive . . .

I am kinda subjective, because I am writing this, just after having fought a random monster, that I could just not kill even after many hundred rounds. Giving up, running away with my tail between my legs while getting hunted even outside the dungeon by other monsters that would easily kill the weakened me. Got better tactics/gear, tried again and again and finally got him. It was the first time I had to actively change my gear in midbattle, it was the first time I had to use skills and effekts that I thought were absolutely useless, but proved essential. 

Many solo-games can't teach you the advanced skills you can do with a game, simply because you never need them.
This one does not teach you either, nooooo. It just throws more and more difficult problems your way and says: 
""Do or die."" And with a permadeathsystem in place . . .  well you realy don't want to repeat the last 20+ hours do you?
So start thinking how to get our of this mess you got yourself into . . . again.

my ONLY qualm is that it's so hard sometimes even on normal roguelike setting  that i get frustrated and quit.  i put almost 200 hours into it and i still havent managed to beat the game on normal roguelike. i refuse to use adventure mode though, having multiple lives feels like cheating to me.   i ALMOST got to the boss on one character but got REKT by some random miniboss rare mob spawn, so sad.

buy this game if you like LOTS OF CLASSES, RACES, SKILLS, epic loot, powerful spells and VERY challenging combat.

so many quality of life features like autoexploring a map to get new characters leveled up quickly.

actually i have one more qualm, the dungeons aren't varied enough for my taste so after your 30th character you kinda get tired of doing the same 5 or 6 starter dungeons every time.

Tales of Maj'Eyal - это много лет существующий и отлично зарекомендовавший себя ""рогалик"": умер - давай ещё раз. 
Сразу хочу сказать, что игра бесплатна и доступна на оф сайте для скачивания, но купить на распродаже её вместе со всеми аддонами за какие-то 150р - идеальное вложение средств и превосходная благодарность разработчикам! 

Присутствует и автоматическая генерация подземелий, несмотря на статичную ""Карту Мира"". Это добавляет некоторую изюминку, согласитесь.
Хотелось бы отметить и тот факт, что если играешь далеко не в первый раз, уже знаешь все локации на карте, представляешь, где искать нужные артефакты с боссов и имеешь представления о местах, которые стоит посещать в первую очередь - это только плюс, так как теперь можно перейти на уровень выше по сложности и попробовать себя там. 

Приятно радует обилие рас, классов и талантов, которые не доступны сразу, а открываются по мере игры. Это лишь подогревает интерес и прямо таки заставляет перепройти игру снова, взглянув на неё под другим углом.

Так же плюс - в игре присутствует Мастерская, в которой имеется множество интересных улучшений, доработок, настроек. 
Онлайн статистика игры на сайте не дает заскучать и позволяет просмотреть как свои, так и чужие результаты похождений по миру Maj'Eyal
Ну и, конечно же, английския язык. Ввиду того, что это всё же RPG - местами присутствует тонна текста лора, немало специфическим параметров и характеристик, что, порой, заставляет посидеть со словарем в стремлении догнать суть происходящего. И это так же положительный момент, ведь нет ничего лучше саморазвития и стремления к совершенствованию.

It swiftly hits that Goldilocks zone between randomization and hand-crafting of the world that makes a roguelike fun to play, and not a random unpredictable mess. Because the Unique and Elite mobs have randomized skill sets, there will be the occasional OMGWTFBBQ moment when a character gets oneshotted by some overpowered RNG fluke, but usually one will know the exact decision that led to a characters death, and mostly it was not retreating when all teleports were on cooldown.

I start the game, the menu is well designed and easy to navigate and pleasant.  The music is good to boot!

Then I press the ""New Game"" button and prepare myself to create my very first character.  Sitting at the edge of my seat my imagination goes wild with the vast array of possibilities. 
Then the best part, the screen goes black and fidgets and the game pops up with a ""an error has occured"" page and asks if I would like to report it.  Being of sound mind and body, I decide to report it.  The game then restarts and I am free to roam the menus free from errors once again.

In closing I will say that this game is a wonderful addition to the burgeoning Menu Simulator genre.  A genre that I truly hope continues to grow as game developers show love and attention in creating games that function properly.

Note: I will expand this review if and when I get the game to run as advertised.  Furthermore,  I will change this to review to recommend the game if one of two things happens.
1. If the game developer changes the genre to ""Fantasy Menu Simulator"" and advertises it as such. OR
2. If a patch comes out, making it so that as a consumer I do not need to immediately fix the ""finished"" product I have purchased and the game is indeed as fun as it looks.

As it sits, based on my experience I cannot recommend this game even if it were free.  Due to the fact that from my current expercience and perspective I would be telling people to install a game that cannot make it past the menu.

Edit: Thanks to a very helpful fan of the game I have found out that the game is indeed free and you may find it at https://te4.org

However, this does not change my opinion.  I cannot recommend spending time trying to get a game to run that has been out since 2012, and has been actively updated and patched since that time (again huge props to the dev for that) but still is difficult to get running on a mid-level gaming PC.  I understand some long standing fans will disagree with me, and that is fine, this is a free country after all.

Final Edit: Clearly the fans of this game are dedicated.  So, if this game can inspire the kind of loyalty I witnessed since writing one long-winded negative review than it must be a good game, because the mob is never wrong. Thank you.

1. DEPTH - This game is the holy grail of roguelikes, a hidden diamond in the rough -- if you like the roguelike genre at all and don't have this game, buy it immediately. The depth is insane and best of all it manages to break out of the ""fantasy"" cliché of classes while still maintaining core principles of a turn based roguelike. Some of the concepts are so foreign that you won't initially understand the mechanics and you're like ""what the actual #$%& does this do"", but once you learn the mechanics they add a whole new layer of fun to the game that's all but lost in games today.

2. MECHANICS - It's like nothing you've ever seen. Each class and race is eerily unique in several ways and is filled with all kinds of new and interesting ideas. “Wait, I can melee with mind abilities?”

3. ITEMIZATION - Lots of gear, lots of stats, lots of resist types, lots of damage types, lots of status effects, lots of ""hmmm I wonder if this piece is better"" or ""I really should put these points into health, but I can't say no to more damage and if I kill them fast, they can’t hurt me! Right?""  Changing gear usually requires a compromise of offense, defense and knowledge of what your character can handle.

4. CHALLENGE - Took me ~85 gameplay hours to beat the game on Normal, I probably lost 20-30 characters before successfully winning. It's possible that I'm just really bad, but I like to think the game is just really challenging. Also, the beginning of the game is not easy, it's quite difficult; I remember thinking ""Wow I just died 3 times in the first starting zone.""

5. SKILLS - A huge variety of skills, trees, opportunities and playstyles. This makes for fun and inventive combos, skill synergy and interesting deaths. ""Hellll yeah I got a skill that lets me move through walls, oh #$%! I just suffocated in the wall.""

6. MONSTERS - A massive monster variety, each time you play you'll start to notice the different monster types, their skills, strengths and weaknesses. On higher difficulties, it's extremely important to know what you're going up against to get that next level advantage. “OHHHH #$%* another necromancer.”

7. ACTIVE DEV & COMMUNITY - Active development on the game, balance patches, new classes, races, and content (DLC). The community is great, can be very helpful and from my experience non-toxic (I guess we're not call of duty scrubs). As a bonus, every now and then you'll see messages from the DarkGod (DEV) who bestows you with some random buff for ""absolutely no reason.""

8. DEATH - You will die a lot. You will rage. You will learn from your mistakes. You will make the same mistakes again, die, and rage more. You will lose multiple lives to the same monster because you’re too stubborn to choose the “safe” option when talking to the ghost lady after you die. You will switch to another class because the one you were playing before felt 'weak' and this other class has GOT to be better, but then later go back to the first class because you now understand that it's really strong and you were just bad. You will die to the first boss in the first zone ON NORMAL and come to some inevitable realizations about how the game is meant to be played.

J'y ai déjà joué 70h et j'ai l'impression de n'avoir fait que l'effleurer.

+ Je n'ai pas encore débloqué toutes les classes et les races jouables mais je suis déjà bluffé, chacune à son style de jeu propre. Chaque classe a au moins une ou deux catégories de compétence qu'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs. En dehors de la santé, très peu de classes ont des ressources en commun, certaines utilisent le mana, certaines l'endurance, d'autres l'équilibrium, d'autres encore un mélange de plusieurs, etc. ce qui pourrait paraître un gadget si chacune n'avait pas sa manière de fonctionner. Par exemple pour regagner l'endurance, il suffit d'attendre sans l'utiliser par contre pour l'équilibrium, il démarre à 0 et plus il est élevé plus les compétences lancées avec ont de chance d'échouer. Les classes sont donc bien différentes les unes et autres et souvent elles ont même plusieurs manières d'être jouées, ce qui laisse à penser que tout le monde pourra trouver son style. Un avertissement cependant, certaines classes sont (de mon avis personnel) plus ou moins puissantes ce qui permet d'une certaine manière de moduler la difficulté mais ça peut aussi surprendre parfois.

+ Et d'ailleurs, maintenant que j'en parle de la difficulté, sachez qu'elle est au rendez-vous. Dans ToME, il n'y a pas cette sensation des premiers niveaux difficiles et une fois qu'on a monté son perso on roule sur tout le monde. Que nenni, on trouvera toujours un challenge à sa hauteur (en sachant que je n'ai jamais fini le jeu je m'avance peut être un peu mais je ne pense pas). Plus votre perso est complexe et peut gérer de situations problématiques, plus l'éventail de ces situations sera large et simultané.

+ Un autre grand atout de ce jeu, c'est tout ce qu'on peut débloquer. Ça peut aller d'un nouvel élément à utiliser pour les mages à un nouveau mode de jeu en passant par de nouvelles races et classes. C'est toujours un plaisir de débloquer un nouvel élément dans ce jeu et ça se fait souvent au prix de longs efforts et d'expériences répétées de morts approchées.

+ Un aspect de ce jeu que j'aime particulièrement, c'est le lore. Je trouve l'univers de ce jeu réellement intéressant et avec des choix dans l'histoire du monde que je n'ai pas vu souvent, voire jamais. Je ne m'étendrais pas plus sur ce sujet, je vous laisse découvrir...

+ Et je n'ai pas encore abordé la chose la plus incroyable dans ce jeu : vous pouvez y jouer gratuitement avec seulement quelques options en moins (une classe et deux campagnes il me semble) en le téléchargeant sur le site officiel. De quoi vous laisser l'essayer autant que vous voulez avant de soutenir ou pas ce jeu (ce que j'ai fait par ailleurs).

- Ceci dit, je ne suis pas payé par l'éditeur pour vous servir uniquement des compliments béats, il y a aussi des défauts dans ce jeu. Le premier qui me vient en tête, c'est vraiment le niveau des quêtes. Autant je suis fan de l'univers et je dévore tout le lore que je trouve, autant les seuls quelques personnages qui vont vous adresser la parole en dehors de la quête principale sont tout droit sortis d'un mauvais scénar de donjons & dragons. Hormis une ou deux quêtes travaillées il n'y a pas grand chose.

- Un autre point négatif c'est la difficulté qu'on peut éprouver parfois quand on doit choisir entre deux équipements. Les stats sont légions et à moins de savoir exactement ce qu'on cherche, ça peut rapidement devenir infernal.

- Le dernier point qui me semble important, c'est la frustration que ce jeu peut apporter. C'est très possible voire très probable que vous ayez enfin réussi à dépasser le niveau 20, le monde semble à votre portée et pourtant vous vous faites bloquer au milieu d'un level par un élite exceptionnellement fort accompagné du boss du niveau qui vous achèvent en 5 coups malgré toutes vos précautions. C'est extrêmement rageant et c'est certainement la raison pour laquelle je n'ai que 70 heures.


Résumé : 

+ grande diversité des classes
+ chaque action compte ...
+ ... et pour les autres il y a des raccourcis
+ les choses à débloquer
+ le lore
+ majoritairement gratuit (pas f2p ou p2w, hein j'ai bien dit gratuit)

- un peu compliqué à prendre en main au début
- frustrant quand on perd au niveau 15 contre un élite un peu craqué qu'on a pas vu venir...
- totalement injuste (mais c'est aussi pour ça qu'on l'aime ^^)
- les quêtes

+- vraiment difficile

Partially I take issue with the perma death mechanic. I tend to like games with permadeath as far as rougelike games go. Nethack is amazing a gritty survival game and every playthrough is unique and you feel fragile and human through out it. ToMEs playthroughs all start roughly the same and get better 10/15 levels in. Those first 10 levels are a slog after you have done it a couple of time. Pouring 10 hours into a character then getting a clumsy death when you are on you last life is pretty painful because you have to restart with the same plot, with the same dungeons, and often with the same unique item drops. It becomes uninviting. 

Exploration mode you say then.. but that has no penalty taking away the tension completely. You need a middle mode between exploration and adventure, perhaps losing all your items (bar the three stocked in your box) for a continue? Or at least gaining a life after a major boss. If you pour 10,15,20 hours before dying its a huge time investment and its very punishing. Particularity because the early game is relatively dull. More choice and divergent paths in the early game might help. 

After a death you pretty much have to play with a different class (which are all brilliantly designed and play fluidly with so many build styles changing gameplay/strategy considerably) and it can take awhile to get to grips with how that class functions often this can result in silly deaths. Which is the bizarre thing that you have to play a class to have a good idea of how you want to build it, but due to the time commitment you would rather restart with a different class then master one.

Basically if you have a lot of time to try the different classes and get good go for it! The amount of depth in the character builds is staggering with some really awesome stuff. (I love the time manipulation ones which you can really mess around with placements and divide and pool enemies together) but all of them offer valid play styles, from adaptable to min-maxing synergies. The depth of build is the real core strength of this game and trying a new class is what makes you play again after a bad beat. There are very little games with this much content and its a lot of value for money. 

Pros:

Intelligent strategic gameplay

Huge choice of classes and viable builds within classes offering dozens of different play-styles

Challenging game play and while your character improves to godly levels it remains challanging

Enormous amount of content and most of it at a surprisingly high quality

Interesting and engaging mechanics which meaningfully change the game with different classes.

Cons:

Same starting areas get samey 

Punishing consecutive mistakes. 5 bad minutes can destroy a 15 hour playthrough

Weak overwritten lore has potential but is wordy and unengaging with hard to believe motivations between groups

Some bugs that need ironing out

Some mechanics are poorly explained and pretty unclear.

Not really a game that is forgiving to people with a job/relationship/other interests huge time sink with very little value outside of its mechanics 


Would I recommend? Absolutely. Very few games this good at this price range play a few times get some decent playthroughs going then put it down and maybe pick it up again later.",1496890270,1497282701,True,55,1,0.825280129909515381,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Never trust a positive review from a guy saying ""this is the best game ever"" but has only 5h playing it. So many games look great at first, only to be forgotten in a week or two.

Now, take a look at some of the reviews for this game. There are people with over a 1,000 hours of ToME behind them. This says a lot about the game's depth, replayability and just sheer fun factor.

I've been a fan of roguelikes for a long time now (maybe for over 15 years? who knows?), and this is hands down the best one I've ever played. The designer knew what to focus on instead of flooding the game with half-implemented features that end up taking away from the fun of the game. There is no hunger, consumables etc. Heck, even crafting was only added in a recent DLC, and even then it's only a small detail.

So what is there that it has? The best and most creative class-system ever seen in an RPG game, together with a great tactical combat system, with enemies potentially having access to the same skills as the player. I mean, in this game you can be a chronomancer and one of your skills called ""See the threads"" allow you to play the same X turns three times and then choose the best thread to make it ""reality"". Another class literally possesses mobs and uses their own powers. Every class is very unique and plays very differently. The unique items that can drop are also very cleverly designed, giving you unique and fun powers and not just being a pumped-up version of a normal item with the name in a different color.

Other than that, the game is very hard, which can be frustrating for some, but there are many permadeath options for the less hardcore players out there. The lore is also very rich, even though lore is not really something I care about in these games.

The only downside I can think of are the graphics, which are just bad. No one expects AAA graphics from a roguelike, but ToME just looks kitsch.",1495539941,1496473742,True,30,0,0.657836854457855225,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Basically what that means is it's turn-based, levels are procedurally generated, it's fairly challenging, and there is permadeath. (The last can be tweaked a bit in different modes but there are no save slots in any mode.)

The graphics are obviously not the Witcher 3, but are good enough, in a nice semi-realistic ""classic fantasy"" style. (I personlly don't like cartoony graphics like say Torchlight.)

The music is surprisingly good, some of it is available here if you're curious- https://www.jamendo.com/artist/2740/celestial-aeon-project?language=en

The gameplay is very deep. There are dozens of different classes, including rather exotic ones like ""Oozemancer"" and one that dual wields shields. Some of these are initially locked (one of the few questionable design decisions IMO), but that can be changed with a mod. There are the usual stats like INT and STR, plus a lot of different resistances and abilities. One nice thing is that bosses are generally not immune to things like stun and slow. Some games (Final Fantasy for example) have trash mobs that are too easy to bother using debuffs on, but then the bosses are immune, so a lot of the spells are pointless. Here you find yourself using all of your abilities fairly frequently.

One of the areas it really shines is in eliminating anything that is tedious. For example, most RPGs have consumables, and you can cheese things by stocking up on them, which requires grinding. Instead of consumables you have ""infusions"" that are basically swappable skills with cooldowns. This means you have to time your cooldowns well, and be humble enough to run away sometimes, instead of just buying a stack of potions. Another is you can automatically explore a zone. This doesn't make the game easier exactly, since these type of things aren't challenging, just boring. It is really good at streamlining things without dumbing them down.

Given that it's procedurally generated, the story is I would say above average but not amazing, although the writing is quite good and there is a lot of lore. Instead it focuses on replayability and different game modes. There are about 1,300 achievements, however many of these are duplicates based on the three different permadeath modes (permadeath one life, permadeath multiple lives and no permadeath) and difficulty levels. I think there are 9 combinations so 1,300 / 9 = ~140 achievements roughly. Still a decent number. And with so many classes you can definitely have a lot of different playthroughs.

For the price I wasn't expecting much, but was very pleasantly surprised. This is not one of those trendy, shallow gimmicky indie games that you play for a few hours then get bored. It's deep, engaging and very well designed and thought out.",1493329510,1493343547,True,4,0,0.527936697006225586,0,True,False,False,False,,,

・拾える装備品も良品の出る頻度がいい具合に調整されていて、毎冒険で戦果が楽しみ
・各パラメータ・スキル・状態変化などは、全てに説明が書いてあり、それを読めば（大方は）効果が理解できる
・時々拾える、世界観を説明するようなショートストーリーが面白い

Tons of classes and races to choose from each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. No two classes feel the same.

In one playthrough you won't be able to see everything a class has to offer, so that gives you reason to even try out a class you already played as again but as a different race.

There's a basic campaign mode, an arena mode where you just fight enemies and an endless dungeon mode.

There's a grand diversity in the characters you can play, and their play styles are very different.  You have multiple campaigns, as well as the recently improved Infinite Dungeon.  

The skill selection is great.  Lots of skills to choose from, each with multiple levels.  Races usually have their own skill progression tree, as well.  There are passive skills, sustained skills (that opponents can turn off sometimes), and active skills.  Each of the active skills has a cooldown.  Some items will give you access to active skills as well, or reduce a cooldown on a skill, or make a whole skill tree a little more effective.  

Any active skill can be auto-triggered, if you like.  Most of the races have an instant skill to start off with that gives them some benefit, and you can just say ""Yeah, when someone closes in on me, fire off that skill"" and you don't have to worry about it anymore.  

Which brings us to auto-explore.  Like DCSS, ToME has a great auto-explore, so when you're not min-maxing your character or finding awesome artifacts, you're making meaningful decisions.  

In the end, those meaningful decisions almost always end in your demise.  As someone once said: ""Playing a roguelike is like being a kamikazi pilot: you start off knowing you're going to die.""  Rare is the explorer who does not meet some untimely end.  And that too is part of the charm of roguelikes: it's so very often quickly over, but every so often you luck out and live longer than you have any right to.  And you feel like such a bad-ass.  And then you die.  Again.",1491517992,1491560517,True,5,0,0.560635685920715332,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It also really likes cooldown-based abilities, so at times you'll feel like you're doing MMO combat.

I found the game too easy initially on Normal, starting the game as a Cornac Berserker regular enemies were no challenge at all, only bosses took some work to kill. The game also drops you in a forest which is quite boring to explore, and the graphics don't make very clear which tiles are traversable and which are not. I recommend using the auto-explore function ('Z' key, rebindable) in levels where you're mostly meeting trash mobs.

With time the game ups the challenge (and you can run into very dangerous areas if you're not careful, the game gives you a message which alludes to the difficulty when changing zones), and with level-ups you start discovering the deep RPG and item system. No complaints here, developing and equipping your character is very interesting, even though the game drowns you a in a sea of magic items with prefixes and suffixes, like Diablo and its ilk. (And unlike diablo, it has a lot of very small modifications to 10+ damage types. Yawning when you find yet another super-rare/legendary is never a good sign.) You unlock new characters and features through quests in the game, which I found cool.

Combat is quite compelling whenever there's a sense of danger. As in most roguelikes, not getting surrounded and paying attention to everything before making a move is key. Between equipment, infusions/runes and skills, you have a lot of abilities with cooldowns, so most turns will be spent picking the right one or positioning yourself to use one rather than simply running into an enemy to auto-attack. What I was most impressed with is when facing boss-type characters, they use pretty much the same ability system as you, and they sometimes have a lot of skills. While it makes identifying a dangerous enemy at a glance pretty hard, it does make for rather epic fights as they cast spells, heal and trigger cooldown abilities just like you. Trust me, the first time you meet an enemy with knockback and spells is really scary when playing a melee character.

The interface, however, is [b]REALLY AWFUL[/b] (despite ridiculous frontpage claims of ""modern graphical and customisable interface, intuitive mouse control""), especially the inventory. It's not really comfortable to use with the mouse: instead of displaying a tooltip for what you're hovering your cursor over, it insists on always having some object selected, obscuring your view with the information display. Movement with the mouse is also not very intuitive, as your character will move to where you point... until it finds something ""interesting"" or an enemy, and then you have to revert to moving a square at a time if you want any semblance of control.[b] It would actually seem like a good idea to learn the game solely with the keyboard at first, maybe even play another, keyboard only roguelike before this one. Only then will the mouse control layer make full sense.[/b] There's also a problem of information overload when looking at map tiles (and other stuff): do I really need to know that I need a ""special breathing method"" to traverse walls everytime I'm looking at one? The game cruelly needs to display only crucial information at a glance, and then offer to say, press shift to show detailed info like now in the tooltip (see Civilization IV and V and its most complex mods for good examples).

The game has a fixed overworld, story elements and quite a bit of lore, which set it apart from NetHack and Crawl which only offer a giant dungeon. I found this refreshing, but it comes with suggested level indications for dungeons and minimum levels to use some items, very jarring and immersion-breaking compared to the natural increase in difficulty as you go down in levels in other titles. It's gonna have a massive impact on replayability, too, the world map feels pretty small. There are towns and shops to return to and sell your loot: I think I slightly prefer the approach of Crawl where you can't sell stuff or transfer it to other characters, so you just dump stuff you don't need without hesitation. But if you like sorting through tons of loot Diablo or Borderlands-style, you'll be happy with this game.

There's no downside to resting ('R' key) in this game. In fact I recommend resting as soon as you finish beating a group of enemies, to recharge your health and stamina and bring all your abilities off cooldown. (Annoyingly, some charge bars like ""equilibrium"" which is need for some powers are ignore by the rest function, leading you to spam the skip turn button or use a mod if you want to get back into an optimal state.) Having to spam rest like this doesn't feel too great, it feels like the game had a hunger mechanic like other roguelikes to urge you on and prevent abusing rest, but dropped it along the way leaving Rest feeling orphaned.

There are a few other weird leftovers in the game, like a ""Scrying Orb"" which auto-identifies objects... and is completely pointless since objects always auto-identify in this game. Somehow the author hacked that in with a magical item at some point and left it as-is. Also, most annoyingly the game drowns you in loot but unlike, say, Crawl, anything you leave on the floor will disappear after a while. EXCEPT in ""vaults"", small enclosed areas with treasure guarded by monsters. Good luck identifying what was a vault when coming back to an area you've cleared, though, there are no indications except the room shape. This is an annoying non-feature you'll feel compelled to use, if only to stash stuff until you find the player home (which is also the in-game location of your te4.org, microtransaction-fueled online item Vault), or to make sets of element-resistant armor for various situations.

Overall I quite like the game, but it has a lot of room for improvements in the UI and graphics clarity department. Some of the gameplay choices made that set it apart from other roguelikes give a different, but not necessarily better experience. And as mentioned there are small but nasty oversights in the game design, which ends up feeling like a work in progress based on other roguelikes rather than its own thought-out entity. The community also seems to be blind to most of these flaws, and over-protective of any choice the author makes.

Try it out to experience the sheer amount of content a true roguelike can offer, but do expect a flawed gem. It might be the best game in the Angband family of roguelikes, having gotten rid of annoying stuff like non-persistent levels while still offering mechanics pretty unique to the family like multiplying creatures.

The world in which the game takes place is deep and immersive, with a rich history you'll rarely see in any game, roguelike or otherwise.  Character creation is incredibly complex... but in a good way.  Same with the implementation of the different classes' talents / skills.  The game somehow manages all this depth and complexity while still being approachable to the less hardcore roguelike fans.  The interface is fairly intuitive, and there's a solid tutorial to help players new to the genre to get a general idea how to play.

There are difficulty levels, which is already pretty unusual for a roguelike, but even better than that, three different game modes.  The masochists (myself included) can have permadeath while casual players can get into the game with Exploration mode, letting them die any number of times without any harsh penalties.  There's even an Adventure setting which gives players up to 7 lives (gained when reaching certain levels) allowing in-between players a chance to experience the intense thrill that only a permadeath-style game can offer, without over-punishing a small mistake.

The game is even more amazing in that it is 100% free.  You can download it for free.  You can even play with the source code if you are so inclined.  The game engine powering ToME is a separate package you can use to build your own games.  And yet it isn't supported by in-game ads (unless you count the very minimal starting-screen ads strictly for ToME DLC) or pay-to-win mechanics.  The entire game's revenue is based on players either buying DLC (which is absolutely not required to thoroughly enjoy the game) and donations (which is effectively what you're doing if you buy on steam).  Donators get access to some special content, and it's good stuff to be sure, but it's not required to have a ton of fun.

I feel like I need to buy this an extra time or two just to support the amazing product and the one (ones?) responsible for it.

I can't go into depth about game specifics; that would take me weeks to write.  Just trust me: it's an exceptional game with some really amazing features, and you can try it yourself for free if you aren't convinced.

+Rewarding combat, requires very strategic play
+Dozens of unlocks including races, classes, skill trees and cosmetic items
+Almost unlimited replayability
+Frequent updates/new content. The developer will randomly log on and grant everyone currently playing special abilities or easter eggs.

-Traditional roguelike graphics (could be worse, could be ascii characters)
-Glitchy at times
-Crazy steep learning curve
-The game is extremely complex. The top difficulties ""Insane"" and ""Madness"" require intimate knowledge of powerful builds and 95% of ToME players won't ever see the end of them.

The game is turn based roguelike about creating a character from a race/class combination, and slowly growing stronger by killing monsters and finding random items while trying to not die.
The world, the general theme of the dungeons and the main quests are always the same, but each dungeon floor is unique for the playthrough.
The game is not always fair, but at some level I really enjoy randomly ending up in bad situations, like what to do when you're all of a sudden being cut off from the stairs to the previous level, poisoned, low on hp, and surrounded by monsters; with practise and a bit of thought and soime luck a lot of bad situations are possible to come out of alive, and I find it hugely rewarding when I manage to pull off an unlikely escape to come back and clean up after recovering.

The game contains a large number of secrets that allow more character creation options when they are discovered, which I feel adds a lot of depth to the game; I'm still trying to find them all.

Leveling up allows some skill points to be allocated to any group of skills you know (Some groups may be added to the basic set of skilkls from your race / class combination), and stat points to be distributed among a fairly standardized set of stats. I feel that it is a bit unfortunate that the skills typically scale off a particular stat, for example berserkers have skills that scale off of strength and vitality, so investing in other stats is hard to justify.

The game is still under active development, and patches to address balance issues or add content or fix bugs are released regularly.
This can be a bit of a mixed blessing, as sometimes monsters that used to be easy yesterday all of a sudden can get you killed because they were buffed in a patch.

The game seems to have some minor annoying bugs that still haven't been fixexd, and a few major ones seem to bite people occationally. As of the latest patch the game seems to have trouble saving when playing online at times, but I am sure this will be fixed soon. As I understand it the entire game was created by a single developer, and given how many things there are that interact I think that he has done a very good job.

The graphics could be prettier, and the engine could probably be optimized a lot, but if you can stand dying a lot in the beginning while learning how everything works the game is really fun and rewarding with a high skill ceiling for players who enjoy exploring and creating powerful characters who survive against all odds, and if you haven't picked up this (slightly unpolished) gem already I strongly suggest you do.",1490467911,1490467911,True,2,0,0.506769835948944092,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+The game is one of the most enoyable actual ""Rogue likes"" I've played.
+Good range of class and race combinations allowing for a relatively deep customisation (uses still sprites but the sprites aren't lacking, they are both serious for the role player and humerous for the more light hearted run throughs)
+Good sense of humour from both the game and the developer. (Ie / only a few nights ago the dev set out a bunch of random events including but not limited to handing out gold to turning you into a bunny with 20% crit chance.)
+Lore is pretty damn Interesting
+Its literally pennies for how much gameplay you can actually get.
+Achievements! Achievements 1000+ Achievements for all you achievement junkies :P
+Classes are and usually split into two obvious builds, sometimes more for the more.. creative players, and require some planning thought, example being a Spell sword, who focuses on casting and uses melee as an alt or who uses sword play and only uses magic to bolster his sword swings / damage.
+Seems to be a lot of very varied items and gear all of which, especially items bearing prefixes and affixes can be incredibly useful and generally all can compliment some type fo character build

Cons - Theres actually very few cons other than the few below, BUT the game is Niche, this won't fulfil every RPG ""roguelike"" fan.
-Graphics are litlle basic (May or may not put people off, personally doesn't bother me as the game is far too good to sit and complain about how it looks too)
-Have experienced a few lock ups on tabbing out during load screens (probably a dumb thing to do but Youtube ads don't skip themselves...)
-Utterly Unreal amount of achievements may actually cause people to slog through the game not enjoying it.
-RNG can really screw you over.
-Game is incedibly difficult (for those who would rather face roll than think and believe they are the ultimate warrior/gamer)
-Enemies can be very, very unfair if you get unlucky, which can be disheartening in rogue like perma death difficulty as there can be situations where your character may as well just drop his weapon and bend over.

It's a proper turn-based, grid-based tactical game with perma-death (although you can play it without it if you're a puss :D). 

Set in the fantasy world of Eyal, a land which is filled with deep lore and interesting stories and characters. The number of races and classes available is huge and the varying combinations of these make the game immensely replayable.. And you'll want to replay it because it's incredibly addictive but also very difficult. (you will die. A lot) The difficulty (something which should be expected from any true roguelike) is not unfair however, and there is always a way in which you could have gotten out of the situation which killed you, you just might not know it untill a few playthroughs later. The more you play TOME, the more options for skills and gear and combinations of these you become aware of and this, in turn will increase your chances of surviving a little bit longer.

The game has a huge number of things to unlock by carrying out various actions in the game world, from new races and classes, birth options which affect every character you make thereafter and new skill trees for existing classes. Again, if you have ANY kind of interest in roguelikes (not for everyone for sure) then you owe it to yourself to pick up TOME and spend a few hours learning the basics. If you're anything like me then you will find it hugely satisfying and enjoyable.

The game is actually available for free on the website with an option to donate. Donators and people who buy the steam version will get a few extra bits and pieces plus an extra 'donator class', the possesor. 

Made by one man over a long time, TOME is a labour of love and the creator has no plans to stop anytime soon. The game has recently recieved a free update and more are planned, as well as new future DLC at some point down the line. 

If your not sure, pick up the free version on the site, I can almost guarentee you'll want to donate or buy it on steam after a few hours playing, it's that good you'll want to give something back and support future dev.

After I installed it and played the tutorial i was a little overwhelmed with the possibilities and startet an elven alchemist run. Because I had no clue of all the graphical cues and I didnt know that i was getting rekt untill it was too late I died on the very first floor.  After that I startet a human Archer and got out of the first area killing the boss and I was proud of my achievements.
Ater only a few runs I was hooked and couldn't stop playing the game for 30 hours in 5 days. I have never ever experienced something like it and had to take a break from the game since I was very frustrated for beeing bad :P

I encourage everyone that loves rouge-like RPGs to get this game, you can play for many many hours.

Pros:

[list]
[*]Great level and enemy variety and no run is the same
[*]Many different races and classes with many different skills for a nigh unlimited replayability
[*]You can unlock many classes, races and skills and there are many achivements to get (pretty much impossible to get all)
[*]Many different resources like mana, vim, psi...
[*]You can disable permadeath and choose either unlimited deaths or limited deaths instead
[*]loads of lore
[*]The ""only one more turn"" problem some games have. I lost lots of sleep because it suddenly was 4AM
[/list]

Cons:

[list]
[*]You can get fucked by RNG
[*]Some classes are really bad and others are god-worthy
[*]It will take you some time to get used to the UI and graphics, but once you got it its great.
[*]You will die. alot. sometimes very early on and othertimes to an incredibly powerful foe who randomly spawned there only to fuck you over even though you had your best run so far. I love that but might be a big nogo for some people.
[*]Sometimes it laggs a bit
[*]The ""only one more turn"" problem some games have. I lost lots of sleep because it suddenly was 4AM(this is both good and bad)
[/list]

There are probably many more things i didn't mention because i forgot. and I lost gametime on steam for some odd reason, i have like 20 hours more in the game than whats displayed.

TL:DR

[b]Great game for a great price with great replayability.[/b]

In all seriousness, this game lets you do some really crazy stuff - you can be anything from a standard sword and board knight to a Demonologist with the power to trap your foes into your own pocket hell. Perhaps you want to raise minions from the corpses of your foes, or perhaps you simply want to summon them from the depths of your own mind. If you have a ""dream class"" in RPGs, chances are ToME has it. If it doesn't, chances are a mod for ToME has it.

One of the best combat-focused RPGs ever. 

Actually it's more of a roguelike, but it has a story and some other more RPGish elements. Also some rudimentary but fitting graphics (not ASCII). I've yet to make it past level 35 (normally you'll end up 45-50 to finish, though I've never seen the ending) It's very challenging, but very fair and very intuitive too. It has a great tutorial that explains the fairly complex gameplay well, and has tooltips for practically everything, and just a great interface all around. Frankly it has one of the best interfaces I've seen in any game. It also has a built in chat in-game which is helpful so you can ask questions without having to go to the forums. Players ask questions and share item finds through a link system but the game also automatically posts a global message whenever someone dies or reaches one of the main quest goals. It's a nice touch that lets you feel like you're part of a community as you play alone (this is SP only). It's very active too - this game has really grown in popularity since its Steam release.

It's hard to explain why Tome4 is so fun, but it's a combination of really satisfying turn based combat, ""loot drop"", and an enormous variety of monsters to slay, weapons to find, and classes, skills and spells to choose from. Combine that with permadeath (though the ""standard"" mode gives you about 7 lives over 50 levels spread out, even with that though you're unlikely to make it out of even the beginning dungeons your first few outings) which I think makes any gaming experience much more edge-of-your seat and it's just one of the best games I've ever played. 

The class design is really one of the high points though. ""Solipsists"" that can invade an enemy's dreams and attack their mind directly (basically it throws you into a battle in said enemy's subconscious), chronomancers that can manipulate the flow of time (among other things you can split a time thread and then choose what result you want after playing each thread separately), shadow blades that can phase through walls and animate their own shadows to do their killing for them. A lot of very creative stuff. At time of this review there are 32 classes in the default, un-modded game. Yes, you read that right.

There's also a total absence of grinding and potion hoarding and the atmosphere is well done with lots of interesting, well written lore tidbits lying around that you can find. If you enjoy tactical turn based games or RPGs, or just something that's really difficult it's definitely worth at least checking out.

Worth mentioning too that the one man dev team is a fanatic who releases game updates constantly. The community as a whole is probably one the nicest and most helpful I've seen.

What it does have is fair, fun, and difficult hack and slash slash and ranged combat with dozens of different classes with tons of fun skills to unlock and enough difficulty levels that you can find one that *will* challenge you.  It has many many hours of content.  All the dungeons, item drops, and monsters are randomized so every game will be a bit different than the last.  Its gameplay aspect is so great that it doesn't need eye candy and filler to fool you into thinking you got good value for your money.  This game is the real deal.

If you like roguelikes and appreciate games with adequate difficulty and the threat of permanent death (optional), this is one you should not miss.

To be fair I only put in a little more than two hours and maybe I'm just not the target demographic for this game but really though, this didn't feel like a video game at all to me. I never actually felt like I was doing anything that was happening in this game. I was just seeing tiles move around and text appear on screen.

The tradeoff with a a game like this is supposed to be the depth of customization, interactivity, and story, etc. But none of that stuff really stood out to me when I was making my character and playing the opening quests.

If your goal is to play a super simplistic RPG where there's a depth of customization and interactivity then my advice would be not to play a game like this. But instead join a tabletop RPG group. That is the deepest level of customization and interactivity you can get to and it also involves hanging out with real people and drinking beer, so that makes it even better than this game.",1488648623,1488648623,False,13,5,0.244196057319641113,6,True,False,False,False,,,

For its simple sprites and tiles, this game has a crazy amount of depth in combat and character building, and each playthrough always has its own flavor. Sometimes those flavors can be quite bitter, as the world of Maj'Eyal can be a deadly place to the impatient or the overconfident. A few pros and cons:

Pros:
- ToMe is difficult, but as you learn the game you'll do better every time
- Every playthrough is unique! Different zones, uniques or orange loot, events and side quests with every character!
- Great character customization! 10 races, >20 classes, each with several talent paths to choose. Even more with DLC
- Full of lore! Every zone, item, and boss has a story behind it.
- Loads of information is available to you. Can look up enemies skills, saves, resistances, etc. Nothing is hidden!
- Great mod support! Make your own race or class, with blackjack! And hookers!

Cons:
-Some classes are little weaker compared to others, especially the starting classes.
-Game engine kinda bogs down when zones get really crowded , or while saving
-Rare mobs basically roll different class skillsets, so some rares can be quite insane with certain unlucky combinations
-A playthrough can be as long as a full DnD campaign.
-RNG is a cruel mistress sometimes

One of the best games of it's kind. Atmospheric music, complex combat system but you don't actually need to look up too much (or any) of it to do well at the game. Good interface which is fully customisable. The lore is deep and interesting. There are many characters/classes for almost every playstyle ever existed. The map is set but the dungeons are randomly generated with random unique loot (the item itself isn't randomised) providing almost infinite replayability.

Although many people dislike hardcore rogue-like games, Tales of Maj'Eyal will satisfy even the most casual player. Here are some pros and cons of the game:

Pros:
1- One can disable or tweek perma-death option. Ideal for casual players.
2- There are endless possibilities for character creation. A big variety of races and a even bigger variety of classes.
3- You can unlock new races and classes as you play the game and complete certain tasks a certain way, opening up the possibility to run more than one playthrough (considering you play casually *coughs*).
4- Really well done skills and skill tree learning system.
5- Trasmogrification Chests are the BEST THING EVER. It's basically a chest the player carries that allows him to pick up all and any item in a level, disconsidering his/hers emcumbrance. After you complete a level, you can choose which items you want to stay with and easily sell the rest instantly.
6- There are lots of ways to reach the end of the main storyline, and I gotta say, what a storyline.....
7- Players can dig through most walls if they have a pickaxe.... that's awesome and adds to what makes this game so different.
8- The world treats you differently depending on your race, class, past deeds and more.
9- Ability to re-spec most talents and skills.
10- I'll add a pro to the amount of different magical channeling power the game has. a.k.a. Mana, Stamina, Vim, Psi, Equilibrium, and more. It adds variety and explicitly shows the player that no magic type is the same.
11- The player can learn some skills they would never possibly have by equipping certain items.
12- The ability to stroll through easy levels.
13- Inscriptions and runes are freaking nice. I have never seen a rogue-like game doing that sort of system before.
14- The dungeon balancing system is gold.

Cons:
1- I know it's a rogue-like game, but it's not meant to be completed without dying at least once, no matter how strong you are. You will either have a stupid death, or a big monster will exploit your weakness and insta-kill you (props to High Peak) (more info below the cons)
2- Certain classes are heavily unbalanced compared to others. Example: Play as a Doombringer, and then switch to an Alchemist. You'll feel the difference.
3- Dungeon balancing system not working for High Peak. If there was ONE PLACE in which this system SHOULD have worked.... it just didn't budge.

Sit down guys, it's story time.

First character I made, was an elf archer. Nothing special. He died after I got ambushed by a hand saw guy. GOLD.

The second character I made (with permadeath off *coughs*) was the most ignorant guy I could've ever created. A Higher Doombringer. I would simply run through hordes of enemies without a problem, no biggy. That's the character I used to learn about the game, the story and to explore Maj'Eyal and the Far East.
The best/worst experience I can tell you guys, was basically as I entered High Peak (last level of the game). I quickly noticed mobs 17 levels above mine. ""Wtf is that supposed to mean?"". Luckily my character was just an ignorant prick, so I started ""playing"" the game. As I cleared areas and moved to other areas of High Peak, I noticed the level difference between me and the mobs was getting bigger and bigger. ""Now that's a problem"". Plus, all the mobs there seem to confuse you, blind you, time warp you, pin you down, slow you down, silence you, and... the worse in my case... disarm you, every... freaking... turn. ""Wtf am I supposed to do?? I can't even calculate how many turns I'll have until I can cast certain skill, because I'm slow and being time warped"". I felt like playing the game inside a vortex while high on heroine, because.. oh man... all of the status effects actually play a visual role on your screen (which is a pro). I wish I could tell you about my final boss experience, but that's way too much for now. 

Even though it was serious BS, I give my High Peak experience a 10/10. That's simply a rogue-like game for ya.

玩了30多个小时，感觉已经入坑。一开始建议先死十几次，熟悉一下游戏。然后上贴吧，看一个普人狂战士的教学贴。这样下来，就差不多成为一个正常的菜鸟了。

其实论资排辈下来也非常的有资历。

Roguelike以战斗导向和战斗BUILD构筑为核心的一脉叫Moria系，Moria后来变成了Angband，Angband引入了泽拉兹尼的小说元素变成了ZAngband（前面那俩看名字也能看出来，就是魔戒），ZAngband在引擎升级之后变成了Troubles of Middle Earth，ToME3，再后来，去掉了这些奇幻小说爱好者元素之后，它变成了Tales of Maj'Eyal，ToME4。

而Moria这个Roguelike作为一个从最顶上的一个村庄进行补给，然后一层一层向下杀的地牢探险游戏，它直接影响了——没错——暗黑破坏神1。

所以这游戏事实上保留了暗黑体验中最精华的那部分——猛杀、猛捡装备、搞BUILD、然后面对更极限的战斗强度验证BUILD、重复这个过程，而且因为它是roguelike，同步回合制下玩起来比暗黑还要凌厉和痛快。",1487007569,1654272762,True,17,1,0.689538121223449707,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes, yes I do. 

When in search for something new to play, I came across this game while it was on sale for a measley 2.00. That also included all the DLCS. I had never played this type of game before, and if you look at my games library you would know this to be true.  I almost passed this game by but the 1620 achievements caught my eye. 1620 achievements for a 2.00 game? Admittedly, it was the achievements that made me purchase the game, what the heck, 2.00, if i dont like this game, no harm done, right? I love collecting achievements, although I am not good at it! So, there I was creating my character, giving them a name and choosing a player tile. I entered the world of Maj'eyal a lvl 1 archer. I died as a lvl 1 archer. Game Over. My character had disappeared. There was no, try again. No respawn. Nope. Game Over. My first lesson on what Roguelike means. ;) 

There is different lvls of difficulty though, you do not have to play it as roguelike until you get to know the game really well. Exploration mode allows you to play with infiinite lifes, Adventure with limited lifes. 

I am probably the worst player at this game, I am still learning the game 30 hours in, and admittedly the highest lvl I have made it to is lvl 16 on normal mode. I have lost track of how many times i have died and had to start over - but that is the testimony to the game. I keep coming back to try again.........and again.......and again. This game is fun and really a challenge. Its cheap even when not on sale and worth the money.

Tome应该算是angband一系的作品，专注点在于战斗，而且tome没有饥饿值的设定，使得游玩可以更注重于战斗的技巧和策略，在战斗方面玩法十分丰富。不会被饥饿值打乱节奏而专注于战斗，这是我最满意的地方。如果真的喜欢传统回合制rl的玩家千万不能错过。

画面：经过1，2，3代，4代的画面依然是这么的“渣”，但是如果真正是传统rl玩家应该完全不会在意这些。毕竟对我来说只要不是ASCII字符画面我就心满意足了。

音乐：配乐很亮眼，作为传统rl游戏，玩家的游玩时间肯定是会非常长的，甚至长达数百小时，这个时候在bgm方面就必须做到十分耐听。而我认为tome4恰恰做到了这一点，不同场景的bgm恰到好处，使人完全不会感到厌烦，另外竞技场的bgm我个人认为是最棒的，大家可以去听听看。

游戏性：不必说，也根本无法说。作为传统rl游戏最不用担心的就是游戏性了。随机的道具属性、地图、怪物、事件，让你沉迷于未知无法自拔。有限的生命使你高度警惕。总而言之这款游戏肯定会让你嗨到不行！

That genre is notoriously difficult to approach due to its depth, random elements, and permadeath. However, ToME is much more approachable than its brethren. 

In terms of Permadeath, there are three options that you, the player, may select when creating your character: Exploration (you have infinite lives, and you can still unlock races/classes/other) , Adventure (you have finite/limited lives. By progressing, you earn more lives.), and Roguelike (you are the character, death is final... though, there are means of cheating death that you may discover).   

In terms of random elements,  you will rarely straight up lose/win because of your luck (though it definitely seems that way at the start). Within ToME, randomness can affect your loot, the difficulty of champion monsters (enhanced versions of a regular monster), enemy placement within a dungeon, and types of obstacles (i.e. dungeon variations, random events, etc.). Despite all of that, ToME gives you a few powerful tools to compensate.  
[olist]
    [*] The ability to inspect ANY unit that you can see, as a free action. This allows you to see what abilities an enemy has, their stats, defenses, and much more. This means that if some enemy is new to you, or a champion variant is using some strange new ability, you can inspect it and adapt accordingly.
    [*] Dungeon Consistency. Certain dungeons in the game will always be present in any playthrough. They will always fall within the same power level, and (almost) always have the same type of enemies. So, if you know you are approaching a certain area that is hypothetically filled with insane amounts of electric damage, you will be able to plan accordingly. The other aspect of this is that certain character excel in different dungeons, and are terrible in others. As you become more familiar with the game, you learn to play around your characters strengths/weaknesses, which leads me to the next point...
    [*] The ability to RUN and ESCAPE. Some encounters are straight up unfair/impossible. Perhaps you got surrounded by a bunch of weak enemies and are being stunned repeatedly. Or, you are stuck in a corner with a big, spooky minotaur. Unless you are tanky as all hell, and can heal for days, it is actually perfectly acceptable to just run/teleport to safety.
[/olist]


In terms of depth, or wealth of mechanics, ToME is easily one of the best (if not the best). While other roguelikes may give you a bunch of ways to interact with a single item or the environment. ToME's depth comes from: 

[list]
    [*] Vast amount of start options (race/class). It is impossible to emphasize how DIFFERENTLY some of the classes play from one another. You do not just unlock new classes and races, but new racial groups and types of classes outside of just the  typical warrior, rogue, wizard archetypes.
    [*] Unique Items (items can have class abilities attached to them, or even unique abilities).
    [*] The lore (if you care about that sorta thing).
    [*] Environments/dungeons. Past a certain point in the game, you feel like you are starting a whole different game (for the main campaign). It definitely caught me off-guard.
    [*] Boss encounters. With minimal spoilers, you definitely want to inspect some of these guys/gals/things.
[/list]

Has a decent presentation, albeit not not the greatest in comparison to its other modern peer titles, but better than alot of the ""hardcore"" types of its kind. 

Great amount of options on how you wish to play it. Play it classic with one life, or explore its story faster with a couple of extra lives. It still offers a bounty of ways to die very quickly to expend those extra lives if you are unprepared. 

As is a standard with these games, if you are persistant, power is plentiful, along with the amount of extraordinary circumstances you will find yourself in. Very rewarding even if one is under time constraints.

I'm not particularly a fan of the Rogue-like genre, because I don't like the idea of progression loss. YET, I only like to play this game in the Adventure mode - the standard mode that the game was made to be played with limited lives (I eventually gonna try Rogue-like mode, with just 1 life). If you don't like this, you can play in exploration mode, that gives you infinite lives.
Tales of Maj'Eyal has a very immersive gameplay, regardless of its simple graphics. The story is pretty good and interesting, but what shines is the well composed challenging elements. It's different from riddles or gimmicks that other games put you through. The situations that ToME put you are complex, composed by various elements, that you need to judge and measure to take decisions. THIS. You FEEL the situation, you feel the DANGER. And you must to analyse and find a solution that can be simple or complex, still there is not only one solution, it is circumstantial. Sometimes you can't see solutions to a challenge but you progressively learn how to deal with it. One of the best feeling that the game gives you is the discovery of a solution to a apparently impossible situation.
Yes, the challenges are complex. But, the game gives you various options. Whereas you learn the dangers that you can face, you learn how to counter it. And, for this, you have a vast character building system, with numerous races and classes that you can combo and choose between vastly different playstyles. Each class and race have different ways to deal with situations, some classes and races are best to deal with some types of dangers, some have flaws that you must find a way to cover. And to deal with that, you have Trinkets, items and equipments - that gives you habilities to use -, you can loot or buy them in shop - you must choose wisely what you want to keep with you.
The exploration element of this game is good, there's tons of secrets to discovery and unlockables enable, like races, classes, and skill trees options to make your characters. The game has around 1500 achievments to unlock, if you are a achievment hunter.
The storyline is very good and interesting too, but beyond the main storyline, you have a deep and complex universe, which you unfold gradually in various logs and pieces of story that you must find in dialogue options, logs, places, doing secret quests and getting achievments.
The one-guy dev team is active and keeping the game alive, with online support, events, random blesses of the DarkGod, updates and expasions. The game is still alive. Even though you can play the game for free, it's definitely a game worth supporting. You can donate directly or buy the Steam version, those gives you donator privillege.

It uses a deep system of combat and customization that starts simple but starts digging quickly. The story is engaging and often humorous, but appears almost entirely in the background through gameplay elements rather than tedious cutscenes and copy-pasta tv tropes. 

Everything about the game deserves praise: the combat, the customization, the freedom to make ambiguous moral choices, the art***, the replayability.

Despite the omfg-is-that-dog-poop art, every other element of this game is so amazingly well done that this game has *earned* its glowing reviews and I felt obligated to add my voice to the choir of praise.


***the part about the art deserving praise was a complete and utter lie. Not a fib, not an exaggeration, but a lie. The art for this game is the worst video game art I have seen, ever. It's truly unacceptable and there is *no* excuse for the author's failure to get a few fans to replace it with... anything really.

F*ck*ng seriously, start upgrading the art already, you've got plenty of fans who would do it for free.

Brings to mind a quote from a recent movie, something about living and dying and such...but this is fantasy, not post-apocalypse. 

Looking at others' playtimes, I see I've barely scratched the surface with a measly 36 hours so far, but already it's managed to enthrall me and challenge me. Still only playing on the starting difficulty, but roguelike mode (so one life only, instead of several) and I have yet to get a character even to level 20. I can't even imagine how thoroughly the higher difficulties will rip me to pieces, but I'm looking forward to it. 

Even if you don't know if you'll like the game that much, or have never played a roguelike (this one is fairly close to the ""true"" formula, but without the (to me) annoying need to eat or starve to death), it's a very cheap buy.

I started playing the second generation of this franchise nearly a decade ago and even then I'd rate it a solid compettitor to current AAA RPG Titles.

优点：
传统Roguelike中上手难度最低的作品之一，操作直观，UI亲民，不像很多同类作品一样上来就甩你一脸快捷键；
多彩的职业和更多彩的角色build，极有深度，真正做到每次玩都有不同体验；
大量独特的技能，种类丰富实力强大的敌人，抛弃很多传统Roguelike要素（比如药水和满腹度）而完全集中于单场战斗战个痛的独特系统，即使只是用一个build通关一遍也很有嚼头；
虽然剧情简单直白，但游戏中有着大量的书信、传说、神器，创造出的故事世界绝不空洞单调；
可调难度，可调永久死亡，有汉化mod，门槛低不高冷；
BGM很好听。

如果你不追求华丽画面、不在乎难度挑战，有着在同一个精英怪手上死了又死也不会气馁的精神和被boss突然秒杀也不会砸电脑的脾气，那就来试试这部游戏吧。只要对了胃口，这部游戏能让你感受到“再来一回合”“再下一层”甚至“再通一遍”的魅力。",1480424535,1480424535,True,5,0,0.571388125419616699,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Loads of start options (classes, races, that sort) to unlock, with a decent assortment of default-unlocked characters ranging through easy-hard and beginner-complex spectrums. Graphics, sound, music all functional enough to work nicely, backed by gameplay that would've still dwarfed them anyhow if it would've had a big studio throwing insane money at artists to pretty it up. Completely turn-based, so you can jump up to answer the phone or door or grab a snack or whatever else (like just trying to think your way out of a rough patch when it looks like next move could be the last) without needing to find a pause, but you'll likely find yourself already up later than intended claiming to yourself that you'll go to bed after just one more level. Replayability already high when played on regular difficulty and some extra lives allowed, then you can always turn up difficulty while playing one-life mode and playing a class you're less comfortable with to make it more interesting, while also hunting down large amounts of achievements, some of which are challenging all on their own, others are challenging except in the rare case that the RNG components smile on you. Or start a character with difficulty turned down and/or lives set to infinite just to get a better idea of what will and won't work out later before doing it on a ""real"" savefile. And then you could always get into using or making mods if you're into that. Have spotty internet sometimes? As long as you had it already downloaded, completely works in offline mode (with minor limitations of not getting special event dungeons unlocked if the dev sprinkles it to everybody, and offline mode has a separate shared stash from online mode).

Still not sure? Poke around their website, there should still be a free version available (had some minor limitations when I did so years ago, looks like less limits now?).

Fans of the genre need this in their inventory. It's very cheap and the expansion content isn't as necessary as other games so just grab the base game if price is a factor. This game could easily be priced at 3-4 times the amount that it's priced at and it would still be worth it based on the quality and the extreme amount of content that it has.

Pros:
1. The combat is insanely deep. While it is difficult for the inexperienced player even on normal level difficulty, it is always very fair. 
2. The amount of classes (and race combinations) in the game is ludicrous. They aren't like DCSS in which classes just dictate starting levels and items. Each class has skill trees to choose abilities from that have a huge impact on the way the character is played. 
3. There are several unique and rewarding mechanics, but I won't spoil them.
4. Unlockables: Starting out with only a few options and then unlocking different races and classes feels very rewarding.  
5. You find lore on the ground and can read it to get the storyline of each dungeon and the Maj'Eyal itself. I don't read it personally but the ones I have read are well written and thought out.
6. It has an actual soundtrack, attack, spell, and ability sounds that are all high quality.
7. Mods: Classes, improved resting, exploring, etc. 

Cons:
1. Some people consider the game easy. That being said, the game comes with multiple difficulties that increase to an almost unbeatable level. Playing on the hardest is nothing like playing on normal.
2. Lives: not so much a con, but you can choose to play the game on or off roguelike. You can't unlock achievements or unlockables with unlimited lives, and you can't unlock roguelike level achievements with limited lives. 
3. I want to put bugs in here but I can't because I haven't run into any that weren't caused by mods. As it's an older game many of the mod creators haven't kept up with their mods.",1480345479,1480345479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Granted, many of them are going to be short - this IS a roguelike, after all - but the game has enough to offer for both experienced veterans of the genre and explorers who are just in for the sights. ToME features a huge main campaign with a pre-determined world map and randomly placed quest dungeons, several dozens of class/race combos with unique skill trees and expansive battle mechanics to liven up the experience.

Unlike many other modern roguelikes, ToME's one and only focus is combat. Even though there's an overworld and a bunch of peaceful cities, don't look at them as more than just trade hubs. What you're gonna do 99% of the time is look for a way out of yet another impossible situation that you recklessly rushed into, be it an unexpected boss or a group of trash mobs that you foolishly underestimated. Luckily, the player is always equipped with numerous tools to deal with trouble or escape to safety - there are runes, infusions, magic artifacts, proccing gear, abilities, status effects designed to keep you alive and your enemies either dead or, at least, a safe distance away. Learning how to use all of these is a different beast entirely, and you'll quickly find that even the normal difficulty playthrough might take you more than a hundred hours to master (even though the total time spent for an actual normal playthrough run without deaths might not exceed 10 hours in total). Once you've done it, higher difficulties unlock, and there's a good chance you also discovered some new classes/races to play along the way, so that your next game is completely different from the previous attempt.

1.5k achievements (currently the record-holder on Steam), insane replayability, a quest progression to keep you motivated, and brutally difficult yet fair fights in the classic turn-based Rogue fashion - there really isn't much else to say. ToME deserves all the praise it gets, and the regular updates only make it that much better.",1480168464,1480168634,True,16,1,0.67139279842376709,2,True,False,False,False,,,

It's still in active development too, and has been for a long time. You can see character and player stats on the te4.org webpage too.

缺点：更新不快，对于老手而言，部分场景的进程略枯燥或繁琐，当然，在成为老手之前，并不太会意识到这个问题吧大概，所以还是有相当长的时间不会厌倦的。当然，只要过段时间平息了这份不快的感觉，回过头来还是能玩上一阵子，若是有了新的内容更不必说。

I wasn't expecting much because of the low price point and odd graphics, but I've spent hundreds of hours in the game since I bought it (and all of that was before I installed my Steam copy).

Every character class has widely varied and interesting abilities, which makes them feel unique and fun. Warriors and rogues don't have quite as much to do as mages, but they aren't just ""easy mode"" like with some games, and the way their abilities behave makes the tactical battles as dramatic and fascinating as if they had magical powers.

Practically every enemy has interesting abilities of its own, and even small ones can be dangerous if you aren't careful. The AI is simple, but effective. You can't just kite your way through fights. Small mistakes can escalate danger quickly, and death is rough (if you're playing on Adventure or Roguelike difficulties, at least), but when I die, it's usually my fault, and I can do better next time.

Loot is plentiful, but easily managed, since you have an inventory item that stores new pick-ups, and sells off junk at the end of each area (at no loss, even). It takes a little while to figure out what items are good for your character, but once you know, inventory management is a breeze.

The story is mainly told through notes you pick up, and the lore is pretty deep and interesting. I'm there for the combat, though, so I'm glad subsequent playthroughs aren't bogged down by having to wait through dialogue and story scenes.

The game is very thoughtfully crafted, and I greatly appreciate the effort that was clearly put into it. I can see myself playing this game for thousands of hours and still enjoying the heck out of it.",1480081921,1480081921,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Even then players that are bad/new at roguelikes can just change the difficulty level/the amount of lives they get to enjoy the game without fear of losing progress. For those who are new to the game, there is a helpful community along with in game chat rooms that can assist you. For people that are looking for something different, there is an extensive modding community for quality of life mods, class additions etc; and some of these even get integrated into the main game.

With or without the difficulty, you will still get the gripping gameplay of a roguelike (although it is of course better if you have a chance of dying). Additionally, there are many unique classes in the game so that you can find a playstyle that suits you.

The gameplay is varied depending on your class and even race. Each class have their own skills and passive abilities, and most classes can be played in several different ways depending on skill build.

Generally, the core gameplay loop is exploring until you find enemies, asserting the situation and deciding which offensive/defense skills you want to use while making sure to keep an escape route ready. Combat is turn-based and somewhat similar to MMORPGs (lots of skills which use a resource such as mana and most skills have a cooldown).


The UI is intuitive and accessible while remaining quite powerful, which means that unlike most roguelikes you won't have to learn strange key-combinations to perform simple tasks.

Inventory management is relatively straight-forward, and instead of consumables players have access to cooldown-based items. No more stacking up on different potions and scrolls.

If you told me that this game was in Beta, I would have belived it. It's not the old-school graphics, it's the clunky User Interface. Menus cover up each other and several buttons don't work when you click them. The font is often too small to read, and some of the menus I still haven't figured out what their purpose is. Sometimes it feels like you are fighting the UI, more than the monsters of Maj'Eyal. 

 I have yet to play a roguelike that I thought was fair, This one didn't really come close. I like the deep customization and unlockable classes and races. Where the game fails centers around it's claim of ""no grinding  required"". This is the game's downfall as you clear out an area and the monsters don't respawn. You move on to the next area only to find the monsters are too hard and kill you instantly. You are stuck and can't continue with the character becuase there are no ways to get stronger without a likely death. You have to start the game over or throw your body at monsters that are a lot stronger than your character. This is hardest on the classes that I think are really fun to play like rogues and mages. You are just not powerful enough to make it through the early areas and you can't grind to level up. The game doesn't compensate to allow classes that start off weak to be able to make it through the beginning of the game. If this was fixed, I would reccomend this game even with the clunky UI.

Spoiler warning, I'm gonna discuss the lore. If you still don't know what most of this review will be about, I have some bad news for you.

So TOME has a pretty lengthy backstory, somewhere around three to five pages per area and dozens of areas. It's a decent fiction novel when taken as a whole, well written at the very least. What makes me question it is the modern cultural and technological lens through which most of the factions are viewed. Virtually all races are modelled after some modern day oppressive government or terrorist organization. They're all busy to some degree with opressing or exterminating the other races, even outright destroying the world. And there's lots of stuff about aliens, weapons of mass destruction, virus outbreaks, mindcontrol gadgets.
On paper it's actually kind of awesome, yet the spectre of this interesting idea never quite materializes. Being a writer myself, I'm trying to find the right lesson to learn, the right advice to take away from all this.

About halfway through the game you'll meet the orcs, a sort of Al Qaida style hyperviolent desert people. They're about to start another war and conquor the world, and you foil their plans and kill them right back into obscurity. Then it turns out they were part of some other scheme and it all comes down to... something?
In the expansion, the remaining orcs are spared and thrown into a ghetto. You play as an orc, break out of the ghetto, overthrow your oppressors and then confirm everyone's prejudice by being exactly as violent as everyone thinks you are. Huh. That almost went somewhere.
My conclusion is that it's an issue of theme and philosophy. Combining medieval fantasy and modernity is bound to have some interesting results, but it's also bound to clash. There's no obligation to pick sides or distill a moral truth, that's the job of a political essayist, not a writer. But you have to tie it together somehow. 
In this regard I feel the everyman cypher protagonist is something of a missed oppertunity. Put someone unique there, an actual hero (or villain). It's incredibly stale to have the main character be unique among their species, the one hero who is different, but that's why writing isn't easy.

Anyway the game is good, it's a roguelite, there's hordes of enemies, there's limited respawns, I'm sure some other review can explain it better.

TOME is the best turnbased, rogue-rpg you gonna find till today. This game shows perfectly how not the size of a dev-team, but dedication and love for the own product makes quality. Thankfully over the years TOME also offers top(!) content and you can spend hundrets of hours in this world easily. 

TOME offers a massive character progression: leveling up (each level) offers so much possibilities for each class to grow the way you like -> with active, passive and sustained abilites synergizing with each other and complementing gear and attribute growth.

After your first step a hughe open world awaits you, quests over quests, dungeons, woods, ruins, towns filled with shops and npcs...the only thing deciding what to do when is your own risk-awerness,; death is meaningfull, but never unwarrented and just the beginning of a new try to get even further.

TOME lacks technicaly on first glance: yes animations are few, the 2D-design is rather minimalistic, but once you play a while you will see that it works, it ""fits"" all together. armor/weapons shows on your character ´, skills have visual-representation and the world/npcs look in place.

The music in TOME is just amazing, beeing traveling the vast overworld map, diggin through an eerie dungeon or wandering to old woods; each track is rich in athmosphere and tone and i could listen to most of em even when not actualy playing the game. 10/10 here, easily one of the best soundtracks i`ve ever heard in one of these games.

- Story: lore abounds throughout the world
- Breadth and depth of world: dozens of dungeons, some quite deep, on multiple continents, as well as towns, roaming NPCs, and plenty of areas that are unlocked by quests
- Variety of monsters: there are rats and orcs, but so much more, as well - necromancers, fantastic magical creatures, hordes of wyrms... the list goes on
- Variety of gear: multiple tiers with many levels of quality, tons of interesting egos, artifacts, and unusual things like lanterns and charms
- Variety of maps and dungeons: every place feels different and has a different theme and story
- Variety of graphical sprites: some dungeons look alike, but most places have a distinct look - also, plenty of weapon, armor, and character sprites to keep things interesting
- High ratio of progression to tedium
- Exploration mode gives you infinite lives, for those who like an easy game once in a while
- 1,600+ achievements
- Many UI and graphics configuration and customization options
- Extremely good price for the amount of depth and replayability (less than one US cent per achievement, too)

Not-so-great things:

- Can feel very unbalanced at times (compared to other modern roguelikes): it's common to step into an enemy's line-of-sight and die instantly from a sudden powerful attack, even on normal difficulty
- Default tiles are a bit painful on the eyes: I prefer the OldRPG tiles from the Steam Workship, which give the game a somewhat more Legend of Zelda-like look

Орки говрят только на английском, эльфы говорят только на английском, все говорят только на английском! И что же делать? 

Правильно - стать злым гномом-берсеркером с воот такенной булавой, вступить в антимагический орден и отправиться насаждать добро всем и каждому не вдаваясь зачем и почему (вы же не забыли что всё на английском?:))

Отличнейший рогалик с тонной вещей, мешком квестов, океаном лора, и бездной смертей. (Для самых нервных есть сложность - неумирашка, для самых умных как всегда есть копирование сейвов).

Плюсы:
- Тонны вещей - прям вот огромное и разнообразное колличество лута, ничуть не слабее чем в диабло.
- Куча классов, и подклассов - у всех свои скиллы и т.д.
- Разнообразие билдов, что позволяет играть и играть, переодически возвращаясь в эту прекрасную игру, и каждый раз открывать для себя что-то новое.
- Опен ворлд :D
- Юзер френдли - сложность игры вы выбираете сами - от ""я бессмертный чародей с дубиной"" до ""Осторожно - если на вас чихнут, вы умрете""

Минусы:
- Мало инфы в инете на русском, для этой игры это очень очень усложняет постижение основ
- Нет поддержки 4К и HDR.... в 2016ом то году?!


И так, мысли после 160 часов игры....

Это ужасная игра... как бы я не хотел, я не могу перестать играть, она тупо не надоедает!

Это жестокая игра (привет Dark souls) - при первом прохождении на любой сложности тебя карают и карают, даже когда начинаешь по обвесу походить на терминатора... Всегда найдется какой-нибудь рарник или уник который за 2-3 удара объяснит что самоуверенность это плохо.

Это слишком объемная игра! - 48 вариантов персонажей, и за каждого геймплей разный (такое бы в диаблу), новые виды классов открываются при выполнении определенных ивентов\квестов\апчивков, хотя можно не напрягаться и разблокировать всех аддоном из мастерской (крайне не советую, многие доп. классы интересны (живут) только после  того, как осознаешь что и как тебя может убить и вероятнее всего даже убьет:D).

Это игра в которой слишком много лора - записи с лором почти на каждой полянке, локации и т.д, при желании и знании английского, только на прочтение лора уйдет часов 10.

Это игра в которой переплетаются ЧСВ игроков и сверх адекватное комьюнити - иноязычный офф. форум игры полноценен и имеет ответ на любой ваш вопрос, при желании можно задать новый, и вам ответят, как правило четко, лаконично и без ""опускания"" до уровня пещерных людей.

Это..это... это лучший roguelike который я видел в своей жизни (nethack, adom и т.д. конечно тоже хороши, но вот TOME прям идеален для меня), а с учетом его цены\времени которое я в него наиграю, выходит что приобритен он был почти бесплатно. Советую всем любителям roguelike.

P.S.
На офф. сайте игры есть полная бесплатная версия (ограничения - нет сложности с бесконечными жизнями, и dlc, но это никак не помешает, т.к. сейвскмминг тут более чем дружелюбный, а по началу без него адско пригорит).",1473787711,1475781123,True,8,2,0.62471085786819458,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ToME est un Rogue-like (un vrai, un pur sang), considéré comme le représentant actuel du genre.

La particularité de ce jeu, contrairement aux autres Rogue-like, est de ne pas chercher à plaire qu'au fan, ce qui le place en première ligne pour les fan rogue-like avec son contenu ahurissant, mais aussi en première ligne pour les initiés du genre qui cherchent à se rapprocher du gameplay de la ""source"" (Rogue).

Le jeu n'est pas beau, comme tout les rogue-like avec une interface graphique, puisque les graphisme sont considérés par les fans comme n'étant pas fidèle aux genre. 

En contrepartie, ce qui est toléré, c'est de remplacer les célèbre caractères ASCII de Rogue par des images (ça facilite un peu l'immersion). Il ne faut donc pas chercher des graphismes dans ToME, mais seulement du gameplay, du contenu, de la stratégie, du gameplay, encore plus de contenus, et encore de la stratégie.

Le jeu s'inspire principalement des RPG à l'ancienne (notamment les JRPG), possédant une World Map, et gérant les donjons à la façon de Rogue. Plusieurs modes de jeux peuvent être débloqués, notamment un mode Survie (Arène) et un mode Donjon infinie).

La caractèristique principale de ToME est de pouvoir s'adapter à tout type de joueur, permettant le respect des traditions, mais aussi de le rendre plus accessibles aux initiés. La possibilité, par exemple, de désactiver la mort permanente (bien que ce soit blasphématoire) permettront aux nouveaux joueurs de pouvoir s'adapter, de pouvoir découvrir le jeu, et de s'interesser au genre Rogue-like.

Le jeu possède un nombre immense de possibilité, que ce soit dans le choix des races, des classes, du choix des donjons, et en plus de générer procéduralement les donjons.

Chaque experience de jeu peut être similaire, voir totalement différente, chaque choix fait pourra rapprocher le joueur de l'extase, chaque style de jeu peut trouver sa place dans ToME.

Pour resumer, ToME est le rogue-like ultime, accessible par tous (fan ou non) et possède de surcroit un mode ""Rpg"" avec un scénario très appréciable.",1473260753,1473260753,True,4,0,0.586466193199157715,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Assuming you're familiar with roguelikes, ToME's main draw is its combat. Whereas games like Angband, Nethack and the like have a lot of focus on navigating the dungeons and managing your items, ToME sets itself apart from other RLs through its tactical approach to combat. 

In ToME, every class is absolutely loaded with skills and abilities. Passive perks, active spells, buffs and the like. There's a class for everyone and a lot of fun to be had with them, and combined with the races you've got a lot of potential for characters. You could play a Berserker and cut people down through your bloodlust, an Alchemist who crafts potions and bombs on the fly to tear apart a crowd, or a Paradox Mage and change the perspective through the manipulation of spacetime itself. Each class has tons of abilities and skill trees, and you can invest into specific types of abilities (say I wanted to focus on grappling instead of one-handed skills) to suit your tastes or your needs for that situation. Combat is a matter of knowing when to use your abilities and resource management. Using an ability puts it on a cooldown and uses up a certain percentage of a turn. Some abilities don't take any time at all, some may use up your entire turn. Each one has a different range, a different effect and a different cost. Summoning skeletons, controlling minds, throwing enemies across the room, and stopping time are among the many abilities you can learn within the game.

Ability costs are an important element. Early classes such as Mages and Warriors may use mana, which is about as straightforward as it gets. The more advanced professions may use alternative resources such as Hate, which is built by attacking and being attacked - or Paradox, which can be used freely, but the more it's used, the higher the chance for you to be affected by random effects such as teleporting and spell backfire. Learning how to effectively manage these resources is half of the challenge, and as you get stronger and fight tougher enemies you'll need every bit of your wits and patience if you want to make it out alive. As with other roguelikes, there's of course plenty of equipment and items to find, and it ranges from armor and weapons with random stats to powerful, unique items that may have a little more behind them.

While it's not central to the game in any way, there actually is quite a bit of information on the world you're in. You'll find little lore pages scattered around the world which tell you just a little bit more about Maj'Eyal. For anyone who doesn't care, the game doesn't force this on you in any way, but for those who want a little extra, it's there.

The game actually has a wonderful presentation given the genre. The little tiles for the characters and maps look quite nice and I can totally tell what I'm looking at, so there's that. The music is nothing to write home about but it's all good stuff and fits the environments well, making my dungeon crawls quite the enjoyable romp. The HUD and info are all pretty clear and easy to understand, and as you get more skills the hotbar expands so you've got everything in one place. You can play the entire thing with mouse, keyboard, or with both, which is nice. It's always nice to keep your options open and luckily there's a lot of em.

Interestingly, there's also online servers. You can store your characters online and keep items in a cloud vault to transfer them between characters. If you access your profile online it'll show all your characters and everything, which is a neat touch. There's a global chat too and the community is very friendly, which is great! If you die, your death is also broadcasted to the entire server, so you have extra pressure. It's a needless feature, but a great one nonetheless.

[h1]Key Points[/h1]
+ Roguelike combat is indeed challenging and tactical
+ Solid music that really helps with the atmosphere
+ Classes are all fun to play and interesting
+ Optional lore pages do great in providing players extra incentive and fleshing out the world
+ Comprehensible and easy to use UI
+ Serverside saves!

[h1]Get If[/h1]
- You LOVE roguelikes
- Smashing goblins with energy blasts you rewound through time and blasting foes with your blood sounds like your cup of tea
- You LOOOOVE roguelikes
- You're looking for something combat-centric

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A must-play, and it's cheap as dirt too. There's a free version on the website but if you can, support the dev and buy it on Steam.

The learning curve is light, play is incredibly deep, and then depending on your chosen character and race, massively different approach and tactics needed every time.  There is so much variety and orginality, you can't help but start multiple campaigns never finshing before wanting to see how that other combo works.

Not a fan or never really played traditional roguelikes? Well then...
I bought this game in December of 2014. I've played well over 1000 hours since then and still play it regularly. How many games do you own can you honestly say you play regularly seven years after buying it?

And I still haven't nearly seen everything. I've beaten the game *once* on normal roguelike in that time. (Have actually beaten it once on nightmare roguelike once as well, now.) Yes, it's a difficult game. 

I see a number of reviews complaining that the combat is simplistic and that you either steamroll over things or die. Well, if you approach something that you can't steamroll over as if you can and don't attack strategically, ya, it's going to kill you. The world is dangerous and death is around every corner. Be prepared. 
There will be scenarios where you can't be prepared and you will experience 'cheap' deaths. Such is the nature of roguelikes. Anything can happen. Just roll a new character and let the fun begin again. You'll get used to doing that.

If you're not someone who's attracted by the idea of permenant death, don't worry, there are options for multiple, or even infinite in the donator/steam version, lives. That combined with many difficulty levels, you'll surely be able to find the difficulty that's right for you.

Trust me. If you like roguelikes, fantasy, strategy, turnbased combat, adventuring, death, worldsaving, kitties, angry orcs, god-slaying cephalopods, more death, achievements, vacuums that suck up your free time, or fun, you'll like this game. Trust me. It's got all of these in plenty.

Still not convinced? Ok, like I said, go try it for free from te4.org. 

Or you can trust me. You won't regret it. It's a fantastic game.",1471489804,1701044861,True,21,1,0.70589745044708252,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ToME4 distinguishes itself from other roguelikes by having classes with massive skill lists to increase the number of tactical options in combat. Even the warrior classes typically spend more time deciding which skill to use rather than just hacking away.

But the genre isn't for everyone. Lots of people will run into deaths that they felt were completely unfair and not recognize that there were things they should've done with their equipment setup hours earlier in the run. ToME is really bad at teaching people what they did wrong, I'll give it that.

I figured that a game with such a high rating must have something going for it that I wasn't seeing and that I needed to keep giving it ""just a bit more time"".

I think I got about 3-4 hours in before I realized that no amount of ""more time"" would ever reveal to me what others are seeing in this game.

For me I found it boring, frustrating and mostly luck-based. I really never felt challenged as a player or felt that I was required to truly evaluate what my next move was going to be.  It seemed to be: Either face-roll whatever was in front of me OR kite enemies to a choke-point and then do the obvious attack/skill/whatever.  Continue until you die from circumstances beyond your control.

It presents as a deep strategy game but I can honestly say I felt no strategy beyond absolute basics was ever required for the time I played.

There appears to be a lot of customization in the characters/classes/skills/etc but when it all comes out in terms of gameplay it felt quite shallow.  How can a game feel so shallow when there is so much apparent ""depth"" to the character customization?  I have no idea, but this game found the formula IMO.

My other big complaint is the UI (user interface) which I found using to be a greater challenge than playing the actual game.

Why won't my character move every 2nd click?  How do I close this window?  Why does this window close when I click OFF it, and this other window requires me to click ON it to close?  Why is there rollover text that needs scrolling, yet when I move the mouse over to scroll it different rollover replaces it before I get there?  Thank goodness I quit drinking because I would have gone rage city while I was still living in the bottle.

The UI- and I want to make it clear I am not talking about the graphics which are a different story - is very bad, very difficult to use, and feels dashed together haphazardly with little regard to how users need and expect information to be presented.  I praise the dev for ATTEMPTING to include font/UI scaling options which more games need. However, adjusting any of the setting made the visual presentation quite atrocious and broke the UI in non-trivial ways.  Resolution settings turned out to be a joke too... anything other than full-screen native resolution made the layout of the UI go berserk.

I don't care that much about graphics, I don't care that much for story, I don't care too much about deep customization.  What I care about is good gameplay, solid craftsmanship, and clean & intuitive interface - I did not find any of those here.",1471209639,1471237622,False,18,2,0.457506418228149414,6,True,False,False,False,,,

1) Permanent socketing. Items can be imbued with gems, which add to the item's stats. Gems can be found and bought, and you can also find more powerful artifact gems. However, all item imbuing is permanent. The result was never using the good gems for imbuing good items, while anxiously wondering whether and when I should. Instead of a bonus, every found artifact became a reminder about potentially shooting myself in the foot. ""Wanna imbue me? You know, it's permanent if you do. A better gem might be just around the corner. Better wait...but is it? You're constantly gimping yourself, you know...""

Tales of Maj'Eyal można ściągnąć za darmo z oficjalnej strony gry, więc jeśli szkoda wam 7euro wsparcia dla twórców gry, to nie musicie jej nawet ściągać z torrentów. 

Ale przejdźmy do rzeczy.

Gra jest trudna. I nie trudna w taki sposób jak np. Binding of Isaac, w którym giniesz co jakiś czas i zaczynasz od początku, a przejście gry nie zajmuje zwykle więcej niż 1-2 godzin. W Tales of Maj'Eyal śmierć jest ciosem w cojones, który zwali Cię z krzesła i sprawi, że zapiszczysz jak rozjeżdżany szynszyl. Owszem, podstawowy tryb gry pozwala nam na kilka śmierci, i daje jedno życie co kilka poziomów doświadczenia. Jednak te kilka żyć nigdy nie wystarcza, i pierwsze podejścia do gry mogą zniechęcić bardziej niż siarczany oddech po Amarenie. I w 90% śmierć będzie tylko i wyłącznie waszą winą. Nie zobaczyliście lecącej w was strzały i 1% HP? A może też przeceniliście siłę rzadkiej toksycznej rośliny? Tutaj śmierć oznacza stratę wszystkiego co osiągneło się przez kilka(dziesiąt) godzin.

Ale każdy kiedys umrze.

Jednak pozostałe 10% zgonów spowodowane jest cudownym, bezbłędnym, oryginalnym i wk***iającym systemem generowania świata. Podziemia, lasy, sady, i wszelkie inne zadupia zamieszkane przez hordy wrogów generowane są bardzo dobrze. No może czasem wyskoczą jakieś śmieszne błędy graficzne, albo drzewa rosnące w pustce otaczającej mapy (i moją duszę), ale losowemu generowaniu wiele mozna wybaczyć. Co innego z przeciwnikami. Nie raz szedłem sobie podziemiem czarnym jak skóra smażonego murzyna, wybijając hordy myszy, pełzających glutów i cholera wie czego jeszcze, gdy nagle z tych nieznających Słońca czeluśli wypadł przeciwnik przewyższający mnie poziomem, umiejętnościami, który co kilka tur regenerował całe zycie a mnie zmiatał swoim pierdem z powierzchni planety. No rozumiem, może się to zdarzyć raz, dwa albo dziesięć, ale za setnym razem wk**wia bardziej niż zaproszenia do Candy Crush.

Przez jakieś 30 godzin utrzymywałem przy życiu mojego elfa-alchemika o wdzięcznym imieniu Gaydalf Deepthroater, dotarłem na drugi kontynent, a tu nagle okazało się, że wrogowie tam spotykani mogli rozerwać mnie dmuchnięciem. I umarłem. Po 30 godzinach skończyły mi się życia i mój cudowny elf poszedł się j*bać z Amy Winehouse i Whitney Houston.

Co jeszcze wkurza? Nigdy nie ufajcie minimalnym poziomom doświadczenia wymaganym do wejścia do podziemi itp. To jest większe kłamstwo niż teoria okrągłej Ziemi. Jeśli wymagany jest poziom 15 to lepiej nabijcie minimum 20, może nie umrzecie w ciągu 10 minut. 

Pomarudziłem, to teraz czas rozpisać sie nad pozytywami.  
Najmocniejszą stroną tej gry jest mechanika - bardzo złożona, działająca idealnie i niemożliwa do ogarnięcia przez pierwsze kilkadziesiąt godzin. Każdy przedmiot jest opisany masą dziwnych numerków i literek, których można nie rozumieć, ale każde +0.0001 do krytyka będzie się liczyło w rozgrywce. Nie żeby komuś chciało sie w to wczytywać, ale miło jest znaleźć przedmiot +25% do obrażeń od ognia albo ch*j wie czego jeszcze. Dodam, że każdy przedmiot ma losowo generowane statystyki, więc (poza artefaktami) można znaleźć chyba nieskończoną ilość kombinacji. 
Rozwój postaci jest stosunkowo prosty, jednak jeśli nie ma się pojęcia co rozwijać u danej klasy śmierć nadejdzie szybko. Każda klasa ma dziesiątki umiejętności pasywnych i aktywowanych ręcznie. Można je łączyć w śmiercionośne kombinacje albo klikać losowo, co często jest skuteczniejsze niz planowanie. Mam nadzieje że umiecie angielski na poziome średnio zaawansowanym, bo bez tego nie pogracie.

Nad grafiką nie będe się rozpisywał. Jak na rogalika jest ona złożona, można nawet powiedzieć, że ładna. Owszem, nie ma animacji ruchu, ani jakichkolwiek animacji postaci, ale po co to komu? Wiadomo co jest czym, a to wystarczy.
Muzyka jest całkiem porządna - czasem spokojne granie na flecie, czasem epickie rzępolenie na skrzypcach, a czasem nawet metalowe riffy na gitarze elektrycznej. Ale jako że metal łączy sie z fantastyką lepiej niż kwas z ziołem, to taka muzyka pasuje idealnie.
Questy często generowane sa losowo (np. odprowadź upośledzonego wojownika-karła do portalu), lecz można znaleźć dziesiątki misji bardziej złożonych (np. idź tam i tam, weź to i to, a potem przynieś żeby dostać elficką wiagrę). Gra posiada jakąś linię fabularną, jednak nieszczególnie interesowało mnie śledzenie jej (nigdy tej gry nie przeszedłem, wstyd...). 
Mapa świata jest średniej wielkości, i zanim nabijemy poziom wymagany do przejścia na inny kontynent możemy nie mieć co robić. Ale zawsze znaleźć można coś nowego, więc trudno się nudzić. 

Jako że nagle odechciało mi się pisać dalej, to jeb*ę wam plusy i minusy:
Plusy:
-złożona mechanika
-interesujący świat z porządną historią i setkami lektur do przeczytania
-grafika (jak na rogalika)
-muzyka 
-wymagająca ale wynagradzająca
-wciąga jak uliczna heroina
-1629 achievementów :I
-warsztat Steam
-generowanie poziomów i przedmiotów

Minusy:
-generowanie niektórych przeciwników
-poziom trudności może odstraszyć niedzielnych graczy
-okazjonalne błędy graficzne

This is partly due to my lack of time, and partly due to the fact that I jump from one game to the next at a rapid rate. Few games can hold my attention for very long, as many are quickly consigned to the heap of unplayed or lightly games cluttering my Steam collection.

Tales of Maj'Eyal is one of the few that have captured my interest and kept my interest, as one of only 7 or 8 games that I've played beyond 50 hours (four of which are either MMOs or server-based games where I idle). 

Part of the reason that Tales of Maj'Eyal is so special to me is that it is both flexible and complex at the same time. As with many of the other rogue-likes that I have played, Tales of Maj'Eyal features some potentially difficult moments and countless opportunities for deaths. When I first started playing Tales of Maj'Eyal, I died quite often in Trollmire, one of the starting zones. Even now, with more than 50 hours under my belt, it's still not uncommon for me to face various mid to high level enemies (stone throwing giants and dragons in particular) that can potentially one-shot my character.

And here's where the first appeal of Tales of Maj'Eyal comes in. Unlike many rogue-likes, death doesn't mean the end of your character. In the standard adventure mode, you can come back to life after one death (or more often, as you level). In exploration mode, you can come back to life an infinite number of times. Not only that, the resurrection NPC allows you to resurrect on the world map instead of right where you died, especially helpful if you went into battle against an enemy that you have no chance of beating. If you want the standard rogue-like permadeath mode, Tales of Maj'Eyal offers that too, along with three difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard). Even if this sort of convention goes against standard rogue-likes, it does make this game more forgiving and more open to someone like me who has limited time to play and/or start over new characters. 

When I do want to experiment with new characters and playstyles, Tales of Maj'Eyal offers a fair range of both races and classes. Each of these races and classes has different skill trees, and one playthrough offers a different experience from the next. I started out playing a defensive warrior type, then moved on to play an archer showering arrows, then a summoner leading an army, and now am experimenting with a mage that manipulates time. As you play through the game and complete tasks and quests, even more options are unlocked.

This flexibility and complexity is what makes Tales of Maj'Eyal the perfect rogue-like for me. Oh sure, other rogue-likes offer benefits that Tales of Maj'Eyal doesn't. Dungeons of Dredmor has (in my opinion) better item mechanics and better art. Elona (YMMV) offers more complexity, and there are so-called action rogue-likes that might provide more instant gratification without so much frustration. I suppose the graphics are somewhat outdated as well (though, pretty good compared to many other rogue-likes).

When I first started playing Tales of Maj'Eyal, I thought of the game's relationship to the original Rogue similar to that of World of Warcraft to Everquest. Perhaps it might be insulting to compare Tales of Maj'Eyal to World of Warcraft, but some elements of this comparison are apt. LIke WoW, Tales of Maj'Eyal makes the rogue-like more accessible, more graphically attractive, and hopefully, more popular to a general audience.

That last element is what I truly want to become a reality. I have no idea how popular Tales of Maj'Eyal actually is (not being much of a forum goer or researcher on the topic), but I feel like it definitely deserves far more attention and acclaim than it receives. Perhaps a mobile version might help improve its exposure to the general public?

For anyone who's interested or simply curious about this game, there's no reason not to give it a try. After all, the full base game, with most of the features, can be played for free on the Tales of Maj'Eyal official website. If you feel like the game is right for you, you can then buy it, either on the official website or on Steam to get the donator features (special class, various cosmetic features, vault, etc) and then, when you want more, buy the DLC expansions.

In short, why is Tales of Maj'Eyal a great game for me and potentially a great game for you? I think it comes down to the fact that Tales of Maj'Eyal is a rogue-like that can be accomodated to your tastes. The difficulty can be whatever you want it to be, the playstyle can be whatever you want it to be, and the game is sufficiently long enough and filled with quests and lore that it'll be hundreds of hours before you, me, or anyone else could come close to experiencing it all.

Again, there's no harm in giving it a try. Download the game on the website to see if it's right for you. If it isn't, then you'll just move on to something else. However, if you're like me, perhaps you will discover that Tales of Maj'Eyal is a gem of a game, one that really stands out from the others and shines like a beacon of a light in the vast collection of games available on Steam.",1465375361,1465375371,True,10,0,0.629108846187591553,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am pretty sure this game is a very good rogue-like game. And I sure know there is a lot of content. Tons of customization in your character and probably many quests (have not been able to get that far myself). A great bang for the buck no doubt about it.

BUT, where is its soul? Where is the drive to continue playing? I sure miss it. It seems to be a very good exploration game, but combat is, at its best, dull as hell. Either you steam roll over your enemies, or they destroy you. There is no in between, no tactics involved. Basically, a left click fest.

What are the effects during combat? Why can't I move sometimes? Why is it so difficult to understand what is going on (meaning what effects are affecting your character and why)?

I am sure it is a good game, but I can't recommend it.

In any case, I sure will give it another try just to see whether I missed something obvious.

I'll go ahead and write my pointless review, though. I have nothing better to do with my life.

Tales of Maj'Eyal (TOME) is a quirky, old roguelike that has seen a few iterations. Once “Tales of Middle Earth” it has morphed, refined, and evolved over the years stripping out the Tolkien story elements and replacing them with quasi-World of Warcraft story elements. It's still changing and improving, new patches are always under development.

I am ambivalent about the story. I like that there are no REAL bad guys, nor faultless heroes, everyone is just looking out for themselves and their own. Even the demons have legitimate gripes and may in fact be right. On the other hand it's all rather shallow, and borrows a little too heavily from WoW. Elves toy with magic out of their league, blow up planet and shattering continents, some elves turn into naga, a group of humans are trapped on another continent hounded by orcs, where have I heard this before? Player motivation is limited to “Maybe there is treasure there?” and “I heard a rumor about this place, maybe there I can murder something?”

Honestly though, who plays a roguelike for the story? Gameplay is where TOME shines and why it is probably my favorite game right now. TOME is a self-declared “tactical roguelike”. You'll need to carefully manage cooldowns and move around the battlefield to survive. Some of the bosses can really tax your ability to juggle offensive and defensive spells.

There are many classes to try, no two of whom play the same. Some classes are great at jumping on opponents and soaking damage, others can dance around the battlefield dodging arrows and picking enemies off one at a time. Even the mages have a great variety, from the long range nuking elemental Archmage to the short range heal-and-shield celestial Anorithil.

This game also sports a massive amount of mods and player content. People have created new classes, races with unique starting areas, and additional quests. Check out the steam workshop but also the developer's site, as some people only post their mods there.

My biggest gripe is that the game is a little too random. There are too many stats and most of them are worthless to any given character. Multiple times I've gotten to mid-game without finding any useful gear, either from drops or shops. Rares, opponents with player abilities, and random bosses can be obscenely powerful, some can't even be killed and you have to run away from them.

As for the DLC they are both great additions and should be purchased. One warning, the new classes added to the game can make certain rares really tough if you don't know how to handle them. The Embers of Rage campaign is a sequel to the base game and might spoil some of the story for you. I recommend buying the base game first and purchasing the DLC once you have beaten the game at least once.",1464305946,1464305946,True,17,4,0.655045390129089355,1,True,False,False,False,,,

When we look at roguelikes nowadays, we think of a couple things - text or pixel graphics, large pool of character customization, similar design but different feel every playthrough, massive replayability. Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) simply offers the best roguelike experience one could get: deep, nuanced gameplay that is not only highly customizable and replayable but also accessible to even someone who's new to the genre.

One of the greatest hurdles that roguelike games have in appealing to the mainstream is the massive complexity that can be seen in some roguelikes. ToME, in fact, is a testament to this - featuring the most number of unique classes that I've ever seen in a game, all of which have differing playstyles and specializations, ranging from the ever-reliable warrior to shield-bearing mages manipulating earth magic to combat alchemists controlling massive golems. In most roguelikes, this complexity is rarely explained - and some would attest to finding out what X item is for as a part of the roguelike charm. What makes ToME remarkable, though, is making this complexity as accessible as possible. The tooltips for each skill, talent, or item not only gives concise, pertinent information that is easily understandable but even features some lore or description - which, in combination with in-game lore fleshes out a massive and detailed world.

The graphics also are very pleasing. They obviously are not as polished or as pretty like the Endless series (Dungeon of the Endless etc), but the individual NPC/PC tiles have a tabletop RPG feel and further help flesh the world out with great visuals. The sound shines through in this game - the background music for each zone fits the zone's theme well without distracting the player.

Replayability is also one of the major criteria that roguelikes are measured with. ToME is, in all seriousness, the absolute best value game - there are so many race and class combinations you can try, and within one class there are several ways of playing. A great non-spoiler example of this would be the Rogue, which can focus on hit-and-run stealth tactics, using debilitating poisons and tricks to bring down enemies to their knees, or using a variety of traps to contain and damage foes. One of the absolute best examples of this would be [b](spoiler)[/b] [spoiler]the melee/ranged hybrid Temporal Warden class, which simply has so many options and gameplay styles: Bounce around the map, doing damage and teleporting out of sight all in the blink of an eye (Threaded Combat); Summon entities to fight with you (Temporal Hounds); Bend space and time to prevent damage to you and stop enemies in their tracks (Stasis); or even focus your attacks on one enemy as you seal their fate (Fate Weaving)[/spoiler]. There's simply so many things you can try that even with a non-procedural map and game flow there is still almost limitless replayability to the game - if you can beat it, that is!

I've played roguelikes for a long while - coming from classics like Angband, to modern games that stretch the limits of the genre such as Dungeon of the Endless and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and to modern reimaginings and improvements on the genre - where games like Elona and ToME fall. While most modern roguelikes stretch the definition and innovate the genre in so many ways, ToME sticks close to the genre's roots and provides a high quality, high value gameplay experience. Thus, Tales of Maj'Eyal stands tall as the absolute best that the roguelike genre can offer.",1464073250,1464073332,True,5,1,0.544403076171875,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, I have yet to play a game compelling enough to make me want to take the time to write a review; until now.

Tales of Maj'Eyal is a rare kind of game. On the surface, it doesn't look like much, but there is so much depth and complexity to this game, its simple appearance doesn't do it any justice (not that there is anything wrong with the appearance). I say this is rare because I feel that most games do the opposite; they may have amazing visuals, but often fall short when it comes to depth and complexity. Visuals don't hold my interest very long if the game doesn't have much else to offer. What it lacks in visuals, it makes up for in mechanics.

This game is a rogue-like RPG, but it changes a few things up. For one, there is no need to eat. Some may argue that this detracts from the rogue-like experience, and normally I would probably agree, but I feel that this game is more focused on the tactical combat aspect as opposed to the survival aspect, and I commend it in that regard. Another difference is the lack of potions. Instead of potions, which require farming to replenish, this game uses something called inscriptions, in the form of runes or infusions. These inscriptions fill the same role as potions, but they operate on a cooldown instead of being limited-use, effectively eliminating any need for farming potions, which is a fantastic idea, in my opinion.

The game is difficullt. You will die, a lot. At the time of writing this review, I have 376.8 hours under my belt and I have only beaten the game once, but I don't plan on giving up any time soon. One thing that makes the unforgiving nature of the game more bearable are the persistent unlocks. When you first boot up the game, you will have a relatively limited selection of birth options, in the form of races and classes. As you play, you unlock more birth options permanently, in addition to unlocking new game modes and even skill trees. There is a ton of replayability here.

The developers of this game are consistently polishing the game and considering feedback from the community. A cool feature of this game is an in-game chat room where you can ask for tips, discuss strategies, and talk directly to developers. It's a great feature and is probably the closest thing to multiplayer we will see in a game like this. You can tell that the developers poured their blood, sweat, and tears into this game to make something exceptional. And they have succeeded.

This game is nearly perfect in my eyes. It is an exemplary rogue-like, and although it does some things a little differently, it does them extremely well. It has come such a long way and gets better every day. Do not hesitate if you are on the fence. Send me a personal message and I will convince you. This game is worth every penny and the developers deserve support for the great work that they do.

It might take an hour or so of playing to really understand what's going on and how the game works, but once you figure it out the game really opens up.

Pros:
- Many races and classes to choose from, allows for quite a few styles of play
- Combat greatly rewards the use of tactics
- Turn-based, so you can take as long as you need to to strategize

Cons:
- Campaign mode is quite long, can easily play a character for 6 hours then have them die, which is heart-breaking
- Loot doesn't seem to matter much for magic-based characters. Also not much incentive to buy anything as a mage either.
- Although dungeons have random layouts, the campaign mode is pretty much the same every time. This can make the beginning of the game tedious once you've done it several times and it doesn't really change

Neutral:
- Graphics. I personally like the graphics in the game, but some might find them dated

All in all I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys difficult, turn-based rpg's. If for some reason you hate grinding or repetition, you ay have problems with this game.

Tales of Maj'Eyal or TOME is clone of ADOM. The keybinding are the same, classes are the same and fans of the original will find many more similarities. If I didn't enjoying play or rather enjoying dying in the original game, I probably would enjoy this game more. 

My general thoughts about the game (trying to keep it balanced)
I enjoyed the different classes. Making decisions to improve my character. You always feel like you are improving. However your characters skills may improve, overall the game felt incredibly stale and boring. Who cares about the items? the weapons? the books? This is what I turn my attention to next: looting system and gameplay.

In TOME, I pick up a few weapons to kill a few more enemies more quickly as I mindlessly and easily kill them. I really didn't get any satisfaction from looting.  This is because TOME is just sooo much easier than the original as well as TOME doesn't give you the chance to just pick up a weapon and try it. In ADOM, you can dig at the walls, getting some rocks (if your axepick doesn't break) where you can use to throw at the invading enemies. This is totally eliminated in TOME. You need a talent to even use a bow or sling? Come on! This meant for my playthrough I just had many millions of mindless, predictably leveled and simple enemies to grind my way through. Great for fans of WOW who love the grind and level up your character, but boring for everyone else. In ADOM, you are just one slime mold, hard armoured enemy, or river from losing your cherished weapon. In TOME, who cares? Your weapon will never get damaged. In ADOM, if you pick up a special wand of teleportation with 2 charges, it could easy save your life in a tough pinch. Without that special item, you could easily die. If you carefully zap that wand when you have no other escape, it could save your life if your luck is with you. If luck is against you, you could still die and unlike TOME with almost infinite resaves (roguelike my ass!) there is no teleporting back in the game once you died. If you used that wand too early, you might not have it later when you REALLY need it. Even a decision like using a wand was just sooo much more important in ADOM. In TOME, who cares? You quickly get the tp spell on a 9 turn cooldown. In comparison, many games I didn't even run into the wand even once. So when you got the loot in ADOM, it really meant something. In TOME, looting was just a tedious chore. 

Let me explain more about the difference between TOME (the clone) and the original by way of a story. In ADOM, I remember being excited about finding every single item. Often high powered stuff would drop that was far above your level. If you got that loot, you were pretty much golden (until it rusted, broke, was stolen by a thief, obliterated by spells, or burned up). Then when your prized weapon invariably was destroyed, you realized that you only had 7 rocks and two loaves of bread before starvation or death. Then after defeating a kobold, you realize that he dropped a book containing powerful magic. You hear something being killed in the level, so you open a door,  lock it and begin to read the book. You feel more hunger and as the hunger continues to get stronger, you finish the book, and learn the magic. You then remember that you carefully dropped some food and some extra weapons on some stairs a few levels above. As you use your new powerful magic to destroy the enemies coming for you, you begin to feel more and more hungry (first see yellow notification for hunger, then an orange notification). As I'm describing this, I slipping a bit into the character of the game. The graphics were non-existent, just letter characters for each enemy but the many choices you could make in the game made you feel like you were in the game. Getting back to the story, as our intrepid hero continues slowly towards the stairs, and the notifications continue to flash more dire, you realize that your hero is not going to make it. You look in your inventory. You notice a seed and a kobold corpse. You quickly eat the seed. You take one more step, staving off death for one more step. You are only a few steps from death. You look in the inventory and now you see a rotting kobold corpse. You realize that you are dead. You eat the kobold corpse, become paralyzed and stunned. After unsuccessfully trying to move, you suddenly die in two turns, still close to the stairs and the weapon and food drop. After heroically surviving the loss of your prized possession, your hero dies from starvation so close to his goal. This is what I loved about ADOM, getting really high level loot, getting attacked by surprising high level enemies, almost dying, surviving before finally dying. 

I have lost many many characters in ADOM. It was really interesting trying to discover the code for the game. I tried my best, but like Sid Meier's Pirates, the game was next to impossible to finish. TOME has many elements that I loved about the original. Discovering the Infinite Dungeon, Troll's Cave, Gladiator Tournament all felt cool to me once again. I still really enjoy the premise behind TOME. I think I'll probably eventually end up playing more of this game. Maybe if I can create some overpowered raccoons/companions to follow me around, I'll feel like less of a letdown. I had a lot of happy memories playing ADOM. Throwing massive stones throw doorways to break the doors down into very much needed wood that I could use to make arrows was a lot of fun. Even creating loyal zombies to follow me around as a necromancer was a lot of fun. Fighting powerful enemies that could stun you, blind you, or do many dastardly things to you was a lot of fun. If I can dramatically ramp up the difficulty, TOME might do it for me. 

I only don't recommend it because as a die hard fan, I feel they could have done so much more.

What it is instead is a classical steep-learning-curve, hard-to-master roguelike with some surprisingly deep, well thought out game mechanics. 

If you're looking for a challenge or even simply an ARPG with an incredible replay value - randomly generated zones, huge number of interesting races and classes with their unique gameplay, 3 gameplay modes between the campaign, the arena and the infinite dungeon - you're looking in the right place. You can even choose your own flavor away from difficulty setting by deciding not to play a roguelike at all but instead venture into exploration mode and simply discover the world of Eyal with lives to spare. Oh, and let me mention the wonderful, always spot-on soundtrack too. You'll know what I mean when entering the arena. 

Now, as far as flaws go.. ToME comes with surprisingly little (and even less that some addon, readily available in the workshop, can't fix for you). There's the odd balance or fumbling with the UI issue and 'graphic that could have been this tad better' but these minor troubles do tend to pale in comparison to the overall expirience and the number of for-your-convenience features the game brings, some of which - like the 'auto use when' function that for example automatically starts up your sustained abilities under specified conditions - I would have wished for in AA genre titles.

Overall ToME is an incredible achievement not only but especially by an indie developer and I would highly urge every genre fan to give it a spin.

Those who have been playing Roguelikes for a while or who know the genre from its roots may find a nice feel of classics such as Nethack and Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) in this game, as it keeps elements of those games, as well as the genre's originator, ROGUE itself intact, while throwing in a few modern entities that work very well.

Its accessable and easy to get into. numerous races and classes to play as, and you will unlock more of both as you play, even with just the base game! 
Even workshop classes you can download, havent tried any of those though.

So all your dungeons are randomly generated each playthrough, but the over world stays the same im pretty sure. Each race starts in a different place and with a different backstory depending on your race and class. The main story quests stay about the same but its nice that you can tackle them in anyway you want, I still havent been able to beat the game.

One of my favorite things about TOME is the different campaigns, the base game has 3, The main one and two unlockable ones. One is a gladiator arena campaign and if you beat it with a character that character will be the last boss for the next character! very cool. 

Another thing I find sets TOME apart from other roguelikes is the selectable difficulties, they not only have easy,normal, hard type selections but also there is exploration,adventure,roguelike choices where roguelike gives your character only 1 life (unless you can find magical items that add to it)  to live through the quest, Adventure gives you a 'free' life after certain level milestones, so when you die with an extra life you get to choose if you want to respawn where you died or outside the area. And exploration gives you unlimited lives.

DONT LET YOUR DREAMS OF DEATH AND DYING AND LOOT BE DREAMS

no, but really, this game is great
lots and lots of different build for each class, huge number of classes, lots of unlocks 
the variety tends to be backloaded rather than frontloaded; in most roguelikes, you can pick any class/race combo to start: in ToME, you unlock more as you play through the game
unlocking stuff as you go provides a real sense of achievement and accomplishment, especially soncsidering how fucking hard the game is

8/10


Pros:
-Good storyline
-Lots of interesting lore and history to be discovered
-Reminds me of good classic RPGs (such as rogue, obviously, and D&D)
-Not easy or annoyingly difficult
-Lots of classes and races to unlock
-Lots of interesting gear to find
-Balanced leveling-up and skill unlock system
-Very fun to play

Cons:
-There are large walls of text that give lore, history, and important plot information
-You might not get the whole ""feel"" of the game if you don't read these walls of text
-Some of the side-quests are hard, and it can be frustrating if you fail them
-There is no rewinding to fix failed side-quests, because of the auto-save and you can only have one save for each run at a time (in other words, if you fail a side-quest you're screwed)
-There's a HUGE amount of key bindings to memorize
-Movement is with arrow keys by default and it is extremely annoying to rebind them to wsad
-It seems like the person who wrote the text in the game doesn't speek English as a first language because some of it is awkwardly writen and/or has basic grammer errors.

I was hoping for a game that offered some interesting choices and different paths to victory, but was very disappointed with TOME.  My 6 hours was spent handily defeating everything in an area until things got too hard, then backing out to another stage and doing the same.  I got the feeling I could do that for 60 hours, then win the game.

If you like lore and you like loot, this game has tons.  But for me, the gameplay just didn't sell it.

I definitely recommend this game for anybody who has an appreciation for rougelikes. 
It has everything that a rougelike needs; huge replayability value, good combat system, 
randomly generated locations. The list goes on and on. 

Online chat is a brilliant feature and it's quite awesome that the developer launches some special events for people in game from time to time. 

There is one thing that bothers me though, and I dislike it so much that I have decided to write this review. 
This game is not fair. It's imbalanced, there are classes not worth putting time into. And you need a lot of time to try to pass the game. 
After investing a few  hours in the character you created, you are going to die because of some stupid reason. 
E.g. playing a reaver lvl 25 I was killed by a creature immune to 90% of my attacks in a main-quest location. 
I grinded every other lower level zone before exploring this one, but it did not matter. Dead. Nothing new unlocked on this run (at least 6 hours spent on it). 
Playing berserker, above level 30, lost my last life because I was teleported during life-saving skill which could not work in this location (Using unstoppable and being thrown to fearscape). Boom. Random death. Hours gone. 
Countless deaths while playing archmage, killing myself with my own fireball blast hitting invisible enemies who were too close. 
Some of those deaths could be avoided, but there are ones against which you are helpless. ""Memento mori"" is not my favourite thing to be reminded of while playing a game. 

If you like spending way too many hours only to lose and start again, apparently you are a true rougelike fan and this game is for you. If you care about the time you spend on games, go play something else instead.

[h1]Tales Of Maj'Eyal[/h1]

~Spoiler Free Review!~
--------NOTE---------

This review is based off the majority of my play with mods. For around 90% of my hours on the game, I have spent it with mods. I shall list what mods I used at the bottom of the review, but none are extreme enough to change any of the core concepts of the game. The mods I've used made information easier to understand.

Oooh boy. I absolutely love this game. I really, really do. If I had to pick a single game to bring with me into, say, Space, this game would be my pick, hands down.

[h1]Community[/h1]
You know what's strange for a Rouge-lite game? Having encouragement to directly talk with the community. Yeah, strange, isn't it? Whenever you're in the game, and you're online...you're connected to the community with a button-press away. There's a window on your screen (that isn't intrusive) where people's achievements within the game and conversations are. You can link items and monsters you find to show off to others the items you've found, or to ask for strategies on creatures you've never faced before. I do reccomend a mod called ""Die In Obscurity"" so you don't see how every single person dies. It can overflow the chat at times. Afraid of spoilers from the community? No problem! The moment someone types something that's considered spoilerly, they will be sent to ToME Spoiler Chat. It's an automatic system, so you won't even see a glance of spoilers. I've NEVER had a issue with the community, and have had quite a few conversations with the dev himself, Darkgod. The moderators are absolutely awesome as well! Good on all of you!

So, yes, this is indeed a positive for the game. I encourage you, as well, to take part in the community!


[h1]Combat[/h1]
I'll talk about the story in a bit, but I believe this is to be the BIGGEST draw to the game. The combat.

You see, Tales Of Maj'Eyal is complex. This, sadly, can be a heavy drawback for those who would rather actually enjoy it. In every single turn (every single move you make) has a LOT of things considered, from the speed of projectiles flying at you, to how spells affect the enviorment are re-checked to apply their affect again, and how everyone runs around. This is perhaps one of the only turn-based RPGs I know that has a heavy emphasis on mobilty. You CANNOT, I REPEAT, CANNOT run around without a plan. You. Will. [b]DIE.[/b] Doesn't matter if you have badass armor and defense-increasing skills on. You cannot block everything or tank everything. Even TANKS in this game have to consider mobility, and know when it's time to run and reposition themselves. The only class that can remotely do this is Bulwark, which I feel is ""THE"" class everyone should play first. They have a rediculous amount of defense, but it won't get you too far in the game alone. Learning the game takes time, and many deaths.

On the bright side, this complex combat is actually very satisfying once you understand how it works. There's SO MANY WAYS TO END YOUR FOES. From [b][i]DEVOURING THEM[/i][/b] to [b][i]YELLING AT THEM TO DEATH.[/i][/b] The amount of classes is purely absurd, and to this day I've STILL not tried them all. On top of that, you have Races. Humans, Elves...There's many more, and each has sub-species within it. The reason why I won't say who they are, is because it's considered spoilers. Sorry. Although, I will say there's only a few races that have classes usable only by them, you can mix and match pretty much anything. There's a lot of depth in a single class, and with so many, there's a lot to learn here. On top of that, the loot is satisfying to obtain. I've even carried some things I couldn't use because it just sounded so badass. I ain't giving my Corpsebow to a mere shopkeeper!

Also, the difficulty settings are very varied. You have two different kinds that come into play when you play the game. Difficulty, and the Style of the Difficulty.

{Easy}

{Normal}

{Nightmare}

---and so on---   Those difficulties change how hard the game is. How strong foe's talents are, the level of the zones, and so on. The higher the difficulty, the more EXP you earn. There are three difficulties locked when you start the game.

And the Styles:

{Exploration}  Infinite lives. You are beyond death! The difficulty I say you should NEVER play, it ruins the experience. But if you don't like having a bad time, I won't judge you. There are a lot of gorgeous sights to see in the game.

{Adventure} You gain lives on select level-ups. Simple, not overpowered, but not the core experience.

{Rougelike} ""You ARE your character."" You only have one life. The moment you die, your character is immediately deleted. :gameover: However! You can still find ways to revive yourself in game, such as a rare-as-it-can-get vial. THIS is the Style of difficulty I always play on. It's my preference.



[h1]Appearance[/h1]

It's visuals....are alright. It's your typical fantasy style, but it's not too distracting for me, actually. It's the enviorment I'm in, so I roll with it. It's great for what it is, there's a LOT of variety here! You'll be in space, heaven and hell, wintery landscapes, swamps, and volcanoes! Personally, I like it. But I can see how people might be ""turned off"" by it. Honestly, there's not a lot to say. One of the few games I say imagination works in it's favor!



[h1]Sound[/h1]
It serves it's duty. Spells sound like spells, fists sound like fists, steel sounds like steel. There's no glaring issue with the sound, but nor is there anything that stands out as supreme. The soundtrack? Well...The music in the game is the same, it serves what it's meant to do. I honestly have muted the music for a long time now, and have other things in the background, like the news or music. It's one of THOSE kinds of games, despite it's complexity, where you can focus on other things while playing it. It IS turn based, as well.

On that note, like how I feel with Sanctuary RPG, once I've played long enough, I'm ""in tune"" with the game, reading information at only a glance, making actions with speed and care. Even when I set the game down for a few weeks, I was very easilly able to get back into this state.


[h1]Story[/h1]

The story of Maj'Eyal is a fantasy, what would you expect? If you can suspend disbelief, you will find so much to read and learn about the word. Well written poems, stories, and last words of daring adventurers before you. There are several campaigns, but the one with the most amount of story is, well, ""Tales Of Maj'Eyal"". There is also the Arena and the Infinite Dungeon. Personally, the Arena isn't very fun to me, but I absolutely LOVE the Infinite Dungeon. You and the endless dungeon crawling experience that this game offers, with nothing in your way beyond blood thirsty monsters and glorious loot. It feels alive.


[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
All in all, there's not too many RPGs like this. Where it manages to be...a community driven single player game. It's definately unique in that regard. With such a cheap RPG, why not buy it? Well, the initial ramp of difficulty (and throughout the game, regardless of skill) requires stategy over going wild with a sword, so this isn't the kind of game you can sit down with if you have little time. It respects your time, however, and the community is very helpful, VERY alive...The sound and appearance will not satisfy everyone, but it serves what it lives for. Things sound exactly like they would. I don't think giving it a ""Score"" would satisfy myself with the review, so I'll simply give the answer of ""I highly reccomend this."" To ALL RPG fans!

So with that in mind, this is my ""first"" review. My experience within this game is limited (37.9 hrs at time of post), but my time with this game may be much more when looked at in the future. Now lets get to the meat of the review, the pros and cons.

Pros:

+ Great, meticulous tactical gameplay
+ An intricate skill tree system (Which can be expanded through various events)
+ Unforgiving (given that it is a rougelike game)
+ Dedicated support from DarkGod, the sole developer (He has been working on this game for over 17 years!)
+ Good support for mods and addons
+ Enticing lore! The world feels very alive and the stories are very well thought out.
+ Fun and deep character creation, especially as you unlock classes and races
+ Interesting classes (I bet your other RPGs don't have Oozemancers or Temproal Wardens!)
+ A good community
+ Very challenging and it will test your abilities
+ The game can be downloaded for free on its website. You won't have access to some small features but you can unlock those by donating money to DarkGod. Otherwise, you can just buy through Steam and get those goodies right off the bat, like I did. 
+ An exploration mode with infinite lives. You can accustom yourself to the game and tinker with various builds and whatnot (This is a special perk for those who donate should you download it from its website) 
+ Alternative modes to play should you get bored of the main story lines (Infinite Dungeon and Arena) 

Cons:

- Graphics are quite dated but this is largely a non-issue. The developer started working on this game in the late 1990s so the engine that the game runs on is very old. Could potentially deter gamers who have only really experienced more recent games like Skyrim, Diablo 3, etc. But you know, their loss.
- Can be rage inducing. The amount of times you die is ridiculous and due to the RNG within the game, you can get very unlucky and run into a monster or mob that erases your pixelated ass. But hey, you knew what you signed up for ;)
- Bugs, crashing, etc. Though these are rare, there have been hiccups which might kill you or just cause you to crash. (I know of one with a passive which allows you to speed up immensely for a short time after killing an enemy and moving with it may cause your game to crash. It has happened to me many times but it was just an annoyance since I set back to my previous save point) It's minor, but something to keep in mind since you can be punished brutally if you make a mistake.

Conclusion:

This is just a great game and one that recieves so much love. Being someone who is relatively new to the ""Rougelike"" genre of games, this game has got me hooked! Outside of the few minor annoyances, this is a full, flushed out game. This thing has recieved more time and dedication than most marriages do in the U.S. (lol) There is so much story and content to this game, most of which I have yet to experience for myself. This game is frustrating in the best of ways. It drives you to go further, try new classes, races, etc. DarkGod (from what I have seen and heard) is very active and continues to work on content for this game. One example is the new expansion he released in February, ""Embers of Rage"" and he has hinted at more expansions that he is or will be working on in the future. He also will create special events in the game and play with those currently playing. I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to those who enjoy a good RPG or rougelike game. It is one in a long string of games that I have enjoyed so much that I binged on it. While this game was released on Steam in 2012 and is a bit dated, I will support this diamond in the rough and I hope you do too!",1457313117,1606698512,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This puke was so mighty that it not only healed him and removed status effects, but also damaged opponenets and cleansed their buffs, all in a large radius around my knight. Combined with my power to project a path of sunshine that took no time to traverse, I'd skate into a room full of baddies, glowing all holy light, spew vomit, and then finish everything off with a direct invocation of the sun that's more like a quasar igniting at the edge of a blackhole.

Did I mention that my random lamp item that made me undead was called 'Taintblight'?

This collision of three entirely different abilities and a crazy and evocative random name generator is only one example of dozens such synergies and strange stories that I have experienced in playing Tales of Maj'Eyal.

Of course much of that imagery came from my own willingness to fill in the blanks because Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike run by one guy (as far as I can tell), who has packed in a tremendous amount of lore, options and imagination. The graphics are like sprites from a nineties turned-based game that would run on a 486. The sounds aren't really any better. The muscial score is acceptable, but since the whole affair runs at my leisure, I listen to absolutely anything else while playing.

But the value in this game isn't in its looks, but in all the options, variations and odd enemies it offers.

While the game can be played like a true roguelike (one life and you're done), there are several difficulty and re-spawn options that help make the game more accessible to players looking for different challenge (and frustration) levels. There are also several unlockable races and classes whose progress is tracked across multiple playthroughs. By opening up more options, the game stays fresh the longer you play.

Of course, having so many class and race combinations leads to wild imbalances in capability. Some combinations simply become mathematically better, overall. However, the game throws so many different kinds of enemies and effects that attack, weaken and kill your character in so many ways that almost any character will expose an Achilles Heel at some point in a playthrough.

The game has incredible difficulty spikes, so playing true roguelike is recommened only for those with tremendous intestinal fortitude. I recall losing a rogue-like character 20 hours into the game due to missing a debuff icon that I didn't recognize, laid on me by an unusual random boss that was blocked by one of the over-sized two-block larger enemies. Of course, since it's turn based I could have taken a beat and re-examined the fifteen different effects, good and bad, that were on my character at that moment, so the mistake is ultimately mine.

That said, I didn't play again for a few days.

This does bring up a complaint about the game's lack of documentation. There are a ton of systems packed in, entire mechanics that might only be encountered on playing a particular character class. These often behave differently from every other resource in the game. Am I expending this resource straight away or do I have to build it up? Does this resource have a conflict or synergy with my armor choices or my other talents?

All these esoteric, imaginative and rule breaking powers interact in ways that aren't always clear. After logging over a thousand hours in this game, over three years, I still don't know what a few of the stats mean.

While most of the dungeons are procedurally generated, some smaller zones are always the same and the overland map only varies based off a handful of bonus zones that require prerequisites to appear. This sameness of the larger world and the horrifically imbalanced and hazardous random patrols make travel between dungeons tedious. But this is a relatively small criticism since the overland travel isn't a large portion of gameplay.

If roguelikes are your bag, this one offers both a sense of progression from overall play by doling out new classes and races with unlocks, as well as a wide variety of enemies and all sorts of crazy loot. The difficulty spikes can be tremendous, so that the higher difficulties really demand use of the game's clairvoyance and/or movement powers to survive. This game seeded and fostered my imagination and provided all sorts of unusual combinations of gear, talents and events to keep my thoroughly entertained. Though I don't tend to play for long stretches any more (except with new DLC), I keep coming back for twenty or thirty minutes of play on whatever experiment of race and class that appeals to me at the time.

I can't think of any other game (except an MMO), that has had me coming back again and again for more than a couple months, let alone three years.",1457126061,1457169128,True,6,4,0.528872132301330566,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The maps are randomly generated, but that does not mean you will be playing the what has been known to be the now typical proceduraly generated roguelikes that seem to flood steam early access. The difference in the generation is pretty minimal in most cases, so if you were to die... you can easily jump back in.

The game is highly addictive, and as far as the gameplay speed/pacing goes... its pretty much left up to the player. If your clicking through the game at high speeds... the experience will still envelop you... but you will progress at an obnoxiously fast speed... probably dying a ton in the process; on the other hand, you can pace yourself... playing each situation with strategy; its essentially up to you.

Anyway, this is a good game with deep lore and a lot of different possibilities. It requires a lot of reading, thinking, and well thought out decisions. This is not the game you just jump into and start hacking stuff up. You can sort of do that on the easiest difficulty, but this isn't the game where that's fun since the combat is just moving into the other target. 

It's hard to explain what is good about this game, because I don't quite know. I do know I would recommend it to people, especially at 6.99 (I was lucky enough to get it for $1.74) because I am enjoying it a lot.

There are a few things that really stand out. The skill system is one of them. You can choose multiple skills, but you have a limited amount of skill points. Some really stand out, while others may seem underwhelming. Every single skill has a purpose in one way or another, and has a use.

The class system is another one. There are 10 races in the base game, all with different skills. You start with a small handful, and can unlock the others by playing the game. There are 26 classes with different playstyles in the regular game, 19 of those unlockable by playing the game as well. There's one ""bonus"" class that can get any skill from any tree in the game, and you unlock that one by beating the game once. DLC adds 5 more classes, and 4 different races to play as.

There's also little risk to trying this game out. There are some features only people who purchase the game get, but they are mostly cosmetic, and in one case it's a new class.

Nice to take your time and have monsters patiently wait for you to decide what to do.

As for cons, the biggest is balance, especially after mid-level (15+ or so). Initially the content matches your level, you're using all your skills, and there is plenty of challenge. But eventually you either go into areas that are way too low and have boring gameplay of ""press Z to autoexplore, smash things, health never goes below 99%"". Either that or you run into some random purple boss who 3-4 shots you. Or better yet a purple boss who is WAY higher level, like 35 when you're 15, and you have no chance.

キャラビルドの選択がとにかく大量で自分にあったのを見つけるまで大変
とはいえ初期状態では初心者向けの種族やクラスだけで他はアンロックしていく形
また最初に難易度だけでなく残機アリが設定できるのはありがたいですね
一発死には緊張感はありますがゲーム自体を投げる要因でもあるので

食料の概念どころか回復薬等の消耗品までないという思い切ったシステムで
すべてクールダウンのあるタレントに統一になってます
その反面タレントに必用なリソースはマナやスタミナといったおなじみのものから
憎悪や自然との調和や時空の歪みなどといったものまで多種にわたります
他のクラスのスキルを学ぶ事が出来てもリソース管理的に使いにくいとかあるわけです
アイテムもハクスラ感覚でドロップし選択に悩みいつかこれ使おうとか倉庫の肥やしになる
そんな楽しみ

実際のプレイとしての感覚（難易度nomal）では通常は即死におびえるいうこともなく
適当に散策したり敵に会ったりするまで高速で自動探索するモードで快適にプレイ可能
ただしレア敵やユニークやボスが桁違いに強いのでそこの立ち回りがポイントになります
敵の情報は完全に全部見る事が出来るのでやばいオーラ（比喩ではなく）には注意しましょう
前述の通りノーマルではさほど危険がないのでうっかり突っ込んで大ダメージ死亡とかよくあります

ストーリーやロールプレイ性はほぼありません
その代わり背景設定に関するテキストはかなり多く
自宅が手にはいると全キャラ共通で獲得したテキストが閲覧できるのが便利
種族や歴史に関する資料とかなかなか読み応えがあります
ハーフリングが帝国主義時代の欧州人みたいな覇権種族ってまずないよな…

独特のプレイ感や覚える要素の多さになじむまではかなり大変ではあると思います
戦闘でのダメージが単純な計算ではなくかなり多種な要素が入ってわかりにくいです
固定の敵やモブ敵は場数を積めば感覚的に対応もわかりますが
ランダムなレア敵はプレイヤーと同じようにキャラビルドが組まれているので
対応もそのキャラビルドに応じたタレントの特性を把握する必要があります
いきなり瀕死になってそのまま死んだログみても何されてるのかわからねえとかも…

ゲーム外のことですが本家サイトに登録してsteamと関連付けはやったほうがいいでしょう
頻繁にバージョンアップするので強制バージョンアップのsteamとはいささか相性が悪いです

困ったら見てみるといいでしょう

moving on to graphics and story. look, i know you've probably already looked at the screenshots and said, ""really?? ehhhhhhhh"" and that's fair. honestly though, they've really grown on me, and while a lot of it is ""generic fantasy"", so much of it isn't, and it subverts the genre in just the right places. the sprites and environments have had some nice work put into them, and despite looking like they're from 1996, they really bring a unique atmostphere to the game. the worldbuilding and music fit well with the visuals and add a lot to the immersion. the dialogue and found notes are all worth reading and give insight into the world, whether it's a small scrap of comic relief in a hectic dungeon or the detailed history of a faction bought from a bookseller. everything is  well-written (if a little... campy in places. not sure if that's the right word) and usually breaks up the pacing in the right places.

what will keep me coming back to this game tho (most likely for years to come) are the amazing moments you just can't find anywhere else in gaming. this aspect of the game is reminiscent of skyrim in a lot of ways. despite any flaws the game might have, there is nothing like coming out of a cave in skyrim and knowing an entire world is out there for you to explore. ToME is the same. there is nothing like the feeling of slowly suffocating to death under sand and knowing there's no one to blame for yourself. there is nothing like discovering what lies beneath Lake Nur for the first time. it's a game that lets your imagination run wild in a way ""prettier"" games can't.

tl;dr play this game. you'll probably get more hours out of the 10 bucks you pay for ToME + Ashes of Urh'Rok than you'll get out of the $120 you spent on the Witcher 3 and MGSV.",1453764540,1453764540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is hands-down my favorite game ever.

Before i begin: You can play the game for free by downloading it from te4.org (the official website).
Purchasing the Steam version will get you a few perks you would otherwise get by donating. (those aren't major, however the DLC is and is in my opinion definitely worth it)
So do test it first before buying and then buy it if you want to support the creator (mostly a single guy by the way).

Things that are great:

-It's in many parts a traditional roguelike (which I am a fan of), that means: turn-based combat, procedurally generated dungeons.

-It's in some parts more forgiving than traditional roguelikes: option to choose between permadeath, a limited number of lives or unlimited lives (while the last takes away from the fun imo), multiple difficulty settings (easier, which will not get you any achievements, normal, which is pretty hard, on to various degrees of insanity)

-the most interesting choice of classes i know from virtually anywhere: There are the classic Berserker, Archer, Archmage but also things like Mindslayer, Oozemancer, Brawler, Solipsist.

-Every class is played differently: due to completely different sets of skills and build possibilities, each class has its own unique playstyle.

-no grinding: all dungeons can only be cleared once, there are no respawning mobs. Additionally there are no consumables, these are replaced by ""inscriptions"" which are infinitely usable, but on a cooldown, meaning there is nothing you have to save up for a big bossfight, but you still have to think about when you use what in that fight.

-impressive gameworld: The sheer amount of lore there is for you to find is impressive. This is a point where it differs from many classic roguelikes: It has a main quest, a story, and lots of backstory, all of which I personally found to be interesting and engaging. The various dungeons feel interesting and different.

-it's challenging: You actually have to either think about what you are doing, or prepare to die a lot. You might die a lot even if you do until you figure some things out. To me that is a good thing, to others it might not be i guess, but that's what exploration mode (unlimited lives) is for: figuring stuff out.

-great community: Why is this important? While it is not a multiplayer game, there is an in game online chat. It shows character deaths and character achievements (this can be turned on/off) and can be used for chatting. This is extremely helpful for asking about things you might need to know, and in my experience the community will be more than happy to help.

The things you might not like:

-Graphics: This is a Tileset-based game. It doesnt feature great animations or anything like that apart from spell effects. If that is extremely off-putting to you, i'm sorry. As to the tileset itself, I like it, others might not.

-It may not be easy to get into: There are many stats to keep track of, sometimes making it hard to decide which items to take over others, the GUI is great in my opinion, but at the start it can take a bit to get used to it. So if you have any questions while playing: dont hesitate to ask in chat!

-it's challenging: see above

-If you are an achievement completionist, you might get into problems with this game. Just a warning.

All  in all, i very much recommend to try it.

Don't let the graphics fool you, the gameplay is incredibly deep with a large amount of races, classes, enemies, quests, skills, items and free choice. ToME is all about gameplay and less about graphics, kind of like Dwarf Fortress. Even the dialogue and lore (there is a lot to read if you so desire) is well-written and the world is interesting to explore and uncover its mysteries.

There are a lot of stats but they are all straightforward and easy to find. You will rarely be confused about what a certain stat does, and you don't even need to know about everything. You can dive in straight for some proper min-maxing or just play and learn as you go. I recommend to start with an easier, straightforward class like the Bulwark. Then later you can try out the more difficult to master classes with interesting names like the Oozemancer, Stone Warden or Paradox Mage. There is enormous build variety. You can unlock the more specialist classes, skill trees and even races just by playing the game. By spending some extra points you can even use skill trees that are not available to your class from the start. 

Battles are very engaging and for the more difficult fights you will have to think about your next turn. With plenty of skills and items available you can really think about your strategy. Or maybe you don't want to fight at all, there is no shame in running to come back later and finish that boss when you're stronger. The game appears to be very well balanced, which is a great achievement if you consider the enormous build variety.

The game is large, there are a lot of places to explore, the only problem i have with the world is that every new character has to pass through the same locations which can get a little boring if you die a lot (which you will). Luckily all maps are randomly generated and there are several game modes (infinite lives, multiple lives, 1 live), so you don't have to go all hardcore.

ToME was made for pure fun. You don't like mindlessly exploring empty maps for a single piece of loot or to find the exit? Just press the auto-explore button and skip all that nonsense. Your character will automatically explore and pick up everything until it sees an enemy. There is very little grinding just to get XP, almost everything you do is part of a quest or will lead to one. Are you overleveled? The game will ask you if you want to skip the whole area! If you manage to get far enough in to the game you will get your own flying fortress with a small shared stash that you can expand by donating more. There's also the (in-game!) Steam Workshop that contains a great many mods to make your life in ToME even more enjoyable. And an in-game chat with plenty of helpful and experienced players.

Do you like Steam Achievements? This game has 1395 of them!

Gameplay is as solid as other reviewers said. More beginner friendly among the major roguelikes, in my opinion. And it's addictive. For people like me who are not so good at planning one's own character, there are many class guides in the official forum, which is very helpful.

There is only one aspect that is not that great, that's its graphic tile. Oh, and music can grow old after long time of play.

To have a huge, randomized world to explore, hundreds of enemies to battle, nigh infinite loot to find, and dozens upon dozens of characters to try? There are more attempts at just such perfection now but few have reached the heights of Tales of Maj'Eyal in scope or depth. As long you can get past some balance and aesthetic hangups, you might get your wish in this one.

ToME, as I'm going to abbreviate it from here on, is a roguelike RPG of incredible scale. Right from character creation you have dozens of combinations of races and classes to choose from, with more to unlock as you explore the world. There's plenty of exploring to do across said massive world as well, what with the layout of the continents and dungeons randomized each time. Enemies and loot are even more randomized, scattered throughout in ways that encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of every level of every dungeon. There are towns to visit and NPCs to take quests from, and though the main story quest is the same every time your start and some elements later are determined by your race and your class.

Every time you start a new character you're in for a dramatically different adventure in fact, just as you would expect from a quality roguelike. Right from the basics there's a huge amount of variance between the classes. You have everything from different flavors of warriors and archers to exotic professions like chronomancers and abominations. Leveling up gains you new stat points to spend, skill points in two separate classes of skills, and occasionally the chance to learn entirely new skills. Coupled with the ridiculous amount of loot to find there's a lot of customizing to do, and dozens of skills to use on a single character between their class skills, racial skills learned skills, runes, infusions, and item-granted powers.

If all this sounds overwhelming, it really isn't because of how the game is played. ToME is turn-based at your pace, meaning things only happen when you move or attack. Attacking can be as simple as bumping into enemies to auto attack, or laying out combinations of skills over dozens of turns. And this is where the balance starts to become an issue, because for most fights you'll be doing the former. Most enemies in ToME are little more than filler, assuming you've been diligent in exploring and leveling. Despite the vast array of enemies to battle, many present little challenge. It's the rare unique enemies and ones with certain devastating abilities you have to watch out for, and in stark contrast with the rest of your foes these can end your life in one or two turns. Every single character I have lost has been to an unexpected boss or unique that wrecked me instantly after cleaving effortlessly through their minions.

To its credit, ToME has a wide assortment of difficulty settings, and the default level gives you several lives to experiment with before succumbing to permadeath. But it's a band-aid on a much deeper balance wound. Most of the adventuring in ToME presents so little challenge you can run on autopilot, until suddenly dying to the one thing in the room that poses a threat. This creates a strange whiplash effect between mounting boredom and sudden frustration. And the methods for overcoming a challenging boss won't always be clear thanks to the immense volume of stats and abilities that you normally don't have to keep much track of. Even after a dozen hours it can be hard for me to tell what my character is ready for.

The result is a game that's not too daunting to get into, but presents a real challenge to master. Every attempt is a long and gratifying series of small discoveries and victories before the inevitable end comes. There's plenty of unique items, new classes, and lore to uncover even if beating the game isn't in the cards. I still haven't come close to whatever the end is, but after 20 hours I'm still not tired of the meat grinder. Maybe I really can play this forever, and even if you can't, you'll get a lot of quality adventuring out of it.

A quick review of its pros/cons : 

+ amazing choice  of classes, each with a very different gameplay
+ 3 different game modes : story, arena, infinite dungeons (the last 2 are to unlock by playing the 1st)
+ 5 different difficulties, and 3 ways to play : exploration (infinite lives), adventure (finite number of lives), roguelike (1 life)
+ old-school graphics, slightly ""enhanced"", which usually do a wonderful job
+ nice background music, for the most part
+ very deep and smart system, with tons of modifiers, stats and talents to look after
+ you can play it as slowly or as fast as you want
+ playable with mouse only, keyboard only, or a mix of both, as you wish
+ functional and scalable UI
+ tons of lore if you're into reading ;)

- some graphic tiles are a little messy (thinking of the glittering caves, or whatever they're called, for example), making some dungeons a bit tough to ""read""
- the UI, while overall nice, could be better : overalapping texts, annoying popups, and item comparisons which are frequently a mess to analyse
- do NOT buy this game if you're looking for an easy 100% achievements :D There are 1395 achievements, most of them require to play at least 9 times, and they don't fall that easily, most of the time (case in point : I have 91 achievements after 67 hours of game time, lol). These obviously could have be done better, like for example automatically unlock lesser difficulties ones when you achieve one (what's the point of doing the same achievement on normal if you just got it on insane ?)
- a few crashes (mostly when starting a new game or loading one, strangely : I don't remember having a crash while in game)
- it is possible to get stuck : on my last infinite dungeons run, I ended up in a ""corner"" where the door disappeared (on purpose) and the walls were not diggable. As I had not found any teleportation means yet, my only option was to suicide (target my talents at myself). If it was on ""roguelike"" mode, it would have been a game over.

You can get hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of playtime with this game, if it appeals to you, without ever being bored. Personnally, I'm a bit burnt out after nearly 70h, but I'll probably come back to it later, if I ever find the time.

Other than that, this is a great roguelike. It is class based so there are some choice moments when you really wish you could use that awesome item you found, but that's true of most of the genre. Most of what I've seen has been that good choices and skill synergy trumps RNG drops.

Starting out, your choices are pretty limited. You need to fulfill certain requirements to unlock additional races and classes. Thankfully, these conditions aren't hard to fulfill and will (mostly) naturally happen as you progress through the game.

- Атмосфера. Хорошо проработанный фентезийный мир с тоннами текста. Приготовьте свой английский.
- Разнообразие рас и классов - куча скиллов и их комбинаций.
- Три режима - Роуглайк, Адвенчур и Эксплорейшен. Первый для хардкорных ребят - смерть означает [b]смерть[/b], т.е. потерю всего.

It has a huge amount of depth, and a wide variety of viable playstyles at different difficulty levels.

There are also some convenient QOL features like autoexplore and everything being on cooldowns instead of consumables means you can focus on combat rather than carefully hoarding mana/stamina/equilibrium/health pots.

It's a shame this game only has 27 (even if all of them are positive) reviews.

Folks this game is great! The base version of this game is free and may help you to determine wether or not this game is for you.

My first experiences with this game were kinda ""meh"" not because the game is bad but just because i felt like it was hard to get into (that might be a personal thing tho). I made a big mistake by shoving it to the side for a while thinking this game wasnt for me. In a phase of boredom i picked this game up again and used my time to get into it and hell - I'm fascinated. i litteraly can't stop playing - this game has so much depth and so much to give for such a little price it's just wow.

Darkgod is the prime example for a good game developer - give it for free and let the people choose wether or not to pay for it. I feel bad now for picking this gem up when it was on sale and i only payed about 70c so i donated another 5 Euro for now just because the game is so great (i'll probably donate even more just because i won't stop playing this game aslong as things are beeing developed for it)


Enough for the story telling now lets get to the raw information:


Pro's:

Great story: you got ALOT of texts to read for background information about races , the past events , demons , long lost civilizations etc etc etc. if you realy want to you can get ALOT of information.

Gameplay: AMAZING - the game has so much depth telling you all about it would fill about 100's of sites so just go find out yourself you realy won't be disappointed. trust me on this.
Roguelike typical RNG
tons and tons and tons of randomly generated equipment aswell as our all beloved legendary equipment which stays the same.
Brilliant skills and spells which would also be too much to talk about in detail right here.

Graphics: Lovely oldschoolish graphics (i know it's not for everyone but for me personaly it's great.)

Active developer: Darkgod is always working on this game , hell he even shows up online regulary and starts random events for everyone thats playing in that moment ( this can be Zones , small buffs , useless but funny buffs or even other things which i'm not gonna mention.

Online community ingame: Okay now this one is great and probably my most favorite function in this game - even tho this is a singleplayer game it has an online function which is basicaly just a chat where you can link items , talk to people , see what other people do (deaths,archievements etc). This is especialy helpfull when starting out because the community is great and always helpfull (hey Xlambda , minmay etc :D). When you're more experienced it's still helpfull for lets say Item comparsion or just simple chatting while playing along.


Cons: A little hard to get into but as i said above that might just be me personally and yet it's not that hard just takes a little bit of time and dedication. 

Thats about it.


I give this game a 10/10 on my personal scale - im TOTALY in love with it and 'am planing to play it for a LONG time.

The Good:

It is massive.  There's lots of classes, areas, items, and spells, and things to do.  Very little feels redundant or samey.

Unlike most Roguelikes, there is a plot.

As claimed, there is indeed no need to grind.

Permadeath can be turned off with no penalty.  This partially makes up for many of the bad aspects of the game.


The Bad:

Tales of Maj'Eyal is a true Roguelike.  Most of its flaws are common to most members of the genre.

Like most Roguelikes, there are horrendous balance problems.  You will frequently encounter creatures of widely varying levels in the same area.  Some of these enemies move so fast, and hit so hard, just seeing them on your screen almost guarantees death.  If you have permadeath on, and aren't a masochist, you're going to have a bad time.

Turning permadeath off doesn't completely solve the balance problems.  It also just feels bad.  Resurrecting where you were, with full hit points and no negative statuses, with the enemies as you left them, results in you either being deathlocked or overpowered.  I would rather it have saved every 5 minutes, then load the save from 5 minutes ago when I die.  That would both feel fairer, and prevent the deathlock problem.  Being able to willingly back up further (lose more progress) would be even better insurance against being deathlocked.

Like most Roguelikes, there are terrible guidance problems.  In most Roguelikes this is due to there being no guidance at all.  While Tales of Maj'Eyal has problems with [i]insufficient[/i] guidance, it does have some guidance, due to the main quest and side quests directing you to the ‘next’ areas.  However, sometimes you encounter strange interactive widgets and need to decide what, if anything, to do with them.  There is no guidance here, and if you do the wrong thing the results are often lethal.  Tales of Maj'Eyal has somewhat unique problems with [i]malicious[/i] guidance.  The main and side quests will frequently send you to places without any hint that you better purchase some items or allocate points in some abilities to counteract the next boss' game-breaking abilities, or simply lead you to locations full of enemies far beyond your level.  If you're going to play this, save yourself some frustration and just look everything that should have been in the game up on a wiki.

You will occasionally encounter wandering friendly characters.  They always need to be safely escorted out of the area.  There should be more variety in what they want from you.


The Ugly:

A few people are complaining about the graphics.  Traditionally Roguelikes didn't [i]have[/i] graphics (or sound).  Everything was represented with text characters and you had to learn to read the screen (e.g. @ is the player character).  You could usually select a location on the screen for a more detailed explanation.  While many of us enjoyed using our imagination, it did prevent Roguelikes from being popular with the masses.  The few that have graphics now often adopted them due to running out of ASCII characters to represent things with, before Unicode support was widespread and good monospaced Unicode fonts were available.  So it's a matter of perspective whether Tales of Maj'Eyal has good or bad graphics.",1448192065,1448192669,True,6,0,0.56336665153503418,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is quite punishing, but not oppressively so like Dungeon Crawl.  There is a steep learning curve, your first adventure, or first few dozen adventures will probably not yield you anything game-wise, but you will learn.  Playing around a little bit, you will start seeing synergies with how the different skills for the classes interact with each other, and then start building yourself a truly powerful character.

For me, nothing feels better than having your ass handed to you by the game repeatedly, and then, figuring out the class you're trying to do, and waltzing through the end-game content like a seasoned veteran...because you are!  You will learn the strategies, understand the tactics, shape your reactions to the situations appropriately, and you will conquer!  You will earn your end-game god-like status not by farming, or investing time at the expense of brainpower, you will earn it through sweat and, sometimes, tears of frustration, but you absolutely will earn it, and when you deal that final blow, you will feel like you truly accomplished something great...

...and then you will start the process over again, learning a new class!

Pros-
          Deep class options, a min/maxers dream.
          High replayability due to not all classes being available from the outset (must be unlocked) as well as many different ways to approach situations.
          Story is decent enough, if you're into reading and lore this game has it.

The first tag is ""Rogue-like"", the second is ""RPG"". This is not a traditional ""learn as you go on a mighty quest"" kind of RPG game, it is a rougue-like. You will learn as you die. You have one life (or multiple on Adventure mode) and will thus have to be tactical and smart with the decisions you make.

Now, getting with the review, this is a fantastic game that i highly recommend you try if you are a ROGUE-LIKE fan, not a traditional RPG fan. The game doesn't bring miscellaneous lose conditions to discourage and hinder you like other games in the genre (Damn hunger meters). This is not to say that the game is a cakewalk, rather it is far from it. The game expects you to die and to learn from it, take the time to analyze why you took 30% of your health in one shot, check the game log, inspect enemy monsters before you rush in so you can take them on effectively.

The game has excellent replayability, due to the diversity of races and classes as well as random dungeons and alternate layouts. Different races and classes also start in different areas and have slightly differing dungeons available, allowing for even more content that you may have not known was there in the first place. This, along with random loot that can have a wide variety of effects leads to the player enjoying exploring the world and tackling rare monsters.

Even more content can be unlocked with the Arena and Infinite modes that can be obtained once you get to a certain point in the Campaign (both are fairly early). Arena mode lets you pick a race and class and lets you test your skill against a 30 or 60 wave gauntlet. Infinite places you in an infinite dungeon where you explore and try to survive for as long as you can.

Overall, this game is a fun challenge for anyone who has the patience to see when to run and when to fight as well as the ability to say ""I just spent 10 hours on a character and he/she died. That's fine, let's see where we went wrong and try again."" And for those who read the negative reviews and saw ""i ran into a wall of lvl 20 guys at lvl 1, game is unbalaced"", they ran into a event (which you can avoid and come back to later) where you open a locked door and fight high leveled enemies for better loot. It's a high risk high reward area, and if you don't think you can do it, don't.

TLDR: If you have the patience to realise you made a mistake and analyze it, and you enjoy rougue-likes, this is a good game. You will die, a lot. This is part of the game. It is wonderful and has replayability like no other. Also, don't open sealed doors unless you are ready to fight high level guys who will kill you if you don't know what you're doing.",1446240115,1479959679,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Fun, deep, and difficult. Not the type of difficult that enrages or frustrates; ToME is the type of difficult that makes playing interesting but tense.

No, but ToME has it's own aesthetic that harkens back to the golden age of video RPGs and the underpinning design is fresh, but still true to it's roots. This, in itself makes it a unique game here on Steam. Not hip. Not genre-BREAKING, but genre-DEFINING. A BIG game but a welcoming one.

ToME is more a constantly evolving tactical adventure game that has a wealth of randomly generated content, but it is random in a DIRECTED way; random with a purpose and a logic. 

Despite the huge amount of classes, skills, equipment, and creatures, ToME is accessible in ways that many other rogue-like games are not. It's a strange beast that rewards the hardcore and the casual rogue-adventuring fan.

If you enjoy adventuring and the possibilities contained in each new area explored, each new creature slain and each new tentacle tree messed with, then buy this game. It's community-driven labor of love and if you give it a bit of your time it will pay you back in spades.

I am going to say this first - if you like roguelikes, you will certainly like ToME.

The graphics of course do not compare to the AA titles, but I think they are by no means bad looking, and the extremely enjoyable gameplay more than makes up for it. The replay value is amazing as well as the progression (unlocking new classes as you go, so you are not overwhelmed by the choices at first), the UI makes it easy to learn the game mechanics (hovering over the stats etc). And the lead developer listening to and interacting with the people of course adds a nice touch.

Yes, the game is punishing, but that makes the rewards all the richer.

Personally i'd put gameplay above graphics 100% of the time and this game fits that bill for sure, but don't be fooled into thinking that only adequate graphics means poor gameplay. In this case, it does not. Far from it. You really really have to think about how/where to progress otherwise that bright light at the end of the tunnel races forward and envelops you. Again :).

The only tip i'd give to people is to check, upon entering a certain area, what your charactor thinks about it before going even one step further. If your charactor is crapping his/her self then leave! You get a one-liner when you enter that tells you.

The popular user-defined steam tags for this game are 100% spot on.

Don't let the game title or graphics put you off. I think the title is too silly for a game this good.

Don't listen to people who say this game is too hard -- there's multiple difficulty levels and modes -- one of the modes makes it just like Diablo 1 in terms of difficulty (exploration mode).


Exploration mode -- there's no fail state (think of the Diablo series).  It literally can't be too hard in this mode.
Adventure mode  -- The perfect compromise.  You start with one life, and get a handful more as you level.  Death still sucks, but it's not too bad.  When you die, the game is telling you to Get Good -- It's not just because you didn't pray to RNGesus enough.  I think the game is balance tuned to this mode for normal human beings.
Roguelike -- One life.  It's Ironman mode in a game balanced for multiple lives -- without the ability to grind in increase survivability (think Diablo).  So, you need a _very deep_ understanding of the game mechanics to succeed in this mode.  Like, looking at the code deep -- or at least benefiting from the knowledge of others who have, in some way.  Not that the game is totally unfair.  It's pretty damn fair.  But there are things in this game that will most likely result in your death if you're unprepared, and there's no way to know to prepare for them without having encountered it before.  In many cases, you do get very good hints about this through the ingame Lore/Story bits you find -- but not always.  That's my impression, anyways.  

The above modes are on top of additional difficulty settings, so it's rather fine-tunable (I started playing on Normal-Adventurer, and I'm still playing in that mode at 100 hours /played -- and I haven't beaten the game yet).


High points as I think of them:

Gameplay is amazing.  
Itemization is top-notch.  
Class ability balance is pretty damn good -- most games I feel like I'm beta testing class balance, but not here.
There's an actual story, and there are immersive pieces of lore that you find that are well-written.
Extremely moddable, but not in a ""bad"" way like some games where you'd need to spend 100's of hours modding before you start playing (I'm looking at you, Fallout 3 and Skyrim.  Morrowind would be in the same boat, but it gets a pass from me because that game has style).
Loving the Z key.
Escort missions are brilliant.
The Devs removed the grind for consumables -- which is one of the major departures from classic rogue games.
The Rogue class is fun as hell for me.
You can tell that the Devs are true gamers -- what is optimal is also often enough the most fun way to play.  I get the impression that this is not merely serendipitous.
After/If you beat the game, you can take your character into a true infinite dungeon to see how far you get.  That sounds pretty awesome, even though I haven't done it yet.
Helpful ingame chat (you can link items into it, and there's an ingame browser).

The only downside is the graphics.  They could be better, and with how moddable the game is, I'm actually pretty surprised it's not already.  There's a certain amount of charm to them, but it's not like Fallout 1 level charm -- but then again the only game that comes close to that (or exceeds in some aspects) is Diablo 2, so I'm being a bit unfair.  There is a DLC for like $1 that does improve the UI graphics some, and I think it's worth getting.

I could improve the graphics substantially and release it as a mod, but I'm too busy playing -- it's that good.  Mayber everyone feels the same way.

Get this game because it's great.  
Get the DLCs to support the Devs

I'd rate this 9.9/10 if the price was irrelevant.  At its current price, it's an honest 11/10 ((before you say anything: YES I know).

There's still some constructive criticism to go around, but also a lot of good features.  Each ability tree has a lot of active abilities and not many passive ones, and often refuses to unlock a new ability until you have the previous one on the tree -- and many items have abilities you can activate too.  Your interface quickly gets overwhelmed with dozens of options on various cooldowns.  That said, all of the abilities are pretty cool and effective.  I recommend starting as some variation on fighter, then trying the rogue.  The game's also not completely sure if it wants to be controlled by keyboard or mouse, and both options suffer a bit for it, especially ranged characters.  It plays like an uneasy compromise.

Cool feature two, there's a lot less early-game repetition than most roguelikes.  There's a good handful of different start scenarios, each with two starter dungeons -- then everything comes together for a set of four storyline dungeons (which all have alternate versions) you can do in any order, followed by another set of four, and then what looks like a set of two or three-ish.  It's a good middleground, especially with all of the unrelated side-content that you can find with a little exploration - that varies from game to game, so it's Still exploration.  That said, some events trigger dialogue/cutscenes FAR before you are ready to face the associated quests.  Expect to die a Lot if you don't compulsively grind XP and doublecheck the level ranges on zones on your map.

Three, I really like unlocking new race/class combos, and having some things be gated to certain classes.  The setting is decently unique without falling too far into ""My Orcs Are Different"" or ""Generic fantasy pastiche #2"", and takes inspiration from warcraft, elder scrolls, dnd, and others.  Each lore snippet varies quite a bit in length.  I read a lot more of them than I'd entirely meant to, because I kept finding very very short ones right after a long one had tired me out.


[Edit 2, 2023]
Giving this game a third try, and it still seems to be going strong after a few more years!   The interface is still a little bit hectic and hard to parse, but there's a lot of intriguing gameplay in there if you look, and I've successfully made it out of the first few dungeons without getting stuck or frustrated.

I think I'd enjoy less focus on pretty decorative UI, and more focus on instantly-clear info readouts.  But I also swapped it to ascii mode on purpose (which is a thing you can do, that both works and helps) - your mileage may vary.  Also, all of the bugs/complaints from my previous reviews seem to have been corrected, it fits on my screen no problem and I can resize things and turn off online features.

Changing this to a big thumbs up. The game needed a little longer to cook out of the alpha stage, and it's solidly getting there.  The modding community also has some quality of life and interface mods that I'm looking into now.  Very nice!




[Edit 1, late twenty-teens]

Gave this another try after a year or two.  The interface is better, but still rough, and nothing from the previous review has changed.  Highlights this time include..
- You can change the size the quick access buttons display at, but their hitboxes stay at 48x48 so you might want to stick to that setting.
- The online chat window sometimes displays over the ingame message box, and you can't turn one off without turning off the other.  I hope you either have a good memory or like hearing about complete strangers' achievement progress as much as you like knowing whether or not your attack hit.

It still feels like there's something compelling hidden underneath.  I managed to play long enough to beat the first level this time, before getting frustrated.  The playerbase / game devs still seem active and healthy.  Will try again in a few years.



[Original review follows, mid twenty-teens]

The UI / gameplay aren't as crisp and polished as I've come to expect in a roguelike -- an example, changing the ""resolution"" changes window size and nothing else, including the size of menus larger than your chosen resolution.  I think that once I pierce the learning curve there will be a good turnbased strategy game in here, but with nethack's semirandom difficulty curve, and having to unlock character types.

This game has the potential to become a lot of things, but it feels like early access to me.

这个游戏可能会有很多人向你推荐，他们会细数游戏的各种好的方面，自由的世界，庞大的数据量，随机的地城，可以玩到天荒地老的游戏长度，以及看一眼就很有挑战性的成就数量。
但是请想明白，这些是很好的，可这是不是你想要的？
TOME尝试将roguelike推广到所有人群中，漂亮的界面（似乎有人在高呼ASCII的美妙谁人能懂？），方便的MOD系统，“有限随机性”，和软模式（这个太好了）。这些都是很好的，这是真的好，对每个人都好的方面。
不过实际上这个游戏仍然不会适合每一个人，他需要大量重复的游戏时间，即便你不选择核心模式。每次角色死亡后都给人非常沉重的打击，这种打击在该角色游戏时间越长越是明显，有的人能享受这种不可逆进程带来的快感并且快速投入新的冒险中，有的人却会明显消耗掉游戏热情。所以开始玩时请选择软模式！
还有一点是基于角色死亡这种情况产生的问题，其实是源于上一个问题，游戏的开局角色是有限的（mod？），特别是初期，每一个角色的数据积累过程在初期时是几乎无法选择的，如果新手在初期频繁死亡，就会遇到这样的情况——重复的开局，重复的开局，重复的开局。这种有限随机本来是保护新玩家的措施，可这很可能对新玩家的游戏热情有巨大的杀伤。
我玩free版本有一段时间（大概是很短的时间，嗯），深刻的感受到（非抖M）新玩家的艰难。不希望大家将这样一个优秀的游戏买来只是+1。
在有人对任何游戏发表弃坑宣言的时候可能都有有人这样对他说：静下心来，认真的玩下去，你就会发现它真的是很好的。对于TOME也只能如此。真是无奈啊。",1444275552,1444275552,True,7,1,0.601092219352722168,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You can never get tired of the various builds TOME4 can offer even if you have limited interest in build types. Watch your hero grow to be the ultimate awesomeness is a great pleasure for me.
Combat in this game is the best I've seen in all games, the more skilled you are, the more fun you'll get(in higher difficulties of course). In many games, when you achieve ""mastery"" everything just becomes a cakewalk. This is never the case in TOME4. You get cocky and you die. 

TOME4 is so focus on combat that it DOES NOT have many traditional RPG/roguelike elements such as hunger, tireness, thirst, consumables... You can actually feel that every mechanism in it is born for battle(except some aesthetics options). This is good for TOME4 because adding these will only undermine what TOME4 already have.
(Unrelated: Non-combat focused roguelikes can be really good as well, have you tried elona? If you ignore the male chauvinism filled in that game, it is magnificent.)

[h1]Constantly updating[/h1]
It has an ancient history(In the field of computer games) and it is still updating. Major, huge updates including new classes/races/skills/graphics/mechanisms. 

[h1]Online features(can be disabled)[/h1]
It offers in-game chat with other players. if you visit the main website you can also check your many characters' details. You can discard them all if you don't want them and that will not affect your gameplay in any way, the only problem is that you won't be able to exchange items stored online between your characters.

[h1]Friendly to beginners[/h1]
It offers a good tutorial and most of the stuff stay locked until you progress. You won't be overwhelmed by information if you are not prepared. 

[h1]Active player community[/h1]
The forum and wiki are quite useful and TOME4 have tons of mods developed by the players. You can get them easily in the workshops.

[h1]Darkgod is Smart[/h1]
The developer of this game, Darkgod, is extremely smart. The game mechanisms are so well developed that there's no grinding/taking advantage of AI/boredem in late game. Expect a difficult challenge in early game and expect it to be more difficult in late game as well. 

[h1]Darkgod is Kind[/h1]
You can play this game for free if you download it from the official website. 
If you pay for the game and DLC you can get many customizable aesthetic options/exchange items between characters/new classes etc. The price is ridiculously cheap as well. Darkgod also accepts additional donations in the game's official website.

后期难度大得吐血
数不胜数

优点却很简单

那就是，它好玩到足以让人无视他的所有缺点。

我更愿意称这游戏为：魔幻踢门战术模拟系统。

如果你喜欢Roguelike RPG，那不用说了，绝对是必入的。

如果你喜欢明知山有虎偏向虎山行，向高难度挑战，甚至认为制作人你不虐我就是我儿子，那这就是你要的菜。

如果你只是个普通RPG玩家，本游戏又名《论我的10000种死法》。看着办吧。

The game is tileset turn base with mouse support. Its looks old but has a lot of modern elements added on.

So many choices and so many ways you will die... but fear not as there are a few game modes ranging from infinite lives to true roguelike. Easy to play but its got a really robust mechanic system. Also has modding support. Tons of gear, tons of weapons, tons of monsters, tons of areas, tons of lore, and a stupidly high number of race/classes (of which u get to choose how they level and play via skills and perks and the RNG gear)

Oh ya and no grinding. Once u clear a floor or whole dungeon its cleared for good. I think new hostiles can spawn on the overworld map though like hostile patrols, though not 100% sure.

I should mention the game is 100% free (aside from the DLC) at te4.org though its made and maintsianed by 1 dude so worth it to buy it if you like it. And u can connect online to play but you won't see anyone as you are more or less just uploading your data and sometimes u might be playing and recieve a special world event because u were lucky to be logged in when it started :)

Pozwala to komunikować się z innymi graczami (wliczając w to administratorów/programistów gry czy też samego twórcę - DarkGod'a), a samo połączenie z serwerem gry umożliwia uczestnictwo w ""eventach"" uruchamianych przez DarkGod'a - zwykle są to dodatkowe lokalizacje ze specyficznym rodzajem przeciwników i zabawnymi nagrodami (umiejętność zamiany w królika robi swoje). Miłym smaczkiem jest otrzymywanie komunikatów o tym że ktoś otrzymał dany achievement po raz pierwszy czy też gdy ktoś ginie (przynajmniej wiemy że nie jesteśmy sami w tej niedoli).
Wspomniane tryby gry to: zwykła ""kampania"" (główny tryb gry), arena (walka z kolejnymi falami przeciwników) oraz Infinite Dungeon (jak sama nazwa wskazuje - niekończące się lochy - kończą się dopiero śmiercią postaci). 
Tryby śmierci to wspomniane exploration mode (można ginąć ile się chce, jednakże warto zaznaczyć że przeciwnicy nie znikają, tylko dla dwóch pierwszych poziomów trudności dla achievementów) Adventure (pewa limitowana ilość ""żyć"" zwiększająca się wraz z poziomami, gdy się kończą - postać ginie już na zawsze) oraz Roguelike - śmierć jest permanentna (prócz możliwości zdobycia kolejnych szans z pomocą specyficznych przedmiotów... ale to już inna sprawa). 
Ostatnią opcją jest poziom trudności - easier (brak achievementów, ułatwiona gra do granic możliwości), normal (bez ułatwień czy też utrudnień) Nightmare (trudniej, mocniejsze potwory etc.)  Insane (przeciwnicy znacznie silniejsi od bohatera) oraz Madness (totalne szaleństwo pod względem poziomu trudności i tego jak łatwo zginąć).
Sama rozgrywka to turowy RPG z masą różnych talentów w których można się wprost pogubić, różnymi dodatkowymi mocami, różnymi ich źródłami oraz losowym łupem... który to jest chyba jedyną wadą (czy też zaletą, zależy jak na to spojrzeć) tej gry. Otwartość świata (można nawet od razu wyjść z pierwszej strefy w której się pojawiamy prosto na główną mapę świata) modularność (dość spora baza możliwych modów tworzonych przez graczy) oraz początkowo uczucie zagubienia (gdzie iść? co robić?) potrafi przytłoczyć, jednak warto grze dać szansę jeśli lubi się tego typu klimaty. Sam dopiero po około 60-70 godzinach gry załapałem jak w miarę porządnie grać (to i tak nic w porównaniu do 120-150 godzin w Path of Exile) a i tak nie czuję się na siłach by spróbować przejść grę na Nightmare(Adventure/Rogulike).
Ta gra nie wybacza błędów (zarówno pod względem wybranego ekwipunku jak i pozycjonowania postaci czy też użytych run/inskrypcji posiadanych przez naszego bohatera) co frustruje, ale zmusza do refleksji - czy rzeczywiście była to wina gry że zginąłem? A może mogłem tego uniknąć? A może nie powinienem w ogóle tutaj wchodzić bo jestem za słaby na daną lokalizację?
Moim skromnym zdaniem jest to jeden z najlepszych roguelike'ów który można znaleźć. Wymagający, o jasnej mechanice (wszystkie informacje dotyczące postaci są klarownie opisane, sporo jest też dostępne na wiki) i świetnej społeczności z którą można się komunikować.

Pros:
- Wide variety of classes that play dramatically differently.
- Classes are fairly well-balanced, although some are considerably more complex and require more careful play than others.
- Lots of loot, and items can have a wide variety of buffs or even debuffs.
- Mod support.
- The game is long.
- Decent default tileset, and many more available in the workshop.
- Transparent numbers for the most part, so careful planning is possible.

Cons:
- Death is frequent and often feels random.  Because of the wide variety of abilities, status effects, and damage types, it is very difficult to build a character that can effectively defend against being one-shotted.  It's not fun to see a boss and instantly die.  There are also far too many ways to be stunlocked.
- There's no way to grind experience or equipment.  There is a fixed amount in the world and you get what you get.  Resistances are key and largely only come from equipment.  Gold is very limited, so despite the plethora of shops it is very rare to be able to afford anything useful.
- Some of the class mechanics are very complex and not well explained.  Or explained at all.  I'm looking at you, chronomancer.
- Some classes are very equipment-dependent, which means if you don't get the right artifact drops you cannot play effectively.
- The game is easy for the first couple hours and then it suddenly spikes towards the end of the second tier of dungeons.

TOME streamlines some things while keeping true to the formula of old school games like Nethack, ADOM, and Brogue. There's a free version that's basically the same as the paid version - you can download it from the TOME website if you're not sure you want to buy this yet.

TOME has automatic identification. You also get an item called a transmogrification chest, which basically cashes out your loot while you're still in the dungeon - reducing the risk of overencumbrance or loot saturation. TOME also has a modern engine and tileset, although the tileset is rather ugly. Most importantly for new players, there are five difficulty settings and three permadeath settings. The permadeath settings are especially useful, because they provide the option to 1) explore with unlimited lives, 2) play the game as intended, but with limited lives, and 3) play with permadeath like a true roguelike.

While it has convenience features, TOME is still an old school roguelike. Beating it without spoilers is a large undertaking, although not as difficult as Nethack. The different dungeons/areas are all different types of difficulty and as a level one character you might wander into a powerful monster's lair and get immediately annihilated. This is the kind of game where you'll need a wiki open most of the time if you're not a masochist.

TOME is also very feature-complete. Not only is there a standard story/open-world mode, but there is also an arena and endless dungeon. The Steam Workshop opens up modding opportunities. There is a huge amount of lore (my estimate so far is at least the length of a full book). There are lots of classes, many of which only become avaiable to you once you've reached a certain point in the game, which ensures there's always something fresh. It has over a thousand achievements, which is the highest out of any game on Steam (when it first came out Steam couldn't even handle it, the devs had to work with Valve for a few weeks to get them working properly).

One thing that really spices up the game for me is the ability to play as anti-magic. There's a faction in the world of TOME that is violently opposed to arcane magic. You can join them as long as you don't use any arcane magical items or cast spells. It's not as much of a challenge as it seems because there are non-arcane ""natural"" enchantments too, so anti-magic is a valid choice for story, roleplaying, or gameplay variation. It makes melee classes quite a bit more interesting and immersive.

Well, this game is a prime example of looks not having to tell anything about the value of a game.
Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is a turn based RPG with many roguelike features. Overall, the story isn't relevant (although there is a lot of lore to read). It rather concentrates on fighting, looting, and leveling.
Instead of writing an in-depth review here are the apects that I like the most about it:

[b]Classes[/b]
ToME has a whole lot of classes to offer. Sure, there are the archetypes like Warrior or Archer. However, you will also find many crazy and interesting classes. Examples for this are the Paradox Mage who controls time, the Oozemancer who draws his powers from oozes and slime, and the Wyrmic who uses the powers of the dragons.

[b]No One-Trick Ponies[/b]
Most skills (called ""Talents"") in the game have cooldowns. IMO this is great because it makes concentrating on one or a couple of talents an irrelevant strategy. Just the amount of talents in the game is staggering. In addition, many talents of a class allow for synergies. Also, you have to be well prepared for a number of different situations.
The cooldowns make combat so much more interesting. It is always a good idea to carefully consider using which talent in which situation. Just nuked a standard enemy with your most powerful spell? Well, you won't have it available for the next 20 turns.

[b]Special Enemies[/b]
Some enemies can have the talents of one (or even multiple!) of the classes available to the player. This will put you repeatedly in extremely dangerous but also very interesting situations.

[b]Loot[/b]
The game offers tons of randomly generated loot. The items can vary in their stats heavily and may change your playstyle a lot. There are also items with predefined properties (called artifacts).
Hovering over an item shows a very detailed description (same with talents).

I highly recommend ToME.
Btw, you can even legally get the game for free. Buying it on Steam will unlock a number of donator bonuses which are honestly dispensable. Did I regret my purchase, though? Not at all! The game is well worth the asking price and I am happy that I could support the dev a bit.",1437066988,1437067426,True,2,0,0.525767147541046143,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Longer version:  Tales of Maj'Eyal is a nicely balanced turn based roguelike set in a well written world filled with lore.  The graphics are nice and simple, with many similar roguelikes using ASCII instead.  There is a nice selection of classes and races with a large amount of unlockable classes that all have interesting differences to set them apart.  For 2 examples, you could be a defensive tank with the bulwark class, or an alchemist, lobbing magic infused gems as explosives while your golem protects you.
Another nice detail is the differentiation between arcane, nature and psionic abilities, including the presence of items ""Infused by arcane disrupting forces"", which can mess with any arcane abilities.  And what roguelike would be complete without randomly generated gear, with a nice amount of pre-generated artifacts(with written lore/descriptions) to add to the mix.
  Lastly, this game also has a good selection of difficulty level, with normal, easier and nightmare unlocked by default, along with the for exploration mode, adventurer mode or roguelike mode.  As the names might suggest, the roguelike mode is permadeath, with a rare few exceptions, while adventurer mode gives you a couple lives, along with a few more as you reach the higher levels, though enemies do fully reheal if you respawn.

There is also so much Lore hidden around the game. Either from completing quests, slaying unique entities, finding documents, or reading wall and statue inscriptions one can discover all a manner of things about the world, its inhabitants, cultures, races, monsters, relics, and more!
Finally, all the unique particle effects for the spells, and all the new unique effects on the HUD, add a bit of insight to a world you would otherwise rely solely on text and figurines to understand what is going on. Things turn darker when you are influenced by an effect that decreases sight range, things blur if your stunned, dazed, and such, the screen tinges a different color based on whether you are bleeding, frozen solid, standing in fire, poison muck, or acid... this is highly useful since you'll need to resolve effects, some of which you might not realize your under the effect of without of this.

Have you ever play Angband? Nethack? Roguelikes? Old cRPGs?
Tales of Maj'Eyal could something you are looking for.

ToME offers a wonderfully diverse cast of races/classes and various difficulties to play on, providing high replayability.
Each race/class provides a unique assortment of skills and abilities talents that are all chosen as you progress and level-up through out the game, allowing you to effectively be in control of the strength and development of your character.

The graphics are very remenant of old-school rpg gaming with some new polish added in.
I find the style of graphics and presentation to be one of the endearing and strong aspects of ToME.
the simple gaming feel with a complex system in root, where your success is uniquely determined by your choices, actions, and strategies.

As a roguelike at its heart, death in game is no stranger.  Sometimes it comes a bit quickly and unexpectedly.
Other times you can see your mistakes play out and see where things could have gone better.
Death is a natural course of the gameplay, but each subsequent playthrough provides an opportunity to hone your tactics or knowledge to help your next character out.
You are rewarded for learning from mistakes and improving your strategies, I feel this is one of the defining strengths for ToME.
You can however play with extra lives if perma-death is a bit daunting =)

The asking price of $6.99 is extremely generous in my book, as i have spent ten times more money for AAA games and have often played them a fraction of the time that i have spent on ToME.

I would personally recommend the roguelike difficulty for fans of the sub-genre as this is how i initially delved into and enjoyed the game but if permadeath leaves you squeamish there are alernative game modes which will allow you to learn the game without losing a character after a single death.

Имеющий зачатки сюжета, только кому он нужен после 50-100 и более смертей, что далеко не предел (особенно если играть в режиме roguelike + hardcore и выше сложности).

Особенности:
- Большая реиграбельность - множество классов и комбинаций а так же стратегий прокачки. 

- Упрощенная и даже местами ""не очень"" рисовка - с одной стороны это отпугивает огромное количество игроков, с другой визуально не перегружает восприятие от чего нет большей утомляемости от игры и она любезно предоставляет возможность самому додумывать как оно на самом деле происходит. Врываетесь ли вы с двуручным проклятым топором испускающим снопы молний в толпу ледяных гигантов, отрубая им ноги и заставляя их ползать по земле и плакать как детей или же пафосно стоите глядя на медленно летящие ледышки в вашу сторону и спокойно кастуете нечто вроде огненного шторма добавляя к этому какой нибудь скромненький луч смерти, дело только за вами.

- Увеличенная или как выразился один из игроков ""тупая сложность"" - игра где вы можете начать и после первого шага тут же умереть. Что заставляет соблюдать предельную осторожность и затачивать тактику под выживание. А значит вы не сможете наплевательско относиться к своему персонажу иначе постоянная смерть вам обеспечена. Сложность которая в современных играх как редкое явление, в Талесе данность.

- Оригинальные концепции врагов и уровней - несмотря на обилие клише врагов среди них есть много интересных и неожиданных.
Среди карт так же есть интересные находки, вроде постоянно меняющегося карты с песчаными червями где нужно бежать за червями по постоянно осыпающемуся коридору и успевать драться в маленьких пещерках. Другой пример, летающие острова между которыми нужно использовать телепортацию и сами острова дрейфуют. 

- Изобилие лута - для любителей собирательства, имеется огромное количество оружия и возможностей его ""модернизации"" которая может быть очень необычна в зависимости от класса (к примеру Cursed).

- Моды - таким никого не удивить, но на имеющуюся платформу где и так много всего, можно добавить еще больше! И классов и видов оружия и чего только душе угодно.

- Псевдо онлайн - интересное решение пассивного онлайна, где игроки могут только демонстрировать находки и видеть, кто чего достиг и где умер. 
Периодически во время праздников и особых дней, гм создает и вводит события, которые есть только в этот период или день. Что добавляет для игроков приятные уникальные события.
В игре есть статистика как глобальная, так и ваша локальная.
----

Кроме названных особенностей в игре есть много нюансов связанных с механикой и боевой системой, которая раскрывается в полной мере после отыгрыша за большинство классов.
-----

Из отрицательных моментов, можно отметить только однообразие в отношении генерации уровней, сеттинга,  игрового процесса (так можно говорить о всех играх). Хотя это спорные замечания, Roguelike не обязан быть красивым и сладеньким, главное механика и ситуации в которых оказывается игрок (зачастую в невыгодной ситуации). По сравнению с многими и про отцами этого ""жанра"", он очень ""привлекателен"".
----
Тяжело рекомендовать игру тем кто не знаком с этим жанром поэтому если появилось желание то лучше начните с более казуальных вещей вроде Dungeon Dremor или Endless Dungeon или вовсе казуальных штучек ""на коленке"" вроде - Ziggurat, Quest of dungeon, Cavern Kings (аркадный рогалик), Rogue Legacy.

I've never been a big fan of permadeath in games but I'm trying to embrace it here. It really adds something to a game like this when one mistake could kill your character and make you start over and the difficulty is such that dying is usually the result of making an identifiable mistake or going into a dungeon underleveled.

Tales of Maj'Eyal. -sigh- I said I would write a review for this game when I beat it. Well I just edged over six hundred hours and finally have won. There really isn't much more to cover. The tags show it's a rogue-like, the videos give you a solid understanding of what to expect, and the user base has voted it overwhelmingly positive. So instead, I'm going to explain the emotional aspects of the game.  TOME (Tales of Maj'Eyal) will make you feel dead inside. I've litteraly taken a skirmisher over the course of thirty hours into the second to the last room and died. Boom, save deleted. Can you handle that? I couldn't, that was around hour mark 400. I couldn't sleep, I'm not kidding, when you die TOME plays this little dun dun dunn tone. I had no idea I was about to die, the moment the screen flicked red and that tune played, well, I broke out into a sweat. My friend was over visiting from the other side of the state and that is the only reason I didn't freak out into a felonious rage. Now you gotta understand, that was one death of many. Your victories are few and far between in TOME, you refight the same bosses over and over and over, it doesn't matter how much content there is in the game, you will feel almost no reward for killing alt minotaur for the hundreath time. You'll rage through the sandworms annoyed that you have to think with every move rather than autopiloting. When you're sucked into the fearscape with a fire specd character you'll understand fear and if you get out alive you just return to the motions. After hundreds of hours of hundreds of deaths you finally get to the last boss. Then you win. I've been smiling for two days now, I think on winning and just grin. I can't help it. It's probably the most rewarding victory I've ever had in a game. Puts emerald or ruby weapon to shame. Six hundred hours for this feeling. Then you take it off normal mode and switch to nightmare difficulty and die in the starting area. So basically what I'm saying is, how well do you know yourself? Is this a goal worth your time? It was for me.

Some Quick Notes for Noobs:
Z: This hotkey will rest your character and autoexplore. Use at your own risk.
P: This pulls up all the talent trees so you can plan for the future.
I: Inventory, big suprise.
F1 and F2: These toggle between the golem and the alchemist if you play that class.
Caps Lock: This enables free viewing on the map so you can arrow key around.
Tab: Blows up the map so you can see it better, enemies you know of will be marked on it.
Options Menu: In this menu you can turn off the autopick tool for your skill and stat points at creation.

With the expansions it has two story campaigns to go through, an infinite dungeon and a wave fighting arena mode. The main campaign has tens of zones (and random generated zones using the farportal) and Embers of Rage featuring over 20 zones as well.
With 14 races and over 30 classes each featuring their own talent categories (some can share some categories with other classes) there's an insane amount of replayability as you try different class/race combinations and master their playstyles. Granted a lot of them have to be unlocked by doing different objectives in game, if you're not into that theres a mod that lets you unlock all of them.
Main reason why ToME is THE roguelike to play is the nature of it's combat. As you play you will gather abilities from talents and items, some of them having multiple uses (like Rush being good for: attacking, repositioning and escaping). Enemies also use the same abilities depending on their class and by inspecting them you can learn how to deal with different enemies as different classes.

So I know my time played doesn't reflect this, but back way before the oozemancer came out in this game, there was a period where I didn't have any real internet connectivity for two years, which made playing any type of game impossible and downloading anything the same. One day I had the bright idea to get a roguelike, since I could hotspot my phones data service to download something rather small that would DL quickly. I got a bunch of roguelikes and I like to think it spawned my eternal love for them during those two years.

 Anyway, ToME was one of those roguelikes, and I SWEAR TO YOU I played it almost every single day for hours on end. It is an INCREDIBLY fun and addicting experience. As an avid roguelike player the graphics mean virtually nothing to me, being used to ASCII and barely perceptible tile sets. I still praise the games artwork and aesthetic design highly though. It is so simply rendered yet beautiful in its approach. The gameplay is amazing, turn based, plenty of abilites, plenty of choices, plenty of different ways to build different characters, plenty of differenct races, plenty of different classes. Plenty of everything. 

I just recently bought it on steam, along with the dlc, and god DAMN let me fucking tell you, the DLC is FUCKING FANTASTIC. In a game that already set a high bar on its self, the DLC pushes that bar and in some places even cracks it open. DarkGod has truly made an amazing game that, with time, I imagine most if not all people can get into, given its alternating difficulties and approach to the traditional roguelike challenges. 

Also, for a roguelike, it is relatively newbie friendly. Easy to play and hard to master ya dig?

Now it's time to write a review... wait, gotta buy the DLC first... including the one that doesn't do anything, to support the dev. I felt like a criminal for how much I paid for ToME from the start... 

Ok, done. Now... where was I?

Oh, the review. I paid 10 times more (each) for 2 or 3 games during summer sale than I paid for Maj, just a couple of days before getting it. What happened was I didn't play any of the others (AAA stuff) once after I started ToME, and now I'm writing this review while thinking about what class to play next.

If you haven't played any game like this one before, and by looking at the screenshots feel like it doesn't look (literally) good enough for you, keep in mind that the point is: while it doesn't have the fancy, modern graphics, it does right everything most games these days do wrong-- everything that makes it a GAME is great.

I'll try to keep it short:

Roguelike - It is, but on Adventure mode you get about 7 lives (+some items you may find that can resurrect you once). You can go hardcore, 1-life Roguelike if you want.

Races/Classes - Several of them, unlockable. I'm still missing 5. They are very different from each other, with many different and interesting skill trees. You gotta put some thinking into figuring out what you are gonna make and how you are going to build it.

Items - Diablo-like, random drops and attributes, different rarity and tier levels. You feel the thrill of finding good loot. Lots of uniques too. You can stash them and retrieve with another/new character, boosting them hard on your future playthroughs. Just 3 at a time tho, which is annoying, but you can re-do it as many times as you want and so distribute any number of items between your dudes.

Map/Dungeons - Always the same dungeons, but spawning on random locations across the map and with randomized interiors. Some minor events and sub-dungeons are also randomly generated.

Quests - Not a lot of them, always the same, but some are very interesting and give nice rewards.

Lore - LOTS of lore scrolls to be found, telling the game's universe story. I didn't read them, I never do, I don't have the patience, but if you like immersing yourself a bit deeper, you won't have a problem with that.

Elite/Rare/Unique/Boss Monsters - These are the ones who usually take those 7 lives away from you... along with the rare multihued wyrms... and magic wielders... and map encounters...  and everything else if you are a Mage.

Gameplay - You gotta build your character right, position yourself right, pay attention, have an escape plan... some parts are really though until you get a good hang of the game-- which is great, and a good part of the fun.

Graphics/Sound - They work perfectly, the visual effects are nice and the music is pretty good.

Bugs/Crashes - I got 3 in 63 hours. Fixed a ""0 turn duration skill"" by going back to the main menu and then continuing the game, fixed both crashes by clicking ""Close"" on the in-game dump note. I had to kill one of my temporal hounds on the second one though, otherwise the dumps kept coming, but it was easily fixed.

This is a great game, awesome cost/benefit. I'm usually skeptical about old-school graphics, but they don't take anything away from ToME, and this baby does very well what most modern games screw up - the part that really matters.

And now... I'm going Paladin next. To see if I can get that holy gentleman past the freaking Master... 

EDIT:

My paladin died on the last boss fight. I'm still mourning him... or rather all the items he took along to his grave. I hope he is in hell... forever...

Doombringer, the DLC class, is awesome.

I also found out I'm not man enough to face the Atamathon.

On the downside, Temporal Hounds always end up glitching somehow (and Time Warden is the s**t, my best dude). I had to edit and repack some of the game's files to fix one of them. It worked, but required some effort. And now, doing the Prides on Nightmare with that very same TW, the game began freezing hard, forcing me to reopen it to keep going every 20 minutes or so.

So... avoid Temporal Hounds if you can. I can't, I like puppies. On the other hand, I didn't have any problems whatsoever with the other classes... my summoner (who spawned a lot more stuff than 3 dogs) worked fine until he got raped by The Master.",1434889816,1488034314,True,32,2,0.707981765270233154,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The developer is very attentive to feedback and is always working on the game (fixing things, adding things, and fine tuning it.)  Oh, and did I mention that this game is MODDABLE?  Yes, it is.  And, there's an absurd amount of mods on the steam workshop, with more being added almost constantly.

It has all the fun and challenge of a classic roguelike but updated with modern conveniences. Not to mention this game is just sopping wet with lore that, if you actually take the time to read through, is pretty damn interesting. In short, it's been an amazing experience so far. If you're a fan of the classics like ADOM then I couldn't recommend this enough.

One of the things I absolutely adore about this game is all the unlockables. In a genre in which you can die fairly quickly or lose hours of progress over one stupid mistake, you need good amounts of replay value to keep you rolling characters. This game does that pretty well with tons of unlockables. You not only have races, classes and talent trees to unlock, but also prodigy unlocks that'll give every character you roll items like the transmogrification box which automatically picks up junk items and turns them into gold. 

There's a fairly good variety of dungeons in this game. Not only in style and layout but in the ways you can go about progressing in them. I found myself in a cave with no hallways filled with passive worms that chewed up sections of the wall. In order to go to the next room you needed to follow one of these worms and if you stuck around in one of its tunnels for too long it could collapse on you. Made for a really intense boss fight at the end. Not to mention each dungeon is filled to burst with it's own lore which is definitely a plus. A lot of them have little challenges too in the form of rooms behind stuck doors. If you choose to open these doors you're usually faced with tough monsters and traps, but also some pretty fancy loot. It's completely optional so if you're struggling to get through a dungeon then it's just not worth it.

In the time I've been playing I haven't been able to find a whole lotta quests. It seems like half the people you talk to early-game are all looking for potion ingredients but the rest were actually pretty interesting. I found a secret door in the overworld that took me to a rogue's den where they captured a merchant. You have the choice of joining the rogues or freeing the merchant which unlocks a rare items shop in one of the towns. Later-game quests get more interesting as well.

Teaching someone how to play your game is very important. It's something I think about every time I play a game and it can ultimately ruin a player's experience early on if they have no idea what they're doing. Now this is especially difficult with games like this that are filled with content and complexity. The solution? Unlockables. This game gives you the basics of each different type of class to start off with. This keeps the player from being overwhelmed with options at the beginning or the advanced know-how to play the more strategic classes. It also gives the player a goal early on to keep them playing. I had no trouble at all learning how to play this game. If you're new to roguelikes then I don't think you'd have troubles either.

I think my only real gripe with this game is the random escort missions you get on some dungeon floors. They're great in that if you do manage to escort them to their portal, you get a pretty decent reward. However, their ai is absolutely ridiculous. They tend to blindly trudge slowly towards their portal and tend to get themselves trapped between monsters or just refuse to run away from some of them which is double bad if you're a ranged class. There's a mod in the workshop that helps with this problem but the problem's still kinda there, you're just able to make them wait in one spot for x amount of turns.

All in all, this game is fantastic. The amount of content you get in this game is astounding, too. Even it's DLC is soaked in content. Not to mention the price is pretty damn reasonable. If you're into roguelikes then there's no reason not to pick this up. If you're trying to get into roguelikes but are left feeling empty playing roguelike-likes or games that claim to have ""roguelike elements"" expecting to get that same rush playing NetHack then you owe it to yourself to play this game.

This can be especially frustrating, but TOME's adventure mode gives several lives (Gasp, the horror!), which does help to at least mitigate that frustration a bit.

The game is fairly lengthy, and the replayability of the game is amazing. Many of the classes have a very distinct feel to them, which makes it fun to experiment with various character builds. The most frustrating thing about this game is that it takes a while to build up a character the way you want it, and then a harsh combination of a boss can easily wipe it out if you are like me and refuse to skip places and come back to it later.

Overall, a great game to try out and play. If you're on the fence about ""buying/donating"" to this game. You can play this game for free on te4.org. You will get access to nearly everything that a donator would so you really won't be missing much, but if you enjoy it, I recommend you toss some $$ towards the DarkGod since he's done an amazing thing with this game.",1434394472,1434394472,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Some short info of the game to sway you to buy it:

>Roguelike with various difficulties and modi, like Nightmare Adventure, Medium Roguelike (permadeath - read: Man mode)
>Fixed overworld map with fixed and random dungeon locations
>Buttload of interesting items & stat modifiers
>>Fixed artifacts, random artifact generation, standard stuff with 1 or more ""ego"" *fixes affecting various stats
>Progression with permanent (and cloud saved) unlocks
>>Unlockable skill trees (like extra schools of magic), races and classes to add diversity
>>>Some classes have special resource bars and can utilize items in unique ways, diversity is huge in this game
>>>Class design (in most cases) is simply amazing, where the game gives you the feeling that your chosen class is simply OP, until you die to your own incompetence and want to start over again just to make it better this time. A lot of the classes have very unique design as well, offering synergies, combinations of effects and other things I have yet to see in other roguelikes.
>Amazing web services, just check out a random profile: http://te4.org/users/kalmazaton
>Fixed zone bosses and possible bosses, as well as randomized mini-bosses
>A lot of room for challenge and exploration in general
>Dev involvement. Our sexy overlord drops by in chat frequently, so do some people helping out with the programming. Occasionally they will launch in-game events that range from extra dungeons to unique/interesting buffs.
>Awesome Steam Workshop add-on integration & content

Some things that may be off-putting:
>Learning curve - Even for people familiar with the genre, in the beginning you might encounter some bullshit moments or just have to look up the wiki for some things until you know better. The community can be reached ingame through a live chat and is very helpful, though.
>Permanent unlocks. Personally, I love the idea of obtaining new, unique and game altering choices and builds by completing challenges, but some people just prefer to have all the options available from the get go. A remedy later in this review.
>Grind. The grind is not bad, but you can make it bad by failure. If you man-tain a beard and have balls to show for, you will stick to Permadeath (Roguelike) mode, and especially in the beginning where you are getting a feeling for everything - enemies in general, boss strategies, zone order with your preferred class etc. etc. - you will die often and may end up with the feeling that you have to redo the same few dungeons over and over again.
Please, if you feel like you're stuck like this, just ask the community, or consult the wiki and look up some unlockables to keep you motivated and approach things from a different perspective.

***

Things to note:

The game is free. Why buy it then?
Simple: Donor status. Even on a sale you get credited for the full price, unlocking an extra class (Stone Wardens, super defensive, dual wielding shields) as well as an item vault where you can store a handful of items (I think it was 5 with the Steam purchase) for other characters to retrieve, to give your next level 10-15 character a push.
You have to log into te4.org and tie your Tome4 account with Steam to get the boni though (unless it does this for you automagically already, no idea).

For the love of what is holy to you, get the expansion Ashes of Urh'Rok. It adds so much more content, including two awesome classes, and the pack is on a sale right now anyway.

Get some add-ons!
I recommend these Quality of Life mods:
'Purists' Breeding Pits Restoration Project - Dev got pressured to censor one area by SJWs, this undoes the censorship
NPC Forgiveness - Has NPCs forgive you after some time if you accidentally hit them with an AoE
Escorts Enhanced - Makes those random escort NPCs less of a PITA; You can now ask them where their exit point is and they have a HP regen now

Then another one for pansies: Whatever this mod was called that lets you pick all the races/classes etc. even if you don't have them unlocked.

Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is extremely good at what it is- a roguelike of the dungeoncrawler RPG type, that can also be played as a more regular RPG with limited or infinite lives. Combat is a fairly quick turn-based system, that requires a decent amount of care as death is quite easy to come by. Items, statistics, and talents are complex yet fairly easy to parce, with items especially having a wide variety of possible enchantments and special effects, along with many unique items. There are a wide variety of character classes and races, some of fairly traditional RPG stripe and some highly unique, most of which unlock with play.

Both as a roguelike and as an RPG, ToME has extremely high-quality lore and worldbuilding- every unique item has some kind of description or history, many of the bosses and areas have reasons for existing, and Maj'Eyal, the world, itself has an interesting history and substantially long questline (which is also quite difficult- while playing without infinite lives, I have never come close to beating it)

The game can be played with permadeath, limited lives, or infinite lives, and with the regular Maj'Eyal questline, or in the Infinite Dungeon (which works as you would expect), or in Arena combat.

All in all, an extremely good game with a variety of ways to play depending on what you are looking for.",1434390280,1434390280,True,1,0,0.504431307315826416,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First things first, it's a roguelike alright: permadeath, randomized world, tile-based graphics, yadda yadda. And yet it's a great introduction to the roguelike genre, because there are options to play it with a number of lives, or even unlimited ones, to get the hang of the game! Not EVERYTHING is randomized (there are fixed artifacts, fixed locations, etc but it still feels like a roguelike). Also, it contains intuitive UI and gameplay. For example, there are practically no consumables like potions and scrolls - not in the sense we're accostumed to. Instead, your powers (and some items) have cooldowns along with, naturally, some resource management (stamina, mana, psi, etc.). Cast X spell/move? Wait Z turns to use it again. Or, maybe, use some talent that can reset some cooldowns ;-). That cooldown system is really intuitive and just one of the many reasons I'm in love with ToME.

Now let's talk about the world. I'm not an old ToME follower but unless I'm mistaken, it used to be set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth, until it was changed to a more original lore. And it's a great lore: the continent of Eyal was, some time ago, devastated by catatrophic used of magic (i.e the Spellblaze), there are still mage hunters (Zigur), there are political issues (Halflings are militaristic and even used to slave Yeeks); heck, even the demons have a touching and fantastic backstory! So, in terms of lore, the game has good stuff to offer. Some of the actual places are very creative, too: tunnels of sand that can collapse and swallow the uncautious adventurer, underwater ruins, necromancer dens, forests, deserts, and so on...

In terms of races/classes, there are 11 races and 26 classes, allowing for tons of builds. There are your classic warriors (Bulwark, Berserker), mages (Archmage, Necromancer) and even exotic classes that can manipulate things like their foes' dreams (Solipsist), draconic powers (Wyrmic) and even time itself (Temporal Warden, Paradox Mage)! Most of the races and classes are unlocked as you progress in the game and do certain tasks, which aren't too hard, honestly. But if you're impatient, then you can look for an addon (mod) that unlocks everything right out of the bat. ;-)

Anyway, it's getting too long. I typed all of that to convice you to PLAY THE GAME. Seriously, play it. It's great, no matter if you're a roguelike veteran or new to the genre (like me, actually)!

It has ok graphics (phenominal for its genre), decent sound design, distinct graphical effects for spells and the like, and a whacky variety of races and classes. The world of Maj'Eyal has some pretty cool lore, which is good because there are huge piles of it.

If you play this game, start on Adventurer mode. You get an extra life at set levels, and until you have a really good grasp on the game, playing on Roguelike (ie one death and you're done) is an exercise in frustration. Until very recently, I refused to play on anything other than the one-life setting. This was a mistake. Don't be me.",1433452216,1433593979,True,5,0,0.535036027431488037,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Most of them feel like one long dungeon run. Some of them have a sort of level select (crypt of the necrodancer) or progress through different levels (rogues legacy/binding of isaac).

But none of them had the feeling like you were an adventurer, going on YOUR OWN adventure. They kind of drop you in a dungeon and say ""have fun, here's your dungeon"".

But in TOME (tales of maj'eyal) you got an overworld map. You can go to really difficult areas or fight random adventurers who just roam around. There's towns you can visit and tons of shops.

It's very immersive, especially for a roguelike. It makes me want to play some pen and paper D&D again.

And there's a ton of skills and items you can get. And lots of random events. Many random bosses / minibosses who will destroy you. There's just a TON of content. It's not difficult to get into, although discerning what loot is useful or not is definitely beyond casual.

You can chat with other players, which even in a single player game can add a lot. You can see when people die, which even if you aren't talking to them, is interesting to watch.

And my personal favorite feature is that you can have multiple lives. It's not a great feature in the spirit of roguelikes, but in the spirit of gaming it's fantastic. This is usually an instant ""omg this game sucks and isn't a roguelike"". But I love everything about these type of RPGs, EXCEPT for the permadeath.

For some reason, finding a mix of roguelike aspects in a non-roguelike RPG is impossible. That is, things like traps, random events, deep character customizations, random/persistent effects, and just general ""I have no idea what this will do, but I'll try it"". The ONLY game that ever came close to that which I know of is Din's Curse.

The depth (more than 1000 achievements!) and time that you can spend on one character, only to watch it die and having to start over is a great thing in gaming .  You get to really care about the investment!  

Combine the price with the many mods and the massive amount of depth the game has and you have an awesome package!

⁜도전과제도 잘되어있어서 게임도중 뭔가 달성했다는 느낌을 잘받게 짜여져있습니다.

⁜스토리도 꽤나 좋은 편입니다. 단순히 악과 선의 대결 구도에서 시작한 이야기가 점차 진행되고 읽을거리를 읽다보면 그게 전부가 아니라는 점에서 즐겁습니다. 세세한 읽을거리도 많은 편입니다.

⁜난이도 밸런싱이 인새인 난이도까지는 정말 마음에 듭니다. 단지 적의 공격력과 방어력이 강해지는게 아니라 적에게 캐릭터 스킬을 랜덤하게 붙이고 랜덤을 돌린다는게 밸런스에 어떤 시너지를 내는지 잘 보여줍니다. 신 캐릭터가 나왔다고요? 사기라고요? 그 사기스킬을 쓰는 적이 나온다는 뜻입니다. 그런만큼 모든 캐릭터의 밸런스가 적절하게 맞춰져 있습니다. 왜냐하면 사기스킬의 등장은 적도 사기스킬이라서 칼너프를 맞게 됩니다.

⁜스킬이 정말 잘만들었습니다. 예를들어 우리가 아는 근접 텔레포트 스킬이라고 하면 일정 지점으로 이동하는것만 생각하지만 이게임은 근접 텔레포트 스킬로 적이 다가오면 텔레포트 시켜서 밀어내고 멀어진적은 땡기고 내가 도망하는데 쓰는등 전장을 내 마음대로 조율하게 되어있습니다. 물론 모든 스킬이 다 그런것은 아니지만 이런 번뜩이는 아이디어의 재미있는 스킬이 정말 많습니다.

For a game of this magnitude, my limited gametime is a drop in the comparative ocean. However in these 14 hours I have enjoyed countless adventures and hence feel the need to express my feelings towards this game.

TOME is a Roguelike in its purest form; that said, it is the formula of dungeons within dungeons and static set pieces that allow its narrative to shine. This is not a game of simply smashing your way through numbers to obtain numbers to increase your numbers this is seen in many RPGS and hack'n'slashes;  there is a rich layer of lore found in conversations as well as scrolls and other objects that add a level of depth and immersion that many other ""have a quick go"" Roguelikes lack somewhat. Make no mistake, this game is a labour of love.

Despite the level of depth and complexity, TOME is incredibly easy to pick up and play; most aspects of playing are self explanatory. Items and their inherent effects are explained concisely and character sheets are detailed but not cluttered to the point of being rendered unusuable. The inventory is forgiving and even offers to empty itself for you after every floor of a dungeon, eliminating annoying overencumbered messages. 

As stated previously I have amassed 14 hours in this game; in this space of time I have had a measly 1 character exceed level 10. This is a difficult game, an attribute which may put players off but attracts me all the more. Sometimes deaths leave you feeling cheated, especially random encounters in the overworld where an enemy caster can easily 2 or 3 shot an unprepared player from afar; this is countered by the player being transported to another plane upon death by a being of great power. The player then has the choice of being teleported to somewhere safer or dropped back into the fight rejuevenated. I would be lying if I said the latter act of manning up didn't cost me more than one decent character.

WIth the huge amount of races, talent trees, classes etc character creation is a powerful tool and allows you to progress in many different directions. Want a Cursed Elf? Check. Dwarven Alchemist with his own pet Golem? K. Halfling carrying out his own Hellish agenda of slaughter? Got it. Options such as these, the item system and the procedural world give the game practically unending longevity.

All too often, they throw a million different obtuse mechanics at you, including but not limited to hunger (discouraging exploration), unidentified items (discouraging the collection of loot, which serves as a major incentive to crawl a dungeon to begin with), or cursed items (discouraging the use of higher quality gear because you'll never be able to unequip it, or equipping it literally kills you)

DarkGod (the developer of the game) decided to try something different, here. Understanding that mechanics like cursed items and hunger are relics of the past, he did away with them. This entire game, conceptually speaking, takes a good, hard look at what makes other roguelikes unapproachable messes and tries to understand what the real meat of the genre is, and he has spent years polishing his vision to a fine shine.

 DarkGod has given you a a huge variety of archtypes, each with their own subclasses that specialize in one thing or another. Simple ""bump"" based combat that dominates other games in the genre has been replaced with a rich skill system that encourages you to carefully consider not only the positions of yourself and your enemies, but what skills to use in order to ensure your survival. Rather than relying on hard to find or expensive to purchase consumable items, you will find ""runes"" and ""inscriptions"" that are infinitely re-usable, but come with a cooldown, demanding that you make strategic use of them. The skill tree system forces you to make careful decisions in regards to pumping skills that make it easier to not die, or pumping skills that make it easier for you to kill enemies, which is itself another valid form of survival. Many skills combo together in ways that you can't easily imagine, which, if you slow down and take enough time to think it through, a situation which appears hopeless at first glance can be turned around through sheer determination and enough tactical thought.

I will readily admit that I am not well versed enough in the genre to elaborate any further on what this game does better than its competitors. But I do know that I have avoided playing roguelikes for years because of obtuse mechanics, and this game did away with enough of them to captivate me for dozens of hours already, and will almost certainly rob me of even more of my time as the days go on.

- La gestion des debuff, et de votres(vos) energy sont primordial pour chaque combat important. Je suis mort un nombre incalculable de fois au premier boss avant de saisir toute l'importance des débuff..

First, now that I have a few games under my belt and have a least started some of the overall learning curve (there is a lot of information to digest in this game), I would like to say [b]BRAVO[/b] to the developer.  This game is for any old school RPG'er that misses great mechanics and gameplay.  I cannot stress enough how engaging this game is.  Anyway, I will list some of the goods and bads of the game.

[h1][u]The Good[/u][/h1]

[list]
[*] The developer, DarkGod, is very attentive to the boards and genuinely is interested in his customers.  This is a positive that is almost nonexistent is most software. (Especially indy stuff.)
[*] The choice of characters/classes is vast.  Yes, you have to play to unlock all of them.  That is part of the fun.
[*] Character development is very customizable and detailed.  For me this is a plus, for some this is the source of extreme confusion.
[*] The UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat inclined learning curve.  I have been playing for 60 odd hours and I am still finding ways to use it and new things I didn't know it could do with it.
[*] The workshop support is tremendous.  You can customize this game to suit your needs.
[*] This is a Rogue Like game that has difficulty settings from casual to hard core.  If you want, you CAN play with unlimited lives.  Or, if you fancy a good challenge, you can play 1 life on crazy difficulty.  The choice is yours.  (I read a few reviews complaining that they died too quick.  So set it on easy and learn to play; it is that simple.)
[*] Tremendous amount of trophies.  One ninth of them are very gettable for anyone. (The trophes are copied nine times for different levels of play.  And, yes, if you do higher level trophies they will get all the same trophies below them.  You just have to do a little dance to have it happen.  If an old fart like me can figure it out (I read posts) then I imagine most people can do the same.)
[*] The story is not bad at all.  Far more engaging than most much more expensive games.  If you think it is boring and unimaginative you probably haven't actually read and/or played through much of it.
[/list]

[h1][u]The Bad[/u][/h1]

[*] No, this game is not perfect.  The biggest drawback, from some people's view, is the graphics.  They are very yesterday, yesteryear, last decade possibly.  (For me this is not that big of a deal, I will gladly trade eye-candy for good gameplay.)
[*] I have experienced some game lag in different parts of the game.  Not sure what causes them, but they are surely there.  I have never had it crash, but I have had to wait 30-90 seconds for it to come out of an apparent mini-freeze.
[*] This game can be unflinchingly mean and nasty at higher levels.  For some this is a deal breaker.  For me it is a lot of fun.  So do with that what you want.  (I have read many blog/posts about people rage quitting and never playing again.  For those people...never play Magic the Gathering, you will end up hating life and your friends.)
[*] The UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat [b][u]inclined learning curve.[/u][/b]  Yes, I know this was listed in my ""Goods,"" but it is most definitely a negative for a lot of people.
[*] Kind of gets in the way of life if you get into it.  It is a ""just one more turn/zone/thingy type game that will overtake your life if you let it.
[/list]

That is all that I can think of off the top of my head.  I have an old head.  (And, most of the other parts as well.)  So, in closing, get the game.  It is too cheap and well made to not have it in your library.  If this is formatted incorrectly, I humbly apologize for my oldness and lack of modern techno-goodness; it has been years since I ""formatted"" anything and I imagine quite rusty.

I was so wrong. Lets start at the basic things:

Graphics: its a pixel/sprite like game 2d top down. I mean its not super hd high quality but i personally like it a lot.
But of course you dont get games like this for the graphics but for the gameplay.

Gameplay: holy shit its a lot. You start with a few races and classes to choose from but as you go further in the main story you unlock more stuff. There are 3 game modes.

1. story mode: its a story mode. You start at a starting place (which is different for some classes and races) and go through a adventure. you unlock a lot of things by just playing. You can play this on different difficulties and modes. Roguelike with 1 life, Adventure where you unlock some extra lifes as you level a bit and exploration where you have infinite lives.

2. Arena: you unlock this by doing a quest quite early in the game, you are in a arena with whatever race/class you chose and you battle against a wave of enemies to become a champion.

3. Endless dungeon: also a game mode you need to unlock in story mode. Well what is more to say you got endless floors and keep going further and further down. You can break the level cap with this i think and go higher than 50.

Story/Lore: I love the lore the most. It feels like such a deep world with all the information you get about people and the history i think its amazing.

I also would like to tell you i havent even touched the surface of this game got around 30 hours now and there is still so much to do. I got the dlc just to support the maker.

Very immersive and downright addictive! It can be a very gritty roguelike, but not mind-numbingly unforgiving. Also has a great balance of deep strategy without drowning you in minute details, and without making the game slow and boring. 

You can tell actual effort has been put into the lore of the world and the storyline is very accessible without requiring you to dive into it too heavy. The quests have substance, instead of the MMO run-around ""Kill 20 boars"" nonsense. 

I love roguelikes that let you unlock new classes or birth options like this one! It's great that you can be rewarded even if your character permanently dies - adds a lot of replay value. And the class options are outstanding! There's a lot of strategy and depth in the class talents and other levelling decisions.

Games like Angband, Zangband, Cthangband, Animeband, Hengband, etc.  I'm going to do some comparing, because in order to understand why you should play ToME, some history and context is useful.  You've gotta know what you're getting into, here.

Comparing Hacklikes to *Bands is a lot like comparing X-Wing Vs. Tie Fighter to X3.  Roguelikes aren't generally ""fast-paced"" (with the exception of some wonderful titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer), but when I say that Hacklikes are faster than *Bands, what I mean is the planned length of a successful game is much shorter.  You can beat Nethack in a determined afternoon if you know exactly what you're doing and get a bit lucky.  *Bands are designed to be played for hundreds of hours before completion.  This distinction wasn't apparent to me until I got a bit older and explored the *Bands more thoroughly, because at first I just found them boring and samey.

Tales of Maj'Eyal (and how do you even say that out loud?) is, historically and in spirit, a *Band game.  It used to be called Tales of Middle Earth, and was based on a game called UMoria, which is in turn an Angband variant.  For ToME 4, they discarded the Tolkein and created all new lore from scratch, and changed a LOT of features.  This is largely the ToME that you'll be playing if you buy this game.

So, what characterizes a *Band, and ToME in particular?  What kind of games are these?

Whereas in Hacklikes, you are pressed forward by limited resources and infinitely spawning monsters, in a *Band, the game flow is based around infinite resources.  Take food, for example.  In most if not all Hacklikes, your character becomes hungry over time at a pretty good clip, and you have to find food or you will die.  So, much of the early game becomes about knowing which monster corpses are safe or even beneficial to eat, as well as locating non-perishable foods such as rations (which are in turn quite heavy in bulk, necessitating inventory management of very limited space).

In *Bands, you also get hungry, but the rate at which you do is very very slow compared to Hacklikes.  Monsters generally don't leave corpses, and you can always buy rations in town, which you can always get back to easily with a scroll of recall.  Hacklikes generally have no such spells or scrolls (if they have towns at all), and shop inventory is very limited and, depending on the game, usually does not restock.

Hunger is, however, a mechanic that later on becomes almost a non-issue in winning Hacklike runs.  There exist items that can slow digestion or produce infinite or near-infinite food in most all Hacklikes, such that the hunger mechanic mostly kills off early characters or very unlucky midrange characters.  And in *Bands, I'm a relative noob, but I've still never lost a character due to hunger.

So, why even have a hunger mechanic, then?  The developer of ToME probably asked himself that very question, and did away with hunger for ToME 4.  This is only one of many smoothed out, streamlined mechanics that fully embrace the *Band / infinite resources heritage of ToME and make it more accessible for newcomers.  There are also no unidentified items, for instance, and the game offers you an ""adventure"" mode where you have more than one life, or an ""exploration"" mode that's unlocked and visible right from the start, with infinite lives.  Of course, I'm bullheaded and old-school, so I only play on ""roguelike"" mode, where dead is dead.  But you might find you have wiggle room in other modes to learn more per character.

You're still going to die a lot, especially if you play anything other than a Bulwark.  But the classes are very interesting, and the lore is very well-written and interesting.  You gradually unlock more birth options (for new characters) as you play and find certain sidequests, but nothing else is persistent between runs, unlike many of the rogue-lites and mystery dungeon type games that have been popular lately.  This is a very hardcore, old-school roguelike of the *Band lineage.  You'll be playing any particular character for a very long time, growing attached to them and overcoming many challenges before dying horribly 100 hours from now because you got stupid for a second.  And then you're going to start over, because it's insanely fun.

Alchemists in particular are probably my favorite class so far: You get a golem that you can equip and that has laser eyes and charges into battle to take hits for you while you throw grenades from the back lines.  I like to name mine after my boyfriend.  Summoners are also a lot of fun: you can throw wolves at peoples' faces, and summon dragons and minotaurs to kill things while your turtle tanks for you.  But I really recommend playing Bulwark or maybe Berserker to start: they're much less flimsy (Bulwarks in particular, they're the sword/mace/axe and board characters) and will let you learn more and accomplish more birth unlocks per run.

Healing is accomplished through cooldown abilities rather than limited items, and you have a lot of options for talent specs to build even a particular class in very different ways.  Different races have very useful and interesting bonuses and penalties and racial skills, and as a woman I appreciate that there's no in-game difference between playing female or male.  Roguelikes aren't the games to do gender political commentary, lol.

So, if you get ToME (and you absolutely should), you're basically getting what games like the Elder Scrolls series aspire in their most ambitious moments to be: a long-term playfield where you can go on adventures and explore dungeons and become strong from nothing.  Most modern crpgs try to achieve what roguelikes, and *Bands in particular, already had nailed a long time ago, and if you play this version of ToME, you're getting the best of any game I've seen so far in this already-amazing and venerable genre.

One last thing: this game includes a chat feature that lets you talk to other players as you play on a few different channels, and I highly recommend you use it and get to know some of the other people who know a lot about the game.  Your mileage may vary of course, but in my experience the community for this game is both dedicated and very welcoming and helpful.

A dwarf, sword and board warrior type.

The first monster I saw was level twenty and it beat the crap out of me and killed me so fast that I didn't have a chance to run away. Then, I go to sort of a Purgatory-like place, where this dude asks if I want to live or stay dead. I chose to live, so I respawn in the dungeon and get killed again. Okay, bad idea. So I go back to Purgatory and then I tell the dude, yeah I want to live but send me some place else. So, he does. Then, I run into an adventuring party which kills me for the third time.

I've always liked roguelikes, but I'm not a huge fan of Elona or Stone Soup mainly because it's a lot of statistics and looking at numbers and generally being confused until something oneshots you in 2 seconds and you have to start over again. While that depth is definitely part of Tales of Maj'Eyal, it's only very necessary for later levels when you're actually needing to manage every stat and balance everything to survive. That isn't to say the game is casual, as you can very easily die over, and over, and over... Actually my main block with the game currently is that I can't unlock any new classes because I can't get far enough without dying!

The main things that pop out to me are the diversity of classes, the world map you can explore and find hidden secrets in, and the wide variety of different spells and tactics you can employ to fight your enemies. You can be an archer and shoot from afar (infinite ammo with reloading- carrying stacks of arrows be damned!), be a trapper and set tons of traps while stealthing around, become several different types of mages and magic casters and much much more.

The graphics are ok, honestly the weak point of the game to me. I feel like people could get easily turned off by the trailer as the graphics look like some old PC freeware game- but I think they're bearable once you're in game, and I think it's cool how your character changes depending on what armour you're wearing. The music is also kind of sleep inducing, although I like the silly snarls some enemies make.

not to mention the format they chose to stick with is merely another failure added to the pile of roguelikes that adopted the semi-linear progression. it simply doesnt work and looks dumb, thats why procedural generation has been the hallmark of roguelikes since the first game - basically forever. even dungeons of dredmor is better.

while I have never been fully able to rationalize ""fairness"" in roguelikes I have a hunch that this game has garbage difficulty progression. it seems to be mostly set in stone and no amount of new levels seem to change the proportions of enemies that will simply steamroll certain builds. while other roguelikes are significantly harder, sometimes you will just encounter a playthrough that provides you with a fair footing against new adversaries. this further undermines maj'eyal's replayability and its f!cking boring.

Prior to playing this, i weren't really into said kind of games, thinking those're boring. This game were my first try, and today is a game i often play when i'm bored.

Pretty simple at the beginning, you choose a class, a race, a name and a gender, then the gamemod (you'll unlock them as you play) and the difficulty/lifes for your character, with complete freedom to choose between some easy and relaxing way to start understanding how the game works, or to begin with an insane journey with only one life that you'll probably lose very soon.
As i mentioned, you can unlock other gamemods while you play and complete certain tasks, and same thing is for other classes and races to have further plays with, trying out new playstyles and techniques.

It can be an unfair experience most of the times, even when playing with a standard difficulty and with a set amount of lives, [spoiler]so don't try to get too upset when losing your character from a single killing blow by a ""something""-caster (if not ""anything""-caster), or for losing a fight with strange unique monsters that have for some reason your same skills/spells, or by overpowered monsters that have 40 more levels than you, that appeared when moved a little harmless rock.[/spoiler]

接触TOME4已经2年多了，从一开始普通难度都通不了的小白，到现在好几个职业玩INSANE都能1命到达远东（这是build合格的标志了吧），个中艰辛与感受一言难尽。

游戏优点：
多种难度，多种种族+职业的组合（真的很多很多，新人在看到职业树的时候肯定有一点选择困难吧），并且很多职业根据你开不同的技能树也有完全不同的玩法（例如近战与远程的心灵杀手区别很大，双杖与双斧堕落区别也很大）

再加上独树一帜的符文/纹身系统，能很好的增强角色的长处/弥补短板（有些职业很缺恢复，这个时候恢复纹身绝对是你对抗敌人的法宝，而众多缺位移的近战职业都依赖加速/大传/定点小跳符文），这使得游戏的战术纵深很不错，在高难度下，玩家经常要同时面对数个稀有，甚至史诗/随机BOSS，这个时候，是战是逃，什么时候交什么技能，无不是用人物的多次死亡积累出来的经验……

背景故事方面，设定完善，但是剧情相对酱油，选择支不多。而所有的各种事件与要素，都是影响角色build与战斗为主，也就是说你比较难遇到像Elona的很多娱乐性随机事件。

总体而言，这是一个及其硬核向的，偏战斗的roguelike游戏。喜欢策略类或者RL类游戏的玩家不要错过。

游戏不定期的update很给力，最近1.25升级到1.30，重做了2个职业并且buff了一个，改变很大

如果建议新手选择职业开始这个游戏，那么我的建议：

战/法全能型：1.30重做的时空守卫，比较强，减少新人挫败感；

猛士无双型：狂战士/掠夺者，特性都是有暂时不会死亡的技能，在持续时间内每杀一个敌人就会在结束的时候回血。享受浴血奋战的快感吧。

碉堡的远程职业：大法师，这是一个有无限可能性的逆天职业。

咦，对了，推荐的3个职业都不是初始职业耶，怎么办？进群下allow build文件呗。

The thing that really shines about this game is the character progression and creation though. Unlike traditional roguelike different classes play COMPLETELY different and indroduce new and interesting mechanics (like the manipulation of time for example). Almost every style of play is to be found here; from being a nasty necromancer and summoning skeletons and bone giants to slaughter your enemies to the time manipulating bow - dual weapon hybrid to the anti-magic ""slime mage"" that posisons his enemies, summons slimes to control the battlefield and uses PSIBLADES (F***ING PSIONIC LASERSWORDS).
In addition to the HUGE amount of classes, the classes themselves are extremly complex by having many different skill-trees to develop and unlock. While some people might see this as a negative I feel like this adds a lot of complexity of depth to the game and makes you able to play classes in completely different ways.

不然怎么现在渲染的steam贵族感那么大？
爹宁可玩的少-宁可井底之蛙！-也没钱了解1堆半成品游戏-宁可看书去
宁可去玩索任起码没这么多独立挡箭牌起码没贵族2和全球开箱精英
宁可去玩网游养老

玩那么多送那么多钱-耗那么多生命-就为了游戏圈不是井底之蛙？
你以为谁管你是啥东西？

反正我觉得只玩录啊录的这辈子也不会无聊了。那么又何必玩那么多？玩给谁看？

正常的是想玩的多的去玩--想只1个玩精通不墨迹的就玩1个--难道不对吗？
非要都玩的多吗？-简直比高考要求都高？你考你妈清华北大呢还是玩游戏呢？

某30的狗是坚定渲染玩的多的人是正常人--希望你们有那么多钱当正常人吧.

希望你们有足够的青春去当正常人吧.

It helps that it has a simmilar look and feel to the Spiderweb Software games which i adore to no end.

This is the kind of game you can sink as much time as you please into and feel equally rewarded either way, wether it's 5 minutes or 5 hours it's a load of fun every time. With the addition of the modding community this game is potentially endless.

I loved that game and played it over and over, although I never had the discipline to beat it.  Tales of Maj'Eyal stands out from the plethora of mediocre 'roguelike' games that are so trendy recently. TOME is a worthy successor to the likes of rogue, netHack, Angband, and Slash'Em in every way.  

Not only does the game offer a large, procedurally generated world to explore but there are also many very well-designed classes to do it with.  Where the game really shines is it's ui.  The fantastic use of color makes item details readily appreciable despite their complexity.  The auto-explore feature reduces the tedium of fully mapping a level, while sacrificing none of the level of tactical control required for difficult fights.

Since TOME uses a scaling level system (within ranges set by the zone), there is no need to have the type of food/hunger system used to force the player to advance deeper in the older games.  I always found a system that forced me to rush (or rely on random spawns for food) to be irksome.

The character classes are really diverse and unlocking them provides amusing challenges outside the central goals of the game.  Spells, abilities, and customization within a class all dramatically affect the playstyle.  Abilities feel like they have a real impact and boss/rare monster fights require tactics tailored to the encounter as well as the player's build.

The Steam login and chat system now work very well so you can chat with other players.  This can be very helpful and amusing.

Pros: 
Classes with unique and interesting skillsets. And a LOT of them.
Interesting races, also with uniqueness.
Large and skilled modding community, always writing new addons for the game.
A dev that listens to feedback!

Cons:
This game is long, and you'll want to play it multiple times if you get into it. Huge timesink.

I'm going to try to be unbiased in reviewing this game but it might be tough since I started playing when it was called Pernband.

Graphics: 3/5 The tiles in this game are very well done and for the most part, everything is pretty easy to identify. In some areas it may be hard to see a monster next to an obstacle but this may be by design. It also has ASCII mode for old school roguelike nerds like myself.

Sound: 3/5 Not horrible but not great. The music mostly fits the areas but some of the sound effects just sound wrong to me.

Difficulty: 5/5 Like most roguelikes, this game is not supposed to be easy. ToME does have adjustable difficulty levels to appeal to a broader audience. You can start with a set number of lives or go typical roguelike style permadeath. You can adjust your experience from casual gaming to pulling your hair out.

Gameplay 5/5: ToME is different than most roguelikes in that it has a somewhat open and explorable world as opposed to a single dungeon and maybe a town. The player starts in an area that depends on the characters race. These areas range from simple to brutal. The story is decent and there are plenty of other quests to occupy your time. This game is controlled by keyboard and/or mouse. This makes it easy for an experienced RL player or a novice to jump right in after the brief tutorial. The level generation is done well enough to make each playthrough feel unique and the battles require just the right amount of strategy to keep the game interesting. There are various unlocks that range from things you will do in a normal game to tedious quests.

Overall: 4/5 If you are an oldschool rogueliker, then you are probably already familiar with some version of ToME. If you are newer to the genre and want to play a difficult dungeon crawler with some exploration then this game is worth looking at.

So much has been poured into it's universe and lore, and that's just the offical main module for the game.  TLDR: Buying this game will be the best thing ever for your rougelike, turn based, strategic, leveling, rage inducing needs.

The world map is consistantly the same, but the dungeons and places are randomized classic rouge dungeons that have themes, leveled content, and many many trolly rougelike goodness waiting inside.

Skills and healing are on turn cooldowns in addition to costing mana/stamina to use, making the whole game really strategic.  The fact everything is turn based yet updates in an instant means the game plays at exactly the pace you can keep up with it.  If you are taking your time reading stats, the game won't do anything till you take action.  But if you pretty much just want to wander down a few hallways to that old room, a single click will instantly have the game ""run"" you over there, and if anything happens along the way (such as enemies coming into view) the game will stop and go back into ""single turn"" strategy mode.

Race and Class are seperate in character creation, and all play different enough that you'll be playing a totally different tactic, yet are based on the same stat and skill tree like system, so you'll know exactly how to figure out the new class.

Add in workshop support for many modded race/class/modules, the open nature of the modding, and the existing website's large community of players and creators, and you'll quickly see why this is one of the best things you will ever buy if you are even remotely interested in rouge-like games.

It's also sufficently rage inducing when you die.  Just a fair warning.  It does follow the rouge game logic of ""learning by death"", so don't become too attached to your characters.  Much rage, followed by ""I really shouldn't have done X"" moments.  You can start as the same character on death, and the gameworld has ways to get ""lives"", even in permadeath mode...so it's a tiny bit more forgiving then your usual rouge.  But only a tiny bit.

It should be noted you can play this for free (with some limitations) from the website of the game.  Paying for the game on steam gets you the ""Donation"" version, with all the limitations removed, same as donating through the site directly.  The steam version can log into an account made with the free version.

Unlike most roguelikes, there's an overworld with towns, said overworld and said towns are not randomly generated, but have fixed layouts, only the dangerous areas that would loosely define as ""dungeons"" are random in layout. Each option feels quite different, and usually has a somewhat unique play style, with race choice as well as class. The game doesn't exactly feel unfair until mid to late levels when the adventure starts getting into ridiculous territory.

Visuals for something as lightweight as this and static sprites are quite nice, there's some 3D effects and 2D effects based on special abilities being used, the sprites are large and detailed enough to know what you're facing before you mouse over it.

Controls are fairly simple, opting for an action bar where you can slot all your different items/abilities, which may deter some of the hardcore players of roguelikes. There's also mouse support, and right clicking on your character or other things allows one to play mostly with the mouse if one prefers.

Sound is present, there's music for every area, sounds for different attacks and special abilities, nothing to really write home about, but it's not bad.

Game mechanics are fairly solid and scale up to the point of more or less halfling going toe to toe with kaiju god-slaying robot of death, though quite a few of the mechanics are not 100% intuitive, difficulty is pretty variable with lots of options. Achievements are a colossal pain in the arse though, as a result, as getting an achievement in one difficulty setting doesn't unlock it for any others, and a lot of the achievements have 12 variations or so based on difficulty settings. Will say that some randomly generated enemies can be impossible to kill, I had an issue with a named bone giant who was impossible to kill at the level cap with ridiculously strong abilities as a summoner.

The game also has a plot and rewards you for being a nice person or a total jerk as well. It's not super deep, but it's enjoyable.

This is, in my opinion, the best roguelike on the market. ToME is an incredibly deep and strategic RPG/roguelike which takes place in an insanely lore-rich world of classic high fantasy. 

The game is strategic in that time moves in ""turns"", meaning time ceases to move between actions or movements. This allows you to carefully plan each action, rather than requiring twitch reflexes. If you want fast paced action, look elsewhere. Animation is minimal, yet the graphics are extemely charming, and convey quite clearly everything that is happening.

Character creation is rich, deep, and super flexible, albeit extremely complex. I've played the same class a million times, but the result is always different depending on how I lay out the stats and skill points, which is probably my favorite part. I am constantly finding fun and oddball builds which get a million times farther than I expect. If you like making characters for tabletop rpgs you'll love this shit.

The difficulty is pretty brutal, but it always feels fair. There are ways to turn this down for chickens, or up farther for masochists and vets. As you play, you get better at making characters and becoming better at survival. But there are a TON of things to unlock too. There are different classes, races, and starting items to unlock in addition to ""campaigns"", which are essentially different game modes. If you get bored of adventuring around the continent, turn on endless dungeon mode. Tired of that? Arena mode is a blast too. 

Basically, this game is insanely fun, super challenging (and therefore rewarding), and the world is written with a very tasteful degree of seriousness. Humor can be found in dialogue but it is subtle and never breaks the immersion (no memes thank the lord.)

In particular the old necromancer class was revamped but so were the necro based bosses who got 10 levels harder (at least) but there is no compensating way to level up to match them now. 

I can't possibly say I don't recommend it because I do if you are a masochist and have tons of free time to learn the game. It isn't too hard to pick up the basics (play roguelikes to find out what I mean) but the gotchyas will chase you for decades. That said, any game that can go a decade+ and keep itself moderately interesting can't be bad. Despite the reduction in fun for some people. 

On the one hand it is grand effort by an independent developer (surrounded by a pretty cool modding community and fans willing to pitch in to get things done) and its rich history as a descendant of rogue itself via Moria and Angband  into an evolving original tactical roguelike role playing game with tons and tons of lore is hard to dismiss just because bitter salt from losing to what seems like unfair odds yet one more time. On the other hand, of my friends I seem to be the only one who didn't find the brutal start too hard (or probably more likely too time consuming and tedious) to last long enough to have this final complaint of feeling that it has been over polished to the point of frustration. 

I will say this, if you get stuck, and you will. The chat community is pretty good about (eventually) helping you find answers and unsticking yourself. And if you dislike aspects of the game but love others you can mod the game pretty completely. (You can seriously break it with the amount of things you load at one time.) 

Bottomline this game is *not* for everyone. If you are willing to work at it you might find it highly enjoyable and you should go ahead and get it and all the dlcs for its really cheap price. (The price is really a way of paying DG, the dev a little back for his hard and continuing work.)  If on the other hand you hate dying and starting over and being frustrated by hundreds of gotchyas (and the occasional game busting bug - that gets squished but in the meantime ends your run) before you ""win"" a run then probably this isn't for you. 

I've played over a decade and have a couple handfuls of wins on Normal difficulty. (The difficulties go up to Insane and get progressively more unforgiving a long the way.)

In short, if you judge it purely as a roguelike, I don't thing it don't hold up too well. Part of the reason I may think that may be my preference for NetHack influenced roguelikes, and my lack of familiarity or appreciation for Angband influenced or Ancient Domains of Mystery influenced rogelikes, but I am not sure how much Tales of Maj'Eyal's design is based on those games.

On the other hand, judged as a RPG Tales of Maj'Eyal does a lot of things right. It has a rather interesting tactical battle system, lots of different character creation options, many ways to tweak and customize your skills, any many items to find that offer a lot of tactical death. It's story, while perhaps presented in a way that relies too much on finding and reading lore text, is at least interesting and presents a few dark twists on the standard high fantasy setting. 

No mater how you judge it, the interface is great, mostly easy to use but able to do a lot, the battles are fast-pasted and fun, and it can be very addicting. The graphics are simple but more then functional enough for what they are, and there are enough interesting special effects and visual flare to make up for the more static sprites. The music is generic but memorable and sometimes can actually be pretty fantastic, even if it is more or less all part of free game music packs. 

I think that is all that really needs o be said, but here is some more detail about how I think about it as a roguelike:

The big problem with Tales of Maj'Eyal's design as a roguelike is simply that the game is too long, story heavy, and not random enough. There is variation in the loot you get and the monsters you face, but the over all world is basically set. Same world map, same town, same quests. The layout of a lot of the random zones are different but the basic themes of the zones are set, and each zone has a set rank for items, a set number of floors, a set list of enemies and possible bosses. Due to how the game is balanced and how enemies never respawn except in a few cases, it's basically required to repeat every zone and sidequest each run or you end up drastically underleveled very quickly, and due to each zone having fixed level requirements you can't even vary the order that much.  

Although you actually have multiple lives before dieing in the default mode, permadeath still is a problem and when it happens you have to start over from he start and go through the same old stuff you already saw again. There is a mode where you can simply have infinite lives, but I kind of wish there was some kind of middle ground, perhaps a way to start over with a new character but with a number of story events that carry over and alter the world. There is a unlock system that adds new races, classes, skill trees, and other things, and that helps, but it still only adds so much and may of the unlocks are obscure or tedious.

I also have a problem with a lot of the streamlining or elimination of a lot of roguelike staples potions and scrolls are gone, and instead characters can equip a number of infusions or runes that can be used over and over again but have a cooldown timer between uses (actually every skill and magic spell in Tales of Maj'Eyal uses cooldown timers, I am not really a fan of them but it works). Wands and other tools work in a similar way as well. This eliminates stockpiling of consumable items, but also eleminates the sort of careful rationing of your resources you need to worry about in other roguelikes.

It's only logical because of this that the whole item identification game is gone and no items have overall negative effects, eliminating the kind of risk vs reward of using items in a panic. Many people may not like needing to worry about identifying stuff but the feature exists in roguelikes for a reason, the same reason randomized levels exist, to make sure you can't just win with rote memorization, and so every action you take has to be done very carefuly. Roguelikes since the original Rogue have always been about exploration and experimentation and the whole idea with unknown items was a big factor in that. 

But again, despite all of these things I don't like about it as a roguelike, I still think it's a really good RPG. Maybe there isn't really that much of a difference, most roguelikes are basically RPGs after all, I just thought I would share my feelings on the subject.",1423821795,1423822322,True,4,0,0.529064178466796875,0,True,False,False,False,,,

--------------------------------

When it comes to Steam games, I'm a compulsive shopper. I buy anything and everything that tickles my fancy. About a quarter of my purchases are terrible, horrible mistakes (The Guild II, 7 Days to Die, etc.) that never get more than an hour's playtime before I uninstall them in disgust. I always regret buying those games, but that's the price of window shopping.

Then there are the games that are decent for a playthrough, maybe two, before I move on and forget about them. They tend to be solid games (Shadows of Mordor, Two Worlds II, Shadowrun, etc.) but nothing to write home about. They make up a good 65% of my library.

The last 10% are absolute masterpieces, that I will never tire of playing. I'm happy to say that ToME fits snugly into this category. I purchased it due to its aggregated review score and its resemblance to Dwarf Fortress, expecting that I'd get a week or two of enjoyment out of it before I got bored and moved on. Well, let me tell you, that is [b]not[/b] going to happen.

In a nutshell, I'd describe ToME as [b]a streamlined version of Dwarf Fortress adventure mode, with the emphasis shifted from proc-gen content to coherent and enjoyable adventures[/b]. Now, I know that some DF purists will be turned off by that description - after all, procedurally-generated worlds and histories are a big part of DF's appeal, aren't they? - but bear with me.

Whereas DF uses proc-gen to determine EVERYTHING, from cultures to the landmass to [url=mikaelisaksson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DF_Cheese.jpg]an individual's fascination with cheese[/url], ToME uses it sparingly. The world map, quests, and bosses stay relatively constant from playthrough to playthrough (though there are occasionally some small variations in the last category). This has allowed DarkGod (the one-man dev team behind ToME) to build an extremely long, complex, and open-ended plotline that will see players through 50 experience levels - and for the record, if you play roguelike mode, you'll have a hell of a time even breaking 20.

Where proc-gen is used, it is used very gracefully. All dungeons randomize their layouts (and to a lesser extent, their themes) for each new playthrough, and gear, with the notable exception of the rare, unique items, is also random. Minibosses, which randomly appear throughout dungeons after the initial quest has been completed, are all named, given a random race (anything from masses of worms to furry little Ewok slave-drivers), and given an arbitrary group of abilities. To put it simply, though the broad strokes of the game are fixed, the details of every run will be distinct and unique.

There`s one more aspect of the game that bears mentioning in reference to encouraging multiple playthroughs, and that`s character design. When you first start the game, approximately 75% of the classes, 50% of the races, and 66% of the game modes will be locked. Mind you, that still leaves you with something like 7 races and a dozen classes to choose from. As you complete certain events, various aspects of the game will be unlocked for future playthroughs. There`s nothing more exciting than unlocking a class encouraging an entirely new playstyle after a long, epic campaign.

Even within a single class, the room for freedom of choice is incredible. Every class has somewhere between 30-60 skills associated with it, each of which has five levels of expertise. In addition, you receive another 30 or so skills to choose from based on your race. Considering that even in a perfect playthrough, you`re only likely to get 160 skill points or so, you`ll never be wanting for new ideas for character builds. It bears mentioning that on top of all of this, there are ways to learn the skills of [i]other[/i] classes too.

I'm going to end this review with a quick pro/con list, since those are all the rage on Steam these days.

[b]PROS[/b]

-Nearly infinite replay value
-Strong RPG elements
-[b][u]Farscape references[/u][/b]. The world needs more Farscape.
-Moody, atmospheric music
-Incredibly detailed character creator
-Moddable
-Dedicated community and dev
-Lore-a-licious. If you like fictional worlds with a lot of backstory, you'll enjoy your time on Eyal.
-Surprisingly complex combat system, even for boring old sword-and-board builds
-No shortage of humour, without being a farce
-The option to play as a latex-clad Dwarven gimp with a wooden paddle

[b]CONS[/b]

-Most people will count the tile-based graphics as a con, though I find them pleasantly nostalgic
-Less complex than DF (pretty sure that applies to every game, though)
-The initial dungeons become old rather quickly for roguelike players, despite being randomized each time
-The randomized mini-bosses can occasionally feel a little unbalanced (in either direction)
-I can't play it 24/7",1422915489,1422916636,True,2,0,0.558212459087371826,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is hard to put down, and manages to just hit the sweet spot between difficult and rewarding combat. Make no mistake, while there are words on the screen at times, there's not much of a story or many boxes of text to work through - this project seems to be all about delivering on the gameplay experience, and manages to pull off a masterful example of roguelike ARPG games in the process.

I didn't want the ""starting"" excitement to overwhelm me.
After having played this game with several characters, I can say that every playthrough, I get more and more excited about this game. For me, this game is difficult and hardcore, I am not that experienced with rpg's but this game makes me want to be and every playthrough, I feel like I have learned new things.
For the first time, I carefully think about choices I make, what should I level up, how should I handle this enemy. For the first time, I take my time for every turn (usually with this kind of games, I rush through my turns as if it was real-time). The game makes me want to use my skills and intelligence and for me, this is a first-timer.

The funny thing is, I had this game marked as ""Not Interested"" originally, but came here by reading a review under another -not so good- game. That other game had much better graphics, but I don't care about graphics. On the other hand, because I had mostly been dissapointed by roguelikes with low-quality graphics (although TOME actually has relative good graphics for its genre) I had never looked at this game in detail. It was after that other review and seeing that people have actually spent a whole year in playtime on this game that I got interested.

That's sad... because this game is REALLY worth it. And it certainly is worth the price. I bought it at -30% and now I feel like they could easily charge 3x the price (and even more) and it would still be worth it. This game needs a commercial boost :-)

I am really enjoying this game, dying all the time and stuff like that. I prefer adventure-mode because I can die several times before it is game over, but I still don't want to die (like you could play through in exploration mode) so it still makes me try to play it roguelike (which is too hard for me at this time).

I also like how this game builds up unlocks: especially for me, being not that experienced, I like that in the beginning not all character types can be played and must be unlocked. It makes me build up my knowledge about the game and probably only when I am ready to learn about new types of character, they will be unlocked.

I wonder if I will stop buying other games on steam now for the next year because if I look at other people playing this game (2500 hours of playtime), it seems like I will never get bored with this game and will never need another game :-).

I think I can safely say that this game is for all kinds of RPG players: the beginners and the very experienced.

Buy it! Buy it now! :-)

This is by far one of the most addictiove games I have played in a log time. And it's hard, very hard.

Okay, so its a roguelike. But it has options to make it less unforgiving, up to a mode where you can just play en die and respawn untill you have enough. So, the casual player is catered to. Then there's a mode where you have limited lives - you can respawn, but only a few times. And of course the real roguelike - one life. Die, you're out of luck.

It's huge. I have been playing for hours and hours and so far have only made it to the 'second half' of the game twice. I am estimating that running a single game end-to-end will take you at least 4-6 hours. Though, I moght be a slowpoke - perhaps better, more experienced players can do it in a few hours less.

It's got possibilities. Like, there are so many ways to develop a character. So far I have been fiddling around with one class to see what get's me farther and farther into the game and that is working. You play, you die. Think, why did I die? Adapt in the next character.

It has a very smart way of lulling you into a false sense of security by allowing you to kill most critters on your path, then hit you from behind with some nasty rare radom boss.

There is mods out the various orifices too - enou8gh to adapt is to a format you like better.

Oh, I'd also like to add that there is a massive fanbase on the formums where the (I do believe it's one guy?) developer DarkGod hangs out too - and he actually posts, listens and helps out when you are in trouble.

Trust me - if you are into roguelikes or like fiddling around for aeons with character builds, this is something you want.

It was originally posted in January 2015 as ‘negative’, and is from March 2015 onwards rated as ‘positive.’ In addition, the content has been altered to reflect recent changes to the game.
First of all, know that this is not a ‘rogue-lite’. I have yet to see the final level, and there are others on the forums who have played for hundreds of hours and have yet to win the game. 
For the TL;DR people: The game is amazing, but completing it on normal difficulty will take hundreds of hours because the learning curve is steep, and end-game balance depends on creating the most powerful build you can – theory crafting is a must, and if you don’t, the game will become unwinnable 30 hours before you realize it. For the rest of us, read on.
ToME has 26 classes at the time of this writing, all of which feel and play very differently. Like most RPGs, skill points are gained upon leveling and can be used for both active and passive effects. The skills for each class are unique and allow players to develop their own playstyles, though generally each class has its own style of combat and a playstyle that rewards sticking to their class-specific strengths. Summoners draw hordes of creatures to overwhelm opponents, archmages channel elements to great effect over an area, and rogues set traps and use stealth to outmaneuver or outwit opponents. There are even more creative classes in here, like a time warden (or time mage) that specializes in temporal effects and paradoxes.
The world has tons of surprises and interesting levels/areas to explore, acceptable story and interaction (for an old-school roguelike) and though nothing ever changes, the vast variety of mechanics assured that the game did not get old for me after 100 hours of gameplay, and likely will not for another 100 hours.
But Tales of Maj’Eyal does have its problems. The first and perhaps least bothersome is a learning curve that feels more like a cliff than a slope.
The tutorial explains a little of the game's mechanics, but understanding is better gained by blundering through the world and slowly learning what each of the many confusing formulas and statistics mean, and how important they are to the core gameplay. It takes dedication to keep coming back when mountains of unknown skills and abilities assail you from every side, and through trial-and-error, learn to slowly overcome that mountain. Perseverance does pay off – I actually enjoyed the game very much once I crossed the barrier between hopeless bungler and still-hopeless-but-educated noob. 
The larger problem is that in order to win the game, the player’s character must be designed for perfection – built to optimal capacity with a full understanding of the many talents, stat formulas, status effects and saving throws present in the game engine. It’s not enough just to go with the most damage, or discover the best damage reduction, or center your build around strategic options – you must do all of these things, and do them with the dedication of a crazed League of Legends professional gunning for the gold.
This is where the game fell apart previously –it can become unwinnable very early on, and new players will never even know. They may even feel overpowered for a while, as they make one-strike KOs against hordes of enemies and pass tens of dungeons without a serious challenge in any of them. Rares, elites, and bosses fall without challenge - then suddenly, a belligerent abomination of a boss-class monstrosity strikes, and they find themselves hopelessly outmatched, their only recourse to grind for levels.
So they go to a new dungeon – and it happens again. Another new dungeon – wait, were the normals this hard before? And why can’t I use my spells? My abilities? Where did everyone go? And… how did I get one-shot by THAT? 
Players be warned: No matter how many lives you have, you can make a mistake in your character build early on and not realize that your character is doomed until late-game, when you have already invested thirty-or-more hours into their development. With permadeath, obviously, you may not live long enough to realize your character build is impossible to win with. But even with unlimited lives, you will eventually reach the point where the bosses are impossible, and no matter how well you fight, how clever your tactics, you have no option but to die – or quit. Before the 1.3.0 update, this meant that you must start the game over again from the beginning.
This is why my review changed from negative to positive. While limited and full-permadeath players will still have to deal with the intense frustrations of sub-optimal builds, there is hope for those playing with unlimited lives after the 1.3.0 update: Full talent re-spec is available at all times, so if you’ve created a build that seems sub-optimal to your playstyle or eventually becomes self-defeating, you can easily change your skills to accommodate your newfound knowledge or equipment. Be warned, however, that stat points and category points are still permanent, so consider playing a Cornac (+1 cat points) your first time and keeping some stat points in reserve for future use while you learn the ins and outs of your chosen class.
Also, be warned that there is no way to carry multiple save files for your character in this game. The game will save on entering and exiting a dungeon, as well as upon making most major decisions, and you will have to live with the consequences of your actions. 
So to recap: Tales of Maj'Eyal as it is an interesting game that supports a wide variety of skill sets and play styles, though impressive knowledge of the game mechanics that can only be acquired through vigilant study required to develop a successful playstyle. Full talent re-spec alleviates (but not eliminates) the steep learning curve, but if you like RPG roguelikes with unique classes and deep strategy, investing your time in this game will reward you with probably the best roguelike you’ve ever played. Just be prepared to invest heavily.
*Full disclosure here - I played the game on 'normal' difficulty for every playthrough. There is an easier difficulty that decreases the monsters' strength/abilities by 30%, but it does not give classes, races or achievements and so it does not appeal to those like me who want to feel they are accomplishing something while playing.",1420190843,1426653757,True,2,0,0.540380299091339111,14,True,False,False,False,,1420587661.0,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to do such a write-up, feedback is always good :)
To address some of the points more specifically:
[list]
[*] ""Easy"" difficulty mode only bars from achievements and those few unlocks tied to them. Most of the unlocks are not though.
[*] No way to do multiple saves is one of the defining features of Tales of Maj'Eyal, and roguelikes in general. Though I fully understand that this may not be for every player, but no game is :)
[*] If you have in mind specific scenarios where playing becomes impossible due to some choices, I would like if you could take some time to make a list on the forums. This is the kind of things I'd rather fix than let go stale
[*] Last but not least, this makes me realize that there is indeed a need for something else. What if in Exploration mode (infinite lives), full talents respec was always available ? This is a special mode designed for players that want to casually see the game / story so this would not impede on the most hardcore players.

Suggested for:
-Those who do not mind losing more often than winning.
-Those who enjoy games with unlockable content.
-Those who actually read in-game lore.  There is a LOT of that.
-Those who excel in tactical combat and character-building.

My Favorite Pros:
-Plenty of options for characters.
-There is an overworld map.
-The Summoner class is actually balanced.
-That feeling of anticipation that comes with every single character level.
-Fantastic music.

My Annoyed-At Cons:
-Those freaking Bone Golems...
-Those freaking adventuring parties...
-That freaking sealed area with Green Dragons...
-That freaking sandworm dungeon...
-THAT FREAKING SANDWORM DUNGEON...!
-Why is the sandworm dungeon so necessary?!

It's fairly forgiving, in that you can start on easy mode, with unlimited lives (but no achievements) to figure things out, then once you've got the hang of it, you can change it up to a harder version. 

If you're someone who has to get every achievemnt though, this game will take a LOT of your time. I first got it from DarGod's website, played it for a hundered plus hours, then heard it was on steam, so I bought it here too (on a friends shared account) and started playing it. I earned a hundred or so achievements before I just started playing under my account. And then I realized that I had to re-earn those achievements. I felt better when I realized that those hundred I earned? not even 15% of the total possible. Yeah, that's right, there's not 100, not 200, but over 1300 achievements for this game.

So like I said if you need to have EVERY achievement, this will take you some time, especially since at least one of the achievements is nearly impossible. You have to beat the optional boss, who is a super archmage/god (not kidding about that, it's part of the amazing in-depth lore of this game) on the hardest difficulty setting, with one life. Oh yeah, and she can come back to life a few times. Oh, and she gets stronger each time she does it. And she is in the middle of a town full of mages, who also attack you. But at least you can attack first, right?

So for those who don't want to spend the next 3 years trying to get that achievement, it's still an amazing game, with good graphics (for a roguelike) a great story, fun unlock systems, and interesting combat.

Pra começar, o jogo possui duas opções para regular a dificuldade e não restringir a jogatina apenas aos mais hardcores. É possível jogar no modo roguelike (apenas 1 vida), adventure (começa com 4 vidas e recebe outras ao passar os níveis, totalizando 7 no final) e exploration (vidas ilimitadas), além das dificuldades easier, normal, nightmare, insane e madness (que mudam entre outras coisas o nível dos inimigos encontrados). Isso permite que você escolha um jogo mais casual ou mais hardcore, algo que não é tão comum em roguelikes.

Os gráficos não são importantes aqui. O que conta é a jogabilidade. Com a expansão são 28 classes e 10 raças, diversas combinações possíveis (algumas não tão eficazes) e várias horas de jogo caso deseje explorar todas as possibilidades de personagens. Cada classe possui habilidades únicas e saber jogar com uma não quer dizer que você terá sucesso com as outras.

A história do jogo é OK. Nada tão inovador, mas ainda assim interessante.

Outro ponto positivo é que o criador do jogo (DarkGod) está sempre interagindo com a comunidade no fórum oficial do jogo, então é fácil relatar qualquer problema, tirar dúvidas ou dar sugestões.

Esteja preparado para morrer algumas vezes antes de aprender o básico.

Every time I went hunting for a new roguelike, I'd find ToME, look at the screenshots, wrinkle my nose at the tileset, and move on.

A combination of peer pressure and exasperation at the four million half-baked early access games I'm waiting on finally tipped me over the edge to get it -- and I'm glad I did. Finally. I've been missing a lot of fun.

So! Here's what I'm digging about ToME:

1. Maybe this is mentioned in the reviews for it, and I've just somehow always glossed over it, but ToME has a really interesting set of skills that rely on various energy bars, cooldowns, and other variables. Even my very-straight-forward berserker has a hopping action bar that's a handful to manage. Honestly, it reminds me (pleasantly) of MMO combat.

2. It's not early access. Invictus, I take back every eye-roll I ever aimed at you for avoiding the early access games I'd recommend to you, because I'm there now. Holy mother of pogo-jumping Christ, is it pleasant to play a game that's finished and working and not possibly maybe someday in the future going to not suck, honest.

3. There's a global chat where everyone currently playing ToME can talk with eachother. I'm really enjoying this, even though it's usually just a ticker for achievements and the new and exciting ways people are finding to die. Occasionally conversations or questions will spring up. Feeling like a single-player game has a shared community is a new thing to me, I guess.

I only have two quibbles with the game, and they're utterly cosmetic: some of the tunes aren't so hot (and all of them are short enough that the repetition wears on you very quickly), and I really don't like the tileset. It's what has put me off getting the game multiple times over the past years. They're too complex to hit my pixel-art happy buttons, and too amateurish to look good. It's some kinda tepid middle-ground, designed-by-committee tileset that makes Baby Jesus cry.

- fantastic replay value (so many race / class combinations to try... each of them interesting... unlockables for challange)
- polite community (when u stuck,,, just hit space and type your question...someone will help you on)
- did i mention replay value (ok, some mega-corruptor-resistant-to-all-i-got geeked me on my last run... so now i try THIS fancy build  and hand him his a$$ when i meet him next run. oh no! theres another illuminous-horror-ranged-damage-laugh-at-your-sword... and so on... but im gonna beat this game, if its the last thing i do on this planet)

- there is tons of fantastic text and lore in this game (that you dont have to read at all, if you dont like reading)... someone has put a lot of love and talent into this... every freaking sword you stumble across comes with a name like Cornull the Vorpal Wagranizer or whatever... and there is so much background information on the world youre in (that you can completly ignore if you are more like bashing through hordes of monsters and grabbing their loot... its background,,, if you want it it is there, but you dont have to)

+ The price is super low - You could buy this game 8 or 9 times for the price of one AAA game.
+ Active development - Last update was about 2 weeks before this review.

Potential Negatives:
- You're going to die - a lot. Some frustration will be had. 
- Graphics are nothing special, although it does come in old-school @ style display (which I use).
- Not the best music, put on your favorite album instead.

Mais aussi des trucs plus variés comme le Cursed combattant qui doit entretenir sa haine en se bastonnant tous le temps pour éviter de devenir trop faible. Le chronomancer aux pouvoirs permettant de manipuler le temps ( le jeu utilise un système de sauvegarde bien penser pour simuler ce genre de chose ) dont les sorts deviennent de plus en plus puissants mais de plus en plus dangereux quand ils accumulent des paradoxes.
En début de jeu on a peu de choix, mais petit à petit on débloque les classes les plus complexes. ( enfin pour l'instant moi j'ai débloqué que les summoners  )
Un petit coté social, si l'on se crée un compte sur le site nos personnages et ""achievement"" y sont enregistré. Quand on joue en étant loggué on a accès dans le jeu à un channel irc etc... ( ma page est là d'ailleurs )
Un jeu qui évolue vite, j'avais testé le truc il y a un an et c'était beaucoup moins intéressant. Là le jeu est clairement encore déséquilibré mais c'est bien parti pour être comme Crawl un des nouveaux ""gros"" roguelike.

Tales of Maj'Eyal does a good job of easing a new player into the world and game mechanics by restricting the initial race and class offerings and expands outward with a number of persistent unlockables including new races, classes, and items that will become available to your future characters as you progress forward through additional sessions.  The distinct classes (particularly with different race pairings) provide tremendously distinct play styles that will keep you on your toes and force you to adjust your gameplay to find success.

That was my starting point with ToME(4), aka Tales of Maj'Eyal.  I'm not really a fan of the genre, though I am a fan of tactical RPGs.  It was only after some interesting comments on another game forum (Grim Dawn, great game, look it up) that I decided to give ToME a try.

Unlike some other rogue-likes, ToME gives you the option to play softcore.  There are varying difficulty levels in addition to different degrees of 'rogue-like-ness' (multiple lives; from 1 to infinite).  The classes vary from basic and simple (Bulwark, Rogue, Archmage, etc) to surprisingly unique (Mindslayer, Oozemancer, Solipsist, etc).  The unlock system can be a pain, but it does encourage you to progress through the game, explore and play various archetypes.

The lore is great; the world has been excellently crafted (imo).  While it doesn't read like a AAA novel, the depth of the backstory is pretty astonishing considering it's been done primarily by one man (props Darkgod).

When it comes to the gameplay, everything is surprisingly newbie-friendly (for a rogue-like).  The UI is simple and easy, the controls are variable (keyboard and/or mouse, re-bindable) and the overly-complex item usage often found in the genre has been notably streamlined.  

The graphics are solid.   Now, take that with a grain of salt; this is a 2d game of tiles and sprites.  If you're anticipating something like Dragon Age, you're going to be disappointed.  I know that I was unpleasantly surprised.  That being said, it has definitely grown on me and it certainly gives enough information on what's happening.

All that being said, this IS a roguelike.  You WILL walk around a corner/open a door/open a chest and get exploded.  Careful, cautious play is highly encouraged.

Overall, if you find yourself wanting to try out a roguelike but finding they are a little too 'hardcore' for you, give ToME a try.  It's the only roguelike that I have found myself returning to, time after time.",1415421720,1415421720,True,481,11,0.956077456474304199,9,True,False,False,False,,,

You choose from a variety of races and a variety of classes, and even more can be unlocked of each. Depending on your race and/or class, you'll start out in a specific Zone(or dungeon if you'd like). Once you finish that Zone, or before, you can return the World Map, in which you can explore it looking for more dungeons, or look for towns in which you can purchase items or find quests.

This isn't like The Elder Scrolls, where most of the game is scaled to your level or ability, each Zone has a certain difficulty, and until you're more familiar with how difficult each one is, it's better to follow the quest log. It's true that with very careful and skillful management of your spells and/techniques that you can finish a Zone that's a bit higher than you level, but there's a limit that's very quickly reached.

Each of the Zones layouts are randomly generated, though they always have the same theme(forest, cave, dungeon, etc.). However, the World Map is mostly static, meaning it doesn't shift too much between games. There are 4 main towns in the beginning for instance, 3 of them having 2 beginner Zones right next to them. These 4, and their Zones, are always in the same spot. While there are a couple more Zones that are found in the same spot, the location of all the other Zones(mostly the 'side' ones) shifts around the map between games

For the actual skills you use, they're divided up into 2 categories: Class and Generic. Class skills are like they sound: each Class has many skill trees with for skills in each, and it's up to you how you want to level them, though some trees have a level requirement. Then there's Generic. This category is mostly the same between Classes, however some Classes add an extra Generic tree or 2. Many Races also have extra Generic trees, though Races with buffs or extra trees are of course balanced in other ways.

Each Race has different bonuses and penalties to their stats, health, and experience rate, along with their Race Specific Generic Trees. So obviously some Races will be better suited to certain play styles. While some races and classes cannot be used together for Story/lore reasons, all class/race combinations are viable throughout the game, though you may need to play a bit smarter in some cases. One last thing about races: While they all have bonuses and penalties, the 'Cornac Human' is the exception in that it has no bonuses, no extra Generic Trees, and no penalties of any sort, and I recommend that if you want to try a new class but don't know what to expect, the 'Cornac Human' is a good default choice. Oh wait, Cornacs start with 1 category point, as some categories need to be unlocked with a point before you can start investing in it's skills, You can also just use the Category Point to give yourself an extra Infusion/Rune Slot, I'll talk more of this later.

As for items, they are Armor, Weapons, Jewellery, Tools, and Infusions/Runes. All items except Infusions/Runes are randomly generated for the most part, the exception being Legendary/Unique items, which are always the same, but have very unique bonuses and sometimes penalties. They sometimes even give you a skill(with a cooldown), though Tools always give a skill while they are worn.

Infusions/Runes are items which will pretty much let you 'equip' a skill, such as Healing, Regen, etc. You only have so many slots though. All classes and races, no matter the combination, start with 3 slots. When you get a Category point every 5 levels(or first if you're a Cornac), you can opt to use it to give you an extra slot. If you try to use an Infusion/Rune when all slots are filled, you'll be asked if you want to replace a currently equipped Infusion/Rune. If you do so, you do NOT get it back.

I'll cut the review short here, else I'll waffle all day. I definitely recommend this game for any roguelike and/or RPG fan. Please keep in mind that there is a free version on their site. This version is the paid version, in which it gives you an item vault(that must be reached through a semi-difficult dungeon) with a few slots to transfer items or store them between characters. The paid version also has an extra class to play with, along with an extra mode. The extra class I won't name as it changes. The most recently added class is for the paid version only. When a new one is added, the previous one becomes free. The extra game mode is 'Exploration', which is the same as normal, but gives you unlimited lives.

Please note that the DLC listed below is not a part of the free version, though they can also be purchased on their and played in the DRM free version.",1415336648,1415336648,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Nice and deep, complex, with many different options with which to slay my enemies in any singular class, wait, what was I talking about again?

Tales of Maj'Eyal encompasses everything I love about roguelikes, everything I like about MMOs, and everything I LOVE about RPGs.

It has the typical roguelike grid-locked movement and combat system, plus projectiles have a fly speed, which means that you can dodge projectiles by sidestepping if they're slow enough that you can catch them midair. Every being has a global speed rating, too, so a slow mage with 75% global speed will often be double-turn-ed on by enemies often and won't be able to dodge many projectiles, whereas a rogue with 127% global speed will often be able to act twice in a ""turn"" and sidestep most projectiles! The speed system really does make such a big difference. Additionally, just like in roguelikes, if your character bites the dust they're gone... However unlike roguelikes you have three difficulty settings: Roguelike, Adventure and ...Endless, I believe? Whatever, the point is... Roguelike is roguelike: If your character dies, they kick the bucket for good. In Endless, you get to ressurrect every single time. However, Adventure is interesting. In Adventure, you work through lives--as you level and achieve things, you gain extra lives... but they're finite. So once you kick the bucket, the nameless cosmic tentacle-entity that keeps reviving you like a dunce for somehow loses interest and lets you fall into the void.

It borrows a few cool mechanics from MMOs too, namely the randomized loot system and many skill trees. Unlike MMOs, however, it ops for having many, MANY skill trees that are 100% linear with four steps, divided into two categories: Class trees, and Generic trees. Class trees are native to your class--a Rogue gets Trapitude, an Alchemist gets Golemancy, so on, so forth. Generic trees, on the other hand, you qualify for; being a Cunning-based class with high Cunning gives you access to the Survival tree; being a Wilder grants you access to the Wild Gift tree, so on so forth. On levelups you gain a Class point and a Generic point, as well as several Stat Points and, on particular levels, Category points. A Category point lets you unlock locked skill trees, or upgrade the potency of one you already had! Like I said: Deep and complex. Like coffee, I suppose?

And of course, from RPGs, it borrows the everything else. A vast world rich in story, with cool sidequests and enemy design and... this isn't RPG-native. what am i... i need to go sit down.

yes cool story, cool sidequests, cool enemies, someone pass me the coffee, wait i dont even drink coffee

Lets start at the begining. I am an old-school gamer at heart. I started gaming in the early 80's and was only recently introduced to the roguelike genre, which has actually been my favorite genre for about 2 years now. I know Rogue was put out in 80 or 81, but for whatever reason I never got into this genre (perhaps it is because I played alot of consoles at that time?). My first introduction to roguelikes was BoI, among other actual 'roguelites'.

Anyways, I know the whole Berlin Interpretation of what a roguelike is, but really in the sense of ToME and others, it is just a great RPG with permadeath. This requires you to really take your time and think about your actions. Playing drunk, or while on the phone is certain death, am-I-right? 

Tales of Maj'Eyal has a really neat universe set in place, with a great UI that is all keyboard based (although you can use the mouse, it is debatably less efficient). Compared to other 'true' roguelikes, this game has a great tileset and overall graphics that are very much appreciated. When you equip armor, so does your avatar. There is rain, mist, etc. 

Keep in mind you can get this game for free from the developers website, but you shouldn't. Donate, or buy it on Steam (basically a donation). Pay for it because this is top notch game developement. YOU WILL GET DOZENS OF HOURS OUT OF THIS. At least. 

It is not multiplayer, but it is the first MSORPG... Thats right - Massive Single Player Online RPG. Its brilliant. You play your own game, yet are in constant chat with the rest of the world. There is even some sort of item sharing in this chat that I haven't used yet. Best part - no need for a Wiki - I simply ask a questions (I've asked dozens) and some kind soul always has an awesome response. Awesome community that is very helpful.

TL;DR

10/10 This is how game developement is done.",1414707664,1414707664,True,11,2,0.63497394323348999,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My first roguelike was Castle of the Winds back in the mid-90s. I've since played other traditional RLs such as NetHack, as well as ""roguelike-inspired"" games such as the Diablo series and Path of Exile. ToME4 combines the best of both worlds in a package that is user-friendly, engaging, and extremely entertaining.

The problem with traditional roguelikes, by modern standards, is the poor user interface and sometimes opaque game mechanics. Their replay potential is very high, but the barrier to entry is equally high. ToME4 keeps the high replay factor while providing excellent GUI. It has full support for both mouse and keyboard controls. Information that would be relegated to wikis for other roguelikes is instead readily available to the player, which gives a very streamlined playing experience. You can jump right into ToME4 and start playing without having to spend hours reading. That's not to say the game is easy, however; I've put well over 100 hours into the game and I'm still nowhere close to finishing the primary campaign.

On the other side, this game takes some of the best features of action RPGs (e.g., Diablo) while avoiding the pitfalls of that genre. There's a strong element of character progression and customization, through complex gear as well as skills, and many race/class options. However, ToME4 avoids the grinding/farming gameplay that plagues most ARPGs because enemies in ToME4 don't respawn. You progress through the world and clear the various areas, but you can't stay in an easy section and kill endless monsters for loot and experience.

I originally downloaded this game for free from the ToME4 website, but after playing for a few days I bought it on Steam to support the developer (and get some extra unlocks in game!). This game is a phenomenal value and a must-try for any gamer.

It has several notable changes from other roguelikes, foremost it's abilities system use a variety of different resources and are mostly about managing cooldowns. There's no health/mana pot chugging here which takes some of the tedium away from stacking potions to thinking about which abilities to use when. 

Also, the storyline and overworld is static, while individual level layout and most npcs are randomized. This has it's own plus and minuses. Each area has it's own lore and strategy which planning for is part of the game and you wouldn't be able to do as much for completely randomized dungeons. On the other hand, if you are like me and like to rush to your death and try as many classes as possible, replaying the same quests and areas can start getting a little boring. However the game has a lot of different content and several starting areas to help alleviate the tedium of replaying the same starting areas over and over for each character.

C'est clairement un des meilleurs jeux auquel je n'ai jamais joué (LE meilleur jeux solo).

Ce jeu est extrêmement riche.
Déjà +100 heures dessus, et je n'ai toujours pas essayé toutes les classes.

Excellent RPG/Roguelike au tour par tour.
Des tonnes de stuff à looter.
Des centaines de talents différents à essayer, débloquer, combiner.

Pour dire la vérité j'ai eu du mal à me plonger dans ce jeu. La première fois que j'ai lancé le tutorial, je n'ai pas accroché...
Les animations (il n'y en a quasiment pas) ne me plaisaient pas, les graphismes de la forêt m'ennuyaient, et j'étais perdu dans le choix des talents et des techniques. 

Du coup je l'ai laissé de côté, avant d'y revenir un mois plus tard, pour tester...
Et alors là j'ai réussi à me plonger dans son univers.
Il y'a plein de choses à débloquer, comme de nouvelles races, classes, talents, des lieux, etc. 

Il y'a une fonction EXTRAORDINAIRE, pour ceux qui le souhaitent: ""autoexplore"". Grâce à cette touche votre personnage va explorer la map tout seul, à la vitesse de l'éclair.
Car même si les cartes sont aléatoires, moi ça m'ennuye parfois de devoir explorer le moindre recoin. 
Mais avec tales of maj'eyal, j'appuye sur un touche et mon perso explore, ramasse les loots, automatiquement jusqu'à ce qu'un ennemi soit dans les parages. 

Ce jeu est fait par un passioné des RPG/Roguelike, et ça se voit!
Il y'a plein de trucs comme l'autoexplore. Le sac-sans-fin-pour-les-loots, la vente des loots inutiles automatiques, la possibilité de sauvegarder à n'importe quel moment, etc. 
Bref, tout un tas de truc qui rendent l'epérience de jeu plus agréable, de se concentrer sur l'essentiel, d'éviter la répétition ennuyeuse.

Cerise sur le gateau, le créateur de ce jeu continue à travailler dessus ! Et tous les 1-2 mois il y'a du nouveau contenu GRATUIT. 

En plus en achetant ce jeu sur steam, ça vous permet dès le level 10-12, de pouvoir stocker de l'équipement pour de futurs parties.
Par exemple avec mon mage j'ai trouvé une superbe hache-à-deux-mains épique, que j'ai pu stocker pour un futur guerrier.

Si vous aimez les roguelike, RPG au tour par tour, vous allez adorer ce jeu.

Et pour ceux qui comme moi seraient un peu perdu avec tous ces talents, tous ces dongeons, je vous conseille de passer par la section ""guide"" de steam.

If you have played roguelikes in the past, dont let the trailers give you the wrong impression of its interface or themes.  The game is actually quite good.

A few technical details first.  The game is available for free on the creator's website.  Buying the game on steam unlocks some donator benefits such as a specific dotator only character class and item transfer between characters.  The game also has its own login, this is to use the site's statistics tracking features, cloud saves (IIRC), and also lets you access an official IRC channel from within the game client itself.  You do not need to login to play the game.  The game performs very well, no complaints.  The game has a great deal of accessibility features, such as a very functional tileset, mouse controls, hud rescaling, and some automation as well.  Overall, very accessible.

In terms of game design, I have a few things to comment on.  I very much enjoy roguelikes that have a storyline element such as this one, because it gives a good element of cohesion to the game with goals and progression.  This one actually has a number of class or race specific scenarios that help add to this as well.

The game's skill progression system is skill-tree based, with each class having at least two different themed trees with several branches along with more generic ones to give you a few options on how you want to play your character.  For example, a necromancer might have both minion summoning and debuff curses with two trees each to pick between.  Many skills intuitively synergize or benefit each other, and the play also has the ability to acquire out-of-class skills a few times per game for even more flexibility.  The last few skill points can be unspent while in towns if you dislike a recent skill choice, and skills also show the effect of adding an additional skillpoint before you spend them, as well as what character stats influence the variables of those skills.  I find this skill tree system more accesible than a train/abuse stat system present in many other roguelikes, and while the transparency is not perfect it is VERY welcome.

The game's combat, as in all perma-death roguelikes, is focused on limiting situations in which you experience risk.  As in all roguelikes this means things like bottlenecking enemies into more controlled environments and crown control, but more notably lies in escape skills for this game.  Being able to leave a situation you will not be able to survive is very crucial in this game, as you almost always cannot simly heal through or face-tank some enemies.  You will be fighting a lot of enemies in this game and the game is quite long, but the game gives you both difficulty and permadeath options so that you may play the game in a method that you enjoy.  The default setting for permadeath gives you a number of lives, and you can accrue a limited number of additional lives at certain milestones in the game, thus letting you maintain risk without letting a single careless mistake end a heavy investment of game hours.

The game's replayability more or less lies in two things.  First, many zones have an alternate version of their randomly maps which have varied enemies and difficulty from their originals.  These can be surprising to discover after your first playthrough.  The second is in trying out different race / class combinations, of which there are quite a few with a good variety of options.

There's quite a bit I could talk about, but more or less I'd reccomend this game.  It can be a pretty heavy time investment, as most traditional-style roguelikes can be, but its a pretty darn good one for a modern era!",1413626342,1413626342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is 2D and turn based, preferring gameplay and depth over graphical wizardry.

One important distinction between TOME and other roguelikes is the lack of emphasis on procedural generation. TOME actually has a plot, one that spans continents and the void between worlds, a story of darkness, magic and of course world domination. Throughout each playthrough, the story is the same, albeit with some slight alterations/additions depending on the actions you take and the starting class you select. There is a world map, and the major story locations do not change. Although the layout of each dungeon is procedurally generated, this is not empasised as a selling point of the game - it is merely a tool used to highlight the other qualities this game possesses. And boy are there a lot of qualities.

First and foremost - the character classes. Good luck finding a more comprehensive, deep and exciting set of classes in any other roguelike, or any other GAME for that matter. TOME has over 15 of these, ranging from the stalwart Bulwark to the insidious Shadowblade to the righteous Sun Paladin, TOME has you covered for any kind of playstyle you wish to try. Each class then has a vast array of talent branches to follow, and the branches you choose to develop will essentially create a subset of the class you have chosen. The customisation possibilities are massive, resulting in a lot of replayability and tactical flexibility.

Combat is a highly tactical turn based affair, with a strong emphasis on positioning, cooldowns, and your innate knowledge of your own abilities versus your opponent's. Once within your view, every enemy you encounter can be right-clicked on to view their statistics, abilities (passive and active) and resistances. There are no consumables in TOME. The use of each of your skills and items works on a cooldown system, and managing these cooldowns effectively will make the difference between you slaying a boss or becoming a small stain on a tower floor.

And believe me, the latter will happen far more often than the former if you're not prepared, because TOME is HARD. Hard as in one-hit-kill hard. Hard as in the game gives you 3 options - Rogulike (1 life), Adventure (gain lives as you level up) and Exploration (infinite lives) - and taking the Roguelike option early on will result in tears. Hard as in some of the more powerful enemies in the game are comprised of two separate random character classes, and God help you if you face one with two even remotely synergistic classes under its belt.

And to be honest, if there's one thing that drives me nuts about TOME, it is the difficulty. No doubt this makes me a console casual, but I'm serious. The difficulty of TOME is not embedded within the general gameplay, such as a game like Dark Souls, but rather in its frightening inconsistency of enemy threat. The existence of enemies with randomly combined abilities, together with the fact that there are over 10 different damage types (Fire Cold Darkness Light Mind Temporal Blight Nature bleh) means that at some point (normally after you've spent 10 minutes breezing through a horde of useless trash mobs) you will suddenly bump into a Godlike terror that sends you screaming into the abyss of death with a single, sloppy blink, simply due to having the perfect storm of resistances, abilities and relative level that results in a big tick in the Rekt column. Despite my affection for this wonderful, deep and mechanically interesting game, it is also by far the game I have rage-quitted the most.

TL:DR Version....

Good - Excellent character classes, tactical combat and involving storyline.

Bad - Insane difficulty spikes

I mean, beside being such a complex game created and maintained by one dev, it has dozen of features and things that make it even better:
- Humor. Dialogues, story, everything is filled with dark, hidden, or obvious humor. Even the achievements have sometimes the best names I've ever seen (""I cleared the room of death and all I got was this lousy achievement!"")
- Death. You can probably die a thousand times differently. 
- Death (again). You can choose to have an amount of lives to spend, or you can go in full Roguelike-Permadeath-Nightmare/Madness difficulty, but in that game, you will die a lot, that's for sure.
- Network. No multiplayer, but just a global chat, that also let you know when another payer achieves something, or DIES. So you know you're not alone.
- MOD THAT GAME TO DEATH
- You have so many classes and races to play as and to combine in the vanilla, you probably won't even know what to play anymore after you modded the game to death. There is probably a character-mod for every single creature in the game. There is even a mod that allows you to play as a TREE.
- B*tch, I'm a Mega Turtle Storm Knight
- The story is a big part of the game. TomE isn't a simple randomly-generated-try-or-die-exploring-maze Roguelike. It has continents, locations, races, people, events of the past, yeah, a story.
- B*tch, I'm a Star Elf Paradox Mage
- There are so many items, you don't know if it's possible to have something balanced in that. And a lot of the items have a story, and special abilities. Also, you're not limited, in terms of what you wanna wear. Wanna be a human mage that shoots fire with his sword ? Go ahead.

game play is a bit repetive but that is kind of expected. 


there is a lot of class content. items are very diablo or mmo like. lots of magic very little is useful.

Tons of content, and it's even free. I must have played like 200 hours before acquiring it on steam, because DarkGod deserves the money, and a game like this for this low price is almost a steal, 

The game starts out being relatively simple to play, with few races and classes avaliable, and few complicated mechanics, but as you progress in your runs and do different stuff, you unlock interesting new races and classes.

Hell, you can time travel. TIME. TRAVEL.

One of the best parts is that, in order to unlock classes and races, you have to do some pretty interesting things. For example, unlocking mages requires that you find the existence of mages, and some important finds affect later playthroughs, like finding the anti-magic people of Zigur or a certain chest that once you find all your characters start with.

This game is so awesome, that it helped me stay sane during a week of post-surgery lying face-down on a hospital bed.

I reccomend this. Seriously, if you like roguelikes and don't mind text, give this a try for free at te4's page, and I strongly reccomend buying it, it barely gives you features, mostly cosmetic ones, but something of this scale deserves a purchase, and for this price, it is well worth it.

Tons of classes, unlockables and a huge map to explore, you will need a lot of time to beat it.

It's quite hard to get used with the controls. Also, you have the choice of exploring a map manually with the arrows or automaticly with the ""Z"" button.

It's complex, yet doesn't ever leave the player wondering. Every detail has explanations that explain the effects; for example, leveling up primary stats (eg, vitality, strength, etc) will show the effects on secondary stats (eg, crit chance, health, etc).

Players are encouraged to play in order to unlock additional races, classes, game types, etc. In my first run, I stumbled across a zoo -- and died shortly after. However, I unlocked the summoner class because I had come across a zoo.

In another play through, I finished the first quest and headed to the town. In town, I agreed to fight 3 elite warriors in order to prove myself worthy of the arena. I was afraid that I would die again -- after all, I was doing so well in this run. It paid off because winning unlocked the Arena game mode.

I would add that he vast number of achievements also helps replayability, except that there are over 1300 achievements. This will be pretty frustrating for anyone looking for 100% achievement completion.

What makes TOME so great is the way it is designed allows it to be incredibly easy to get into for a beginner but still have enough depth and complexity for an advanced player, and unlike traditional Roguelikes where you try to survive through one really big hard dungeon this has you survive through many mini-dungeons with an overworld map you can explore.

Game mechanics are incredibly solid, stuff is for the most part well balanced and you can advance in the game well enough as any class really. It abandons the traditional roguelike mechanic of potion spam to heal and instead replaces it with a heal over time ability you can upgrade. There are no random deaths / mechanics that require you to have played the game already in order to know how to not die in this game either.

Personally I think the game has one of the better loot systems for a roguelike, it's almost Action RPG-esque really.

This is an [b]incredibly[/b] minor con here but the graphics aren't as good as other modern roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. That said, if you really like roguelikes like I do graphics are probably one of the things you care about the least.

И так:
  - графика, она в играх такого плана не главное, но все же. Она наляписта, отдельно элементы нормальны, но в сочетании часто получается каша со всего. Также отдельные уровни скучны сами по себе, скучны и однообразны. Некоторые места наоборот - ""вырви глаз"". Очень часто врагов заметить сложно. Сталкивался даже на отдельных уровнях с тем, что сложно понять где свой персонаж. Также стоить отметить свои правила ""игры"", например есть два куба земли или стенки в плотную соприкасающиеся углами, визуально, между ними нет прохода, иногда даже стенка наискось, но оказывается вы можете пройти в этом месте, магия, да и только;

  - интерфейс убог, уже вышло сто игр с плохим или хорошим интерфейсом, неужели разработчикам сложно взять лучшее?

  - в игре монстры не привязаны к определенным местностям, например лисицы будут нападать на вас как в лесу, в подземелье, в параллельном мире, в пещере под водой, итд.. То есть мы блуждаем по миру, а на нас тупо сыпят рандомно монстров, некоторая привязка все же есть кое где, но это не спасает общее впечатление;

  - нет нормальной архитектуры, я имею в ввиду что, например здания это или прямоугольник с дверью или абстрактная площадь окруженная стенами. Это относится всего, построения уровней и лакаций. Я понимаю что игра генерирует уровни, но ни кто не мешал продумать отдельные элементы.

  - очень часто, вернее почти каждый раз (после знакомства) игра превращается в истребление мобов уровень за уровнем ради прокачки.  Квесты которые должны разнообразить игру, даются до подземелья или в нем, и по сути предполагают пройти его до конца, то есть ни чего не меняют. Есть некоторые мелочи, как например провести странника до телепорта, которые немного разбавляют мобо-мясорубку, но их мало и они очень часто повторяются, в последствии тоже приедаются.

  - боевка вроде бы и имеет потенциал, но все сводится к определенным стандартным комбинациям, радуют лишь босы, вокруг которых нужно потанцевать.
 
 Вообщем, для меня игра оказалась затянута, бесцельна и скучна. От того, какое подземелье вы выберете или попадете, ничего не изменится, зачищайте стандартным способом независимо - кислотный лес это или подземелье. Более дальние подземелья - более сложны, более близкие - более просты. Все сводится к погоне за лутом и прокачкой.",1410100631,1410101993,False,30,2,0.615196943283081055,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Плюсы:
+ Графика и сам сеттинг игры почти как в настолке, только кубик не кидаешь.
+ Приятная музыка
+ Много локаций, монстров, шмоток.
+ Система статов и умений практически идеальна.
+ Большое число вариантов прокачки, каждый найдет свое
+ Рандомно генерируемые монстры, которые дают незабываемый экшон

Минусы:
- Графону порадуются настолкофаги, но Дивинити Оригинал Син конечно намного круче.
- Нет русского языка (но не критично, я все понял, а это о многом говорит)

Вывод. Играть в эту игру и покупать ее, особенно со скидкой однозначно стоит. Если бы не было Дивинити Оригинал Син, то назвал бы игру чуть ли не лучшей РПГ последних лет = D

It also does many small things well that you don't often see. Wearing different equipment actually changes your characters appearance, item variety is quite impressive, so on and so forth.

If you're scared of the difficulty of a roguelike there are also options to give you more/unlimited lives, as well as difficulty settings, so you can ease yourself in if you wish.

-easy inventory management (throw all your potions and scrolls away!)
-great enemy variety, further made interesting by rare enemies that have skills seemingly beyond their scope of ability (that bone giant did just smite you with the power of the sun).
-excellent random loot generation system that makes other RPGs jealous.
-different difficulty and lives settings for players of different experience and skill levels.
-very extensive mod support, with some interesting mods that change up the game already in existence.
-a usually helpful in-game chat.
-fairly frequent and very substantial updates that keep classes interesting.

As in, you shouldn't really count of ToME in the same group as Nethack, ADoM, or even Crawl. ToME is, first of all, much more focused on combat. There is no hunger, very little inventory management, very few ways (none?) to lose your character outside of actual combat.

(for clarity: bump attack means an automatic attack that happens as your character attempts to enter a space occupied by a hostile character. Yeah, autoattack)

The combat doesn't much remind the bump/cast combat of most roguelikes. It's more like WoW, turn based. And I don't mean this in a bad way. Most turns you have to use skills even as a melee character, as opposed to bump attacking like you probably would in most actual roguelikes. There are a lot of skills, considering the game currently has at least 25 classes, many of which have multiple unique skill lines (each containing 4 skills). 

Now, let's get this out of the way: the game is free, unless you really want to buy it on Steam, or otherwise. The game is also easily worth the Steam price, and much more besides. A single playthrough can be easily over 10 hours, and the game has a lot of replayability. It is fun.

Downsides? Having played this a lot (though not nearly as much as some), I'd say: the normal difficulty is way too easy, with some exceptions. The higher difficulties aren't viable on some classes (the higher you go, the less viable melee is, in general), and getting oneshot becomes increasingly an issue. There are ways to deal with getting oneshot, but they usually involve tedious gameplay. Like, using certain spells to check what's behind every corner, always. I personally *hate* playing like that, so currently I can either play on too easy difficulties, or play on challenging difficulties with random oneshotting mobs. Mind, you can easily get several playthroughs (like, 30h+) worth playtime before encountering this issue.

This game is a very good roguelike. Im still missing stuff like unidentified items blessed/cursed items or a hunger bar.
But his game is still very komplex every character has its own mechanics and skilltrees. not just the basic stats that are higher or lower depending on the class. So everytime you play another class its actually a new experience.
The Worldmap is somewhat fixed  just a few dungeons are placed randomly but the entire dungeons are randomly generated and can even have different themes for example an icy mountain might be an active volcano in a different playthrough.
This game has a lot of content still coming.
If you enjoy oldshool roguelikes that are hard this Game is definitely for you.
You even have the option to not go roguelike with only one life and go adventuremode instead where you get an extra life every few level up or even exploration mode where you have infinite lives, there are multiple dificultys and you have to unlock a lot of classes through quests and events witch never gets boring for me and keeps the game interesting.
Its not your average roguelike where you ahve to go down to floor 10 or 50 or something and defeat someone it has a much more open world where you can decide witch dungeon you want to go to next or if you want a randomized dungeon via farportal. The open world aspect + the diffenret playstiles of the classes for me means this game has a lot moee replayability than most roguelikes and it has earned its place in my favourite games so far.",1406644082,1406644082,True,3,0,0.469225525856018066,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Escape options in this game are largely restricted to teleports; due to the level disparity that prompts a need for an escape, nothing less then escape in a single turn is fast enough. Unfortunately, the teleports are random and unreliable until late game, when they are finally targetable.

Deep tactical combat built around activated talents and cooldowns makes this completely different from the traditional ""walk towards things until they die"" formula. It feels like a turn based action rpg rather than Nethack.

ToME has several gamemodes. Story mode has lots and lots of written original lore but it may get repetitive after several runs. You will die and have to start over many times and it is fuck hard unless you know what you're doing. And that experience comes from dying enough times to learn how not to. Playing story mode is required to unlock other gamemodes and more than the few initial character classes and races.

In Arena you fight a set number of waves of increasingly difficult enemies, and if you win, your player character becomes the new final boss of the arena. It is not balanced for all character classes, some are significantly weaker because there's rarely time to rest your cooldowns, and most of the time there are lots of enemies on the screen.

Infinite Dungeon is just what it says. The challenge in it comes from the randomness. It is somewhat level scaled, but whereas in story mode you know what kind of monsters and bosses are in each area, here you can't really prepare for anything. It is the old school roguelike experience but the modern game mechanics still make it quite original.

If you are down here reading reviews, it's because you're not 100% sure about getting the game, and figured it would help to see what other people think about it. Let me help you out, friend: Buy this game. 

I had my doubts too, at first. It's hard to tell what the game is like from the trailer, and the graphics ain't Skyrim. It's ok. Just buy the game, and you will be happier then you were in that soon forgotten time where you didn't have the game. 

You want reasons? Ok, I have plenty of those. First off, this is one of the greatest Rouge style RPGs you will ever play. Easy to jump into, but will take many hours till you even begin to figure it all out enough to survive to level 20+. Multiple races and classes, and each class feels different, with multiple ways to develop. No potions to hoard, and death is always around the corner. Hotbar of actions like an MMO, including activated item abilities. Great sense of humor, and frequently updated. All done by one programmer, DarkGod, who randomly pops into the game to turn you into a rabbit. In this game you can eat the heart of a Sandworm, read monster poetry, and get killed by your future self. 

Rouge mode is true Rouge, one death is all you get. Adventure mode gives you a few lives, and more as you level. The 3rd mode lets you keep coming back, but you don't want that mode. That mode is for squares. Try adventure mode, and try not to die before you make it to the Master. 

Seriously, this game is incredible. It is digital crack, and should be sold with a warning label. It's the top down rougelike MMOishRPG you didn't know you were missing. Great replayability, great depth, great community. Check out the forum for help on builds, or figuring out what all the stats/elements/statuses do. The Dev has been known to implement ideas right from the forums into the game. And if you are reading this during the big Steam Summer Sale, this game is selling for under $4. Did I mention that Z is the shortcut for auto-explore? Yep, it will even explore the board for you. ToME is one of those games that you will bond with random strangers over. It's a ""Oh crap, is it 4am already?"" game. It's a game you need in your library. Do it.

最早接触Roguelike类游戏是一款小巧的手机游戏，中文名译作《独入危牢》。只有魔法师、弓箭手、战士三个传统RPG职业，游戏很简单，就是深入随 机的地下城去冒险，地牢一共十层，打到最底层杀掉boss就算通关，而你的人物只有一条命，一旦死亡，就要重新建立新人物冒险。
这种以前从没见过的游戏类型让我在最初的时候很不适应，因为在地下城中有太多不可预见性的事情发生，人物经常“莫名其妙”的死亡，有时打到一两件趁手的好装备，却因为一个不小心死掉了，那种感觉简直要疯，因为你又要重新再来了！
在一遍又一遍的挂掉，重建，挂掉，重建的过程当中，终于有一次，我的法师打到了最后一层，并且成功的KO掉了boss（法师到哪儿都是亲儿子 啊......），然而通关后的失落感让人有点不知所措，这是我第一次通关游戏之后失落大于喜悦的，我发现，原来真的有些游戏是让你热衷于探索的过程而不是一个结果。
当在网上寻找类似游戏的时候，我才知道原来我玩的这种游戏叫做roguelike类游戏，最明显的特点就是“随即地下城+一条命”。之后接触了比较好接受 的TOME，在最初的时候，基本上都是选择的冒险模式进行的剧情模式，也就是在“有限命”下的游戏模式，因为一命通关对于我这个还不算是骨灰级玩家的人来 说，太难接受了，因为tome不比独入危牢，游戏时间长，我实在是不想让我连续几天甚至几个星期几个月打出来的人物一命呜呼，而探索模式（无限命）又让游戏索然无味，因为你完全不用惧怕死亡带来的威胁。
尽管如此，在有限条命下我的人物还是会经常被KO，我又不想去用那个禁止自动存档的补丁，又不敢去玩永久死亡模式，这种心态就是韩寒《三重门》里说的那种“做人要么大俗，要么大雅，不俗不雅是最痛苦的”吧。
在经历了数个人物的失败之后，我开始渐渐有些浮躁了，甚至用“死亡时2秒内用任务管理器强关游戏”的办法躲过一次次的死亡。尽管人物会苟延残喘一阵，但是却让我总觉得有点缺少什么东西。
激活无尽地下城模式后，偶然间的一次，我用永久死亡模式建了一个矮人狂战士进行了一次游戏，仅仅是那一次游戏，尽管6级的时候在第4层就“扑街""了，尽管 我几乎没打到几件像样的装备，尽管最后死的时候毫无还手之力，我仍然感觉到一种东西流进了身体里，那是一种状态？一种精神？我说不清楚，我只知道，我一下 子便静下心来沉迷到了游戏当中——原来这才是Roguelike类游戏的真谛——在地下城中小心翼翼的前进，一个简简单单的疏忽就能让你陷入无底深渊，成 为下一个冒险者看都不看一眼的路旁白骨；珍惜每一只怪的经验，一定要把那一层的全部地图走完再下楼；一遍又一遍的调整你的属性分配和技能分配，每一次人物 的死亡都是下一个人物的宝贵经验；装备的优劣对于游戏的影响只能排在”玩家水平“和“角色技能培养”之后，再好的装备贸然前进，一个震慑一个“在黑暗中迷失”一样完蛋。在Vault的诱惑当前，是相信自己的水平还是理智的先去下一层呢？这一切的一切都让人无法自拔，当我用5级的人物风筝掉一个21级精英吸血鬼的时候，那种巨大的成就感让人几乎热血沸腾。
在当前单机游戏低迷，网游页游大张旗鼓吸金的时代，一个能让人“静下心来”却又“沉迷”的游戏凤毛麟角，因为在这里，你的虚荣心会被一条龙的吐息瞬间浇灭，你没法花RMB获得任何属性加成或优势，更没有任何值得炫耀的东西，因为只要你玩下去，总会被某一层某只怪杀掉。在这儿，你能做的就只有一件事，那就是活在当下，举起火把，在阴暗危险的地下城中，永无止境的前进。",1403235865,1479532429,True,12,0,0.635417461395263672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is an interesting roguelike that plays a little differently from others of its' genre.. If you want an idea of what makes it different;

No identification. All items are identified immediately upon picking them up. This wasn't the case in earlier versions of the game, but the large and increasing number of fixed artifacts and no need for identification scrolls made it somewhat pointless.

Potions and scrolls are replaced by infusions and runes, which give on-demand abilities that consume no permanent resources -with a limited number of slots for these abilities. Regeneration infusions are the primary method of healing, replacing healing potions, and runes of teleportation replace scrolls of teleportation as an escape from trouble. Nothing is lost in their use, but they have cooldowns.

A system for ""extra lives"". Before you crucify the game, extra lives is either a startup option akin to lowering the difficulty(""roguelike"" mode for one life, ""Adventure"" for three, ""Exploration"" for unlimited) or through very rare artifacts or abilities in-game. Also, it doesn't save you if you decided to hug an Elven Corruptor and he blows you up the first turn you revive.

Disable-heavy combat. Simply, being resilient to damage through armor or magical resistance is not as important as being difficult to disable. Stuns and confusion are the leading killers, not high burst damage. This makes it very easy to get chain-disabled and killed if you haven't prepared properly with high saving throws or effect clears(certain runes and infusions will remove a detrimental effect from you on use). 

All of these things combined could make it seem like a somewhat casual roguelike, but in practice it isn't really any easier than similar contemporary roguelikes. The only element that is truly missing is resource management. You still must assess risks, prepare for and pick your battles carefully, and adapt to what the RNG has provided you. The cooldowns-based combat and lack of resource management should be considered an interesting spin, not an intentional dumbing down.",1403225360,1403225360,True,3,1,0.50521087646484375,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Tales of Maj'Eyal is very much the roguelike I'd been waiting for. In a time when every game designer seems obsessed with pushing as many types of gameplay into a game as possible, the creators of ToME instead focus on doing this one type of gameplay really well. As a result, the game combines all the aspects that attracted me to roguelikes in the first place, putting just enough character and originality into the mix to keep it interesting without ruining the experience. If you're anything like me, you will love this.


[b]PROS[/b]
  -- Hours upon hours of varied roguelike gameplay.
  -- Heaps of interesting loot.
  -- An addictingly great mix of casual and involved.
  -- Lots of quirky charm.

[b]CONS[/b]

	-- The stat system is in some ways a bit too complex for most.
	-- Pretty it ain't.
	-- The interface and the controls are still a bit glitchy at times, although they have yet to cause me serious trouble.

P.D: Si vas a ver un vídeo de su gameplay, intenta mirar uno en el que expliquen lo que están haciendo, porque puede que al principio no te enteres de lo que está pasando en pantalla, pero una vez que le cojas el truco y te ""enganche"", ya no habrá vuelta atrás.

First, I think it is important to point out that although Tales of Maj'Eyal is featured as a roguelike game with perma-death, it can also be played with limited lives as well as unlimited lives. So, even if you do die you can still advance through the entire game with all of your hard earned stats and gear! That's really like 3 versions of the game!  So far, it seems like a very solid and polished game. It's obvious that a lot of love went into the making of this game and it shows through the professionalism of the product. Everything is explained in great detail through text boxes.

It should also be noted that not all of the character races and classes are unlocked at the beginning of the game, and must be unlocked through playing the game. There are sub races and classes branching off of the main choices also.

When you die in Exploration mode, you can teleport back to the battle before you died, but must fight that same battle from the beginning again, or teleport a little further back out of harms way.  You also get the choice to retire your character roguelike style, so be extra careful when making one of these choices after dying!  That is the only penalty for death that I have seen so far, but this is only based on my experience playing on Easier difficulty and Exploration mode (unlimited lives).



Pros:
+3 game modes; Roguelike (perma-death), Adventure (limited lives) & Exploration (unlimited lives).
+5 difficulty settings.  Easier, Normal, Nightmare & 2 more locked settings.
+Generous level cap of 50.
+Extensive character customization with skill trees and infusions.
+No consumables.  You don't have to worry about food or water.
+Ammo is unlimited, but you will have to reload your quiver once in a while.
+Fast movement and strategic turn-based gameplay.
+Save feature. You can have multiple saves for multiple characters!
+Many towns, dungeons and creepy places to explore, and conquer!
+Can use both keyboard & mouse.
+Streamlined to play on many computer systems and configurations.
+Many races & character classes with sub races and classes to choose from.
+Randomly generated tactical battles and dungeons/maps. Both good & bad!
+Easy modding support with Steam Workshop integration.
+User friendly GUI with great explanations of everything!
+Great little tutorial provided.
+Cool sound track and sound FX.
+Smart AI.  Both character and monster AI.  Monsters will hunt you down!
+Options, options and more options!  The game is completely customizable!

Cons:
-Death comes too easy due to free roam exploration and randomly generated tactical battles & dungeons/maps.  You can encounter areas without warning, where you will die instantly.  Beware of dungeons you cannot exit because you activated a battle with monsters 30+ levels above yours!
-Randomly generated tactical battles and dungeons/maps. As I said, both good & bad!
-The game gets a little boring after a while.
-Once you beat Arena mode, your character is useless.
-You cannot play the regular game with Arena characters.
-The price is a little high for an indy game.  I usually get these kinds of games for $1 on my iPad.



You can use keyboard, mouse or a combo of the both. There are many key commands which most can be accessed with the mouse too. The keyboard commands are logical choices and easy to learn, but can be remapped to your liking. You'll be using the mouse most of the time though. I have not seen any In App Purchase (IAP) selections or buttons, so I assume most of the content so far is in the game.

Tales of Maj'Eyal seems like a nice little game that is very stable and polished with love for the genre. It's old school fun with a twist of 21st century ideas. Being able to set up the game with limited and unlimited lives was a very nice touch and gives the game some options to appeal to many other gamers! You even get your own set of achievements and recognition for playing with limited and unlimited lives! I'm happy with my purchase! :D Happy dungeon crawling! :)

Habe es auf gut Glück gekauft,da mir die anderen Roguelikes die man so auf Steam sieht nicht zusagen,wollte etwas das mehr an das Original heranreicht,nur in schönerem Look (Ascii ist absolut nichts für mich)

Das schöne an Tome ist dass es im Gegensatz zu anderen seines Genres nicht auf ein paar Klassen beschränkt ist,man kann aus einer vielzahl an Rassen und Klassen wählen,je nach wahl startet man auch anderst,als Zwerg zb tief unter der Erde und kämpft sich zu beginn seinen Weg gegen Orks frei.
Zudem beinhaltet es noch ein durchdachtes Skillsystem das sehr unterschiedlich von Klasse zu Klasse ist,viel Raum zum rumspielen.

Wem Roguelike zu hart ist,der kann auch auf abgemilderte Schwierigkeitsgrade ohne Permadeath zurückgreifen.
Levels sind natürlich immer Zufallsgeneriert,wie auch die Gegner die einem über den Weg laufen.
Unvorsichtiges Handeln wird schnell Bestraft (Könnte einen ganzen Charfriedhof anlegen)

Mit über 1300 Steamerfolgen haben natürlich auch die Archievement Jäger was davon.

Aufjedenfall ein Spiel von dem man lange etwas hat,Musik und Sounds sind stimmig.
Hut ab dass da nur ein Mann hinter diesem Spiel sitzt.

Tome gibts übrigens auch kostenlos,der Vorteil der Steam Variante sind ,,nur'' Musik und Charskins.

Now, from that roguelike take out the fact that: Potions can kill you, necklaces can choke you, weapons can weld themselves to your hand, Identify scrolls can be burned to a crisp, and you can be violently killed by eating moldy bread :)

While I love those type of deaths, once you play ToME and notice that those deaths are not there, you realize now that if you die, it truly is your fault. Death comes from combat (or the occasional sandworm burrow collapsing in on you, haha), and the combat is great.. Almost every single build has multiple ways you can grow, almost to the point that they play like different classes altogether when raised in certain ways.. And then the raw variety of classes is amazing as well.. And the random loot generation is some of the best I've dealt with on the MANY, MANY random-loot games I've played :>

Add to all that the Infinite Dungeon (how far can you go?), the Transmogrification Chest (all picked-up items rest weightlessly inside the Transmog Chest, and on changing floors you can auto-sell everything out of the chest for a 10% cash penalty, makes inventory management a breeze), a very active and friendly playerbase with in-game chat (its basically an IRC room tacked to the bottom right of the game), the ability to link items and enemies through chat to share the joy of good loot, or the bitter terror of a hyper-strong unique enemy, semi-random in-game events that can potentially save you from the brink of death, and more.. :>

This game has the most achievements of any game on Steam (over 1000), multiple difficulty levels (some that determine the strength of your foes, others that determine how many lives you get: Roguelike one-life-to-live, Adventure 5-lives-to-live, and Exploration mode, unlimited lives with which you can get comfortable with the game ((or plunge fearlessly into the Infinite Dungeon!)

Anyway.. Try it.. It won't suck out your everlasting human soul, I promise.. It won't.. consume.. you.. GOTTA GO PLAY ToME!

游戏性、自由度都很高，但上手不易
适合普通~~重度RPG爱好者、roguelike爱好者、非画面党的佳作
个人评分：9/10


优点1：
丰富的种族、职业、技能搭配，能够组合出多种多样的冒险人物

优点2：
随机地形、随机道具、随机怪物生成，具有很高的重玩性

优点3：
严谨的设定、平衡度上佳

优点4：
剧情还不错，自带bgm尚可，不会让人觉得枯燥

缺点1：
最被人吐槽的肯定是画面，虽然这种游戏卖点从来都不是画面，但是这一点还是让很多没有接触过roguelike游戏的玩家望而却步

缺点2：
难度不友好。笔者从遥远的开发版玩到steam平台发售，断断续续大概200h+，虽然已经不少，但还是不能自称入门。
实际上，笔者至今还没有超过LV20过= =
这也从侧面反映了，这款游戏适合有耐心的硬核rpg玩家，而不适合那些喜欢无脑突突突、刷刷刷的玩家。

Совсем не требовательна к железу, в своё время играл в неё взахлёб на ноутбуке. В игре оооочень много контента, квестов, историй, локаций - за одно прохождение всего этого не увидеть. 

Если играете не на Exploring, то ваши смерти ограничены, и вы реально трясетесь за собственную жизнь, в случае смертельной опасности убегая с максимально возможной скоростью. Не раз и не два приходилось мне драться с чрезвычайно серьёзными противниками, в основном с магами и некромантами, и такие бои затягивались на многие десятки ходов. Битва двух магов, если они равны по силам - это то ещё зрелище!

А сознание того, что тебе нельзя умирать, добавляет тонну острых ощущений. В конце, если удается победить, оставшись с 1% здоровья, то дико радуешься. 

- 1200+ ачивментов
- постепенное открытие новых стартовых профессий (изначально доступен только алхимик), который, прямо скажем, слабоват
- несколько режимов игры (Roguelike - смерть завершает игру, Adventure - 10-15 смертей, Exploring - смерти unlimited, но некоторые ачивки недоступны)
- процедурно генерируемые подземелья
- боссы, много-много сильных боссов (в том числе уникальные и квестовые). 

Каждая профессия имеет свои фишки и собственный путь раскачивания навыков, так что освоение игры за нового персонажа может занять несколько десятков часов, а самих таких профессий тоже около десятка. 

Изучая глобальную статистику достижений, можжно сказать, что даже до 10 уровня докачалось лишь несколько процентов игроков (4-6%). Хардкорная игра со множеством тонкостей для хардкорых людей.

[h1]Рекомендации[/h1]
- Не раскачивайте своего персонажа безсистемно. Найдите гайд по своему классу, и качайтесь по гайду. В противном случае у вас может не хватить сил для битвы с серьёзными противниками.
- Не знаю, как сейчас, но в то время, когда играл я, самым сильным и простым классом в игре был стихийный волшебник. У него было много атакующих заклинаний, прокастовка которых наносила огромный урон. Если у противника был иммунитет к определенному виду стихийной магии (например, 100% защита от огня), то это не было проблемой для волшебника, ибо у него в распоряжении есть множество других стихий.
- Отыграйте хотя бы 2 или 3 полных раза на сложности Adventure, не надо сразу прыгать в казуальный Explorer с неограниченными жизнями.",1400068926,1475461548,True,1,0,0.46364593505859375,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've been playing this game since before it was on steam and had hoped that they would have fixed a lot of things, but they haven't.  Now I find myself hating having put it on my steam collection.

My experience with this game has been singular.  I waste time creating a character and spawn in a room full of monsters, half of which are level 2 while I am level one.  9 times out of 10, it has spawned me right next to these creatures, so within a round or two of starting the game, my character is dead and in a situation that they CANNOT get out of.  Kill the character off, make a new one, continue this cycle ad nauseum.  

The tutorial tells you outright that the character is OP for the tutorial and your character in the game will be 'weaker,' but what they fail to tell you is the monsters in the tutorial are weaker than you'll be facing in the actual game as well.  Inventory management is a pain in the ass and the random dungeon generation frequently makes walls with 'holes' in them (diagonally placed) so trying to take a corner to limit avenues of attack tends to result in getting attacked through the wall by something on the other side you didn't even know was there.

This is a roguelike, turned-based RPG with classes, races, stats, and abilities. The loot system is similar to Diablo and other ARPGs, with randomly generated loot of various qualities and special effects, along with unique loot. The art style is similar to old-school western RPGs like the Spiderweb games. An overworld map contains various towns and dungeons, the latter of which unlock gradually as you progress and complete quests.

Now, the part where this game really defied my expectations is that it provides a very streamlined experience, without a lot of the typical drudgery that goes along with games like this.

- First of all, the game itself is very intuitive to pick up and start playing without needing a tutorial. The interface is mouse-driven, no need to memorize keybinds (although it does offer fully customizable keybinds as well).

- The game seem to understand that the appeal of games like this is both the satisfaction of level progression, as well as the hunt for rare loot. Early on, you get an item that can recycle junk loot into gold, as well as a item with unlimited charges that basically provides a Town Portal effect that teleports you out of the current dungeon. This eliminates the trap that Bethesda games, for example, typically fall into, where you want to be a packrat and collect every piece of loot you come across, but are severely limited in the amount of weight you can carry.

- The game offers several difficulty levels, from unlimited lives, to several lives, to permadeath.

- The game has an ""auto-explore"" button, where your character will automatically move around the current dungeon floor until it finds an item of interest or an enemy. Movement can also be control via clicking on visible locations, and your character will move to the select square.",1396964273,1396964273,True,37,0,0.675094008445739746,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Turns out I hate the entire idea of a roguelike game. I tried to look beyond that and give it a shot. Still not for me.

I got into this game only because its the top achievement game on steam and I liked the idea of supporting a one man dev team (because this game is actually free elsewhere). Vast majority of the achievements have never been earned and are basically impossible or luck based. 

Its free for a reason. About the moment I got camped by level 20 mobs in a level 1 zone and couldnt progress I realized the dev has no idea what they are doing. Even as a ""hard"" game thats just stupid. Literally couldnt get out of the starting zone because of 6-10 mobs chasing me. I'm supposed to do this with one life? Even on infinite play I hated every minute of it.

There is no skill in being stomped at level 1, Im all for challenging boss fights and such. I never made it that far lol.",1396924977,1396924977,False,36,5,0.410052388906478882,2,True,False,False,False,,,

It's from the less wackyrandom branch of roguelikes so there's less stuff you have to learn by dying constantly and not so many unfair instadeaths. This can be a good thing if you don't like RNG bullshit deaths, but if you enjoy Nethack-type randomness more you might find this game a bit boring.

The best part of the game is the character development. There's tons of classes and races and while you start with the more usual ones like warriors and rogues, through game events you will unlock dozens more ranging from time-travellers to plague cultists with quite unique gameplay mechanics. There are tons of optional skill trees to unlock through quests so your characters will become quite varied.

Minus points for the completely bland levels, monsters and itemization. There's an ADOM-type overworld map which ensures that not every area is a traditional dungeon, but the levels themselves are just plain boring with no interesting features. Then again the game does have a great auto-explore function so at least you don't have to slog through the dull mazes manually, this is a really good addition, you can fast-forward to the next encounter. Item-wise there are no consumables like the usual potions and scrolls so while it keeps the game less cluttered it also reduces the variety of events and loot a lot. The only items are gear you wear/wield so you can get bigger numbers on your character sheet, sometimes you can get artifacts/runes which grant an extra skill. Simple, but gets grindy and boring. It doesn't help that you mostly have to do the same areas again when you make a new character, they get repetitive.

This game leans a bit more towards traditional RPGs because the lack of random craziness means that you usually die just when you get too cocky and proceed to a situation you can't handle and on the default difficulty you're allowed to make some mistakes. Characters seem to lead much longer lives than usually in roguelikes and a successful run takes something like 20 hours. I just wish it had more memorable and dynamic areas and enemies, but the class and skill system is still better than in most roguelikes.

While there are many things that I don't like and I find the brutal unfair roguelikes more entertaining, I still think ToME is good.

Jeśli spędziliście wiele godzin grając w Adoma, nethacka czy diablo - ta gra łączy wszystkie te elementy, usprawnia je, przeżuwa i wypluwa w formie która przyciągnie was na wiele, wiele tygodni gry.

Gra należy do gatunku turowych cRPGów i ostrzegam lojalnie, jest dość trudna - w końcu to Roguelike.

Twórca oddał nam do dyspozycji trzy tryby rozgrywki, począwszy od najprostszego (exploration mode) w którym mamy do dyspozycji nieskończoną ilość żyć. Możemy swobodnie odkrywać świat, odblokowywać nowe klasy i rasy i uczyć się mechaniki.

Drugim trybem jest Adventure Mode, w którym posiadamy pulę żyć, przystosowany dla tych graczy, którzy poznali już podstawy.

Trzecim trybem, trybem za pomocą którego powinno się grać w tą grę jest Roguelike - jedno życie - bezpardonowy, zmuszający do myślenia, taktycznego planowania ruchów i używania wszystkich umiejętności swojej postaci na 120%.


W skrócie o co chodzi: wybieramy postać (z pośród wielu kombinacji ras oraz klas) i idziemy ratować świat. Natomiast styl w którym to zrobimy zależy już całkowicie od nas - jeśli ktoś lubi 'budować' postać pod swój styl gry, tutaj znajdzie się w prawdziwym raju. Dorzucić do tego jeszcze generowane losowo podziemia (oraz nadziemia, gdyż spora część gry dzieje się na otwartej przestrzeni), tysiące różnych przedmiotów, wiele questów oraz rosnący poziom trudności (który można jeszcze podkręcić, jakby komuś było mało) sprawi, że trudno będzie wam oderwać się od ekranów.

Walka jest, mimo turowej oprawy, jest bardzo dynamiczna. Wrogowie są nie tylko mają przewagę liczebną, ale większość z nich dysponuje tymi samymi trikami co gracze. Co sprawia, że walki z bossami i mini-bossami często zmuszają nas do salwowania się ucieczką - przede wszystkim na poczatku naszej przygody.

Co dostajemy w pakiecie:
* Gra składa się z trzech aktów, każdy (razem z wątkami pobocznymi) zajmuje około 2-6 godzin gry (w zależności od wybranej klasy, trybu gry oraz poziomu trudności).
* Kampanię główną i dwie mini-kampanię.
* Ponad 1200 achivementów (!).
* 25 klas postaci.
* 9 ras postaci.

Jakby komuś było mało, większość gry jest napisana w LUA i posiada bardzo dobry support dla moderów - na steam workshop znajdziecie wiele dodatkowych klas, przedmiotów, podziemi oraz questów.

Jeśli i to was nie przekonuje do spróbowania, możecie ściągnąc całkowicie darmową wersję gry (wersja dla donatorów, którą można zakupić na steamie posiada trzy dodatkowe 'ficzery': 1 dodatkową klasę, możliwość przekazywania przedmiotów między postaciami oraz Exploration mode).

Osobiście sciągnołem wersję darmową, ale po dwóch tygodniach gry stwierdziłem, że 6 euro to nie takie duże pieniądze na grę która przykuła mnie na dużo dłużej niż parę godzin.

Strikes a perfect balance between usability/user friendliness with depth and complexity. I'll review this game by highlighting what I think sets it apart from other games in the genre.

[b]No consumable items[/b] - TOME doesn't have potions, scrolls, or wands. You choose a limited number of abilities that give you the function that consumables play in other games - quick heal, regen, teleport, blink, fireball, etc. This eliminates the issues lots of people have with hoarding consumables, not knowing when to use them, the pain of having them destroyed, etc. Picking and choosing the right abilities adds a layer of depth that doesn't exist in other roguelikes. 

[b]Fast [/b]- this game plays lightning fast and is very streamlined, thanks to the lack of consumables. Of course, it's turn based, so it's only as fast as you want...but I tend to play pretty fast, and lots of roguelikes feel sluggish in comparison.

[b]Broad[/b] - Lots of classes, from your standard mage and warrior to the cool weird things like Chronomancers and Wyrmics (dragon-fighters). 

[b]Deep[/b] - The different classes feel distinct. In addition to the obvious (different skills and equipment), different types of classes have different types of resources (mana/stamina/equilibrium/hate/probably some other ones) that work in different ways.  

[b]Combat Is Fun [/b] - This is the only roguelike I've played where melee combat is actually fun. You get lots of buttons to push that do different things. In most roguelikes, the coolest thing about your melee character is the equipment you find. In TOME, you can actually do cool shit - charge, shout, whirlwinds, cleaves, etc. 

[b]Simple[/b] - This doesn't mean easy and it doesn't mean shallow - it just means simple. Clean, streamlined design. The action bar is great - every option your character has is on it, so you always know what you can and can't do. No navigating labyrinthine menus, no checking your inventory after you died and remembering you could have used your blink, etc.

[b]Overworld[/b] - Like ADOM and not like Crawl, TOME features a static overworld that's always the same and features the same dungeons/locations, which are themselves randomized. This isn't necessarily better or worse, just putting it out there.

This game is an absolute blast. If you liked Dungeons of Dreadmor, you owe it to yourself to take a step up to a more serious and more interesting game. :)",1394302028,1394302349,True,4,1,0.547321438789367676,0,True,False,False,False,,,

美麗なグラフィック
多様な難易度調整要素
で、ローグライク初心者でも安心して遊べます。
他のローグライクに漏れず、死んで覚えるゲームですが、難易度調整要素の中には、複数命がある残機制のものもあるので、とっつきやすさは群を抜いてるのではないでしょうか。
また、種族やクラスも豊富で、成長要素はディアブロ等のスキル制を導入しているので、同じ種族・クラスでも様々なビルドを楽しむことが出来ます。
アイテムも勿論多彩で、マジックアイテム・レアアイテム・アーティファクト・ランダムアーティファクト等があります。

実は公式サイトで無料で遊べるので、そちらで遊んでからSteam版を購入する事も可能です。

2014年3月8日
Steam版では、1.1.5現在アイテム倉庫やドワーフのクラスが追加されていますが、これからもっと追加要素は増えると思われます。
公式の無料版は有志による日本語化パッチがあるので、英語が苦手な方はそちらを遊んでからSteam版を遊ぶといいと思います。
もっとも、謎解き要素がほぼないので、英語が苦手でも問題なく遊べるとは思います。私も英語はあまり得意ではありませんが、楽しめていますので。

2017年11月25日追記
現行の最新版は1.5.5で、現在はワークショップに有志の方々による日本語化modがあります。
3年前の購入特典だったドワーフのクラスは無料版でも使えるようになりましたが、代わりにPossesorという職業が購入特典として追加されています。
DLCは、後から買っても問題ないと思いますが、DLCなしなら無料版とほとんど変わらないので、無料版遊んで楽しめたらSteam版をDLC共々買う、というのが一番賢明な購入の流れかなと思います。

i don't know what it is about this game that i love. it seems extremely basic on the surface but underneath it there's a depth that seems to go on forever. i have about 34 hours in this game and i've only gotten to level 15 before i end up dying. the deaths are frustrating but at the same time, i learn from it, i get better and to me that's the heart of a roguelike. 

a lot of different classes with different playstyles that you can unlock. the unlocking itself becomes a game, more of a push to get further in the game, to go a little more slowly when you encounter a new enemy and read up on their abilities. 

the one thing i don't like is that it's not really apparent on where to go. you have to do the dungeons in a specific order and that's not really apparent in the game. luckily many people out there have written an order they like and one that seems to work well, so i would check that out first.

the game just feels like a community. people submit lore to be added to it and the creator will surprise people with random events if you happen to be on at the right time. for instance, there was an event the other day where he gave everyone on a flute that turned their character skin into a pirate, with pirate noises. just little touches like that from the creator shows the kind of care and admiration he has for this.

Das bedeutet, dass man alle Vor- und Nachteile eines Roguelikes erwarten kann:

- Permadeath
- Rundenbasierte Kämpfe
- Hack'n Slash Mentalität
- Randomisierte Gebiete, Gegenstände und Ereignisse

ToME zeichnet sich im Vergleich zu anderen Roguelikes zusätzlich durch folgende Eigenheiten aus:

- Sehr detaillierte Grafik
- Modernes mausgestütztes Interface mit Tooltipps und Fenstern
- Eine persistente Weltkarte mit einer Handlung, mehrstufigen Quests und Überraschungen
- Skillbäume und Charaktertraits
- Komplexes Kampfmodell mit einer Vielzahl von Einflussfaktoren

Tworzymy postać, przemierzamy świat, zdobywamy poziomy i ekwipunek jednocześnie próbując nie zginąć. Standardowa śpiewka, którą znają i kochają wszyscy fani. A potem zaczynają się jaja. Po pierwsze ilość ras i klas (po odblokowaniu wszystkich rzecz jasna) jest po prostu SZALONA. Do naszej dyspozycji oddane zostaje 8 raz grywalnych, znacząco różniących się statystykami, oraz kilkanaście klas z których tworzymy naszą postać. Ilość kombinacji jest tak wielka, że naprawdę ciężko jest powiedzieć o braku zróżnicowania. Do tego każda(!) klasa zachowuje się i gra inaczej. I to znacząco inaczej. Pokażcie mi proszę RPG, w którym rozgrywka nekromantą i przywoływaczem jest tak diametralnie różna. Do tego trzeba jeszcze rozróżnić naprawdę zróżnicowane buildy jednej konkretnej klasy (grywalne, rzecz jasna). Dla przykładu berserker budujący się w balans będzie po prostu stał przy potworku i bił go tak długo, aż podłoga i ściany zmienią kolor na czerwony. Ten sam berserker zbudowany pod czystą ofensywę będzie chciał zakończyć walkę jednym ciosem, ponieważ im dłuższa walka, tym gorzej dla niego. A to tylko naprawdę trywialny przykład jednej z wielu klas w grze. Naprawdę bardzo rzadko zdarzą się dwie identyczne rozgrywki, w szczególności, gdy podchodzimy do gry po raz pierwszy. Dodatkowym smaczkiem jest uwielbiany przeze mnie klawisz random. Jeśli nie chce nam się myśleć, czym chcemy grać, po prostu go używamy, i już możemy się cieszyć grą. Oczywiście większość kombinacji będzie brała w tyłek chętniej niż Sasha, ale takie uroki łutu szczęścia.

Rozgrywka jest turowa w przyjemnym tego słowa znaczeniu. Większość naszych zdolności i umiejętności zabiera jedną turę na użycie. Niektóre działają natychmiastowo (bez straty tury), inne jeszcze pasywnie odwalają swoją robotę. Każdy krok, atak czy cokolwiek co wymaga od nas co najmniej trzech sekund (tyle mniej więcej patrząc logicznie zabiera akcja) jest traktowane jako jedna tura. Zrozumiałe, przyjemne i intuicyjne. Większość umiejętności tudzież akcji wszelakich jest przypisana do remapowalnych skrótów klawiszowych, nie musimy więc przekopywać się przez megabajty okienek, by znaleźć i użyć to, czego akurat potrzebujemy. Mało tego, część zdolności możemy podpiąć pod wbudowane makra, na przykład nasza postać może sama odpalać automatycznie pole siłowe, jeśli w jej polu widzenia pojawi się potwór. Dzięki temu, mimo turowości, gra jest dynamiczna i umożliwia granie zarówno fanom automatyki jak i klikaczom manualnym. 

Ok, skończyliśmy tworzyć nasze alter ego, schodzimy do podziemi, zabijamy, jest wesoło. Pada nam w końcu jakiś przedmiot. I tu kolejny raz musiałem przetrzeć oczy ze zdumienia. Ilość statystyk, które wpływają na naszą postać jest tak wielka, że najbardziej skomplikowane MMO na świecie (Ultima Online) wzdycha ze wzruszenia patrząc na te przedmioty. Ok, powiem jak to działa. W grze jest 6 statystyk głównych, które wpływają na naszą postać. Ponadto statystyki te rozgałęziają się na kilka pobocznych. Oprócz tego niektóre ze statystyk pobocznych występują jedynie pod postacią zdolności tudzież ekwipunku. Gdzie tu skomplikowanie? Wyobraźmy sobie przedmiot który ma, lekko licząc, dwadzieścia różnych efektów, z czego jeden jest jeszcze do tego czarem, np. kulą ognia, którą możemy użyć, jeśli mamy odpowiednią ilość ładunków w przedmiocie. Niech padnie drugi przedmiot o podobnych statystykach. W tym momencie mamy pauzę na co najmniej minutę, bo porównanie obu przedmiotów trochę zajmuje. Jest niby wbudowany porównywacz, ten jednak pokazuje nam tylko co stracimy, a co zyskamy. Nie wskaże nam który przedmiot jest lepszy, o nie. Gracz decyduje o tym, który itens jest mocniejszy, a który idzie wek do sprzedania. Jeśli do tego dodamy fakt, że większość klas może nosić co najmniej dziesięć przedmiotów (niektóre więcej) + runy zawierające czary spoza naszej klasy + ogromną wręcz ilość lootu, z czego większość jest generowana randomowo = godziny kopania wśród stert tarcz, mieczy i pancerzy. Niektórych to może odrzucać, owszem, ale moim skromnym zdaniem lepsze to niż ""+100 obrażeń, załóż koniecznie"" co spotkałem już w wielu tytułach.

Gramy kilka godzin już, coś źle zbudowaliśmy, albo zabił nas boss jakimś wyjątkowo szczęśliwym kombosem. Tworzymy nową postać, tym razem inną i... przechodzimy grę bez większych przeszkód. Niestety, ale ToME nie jest zbalansowana. Niektóre klasy są lepsze, inne są gorsze, to normalne, jednak w ToME jest to wyjątkowo widoczne. Przykładowo taki łucznik. Na początku praktycznie zabija jednym strzałem większość potworów, jednak im dłużej się gra tą klasą, tym jest ciężej. Owszem, ma bardzo dobry head start, jednak już w połowie gry zdarzały się bossy, które zabijały mnie od niechcenia. Z kolei przywoływacz [spoiler](swoją drogą, jest to najmocniejsza klasa w grze jeśli chodzi o end game)[/spoiler] ma problemy z przejściem pierwszego podziemia, podczas gdy pod koniec gry jest w stanie samodzielnie niszczyć pomieszczenia wypełnione po brzegi bossami nawet się przy tym nie pocąc. Brak zrównoważenia widać coraz bardziej z każdą nową grą. Owszem, przejść się da każdym jednym setupem, jednak dobór dungeonów do naszego aktualnego poziomu czy ekwipunku będzie się różnić diametralnie. Ba, pod koniec gry może się okazać, że najbardziej papierowa klasa świata jest niezniszcalna, a nasz dopieszczony do granic możliwości woj z tarczą pada na strzał, bo jedyne co umie, to podbiec i uderzyć.

Fabuła jest prosta jak matura. Zło zagraża światu, idź to zabij. Standard. Grę napędzają liczne sub questy, porozrzucane po całym świecie zapiski odnośnie historii Maj'Eyal oraz niezliczona wręcz ilość easter eggów. Dziwnym trafem większość z nich oscyluje dookoła uniwersum Doctor Who, możliwe jest jednak, że nie tylko, a ja danego uniwersum po prostu nie znam. Wracając jednak do zapisków historycznych, naprawdę warto je czytać. Nie dość, że nadają kolorytu temu czarno białemu światu, to jeszcze umożliwiają odblokowywanie dodatkowych zdolności, co znacząco ułatwia grę. Poza tym czyta się je naprawdę przyjemnie. Tak, zdaję sobie sprawę z tego, że większość graczy nie kupuje gry po to, żeby czytać jakąś książkę, ale choć raz wysilcie szare komórki, bo naprawdę warto!

Czas na aspekty techniczne. Muzyka jest przyjemna dla ucha, jednak nie narzuca się, nie jest też jakoś super epicka. Nie usłyszymy chórów ani orkiestr. Efekty dźwiękowe są na przyzwoitym poziomie, jednak po pewnym czasie mogą zwyczajnie nużyć. Grafika jest prosta, czasami jednak nie jesteśmy w stanie na ekranie zobaczyć nic przez natłok drzew, kamieni czy jakichkolwiek innych udziwnień i wodotrysków. Do tego ToME ma uciążliwy zwyczaj odmawiania współpracy i wypierdalania się do systemu (dosłownie. przekleństwo celowe, bo cholera robi to bez ostrzeżenia!) wprost proporcjonalny do czasu spędzonego przy grze. Jeśli gramy ponad dwie godziny, warto zapisywać co ważniejsze wydarzenie, bo istnieje duże prawdopodobieństwo, że programik się zadławi sam sobą i szlag trafi nasz progres.

Osoby, które kupią grę mają dostęp do kilku bardzo przyjemnych aspektów (tzw. donator privileges). Kosmetyczne zmiany wyglądu, nowy tryb rozgrywki ""exploration"" (w którym nie możemy zginąć. przydatne przy odblokowywaniu klas czy ras) oraz dzielony ze wszystkimi postaciami item vault. To ostatnie jest ultra przydatne.

Słowem końcowym: gra jest warta każdego grosza na nią wydanego. Grywalność wraz z możliwością ponownego przechodzenia bez zasypiania na klawiaturze i staro szkolna rogue-like za śmieszne pieniądze. Brać w ciemno!",1391961512,1391961512,True,32,2,0.791337311267852783,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Some examples of things that have been annoying, but in this game are not: you can 'auto-explore' to make sure you haven't missed anything on a floor of a dungeon.   You can also use auto-explore to go from floor entrance to floor exit and vice-versa when navigating any floors you might have already cleared.  It can be played entirely using just the mouse (keystrokes are still available for most actions and mapped to keys by default but you can remap it all to whatever you want if you like).  You also unlock items that make inventory management easier, which you then will start with from 'birth' on future playthroughs once acquired (example: an item that you get early on during first playthrough which automatically picks up items in any tile that you run over, and anything auto picked up like this isn't counted against your weight allowance; you can take any item out and keep it in regular inventory)  You can use a ""tag"" feature to flag any item with whatever keyword(s) you type in, and the game will not sell/drop the item.  There are no cursed items.  All items are automatically identified once picked up.  You can ""sell"" items anywhere/anytime due to item spoken of above so ""town runs"" are not necessary for inventory management purposes.  There are HELPFUL tooltips for everything that you hover the mouse over.

There is a very well-done tutorial (accessible during character creation) which explains most aspects of the games' combat/magic system.  There is still a lot of detail left for you to explore/examine/ignore at your leisure/peril, but you're given a good gameplay explanation via the tutorial.  I feel it is worth mentioning and applauding, because unlike other roguelikes I could just start this one up and with the exception of 'dungeon order' (see end of review) I have not felt the need to seek help about gameplay from the internet yet.

You start the game with a couple of race choices, and a few more class choices (rough mix of melee and magic).  Through gameplay you unlock additional races and classes to choose from in future games.    There is a very high variety of loot, that can give you bonus abilities that are activatable or are used when you hit an enemy, or when you land a critical hit on an enemy (and even more than that that I haven't used yet, I've mostly played the 'melee' side of class choices).   

You get various ability/skill points per level to assign to 'class' and 'general' skill trees, and a couple stat points per level to assign to your stats like strength, willpower, magic, constitution, cunning, dexterity as well.   Abilties in the skill trees have level and skill point requirements before they can be used, but if you are the min/max type, what is unlocked/available to put points into depends on your stat points from base points and equipment modifies ""at the time you kill the enemy that levels you up"".  This means you can plan ahead and stack your strength skill at level up time by wearing a bunch of equipment with +str on it, if you are playing a mage class but want to put points into a strength ability without sacrificing permanent points, to a degree.

Dungeons don't respawn; therefore, ""grinding"" isn't a gameplay consideration.  Dungeons are randomized in layout/monster placement but the monster types within each dungeon are the same every playthrough.  The world map/overview seems to be the same each playthrough but it's a small part of the overall gameplay and after a few playthroughs it's nice to know where the dungeons are each time.

Overall this is a very fun roguelike game that has great replay value due to skill/class/race combinations and the enormous variety of loot drops.  


I've added some gameplay tips for dungeon order if you buy or are playing the game, below (credit not mine).

Based on the suggestion of someone else I've done the dungeons (after the tutorial and starting racial area dungeon) in roughly this order:

Norgos, then Trollmire 4 if not done yet
Heart of the Gloom
Kor'pul

ToME is one of the few rogue-like RPGs that gets me frustrated over its unforgiving difficulty and harsh gameplay. And I love it because of it. The game gives a feeling of challenge and forces you to learn all of its mechanics and tricks. Fail to remember any and you will quickly lose all of your lives.

Did I mention that this game is a rogue-like? ToME is a game which has you create your own character picking one of the several races and classes. You can be a human warrior, an elven rogue, or even a halfling mage. The choice is yours. But don't get too attached to your character as they will very easily die. By default, your character is given only a few lives. Run out of them and it's game over. You either have to restart your character's entire story or make a new one. If perma-death or limited lives aren't your thing, there is an option to have infinite lives. But this removes a lot of the challenge in the game and you will not be able to get much of the game's NUMEROUS achievements.

While this game has very minimalistic graphics and mostly comprises of still images for characters and objects, it gives a very reminiscent feel of old rogue-like dungeon crawlers. The art-style is a very interesting one but might not appeal to all people. Overall, the game is very well design and made. It has the right amount of challenge and design put into it. The game even has its own lore set and a very interesting world to study and explore. And if you are worried about any lack of replayability, there is a ton of it. All of the dungeons are randomly generated. There are a wide variety of ways to play this game and interesting combinations of characters you can make. And the number of achievements will have completionists at their desks for days trying to get them all. If you feel that the game is lacking a certain something, this game does have Workshop support. So if you wish to make a Vampire race or even make one of the enemy races playable, then you can. This game is very open to mods and highly encourages it.

All in all, this is a very well-made game that will have on the edge of your seat as you try to keep your character alive.

Unlike the two other roguelikes listed above you'll find an actual story being played out along with Lore and Monster Details that really tell you about the world your character is playing in; while not getting in the way of in-game play. Game Mechanics are plentiful but they are spelled out and not hidden from the player. User Interface for the most part is easy to get into and use.

There are a couple of hurdles one will need to commit to however in order to play this game - like any Roguelike there is the overall Game Depth and Learning Curve and Tales of Maj'Eyal is no different. Character skills sort of level up similar to what you might find in an MMORPG or Diablo-like, but skills themselves are also much like their counterparts - not descriptive enough to tell you what they do and requiring you have to test them out or read up on them. 

For people coming from other Roguelikes, you may be thrown off by the sheer Tactical Nature of combat, Additionally it is worth noting that the game is meant to be played in Adventurer Mode - IE, Multiple Lives, not One. Lastly, the game is long - very long. A full run in the original Age of Ascendancy Campaign (The Main Vanilla Campaign that the game started with) from start to actual finish is probably going to be longer then most other Roguelikes bar a few.

All in all though, this is a very enjoyable game. Once you get past the couple tidbits that might hold you back or throw you off you'll likely have lots of fun playing with multiple races and classes in separate but distinct ways.",1391019392,1483324378,True,9,0,0.63162541389465332,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- De très longues heures de jeu pour un prix très attractif.
- De très nombreux éléments (classes, ennemis, objets, sorts, possibilités d'évolution du personnage…).
- Les développeurs semblent proches des joueurs (forum actif, courtes discussions in-game avec ceux connectés).
- Des enrichissements sont à attendre (nouvelles zones, races jouables…).
- En jouant connecté, de petits événements se produisent régulièrement (petits buffs, ouverture temporaire d’une zone...).
- Les add-ons de la communauté ajoutent du contenu supplémentaire.
- Des originalités intéressantes comme la zone ""Sandworm Lair"".
- Un programme stable : aucun crash ou freeze en près de 100 heures de jeu.
- Les classes de personnages demandent des tactiques très différentes. Cela accroît l'intérêt à recommencer une nouvelle partie pour les découvrir.

- Tout est en anglais. Pour lire les nombreux “Lores” (informations historiques, journaux d’aventuriers, poèmes, chansons…) dissimulés un peu partout et donc s’imprégner de l’atmosphère de cet univers, il est préférable de maîtriser un peu la langue de Shakespeare.
- Comme pour beaucoup de roguelikes, les graphismes ne sont pas la priorité. Ici, ils restent acceptables, mais basiques. Ils ne perturbent en rien la jouabilité et l'ambiance.
- Le monde étant très ouvert, il n’est pas rare d’entrer dans une zone avec des adversaires beaucoup trop puissants. Je pense au destin tragique de mon premier personnage (level 6) : une quête l’a amené à combattre un boss level 20 accompagné de créatures (élites ou rares) level 27.

A large number of classes, races, and talent categories are available to be unlocked as you play as well. Your character sheets will be uploaded to te4.org if you are logged in in-game, and you can search the repository for other players' characters. This is a great way to get some idea of how to play a class well if you don't want to go in completely blind.

Classes aren't particularly well-balanced, but you can be successful with any of them with enough experience playing. The difficulty can also feel a rather inconsistent throughout the game. Most enemies will be trivial to defeat, but then you might be rapidly taken down by a rare monster in a couple turns. Despite some short-comings, this is still an excellent game.

There is an unbelievable amount of content and lore that only keeps growing due to an active modding community and DLC from Dark God. I'm still discovering new, unexplored, areas of the game.

Any boss encounter will prove to be a challange, every encounter will become one if you raise the difficulty at all. One word of warning, this game is ADDICTIVE. I literally haven't been able to put it down since the DLC was released. Each class feels completely different. The only true drawback of the game is it's UI. At times the interface can be difficult. Some actions, escpecially in the inventory, take to many key strokes to accomplish. The menu hot keys are oddly selected too. Item information is displayed in a pretty hard to look at format. It seems the game's interface was designed with the keyboard in mind and not the mouse. The item filters need to be more specific. Being able to view the items based on armor type or weapon class would be handy. The hotbars get pretty confusing torwards the end of the game, when your character starts having more abilities than theres convinient room on the hotbar. Two, or more, active hotbars could alleviate this a little. It definitely takes some getting used to to become adept at interfacing with the game efficiently.

Just like Dungeons of Dreadmore of SWOTS: The Pit, this game eases you into the idea of a Roguelike gently so that you can try it out without it being quite as brutal as, say, Nethack or DoomRL. The graphics are not a selling point in this title, but the gameplay should be. With tons of unlocks, lots of ways to stat and build characters, castes and quests to choose that will vary gameplay widely, and a big variety of enemies, if you've never gotten into a RL before but would like to try, get this.

If you're like me and more experienced in the genre, I still recommend it as this does some interesting things with the forumula--the capacity for kind of rogue-like not-quite-permadeath; the ability to (for example) forswear all arcane magic in exchange for joining a new faction of the game and learning magic-disrupting powers; the fact that one school of magic is powered mostly by paradox (and you can meet and kill yourself! ?.?) means that this is much more in-depth a game than the RLs of the 90s. Sure, you can pick this up free on the developer's website, but you should pay for it (here or there) just to support the effort.

Tome (the core game's name, Tales of Maj'Eyal is the story arc included) plays out like a skill-based version of our old friend NetHack, minus the bloat and with deep character building (not to mention MODS <3).

If you've played NetHack or Dungeons of Dredmor, or games of that style, the gameplay should be of little surprise to you.
You fight on a grid, turn by turn taking down your enemies while snatching up all of the loot you see.

The beautiful part is, the developers seem to have known exactly where to change staples of the series and where to keep things.

For example, you have the Chest of Transmutation, which is where all of your loot goes into. Anything in the chest doesn't affect your encumberance until you take it out of it, and anything you keep in the chest when you transition between maps is transmuted into currency (don't worry, you are given a prompt to move anything you need on transition).
This keeps the inner loot whore in us all satisfied with grabbing everything, while also helping to keep the trash loot out of our inventories.

Little things like this make this game have all the fun of the roguelike genre without the busywork that just isn't fun at the end of the day.

The UI is mostly clear and easy to use with mouseover tooltips for everything that matters, there's a good tutorial to get you started, and the game also has some usability/playability improvements over other rogulikes, one of them being auto-exploring the current map until something interesting is spotted (or a ladder to the next level reached when everything else is explored). There's quite an active community pushing out addons, and the game itself is actively updated as well.

ToME can be played for free by downloading it from te4.org. Buying on Steam gives you Steam e-weenie growth (achievements), Workshop (not required for addons, but handy) and some features like the stone warden class. Also supports the developer.",1389578294,1389578294,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The support is amazing; every issue or bug I've faced has been addressed, worked on, & fixed in less time than it takes for me to get ahold of a real person on most customer support lines.  The player base is helpful with in-game questions.  Oh, & the game's creator has a fun habit of giving out random buffs or extra dungeons to everyone online when he's feeling squirrelly.

I've truly been blown away by the quality of the experience ToME offers, as you can see by the crazy amount of time I've spent after only a few days of owning it.

ToME manages to stay incredibly faithful to the roguelike genre, offering the big three parts (turn based gameplay, randomized maps, and permanent death) but providing it in a way much more relevant to today's gamers; there are varying levels of difficulty, allowing you to play with extra lives or turn off permadeath (at the cost of not being able to earn achievements or upload your character to the server to show off) and it comes pre-loaded with a beautiful graphics pack so you needn't play in ASCII if you'd rather not.

The amount of content in the game is fantastic and the randomization handled well to provide excellent replayability and a truly enjoyable experience; it can also be tuned to provide that insanely grueling challenge that Rogue and Dwarf Fortress survivors like to call ""Fun.""

You can choose if you want to play with a single life, multiple lives (getting more as you level) or infinite lives (if you're a chump). It's easy enough to die if you're not sure what you're doing or get in over your head but most deaths feel fair, with the rare RNG reaming thrown in.

There's a fair few classes to choose from (easily 20-25), ranging from your typical sword and board fighter or fireball slinging mage to disease spewing filthmancers or combination time-mage fighters, though many of the more interesting classes need to be unlocked. A bit of exploring will get you most classes, with some being a bit harder to find. There's also 8 or so races, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and it's easy to bounce back from each death with a new character or a new build in mind.

I have put more time into this game that I would have ever expected. I actually heard about this game a while ago when it was based in Middle Earth but I never gave it a chance. I missed out. I finally decided to try the free version and I loved it and figured I'd buy it on steam.

For starters, this game is HARD. If you have never played a roguelike before this is at least more inviting with decent graphics, but it packs all of the challenge. In a roguelike, if you die you stay dead. However, there is a more forgiving adventure mode, and even an unlimited lives exploration mode. In my opinion, exploration mode should be ignored. You need to learn to value your character and every move it makes, and being able to die over and over spoils that.

The main campaign is long and hard. It has a level cap of 50 which will just barely be reached by some races, and not hit by others due to experience penalties. Don't worry though, those races bring great bonuses along with the penalties. You can be a Yeek, a little while furry creature, and summon other yeeks or move faster than one turn allows. You can be a more traditional elf, summoning trees to your aid, or a dwarf that gains bonuses from hoarding his cash.

How hard is the campaign? You might die on your first map. You might die to your first enemy, if you're unlucky or unskilled. However, you will get better. Of the starting classes, the berserker has the ability to fight all the way to the end and survive, while learning the ins and outs of the game. The alchemist is much more fragile, but can summon a golem to aid him; it's nice to have a friend along for the tough journey. New classes, races and categories are unlocked by accomplishing various goals, from killing a certain boss to dealing one million fire damage.

There are abundant side quests, and they offer much needed bonus experience and items. The game has a randomized loot system and powerful uniques, like many modern RPGs. The skill system is deep and rewarding. You will think hard about how to distribute each precious point, and when you die you will look back at where you went wrong and how you can correct it for the next run.

My first character was a Higher (noble/special human) alchemist, and I died on the second zone that I entered. The enemies were higher level than I was, and it was just the wrong place to be in. Second I tried a Cornac (common human) berserker, and died in the game's final battle. That was a painful loss, but I went back to the drawing board and came in with a Wyrmic; a dragon-based character with the power of nature on his side. This time I made it, and managed to unlock almost everything along the way as well (except for the aforementioned one million fire damage, which took me a lot longer).

The game is offered for free, with the paid version offering very little additional content. However, I have to strongly recommend purchasing the game here on steam. This game deserves recognition, it's a really great and lovingly crafted roguelike/rpg. The more purchases it gets, the more it will gain prominence and the more work will be done on it. According to his website, the developer has many more campaigns in the works, including one that lets us play from the side of the villainous (or downtrodden and misunderstood?) orcs.

You have to option to play with more lives, even infinite lives, but I always play on the ""roguelike"" mode, where you only have one life, unless you find more. Knowing what is happening around you at all times is a must in this game, as losing focus of even one enemy can mean death, as I learned the hard way in my most recent death (opened a door, orc necromancer on the other side, managed to escape at first, but on my way back to see if I could get around him, was flanked by his summoned army of skeletons and ghouls). This is a true roguelike, with everything happening in turns as you wander through forests and dungeons, killing everything in your path, picking up loot, buying weapons and armour, and, when you make a mistake, dying with no continues or reloads (at least on roguelike mode). All in all, a really fun game full of challenges and endless replayability. 7.5 / 10",1388477388,1388477692,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I love Rougelikes. They're swimming in options and strategies and are playable in either small chunks or long sittings, their random nature makes them highly replayable, and they're just generally nifty keen.

That said, they also tend to be cruelly unforgiving and really frustrating in the early levels, combined with obtuse interfaces and extremely unhelpful in-game information.

Tales of Maj'Eyal takes the good and throws away the bad. It has more starting options than any roguelike I've ever seen, and has a fleshed-out world for you to explore. The interface, while not flawless, gives you all the information you need to make good choices and the early levels get you used to adventuring without killing you because you tried to mount your horse from the east instead of the west, or whatever.

This means that the game offers huge amount of content, almost cluttered UI but for a patient gamer opens up as a solid option for those that want to experience the deep roguelike setting with some improvements. 

First of all, Tales of Maj'Eyal is a free-to-play game, by buying it you will receive some improvements/add-ons to it but the core gameplay remains same. As a Steam fanboy and a roguelike fan it was enough for me that the game was on Steam but I'm not 100% sure if it's enough for those counting their last dollars since you can enjoy this game legally without paying, though it's always nice to help the developers ;) 

In Tales of Maj'Eyal you pick a race (Human, Elf etc.) and a class (warrior, wizard) with some unique options not seen elsewhere. You begin your quest in pre-determined area (dungeon) and after moving through it you get to the world map and are free to go wherever you desire (although you will get killed in most of the places you *can* go). There are several difficulty options to choose from between few extra lives and permadeath. 

You can also unlock new races, classes and quests by achieving different things in-game (no spoilers here) but it will take some time to get to that point since the game is rock hard. By the time I'm writing this I've played something like 6,5 hours and haven't scratched the surface yet so there's definitely a huge amount of content and replayability here.

If you have ever played/enjoyed ADOM this is a game for you. 
If you want to see what those old roguelikes would be today this is game for you.
If you hate dying this *might* be a game for you. 

Pros
-Graphics
-Hardcore difficulty
-The amount of content
-You can use mouse and/or keyboard

Cons
-Graphics (some people concider tilesets ugly)
-Difficulty (it really is)
-The amount of things you will have to read and learn (Steam guides help with this one)
-You can get it for free

If I was stranded on the proverbial desert island and had only one game to play this would probably be the one I'd pick due to the sheer replayability.

Pros:
+ Tons of classes and races to pick from. Even choosing the same race and class through multiple playthroughs you can select different skills and builds for a very customizable character.
+ Abslutely no re-skinned classes. Each really is unique in the way it plays.
+ Huge game world to explore with tons of different enemies and items to discover.
+ In-depth lore if you like that sort of thing.
+ Lots of unlockables give a sense of progress and persistence bewteen games.
+ Skill-based strategic game play
+ Scalable difficulty. 
+ Modern mouse-driven interface.
+ Modern customizable UI and HUD.

Cons:
- Graphics are kind of meh.
- High learning curve at first.
- RNG can still screw you sometimes, but it's much less of an issue here than in other rogue-likes I've played.

Other:
= No consumables. All your abilities and items work off a cool-down system. I like this feature a lot, but if you enjoy potions and scrolls you may miss them here.

Also, the in game community is 100% helpful and polite so if you're stuck with anything you can usually just ask in chat.

Donators Custom Tiles
Basically this will allow you to choose a custom tile for all your characters, so much more fun! Also donator's characters with custom tiles will show up on the character's vault!

Custom Tiles and Exploration Mode
Exploration mode is basically a game mode where you get an infinite number of lives, for those that want to see the story unfold faster.

Items Vault
For each 2€ of donations you gain one slot in the online Items Vault. This allows a character to send items to the vault and an other one to grab it from there. This feature can be accessed through the Fortress ingame.
Stone Warden class

Donators get to enjoy a special class: Stone Wardens. Only dwarves can be Stone Wardens, they are a melee class that dual wields shields and is both proficient in arcane and nature. While most of the world thinks those two forces are opposite, the dwarves have found a way to merge them.

For example, as a Rogue you can choose to specialize in stealthy gameplay with devastating sneak attacks, deadly traps, or a brawling play style with dirty fighting techniques that give you the advantage when facing foes. The choice is yours, and in addition to stats, each race gives a pool of 4 unique abilities you can also choose to train up, making different race and class combinations play somewhat differently.

Another feature of ToME that I don't normally see is an overworld system. After clearing your introduction dungeon you'll be thrust out into the open world, free to explore and attempt to clear dangerous forests, dungeons, and hideouts of foes. It makes the game feel large, like your adventures are part of the world of Maj'Eyal and not just isolated to a single deep dungeon.

Finally, ToME is extremely mod-friendly. Don't want to unlock all the classes and races yourself? There is a mod for that. There are mods for new items, new classes, new dungeons, etc... You name it.

I am not yet very far into the game, but I have no reservations recommending it, especially giving it a try for free on their website: [url]http://te4.org[/url].",1387930475,1387930475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The category of ""roguelikes"" has become rather broad and vaguie in the last few years, IMO primarily because the originals were so limited by technology that different gamemakers have tried different takes on what made them so fun.

ToME is probaly the very best game in this category since the original Rogue and Nethack, because it has the correct answers. there some real role-playing in it as well as some good tactics, so you can have fun all the way through the game. The balance between random generation and meaningful player choices is more even - you are unlikely to die because you never found the key kinds of items you needed, but every game even with the same starting character and overall strategy will play differently.

I also applaud these folks for releasing the dev tools and module source both to foster modding and to let more technical players track down fixes for data-based bugs.

So far I've only made it to the mid-game with one of the fighter/mage hybrids. I was sent on quests, entered a handful of dungeons and had a really good time.

So far, as of December 2013, this is by far the best roguelike available on Steam. The only games for me that come close to this are NetHack, ADOM (coming to Steam soon) and Brogue (free). A big thumbs up.

[b]Dungeons of Dredmor[/b] is one of them, [b]Sword of the Stars: The Pit[/b] is another one.
[b]Tales of Maj'Eyal[/b] is a roguelike game in it's truest sense, however, it has some gameplay elements that I personally didn't see occuring that much in other RL games like [b]ADOM[/b].
For one, there is pretty much no division between activatable skills and magic spells (something like what [b]Dungeons of Dredmor[/b] does). The main difference between them is that different classes use different types of power points (warrior classes use stamina, arcane mages use mana, hate for afflicted classes) that behave differently (mana gets restored with time for magic classes while hate is only increased by hitting hard and taking damage).
Another major difference is the absense of magical potions or scrolls. Those are replaced by infustions. A character can store a limited amount of infusions that can be activated any number of times (those can be replaced by new infusions), except that they have a cooldown. This greatly changes the health restoration system other roguelikes and action-RPG games have. Instead of stacking with a huge amount of potions that you drink at will, you have to take note of how much health you have, how much you lose in combat, and how many turns do you have to survive until you can use another infusion.
The game itself can be downloaded for free from [b]te4.org[/b].

If you want a deep but easy to play roguelike with massive replayability due to the unique classes available with profound customization for each class. Then look no further. I've never played a game where you can erase the existence of an enemy through temporal powers, become a dragon wielding a massive two handed sword with various dragon-breathes, murder people in their sleep (literally), and even create a small undead army at your disposal. 

This game has been carefully crafted in various ways, for one the grind that's in some games is gone in this game, where shops restock only by your progress into the main campaign and you later get a item that separates what you find from your inventory until you decide to put it in your inventory, then, there's the fact that enemies you face have various tactics. For example, a corruptor can conjure bone sheild that negates all damage for 3 attacks! So if you never invested in a way to deal multiple hits with one attack, you'll have a more difficult time! Then the UI and interface is fully customizable, you can even auto cast spells, such as buffs and take them off your UI!

There are various items that have unique prefix-suffixs stats and effects attached to them, much like diablo or torchlight for example. Many powerful items are guarantied to drop from a boss, (aka a yellow artifact item) and if the item doesn't suite your need, you can store it away for the next character you make to use! If you don't even want to use that item, then you can convert into not just gold, but into energy for a special building you acquire. The progression of this game is really solid and at times depend on your race, as some races level up more slowly, but are innately stronger then others. There are plenty of random events and quests that you can undertake, yet they aren't completely random to the point of unfairness.

The skills and abilities you can acquire are amazing and unique! You can create a gravity mage, or a invincible sword and board user that utilizes deadly counterattacks, or even a summoner where you can sacrifice creatures for various effects or control creatures to make one powerful creature! Then you have player races with unique abilities as well, for example a dwarf can eventually phase through walls, and a ghoul that can basically throw up on the ground that damages enemies and heals you! Last you have prodigies that are power and unique feats you acquire later on in the game, for example you can have a effect where an attack will kill you, but you'll save yourself from death, while slowly losing life to the point where if you don't heal you'll actually die!

The main story is quite interesting and there's a ton of lore that you'll find and is quite deep. Some of this lore can help you find secrets through-out the world and clear up some of the strangest things you'll encounter... There are various difficulties available, so you can have a more casual experience by not losing your hero after he dies, or a more hardcore one where you have one life to live with stronger enemies!

These combine to determine which ability groups you get to put points into.  And points can be scarce--pretty much all character classes can be played 2 or 3 different ways, and some can be done 4 or more different ways, depending upon how you spread your points around.  Add in a mostly-fixed overland map with mostly-procedurally generated dungeons and some tough boss and miniboss fights and an amazingly varied loot system...and you've got a game with frightening levels of replayability.

I knew I should have been more careful….Shiiiiiiiit!”).

It´s the same stuff you play through all the time.
And it is. The dungeons don´t change (at least their names and their bosses. The dungeons themselfes are still randomly generated) and it is always the same order of stuff you have to do.

I spend nearly 300 hours in this game and never got tired of it. But still: 9 points for being the best RPG i know, thus being the best roguelike i know thus being one of the best games on steam.

Surprisingly enough, you'll come face to face with rare mobs on a fairly regular basis with nice loot, but they're not just going to hand them over to you.  No Siry Bob....you'll have to take it from his/her/it's cold-dead, clawing/oozing/hairy or whatever type of hand.
Lots of choices on the type of character you want to play, and you actually unlock more options of all kinds to make your next play characters even better or to try something completely different.  Don't worry, you'll be playing more characters you can count on it.  You can only die so many times, if at all, before your character goes bye-bye to the beyond.  Just use his death as a great excuse to try out that new unlocked race/class/gear or whatever.
Anyways, try it out, I'm sure some of you will be caught off-guard by how fun and good the game is for it's download size and price as I mentioned.

Dived into this for about 2 hours, and it drops you in a rogue-like sprite-based fantasy world with quests, monsters, loot and a huge amount of achievements to be scored. Got through the first few screens and solved a few quests but still no achievement. It plays and feels like a standard game, nothing really special but I suppose I only scratched the surface because the potential is there.

I already loved the old version which was based in Tolkien's middle-earth and played like angband. The story has since been moved to a new campaign world. Also the classic scroll/potion-mechanic was traded in for a different system of cooldown abilities. Combat was overhauled for a faster streamlined experience -no farming, mobs don't respawn. Good for beginners although hardcore roguelike-veterans might miss typical roguelike chaos. Unlike other roguelikes the number of realistic interactions is low so you will not dip a rod in a potion or throw a ring in a sink here. No need to memorize 10000 key binds. Everything is already identified. The focus clearly lies on fighting monsters and straight action. Complexity is achieved by balancing your equipment, stats, and abilities + tactical fighting + knowing when to fight or run. 

Some features:
The game is as deadly as most roguelikes however permadeath can be switched off, too. Many advanced races and classes can be unlocked by actions in the game so there is always a reason to start the game anew and try a different combination. There is a built-in chat/news flash so you can read if another player gets wasted, hehe. High-Scores, Mods. Procedurally generated dungeons, static over-world with some dungeons/events randomly placed.

핵앤슬래시/아이템수집/캐릭터 성장에 완벽히 집중하는데 성공한 게임

다양한 아이템의 활용은 적지만 전장을 넓게사용하는 반턴제의 전투는 전략적인 플레이를 가능케하며 
또한 각 클래스는 일반적인 rpg에서는 보기힘든 굉장히 개성있는 스킬을 가지고 있어서 매플레이 새로운맛을 느낄수잇음.

디아블로에서 포션꿍쳐놓고 미친듯이 마셔가며 하는 플레이를 해소하기위한 inscription/rune 시스템은
쓸데없는 귀찮음을 해소함과 동시에 전략성과 긴장감을 동시에 잡았다.

또한 요즘 은근히 이런거많지만 싱글게임이면서 현재 플레이하고있는 다른사람과 채팅하고 아이템자랑하며 노는것도 쏠쏠한재미
게다가 서버에 굉장히 많은 통계를 저장해주어서 다른플레이어에게 자랑 및 자기기록보면서 흐뭇해하기 딱좋다. 
제작자인 DarkGod이 가끔 특수던전을 열어주기도함.

허나 반복적인 플레이를 요구하는 로그라이크치고 (죽지않는다는 하에) 한플레이가 너무 길고 쓸데없이 몹이 너무많은거는 호불호가 갈릴듯.
그리고 마지막으로 서버가 늘 좀 불안한데 DarkGod이 이걸로 돈많이벌어서 서버좀 좋은데로 옮겼으면 좋겟음.

쓸데없는 얼리억세스 게임사서 울지마시고 5년넘게 업데이트되서 컨텐츠 풍부한 Tome4를 해보시라.

Fantasy, turn based, w/the key roguelike elements of permadeath (no re-loading to your last save if you die, have to re-roll a new character and start over from scratch instead) and great difficulty (but not insurmountable).  Through your many deaths, however (and there will be many) - you will learn how to survive to the deeper reaches of the game.  

Great unique classes too.  Many of which are unlike any I have seen in any other game.  If u just enjoy speccing out characters in rpg's and mmo's then this game will scratch that itch too.  Though many of the classes need to be unlocked through achieving things in game in order to play them.

The game has a free version too, so you can try before you buy.  Buying makes you like a 'donator' and you get extra features like a class and a game-mode that free players can't get.  But you can play for free and still unlock the majority of things.  

I'm buying even though I already have the game and have been playing it for years, just because Darkgod and contributors have put so much good work into the game that if anyone deserves some of my game $, they do.  So if you're not sure about the game, give the free version a try, then come back and buy it if ya like it.

Purely single player, but has an in game text chat feature so ya can talk to others who are also playing at the moment (if you wish).  Lots of helpful people in the chat, and can link things into the chat from your current game.  

Has a couple expansions, and in spite of how long its been around it is still being developed and added to even today.  Edit - Still true in 2020.

Gave it many chances over the years but always left with the same impression: way too grindy, at least early on, and too few interesting decisions per minute.
