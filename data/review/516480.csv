This particular one of the thousands of competitors is a minimalist precision platformer with one notable gimmick, a limited ""flight"" mechanic that replaces double jumping and lets you sort of glide a little.  There's also wall jumping, but that's about it.  The game is a particularly difficult precision platformer, which doesn't add much to an extremely mediocre experience. 

One important note is that even though this is an amateur project, it does seem to be sincerely and genuinely made.  I couldn't find any flipped assets, plagiarism or any other kind of insincere actions from the developer, but unfortunately genuine intentions alone are not enough to produce a brilliant PC gaming experience.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The graphics here are some of the worst, laziest attempt at video game ""art"" I've ever seen.  It's hard to suggest this game even has graphics.  It's just untextured, basic pixel blocks and blobs, the kind that an infant child might be able to create in 5 minutes on MS Paint.  It's clear the developer didn't even try to produce any real graphics for the game and just phoned it in.  It's unclear why such a lazy approach was taken, whether it may be caused by lack of talent, budget, or motivation to do their job properly.  It also doesn't matter... what matters is that this has resulted in a game with zero visual appeal for gamers.  It's an immediate failure on that measure alone.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The controls and game handling are notably very floaty and imprecise.  It's janky and unsatisfying to play... and any experienced gamer will tell you, the handling, responsiveness and general gameplay feel of the control scheme must be well polished for this kind of game to succeed.  Unfortunately, this is something the developer seems to have phoned in, with little to no apparent gameplay testing or polish done.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Because this is designed for consoles, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the inferior console gaming appliances that the game was designed for.  These are unfortunate compromises and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was a second thought for the console-centric developers.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for consoles forces upon a game.  Once more, console peasants have made gaming worse for everyone.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Pinkman didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for beating the 5th level in the game, trivial to get, but less than 29 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a modest spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

So, should you buy this game?

Pinkman is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Oyun 17 Ocak 2017 tarihinde yayımlanmıştır. Oyun, kendisini ""The Mind"" adlı ölümcül bir fantezi dünyasında kaybolmuş bulan pembe tenli bir kahramanın etrafında dönüyor. Onu diğerlerinden ayıran şey, hayatta kalma ve gerçeği ortaya çıkarma arayışında çok önemli bir beceri haline gelen olağanüstü osurma yeteneğidir.

İşte Pinkman'ın bazı önemli yönleri:

    100 El Yapımı Seviye: Oyun, her biri sürekli tehdit oluşturan ölümcül tuzaklarla dolu, özenle tasarlanmış 100 seviye sunuyor. Oyuncular oyunda ilerlemek için bu zorlu ortamlarda gezinmelidir.

    Sıkı Kontroller: Pinkman hem gamepadler hem de klavyeler için duyarlı ve optimize edilmiş kontrollere sahiptir. Oyuncular füzelerin üzerinden atlamak, duvarlara tırmanmak ve mayınlardan kaçınmak gibi hassas hareketleri kolaylıkla gerçekleştirebilir.

    Güzel Paletler: Oyun, geçişler sırasında seviyelerin görsellerini dinamik olarak değiştiren on altı çarpıcı renk paletine sahiptir. Bu, Pinkman'ın minimalist ve renkli ortamına görsel olarak çekici bir dokunuş katıyor.

    Hardcore Zorluk: Pinkman hızlı tempolu oynanışı vurgular ve hayatta kalmak için oyuncuların hızına, reflekslerine ve osurma yeteneklerini akıllıca kullanmalarına dayanır. Dövüş söz konusu olmasa da, zorlu zorluk seviyesi oyuncuların tetikte olmalarını ve çeşitli tuzak ve engellerin üstesinden gelmek için hızlı bir şekilde adapte olmalarını gerektirir.

    Ölümcül Tuzaklar: Pinkman dünyası, her biri kahramanı ikiye bölebilecek yirmi farklı tuzak türüyle doludur. Oyuncular bu tehlikelerden kaçınmak ve hayatta kalmak için koşmaya, zıplamaya ve stratejik olarak osurma yeteneklerini kullanmaya devam etmelidir.

    Synthwave Film Müziği: Oyun, oyun deneyimini tamamlayan on parçadan oluşan bir synthwave soundtrack sunuyor. Enerjik müzik oyunun atmosferine katkıda bulunur ve genel keyfi artırır.

Ayrıca Pinkman, oyuncuların kontrol noktaları olmadan oynayarak kendilerini daha da zorlamalarına olanak tanıyan yeni bir Zor mod sunuyor. Oyuncular seviye seçme ekranında ünlü Konami Kodunu (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← →) girerek bu daha zorlu oyun deneyimini tercih edebilirler.

Genel olarak Pinkman, kendine özgü kahramanı, ölümcül tuzakları ve hayatta kalmak için osurma yeteneklerine olan bağımlılığı ile benzersiz ve hızlı tempolu bir aksiyon platform deneyimi sunuyor. El yapımı seviyeleri, sıkı kontrolleri ve synthwave müzikleri ile oyun, heyecan verici bir platform deneyimi arayan oyuncular için heyecan verici ve zorlu bir macera sunuyor.",1688891778,1688891778,True,2,0,0.538461565971374512,0,True,False,False,True,,,

 Read the full review here (Steam has a character limit): https://gemsimov.com/game-reviews/f/pinkman---a-review

Gameplay

 Ah, Pinkman. That’s a game, if I’ve ever seen one. You (the Player) are Pinkman, and you are placed in a multitude of levels, each of which has a simple goal for you - get to the exit after opening it.

 Pinkman, being a 2D side-scroller-esque platformer, in the vein of Super Mario Bros, but with the ability to go backwards, presents the Player with simple controls - A to go left, D to go right. The same can be accomplished with the Left arrow key (to go left) and the Right arrow key to go right. To jump, you press the Z key.

 You can also jump off of walls, which requires that you are up against the wall. Being up against a wall - by moving in the direction of the wall even when you are right next to it - you fall more slowly. You slide down the wall, and that’s when you can perform the wall-jump, by pressing the Z key.

 There are checkpoints, here and there, allowing you to avoid having to redo the entirety of a level when you die. There are hazards, of course, the most common being spike-balls (which are just spikes on the ground that look like an asterix).

 But you’re not limited to just running and jumping. You can far– Fly. You can fly (by farting), which allows for some interesting level layouts. There’s a gauge that fills up while you’re not flying (but after a short amount of time following a flight), which gauge is used to measure how lengthy your flight can be. It’s quite short, but there’s a solution - BEANS (told you you were farting).

 Picking up a bean (by walking through it) refills your flight gauge, allowing you to fly further. As stated, this allows for interesting level layouts. Not only that, but the way the flight mechanic works, you can treat it as a double jump, for it slightly properly you upwards even with just a tap, allowing you to extend a jump by up to 4 times, which provides quite the sensation if done properly.

 There’re also jump-pads, which act like trampolines, making the Player Character (PC) jump way up high… Which allows for even more funky business, such as a spike ball on the ceiling above the jump-pad. It is incredibly simple, in concept and execution, but it allows for some tremendously entertaining things when combined with the rest of the ‘simple’ stuff.

 It really never does get simple, beyond the first three or four levels. It keeps growing more and more complex due to the multiple variables in play. Homing missiles, as an example, are a very funky variable. Are there homing missiles on this relatively simple jumping level? Well, it is no longer relatively simple.

 That’s how difficulty in this game works. It is forgiving - courtesy of the reasonable checkpoint system - but it is also a bit unforgiving, in the sense that some of the segments in the levels are monstrously hard to get a hang of. But then the Player figures out what they’re meant to do and then wham, it’s suddenly simple in appearance.

 It keeps getting more and more complex, which introduces difficulty, but it never becomes conceptually impossible. And, seeing as a concept is what is most needed in platformers - knowing how to deal with the issues - that’s a very good thing.

 There’s also a hardmode, but it isn’t that hard, as it just removes checkpoints. When you’ve gotten good, you’ve gotten good, and you need no checkpoint to really excel. 

 There’s a slew of mechanics that show up and present more and more challenges, and it’s all impressively well done. Pinkman, although lacking the ‘I just enjoy the act of playing’, really gets close to gameplay design perfection. 3/3

Presentation

 This game’s opening screen is the title of the game - PINKMAN - and a spectacularly unexpected, wholesome compliment aimed at the player, which states: “Happiness looks gorgeous on you.”

 That’s a way to start things off, is it not? Unfortunately, the music accompanying it feels… Well, quiet. Very, very quiet, even when it’s the only thing I’m hearing. That, however, doesn’t lessen its quality. It’s some great music, as you might find out the entirety of the game has.

 In fact, there is one track. One track in this game is absolutely breathtaking… More on that later.

 The SFX of this game are also quite neat. In part because whenever the PC dies, they MIGHT let out the Wilhelm Scream, in part because they’re very much secondary to the music and are just there to provide a bit more feedback to the Player.

 Sure, it is a pixel-art game, sure, nothing in it is all that complex looking, sure, there’s little in the way of visual variety with the exception of the color of the background and the color of the foreground, but it’s enough for me.

 Not only that, but there’s also a very good, very comprehensive set of tutorials. Every time a new mechanic is introduced, there’s a line of text - a short one - that informs the Player of the mechanic in question. Some are redundant, because it is obviously a new type of gun, but others are quite important, because there’s really no way of knowing that going through the rhomboid shape creates a ghost that follows the PC and that the ghost kills the PC if it touches it.

 Wait what do you mean that wasn’t conveyed? Oh, right, this game treats the Player as a reasonable creature and allows them to uncover things through trial and error. In the ghost case, the important thing that does get pointed out is that it can go through walls, which is something the initial ‘go through rhomboid and die to ghost’ stage of research will not inform the Player.

 I’m of the opinion that this game has a really good presentation. Sure, it might be possible for it to be better, if the visual fidelity was greater, but I quite appreciate the look of things. It allows for immaculate smoothness and imagination, and that latter thing… Pinkman… Pink… Guy? 3/3

Story

 There is no story, folks. It’s just a platformer. 0/3

Legendary Point

 Does this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time? When I first laid eyes upon it in the Steam Store, I think I had obtained a coupon for it… or something along those lines. I see the game ‘Pinkman’ and, due to the fact that, at the time (and still to this day) I was mourning the death of Francis of the Filth, also known as Father Francis, also known as Filthy Frank or Papa Franku, the sight of a Pinkman, who was entirely pink, got my neurons colliding.

 Pinkman is evocative of Pink Guy, a character from the Filthy Frank Show, and one that I greatly appreciate. I suppose that this is one of the reasons why Pinkman is such a special game for me, yet I can not quite explain it to myself. That infantile sensation of hiraeth that has taken over me, in relation to the Filthy Frank Show, can not be the sole reason I’m willing to give this game the Legendary Point.

 And it isn’t. The reason I so appreciate Pinkman is, partially, his resemblance of Pink Guy, and partially the soundtrack. It is Synthwave (according to the store-page), but I couldn’t care less what type of music it is. It is music, it is great, lovely music that really tickles my soul and drags its metaphorical fingers through it, making me ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ in bursts of uncontrollable and inappropriate ecstasy. YES, Pinkman gets the point.

 …I miss Frank. 1/1

Conclusion

7/10. This is a great game for what it is. It’s a simple platformer that grows more complex the further on it goes, until, eventually, you beat it without really knowing that you have. I’d recommend it to everyone, maybe as a game for them to play or as a gift to present to someone - it’s engaging for an hour, maybe two, and it’s, as said, very amusing. The music might make you go back to it, too!

PROS:

+The synthwave soundtrack, while not written specifically for the game fits right in with its pixelated artstyle.
+While simple, the artstyle is clear and defined. 
+The controls work smoothly and are responsive. Pinkman feels fluid and fast, which makes dodging hazards a blast.
+There is little to no filler. Something is introduced every five levels which keeps the game fresh and exciting.
+The insanely low asking price.

CONS:

-Some of the pallets are bright and a little garish. It can be hard to see projectiles (such as the machine-gun fire) in some of them, while in others they are much clearer. This inconsistency can make a few levels feel frustrating if you die a lot in them.
-The 100 levels provided, while fun, make the game very short. 

-Lack of settings for control rebinds (or lack of settings in general).

Most of those cons are nitpicks though, and for a 70p game you shouldn't expect everything. Definitely pick this up if you can, as it's an hour or two of pure platforming fun you won't regret.

Pinkman is a very minimalist platform game in all factors. Obviously it is not a AAA game with millions of dollars invested, it is a game for you to enjoy its simplicity.
His visual made up of few details is really beautiful, it's like an abstract painting with well selected color palettes. The soundtrack is super relaxing, giving the feeling of exploring a world totally unknown and full of surprises. Its gameplay is more basic than a platform game, with few actions, no stress to learn to play, and with a great difficulty for the genre!
Pinkman is for those people who want something new to play, but don't want to spend a lot of money and time, being a great option for you to spend a few hours in a different universe, on a joyful journey to get out of the habit. No history, collectibles and nothing to worry about, just buy, download and be happy playing.

-Precision platformer

Fit for me:
-My fav genre so perfect fit!

Pros:
-Really clean, minimal aesthetic
-Every time you die, the color palette changes and there are a ton of different options
-Solid use of mechanics; I like the jet pack mechanic and think it was implemented well
-Simple mechanics of jumping and jet-packing done right
-Good job implementing new environmental hazards or mechanics to challenge the player
-Well designed platformer sections w/ generous placement of check-points
-Solid difficulty curve that never feels unfair
-Cheap as balls starting at $1

Cons:
-Very short, I beat the main game in under 90 minutes.
-Not as responsive as top tier platformers
-If you hit the jump button too quickly after landing on a wall, it may not register and so you'll fall down
-Most of the mechanics and overall gameplay has been done before

Thoughts:
-I had a really good time w/ this one.  I bought it during the summer sale this year and am happy w/ the value I got. 
 Yesterday, I saw that the dev just finished a major update, so I thought it was a good time to check it out.  I played through the 100 levels in 2 sittings and it was a really solid experience and I will definitely try out the No Checkpoint Hard Mode sometime soon.  This is an easy one to sit down and enjoy for both casual gamers and veterans alike.  I loved the endless color palettes and thought the jet pack was a neat mechanic that you don't usually see from games in this genre.  The soundtrack was subtle and calming, perfectly capturing the overall tone and feel of the game.

How are you doing today? I hope you're doing great.

I'm so so sorry you're having trouble playing Pinkman, because I really do care about everyone having a positive and enjoyable experience with my games (that's my main goal here). However, I don't really understand your language, so I would like to ask you to translate it to English or Portuguese if it's possible, since these are the languages I'm capable of reading and speaking.

According to Google Translate, your review says that you think the games is “tedious”, but without any further details. If this translations is indeed correct, would you mind about elaborating on what made you feel like that? Did you had any specific levels in mind when you made the review? So I might be able to help you with future updates. Otherwise, I don't think there's much I can do, since all reviews until now were very positive regarding level design.

Anyway, I wouldn't want you to pay for something you don't have fun with, so please, feel absolutely free to ask for a refund if you so desire, I won't feel offended or anything like that.

Thank you very very much for giving Pinkman a chance! I wish you find other great deals during the summer sale. 💖"

Pinkman plays a lot like Duck Souls, but with different physics. Instead of rolling, you can fly/hover, and the general feel of the game is a bit different. Both games are polished and fun, and feel like complete experiences in themselves. Still, they are remarkably similar, where Duck Souls seems like a more experienced dev's take on Pinkman.

I don't necessarily regret playing them both though. Both experiences were fun, and the different level design made them feel unique. If I had to pick between this and Duck Souls, Duck Souls would have my vote. Still, this one's cheaper, and I'd recommend playing both if you're looking for cheap games.

I absolutely recommend Pinkman, but with the caveat that I recommend Duck Souls even more. If you want a good, short platformer, you can't go wrong either way, but Duck Souls has the edge.",1593300291,1593300291,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm so so sorry you're having trouble playing Pinkman, because I really do care about everyone having a positive and enjoyable experience with my games (that's my main goal here). However, I don't really understand your language, so I would like to ask you to translate it to English or Portuguese if it's possible, since these are the languages I'm capable of reading and speaking. 🌍

According to Google Translate, your review says that you’re having trouble with the key bindings, because of the “Z” and “X” limitations, is that correct? If it’s, there are a couple of options that you can try: 

1. Alternative controls - It’s also possible to play the game with the WASD keys for movement and “J” and “K” for skills.⌨

2. Gamepad - Pinkman supports gamepads as well, which are just perfect for platformers like this. 🎮

My sincere apologies if your issue is not related to everything I just shared with you, in this case feel absolutely free to tell me more about what’s annoying you and I’ll try my best do help you. 💬

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
Let me start by saying that, especially for its price, the game itself is pretty good. Decent visuals and great music, as well as fairly good movement. (The ""fart"" mechanic is a bit weird to get used to but pretty fun once you get the hang of it). A bit short on content, but for a $1 game, that's to be expected. Fairly good level design as well, outside of a few levels that felt gimmicky. I'm also a fan of how the level changes colors each time you die, it makes it feel less repetitive somehow.

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
The collision can be somewhat iffy. There are several occasions where you clearly did not touch a spike, but the game thinks you did, resulting in an unwarranted death. This can be infuriating, especially during sections with tight platforming requirements.

[h2]Conclusion & Thoughts:[/h2]
The levels and gameplay are fine but nothing incredible, but definitely better than expected for the price. The music is also really nice. Could be better, but could certainly be worse.",1577510983,1578886578,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,4,True,False,False,False,,1577657871.0,"Hi, Nyahr! How are you doing? I hope you’re doing good.

Before anything else, thank you very much for giving Pinkman a chance, I really appreciate your support. From what I can see you had a very positive experience in general, which definitely makes me happy, however you also had a small problem regarding the controls, so I’m sorry for that, I didn’t meant to cause you any problem.

Pinkman is my very first published game here on Steam, so by the time I was working on it I didn’t had the technical knowledge to add such features, which were implemented on my future releases (Duck Souls and Rabisco). Pinkman doesn’t even have an options menu where I can add this feature you mentioned, but I could maybe add a secondary control scheme like “AD” for walking and “JK” for jumping and farting. This control scheme would always be active and could be used at any time. Do you believe this would make your experience better?

Again, thank you very very much for playing Pinkman and taking the time to review it, because I really appreciate your feedback on it. If there’s anything else that I could do to improve your experience, just open a new discussing and I’ll reply as soon as possible.

I wish you a happy new year! 💖"

This was my original review for the game which was not supposed to be taken seriously however, due to the fact that the actual developer of the game has commented asking about this review I guess I can give a bit more insight. (and also recommend the game)

Firstly this game has a simple vaporwave soundtrack which some might very much enjoy, in fact after letting my friend (who is in to vaporwave) play the game he said that he very much liked the music, so in that regard i can't say the music is bad however I personaly don't like it.

Secondly the game has a simple movement system with new obstacles that are added constantly which keeps the game feeling fresh and new however, the game is incredibly short which is something I think I should mention as im not sure what people are going to expect when buying the game.

Lastly I want to talk about the price, honestly I don't have much to say as it is a very fair price in my opinion however, it's important to say that if you don't like overly simple 2d platformers and vaporwave music this game might not be for you.

the reason my original review was ""not recommended"" was because I gave the game a subjective review and I thought of it as a joke however, I can see that making a joke like that can in turn hurt a great developer which is why after he responded I'm now sitting down to write this review.
(if you see this again mateus I just want to say keep up the good work and thanks for taking your time to address my review).",1570820004,1571296530,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1571819412.0,"Hi, Spooky Isaac!

Hi, Spooky Isaac!

Thank you very much for the more insightful information about your experience with the game, it will definitely help me shape my next projects, so I really appreciate your time and efforts to concentrate all this topics.

You’re definitely right, usually there’s a very passionate person behind each game on Steam, I know it’s important to alert people about bad games using the review system, however we shouldn’t use it to make jokes, because as you said, sometimes it might just hurt the developer for no real reason.

Thank you for the incredibly kind words! I promise I’ll do my best to keep making the best games I can and be worth your time.

If you're looking for a game that's challenging, but not impossible. Fun but will test your skills, then this is a game for you!!

I'll start with the bad (because I like ending things on a good note).

- There was only one real problem, I had with the game. That was sometimes the keys seemed to be sticky. You press jump but your guy would not jump. I did think it may have been me, so I tried different keyboards and my Xbox controller and I had that problem with all of them. Now, don't get me wrong. This was not a game breaking issue, I was still able to play the game and 100% it. It just meant it was annoying at time.

Now for the good.

- The graphics are simple and straight forwards. Yet pretty looking.
- The game play is straight forwards as well. Get yourself from point A to B without dying.
- The level progression is really good. Every 10 levels they add something new, which keeps the game fresh and challenging.
- As I mentioned, it's not impossible but it will test you! By the end, you will feel like you have really accomplished something!
- The sound track is nice, but to be honest. Most of the time I had it muted and was watching Netflix in the background.

That's about it! As I said, I only had one fault with this game. However it was nothing major, didn't ruin the game. Was still enjoyable and I do suggest for anyone that is looking for something fun but short to play through!!",1564697791,1564697791,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm quoting myself on this, but I also wholeheartdly believe that. If there is one, I'm yet to find it. It probably helps that I went in with no expectations, except that I was going to be playing a super hard platformer.

Unsure if on purpose, but it does feel planned and makes the experience all the more enjoyable.

Pinkman is a colorful, fast-paced, action platformer with a funny skill. What is that funny skill, you ask? Well, your main character is a pinkman who can fart to get a little extra distance or height on that jump. This fart is limited and after discharging, you will need to wait a little bit of time before it recharges. 

The game features 100 levels, with progressively increasing difficulty by the different types of ways to die. The later levels introduce obstacles that are more difficult to step around, as well as tighter jumps and smaller spaces while offering less reaction time.

I usually do not compare games with each other, instead I prefer to talk about the merits of the game as it stands alone. However, this game has more than enough similarities to another that I cannot help but bring it up.

With that being said, if you have N++ (NPLUSPLUS) you have a pretty good idea of what this game is about. Though this game takes away some of the momentum, and does not let you die from falling too far. Otherwise this game is only 100 levels, whereas N++ has 4000+ levels. But then again, this game is 0.99 USD. If you already have N++, you are not getting much more with this game. But if you wanted to play something like N++ but didn't have the spare funds to purchase that one, you should get this one instead.

The game works well with XBox controller, you can move with the left stick and d-pad (yay!) and the four buttons on the right are A for jump, B for fart, X for zooming in and out, and Y for turning the music on/off. X is important if you want to plan out your track, as the game starts zoomed in and you sometimes can't tell where you are and where you want to go. This is especially important in the later levels so you can plan out your path given the more time-sensitive nature of these levels.

Overall, this a good game, and it was developed by one person. The responsive jumping controls of a platformer is an important aspect that is unfortunately put on the back burner of some newer games that focus on flashy visuals instead. This game plays very well with the controller and with the keyboard as well. (I did not play much on the keyboard, only to test it out.)

Like I said above, if you want to get a good feel for N++ but don't have the spare funds, you can start with this game and see. If you like this game and finish it, then crave for more, it will not be too late to move onto the other game, because that one offers a lot more gameplay. For 0.99 USD, this game is totally worth it, and there is just enough interesting variations to keep you going level after level, not to mention the easy to reset if you fail (the game actually does this for you).

As one of my friends pointed out (shout out to @Crimson-Albedo), that this game can have rather dramatic color changes every time you die. The sudden shift, depending on the random next palette that you get, may be a bit harsh on the eyes, and that's really one of the only negative things to say about this game. Perhaps when you die, your pink character sprite sometimes makes a really strange dying sound effect that just does not seem right, but that's more of a personal preference.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+Fun platforming that's not too difficult
+100 levels that add or change elements every 10
+Nice soundtrack

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-Really the only con for me is that the color change can be a bit jarring sometimes. You might go from a greyscale with dark red to a white and bright blue within a single death. This can be a bit on the eyes

Definitely worth the pickup if you enjoy platformers and have a dollar to spare. Even less if on sale.

TL;DR below, to make you click that expand button.

I'm gonna talk so much shit about one level that I'd rather decorate that little piece of shit with the big ass ribbon this game ultimately is. Which is to say I'm starting with the [i]positive aspects:[/i]

One of the main aspects about this game that made certain areas get aroused was the price. You definitely can't go wrong with that. On sale it's only 0,49$. Which sure is better than chocolate but only because white chocolate got 6 cents more expensive than it at my local store in the last year. 

I've had my very fair share of platformer over the last year so I pretty much know my preferences and it's definitely a fast paced game like this one. Even the elevator platforming is good in this. Another thing I like in platformers is simple controls taken effective. Which means that you don't get punished for forgetting one button combination but that you can get to know the controls in two, together eleven words long, sentences including two commands. Which this game does. Literally.

I was first pretty sceptic of the graphics. I mean, woah 8-bit, never seen that. But I've grown at it like a baby at it's index finger now. It also has some good music too. Which by the way, is royalty free, can you believe that?

It has some real big guys challenges which is rewarding as hell even if you finish a level first try. Going back to older levels only made my experience with it better, I have fond and good memories about how I struggled on that level the first time. Not to say I didn't struggle the second time around. (Not talking about a certain level I talk about later)

There are time based levels, which I generally hate, but they are rather a mechanic here which can and is supposed to be tricked than an inevitable death timer. And that's just one of the reasons why in this game most... all of the deaths feel like my fault.

[i]The highly anticipated bad things:[/i]
First off there's level 29, where you're supposed to fart (similar to a jetpack) while falling down when hitting the button that opens the door to further progress in the level. You can refill your fart with beans to get up again. So far so good. The problem being that as soon as the fart runs out, even if you're only a nanoparticle away from a bean you're fucked. You missed the button? Well, fuck you. You're fucked again. Back to the beginning with you.

But maybe I'm just a noob here. Which, admittedly, happens often.

[i]TL;DR:[/i]
It's an almost perfect bag of platformer. Fast paced. Simple controls. Good graphics. Challenging. Masochistic. But Fair.
Only almost because there's a, for my skills, hard as nails level 29 thrown in randomly.

❗ Sobre
Pinkman é um jogo indie de plataforma que testa suas habilidades, reflexos e estratégias. O jogo é extremamente simples mas também bem completo, por mais que as imagens mostrem sua simplicidade, só jogando para você ver a qualidade do jogo. No começo o jogo é bem fácil mas vai aumentando a dificuldade com o tempo, mas fique tranquilo pois as 100 fases do jogo farão o jogo ter uma longevidade boa, além de não ser um jogo frustrante, sem contar que conforme as fases passam e entram coisas novas, as fases por si só explicam como cada funcionalidade funciona, sem a necessidade de grandes tutoriais. O jogo foi lançado em 16 de janeiro, sendo desenvolvido e distribuído pela Green Dinosaur Games, estúdio de jogos baseado em Taubaté - SP.

🎮 Jogabilidade
Pela sua simplicidade, não há muitos botões, apenas direcionais e dois botões de comandos, um para pulo e outro para flutuar como se estivesse com uma jetpack, mas na verdade é pelo ""peido"", tanto que em alguns momentos do jogo você pega feijões que servem para dar uma carguinha extra. O jogo lembra alguns outros do mesmo estilo, não só no visual, mas também na jogabilidade, sem contar que ele é muito bem otimizado, não notei nenhum bug por cima no meu tempo de jogo.

✏️ Gráficos
O famoso feijão com arroz. De fato o pinkman é um pink man, um homenzinho rosa. Os cenários são em geral pouco complexos, literalmente o básico mas bem feito, mas também nem precisa de muito para esse tipo de jogo. Um efeito legal é que a cada replay você tem os cenários com cores diferentes, sempre com um bom contraste.

🎵 Sons/Efeitos sonoros
Assim como nos gráficos, os áudios também são o feijão com arroz, mas bem relaxantes. Também há os efeitos sonoros em pequenos detalhes, como no personagem andando, nos props se movendo pelo cenário, ao pular, ao morrer, etc. Os pequenos detalhes que geralmente são ignorados em jogos do estilo, foram muito bem lembrados, mas se quiser pode mutar o jogo e ouvir outra coisa de sua preferência.

👍 Pontos positivos
> Nível de dificuldade progressivo
> Muito bem polido
> Excelente preço e custo/benefício

👎 Pontos negativos
> As cores podem ser um ponto negativo para algumas pessoas

It's a very cool platformer and a cool try n die. It's as challenging as it needs to be and I surprised myself to come back to play the game many times until I had finished it, which usually doesn't happen with try n dies.

I love the aesthetic too. Every object is unique and easily recognisable. It has great affordance, the controls are pretty responsive, the levels are not too long and not too short. Mechanics are diverse and come one by one and start getting mixed more and more, making the difficulty curve really well respected, with the first level that introduces a new mechanic being a bit easier and slower, and the next one start getting harder, culminating in that last level.

This is such a wonderful game. Not only is the platforming fun, it also provides a fine level of difficulty that makes each stage addictingly fun to play over and over again. The difficulty is fair but still hard enough to make you replay the levels a few times, which is great and adds to the replayability. There are 100 levels of pure intensity, each one different from the other. The stages are always changing colors, which is a little hard on the eyes sometimes, but it looks insanely good and really works well for this game.
The developer definitely put a lot of time, energy, and love into this game and it really shows, especially on the very last level (you'll see when you get there for yourself).

Pros:
1: I loved the simplistic design of the game,and with the shifting colors after every death it doesn't get boring.
2: The actual self control of the character is great and it feel pretty solid.
3: The platforming is fun and doesn't get boring with new elements being added here and there.

Cons:
1: Some of the levels have a gimmic that I'm not a big fan of, which is were it instant kills you right when you spawn.
2: Sometimes the jump key doesn't seem to interact correctly when you first spawn in.

Wow...I think there has been a gold standard set when it comes to games I've reviewed on my show. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you Pinkman, a very fun masochistic platformer that is in the same vein of Super Meat Boy, N+, and those before it.

There is so much going for this title that being priced at a cool .99 (and cheaper if you get it during the first week) makes it almost criminal to not recommend. Everything from the controls to the gradual increase in difficulty to the introductions of new mechanics and obsticals are all done in a way to only help the player understand what exactly brought them their doom.

Like many platformers of this kind, Pinkman offers very simple controls that support both keyboard and controller. I used controller in this case and the character handled very well and never felt too sensitive or weighty. In addition to moving and jumping you can utilize a jetpack (or ""fart"" if you perfer) to give an extra boost when trying to make up to other platforms or trying to avoid an explosive death. 

Never once did I feel like a death was cheap or unavoidable, something that could have easily been done to make players try over and over again to pad out play time. Every level I had played through for my review (1-35) felt fair, difficult, and fun which only made me want to keep playing once the video was over.

Altough the graphics are very simplistic, they also help the player to keep focused on the obstacles at hand. There's never a distraction thrown at you from how it's designed. The sound is also amazing and it kept my adrenaline going even when I suffered a round of deaths on a few levels.

If I had to nitpick, I wish there were options for recording how fast you beat a level. Games like this are a speed runners dream, and the lack of a time keeping mechanic just baffles me. Hopefully in a future update this can get added.

I have more to save in the video below, but overall this was a joy to not only discover but to review. Controls were on point, everything seemed polished, and it felt like a game with a purpose. Was this worth the .99 cents: absolutely! In fact, I was in doubt I'd ever find a gold standard when it came to games around this price point. Now I hope that I'll find other games that can reach this level of 99 cent enjoyment. Definitely give this developer your support.
