My initial encounter with “Ooblets” dates back to 2020, the year in which it was primarily launched as an early-access farming simulator. Originally, I stumbled upon the game on Epic Games inasmuch as it hadn't been released on Steam; which, much to the fandom disappointment—myself included—, so remained for three more years. I am far from being impartial, since I am quite keen on the genre in question and have had rather pleasant previous experiences playing Ooblets. It had an indisputable positive, soothing and heart-warming impact on my personal life, and I dare to say that this reverberated to countless other players, notably so during such an astoundingly obscure and somber period—if not the most of all over the last two decades—for humanity.
I, for one, had been highly anticipating the arrival of this game on this platform and I am much content with all the further improvements the developers brought into play. 
The storyline is now much richer and cemented compared to the its first version. The side quests and regions to explore have been expanded, matured and polished. All in all, I am satisfied with how the game turned out to be in these more or less three years of development. A true labour of love, as you surely will witness yourself if you join the game's Discord server. 
Just bear in mind that Ooblets never aimed at being profound or story-rich. It is what promotes itself to be: simple, cute, casual and relaxing. [strike]And oftentimes quite silly also, but in the best of ways.[/strike] This piece holds a special place in my heart (≧◡≦) ♡

个人感觉需要改进的地方是
1最后一段主线过分迂回了，爬个山接信号塔，为了完成任务中途要下山三次还是四次，如果有多条登山下山路线的话或许还能比较有趣，实际上是重复”之“字形的冗长路线，并且人物上山下山的速度也让人捉急，给我整烦了，后面直接穿溜冰鞋下山（现实这么干能摔成八瓣请勿模仿）
2接上欧布网这个主线有些单调了，每完成一个里程碑式的小任务后，得到最为显著的成果是，WiFi信号多了一格，在我家从卧室走到客厅WiFi信号还能多一格呢，换句话说激励性不强，玩家对后续剧情期待性不会很高

4可以再丰富一下NPC的对话，而且随着好感度的升高，NPC应该被触发一些更亲密的对话，比如说巴佐这个拽哥，初次见面他讲话很欠，熟的不能再熟的时候讲话更欠了，为什么这个游戏不能揍NPC呢，能揍的时候通知我，我要把巴佐的爆炸头扁成压缩饼干。

The lack of quality of life features in this games made it so I didn't even bother finishing the game once the last steam achievement popped.

Whose idea was it to create a farming / creature collector game and then not even making there an easy storage or sorting feature for them? The houses to upgrade and store the critters is cute at first but.. when you realize they don't get bigger, area wise, with upgrading. So even with a full house of critters they only farm and clean right around them meaning you need to build as many houses as you possible can if you want to have all the critters.

Didn't even bother doing something akin to a pokedex as these games normally do, instead giving us a wildlife area where we can ""set them free"" (which also isn't anywhere close to your home)

I didn't mind the dance battles much, I enjoyed they were turn based. It fit the relaxing theme. Until you got to the area where you needed to get the number 1 highscore on a bunch of arcade games or you couldn't progress. There went the relaxation! I even had to ask my husband to help clear them. 

And did I mention it was messy? Tons of people running around. Tons of critters. Tons of garbage in town that respawn every day. Tons of ""fun"" gadgets that doesn't so anything other than be ""fun"" and you cannot even sell them or delete them so you end up having to just chuk them away into a storage box and forget about it.",1711853702,1711853702,False,6,0,0.511067807674407959,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The musical aspect feels underexplored. Running a shop is extremely tedious, super slow, with NPCs taking ages to decide on something.

Good: The aesthetics and the vibes of the game are absolutely amazing, There's somewhat of a story that drives you to progess with a simplistic anti-capitalist message in there too, which is cute. Ooblets helping you farm is a cool take at farm automation.

Ooblets is a pretty good game so far. It's also funny to me because it's the second time in a week I've picked up a ""Pokemon clone"" game that... is not a Pokemon clone.

If I had to compare Ooblets to an existing game, I would actually go with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. NH, specifically due to how the game starts. Both games have a sleepy kind of pacing that's trying to remind the player that you don't have to grind every minute of every day. As far as I can tell, days of the week in this game exist mainly to plan out Dance Barn tournaments. Nothing is on a timer. You [i]can't[/i] get everything done in one day and honestly, once I managed to internalize that, I started having a much better experience.

Ooblets does have 'mons that you can raise and battle, and recolor+sparkly versions (catch-em-all does pay off, literally, but it's not on a crunch). Until you open the Dance Barn, you might end up going a day or two with no 'battles' at all. The battle system is simple in a good way, and the individual strength of your Ooblets is less crucial than strategy skills. Knowing what your opponent can do and how to counter it can help, but nothing feels insurmountable even when I lose.

One thing I find super neat is the way challenging wild Ooblets work - you need to pay a toll, and each Ooblet type has a different price. The price is the same across varients, however - so if you've gotten some Frubtose, you might find yourself waiting to see if tomorrow will have an Unusual or even Gleamy Clickyclaws available. Each game day starts with a report of what Ooblets are available and where, and you can check your bestiary at any time outside of battle to see what each one needs (provided you've encountered them before). This lets the player strategize if you aren't at the point where whatever resource is easy to get, yet.

The game has some mechanical jankiness at times, especially oversight (ie trying to check that Ooblet report or see what Hankerbot told you), but overall the game lacks urgency, so if even failing doesn't sting like it might in a game where that has more major drawbacks. 

The farming system is pretty interesting, and there's friendships, quests, and a wilderness area to develop. You can dress up your character and get new hair and new hair colors (not sure if it's possible to change name or skin tone fwiw). You can 3D print figurines of Ooblets you've found. The fishing minigame is painless and always pays out to some extent. Overall, it's a very enjoyable experience to just pop in for an in-game day or two. Plus, you can save anywhere, not just by sleeping.

One thing to note is the game is relentlessly whimsical, in the way that will either drive you up the wall or renovate your entire vocabulary (or both). If that's not your thing, this may not be the game for you.",1709882448,1709882448,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

除此之外，欧帕的对战设计也比较无聊，刚开始会有新鲜劲，一旦摸索出几套对战模式，搭配上对方的弱智ai，那就是单纯的无聊刷分了。抓不同的欧帕需要不同的资源，而这些资源基本都需要你种地获得，而种地的体验又很差……就导致又进入了死循环：

ストーリーもありますが難解なお話ではないので勘で英語を読んでてもどうにかなります。

良い点
・各Oobletごとにコモン・アンコモン・レアがいますが、ステータスが変わるわけではないのでお気に入りの色の子を採用しても問題ありません。カードバトルなのでそもそもステータスの概念がないのです。ただしレアは走るとキラキラの残像が出るので特別感はあります。
・Oobletsにアクセサリーをつけられるうえ、レベル10になると車も買ってあげられます。
・お店がほぼ常に開いていること。某牧場ゲームだと定休日があったり種が必要な時にまだ店が開いてない事が地味にストレスだったのでこれは助かります。
・実績フルコンプが容易です。

気になった点
・ステージ『NullWhere』等の暗いステージだとダンスバトルの時の明滅が少々目に辛いです。

1. MORE OOBLETS! MORE LANDS!
we love Ooblets, they are cute and stupid, and follow us. We need more, and more lands to explore. 

2. OPEN WORLD, MULTIPLAYER

This game is somewhat similar to open world Pokemon games by the way you accumulate Ooblets and find them in different areas. However, it is much more humane and ethical than Pokemon, as you ""dance battle"" Ooblets using cards, defeat the Ooblet in dance, and earn a seed. Imagine an open world, where you can find Ooblets in less limited terrains. And in the case that its multiplayer too, it would be awesome to play with other players, dance battle Ooblets for rewards (kinda like the barn but with real players) and earn prizes!

My thoughts: It has a strangely slow intro and it can be a little hard to know exactly what is going on and what you need to do. Once you are an hour in though, you really start to get into a good rhythm (heh) and it will all click. The strange way everything is presented really annoyed me the first time I played it but it definitely grows on you and it is endearing to say the very least!

The game runs really well, even on my Steam Deck and it's very much a game suited to the tuck up in bed and play before going to sleep style of game as if you play it as I have, on my main PC, you might get a little carried away and end up losing three hours to it... I mean I am not complaining but man, this game can be addictive as heck!

So, here are my thoughts:

Positives:
+ Game looks awesome and the art style is very unique!
+ It runs beautifully on my Steam Deck!
+ The dancing and card style battling is both hilarious and fun.
+ The sound is excellent! The music is top notch and the ambient sounds are also great.
+ There seems to be a nice variety of areas and other quests/characters to meet.

Negatives:

- The way each character talks might grate on some folks' nerves.
- It doesn't seem to run at anything higher than 60 FPS which on my main PC, is a little annoying as it can, and does, cause stuttering.

Overall thoughts: This game is really neat! It blends Animal Crossing with Pokémon in a very unique way and I really like it. It's a very interesting experience and so far, I'm really enjoying it! :D",1707866704,1707866704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Please skip this if you can enjoy the game solely w/o looking at ""the story behind the curtain."" I'm really glad for you. In fact, a part of me wanna [i]unlearn[/i] the drama and just enjoy the game too!

And if you decide to continue, maybe you might wanna read the official statement from the developer in ""We did the thing"" [1] and ""Regarding what’s been happening"" [2] first, to avoid my bias.

TL;DR: it's the classic question: ""can we support the art but not the artist?"", which, in this case the artist's behavior quite outweighs the art.

---

The controversy took place in 2019 when Ooblets signed a time-exclusive deal with Epic, and the dev announce it in a ""tongue-in-cheek"" tone [1]. While you can communicate a non-serious and/or positive update (e.g., holiday patch) with a relax/joke tone, communicating bad news is already dangerous in itself. The least you can do is make it formal (and that's not even guaranteed you'll avoid the backlash). So why still going on with the troll-baiting style, which almost ensure a disaster?

Ideally, that announcement should be short, to the point, empathizing, apologizing, and reassuring. Something like ""Due to our financial status, we decided to take Epic's deal, resulting in a one-year time-exclusive on Epic Store. We will be happy to see your support on Epic Store when the game is out. However, we do understand that some players are unable to switch stores; thus, we apologize for this inconvenience. Rest assured that our intention is to publish the game on every storefront, and we will make that happen as soon as possible.""

I'm aware that paraphrasing the statement won't make the backlash vanished (since there are [i]a lot[/i] of Epic haters). But at least, keeping it short means there'll be less chance to upset/offend someone with miscellaneous out-of-topic chitchatting, like suggesting people vent out the anger on the climate change instead.

For me, I'm not ok with [1] in the part the dev assume everyone play Fortnite. Well, here I am, someone who never plays Fortnite because of motion sickness. So I'm really wonder why the dev make such strong claim over a diverse group of people (especially when Ooblets has non-overlap target group with Fortnite...) Nonetheless, I saw the whole announcement as a bad-taste joke which I can tolerate. And, honestly, if I were in their position, I'd take the deal too.

I also understand that [1] meant to be communication only with their supporters. What I don't understand is why it's a public post? Especially when the dev seems fully aware that the statement will definitely upset the public: ""Okay, so we did the thing! The thing people get angry about. But maybe don't get angry about it?"" [3].

Of course, after the announcement, the dev got backlash. I'm not surprised. What surprised me was that the dev themselves choose to participate in this flame war. Well, I'm aware many screenshots are fake (like the Holocaust or the Malaysian's dad). But would those fake screenshots look [i]convincing[/i] and spread fast like fire if the dev choose their words wisely (or just stayed silent)? Not to mention that the real replies from the dev, although taken out of context, are still terrible way to talk to another [i]person[/i], regardless of being their customer or not.

And I'm also aware that, on the other end, there are people who send rape/death threats, which I condemn too. I condemn them to a greater degree than the poorly communication from the developer. Basically, no one should be sending/receiving such threat.

I know the frustration being on the receiving end --- been there too. We are human beings with emotions and biases. We get angry when someone crosses the line, insulting us. That prompts us to fight back, luring us to think that we have all the rights to return the violence, right?

But you can't fight fire with fire, especially when you are the one in the spotlight. You have everything to lose. Your reputation. Your customers. Everything. And what will the public anonymous lose? None. So why engage in this fight?

Well, I believe that the dev already learned it the hard way, as seen in the aftermath write-up [2].

However, there's an important point that's been overlooked in [2]: when you decide to fight in the public, you risk making collateral damages to bystanders, risk turning strangers into enemies.

And the damage has been done.

The least the dev can do is release an official apology. But no, [2] is just recap on what happened. Say thanks to their supporters. Never a sorry. (Go ahead if you gonna call it an apology. There's a huge gap between ""It was a stupid miscalculation on my part."" and ""I say means thing to people, sorry."" --- especially when the first one was followed by ""I recognize that none of this post equates to an apology in any way that a lot of the mob is trying to obtain, and that's by design. While some of what I've said was definitely bad for PR, I stand behind it."")

Sigh...

This world is not black and white. Not everyone outside of your circle is going to be your enemy. There are people who are not taking side too. There are even people who never heard your game before. And when these people decide to learn more about the game, will they gonna hear about the cute-relaxing gameplay, or the louadspeaking drama which turning them away.

The game has been out for a while, even surpassing the Winter Sale phase. The reviews almost land on the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" zone. But the total number of reviews was not yet exceed 1k! Compared to other indies in the same spectrum, I'd say Ooblets could achieve a number of reviews (and sales figures) larger than this by a magnitude or two. (To get into perspective: Stardew Valley has 500k reviews, Hades 200k, Celeste 70k.) And that's is a missed opportunity, which I strongly doubt that the game would be more successful if it resolved the controversy better. (See No Man's Sky for how to comeback from the controversy. And IIRC, Hades was once Epic time-exclusive too, but still loved by players [i]everywhere[/i].)

We are human after all. We made mistakes out of our stupidities. Everyone does that at some points in their life. Of course, no one should be punished forever, but it takes effort to ensure this kind of mistake won't happen again (or at least won't happen easily). While an apology won't help resolve every kind of mistake, saying a sincere sorry is a sign that [i]we[/i] realize we are a part of the problem, and we're willing to fix it. (Besides, saying sorry literally costs nothing, except, maybe, one's ego.)

I guess people won't forgive the developer easily when they don't even bother considering saying sorry?

(Last but not least, it's seems like the dev already achieved the ""magnet"" aspect they sought for, only that it didn't quite attract customers to Epic Store [5], but attracted the same kind of people to their community instead. Either the haters who're gonna attack the game forever, or the overprotective followers who're gonna defend their dev [i]no matter what[/i]. Especially Tim Sweeney, who fans the flame, instead of helping resolve the conflict [4]. All of them share the same qualities of being impulsive, unapologetic, overconfident, and trolling. Maybe this is the classic ""you reap what you sow"" & ""birds of a feather flock together"", huh?)

Sorry for a lengthy post, which has nothing to do with the game at all. And thanks for a great case study on how [i]NOT[/i] to do a PR.

Ooblets is a charming game with great visuals -- unfortunately most of everything else about it is...alright. Outside of combat, the gameplay boils down to collecting items (whether by growing it or foraging it) and turning them in. That's it, that's the gameplay. Other features in the game such as fishing and townie relationships feel like their presence is an obligation more than something with any depth or passion behind it.

It's very clear this was made on a small budget and I think in some ways it's impressive what they pulled off, but in others I think it really made me yearn for something with more depth. The combat is mindlessly easy. I only lost 2 fights in my first 10 hours. Just spam hype cards at the beginning of combat, then point cards. That's all you need to know to win 95% of encounters for the game. And another thing, as a lot of other reviewers mention, requiring 3 X resources in your inventory in order to fight/collect new Ooblets in the wild is lame and is clearly a way to shoe-horn in the crafting/farming system you are already constantly doing to progress in the game.

I don't mean to sound overly negative about the game, it's charming and some people will really dig what it is. But it hurts all the more because I feel like this was close to being a great game instead of an okay fetching-items-to-progress-the-story-simulator.

I have played it for 83.1 hours and have all 27 achievements. It's graphically pretty.

Having your Ooblets be able to get driver's licenses and drive around in vehicles at max level is absolutely adorable, and watching the occasional wild Ooblet slamming into things in a tiny car is great.

I have laughed several times at the NPC dialogue and references, so the humor is generally to my liking, and I do find the game cute in the silly way it names objects. I don't particularly care for the instances of toilet humor in the game. There are several things that are referred to as ""tooting,"" plants named after farts, and the Ooblets audibly fart out seeds, which I find kind of gross and not relaxing.

There are several things in-game that are not explained which you have to use a search engine to try and find answers to. These include: What do Ooblet levels do? What do your own personal levels do? Are Gleamy Ooblets better stat-wise than other rarities? I still haven't been able to find an answer to the second and third ones.

This game lacks depth compared to similar farming/RP-type games because your relationships with the NPCs remain very surface level, and it feels like you're just repetitively grinding small talk with the NPCs in the town on a daily basis. You don't really establish a bond with and a sense of pride at improving the town like you do in Stardew Valley. 

The end of the game comes quite confusingly and I found it somewhat unsatisfying. I saw no reason to play anymore after the last quest. The game did not offer any more achievements or goals to pursue, so getting more currency or collecting more rare Ooblets was pointless.

If there were some more features added onto the game it could feel less grindy:

I wish there was an option to establish a deeper relationship with the NPCs, something that would allow you to choose someone to move onto your farm with you. I always enjoy the option to romance in these types of games, or to have a roommate. It feels a bit lonely all by myself with my trail of Ooblets on my farm.

There are some quality of life improvements that would make this game friendlier towards people who have progressed further. We should be able to move buildings on the farm without stripping them of their Ooblets, which leads to a micromanaging disaster, especially if you don't have space for them to be stored. You can't sort/filter your Ooblets by what building they are assigned to, or even in alphabetical order. I have 112+ Ooblets now and it's really, really annoying to try and find them when I am swapping them between myself and my farm. Being able to name your chests would help, as well as being able to split stacks of items. Farm buildings should show what and how many seeds are stored without having to go through a cutscene to look into each of them.

I wish fishing was more than just spending a long time getting bait and pressing a fish button and receiving one dispensed piece of randomized loot. If there was a mini-game option that gave greater rewards, that would provide more allure.

I wish your Ooblets' costumes didn't go invisible when they were assigned to farm buildings, and their designs weren't hidden underneath straw hats.

I wish there was more variety in music and dances. Hearing and watching the same thing over and over again in dance battles gets repetitive.

I wish that your character's eyebrows would match your hair color as you change it. They just stay a clashing color all the time.

I did run into a few bugs as a PC user with a keyboard and mouse. There are some parts of the game that don't support WASD movement, and some parts that are buggy, like the 3D printer which won't allow you to scroll down with the keyboard. Often a middle card in dance battles cannot be selected with the keyboard and you have to use the mouse to select it. Somehow I ended up frozen to a computer screen in the game and had to force quit the game to reload it.

I recommend the game, as it does a good job of keeping you playing despite being somewhat grindy and repetitive.",1705839577,1705839996,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Been waiting for this game for years and while I can tell the devs put a lot of work and heart into the game there's just really not a lot of meet to it. From what I understood in the marketing, it was supposed to be equal parts: 
Stardew Valley: farming and meeting interesting characters and getting involved in their stories. 
And another equal part Pokemon: meeting and collecting monsters, mastering the battle system (dancing) 
and that these two halves would make a holistically unique game.
It's in fact just less involved Stardew. There's a bad battle mechanic you do sometimes.
There's also monsters, I guess. Cool.
The vibe gets grating and obnoxious after a while. Very wannabe adventure time and regular show with the made up vernacular and low self esteem teen comedy. I don't know maybe I'm just too old to gel with it. 
The NPCs are all bland and boring, with barely any ways to interact with them. The farming is weirdly really hard to make money with? It feels like no matter what you're doing you're barely making end's meet. 
Like dude come on I have to collect resources to battle monsters? And it doesn't tell me how to get the item I need to battle the monsters? There's no way to track what monsters need what food from the ooblet manual in the pause menu? There are plenty of other people, including club leaders that are basically gym leaders, but I can't battle any of them? I can't see what teams they make and strategies there are and learn about their personalities through battling? You couldn't put tool tips to explain the mechanics or what they mean? I can't even edit my deck, it's just a collection of really terrible base cards and whatever I get through leveling? Come on.
I was looking for something that would let me pick and choose what I wanted to do so I could have fun with the game that I bought. Not a time-locked chore sim.
One of the regular things that you do in the game is mash A to collect a pile of cans to feed into a machine that takes MINUTES to make bait so you can watch the same animation and get junk from the ocean. Almost every thing you do throughout the day is pretty much exactly that. They're not fun and engaging, but they're things you HAVE to do to progress. They're not suggestions, they're not ""things you can do if you're out of things to do/need ideas on what to do today."" They're required to get any sort of economy going. 
It's disappointing, tedious, and, at times, annoying. 
Sorry, Glumberland. I wish you luck on your next game. Like I said you guys are clearly passionate and had a vision and I respect that. Maybe with some polish this could be a really special game for the right kind of people. But I don't think I'll ever be that kind of person.

1.  SO many lil guys.  A game for lil guy fans.  And you can dress them up. And they can drive vehicles.  What's not to like? 
2.  The game is very forgiving about time. There's no incentive to play daily, but at your own pace!  (Other than holiday events I guess.)  So if you're away for a few days due to life it'll open right where you save.  Plus, you can save in the middle of the day too!
3.  No weirdly hard fishing mini game compared to the rest of the gameplay.
4.  Fairly fleshed out NPCS, despite the amount of characters.  And no friendship decay (that I've spotted).  
5.  Still getting updates!  

Things that annoy me a bit about ooblets:
1.  You can't really customize the deck that you build, but rather the ooblets that you choose are the way you customize your deck.  As someone who is a fan of deck based games this is something I had to get over.
2.  The dance battles can be repetitive. 
3.  Sometimes the changes of nouns (ei, caroot instead of carrot) can be funny, but some can feel childlike in like, a bad way. 
4.  A game like this would 100% be a great place for modders (lots of customization options, low poly models), but mods aren't supported.

I'm so happy that a farming sim hasn't gone the way of so many others with overly graphic battle/combat.  Dance battles?  I'm here for them!

Solid 8/10.

I had to take points off for the visuals.  It's near to impossible to see anything when it's snowing or raining and as someone who wears glasses?  It can give me a headache at times straining and struggling to see.

Also, points were removed for how short the story is.  It was over so quickly that I've already completed a second play through!

Those two points are not game breaking though and everything else that is positive about this happy little game more than makes up for them.  It is a farming game, so having to collect/grow things to do dance battles or complete tasks is to be expected.  Some of the items are harder to obtain than others and that is what makes it challenging and adds longevity to the game.

- story is good
- resource balance is good

Bad:
- battle AI is nonexistent, both for ""wild"" battles and ""versus"" battles
- parts of the game feel unfinished, locations exist solely for story and to provide resources for player, there's nothing interesting there after you done the story part and only reason to visit them is to collect resources
- everything, EVERYTHING is tied to farming and gathering. You want to battle wild monsters? They require items to even begin battle, items obtained through farming (and then crafting) in 90% cases, want to improve and automate your farm? Better get back to farming and foraging. There's literally no other activity besides farming and gathering. Your farm is full and you're waiting for crops to grow? Better till a piece of land over and over so that you can nap/sleep to skip a day, or visit all other locations to see if resources respawned

Ugly:
- visual design and sound design sucks the soul out of me
- everything is a chore
- even minigames suck the soul out of me
- NPCs are useless, Friendship system is meaningless, it just gives resources. All NPCs are pretty much cardboard cutouts, stupid, boring, insufferable or all of the above.

So far, I enjoy the vibe of the game.

It's also a bit like Pokemon, but only the player can initiate having a battle with the wild Ooblets (if they have the required resources to do so).

My main cons so far about gameplay:
- Unable to set framerate (seems to be uncapped and varies between 144fps to 40fps depending on the area loaded)
- Chests cannot be placed outside your house. Player has to constantly go in and out of the house to grab things to craft at the furniture store.
- In Dance Battles, there's no descriptors for things like Fluster, Trepidation, etc. I had to manually go look them up on a fan wiki to see what those actually did.",1703585990,1703585990,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,True,,,

This is a cozy, slow game where you collect cute animals, farm, and play mini games. The dance battles are delightful and adorable. The dialogue and references to modern life are cute and comical. It's like a cute alternate reality, and I LOVE the vibes!

I'd recommend this for any age person that enjoys enchanting, calming game play. If you enjoy Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, or any game in that vein, you'll likely enjoy this one too! I personally use games to distract myself when I need some calm in my life. If you're looking for something like that, this is perfect. There's not too much hand-holding and it's not too juvenile, so it's great even for experienced gamers and adults.

TL;DR:
Great game, very calming. If you like Stardew and Animal Crossing, then you'll probably enjoy this since it has elements of both.

Special in the fact that after a 1 year wait to get it on steam, Glumberland is still hard at work making a fantastic game even better. Is it good though? Well this is a tough question to answer but the reason is with all the fun activities, where do I start with?

I guess at its base it's a farming sim, the meat of the fruit and veggies is that you will be planting and watering a lot, kinda like other farming sims such as Stardew. The twist is that the second biggest aspect of your new farm life is that you must dance battle other plant/animal/robot monster things to get seeds to grow your own allies to get in even more dance battles! Shake it Followbabies!

Other notable aspects are doing tasks for the mayor to help develop Badgetown, the town you live in, and progress the game's story line. Travelling to lots of different locations. Talking to people all over the world and giving gifts to help develop friendships. Raising crops to sell and cook into tasty dishes. Daily dance tournaments that give exclusive rewards. And my favourite task of all, tracking down beautiful colourful ""gleamys"" (they are effectively shiny pokémon folks) and really taking to the dance floor with tracers and sparkles as I dance the night away! There's also fishing that has no mini game! You just put bait on the line, cast it away and you're always guaranteed to get something, wow!

If I haven't sold you on the ridiculous zany fun that is Ooblets by now, perhaps this is not the game for you. It is kinda a niché music card battler farming sim dance battle extravaganza.

Games that you play at your own pace, often involve entirely low-stress encounters, and piggyback off of the 'cozy' aesthetic. I'd say that Ooblets fits under this category, but as a glowing example of what I WANT with this experience. Since I'm super autistic, I'm not skimping on the details. Here are the multiple factors that drive me to recommend this game to ANYONE:

1. The ""cozy"" aesthetic. Let me get one think clear, this game doesn't simply come off as 'cozy.' Describing it simply by that one term isn't fair to the energy the developers created. The game is weird, silly, charming, and much more. Of course any game with farming as a primary mechanic is going to feel cozy, but when little creatures sprout from seeds you planted, of course ""cozy"" isn't all you're getting.

2. Ooblets. The game is CALLED Ooblets, and for good reason. The creatures that you will encounter are called Ooblets, and let me tell you.. these little guys are so varied and charming. The creature design here is so charming, as they feel like if something you doodled on the side of your math notes was fleshed out and fully rendered. The ones here are already great, and judgeing by the consistent updates, I imagine more will be available. I am OBSESSED with these little guys, and I can guarentee you will be too!

3. Dance battles. This mechanic is one of my favorites. Are you ever playing Pokemon and feel bad that you have to hurt yours and another Pokemon to progress? Not here. If you encounter Ooblets out and about, you get them by making your ooblets DANCE OFF with them. I won't go into details with how the mechanics work since you'll figure it out when you play, but its FUN. And when you beat an ooblet, instead of catching it and taking it away from its pals, it gives you a seed that you can GROW ON YOUR FARM, and raise to be your very own. Basically mechanic good.

There's more I COULD say, but I'd rather people just get the game and explore. I'm not quite finished as I'm trying not to rush through the game, but it gives you a LOT to do, and all of it feels incredibly fun!",1702005262,1702005262,True,98,2,0.899095475673675537,0,True,False,False,True,,,

模拟农场玩法：适合不那么需要高拟真度的农场类游戏爱好者。比如星露谷的季节设定、高难度钓鱼、多工具模拟（镰刀、矿镐、锄头等等），Ooblets简化了很多种地的流程，很轻松，而且比较前期就可以制作出来全自动洒水器，非常省事。这对我来说是加分项，我想体验种田，但是不想深度体验种田。

蔬菜精灵收集：种出精灵来这一点很有趣，而且可以通过精灵让农场种植全自动化。精灵分为三个稀有度，中后期可以解锁闪光精灵，非常酷炫。但是解锁全图鉴的吸引力其实不是很大，精灵稀有度不管如何，技能都是一摸一样的，到6级就可以解锁全部技能，但又不是所有精灵都好用，所以我挑那几个技能好用的精灵跟着就行了。因此中后期有闪光精灵后，精灵的普通、稀有形态我都懒得继续解锁了，因为奖励也很少很少，没啥全图鉴的动力，这个点感觉有优化的空间。

游戏引导设计：不太好，说实话基本没什么引导。收到的信件看一下就没了，没得看记录。还有我一直到后面自己琢磨才发现精灵屋只管旁边一小圈地不管其他地，除了一开始教你浇水翻地，后面的玩法基本都没有教学或者引导了。

游戏美术设计：非常可爱，玩到后面两个图，从那种2.5D视角，换成3D视角，有几幕很打动我。整个游戏就是围绕着可爱两个字设计的，我觉得非常非常优秀，在可爱领域登峰造极。

内容文本设计：所有可特殊互动的朋友、主要店铺都放在初始小镇，后面虽然能解锁很多图，但是做完主线也只能用来捕捉精灵和买种子，支线剧情太单薄了，希望能够有拓展，那么大个地图有点浪费了。

战斗设计方面：很有意思，是卡牌战斗模式，并用舞蹈对决的形式替代战斗，在以往玩过的卡牌对战游戏里，比较像平安京百闻牌。每个精灵在3、6级会分别多解锁技能，加上初始技能总共三个技能。但是！！！体验几次之后就开始变得又臭又长，不能跳过动作，不能加快，每次我去比舞仓库，就要浪费好多时间看精灵跳舞，能不能优化下，别逼我看，有时候我急着去种田真的不想花好几分钟看跳舞。

总之觉得，是非常好玩儿，很适合喜欢可爱东西，喜欢种田但是又觉得星露谷太肝，并且喜欢卡牌对战的休闲玩家。太可爱了，为了可爱来玩儿都能值回票价，玩的心情很好。",1701756111,1701756111,True,10,0,0.659969091415405273,1,True,False,False,True,,,

If you're looking for a super story based game this game isn't it. There's really no connections with the characters or the ooblets and it's not as engaging as I had expected it to be. I feel as though it's more based on mainly collecting and farming and kind of accessorizing your character and your ooblets. The map starts out super small and it threw me off and also the fact that farming is what you rely on the most but it's difficult to make a good earning in the game. There needs to be more ways to earn money rather than having to sell things or do quests that still require you to collect crops or materials. The ways you can collect materials is also very limited as you run out of wood and rocks eventually and have no other way to obtain them as far as I can see from the amount of time I've played other than buying them. The drawing and ooblets are fun and the dancing is interesting but it's always the same thing and it slowly starts to be less engaging since it starts to feel more like a grind instead of having any strategic way of winning.

To begin with, it is truly relaxing and the mechanics are perfect.
I have tried other popular names like Coral Island and in most of these games I couldn't really relax because I'd never find ways to make proper amount of money and the controls of farming, like selecting the right square to water would be very tedious. I couldn't get past my frustration with those games.

With this game, I never even got frustrated. The fact that there is a separate farming mode in Ooblets makes it so much easier to control. There's a variety of tasks you can do if you want to make money in some other way as well! The game is humorous in ways you wouldn't expect and the ooblets are the cutest. I also really enjoy where the updates are heading, such as the addition of Ooblet Vehicles. It's sooo fun to see a random ooblet drifting somewhere you don't expect sometimes.

This game allows me to have fun without having to be a hardcore player.
Other games with the ""relaxing"" tag need to learn something from Ooblets. If I wanted to grind, I'd play Dark Souls.

It's always nice to see a game continue to receive such love in it's updates. Ooblets is a fairly simple game with an adorably quirky style that does a great job at combining the farming sim and creature collecting genres. Some may say it lacks depth but I really don't think it needs any extra depth, as it's meant to be a silly little game where you collect silly little creatures and make them have silly little dance battles with catchy music.

與NPC的互動感比較薄弱，同個對話會出現在不同NPC身上，除了對話、解任務、買賣好像就沒有什麼互動了，這點比較可惜。

不知道是不是因為還在遊戲前期，一天下來沒什麼事情可以做，錢也比較難賺，重複性比較高，隨著升級遊戲內容會越來越豐富，還是很期待之後開店的。

It came at just the right time, I've been going through a rough time and I just needed something cute and simple to take my mind off things. Ooblets scratched that itch.

The game is a cute mix of farming, creature collecting, daily quests, friendship building, and dance battles.

Farming can end up being fully automated so long as you provide seeds once you have enough ooblets and ooblet houses, so you can move on and explore.

I enjoyed all the different islands you go to. They change it up too so it's not always just dance battles you need to do to accomplish thing (though I think I liked the dance battles the most).

Eventually you can even open your own shop and sell your items to the townsfolk. I never really ran out of things to do as the game progressed, if anything I always wished I had more energy and time in the day so I could do more. Which isn't a bad thing at all.

I'm glad I started playing during the Hallowe'en event. There were lots of cool spooky items to get for my house and with all the leftover candy I was able to recycle to make lots of bait for fishing which helped a lot with supplies I needed towards the end of the game.

Oh and I really like their take on shinies (gleamies) in this game. If they spawn, you'll know. There's shooting starts and fireworks around the town so you can't miss them, you just need to look around a bit. So while it's still down to change that they'll spawn any given day it's not down to chance per encounter.

Anyway this game has a lot to love. I've already gotten all the achievements but haven't finished the main story yet. I'm at the very end though, and I'm glad I played this game.

There isn't much commitment needed either, you can play as much or as little as you like without feeling the pressure to get to the next save or the next big thing like in other games. It's just good casual fun for as long as you want or need.

Pick up Ooblets and have a splenda time ;)

The plot line of the game is very simple and not too bad, there isn't a 'finish' for the game. After you finish the main storyline you can keep farming and playing ooblets. 

When you first start the game it is a bit grindy because you have to earn in-game money to be able to afford to upgrade your farming tools and other things. But, once you get to a certain part of the game, making money in it is fairly easy. 

I am glad the devs realized that the achievement section isn't limited to just getting all of the ooblets, all the recipes, and or all the crops to harvest.

OBS: Sei que esse jogo no passado teve vários problemas com a [b]Epic Games Store[/b] e a falta de respeito dos Devs, não concordo com a ação deles porém não estou aqui para julgá-los e sim para falar somente sobre o jogo.

[h1]Resumo do jogo[/h1]
O jogo mistura vários tipos de ideias em uma coisa só, eu acho que daria [b]RPG[/b] e [b]Casual[/b] como gêneros desse jogo. 
Basicamente você chega na sua cidade nova e descobre que tem que ""salvar"" a cidade ajudando a construir e renovar estabelecimentos assim como no [url=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing]Animal Crossing[/url], as formas de ganhar dinheiro e materiais é comprando sementes, plantando, cultivando, vendendo a colheita e limpando sua fazenda, ideia tirada do [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/]Stardew Valley[/url] e outra coisa tirada desse mesmo jogo é o sistema de energia e horário; Para conseguir fazer progressão no jogo você participa de um sistema de batalhas de criaturas que é muito inspirado no [url=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon]Pokémon[/url] também, apesar das batalhas serem em [b]Card Game[/b], e sobre isso não se desanime com o jogo pelo fato do [b]Card Game[/b], eu não gosto desse gênero e adorei esse jogo, é um [b]Card Game[/b] bem simples e fácil nada complexo! O jogo também tem um sistema de amizade com os NPCs mas não é nada muito complexo também. O sistema de colecionismo do jogo é muito bom para quem é perfeccionista e um detalhe com isso é que mesmo depois de você pegar todas as conquistas do jogo ainda há muito o que se fazer no jogo então eu diria que para pegar um 100% real você chegue perto das 90hrs.

Eu joguei o jogo das duas formas que ele permite, com controle e mouse + teclado, achei muito bem adaptadas e não tive problemas, você pode mudar de controle no momento que você quiser não precisa abrir nenhum menu para isso.

[h1]Progressão[/h1]
Esse jogo é daqueles que você começa vazio e sem entender coisa alguma, e do nada parece que aprendeu a ""língua"" do jogo, já sabe tudo que precisa fazer, o nome dos Ooblets e não consegue parar de jogar porque tem tanta coisa para fazer que você só vai indo, e quando vai ver já é 5 da manhã! E apesar do jogo não ter tanta coisa comparada com outros jogos maiores, eu acho que tem na quantidade certa, um pouco mais e um pouco menos teria deixado ele irregular na minha opinião.

[h1]Estilo gráfico e OST[/h1]
O estilo gráfico do jogo é muito ""relaxante"" de se olhar, muito fofo e engraçado, os personagens ficam dançando por aí, a animação deles de conversar é hilária, já dei muita risada com coisas básicas desse jogo, e os designs dos Ooblets são perfeitos, bem originais e com muito carisma. Os menus são simples de fácil entendimento não tive nenhum problema com isso. E as músicas seguem a mesma ideia do jogo, a primeira vez que você escuta você não entende nada, aí conforme você vai jogando, você vai dançando junto com as músicas, muito boas, complementam muito o jogo, perfeitas!

[h1]Localização[/h1]
A falta de localização desse jogo provavelmente é o maior ponto negativo dele, muito chato em 2023 um jogo lançar sem o idioma português, não tenho problema em jogar inglês porém é sempre bom ter jogos localizados para nós.

[h1]Considerações finais[/h1]
Se você é fã de [url=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing]Animal Crossing[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/]Stardew Valley[/url] e outros jogos com essa vibe pode ir fundo que você não vai se arrepender, embora eu diria que o preço é um pouco alto pela quantidade de conteúdo, eu esperaria uma promoção!

I read a lot about this game. It is highly suggested on different forums when looking for something cozy. I was expecting a great game.

But... I was really disappointed. IN THE BEGINNING.

This game at first, for the first several hours, was super confusing. I had no idea what to do. There's barely any handholding. I don't like when games treat you like an inefficient toddler but I also don't like it when they leave you alone to figure EVERYTHING out. But if I had to pick the lesser of 2 evils, I'd choose the former.

This game at first is confusing af. I had to keep googling how to do things. I didn't understand how anything worked. The game gives you less than the basics when you start.

However, now that I am 20+ hours in, everything is so much better. Don't get me wrong, I still have to look up certain recipes and how to do things but the game is SO much fun. And it IS relaxing. You can do everything at your own pace. Yes, there is a clock but nothing is constrained by time restrictions.

This game is highly addictive in the farming Sim category. You need to grow various amounts of crops in order to make money. Some of these crops need to be further broken down into ingredients to use to battle ooblets in hopes to get a seed. This seed, once planted and cared for, will grow another ooblet and further grow your little army.

I haven't played many card based battle games but once you get the flow of this, it's highly addictive and cute.

I really recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun farming sim that allows you to take it easy. Be patient (more than me!!), explore, and enjoy.",1699159864,1699159864,True,11,0,0.633062005043029785,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The overall experience is truly enjoyable, but there are a couple of minor setbacks. The regeneration time for certain materials, like Quibs, can be a bit frustrating. Additionally, obtaining some recipes after completing the storyline can be a tad difficult. It would be great to keep receiving recipe papers for all recipes instead of relying on the dance barn.

[h1]欧布大陆的极致休闲之旅 [/h1]

[i] 在这冰冷无情的城市里 [/i]
你厌倦了城市的灯红酒绿，尔虞我诈，踏上了驶向欧布大陆的小船。在那里，你将拥有一片属于自己的农场，结识脾气古怪但是善良的小镇居民们，更有机会收集并培养虎头虎脑的欧布小精灵。你满怀期待，开始幻想未来的生活……（总感觉所有的种田游戏都是这个剧情模板233）

[i] 你你你你要跳舞吗 [/i]
本作的基础玩法与世面上的主流种田游戏别无二致。发展基建，扩大农田，早日住上大house，美美装饰；与小镇居民们对话，增加好感度，解锁道具；完成各式各样的跑腿任务，赚取丰厚的报酬。除此之外，本作还融入了极有特色的跳舞——卡牌战斗的玩法。玩家可以给与欧布精灵心仪的物品道具，与其斗舞，通过卡牌战斗的形容决出胜利，然后获取其种子。玩家播种培养后收货就能拥有该欧布精灵，每欧布精灵都拥有专属的卡组，让玩家在以后的斗舞中拥有更多的可能性。同时每种欧布精灵都拥有三种不同的形态，喜欢集齐图鉴与收集马拉松的玩家一定会乐此不疲。总体而言，本作的游戏玩法与大部分剧情任务设计都只能算中规中矩，但得益于作者营造的轻松休闲氛围，接地气的本地化，总是让玩家沉迷其中，时间不知不觉流逝。无聊的午后，伴随着游戏悠闲放松的音乐，种种田，斗斗舞，好生惬意。

[i] 购买建议 [/i]
也许为了迎合游戏悠闲放松的调性，游戏的节奏被放的很缓，如果你是个急性子，长时间的游玩后，必然对战斗拖沓的节奏感到不满，同时拘泥于卡组较低的构筑自由度，这也是游戏被诟病最多的地方与痛点。倘若你能接受并享受这种缓慢的悠然自得与惬意感，那么这款游戏不容错过。游戏目前看会有动森一样长线更新活动版本，反复游玩性有一定保障，性价比不错。

[i]其它吐槽 [/i]

有些对话一定要走到相应位置才能触发，有点浪费时间。万圣节活动类似于单机抽卡，但是会出重复道具，不能快速收集齐道具，且很多地方的动画不能跳过，非常折磨。游戏的手柄适配不是特别好，按键设计有点奇怪，且没有震动。最后的最后，联机模式，plz。

It starts with the language. Just about every noun - proper or otherwise - has been been intentionally misspelled or changed to a diminutive or punny form of itself. Treats become ""treabies."" Fructose? ""Froobtose."" Watering can? ""Dribbly Can."" Hoe? ""Dirt scraper."" Coffee? ""Beanjuice."" I leave you to deduce what ""fartichokes"" are. It's like kawaii culture and Australian slang had a filthy, greasy pound session under a neon tarp in a vacant lot, and both were sober enough to know better. Your item list by the end of the game is such a confounding jumble of nerdy lunch table inside jokes that it's hard to keep pushing through.

So, you may be inclined, if you are over the age of 20 and just a slight bit jaded, to view this joyful, goofy, carefree, psychedelic mess of a thing with the same wry, dissociative disposition as you would your sugared up grade school cousin. Fun to watch, but the check better cash soon.

I think Ooblets largely delivered what it promised, if not how it promised. Publishing cat fight aside, the game is a unique mashup of the cozy farm and monster collection genre that is worth a look. The detailed animations, quirky characters, and small sprinkling of expectation subversion will occasionally inspire a half smirk.

There are warts. Lots of polygon clipping between character costumes and the environment. The item management needs to be massively streamlined. Storage is far too expensive and takes up far too much room. The day/season cycle seems to be a strange mashup of sleep-to-save/end day cycle of Stardew and the real-time-is-real-time convention of Animal Crossing. You can't pass time without sleeping or napping, but you must be low on energy to nap or after a certain time of day to sleep. Seasons appear to follow the actual season of the year. I spent the entire game in Halloween.

Also, the last area you visit as part of the main quest is obnoxious, requiring you to go back and forth on a long mountain path, and then return to Badgetown, repeating this for each NPC on your way to the top in an increasingly-long trek.

When I went through the recent reviews of this new release I kept seeing comments referring to some controversy with the devs. But I wanted to just play the game unbiased and here's my honest review of what my experience has been so far!

[h3]Things I like[/h3]
- There is SO much to do, like all the time. I never feel like there's nothing I could be doing with my day in-game. 
- The Ooblets are so cute. I mean do I have to say it?? (yes, yes I do) They are adorable and there are [i]so[/i] many to catch my GOD. The gleamy versions are actually kinda rare feeling too so that's cool. (I was afraid they wouldn't be)
- Plenty of items to collect, hoarding items in games makes me happy and the game offers many a container for you to store them in. 
- The player shop is very fun to operate, there are many mini games in Ooblets which I appreciate. 

[h3]Things that need improvement[/h3]
- Some sort of icon or something in our Almanac indicating which Ooblets you've already scanned/printed statues at the Lernery would be helpful. 
- a mini-map of any kind to toggle with 'm' would be super helpful. Especially for the later areas that are much larger. 
- More clothing/player customization! There aren't a lot of cute clothing options in the game. Some of the shoes clip through pants and some hats don't fit most of the hairstyles. Eyebrows I wish would match the hair color for example and a lighter skintone for us vampires? Maybe spend gummies to unlock special skin colors like lilac, green etc.?
- Icon/something to indicate quantity of the furniture item you've clicked on to purchase. I've accidentally bought multiple of something I didn't need copies of a few times now.
- Quick use function for the consumables on your hotbar? Unless there's a secret I don't know about I have to hit tab and click to use each consumable, making my hotbar useless unless I have a hankering item/tool there.
[hr][/hr]

Overall I love this game and I'm sure some things will be worked on in time, very happy with this so far though. It is pretty grindy but I'm the type of player that enjoys grinding. Happy gaming!",1698343755,1698343755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Along with that you have an insane amount of resource usage for these quests and with the price for seeds and how long it takes to grow some crops you never have enough cash. 

The one thing that really gets me is that this game does not have you water your crops first thing in the morning. It goes by whenever you last watered each individual crop. So let’s say you watered and planted some seeds at night and some in the day (because after selling somethings you were able to get more seeds), well at night is when the soil will dry out again for those crops that you watered at night, then during the day the other set of crops will dry out. Now imagine you have planted a variety of plants all through out the day. This creates chaos. Especially when you have used your stamina away from the farm because everything looked watered before you left, but when you return every other plant pops up dry and you have zero stamina to water them.

If you want a cute creature collector with unique game mechanics and a fun farm  piloted by little dudes it's worth it (just don't level up your coop past 2 or you'll never see your crops! lol) but beware that the endgame quests are less than fun fetch types and you may not even be working towards anything since the last quest is locked out.

Usually, I prefer to play games that direct us what to do instead of us figuring the game's mechanics on our own 
However, I am really really glad I've decided to take a leap of faith and give this game a go~

It may take a little while for us to fully grasp what's going on and what to do, but I think that lies the beauty of this game

[h1] What can we get out of Ooblets~ [/h1]
Sooo ooblets are those cute little creatures that we can tame if we win them in a dance battle~  and the dance battle is like card battler, its so so adorable when they dance and the music is eargasm, hahaha xD After winning, we can plant them like a crop XD (you'll see~)

There's also uncommon and shiny variant of it, I am very happy that I managed to find at least one of em, haha!

I relied on the ooblets wiki to figure out how to get the item to start a dance battle with an ooblet and stuff :P

Some helpful beginner tips:

[*] To get planklets, we can break logs / twigs

[*] To get nurnies, we can break rocks, we can get Oobsidian by breaking rocks too!

[*] To get some plant seeds starting out, we can clear weed and we can get seeds at times~

[*] Check your mailbox! I didnt initially and there was quite a few things I've only learnt when I checked them, hahaha

[*] There's daily tasks for us to do, if we can complete them, we can get wishies~

[*] Explore around the town, collect stuff as you go, like those fungus you see, they are needed for task progression~ Also you can enter houses! we can get useful items in there at times!

[*] Unlock the friendship sticker as soon as you can, and talk to townsfolks daily and we can get items at times~

[*] [Halloween event only] We can get candy from towfolks when we talk to them, so we can use them on the Reconstitooter which gives us slurry which gives us bait. The items we can fish out from fishing can help in our crops :D I upgraded the Reconstitooter and use higher quality bait~

There's more to uncover, I hope you will enjoy this game like I did!

[h3]下面是一些小问题：[/h3]
不过首先说一下关于之前的口口字问题，我的话只在刚到镇子的那几天见过，目前已经到了山顶地图，没有再见过口口字，也可能是因为官方修复了吧，担心汉化乱码问题的朋友们可以入，目前并没有影响阅读的乱码问题啦。
游戏内容有点点少，感觉不是很够，主线任务给我一种被推着走的感觉，完成一个马上继续下一个，一连串的任务，都能预见自己接下来要干啥了。而且支线任务很少，类型还很重复，就是找精灵或者提交材料。我也想做更多更有趣的支线任务呀！
缺钱，很缺钱，还缺材料，啥都缺的我决定不开店，所以也不太确定开店是不是很赚钱。缺的钱理论上可以从订单补，但是我同时又很缺材料，这也没那也没导致我满街要饭变卖家产（夸张说法）。缺钱还手残的我到了港前小镇那叫一个血压upup，又不想打明显是为了拖时间的电子游戏，又没钱靠买工程师的作弊服务拿第一，最后没办法了靠抽万圣节奖池抽出来的果子卖钱才终于开了港口的塔。还是遂了制作组的愿坑了我一些时间，这点是我比较不喜欢的。个人感觉主线的跑腿部分应该做到有趣和拖时间并存，但是这个游戏的跑腿部分在有趣上面还是差了一点点。但是没关系看在人物可爱音效可爱的份上，我还是可以原谅的！[spoiler]（我愿意众筹帮那个街机小子上学，能不能盖个学校我要看他去里面愁眉苦脸）[/spoiler] 

总的来说，瑕不掩瑜的一款休闲游戏，建议不要像我一样玩的太急，慢慢来也能体会到更多乐趣，还是可以买入的！",1697728182,1697728182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I really did. I like farming games like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley and i also really like creature collector games, so the concept of combining them was interesting and appealed to me in a fundamental level. But there are just too many things that kinda stopped me from enjoying it.

First let me start with the things i DID like. As i mentioned, i like the concept of combining the farming game with the creature collector and i think that, if done correctly, this would be an amazing concept. I liked the little community we have at Badgetown and all the little quirky things about the game. It has a charm about it that you just don't see in many games.

The concept of the dance battle was an interesting twist to the creature collector battle mechanic that throws away the somewhat troublesome idea of making animals fight each other, though i do have my problems with how it's done here that i'll talk about in a bit.

I also liked exploring the different locales and the excitement of what kinds of ooblets i could find there and what seeds they have. Nullwood in particular was really cool. I like the shear number of things there is to do as well, it was hard to run out of things to do.

Now for the things i didn't really care for or thought could have been better implemented.
First off, i mentioned the idea of the dance battle was cool, the problem though was how it was done. It felt really lackluster. There are no explanations on what anything actually does until you try it and find out. Hype for example has zero in game explanation, i just had to do it and see what it did and then hope that it was good. It was, but i prefer to be able to plan out my battles in turn based systems like this. You could say that after you figure it out then that's not an issue, and you'd be right, but the lack of clarity initially was a bit of a turnoff for me.

Additionally, the card deck. OH the card deck. NO WAY of modifying it? REALLY? Considering how much your strategy relies on pulling the right card at the right time, not being able to modify your deck was irksome at best and devastating at worst. The basic deck has so many cards and your ooblets have so few special moves to add to it that it almost didn't matter what ooblets you used and trying to make synergies between them was a nightmare because you couldn't pick when you would get that signature move you want over something useless to you in that moment. You also lose all your beats and cards you have in your hand if you don't use them all up. You should be able to save them and use them in subsequent turns. Doing so would add A LOT more strategy to the battles.

Another thing that got on my nerves, you find an ooblet you want to battle so that you can add it to your collection. It WANTS to battle you. But you can't just battle it, no. You have to give it some kind of VERY SPECIFIC thing as an offering first. Now you could argue that it makes you diversify and have to farm and make things you otherwise wouldn't in order to get that ooblet. That's a fair point and i would concede that isn't a bad thing. However, the fact that they want things that you have to get recipes for that you can't just get the recipe for and have to rely on RNG to get is stupid and very contrived and demoralizing. I found a cat ghost looking thing that i wanted VERY BADLY in Nullwood. But required a specific dish i had to cook to let me battle it. Ok, how do i get that recipe? I can only earn it as a reward from the dance barn, which i can only participate in once a day to get things. And the recipe was apparently super rare to pop up in there and i never saw it even come up once. Even if i could get it to come up in the dance barn, the dance barn was painfully RNG based on if you can win or not. Due to the nature of the nonadjustable deck and other factors involving the dance barn, i would often find myself losing in the dance barn due to completely unavoidable RNG bullcrap that i had no way of avoiding. Welp, i guess i can't get that one probably ever.

I mentioned that there was plenty of things to do, and this is true and great. However, all the things you do are incredibly shallow and skin deep. It's like playing in a very large kiddie pool that the water only goes up to your ankles. Lots of places to go and things to do but nothing deep or satisfying and it just feels like that trying to advance on anything is artificially locked behind a contrived in game paywall, like the things you have to offer for dance battles for example. Almost all of the main story quests revolve around glorified fetch quests. There was one part of the game where in order to progress, i had to bring some entitled idiot 10 freaking cups of expensive coffee. Could i have technically farmed the stuff i needed to make it myself? Conceivably, but at the time i had no way of getting the springbeans needed, i didn't have a recipe to grind them, and i didn't have the recipe to brew the coffee either, so i had to go and buy them all which was extremely expensive for me at that stage of the game and i could only buy 3 a day, which means it took me 4 in game days to do this idiotic quest.

The thing that killed the game for me entirely though was when i got to Port Forward. It was explained that in order to progress i had to beat some uppity moron's high scores on every single one of the arcade games in town. Minigames are cool and fun as an option, but not when they are mandatory. Forcing you to have to do ALL of them was so dumb that i just couldn't take it anymore. They are all super shallow reflex based games too, which i find incredibly annoying and do not enjoy playing in the slightest. So locking my progress behind gameplay that i find to be just irritating and infuriating at best is just going to make me quit playing the game.

If i had any input on how to improve this game, there are only a few things that would have to change.

1. Make the deck modifiable. This is the most important thing. Add in a card shop that you can buy different cards to change out your deck with and give the ooblets more special signature moves they can do that you can ALSO toggle on and off when you use them with your deck. Even without adding new card mechanics, this would be a huge upgrade, though more interesting card mechanics would be welcome as well.

2. Lower the requirements to be able to battle ooblets. I'm not saying that you should be able to battle them for free because the idea behind the concept is not lost on me. But maybe you have to make an offering that meets a certain amount of points and different things you can offer will give different amounts of points based on that ooblet's preferences. Like if you make it the certain dish that it likes then it'll fill up the offering points you need a great amount.

3. Have more things you can do to open up places besides fetch more planklets and nurneys! Maybe you have to have a certain ooblet to help build the place, or perhaps there is a group of ooblets in the place you have to battle out like at the very beginning of the game with Mayor Tinsel's office.

4. For the love of all you hold sacred, don't force me to have to beat the high score on all these stupid, shallow reflex based arcade games that are just knockoffs of mindless, idiotic mobile games! It's explained in the story that in order to have claim on the tower, that you have to have the high score on ALL of them. If you beat his high score on 1-2 of the games, wouldn't that void HIS claim on it? Or how about this, you have the option to do a side quest with the mayor of that town to have them declare that tower as public domain that no one person can have claim to and kick his stupid butt out of the tower? Add an additional reward for people who WANT to beat all the high scores.",1697649303,1697649303,False,115,1,0.751497805118560791,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Ooblets scratches a lot of itches at once. It's a little bit monster collector, a little bit farming sim, a little bit town life, but it's not too deep in any area. Although there are some ways the game could be fleshed out in perhaps a sequel or big content expansion (I'll get into a few ideas about this later), overall I think the balance is actually just right for me.

I have a lot of games that ask a lot of me and I also have some games which are relaxing but in some ways ask *too little* of me. It's tough to find a game that hits a sweet spot between too much and too little sometimes. Ooblets is, for me, in an ideal point where there's just enough to engage with to keep me motivated but not so much that I ever feel overwhelmed or like I just need to slog through a bunch of grinding etc.

The style and theme are unique and quirky in a way I overall liked. I'm not saying every joke lands or anything but such is the nature of comedy. Overall I liked the light-hearted interactions with townsfolk as a contrast from too many games which try to do Grand Storytelling when sometimes I just wanna buy a new jacket and didn't actually need to get a whole lore dump about how the shopkeeper was sad a lot as a kid.

At just over 40 hours I've completed the main storyline and I'm now I'm mostly winding down and collecting gleamy ooblets, perfecting my farm, etc. I'm not sure if I'll get a ton more out of the game but I wouldn't be surprised if I play for at least 10 more hours and that's a pretty good value overall.

There are a few areas I'd like to see fleshed out. Vacation spots are a little underwhelming. Having the Dance Barn as my only reliable source for battles with other trainers at the end of the game is a little disappointing it would be cool to maybe have Dance Barn type locations in other places like Nullwhere and Port Forward that maybe hold events less often but would give you another excuse to travel. Lastly, without major spoilers, the endgame feels like it could use some kind of epilogue focused on tearing out some unnecessary facilities and doing restoration perhaps.

None of these criticisms are major detractors though and the game still stands up as a fantastic experience. My best hope is for an Ooblets 2 where I can dance battle my friends as so many of my buddies are playing this game and we all talk team composition/strategy and how we we wish we could battle each other!",1697513631,1697513631,True,4,0,0.547339856624603271,0,True,False,False,True,,,

While this was all very well and puerile, it completely misrepresented the tone of the game for me so you can imagine the truck-heckload of disappointment I was in for.

As it turns out though, this game isn't so much about dealing with the fragile egos of a mass of entitled babbylords - I'm sad to say that instead, this is a wholesome game about having your own fragile ego repaired by caring for cute lil babby bois and doing some dank dances together, often inside a barn. It's all very enjoyable, relaxing stuff and the entire package is put together with so much love and character it's just outright disgusting. I can't believe those dang game developers got me again.

It has its own appeal to farm sim and creature collector fans, and I can see that it takes inspiration from a few other games. I was not aware of any community drama until after I got it so I don't care to comment on it tbh.

The progress is much slower than Stardew Valley. In fact, it's just slow in general. The main campaign tasks are tied to your level, so you can actually complete them at a lower level and then only have side quest options. However, I never felt like I had nothing to do since I would spend my downtime foraging, micro-managing my farm, fishing, crafting, cooking, and decorating/accessorizing. Hot take, but I feel like Ooblets does the farming part better than SV. It's easier to gain momentum when harvesting/planting, and the crops are actually useful for completing the main campaign. They are also much easier to profit from, as you can process them into food with ease or you can use the Plenny export shack to earn massive profits for set amounts of crops. 

The creature part is very unique! The dance battles are executed via deck battles like Slay the Spire. When you win, you get an Ooblet seed which then can grow into a new friend! Your Ooblets follow you around like in Heartgold/Soulsilver, but you can also leave a few at the farm to help you take care of your crops. One of the cons is that the game doesn't let you talk with your following Ooblets or let you feed them treats, which I would've liked to see. There is an incentive to collect many different types to allow for synergy with your chosen dance troupe; some Ooblet dance moves work best with others. The game does allow for adventuring to other areas to collect new crops and Ooblets. The game also lets you put accessories on all your Ooblets! :D

提一些更方便玩家的建议：
1.箱子增加一键添加现有物品。现在是要么全拿出来要么全放进去，当我箱子没满的时候，要一个个手动从背包才能添加进去。
2.每日的精灵只有起床时候显示那一次，内容很多很容易忘，最好做成可以随时查看的。
3.添加memo功能，有时候一天要做很多事情，忙了一件忘了下一件，然后白白多跑路。
4.精灵操作界面的逻辑要再优化和统一，从随从可以右键直接放回家里，但是反之不行，然后在家里的精灵不知道具体在哪个小屋，有时候需要做野地任务从小屋拿出来，就不知道要放回哪个小屋。
5.主线通关后，有些小东西应该能在商店购买的到，要钓鱼一个个钓概率很低，很麻烦。为了时长的话，做任务换也行。
6.卖货要手动一个个上货，很不方便，建议添加库存。或者添加托管给精灵，让精灵帮忙上货或售卖。

 TL;DR:  This game is quite charming and cute! It's very good pick if you don't expect much from it.
I personally however, was quite disappointed after just 6-7hours of gameplay. 
Despite it's initial charm, the game quickly reveals itself to be very dull and boring at it's core.
  Pick it up from sale if you really want to play it.


  The gameplay loop, especially at the beginning of the game, is very, VERY tiring. Nothing really happens to hook you in properly in my opinion.  This kind of games are supposed to feel a bit grindy at the beginning, yes, but this just doesn't do it for me. The goal of helping around town is not brought in as a main thing to do, but feels more like a side quest. Not important. 

The characters don't have... Well, character to them. They feel very cardboardy and I found myself not caring at all about them, despite playing several farming sim games before. This might factor in why I feel like the game does not have proper meat for me to get into.

   The nonsensical names of everything in this game, despite being cutesy, is in my opinion a bit of an hindrance. When every seed and creature you buy and collect has a name that does not make sense, you kind of get confused. What is this thing I'm supposed to grow for this quest? Where do I get it even? 
   Which brings me to the areas of the game... Which are really.. Really big let down. They all feel very samey, and there's little to no exploration to do.

Overall, everything in this game, despite being cute on the surface, turns very quickly to be dull and boring.

It took 6 hours for me to unlock the dancehall so i could use the battle feature without burning my resources i need to progress and hopefully not have to care about the shit resource loop. Combat also sucks ass, there not a lot of tactics just get the most points and a lot of the mechanics they added to add depth dont actually do anything and mostly just slow the game down by reducing how many points either side scores (some dudes make useless cards appear in your deck, reduce the value of points you can score or stun characters. but you can instead score 1/3rd the target point goal for the same cost???) , none of the mechanics seem to gel or make for an actual win con its just wait until you get enough point cards in your hand (the enemy is essentially incapable of winning).

While the core remains the operating and improvement of your farm the name and main draw of the game is the Ooblets themselves. You'll collect the many ooblets wandering about by beating them in a dance battle. This is done with a card based battle system, you draw cards from your dance deck and play them to get an effect. The ooblets in your crew add their unique moves to your deck and that about it. The battle system is honestly bare bones and bad, I get that the uncomplicated system is supposed to lead to a more relaxing game but the lack features just made things frustrating. Mostly this comes down to being unable to customise your dance deck, for example alot of ooblets can add status effects that can cripple you deck, stacking a debuff that prevents your score cards from scoring or stunning an ooblet. There are counter cards tied to certain ooblets but without the ability to short your deck of useless cards you can get stuck sitting on your hands waiting to draw the card you need, especially with larger battles and more ooblets. You could stack your crew with the same ooblet but then you draw alot of support cards that do nothing when you need score cards. The only saving grace is that battles are short and easy. The AI won't play its best cards or will play a buff after a move that would that buff thus wasting it. It is rare to actually lose a battle and given how hopeless the AI is those loses will be at the hand of bad luck more than anything else.

So the dance battles are a little plain, but what about the collecting of the ooblets themsleves? Well to start you'll need to join a ooblet club. Its the first choice you'll make and it doesn't really matter, you'll choose yourt starter ooblet and then nothing. The clubs have a function in that latter on they sell costumes for your ooblets as well as unique special card to add to your deck. But you have access to all clubs anyway, gaining no benefit from your membership. and the unique cards suffer from the non customizable deck thing, half the time you dont draw them when you need them and the other half they take up a slot in your hand and stop you from doing anything. But beyond that collecting the ooblets is pretty fun, you need to collect an item to offer them as a gift before battling them but theres a good range and as you unlock new ones which want rarer items there will be plenty of common ones around to collect while you find the stuff you need, especially as there are 3 variants (cosmetically) of each to collect add to your team. It all starts off well until you hit the cap. Theres a starting limit on how many oobs you can have and it gets tedious increasing that limit especially as you do it one ooblet at a time with resources that are constantly in demand for farm upgrades, quests and everything else.

And here comes the rest, the farming progress is painfully slow, you barely make enough selling you crops to buy more seeds, you need the crops to make the items to catch ooblets. You scan the ooblets for cash, but you've hit the limit and you need to build houses for them. Things will get better eventually but that start curve is painful it takes too long to get to the point where you can start easing the busy work with things like sprinklers and once that hurdle is over the game gives you a shop to run, which is also painfully slow and tedious until you get upgrades to have it tick along at the level it should of started at (enjoy watching 6 NPCs wander around for 3 mins without buying anything while you get to do nothing).

And to top it off the characters in town are as bland and basic as can be, Theres nothing here to hook you in getting you to care about the people in town, the only thing to seperate the main towns folk from the generic nobodies wandering about is the fact they have a little entry in the players guide book. I've finished tyhe game and I couldn't tell you their names, half of them you only talk to if you need their shop services, I had no reason to go into the barber or cafe for instance.

The sad fact is that if I had to sum up the game in one word it would be tedious. Its not a bad game but it doesn't offer much beyond the cute creatures to collect. I want to like the game and I did have some good times but not enough to recommend, if you're looking for something in the same ballpark try Moonstone island.",1697266703,1697266703,False,1,0,0.502538084983825684,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Many times where a task or quest was given that would be impossible to complete at that point of the game.
Some of the rewards of a task can not worth the amount of effort worth. For example upgrading your house only giving 20 wishes.

Some materials are extremely rng dependent to get. 

Enemy AI is terrible where they will waste your time making moves that do nothing.

Some ooblets are extremely hard to catch since they require very rare resources to trigger a battle and the ooblet itself has little value outside of completion.

Don't expect the same amount of content though.

For anyone unfamiliar, [i]Ooblets[/i]' main gameplay loop is essentially gathering & farming & doing your chores. Day in, day out, because your crops fuel all game systems. You need resources to get money, more seeds, get collectibles, get creatures, etc. You start out with nothing and slowly build up your Crop Empire. Each day you have a certain amount of energy to spend, which replenishes when you sleep. I ideally wouldn't have this bedtime thing at all, because that's the main feature that sends that anxiety spiking, but ah well.

So, where do the ooblets come in? They make your farming life easier, and they also are essential in unlocking 'the rest of the world' and the quests for the light-hearted story. You seem to collect them at a pace similar to [i]Pokémon[/i], so about a handful in a particular town- But you can unlock bonuses to add more creatures (besides other upgrades). You can also dress them up with accessories and pet them- And each ooblet has 3 colour variations with different rarities, if you're into that sort of thing.

The story is very light-hearted and generic, which pushes you to go on errands to unlock feature x, buy thing y at the store, or go to place z. You might come across an accidental psyops note or whatever, but I personally don't give a shit as I'm just A Farmer Tending To My Animals & Crops. 

There's a particular approach to humour, so for example the 'yes' or 'okay' button is written as 'dunnit'. You know, like, 'done it', but written 'quirkily'? A lot of characters talk like that, with the pipsqueak noises akin to [i]Animal Crossing[/i]. Sometimes it's funny, other times unnecessary, mostly I just skip right past it to be honest. I do wish there was an accessibility option for particular wording to be written 'normally'. Why do.. Wires? Have to be called 'nurny'? Why are wooden planks 'planklets'? It'd be way easier if common language like that was written as such.

Graphics and colours have a cozy feel to it, which I like in most cases. The only exception is anything to do with winter and mist, because in my experience, everything becomes one bright white blob of eyestrain. If there could be a setting to tweak brightness/contrast/turn off mist, that'd be appreciated. Currently, there's also weird flickering with the dance battle lights in Nullwhere, which makes doing anything there strenuous- Though I'm assuming that's a bug to be fixed in an upcoming patch, which is hopefully soon.

At the end of the day [i]Ooblets[/i] is a good game, I enjoy it! [i]Stardew Valley[/i] wasn't my cup of tea, but I like creature collecting, even if it gets kinda overwhelming with all the crops, tasks, shit to buy, dance battles etc. hours in (that's on me though). I don't know if the devs plan on adding future content, but if they do then I'll sure be interested to see it!",1697243847,1697244160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Rating: 8/10
(advice section as spoiler at the bottom)

Pros:
Its an extremely cute and simplified mix of a life sim and a turn based pet battle game. Nothing ever feels like its going to be an uphill struggle just to get to the next step. Pet battles are pretty easy to understand, and the dance barn provides an amazing place to regularly train up your new oobs! (WITH REWARDS!) 

For a relaxing adventure with some surprisingly dark side plots. While they require reading WAY between the lines. Almost dark souls level. The game has a very creepy undertone, and i love it. 


Cons:
The farm was.. okay? ""Underutilized"" if I had to pick a word. You can very easily beat this game without ever expanding your farm. (though late game does require a decent sum of nurnies and plankets, so if you dont plan on expanding, expect a decent slowdown. 
Lump sum supplies of wishes feel like they run out CRAZY fast. Really think about what you want to invest your wishies into before you go spending the fat stonks on the wishie well. 
MAIN story? immensely forgettable. I feel like this was not the main focus of the game whatsoever, but worth noting if that is something you are looking for. Because, I am too. hard to find life sims with genuinely good story lines. 
I never figured out how to make it snow in the game. If there is some sort of condition you have to meet before that weather event will happen. but It literally never snowed in my play through. And it did on my wife's twice. 


Advice for your run. 
[spoiler] 
In starting town:
had to remove a section for character limit. I felt like leaving town stuff a mystery is probably the best option. ;)


In your farm:
-While it didnt snow on me, it snowed on my wife.. for 5 days straight. And unless you have leveled up your oobcoops to heat, I highly suggest making sure you have at least 9 crop spots that are heated. This brings your game to a grinding hault making it almost impossible to make any real progress on anything. 
-I have never hit a max stack of plankets or nurnys. If you have energy at the end of the day. spent every last bit of it getting nurnies and plankets. You WILL need them. 
-PICK ONE. oobcoops or sprinklers. Ill try to break down the pros of each so you have an idea of what direction you want to go...
oopcoops: Maximum 8 crops within effective range. 3x3 with coop in middle. Fully upgraded they will maintain (break weeds, wood and stone), water, harvest, plant seeds, then heat. from level 1 to level 5 oobcoop in that order. They will not deposit harvested corps into anything they just wait on the ground for you to pick them up at your earliest conveneience. There is a lot to keep track of in the game, so I am unsure if I ever ran into any despawning issues with drops left on the farm. Additionally the growth speed will increase all the way to 60% increase at max level oobcoop. And you start with a spot to put one oob to work the coop and a new spot is opened each level meaning up to 5 oobs for each coop.
sprinklers: Maximum 24 crop within effective range. Starts as 3x3 but upgrades to 5x5 then a heater(never found a good use for this) then the heated sprinkler 3x3, then heated sprinkler 5x5. Getting to the headed level is faster and cheaper than the oobcoop. no crop speed increase, but if you need to grow more than 16 of a crop all at once, waiting for 8 to grow for the next 8 to be planted and then grow is slower than just planting them all under a sprinkler. and checking for weeds yourself first thing every morning. 

I still really want to try layering a oobcoop inside a sprinkler's range to see how it goes. 

each unlockable region that has its own variety of oob spawns. 
Region 1:
collect all the drops and floor loot here. Especially if you plan to go down the sprinkler route. 
Region 2:
the fllor loot here is used in a small handful or recipies, but mostly used for catching goopy long legs'. No need to stockpile more than ~20.
Region 3:
Port Forward... this place can be a nightmare hell hole to get stuck in if you are not decent at minigames. You have to beat the high score of every arcade on the pier and some of them are very much not easy. Nothing to really collect here other than the recipe for candy salad and the bundles of candy you need to craft that recipie once for each bundle. You need three bundles to get a legsy. Keep that in mind. try to visit port forward and get enough tickets to get at least 9 candy bundles+ the recipe.
region 4: Not a particularly hard location and found you really start to spend less and less time at the regions the more of them you unlock... but the roller skates are silly and jank and so much fun. I just REALLY wish they had a brake button.
The remaining regions felt very cookie cutter and there really only to progress the story and throw 1-2 more oobs in at each. 
An important note on the regions is that if any unique seeds are recipies are needed from an area, you can find the recipe and a seed seller there for what you need. In most cases. Otherwise the recipe may be in the wishie well.. speaking of...

Wishies:
-this is a complicated section but I feel like I can help simplify the most important thing here into one solid point. You WILL NOT get enough wishes (from badges) to buy everything. You WILL need to grind the dance hall and maybe even daily wishie tasks to get everything. 
-farm expansion feels wasteful for how much it costs. and how close to the end of the game you will be by the time you feel like you need it. 
-30% increase stamina should be bought the MOMENT you find it. 
-the information about the oobcoops and the sprinklers pertain here. You unlock the ability to get the next tier of each through the wishie well. If I played again I would take sprinklers to max first then get oobcoops to level 3 once I had everything else I wanted. 
-most recipies in here will be needed to catch some oobs

[b] Es una mezcla entre Animal crossing y Pokémon. [/b]

 Empezás en una isla desde cero, en donde te dan a elegir un animalito llamado ""Ooblet"", cada Ooblet tiene sus habilidades y al igual que Pokemon podés coleccionarlos y pelear con otros, pero en este caso para atraparlos tenes que desafiar a los animalitos a un baile en el cual aparecen unas cartas con las habilidades de estos (Los bailes se juegan por turnos), al ganar el baile cada Ooblet sube de experiencia y así es como obtiene nuevas habilidades, ademas de que el oponente te otorga su semilla para que al cultivarlo puedas tener esa especie a tu disposición.

 Hay misiones principales como también secretas o de evento y podes mejorar la relación con cada habitante, visualmente es muy adorable y no hay forma de que te estreses ni aunque pierdas un baile ya que no hay castigo, al perder simplemente no obtendrías la semilla del oponente.

 Personalmente creo que si te gusta la onda de Animal crossing, Pokémon o Slime rancher, tendrías que darle una oportunidad a Ooblets.

[h2] Actualización de reseña [/h2]
 También podés abrir tu propia tienda en donde se podrá negociar para que el producto que vendas sea mas valioso (si abrís la tienda tenes que quedarte ahí hasta que la cierres). Ademas hay una zona en donde hay 6 arcades y te dan unos boletos, al tener muchos puntos podés canjearlo por cosas variadas.
Aún me falta desbloquear más zonas, pero por el momento se nota que al juego lo hicieron con mucho amor, es super completo, yo creo que lo vale incluso sin descuento.

- I love how easy it is to edit and craft things. Even the farming is made easier.

Game is very bland. Graphic wise, it's very bland and everything shares almost if not all the same animations. 
Physics is very weird and off putting. Everything just clips together, like clothing, tools, ect.
Heck, even the chest slots is off, like someone just did a badly paste the slots into the less common (or 26 slots chest)
Ooblets are cute I guess, but that's it. there's not much variations to it.
While game is inspired by SoS(HM)/SDV/Pokemon, it barely touches the water or to into detail of what defines the genre.
I love farming games and grew up with SoS(HM)/RF/Pokemon/Sims. And it's safe to say that Ooblets has none of the features, or any features that make it stand out or unique on its own.
Farming is barebones, no seasons, no levels, same crops all the way. Also how farming grid is, it's also very clunky and not fun to farm.
Ooblets/Pokemon-- none, there's no stats and the only thing is the earning exp for level and maybe moves (cards) level up, and I guess you can dress them up a bit.
And Ooblets spawn per map is limited per day, they don't respawn until the next day.
There's no days or seasons, or seasonal events (not real life events). 
Dance battles is very repetitive and it's pretty much the same animations over and over. and the cards are RNG. They definitely should change the description of the game, as claiming you can ""train"" ooblets is a false advertisement.
One of the main thing that irks me, the crappy ""baby"" or terrible adventure time wannabe talk. And that's in the whole.game. there's not one remotely ""normal"" npc in game without the childish, overuse language.
There's a difference in making a unique NPC with their own unique slang/catchphrase vs making every npc sounds outlandishly and ridiculously childish. Also the game treats the player the same way, when you pick up new items/level up/rewards/ect. The naming of items are definitely babystyle also.
The game fails to blend in the sillyness, when they make the player have a set personality already. which also makes the set-player-response seemed like the player is the only sane one while the rest seems like they never graduated from kindergarten.
All the areas aside from Badgetown, are extremely lackluster and empty. If the area is lucky, the NPC gets houses (that you can't enter). There's no reason to return back to them unless you want to get ooblets or ooblet. No special NPC or townsfolk that you can build relationship with. It's hilarious how some npcs said the area is a town, such as nullwhere or pantsahill, when there's really nothing there. There's definitely no ""townies"" there as the plot claimed to be.
For the end plot, it's laughable how the game magically gets 100 votes when there's barely ANY living npcs.
Maps aren't fleshed out and not even half finish.
Townies NPC- no special feature or personality, they're very flat, no special events for friendship. You can college some bland stickers for friendship level I guess. 
Would not recommend.
If I wanted to collect 'pokemons' type, there's re;legends or sunhaven. As much as I have a love-hate feelings towards those two, they're a tons better than ooblets.

一款集合了种田、捡垃圾、装扮、收集及卡牌斗舞玩法的模拟游戏，休闲之余又有点肝。剧情上主要讲述了在“钱路岛”上生活的主角不堪被物质与金钱腐蚀，乘船来到了遍布欧布精灵的小镇。在镇长的帮助下到郊区的小木屋中定居下来，重新开始对梦想的追逐。游戏卡通渲染向的画风给人的观感十分舒服，欧布精灵音乐对战的场景也十分带感。游戏还有定期推出的主题活动，特别推荐给有便携游戏设备的玩家随时摸鱼。

[h1]没有什么能够阻挡，我对自由的向往[/h1]
要不怎么说电子游戏是对现实世界的慰藉呢？我们的主角为了追求心中的蓝莲花，孤身一人来到小镇。上到镇长下到居民都对其友善有加，给住所、分田地、让加入欧布俱乐部不说，还能承接大伙的委托获得各种奖励。你在现实世界试试？钱包君会牢牢阻挡你的梦想。

[h1]化繁为简[/h1]
对于肝系玩家来说比较友好的一个设定是人物除了体力值外并没有其它繁琐的数值，什么饥渴度、饱食度一概没有。不过相应的，做任何事情几乎都需要消耗体力值，哪怕你只是捡个垃圾。

但是游戏中的地图场景并不是很大，因此即便NPC只模糊的告诉你XX物品在小镇周边时，你也不会有啥迷茫的，大不了就把整个地图逛一圈就很快能发现标的物。而路上最多就是捡捡蘑菇、贝壳什么的，不过由于我们的主角无法跳跃，一些高度差的地形就需要来回跑路，倒也挺麻烦的。

本作在种田方面也十分简易，前期也就是多多注意浇水。不过作物的成长时间普遍还蛮长的，需要一定的耐心。不过那个自来水管的位置总感觉有那么一点违和，但是它都不算我水费，还要啥自行车呢。

[h1]欧布，对战！[/h1]
本作的宝可梦收集玩法罕见的采用了舞斗的形式，获胜后可以获得欧布精灵种子。但本质上也只是一个轻度的卡牌对战玩法，不过我确信它们的舞斗不会吵到你们的眼睛，也真的不是在打架。甚至整个场面动感十足，观看一群可爱生物跳韵律操也十分有意思。
所以最后我想说，为什么不能选择男性角色开局？毕竟决战紫禁之巅的可是男一男二啊~

This games pretty nice and chill. There's farming, and critter collecting in the form of these ooblets. There's a good variety of both, though some of the ooblets look a little silly to me. There's crafting, and cooking, but neither are overly challenging. There story of the game doesn't take itself to seriously, and is manly a bunch of fetch quests. The style of this game is where it hits a major cord with me, and others games, like this one, should take a few notes. The clothes and furniture are so cute how they are styled, but there i will say, I WISH THERE WAS MORE, the catalog is pretty slim and could use some more color swatches of what they already have plus some more pieces. What they have is wonderful, and i love it, just sucks when you have a color of something your looking for, only to find it doesn't exist...... 
something i did not enjoy was a part of the game where is has you play mini games to get through it. This was only in one area and is not how the rest of the game functions. Anyways The mini games.... i hate them...i'm sorry i don't play a game, just to have to stop what i'm doing to play a shit version of flappy bird, and there are many games of that type along with it, but please if i want to play that sort of stuff, ill go download an arcade game....., Luckily the game has a bit of a buy around, so you don't have to play the games, but i saw they are using it as a selling point, like get outta here, they are not ""fun"". Sorry just thinks its silly. 
 anyways thanks for reading

This is the third time I've bought it actually! AND it's the best version I've played so far. The first release was great but the launcher gave me problems. The switch port was great but the loading times were soooo bad. But this one? This one is fast, loads quick, and I've yet to have a crash. Most stable version I've played so far tbh.

As for the reason I bought it three separate times? Well. There's so much variety in how you can customize your team, your clothes, your farm, and your house. And you can accessorize your ooblets! There's so many little things I can do every in-game day, which is a good length and never feels punishing. Does it take a bit to get the ball rolling on progress? Of course! But that's actually a good thing, as it lets you really feel out your place in this world.

The dance battles are the right level of challenging, and you can save by quitting to the main menu before one if you really want to retry. The mechanics developing over time and the various ooblets of the different regions having wildly different movesets really makes you have to strategize how best to face them, reworking what doesn't work and keeping what does. It's so easy to learn the more nuanced techniques, and once you get a good team going it's a real treat.

The game is solid and has its charm, but don't buy it looking for the next Stardew Valley.

The main character here is the world, which is charmingly oddball. The characters, on the other hand, are pretty basic. Yes, they have different personalities, but there's very little depth, just one-liners, and the friendship mechanic is pretty bare-bones (no progression, no personality changes, no reacting to the things you do, no romance mechanic).

The main activity here is collecting and battling ooblets. Farming is a thing you do so you can make recipes to unlock new ooblets; it works well, but it's a background system. Combat is easy - I won about 98% of my battles, and very few of them were tactically challenging. I never felt the need to switch Ooblets outside of my core 6 or so to beat opponents.

There is a story, and you can complete it and 100% the achievements in around 25 hours. There are no badges/achievements for collecting all the ooblets, so if that's what you're after, it'll take longer than 25 hours.",1696967878,1696967878,True,13,0,0.680940330028533936,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's missing some features here and there that I'd personally like, dancing is not a good substitute for battling or combat as it simply isn't challenging - ever - and requires no consideration. Just play the cards and win.


On the non-dancing side of things I've found myself blasting through dialogue as fast as possible because nobody has anything interesting to say to me and nobody requires anything either. Every quest is a very simple collectathon, and leveling up relationship with other people is just a matter of speaking to them. Unfortunately, the characters all speak in a sort of pseudo-baby-speech that makes actually reading their dialogue cute at first and then infuriating later. 

On the whole I think it's cute and cozy, I like the simple satisfaction of collecting the ooblets and dancing to procure more of them, but the lack of complexity in this game leaves me wanting for so much more. In the end I'll probably tire of it and return to Stardew, and I'm sure other farming / life sim enjoyers have similar gripes about the total lack of emotional investment in this sickly-sweet world that is never playing itself straight with you.",1696966111,1696966111,True,3,0,0.444887101650238037,0,True,False,False,True,,,

As others have noted, there may be some balancing issues with the game, but that may also be a matter of play style and taste, so I'll leave those out (I'll say that I am frustrated that it feels like my progress is halted by my inability to do what the game wants me to do and I just don't know what it wants me to do).

The biggest issues I have with the game have to do with controls and menus. I play with keyboard and mouse, and the game is very inconsistent on when it allows you to use the keyboard and when you have no choice but to click a button with your mouse instead. There are also a lot of simple but annoying UX issues with the menus. For example if you've clicked on an ooblet, you can't click on another ooblet without going through deselecting the current ooblet. Sometimes just tapping space will get you out of menus, but sometimes you have to reach for escape. I've tried rebinding esc to control, but every time I restart the game it will forget my rebinding. You can't rebind keys to mouse buttons. Disabled buttons in menus are sometimes selected by default, so you have to manually switch to a non-disabled button to leave a menu. Other times you actually can not leave a menu using escape, but instead have to do something else to get out. I could go on.

This, combined with the balancing issues and flat out bugs, like getting out of bounds just by walking through a door (which was fun to be honest, but still a bug), at first made me think ""ah, that's fine, these are just launch issues, I'm sure they'll be ironed out"".

But of course I had forgotten that this game has been out for a year already as an Epic Games exclusive.

While I didn't know and don't care about the drama, the fact that the game has been out for a year does make me less hopeful that the gameplay will improve much from the current state.

全成就没有大难度，只不过整体有一点点肝，注意这里的“一点点”是相对老宝玩家和老星露谷玩家。
------------------------------------------
【【【最常见新手问题】】】
-10级以前，小镇里的垃圾应捡尽捡。
-制作东西的制造机在家具屋的左手边。
-走失的精灵喜欢躲在矮的灌木丛中。
-绿色的螺旋贝壳100块。
-扩大房屋没有实际作用，只是用来满足收藏癖。
-万圣节特别节日，那个扭扭糖和菜谱只需要买一次，虽然每天买完了第二天还会继续上架。
-万圣节特别活动没有全成就的必要物品，所以抽奖不用上火，开心就好。
（持续更新，欢迎补充）

如果你刚开始这个游戏并且想在尽量短期内达到全成就/结局，可以参考如下要点：
1)【尽量使用手柄】
    ：可以显著缓解手部疲劳，密密麻麻要点来点去的地方还是挺多的
2）【种地为本，攒植物原料】
    ：前期有几个需要钱的地方，但尽量不要动地里的植物，先卖贝壳。植物在解锁烹饪道具之后，可以一本万利制作很多的高附加的食物，把这些食物卖给小镇东边的咖啡厅，一本万利。
3）【主线任务】
   ：，最重要是热气球，最不重要是野地。热气球是贯穿整个游戏向外拓展的重要交通方式，越早开通越早攒材料解锁成就。野地最大的作用是获取辣角，辣角在当你有了烹饪机之后可以制作贵贵地食物用来攒钱，或者是用来升级精灵小屋用来保暖，运作上性价比不高。
4）【支线任务】
    ：开谷仓跳舞为最优先。谷仓可以跳舞，而跳舞又是每天稳定获得80星星币的方式。通过喷泉解锁各类场景和道具很重要。
5）【喷泉的特殊物品】
   ：精灵小屋为最优先，接下来是最高级的鱼饵桶。没什么可说的，精灵小屋这种解放双手的好东西任何优秀的农民都值得拥有。而且精灵小屋不管是制造还是升级，要的都是一些通过攒就能攒出来的材料。相比之下什么洒水器啊加热洒水器啊，需要的材料有点可遇而不可求。而可以用1：100的比例制作最高级鱼饵的鱼饵桶，在后期可以迅速通过钓鱼补充木材等材料。
6）【快速攒鱼饵】
   ：废罐子这种鱼饵资源1：1朴素的，只配用来做镇长的任务。（10月底）还是万圣节任务期间，每天可以讨到的糖果放到鱼饵机里是30：1，目前是我认为转化性价比最高的了，其他的要么就是制作其他物品的必要原料，要么就是本身就能卖很多软糖币划不来。如果你看到这条tips的时候已经过了万圣节期间，可以动用一下电脑设置的时空扭转魔法（
   *这样的做法目前是不会被惩罚的，在10月30日最新的精灵车补丁说明中，官方默认知晓了玩家这样的做法。
7）【大量获取木材等原料】
   ：前期通过及时清理农场，如果体力足够，记得杂草也可以尽量除掉因为这样可以腾出空间。中期基本上都是和人社交后不知不觉会获得大概10个，或者去谷仓跳舞获得大捆材料。后期就要靠用最高级鱼饵来钓鱼了，每次钓上来15个。大后期的话去喷泉扩大农场规模，更广阔的农场也会有更多石头和木材。
8）【闪光的石头获取来源】
   ：一是跳舞比赛大概每周里会有一个，注意看谷仓的日程表会提前告知当天冠军的获取内容；二是最快最多的就是解锁了热气球之后，每天去本地的沙滩上找找有没有漂流瓶，收到漂流瓶之后通过热气球去地图上带红叉的小岛，去一次可以收集3个左右闪光的石头。三是抓来闪光精灵的身上会掉落在农场。

The premise is really cute and there is a LOT of ooblets to collect which I imagine can take ages. Howlongtobeat.com puts the Main Story of the game at 28 hours  with a 79 hours completionist time - a very decent amount of gameplay.

I think the best thing about the game right now for me is the seasonal events, as of writing this there is a Halloween event which makes the whole game feel so incredibly cozy, and you can turn off seasonal events if that isn't your thing!

Overall this game is like Animal Crossing and Pokemon had a very.. very strange child that is cozy and fun to play. I can't say why I keep coming back to this game, there is tons to do from collecting ooblets, to farming, running your own store, doing the halloween event.. etc.. it is endless and I keep telling myself 'oh I will just do x' and before finding myself playing hours later!

TLDR; It's silly, fun, calming and easy. Slow to start and doesn't have deep mechanics you need to worry about mastering (from what I've experienced so far). OST is a banger. Managing Ooblets is pretty annoying, especially as a collector, you run out of space fast, and swapping them between your team, your farm and the Wildlands is cumbersome.

Positives:

I would consider farming games and card games an over saturated market in recent years for the indie scene. For me, a mixture of the great use of what feels like the entire color spectrum, silly and simplistic Ooblet designs, and NPCs that feel outright unnatural (which I am considering a good thing) while being sassy or quirky make this game stand out. 

I really enjoy that the NPCs are asshats along with their dry humor; everyone wears their personality on their sleeve, actively making fun of you or other NPCs or simply being the weirdest/quirkiest they can be. I would note that I usually hate quirkiness, as I don't find it very charming or cute, but the dry humor of the game offsets it that I still enjoy my time with that aspect. 

Possibly most importantly, the tracks in the game are absolute jams. I love getting into dance battles just to be able to hear all the songs often as I can, and I most certainly listen to the OST out and about. The dance battles themselves are fine! I don't really find myself having to think very hard about it; they're easy and simple, I usually just go into them using whatever ooblets are low level to get them leveled up. I've lost a couple dances, but nothing major.

Negatives: 

What has frustrated me most so far is managing Ooblets.

If I have a full 8 Ooblets following me you can always send one of your Ooblets home. What's obnoxious is that you can't simply call an Ooblet to your team from the menu. You have to physically find the one you want while it's wandering on your farm, among the rocks, branches, weeds, coops, stations and crops which can be very difficult based on their size, shapes or colors. 

It simply doesn't make sense to me that I can tell my Ooblet to head back to the farm from the menu, and they know exactly where to go, but I can't call the Ooblet back to me from the menu, ESPECIALLY if I am already on the farm.

Transferring Ooblets between the Wildlands, farm and team is also pretty tedious and from what I've seen, you cannot get rid of an ooblet permanently in any way, so the list that gets sent to the Wildlands grows very long when you don't have space on the farm or simply don't want some, which makes organizing a horrible hastle.

So in all, my only issue is with tedious design choices with managing Ooblets.",1696884234,1696905226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Néanmoins, s'agissant du premier jeu de ce studio, je pars du principe qu'il faut lui accorder beaucoup de bienveillance, chaque jeu vidéo voyant le jour étant déjà un miracle en soit.

Ooblets est véritablement rafraîchissant, son ton et son humour ne plairont pas à tout le monde. Son gameplay est plein de bonnes idées qui laissent, il faut bien le dire, un sentiment d'inachevé. Il y a tant d'excellentes petites phases ici et là, mais qui sont à mon sens soit  coulées par un rythme très lent, soit par un manque de finition.

Le farming est un aspect qui est basique et bien fait, et le fait de faire pousser ses futurs compagnons est original. Néanmoins, la gestion de ces derniers et notre quête pour tous les collectionner est tiré par le bas par quelques aspects : Le fait qu'il faille donner tel ou tel item pour challenger les bestioles vous poussent au début à les attraper tous, car les Ooblets du début demandent des ressouces faciles à avoir, et puis ensuite, quand on a un noyau solide dans son équipe, on se dit que c'est quand même beaucoup d'efforts pour une bestiole qui restera bosser à la ferme : autant en rattraper des basiques.

L'expérience gagnée en combat ne ""semble"" pas satisfaisante, car une fois les pas de danse supplémentaires débloqués, on s'attend à d'autres qui, à partir d'un certain niveau, n'arrivent pas. Aurait-il fallu donner un niveau max assez bas aux Ooblets pour faire comprendre aux joueurs que ""ça y est, vous pouvez passer à autre chose, vous avez tout débloqué pour celui-ci"" ? Cela s'applique par ailleurs à votre personnage : Le début du jeu vous noie sous les quêtes; mais passé un certain seuil, vous gagnez des niveaux sans aucune forme de récompense, un tout petit équilibrage aurait été bienvenue, un tout petit peu moins de générosité au début.

Enfin, pour rajouter une impression de lenteur artificielle, il nous faut faire des siestes au lieu d'aller dormir comme dans n'importe quel jeu de farming du monde. Quand on doit farmer certaines ressources qui prennent X jours pour apparaître, il devient redondant de faire X siestes pour pouvoir se faire accorder le privilège de passer au jour suivant. Notez que si vous avez trop d'énergie, le jeu ne vous laissera pas fermer l’œil, vous pourrez donc passer cinq minutes à retourner la terre devant votre demeure afin de confortablement pouvoir vous écrouler au lit. Aussi patiente que je puisse l'être en matière de jeux vidéo cosy, j'ai du me faire violence à certains moments.

Ceci dit, il paraît important de le souligner encore une fois : C'est le premier jeu d'un studio prometteur, qui j'ose espérer nous donnera une raison de s'enthousiasmer dans le futur avec une autre production tout aussi adorable ♥",1696873569,1696873569,True,5,0,0.602649033069610596,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Me - hasn't played any version or know anything really about Ooblets prior to the steam release had a tough time choosing between two cozy games and mainly because of the reviews. The other game Mineko's Night Market had a lot of reviews where people have played hours and hours of it already. Where I found for the Ooblets reviews that they are mostly from people who have already played it on the switch and they haven't racked up those steam hours.

I took into account the pricing... how Ooblets is 40% off right now and that counts for something right? buy it now so i don't have to buy it at full price later. Wow!! This game is super jam packed and i do not regret buying it. Very easy on the eyes unlike other games. I love that you aren't forced to keep cows and sheep and then tend to them for materials whilst doing everything else. The gathering xp based on how much you do during the day is great; makes me look forward to how many points i can accumulate the next day to see if i can level up.

Overall great game!! Sure others have complained about hip phrases or spelling but that's part of the charm. the Dance battles being implemented in place of trainer battles make the game so much fun and less worrying (maybe it's just me that gets antsy about losing when it's Pokemon battles)

玩了两天写点测评。现在入手价格挺合适的，要么就等更便宜再入手。首先是汉化问题真的很大，其次目前的内容真有点坐牢。

战斗系统：动感解压。每次都会跟着音乐一起颠，但是难度或者说趣味性很难指望。其实每个精灵流派倒挺明晰，但是很难有发挥空间。跳舞比赛[spoiler] 那几个模式真就每日机械任务。能理解在制作模式多样化，但【免费特供】【只限特技】什么的就是无脑按没别的了。 [/spoiler]

地图&资源：屁大点小镇，每天只能在街道上转来转去，也没什么互动细节，很快就乏味了。今天开了两个新地点，还以为能干嘛呢，结果只能称之为资源点而已，，都没有探索，到地了比赛三次就没了，好无聊。
i探索的会对这个游戏失望。
地图小也就算了，想吐槽的是资源极其有限。每天转来转去只能采点蘑菇，有用的还刷得少。此外还是第一次遇见农场模拟这么缺木头的。别游都是因为肝不够或者肝过头了缺木头，这游戏里，建设小镇极需木资源吧，但木资源唯一来源是农场荒地部分刷新，，每天施舍一点，，整个小镇全指着我来了手锤断木真的很荒谬。小镇建设倒不急，现在做到[spoiler] 自己开店的剧情，竟然要150个木头修理店面啊啊啊来你镇子就没见过这么多木头，每次手里有点就得给出去了 [/spoiler]
这镇子没用的衣服家具咖啡理发店倒是齐全，怎么没有日常资源店啊，大家都不活现实是吧，只等玩家来了勤勤恳恳搞基建。
玩的过程中体感除了木头还有很多这种卡随机资源的，还有去新地点的时候，问你要那面包，如果手头没有还得回镇子买，很无聊的耗法。

生活系统：把钓鱼做得也好无聊，，，或许不能叫钓鱼。在镇子上捡十个罐子垃圾得到一个鱼饵，钓鱼点是固定的，在码头，因为人物不能跳跃，得绕过围栏才能到，能爬过去绝不绕路人有难了。如果是买完速度加成后也还能接受。到钓鱼点之后选择鱼饵，接着就没你事了，人自己会钓。所以不叫钓鱼，只是捡十个垃圾罐随机换个东西而已。哦这个垃圾罐[spoiler] 本来钓鱼没意思就不想管它的，结果现在我要开店，店门口就是一个垃圾罐每日刷新点，很碍眼！不知道后面是不是有彻除的剧情 [/spoiler]
衣服家具啥的比较丑，没有收藏欲，还没法整理。npc也没意思，没有互动剧情，只有给人打杂和机械的对话框。

熬夜惩罚机制是有意思的！[spoiler] 通宵＝错过【睡觉时间】，体力用完了就只能【打盹】了。打盹回复体力少，还会跳跃时间，所以通宵的第二天是浑浑噩噩就过去了，很有代入感hhhhh 熬大夜第二天睡起来会有说你睡过头了的提示、且体力条不会回满[/spoiler]

虽然吐槽很多但是毕竟玩这个游戏是图轻松的，当cozy grove玩可，当波西亚玩不可，是这样的推荐。",1696775047,1696948386,True,24,0,0.714101970195770264,0,True,False,False,True,,,

🌿 Ooblets, se ha convertido en uno de mis juegos favoritos porque es un juego que me reconfortó en uno de los momentos más difíciles de mi vida. Lo he jugado para Switch y luego por Epic y ahora finalmente por Steam, pero si tuviese qué resumir este gran juego en una palabra sería precisamente esa: RECONFORTANTE. 

🌿 Si te gustan los juegos de farming con mecánicas novedosas Ooblets, es sin duda alguna para ti.

🌿 Considera que este juego se centra en nuestros adorables amigos, sus batallas de baile y en el farming. Se incluye la pesca como una mecánica muy básica, pero en general no se echa de menos nada que puedan tener otros juegos de su género porque lo compensa con otras cosas, como que nuestros Ooblets nos ayuden en el farming, explorar, cocinar, etc.

This is going to completely disregard the entire EGS fiasco.

Ooblets is a casual farm-sim, creature collector, deck building game. The game-play cycle revolves around you challenging ooblets to dance battles, which are basically simplified versions of typical card-battle games like hearthstone. Winning a battle nets you a seed that you can take to your farm to grow a new Ooblet. That's the core game play. 

I think the largest issue the game faces is how unbelievably slow the beginning of the game is. You're going to find yourself spending all of your money on seeds for your farm, and making back just enough to buy more seeds and maybe something else, if you're lucky. Everything you grow has some sort of in-game use, which typically is to feed to an ooblet to challenge them to a dance battle. You NEED the resources you grow in order to get more Ooblets or open new things in town, but, these plants are also supposed to be one of your main sources of income, either from the mission board or just selling them directly. It is a slog to get everything in Badgetown open, or expanding to new areas. The sense of progression is minimal, and it makes the game feel a lot more like busy work rather than a fun game. 

This game takes heavy inspiration from other life-sims like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. It doesn't try to hide that fact. it borrows many of its core elements from those games. However, those elements are watered down from their source material. There's a day/night system, but there isn't a season system or any sort of change in day-to-day life. You grow the same crops all the time, with the same ooblets, and any events are tied to the real-world calendar rather than an in-game one. Instead, the change in the daily-life comes through a level-up system, where new crops and ooblets appear as you gain XP. Leveling up is a slow process, meaning you're stuck with the same old same old for extended periods of time. It causes the game to feel very stagnate, rather than a living changing world like other life-sims. 

Characters. The characters in ooblets are completely unremarkable. Remember-able and unique NPCs are one of the foundational elements of a life-sim, and the characters in Ooblets are all too similar. There's a lack in dialogue variation, so many of the NPCs talk in the same way, and don't have much remarkable about their personalities. Even when doing introductions, I found myself unable to remember who it was I had just talked to. Many of these NPCs sort of just wander aimlessly around all day, lacking any sort of schedule aside from those who are also shopkeepers. With Badgetown also being very small, you'll wind up seeing them walking in circles or stuck on the geometry somewhere. The Ooblets themselves are the same. The player character is also a bit strange, as the character creator is barebones. Your character also has a voice, with the game already having quite a lot of dialogue for the player character, often breaking the immersion of you being a resident of this town. 

The game's art style is... okay. The biggest hindrance to it is that it's sort of generic. Everything looks so similar to one another, especially in regards to locations. I found myself trying to find a specific building in Badgetown, and going in 2-3 wrong ones every time. Ooblets themselves also look very same-y. There's not much interesting happening with the vast majority of them aside from trying to look cute and marketable. They all have the exact same animations that look like they were pulled from the unity store. Many of them are just an animal or a plant with silly eyes. The NPCs also have this issue with sharing too many animations. That and the game's programming often doesn't account for the outfits, environment, or anything the characters can hold, so these animations clip right through. The style of animation doesn't match the art style, really emphasizing  the ""store-bought"" feeling behind charcater movements. Especially when dance battles happen, which is what you're going to see the most of.

The elephant in the room is the game's writing. I mean the literal writing in the game. It tries so hard to be weird and quirky that it comes off as forced. None of the characters speak in a natural way, instead, talking like 2012 tumblr posts. The slang and abrupt attempts at humor just feel so commercial. There's no thought behind it. No attempt to craft an interesting world or even a fun story. it's just bland. I don't know how an indie studio managed to make all of their dialogue feel like a corporate attempt at being quirky. It makes me feel cynical, but it's just not cute or charming. The excessive use of vowels and baby-talk feels like they're trying to replicate Adventure Time slang but didn't understand how to. Others may feel differently, but seeing ""Ok cool."" at the top of the screen any time i pick up something new just makes me feel upset.

I bought this game having fairly low expectations and have been pleasantly surprised. It's fun and it's strange. 

However, Ooblets has no replay value. Events are tied to real time instead of an in-game calendar which completely ruins the immersion because things like snow just happen randomly. There is a main quest line and by the time I finished it I had 100% achievements, a practically unbeatable team of Ooblets, all of the farm/house upgrades, all of the recipes and items from the stores and wishing well that are worth having, and more money than I would ever need. There are multiple areas you unlock during the quest line but all of them have way less to do than the main town and very little reason to visit them once you've completed the main quest there. 

I'm glad I bought Ooblets at a 40% discount because I don't think it's worth full price since the heavy hitters of the farm/life sim genre have far more to offer and some of the best are cheaper.

This is a very cute game, a little bit twee but I can forgive that. I can safely say I enjoy this game

The problem: this game is poorly balanced and all over the place. 

the actual game play is focused mostly on farming mechanics and gathering resources. I don't find myself using the ooblets a whole lot because my focus is mostly on trying to gather resources without running out of money. It is hard to retain a safe amount of money because often times essential materials like seeds are overly pricey and its hard for me to keep up with prices. 

Maybe I am just bad at this game,  but I feel like it needs a stronger focus and better re-balancing. 

Overall I think this game has a lot of potential if some of the core issues were to be fixed.

The struggle for resources early on was a true pain and my love for the game has dwindled a bit.  It's still a mostly pleasant experience, but not as endearing as it was at first.  The creature collection aspect is the most fun, but, again, collecting the resources to challenge the creatures can be frustrating.  The dance battles are the most disappointing part for me, as there is no real ""deck building"" to this game.  You are given random cards based on the level/species of your Ooblets.  I've yet to have a challenging battle.  Hopefully that will change the further I progress.  Thus far, frankly, every thing but resource gathering has been too easy (I've unlocked the third location), with friendship progressing so routinely, battles always being won, and no challenge to quests other than the grinding of farming for resources to use and sell.   

Original review after one hour:  I don't usually review after such a short time, but I am absolutely in love with this charming game.

People thinking about buying this shouldn't get dragged into the controversy. I've read through the entire thing, done my research, and everyone acted badly. I am not going to blame an indie dev for taking money to help make their product in order to be able to see their dream realised. I am not going to blame a dev who is self-aware that he acted badly and admitted they could have done better.

I do blame a horrible, toxic fanbase who brigaded someone three years ago for entitlement, and went so far as to fabricate fake evidence against the dev just to drum up more hate, and I do blame the same people for not being levelheaded about certain situations and cherrypicking things to attack others with due to personal grievances.

In my personal opinion, it was a bad situation all over and there are no heroes here, but the dev was the only one of the two parties who has moved on and has learned from it.

Игру я ждал довольно долго (снова в Азкабане), но оно того стоило. Спустя год всратой эксклюзивности в Эпик ГеЙм сторе, эта наркоманская игра наконец то добралась до Steam-БОГОВ, и теперь мы можем сами пощупать ее во всех неприличных местах. Что ж, сразу скажу, ИГРА  ШИКАРНАЯ ! Я думал это будет очередная унылая ферма с пародией на ""покемонов"" в виде зверушек ""облетов"", но я оказался не прав и очень этому рад. 

Плюсы и минусы игры

Плюсы:

Графон: 
Графика и модельки по качеству незамысловатые, дизайн простенький и с упором на минимализм, но при этом все детали на своих местах, все очень аккуратненько и опрятно, за что сразу можно похвалить разрабов. Обычно когда др. разрабы делают игры с  таким графоном, они не сильно заморачиваются и модельки часто выходят угловатые, с косяками и в целом всратенькие. В Ooblets такого нет. Тут все сделано на совесть и с душой, все опрятно и качественно. Модельки хорошо проработаны, дизайны персонажей и окружения яркие и запоминающиеся.

Музыка:
Веселая и озорная, хоть и без особых изысков, но очень подходит по настроению к тому наркоманскому бардаку, который зачастую происходит на экране. По духу музыка чем то напоминает ОСТы из игр вроде human fall flat и Don't Starve. Где надо она ритмичная, где надо озорная и задорная, а иногда и чутка грустная. Композиции очень хорошо подстроены под настроение и геймплей игры. Каких то выдающихся треков для себя не нашел, так что отдельно слушать их наверно не буду. 

Геймплей: 
Сама Ooblets представляет собой казуальную ролевую игру, с поиском существ и элементами симулятора фермы. В игре можно коллекционировать «облетов» (аналог покемонов), находя и приручая их или выращивая прямо у себя на ""огороде"", а затем их можно содержать у себя на ферме. Все облеты разные и очень милые, они отличаются как по характеру, так и по внешности. Хотите мухомор на ножках ? Пожалуйста ! Всегда мечтали приручить говорящую антропоморфную рыбу в шляпе ? Что ж, сегодня ваш день ! И такого добра там целый вагон и маленькая тележка. Питомцев можно украшать, одевать в разные костюмы и прокачивать. 
По мере прохождения вы так же будете качать своего персонажа, покупать ему\ей шмотки, купите себе жилье и ферму получше, где сможете растить еще более крутых облетов.  Жилье и внутреннее убранство так же подлежат прокачке и улучшениям. 
Самое интересное в игре это дуэли и челенджи с участием ваших питомцев, когда вы со своей сворой ""покемонов"" можете надрать зад другому ""тренеру покемонов"" или уделать его в танцевальной битве.
В игре очень много разных активностей и всегда есть чем себя занять.

Сюжет:
В целом, сюжет стандартный для игр такого типа. Вы прибываете на остров (очередной остров в очередном симуляторе жизни), там знакомитесь с первым встречным, тот начинает вам рассказывать свою супер интересную историю жизни и то как он увлекательно умеет выращивать какие-нибудь кабачки на своем огороде. Ну короче вы поняли. Прибыв на остров, вы знакомитесь с разными необычными жителями, те дают вам всякие поручения и за их выполнения вы получаете денежки и опыт. Постепенно обживаетесь на острове и начинаете копать в его историю и тайны. 
Сюжет тут в целом больше для галочки, но тем не менее присутствует и он неплох. 
Самое необычное это наверно сами обитатели острова, которые скорее выделяются внешностью, а не своими детально проработанными кул-стори. В конце концов, в какой еще игре говорящая тыква вам расскажет о своих будничных делах как о чем то  обыденном ? 
Игра очень яркая и наполнена сюром, сразу видно что разработчики пытались сделать так, чтобы в игре вам никогда не было скучно.

Минусы:
Цена: без скидки игра вам обойдется примерно в 1500 руб. С учетом скидки я купил за 1000 примерно. В целом игра заслуживает своих денег, но если вы из тех кто считает что инди должны быть дешевыми, цена вас наверно огорчит. 

Вывод: 
Игра очень яркая и веселая, она  до упора наполнена сюром и постоянно чем то удивляет. Разработчики постарались на славу, в игре всегда есть чем себя занять и вы никогда не устанете смотреть на милашек облетов с их нелепыми, но в тоже время забавными нарядами.

So of coarse being the gremlin that i am for silly little goobers i bought the game for a second time. It has silly and creative characters, great humor, a story i have yet to peice together, and silly and cute little creatures that likes to dance :)
If i would estimate my game time on the epic launcher, it would be around 100 hours, total on multiple saves.
With this? even more. 

So TLDR if you like
-farming
-a nicely paced game
-silly and cute creatures
-turn based card ""battle"" (dancing)
-seasonal events (cosmetics n fun stuff)
-a very pleasant art style
-fun npcs
Then you will also 500% enjoy the game as much as i do!

Dailyo!!
Ooblets is a fun, cute, silly game that is charming and a real joy to play. I love this game with my whole being and I still regularly play often!
It is one of the few indie titles that joins two of my favorite genres: monster taming and farm sims.

It has all the wonderful qualities of a farm sim: farming, friendships, customization, home customization, cooking and some crafting.
Ooblets has put a fun twist on battling. Instead of the usual battles we're used to in monster tamers, our Ooblet critters enjoy Dance Battles in the form of turn-based card battles and aren't afraid to show off their slick moves. This makes battling a bit less competitive, more casual and fun which I think proves a wonderful introduction to folks who haven't played monster tamers before. (And also means the battles tracks are so DAMN good)
The dialogues between your townsfolk are silly and funny; it makes engaging with them feel rewarding and so much fun that I think cozy gamers will really appreciate. The story is also a fun ride and Ooblets holiday events are seriously the best events I've ever experienced in a cozy game.

I have so much to say, but there is so much packed into Ooblets that I would rather not share so that new players can experience this game blind and truly enjoy what this game offers!
The Devs put SO MUCH love into this game and I am so happy to see how Ooblets is doing today.
Thank you so much to the Devs for making Ooblets happen and continuously giving us more content. I'll happily follow and support you in any future project(s) you pursu!.

I've often looked for my ""holy grail"" casual game - ie. a game I can pick up when I only have time to play for an hour and still feel satisfied, a game that I can put down for 3 months and come back to later without feeling lost and unsure of what I had been doing, a game that is relaxing and lets me set my own goals. Ooblets, more than any other cozy game I've played, is exactly that for me.

While there is a day-night cycle, I don't feel the same time pressure in Ooblets to complete [i]everything[/i] in one day that I do when playing Stardew Valley and I'm not trying to constantly min-max my profits; I generally have goals in mind (make money, collect all the furniture and clothes, maybe someday fill out the almanac with every ooblet) but within each game day, I do whatever I feel like doing! This makes it very low stress to put the game down for a while - I know when I pick it up again, all I have to do is toodle around and I'll start vibing with the game again.

Ooblets has a [i]lot[/i] of (well-designed) systems and little mini-games that integrate well together. Farming is in service of making currency, but is also necessary for catching a good amount of ooblets, and for cooking food that boosts your energy or used as gifts for the villager friends. Catching ooblets fills out your collection, provides you with helpers for your farm, and adds some strategy to your card selection for dance battles. Making printed models of ooblets might sound like a little throw-away mechanic, but maybe you want to fill out the museum displays in the town hall, or sell them in your player shop when they're in demand for extra cash. Sea dangling (aka fishing) is probably the mechanic I've engaged least in, but it provides useful resources and items to sell in your player shop. There's also mini-games, like a slider puzzle mini-game and actual arcade games, that are fun diversions. All of these various systems and the collection-oriented nature of Ooblets means that even when only playing for a short time, there's plenty of satisfaction in moving goals forward.

In thinking about what makes Ooblets engaging for me, I also have to highlight the wonderful character writing. While the villagers you can make friends with don't exactly [i]change[/i] their nature over time, they'll reveal more of their thoughts, emotions, and backstory the higher friendship you get. Even better, the [b]quantity[/b] of dialogue is so much greater than Stardew Valley, much less Animal Crossing - I've maxed out a character's friendships stickers and started worrying I'd start getting the same daily dialogue, but instead one day they casually dropped a piece of backstory I hadn't heard before and made me go ""ohhhh"" about their character. I can't emphasize how much hearing new dialogue lines from characters even so many hours into the game sets Ooblets apart from other games where chatting with villagers becomes a chore because of the repetitive dialogue.

My biggest (and basically only?) critique of the game is that there's roughly 3 music tracks that play in Badgetown and they get super repetitive, super quick. I'd love some kind of ""town audio"" vs ""battle music audio"" slider so that I could mute the town music but still enjoy the dance battle music (but also being on PC I'll probably just go mute the Badgetown audio tracks in Audacity so I can still enjoy the other areas' music).",1696522946,1696522946,True,166,5,0.878755748271942139,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Already, this game looks really great on PC. It controls pretty smoothly, though I might still connect a controller, because I really like how it controls on Switch. So far, I haven't experienced any stutters, and I've noticed a ton of new accessories and decorations, so I'm super excited to find them all.

The best thing about this game is how much fun it is to just relax and vibe with its silly little world. The music is awesome, the characters are adorable, and the language--while it might take some time to get used to--is hilarious. It always brings a smile to my face, and its on the top of my list of favorite games, right next to Stardew. 

The gameplay isn't complicated, but it stays fun as things get more hectic. Some dance battles can be challenging, but its not like 4D chess or anything.
