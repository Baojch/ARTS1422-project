My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

сливки 20% – 300 мл;
соль, сахар, перец, сушенный чеснок, паприка – для посыпки мяса;
зелень, сыр – для подачи;
куркума, соль, перец, сушеный чеснок – по вкусу;
растительное масло – для жарки.
Способ приготовления:

Отварить макароны (пасту) в подсоленной воде до готовности.

Куриное филе разрезать вдоль, чтобы получилось два стейка. Приправить мясо специями, немного растительного масла втереть в филе. Оставить на 10 минут, чтобы оно напиталось специями.

На растительном масле обжарить мясо с обеих сторон до золотистости, затем отставить. Чтобы мясо было более сочным, можно завернуть его в фольгу.

В том же масле, где жарилось филе, обжарить лук, добавить чеснок, томатную пасту. Через три минуты добавить специи, немного воды, в которой варились макароны, сливки. Все хорошо протушить и соединить с макаронами, с которых предварительно слита вода.

Перед подачей можно посыпать мелко рубленной зеленью и тертым сыром.

A very difficult decision for “Blackguards”. The story and the fights are actually quite well implemented. But the details and the surroundings are somehow not consistent. For example, due to the random factor, the fights are sometimes quite difficult and can only be mastered at the second attempt. But what is the reward for victory? There's hardly enough gold to buy even a healing potion and the items you conquer are almost always the same junk. And what to do with the experience? Now with 50 to 500 points, increase one of the more than 50 skills, spells or talents by one point in order to..., yes, to achieve what at all? Ah, a new armor with 2 out of 10 properties better and only one worse than before... is it actually really good now?

In summary, the game hardly rewards the inclined player and instead confronts him with a confusing number system, the actual benefits of which remain largely inaccessible to today's spoiled player.

Blackguards is a tactical role playing game with an emphasis on turn-based combat. You build a team of up to five different protagonists. As player, you can take on different classes, such as warriors, magicians and hunters.

Your path leads through the Horas Empire to the Aventurian southern metropolis of Mengbilla, into the jungles inhabited by forest people and to the ruins of an ancient lizard civilization.

The game offers a lovingly designed map on which you can move freely. There are towns and villages where you can accept quests, buy equipment or heal yourselves. You will enter dungeons, fight in the wilderness and discover mystical islands.

Blackguards received positive feedback when it was released in 2014. I actually bought Blackguards in 2014, but my start was difficult, so I only played the game briefly. One or two years later I tried again and stopped again. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood. I don't remember.

The start of the game is a hurdle. You escape from prison with a group of three, with weak weapons, and almost naked. You have to take time to carefully upgrade the right characteristics and talents. You need to get used to the turn based battles. After each battle, you gain adventure points that you can use to upgrade skills, collect gold, weapons and armor. Buy additional equipment, clothes, armor, poison, bandages and health potions in shops.

The role playing aspect is a lot of fun. The battles are excellently designed, and the story is great too. Voice acting is superb, in German and English.

The third time I started the game was this year in 2023. Nine years after release! Silly me.
This time I was fascinated by the game. I managed to win the initial battles, carefully defined my group by deciding how to shape each character. A ranger with a bow, a dwarf with two axes, a native with a spear, a noble magician and womanizer, and a witch.

Often, battles are not easy, but I enjoyed the challenge. You can spread skills any way you like, but it's important not to do that. Make sure you upgrade each character in one, or later two, directions. That's the key to success. Create experts in their field.

I read that there are 180 battles in the game. Some of them took me 60 to 90 minutes, just for a single fight, including retries. My play-through took me 85 hours.

Blackguards is a great game that I would not have wanted to miss. I am really glad I played this game. After surviving the first hours, I was hooked. A wonderful game, even if the graphics are outdated. The game still looks very nice, especially the sepia colors are beautiful.

Please note that a couple of achievements are broken.

Also note that the game often starts with a black screen. You only hear the music. In order to fix this, you have to press CTRL+ALT+DEL and then ESC. After that, the game runs fine. No technical difficulties whatsoever during the game. But when you finished the game, about 50% of the time the game freezes. Use the task manager to log out of windows. I assume the game is not fully compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Pros
- excellent design of battle maps

本來是不抱什麼期待的

但是玩了之後覺得內容還不錯....也沒其它評論說的難度很高

已玩2周目以上...不推薦走第2輪...也不推薦解成就



新手在此建議:


2.難度建議玩普通...面對多個敵人...可以找格子較少的地方來防守

3.千萬不要重新再練一隻 (點數無法重置)

4.解析度要開1600  戰鬥詳細才會完整

5.使用能力.道具  要先對目標右鍵  (新手時常會搞錯)

6.戰鬥結束  最右邊-取出所有 (其他不會自動賣出)

7.火可以把木製品燒掉 也可以燒掉樹林草地

8.使用盾牌  格擋能力會大幅提升(擋弓箭.有隱藏加成)

9.如有有點天賦  鼠標停在敵人身上  能看到移動力  不過通常都是4格

10.爆擊是200%的傷害

11.空白鍵  保留動作

12.隊伍總力量_33    能夠帶66重量

13.任務 : 油畫要去塔樓
   任務 : 烏鴉 在競技場

14.任務 : 有[對話...]圖標的角色 通常會有劇情
   任務 : 多諾薩斯   4章  獵龍行動2

15.狂亂藥劑  使用後還是能操作該角色

16.裝備中的弓箭  有時不算重量 (感覺是bug)


●創建角色：推薦自定義法師 (獵人同時是 法師和戰士)

配點最佳等級帶為  3 7 11 14 16等  (所有的能力最高是18 主要用來啟動能力)

法術需求_SP 啟動=40  8=300  13=535  18=835(1710)



●關於天賦

身體控制  (蠻強的)
冥想  (比較不會重傷  也很強)
洞察  行動力+2  遠距離傷害增加+1+1(這招很神)
陷阱  前中期很強(對法師效果較差)
城市  (最後一戰是在城市)
生存  敏捷+1 智慧+1 (法師可考慮)
動物  (前中期用)
戰術  (前中期用) 4級 可以換武器不損失回合
療傷  這是可以當物理補師 (法術太耗魔了...不過後期較沒用)



●關於能力

警戒     (敵人發動的借機攻擊會變比較沒用
槌擊     (時常有無法命中的問題...需要嗑藥或強化)
營救打擊 (能打3隻 命中更高 也不錯
致命一擊 (長矛專用
雙持精通 (傷害低 只能算是強化的普攻 高命中吧) (不過你能拿2手 能回復星能的武器)
近戰武器大師  (超強 傷+2 攻+1 防+1)(法師 傷害只會+1)
三連擊   (弓真的很強   超強的)
箭雨風暴 (對大怪很強)
刀鋒舞者 (主動+4)
戰鬥直覺  +2主動性
戰鬥反應 (+4主動性)
閃避3    +2閃
星能再生1 =回1
星能再生2 =回2
星能精通  =施放低級魔法很有效
擊劍類 武器 沒近戰武器大師 加成


●關於法術

施展法術是依照:3屬性+技能等級+天賦檢測編輯器+2 (法術等級到13 或有 穩定施法  就沒啥差別了)

最好先點出你要的法術  找導師很麻煩

傷害法術_主要是高命中_傷害並不會很高 (BOSS 基本不會有負面狀態)

閃電迅移(有些法術3等比4等更好用 比如這個 這是我認為這遊戲最強的法術)
火球術  (滿級範圍好大  偏離中間傷害會減半9變成4)
烈焰    (4等是只能攻擊三個目標 比較差)
雷霆    (4等 潛力)
狂暴    (主要是對敵人用  技能是隨機  蠻強的控場)
暗影之力(在 ""魔法盾""內  施放  會bug)
閃電球  (4等是 下回合 生出一個精靈 覺得沒有特別強)
閃電球  (2等  能打一直線的敵人  打到2隻就賺了
暗影之力(無法使用魔法)
堅定不移(3等 可配合槌擊)
鷹眼神射(簡直是箭無虛發)
暴風雪  (4等 可配合槌擊)
元素之怒(檢定  後期...)
女巫膽汁(意志檢定 覺得後期...)
麻痺術  (3等 覺得還蠻強的)
療傷    (1等效能最高...這遊戲很常使用的技能算是必備)
法盾    (3等多1格範圍 很容易被打破)
解毒    (可以被一堆藥劑替代)

Desenvolvido pela Daedalic Entertainment e lançado em 2014, o jogo tem como objetivo combinar uma narrativa envolvente com combate tático desafiador.

A trama de Blackguards gira em torno de um protagonista personalizável que se encontra envolto em uma trama de intriga, conspiração e magia negra. A história é contada através de diálogos e escolhas morais, adicionando camadas à narrativa. Embora a premissa seja intrigante, a execução da história pode ser inconsistente, e alguns personagens podem parecer pouco desenvolvidos.

O aspecto tático do jogo é uma de suas maiores forças. O combate baseado em turnos exige estratégia cuidadosa, pois os jogadores devem posicionar seus personagens de forma eficaz no campo de batalha, considerando terreno, cobertura e habilidades específicas. A variedade de classes e habilidades oferece opções táticas interessantes, incentivando a experimentação.

Os visuais de Blackguards são razoáveis, mas não se destacam. Os ambientes e personagens são representados em um estilo mais sombrio, condizente com o tom geral do jogo. No entanto, algumas texturas e animações podem parecer um pouco datadas em comparação com títulos mais recentes.

Uma desvantagem notável é a curva de aprendizado íngreme, especialmente para jogadores menos familiarizados com jogos de estratégia tática. A interface do usuário também pode parecer um tanto complexa inicialmente.

Em resumo, Blackguards oferece uma experiência sólida para os fãs de RPG táticos que apreciam desafios estratégicos.

Plan ahead and specialize, this is not a game where you can spread your ability points all over and come out fine. As a Mage, pick out a few spells you want to focus on and get them up to a decent level (usually 8) before branching out. As a Warrior, pick no more than 1 or at most 2 weapon styles to start with and get real good at them.
Making the main character a spellcaster allows for more flexibility in your group than a Warrior as having more Mages means they can initially specialize on different spells. Later on it'll allow for more castings of the most useful spells. Archers are another solid choice as their Triple Shot is an extrely potent source of damage.
In the Weapon Talents screen you can adjust your characters' melee weapon focus between Parry and Attack. Mages don't usually need the latter, so going full Parry gives them a small survivability boost. Warriors will probably want to do the opposite and go full Attack as landing hits is of critical importance to them.
Have multiple damage types ready, don't fight skeletons with piercing weapons. Keep an eye out for Infantry Damage weapons in particular as few enemies have resistance to it, often making them stronger than they might seem.
Remember to restock potions and other items on your item belts before battles. Larger belts which allow for carrying more items into combat should be your top priority when buying things, followed by the potions themselves.
While most fights happen one at a time, watch out for chains of multiple battles which don't let you rest inbetween them. If it looks like a battle might lead to another, leave one weak enemy alive and spend a little time healing and regenerating your Mages' mana before ending the current fight.
Most characters can only go for one parry attempt (which increases their odds of avoiding a physical hit) per combat turn. Before trying to land a powerful but hard-to-hit physical ability on such an opponent, it can be worth trying to bait out the parry by attacking them with a weaker character first.
You can always purposefully cast lower ranks of spells, which is particularly useful for mana conservation purposes when finishing off low HP enemies.
Remember to update your hotbars with higher rank spells as you learn them. Most spells change functionality on Rank 4, so you'll probably end up with Rank 3 and Rank 4 copies of the same spell on your bars later in the game.
The starting Mage companion Zurbaran starts with Fortifex Arcane Wall on level 2, which allows him to create impassable force fields on the battlefield. Don't underestimate its usefulness! The ability to block enemies from moving through tiles of your choosing can often be far more valuable than any damage spell.
By far the best sources of damage in the mid- to late game are Hammer Blow (for heavy weapons users) and Triple Shot (for archers). Throw your offensive buffs on characters with either of these abilities and watch them wreck the opposition.
Don't bother buying spell books from stores, they cost astronomical amounts of gold and the same spells can often be learned from trainers.
At certain points the game will give you flashback missions where you will only have access to the skills and equipment you get from character creation screen. In some of these you will need to fight skeletons, so starting the game with a source of bashing or fire damage can save you some frustration later.

Talents

Willpower and Body Control are very important on frontliners, but they shouldn't be completely neglected by your backliners either. Body Control in particular can save you a lot of frustration from chain knockdowns which often come from sources your frontliners can't prevent.
You should get Perception to maximum rank on one character somewhere during Chapter 3 as it will then reveal every hidden trap and object on the entire map when used in combat. Just don't forget to actually use it, and make sure to add it to your hotbar.
Warcraft is another priority skill to max out on your Warriors. Most enemies in the game are humanoids and Rank 4 allows for weapons switching without skipping your turn, giving you much more flexibility. Animal Lore is less important but not by any means useless.
Streetwise and Survival are worth learning for everyone ASAP for the +1 Speed they provide, but actually leveling them isn't that important. Traps and Treat Wounds are not especially critical.

Spell Recommendations

Balm of Healing - The most reliable method of healing in the game, get it for all your spellcasters. Remember that healing a character whose HP has hit 0 brings them back to battle. Rank 2 will serve you fine 95% of the time, but sometimes Rank 3 can be useful for wound removal.
Clarum Purum - While only useful occasionally, it's very cheap to level and being stuck with high-level poison can be a pain. Just make sure you don't get poisoned again right afterwards. Don't bother getting it on more than one character.
Ecliptifactus Shadow Force - While not necessarily worth it for its ""intended"" use, having this spell at Rank 2 allows you to cheese a few levels as the shadow you summon can for example interact with levers and pressure pads. Be creative!
Fastness of Body - Solid survivability boost, particularly in the early game. Offensive buffs become more important as the game progresses, but since the early game is the hardest part it's worth getting to at least Rank 2 early on.
Hawkeye Marksmanship - Definitely worth picking up on someone if your player character is an archer, this + Triple Shot will make short work of practically anything. Otherwise your points are better spent elsewhere as the sole other archer you'll get can cast it themselves.
Ignifaxius Burst of Flame - Solid and reliable damage which bypasses magic resistance. Rank 4 has the same range as the other ranks but can hit up to 3 characters at a time. A few enemies are fire resistant, so you can also grab Thunderbolt for someone as backup if you like.
Karnifilo Frenzy - Probably the strongest spell in the game and every caster should get it to Rank 4 sooner or later. Makes any enemy attack the nearest character, and works on damn near everything. Use it on spellcasters and other enemies in the backlines and watch them kill each other for you.
Magica Infracta - Maybe not as useful as you might expect from a dispel as it also removes your own buffs and debuffs, but having it on one character can be worth it in a few battles.
Move as the Lightning - Rank 3 is the strongest buff in the game, doubling a character's actions per turn and giving them a hefty speed boost on top. Get this on at least two casters and cast it on your Warriors to practically double their effectiveness. Rank 4 is skippable.
Standfast Catlike - Increases your characters' chance to hit in melee, which is absolutely critical for reliably landing powerful but hard-to-hit melee skills like Hammer Blow. The dodge bonus is just gravy.

I wish that Blackguards' character progression system wasn't such a mess, because if it worked, I'd be delighted to recommend the entire low-fantasy role-playing package without hesitation. But character development is such an important and defining part of any RPG that this cluttered and confusing system has a big impact on what is otherwise an excellent tactical game with well-designed battlefields.
Except for its muddled progression system, tactical RPG Blackguards gets a lot of things right.",1699871441,1699871441,True,7,0,0.62779158353805542,0,False,False,False,True,,,

И хотя (на данный момент) готовы только две главы, местами встречаются досадные баги, уже сейчас, даже если ничего больше не добавится и не выйдет игра сверкает как бриллиант.
Когда то давно, в 1993 году, два тогдашних гранда игровой индустрии, Dynamix и Sierra Online, выпустили не побоюсь этого слова, шедевр - Betrayal at Krondor. С тех пор выходило много РПГ, но все же лично меня, ничто так не брало за душу как BaK. Да, были замечательные Baldur's Gate, NeverWinter Nights и Icewind Dale, были великолепные Dragon Age и Ведьмак (последний правда выбивается из списка типом боя). Все эти игры (и многие другие) были сделаны на отлично, и все же я тосковал по BaK.
И вот, впервые за эти годы мне попалась игра, которая чем то напомнила мне BaK (не в точности, а скорее духом). Что же можно отметить в Blackguards и что почти сразу бросается в глаза (перечисляю в случайном порядке):
1. Музыка - просто отлично, создает определенную, я бы сказал, мрачноватую, атмосферу.
2. Диалоги (только не ставьте русский язык, перевод пока что убог до безобразия), интонациии. Сделаны на 5, зачастую даже зная что герои скажут (при повторном просмотре) все равно слушаешь - так хорошо сделано.
3. Сюжет - интересный, но пока нет всей игры полное мнение составить сложно. Отдельно стоит сказать про боковые (побочные) квесты. Почти все мне понравились разнообразием, и хотя в конце каждый такой квест может сводиться к банальному бою, но сделано и срежиссировано это так органично, что и не замечаешь, что по сути это те же поди принеси и поди убей.
4. Система боя. Очень хороша. Заставляет шевелить извилинами, иногда даже весьма и весьма. На форуме после выхода первой главы были крики - дескать очень сложно, разработчики - порежьте сложность! Но справедливости ради стоит отметить, что это как раз один из главных плюсов игры. Потому что, чтобы победить в очередном бою, надо не просто кликать мышкой, а еще и хорошенько подумать перед боем (если вам не повезло и вас таки убили и пришлось загружать сейв) и решить как тактически победить данного врага(ов).
5. Экипировка, расход бутылок, стрел, ограничение на перенос тяжестей и на ношение магами железа добавляют сложностей, а точнее специфики к системе боя, заставляя игрока и тут включать мозги.
6. Атмосфера. Все вышеперечисленное создает замечательную атмосферу игры. Бывают игры, где все вроде бы сделано на очень высоком уровне, а вот атмосферы либо вообще нет, либо с ней туго. В Blackguards она не просто есть, она великолепна.

Не написал ничего про графику, так как сказать что она очень хороша я не могу, но лично мне она кажется сделанной на вполне достаточном уровне.

Могу порекомендовать игру всем кто любит РПГ, кто любит думать, кому нравятся интересные сюжеты и атмосферные игры, и конечно тем кому нравятся пошаговые бои.",1699214390,1699214390,True,1,0,0.517133951187133789,0,True,False,False,True,,,

First of all, the good things. There is a lot of story and lore behind this game, which is actually intriguing and it was one of the things that made me want to try and finish this game, just to see how it all connects. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't something new that will ripple the waters of storytelling, but instead it's a plot that has been used many times in the past and it works. Considering that I didn't even make it to Lysander gives you a rough idea how early, possibly, I quit.

The second thing that I enjoyed is the talents/skills/spells etc. Especially the part where you have to find a teacher to learn new talents for your characters. This made me take mental notes of different teachers in order to find them again when I have the AP (Adventure Points, you collect them after fights and they are your way to ""level up"" your character) to learn a new talent for a specific character. Also I liked that you had to be fairly considerate as to how you want to spend your APs (Increase an attribute / Increase a Weapon Skill / Increasing the level of a spell etc.) which could eventually lead into trying different builds for your characters if you wanted to replay the game. 

That about sums up the good parts of the game for myself so let's dive into the negatives.

So, first things first, the most frustrating thing is the ultra mega titan slow combat. I don't know if my PC had an issue with processing the moves of the enemies, but considering that your party almost always has at least 4 people, if you encounter a group of enemies with 4-5 mobs or more, just grab yourself a snack cause you can't make the combat go faster. Apart from that, the thing that made me quit is a fight with a 2 star creature called Iribar Lily ( 2 stars is like an epic monster with the 1 star being a rare, I think, don't quote me on that). In this fight the Lily is in the water and if you approach it it spawns tentacles that poison your characters and on the other hand on the land part of the map there is a wooden troll that is immune to damage. The thing that tilted me off is that after 3 rounds of fighting this Lily and dropping its' health bar to 1/5 it suddenly becomes immune... or to be precise, your characters can't hit it. The spells or the arrows aren't even registered in the battle log. I don't know if this a bug, I searched in the steam forums for any solutions and people just said be prepared it's a damn long fight. I don't know if I should wait a couple of rounds because we changed phases or something but we indeed went into a second phase LET THE PLAYER KNOW! Also in this game, you don't have a couple of rounds to spare. I restarted this fight 7 to 8 times, the RNG was still against me and I was already tired of this game from the previous segment of it, in which my party had to fight 9 battles, with 3 battles between rests, so I just had enough and uninstalled it. 

To finalize, this game isn't worth 10$ imo ( I got this game from a steam bundle ). Yes the story is the good, yes there is a thought behind the stats of your characters but that is pretty much it. The combat could be better, the items could be much better but yeah it gets kinda boring and tiring after a while. If you played this game and you enjoyed, by all means I'm glad! I saw that there is also a blackguards 2, I might check it out later, in the hopes that they fixed certain things and it's a better game in general.",1699030505,1699030505,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Blackguards is a tactical role playing game with an emphasis on turn-based combat. You build a team of up to five different protagonists. As player, you can take on different classes, such as warriors, magicians and hunters. 

Your path leads through the Horas Empire to the Aventurian southern metropolis of Mengbilla, into the jungles inhabited by forest people and to the ruins of an ancient lizard civilization.

The game offers a lovingly designed map on which you can move freely. There are towns and villages where you can accept quests, buy equipment or heal yourselves. You will enter dungeons, fight in the wilderness and discover mystical islands.

Blackguards received positive feedback when it was released in 2014. I actually bought Blackguards in 2014, but my start was difficult, so I only played the game briefly. One or two years later I tried again and stopped again. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood. I don't remember.

The start of the game is a hurdle. You escape from prison with a group of three, with weak weapons, and almost naked. You have to take time to carefully upgrade the right characteristics and talents. You need to get used to the turn based battles. After each battle, you gain adventure points that you can use to upgrade skills, collect gold, weapons and armor. Buy additional equipment, clothes, armor, poison, bandages and health potions in shops. 

The role playing aspect is a lot of fun. The battles are excellently designed, and the story is great too. Voice acting is superb, in German and English.

The third time I started the game was this year in 2023. Nine years after release! Silly me.
This time I was fascinated by the game. I managed to win the initial battles, carefully defined my group by deciding how to shape each character. A ranger with a bow, a dwarf with two axes, a native with a spear, a noble magician and womanizer, and a witch.

Often, battles are not easy, but I enjoyed the challenge. You can spread skills any way you like, but it's important not to do that. Make sure you upgrade each character in one, or later two, directions. That's the key to success. Create experts in their field.

I read that there are 180 battles in the game. Some of them took me 60 to 90 minutes, just for a single fight, including retries. My play-through took me 85 hours.

Blackguards is a great game that I would not have wanted to miss. I am really glad I played this game. After surviving the first hours, I was hooked. A wonderful game, even if the graphics are outdated. The game still looks very nice, especially the sepia colors are beautiful.

Please note that a couple of achievements are broken.

Also note that the game often starts with a black screen. You only hear the music. In order to fix this, you have to press CTRL+ALT+DEL and then ESC. After that, the game runs fine. No technical difficulties whatsoever during the game. But when you finished the game, about 50% of the time the game freezes. Use the task manager to log out of windows. I assume the game is not fully compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11.

I am 44.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am now am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube.
So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.
This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.
This game reminded me that my gambling addict friend said if I post a review on Blackguards and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.",1693188473,1693188473,True,1,1,0.355390012264251709,0,False,False,False,True,,,

I wonder if the game would actually benefit from completely removing ""RPG"" character development aspects and becoming essentially a puzzle game with pre-made set of characters with which you need to ""solve"" given scenarios. It's 90% there already...

Another gripe of mine (and countless other players') is the blatant unfairness of every battle. Ranged enemies somehow have longer range than you in many situations and there are usually several waves of reinforcements right when you feel like the tide would turn in your favor.

I think many players DO like their games a bit on the difficult side, but I still maintain that even if balance would be improved, the overall fun factor would still not increase due to the puzzle-like nature of many battles. You feel like your character builds simply don't matter.

Blackguards zabiera nas do dzikiego południa Aventuri, gdzie musimy odkryć swoją przeszłość i jakie wydarzenia stały za utratą przez nas pamięci, oraz, dlaczego pierwotnie zło powróciło...
Stając na czele drużyny, którą zbieramy w trakcje gry, przemierzamy dość sporą mapę na której zlokalizowano kilka miast.

Fabuła po tym jak z dwójką towarzyszy uciekamy z wiezienia, za rzekome zabicie księżniczki naszym celem jest oczyszczenie się z zarzutów oraz odnalezienie jednej osoby, która może wiedzieć coś na temat naszej przeszłości.
Podczas podróżny, dochodzą nas słuchy, że pradawne zło, Bezimienny Bóg został przebudzony i chce zniszczyć świat.                (Bezi z Gothic przejął moce trójcy i się wnerwił  :D )

Graficznie gra przypomina mi pierwszego Fable Zaginione Opowieści czyli grafika jest znośna.

System rozgrywki w Blackguards jest turowy- czyli nasze postacie albo przeciwnika zadają najpierw obrażenia, wykonują ruch, potem druga strona.
Mechanika podobna do gier Kings Bounty.
Dużym plusem gry, jest różnorodność pól walki oraz zastawionych na nich pułapek.
Niektóre lokacje czy pola walki są naprawdę ciekawie zrobione. Nie zawsze by wygrać, trzeba walczyć.
W karcie rozwoju, mamy praktycznie wszystko od razu dostępne, w co możemy inwestować, poza specjalnymi umiejętnościami, których nauczymy się u nauczycieli danej specjalności czyli gladiator walki, mag czarów itd.

Poziom trudności w Blackguards z tego co słyszałem i czytałem, niektórym osobom nie przypadł do gustu z tego powodu że jest z byt trudno. 
Ja nie jestem jakimś tam ProGamerem czy coś i BG ukończyłem na trybie trudności zmiennym, czyt. jak było trzeba, to sobie przełączyłem na łatwy, a jak nie na średni.
Właśnie co do samej trudności walk, to byłem pod koniec trochę zaskoczony, dlatego że, więcej 'krwi' napsuł mi Gadzi Prorok niż ostatni Boss, którego pociągnąłem z zatrutego bełtu z kuszy.
Moja drużyna opierała się na 2 tankach, magu bitewnym z tarczą i toporem(moja postać) i łuczniku czarodzieju, oraz łuczniczce, a z biegiem fabuły kolejnym magu, którego wyszkoliłem w łuki.
Taka drużyna, spokojnie radziła sobie z większością przeciwników bez dużych strat.
Gra jest tak ustawiona, że wystarczy by jedna z naszych postaci(obojętnie która) przeżyła, a my wygramy owe starcie. Także, mówienie że BG jest trudne to trochę przesada.
Punktu doświadczenia za walkę czy za zadania, też wpadają dość dobrze i trzeba tylko pomyśleć na co je wydać, a nie bezmyślnie pakować w rożne skille.
Najlepiej ustawić sobie jedną postać do danej ścieżki rozwoju i się tego pilnować.
BG nie jest grą trudną ale trzeba mieć chęć by się jej nauczyć.

PLUSY+
+Turówka (bardzo lubię gry tego typu)
+Graficznie może być.
+Fabuła nie wciąga z mocą tornada, ale jest ok.
+Fajne zadania i sporo.
+Całkiem spora mapa.
+Szybki zapis, jest naprawdę szybki.
+Zróżnicowanie postaci.
+Różnorodność przeciwników
+Zróżnicowanie pole walki.
+Niektóre czary dają niezłego kopa.
+

MINUSY-
-Dziennik z opisem zadań, mógłby być bardziej dokładny.
-Trochę nie z balansowany tryb trudności walk. (czyt. ostatnie starcia)
-Nie można leczyć się poza walką eliksirami czy odzyskiwać manę. Można się przespać albo iść do uzdrowiciela.
-Nie można przyspieszać walki (jak np. atakuje, lub przemieszcza się przeciwnik) a jeśli walczymy z dużą liczbą wolnych przecinków, to się można nudzić.
-Trochę mało broni bo tylko ze 3 sztuki danej czyli topory miecze itd. znajdziemy 2 standardowe i jeden specjalny.
-Praktycznie brak różnorodności pancerzy, może się zdarzyć tak, że do końca gry biegamy w ubraniach czy płytóce z 2-3 aktu gry.

Osobiście grę polecam, bo naprawdę bawiłem się dobrze i prawie wcale nie miałem momentów, że gdzieś się w walce zawiesiłem.

Polecam 7,5/10.

Прокачка героев - потрясающа и интересна, я в диком восторге от нее (тут нет лвлапов, прокачивать можно сразу, как наберется опыт); основной сюжет - вяленький и не особо впечатляющий, однако, побочки вполне годные; бои, как и в любой нри, с лютым рандомом, но они нескучные, есть взаимодействие с окружением, и в общем тактическая составляющая хороша; все это приправлено весьма неплохим атмосферным саундом.
Честно, игра мне очень понравилась. Так понравилась, что я ее все же прошла, не смотря на убогую  оптимизацию, краши в игре и вылеты. Сказать, что их много - ничего не сказать. Игра намертво зависала иногда каждые 5 минут, и каждый раз нужно было заходить заново. Игра крашилась в боях, в катсценах, на глобальной карте, при открытых меню персонажей и инвентаре, даже в главном меню. Пришлось копаться в обсуждениях и искать способы пофиксить баги, менять настройки запуска игры в стиме, плясать с бубном, но это было практически бесполезно. 
Я психовала, злилась, грозилась ее дропнуть. А потом наступила фаза принятия: я решила, раз игра мне действительно нравится, вытерплю это паскудство и пройду таки Blackguards до конца. Кстати, технически я ее не прошла, ибо после финального боя, игра крашнулась на последней катсцене и загрузилась в начале этого боя. Проходить его еще раз мне не захотелось, так что я выдохнула и пошла смотреть финальный ролик и титры на ютубе.
(Читала, что на релизе у очень многих игроков были такие же проблемы. Сейчас прошло 9 лет, а это не пофиксили…)

And combat is the main part of this game. It comes as a neat surprise though, that the game isn't as much ""only tactical combat"" as other people sometimes make it seem in the forums. There's a fair share of adventuring, equipment management, sometimes even choices about how to deal with quests. To be completely honest, these elements aren't nearly as prevalent as in the named cRPGs, but still, they're there to a noticeable extent.

Other than that, you mustn't expect some shiny, next-gen graphics; game's somewhat dated in that regard even for its time, if you follow my drift. But it traditionally goes without saying that these things can only add to the unique charm if you keep an open mind. Anyway, you can see the graphics in the gameplay videos, so see for yourself.

I liked the characters and the stories and it felt like a nice bonus. Also, the game's pretty long. I really didn't expect it to be. Again, some people here would say that it is monotonous.They might have a point or two, but I myself wouldn't say so. More than that: the stories differ, the main story surprises with some RP shenanigans, other modern games wouldn't dare to impose on a player nowadays, and the battles tend to propose refreshingly different scenarios and goals from time to time. Things like using the environment to your advantage, or specializing in builds to your liking are also present. In that spirit, I'd argue that 'monotonous' isn't a defining phenomenon.

All in all, I really recommend this piece, it kept me--a guy who's played nearly every ""western"" cRPG since the dawn of PC gaming--engaged for almost 20 hours straight, and that's a damn great feat in today's ""questionable and proper cRPG starved"" isometric RPG scene.",1688833849,1695112343,True,7,0,0.623613297939300537,0,False,False,False,True,,,

The core tabletop mechanics are fine, but the way the game is carried out makes everything suffer, especially you, the player.
The only way to improve your character is by getting AP to spend on EVERYTHING you can upgrade. you have to distribute it among all the things you can try to get, whether its stats, spells, weapon proficiency, and any special abilities and passives. Each mission will give you roughly 25-50 in the early game, and you need several hundred jut to upgrade one 'attribute' that is only  a 'fraction' of a stat. that, and there is NO free roaming fights or encounters, all fights are fixed and predetermined so you CANNOT try to make minor improvements to your party if a fight is too hard just to take some of the edge off. You are fully stuck with that you see if you have already done all the missions on the map.

Another big gripe is this 'injury' system that reduces your unit's stats based on number of injuries. Yes, they can be cured but the chance is abysmally low. How low? 3% apparently and even if you fail it consumes the consumable item, which there is a limited number of because shops have a limited, fixed number available. Each injury can really hurt your stats, each one reducing your effective accuracy or 'attack' if you're more familiar with dnd/pathfinder styles by 10% injury. and its  not only your attack, its also other stats like your dodge, so at 3 injuries you're down 30% most of your stats, and resting doesn't remove them. it will literally cripple you.

I'm at a mission where you have to rescue a certain npc within 5 turns, which means i have to cross a certain point in the map with any character to clear the rescue side objective. yes, it is possible to finish the map even having failed the rescue and move on, but why are the requirements this absurd? the map is literally a chokepoint bridge where they put down barricade to impede movement, plus traps that, if stepped on, immediately stop your unit movement and forcefully end their turn, plus enemy units can step on them and be perfectly fine. The entire map is literally a genshin impact abyss stall tactic that tries to force you to separate your units to race as quickly as possible to the other side, and then even if you make it, the mission itself still requires you to kill the remaining enemy mobs to actually win, with units that are likely missing half their hp because you had to race for a side objective. 
Why is a side objective this punishing? who benefits from this? do I get a free BJ for completing it because these requirements are absurd. And before you mention ""just don't do the side objective' then why is it there in the first place and why put these requirements on steroids?

I cannot recommend this, this feels like a rerun of 'darkest dungeon' levels of ""it's stupidly punishing, therefore it's good""",1687823893,1687823893,False,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It has nice art, solid music, characters are likable. But combat, UI and character development is bad.
considering the nature of the game it more upsets you than entertains. I tried to start fresh for 3 times because my character felt bad. You can't grind for XP and have comfortable difficulty level, you'll always suck because with limited skill points you won't be able to cover basic start efficiently. You can start with any class and you'll get mage and tank at the beginning. Mage runs out of mana after 2 hits and misses more than hits. tank is pretty much similar snobby imp (or gnome) who protests every time you heal him. your only chance to survive first part of the game is to make hybrid (bows + magic for healing) so your petty mage will have mana for 2-3 fire spells per battle. That could work, so you add all points into fire skill and bow skill just to find out there's also poison and traps you have no skill to avoid. no big deal you might think, but here comes the worst feature of this game: puzzles. developers want you to complete each fight in a manner they want you to, otherwise you will be swarmed by endless hordes or just will die to much stronger enemy with god skills. each fight has annoying task you should perform: cut the rope, close holes with boulders, reach target in 4 turns, lure troll to gas pit and fry him with fire spell etc. instead of fighting you're running errands for developers. that's so lame. not to mention flashbacks or special missions where they strip you off your gear and force to fight with weapon you're not skilled with.
there are so many things I dislike about this game, it has potential and you can see how developers put an effort to create it, but it's not for me.

Jest to tytuł idealny dla każdego gracza, niezależnie od wieku czy posiadanych umiejętności, rozgrywka pochłonie was na długie godziny.

[h1]Ale do rzeczy:[/h1]

Jak już zdołałem nadmienić na samym początku tej recenzji mamy tym razem do czynienia z tytułem z turowych strategii rozgrywających się w niezwykle mrocznym świecie fantasy, opowiadający fabułę w której to gracz wciela się w więźnia skazanego za morderstwo – którego poszczególne prawdziwe motywy są owiane mroczną tajemnicą, którą sam gracz będzie musiał rozwikłać.

Nad światem zbierają się ciemne chmury, zło zaczyna wychodzić z ciemnych zakamarków, terroryzując ich mieszkańców. Rozwiązanie zagadki przeszłości naszego bohatera kryje się w tym mroku dlatego też wyrusza razem z małą grupką wojowników w niebezpieczną podróż aby przeciwstawić się nadchodzącej zagładzie.
 
Rozgrywka w tym tytule polegać będzie na szerokiej eksploracji mapy świata, konwersacjach z napotkanymi po drodze osobami, wykonywaniu zleceń za które będziemy nagradzani różnymi nagrodami i fundamentalnej, taktycznej walce z przeciwnikiem – wszystko to otulone w motyw fabularny który rozwija się wraz z naszymi postępami w grze i podjętymi w jej trakcie decyzjami.

Gracz posiada duża dozę swobody działania, eksploracji obszarowej, jak również możliwości podejmowania i wykonywania misji pobocznych – system gry nie narzuca sztywno co powinniście zrobić i kiedy, to zależy od was samych. 

[h1]Dalej:[/h1]

W grze postać gracza ma status neutralny, od niego samego będzie zależeć która ścieżkę rozwoju postaci wybierze i czym będzie walczyć – tworząc wariacje szalone idealne dla swojego stylu gry, nie koniecznie sztywnie trzymając się schematu wojownika, maga czy łowcy. A w dalszej perspektywie rozwijając poszczególne ich umiejętności, oręż w taki sposób aby najlepiej zgrywały się ze sobą walcząc drużynowo.

Walki z przeciwnikiem przypominają te z gier X-COM i temu podobnych taktycznych strategii, w której to naprzemiennie decydujemy o ruchu, działaniach poszczególnych członków drużyny, przy możliwym wykorzystaniu obiektów otoczenia. Przeciwnik komputerowy działa w ten sam sposób – wygrywa ta drużyna która jako ostatnia pozostanie na arenie, bądź zostaną spełnione inne kryteria zwycięstwa (np. dotarcie do wyznaczonego miejsca / ewakuacja itp.). 

Oprawa audiowizualna jest w tym tytule dobra, choć kamera potrafi czasami majtać figle, a samo jej umiejscowienie w połączeniu z tłem otoczenia bardzo często się zlewa – uniemożliwiając widoczność wszystkich jej miejsc. Zwłaszcza jest to denerwujące, kiedy przed aktywną postacią jest pułapka którą nie możemy dostrzec bo kamera zlewa się z kolumną, drzewem (itp. rzeczami) otoczenia, maskując jej dostrzeżenie. Sterowanie jest banalnie proste, bazuje na myszce komputerowej.

[h1]Podsumowanie:[/h1]

""Normal"" Difficulty is pretty much unbearable.

I consider ""Easy"" the normal difficulty in this game.

It is still hard in ""Easy"" only getting ""easier"" if you passed the middle of the game.

""Easy"" does NOT give the enemy less powers - just less HP and magical energy.

Anything else stays the same.<

So giving a 4/10 for ""Normal"" gampeplay

and 5/10 for ""Easy"" Gameplay 
(even on easy you hit a wall end-game when you skilled not like the two spells you need on a certain level to win a neckbreaker fight to even get to the end fight)

Pro:

-Nice storyline
-likable group of scoundrels
-interesting side quests (though everything results in a battle)
-Elaborate Skill system to build you group how you like
- Build your own party with interactive skills
- After a harsh Chapter 1+2 as for choking no booty, no money and no skills it gradually opens up and mid-game turns a bit around as for difficulty.
Still ""Normal"" is way to harsh. Playing it on ""Easy"" and then it becomes a ""good"" experience feeling like normal difficulty.

Negative:
- VERY Negative: Game breaks it's own rules.
Example:
Your archer are limited as for range and sight hindered by terrain, barrels etc. and cannot shoot
ENEMY NPC Archer ignore siight hindrance and shoot from one side of the map to the other
Same goes for mages PC vs NPC
Which has devastating effects
If a game breaks it's own rules for the other side - really HARD no-go
- enemies are always there in masses - due to the given mechanics above this is just unfair fighting
Also they are on NORMAL difficulty better, have tons of healing or astral potions which you cannot even afford most of the time 
- There are traps - literally EVERYWHERE
Take a step - welcome! TRAP! You are hit hard, most of the time even wounded and/or poisoned
- Due to the one action per turn limit you are severely messed up
Example: Someone trips while surrounded. You need ONE TURN to stand up and do nothing. But when you are surrounded by 3 foes and the next one trips you also (they mostly spam same atteack) - surprise! You are down again and eat between one and two attacks and can do nothing as the other group members are also beset by 2-3 foes. Same goes for healing. You need one turn for it. So if you heal a companion either of poison or giving HP you lose a vital turn where you can take down one foe.
- Enemies HP bloat while low DPS output
You need 2-3 well placed hits to kill one enemy. But the damage output is low. So you scraping by while often enemies hit you with 3 to 5 times (!) more dps output. Add to that they outnumber you...well, you guess how it goes.
- Wounds are totally crippling
If you get too much Vital Damage there is a chance to get a wound. ONE gives you -2 to everything. But it is not uncommon to get 2 or 3 with one hit. Given you are totally outnumbered you struggle to heal your characters but are peppered all the way. Plus the mass of traps...you try to retreat walk into a trap. 
Wounds are often game breaking as you have battle ""chains"" where you can't heal or rest in between.
You get a totally fresh batch of again enemies outnumbering you (or if you are lucky the numbers are even) and your group starts crippled
- ""Normal"" difficulty is lie
""Normal"" difficulty is a totally stacked against you. Level up? Welcome the mobs you meet also level up ans are slightly better than you plus break the rules as above. ""Easy"" is Normal for me. And even there you are frustrated due to the rulebreaking for NPC.
- Loot is miserable and you can barely equip yourself
Also you lose your whole equipment several times during the game and need several battles to even get it back. Yeah, right. Totally motivating when I barely got my ""good"" gear together and POOF - it is gone. Due to story reason.


So again:

A game hampered by mechanics stacked against the players. 

Every step - be it low loot, nothing to buy in stores, low XP, Mechanics that are not for NPC while they hinder you group, Difficulty ""NORMAL"" which is anything but Normal, totally overstacked numbers of traps each map.

Will play it through but only on EASY.

That is bearable - but even there you grind you teeth in frustration as you are hindered and hampered by rules limiting range and with sight hindrance.

And which do not appy for you enemies which great you from one side to another whatever sight hindrance or range it is with withering spells and ranged fire.

And you cannot reply as...for you there are ""rules"".

As I said:

No go.

If there is a combat system same rules need to apply for the enemies.

Especially as they outnumber you every time.",1681996075,1682549142,False,5,0,0.572212398052215576,1,True,False,False,True,,,

Oyunda, oyuncu bir grup kahramanın liderliğini üstlenir ve düşmanlarla dolu bir dünyada savaşır. Oyuncular, kahramanlarının yeteneklerini geliştirir, eşyalarını yükseltir ve stratejik savaş taktikleri kullanarak zafer elde eder.

Oyuncular, karakterlerin arka planlarına, niyetlerine ve öykülerine daha derin bir anlayış kazanarak kendilerini olay örgüsüne kaptırırlar. Oyun, ayrıca karanlık ve yetişkin temaları işler ve oyuncuların kararları, hikayenin gidişatını etkileyebilir.

Blackguards'in grafikleri, detaylı karakter tasarımları ve zengin ortamlarıyla dikkat çeker. Oyunun atmosferi, Orta Çağ'ın karanlık ve acımasız dünyasını yansıtır. Ayrıca, oyunun sesleri ve müzikleri de atmosferi güçlendirir ve oyuncuları oyuna daha da çeker.

Ancak, Blackguards'in bazı dezavantajları da vardır. Oyun, karmaşık ve derinlikli hikayesi nedeniyle bazı oyuncular için ağır olabilir. Ayrıca, oyunun zorluk seviyesi yüksektir ve bazı oyuncular için sıkıcı hale gelebilir.

Sonuç olarak, Blackguards, karmaşık hikayesi, zengin karakter tasarımları ve atmosferik dünyasıyla RPG oyunlarına ilgi duyan oyuncular için ideal bir seçenektir. Ancak, oyunun yüksek zorluk seviyesi ve bazı oyuncular için ağır hikayesi, herkes için uygun olmayabilir.",1676481501,1676481501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'll give but one annoying and imbalanced scenario:
6 enemies vs my 4 allies - 1 of which is basically useless because it's forced to be placed behind a river that ALWAYS knocks you down and makes you useless for two turns and then repeat that cause the river is two turns wide. By that point that significance makes the fight lost. 
Now with the 3 characters i need to focus on one enemy and PRAY i can kill them in one turn, otherwise A HEALING CRYSTAL WILL GET THEM BACK TO FULL OR CLOSE TO FULL HP AND TREATS THEIR WOUNDS. Meanwhile in one turn enemies are able to take half of one of my characters HP if not more and my healing doesn't cure wounds and healing here only prolongs the loss cause the fucking crystal restores them fully anyway, while i'm getting weaker. Even if i kill one enemy it's still 5 vs 3 and in 2/3 turns one of my fighters dies and then outpacing the crystal healing i can kiss fucking goodbye.

Сложная [b]страгедия[/b], дающая просраться даже на нормальной сложности. 
[b]Краткая рецензия:[/b] В общем для своих лет наверное была неплохая ролевая стратегия, бросающая челендж любому кто её попробует. Но спустя года на фоне какой-нибудь Divinity, даже ненавистной мне 1-ой, она проигрывает по всем параметрам, кроме катсцен, тут они хотя бы есть и их много).
Из плюсов могу отметить :
+ Классическая старая ролевая система из днд, позволяющая прокачать вас и ваше пати ± как вам бы этого хотелось.
+ К некоторым боям необходимо подбирать определённое снаряжение и по хорошему навыки.
± Следует из прошлого пункта, хоть и игра намекает вам качаться во множество разных типо вооружения, не имение необходимых навыков и снаряжения будут приводить к появлению новых ожогов на жопе.
+ Сюжет, хоть всё прохождение я и жаловался, но слушать и читать диалоги персонажей было интересно, но не стройте напрасных надежд на историю, всё вполне обычно, в духе какого-нибудь Моровинда.
± Арены, а конкретнее наличие интерактивных объектов на них, которые действительно могут решительно изменить положение дел в бою.
С плюсами всё, перейдём к минусам:
- Боевая система хоть и интересная но ебу**е проценты будут уничтожать ваши нервные клетки. Помните Xcom? Так вот промахи на 90% тут норма и вы должны с ней смириться. Частично это потому что при атаке физой кубики кидаются на: твой шанс попадания, шанс блока противника, шанс уворота противника.
- Некоторые бои просто нечестные, не потому что врагов много или они слишком сильные, нет. В пример приведу мини-босса у которого шанс попадания залочен на 60%, которые не 60, а все 10, и  ты медленно умирая, пытаешься хотя бы раз попасть, в такие моменты пятая точка исследует космос.
- В игре достаточно мало общей информации и все нужно узнавать опытным путём, отношу к минусу, потому что сделано через одно место, а не интересно или интуитивно.
- Техническая составляющая игры. Бывают вылеты или игра зависает и не сворачивается, если у вас нет второго экрана, то это перезагрузка компьютера. Ещё были баги с общим весом снаряжения, когда у меня вес перестал убывать и только расти. Так я смирившись и дошёл до конца игры с перевесом, благо и счётчик помех тоже сломался :D и остановился на 1. Было ещё что-то, но видимо не так важно раз забыл.

Достоинства:
 ++сюжет
 ++диалоги (!!), это надо слышать, особенно Зурбарана и Норима (в английской озвучке). Актёры озвучания отработали на 5+
 ++глубокая и интересная ролевая система, позволяющая слепить почти что угодно
 ++система ранений, обширное использование ядов.

Недостатки:
 - имеются отдельные некритичные баги
 - часть ачивок сломана
 - мертворождённая система установки и обезвреживания ловушек. Сама по себе идея была, может, и неплоха, однако в процессе боя оказалась применима чуть менее, чем никак. Кстати, во второй части игры этот опыт переосмыслили в правильном направлении, предоставив игрокам возможность выставлять ловушки ДО боя, а не ВО ВРЕМЯ него (хотя сам талант, по-прежнему бесполезный, так из игры и не вырезали)

It is very unforgivingh though. If you do like a hard game this is the game for you. If you do like it a bit easier and being easily guided into a game, well, then this is not the game for you I guess. 

After the short introduction, a kind of tutorial, all you have are some weak armor parts and some more or less useless torches that uses the skills of maces to be wielded. Maybe a bow as well, however you will end up missing with that one unless you spend points into building up using a bow. You will have too small amount gold to buy any sword. The few coins you have you will need to spend on a belt. That is the only way you can have any healing poition or bandages with you in combat to use. Your spell casting character will run out of the equivalent of mana and be useless after a few spell castings, unless you have built up his bow skill. You keep missing blows even with a 75% or even a 90% chance to hit. 

Already at the first missions combat I failed, failed and failed. It took me 5 attempts to finally beat the AI opponents, grave lices, in one of the battles and yet two of my charcters were knocked unconsious and only the last one barely survived and managed to kill the last opponent with just a small amount of life left.

You need to go back and spend coins on resting at the inn, to rebuild that ""mana"" between each combat at the starting location. Once done with the last combat the innkeeper is gone so you can't replenish that way before venturing out. That is just how it goes. As I said, a very unforgiving game design. Might be too stressful and frustrating for some. It's rare that I feel stressed and frustrated at a turnbbased game, since after all you have time to think and act, but with this game I feel frustrated and tempted to just rage quit a lot. So if that's your cup of tea, then I recommend this game for you. However it is not for the faint of heart.

I don't like when games teach you mechanics via ""tutorial dumps."" Sure, it works in a way, but it's not natural, and it comes across as lazy. Blackguards dumps way too much information on the player at once, and it's simply overwhelming. Which is unfortunate, because my impression is the game has some interesting ideas. I don't play games so I can be treated like a scholar with too much time on his hands; I play games so I can feel like I'm actually playing something. 

One thing I absolutely cannot abide is abrupt difficulty spikes. Unfortunately, Blackguards has one of the worst ones I've ever seen, and that's why I decided not to continue. Sorry, it's just not worth it. I start out fighting groups of 3-4 enemies. Okay, that's cool. And then all of a sudden, I'm fighting 6 enemies who deal twice as much damage as I do, and somehow have higher accuracy than I do. There's nothing I can really do with the terrain, either: no crates to knock over, no traps to trigger, no chokepoints to take advantage of. It's just an unfair 3v6 fight where I'm outclassed. What's the fun in that?

The story, as with most CRPGs, is run-of-the-mill stuff. Wooden dialogue, cliched and tired fantasy worlds with the same predictable humanoid races. Not very compelling if you ask me. 

Maybe there's some cool stuff in this game if you have the patience for it, but I don't. There are lots of games to play, and in my experience, games don't usually start off as lukewarm and suddenly become amazing. As far as hex-based SRPGs go, I'll stick with the tried-and-true Katauri King's Bounty games, which start off excellent and remain excellent throughout.",1670391678,1670391678,False,3,0,0.535931766033172607,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Геймплей - Представляет из себя смесь X-COM, Героев меча и магии и ведьмака. Определенные моменты из игры напоминают именно о вышеописанных шедеврах. Тут и пошаговая система со способностями/перками/снаряжением из X-COM, и карта, разбитая на клетки из героев (причем весьма интерактивная, на большинстве карт можно взаиможействовать с окружением) и атмосфера 1ого ведьмака с эликсирами/зельями/ядами/ловушками/магией. В общем же игра представлена в свободном путешествии на интерактивной карте между городами и точками заданий, где уже и начинается пошаговая битва на импровизированной арене и обозначаются необходимые для победы условия. За каждую победу или выполненный квест начисляется опыт, который и служит инструментом постепенного развития персонажей. А развиваться здесь есть куда - базовые навыки (сила, ловкость и т.д.), оружейные навыки, скиллы (а-ля обнаружение ловушек, приспособленность к типу местности и т.д.), магия и особые умения. Разбираться в игре невероятно интересно.

Графика - Для года выпуска весьма хороша, да и в 22 году смотрится приятно. Локации разнообразны, окружение идеально подчеркивает стилистику, а массовые спеллы, действующие на всю карту, отлично прорисованы.

Музыка - Крайне приятный эмбиент и, что не менее важно, озвучка персонажей. Одна из тем чем-то напомнила Alien: Isolation, если не 1 в 1 с ней.

Сюжет - Самое приятное, что он логичен, да, как для сказки, порой, предсказуем, но следить за ним интересно, а принимать участие еще больше, ведь некоторые действия отчасти влияют на происходящие события. Имеется парочка твистов и огромное количество побочных заданий, выполнять которые не менее интересно, чем основной сюжет.

Итог - Крайне приятная игра, оставляющая после себя исключительно положительные эмоции и вайбы по культовым играм. 

P.S. Ачивки поломаны в усмерть, так что не удивляйтесь, когда убивая врагов огнем выпадет что-то типа дамага по своим или сбрасывая с супостатов с обрыва Вы, вдруг, овладеете магией 18 уровня)

Die Story ist besser als bei Blackguards 2, aber nicht gut.

Die Umsetzung ist bedauerlicherweise sehr unfair, der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist recht hoch, die Trefferwahrscheinlichkeiten der eigenen Helden lächerlich gering und man ist ständig pleite.

Die Ausrüstung, die man durch Kämpfe von Gegner erhält, ist meist nur wenig brauchbar und noch weniger wert.
Ausrüstung bei Händlern gibt es nur wenig und das, was es gibt, ist sehr teuer, sodass man entscheiden muss eine mäßig gute Rüstung für einen der Helden zu kaufen oder je einen Heiltrank für jeden, denn mehr kann man sich nicht leisten.

Die Gegner sind immer in der Überzahl, sind deutlich besser ausgerüstet (aber man bekommt diese Ausrüstung nach dem Sieg nicht) und treffen deutlich besser als die eigenen Helden.

Die angezeigte Trefferquote ist nie zutreffend.
Selbst bei einer angezeigten Trefferquote von 100% (sehr selten) gehen Schläge, Fernangriffe und Zauber daneben.
Meist liegt die Trefferquote zwischen 45% - 80%, aber darauf ist kein Verlass, selbst bei 80% gehen auch mal gerne 3 Angriffe hintereinander daneben. Natürlich nur die der Helden, die Gegner treffen meist sogar mit maximalen Trefferpunkten.

「The Dark Eye」独特のRPG要素が盛り込まれており、特にキャラビルド設定が非常に細かい。また、ダメージの種類も切りつけ、殴打、貫通、魔法等々が存在し、骸骨やゴーレムなんかには貫通ダメージ無効等の設定は、サブ武器の熟練度も上げる理由になるので非常に良かった。ビルド方向を間違うと詰んでしまうのでは、という不安もあるが、習得したいスキルに必要な基礎ステータスを順に上げていけば大丈夫。終盤では皆それぞれ相当強いキャラクターになってくれる。バトル中のテンポが遅く、魔法を連続で発動失敗するなどイライラしてしまう事もあるが、賛否両論の評価の割に楽しく遊べた。

ゲーム内テキストは公式で日本語化されているが、付属のＰＤＦマニュアル(英語なので翻訳必要)をプレイ前に読んでおくと、登場人物や舞台背景を知ることができゲームをより楽しめる。ストアページにある「アウトローや犯罪者の集団、ダークな大人のストーリー云々」とあるが特別にそんなことはなく、舞台であるアベンチュリア南部がワイルドで洗練されていない原始社会に近い地域であるため、登場人物がアウトローっぽく見えるだけである。
また、タイトルにドワーフのおっさんが描かれているが、彼は主人公ではない。このゲームだけではないが、「The Dark Eye」のゲームは結構面白いのがあるのに、見せ方や紹介文が洗練されてなくて微妙に見えてしまうことが多い。自分もこのゲームは全く面白そうに見えなかったので敬遠していたが、実際に遊ぶと3章から非常に面白かった。1、2章はチュートリアル的で自由度が少なく楽しくない、ここで投げ出す人も結構多いのではないか。3章まで我慢してプレイしよう。

->윈도우 사용자 이름을 영어로 만드셔야 블랙그리드 1편을 플레이 하실수가 있습니다.

저도 몰랐던 사실이지만 모든 게임중에서 윈도우 사용자 이름이 한글이면 게임하기에 불편한 부분이 많이 있습니다.
-윈도우 사용자 이름을 윈도우 설치 할때 영어로 사용자 이름을 등록 하는 것을 추천 합니다.
-PC방에도 윈도우 사용자 이름이 영어로 되어서 사용자 컴퓨터도 영어로 사용자를 하니까 옛날 게임 사용자가 정확하게 인식이 되면서 블랙그리드 1편이 시작이 되는 것을 알게 되었습니다.
-사용자 이름을 꼭 영어로 등록하고 게임을 해보세요. 익스프레이스 탄 느낌이 들껌니다. 

블랙그리드 게임을 처음으로 샀을때 스타크레프트 게임과 비슷해서 몇일 하다가 그만 둔 게임이 였습니다.
2년이 지나서 PC방에서 업무를 보다가 블랙그리드 1편을 시작을 하게 되었습니다.
난이도 와 조작감이 어렵지 않아서 PC방 업무 끝나고 뒤에 시간에 블랙그리드 게임을 시작을 했습니다.
어렵기도 하고 복잡기도 하고 수많은 도전을 하고도 또 그만을 두고 1년이 지나고 난뒤에 컴퓨터가 좋아지고 게임환경이 좋아져서 집에서 블랙그리드 게임을 시작을 했습니다.

-게임을 시작할때 캐릭터 아이템 과 스킬 , 기술창을 꼼꼼히 봐야 했습니다. 턴 방식으로 진행을 했지만 스킬 사용과 캐릭터 육성에 실패해서 그만 두다가 큰 마음 먹고 처음부터 끝까지 모든 스테이지 와 능력치 캐릭터 부분 쪽에 포인트 올리고 스킬도 막 쓰면서 게임을 하니까 RPG 게임을 이제야 제대로 해볼수 있었습니다
중간에 막히는 부분은 트레이너 ^__^ ;; 를 써서 넘어가고 도전과제도 쉽게 성공을 했습니다.

스테이지 마다 난이도가 엄청나게 높고나 낮아서 게임할때 플레이하기가 어려웠습니다.
-무기로 적을 잡는데 95% 확률 성공인데 실패 0_0? 속이 아팠음 스테이지 마다 확률에 실패하는 부분이 많이 떳습니다. 전투기록 창에는 성공이라고 뜨고 무기 공격은 실패 게임이니까 참고 넘어 갔다. 실패 성공도 있을수 있었습니다. 무기와 스킬이 잘 바쳐 주면 스테이지 공략이 쉬워 진다는 부분 트레이너를 사용하면서 알게 되었습니다.
-그리하여 트레이너 덕분에 성공 , 트레이어 없이도 성공 두 가지 게임 타입으로 게임을 시작하고 끝을 봤습니다.
-블랙그리드 1편과 2편을 모두 엔딩 봤습니다. 어렵고 힘든 게임 시간을 완료 하니까 기쁘고 뿌듯 합니다.

對於負評較多讓我有些意外, 大概看了一下後, 整理我的想法與建議

1) 請選擇英文版本
這遊戲的中文翻譯很爛, 很多句子每個字都懂, 但湊成整句卻不知所云, 會影響對劇情的了解, 以及遊戲的技巧與技能理解, 這點非常重要, 如果訣竅都沒抓到, 點數分配都錯誤, 隨著劇情推進, 難度逐漸提升, 你會愈玩愈痛苦是理所當然的

再說, 這遊戲出了兩代, 第二代沒有中文, 如果你真的想玩, 到了二代還是得看英文, 所以不如一代就用英文玩, 到時候閱讀第二代的文字時比較好銜接, 除非是重要的選項、技能講解或重複出現的單字, 否則我也懶得查字典, 大概性的懂就好了, 重點是戰鬥的樂趣

2) 命中率極低
看到不少人反映命中率低, 或魔法成功率低的問題, 隨著劇情推進我也漸漸有發現, 結果發現遊戲右上角有個Rules有遊戲所有屬性與技能的詳細講解可以看, 一樣要用英文看, 中文的不知道在公啥小, 看完後才發現自己腳色屬性配置有錯, 才會導致技能與魔法的成功率慘的可憐, 強烈建議遊戲一開始就去看Rules, 後面遇到相關配點或養成疑問, 至少知道要去哪找答案

總之, 那個Rules都讀過並理解機制後, 配點逐漸上手, 腳色養成後, 後期幾乎沒有遇到太困難的戰鬥, 靠著遊戲機制都可以過關, 遊戲有很多物品、技能與魔法都有它的巧思, 如果可以熟悉或善用, 遊戲難度就不算太高",1666439319,1666439319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Not the easiest game to play through, without having to redo it again... and probably again. As there is a bit of a learning curve and a very over complicated skills/attributes tree. It's not obvious at first, that you need to upgrade a spell or skill by eight times to get to the second level of it... That could have been clearer and I've distributed the action point quite evenly and hit a wall in a fight at the end of chapter three - beginning of four. which has two ogres and three wizards to defeat in a limited number of turns (Less than 15% have the achievement for chapter 3 completion, but it's after that, when it gets hard).  The first 4 hours of game play are exceptionally slow and the most linear, but I found it got better as the characters started to build and the challenges became more dynamic and interesting.   

The game is very well made however and the fighting is quite change-able... making it both fun and challenging. I feel a bit restricted in the path of the adventure and following the main quests will find yourself doing the wrong mission too soon and getting stuck. As the game states, regular saving is very important despite the auto save feature. The personalities of the other characters is great and the background music is fine. It has puzzle elements to the battles, as there are environmental factors in the battles, which adds nicely to the combat. It is slow paced but I'm enjoying it, but unless you use your action points very wisely it is frustrating and obviously a game that most don't finish without the use of a guide to stats, spells and special ability allocation. Solid 7.5/10 will be a shame if I don't complete it. There are more modern games out there and the story does meander with a lot of travelling around in circles.... this isn't an RTS like Original Sin but it is 79 pence on sale and obviously made with a lot of love, it requires patience and a love of turn based combat.",1666392208,1670019922,True,2,0,0.511704981327056885,0,False,False,False,True,,,

[u]les + :[/u]
      - décors sympas, bonne ambiance de villages d'époque
      - bonnes idées de combats de boss (ex: [spoiler] vous ne pouvez pas le vaincre sans utiliser l'environnement car il est trop puissant pour vous (ce qui est assez réaliste et bienvenu), alors il faudra attiré le boss au bon endroit pour pouvoir lui faire des gros dégâts dû à un de ses faiblesses qui se trouve dans l'environnement[/spoiler])
     - utilisation des sorts intéressant. C'est pas seulement du ""taper, taper, taper!"" mais il est certaines fois impératif d'utiliser un sort de mur magique pour empêcher une deuxième vague d'ennemis d'arriver alors que vous en baver avec la première déjà.
     - choix de plusieurs sets d'armes possibles en combat
     - arbre des compétence, sorts et aptitudes libre permettant de faire évoluer le perso comme on l'entend (avec des restrictions logiques du genre pas assez de point d'intelligence alors tu ne peux pas faire de magie parce que tu n'as pas de point de mana... on est libre de choisir, mais ça reste cohérent)
 
[u]les - :[/u]  
     -...libre, libre, oui mais non, parce qu'on est libre de faire comme on veut mais on ne peut remporter les batailles que de la manière dont le jeu nous oblige à le faire. Donc le jeu nous dis ""fais comme tu veux, mais de toutes façons ça ne marcheras que comme j'ai décidé""(""Mouhais Mouhais !"") 
Si c'était une ou deux fois, par rapport à un contexte de l'histoire, bon okey,  mais non, là c'est ""tu peux choisir de faire une boule de feu sur tes ennemis, mais si tu fais ça au lieu de faire un mur magique pour les empêcher de passer, il vont te massacrer en surnombre"" ou ""tu peux couper cette corde pour faire tomber ce chandelier sur tes ennemis, mais si tu ne le fais pas, ils vont t'étriper, vu qu'ils sont bien plus costaud que toi"" ou ""tu peux choisir de spécialiser ton archer à l'arbalète plutôt qu'à l'arc, mais non tu peux pas parce qu'il te faut avoir les stats d'un guerrier CAC pour pouvoir t'en équipé"" ou ""tu peux apprendre la magie à ton guerrier, ha bah non, parce que ça va tellement déséquilibrer l'équipe que tu ne peux pas te le permettre, le jeu étant fait pour fonctionner avec un magicien, un guerrier et une autre classe qui se spécialisent dans leur propre catégories""
     - projectiles et sorts qui passent au travers des obstacles, lignes de visées pas logiques.
     - % de chances de toucher complètement fausses (ex : se louper 3x de suite avec 90% chance de hit ou toucher 3x de suite avec un 45%...)
     - ça ne sert à rien d'avoir des armes à deux mains, les dégâts supplémentaires étant négligeables par rapport à la perte de protection du bouclier.
     - les compétences dans l'arbre ne sont pas claires sur leur effets (combien de dégâts supplémentaires ou de chance de toucher par niveau de compétences d'arme par exemple)
     - dialogues: la photo/avatar du personnage qui nous parle ne correspond pas du tout à sa vraie tête quand on le voit sur son stand ( ex: photo d'un jouflu riche de la cinquantaine habillé de soieries quand le perso du stand est un barbu commun de la quarantaine max qui est habillé avec du cuir, typé chasseur...)
     - histoire qui se veut mystérieuse, mais qui donne surtout l'impression d'être flou. ça TRAIIIIIIIIIINE en longueur.

[u]En somme[/u], une ambiance, un gameplay et un arbre de compétences plutôt sympas et cohérents gâchés par une rigidité linéaire, un aléatoire mensonger, un manque de clarté des effets concrets des compétences et la platitude non pas tant de l'histoire mais plutôt de sa narration.

I did get a nice ""D&D Vibe"" from this game as your character stats page is called a character sheet and reads like one.  RNG on spells can be a bit of a heart breaker, but once you understand how to invest the correct amount of AP (Experience currency) into a spell and back it up with supporting base stats, the casting is no longer an issue.  This game is all about specializing and really thinking how you are going to flesh your character out.   By the way, it is okay to hold onto those AP points until you really know which way your are going to take your character.

Spielzeit: ca. 33 Stunden
Spieldurchläufe: 1 (Ende)

Ich war, nach Lektüre einer guten Handvoll Rezensionen hier bei Steam, schon 100% überzeugt, dass ich das Spiel weder spielen noch mögen würde und höchstens für die Karten 2 Stunden idlen lasse, aber, welch Wunder, hat mich das Spiel vom 1. Moment an am Haken gehabt!

Wer mit Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment etc. aufgewachsen ist, der fühlt sich in Blackguards sofort wohl. Nein, natürlich unterscheiden sich die Spiele und noch mal nein, Blackguards ist nicht mal ein müder Abklatsch der Klasse eines 20 Jahre alten Klassikers (was das wohl aussagt...), aber: Das Spiel ist trotzdem nicht übel. 

Rundenbasiertes Kampfsystem mit sehr viel Tiefe, interessante Charaktere, das DSA-System, etwas abgefeilt. Die Graphik ist ok, die Zeichnungen schön. Die Story wird immer hervorgehoben, sagen wir mal so: Anfangs ist sie stark. Im Kern ist der Plot keine Offenbarung, aber durch viele Windungen entfaltet sie sich lange sehr stark, man ist durchaus gefordert, interessiert und emotional gebunden. Das Grinden und generelle Finden von Nebenquests ist gut, fast jeder Kampf eine Herausforderung für die grauen Zellen, das Stärker-Werden dank unzähliger verschiedener Talentbäume, das Spiel hat viele Stärken, aber leider auch viele Schwächen:

- das Ende fällt gnadenlos ab. Sorry, aber das Spiel wirkt wie ""Geld ausgegangen"" oder ""Publisher zieht das Releasedatum vor"". Wie man so schwach abschließen kann, ist schon wirklich eine Kunst. Niemand erwartet mächtige, millionenteure Cinematics, aber das Ende ist wirklich schaurig. 
- Items: Die Items in dem Spiel sind durchgehend monoton. In jedem anderen Rollenspiel wären das Sachen für die ersten 1-2 Stunden, die man hier im Lategame trägt. ""Namenlose Lederrüstung mit 2 Zeilen Lore-Text"", ""Kettenhemd-Set"", ""Gelehrten-Stoffkleidung"" etc. Ich meine, für das Setting vielleicht gar nicht übel, dass bewusst verzichtet wird auf ""Kunens Power-Set"" oder ""Carmens Siegelring"" oder ""Neptulons Dreizack"", zumal es diese ""besonderen"" Items tatsächlich gibt, aber nur sehr wenige, die auch kaum wertetechnisch hervorstechen. Sie haben weder andere Farbstufen noch das Gefühl, man würde hier was Einzigartiges finden. Mein Zwerg, Naurim, hatte bis kurz vor Schluss seine eigene Axt aus den Anfangszeiten, einfach weil es nichts Besseres gab, auch der Zauberer Zubaran trug ewig ""seinen"" eigenen Stab von der Einführung. Puhhhhh... in Baldurs Gate konnte man schon in den ersten Städten riesige Sachen finden oder bei Händlern kaufen (oder klauen), hier, in Blackguards, führen die Händler nur langweiliges Zeug... ich bin völlig einverstanden damit, dass das Spiel komplett auf sämtliche Diebesfähigkeiten verzichtet, aber dann lasst uns doch wenigstens gute Sachen finden + in Quests verdienen + KAUFEN. 
- Map/Städte: Unzählige Mappunkte/Dörfer bestehen nur aus 1, 2 NPCs, die man überhaupt ansprechen kann, meistens nutzlose Händler oder Gastwirte. Ich verstehe das nicht, wozu? Um die Welt auszudehen, damit es nicht nur 6, 7 Orte gibt? Warum nicht wenigstens 1-2 Nebenquests in jedem Ort?
- Party: Blackguards lässt dir NIE die Wahl, wer in deiner Party ist. Nicht nur das, man verliert sogar regelmäßig Mitglieder nach Skript. Buh! Für die Story mag das reizvoll sein, für ein Spiel wie das ist es eine Katastrophe. Man denkt sich noch, hey, diese Rolle X hat Person Y, der Rest skillt also Z und 2 Stunden später, ZACK, Y ist tot. Und nein, kommt auch nicht bald wieder oder wird ersetzt durch Q. Einfach weg. Und ebenfalls nein, man kann nie irgendwelche Partymitglieder einladen/ausladen. Da waren wir schon mal weiter...
- Nebenquests: In Kapitel 3 gab es eine riesige Fülle, da konnte man allein 10 Stunden damit verbringen, aber in allen anderen Kapiteln nur sehr wenig bis gar keine. Sicher, ein 30-Stunden Spiel, das für manche wohl auch 40 und mehr gegangen ist, muss man vielleicht nicht NOCH MEHR strecken, aber trotzdem fühlt sich das Spiel in der meisten Zeit sehr ""leer"" an. Eine riesige Karte, zig Ortschaften, aber nirgendwo passiert irgendwas. 
Immerhin war alles bugfrei und die Erklärungen zu den Shortcuts, Hotkeys, Tastenbelegungen, Regelwerk etc. sind sehr einsteigerfreundlich gehalten, genau wie das Tutorial. 

Fazit: Ein Spiel, dass ich eigentlich ""wegwerfen"" wollte, hat mich 30 Stunden+ gefesselt und bis auf das Ende überwiegend positiv überrascht. Ich denke, es wurden ein paar massive Fehler im Design gemacht, die für viele SpielerInnen langweilig oder sogar schlecht herüberkommen könnten, aber ich möchte Blackguards trotz der vielen schlechten (insgesamt ""nur"" ausgeglichenen) Rezensionen dennoch - mit Einschränkungen - empfehlen!",1663956544,1663956544,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Interesting system - character creation and combat but this title feels bare bones. Feels beta still, like it got a great start but has maybe 10% of the content it should. Trainers are almost useless. They might train a single ability. Maybe because I'm use to titles like Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Assassin's creed Valhalla, Odyssey, Origins, etc. These titles have a lot of content and their worlds are robust. This title doesn't feel robust and its far to linear. I really enjoyed the stats system, the way you could use a slider with your weapons to use them for defensively or offensively in increments. I found this a lot of fun and worthwhile to use and have never seen it in other titles. Loved the dialogue in the conversations. It felt real, legit, as if the people were being honest and their banter was worthwhile to listen to. Loved the voices in the conversations. The conversations weren't dry or dead but I wanted to see what everyone was going to say.  So many titles are the same old boring conversations. This story was interesting! 

The combat I found to be very limited and a bit too slow paced - again maybe because I am use too action rpgs. The number of spells was far too limited and I found my options in combat to be very one dimensional. OH! Combat - fireball - fireball - fireball - flame burst - flame burst - flame burst - toss in the ice ray and the magic missile and that was a casters grand list of options. Sure a few buffs and debuffs, some heals, and cleansers but done! It would all easily fit inside a single spell book and there for left no reason to search the ""world"" for more power. 

I would have liked to see the weapon defense/offense sliders also adjust damage. Seems to me that if someone is fighting more defensively that they would do less damage and not just in misses because of a lower attack. Perhaps a 3:1, 4:1, 5:1 ratio of attack increase to added damage. The current system gave you more attack and parry (a single parry each round) and it ran out of steam fast. I didnt need all the attack I had, there was no added incentives to add more attack, so I used more defense and found that very limited because of the combat system. 

Some good. Some bad. But all in all this title feels unfinished and VERY limited in combat so much that after a few dozen hours its losing its interest to the player.

Have to compatibility mode it to Windows 7 but still there are some crashing issues and manage to finally finish this game.

I say this as a casual in Tactical game this is an alright game. Characters are likeable enough for me.
In terrms of gameplay there are features in old tactical game that are absent here and makes the game really slow and frustrating. 

OK the last tactical game I have played is Vandal Hearts 2 but I can safely say that game is way better than this one and its an older game.
 In VH2 your character can go through other allies occupied space and the latter will just side step in the way in Blackguards you can't do that. 
You also can't use range spells or missiles if your allies in the way of Line of sight if I remember correctly VH2 doesn't have that you can shoot enemies even if your ally is in the line of sight.
Other thing is in VH2 moving and attacking are separate, what I mean is you can move then attack but you can also attack and then move which is really good. In Blackguards once you attack that character's turn is done you can't move and I find it makes the game really tedious and slow.

When it comes to battles at least Blackguards have some redeeming aspects, there are some varieties like go from point A to point B doesn't matter if you don't kill all the enemies. And when say one of your ally get knockdowned you can just leave him and just continue to point B and once all the surviving characters get to it it's mission accomplish that is good.
Some missions are like rescuing people. or getting some stuff and escaping which really mix up the battle in a good way.
There are missions though that are so mindlessly designed to be frustrating just to spite the players. I remember 2 of them. One is in the arena where you go in this maze like area full of neverending lice enemies unless you cover their nest hole. They put a lot of single hex area so just look up what I said on the QoL of VH2 vs Blackguard as it can really show the glaring issues. Same as the Neetha graveyard there are single hex lane with infinite enemy ghouls. Those 2 missions make me pissed as those battles are not really hard just tedious and frustrating in a very bad way and most likely your game will crash anyway and I won't waste my time.

Anyway I give this game a small thumbs up, its short alright game but don't give such high expectation if you give this a chance.

そもそもCRPG自体、コンピュータ上でどうにかしてTRPGを再現できないかという試行錯誤の歴史だったわけだが、一方で、電子ゲームという媒体でRPGを楽しむための工夫を凝らしてきた「最適化」の歴史でもあった。
マシンスペックの向上やクリエイターの成熟により電子ゲームの表現能力が高くなり、「さあ今こそTRPGの再現を！」と息巻いてゲーム制作に取り掛かった場合、どういうわけか、先人が切り拓いてきた「最適化」の技術を忘れてしまうことが多い。
端的に言って、プレイヤーやゲームマスターの能動的な介入を排除した場合、TRPGというのはRNG（ダイスロール）依存の運ゲーにしかならない。実際のところ、TRPGの「システム」と電子ゲームは、それほど相性が良くないのである。古くはSFC版ソードワールド、MCD版シャドウランが相当し、直近ではShadowrun ReturnsやPopup Dungeonがまさにその轍を踏んでいる。
TRPGを参考にしたゲームにも名作は多い。それらはTRPG的な自由度を目指す一方で、RNG依存の運ゲー的要素は極力廃してきた。電子ゲームを遊ぶプレイヤーにとって、運ゲー要素はストレスにしかならないとわかっていたからである。要は、TRPG的なアプローチを参考にするか、システムを再現するかという話である…

Blackguardsは「The Dark Eye」というドイツ製のTRPGをベースにしたUnity 3製のRPGである（フォロワーではなく公式ライセンスを得て制作されている）。The Dark Eyeは84年に初版が発行されヨーロッパ圏でヒットした、あちら版D&Dのようなもので、本作では無実？の罪で投獄された主人公を筆頭に、クセの強いアウトローたちを仲間に加えて冒険していくことになる。
製品説明がやたらとおどろおどろしいが、実際はそれほど根暗な代物ではなく、テキストはユーモアに溢れている。仲間となるアウトローたちは悪党というより、社会的規範よりも自分ルールを優先した結果落ちぶれたはみだし者といった風情で、たとえばビジネスとして悪事を働く犯罪結社の一員などとは異なる種類の「ダメ人間」たちである。会話に仲間が積極的に介入するのも特徴で、このあたりはTRPGでのプレイヤー間のコミュニケーションを再現しているようで面白い。
しかし如何せん、ゲームシステムが地味で単調、反復的に過ぎる…とりわけ成長システムがTRPG準拠のダイナミズムに欠けるものであるため、どれだけ成長させてもあまり強さが実感できない。これは敵も同じで、シナリオが進んでもそれほど強さが変わらないため、序盤から終盤までずっと同じような戦いを繰り返していくことになる。とにかく一回の戦闘に時間がかかるので、申し訳ないが、これを最後までプレイすることはできなかった。あるいはこれを、戦闘重視のTRPGキャンペーンがなぜ面白くないかを説明するための反面教師的な見本とできるかもしれない。
難易度が高く、ビルドでミスると最初からやり直す破目になるにも関わらず、シナリオ進行そのものはほぼ一本道でリプレイ性に欠けるのも問題だ。「これをまたやり直すの！？」という思いは、まあ…優れたゲームに抱く感想とは言い難い。ストーリーに興味はあったが、苦痛なゲームプレイを耐えるほどの希求力はなかった。
Unityのバージョンが古いため仕方ないが、最適化や安定性に欠け、20GBというクソデカ容量もおそらくはアセットの重複が多いためだろうと思われる。
原作のThe Dark Eyeに思い入れがある、深い造詣がある場合は、また違った感想になるのだろうけども…",1658624028,1658744080,False,1,1,0.488232344388961792,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Beide sind natürlich auch erheblich jünger als dieses hier, aber Blackguards hat mich einfach nicht gepackt. Die Grafik ist ganz schön gemacht, aber die Kämpfe sind irgendwie dröge. Die Bewegung zwischen den Kämpfen finden auf einer nicht sonderlich schönen Karte statt und auch nur in der Form, dass man auf ein Symbol klickt (man steuert hier also keine Figuren durch die Landschaft).

A lot of the battles are RNG based and most of them are frustrating as all the enemies have poison for no real reason.
From chapter 3 most poisons enemies use are level 3, so you can only remove them with a max ranked Clarum Purum as the Witch's Spirit spell can only remove up to level 2.
Oddly enough Clarum Purum rank 1 removes ""up to level 1"", rank 2 ""up to level 1"", rank 3 ""level 1-2"" and rank 4 mass cures all poisons, which is just silly.

Several actions such as drinking potions, applying poison and changing weapons (unless you have 18 points in warfare) take away your entire turn and some poisons are gone after a few attacks/turns making it even more silly.

The inventory management is also a giant pain in the ass and the loot is actually quite limited.
There's few sets of armor most are sets which don't cover all slots.
The special weapons seem to be mostly daggers for mages and crosbows only.

Pros :
-Reasonable price

Cons :
-The graphics are average (I can easily live with that given the low price of the game)
-The story is pretty boring, I did not feel very engaged.
-The combats are not very interesting, and the hit % are weird (I can miss 5+ times in a row hits that have 90% hit chances)
-The characters customization is boring. You have a LOT of options, which is nice, but most of them feels borderline useless and you need to invest a lot of points to feel a tiny difference.
-Some combats are incredibly easy while others feels very challenging. I love challenges, but I don't like the inconsistency of the game.

I'm not saying this game is horrible, but it feels very bland. I played the game quite a reasonnable amount of time, and I did not enjoy many of the hours I was playing.

[h1]Graphics & Sound: 7/10[/h1]
[h1]Narration: 7/10[/h1]

✔️ Interesting plot, with an engaging world. The story is a bit edgy sometimes, but succeeds not to be absurdly grimdark.
✔️ Good depth of mechanical customisation for your characters. Being based on a tabletop RPG system helps.
✔️ The companions manage to have a fair amount of personality, which is rare and enjoyable.
✔️ A good deal of effort has been done to provide a wide variety of battles, with special interactions, interesting layouts, and alternative goals.
✔️ The overall balance feels very fair, providing an adequate level of challenge, while rarely being unbearably difficult. This probably depends on how well you managed to handle the character building system though.
✔️ Nice sense of detail on character models, equipment, and world map.
✔️ Enjoyable music, and fully voiced dialogues.
✔️ The game seems to use its graphical resources in a smart way - it doesn't seem to have a huge amount of different models and illustrations, but it arranges it in ways that avoid to feel repetition too much. The ""fixed view"" location displays help a lot in that direction, and have some charm of their own.

❌ The game lacks mechanical clarity. [b]A lot.[/b] Many effects are not explained, the way encumbrance works is barely hinted at, and the UI is very unclear about what bonuses your armor actually provides you. Nothing explains you how exactly your spells' efficiency relies on your attributes. Nothing even explains you how your attacks are rolled and why 100% accuracy attacks may miss. Nothing explains you how perception works exactly. The game provides tons of numbers but gives no indication of how they fit together. This is my biggest grudge with this game. I had to recreate a character five times before I understood how I'm supposed to build it - and it's very kind from the game to provide prebuilt characters to avoid that mess, but you still have to deal with it on your level ups, so it only delays the problem, and I would much rather the game gave you an actual tutorial on the combat system it uses.
❌ Some specific battles suffer from a similar lack of clarity, where you have to fail the battle once to understand what exactly is going on there.
❌ Despite the effort put in differentiating the battles and creating refreshing arenas, you really feel that the battle system behind it is quite a bit boring. Luckily battles don't tend to drag, but still the lack of diversity of combat actions for non-magic characters tends to get a bit annoying over the course of the game. [b]I definitely recommend to build a magic user for the player character, even if the magic isn't their main focus[/b], otherwise I think that you'll find that your character turns get quite a bit monotonous - and the game already provides two non-magic characters that fill up the roles of basic melee fighters very well.
❌ At some points the narration gets a bit weak, and it lacks some degree of player choice to my taste.
❌ The interface is pretty ugly and not user friendly.

Overall [b]despite its awful onboarding and user experience[/b] I recommend this game, because it provides a rather interesting turn-based RPG experience, supported by an enjoyable story, and actually seems to have a soul, given the amount of little details that have received a surprising amount of care by the development team. Don't expect a polished gem, the game is rough about the edges, but still an entertaining and engaging experience over the course of 50-ish hours.",1646615836,1673454232,True,2,0,0.536385238170623779,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Bzzzzztt....

Spürst Du schon, wie sich die feinen Haare an Deinen Armen langsam aufstellen? Gut so, das ist genau die Art von Anspannung, die Dich erfasst, kurz bevor vor Zorn explodierst, weil die RNG Götter Dir in einem Spiel wie diesem mal wieder nicht hold waren.

""PUFF!"", und das wars dann mit Dir, schade, aber so spielt das Leben...

Aber vielleicht bist Du ja wie ich, total ausgeglichen und stets Herr über Deine Emotionen.... so richtig ""zen"" eben...
Tja, selbst dann wirst Du hier irgendwann durchdrehen, denn das hier ist eben eine tolle Umsetzung des DSA Universums und da wird viel viel viel, sehr viel gewürfelt. 

Und Du weißt ja, wie das so ist, ""Alea iacta sunt"" und so, oder wie der Nicht-Römer sagen würde: ""Arghhhhh! Diese vermaledeiten Dreckswürfel!!! Jedesmal die gleiche ver- piep piep piiiiiep piep, soll doch der Teufel diese ver - piep piiiep piep piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiep.. holen!!!!

Keine Sorge, lieber Leser, für Dein unschuldiges, sanftes Gamer Gemüt ist dieser Wutausbruch extra neu vertont worden. Aber bevor Du jetzt wieder die böse Zensur um Gaming Bereich beschwörst, lass Dir gesagt sein: Du wirst die eben noch zensierten Textzeilen sicher beim Spielen von Blackguards auf höchst kreative und Jugend gefährdende Weise selbst intonieren  ;-)

Und damit haben wir den Knackpunkt auch schon entdeckt, die bösen Würfel sinds diesmal. Und die rollen exakt immer eine Drehung zu weit, zu kurz oder purzeln gleich ganz vom Tisch, sodass man rein gar nichts gebacken bekommt in dem Spiel. Welches noch dazu so richtig sauschwer ist, was den Eindruck der absolut unfairen Unfairness noch verstärkt. 

Da kommt auch flott mal Frust auf, die Bewertungen sprechen eine deutliche Sprache. Die Hälfte mag die Herausforderung und ist emotional so gefestigt, dass ihr alles piepegal ist und die andere Hälfte beißt in die Tastatur und drückt den Deinstall Button schneller, als ein betrunkener Zauberer nen Ignifaxius raus rülpsen kann.

Drum frag Dich selbst, lieber Leser: ""Bin ich so hardcore DSA Fan, dass ich mir das zumuten will?"" 
Schau in Dein Gamerherz und ergründe, ob Du die wirklich wunderschöne Story erleben willst, die von Kameradschaft und Verrat erzählt, von Liebe und Hass, von Intrigen und Magie und all das in einer bildschönen Welt voller Wunder.

Und als wenn das nicht ein bisschen Frust schon wert wäre, dann sinds die tollen Charaktere allemal. Vom pyromanischen Zwerg Naurim über den zaubernden Schwerenöter Zurberan bis zur LSD Drogen Elfe Niam gibts hier Charakterköpfe, einer schrulliger und sympatischer als der andere. Und alle haben sie ihren eigenen liebenswerten Geschichten zu erzählen, agieren und interagieren untereinander wie ein echtes Team und wachsen Dir sicher als Weggefährten unendlich ans Herz.

Und ja, auch die Welt tut ihr Übriges, um Dich in den Bann zu ziehen. Die Orte, die Du bereist, fühlen sich plastisch und lebendig an, die Grafik ist erstaunlich gut gealtert und der Sound eine Wucht. Die Vertonung der Protagonisten ist genial on point und auch Musik und Umgebungssound wissen zu gefallen. 

Eigentlich ist also alles bereitet für ein wahrhaft großes Taktik RPG, doch erinnerst Du Dich noch an die Passage mit dem Polarisieren? 
Die kommt genau jetzt! Bäm!

Der Kampf ist genial. 
So, ich habs gesagt, jetzt kann jeder loslegen mit flamen und verdammen. Mir gefallen die Hexfeld Schlachten auf den toll designeten Karten, mir gefällt der wahnsinnig hohe Schwierigkeitsgrad und mir gefällts, dass nicht immer alles nach Plan läuft, wenn die Würfelgeister mal wieder so richtig ihre klebrigen Finger im Spiel haben.
Ich mag die knappen Ressourcen und dass man jeden Erfahrungspunkt dreimal ausquetschen muss. Es ist schön, dass man sich auch mal übel verskillen kann, denn sowas kennen wir heute nicht mehr. Man muss eben aufpassen, wie man seinen Build beginnt und wissen, wohin man schlussendlich damit will.

Und ja, ich kann auch vollkommen verstehen, wenn man all das so richtig eklig findet. Und dann bezeichne ich auch keinen als Weichgespülten Hobby RPG Noob, bloß weil er sich mehr Komfortfunktionen und ein einfacheres Gameplay wünscht. (Denken tu ichs aber schon, Du Noob, hihihi...)

Aber da scheiden sich eben die Geister, ich will ein Hardcore RPG mit Taktikkämpfen, bei denen ich mir die Haare büschelweise ausraufe. Das krieg ich hier und noch mit toller Story und coolen Charateren obendrauf. 

Und wer das nicht will, naja... der kann immer noch was anderes zocken. Doch wurde hiermit immerhin vorgewarnt.

Aber ausprobieren sollte eigentlich jeder Blackguards mal, denn für einen lächerlichen Goldtaler im sale kann ja nun wirklich gar nix schief gehen, oder?

Also ab in die Welt von DSA mit Dir und Du wirst ja merken, ob Du beim Zocken nur Frust oder...

... viel Spaß hast  ;-)

Gameplay:
*********
RPG na ťahy zo starej školy ale teda hooodne kontroverzné.Jednak obtiažnosť aj na najľahšej je miestami nenormálne ťažká,ceny v obchodoch sú úplne otrasne predražené,súboje sú veľmi dlhé a stačí jedna chyba alebo nejaká trápna náhoda a idete odznova .....a to teda nasere.A ešte k tomu je tu aj pár debilných bugov.

Výborné je,že strom dovedností je doslova obrovský takže si postavu môžete vypilovať ako chcete.Problém ale je,že bodov,hoci sa to nezdá,je málo.Takže urobiť si napríklad čistého bojovníka na blízko sa rovná istej smrti lebo hra na vás vyťahuje kopec taktických bitiek kde treba rozmýšľať ale niekedy ani to nestačí.Protivníci sa vyhnú kľudne aj 90% šanci na zásah a na opačnej strane vás dohryzú trápni pavúci nech ste silní ako chcete/brnenie je asi zbytočnosť alebo čo/

Mág hoci má kúziel za vagon je slabá figúrka pretože lektvary sú moc drahé a manu vyplytváte rýchlo a v podstate s ním neurobíte ani čo potrebujete.Takže jediná naozaj dobrá taktika sú lukostrelci...ovšem zase všetkého je obmedzený počet takže ak obchodník vypredá všetky šípy nové už nebude mať......hmmmmm ale peňazí má neobmedzene...hmmm divné.

Questov je hodne ale za ich splnenie sú malé odmeny.Skôr získate veci od mrtvych po vyhratých bitkách ako nákupom v obchodoch.Dobrý nápad sú aj učitelia dovedností ale tam je zase problém bodov.

the blackguards game is almost making me wanna find the dark eye RPG rules just so i can work out what the hell is happening! why does the caster that's not me have much less accuracy by like 20%? why are 3 dice rolled whenever a spell is cast? what the hell are talent points? it seems to be using some form of THACO like AD&D2e did, making it confusing to work out whether stuff that changes my numbers is good! does bonus init help? does penalty to att help or hinder? i'm mostly choosing which wep/shield/armour are better based on which costs the most atm!
i think i get why the other caster is less accurate mechanically, his scores are 1-2 lower, but why thematically - no idea - and 3d20 seems an overly complex system - gotta try to remember which 3 score are for which spells, try to not use other spells etc. the main character is created using the auto-generated stats, and he has a spell which is consistently 45% success rate, compared to a couple which are 97%, why would i ever use the former?! the other caster has a 49% spell that's like small equiv to fireball, i use it sometimes, but damn is 49% success rate annoying!
last night i had to do a combat about 5 times as i needed to pass 2 bridges to save the girl! kept getting past the bridge them everyone died right afterwards!
there was another combat where you fought maybe 4 easy creatures, then progressed a bit further and there were another 4, then a bit further and there were another 4 (i think maybe 4 sets!), but you didn't provoke the next set until you moved forward, and your mana equiv regens, and ofc you have healing spells, so at least once i just ended turn 10 times while mana regenned and i healed everyone to full!
restarted the game and looked at some build guides - which ofc didn't help the really annoying combat i mentioned above - which ofc also has unavoidable 1 hit kill environmental effects, which i apparently just happened to miss all of last time i did it - done it twice now and each time 1 of my PCs killed by falling rocks if you don't happen to notice the dripping water, you're dead, if you notice it too late and can't move in time, you're dead -quit for the night - so frustrating! 
restarted the game after i tried a combat maybe 5 times where there's a crystal behind 5 enemies that you have to charge to with your tank and smash it, cause until you do, it heals all enemies to 100%, it takes 2-3 turns to get to it and smash, can't hit from range i think - so you have to do nothing for 3 turns, then after that, your tank is stuck behind 5 enemies, trying to not die, and cause of the stupid sight lines (if there's any person inbetween, there might as well be a brick wall) you can't heal them without moving pretty close - also that was maybe the 5th fight without resting, so you have to use mana pots to get mana back (there's a healer for hp), which ofc there's not an infinite supply of!
UH - i long for a PF 2e RPG game where every fight is winnable without having to do it a few times and it's not possible to build so badly you're bad at combat!

I wanted to like this game.

Unfortunately the game is making it impossible for me to. First a little background information: I know nothing about the system this game is based on. I do enjoy playing tactical RPGs, usually playing on hard mode in most.

First let me list what I like about the game:
- Save system is good, frequent auto saves and battle restart option give you the ability to combat bad RNG
- I like the system used and the gameplay mechanics in general
- Difficulty can be adjusted on the fly
- The story seems decent, though I didn't get very far (played up to the second arena)

And of course, it being by Daedelic made me give the game a try multiple times, uninstalling and reinstalling 4 times in total.

So why don't I like it?
Well, mostly it comes down to a few points that make the game impossible to play:
- First and foremost, most things aren't described, aren't described in detail, described wrong or not completely.
- The game does not forgive mistakes easily. Because there is not respec function you better hope that you luck out on spending your AP.

Mostly it's these two points. So what's the problem with that?
Let me give you some examples:
You're building your hero. You want to make some kind of mage and take abilities that you think are going to be useful. But wait, how would you know which abilities are going to be useful straight away and which ones aren't? There is no way to know what you're going to be facing early on so the first instinct is to be prepared for anything, right? Dead wrong. From what I've read in a few forum posts you *have* to spec into a few optimized skills, ignoring most of the character sheet in favour of ultra-specialized roles. Alright, so you've started a game, found out all of your half-assed skills are usless, and make another character with a few strengths. The first few battles go great, you've done it.
But wait, I get a new character that has the exact same spells already leveled? Congratulations, you have wasted most of your hero's (or new companion's) AP on having duplicate spells and have to start over to avoid that. I guess I was only about half an hour to an hour into the game at that point, not as bad. Since we already get a mage and a fighter archetype, I know, let's make a rogue!
But... you've guessed it, you'll get a better one down the line, making you have duplicate spells and abilities again. Oh well, not too bad, you can always use more arrows in the air.
But oh no! Now you're fighting a series of close-quarters battles in tight arenas with no usable terrain where your archers immediately get hunted down in melee or burst by mages! If only I'd made a second melee character instead.

See a pattern? This is how it goes through the whole game; ""If only I'd known the next combat is going to have enemies that have limitless knock-down attacks! If only I'd known the next combat has tons of enemies with poison! If only I'd known if the next area required me to speed across the whole map in a turn or two!""

This game requires you to already know exactly the details of what the game is going to look like before you play. There is no interesting decision-making, foreshadowing or information gathering, you're just expected to *know* when to rest, when you'll get healed for free, when you have time to rest between combats and when you don't, what enemies you're going to face in what battlefield yada yada yada yada.

Add to that that most of the character sheet is made up of abilities you absolutely must not take (on account of them being fairly useless) and half of them not saying what they do exactly?

This game needed:
- An enzyclopedia on how everything works *in detail* (not the brief introduction you get with that one weirdly long text window you can open,)
- Much more detailed and many more tooltips
- The ability to spec your party members when you get them to suit a role you haven't already filled
- Actual details in the detailed battle log
- The ability to gather information about upcoming battles/enemies so you don't have to ""scout"" ahead using save games

I don't use guides for video games; I expect them to be balanced in a way where you can gain all required insights in the game to be adequatly prepared for the challenges ahead. I don't like meta-dicerolls if the abilities you picked are actually going to be useful.

So as I see it, this game can only be played with a guide, or with luck, or on easy mode. I don't enjoy the game on easy mode (because all it seems to do is lower enemy health so the enemies fall over after you look at them funny) and I don't enjoy reloading the game a thousand times because a critical spell or ability failed/some enemy managed to knock down a character until you get all the important dice rolls you need.

So, if you enjoy being challenged on your ability to snuff out the path ahead, enjoy a story line while being challenged tactically and tend to play games once only, play something else instead.

Added on top is the terrible probabilities, which vary wildly, often for no apparent reason, and straight up don't work out at all. This makes every fight a chore. An obstacle to be shoved out of the way, so you can finally make some progress. There is also the lack of truly interesting environmental effect and the visual aesthetic of the scenes being (at best) generic as hell. In terms of such effects, some are extremly disabling, if you don't have the correct skill on a high enough level, or straight up laughable, because you cannot use it properly in the heat of battle or it is completely ineffective to do so. 
On the other hand, it tries to be a sprawling fantasy epic, using the world and lore of the German TTRPG system as the backdrop. Characters talk a lot and then some, while never having an actual point to make. Their motivations are interesting in the abstract, a mage hoping to be more than he is born into, a dwarf serching for companionship after being pushed away by his own family (as examples), but don't amount to anything more than this very literal reading. They're static and have no push and pull with the antagonistic forces, because those are simply evil cultist eviling for evil purposes. As a small spoiler: There is a powerful litany of the nameless god involved, while some political struggles relate to this - allegedly.
The skirmishes are lacking in options, have some truly unfair and terrible design to them, while the plot is so convoluted, it manages to lose its way a few times with an unmotivated ending.

В первые часов 10 игра прям затягивала, было интересно знакомится с механикой, прокачивать героев дальше интерес явно падает. Игра превращается в скучное хождение по карте с стремлением набрать как можно очков опыта. 
Игру прошел почти 2 раза. Первый раз дошел до последней главы и понял, что зафейлил сохранение и безбожно раз за разом продувал дальнейший бой. Бросил, но не совсем.
Спустя пару лет вспомнил что не закрыл таки эту игру. Скачал, установил, и снова, то самое сохранение... Начал заново...

Уже со знанием дела прокачал героев играть стало полегче и приятнее, но после середины игры запал пропал и тупо допинывал до финала...

Теперь немного о игре.

Пошаговая RPG  на основе D&D. Вся механика построена на механике D&D с кубиками и прочими модификаторами. Все разнообразие оружия по факту фигня. При нормальной прокачке бить будешь примерно одинаково что с факелом что с топовым мечем. вся штука в везении. очень часто все зависит от рандома и это не приятно.
Под конец долгие муторные и однообразные битвы сильно надоедают. Если пропускать квесты очень может случиться вариант, что финальную стадию вывезти не получится в принципе. 
Учитывая количество игроков с ачивкой пройденной игры очень многие скорее всего ее забросили.

Игра зайдет любителям жанра, но особо ничем выдающимся похвастаться не может.
Итог 5/10 

З.Ы, под конец самая положительная эмоция это удаление этого продукта с чувством завершенного дела)

I mean, I get it. Basically an interruption to your goals to play a game within a game, complete with a mini progress to success. Really cool idea. You are stripped of all your items, weapons, and armor and thrown against other gladiators in combat for your freedom. Now you gotta learn how to wield a club and fight with your hands to survive.

But...

Instead of having the same limits as your equally enslaved opponents and the tactics that entails, you wind up against opponents that can do things you can't do. Like drink healing potions and lose arrows at far more range. You'll have a guy surrounded, pounding away with all your limited might while he literally drinks potion after potion. All this appears to be so the experience is drawn out longer. How does healing yourself as a gladiator even fit the fantasy? I could have drummed on with this and googled the solution, but it just got too boring to care. It was a cool idea, but I don't think the devs were all that excited about it. It just felt like filler to me.

Could have been really cool, though. Simple tactical battles with simple weapons, no heals, no magic, and no gross advantages to overcome. And once freed, you would have all those extra melee skills to brag about.",1640375803,1640375803,False,6,0,0.595113873481750488,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1.Oyunun yapısı ve karakter çeşitliliği oldukça fazla 3 tane karakter çeşitliliği var ama silah çeşitliliği fazla olduğu için karakterlerinizi nasıl oynatacağınıza kararı en güzel şekilde verebilirsiniz
2.Oyunun hikayesi ve yan görevleri oldukça uzun oyunu oynarken yan görevlere kıymet vermeniz gerekiyor gelişimize oldukça faydası olacak
3.Oyundaki npclerde güçlü silah oluşumu olmuyor bu yüzden yan görevlerden karakterler için npclerde olmayan güzel silahlar çıkıyor bu da karakterinizin en iyi şekilde gelişmesine katkı sağlıyor kesinlikle yan görevleri yapın
4.Oyunda bazı noktalarda karakterlerin oyundaki hayatları için kararları siz veriyorsunuz buna dikkat edin çünkü kararı verdiğiniz kişi bir eğitmen ise o zaman bazı büyüleri öğrenme şansını kaybedersiniz
5.Oyundaki görevlerde bazen ipuçları olmuyor bunları şehirleri gezerek ve her npc ile konuşarak edinebilirsiniz yani aa sinyal yok görev nerde diye düşünmeyin npcler ile konuşun yada zamanı gelmemiştir
6.Oyundaki skil darağacı için skilleride eğitmenlerden öğreniyorsunuz ve hem de her silahla her skini kullanamazsınız balta ile güçlü vuruş vururken mızrak ile güçlü vuruş vuramazsınız karakterınızın silahına ona göre dikkat edin
7.Oyunda başarım kasmak zor yani bu yüzden başarımlara odaklı oynamayın cunku bazı başarımlar bugta kalmış ben 4 tane başarımı ne yapsam alamadım açıklamasını yapmama rağmen bu yuzden buglu başarımlar takılmayın bence buglu olanlar
simyacıdan 50 nesne al
savas içinde 3 silah değiştir
1 karakter ile 4 pot kullan
1 karakter ile 4 zehir kullan
8.Her karakter her yaratığa zarar veremiyor mızrak kullanan bir karakteriniz varsa iskeletlere zarar veremiyor buna bildiğim örnekler ile başlayım
a.Ejderha ateş büyüsü olan silahtan ve ateşten zarar görmüyor
b.iskelet mızraktan ve hancerden zarar görmüyor aksine büyü saldırıları ve ♥♥♥♥♥ saldırılar çok vuruyor
c.örümcek zehir büyüsü olan silahtan ve zehir büyüsünden zarar görmüyor
bu gibi örnekler çoğaltılabilir
9.Silahlara büyüyü simyacıdan aldığınız nesneleri kullanarak işliyorszunuz haberiniz olsun bir iki silah hariç doğrudan büyülü silah kazanamazsınız bu yuzden aldığınız zehri ve alevi silahlara kullanın
10.Oyunun hikayesi uzun ve yan görevleri detaylı ve güzel
11.Oyunda türkçe çeviri oldukça güzel ve etkileyici

However, the game balance, that is at first passable, devolves into absolute crapfest by the second half of the game and turns most end-game encounters into patience-testing slogs which have nothing to do with skill or tactical thinking as the game showers you with infinite battles with respawning enemies, mini-boss spam, several repeated major bosses and a slew of other annoyances - minor to major.

The game is lauded as complex by the developers and some players, but it really is not, aside from some aspect of skill management. No combos - magical or otherwise, no bonuses for positioning in combat, for flanking or surrounding and a couple abusable skills that allow you, for example: to stun enemies for double digit number of rounds, giving you ample time to regenerate mana and just permastun enemies - or for them to permastun you. There isn't much tactics at play, aside from basics, and its a damn shame especially because the enemy AI is actually surprisingly good, it mostly positions well and can easily surround and pick off single heroes if you give it an opening, it can abuse some of the broken spells as well. With proper balance and more tactical options, it could genuinely prove to be a fun challenge, but with the limited scope of the game's combat, it's held back a lot and only shows glimpses of brilliance here and there.

In regards to spells, the game has a decent selection, though a bit unimaginative, but equipment selection is very poor, and even the ""legendary"" pieces you will find here and there are very bland and just stats+ with nothing special going for them.

If you can get the game for very cheap on a sale and manage your expectations, the first 3 acts of the game will be mostly fun - I'd say somewhere around 6-7/10. From act 4 onwards, things will spiral out of control, and though there were some decent encounters still, there were many very bad ones to counter tham - and they were very, very bad. I didn't actually finish the game, because the last ""run"" towards the last boss is just so bad, I just gave up. It would have probably taken me about 5 more hours to finish the game, if you want an estimate, and I played on the default difficulty (medium/normal I think).

Also, as cherry on top, the game is pretty poorly optimized - while, due to the nature of the game, it has very little impact on the gameplay, it is still pretty noticeable and annoying when your frames randomly, but repeatedly, drop by 20, even when nothing special is happening.",1634074542,1634074542,False,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Pros:
- I received it as a gift
- interesting leveling system

The Cons:
- horrible controls (circle menus)
- the unpolished visuals are okay for a TBS game, but all the cut zoom in and are painfull to watch
- I witnessed several 100% hit chance attacks miss
- some fights reveal their winning condition after 2 turns
- some of the achievements are either broken or the description is bad, so doing what the achievement sais won't lead to getting it
- most of the achievements feel dumb and require a very bad playing style. For example: Having one character who is mediocre at all fighting skills does not make any sense in a party based RPG!
- the game punished me hard for not understanding all mechanics during character creation. For story telling reasons, it works with flashbacks, in which you play your protagonist as you created them. All the flashback scenes where painfull for me to play, since I learned the mechanics during the first hours of gameplay and not before

geschrieben im August 2021

Ich empfinde Blackguards als deprimierendes Spiel, zum Ende hin quälte ich mich durch dieses.

Die größten Ärgernisse waren für mich die mieserable Auswahl bei den Händlern ( kaum Rüstungen und es wird nichts nachproduziert, hatte immer mal keine Pfeile mehr ), das man zu Hiebwaffen gezwungen wird ( Skelette und viele andere erhalten keinen Schaden durch Schwerter/Speere, könnte Dolche ja verstehen, aber Schwerter? ), nicht genug Hotkeys, ärgerliches Kreismenü der Charaktere, schlechte Kämpfe. Keine Möglichkeit durch Zufallsereignisse irgendwo Erfahrungspunkte zu generieren ( man folgt einfach nur der Geschichte ). Dazu ein vorgegebenes Team. Nur der Hauptcharakter kann selber erstellt werden. Achja die ungenaue Steuerung im Kampf, der Mauszeiger wechselt immer wieder mal zwischen Boden und dem Gegner, der auf dem Boden steht hin und her.
Ausserdem sind weiterhin viele Errungenschaften verbuggt. Hatte mit dem Hauptcharakter 20 Mut ( 18 +2 durch Schwert ), Errungenschaft wurde nicht freigeschaltet, selbst nicht dann, als ich den Mut durch einen Trank für einen Kampf auf 30 steigerte.

Dazu ist die Geschichte nicht die beste und die Präsentation derselben gefällt mir auch nicht.

Durchschnittlich ist die Musik, die Grafik veraltet, bekam aber keinen Augenkrebs.

Was fand ich in diesem Spiel also gut?
Die traurige Antwort ist, ausser dem erstellen des Hauptcharakters irgendwie gar nichts.

Ich gebe dem Spiel hier mit viel Wohlwollen gerade 52%.

Für mich sind gute DSA PC-Spiele nur :

Von der Nordlandtrilogie das uralte Dos Spiel : Die Schicksalsklinge ( DSA 1 )
Weiter dann zu Drakensang
Und Drakendang - Am Fluss der Zeit

Alle anderen kann ich leider nicht empfehlen.

В нее интересно играть, следить за сюжетом и выстраивать/билд менеджмент героев. 
Квесты - сюжетная линия интересная, действия происходят в необычных локациях и с разными противниками, множество побочных квестов которые можно как пропустить (не найти) или просто в диалоге отказаться от них. 
Мостры/Противники - их не так много, но битвы и встречи с ними выстроены так, что ты этого не замечаешь. И только после прохождения задумываешься, что их было не так то и много.
Диалоги - интересные и присутствует небольшой выбор решений (подкупить/пройти с миром или поступить как Гном!) (Русский перевод слегка коряв и пара фраз не переведены, но играть можно)
Геймплей - Радует огромное количество заклинаний(и их уровней), большой выбор оружия и брони, множество расходным материалов(зелья,ловушки,яды. Но по большей степени они для максимальной сложности, на других сложностях ты о них не вспоминаешь)
[b]Что не понравилось? [/b]
В игре из главного героя можно сделать любой класс - воин/маг/лучник или гибрид всего и понемногу, но с 2 акта игра тебе как бы намекает - [spoiler] ""лучше бы тебе быть лучником броооо"" (ведь до окнца игры не будет лучника кроме тебя)  [/spoiler]
игра РПГ - но ты не видишь расстояние (гексы) куда может дойти противник, что очень не удобно. Сложно планировать свои действия и не получить лишний раз по башке. 
Очень неудобное сравнение брони и оружия. Приходится несколько раз сравнивать лучше ли оно, чем тот кусок палена с которым ты бегаешь.
И главный минус - игра у меня просто зависала. (у многих такая проблема) и ее не свернуть, что бы закрыть через диспечер, помогает только перезагрузка или !!!

Very special game. Some love it, some hate it. Very cheap on sale, but at the point that you realize you don't like it, you already lost some precious hours of your life in a frustrated state. If you love it, you can easily live with it's problems and it will be an absolute bargain.

Main problems:
- Ruleset. Intimidating at first. And after some hours, when I know how it all works, I want to build a new character and restart. Possibly great as pen and paper but unnecessarily clunky for a pc game.
- Uneven difficulty: Often very easy, sometimes very hard. I was rarely in my comfort-zone (challenging, but not frustrating)
- Slow pacing (combat itself is quick and has no issues, but I had to keep track about which trainer is where and what does he train. Also, there open up tons of different shops early in the game, everybody sells different stuff. Travelling around a lot is slow due to loading times)
---> RESULT: It needs a lot of dedication for unnecessary reasons

Main Advantages:
- Every combat feels different, challanges offer lots of variation
- A lot of raw content (playtime)
- Every village looks different, nice music, great voice-acting, solid story (no ""find 4 crystals""-shit)
- The way I got loot here was awesome! I got EXACTLY enough to feel progress, but not too much to be oversaturated. I was HAPPY about every coin, every item I found. THIS IS HOW YOU IMPLEMENT LOOT!

I would have enjoyed it much more if they reduced the content by 20% and gave more attention to the remaining 80% (especially getting access to shops/trainers on the overworld map and evening out the difficulty a bit)

Well, less the game and more the battle system it uses alongside some of the allowances the developers created for tactical battles. Part of my problem, however, is that you really need to know what you're doing to create effective characters that don't 'waste' xp on crap.

Another issue, is that no one in America really has access to the lore of the world of the 'Dark Eye' and its associated connotations. Including the 'grim dark' elements that pop up pretty quickly.

My last issue, however, is the story. The overarching elements are great, but the details are shit. The implementation is shit, and if we're really playing the evil/bad guys as a great many of the quests and title push for, there aren't enough evil options. Including the equivalent of deliberately knocking people out to send them (sell them) to the arena among other options.

My advice to the developers: Work on Blackguards 3, in the process overhaul everything including adding an in game weapon tab so that you can see how a weapon is affected by strength. When making Blackguards 3, come back to this game and 2, interconnect them, add further options like choosing to fight your way out of being turned into a slave (as killing off Niam should always be the bad route and not actually part of the base story), and just generally make a wholly good game rather than use cheap and crappy story tricks to try and add emphasis on your world being grim dark, cheap, and edgy (I mean, really, half the reason why people even like Niam is because she gets 'Move like Lightning' long before you ever find a teacher for that absurdly powerful spell).

I'd also recommend elaborating on the MC's history with Lysander and making it so that he genuinely hates the MC for Eleanor deciding he was a love interest. Hell, I'd even recommend the first branch of the 'alternate' story being the player getting 'killed' by the wolf for refusing to fight it and waking up in prison regardless.

Also, it might be a good idea for you guys to hook up with the 'realms of arkania' remix group and work alongside each other. They work on the non-combat elements of the game with their engine, while your engine/layout is used for the combat segments.",1627366168,1627366168,False,5,0,0.574495315551757813,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On a small level, this makes basic tasks like comparing weapons more tedious than they should be. On a larger level, it makes building suboptimally a much easier mistake to make. For example, you can place up to 18 points into any spell or non-weapon talent. However, there are only 4 discrete levels for any spell; if the spell only levels up after 8 points, there is no point in putting any resources into it until you can afford the full 8 points, otherwise you've simply wasted the experience.

Building suboptimally is lethal in this game. You've lost before combat has started. This, combined with the inability to respec and the aforementioned poor communication with the player, is why I think the reviews that tell you to treat each combat like a puzzle to be solved rather than a fight to be rolled first try are misguided. Yes, it is true that you can fail a level due to poor strategy, only to ""figure it out"" for the second go and perform much better. However, it is also possible that you've simply loaded the level with a build that cannot hope to win without a significant amount of RNG. In a true puzzle game, solving a level you've been stuck on for many attempts is satisfying, you think ""Aha! That's what I was doing wrong!"" Sometimes you get that from Blackguards, but sometimes it's just ""Finally, I got the rolls I needed to get past this garbage."" 

Those of you who are familiar with turn-based tactics games may be drawing the connection to games like XCom and Darkest Dungeon, which are also frequently criticized as RNG-heavy. I would argue that these games provide far more consistent options to the player. Pretty much every spell in Blackguards has a %chance to fail, including those that don't target the enemy like healing spells and buffs. Compare with the aforementioned games, which at the very least provide limited sources of consistent damage or healing in the form of consumable grenades and dedicated healers. Even curing debuffs is RNG-based: my mage's poison cure spell had only a 60% chance of success, and the ability to cure wounds (which are also incurred randomly from regular attacks) with a bandage is also seemingly random. My friend once joked that XCom should feature a random chance to randomly trip and fall when you move one of your soldiers—Blackguards pretty much has that too, in the form of terrain hazards like pools of water you can slip on or swamp holes you can be completely immobilized in for several turns. In one particularly egregious example one of my characters spawned in a corner separated by a running stream, then slipped and fell as I tried to make her cross, then fell again on the very next tile as I tried to get her away! I'm sure an optimal build will mitigate some of these chances, through levelling up weapon skills to increase chance to hit, and Body Control to prevent some of these knockdowns, and whatever you level up to increase the success rate of the best spells, but playing blind was a fairly miserable experience at points.

The level design highlights the weaknesses in the progression and combat systems. If your party isn't optimally built, the levels that randomly take away your gear or party members are going to be brutal difficulty spikes. If you didn't know to get Perception levelled up enough before a level with lots of invisible traps, prepare to savescum: they don't move between reloads, so rather than an interesting point of strategy, they become a minor nuisance and a source of tedium. That's pretty much my biggest complaint with the game as a whole, there's so much emphasis on optimizing character sheets that the game's challenges stop feeling like actual tactical gameplay and more like stat checks. What's the point of having five pages of numbers to play around with if you're at such a handicap for picking anything than what's optimal?

There are also a few technical problems with the game, ranging from minor bugs like characters T-posing in the background of cutscenes to very annoying ones like the save button being unresponsive and the game crashing after alt-tabs.

I want to like this game, there are genuinely interesting elements to it, but my experience thusfar is that it simply is not a fun game. If I choose to pick this up again, it will be with a build guide—I suggest you do the same if you choose to play this.",1627336558,1627336558,False,4,0,0.540607333183288574,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Each spell has its governing attributes usually 3 attributes turns out the destruction spells i choose one of the attributes was to low and because of that i could barely cast spells after tons of grinding and getting the AP i started to level those stats and finally my casting percentage started to increase FINALLY!!! or so i thought NOPE!!!! BIG NOPE!!!! the game has no clue what 50% or 95% means is just a number turns out casting spells with higher % it as bad as lower % you miss the same or even worst you cast the spell and does diddly squat. After few hours started to realize it was not getting any better. the % was increasing which made the miss even more spectacular. Get hawkeye on my archer and +5 damage on one turn and does an WHOPPPING 3 damage .... or 95% of shooting with success it does and does no damage.

Понравилось: 
- Пошаговость боев; 
- Сетап героев-нпс; 
- Сюжет в целом; 
- В особенности сюжет некоторых квестов; 
- Музыкальная составляющая; 
- Сеттинг игры; 
- Большая часть организации игрового процесса (как выглядят города, передвижение по карте, на локациях, стиль боевой карты и вот это вот всё). 

Не понравилось: 
- Сильная линейность - спотыкаешься на одном из стартовых квестов, и вместо того, чтобы обойти его, подкачаться и вернуться, долбишься в него, ибо подкачиваться и обходить негде. 
- Резкая скачковая вариация между легкими и тяжелыми боями в процессе игры. Скачет туда-сюда, мне больше по душе плавность. Но - этого вопроса бы не было, если бы не пункт выше - будь возможность обойти неудобный на данном этапе момент и докачаться на условных кабанчиках, вообще было бы норм. 
- Есть пара очевидных имба-билдов. Будь они просто чуточку сильнее, вопросов бы не было - быть чуть слабее, как плата за комфорт в качестве игры тем, кто тебе нравится, это нормально. Но там прям пропасть.

You *will* fail some fights the first time, as you will have to discover strategies and some ""puzzles"" so-to-speak (traps on maps, etc.).  That said, I always succeeded my second attempt much more easily.  There is a sweet Retry button, which makes the pain sting less.  

Still, if you do not feel like getting kicked brutally between the legs while playing a game, I really do not recommend you start this game.  It is important for your enjoyment and frustration management that you know this in advance. 

In the final stage of Chapter 2 (out of 5 chapters), I was considering giving up; which I generally do not.  And that is after spending hours viewing guides and videos to make my character builds decent.  But builds do not cut it: you need to try, fail, and find a new tactic.  It turned out the final fight of Chapter 2 was actually easy once you understand the ""puzzle"". 

[h2]Combat and difficulty : bloody hard by design ![/h2] 
One could say it is unforgiving, but in truth :
1) fights are designed to be challenging and risky, but winnable.  It is *not* a design flaw nor chaotic: this adventure rarely gives you easy fights.  So you really have to pay attention to what skills/spells you level.  
2) when you win a battle, your companions have not died, and healing Wounds is not very hard (low cost in a town, spells, Treatment skill) ;
3) there is always a nice Retry button (with an autosave before each fight). 

The two first chapters are rather hard as your characters are gaining skill and spells.  You gain Adventure Points (similar to XP) somewhat slowly.  So take the time to look at the skill choices and focus.  

[h2]RPG aspects[/h2]
While the main story is very linear, you have side-quests that offer dialogue choices and you can travel freely between the towns you have already visited (for gear, training, etc.).  The game is more of a tactical challenge rather than deep in story choices.  Yet some dialogue choices can have a consequence near the end...

The progression system is based on the Dark Eye (L'Oeil Noir) tabletop RPG system.  This is both a good and bad thing.  The good is that you have a lot of options and flexibility, and you must choose what you will focus in along the way.  The bad is that this tabletop system is convoluted (not user-friendly).  For example, you start with 10000 AP and you can spend points freely in the many attributes, weapons, talents, spells and abilities.  Instead of having a potion say it gives +4 to Parry & Dodge, it will say +20 Agility for example. 

While there are no classes, you must choose at the start if you will have access to spells.  Being able to use spells cost about 500 or 700 AP (out of 10K).  You will have one or two companions who can do magic, so it is really a free choice, but I recommend your main character have the magic option open (Mage).

On the other hand, you can pick one of the three presets (Hunter, Mage, Warrior).* 

[h2]Time[/h2]
Most claim to finish the main quest is about 40 hours.  I did ALL the side quests, including the DLC, in 90 hours.

[h2]General Tips[/h2] 

a) Do not try to be good at everything. Having ten spells that you cannot succeed does not help. Having spells with only 50% chance of success will get you killed. Same for choice of weapons.   

b) Some Talents are important for all characters, notably Body Control (resistance to knockdowns) and Willpower (resistance to Wounds).  

c) I found having 3 casters (i.e. making your main character a mage) made the fights much more winnable, but you can do fine with 2 mage companions.  As you wish, but magic can turn enemies against each other, create an illusionary duplicate, heal Wounds, etc. I also found giving ranged weapons to my mages was efficient and sometimes crucial (bows and crossbows are powerful in this game).  Instead of using ""mana"" (Astral points) to do a damage spell, you can do a better average with a bow and keep your ""mana"" for much more tactical spells.  Some poisons will drain your ""mana"", so you need a Plan B weapon. 

d) The Talent Warcraft is excellent on many levels, notably for the capacity to swap weapons freely once your have mastered it. Swapping weapons allows you to adapt damage type or switch to ranged weapons without losing a turn! 

Nb : my main character was a mage focused on healing (removing Wounds and poisons) and buffs (mostly Dodge and Attack bonuses).  Two of your companions are very capable warriors.

I decided on Yes but only if it's on sale, and if the type of gameplay appeals to you.

So here's the deal, the game is advertised like it's an RPG but it's not.   It fundamentally plays like an older FB or Flash game with very set progression and no real choice.  The story is linear and you can only really choose to skip a few optional battles.  But to progress the story/game you have to go through a specific set of battles, each on a specific map and in most cases giving very specific AP (experience) points and items as a reward.   Even the vendors have an exact inventory and never replenish their stock.  

You have a large variety of ways you can configure your character and party to try to win these battles - but that's literally all it is.   It's also easy to screw it up and make it extremely difficult to win a particular battle.  And you have to win to move forward.   You can start the battle over as often as you like, but until you win you can't continue the game.    There's no perma-death either as any of your party that are knocked below zero HP are just disabled until the next battle (although you usually have 3 turns to try to heal them).

So it's more of a tactical combat game on a hex map.   The RNG during battle can be cruel and made me yell at the screen a few times, but if this is your type of game then it can be enjoyed at your own pace.  And the last BIG negative note is that some of the achievements seem to be bugged.

I feel like I've beat up on the game a lot but the story and writing is fun, the voice acting is really good, and it works well as a tactical game.  I certainly put in a fair amount of hours so lots of value if you get it on sale.

I highly recommend reading through the various guides.   It'll help with configuring your party to win/progress with each of the battles as if you're set wrong you'll have to load an earlier save, change a few things/gear, and then do the battle again.    

An Archer/Mage main character is probably the most optimal for getting through all the battles.  Basic tactic is to cast Shadow Clone, then Move like Lighting 3, and then machine-gun everything with Triple Shot between the clone and main.   The Clone starts with the same type (and amount) of arrow your main has equipped but doesn't actually use any of your arrows from inventory.   This is a great way to make use of Arrow Storm on those really large and annoying enemies toward the late game.   You can one-shot some of the worst of them this way.

One last thing is that I don't see any of the guides or posts talk about Magic-Resistance enough.  Your non-spell casters will have tons of AP to spend toward the end and I'd recommend dumping points into MR.  I had the Dwarf up at 27 by the end battles and if you look at the descriptions for many of the area effect damage and de-buff spells they use the HIGHEST MR of the targets to resist.  I looked at the battle log and the toughest enemy spell-casters only had a 5% (absolute minimum) to 19% chance of success for their spells.  Effectively neutralizing some of the worst effects in the game.

Unique leveling system which I'm ok with  outside of the fact that it's really hard to get the HP and MP needed to have long fights.  The coolest part is that every character is what you want it to be. While some come stock with a focus, it's not hard to refocus them.  I'm not a huge magic fan so I'm running with 3 DPS melee and then two archers that can heal. I like it!

По сегодняшним меркам это весьма старая игра. И она точно напрашивается на ремастер, в котором будет использоваться новый движок и совершенно новая, современная графика. Но даже сейчас в своем оригинальном виде это хорошая пошаговая стратегия с простым и понятным сюжетом. Небольшие локации для скоростных сражений не заставят зависать часами в одном замке. Довольно вариативная ролевая система прокачки персонажа позволяющая сделать бойца любого типа и стиля. Сама боевая система, как мне кажется, пришла из Героев Меча и Магии. Графический стиль у проекта не идеальный, но смотрится хорошо. Даже не смотря на злоупотребление блум и блюр эффектами.

Io sono basito. Non è che mi aspettassi chissà che ma le situazioni sono intriganti e ogni missione ha un qualcosa che sorprende piacevolmente. Se una narrazione magari semplice mi spinge comunque a voler continuare la trovo una missione compiuta.
In quanto alla grafica non capisco a cosa la gente sia abituata, è OTTIMA e perfettamente funzionale. E' tutto 3D ma a telecamera fissa (puoi solo inclinare) e nelle città è bloccata fissa.
Scelta che, spiegavano, permette di concentrarsi sull'immersione ed evita lo spaesamento di dover andare fisicamente nei negozi tipo Skyrim.

This game kind of feels like old-school Amiga-RPG with better graphics etc. Blackguards 2 seems much more accessible than this so I'd recommend that before this to less-hardcore players. However, I was stuck with this for a long time because I wanted to finish it before playing 2. It feels like a mistake almost to be a completionist with this. 

Basically the game is 'just' battles with some pretty repetitive pictures of towns as the inventory and character development screen. The characters' leveling up skills and attributes is  pretty unique and I kind of liked it when I finally understood it but most of the time it felt vague and confusing.

Battles usually have lots of puzzle element in the tactics and they might feel unfair and even impossible at first (on medium difficulty) but there's usually a catch in how to even the odds (there's some really difficult ones still!), for example you need to use objects found in the environment or you learn the weaknesses of enemies and soon it's possible. There's some epic battles that I still remember (swamp spirit plant!) but I also remember the annoying repetition: even in the last battles you fight such boring beasts as skeletons, zombies and ghouls. Feels like grinding a lot when there aren't any interesting attacks or new monsters to see. The variety of weapons and armor feels quite limited too compared to most RPGs I've played. 

The story is not very important but it's ok. However it's disappointing if you expect too much from the progression of the game and I felt even betrayed at times when the quest didn't affect almost anything. Characters are memorable because of the voice acting.

I believe I finished every quest in Blackguards and the DLC. But still wasn't sure of my chances in the last dungeon that you can't escape to main map even when it's the longest and one of the most tedious ones. I recommend easy difficulty to avoid such feelings. 

Music and some of the town graphics are beautiful and create great atmosphere but it's just broken promises: there isn't anything deep beyond it and besides the battles that offer deep thinking and sometimes frustration. I'd rate this game 2,5 / 5.",1618169141,1618169141,True,1,0,0.499704301357269287,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I am 43.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1617295394,1617295394,True,6,1,0.360643148422241211,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Blackguards (2014) к большому удивлению в меру хороший проект, с множеством интересных решений, которые особенно сильно придуться по душе любителям настольных игр.

По базису это не слишком запутанный фэнтезийный мир, в котором есть все стандартные атрибуты любой RPG фэнтезийного жанра. С другой же стороны, все представленное нисколько нельзя назвать оригинальным: от города к городу берем и выполняем квесты; прокачиваем героев; а после проходим на пошаговую карту, и раз за разом используем вариативный арсенал.

К тому же это крайне не интуитивная игра, подобно Diablo II (2000) запороть персонажей очень просто, а сражения практически всегда зависят от грамотной позиционки и тактического использования ресурсов. Предложенные инструменты для создания героев преобладают не слишком гибкой вариативностью, но достаточной для того чтобы игровой процесс в меру затягивал.

Однако несмотря на прогрессию продвижения возможностей героев, как правило игровой процесс остатется таковым же в течении долого периода не предлагая новых механик, что безусловно в какой-то момент сильно отталкивает.

Тем же кто любит жанр пошаговых сражений и мудренную комплексную прокачу, данная игра способна захватить на множество часов, потому дать шанс и сыграть в демо версию игры это Ваш выбор.

So it's not really a safe genre for game making and the reason why we are seeing less and less of this genre nowadays... the word ""SLG"" is not even heard of for a lot of newer game players. Mainly because this genre being invented by the Japanese to compete with the up rising trend of RTS back in the days. And most players often mix the 2 together for comparison while they are actually both completely different game play.

SLG's game play idea is a basic old school JRPG game skill set mixed with a Chess Board game. It's a game that gives you all the time to wait and implement your moves (just like the Chess) while RTS is real time and more exciting in a way to some players. So ""Strategy"" has been divided into 2... SLG isn't really widely accepted even in Japan, as most preferred RTS, and the trend actually being picked up by Taiwan back then and caused a bloom there, due to their love of chess in the culture.

With that said... If you like Chess board game, be it Japanese/Chinese/International (aka Western) Chess or even Checker, then SLG is probably something you can swallow and looks good on your plate. For players who hated chess... well SLG probably has all the reasons you hated Chess there.

SLG used to be my favorite food until i can't find anyone selling it anymore... until Final Fantasy Tactic set another bloom of this genre and finally crack its way into the west... even still... there's chess lover and hater so yeah... these type of games often ended up with mixed rating not because of the game but preferences of the player. One who enjoyed Chess can enjoy a SLG game even without a story base. One who can't simply won't enjoy it at all no matter how good the story is.

For Blackguard... as a hexagon SLG game.. this is to be expected... but... setting that aside... the game still has its own problem. (Comparing to other SLG)

The tactic battle are great and challenging. A real fun for chess lover. But the rest of the game is a bit shabby... like the old trend of SLG, devs like adding branches in story to let the players replay the game adding replayability (replay value) to their game. but those are branching up to different battles and different story time line... Blackguard couldn't grab hold the of the concept and the whole story and quest line is messy. They even have unfixed bug after all these years.. and bug that's intolerable like a future dialog popping up and become a spoiler before you even started the quest. (eg. the carpenter)

And this game is walking on tightrope under a fan base title of the ""Dark Eye"" series... so it attracts fan no matter the genre of the game and those who doesn't like chess will just hate.
For SLG lover, the implementation of the Dark Eye dice roll system (similar to D&D) is another burden as the whole chess battle become unstable over RNG stuffs, like playing chess moves and throwing dices at the same time every turn. Not a good mix if they want to really bring the true fun of SLG to their player... plus.. Dark Eye rules is based on 5 characters. So we only get 5 max all the way in the game. While other SLG provide an army of selection to fully utilize our tactical needs. So yeah, this game has it's limits and can't provide the same fun as other SLG games imo... But they did cover up with stage planning and all making it challenging and fun so it's still worth the buy... but will i call it a top SLG game? No. Because too much depends on Luck makes this more of a gambling game than strategy game. The stages are fun but the links between the stages are a mess, makes this game looks more like a ""testing prototype"" of a game idea.",1614493222,1614780670,True,5,0,0.560039639472961426,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If there is one thing Drakensang did RIGHT was how open, deep and complex characters' customization was. The truth is, no matter how many tried to clone Drakensang (especially River of Time), nobody ever could. Your options were literally limitless; you could be a ninja who'd cast Fire Spells, a Sorceress so tanky she could take down a whole golem, a ranger who would just instantly flip out on you and swiftly brings you down with a two-melee weapons wield... Plus, the story was quite nice; it was new back then to drop the ""Chosen One"" bomb on your created character and have these greatly written NPCs follow you to glory. Let's talk about Blackguards now. You get the gothic feel of Drakensang games and all that jazz, except the battles do not happen in real time (as is the case in Drakensang games) but when there's a battle coming up, you're taken to the GRID TACTICAL COMBAT SCREEN. Let me tell you, you will fail, miserably and countless times... and it certainly doesn't help anyone's case that there isn't any ""Speed Up"" option you can activate through the menu screen... So if you lose a battle, which will probably happen many, many times, you have to sit through tedious enemy movements again... and again... and again... until somehow, the RNG God smiles upon you and you land a spell. Let's talk storyline; this is your typical ""chosen hero"" tale that you probably know all too well by now; the dialogue is completely voiced and voice acting is actually quite good for an Indie game. The characters are likeable, but not permanent (Try not to equip anyone with high-end gear until the last chapter). Some characters WILL die, some WILL leave and the only person you can rely on is yourself (almost like in real life). You can be one of three MAJOR classes, that are customizable in the way I stated above! You can be a ninja who casts spells, or a dual-wielding druid; it is ALL up to you. Mechanics-wise, this game is RUTHLESS but for all the wrong reasons: Spells getting miscast at 100% success rate, enemies literally cheating (some carnivorous plants will knock out your heroes despite having a resist check of 100%), the same AP system in Drakensang for leveling up applies here but not tuned and all over the place etc... The graphics are also not THAT good and the side quests do little to provide a sense of understanding for this world or how it's become this gloomy.

All in all, this is a great Tactical RPG that relies heavily on RNG sometimes. Other times it feels so unfair you think about dropping it, yet will indubitably keep playing. The bugs that plague Steam achievements for this game are ridiculous, so if you're one of those Achievement Hunters you might want to steer clear as some achievements will unlock for some players, but not all players. I guess I'm one of the lucky few who unlocked those achievements early in the game by means of outsmarting the game's code, but more on that in the discussions.

Blackguards is a cRPG / strategic turn based combat game with the emphasis very much towards the strategic turn based combat rather than cRPG elements of the game.  Blackguards is a okay to good game that could have been an excellent game but is ruined by a few exceedingly poor decisions on the part of the developers.

1:  Linked combats with no opportunity to manually save between then.  (If you get hammered in the second fight of a set of three and you have to play the whole lot again.  The game autosaves after each section and as you got hammered in the second fight the autosave the game takes is useless to you.)
2:  Far too much use of poison.  (Seems to be used as a cheap way to increase monster damage and makes the Clarum Purum spell essential.)
3:  Some fights are just too long (1-2 hours for a single fight).

Overall definitely worth picking up despite the issues.  Pricing is pretty competitive anyway but watch out for offers.

LONG REVIEW.
Blackguards is a cRPG / strategic turn based combat game with the emphasis very much towards the strategic turn based combat rather than cRPG elements of the game.  Blackguards is a okay to good game that could have been an excellent game but is ruined by a few exceedingly poor decisions on the part of the developers

PLOT:  The plot is reasonable but is extremely linear.  The is one extremely lousy point at the end of Chapter 2 which I won't elaborate on to avoid spoilers.

COMBAT:  Combat is strategic turn based combat and is based on The Dark Eye role playing game (which I am not familiar with).  Overall the combat isn't too bad but it can be a bit slow with some fights taking too long (1-2 hours for a single fight).  There is one really bad thing about combat which is the overuse of poison.  This makes the Clarum Purum spell “essential”.

GRAPHICS & SOUND:  Good, nothing spectacular but more than adequate for the game and quite pleasing.

REPLAY VALUE:  Virtually none.  (Plot is extremely linear.)

ISSUES AND BUGS:  The game runs “straight out of the box” without any difficulties.  It does very occasionally “hang” (I think twice in about 70 hrs of game play) but is pretty stable.  The same cannot be said for the steam achievements which are extremely buggy.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND TRADING CARDS:  There are achievements and trading cards for those interested but the steam achievements which are extremely buggy and tend not to trigger when they should.. There is a reason for the low completion rate on a lot of the achievements in this game, Top of the Food Chain, Iron Bladder, Hand of Boron, Three times the Fun, Traveller, Red Salamander and A True Stoerrebrand are all know to be buggy, there may be others.

VALUE FOR MONEY:  Pretty good value for money anyway as its competitively priced.  Better price if bundled with Blackguards 2 in the Blackguards Franchise Bundle.  Often gets discounted in sales so watch out for special offers.

In 2 turns, my entire team was not only knocked down, but they were completely unable to get up. so the AI just casually walked around and slaughtered all my characters.

Ja, das Spiel gefällt mir insgesamt sehr gut.
Ich freue mich auf den DLC und den zweiten Teil.
Außerdem werde ich noch einen Durchlauf auf hohem Schwierigkeitsgrad in Angriff nehmen,
weil ich nun weiß, was ich besser machen kann, und gegen Ende viele Kämpfe doch recht leicht waren.

Ich bin riesiger Fan der Original DSA Nordland Triologie aus den 90er Jahren,
und trotzdem finde ich Blackguards großartig.

Ich habe viele Dinge NICHT vermisst:
- fehlgeschlagene Steigerungen
- zerbrechende Waffen
- zerschlissene Stiefel
- zufällige Krankheiten
usw.

Ich habe neben den Kämpfen gern viel Zeit mit Party-Optimierung und Skillplanung verbracht.

Das Kampfsystem finde ich sehr vielseitig und die meisten Talente und Zauber lassen sich sinnvoll einsetzen.
Auch gibt es viele Karten, in denen man mit 08/15 Taktiken nicht weit kommt, und neu denken muss.

Das Setting und die Story finde ich eine schöne Abwechslung.
Das man in einer bösen Welt, immer wieder versucht wird, selbst böse zu sein, oder eben gut und dafür Nachteile zu erfahren hat seinen Reiz.

Nun zu den negativen Dingen.
Den ersten unaufhaltbaren Verlust eines Partymitglieds fand ich überflüssig und unplausibel.
Den zweiten Verlust eines Partymitglieds habe ich auch nicht kommen sehen.
Das hätte man in der Geschichte deutlicher machen können.
Zum Glück lässt sich der Verlust abwenden, wenn man noch ein passendes Savegame hat, und Dinge anders entscheidet.

Die Interaktion zwischen den Partymitgliedern hätte deutlich ausgebaut werden können.
Wenn sie nämlich mal stattfindet, fand ich das höchst unterhaltsam.

Dass Einsteiger und Casual-Gamer mit dem Spiel nicht richtig warm werden, verstehe ich.
Hier hätte ein ausführliches Tutorial sicher geholfen.
Die Beschreibungstexte von Zaubern und Talenten fand ich ok, aber man muss dazu Einarbeitungswillen und vielleicht auch Vorwissen mitbringen.
Außerdem hätte man im leichten Schwierigkeitsgrad einen Reskill gestatten können.

Die Kritik am Kampfsystem kann ich nicht nachvollziehen.
Ja, in vielen Kämpfen kommt man mit Standard-Taktiken durch.
Aber bei welchem Strategiespiel ist das denn nicht so?

Gameplay is what you would expect from the screenshots. You more-or-less take the same group of people through 200~ fights, powering them up with experience points and loot. Fights are a hex-based, turn-based affair, you can gain a variety of spells and skills, each with their own uses and drawbacks. 

Character building is interesting in that it's a classless, level-less system. You gain experience points but they don't go into character levels, instead being used directly in improving stats, skills, weapon proficiencies, or gaining perks. The result is a decent amount of freedom in how you build your party. It can potentially be easy to gimp your characters, but I don't know much about The Dark Eye's ruleset and I did just fine making a magic user.

Unfortunately the party lineup is a bit strange, to keep things relatively spoiler-free, your main party will consist of your custom character, two people built for melee and two people built for magic, nobody starting specifically with bows will be in your main group unless you make your custom character that way. Due to the character system its relatively easy to pivot somebody into a ranger but it's still strange. Fortunately even with three mages you can keep things relatively varied due to the number of spells on offer.

Maps and combat scenarios are the game's strong suit. Every map is hand-designed, no random encounters/trash mobs here. There's still a fair number of straightforward ""kill them all"" missions, but there's also a lot of other objectives too. Some are what you would expect like defend the point and cross the map missions, some a little more unique like luring and trapping a great ape in a suspended cage. Even the more straightforward hack and slash maps tend to have things that make them stand out bit, like shooting down beehives to do more damage to the enemy, evening the odds just a bit. A few maps are duds, but the variety in maps, combined with the high difficulty, kept me on my toes for most of the game.

Now for the bad stuff, the story is poor. Proceedings are dragged out by everyone being an idiot, the main characters are less blackguards and more ruffians, and the whole thing just kinda devolves into generic save the world stuff you've seen a hundred times before. Several plot points are underexplained or just outright ignored and the game ends jarringly.

If you want exploration, or really much outside of combat and character building, then there's not much here for you. Most chapters are very linear, with only the third one giving you a decent amount of selection in sidequests. The world map is barebones and towns consist usually of one screen. Dungeons are the same, they're static screens with a few nodes that always contain fights. There's several choices during quests to make throughout the game but only a few have any real impact. If you're a loot-fiend you'll also be disappointed, there's not a lot of unique armor and weapons, and the ones that exist are very strangely placed throughout the campaign. Some characters may go for dozens of hours without an equipment upgrade.

Last, and probably my biggest problem, the combat animations are very slow and you can't speed them up in any way outside of casting a temporary buff to a character's movement range. That sounds petty, but it really is irritating when you can go for minutes without any input just because the 8 slow crocodiles on the map take their time waddling to their chosen spots. Some of the worst maps in the game are that way just because of how long they take due to the animations of (respawning) enemies.

I would recommend Blackguards in the end, it has flaws and is fairly small in scope, but what it focuses on it does well. The game is also dirt-cheap, it regularly goes on sale for under a dollar. Really, what's there to lose at that point?",1608052918,1609483532,True,3,1,0.54666668176651001,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Could have made a review then but will come back to why I didn't later. Blackguards is polarising, as there's certainly a lot of heart in this game, but it has issues. Early game is slow, your characters ineffectual in combat. There are several types of damage in this game and it is tough to know what the cause is when you're hitting for low numbers. Some missions are also frustrating in that you don't know if it is simply you being unlucky or not using the right approach or whether indeed your damage is too low.

I did look up guides on at least two occasions out of complete frustration. Once during the arena with the caimens where the walkthrough video was part of a series by some Czech guy and the other was when I came back to save a maiden and had to pivot what my characters could do. That's another thing. You have these points that you spend on a wide variety of things sure as passive and combat actions, some which effect the world outside of combat. The possibility of spreading a character's points too thin so that they become completely useless in certain situations is all too real. If I had not been saving up my character's points I would have never had enough to make my characters useful. Hint, it was ranged combat.

The worst thing about this game isn't any of that though. The noise for consuming a potion is the most annoying sound you will hear and not a noise anyone would be able to tolerate from any person, say, sitting next to you. The rage inducing gulping is made worse because you've just watched several turns worth of progress evaporate before your eyes and is barely more bearable making your characters use potions. The fact that you can still come back from a foe chugging does teach you to take things a bit slower, but it becomes difficult to truly gauge how strong your characters are when two fights back to back can have such large performance differences with them in how fast a battle goes. This game is also more of a puzzle game sometimes than a rpg, working out the puzzle you didn't know existed all along is interesting...sometimes.

During the midpoint of Chapter 3 I got stuck and didn't want to proceed any further. I left this game alone for nearly FIVE YEARS. Then I came back this November. I was wondering about the story, I wanted to finish it. I could have looked it all up online but decided to give this game another go and glad I did. The character banter is excellently directed and a joy to listen to. The VA's really make the characters feel real and true to themselves. Characters will have conflicting options come up and you can pick them to say something to guide a conversation with an npc. It was nice getting back into that. The playable characters are all full of personality but some performance of more important npcs come across a little flat at times. For bored shopkeepers, disinterested traders and rescued npcs this actually adds some character though and makes the more brightly directed characters stand out a bit more.

Unfortunately a particular party member doesn't seem to have had all the needed lines recorded so just used the default male voice from time to time, which is unfortunate. The further I got the more I was hearing lines I hadn't heard before, and they are infrequent enough so that you're not going to hear a character cry out or laugh at the defeat of their target every single time, which was nice.

After coming back, the further in the game I went, the more the cracks in the game begin to show. NPCs would talk about rewards but I wouldn't receive anything, extremely important information was left to be discovered in the quest log, not told to me as important exposition that the character I was just talking to should have just told me. As far as I'm aware, branching possibilities open up much, much more Chapter 5 onwards. That means you're going to either save at that point and create a whole lot more saves for each branch or replay the game...how many times? Anyway, back to tonight. Or last night, rather.

So on the final mission my party all died. 'Oh well, I wonder if there will be a losing cutscene?' I wondered. And there was.  While neat, I wasn't entirely ready to give up. Unsatisfied, I decided today to go back and do the mission again, shore up a few things and give it another go. Zurbaran got mobbed immediately before he could act and went down. *Restart*. I think it was on the fourth attempt where I managed to win the final mission, which was nice, wasn't actually that hard, but you know what? The cutscene was the same! I'm not angry, just disappointed.

This is a game where you can probably play it once for the story and if you want to see how things might have gone a little differently you can play it again. But a lot of that challenge is random chance and loading screens. While I can't speak for the source material, the world of Blackguards is very interesting and I would be interested in more, only it is a shame to read what happened with the second game. Maybe they did not know what they had. And you might not know what you have, if you don't try out this game. Blackguards as a whole is not greater than the sum of its parts, but those parts can be enjoyable.",1607083150,1607083150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

PROBLEMI:

1. COMPRENSIONE
Il gioco è troppo permissivo e in questo caso è un male non fa capire al giocatore che all'inizio è assolutamente necessario focalizzarsi in 1-2 skill al massimo e un arma.
Se iniziate questo gioco e non lo conoscete finirete per essere costretti a reiniziarlo dopo poco a causa delle scelte sbagliate nel potenziare il personaggio.

2. DIFFICOLTA
Io normalmente gioco a normale o difficile i giochi di strategia ma in questo caso l'ho abbassata a facile... l'esperienza viene diminuita parecchio con la difficoltà e quindi anche meno skill e personalizzaizione, non preoccupatevi per la difficoltà dei combattimenti... alcuni rimarranno difficilissimi e sarete costretti a ritentarli più e più volte, colpa anche delle poche spiegazioni sui nemici  e di un sistema alla D&D incentrato al 99% sulla fortuna più che alla strategia.

3. BILANCIAMENTO
Come in parecchie altre recensioni che ho letto concordo sul fatto che il gioco sia parecchio sbilanciato e snervante e in alcune situzioni troppo demoralizzante peggio di dark souls.
Se avete intenzione di fare il mago sappiate che dovete specializzarvi comunque in un arma per essere un pelino utili in combattimento e non diventare semplici healer inutili quando finisce il mana, e vi consiglio di focalizzarvi solo su incantesimi utili di potenziamento/debilitanti o ad area, gli incantesimi a danno singolo sono inutili, è meglio un arco piuttosto.

A lot of people complained that it's a boring/difficult/soulless game but I think such whiners are better off playing CoD or some other games where they barely have anything challenging to deal with. Storywise the game is also okay nothing great but nothing bad either. But What makes the story interesting is the interactions that these party members they have amongst themselves. Really really enjoyed it(Unfortunately the same level of interaction is almost absent in Blackguards 2). 

Yes, the game can be punishingly difficult at times but to beat this game is not something which isn't possible. And right now at this price it's definitely a buy. 

I hope someday I get to see another Blackguards game in future. My fingers are just crossed.

The game starts up nicely, with good pacing and a mystery murder plot. The first fights are easy, and introduce you to the tactical part of the game. As the story progresses so do your characters, gaining AP that you can spend on many skills. Skills are generally balanced, with some unbalanced spells and abilities. Cities are very generic, and graphically speaking the game is really unimpressive -it's Unity engine after all. Music is allright, with few tracks being really good, like the main theme. The gameplay loop consists of battles->loot and money->buy better armor, find unique weapons->quest->repeat again. At 2/3 of the game i already become bored, because the battles were often similar, similar enemies and you basically max your abilities and spells. So you repeat the same tactics over and over again.This is main reason why i gave negative review -i was forcing myself to end the game, because of this drag. The plot has holes everywhere, just to push the narrative, often with 180 turn.  Voice acting is good, for this kind of budget game. 
Speaking of running the game -the game freezes constantly, unless you add ""-d3d9 -force-gfx-direct"" to startup options. And then it stutters when cutscenes appear, or enemies.

This is probably one of the best tactical RPGs I have ever played, and I am a sucker for turn-based combat. When the developers advertise that there are more than 180 battlegrounds, those are not just empty words. Literally every single fight in the game is handcrafted and to some extend different from the others, including vast diversity of objectives (not just 'slay all the baddies'), twists related to the environment and situations where you have to adapt your strategy to the circumstances. Difficulty levels of this game are peculiar and need to be explained in detail. The major (if not only) difference between difficulty levels is that the higher the difficulty, the less experience points you get. Min-maxing is not my thing, and after realizing I made some questionable choices of skills to upgrade, I downgraded the difficulty to easy - and I recommend to do it if you are not a hardcore gamer. This way, you will not break your characters by poor leveling choices as there are experience points abound. The reason why this is important is that the first few hours are pretty much for experimenting with the character development system, which is quite complex, even overwhelming at first. The curiosity about it is the fact that you have the same XP pool for increasing base values, talents, spells and special skills, so it is quite easy for it to get overwhelming. What I love about this game is that as I progressed, I understood the upgrades better and better, until I was fully comfortable that I knew what I was doing. So if you are repulsed by the character development screen in the beginning, just keep with it - it will hopefully grow on you as it grew on me. Moreover, the characters are likable, the Dark Eye setting (dark fantasy) is a nice touch, there is good variety to inventory and generally I have zero complaints to make about this game. Some folk may probably not like the fact that there is no open world to roam freely. You move between battles on overhead map which has very little visual representation of what's going on. The only thing besides battlegrounds are towns and cities, all of which are static screens with interactive characters and spots - I did not mind that at all. All in all, if you like turn based combat, you owe it to yourself to at least try out Blackguards for a few hours - a first glance is not enough to let this game really shine.",1602657876,1602657876,True,3,1,0.569290518760681152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

O combate por turnos é até descente, e você pode ter uma boa interação com o ambiente, mas tenho a impressão de que as estatísticas são bem bizarras, parecendo sempre estar contra você e a favor dos inimigos, sendo que muitas vezes nenhuma estratégia funciona e você depende do rgn ou do posicionamento inicial do seu grupo, que é completamente troll. Por algum motivo babaca, o jogo coloca todos os seus magos a frente e os guerreiros atrás, e você não tem controle nenhum sobre isso. Os combates ao longo da história também não parecem ter nenhuma progressão, pois as vezes você enfrenta uma batalha que deveria ser difícil mas é fácil em um nível imbecil, e de repente você enfrenta um combater aleatório extremamente complicado contra 2 bandidos de estrada. Não existe muita variação de mapas e inimigos, dando a impressão que você está sempre jogando a mesma missão, o que deixa o jogo extremamente repetitivo.

This is painfully legible, in any screen resolution.

Character creation is fine, although half the necessary info will come out later, in tutorial windows (in tiny fonts.)

You can save/load manually, whenever you find an opening to do so. Just be patient if you want to reload a fight, because you'll have to fast-click dozens of (small font) lines of dialogue that you don't care for before you regain a modicum of control. What? You would like to save just after a fight, before the branching dialogue in small fonts that ensues? Bwah ah ah!

Freedom is lacking at every step after the character creation (in small and often red fonts.) That the (particularly stupid) storyline holds you by the hand might be fair enough, but the tactical maps also tell you (in small fonts) what their only path to victory is. So long for tactics.
You also have local maps, and then a world map. On all of these, all you can (and must) do is click on the unique next location you can reach. For a boring dialogue or a boring battle.
I don't bloody care if the game will get better in 2 hours, I'm already 2 hours in and I'm bloody bored.

Mechanics are of the same calibre: The game gave me a mage companion, with pretty much the same spells as I. Including a fireball. Never seen such a lame fireball in my life. First you need to correctly align a caster to the point of impact, because the spell is highly restrictive on its destination. Then you watch casting failure upon casting failure, while your mana drops (and it ain't a cheap spell.) Finally, the dynamic duo lands one (by this time the weaponless unique fighter has already fell at least four opponents.) Just one, and the mana of both mages is now depleted. And you read the damage the fireball causes, and you start crying.

Well, what can you expect from a text-heavy software that doesn't grasp the notion of readability?

1) commençons par le ""positif"", les graphismes et la musique (en tout cas de ce que j'ai entendu en deux heures) c'est correct pas dingue mais juste correct. ça essaye de se donner une ambiance mais bon ça réussit pas vraiment (après j'ai deux heures de jeu donc bon). bref j'ai trouvé ça plutôt insipide, je veux bien que ce soit ""médiéval fantastique"" et ""sombre""  mais les maîtres de la dark fantasy comme Moorcock n'hésitent pas a peindre leur univers de mille couleurs chatoyantes, ici on tombe juste dans le cliché des paysages gris avec des coupe-jarrets a chaque coin de rue. la définition même d'insipide. et franchement les environnements se ressemblent tous, les villes sont vides a part un ou deux pnj qui une fois leur dialogue épuisé ne servent plus que de décor (bien piètre d'ailleurs). euh .... zut c'était censé être un point positif pour le jeu ahah ...

2) L'histoire : .......... aaaaaahhh ....... y'en a une ? il semblerait mais le début est tellement nul .... en gros votre personnage est un (ou une) garde et ami(e) de la fille d'un mage important et noble également, un baron, et l'intro c'est littéralement la fille du mage qui se fait manger le bide par un loup et vous qui arrivez (trop tard) pour la sauver. et là dessus un de vos amis communs a vous et la fille du baron (oui pas un ami du loup) arrive, vous voit près du corps de la fille et du loup et en conclut que vous etes coupable, vous fait enfermer et torturer pour avouer un nom (hein ?) et se tire et au final un nain complètement au pif vous délivre (oui un nain prisonnier évadé) et vous délivrez aussi un mage et vous vous barrez de là pour comprendre ce qu'il s'est passé eeeet vos deux joyeux loustics que nous appelleront plot twist et deus ex décident de rester avec vous parceque .... pourquoi déjà ? ah oui ! parceque ! =\_(o v o)_/= aucune raison ahah.

3) le gameplay : fade, comme l'univers et ses personnages. pourtant j'adore les jeux de rôle papier et la gestion des stats, des équipements, les jets de dés hasardeux etc etc, oui mais là non c'est vraiment TROP random ! je m'explique ! vous ous souvenez du magicien qu'on a libéré ? ouiiii Deus Ex c'est bien ça vous avez suivi ! ahah bha figurez vous que non content d'avoir les caractéristiques habituelles des mages, a savoir peu de vie et quasi aucune compétence d'arme, le fameux loustic se permet le luxe de rater ses sorts au moins la moitié du temps ahah .... y compris son sort de soin ! comment on peut rater un heal ?!?!? comment ça se passe ? ton allié est trop fier et il esquive ton sort en prétextant qu'il peut se soigner tout seul ? alors déjà un mage qui rate des sorts offensifs c'est pas jojo mais si en plus il rate aussi ses sorts sur des alliés ! et voyez le problème du mage, bha mettez le aussi sur les autres personnages (TOUS) même les ennemis, tout rate la moitié du temps ce qui donne de beaux petits combats d'autiste qui dure dix plombes. par contre des fois on a des critiques aberrants genre dégâts de base a 5 et critique a 22 ? .... c'est juste mal équilibré. pareil au début la moindre pièce d'équipement coûte hyper cher, et tout est identique dans les magasins ou presque. 

4) les tutoriels : oui c'est pas habituel d'en parler mais là c'est nécessaire ! vous avez 50 choses par page mais si 5 vous sont expliquées sur les 50 vous serez déjà bien content, les compétences ne sont pas claires on sait pas quoi faire de tout ça ni quelle importance a quoi. bâclé.

En résumé c'est naze. vraiment. si vous aimez ce qui a de la profondeur et/ou ne serais-ce qu'un brin d'originalité .... bha évitez ce titre .... ou alors je me plante et l'ambiance décolle plus tard mais faudrait supporter un début insipide avec un gameplay fini a la truelle et des personnages tellement non charismatiques qu'une huître asthmatique serait plus fun a jouer. ah euh .... j'ai pas l'impression qu'il y ait de ""choix"" non plus dans la trame scénaristique, y'a des options de dialogue mais ça n'a l'air d'avoir aucun impact donc bon si vous aimez vivre VOTRE aventure, allez voir ailleurs. des bisous n'achetez pas le jeu y'en a sans doute des mieux comme pillars of eternity (bon ok pillars c'est pas du tactique au tour par tour mais c'est mieux foutu quand même)",1600560671,1600560671,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

元がTRPGということで、ゲームシステムにもそれらを意識したような点が多く、(実際にはどういう計算か不明だが)6面ダイスを使って命中判定やダメージ計算を行っている模様。
その為かダメージのばらつきが非常に大きく、命中率に関しても攻撃側のファンブル(確定失敗)や、回避側のクリティカル判定のようなものであまりアテにならず90％だろうが95％だろうが外れることがしばしば。
総じていい意味でも悪い意味でもSLGというジャンルにしては運任せな場面が多く、セーブ＆ロードで回避されたらやり直し、といったプレイスタイルでゲームを進めるような方には不向きかもしれない。
また、いかにも洋ゲーといったプレイヤーに優しくない難易度設定で、強力なスキルをいくつか取得しておかないと序盤が非常に苦しく、初めからやり直さざるを得ない可能性もあるだろう。
強力なスキルがどれなのか、が把握できれば難所の突破自体は難しくないので理不尽というほどではない。

不具合に関しても、仕様なのかバグなのかよくわからないものだったり、日本語訳が中途半端だったりと色々と粗が目立つのだが、致命的にプレイに影響するような物には遭遇せず。
稀にスキルのポイント(有限でふり直しも不可能)を振り分けたにも拘らず成長がキャンセルされてポイントだけ消費してしまっていたことがあったのが気がかりなくらいか。こまめなセーブをしていれば巻き戻しは可能なレベル。

等々、マイナス面も多いのだが、前述のようなB級映画感のあるストーリーやキャラクター、皮肉やブラックジョークが次々飛び出す会話シーンなど、楽しめる部分も多い。
難易度もマゾゲーとまでは行かないレベルで、攻略サイトなどがほぼ存在しないこともあって歯ごたえ十分。
手探りでゲームを進めながら有用なスキルやアイテムを発見していく感覚は、ネットなどなかった時代、不平不満を叫びながら何度もやり直しつつ攻略していた頃を思い出させてくれるだろう。

間違っても万人にお薦めするゲームではないが、最近のSLGはどれも簡単すぎる、と豪語される方は是非プレイしてみてはいかがであろうか。",1596625029,1596625029,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's incredibly slow, grindy, full of inconsistencies, doesn't seem to have been bug tested and has a terrible inventory system. That's not touching on the fact that it's a game of *incredibly* small numbers. There's absolutely no fun to be had in a RPG that doesn't allow significant progression of your character.

The battle system isn't too bad but the fights themselves, while starting out fairly fun, become nothing but frustrating and monotonous. Rather than add new fight mechanics, the developers have come up with the oh-so-wonderful and unique ideas such as infinite monsters, tasking you to make your way to one side of a map on one hex long ""corridors"" with said infinite monster spawning in the way every turn.

I haven't even touched on the interactive parts of the battle maps; objects that you can only push one way, traps that don't have any effect on enemies, the occasional trap that doesn't appear for you despite having max perception. The list goes on but frankly, I'm already drained from making a final push towards the end of the game. I decided to take a break and write a review after running into yet another range-or-die or fight towards the end of the game. Seriously, there are no new enemies, just ever increasing numbers of crossbowmen/archers.

The story is fairly interesting at points. In fact, it's the only reason I've clocked 40+ hours. It's a classic good vs evil fantasy story, set in a grimdark world with - some, not all - morally grey characters.

Game starts proprerly in chapter 3(7-8h in game), till there it is fairy linear experience and propper storyline don't start till somwere around end of chapter 2 (around 5h in game). If i would need to describe what a game plays like it is something like mix of cRPG, X-Com and battles from Heroes M&M 3. controls in battles are to be honset pretty bad but quick tab save's a lot of pain since digging thro UI to use certain attack or spell is painfull, but you can put it at quick tab, wich i strongly suggest since it speed's up everything by a lot and makes game more enjoyable. Since i mostly played this game offline on my laptop (its great for short sessions of 20-45min) the biggest problem with the game and why it have mixed revievs is, first - Act 1 and half of Act 2 nothing rly happens and it is pretty lenghtly 5-7h depends how well you will do, second - it's overwellming and very hard to grasp and do wellat first conntact, third - it is more like X-Com in terms of fights than any turn based RPG which makes ppl dissapointed in what they expect and what they get.As for a good things, game have branching story and oportunity to end quests in diffrent ways and sometimes changing outcome in story depending if you do some sidequests or not (there is even one side quest that depending if you do it or not you'll end up with diffrent companion), game can feel pretty unfair sometimes, but changeing strategy can change brick wall to a piece of cake, but probably the biggest thing is environment, dropping chandoilers on enemies, using loud spells to drop stalagmites(or stalactytes, i never knew which is which), setting on fire clumps of dried grass enemy is standing in, looring enemies in to a puddles of mud so they'll slip and be exposed to attacks (everything have 100% chance of hitting when enemy is stunned or on the ground) or even fighting wih a behemoth of an enemy for a side quest that is way overlevel than you and defiting him by exploding pockets of gas in the swamp with fire arrows and fireballs. And this is just a tip of an iceberg. To sum things up, if youre looking for an turn based RPG... don't bother, this is not game for you, if you want a tactical game based in fantasy world with makeing your on character and in fantasy world but youre not a masochist then you'll like this game, but beware, game starts in chapter 3 so you'll need to slog on to it and then game rly opens up.

I'd recommend it only for enthusiasts, hardcore TBS gamer and DSA player or a mix thereof.
--------------------------------------
General:

Game is obviously based on the DSA rulesystem, which can be quite confusing, if you have no prior knowledge of it.
Sadly, it also lacks certain explanations, of how your attributes, skills & talents all intertwine. Several checks are not displayed and are done in the background - something a roleplayer does not necessary like.
On top of it, a few rules are implemented but now shown, like the scaling weapon-damage modifier with its strength-bonus, or are otherwise simplified for the games' purpose.
Can be checked with the weapon rulebook or other sources, though - as they are standardized.

Story:
I wonder ... have beaten the game now 2times (DVD + steam) and the story is definitely not the main selling point; you could as well place a lil' pony as quest giver and it wouldn't bother me.
(there is a story present, but often felt as confusing as the implemented crippled rules.)

Gameplay:
turn 1:
*casts corpofrigo @98%* - fizzles
- other party members move
- enemy has successfully poisoned your whole party
turn 2:
*casts mass Klarum Purum* - yay
- other party member miss their 94% to-hit roll
turn 3:
- everyone gets poisoned again
- your fighter could not save the 2 wounds and is now an easy-to-hit target
turn 4:
you decided, it would be probably just better to restart the whole friggin' fight
........
In a nutshell :P

On top of it, the difficult curve is a strange one, and obviously a reason, that not more than 18% of _all_ player have even advanced to chapter III. Because the game is so unfair (*chuckles*), that it presents you one of the toughest and most ridiculous challenges right off the bat in chapter II. One word or rather 2: Louse Queen! You'll hate her like nothing else....

The latter is by far the most annoying and RNG dependent fight in the whole game and even harder than the final fight.
This was also the one time my game crashed or I had to force a crash, because my mage was locked in his action-move and I could not advance - needless to say; I'd have won that battle in 2 turns~. Another 10 battle-restarts later the queen is dead - long live the king!
Good thing about that fight, it's needed to jump into act III - where the 'real' game begins, like 70% of it. Kinda reminded me of vanilla WoW and Naxxramas. Louse (lice? whatever)-queen == Patchwork.

Itemization:
Nothing you need to buy, but a few items to complete the set-bonus - everything else should be poured into potions & poisons! Poison is the KotH in this game - literally. Some of the 'unfair' combat encounter can be done in 1-2 turns just by using poisons....it reads: duration - whole fight; effect: knockdown (!). These is one of the rarer ones and maybe only 8 items of it exist.
Most armor & weapons will be a loot option otherwise.


The game rewards the patient ones, while it punishes the others! It's not a game, where you will deal uttermost ridiculous amounts of damage, but rather cripple and weaken your enemy or poison them ^.^
Reading-skills might be required for some skills & talents to understand, what exactly they do.

Average completionist time is around 40hours with every quest done on normal gameplay. Sadly a few achievements are still bugged...but better them, than either the act III main plot or a rather significant important sidequest in the same chapter for one of the most powerful weapons ingame.
That happened prior to patch 1.3 several times and forced me to reboot the campaign occasional ^^

Now that I spent quite a few time writing this, it's safe to assume, that I actually like the game, given 2 finished runs as well :>

6.5/10

[DSA / Dark Eye basic knowledge really helps to turn the game from a grind-experience into an actual gaming experience. Wish the developer would have paid more attention on the 'Drakensang' release and how it is done properly.
With a better story and less nonsensical simplified rules it would be higher rated.

Oh, and the bloom-effect; really?]

One shall not wound or poison a skeleton! Never ever
At least they messed up their weapon damage formula to such extent, that the magical attribute on a weapon nullifies it main-source of damage and converts it into a complete new one. Oi, look - it's a legendary speer....*uhm* why does it not do piercing damage? - because the game decided it should do magical damage instead, which 98% of all enemies have 0% resistance against. (that could serve as a hint =^.^=)

Il titolo, sviluppato e pubblicato da Daedalic Entertainment, è un gdr strategico a turni basato sul gioco da tavolo tedesco “The Dark Eye”, che in Germania ha superato in vendite D&D.
[h1]Storia[/h1]
Il nostro personaggi sarà accusato dell’omicidio di una principessa e per tale ragione verrà imprigionato. Consapevole della sua innocenza decide di fuggire insieme ad altri due prigionieri. Da qui si dipaneranno vicende che lo coinvolgeranno in cose più grandi di lui.
La storia non brilla per originalità ed i personaggi seppur alcuni siano ben caratterizzati, non sono mai troppo approfonditi. La trama è abbastanza lineare e concede solo alcune deviazioni per delle missioni secondarie. L’ambientazione fantasy è propria di “The Dark Eye”.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Le battaglie si svolgono su griglie esagonali di mappe relativamente piccole. Seguono le regole del gioco di ruolo da tavolo e dunque tutte le azioni(in base alle statistiche del personaggio) avranno una certa percentuale di riuscita, come in un lancio di dadi, e ci si muove in turni basati sull’iniziativa. Ogni personaggio ha a disposizione le stesse finestre di abilità, capacità e magie degli altri personaggi. Starà al giocatore creare una squadra equilibrata distribuendo i punti abilità necessari allo sblocco di una determinata abilità, capacità, magia o semplicemente usarli per aumentare le statistiche base. Ogni personaggio inoltre è interamente modificabile nell’equipaggiamento, non molto diversificato, che rende disponibili una serie di bonus se si indossano set di armature completi. Più varie le armi che avranno anche loro diverse peculiarità. E’ possibile interagire con elementi della mappa che cambiano l’ambiente di gioco, ma sono elementi raramente opzionali e messi a disposizione perchè studiati appositamente per la battaglia che si svolge. Il livello di difficoltà è alto, ed è facile morire e dover riprovare un combattimento cambiando tattiche, tuttavia questa difficoltà è più sintomo di una mal gestione della stessa più che di una oculata scelta di nemici e elementi ambientali. Nel mondo di gioco ci si sposta in una mappa di luogo in luogo con uno spostamento rapido, dove è possibile interagire con personaggi e intraprendere quest secondarie, fare acquisti o riposare. Sono disponibili scelte multiple nei dialoghi che tuttavia cambiano poco e niente gli avvenimenti se non lo sviluppo di determinate scene e determinate secondarie, ma senza mai alterare la trama principale. Solo alcune decisioni verso la fine del gioco definiscono il finale.
[h1]Comparto Tecnico[/h1]
Graficamente modelli poligonali, texture ed effetti sono sotto la media. La personalizzazione del personaggio è estremamente povera e limitata. La gestione della telecamera poteva essere fatta meglio, risultando fastidiosa e poco d’aiuto in determinate mappe. Il comparto audio rimane anonimo nonostante le melodie di stampo fantasy accompagnino decentemente l’avventura.
[h1]Conclusione[/h1]
Sia dal punto di vista narrativo che tecnico il titolo pecca di qualità. Trama abbastanza lineare e senza particolare pathos mista ad un comparto grafico deludente e una colonna sonora per nulla incisiva. Dal lato del gameplay invece vi è un chiaro impegno nel rendere profondo uno strategico a turni con tante abilità, capacità e magie disponibili per i personaggi nonché un uso interessante dell’ambiente a favore del giocatore. Tuttavia la difficoltà è mal gestita risultando spesso in combattimenti frustranti dettati più dalla fortuna del lancio di dadi che dalla tattica. Ciò si riassume in un titolo mediocre che tuttavia vale la pena provare se amanti del genere e se si perdonano certe pecche.

What I like the most is that this game is straight to the point: combat. Sweet turn-based combat on a grid; no running around town like a headless chicken looking for/talking to NPC's, no reading walls of text and lore. You have a world map where you travel from one location to another by one click. In some locations another smaller dungeon map (a la Darkest Dungeon) pops up and you can decide which room to visit next.

A few short cut-scenes here and there with voice acted character interaction. The story is basically on autopilot but you sometimes are presented with choices.

So if you are like me, not much time to play games because of work and/or family and just want to enjoy some quality turn based combat with some light story interspersed this game is a good choice.

Inventory management is okay, you are given some loot after battles. You are not flooded with cheap, useless garbage though. Most of the stuff you get is useful and what you don't need can be sold in the next town for a pretty decent price so that you can fill up on provisions and potions.

Can be played with mouse only. The only key on the keyboard you might need is 'V' to highlight interactive object on the battlefield. You can't customise buttons in the game but you can do what I did: I just remapped 'V' to one of my thumb buttons on my mouse and I don't even need to touch the keyboard when playing.

I mostly enjoyed my time with Blackguards. The aesthetics of the game are pretty cool!  They also did a good job in varying battles.  One of the high points of the game is how battlefields all have things going on with them beyond being just a normal grid.  There is a surprising variety of traps, pressure plates, environmental hazards, things falling from the sky, etc.

Ultimately, though, I don’t recommend the game.  Some of the battles get unnecessarily draggy.  There are a fair number of battles where the objective is to move your entire team from point A to point B.  In these battles, they give you extremely narrow corridors and respawning enemies, which tend to clump in front of you.  One of these battles takes place in a literal maze and uses extremely tedious pressure pads with gates that open and shut – not well suited to a combat SRPG.

Another questionable decision was the weight-based inventory system that limits the player from collecting too many weapons or armor.  It did not add to the game and introduced an element of unnecessary micromanagement.  I also found the equipment stats to be confusing – it is unclear which armor is superior, and there’s not a whole lot of selections for mages, who are mostly in leather for the whole game.

Finally, as with other games from this publisher, there are bugs.  A game breaking bug in chapter 3 prevented a key NPC from giving me a quest needed to advance.  I had to reload an old save a replay a section of the game.  Also, several of the achievements are broken.

It uses the Dark Eye RPG rules in the game, the same as some previous CRPGs like Drakensang and the Arkania series. I've spent around 20 or 30 hours playing the game so far, and this review is based on my impressions while playing the first quarter or so of the game.

Pros:
- Storyline seems quite interesting. After a rather short, strange, surreal intro, you find yourself trying to escape from prison. At that point, you have no idea what is actually going on in the game, but later flashback sequences start to fill in the blanks for you, and this keeps you going (despite the game's other shortcomings) as you strive to find out more about the game's background story.
- Some decent voice acting and funny moments in the game's dialogue. Love the dwarf Naurim!

Cons:
- The game mechanics. This game uses the ridiculously complicated Dark Eye RPG rules, which I'm not going to go into here. Suffice to say that most actions in the game involve a check against the relevant attributes of the character performing the action to determine whether it succeeds or not. Spells, for example, are not cast automatically, but are subject to this check. This system seems unfairly biased towards your enemies, who seem to land melee hits and cast spells in combat successfully way more often than what your characters do. Enemies also seem to land critical hits more often too. A lot of the fights are set up to be played a certain way and the game punishes you if you don't toe the line. It punishes you anyway as the random number rolls are almost never in your favour though.
- Lack of clarity. For example, nowhere does it seem to show you what the chances are of some of your talents (like treating wounds or setting traps) succeeding or not. If you use poison on your equipped weapon before a battle, it doesn't show anywhere that your weapon has actually been poisoned. if you have a high strength score, it doesn't indicate what difference this makes to your weapon damage.
- Clunky and tedious gameplay. You can't use a healing potion, mana potion, trap, or poison in battle unless these have been added to your belt, which, depending on the belt's quality, can only hold 1 to 4 of these items. You can't use anything that still happens to be in your backpack during a battle, so if you forgot to change the contents of your belt slots, tough luck. You have 3 different weapon sets you can change between during a battle, but it takes a whole action to change your weapon set, and if you want to switch to a weapon currently in your backpack instead, too bad.
- The sheer stinginess of the game. It may improve later on, but most of the early part of the game, you find yourself using whatever you salvaged from the prison you escaped from as most other gear is way too expensive. Merchants only sell a handful of different (and expensive) items so it can be difficult to equip your characters with decent gear. Combats reward you usually with a small amount (25 or 50) adventure points which you use to improve your characters' skills and attributes. You get a piss-poor amount of treasure from a typical combat. For example, early in the game, you go off scavenging on some old battlefield for armour and weapons, and promptly get attacked by 4 or 5 bandits in leather armour, 2 of which are using bows. At the end of the fight, you get a bastard sword and a couple of other small items. Yippee. What happened to all the gear the bandits were carrying?
- Exploration sucks. Your main map is an overland map which you use to travel to various towns and villages there. Each town has a single screen which shows the various people (blacksmith, healer, merchant, trainer, quest giver etc) which you can click on to access. That's it. Dungeons consist of a simple line map with a number of different locations which you can click on to go to instantly, and this takes you straight to a battle map where you slog through another (usually tedious) battle.

In concluding, I'm giving this game 5/10 as it has its good moments, but is let down mainly by the utterly frustrating combat mechanics, overall difficulty level, lack of equipment, and general lack of any fun factor. Unless you're a hardcore Dark Eye RPG fan who doesn't mind constantly reloading saved games to get through some of the combats, I'd advise looking elsewhere for a decent CRPG in this price range.",1592297039,1592297039,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is a decent turn-based RPG/Strategy, based on the Dark Eye world (pen & paper RPG).

Graphics 6/10

Nothing particularly exciting, functional, they could definitely have done a lot more with them, even if the game is now six years old.

Sound 7/10

I think the best part of the game, decent background music and also good voice acting! 

Gameplay 6/10

It takes a bit of time to get into the game, but it does feel rewarding after a while.  The game mechanics are not particularly well explained and sometimes that can cause a bit of frustration. The biggest issue, something that others have mentioned is the continuous misses or the spells fizzing out several times in a row, even if the chance of success if very high.

Story 7/10

The story is good, it gives you a good understanding of the plot, and makes effective usage of the voice acting in the game.

Generally speaking, I would recommend the game, if you are a fan of the RPG universe. If not, there are other genre games that are probably better.

Edit: There seems to be an issue with the game saves. Basically while I save the game at a particular stage (for example, after completing the third act), the next day those saves load progress from much earlier in the game (in my example, before completing the third act). This so far has happened twice. I made sure that I have control of the folder the game saves (admin rights), and before I exit the game, I autosave and also save on a separate file.",1591550260,1592131137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

*No spoilers here =)

The plot is cool and the game is challenging. It takes a little time to understand the characters sheet and know what skills are worth or not, but you can only trully understand its complexity at almost half the game so read some tutorials first if you don't want to waste time. With that said, probably the hardest part is to creat a balanced party that can witstand all kinds of troubles. You can clearly see some D&D roots, specially in the games atmosphere, but he system itself is quite diffent and this is not a negative point.

The game presents  lots of challenges, escpecially in battles, some moral decisions and choices that influence the outcome of events.

Graphics are quite fine, not super refined, yet you can see that the authors have put some effort on it. The audio creates a good atmosphere for the game and i did not found any glitches or bugs on my run, altough some users on forums warn about some bugs, but i'm not sure on which versions and if they're all fixed.

I'm eager to play the sequel game Blackguards 2 and enjoy more of that nostalgic D&D universe that is hard to find around these days!

The game is set in the Dark Eye Universe and because I'm a huge fan of that franchise and enjoyed the game at some point, I'll give it a thumps up.

How can I summarize this game? In one word; UNFAIR. Or at least unreasonable.

While the game might look like a tactical turn based RPG, it really is just luck. You can be the best tactician in the world and would still have a very hard time playing it. A lot of the enemies have unreasonable resistances, some can only be fought with ranged fighters, some are immune to any type of magic etc. So, yes, you can skill your character whatever you want but you'll have to follow a specific build sooner or later if you actually want to win (I had to find that out the hard way). 

Another thing is the 'chance to hit', which already has been criticized in other reviews. The game might tell you, you have a 95% chance to hit. Sounds good, right? But the 5% chance to miss are still there and in a lot of the time you WILL miss, no matter how high the percentage is. And yes, this is how random values work, but in a game like that, it just made the whole character leveling system gratuitous and the fights unnecessarily frustrating.

Also, the second chapter was very annoying, hard and boring AND will take your probably best teammate away from you. At that part I was really close to quitting the game but decided to push through. One last thing is the soundtrack that is actually good but only consists of 5 tracks or so, so it starts haunting you after some time.

So what are the good things? First things first; the setting. For every fan of the Dark Eye franchise this is a must try as it  is really lore friendly in my opinion. I, for myself, also liked the story. It drew me in from the first second on. But if you'll like the story or not depends on your taste. 
The dialogue was also good and very funny some times. I played it in German and a lot of the voice lines were perfectly done, by even some of my favorite voice actors. Other actors on the other hand did a really poor job that made some serious scenes unbearable.

Your group members are more or less interesting rather than original. They mostly consist of the average fantasy archetype. Angry/greedy dwarf, flirtatious/womanizer spy, snarky witch etc. Still, listening to their dialogues can be fun (but at times I had the feeling the writers tried too hard).

Игра не хватает звезд с неба.
Графика посредственная, стилистика меня не впечатлила.
Сюжет для РПГ скудный, я бы сказал для галочки. Повествование идет через коротенькие диалоги. Что-то вроде Диабло или там Титан квест. Парочка фраз, чтобы придать всему происходящему смысл. Персонажи с характерами, но оочень шаблонные.
Открытого мира нет, вообще все перемещение идёт по рельсам. Я бы даже сказал в некую оболочку из сюжета завернули огромное количество карт для пошагового боя. Если вы будите скипать все диалоги и не вникать в сюжет, то ничего не потеряете.
Музыка кстати начинает раздражать через несколько часов игры.
Из плюсов могу выделить прокачку персонажа. Сделано это действительно интересно, в это хочется разбираться и тут нужно вникать и думать.
Тактические бои очень хороши. На карте могут быть различные условия для победы, предметы с которыми можно взаимодействовать, траву там поджигать, обрушивать на врагов камни и т.п. В данном случае разнообразие имеется.

Как итог: игра с хорошим геймплеем и плохой атмосферой, сюжетом и т.д. Игру смело можно брать по скидке, если вы любите тактические бои. Может быть даже полный прайс отдать можно, но если вы ищите рпг для отыгрыша, хотите сюжет или просто игру в интересном мире, то покупать не стоит.

Combat mechanics: Meh. It is fairly standard, turn based, flanking, random hit/miss chance. It's OK, nothing innovative at all.
Inventory/class/skill systems: Equipment is very generic, there are much more robust systems out there. The skill systems for the 3 classes does look quite robust. It does however look like there are obvious better choices which you need to pick otherwise you'll struggle.
Story: The major turnoff. Linear, obvious, boring. 2-dimensional companion characters. Gives you choices which aren't choices as they all lead to the same thing.

Overall: There is nothing innovative in this game. I could overlook this if the story was good, the characters were interesting or the combat was compelling but the fact it all aspects of it are mediocre at best and poor in other areas there is really no reason to play this game.

One Hour Reviews #67 - Blackguards

When I see that a game is both RPG and Tactical, it's hard to know going in if it's going to be more of one or the other.  In the case of Blackguards though, it doesn't waste any time making it's RPG influence evident, as the first thing you do upon starting a game is to create a new character.

It gives you the option between Basic and Expert mode for creating a character, which isn't normally something I see in RPG games.  Apparently it's based on a ruleset called The Dark Eye, so the idea being if you don't have any background in that, you can choose the basic mode, and it will distribute your stats automatically.  

I picked basic mode, and the only things I ended up having to set was my  Profession and Gender.  Based on what profession you pick, you have a selection of 5 looks for your character.  So anyone looking for an in-depth character customizer will be disappointed.   Finally I named my character and proceeded to start the game.

After a confusing cutscene, you are put in the tutorial, where it guides you through the basics of moving on a hex-based tactical map, and killing a wolf.   After the battle, you are taken through another cutscene, and the story starts by having your character accused of murder.

Again, you'll see the heavy RPG influence here.   In between cutscenes, your character is narrating what's going on, and soon he meets a few other prisoners, with whom you engage in a multiple choice dialog.  Afterward, it's prison break time, and a chance for the tutorial to introduce you to more of the tactical elements of the game.

The game uses what it calls a ring menu that pops up when you right click, and it give you various options based on what profession you are.     First you have the Warrior who is good with weapons and damage dealing, but poorly trained in other areas.   The Hunter is good with ranged weapons, and most other disciplines except magic.  And finally the mage is your magic casting profession, who has limited ability to use melee weapons, and no ranged weapons.  

The tutorial also takes this time to explain how certain objects you can interact with during the fight.  So for example my character moved to a spot and pulled a switch, which caused a conveniently placed chandelier to fall right on top of one of the guards I was fighting.    Blackguards seems to really want to play up the interactive environments.

After winning the battle you are rewarded with some items that you loot off the guards.  Ah yes, inventory management, another RPG staple.    At this point I'd have to say that Blackguards really feels like an RPG that happens to have some tactical turn-based fighting in it.

Each subsequent fight I got in, the tutorial introduced me to some additional tactical elements, like casting a barrier spell.  Once I broke out of the prison, I was introduced to the World Map, where I headed to a nearby city.  Cities are basically just an animated background that allow you to select from a few different places to do business.  For instance you can buy weapons from the Blacksmith, or rent a room from the Innkeeper.

Before leaving the city, the game prompts me to spend some time improving my skills.  Skills are improved by spending Adventure Points (AP).  I mentioned earlier how this game was based on a rule set called The Dark Eye.  That influence is evident here, as the character sheet is a bit overwhelming at first.  You have stats that are split across 5 different areas:  Base Values, Weapon Talents, Talents, Spells, and Special Abilities.   Everything costs AP to improve, with lower level stats costing less to improve, and the cost increasing each level.

Base Values cover your core stats, and here you'll see standard options like Strength, Constitution, Charisma, and Dexterity.  Although strangely it also splits stats that are normally the same stat, such as splitting out Agility from Dexterity, and Vitality from Constitution.  

One interesting thing about Weapon Talents.  Most RPGs just have a base skill for your weapon type that you increase (think Skyrim).  But in Blackguards, you can spend AP to increase your ability to attack or parry with the weapon.  You have a slider which determines how the points are spread, so you can adjust it to focus more on attack and less on defense.  And each melee weapon has this same option.

Talents cover various skills that you can level up by spending AP.   Spells you can also level up, but only if you already know the spell.  Otherwise you have to find a trainer to learn it.  And lastly, Special Abilities are divided into different areas (Melee, Ranged, Magic, Passive).  Some special abilities work in a tree where you have to unlock the lower abilities before you can get the higher ones.  Other abilities are standalone and have no prerequisite.

After leaving the city, I got into one last fight where the tutorial introduced the concepts of line of sight and cover.   Then my 60 minutes was up.

Overall I had a decent bit of fun with Blackguards, and I was surprised at how RPG heavy it ended up being.  At the time I played it, it happened to be on sale at a whopping 90% off, so the game was only a dollar.   That sale is over now, but even at the regular price of 10 dollars, it seems like a good value to me.

Because I didn't make it far into the game, be sure to read some other reviews to see what people felt about the tactical options  and the later game.  But that said, I'd happily recommend this based on my first hour of play.  This is a game I'd happily spend more time in.",1588303729,1588303753,True,9,0,0.547382831573486328,0,False,False,False,False,,,

With that said, I don't really have any praise, mostly complaints.

[b] Graphics: [/b] for a title from 2013 it's fine; the world map looks awesome
[b] Soundtrack: [/b] it's alright, but nothing exceptional
[b] Voice acting: [/b] actually pretty good, with some weaker moments (an elf with a Brittish accent is kinda funny)
[b] Story: [/b] worldbuilding is pretty decent, characters are fine and the story itself is nothing exceptional, but still interesting; player input mostly doesn't affect anything
[b] Gameplay: [/b] slow and not particularly enjoyable, too much RNG
[b] Replayability: [/b] storywise there's only really like one fork and combatwise your experience probably won't be too different; pretty much none

My main complaint is the combat, given that's why you'd play this sort of a game. It's pretty slow and the absence of any sort of speed options is definitely a miss. Usually it's fine, but in some missions it's downright infuriating.

RNG is part of combat in this kind of a game, but here it was a bit too much. Even fully upgraded characters have trouble hitting with their advanced skills (less so with spells, in most fights), forcing you to slug it out with the lesser ones.

You don't get very many active combat skills and most of the time you'll be using one or two, anyway. (Either due to low chances to hit or due to the fact that some skills are just not worth using.) Compare that with magic, which has like 30 spells (most of which you probably won't need to ever use), where you can expect to max out around 4-5 by the end.

There's quite an extensive selection of weaponry (probably too extensive/broken up into individual categories) and you can reasonably have a good melee/ranged character (but not so much melee/mage). You get three weapon loadouts and it's not a bad idea to have two types melee weapons (due to plenty of mobs having immunities) + a ranged option. It sucks that swapping weapons takes up a whole turn, so you probably won't be doing that too often.

Magic is awful early on and even later on you get into fights where your spells have terrible chances to actually go off. Lower rank spells are pretty meh and all ranks are a tad too expensive relative to the total mana pool of mages (50-60 in late game with regen of around 5 per turn, higher rank spells cost 20-30), but most fights aren't long enough for this to really matter. There are some fights in succession and there you just have to suck it up and spend a turn drinking potions.

Outside of this I have only one complaint regarding the story:[spoiler] killing off Niam for nothing but a cheap shock moment felt pretty bad, especially as there's no real payoff to it (you kill the two slavers that captured you, big whoop), and even though you've only had her for a while by then, she was a likeable stoner elf; if you want to have an archer you're going to have to spec someone else into that role, unless you're one yourself[/spoiler]",1587853392,1597091198,False,8,0,0.602450370788574219,0,False,False,False,False,,,

От разработчика Daedalic Entertainment.  Обзор не содержит плагиата и написан целиком и полностью мной, Гвардом.



Blackguards по жанровой принадлежности относится к пошаговым РПГ с элементами стратегии.
Сюжет игры довольно оригинален. Все начинается с того что наш герой оказывается не в том месте и не в то время. А именно мы наблюдаем как на местную принцессу нападает волчара и мы как истинный герой бросаемся на помощь даме, но... Не успеваем. И видим как волк растерзал несчастную и мы убиваем животное и склоняемся над телом дабы хоть чем то помочь, но уже поздно и как на зло в этот момент появляется стража. И застаёт весьма недвусмысленную картину — над окровавленным телом принцессы склонился какой-то мужик с окровавленным оружием в руках. Не став разбираться и не слушая наши вопли о невиновности нас хватают и тащат в тюрьму. Как жизненно... Подвергнув нас допросу — сразу кидают в тюрьму из которой нам и предстоит выбираться, а потом и восстанавливать своё доброе имя доказывая всем что мы невиновны.


Теперь поговорим о геймплее.
Бои, а именно они составляют большую часть игры происходят на поле поделенном на гексы. Собственно в гексах мы рассчитываем дальность хода персонажей. Сами бои очень разнообразны, ситуации на поле боя не перестают удивлять, а порой вызывать ненависть своей сложностью. Хотя надо отметить что ближе к концу игры из-за частоты боев они начинают утомлять.Вообще хардкорность боёв является одной из фишек игры хотя в свое время форумы игры буквально уходили в бамп лимит от криков игроков привыкших к казуальщине о том что бы разработчики понизили сложность. Что бы победить в бою просто так кликать мышкой недостаточно, нужно шевелить извилинами и напрягать свои таланты тактика.

Собственно вся игра по сути своей это цепочки бесконечных боев соединённые между собой глобальной картой. Есть еще такие же схематичные для галочки города и локальные карты между которыми переключаемся кликая мышкой по стрелочкам. Ну и конечно с кучей экранов с текстами диалогов.
В игре нас ждут сотни несюжетных квестов и все они интересны и разнообразны.


Торжеством гейм дизайна являются сами боевые арены обладающие интерактивными элементами ландшафта, в том числе. К примеру топи в болотах и болотный газ который можно поджечь факелом. В подземельях кучи ящиков которые можно двигать и ронять устраивая ловушки.

Очень много времени нам придется уделять экрану развития персонажей. Система прокачки тут увлекательна и весьма глубока. Магия тут разделяется на четыре вида. Атакующая и вспомогательная, Ослабляющая наших врагов и усиливающая нашего персонажа. Каждый вид в свою очередь может прокачиваться еще на четыре стадии. Они в свою очередь влияют на урон от заклятий, длительность и т.д

Все заклинания имеют свой шанс срабатывания на который можно влиять прокачкой разных характеристик. На удивление стандартный интеллект влияет не на все заклинания. Есть такие которые зависят от выносливости или силы персонажа.

В игре великое множество оружия и доспехов. Причем у оружия кучи характеристик влияющих не только на дамаг, но и на шансы парирования, уворотов, инициативы и еще много чего. Не забыта система штрафов для брони. Не стоит пытаться одевать на мага тяжелую броню...

Графика в игре довольно посредственная. Особенно некрасиво выглядят лица персонажей. Но со временем с графикой свыкаешься и перестаешь обращать на её бюджетность внимание.

Отдельно отмечу великолепное музыкальное сопровождение которому хочется чуть ли не подпевать. Озвучка диалогов отличная и актеры звучания отыгрывают на все сто. Правда русификация выполнена отвратно и лучше играть на английском языке если вы знаете его на достойном уровне или же если вам не очень важны нюансы сюжета.

Во-первых, игра постоянно бросает виртуальный кубик, проверяя вероятность нанести критический удар, уклониться от атаки, получить травму, даже просто попасть по врагу. Во-вторых, очень важно грамотно использовать местность и предметы окружения: можно заманивать недругов в лужи, где они поскользнутся и пропустят ход, или в какой-нибудь узкий проход, где ваш дварф с тяжеленным молотом будет по одному избивать противников. Кроме того, разрешено расставлять ловушки, загораживать проходы бочками или ящиками, а потом поджигать их — в таких «горячих» местах враги будут постоянно получать урон от огня.

Наконец, многие сражения отягощены особыми условиями. Где-то нужно пробиться на другой конец карты, минуя ловушки и активируя рычаги. Где-то — успеть за несколько ходов перейти мост. Где-то — вовремя спасти окруженного злодеями персонажа. Или поскорее уничтожить кристаллы, восстанавливающие здоровье всем противникам.
P.s
Играть в Blackguards действительно сложно. Драться приходится постоянно, и каждый раз это испытание. Заклинания у магов срабатывают через раз, мана (точнее, астральная энергия) тратится быстро, восстанавливается медленно (или вовсе не восстанавливается, если вы нарядили колдуна в металлическую броню), «танки» и лучники регулярно промахиваются.

주관적인 장점과 단점의 비교

장점

반전에 반전에 반전을 거듭하는 한편의 소설 같은 단단한 스토리라인이 최고의 장점 되시겠다.
발더스게이트같은 전형적인 미국식 RPG 에 종종 구현되는 최악의 시스템이 이 게임에는 없다.
한권의 책을 그대로 이식한 것과 같은 저널 시스템, 100분 토론 분량의 대사량 등등 사람을 지치게 하는 요소가 없다.
블랙가드는 간결한 대화와 간간히 나오는 동영상으로 깔끔하게 스토리를 전달해 준다.
그러면서도 반전에 반전에 반전을 거듭하는 판타지계의 용의자X의 헌신 되시겠다.
또한, 스토리도 스토리지만, 이 스토리를 이어가는 인물들의 성향과 관계가 정말 맛깔난다.
JRPG 처럼 무슨 주인공 일행들이 전부 일치단결하여 가족같은 분위기로 시종일관 악마를 물리치기 위해 내달리는 그런 단순한 관계가 아니다.
(여기서 잠시 스토리가 언급되지만, 반전에 반전에 반전이 있으므로 스포일러 축에는 안들어가는 부분이니 안심하길 바람)
대략적인 인물 소개로 주인공 일행의 좌충우돌 모험기를 설명하자면 이렇다.
1. 누명을 쓰고 쫓기는 주인공.(기억상실증에 걸림, 기억을 찾고 누명을 벗고, 세계를 구원(?) 하는게 목표(?))
2. 그 주인공의 감빵 동기 다혈질 드워프.(감빵에 갇히게 된 사연도 기가막힘)
3. 또 주인공의 감빵 동기 난봉꾼 마법사.(사랑에 관해 굉장히 뚜렷한 자신만의 철학이 있지만, 결국 깜빵행)
4. 동생 병걸린거 치료해 주겠다고 약 끊고(마약) 비실비실 따라나선 궁수.(게임 내내 시도때도 없이 마약을 갈구하며 비실됨)
6. 투기장 노예로 끌려온 아프리카(?) 원주민.(마법사와 드워프가 구박하고, 틈만나면 노예상인에게 팔아버릴려고 함)
7. 주인공의 절친이며 반전에 반전에 반전으로 플레이어를 들어다 놨다하는 마녀.(상상도 못할 스토리를 안겨줌)
이렇듯 짧은 등장인물 소개 만으로도 좌충우돌 대환장파티가 느껴지지 않는가?
여기에 더해 감초같은 등장인물과 적으로 등장하지만 반전에 반전을 안겨주는 인물도 많다.
이런 인물들과 함께 소설같은 메인퀘스트(메인스토리)와 더불어 모험심과 수집욕을 자극하는 서브퀘스트는 이 RPG의 화룡정점이며, 이 인물들을 매우 다양하게 내가 원하는 방향으로 키울 수 있다.
요새 온라인 게임처럼 태생이 궁수, 태생이 마법사, 태싱이 전사가 아니라 내가 원한다면 충분히 다르게 키울 수 있다.
물론 어느정도는 정해져서 나오지만 전사를 궁수로 키울 수 있고, 마법사는 공격형 마법사로 키울지 힐러형 서포터로 키울지 등등 나름 자유도를 줘서 키우는 맛이 산다.
이 게임을 40시간 이상(1회 플레이로) 플레이 해본 유저로써 더 많은 장점이 있지만, 이후 플레이하는 유저들을 위해 줄이도록 하겠다.

단점

그래픽이 솔직히 좀 별로다.
하지만 내 컴퓨터가 최신 게임을 하기에는 사양이 부족해서 답답한 분들이 계시다면, 오히려 장점으로 승화한다.
즉 사양이 높지 않다.
그래픽이 별로인데 사양이 높을리가 있겠는가?
필자가 생각하는 단점은 그래픽 뿐이다.

그럼 여기서 마지막으로 장점으로도, 단점으로도 얘기하기 애매한 전투 시스템의 특정 부분에 대해 언급해보겠다.
블랙가드는 타격을 할때 확률이 미리 뜬다.
그리고 그 확률이 90% 인데 상대방이 자주 피하고, 막는다.
더불어 방심하고 있다가 치명타 맞고 훅 가버리는 내 동료(?)를 보며 분개하고 블랙가드의 단점으로 리뷰를 작성한다.
하지만 이 게임을 오래하다보면 대충 어느정도 이해를 하게 된다.
일단 내 캐릭터가 강타(스킬)를 쓰기 전에 확률이 80% 라고 뜬다는 가정하에, 이 80% 라는 수치는 적 캐릭터의 회피 스킬 및 방어 스킬이 감안이 안된 수치다.
기본적인 능력치와 버프로 인해 올라간 저항력은 이 수치에 영향을 준다.
민첩과 회피율 버프를 받은 적은 이 80% 하는 수치가 60% 로 줄어드는걸 볼 수 있다.
하지만 회피율을 올려주는게 아닌 확률적으로 회피하게 해주는 회피 스킬이나, 확률적으로 방패로 막는 방어 스킬은 이 수치에 영향을 안주므로 게임을 하면서 그 부분을 감안하고 플레이하면 정신건강에 매우 이롭다.
그리고 이런 요소가 오히려 필자에게는 전투가 더욱 재밌는 요소였다.
치명타는 솔직히 가시적으로 드러나는 확률이 없어서, 나는 터지고 적은 안터졌으면 하는 바램만을 갖고 운에 기대면 된다.

만약에 여기까지 글을 읽었을 누군가가 있다면, 이 게임을 할지 말지 엄청나게 고뇌를 했다는 증거다.
별로 재미도 없고, 두서도 없는 이 글을 끝까지 읽은 이유는 결국 내적갈등이 원인이지 않겠는가?
그렇다면 과감하게 구매해서 게임을 플레이하길 적극 권장한다.
사실 가격도 워낙 착해서 그리 큰 부담도 안될 터인데 고민하는 당신에게 마지막 말을 하고 이만 줄이도록 하겠다.
가격이 문제가 아니라 게임의 재미가 문제라면!!
사라, 사고나서 재미없으면 날~ 쏘고가라.
특히 턴제 RPG를 좋아한다면 두번 추천한다.

[h1] En conclusion... [/h1]

[i] Si Daedalic voulait nous pondre le Demon's Soul du RPG tactique, c'est réussi. Dans Blackguards, la difficulté des combats en tour par tour est autant un mal qu'un bien, il faut donc l'acheter en connaissance de cause.

Pour un premier coup, c'est un coup de maître. Daedalic fait montre d'un savoir-faire certain dans le gameplay et d'une subtile habileté dans la narration. Le jeu ne prend jamais le joueur pour un idiot et lui demande de se servir un tant soit peu de sa tête pour extirper de Blackguards sa substantielle moelle. Accessible, exigeant, riche, drôle, prenant, envoûtant, subtil, charmant... Les adjectifs ne manquent pas même si le jeu a bien des défauts, je ne le cache pas. Seulement, ceux-ci sont continuellement balayés d'un revers de main par des bonnes idées en pagaille.

Pour conclure, Blackguards est un jeu vraiment intelligent. Ses plus grandes forces sont sans doute ses mécanismes de jeu, son univers sombre vous permettant de recruter des drogués ou des criminels, ses graphismes plutôt jolis. Mais la volonté de rendre cet univers accessible aussi bien aux aficionados qu’aux débutants risque finalement de ne satisfaire ni les uns ni les autres. Les grands fans de RPG et de tour par tour s’y retrouveront sans problème, et par la force des choses le jeu leur est plutôt adressé ; mais les nouveaux joueurs devront s’armer de persévérance pour en venir à bout.

Как RPG, она ни какая. Здесь нет мирных локаций и городов, в привычном понимании этого слова. Есть лишь экран, (который, как бы город), с несколькими персонажами. Наводя курсор на кого-то из них, вы получаете окно диалога. Только вот НПС, редко больше пяти. Из них, 1- Кузнец, 2 - Таверна. 3- Доктор. 4 - Торговец. 5- тот самый НПС, которому можно сдать или получить квест. Всё! Бывает ещё учитель, но он редко бывает 6, скорее вместо кого-то, а бывает и совмещение. Этих учителей, 1 на 5 ""городов"" За всё время игры, (я не прошёл 1 акт, наигранные часы вы можете увидеть) у меня было два разветвления. Побочный - отдать посох или соврать, что не нашёл. Второй, персональный сопаратийца - спасти или нет его женщину, которые не на что ни повлияли. 
Как тактика, я скажу так, я не хочу такую тактику. Простой пример. В партии есть гном- танк. Есть противник у которого осталось 10 хитов. Гном может ударить максимум 12 (2 кубика по 6) он ударит с уроном 9. Если у противника 11, то удар нанесёт 10, если 8, то урон будет 7 и т.д. В одном бою, это произошло пять раз с пятью противниками. И это только в одном, а так в каждом. Я думаю, вы знаете, что означает подобное.
Ещё пример, я создал себе мага. Второго мага вы встретите. Мой маг, при вероятности 76% промазал 4 раза из 5. Маг в партии, при вероятности 46%, попал 3 из 5. Как? Ну как? К конц боя, когда попадания критически важны, одни промах, может сгубить весь спланированный бой.
Да, партия не сбалансирована. Но во первых, кто знал, что следующим, кого я возьму будет маг, и только один танк.

What little I've played of Blackguards, I enjoyed. I don't think it's a great game, by any means, but it's interesting enough that, far from simply failing to regret my time with the game, I find I genuinely intend to revisit it again at some point in the future. When I have the time. And there aren't a thousand other, more compelling CRPGs demanding my time. In short Blackguards is a combat-focused SRPG, with a unique premise (your party consists of escaped criminals). From what I could tell, there's very little in the way of narrative reactivity or opportunities for player expression (all of the party members are predefined characters) but the storytelling was solid enough to propel me forward, even if the turn-based combat wasn't quite deep enough to capture my attention.

I suppose the responsible thing for me to do here would be to not recommend the game. After all, while I didn't find anything particularly wrong with the game, it failed to capture my interest all the same. But the time I did spend with the game... it wasn't bad.

个人推荐度：3.5/10
我相信我不是第一个因为游戏玄学命中率怒打差评的玩家,毕竟抛开游玩体验来说，整个游戏的故事背景和玩法都还蛮吸引人的。大部分差评玩家不是因为游戏太难打差评，而是游戏本身的数值设定太恶心造成游玩体验极差才怒打差评的。

毕竟连最简单的easy模式，这游戏的命中率也没有任何的提升。体验最糟糕的要数法师，其次是弓箭，然后是各种加强技能（比如战士的强力打击）。想象一下，当你费尽心机将敌人诱拐至陷阱处准备来一次法术洗礼，却连连遭遇谜之失败，就问你气不气？说好的回合制策略游戏，却不能用玩家的聪明才智碾压敌对npc，这完全看脸的谜之判中，简直是非酋的噩梦！

The music fits the genre and while the story is pretty linear it is a good story. My own complaints are the inability to see find side quests. I did not like having to backtrack through every town and city after every event to see if I am unlocking side quests. Otherwise the game was fun straight up through the end.

The storyline makes it enjoyable, there is some suspense at to what happened to the main character as he does not know what happened to him at the beginning of the story, and of course he has to eventually learn his ""destiny"" along the way.  I played  it in English, and can comment about the quality of the voiceover for each of the characters of the game.  The variety of accents makes playing immersive and enjoyable.  The music is very good, well balanced and creates the different ambiences found in the various locations of this game.  In general the visuals, musics and character voices, all the art found in this game, are well polished and enjoyable.  I have not tried to play the game in the other languages that I speak and are available, so I am not able to comment at this time on the other language versions.  

The game system is good but repetitive.  It is a turn based game, so you have time to think and react to events as they unfold and you can refine your tactics over time, as the characters in your party evolve and pile up their capabilities.  The progression path is quite straightforward, easy to handle.  The characters that attach to your party will, like you, have basic capabilities that will progress over time, but you cannot change the path your are taking.  You are either a spellcaster or a fighter, with some various flavours.  Combat is a no brainer, but you need to learn the various aspects of the ""wheel"" that appears around the characters when you mouse over them.  Aside from that, it is not complicated as you chose your combat actions from there. 

Now here is my only negative comment.  The interface is somewhat clunky.  When moving a character in combat, you have to be very attentive to the way you move with the mouse as you may end up in a different hex than the one you intended to and your path may put you in harms way even if you were trying to avoid a precise space along the movement.  There are some moments of frustration while playing through the game because of that.  Also, the use of the action ""wheel"" has to be precise, in order to avoid doing a different actions than the one intended.  Even though it is annoying, it is not a deal breaker.

战斗机制方面则是很经典的战棋，并没有太多的惊喜，错综复杂的技能机制和能力属性效果需要细细研磨才不会浪费每个人物的经验和在战斗中显示自己独特的战斗风格。而多种有时有用，有时根本就只会给自己提供负面buff，但有时却又是取胜的关键；让人在每次按“V”之前都要慢慢的思考一番。

 [spoiler]奈牧的结局挺让人难受的。 [/spoiler]





 ——————————通关感想——————————

[spoiler]时隔三个月，算是把它打通，从选项来看估计是有两个结局。一个杀死最后的大法师另一个则是相信大法师，那时我怀着对奈牧的死的愤怒毫不犹豫地将其斩杀，过了一段通关动画；我才发现黑色守望的真正含义：

我们维护的不是什么爱与和平，没有为基层人民和奴隶争取任何东西。人类对蜥蜴人的迫害还在、人类对精灵的歧视还在、奴隶还在...我们都做了什么？我们救了贵族、救了奴隶主、救了封建制度的所有上等人士。我们名留青史却只是在贵族的记载中，在普天百姓我们只是维护奴隶制度的工具罢了——即使我们的同伴也有奴隶。我们维持了现状，维持了这个恶臭的环境。

我突然想起，把奈牧杀的或许不是那两个奴隶主，杀掉他们并不能改变什么。我们或许应该要相信的是那个“低语之神”。我不知道我的选择是不是杀了更多像奈牧这样的人，我不打算改变我的选择；但这更引起我的思考。

毕竟，改变总比一成不变好得多，只是我们开始前进了不是吗？ [/spoiler]",1577521188,1596017249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

DSA Fans (Pen & Paper) Finger weg von diesem Spiel, denn es hat wirklich abgesehen von der Welt in der es spielt NICHTS..rein GAR NICHTS mit den Regeln zu tun die ihr kennt.
Für alle nicht DSA interessierten, es ist ein recht anspruchsvolles Spiel mit dem klassischen ""wer hat den dicksten"" Syndrom.

LAAAANGE Version:

PRO:
- Die Spielwelt ist an das Aventurien aus dem Pen & Paper Spiel schön angelegt und die Gespräche sehr schön.
- Die Story ist bisher recht spannend und passt zu dem Regelwerk
- Die Kämpfe sind anspruchsvoll, so dass man das nicht hirnlos drauf los kloppen kann.
- eine recht brauchbare Entscheidungsfreiheit (Gut und böse entscheidungen)
- Nicht nur Mainstory gebunden, sondern auch Nebenquests die man einfach zuerst erledigen kann, aber auch nicht muss.
- Rundenbasierte Kämpfe sind für diese Art Spiel einfach perfekt.

Contra:
- Man hat eigentlich gar keine Wahl seine Chars zu killen wie man lust hat. Das Spiel schreibt einem ziemlich genau vor was man zu skillen hat, um eine bescheidene Chance zu haben.
- Gegner sind nahezu IMMER zuerst dran und reduzieren mit Fernkampfwaffen und Massenzaubern schon mal einiges.
- Gegner treffen eigentlich FAST IMMER. Mega übertrieben und das trotz Waffenwert 18(maximum) und Kriegskunst 18 (Was gewisse Boni geben soll)
- GRÖßTES Manko.... Die Helden werden bis auf den Starthelden vorgeschrieben. Es ist definitv schöner sich seine ganze Gruppe komplett selbst zusammen zu stellen und somit direkt die Skills zu verteilen wie es Sinn macht.
- Die Grafik ist arg in die Jahre gekommen
- Das Spielesystem hat wirklich nur GAAAAAANZ WEITLÄUFIG etwas mit dem eigentlichen Pen & Paper Spiel zu tun.
- Die Kämpfe sind aufgrund des schlecht umgesetzten Regelwerks sehr schnell langweilig, da die Helden stets die gleichen Fertigkeiten benutzen.
- Es gibt viel zu wenig Fertigkeiten und die es gibt sind oftmals sehr schlecht umgesetzt und auch schlecht ausbalanciert.
- Man wird dazu GENÖTIGT ab Kapitel 4 in nahezu fast allen Kämpfen Gifte benutzen zu müssen, da man sonst gar keine Chance hat. 
- Gegner haben IMMER alle Heiltränke und Zaubertränke und benutzen diese gerne.
- Zusätzlich (ab Kapitel 4) bekommen die Bösewichte auch noch Heilkristalle die man erst zerstören muss, damit die Gegner nicht zusätzlich noch jede Runbde geheilt werden. ZIEMLICH ALERN.

Wichtig.:
Unbedingt einem Zauberer den Zauber FORTIFEX beibringen. Der wird euch in vielen Kämpfen hilfreich sein, um zu überleben.
Und bitte Leute.... nicht auf die Tastatur hauen, wenn ihr bei einem Kampf zum xsten Male neuladen müsst, weil die Gegner einfach alle sowas wie Chuck Norris sind....also ALLE.


Fazit:
Das erste Kapitel war echt nett, aber ab dem 2. wird es echt unrealistisch und übertrieben(vor allem wenn man DSA spielt). Nach den ersten 10 Stunden habe ich hier noch eine Kaufempfehlung geschrieben. Diese kann ich nach nun mehr 40 Stunden und dem fast zu sehenden Ende des Spiels leider nicht mehr geben.
Das Spiel schafft leider eine permanene Frustration und erhöht den Aggressionspegel.
Daher.

-Pros: 
Good skill selection makes for good tactical variety.
Decent enemy variety.
Lots of content, albeit repetitive.
While I don't feel like replaying this game myself, I do see that a lot of people on the forums tend to do multiple playthroughs.  So, I assume that for some, this game has a lot of replayability.  

-Cons:
The game lacks direction in a lot of places.  The quest log and world map can do very little at times to let you know what you need to do to complete quests.  For some, it tells you right where to go, who to speak with, and what city they are in.  For others, it just says ""Find so-and-so"".... and you end up travelling through half a dozen different cities talking to every person trying to see if they will trigger the dialogue you need.  It also lacks direction in some of the battles.  The devs seem to fancy making ""puzzle like"" map variations, meaning their are things like levers, traps, drawbridges, etc... on certain maps, that you need to figure out how to navigate.  The problem with this, is that there is very little direction when you are tossed into a battle with a unique puzzle associated with it.  other than highlighting the different interactable objects, the game tells you very little such as ""If you let the alligators on this map eat 4 or more meat, you auto-lose"".  And with battles that can take a half hour or more to get through, its very frustrating to have to start over just because your objective wasn't clearly laid out.
The ""miss chance"" has been discussed in most negative reviews about this game.  You miss A LOT.  And every time someone brings this up, some nerd explains that its because of dice roll, blah blah blah.  I don't care, and I don't think most others care about the math behind why you miss... If there is nothing we can do about it, that doesnt solve the problem.  It's simply not fun to have such RNG aspects of your combat.  It's fine to have stats you need to achieve to be effective in combat... but it becomes frustrating when you also have to deal with hidden dice rolls on so many different aspects of those stats.
Lastly, the gear/loot system is quite lacking.  It very well may be a personal preference, but I like min-maxxing, finding and comparing gear stats... working towards upgrades, etc...  This game does not really do much in that regard.  Despite there being an armor merchant in every city, and gear drops for a majority of the battles... all of the items are the same.  You will have the same 15-25 pieces of gear/loot drop from the beginning of the game, til the end.   I ended my playthrough wearing the same Leather armor set on 3 of my heroes, that I got in the first quarter of the game.  There are a few ""named"" items that drop, but most of them are situational and barely any better than the other bland items that drop.  If you like being rewarded occassionally, with a fancy piece of loot for your hard fought battle... this is not the game for you.  And its a bit odd... the potion/elixer/poison variety is tremendous... there are probably 20-30 different ones.  I simply wish the same attention was given to the armor and weapons.
I was looking forward to playing Blackguards 2, but after finding out that it was released merely a year after this game, and reuses 80% of the assets, maps, items, I lost my enthusiasm to do so.  I have decided to jump into a different series until the taste of this has left my pallette a bit more.  Hopefully now that it has been a few years, we will see a Blackguards III, that actually makes improvements and expands on the concepts introduced in the first game.

Система прокачки интересна, но вместе с тем СЛИШКОМ МАЛО очков дают за бои, даже не за убитых противников, как в пошаговых Final Fantasy и прочих играх, а сугубо за бои и квесты. Интересная реализация местности, НО В ТО ЖЕ ВРЕМЯ КАКОГО ЧЁРТА в самом начале боя лучница стоит на островке, окруженным водным течением и чтобы через него перебраться нужно упасть с шансом в 75%? Мне нужно разбить блядский кристалл , чтобы вражеские существа не хилились каждый ход, но чёрт побери, я не могу это сделать, потому-что в самом начале боя расстановка просто ублюдская.

Ein für mich negativer Punkt ist allerdings der Schwierigkeitsgrad.

The series is based on the German Table-Top RPG game 'The Dark Eye'.  Their first Dark Eye game was 'The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav' followed by 'Memoria'.  Those two games were directly part of the same story line.  This game is not a continuation of that story line.  I have yet to finish this game but have not currently found much of anything that ties it together with the other games.  The first 2 Dark Eye games were point & click adventure/puzzle games.

Though this is marketed as an RPG it's main focus is the Turn-Based combat.  That isn't necessarily bad but there's hardly any RPG elements.  You are not free to explore, you can only click a few options available as quests open up.  

There's no random encounters to help you build your skills it happens exclusively through quests so if you didn't spend your points the right way at the beginning of the game you might have a great deal of difficulty moving forward.  The combat RNG is terrible.  Almost every battle I was in I was using attacks that had a 95% chance to succeed and yet about 90% of the time they failed.  That means replaying the same battle many, many times over again till you can finally beat it because RNG was not on your side.   The battles feel very slow as you wait for some 10 characters to make their move in some battles.  There doesn't seem to be a way to fast forward that so you can just get on with your next turn so there's a l lot of unnecessary waiting.  The story was semi-interesting but because the battles need so much repeating and take so long you tend to lose the story element and forget what's happening in the game other than you are fighting.

Towns and wilderness areas cannot be explored.  Towns are just a scene that let's you click on a few merchants or occassional quest givers but all contained on the same screen (usually anyways... there are a few places where an arrow to another part of town is available).  You exit the town only to  a map and once you click on a destination you will enter either another town or a hex map for battle.  As soon as the battle ends you're back to the map.  The mechanics of the skills and equipment and everything is a little confusing and requires a lot of time to fully calculate the best options.

The graphics to the game are okay, but I wish there were a few more customization options for picking your specific characters looks and attributes in the creation menu.  The background sounds and music are okay but nothing that I love,  I don't hate it either but it's kind of meh.  The voices are well recorded but I find some of them to be a little annoying with heavy fake-y sounding accents.

There are quite a few achievements available but I found it hard to progress in the game so I hardly got any of them so far.  Some are tied to story/chapter progression while others are based on certain actions, in-game events, and other  milestones.  It seems like a nice mix of types of achievements but it seems like the type of game that will take a lot of time to get all of the achievements and possibly multiple play throughs.

At just under 10 hours I'm just shy of 1/4 of the way through the chapter progression so I believe the game very much could be 40 hours at least.  Considering how much of the time is spent re-trying battles I'm not convinced it's the most enjoyable way to spend 40+ hours and it could easily be longer than 40 hours.  If you playthrough in 40 hours though that makes this game about $0.25/hr of gameplay.  That's really good if you enjoy the game and you can find it on sale from time to time for an even better deal.  However,  I just didn't feel it was offering me the most enjoyment for the time I put into the game.  I'll continue playing from time to time especially to work towards the rest of the achievements but I can't say I'd recommend the game to anyone who wants to play it based on liking Daedalic's previous two Dark Eye Games.  I also don't think it's a great Turn-based RPG so I can only recommend it if you absolutely love RPGs and find this on a deep sale.


UPDATE AFTER FINISHING THE GAME:

I still don't like this game it took FOREVER to finish because even if you are using a good strategy your RNG can be so bad that you keep failing and having to repeat the same fight dozens of times before you finally win.  The story aspect does pick up a little through the later half of the game but not as much as I'd like.  You get to start making some decisions and choices in the last 3 chapters that can change the ending of the game but, most of the choices seems to be empty choices that have no real effect in the game other than occasionally skipping a fight.  The additional battles in the DLC pack add a little more interest and some opportunites for additional Adventure Points (AP) but unless you really love playing this game it doesn't add much more than extended play time.  For achievement hunters and completionists this game is a nightmare.  About 30% of the achievements are bugged and cannot be obtained.  Some are not available unless you pretty much play through the entire game (or at least after chapter 2) twice.",1571387409,1579760866,False,13,0,0.637354731559753418,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Tactical combat, deep character skill / attribute development
I recommend reading skill descriptions and abilities thoroughly, because its very easy to spend points on skills and get no actual benefit, I suspect that's why other people have issues with this game.

Story is pretty straightforward and graphics are decent, lots of places to visit, game is linear with side quests which I recommend doing for extra xp.

If you make characters jacks of all trades you are literally fucked. Don't spend all points on 4 different weapon types, pick 1 then perhaps 2 down the road if you must, also investigate into attributes which is big factor.

There are fights that are difficult, use environment to your advantage, this is huge, and don't let yourself surrounded. Sometimes kiting enemy's is only way to survive even with 1 health point left.

The game is only fun if you make it to be, otherwise you're into lot of hard times. I already beat Blackguards 2 so I am familiar with the game mechanics. 

If you like challenge, try this game.

虽然游戏以战斗为主，但是游戏最大的长处就是设定在了暗瞳世界，这是一个德国非常流行的RPG系统。这是一个次魔幻世界，其中的角色都不能算是拯救世界的大英雄，有时候甚至都算不上是英雄。但是这个设定对于游戏非常重要，因为这种类型的游戏并不单单取决于故事和游戏世界，同时还取决于设计和游戏机制。
游戏的设定，故事和设计同一些残酷的剧情想辉映。故事的前提就是主角是一个贵族女儿的朋友，却被陷害成为杀死她的凶手。主角同一些伙伴逃出来，被监狱的法警四处追逐。游戏中，你小队成员的爱人还曾经被法警抓住，你可以选择是否去救她。

坚实的战斗系统和游戏其他部分相结合给玩家提供了一个优秀的游戏体验。比如救人的时候，如果你太慢，目标就会死亡，但是关卡的设计又让加快速度变得非常困难。为了获胜，你可能要分散整个团队，这样非常危险。这款游戏激励着我，让我玩的非常用心。这是一个了不起的成就。
游戏整体的战斗系统都设计的非常好。如果你想进入一个木匠家中进行偷窃，你会发现陷阱变成你最大的敌人。这种设定在有些时候又变得很乏味，比如在一个任务中，你必须重复杀死27个不停出现的僵尸。
更重要的是，如果战斗设定过于困难，就会让人觉得游戏的难度会有起伏。比如，在游戏中的一场角斗士战斗中，野兽会随机决定是否去吃食物，如果食物被吃完，那么就会在结束的时候杀死一名主要角色。这些情况都过于随机和困难。我最终完成了这场战斗，但是我认为这种类型的战斗会让玩家失去继续的渴望。

但是，《黑色守卫》确实在表现上可以给玩家很多动力。对于战略RPG来说，游戏的节奏非常好。游戏的长度对于每个人都不同，但是基本上都会有20-30小时的游戏内容。游戏的画面非常清晰，艺术风格也同游戏的设定相辉映。同时游戏也提供试装的选项，让你可以看到装备和武器在你身上的样子。配音也良萎不齐，偶尔还会变得非常糟糕。
不幸的是，角色培养系统却同游戏其他部分格格不入。升级点数分配被5个角色信息页面分隔开。每个角色的升级时面对的都是一些令人迷惑的选择。而同时你经常会因为一些小错误而毁掉整个队伍。通常RPG中角色培养是最有趣的的部分，但是这款游戏的系统让角色培养变得令人难以满足和迷惑。

我真希望游戏的角色培养系统没有如此糟糕，那样的话我就会毫不犹豫的推荐这款游戏给任何玩家。但是角色培养在RPG中非常重要，这款游戏的角色培养系统非常糟糕，直接影响了本来很优秀的一款游戏。",1570693388,1703482076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This review was really tough for me, I honestly wish there was a ""meh"" option. But ultimately I've decided its on the lower end of meh, thus I cannot recommend this to the average person. This game is one where its player must be highly tolerant of glitches and general wankery. I thought I was that person, I play a lot of eurojank, and I played the steam ports of the first 3 fallouts without the patches. But apparently this game was my limit.

To elaborate further, the biggest glitch I run into is that this game seems to lock up about every 5-7 loading screens, requiring a restart, which is pretty frustrating, but not a dealbreaker for me, thats only a few seconds. And then another bug after another after another. Another one that stands out was where I lost a battle because my final two characters who were both at full health got knocked down, not out, by a spell that did 4 damage. Ordinarily this would just mean that they would get up after a turn, but the game for whatever reason decided that I had lost, requiring a restart of a rather lengthy battle. The third and final standout was one where doors wouldn't open. Cutscenes are also pretty frequently bugged as well, overall the game is in need of a bit of love.

On to the review proper.

Story/Setting: A lot of people are touting it as the games main draw. I'm inclined to disagree, the story is a fairly standard campaign length rpg module kinda story. If you've played any tabletop you'll know what I mean. The setting itself isn't as alluring as people make it out to be either, I don't know if its just this games portrayal or not, but the Southlands kinda seemed like a Forgotten Realms esque generic fantasy place, designed to be malleable enough that you could run into anything. I mean, the systems main play setting is literally called ""Aventuria"". This is probably a personal thing, but I usually prefer my fantasy settings to have their own flavor, aesthetic and themes and stick to them (think Lordran, Middle-Earth, the Witcher) The story itself is basically a flavor of the week apocalypse cult. Its not bad by any stretch of the imagination, its not memorable either, you'll probably be a step or two ahead of where the plot wants you to be. It also seems to be going at the angle of a morally grey group of adventurers, kinda of a rougeish band, but it never really delivered on it. I never felt like I wasn't doing the right thing, I never even felt like I was doing something that morally grey.

Characters: I'll put these guys in their own separate category because the characters are much better than the story they are in. Each one is a lot of fun, and is pretty colourful, even if none of them are very ground breaking. Even the MC seems to have a personhood thats completely independent of you. Some interesting combinations you don't see too often like a pothead elf and your bizzaro aristocratic wizard are nice touches and pump much needed life into a standard fare story.

Non-Combat Stuff: Navigation is a series of menus, going from one place to another on a world map is watching a dot move, going through cities is essentially just a series of option menus and dialogue boxes, dungeons consist of clicking on what room you want to go to.

The Dark Eye RPG Adaption/Combat: Its... okay. I read early on that you had to build your characters very specific ways to make them viable, which is true enough I suppose, maybe its the German half of the family but I had little trouble intuiting how to do it. Magic doesn't play as huge a role like it does in DnD and pathfinder, which are my standard fare, which is fine by me, and I usually had by mages doubled up as marksman, which is what they were doing most of the time. The talent point thing was a little confusing at first, but I began to understand it with time, I can imagine its a pain in the ass to do on tabletop though. I had all the details open in the battlelog because I like to see what is making me miss. Speaking of missing, I don't really understand if its just a bug, or something the battlelog isn't reporting, I seem to miss often in spite of rolling well under the target number to hit an opponent. Which leads into my next issue, the battlelog itself has a few issues with how it conveys information, and a  lot of the time it seems like I can't tell whether its trying to tell me the chance of something happening, or not happening. 
My biggest issue is with the initiative system. There are several encounters in the game where you have things rapidly dropping in and out of combat, and frankly, this system was NOT designed for it. For example, in one mission you have to fend off giant flying lizards harassing some poor sucker in the swamp in the last act of the game, the lizards leave when they take over a certain threshold of damage. But they come in random numbers at fixed intervals, and this is where the problems start. They come in at the end of your turn, though sometimes in the middle, and get a free action, then next turn starts, and they get another action. So you have something dropping in and getting two free hits on an escort mission, multiplied by up to three spawning simultanously, and you have basically no way to plan against or prevent it except praying the numbers roll lucky, and that isn't a a good thing.

Role-Playing: Basically non-existent, you have a few choices about how nice or mean you are, doesn't do much of anything, other than maybe affecting the loyalty of a single companion.

***DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME***

I have been gaming since the 80's floppy disks. This is by far one of the most frustrating games I've ever experienced. I'm not sure of the system they use to determine hit %(random number generator from what I read) but the system is absolute TRASH. I've never seen so many spell and hit failures IN A ROW when the chance to hit is 90-95%. Oh but I'm supposed to take in to account the enemies skills and buffs?.... How do you explain those same failures on buffing yourself? LOL 2-3 times  in a row spell failure buffing yourself at a 75-90%???

This does really apply to the AI enemies it appears. 

The only reason I've slogged this far was that I paid so little for this game. Im winning and advancing but man is this tedious and not fun. I've found myself laughing in disbelief after spell and hit failure streaks. I think I continue to play just to see how often my characters fail. Maddening.

  Il y a de bonnes idées, c'est certain. Des critiques portent sur les graphismes, mais à mon sens, ils ne sont pas moches non plus. Pour un jeu au tour par tour, avec des combats sur grille hexagonale, c'est même plutôt relativement joli. Et de toute manière là n'est pas le principal (dans un tout autre registre, je joue toujours aux Combat Mission et là, ça pique, pourtant c'est toujours un régal !).

  Non, le principal, c'est l'histoire. Or, l'histoire, on s'en bat vite le plexus (ou autre chose, à chacun ses vices !). Le principal, ce sont les personnages. Sauf que là, les personnages on s'en contrefiche vite l'escarcelle (ça ne veut rien dire, mais ça sonne bien pour un jeu médieval-fantasy). Alors quoi, le système de jeu ? Ben, c'est pas si mal et c'est là que sont les bonnes idées, avec quelques trucs sympas quant aux options de combats, aux techniques que peuvent mettre en oeuvre tel ou tel personnage selon les armes qu'ils tient, etc. Malheureusement, ça fait peu alors qu'on attend justement une alchimie entre une histoire dont on se souvient en cours de partie, des personnages auxquels on s'attache. Juste un système qui pourrait le faire pour un jeu d'escarmouches.

  Pour ne rien arranger, c'est très punitif, trop au regard du défaut d'âme. Pas d'équilibre et même en facile, certaines étapes doivent être répétées avant, enfin, de trouver le truc. Quand en plus le hasard s'en mêle, là aussi, de trop. Plus j'ai avancé (au-delà d'une soixantaine d'heures, quand même !) plus j'ai compris que c'est finalement très rigide. Il n'y a pas toute une flopée de solutions possibles. Il faut faire ça comme ça été prévu. Point. En conséquence, au fil des heures, ça perd en intérêt. On ne cherche plus à ""inventer"" la manoeuvre qui va fonctionner, mais à se focaliser bêtement sur la seule manière qui fonctionne. Un peu comme d'ouvrir des portes côte à côte. La première est pas bonne, tu recommences. idem pour la seconde. Tiens, la seconde s'ouvre sur la victoire. T'as gagné. Super. En résumé, au bout d'un moment, ça devient casse-bonbecs.

  Le joueur n'est pas créateur de son histoire.

  Autre truc agaçant, cette fois-ci à propos des personnages... J'adore quand il y a des tas de stats, que je me perds dans les compétences, les qualités, les points de savoir en cuisine kramkrout (un pays dont tout le monde ignore l'existence, Conan l'a visité, mais c'est une autre histoire), ceux pour l'habileté à combattre en tutu de mailles avec une hache à un bras (pour ceux qui en ont perdu un). Donc, là, il y a de ça, n'empêche c'est ballot d'arriver relativement loin dans l'histoire et de se rendre compte que bah en fait,  on a complètement raté un personnage ou deux en les ""montant"" avec des capacités qui ne servent pas à grand chose, voire plombent le potentiel du groupe pour tel affrontement. Et comme il n'y a pas 36 manières de gagner ces affrontements, on commence alors à réaliser que pour avancer sans que le jeu devienne crispant, il faudrait tout recommencer du début...

  Je n'irai pas à la fin du premier : trop fastidieux sans la moindre satisfaction. Encore une fois, l'intérêt pour une histoire ou l'attachement aux personnages pourraient atténuer les défauts. Mais comme il n'en est rien... Pourtant, j'ai vraiment tenté d'apprécier. Je suis d'ailleurs revenu dessus après deux ans d'interruption ! Je testerai peut-être le deux, mais sans conviction. 

  Pourquoi le pouce bleu ? Sans être un bon jeu, comme je l'écrivais en introduction, il n'est pas mauvais du tout. Il y a quand même du travail de la part des développeurs, ça n'est pas bâclé. Et puis, cela peut plaire à certains joueurs. J'ai la certitude que le côté ""puzzle tactique"" peut séduire. Je comprends d'ailleurs ceux qui apprécient et l'expriment ici. Reste qu'il n'y a pas d'excentricité, de folie. Le pouce bleu parce qu'il n'y a pas moyen d'en mettre un gris.

There are RPG-Lite elements, but the focus of Blackguards is the hex grid turn based battles which are abundant. I have logged 60 hours according to Steam,  but only about halfway thru the game, so there is a ton of content here. Normal difficulty is difficult enough for me - I seriously considered quitting and starting over when I got to the Louse Queen, but finally got past her. 

The artwork gets the job done.The 3D charactor models are about the same quality as Skyrim, which is to say not great. The females are downright homely, although your DonJuan-like mage will say she is the vision of beauty.

It starts out very linear, but I like how the game opens up later to be more of a sandbox style world. The battles are very challenging but not impossible with proper preparation. I like the in-combat movement and tactics.

Then the game feels like it was designed by someone who doesn't want any player to ever win it unless they know the RPG system in their sleep. I gave up in Chapter 4 when enemies never missed (or so it felt like), always got the drop on me, and outnumbered me in every battle. Sorry but that's just not fun at all. Plus, how is one supposed to survive Cold Shock (level 4) + Lighting (Level 4) + Wrath of Elements (Level 4) + 6 snipers firing at you before you even get a turn! And, if I do I always hit like the enemies appear to do? Or course not, I got like a 50% chance of my spells working even at level 18 in the spell, which means you pray to the RNGGoddess that your spell goes off else you will not survive turn 2.

Overall I quit when it became pray to the RNGGoddess that you even survived turn 1 and that your attacks work and that you can even live long enough to make the numbers manageable. I feel that for the developers to improve this game they need to:

-TONE DOWN THE FIGHTS.  Seriously. Not every battle needs to be 10 vs 5 and they get the drop on you and can KO 2 of your characters from full health before you even act.
-Add a way to grind in the game. Right now there are a fixed number of fights, so you can get stuck as there is nothing for you to grind on. 
-Make sure enemies don't feel like you are fighting everyone with 18's in all stats. That is what it felt like in Chapter 4.
-Enough with the enemies doing 1/2 my HP in one hit. Too many encounters in Chapter 3 enemies could hit for 30 HP and my max was 54. And they did this constantly.
-Make sure the mechanics apply equally to the enemies. I felt like they didn't as the number of times an enemy actually missed on an attack was really low, to the point I felt like they got 99% hit rate no matter what their skill was and my parry skill was.
-You need to completely redo how your characters are added and removed from the party. Right now the only way to have a chance at this game is to know in advance who leaves and who dies, as there is no good replacements for those that go away. Maybe give the player a choice of a couple people they can add? As it is I feel like the game really wants you to be an archer, but that is not communicated to the player when they create a character, which makes the character creation choice what I call a false choice as choose anything else...good luck. 
-The wound system needs to be removed. I've never found it fun once it was added in Drakensang and it is still not fun here. Time to axe it in my opinion. 

Overall with some changes the game could be fun, but right now it is just frustrating. I'll just go play more Blade of Destiny instead (the 1993 version), at least that game was balanced with this same RPG system (or at least better balanced than this).",1568395225,1568395261,False,32,2,0.694071650505065918,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This was a hard game for me, especially in the beginning to mid game. It takes some patience to get through. It might just be me, but it felt a little bit too unbalanced and unfair for my liking. I wasn't really sure how I was meant to build my character and companions and didn't fully understand how the levelling system worked in the early stages of the game.  

Then the tough battles started to happen and plenty of those you will hit the try again button, I admit I got quite frustrated because I just wanted to win first time, every time, but that wasn't the case for me. It's all about that learning and what you can do better from the first time you tried the battle. From there on I did start to enjoy it. After learning from mistakes and learning the battlefield, you tend to do a little better each time. I stuck with it, because I knew I could win, it was just a matter of when.. haha!

Learning more about how the levelling system worked, gaining new gear, understanding combat, I felt like I was making progress. At the same time I was really growing to the characters and enjoying the dialogue between them all and how the story was unfolding. Not the greatest of stories but still Ok. It was good to have plenty of content throughout and I put more hours in than I ever thought I would, granted that I did retry battles quite often.

Overall, I enjoyed the game. It was great getting to the end and finishing, even though it was quite tough. I really love turn based games. But for me, this felt like you have to be quite hardcore turn based gamer to really enjoy it from start to finish.

It could be a great game. It would have the potential to really be good, but it is just puzzling why the developers mess everthing up so much. 

1. The game doesn't explain anything, and it is not easy to figure out. There is a tutorial, but it does not help in any way.

2. You are totally left alone on how to skill your character. It is no help that you ONLY have a SINGLE way of upgrading EVERYTHING. Only AP and you can skill everything with it- That leaves you at a total mystery to WHAT actually to skill. 

3. The fights are not self explaining and you don't get to know why you do damage or not or how much or which type of damage is good against certain enemies or stuff, you might be supposed to just try and error i guess. Come on! Really? Guys. 

4. Even smallest actions like using bandages or potions is extremely difficult and NOT explained. No hints or tool tips and if they are there, they are sometimes more misleading than anything. It just is really annoying if you take hours to even figure out the handling of the game. To heal another character? Not so easy at first, as your mage always targets himself. Eventually you might find out that you have to right click your other champ and then use the healing spell... why does the game not explain things like that to me in the first place? It is not only with this one thing, but with EVERYTHING in the game.

5. I stopped the game now when i have a fight where i want to save the baroness. It tells me what i have to do, but only for a fraction of a second. I cannot read the text because it is only visible for maybe 0.15 seconds. If i could read that i would maybe work as a secret agent for MI6 or something. So i dont know how i can save that bloody baroness at all. The game does not want me to know i feel. 

6. This has nothing to do with games having a steep learning curve, as i am really into games that take a long time to figure out, look at those paradox games f.e. HOI or Crusader Kings are not easy to learn as well, but it never gets this frustrating like in this game here.

7. The fights are just WAY to hard. I can not win against any of those i have left open right now with normal difficulty. I could switch to easy diff, but i have my pride as well. Besides, i dont want to play noobishly without knowing what i am doing at all. I wanna have a strategy and see how i can improve my quality of play. Nothing is possible here, because i can see that it would take me like 20-30 hours more before i would get to the point, where would start to understand what i am supposed to do here to optimize a stategy or to even know what is useful here and what isn't.

They have really messed it up on the possibility to create a really good game. This is what adds to the frustration: The game itself is there, one can see that this game could be really great, but the developers just fell short and missed out on some essential and crucial things. As a result, it is just no fun to play unless you are a real expert on this ""dark eye"" thing maybe.",1565809185,1565809415,False,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I have tried playing it off an on for a couple of years and recently uninstalled it because life is too short to waste on things you do not enjoy and being endlessly frustrated is something most sane people should not enjoy.   

I have played some brutally difficult games in the past but when you combine random roll with brutal difficulty it really turns from a feeling of challenged to a feeling of relentless punishment. The game basically forces you to play certain encounters over and over again and no amount of pre-planning and strategy will save you once that dice starts to roll the other way since the deck is stacked against you to begin with. At least with other difficult games you have a chance to counter the challenge with some level of skill but when it comes to random dice rolls...can't do much except face plant into the keyboard.

I have had encounters where your front line tanks are basically all poisoned within 1 round of engaging in combat (and this poison causes knockdown, which makes your tanks sitting ducks) and pummled to death over and over again. Your casters are then put into a position where they have to spam heals and dispel the poison (so your tanks can just get off the ground), which does not help because every npc has the same poison on their weapons and they just reapply it next round. 

I mean I get it...it's a hard encounter but man...there is a zone between fun, hard and frustrating and when a game gets you to the point of frustration almost every time you pick it up there is something wrong with the design. I think this is especially true if you have obligations outside of playing video games and don't have time to replay encounter numerous times. I am sure I would have been less critical when I was 10 years old and had all the time in the world. 

So I guess I do not recommend the game if you got adult responsibilities and are more of a casual gamer. If you are hardcore I am sure there is some sadistic part that might appreciate it and if you are in between I would imagine you might go back and forth between quiting and coming back to it. Having said that, any game that forces you to reload this many time has something terribly wrong with it. Besides the whole point of video games is to give you a break from the day to day grind...which is pretty much this games defining feature...I guess what I am trying to say....might as well go to work...at least you get paid for the pain and suffering :)",1564909961,1564992208,False,2,0,0.505843102931976318,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sam system Dark Eye był dla mnie nowością, ale grało mi się w niego przyjemnie - niekiedy jednak wielokrotne pudła przy 90% celności frustrują. Blackguards ma słabo wyważony poziom trudności, początkowe walki są niedorzecznie trudne na posiadanych bohaterów i dostaje się potężny łomot. Dalej jest zdecydowanie lepiej, w miarę jak drużyna rośnie w siłę kolejne potyczki idą gładko. Niestety same starcia są na dłuższą metę nudne, jest kilka modeli na krzyż (zabij, przebiegnij, naciśnij).
Fabuła... jest. I w zasadzie tyle. Nie wadzi, nie wybija się.
Postaci - prywatnie bardzo polubiłam główną szajkę, każdy z nich ma trochę inną osobowość i ciekawie się razem splatają. Co do innych postaci pokochałam Latające Lisy, a zwłaszcza ich liderkę.
Humor jest dużym plusem gry, nie jest nachalny ani głupawy, raczej cyniczny i w tle. Nie wybija z rytmu.
Muzyka jest w porządku, mimo niewielu ścieżek pasują klimatem do gry i stanowią przyjemne tło.

I sort of expected an isometric CRPG, but this game was quite different. The battles take place on a hex grid map, with an isometric view that can scroll through nearly horizontal to vertical; towns are basically a menu disguised with an animated scene with the various service NPCs dotted throughout; the rest of the game takes place in maps and character sheets. Not quite what I was hoping for, but the trimmed down, simplified gameplay works just fine if you're not a CRPG purist.

The combat system might also take a bit of getting used to. While largely the DnD/d20 inspired combat system you might expect, magic is still different enough that you'd want to familiarize yourself a bit before committing to it. My first character was a mage, and finding out that most spells are tied to specific attributes was a rude awakening when my mage was utterly ineffective since I spread her attributes and spells too thin all around.

The devs did make a few concessions to take away a few things many players might expect, such as removing a home base or storage space. The whole premise is that you're a party of fugitives on the lam, so you sleep where you can and keep only what you can carry. It's a little annoying at first, but you grow to appreciate the detail when you keep getting ambushed by bounty hunters and a determined lawman.

The one thing that makes playing this game a chore, and why I can't recommend it in its current state, is that it keeps freezing. I believe it's because Blackguards is an old game not optimized for today's OS, and the dev stopped supporting it. The game will freeze up at the worst of times, and since it's on permanent fullscreen, I have to resort to opening up a new desktop and running Task Manager from there to shut down and restart the game.

Позволь представить твоих заклятых друзей, этих бесславных ублюдков:

-  Дварф  пироманьяк, сторонник теории заговоров,  считает все зло в мире от драконов. Критику в свой адрес не воспринимает, как контраргумент в дискуссии использует секиру. Любую ситуацию считает подходящем поводом для драки. В магазинах предпочитает расплачиваться ударом той самой секиры.
 
 - Маг балабол, с его слов ""гений, аристократ, плейбой, филантроп"". По факту толстоватый увалень без гроша за душой,  не пропускает ни одной юбки. Любую ситуацию считает отличным  поводом  завести непродолжительные романтические отношения. Как способ оплаты предпочитает деньги ...ТВОИ... добытыми кровью и потом деньги. 

- Полуэльфийка  наркоманка, плотно сидящая на системе. Любую ситуацию считает отличным поводом  вырубить покурить косячок. Из за долгов и зависимости предполагаю что чаще всего за запрещенные вещества расплачивается натурой. 

- Краснокожий дикарь, себя считает воином племени, по факту бесправный раб-гладиатор с голой задницей. В любой непонятной ситуации  кричит  ША! ТЕ! МА! или притворяется что не понимает языка бледнолицых. В магазинах предпочитает чтобы его не продали в рабство... опять.
         
 - Подруга детства, та самая с  которой у тебя то ли что-то было или что-то будет, а может быть и нет. Роковая женщина, женщина загадка и ответ на эту загадку тебе вряд ли понравится. На любой вопрос уходит от прямого ответа, меняет  тему разговора. На шоппинг лучше не брать, цветы и подарки не дарить. Можно надеть железный намордник чтобы слушалась.

As an RPG it's railroaded, there's a lack of interesting NPC interactions and nothing you do seems very meaningful. As a turn based tactical game it's... fine, I guess, but it's nothing special and the combat really starts to feel like a chore. There are no random encounters and little, if any, variation to the scripted ones - this isn't a game that's going to reward replays (after hitting chapter 4, I restarted with a new build just to see if that was the reason for my lack of fun. For me, it wasn't.) The story is okay but nothing special and there's a lot of people saying things that don't seem to mean much - it may mean more to someone already familiar with the Dark Eye universe, but it doesn't feel like a good introduction to it.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Though not immediately intuitive, I really grew to appreciate the way in which characters are upgraded.
[*] Story was OK.
[*] Semi-ability to pick missions. I like the feeling of progression when previously unwinnable battles becomes doable (assuming you reload after you realize the battle was too hard for you to initiate).
[*] Though I typically prefer games where I can define my team from the start, as opposed to games where unique characters with set roles join ready-to-go, there was good synergy between the characters (assuming you built them somewhat competently).
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Internet (or extreme patience via reload) is required to navigate through story dialogue in a way which will result in the preferred outcomes for your party. Some people like RPGs where ""choices-matter"", I don't really. I play to build a team with great synergy and to experience fun tactical battles, not to guess as to which dialogues the develop wants me to pick to make certain characters stay with my squad. YMMV of course.
[*] Damage and even spells are only successful (in a binary fashion) based on RNG. Of course, you can raise these chances by raising the corresponding stats. I prefer softer methods of implementing randomness.
[*] Unless you plan on playing this game more than once, you do kind of need to read some spoilers in building your party, as [spoiler] a character you plan on filing a certain role dies at some point [/spoiler]. Pretty irritating actually.
[/list]
Overall: I really enjoyed this game, particularly the level-up system. You can get it super cheap (I think I got it for 2$) and more importantly I think it was good use of my time. (Though it seems I may be in the minority here, so read other reviews carefully).

This game is frustrating as hell.  It's confusing as hell.  It's just...well, actually pretty fun once you get used to it's FRUSTRATING AND CONFUSING SYSTEM.

That being said, allow me to explain if you are seriously thinking of playing this game.

The stats are convoluted as hell, it's really hard to know just how effective boosting something is by the ""AP"" points you get from every battle.  Also AP are ""Adventurer Points"" ...why they didn't call it EXP is beyond me considering that countless other systems refer AP as Action Points.  But then again this game tries so desparately to be different sometimes it's almost cringey.

I was struggling a lot at first because I had no idea what to prioritize when it comes to character building, but it seems you build heavy into weapon skills along with one page of skills that revolves around passive effects like ""Willpower"" and ""Battle Knowlege"" and stuff to basically not cripple you when you get injured (because Injuries will screw you over).  Then just pile up onto base stats for a while till you find the right ""Trainer"" to boost various skills like ""Armor"" and ""Dodge"" and knockdown...  or spells.

Combat usually comes when you have your spell casts bombard things while your melee guys position around some vantage point and spam knockdown/deathblow/powerblow (after knocking down) and then it's pretty rinse and repeat for the most part but pressing V at the beginning of the battle to see what's interactable.  Once you get a hang of your battle strategy (with some variations) and get into the habit of fishing for side quests and stat buffing - the storyline starts to become much more manageable and the battles a lot less impossible.

But I think this is where the beauty and disaster of this game comes from, it tries really hard to be different, almost too hard.  Whether it's the ""Drugs/Sex/Rock and Roll"" incorporated into the storyline or it's the need to make the system as ""different"" as possible from traditional RPG or Tactics games it just takes some getting used to.  The cast of characters are alright though sometimes will leave you  internally screaming ""WTF"" especially with one of the mages.  Some of the characters are just downright awful.

So if you take time to play this game, be prepared to try to understand it's weird system and maybe get the gist of it, it's the only thing that will help you survive the playthrough.  I had fun with it, but only after the 2nd attempt when I stopped trying to play it like other games I knew.

I started out liking this game: played the Demo, bought it, put in another 20 hours or so. Instead of being tactical, you end up playing a battle 5 times, figuring out the trick or gimmick to winning, then moving on. It feels completely unsatisfying. The game is always punishing you for not knowing what comes next, but really giving you no clue as to what to expect. The whole game is based around save scumming. 

There's horrible RNG for spells. Even with 99% chance to cast, your spell will fail 5 turns in a row, and then you restart hoping to get better luck next time. Mage's feel really lame in general, and are basically just there to buff your fighter. The whole system is pretty obscure and takes awhile to learn, and when you do, there's just not enough to feel satisfied.

Also, there's really only an illusion of character creation: you're pretty much railroaded into a limited number of choices you need, because gameplay is so rigid.

It's not that I don't like challenging games: I've played x-com iron man on the most difficult setting. I've done the same with Divinity. It's just that the challenge here isn't really fun.

I guess many people have bought Blackguards expecting something, which this game is not. Honestly I have no clue why reviews bash both Blackguards 1 & 2, because both are actually pretty good games. Sure, it would be nice to move camera freely, but it's not really even needed. Would also help, if game would guide and tell you all the basics, but it doesn't. Yes, both games are unforgiving and sometimes it may feel unfair. Blackguards is one of those games, which first forces you to learn how everything works. For the same reason experience is either rewarding or plainly frustrating (pretty hard to play ""chess"" without knowing rules).    

So, don't buy this game, if you expect sweet motherly hand holding (with kisses and honey pancakes). Do your research and then things won't be that hard. It's really the pre-setting for enjoying Blackguards. Otherwise... Well, just don't play this game.

If you have any background with pen & paper RPGs  or in general patience to learn, then with given fantasy setting, you might like this game. Otherwise, maybe, you want to play some other games (nothing wrong with that either). Blackguards is just not for everyone, but those of us who like tactical, puzzle like, old school battles and decent story. Well, then this game is a gem, which is honestly worth of playing. 

I wouldn't put too much value on negative reviews, because most of them seem to miss what this game is all about.",1553702519,1553998253,True,1,0,0.536679506301879883,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First time played. 

This was a very fun RPG with tactical combat.  Yes most of the story is there just to link combats together, but the combats had a good variety of elements and variation to keep me interested and thinking.  Some were very difficult, particularly in chapter two, when you need to fight 3 combats in a row without resting up in between.  For added variety, there were also a number of backflashes where you need to fight solo, or with a friend from the past.  Overall an enjoyable game. 

The story was good and really surprised me with a twist or two. The cut scene animations were decent for an indie title and rendered, not QT, so your characters actually are wearing the armour that they are dressed in. 

The learning curve felt a bit steep at first.  Really the first chapter is learning the game and second chapter lets you hone your fighting skills.  By chapter three, where the world opens up with a myriad of side quests, you're armed with comprehension and understanding to take on the world.   

A fun RPG if you have the time to delve into.

보아하니 TRPG 원작인 것 같은데 그래서 그런지 캐주얼함은 많이 배제된 느낌입니다.

TRPG의 아날로그적 감성이 강하게 남아있다고 해야 하나??
설명하기가 굉장히 미묘한데요...
걸그룹 음악을 기대했는데 돈 내고 까보니 트로트 노래가 나와버린 느낌???

스킬을 적극 이용하는 전투, 성장하는 맛이 확실한 캐릭터 육성, 다양한 아이템을 파밍을 기대한다면 실망이 클 수 있습니다.
쓰고 보니 일반적인 TRPG에서는 대체로 만나기 힘든 특징들이네요.





전투 :
다른 분들이 이미 많은 평을 남겼듯 운에 좌우되는 경향이 짙습니다.
지형지물을 이용할 여지가 많아 전술을 구상하는 재미는 있는데 그 이후엔 공격이 죄다 빗나가버리니 상당히 맥이 빠집니다.

마나에 여유가 부족해서 스킬을 자주 사용하기도 어렵습니다.
이게 나쁘다는 것은 아니지만 저처럼 캐주얼한 전투를 좋아하는 사람에게는 단점으로 작용하게 됩니다.
평타만 툭탁대고 있고 그나마도 잘 맞질 않으니 전투에 재미가 없어요.

스킬 없고 용병이 고정 선택된 킹스바운티 하는 것 같았습니다.





캐릭터 육성 :
TRPG 원작이라 그런지 캐릭터 육성에서도 다른 게임들과는 조금 차별점을 띕니다.
레벨이 오르면 능력치도 쑥쑥 성장하고 그에 따라서 캐릭터도 강해졌으면 좋겠는데 그렇지가 않습니다.

무기 숙련에 포인트를 투자해야 평타를 비롯해서 공격이 강해지는데 이게 또 굉장히 불편합니다. (물론 이것도 취향의 차이겠지요)
무기 숙련도에 찍으려고 포인트를 모으고 있자니 다른 배우고 싶은 스킬들도 많아서 근질근질하고, 꾹 참고 모으고 있자니 갈수록 적은 강해지고, 그렇다고 가만히 앉아있는다고 포인트가 굴러들어오는 것도 아니고...

자, 어떻게 스킬포인트를 잘 모아서 스킬을 배우려고 한다?
스킬을 가르쳐주는 NPC를 찾아가야 하는데 여기서 또 짜증이 납니다.
스킬 NPC가 여기저기에 여럿이 있는데 어느 NPC가 어느 스킬을 가르쳐주는지, 또 어느 NPC가 어느 마을에 있었는지 알 수가 없습니다.
결국은 스킬 하나 배우자고 마을을 하나씩 다 들어가보게 되더군요.
따로 메모라도 해야겠던데요.





아이템 :
아이템 파밍하는 재미를 느끼기가 어렵습니다.
거의 없다고 봐도 될 것 같습니다.
장비아이템에 희귀도라든지 부가 옵션이 붙는다든지 하는 개념이 없습니다.
같은 이름의 장비를 얻었다면, 그냥 완전히 똑같은 장비를 얻은 겁니다.

그렇다면 종류가 다양하기라도 하면 괜찮겠는데 그렇지도 않습니다.
10시간 정도 플레이를 했는데도 장비템을 착용 부위마다 많아야 4종류밖에 못 본 것 같네요.
같은 장비템만 수십 개씩 얻은 것 같습니다.
이는 캐릭터 성장의 더딤으로 이어져 캐릭터 육성에서 재미를 느끼지 못하는 또 다른 원인이 되기도 합니다.





결론적으로
스킬 쓰는 맛이 있는 전투를 원하거나
캐릭터를 키우는 데에 큰 재미를 느끼거나
디아블로식 장비 파밍을 좋아한다면
딱히 재미를 못 느낄 수도 있습니다.",1551121091,1551121091,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

После пары боев стало понятно- почему.

Есть такой вид игр, где основа - это одни бои. Т.е. взяли рпг и выкинули оттуда хождение по локациям и вообще всю красоту - осталось только боевая система и прокачка персонажей. Игры такие делать проще, и главное - дешевле.

Похожий пример - BattleChasers. ну где то в таких играх есть работа художника, где-то совсем чуть чуть, но суть одна - бесконечная череда боев.

Игры такие прям полноценно увлечь меня не могут, но в формате ""шашек"" на 20-30 мин вполне годятся. 

########

Ощущения от игры после пары часов - интересно. бои идут неодинаково, у персонажей много вариантов прокачки. в плане собирания доспехов тоже выглядит вкусно.

########
8 часов

У игры очень хорошие диалоги на отличном англ языке, которые сопровождаются субтитрами на русском. Неплохой юмор. В целом это серьезный продукт, и над сюжетом действительно работали.

########
20 часов

Бои не повторяются и авторы сделали все, чтобы они были разными. Регулярно попадаются противники кот удается одолеть только с 5-6 попыток. Трижды думаю перед инвестициями очков прокачки :)

Чтобы герой прочувствовал разные классы, по мере прохождения в компанию подкидываются разные помощники. В общем интересно.

########
Пришлось начать игру заново - уперся в непроходимый бой. В общем совет - ваш герой должен быть мультиклассом, совмещая лукаря и например мага. Лукари почти всегда попадают, стреляют через всю карту, и в затяжных боях почти всегда забарывают противника.

########
Итак 27 часов. Идея переиграть игру была правильной - довольно быстро добежал до того места где застрял и легко прошел дальше.

В общем, чтобы AI выглядел сильным, бои в игре в некотором смысле предопределены. 
Т.е. разработчики пошли по такому пути - в этой точке у игрока будет столько опыта, поэтому будет интересно выставить такой набор противников.

Этот подход сразу срезает тех, кто потратил очки развития не на нужную ветку :)
Ну или просто недостаточно мудро их потратил на умения, которые не совсем работают в игре.

Отсюда два варианта - либо читать советы, и вникать в тонкости развития персонажа ДО игры. Либо переигрывать изза своего упрямства. Ну или бросать.

В общем, прокачав правильную ветку, прошел большинство боев с первого раза, и понял суть :)

Совет №1. 
Все маги должны уметь стрелять из лука или арбалета. Или скорее все лучники должны уметь подколдовывать.

Совет №2.
Самое полезное, ну и самое дорогое по развитию заклинание - создание тени. Его можно купить и книжечка с ним доступна очень рано. Это явно подсказка от разработчиков. Без него крайне трудно будет

Совет №3.
Прокачивать несколько видов оружия смысла нет. 

Совет №4. 
Прокачивать персонажа полезно в такой последовательности - оружие - особ умения - сила воли. Т.е. маг с луком будет пользоваться луком чаще, чем особыми умениями или там заклинаниями.

Совет №5.
Броня. Тут мутновато, но в целом, чем больше в броне составляющих, тем она получше. Я пользуюсь кожаной для магов-лукарей, и морионом для наурима.

Совет №6.
Побочные квесты игнорировать нельзя, т.к. это опыт, а без него можно просто застрять в игре.",1550364526,1554068987,True,8,0,0.597891390323638916,0,True,False,False,False,,,

CONS:
- Countless hours of retrying the same brutally unfair battles, especially in the first half of the game (even on Normal difficulty).
- Barely enough characters to be able to build a strategically viable party (and some of them will leave without warning, breaking your whole strategy!)
- Experience points (AP) are very scarce (you cannot train by farming xp)
- Many skills and spells are completely useless, wasting points into them will break your game.
READING GUIDES FROM OTHER PLAYERS IS A MUST! Or you'll have to learn by yourself and reset your game twice like I did...
- This game is all about making choices, and some will make you miss the best items. My OCD got hurt in every hour of play.
- Worst ending I've ever seen in a game (kill the boss, useless video, no explanation, credits...)

PROS:
- Nice, dark, deep and cruel world based on a D&D-style role playing game, with countless moral conundrums
- Many situations made to trap/ surprise the player, forcing you to innovate through chaos to survive. :O
- Many cool puzzles... though you'll have to die 5 times to understand how to solve them!
- Nice skill mechanics, giving many character build options, but not all are viable...

So yeah, very nice and original game, with extremely frustrating moments. Eventually you'll get tired of playing and rush to make it end, then the ending will disappoint you... -_-

La difficulté et bien normale, n'écoutez pas les commentaires de joueurs peu patients. 
La personalisation des PJ est inmense ce qui donne un plus de rejouabilité. Chaque personnage peut se spécialiser, ou pas, sur pleins de talents/habilités en faisant des tas de combinations. Un healer/archer, un tanque/piégeur, un guerrier avec lance all off spécialisé en attaquer depuis le deuxième rang protegé par le tanque, un mage spécialiste en booster le tanque/lancier et qui peut bloquer le terrain avec des mur magiques, un chasseur/archer/verineux..

Facil à jouer, difficile de maitriser. Un PJ dans un champ de bataille a tellement d'options qu'il faut vraiment songer et planifier tants les mouvements, comme les upgrades. En pleine bataille, que faire avec le magicien? Je tire avec l'arc, j'essaye d'enchanter un ennemi, j'attends voir que font les autres, ja lance un heal, je change l'arc par le baton pour avoir plus de régeneration de magie, je mets du poison dans mes flèches... Avec le guerrier, j'attends, je charge, j'attaque avec un coup puissant, ou bien une finte rapide.. Peut-être pourrais-je reculer et poser un piège dans une case stratégique...Peut-être le meilleur serait de reculer quelque pas avec le guerrier et le mettre en mode défensif, ainsi je pourrais aussi chopper quelq'un qui essaye de passer a mon côté pendant que le magicien lance un spell qui me permettra d'avoir 2 actions les tour suivants...

At the moment, overall and recent reviews are [i]Mostly Negative[/i], and I'm not entirely sure it deserves that. Some of the common criticisms are: 'it's too hard,' 'rng's completely unfair,' and, 'it's too repetitive.'

It can seem a little difficult early on, and a lot of times you feel outclassed by opponents, but as you play, your characters catch up pretty quickly. I think anyone with less than 10 hours who complains about it being too hard possibly just didn't get far enough.

Same with the rng. Early on, your characters' basic level abilities and spells combined with enemies' higher level stats, gear, and skills means certain kinds of attacks just aren't hitting as often as you'd like, but it's definitely not broken. If anything, the rng is a lot kinder than table top tends to be. No, [i]broken[/i] rng is something like Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny, and this is nowhere near.

As far as repetition, that's kind of up to the player. You can potentially have three magic users who can be taught all the same spells, and two physical combat specialists you can teach the same exact skills, and that's certainly a recipe for monotony. Having magic users specialize a bit in different spells, and meat heads in different skills and weapons - not to mention actively using items like traps and poisons - spices things up a bit. But yeah, characters tend to use their most powerful and reliable skills and spells, but that's true of most any game, isn't it? I thought the developers did a pretty decent job of mixing things up with traps, hazards, enemies, objectives, and subtle differences in map design. Out of all the encounters, I can only think of one that I thought was really badly designed. Anyone who enjoys table top games will probably enjoy it. 

Still, the game does kind of drag at times. The story's odd and relies on a number of cliches. 
Also, I ought to mention that the UI could use another pass. I don't know what's wrong with it, but occasionally I spent way too much time wrestling with it trying to equip an item or gear on someone.

然而游戏不合常规，没仔细研究规则玩可能会出现越来越难的情况，恶心人的命中和施法成功率会会造成打赢容易或者艰难获胜，甚至打赢和打不赢全靠运气。

以下是给打算攻略又不想多走弯路的童鞋的一些提示：
法师很重要，但法力值和法力恢复的限制，不适合用法术作主输出，最多用来补刀；
施法成功率与角色相关属性和法术等级有关，优先加属性点学习被动技能比直接加法术等级更重要， 尤其是魔法恢复的被动，前中期保证加血的法术成功率就可以，后期补充buff和debuff技能；
加速3级魔法除了增加速度外还可以增加每回合一次行动；
解毒3级在中期某些战役里面十分重要； 
很多buff和debuff法术4级是全体范围的；

关于大多数人吐槽的佛系命中的问题，如经常出现90%的命中率，但实际命中率目测可能50%不到，这是这个游戏最坑爹的地方，也是劝退的主要问题。
攻击时显示的命中率并不是实际上的击中率！因为除了命中目标后还要算格挡率，然后闪避率，只是战斗记录上面没写而已！格挡每回合只能有一次，闪避也在多次被攻击也会相应降低，所以多个角色同时打一个人实际击中率会上升。攻击丢的20面色子20点必定丢失，弓箭手19和20点必定丢失，所有攻击1点必定暴击，丢到1点还是会继续算格挡和闪避率的，所以命中率95%实际击中率也是隐藏起来看不到的，至于连续丢到20点三四次的也是常有的事所以命中率不高的情况下游戏体验真的不是一般的差！

关于武器的问题，又是一个恶心的点，极度不平衡，首先伤害最高的是双手武器，伤害最高的主动技能是3倍锤击，能用3倍锤击的武器只有双手武器和斧头还有锤子木棍，这就限制了武器选择。你可能会说了，其他武器有其他的优点，是的，单手剑可以用除了3倍锤击的所有的近战主动技能，匕首击剑长矛可以破甲，长矛还可以攻击范围有2格，但是重甲敌人是在打后期才出现的并且数量有限，虽然佯攻可以破格挡给队友制造机会，但是除了3倍锤击外每一个伤害是够看的，也不是3倍锤击这种一锤敲死大多数敌人这种战略技能可以比拟的，水晶每回合加血？没问题一锤敲死了不用回血了，开局没打中？重开战役锤死一个然后对整个战局影响都是不同的，就和弓箭手三连射优先灭一个一个道理。一个3倍锤击让所有武器都黯然失色。然而这里推荐单手斧头和单手锤子，双手武器虽然伤害很高，但是命中率低到很难看，对法师上buff要求很大，在后期还有别人上的冷冻4级毒4级四肢酸痛等等命中也很佛系，单手锤子在真么多debuff也才60%70%命中。 单手锤子还能上盾，格挡增加很多，反而很使用。双持武器在用主动技能的术后不触发，双持伤害很迷，中期打骷髅每下50，60的伤害高得不像话，后期打普通小兵伤害才个位数，不过很少用双持，可能有其他路数，不过相关属性点都满了伤害才个位数有点不可思议。

总的来说锤子或斧头配合盾牌是最合适的近战组合了。虽然锤子和斧头都没有什么好武器，数据没有一点是突出的，前期的两把好一点就锤子就是终极武器了（矮人用他自己的就够了）。

游戏最强的输出是弓箭手，三连击秒小兵，7连击秒大型敌人。需要注意的是前期加入弓箭手中途会离队，由于游戏设定职业转型很难，如果么有弓箭手的话整个战略层面就会出现问题，这也是一个劝退点。如果主角不是弓箭手的话，野人的初始属性就很适合转弓箭手，且加入时候有一定自由分配的ap点数。

游戏早期发售的时候大妈版通关了一次，最近又在steam通一次，才发现游戏的支线原来这么丰富，多得很意外，需要花的时间比主线还长，以前通关才20小时甚至不到，现在竟然用了40多小时，差不多全支线任务了，很多支线任务没提示没标记，要一个个去点npc发现任务，还有不少支线需要前置任务。

支线对整体剧情没什么影响，什么有些支线剧情很坑。辛苦救了个路人回来，然后发现是野人的奴隶主然后为了复仇把救回来的人杀了；收集6个神像密码最终帮女巫师启动仪式造人造人，过程却及其顺利完全没有战斗，造了个完美的男人然后和女巫师两人幸福地生活了，没有奖励。。。。。。只是最后女巫师觉得完美男人太完美顶不顺。还有很多类似的莫名其妙的支线，玩支线任务硬是把策略游戏玩成冒险游戏了。。。。。。探索感很强，然而这游戏真的有龙，而不是矮人瞎说的~。当然有些支线会找到很重要的导师和少量特殊武器，除此之外多数是没什么用的奖励和没有奖励。",1548648912,1548648912,True,1,0,0.517045438289642334,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Игру купил по скидке, только от этого мне не так обидно. Вкратце опишу ваш путь по игре(постараюсь без спойлеров). И так начинаем с выбора класса, всего их здесь 3, что меня уже расстроило,ибо начальные характеристики  толком не поменяешь как тебе нравится и придётся, если нужно, качать их позже. Начинаем мы с достаточно глупой завязки, мол мы убили принцессу( хотя при нас и при страже её убивал какой-то пёс), нас сажают в тюрьму. (казалось бы КАКОГО БЛЯТЬ чёрта!? Разве пасть волка хоть как то может походить на человеческие удары ножом или хоть блять чем то, задумался я тогда в начале, забил). Как и в любой другой рп мы набираем команду, как всегда , конечно же, ни с того ни с сего, и ведём наш путь расследования и осознания произошедшего. Выбрашившись из тюрьмы ты ожидаешь открытый мир, полный задания ""принеси-подай"" и нарываешься на проблему... Мир разбит на города и перемещение в них происходит необычным образом(динамичные картинки на которых расположены нпс). Ладно подумал я, боёвка вроде ничего и с предметами можно взаимодействовать, продолжим. Тут, просто так, игра захочет усложнить вам прохождение, противников станет больше, и они станут сильнее( это заметно по хп), не знаю зачем, но это сразу почувствовалось. Побегав и повыполняв задания(а это стоит сделать, ибо всё стоит как золотом шитое), набравшись сил, вы будете двигаться  по сюжету, который построен ну очень странным образом, всё завязывается на каком-то имени, суть которого до конца игры вам будет и не ясна, что вообще отталкивает от сути сюжета и как бы просто ведёт тебя по миру. Зачем то покидаем наш край, спросите зачем,за нами гонятся?Мы в розыске? Я сам не знаю, в городах не нападали, по дороге не встречали, ходил за нами какой-то дурачёк с бомжами,нападал, больших проблем от него не было, и всё. Покикув край мы тупейшим образом попадаем в плен к работарговцам. И тут начинается адская жопоболь этой игры. На этой стадии показывается вся несбалансированность урона, а уж тем более яда. Урон скаллируется невероятно странным образом, вы можете нанести как 2 так и 25 урона с одного и того же оружия(да это крит, но всё равно это не нормально, как по мне). Яд играет в игре просто сногсшибательную роль, но только против вас, так как у противника он нанесён,а вам нужно его каждый раз наносить в бою, за это время можно равносильно нанести урон. В итоге противник не только берёт вас чаще численным преимуществом но и наличием повышенного урона за счёт яда. Но это не было бы так ужасно, если бы на арене не было 9 ,мать его, уровней, который просто доебали до горячки своим пофигизмом. Врагу было абсалютно всё равно на ловушки, не он же блять игру проходит, а просто пакостит, в итоге, бесконечные переигрыши и построение точного маршрута на каждую драку. Выбравшись с плена вас, как мяч об стену начинают бросать в сюжет, понятное дело, вы отскакиваете, но разработчику всё равно, он просто пальцами пытается затолкать вас в историю. За всё это время вы должны овладеть какими либо навыками, половина которых бессмысленна, а остольная не отличается от обычного удара ничем, кроме 1% шанса сбить с ног. По итогу мы ходим в зад вперёд как идиоты, ничего так и не узнав,  берём какой-то диск, всё узнаём( а могли узнать ещё в середине игры), и дубль 2. Опять непонятная, глупейшая затяжка сюжета на подобии арены. Так же противники стали сильнее, так же сильный яд, и НЕВЕРОЯТНО долгий путь, который меня доконал. Как итог, я так и не могу пройти эту игру уже 2 месяца, так как в это невозможно играть предварительно не выпив пару рюмок.
КРАТКИЙ ГАЙД: если вы обожаете рп и вам нужна игра, на(скудном) подобии дивинити, то по скидочке можно взять, в ином случае вас просто доконает так же, как и меня.

分类：策略角色扮演 
恐怖指数：0，非恐怖
是否剧情向：是（虽然剧情很老套无厘头，而且结局很敷衍）
性价比：100%
这个游戏总结起来就八个字
玩法很赞，结局很烂
根据官方分类本游戏属于黑暗之眼系列（The Dark Eye）
买的Daedalic - Gigantic Bundle 14款游戏共计32元 平均一款不到2元
这个包我最先玩的这款 为什么呢 因为自带简中 而且我好久没玩这种回合制战棋类了 
根据官方图片 这游戏的玩法一看就很吸引我
回合制和华丽的技能以及满级后的质变（技能等级高了不仅施法成功率高而且最高级有质变）
人物培养的自由度极高（法师也可以培养成弓箭手甚至近战肉盾）
因为战斗影响因素很多
初期可能不是很好上手
但是打到后面因为我主角选的猎人职业
小型怪3连射秒掉 大型怪7连射秒掉 （真的几乎就是秒）
最后BOSS战根本就是随便打打
所以一定选猎人（弓箭手）主角 法师前期蓝量以及施法命中率根本不够看 战士中后期根本别想切脆皮 近身都是个问题
另外这个游戏的可操纵的人物精灵弓箭手剧情第二章最后死了 后面就没有弓箭手了 所以一位中后期的弓箭手主角太重要了 而且前期没有弓箭也无法和一些地图元素互动 （比如马蜂窝必须用弓箭射下来）
缺点：[spoiler]女性人物建模太丑 伊利诺和奥瑞利亚的面部3D建模都贼丑[/spoiler]。。。
结局太平淡。。。[spoiler]主角回到孟戈比拉扫地去了[/spoiler]。。。不过也许天性散漫的主角适合这个结局。。。
另外还缺个战斗加速功能 一堆僵尸走的贼慢我都烦起来了
还有 成就有BUG 有9个成就有BUG出不来的。。。而且官方一直没有修复。。到现在这么多年了都没有。。。
成就狂魔请参照指南里有一篇英文的暴力破解全成就。。。
另外 如果不玩支线的话 游戏流程真的是巨短 第一章还可以 第二章最长 然后第三章 第四章 第五章都很短。。。。
支线总时间比主线还要多好几遍 挑战性也比主线高得多。。。所以我很无语。。。有这精力咋不去做主线。。。
推荐去玩支线 很有意思 支线里有很多独特的战斗 多逛逛就能找到很多意想不到的支线任务
我是把所有支线全做了的
另外我在评论里看到了很多BUG 
我也遇到过 直接人物选择施法时卡住不能动 导致要重来 以及法术范围错误。。。
还有有些敌人能穿过自己设置的陷阱 但是有些敌人不行。。。不知道为什么。。。
总之还行吧 实际上原价也不亏 不过这波折扣下来 原价的不就亏了不是么 哈哈哈",1547958444,1555061370,True,5,0,0.602667450904846191,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I didn;t get achievment for saving Aurelia, even tho she stand by my side till the ending. NPCs appearing 2 chapters too early? Yep. Useless Tomes? Well, not as long as you need money. Giving you the only rogue in the game and killing him without any possibility to save? Totally. Oh, and if you save, be careful, because the game loves to write on ur latest save. Some spells should have 2 hex radius, but no, in some positions it's just half of a circle, refusing to shot all targets (even if they are standing on plain ground, next to each other).

Something about spells
4th lvl of fire shot completly useless since it prefers to hit chair or chest than enemies. Or ur friends even if they are further.
First 3 levels of lightning bolt seems to stay for 3 turns, so you get ur 3k points to develop it and what? And it just disappear after one hit, going to the closest target. Thankfully 4th lvl is usable somehow. 
Poison skills seems nice on paper too, but in the end it appears to only deal poison type damage, not by turn. Sleep from this skill almost doesn;t work also... so you will find it completly useless.
If you develop ur great fireball to max lvl, you will be disappointed too. It deals around 20 dmg only to target in the centre, 4-5 dmg to the rest.
In the end it's all about descriptions. In my opinion, they are bad.
Oh I had one more problem. In one part of the game I couldn't complete the level, because one of the mages used blizzard instead of any spell I casted, even with 0 mana. It just drained mana with nice 4th level blizzard effect, but without dmg...
The same for our little friend with axe. Sometimes I couldn;t destroy crystals or fight the dragon, because the game started to see his melee axe dmg as... fire dmg. Guess what, dragon and crystals are fire resistant.
There should be any mechanic letting you to get closer to higher value described in spell. In fact maxing anything after learning spell gives you only bigger chance to hit the target...

Charisma should be giving us more choices, but I can;t feel it.

I miss having life bar with all statuses in one place, so I can at least read my buffs and debuffs while waiting for very SLOW enemy moves (especially if you used blizzard on snails or ghouls). Instead I had to run around bars jumping in the que.

Sneaking parts are one of the most annoying, not sure why somebody implemented it with such a bad mechanic. AI is dumb as hell, entering all ur traps, fire etc. Not even mentioning that traps work just one way, so AI can run through 5 their traps without any problem, but trap will damage them if I step near one.  Ending dissapointing... it's more like there wasn't any. I bet someone had a lot of great ideas, but it looks like something happened in the middle of creating. Out of money, skill or what?

After developing ur champions in wrong way, you might get stuck in the middle of the game or at the end without any possibility to restart your points and complete the game, so choose wisely.

Not sure if it is pros or con, but anytime you restart the battle, it might go different way, because enemies will use different spells on different champions. It might be your 1 in 20 (restarts after first enemy turn) chance to not give up, but try again :v

I find not being able to let you decide where your trops will start as a big con. They could at least give a skill letting us swap between each champ. A mage starting as frontlane near 3 1shoting him enemies and tank being placed some tiles to the left or back, enough to not gather their attention made me reset so many times, just to let mage run away or heal. Frustrating.

As pros, it have some interesting solutions. You need a tactic for some enemies, certain species of weapons or spells. There are many levels that you need to pass with brain. Game let us end some levels with bruteforce or by thinking well. I find some graphics just lovely. Many portraits for enemies (but still not enough).

In the end, it's good for first few hours. Then you are starting to get a little irritated, then loading screens, then bugs and then you just decide to keep playing just to bring it to the end. The end that looks like written on the knee in bus.

Still, I was having fun like 30 hours before I got to the point ""I just want to end it finally"", so it's not that bad. If not mentioned bugs and wrong descriptions (did I say, that some pros getting by developing stats are not even mentioned? leveling up cleverness helps targeting enemies with spells for example) it would be very good game, but now it's just average.",1547001160,1547004307,False,4,0,0.590394675731658936,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I like RPGs in general, but this one isn't really a RPG in the widest sense of the genre. It's more a tactical game, that's round based, with some slight ""RPG"" influences. Still the game isn't half as bad as the script is going to tell you. The game has a lot of shortcomings, which makes the game not very endearing to hardcore RPG fans.

It's not as grindy, which is pretty good, as some other titles - yet it also lacks the real charm of a game that wants to draw in the player. Yes you can develope your character, but it's not as deep as it could have been... the roles of the characters are... well chosen, but still not as versatile as the game wants us to believe. In general the whole game has some gaming issues, that disqualify it being it a classic RPG...

Deadalic creates a lot of really good games, some of them are classic gems like the Edna Series, or Deponia. This game isn't classic, and it isn't perfect - I even doubt that it's good... and another time where I have to mourn about the missing ""informational"" option on recommendations... It's by a small margin a not recommended, mostly because it plays like the now discontinued series of ""DSA-Junior"" or ""Aventurien-Junior Edition"", which was created in the eighties, with more ""youngster"", ""Teenies"" or ""Kids at play"" scenarios...

Another thing that was kind of a let down, for the game was the ""casualisation"" of RPGs... sure, it's a game on rails, and that's what you can bemoan... but for the story of the game it surely is a plus... nonetheless, it's not my kind of game in general, therefore I can't recommend it out of personal bias...

もし主人公が魔法を使えない場合、一人の魔術師で攻撃・支援・回復魔法を唱えないといけなくなる。

O q compromete mesmo é a montagem do time. Q simplesmente não há. São aqueles personagens e pronto. Eu toleraria tudo isso se parasse por ai. O problema q mais irrita é o sistema de combate. É ridiculo. Com uma variação de dano absurdo. Um mesmo ataque pode gerar dano entre 3 e 16 (por exemplo). E o tempo todo varia absurdamente. O sistema de estatisca de acerto é uma piada monumental. O número q aparece não representa nem de longe a realidade. É quase impossivel acertar um ataque com 50% de chance. Em 3 ou 4 ocasiões cheguei a erra 4 ataques com 90% de probabilidade seguidos. A estatisca permite isso (não é impossivel), mas essa frequencia é absurda. A soma da variação de dano com os erros absurdos tornam impossivel q esse jogo não seja programado pra vc se dar mal. A occorrencia desses coisas esdruxulas aumenta significativamente perto do fim das batalhas. Além disso, é ridiculo a quantidade de vezes q seu ataque tira justamente um ponto de hp a menos do q vc precisa pra matar o adversário. Se ficasse por ai eu até poderia acreditar em ""teoria da conspiração"". Mas em algumas batalhas, quando sua estratégia encaixa, magicamente a ordem de ataque dentro do turno muda. Sem q haja qualquer mudança de status, clima, nada. Só muda. Seus personagens q atacariam em seguida vão mais pra frente na fila e SEMPRE aparece como proximo um mago adversario. Teve uma side q precisava vencer em 7 turnos q isso ficou ridiculamente óbvio (foi nessa batalha, no fim do 4° capitulo, q decide q minha analise seria negativa). Jogos de RPG em turnos são contruidos para q vc desenvolva sua estrategia de ataque. Planeje a sua sequencia antes mesmo da primeira execução (xadrex). Erros acontecem. Muitas vezes o q vc planejou não dá certoc por n fatores. Mas esse jogo extrapola. É impossivel trassar qualque projeção. Efim, se não quiser passar raiva, não jogue.",1546127434,1546127434,False,5,0,0.588153302669525146,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Также все три класса можно сочетать в разных соотношениях и каждого героя «выковать» на ваш вкус.
Очень приятна и разнообразна система шмота, зелий и ядов, а также оружия.
Каждая миссия уникальна, придётся обдумывать каждый ход, если хотите победить и победить красиво!
Особенно приятно играть магом, так как заклинания придают огромный интерес и разнообразие игре.
В основном впечатления положительные.
Глюки отсутствуют, минусов почти нет, разве что играя за мага некоторые ачивки не открываются (Воином играть не пробовал, но читал что за него ачивки открыть можно). Потом как-нибудь попробую поиграть за воина, но за мага просто намного интереснее.

Die Characterentwicklung finde ich sehr gut. Es gibt jede Menge Möglichkeiten, seine Party aufzubauen.
Die Geschichte ist nicht neu, aber gut und teils sogar lustig erzählt. Wie z.B. der ehemalige Räuber, der gern seinen Zeh  wieder haben möchte und gar nicht gemerkt hat, dass eine Niere schön länger weg ist.
Die Grafik reißt nicht vom Hocker und in den Städten wären schönere 2D-Hintergründe evtl schöner gewesen, aber insgesamt gibts nix zu meckern.
Die Musik ist stimmig, wenn auch etwas arg eintönig.
Auf den Kampfkarten gibt es oft diverse Interaktionmöglichkeiten. Hier Fässer umwerfen um Wege (kurzzeitig) zu versperren, Deckungsmöglichkeiten, Brennbareszeugs-/Giftfässer zum zerschießen oder auch mal einen großen Kronleuchter, der mal eben
2-3 Gegner zur Ruhe bettet. Man könnte auch Fallen stellen, macht aber mMn nur wenig Sinn.
Es ist wichtig, sich auf verschiedene Waffen, also Stich *und* Hieb zu spezialisieren. Z.B. sind einige Gegner komplett immun gegen einzelne Schadensarten.
Ich spiele auf normal, es gibt noch ""einfach"" und ""schwer"", wobei ich keine Ahnung habe was sich da ändert.

Spielprinzip:
man wandert fröhlich auf der ""Weltkarte"" herum und folgt der Hauptstory und nimmt diverse Nebenquests von den Bewohnern an.
Anschließend klappert man die Markierungen ab und schnetzelt sich durch die Gegner.
Teilweise gibt es mehrere Lösungswege wie durch Bestechung einen Kampf vermeiden.

Leider gibt es viele Probleme, hier ein paar Beispiele:

Eine Karte, in der keine Räuber entkommen dürfen.
Die Gruppe kommt zur Tür rein, steht aber seltsamerweise im Raum verteilt.
Je nach dem wer zuerst dran ist, ist die Karte entweder sehr leicht oder nicht schaffbar, weil einer der Räuber als erster, zweiter oder dritter durfte und einfach durchrennt.
Das gleiche gibt es dann noch mal später mit einer Alarmglocke.

Karten mit Iribaarslilien sind mMn auch extrem nervig. Wer hier nicht optimal geskillt ist und Glück hat, sieht ganz schnell sehr alt aus.
Das ist durchaus teils durch reines Glück zu schaffen, allerdings dürften viele lange vorher das Handtuch geworfen haben.

Auch schon sehr früh im Spiel, ein Duell als dritter Kampf gegen zwei Zwerge, einer mit vergifteten Waffen.
IdR ist man von den vorherigen Karten schon angeschlagen, was die Sache etwas schwieriger machen kann.
Auch schaffbar, aber idR sieht man erst mal sehr häufig das Menü.

Nervig fand ich auch den Arena Kampf über 3x3 Kämpfe.
Eine Möglichkeit zur Heilung gibt es nach jedem dritten Kampf. Ein Mitstreiter ist in den letzen zwei Kämpfen auch noch unpässlich und macht den dritten gar nicht mehr mit.

Ein Massenkampf mit einem fremden Magier auf eigener Seite, der sich für eine Feuerschleuder hält.
Dummerweise wirft der seinen Ignifaxius Flammenstrahl am liebsten auf die eigenen Leute.
Außerdem wiedermal eine Map, in der niemand der Gegner das Feld verlassen darf.

""Töte 27 Zombies"" (Gähn). 1 Karte, Flächenzauber wegen Haufenweise Deckung nicht möglich.
Stichschaden (Bögen) bringt nix, die Biester sind langsam, weil Tote Dinge eben nicht rennen. D.h. der Kampf ist nicht sooo schwer, aber allein deshalb schon sehr lang. Zombies hauen kräftig zu und vergiften dabei. Langweilig.

Karte mit Kampf gegen Waldmenschen, 7 Runden maximal Zeit.
Die Karte ist weder schwer noch irgendwie interessant.
Durch Fallen auf fast jedem zweiten Feld und viel Heilung und Gift ist das einfach nur dämlich und langweilig.

Karte mit Nekromant.
Auch nicht schwer, aber hier zeigt sich die AI von ihrer besten Seite.
Obwohl oben ein ganzer leerer Raum ist, läuft der Idiot an die Stelle, wo ich ein Giftfass zerschossen habe.
Ich komme wegen Untoter niemals an ihn ran weil die mich sofort einkesseln, es sei denn, ich bleibe in der Tür stehen umd schlage stumpf auf ihn ein. Trotzdem habe ich nach ein paar Runden gewonnen weil der Depp zur Tür und direkt wieder zurück ins Gift latscht.
Die Untoten kann man bekämpfen, bringt aber nix, die sind auf jeden Fall in der nächsten Runde wieder da.

und hier höre ich jetzt auf mit dem gemeckere:
Treffer/Zauber: hier ist es ein wenig wie bei XCOM: 60% Chance ist verflucht wenig. Selbst 97% fühlt sich noch sehr viel weniger an.

TL;DR:
DSA Fans und Leute mit Geduld können hier zugreifen.
Wer ""Die Nordlandtrilogie"" (1992-1996) oder Drakensang zu schwer fand, für den dürfte der Frustfaktor einfach zu hoch sein.",1542118365,1542118488,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

-Персонажи, достаточно банальные, за всю игру порадовала только полуэльфа наркоманка, тема зависимости очень редко поднимается в играх, а тем более редко сказывается на геймплее. В остальном, стандартная подборка , к примеру, ворчливый гном, маг бабник.
-Мир...игровой мир, это одна из страннейших штук в игре. Он огромен, карта впечатляет, но мира мы не увидим. Все перемещение заключается в тыкании по маркерам миссий по карте, иногда нас заносит в города, где на статичном фоне стоит группа персонажей с которыми можно потрепаться или поторговать. Все, больше мы ничего не видим. Т.е. игра в известной вселенной, но путешествия по миру и его изучение, не занимает даже 1% от игры.
-Боёвка. Самое важное в жанре, почти на ровне с сюжетом.  И это самое скучное в игре. Несомненно, интерактивность окружения это очень приятно: поджигание масла, утопание в болотах, подскальзывание на грязи, все это интересные геймплейные решения. Но сам бой - ближний бой вперед, маги и лучники назад ...все, и так вся игра. А причина одна - Кощунственное отношение к прокачке и скиллам. Как бы вы ни прокачивались, какие бы классы не выбирались, запомните, все сведется к 3 типам бойцов: Маги, Боец, Лукарь. Вкачаете ли вы героя в кинжалы, топоры, копья, мечи, и их подтипы, в итоге скилы будут одинаковые. Отсюда и отсутствие разнообразия, отсутствие множества тактик и вариативности.
 Спросите , что хорошего в игре? .эммм.....музыка? тут реально не плохое музыкальное сопровождение и изобретательный подход к битве с боссами. Все, больше ничего. Увы. Просто 30 часов бесконечных битв на аренах.",1540226628,1540226628,False,11,2,0.624423027038574219,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-inventaire lourd à gérer 
-cinématiques vraiment crades (mais osef !) 
-les combats ne sont pas clairs (on est obligé de passer la souris sur chaque unité pour voir les pv restant par exemple)
-quelques combats sont vraiment très durs et pas fun. Les maze par exemple
-après chaque combat on doit aller à l'hotel, au healer et remettre des flèches dans les mains des persos (il ne savent pas piocher dans le sac...)
-pas de coffre pour stocker son matos, on est obligé de tout vendre car il y a de grosses pénalités quand on est encombré. D'ailleurs je vous suggère vivement de tout vendre au même marchand, il fait alors office de coffre payant, on peut racheter le matos vendu si besoin sans chercher partout

Et des qualités:
-le système de stats et de skill est très complexe, il faudra chercher des infos un peu partout pour ne pas faire d'erreur car on ne peut pas resper. Ca peut être un point négatif pour certains mais pour ma part j'adore
-on sent vraiment bien la monté en puissance de notre groupe, surtout quand on débloque le Coup de marteau pour les guerrier et le Triple shot pour les archers

The story is overall not superior, but it does contain some plot twists and multiple cut scenes that while you progress further in the game fill out the story gaps caused by memory loss. If is especially interesting to find out what happened to you at the start and every character joining your party has some minor story and quest line to tell as well.
The gameplay consists of about 85% fighting on hex-based strategic fields, where in a turn based combat using either attacks of magic you have to either kill all opponents or finish some minor objectives like opening chests for more rewards after the battle or reaching certain hexes to exit the fighting area. The other 15% of the time are spent on the world map shopping, talking to NPCs for quests or spending skill points on your characters.

[b] Combat & Challenge : 8/10 [/b]
The combat is actually great in this game - its challenging, requires good tactical planning (on hard difficulty), positioning, decent build on your team and has a great variety of weapons and enemies to use them on. Playing it for the first time it may seem quite hard, since there are multiple different damage types with armor types against these damage, lots of spells that you have first to actually read and understand before skilling, talents that improve your quality of life on the global map, etc. There are certain builds that work much better than others, so in a way it is somewhat unbalanced, however on hard difficulty the enemies receiving quite some advantages so every matter is justified.

[b] Graphic & Interface : 6/10 [/b]
The graphic looks quite aged in some places, while others are full with detail and feel alive. It will not throw you off your chair, however it fits the kinda southern style of the game with deserts, oasis, arabic looking cities, etc. The interface is well structured, has enough details to not overwhelm you but still provide needed information. It is similar to oldschool RPGs where you increase your main stats that do increase your secondary attributes like attack, dodge, etc.

[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 7/10 [/b]
Blackguards takes quite a while to finish on hard difficulty and provides a lot of side quests, that do not feel like simple time fillers, but actually provide background stories to your characters or the world. The chapters increase the strength of the enemies by a lot so each time switching to a new chapters you can ready yourself for a higher challenge. At the same time your team gets stronger so the fights do not simply feel longer, but actually more tactical and you have a bigger variety of weapons and spells in your arsenal. Some quests are connected to each other and certain battle fields have different objectives that can be considered mini-games since main purpose there is not to just simply kill the enemies.

[b] Audio & Immersion : 7/10 [/b]
I really like the music in Blackguards. It has a great variety of tracks, orchestral, drums, southern styled music combined with good sound effects of combat. The hits, especially crits felt impactful, the spells had fitting sound effects as well. The voice overs were not superior but still decent of a quite unknown game. Some cut scenes were even well voiced.

[b] Side-Notes [/b]
[list]
[*]This game offers a single player long campaign with 50+h if you finish all the side quests as well.
[*]This game contains steam achievements that are sometimes quite hard to get and require either replaying of re-saving.
[*]This game offers minor replayability since its heavily story based.
[/list]

[b] Summary [/b]
Blackguards is a good single player RPG with an oldschool feeling, turn-based hex combat and deep character progression system. The music as well the graphic style and interface fit the game really well and the cutscenes implemented along the side quests provide some deeper story than you get from most othe RPGs. The characters are great and some dialogs between them are enjoyable. The combat is challenging on hard, so you might even have to replay it if you mess up your character on the first try. Overall, definetely enjoyable game that you might expect to dive for longer time into.

For example, I had a character with a 95% chance of successfully casting a spell, a key spell I used to start every battle that hurt the stats of all enemies on the map for a few turns.

Reloaded.  20.  Reloaded.  20.  It took until the seventh try to not roll a 20.  The odds of that happening by chance are too low to seriously consider.  And junk like that happened ALL THE TIME.

The die roll cheating was really annoying, but, whatever, I got through 99% of the game fine just learning to never bother trying anything that didn't have at least an 80% chance, which in reality was more like 30%-40%.  The real slap in the face instead came in the very last boss battle.  Going into the last section, the game took away my main healer with no warning and no going back at that point, so my party was already struggling a bit.  But I made it through a series of fights in the final section to the last battle, which then basically requires archery to win without a ton of hassle and retries.  I never once used archery the whole game up to that point (aside from an archer specced NPC party member that disappears very early on) and never needed to.

soundtrack is a masterwork. I like it. If the publisher offer a separate DLC for the soundtrack I would buy it.

Cons (I have always been a DND player so this is kinda biased)
The dark-eye based system is pretty intereseting but simple. Compare to your ordinary DND or DND-alike system, this one is kinda limited in terms of character development and stragety mangament. All of your chars, including spell casters, have to invest at least one weapon class. The spell system in this game was very limited. Buff/ debuff is way too powerful, compared to direct damage spells. The best way to use a fireball spell is to ignite an area of wood and lure your enemies into fire.
As I mentioned, the program is buggy. I encountered five bugs that totally crushed the entire game during my 40 hrs play, which I redeemed as intolerable.

You are jailed for the murder of a princess, and control a band of murderers and misfits as you try to clear your name and figure out what happened and if you are really are to blame.
 
I liked the story of blackguards as well as the characters. It’s a really dark and dirty universe where there isn’t much sympathy for your character (or the company he keeps). All of the companions are fleshed out and have unique personalities, and although some of them are near useless in combat their banter and quips at each did make me chuckle. Each character has their own motive for joining you, and although they won’t (willing) leave they provide enough quests and input to the situations that I wanted them to hang around. The story does branch into 3 possible directions depending on how you treat one of your characters and the choices you make throughout the game, though I have been unable find anything on the requirements to do so. While I wasn’t impressed with the end boss, the story meshed very well, and contained a good amount of twists and turns. You do have a good amount of freedom to be as mercenary as you want, and optional battles are required as you will want the extra XP. The memory sequence where you can recover your memories if you keep digging was very good, though I can only think a very experienced character will be able to progress through it as the enemy spawns are very difficult.
 
Having played a good amount of Dungeons and Dragons I felt I had a good understanding of how the game would play (how different could it be?), and got demolished because of it. The base gameplay is quite different, which results in a high difficulty spike very early on until you know what you are doing, this isn’t helped by the fact the games base difficulty is hard. Each character takes turns based on initiative. Characters can move to any hex tiles they can reach, where you can then attack, use items, cast spells. Combat plays different as well, with your weapon mastery determining how much you put into attack and how much into parry. Some weapons (like spears) can attack from 2 tiles away, allowing you to bottleneck enemies on gangplanks and walkways which is the only way to stop you from being rushed and killed. Magic is completely different to what I am used to, with direct damage spells being almost useless, and buffs and hexes really making or breaking combat. Ranged attacks are very good, however ammo is very limited and I found myself always out. Stores don’t replenish stock, so once you are out a ranged attacker can find themselves useless in all future battles until a new store is found.
 
The class up/character creation system while varied needs a good tutorial. It’s more than easy to make a completely useless character that will require a restart to fix. Each of your companions really has a set role, and while you can make them deviate slightly it’s not enough to truly make them something they weren’t already. The exceptions to this are Aurelia (who can lose her magic for a good portion of the game), and Zurbaran, whose offensive magic is better spent moving towards ranged attacks or buffing magic. As your character can be anything I would highly recommend reading a guide on the character progression and possible skills, this game wants you to specialize and it will help in focusing on a long term character that won’t end up like a jack of all trades and be absolutely useless.
 
The maps are designed quite well, with many interactive objects usually littering the stages. These can be enough to completely remove enemies from the map, poisoning them for ongoing damage or opening extra routes you can use to escape or flank enemies. They each look very nice, with each map being quite detailed.  A good music score accompanies the game, and while it doesn’t have that zip or intense tones to drum up suspension it does its job admirably.
 
All of the above said the game does have some issues. The first as mentioned before is its difficulty. This is a hard game which I suspect will turn some people off. I found some fights come down to knowing when and where enemies are going to spawn, so you can get in first. Stats won’t mean much to you if you don’t know the system, and this game doesn’t do a great job of explaining them. Many of the later game enemies have high dodge rates, so even with a high attack rating my characters were missing quite often. If you don’t have a buffing/de-buffing mage ready you will die. Many of the games achievements are broken, and simply don’t pop. Although I really liked the story, I wish there was more world lore available in the game, from the creatures to how the world works. It was a missed opportunity to introduce more people to the pen and paper game behind this one. A little more polish and this game could have been magnificent rather than good.

The DLC doesnt really add to much to the game, other than setting up a few extra missions and the background for the least well explained companion. That said his story is good and the battles are hard. It does give you access to the soundtrack if you liked listening to the music.
 
If you are chasing 100% achievements then it’s impossible as a few are bugged.",1533136966,1533137463,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you go into this game with a typical gaming mindset than yes the battles are going to drive you up a wall.   On the other hand, if you've wargamed in the past the battles (or tactical puzzles as they call them) aren't that bad.

Equip your party right, know how to read a battlefield, position your troops and you'll find winning isn't that hard.

While the story is only so-so and not worth buying the game for, the series of tactical battles more than makes up for that.

The character voices are engaging, a nice mix of dry humor keeps it interesting.  I'm not usually big on games that use voice overs, but I didn't mind this one.

Starting off in the expert mode helps you get off on the right foot as it allows you to craft your hero character the way you want them to be.

All games have bad parts and this one does too.   I disliked how on some maps you need to open chests or break things in order to increase your loot.  In most games you'd clear the map and then loot.  BG's on the other hand requires you to take care of those things while you fight.  Once the last foe goes down, the map closes out, zippo, period, you're done.  No more looting.

The other thing is I found the percentage to hit is sometimes baffling.  Hit chances would go from 85% / 95% to hit down to 65% for my melee character;  same type of target, positioning, nothing I could see was different, but the game thought so.  Minor, but like I said baffling.

-Niente
-Personaggi carini
-Niente
-Trama sufficiente
-Niente
-Ancora Niente
-Grafica pressocchè accettabile.

-IA inesistente , giocherellare a sasso carta forbice con le proprie mani sarà più divertente...
-Missioni Secondarie che non hanno nè testa nè coda. 
-Mappa enorme con tante città ma puoi benissimo aver visitato anche la metà di esse.
-5 capitoli uniti con colla e scotch *(Non ricordo come si scrive e siccome sono un recensore professionista non può fregarmene di meno).
-Equipaggiamento che equivale al tuo stesso armadio di casa. ( Qui l'esperienza di gioco cambia mio caro lettore, se tu hai un armadio con 3 magliette ti ritroverai nella situazione di Blackguards se tu ne hai di più...no non cambia niente, le armature sono quelle , punto e basta).
-Un boss finale che equivale alla somma di tutti i boss della trilogia di Dark Souls, Bloodborne e Sekiro.
-Nemici sbilanciatissimi, posso avere anche buone caratteristiche ma è il gioco a decidere se vinci o meno.
-Caricamenti così lunghi che forse finiscono prima la ùSalerno-Reggio Calabria
-Un casino di Crush insensanti e non intendo Bandicoot ( Ditemi che avete capito la battuta... lo so la mia vita è triste)
-Sistema a turni completamente casuale. ( Il gioco i spiega che agiscono prima coloro che hanno una statistica , di cui non ricordo minimamente il nome, al massimo...bene ...non serve a un emerito cazzo)

-Vattene via.

To put this into perspective, about 2 hours in [spoiler] there's an optional fork in the game where you can rescue a baroness or leave her to be hanged by the Bailiff who said he was gonna burn out her eyes.... not fucking hang her. The Bailiff is a crazed maniac, very obviously mentally unstable man who for some reason which I'm sure will never be explained in a way that makes sense, made it into a position of power and is trying to kill the Baroness because she's sat on your party members face and anyone who does any crime no matter how insignificant is deemed a murderer by the Bailiff and anyone who shags a criminal is also a murderer. It's already dumb. [/spoiler]

The level where spoiler above takes place is just poorly designed. You have to make it across two bridges in 5 turns to rescue her. The bridges are three spots wide, there's 7 enemies, there's 6 guarding both bridges (3 per bridge) and one dick with a crossbow peppering the squad. When the level kicks off, two enemies always have to initiative and will block the first bridge with boxes and then stand in your way, you can't move them, you have to kill them, get really lucky or waste half a day trying to get past it only to realize when you finally do, this is how the whole game is going to be presented to you.

Blackguards might look like nice title. Turn-based tactical combat, RPG, fantasy - what’s not to like? Well, nothing to like if everything is F’d up. 

Plot is boring, generic and uninspiring.  Protagonist accused of a murder of princess or something like that, no one really cares. How to? Voice acting is ridiculous, as it was developers themselves (like good ol’ days, yeah?). Visual style is mundane, and animation is way worse than early 2000s RPGs.

Combat is turn-based on a hex-gridded maps and monotonous as hell. No tactical options, no environment to use and your options are confusing mostly useless abilities in that terrible-terrible radial menu. 

Maybe the worst thing in this game is a roleplay system. It is too much bloated with numerous stats, talents and abilities, and at the same time so empty, that character becomes one of three timeworn archetypes: caster, archer, warrior. Well, I’m no stranger to getting my head around different RPG systems, but horrible UI made it impossible this time. 

All the gameplay consists of boring fights with horrible animations on mostly empty arenas, moving between dots on maybe the blandest looking world map and clicking on a static picture called “city” to hear more laughably bad dialogs.

Playable, has a decent (if bland) story, but gameplay is tedious, frustrating, and often boring.

I'm not familiar with the Dark Eye system this game is based on, so this was my introduction. After playing this though, I can say with certainty that I don't like it. 

I can handle a some RNG, and I realize that the game wasn't actively screwing me, but by the gods sometimes I swear...

But I digress, the main reason this gets a no from me is that I felt more annoyed than anything while playing it. 

The game is entirely battle focused. There is a world map and point and click style locations to visit, but these only serve to get you into the battles. 
The battles themselves are slow, drawn out affairs. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it makes a bad RNG roll all the more frustrating since you have to wait what feels like hours for the next chance. (it's really actually less than a minute, but it adds to the annoyance factor). There are also a number of very annoying things about them: 
- Low level spells are literally useless, requiring virgin sacrifices to whatever capricious god holds sway in this world to even cast them (this includes basic healing spells), while the enemies have near 100% accuracy from the get go. This isn't even due to the RNG gods not smiling on me either, the game actually lists the chances of successful casts at welll below 40% until you either upgrade the spell, or get your casters the appropriate skills. 
- Enemies employ poison more often than not, and using the counter measures such as antidotes and spells is pointless since the next enemy strike will just poison you again. (and now you've wasted a turn to boot).
- When it isn't poison, it's traps. But usually, it's both. And traps that poison you. Great.

There are a number of sidequests, but the questlog often forgets to tell you where to go. For instance, it wanted me to go to meet Madavar, but didn't say where he was. ( I eventually just googled it rather than wasting time checking everywhere).

[h1]Blackguards 是一款問題不少，需要一點時間，樂趣才會發酵的遊戲。[/h1]

「黑衛」我一直在猶豫要不要推薦它，遊戲的初期比較平淡，加上有各種奇怪的BUG會干擾遊戲，所以評價不是太好；但還是有其優點可以推薦，且鑑於已經入過各種遊戲同捆包不少次，加上特賣的價格很低，還是稍微介紹一下，或許正是你喜好的類型與玩法。

[h1]優點：[/h1]
[olist]
    [*] 團隊裡同伴的對話很逗趣，矮人與法師是一絕。
    [*] 很有巧思的地圖設計，各種環境、陷阱效果。
    [*] 中規中矩的戰鬥，難度偏高。
    [*] 人物配音很棒，口音跟情感有特色。
[/olist]

黑衛中有一項主要特色，就是多變的地圖設計，每一張地圖都有不太一樣的環境效果、機關或陷阱，你可以利用這些環境效果去干擾、殺死敵人，而有些關卡則需要破解機關才會通過；舉例來說，在沼澤關卡你可以用火箭、火球點燃沼澤區，讓其爆炸使得周邊的人著火，而在有峭壁懸崖的關卡，可以用擊飛技能讓敵人直接摔落（死亡），讓每一場戰鬥不會那麼無聊，會讓人願意繼續玩下去

[b]將你的小隊卡好位，讓敵人去踩陷阱！[/b]

此外就是劇情方面，我覺得主線故事有些單薄、張力不夠，支線有一些關連但訊息太過破碎，比較難連結在一起；但隊伍間的對話很有意思，看矮人嘲諷別人或被取笑，是樂趣～！

[b]矮人嘲諷的天賦一定是點滿的～ [/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1207887376 

[h1]缺點：[/h1]
[olist]
    [*] 劇情的強度不夠，過於平淡。
    [*] 綁的過死的職業設計，人物技能學錯會導致戰鬥變超難。
    [*] BUG不少，有些影響體驗，有些會導致遊戲崩潰。
    [*] 成就有BUG，有些不改文件一定拿不到。
[/olist]

劇情算一個完整的故事，但就是有些地方沒交代清楚，主要的故事比較缺乏強度，讓人可能玩過一陣子就忘了；而我覺得比較可惜的地方是人物職業設計，職業幾乎是綁死的，同伴的職業走向你沒有太多選擇，而且有些技能幾乎是必定要這樣點，否則會提高原本就困難的戰鬥難度，這也使得遊戲缺乏讓你重玩的動力。

再來就是各種BUG，我約60個小時的遊戲過程，有遇過數次遊戲崩潰，但沒有遇到不能繼續遊戲的問題就是了（至少我可以破關）；而成就方面一定是條件設定有出錯，導致特定幾個成就無法正常獲得，可以參考討論區與指南的說明，手動改一下遊戲文件，才能正常獲得。

[b]遊戲的華麗技能，都要很後期才會點到～[/b]

這款遊戲照開發商Daedalic的習慣，一定會持續入包的，有遇到再購入體驗看看；我想應該有不少人收藏庫已經擁有了，如果看完評論有點興趣，就開來試試看吧！

I was playing on hard all the way, i just tuned down the dificulty to easy to complete some fights, and overall i really enjoyed the game, i just wished i had a way to speed up the fights since there was some battles who had more than 20 people on the screen and it took way too much time on that.

Игра для тех, кто любит жанр Пошаговые бои.
Игра сделана с упором именно на сами бои, без каких либо бездумных лазаний с целью полюбоваться пейзажами и прочим.
Опять же - это тактическая игра, порой она наказывает за бездумные ходы.
Надо четко понимать,что нельзя бездумно растрачивать очки опыта.
Главный и мощный плюс этой игры - это сюжет. Именно он, а так же разнообразие локаций и правила победы удержали меня до конца игры.
Шанс попадания,действительно, немного разочаровывал, но к нему можно привыкнуть и его можно прокачать и вообще по ходу игры с опытом понимаешь что и где прокатит, а что нет - если подключить голову. А так же можно пробовать и юзать быстрые сохранения и загрузки.
Советы:
Мне помог совет в одном из здешних обзоров - взять лучника. Но я что-то затупил и пользовался только типом стрел - наносящий только ""колющий урон"". Просто нигде не написано на каких противников какой урон действует лучше или хуже. 
А так же вашему лучнику нужно будет иметь при себе оружие ближнего боя - для разбивания кристаллов.
Вообще у всех персонажей должны быть дополнительные оружия на готове с разным типом урона.
Нехило пригодится в магии - навык скорости (именно дополнительный ход союзнику)
ПС:  Лучник с прокачанным скиллом Буря стрел - дает победу над противниками типа горилл или прочих великанов с кучей хп - проседающих в ноль с ваншота. А дополнительный ход данный лучнику - иногда и вовсе завершает бой на первом же раунде.

Очень спорные действия интерактивных объектов в пошаговых боях, когда ты не разработчик, а проходить сие творение приходится. Никаких подсказок - помрешь раз 10, потом случайно тыкнешь на что-то типа колодца, а он, оказывается что-то полезное делает. Здорово.

Кривая и неудобная камера. Кривая и непоянтная система прокачки с учителями. Перемудрили. При этом, самих возможностей в боях предельно мало. Ах да, для использования скиллов придется лазить в кривое неудобное меню каждый раз... Все криво и не понятно в инвентаре - что лучше, а что хуже там черт ногу сломит.

Man kann es schaffen, aber manches frustriert und entnervt nur. Etwa wenn man einen Kampf mit dem Ziel ""bewege deine Helden auf die andere Seite"" nur geschafft hat, weil der Hauptcharakter am Zielort war und der Rest der Gruppe tot, ist es besonders erfreulich, wenn man danach sofort in den Bosskampf mit einem drachenartigen Wesen geschickt wird, ohne Möglichkeit auf Heilung. Was bedeutet, alle Gruppenmitglieder sind auf 1 HP, außer eben der Hauptcharakter. Schön, wenn der Boss dann AoE spamt und seine normalen Attacken zwischen 12 und 16 Schaden machen (50 HP sind viel, als Vergleich).
Oh, und an einer bestimmten Stelle wird ein Caster-Char mit einer Schandmaske ausgestattet, die dafür sorgt, dass diese Person nicht mehr zaubern kann und damit ein überglorifizierter laufender Dolch ohne nennenswerte Fähigkeiten und Verteidigungsmöglichkeiten wird. Außer man skillt da vorher drauf, aber WOHER SOLL MAN DAS WISSEN WENN MAN KEINE LÖSUNG LIEST?!

Auch zu bewundern sind Gegner, die in doppelter Mannstärke der Spielergruppe aufrennen, durch die Bank etwa so viel HP haben wie der Gruppentank und andauernd für 20+ Schaden critten (erneut, 50 HP sind hier relativ viel).

This game might be very linear, and some do find the constant battles challenging, so do I. I like that aspect and If you figure out how to get the console working (google it) you can give your adventurers what the game calls AP - action points but they are really spendable experience points. You don't ""level up"" (or at least I haven;t yet) but they let you improve many aspects of your game by expending these AP points. If it is too hard, give your starting characters a few thousand experience points. Spread them around carefully. The set it to normal. If you can't bring yourself to cheat this way, play on easy. It is still challenging. I like this so far. I'm having a great time.

JOUEZ EN MODE FACILE ET CONSULTEZ LES GUIDES D'ATTRIBUTION DES POINTS D'AVENTURE DES PERSONNAGES.

Parce que si vous êtes un joueur normal (au sens strict du terme) qui s'intéresse aux combats tactiques au tour par tour, vous tenez sans doute là votre seule chance de pouvoir vraiment apprécier ce jeu.

Voilà, c'est tout et vous pourriez en restez là. Et oui vous pouvez me remercier.

Pour ceux que ça intéresse je vais développer :

Si vous ne suivez pas mon conseil, vous ferez comme j'ai failli faire et vous ragerez de frustration contre cette purge au bout de quelques heures à vous escrimez sur un combat délirant de difficulté (le premier d'une longue liste). Mais vous noterez la possibilité salvatrice de changer le niveau de difficulté en cours de partie, point positif qui a littéralement sauvé mon expérience de jeu.

En effet en mode facile et à condition d'éviter les pièges idiots de cette abomination qu'est la progression des personnages, Blackguard devient un jeu sympa et jouable. Et quand je dis jouable je veux dire pas dire que vous allez rouler sur le jeu, non, même en mode facile Blackguard propose un certain challenge et vous ne pourrez pas faire n'importe quoi, seulement vous aurez une bonne chance de vous y amuser au lieu de vous heurtez à l'étron punitif que le gamedesigner sous camisole vous a concocté par défaut.



Blackguard ne prétend à rien d'autre qu'être un tactical mediéval fantastique qui enchaîne les rencontres et le reste du jeu n'est que l'habillage de cette orientation principale. 

Il se trouve que cette habillage me plaît beaucoup et que je trouve que les critiques sur celui-ci sont plutôt injustes voire carrément de mauvaise foi car Blackguard annonce la couleur et ne trompe pas sur la marchandise contrairement à Larian et ses DOS, DOS2 et BG3 qui se font passer pour des jeux de rôles alors que leur seul intérêt est dans les combats (et encore).

S'il y a des failles à lui reprocher, c'est dans l'arène qu'elles sont et pas besoin d'aller en chercher plus loin car elles sont béantes...

Les règles du jeu de rôle « l'oeil noir » sont fidèlement suivies mais présentent un léger problème… Elles ne sont absolument pas adaptées pour donner un tactical… tactique : Pas de système de couverture (ou alors très très discret), pas de système de prise en tenaille ou d'attaque de flanc (pour de la mêlée c'est juste la base et cela revient à se priver 
d'un intérêt évident), il reste le minimum syndical à savoir les cases bloquées par les personnages, les ajustements d'attaques à distance et les attaques d'opportunités (qui n'existent même pas par défaut). C'est trop maigre pour vraiment développer une stratégie personnelle qui fait la différence et on se retrouve en lanceur de tirage aléatoire sur 
lesquelles (et c'est là le point noir) le joueur a bien trop peu d'influence. La bataille se joue donc le plus souvent en amont, sur l'équipement et surtout, SURTOUT sur la façon dont les points d'aventure ont été dépensées pour faire progresser les personnages. Par charité ( et parce que ça serait trop long), je ne m'attarderai pas sur cet aspect désastreux du gameplay si ce n'est pour souligner que tout le mal que vous pouvez en lire içi et là est encore trop gentil à mon goût.


J'en termine.


Appeler « difficulté normale », un cauchemar de frustration sans légitimité ludique relève au mieux de la bêtise crasse et au pire du sabotage industriel. C'est tout con mais juste augmenter d'un niveau la dénomination des niveaux de difficulté aurait peut être pu sauver le jeu de toutes ces évaluations pleines de rage justifiée. On reste pantois devant autant d'amateurisme.

Mais si le game design a été chié par des crétins incompétents dont la seule ambition semble d'avoir voulu gâcher tout le bon travail de leurs collègues graphistes et programmeurs vous n'y êtes pour rien.

Ne vous sentez donc pas coupable.

Attirée par une promotion alléchante sur un bundle de jeux Daedalic, je me suis retrouvée en possession de 'Blackguards', un RPG organisé autour de combats au tour par tour. Le pitch paraissait sympathique (du RPG et des combats), mais je me suis rapidement retrouvée embourbée dans un gameplay lent et ennuyeux.
Du role playing, je n'en ai pas vraiment vu: les choix dans les dialogues n'influent que rarement sur le cours de l'histoire. Les relations entre les personnages sont stéréotypées. On ne s'attache pas vraiment à eux. Les villes se ressemblent. Les PNJ sont interchangeables. 
Des combats, par contre, j'en ai vu, vu, vu et revu. Les critiques que j'avais lues attiraient l'attention sur leur difficulté. En fait, à part quatre ou cinq combats plutôt compliqués, ils s'agit juste d'optimiser une ou deux aptitudes chez chacun des personnages et les utiliser encore et encore, avec, de temps en temps, quelques variations de tactique. Il m'a fallu recommencer plusieurs fois un certain nombre de combats, certes, mais j'ai vu pire dans d'autres rpg. 
Entre temps, il faudra s'armer de patience pour cumuler points d'aventures (nécessaires à la progression de vos personnages) et Ducats (nécessaire à l'achat de matériel décent).
Vous l'aurez compris, je n'ai pas vraiment aimé ce jeu, trop répétitif et linéaire. Le mot qui me revenait à chaque fois était le mot FASTIDEUX.
Néanmoins, j'ai apprécié le système très ouvert de customisation des personnages grâce aux points d'aventure, le moteur pour l'optimisatrice que je suis, dans ce jeu. 
Si vous êtes fans de jeux de rôle ouverts (Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternity...), vous pouvez vous passer de Blackguards, très  technique et peu satisfaisant en terme de construction de personnages réalistes.

It is frustrating at times, but more often enjoyable. An interesting story and combat rules make up for a couple of glaring technical issues and writing foibles.

-

I'll start with the negative aspects, since they are notable enough to be ""make or break"" for most RPG players:

There are no respec options or training areas to get infinite ""experience"" to round out characters. If you commit a stat point, then you have to live with the long-term consequences. In general, you have to decide in advance what you want each party member to specialize in. The real kicker is that several achievements require you to spend a lot of stat points to make a character have a bunch of general skills with no specialization, guaranteeing that they will be useless in most situations rather than very strong in their main role. Finally, some builds just aren't viable past the mid-game; if you chose to specialize someone in Fencing and Throwing weapons or Traps, then you'll be very annoyed to find a lack of legendary Fencing weapons and that Traps and Throwables just do not deal enough damage or utility to scratch later enemies.

The game pulls an Aerith on [spoiler]one of the more interesting and well-written playable characters less than halfway through. You will lose someone permanently, and their replacement is a very dull and flat Generic Tribal Warrior dude with  little personality, backstory, or plot importance; the replacement is just kind of there to be another body on your team and will never do anything in cutscenes other than sit back and grunt.[/spoiler]

The game is very buggy, even after years of supposed bug fixes. Graphics sometimes bug out, the UI occasionally stops working, enemy AI turns off, side-quests randomly appear or disappear with no known reason, and achievements that require an entire playthrough to acquire simply will not be awarded no matter how many times you reload that Point Of No Return save. The sound also falters every single time a multi-target spell goes off, without fail.

Lastly, the game just... ends. On most story paths, there is a brief and inconclusive epilogue after the final boss that does not really address the repercussions (or lack thereof) and may even contradict the warnings that the final boss gives you about your actions.

-

Now, on to the strengths of the game!

Almost every battle is unique. I never felt like I was redoing the same fight over and over again like I do in other RPGs. Even fights that take place in the same gladiator arena as an earlier battle require a new set of tactics and positioning choices. A lot of fights also involve small puzzles or gimmicks that contribute to victory. This is probably the biggest step-up over other RPGs, in my opinion.

Most of your playable characters are entertaining to listen to and have their own perspectives on the situation. Witty banter and sardonic humor abound, and everyone will offer several solutions to multiple situations; choosing one option is quite likely to amuse someone else and annoy a third. Although, it's a pity that [spoiler]you lose one of the better, more dramatic characters and are stuck with a dull meatbot partway through[/spoiler].

While you are limited in the amount of points you get for stat and talent distribution, you do get many options on how to build your main character and allies. It is very feasible to make an archer that dodges all melee attacks while picking away at enemy rangers, or to have a tank mage casually ignoring everything the boss tries to do to them. Just remember that you kind of need to commit to a character only having one or two specialties if you want them to be effective.

The story takes some unexpected and delightful turns, especially on some of the longer sidequests. You also have a good amount of influence on it, even in comparison to most RPGs. The outcomes of several quests and the overall story in your game will likely deviate a lot from what someone else did.

Das Spiel basiert auf dem Regelwerk von ""Das schwarze Auge"" und ist eine PC-Version von den mehr oder weniger bekannten ""Pen&Paper""-Spielen. Hierunter darf man sich eine Mischung aus Gesellschaftspiel, Erzählung und Improvisationstheater verstehen, welche eben einem recht strengen Regelwerk folgt.

Und hier liegt die Einstiegshürde. Zum einen sind die Regeln nicht direkt aus dem Spiel-/Kampfablauf erkennbar, wodurch man nicht wirklich gut versteht wie die Aktionen Angriff, Parieren und Ausweichen mit diversen Spezialaktionen und Charakterattributen zusammenhängen. Zusätzlich spielt halt noch ein gewisser Zufallsfaktor mit, da es eben sich um die Adaption eines (würfelbasierten) Gesellschaftsspiel handelt.

Und dann kommt noch hinzu, dass es ein ""level-loses"" Spiel ist. Man bekommt als Belohnung für Kämpfe und Aufträge sogenannte ""Abenteuerpunkte"". Diese werden für alle Aktionen verwendet, die einen Charakter betreffen. Das Erhöhen der Grundwerte, der Fertigkeiten, der Waffenfähigkeiten, sowie von Sonderfähigkeiten und Zaubern (wenn der Charakter Magie begabt ist). Gerade zu Beginn ist man hier schnell überfordert und man kann auch recht viel falsch machen.

Mein Tip ist: Bevor man das Spiel startet, sollte man sich erstmal mit dem Regelwerk auseinander setzen. Zum Beispiel gibt es bei Steam echt gute Guides/Anleitungen, die einem echt weiterhelfen und das nötige Verständnis schaffen.

Wenn man sich mithilfe eines Guides in das Regelwerk eingearbeitet hat, entfaltet die Charakterentwicklung sehr viel Potential. Man kann die Charakter nach Lust und Laune als Nahkämpfer, Fernkämpfer oder Magier spezialisieren. Man kann aber auch beliebige Kombinationen erstellen. Ausnahme sind die Zauber, diese können nur von Charakteren erlernt und angewendet werden, die Magie als Grundausrichtung haben. Schön ist hier, dass sich die Charakter auch wirklich ""anders"" spielen, jenachdem welche Waffen sie beherrschen und über welche Fähigkieten sie verfügen.

Auch wird der Zusammenhang zwischen der einzelnen Werten und Fertigkeiten und dem Kampfsystem spürbar verständlich und man kann es gezielt ausnutzen um starke Charakterer zu entwicklen. Hier liegt dann wirklich eine große Stärke des Spiels.

Die Kämpfe sind taktisch mitunter sehr fordernd, lassen sich aber häufig mit guten Management der Fähigkeiten der Charaktere, Waffen und Zauber gut schaffen. Die Umgebung lässt sich häufig auch mit in den Kampf einbinden, so dass auch hier taktische Kämpfe möglich sind.

Das Spiel selber ist sehr story-lastig. Dies beruht wieder darauf, dass es sich um die Adaption eines Pen&Paper-Spiels handelt. Die Geschichte enthält einige Überraschungen, den ein oder anderen Spannungsbogen und erzählt auch gut die Beziehungen zwischen den einzelnen Figuren. Diese wirken sehr passend für die Atmosphäre.

Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass das Spiel sich lohnt. Man muss sich definitiv in das Spiel einarbeiten, am Besten mit Hilfe eines Guides.

I'm in Chapter 4, and I think Ch 5 is the last one. 

People have panned this game, unfairly I think, it deserves much more than a 'mixed' response. 

It's a haxagonal spaces, turn based, team combat, rpg. The atmosphere is dark, tho not depressing, there's a lot of black humor, and violence humor. 

The team really are BlackGuards - blaggards! Your mage is a womanizer, your witch is a liar, the dwarf is like addicted to violence (don't let him speak to anyone lol! Unless, ofc, you want some more exp, but sometimes you can overdo it and sort of violence your way out the wrong end of a quest, or finish it too early because there's no players left in the storyline :s). 

Some of the things you do are very questionable. While you might do heroic stuff - rescue maidens, priests, etc. you're also going to beat people into servitude, frame people, kill them on a whim, or because someone paid you to do it. Sometimes you find a quest item, and it's actually an awesome peice of weaponry, and you lie to the guy who sent you looking for it. No, we didn't find it yet :) 

Occasionally you can use an alternative to violence, e.g. charm, negotiate, or bribe your way forward. But rah, it's the beatings that this game is all about! 

Now... whyyy it gets panned in reviews.... cuz the first two chapters are the most difficult.... they are very very difficult.... gold is hard to get, Action Points (AP) which are the building blocks for your skills, are slow to accumulate, and the dizzying array of skills and spells and talents you can spend them on just seem to absorb what little AP you get, to very little effect. All of the stats grow very slowly, and among them is the percentile chance of your attack actually hitting home. 

At this point in the game, ranged opposition like archers will chop your team to quivering sushi. Your healer runs out of mana crazy fast, and you can't afford the pots to boost him. You need to sleep in an inn after every battle to recover. 

Under these conditions, you... are... streeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetched to your team's limits. You can have an okay team, statted as well as you can stat them for that time in the story/game, you know that if you could set up your ideal defence or offence layout, that you could probably whup anything... but.... the field of battle is not letting you! lol! Stretched thin, is your line, at your absolute limit of what each individual and the team as a whole is capable of dealing with.... so... in that situation... what's the feeling when one of your melee fighters fumbles a crucial attack, swings, misses, lets some beast thru that savages your mage, the whole thing 's toppling like a tower of cards! 

It happens over, and over.. sometimes it happens becuase you didn't figure the map/baddies or the battlefield layout properly. In the early days, there are things in the battle areas that you neeeed to take advantage of, or you're not gonna get thru the battle. In other words, you team isn't always enough, the first couopla chapters has you on a knife edge of whether you can or can't beat the battle you're in, and like I say, your actual hit success stats are low, the lowest they're ever going to be, so its really tough. 

It gets you determined tho! 

It riles you up, that's for sure. But there is a way to ease the strain of all this. 

I got to a particular battle.... the 8th part of The Nine Hordes (which isn't really what it sounds like) (no spiolers! I just mention it to segue into this story....)

It got me, over and over, and I juuuust couldn't see howww, howwwww I couold ever prevent x, y, and z, from happening.... there seemed nothing I could do... so... I went looking for a walkthru.... 

I found on YouTube, this guy, freaki'n pretending... pretending! To be playing BlackGuards for the first time.... all like, what's that? idk what they do.... while at the same time flashing through the ability menus like a pro, he was doing it far faster than me! and as well... this battle... this particular one I looked up like this... he's like... okay... this this, that that... he was WORSE than me! But he beat it.... and I'm like, wth!? They move differently against me! They run away and re-energise! They go straight for the maguffin and bring the battle to a sudden halt in just a few moves! Why didn't they do that to him!? 

So... this is when I took the nuclear option.... the ultimate in winning strategy! 

I accessed the difficulty settings and put the game on 'easy' :) 

Oh nowww! Nooowwwww those things move like they did for that guy in the YT vid! Omg!!! What a cheese! What a Cheese head thing to do! Put it on 'easy' and then pretend that you've never played it before, and be all like, hawwww-he-hawwww, euuuhhh, ohheyyyy, yeuuhhh,  yupyup, I'm so good.... WHAT!? You freaki'n moron! 

omg... so... anyway.... I made it soooo far, before changing the settings to 'easy' ... and rah! The AP accumlates quicker, the hit rate is higher on my team, and the battles come down from 'impossible' to 'manageable.' 

Then give it another chapter... oh thennn we see some payback! 

Then... thennnn.... you start to build those skills.. you've earned literally tens of thousands of AP... you've maxed some abilities out already... you barely miss hit anymore.... you don't need to use pots to repelnish your mage and witch, becuasse they generate mana as they go along! You don't need to sleep after every battle, because you can just heal at the start of the next one, and replenish mages while you and the bad guys are rushing toward each other. And arrows?
 Arrows?? Don't make me laugh! My men brush them aside! The team is strong! Very strong! 

My dwarf now has a 'hammerblow' ability, which gives him three times his attack power, at the cost of lower hit rate... it's 60% usually, his hit rate on that.... which means that more than half the time he's gonna use 3 times his power. ALWAYS use it! lolol! It's a bad guy crusher! He's an OHKO machine! 

So... the game is long.. the battles are long.. and it's a slow burner to get started.... the 'easy' setting feels like it should be the default setting, with the normal one as 'veteran' perhaps... that's how it feels compared to other games. 

And... its... satisfying! Ohhhhh yes, nowww we're motorin', nowww we're talkin'! This is what I wanted to see! My hard, hard team pushing back the bad guys, weathering their spell storms, brushing their arrows aside, and then SMAK!!!!! Oh yeahhhh! You deserved that! You thougth you'd get by because you paralyzed my healer? Think again! Wham-bam-balammmm! awwwwww, are you on the floor? Here, have a 100% chance of landing Power shot while you lay there! 

BAMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

Ha! Haaaaa! Yeahhhh! 

That's what this game is all about :) 

The graphics are good, I'd say, scenery is nice. Gameplay is compulsive and satisfying. The voice acting is amazing, I love it, there's real layers in the toning. Your witch is a Kiera Knightly-a-like, with that English sort of delectation on the ends of some of her words. Really a hot voice, and liek I say rich with character, it's difficult to even envision people are reading this stuff from sheets into microphones, these voices are so authentic.

Your own team, and people in towns, react to how beautiful your witch is :) tha'ts sorta fun :) 

The team is fun as a whole. 

I've already bought BlackGuards 2, on the basis of the first three chapters of this. I absolutely love it, I don't want it to end, it has me that gripped. 

Okay, it's not going to be for everyone, but I think... well crikey.... the sheer number of people complaining that the game is too difficult... fraaaa... you mean... you paid for the game... it stopped you in your tracks... so rather than lowering the difficulty setting, you throw that cash away, turn your nose up at the game, and leave a bad review? 

Nyeuuuhhh, don't listen to them. This is fantastic.

The main features that attracted my attention was turn-based, hex playboard and rpg. I was a big fan of xcom games, and I was so impressed by Daedalic's blade of the shogun, so my expectation was high. The game turned out to be a real pain instead.

Technically, the game crashed on the first startup, with a full size loading screen that cannot be removed or superposed, and I had to force restart my pc. Also, every time I tried to adjust sound or any other options, the game will be reset to an 800x600 resolution with full screen. The font of the UI also look blurry at 1440p while the rest of the UI looks fine.

In terms of game mechanics, I should not impose my subjective opinion on others, but like many have said, the rng was no joke. For example, a weapon with a 2D6+3 damage (two dice rolls plus 3) generates an output ranging from 4 to 15, so most of the time you will find it futile to plan your moves since its performace is unpredictable out of proportion. Most of the time I find myself quickloading an encounter over and over to have the fight starts favorably, because otherwise I would not be able to progress through the game, since the quest lines are mostly plainly linear. For reference, I played on normal difficulty.

There are of course interesting aspects of this game. I enjoyed the voice acting, for what it's worth, and the skill tree is mildly interesting. The visual is ok, albeit the lack of horizontal camera rotation was irritating. All in all, I'd recommand you to just try out other rpgs like divinity series and pillar of eternity, or even heroes of might & magic 3 for the hex mechanics.",1524601031,1524601031,False,1,0,0.50271296501159668,0,True,False,False,False,,,

detto questo, diciamo che è un titolo western rpg, con nani, elfi, goblin e via discorrendo
lo sviluppo dei characters è la prima cosa che ho notato essere strana, è un metodo bizzarro e difficile da descrivere a parole, riassumendo i programmatori non hanno impostato il salire di livello come avrebbero invece dovuto; ovvero con logica
la stessa cosa si può dire per le abilità di battaglia da utilizzare in guerra, tutto ha una tonalità offuscata e non precisa come invece dovrebbe
le colonne sonore sono davvero pessime e molto mal suonate, l'unica loro vera utilità è il ""pagliaccizzare"" le nostre gesta
parliamo delle animazioni perché graficamente è invece un bestione con cui dovrete scendere a patti con i settaggi per settarlo a dovere, i personaggi hanno delle animazioni che io personalente ho trovato strane, sembra quasi che il muoversi, costi loro eccessiva fatica, inoltre sono ridicoli e si muovono in maniera ridicola
a proposito della difficoltà, puntualmente il gioco, ti fa affrontare delle situazioni ben al di sopra delle nostre possibilità, con un numero di nemici su schermo, puntualmente di gran lunga superiore al nostro
poi c'è da segnalare invece un fattore molto positivo; ovvero il poter disporre di numerose tipologie di azioni negli scontri che generalmente, andranno a sfociare nell'interazione con l'ambiente
in ultimo voglio solo segnalare un evento molto strano, se il gioco mi dice che ho il 95% di possibilità di centrare un colpo di spada su un nemico, mi aspetto che esattamente come viene scritto, una volta su venti io possa effettivamente sbagliare il colpo, e invece no, a conti fatti io non so esattamente che colcoli faccia blackguards e che calcolatrice usi perché io personalmente ho fatto i conti, il 95% corrisponde più o meno al centrare 4 colpi su dieci

Almost impossible to click on the hex you mean to and half the time it just deselects it faster than you can left or right click; but you will be doing mostly right clicking as you have to go through three menus just to do a basic attack with both weapons when dual wielding.

The game falls into a rut most clueless gameplay designers choose when building strategy games. Just another missing simulator that is more frustrating than tactical. I could miss or I could hit for 2 or I could hit for 11; who knows but can’t create tactics around it.

- Trop facile/difficile. Il suffit de quelques erreurs de répartition de points pour qu'un combat devienne horrible. A l'inverse ça peut devenir trop facile et vous aimeriez passer le combat.

Aber dann hab ich als Kriegerin losgelegt und anders geskillt.

Nebenquests: Ich bin da ein kleiner Junkie, hoffe, ich habe alle erwischt.

法師
法術消耗星界能量嚴重，但每回合能回複的量有限，所以法術不適合做主要輸出的手段，而是以控場為目的。嚴寒衝擊、四肢酸痛、閃電迅移我都點滿。法師主動性夠高，開場先放一招，可以有效降低對手閃避命中機率。

近戰
近戰優先點滿天賦戰術，技能則是三倍傷害的鎚擊，可以有效根據對手型態轉換武器，確保輸出的有效性。

루즈해진다는 것보다는 어떻게 해서든 성장시키고 말겠다는 

오기가 생겨 루즈하다는 느낌은 받지 못했네요.

Fans von Games mit rundenbasierenden (""Schachbrett-"") Kämpfen ähnlich wie in ""M&M: Heroes"", ""Disciples"" oder ""Grotesque Tactics""werdem mit Sicherheit auf ihre Kosten kommen. Bei Blackguards fürht ihr allerdings keine Armeen in die Schlacht, sondern ""nur"" euch selbst und eure Heldentruppe.

Das Spiel ist unter einer DSA-Lizenz (Das schwarze Auge/Pen & Paper RPG) erschienen. Ihr spielt also in Aventurien. Die Regeln sind etwas angepasst (soweit ich das sagen kann), alte DSA-Veteranen werden sich in den Talenten, Zaubern u.ä. aber schnell zurecht finden. Alle anderen aber auch nach kurzer Eingewöhnung. Entweder erklärt der Infotext Funktionen und Items oder das kompakte Ingame-Tutorial bringt Licht ins Dunkel.

Die Story ist ok, keine großen Überraschungen oder Wendungen, welche man nicht erahnen kann. Ihr werdet eines Mordes angeklagt, den ihr vermutlich nicht begangen habt. Schnell zeigen sich auch Anzeichen, dass der Kult des Namenlosen wohl auch seine Finger mit im Spiel hat. Neben der Hauptquest gibt es zahlreiche Nebenquest, diese sollte man am besten auch alle erledigen. Die Erfahrungspunkte und Belohnungen sind relativ wichtig für ein sicheres vorankommen im Spiel.

Da alle Zauber, Angriffe, Talentanwendungen im DSA Stil ausgewürfelt werden, kann der Chaosfaktor manchmal recht hoch sein. Deshalb immer:

SOS (SEHR OFT SPEICHERN)

und nicht gleich verzagen, wenn ein Kampf mal 4-5 Anläufe braucht. Nutzt Gifte, Fallen und benutzbare Punkte (Hotkey: V) auf dem Schlachtfeld.

Mit den erhaltenen Erfahrungspunkten könnt ihr eure Charaktere direkt aufleveln. Einen ""richtigen"" Levelaufstieg gibt es nicht. Je nach Höhe des angestrebten Wertes im Talent/Attribut/Kampfskill zahlt ihren einen mit jedem mal steigenden Betrag an XP. Das könnt ihr, außer im Kampf, jederzeit machen. 

Die Grafik ist kein Überflieger, sondern eher zweckdienlich. Reicht aber vollkommend für vollen Spielgenuß, wenn einem die Sicherungen noch nicht durchgeschmorrt sind und man außer Grafik auch noch andere Dinge in Spielen wertschätzen kann. Die Vertonung ist auch in Ordnung für so ein kleines Spielprojekt und spiegelt wie auch die Grafik das finanzielle Budget der Entwickler wider.

Käfer habe ich im Spiel bis auf einen keine gefunden: In einem Dungeon konnte ich die Druckplatten nicht so aktivieren, dass eine Tür aufgeht. Ein Neustart der Kampfes hat Abhilfe geschafft. 


Fazit: DSA Fans & Anhänger des rundenbasierten Goblinkloppens werden bestimmt auf ihre Kosten kommen. Grafik-
 und HD Junkies sollten Abstand halten. Ebenso Menschen für die es nur Top Games (<80% Wertungen/aktuelle Engine/etc) gibt und alles darunter nicht so ist, wie sie es mögen und kennen.",1519769625,1519769625,True,0,0,0.452698796987533569,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Alors certes, on est heureux de trouver un arbre de compétence, la possibilité de mélanger les genres et les couleurs dans la construction de son personnage, une ambiance sympathique et bel et bien digne de l'héroïc fantasy mais...

Dommage pour un jeu de rôle...
Alors forcément, si le scénario est en carton, les personnages sont en... papier mâché, hein.

Finding items to put on your characters feels like scrounging around, trying to cobble together something decent until you finally get that nice suit of armor -- an experience I personally enjoy.

The combat animations are quick enough that I never felt impatient waiting for them to resolve, and the available spells offer some really great tactical options.

So why am I giving this game a thumbs down?

There's no respec. The battles are tough enough that you have to optimize your character builds to progress the story or defeat the higher level side quests, and I've made some build choices that I had no way of knowing would not be viable. I'm no stranger to tough tactical battles, but without some kind of mechanic to either respec my points, or grind new points to correct my errors, my game is over.

Man hat schöne Kämpfe, eine normale Story und man kann sich mit dem Spiel gut die Zeit vertreiben.
Zu 90 % kommt man auch mit 1, 2 oder 3 Anläufen durch eine Quest durch. 
Man muss teilweise taktisch gut Denken und seine Schritte im Voraus plannen, was auch sehr viel Spass macht.

ABER, es gibt Quests wo ich selbst nach über 50 Versuchen es nicht geschafft habe diese zu erledigen. Um aber die Story weiter erleben zu können, musste ich ""gezwungenermaßen"" cheaten bzw einen Trainer benutzen der mir hilft die Mission zu schaffen. Sehr nervig!
Das Endspiel ist einfach nur träge und zieht sich ewig in die länge. Alleine das die Gegner ewig für ihren Zug brauchen nervt ab einem gewissen Zeitpunkt, genauso wie die immer gleichen Sprüche der Helden. Wenn man in einer Kampfrunde gegen Gegner mit Gift 10-15 mal den Spruch hören muss ""Ich hasse Gift"" und das über teilweise 20-30 Kampfrunden verzweifelt man irgendwann daran.
Der einzige Grund warum ich mich durch dieses Spiel bis zum Ende durchgeqüält habe, war, dass ich das Ende erleben wollte.
Und....
Einfach nur Enttäuschend. Mehr als das... man sieht die Helden in einer Reihe stehen und der Zwerg fragt die Magierin nur eine einfach Frage die zwar zum Spiel gehört aber in diesem Augenblick absolut unnötig ist.

简练的装备系统很赞并不像其他同类游戏需要频繁更新装备，但是因为三连击和锤击两个技能过于强大导致武器的平衡性不好，除了弓箭、锤斧和双手重武器，其他武器略显鸡肋，还有就是每个NPC的箭卖光了居然是不会刷新的，弓箭手玩着玩着就要满地图找NPC买箭。
最大的亮点应该是主动技能、被动技能和各种属性点都是通过AP值学习的，AP值通过战斗和剧情获得，从而导致这个游戏的加点非常灵活。三个职业战士、法师、弓箭手推荐玩战士和弓箭手，我的队伍是两个战士三个弓箭手（剧情给的两个法师我也当弓箭手练的），战士一个锤盾一个双手重武器，加点直奔近战武器大师和锤击的各种前置，弓箭手全部用弓箭，加点直奔箭术大师和三连击的各种前置，然后被动技能能加命中的优先命中，这游戏90%照样各种miss，主动buff技能三个弓箭手鹰眼要满，疗伤魔法3级能回复创伤就可以，速度最快的满闪电迅移抢先手。法师前置技能太多，技能等级不高没伤害，技能等级高了蓝又不够用，因为属性和技能都是用AP值换的，好用的技能就那么几个还都是弓箭手能学的，这游戏因为AP值弓箭手和法师的界定很模糊。
最后剧情也算这个游戏的一大亮点，突出两个字现实。在游戏里干好事基本就是一句谢谢，干坏事就能拿到不少好东西。结局主角一行杀人犯、纵火犯、色魔、奴隶弄死了带领人民闹革命的伯爵，双方都认为自己做的才是正确的。而主角一行平息内乱之后并没有得到鲜花掌声欢迎歌颂什么的，只是各回各家，被拯救的人民还是过着日复一日的黑色守卫的日子。

Захотелось немного написать для тех, кто только собирается начать проходить эту замечательную rpg.

Для начала, игра мне понравилась! Система заковыристая, есть что покурить. Сюжет средненький, да и ладно. Битвы интересные, практически нет одинаковых карт. 

Советы начинающим:

1. Выбирая что именно качать (какое заклинание или навык) конкретному герою, обратите внимание на его базовые параметры (Храбрость, Ловкость, Сила и т.д) - какие значения сейчас и куда он пойдёт в своём развитии. Это критически важно. От значений параметров будет зависеть шанс срабатывания заклинаний и навыков. Скажем, Нуриму бессмысленно качать навык Лечение ран, а Зурбаран может испытывать трудности с заклинанием Соколиный глаз.

2. Шанс попадания, который Вы видите - очень примерный! В реальности, надо ещё учитывать наличие препятствий (если это выстрел), уворот и блок цели, врождённую косорукость героев. Шанс 90% и выше - ок (но не гарантия!), 70-85% - иногда попадёте, менее 70% - практически нет.

3. Соответственно, в первую очередь раскачивайте попадание. Шанс оного зависит от следующего:
- уровень Боевого навыка владения оружием, которое в руках;
- значение базового параметра Атака / Дальний бой (для ближнего и стрелкового оружия, соответственно), на которые влияют параметры Храбрость, Ловкость, Сила / Сила, Ловкость рук;
- для магии - уровень прокачки заклинания и значения связанных с ним параметров.

3. Что качать? Ещё раз - очень важно попадать часто. Поэтому смотрите п.3. Затем, нужны правильно подобранные Особые умения и заклинания. Также, стоит всем подкачивать Парирование, Уклонение, Инициативу, Здоровье и Скорость (как увеличивая связанные с ними параметры (Ловкость, Телосложение и т.п.), так и осваивая некоторые Особые умения).

4. Навыки (которые небоевые) - в целом, качайте в последнюю очередь! Но есть нюансы. Имеет смысл всем открыть Самоконтроль, Силу воли, Знание улиц и Выживаемость, для получения бонусов. Воинам ближнего боя понемногу качать Самоконтроль, Силу воли (к 5 акту на максимум). Кому-то из стрелков (либо Такате) - развивайте Проницательность (чтобы видеть ловушки). Лечение ран хорошо подойдёт стрелку, но игра проходится и без него, без особых проблем. Ловушки - бесполезно, имхо. Боевое искусство - хороший бонус на максимуме (смена оружия без потери хода), но жаль тратить столько поинтов, смотрите сами. Максимизировать Знание улиц и Выживаемость имеет смысл едва ли, если только для получения ачивки на значение параметра в 20 единиц. Знание животных почти ничего не даёт.

5. Теперь про некоторые Особые умения. 
- Абсолютно всем стоит качать Уклонения и Базовые рефлексы. 
- Случайная атака работает на две клетки, с копьём!
- Максимальный урон ближнего боя даёт Удар молотом.
- Буря выстрелов наносит урон в КАЖДОЙ клетке, что очень хорошо против больших противников.
- Тройной выстрел наносит доп. урон ядом на каждое попадание!
- Мастер лука и Мастер ближнего боя добавляют примерно по одной единице урона к мин. и макс. значению, что очень хорошо.
- Одновременно два одноручных оружия в обеих руках невозможно использовать не для каких спец. ударов, кроме собственно удара двумя оружиями.
- Для чистого мага крайне важна Астральная регенерация.

6. Оружие.
Максимальный урон - луки, двуручные мечи, двуручное ударное.
Хороший урон - арбалет, топоры и жезлы, копья, мечи/сабли (лучше в две руки).
Шпаги, посохи, кинжалы, метательное - имхо, бесполезно в качестве основного оружия именно для боя.

Копьё не стоит недооценивать! Да, урона меньше, чем у других двуручек. Но можно раздавать доп. случайные атаки находясь за препятствием, которое противник оббегает. И, более ценно, легко наносить раны! А по раненному противнику другой персонаж уверенно попадёт и Тройным выстрелом и Ударом молота.

Лучший типа урона - ""от копий"" (infantry в англ. варианте), только не путайте с оружием типа копья! Я хз, что это такое. Но к нему очень мало у кого есть нормальное сопротивление. Также, в целом, хорошо пробивают огненный и магический типы урона.

7. Магия.
Специализируйте ваших чудотворцев! Не пытайтесь выучить и прокачать все заклинания. К слову, полезно Главного героя сделать немножко магом, даже если он будет воином или стрелком. - Возможность скастовать пару заклинаний (подобранных к приоритетным параметрам персонажа) сильно расширит тактические горизонты.

Маг вполне может стать ещё и хорошим лучником. Для Аурелии, например, это сильно полезно, учитывая Тень.

8. Бои.
- Если на карте есть сундуки - постарайтесь открыть все до окончания битвы.
- Яды помогут решить почти любые проблемы, особенно с эффектами ""В ловушке"". 
- Бывают сражения, состоящие из двух-трёх последовательных схваток, без пауз. В таком случае, старайтесь оставить в живых самого слабого и израненного противника, дожидайтесь регена маны и полного восстановления здоровья.
- Не забывайте проверять на ловушки.
- Некоторые противники имеют иммунитет к определённым типам урона. Старайтесь разнообразить ваше вооружение.
- Колдующих противников либо вырубайте, либо закидывайте ядом Вурара (высасывает ману), либо просто фокусьте.

But for every great moment, there was another when I wanted to slit my own wrists...
I bought it out of pure nostalgia, it is an old school, turn based RPG, that you would have played in the '90s.
It is complex in a good way, not so easy like modern PRGs, quests are connected, they form a coherent world.
But the difficulty is uneven. Almost every battle has a gimmick or trick to it, like in one you need to kill a necromancer, and skeletons are spawning endlessly until you do, or in another you have to destroy a crystal, that is healing your enemies, or you need to avoid standing in water etc. It is interesting and fun when it works, but gets very frustrating when it doesn't, and you have no clue what you are supposed to do, and fight off endless waves of enemies until your party dies. Because of this and unclear objectives it sometimes feels unfair, I'm not proud to admit, that I rage-quit it a couple of times.
The story is one of the strong points of the game, it is competently written with genuinely good plot twists, interesting characters. Voice acting is generally decent for an indy game, but there are a couple of weak performances.
But the ending is underwhelming, the only thing I felt was relief, that it's over, and I can stop playing it...
Graphics is dated a bit, but the magic effects look pretty and powerful.
There are a couple of annoying little problems too:Quests are easy to miss. If you restart a battle (and you will), you have to watch the dialogue again and again, you can only skip one line at a time. There is no way to rotate the camera, only elevate it a bit, so sometimes walls, trees and such obstruct your vision of the battle. There is no way to store your gear, so you either drag everything around and encumber your party, or sell everything and hope you will not need it later on.

While not for everyone it has a pretty fun combat mechanic based on the TDE rules and close to XCOM. The story is quite dark and interesting there are some decisions to make but it is not as story driven as classic RPGs like Pillars of Eternity for example.

Before you buy this game you should ask yourself a question: Are you okay with the highly percentage reliant combat? If yes then this game is for you. It is really hardcore and not forgiving you may come to a point in the game when you realize that your party setup is messed up - restart is the only possibilty then. But then again if you use half a brain and don't try to get the jack of all trades but try to specialise the game is really rewarding. There is nothing more satisfying than proceed in the game after 20 tries by using the environment and everything perfectly - and maybe do your decisive kill by a lucky punch in the end.

One of the main reasons for the critics is part of the UI: while you can see the percentage to hit a target (close to XCOM as already mentioned) you can't see your parry chance i.e. once you hit with let's say 75% chance your opponent still has the chance (let's say 50%) to parry your attack. In the end you might only have a chance of 38% for example to actually do damage to your target.
But then again your opponents rely on the same rules.

Back when I played Blackguards, I was really look for something to scratch that tactical rpg itch and it looked like a great fit and- I was not dissapointed. There are certainly low points as the story can lose itself from time to time and make it difficult to be invested, the loading every city and every conversation can get agonizing espicially when continually checking every person in every location is the only real way to make sure you aren't missing content as completing story battles moves the world forward and there are certain huge diffculty spikes in story battles (a certain one protecting a woman from bugs comes to mind). Taking all of this into account, though I still found myself staying up well into the next day playing, which I hadn't done for a single player game in years. 

Slogging into melee feels good, the plethora of spells and the differences from each spell's levels keep combat varied, every map has something to interact with in the environment and no matter how long the loading takes it feels so rewarding to find some guy on the other end of the world that suddenly wants you to clear out a non-story tower after completing a entirely unrelated story mission.

Game is a bit dark and slow (not that that is a bad thing). Story is cryptic so while you want to know more, you cannot count on definite answers.
Half the fun is learning the combat on the fly. You get to realize how inter-actable the environment is (using forcefields to create choke points/preventing flanking or even causing a hallways through your other units who have attacks of opportunity or blowing up swamp gas bubbles etc)
It is rare to have 100% hit chance so some people are complaining about that but I didn't find that to be an issue. Game is difficult but generally, that is what people want from tactical rpgs.

        [td] $2.99 (Normally $19.99)  [/td]
        [td] Wow, I've got to say I got one hell of a sale on this one folks. Very much worth the $2.99 I paid for it. BUT is it worth the $19.99 it normally costs? Yeah honestly it is, I'm not super huge on the whole Turn-based strategy genre but I've got to admit its got a great story that keeps it moving and its not a super long wait between rounds which is really nice. It’s a great game to play on the side of doing some other stuff. [/td]

        [td] 8 stars[/td]
        [td] Like I said I'm not  huge on this genre but damn me if all the turn-based games were like this I would definitely play more of them. The fluid and relatively quick game play in combination with the story line is pretty damn good if you ask me. Though I do wish there was more ability to wander around like you had in the Heroes of Might and Magic games or do a lot of side quests to level up.  [/td]

        [td] 8 stars[/td]
        [td] It's no Lord of the Rings by any means but I've got to say I find it fairly gripping. I mean I've ignored a lot of the side quests pretty easily… its almost like I got tunnel vision there from time to time. The story starts with one of those ""wtf is going on here? I don’t get what's going on…"" sort of situations and if you're anything like me, you've got to find out what is going on…. [/td]

        [td] They all seem to be a decent group of people though some can be a bit brutal in their honesty.  If I had read the community forums prior to purchase I MIGHT have second guessed my purchase. Lets get this straight. The games RNG can be fairly brutal and you may curse it up and down repeatedly. But if you sit back and take your time to really plan out your characters its pretty damn fun. Yes you do have to put some effort into planning ahead with this game! So be prepared to not go and try to make your character an almighty god among men who can do and be anything they want. [/td]

        [td]Ease of Learning[/td]
        [td] 8 stars[/td]
        [td] It's fairly easy to learn and the DO include a pretty good tutorial in the game so read that and you should be good. The trouble is your character planning… I know I had a bit of an issue at the start and had to restart… 6 times I think? Other than that I'd say yeah pretty easy to learn. [/td]

        [td] 9 stars[/td]
        [td] High marks for this one, Like I said I'm not big on this RTS/ Turn-based stuff but the combat is pretty fluid… The combats difficulty spikes on the other hand… wow I thought I had the game all sorted out, then the Bailiff showed up the first time…. Wow was not expecting that sort of resistance. It took me a number of WTF moments before I sorted out my strategy and succeeded. Honestly if your playing to have fun and enjoy the story you may want to hunt down the god cheats or a trainer or something other wise its like reading a book and going back to re read that last battle scene 7-8 times because its garbled English….. written by a 3 yr old….. in crayon…. upside down.

Final Thoughts:
I really didn’t know what to expect when I bought this one, I half watched the videos and thought ""cool a fantasy rpg where I can be a mage…"" and tossed it into the wish list for about half a year, saw it on sale and said to myself ""hell why not.""

В городе можно восстановить силы, поторговаться, выучить новые умения или набрать новых квестов. Никакого шлынданья в реальном времени по локациям нет. Сюжет неплохой, побочки интересные, но без излишеств. Диалоги довольно простенькие, иногда есть возможность подкупить, запугать или выбрать другой предоставляемый вариант.
Главное, чем хороша Блэкгардс - это боёвка.
[u]Интерактивные объекты на поле боя не дадут заскучать и очень разнообразят бои в тактическом плане.[/u]
Тут можно:
- Перерезать верёвку и скинуть люстру на противника
- Укрываться за объектами, типа камней, бочек, столов, шкафов и прочим.
- Преграждать путь опрокидывая ящики и заваливать ими врагов
- Заманивать в болото, капканы, огонь, лужи и прочие ловушки
- Сбивать висящие на дереве пчелиные ульи, которые при падении будут наносить урон 
  ближайшим участникам сражения.
И многое другое.
[u]Так же существует масса условий для прохождения той или иной арены, такие как:[/u]
- Поджечь 3 бочки с маслом возле домов, чтобы помешать пиратам вести дозор
- Пересечь мост за 5 ходов, иначе того, кого мы спасаем повесят 
- Заткнуть все дыры в земле, чтобы оттуда не лезли твари и всех перебить.
- Сбежать с поля боя, но для этого нужно открыть ворота, рычаг от которых скрыт под 
   клеткой, а чтобы её открыть вам 
   необходимо активировать один из 4-х рычагов, Но, если вы не угадаете, то из напольных 
   ловушек вас может обдать 
   огнём + параллельно ещё будут мешать жуки с волками.
- Победить бандитов и следить за бочонком вина, чтобы тот остался целым
- В одной из миссий предлагают незаметно прошмыгнуть мимо стражи, передвигаясь по 
    кустам и обходя фанари.
- Держать оборону и дать гражданскому населению сбежать
- Уворачиваться от булыжников, скидываемых драконом и камней рушащейся пещеры.
И так тому подобное.
Но омрачает всё это великолепие xитpoвыeбанaя боевая система с каким-то eбaнyтым генератором чисел, состоящая из xyeвoй тучи параметров, на которую и жалуются многие игроки. От чего у хорошей игры смешанные отзывы.
Нередко вам сообщают, что процент нанесения урона врагу равен 95%, но всё равно, раз за разом, вы постоянно мажете. А всё потому, что помимо вашего ccaнoгo шанса у противника так же имеется шанс на уклонение, иммунитет или ещё какая xyйHя. От чего, проходя даже на лёгком уровне сложности, иногда, игра даёт вам пpocpaться. Поэтому, 3адротам-хардкорщикам рекомендую не выёбывaтьcя. Так как она не короткая, то зaeбaть сможет кого угодно, даже со своими разнообразными аренами, раз за разом переигрывая одну и ту же xyйHю, 
Прокачка зaдрoтckaя - туча различных параметров на которые тратится только опыт. Предметов в игре overдoxyя, Тут и ловушки, и зелья, броня, масса оружия - в общем, всё на месте.
К управлению и интерфейсу серьёзных претензий нет, за исключением, разве что, нехватки возможности повертеть камерой и ускорить течение времени битвы. Ну и геймпад бы не помешало прикрутить для любителей оных.
Графика добротная, если не ставить совершенно yeбaнckyю постобработку выше ""низких"" настроек, которая делает картинку мутной и блестящей, благодаря убогому блуму с блюром. 
Сделай авторы боевую систему попроще, выкинь оттуда всё лишнее, и более доступней для рядового игрока, скорее всего игра бы снискала больший успех. Если что и способно остановить большинство любителей пошаговщины - это вот эти злoeбyчиe постоянные 90% промахи.",1508743936,1508744583,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Celui a distance t'inflige 10 points de dégats en moyenne alors que tes personnages ne possédent qu'une trentaine de points de vie et celui au corps à corps bloque toutes tes attaques, empoisonne quand il attaque, si tu passe à côté de lui il te met un coup et t'empoisonne et fait du 10 points de dégats aussi, sans oublier qu'il se regénére tous les deux. Comment les battre ?!
- 2éme cas: tu doit sauver une baronne de la pendaison, pour cela le jeu te dit que tu doit passer le deuxiéme ponts en moins de 5 tours MAIS sur le chemin il y a une dizaine de gars qui dès le premiers tour mettent des obstacles sur ton chemin pour pas que tu passe et se mettent à s'agglutiner derriere ces obstacles. Donc tu doit casser les obstacles et faire en sorte de tuer des gars pour te frayé un chemin. SEULEMENT, tu atteint les obstacles à la fin du premier tour, au deuxieme tour tu doit casser les obstacles, au troisieme tour en admétant que tu a réussi à éviter les gars, tu vient seulement de passer le premier pont. Aprés tu te prend sur le deuxiéme pont des piéges invisible qui te coupe net dans ton élan et au cinquiéme tour en admetant toujours que tu arrive a éviter les mecs qui se mettent devant toi pour te bloquer tu arrive à la sauver. CEPENDANT, pour gagner il ne te reste plus qu'a tous les tuer sachant que tu a speeder pour la sauver et donc éviter un max de frapper les gens pour pas gaspiller un tour mais que toi tu a pris tous les dégats du monde, il rest 10 pv à tes personnages pour tuer 10 gars en full pv qui font du 10 points de dégats. Comment faire ?!
De plus, on nous donne des pourcentages de chances de réusite pour les coups donnés, mais quand ta un coup qui a 95% de chance de réussir et que sur une dizaine de coup, il y en a 4-5 qui on raté, on ce pose des questions. Surtout avec le mage, de un il a pas de vie et deux deux il rate quasiment tous ces sorts.

Coraje es lo que siento al analizar un juego que conceptualmente es bastante bueno e interesante pero que técnicamente deja bastante que desear y se convierte en un autentico dolor de muelas.

En efecto, técnicamente el juego es un pequeño desastre. Esta mal optimizado y de ahí parten la mayoría de sus problemas. Depende el ordenador que tengamos tendremos mas o menos bugs, pudiendo incluso quedarnos sin poder avanzar en el juego si tenemos la peor de las suertes. Los tiempos de carga cada vez que cambiamos de pantalla son interminables y para colmo de males tiene muchos de sus logros bugueados.

¿A que entran ganas de salir corriendo y que el ultimo apague la luz ?

Pues claro que si... y mas aun cuando los desarrolladores hace tiempo que dejaron de actualizar el juego y pasan olímpicamente de los bugs y las muchas quejas de los usuarios, lo cual te deja con ganas de quemar algo o lapidar a alguien antes de salir corriendo y olvidarte para siempre del juego.

Pero con lo que no contaba es que pese a todo lo dicho el juego me gustase, lo cual solo contribuye a que aumente mas el coraje y la frustración que siento ante lo que podía haber sido un buen juego y se ha quedado en un juego del montón. Gracias a la falta de ganas y el pasotismo de unos desarrolladores mas interesados en irse de bares con los testeadores que de finalizar bien el juego.

Y es una pena porque el concepto del juego y la puesta en escena son bastantes buenos. Básicamente es un juego de rol ligero, muy centrado en un sistema de combate táctico muy completo y cojonudo, una historia decente y un sistema de creación y desarrollo de personajes, basado en el mundo de Dark Eye, elaborado y completo.

Además el juego se bastante difícil y se preocupa por plantear situaciones y combates muy diferentes para no cansar al jugador y someterle a todo tipo de retos. Algo muy de agradecer porque hay algunos combates realmente complicados, no siempre bien balanceados, que necesitarán de toda nuestra pericia y paciencia para salir bien librados.

¿ Entendéis ahora el motivo de mi enfado ?.

Como amante de los juegos de combate táctico Blackguards lo tenia todo para triunfar conmigo y merecer un análisis mucho mas benigno pero la falta de optimización y de testeo, junto a la nula respuesta para solucionarlo, terminan por lastrar un juego que de otra manera podía haber sido mucho mejor.

Y es que carajo, han sido demasiadas horas repitiendo combates por culpa de los bugs y la dejadez de los tipos de Daedalic a la hora de solucionarlos. 

Para invitatrlos a jamón, vamos. 

Recomendable solamente para los amantes de los juegos de combate táctico y aquellos que sepan armarse de paciencia ante tanto problema técnico.

Abstenerse el jugador medio, le saldrá una ulcera estomacal... o algo peor.

This is a hastily written 'review' *UPDATE*

The real reason why I’m writing this review is because of the hit chance percentages. EVERYBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT THIS. For those who doesn’t know The Dark Eye ruleset this is very confusing. A 100% chance of successfully hitting someone  doesn’t give you a 100% chance of doing actual damage, and I think the percentages are thus misleading, also, the rules aren’t explained anywhere and the rolls aren’t shown in the battlelog. And to be honest, according to the rules, I don’t really know how you can have 100% for certain in the game - you always have minimum change of have a fumble.

I’m going to explain it a little bit with the actual rolls of the core rules. This is by memory actually and I'm just guessing some percentages, since I'm not a mathematician.

THE ROLLS BEHIND COMBAT:

You want to hit an enemy with your sword! You have two actions. One is moving toward the enemy, the other one is swinging with your sword trying to hit him. Your PC has an attack value of lets say 8. Your Rapier has an Attack Value of +1. The Rapier’s special attribute is agility, for every 3 points in agility above 8 you get a +1. You Agility is 14. 14-8= 6. You get a +2 to hit. This means you have to throw lower than 11 with you 20 sided die.

This means you have 55% chance to hit. (This would be a starting level character btw).

If you hit, the following happens.

Your enemy can parry or dodge with his parry or dodge skill. His parry skill is 13. Which is calculated by his DEX. Now he can use every 3 points above a base value 8 for agility. He has an agility of 12. 12-8= 4. So he gets a +1. Which is 14. Now he tries to parry with a short weapon against a medium weapon. He recieves -2 on his parry. He has to roll lower than 12. He has a chance of 60% to parry the weapon.

He can also dodge the attack. A Dodge is your agility divided by 2. 12/2= 6. But he has a skill body control which gives him +1. He has a dodge of 7. Which is too low to use.

You have 55% to hit and the defender 60% chance to defend himself. Which gives you less then 33% in total to hit. But the game will show 55%.

I think the percentages shown ingame are your own hit percentages. Because you can’t know your enemies stats.

THE FUMBLE RULE (IN TDE IT'S CALLED A BOTCH )

Now why still miss when a 100% hit percentage is shown? Two reasons. Probably the game rounds up. Lets say if you have to roll lower than a 19. But if your enemy lies on the ground, this gives you an advantage: making your *chance* 100% to hit: this can even go over 20. Lets say you have to roll lower than 23 to hit. This means that if you roll a 19 + a random disadvantage of + 2 making a 21 still is a hit. But the fumble rule still applies. If you roll a 20 it’s still an instant fumble (or botch as they call it in TDE, fumble is a DnD term) and norally in the P&P the gamemaster may get creative and invents a random failure. An archer misses on 19-20 rolls. So there is always a 5%-10% chance you fumble, and a 5% chance you crit (on rolling a 1) .

(If you played Drakensang, the first game wich uses the same DSA ruleset, there you can even fumble on picking up a flower.)

So in the original P&P, lets say you are in a house with a low ceiling. Your enemy lies unconscious before you on the ground. Let’s kill him in coldblood! You swing your sword full of rage. Outgame you have to roll a d20; let’s say that everything except a 20 hits. You’re unlucky: you roll a 20. The DM decides what happens: your swing your sword above your head in full rage and your sword gets stuck in the ceiling.

ABOUT THE GAME

It’s a difficult and unforgiving game. But it’s somehow still entertaining!

Daedalic is known for making point and click adventure games set in the Dark Eye world. This game is a story driven turn based strategy game with the occasional cutscenes which have some dialogue options for the fluff. The towns and outposts are like in an adventure game, where you can click on merchants or NPC’s. The cutscenes are ok, the way the story is told feels a bid like a normal P&P RPG session. Where a DM narrates what happens and you are given the ILLUSION of choice. But in this game there is NOT much choice, doesn’t matter if you have choice or not: it’s entertaining.

The turn based strategy is very difficult. Gamers without patience will have a hard time restarting the same combat over and over.

It’s fun, It’s hardcore. Its worth playing.",1506366838,1590073492,True,43,2,0.776049554347991943,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Faux rpg, faux tactical, sans aucune variation à la rejouabilité et une brouettée de succès qui ne se valident pas. Ce n'est pas glorieux. Je suppose que j'étais dans un état d'humeur propice au bon gros bourrinage sans réfléchir.

Faux rpg parce que totalement directif. On progresse dans une histoire linéaire qui nous contraint géographiquement et humainement au sens où c'est elle qui décide de qui nous accompagne. Même si on a par moment une impression de liberté, elle se résume à savoir dans quel ordre on va faire les quêtes secondaires accessibles à l'instant t. Les dialogues sont essentiellement destinés à donner une ambiance, il n'auront que très rarement un impact sur la résolution d'une quête secondaire et jamais sur le déroulement de l'histoire à part ceux avec un personnage précis qui détermineront son comportement tout à la fin et uniquement tout à la fin (je l'ai lu sur le forum parce que personnellement j'ai toujours eu la même fin sans jamais comprendre quels combinaisons de mes choix m'y avait conduit). La linéarité de l'histoire et l'absence d'impact de la majorité des dialogues ne serait pas forcèment une tare rhédibitoire si l'ensemble ne se traduisait pas en une forte contrainte dans le développement des persos. Au-delà de la nécessité de développer certaines compétences critiques et de l'inutilité des sorts de bas-niveau qui en canibalisant les points conduisent à l'habituel min-max, Blackguards nous encourage trop fortement à développer un archer et privilégier les armes contondantes pour qu'on se sente maitre de notre équipe qui, cerise sur le gateau, nous est imposée et modifiée sans préavis.
Après il y a un autre aspect que je trouve un peu dommageable pour un RPG et qui est l'absence d'exploration, l'histoire nous propose des points accessibles sur une carte, à la manière d'un Hard West et les interactions en ville se font sur des images fixes. Mais bon le goût de l'explo c'est du goût perso, pas un défaut absolu du jeu.

Faux tactical parce que de nombreuses cartes sont très typées et ne se résoudront que d'une seule façon, genre fermer tous les tunnels, utiliser les flaques inflammables... Les cartes à résoudre par nous-mêmes en combat pur sont pour la plupart beaucoup trop petites pour développer une quelconque manoeuvre ou tenir une quelconque position. La tactique se résume à essayer de maintenir les archers à distance de tir, et encore, une fois atteint un bon développement leurs compétences spéciales et talent leur permettent de s'affranchir de toute contrainte de distance. 
Bon il y a un aspect RNG qui décoiffe. Perso ça ne me choque pas, des séries de ratés ou de réussites improbables c'est juste la vrai vie. Mais contrairement à un XCOM où tout est rattrapable, l'affrontement des boss de Blackguards m'a renvoyé à mes pires souvenirs de combat d'Age Of Decadence, si vous ratez vos premiers coups et que l'ia réussi les siens, il n'y a plus qu'à recharger, point barre. 
A noter que ce typage très fort des combats est plutôt décourageant en début de jeu parce que, le temps de piger la logique du truc à exploiter dans l'environnement, on a l'impression d'aller de combat impossible en combat impossible, j'ai failli désinstaller Blackguards au bout d'une heure face au premier troll. Donc si vous prenez ce jeu, préparez vous à devoir vous accrochez. L'effet pervers de cette résolution de combat façon puzzle est que, une fois plongé dans cette logique, bizarrement en progressant vers des adversaires de plus en plus costaud, l'impression de difficulté s'estompe et ne tient plus qu'à la RNG.
  
Tout ceci l'un dans l'autre fait que la rejouabilité est théoriquement nulle. Sauf à vouloir se vider la tête comme c'était manifestement mon cas quand j'ai pris ce jeu. 

Je vais quand même recommander ce jeu parce que primo l'histoire m'a plu, vraiment l'histoire l'univers lui est quelconque, deuxio/secundo cette façon de résoudre les combats à le mérite de la variété, Blackguards n'est pas un jeu où l'on répéte le même combat au fil des rencontres, tertio/troizio mener une partie au bout représente suffisament de temps de jeu pour que la non rejouabilité ne soit pas critique.",1506319635,1506322142,True,2,0,0.511757016181945801,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Чем-то напомнило настольный Descent.
Разработчики отказались от прорисовки множества переходов в угоду других аспектов игры: здесь не будет бесконечной беготни по полупустынным локациям, лишь акцент на боевке, прокачке и квестах. Тактическая составляющая весьма неплоха (ОМГ, игра, где магические стены реально тащат).

Порадовало разнообразие сценариев столкновений, которые не всегда сводятся к банальному ""перебей-их-всех"". Для этого на карте расположены особые объекты, области и различные условия для прохождения / улучшения исхода столкновения.

Что может сначала отпугнуть - так это система прокачки: в ходе прохождения герои получают опыт, который сразу же могут тратить на улучшения себя родимых. По началу ввиду большого количества возможностей это вводит в ступор (классика: больше выбора - меньше выбора).

======================

Попробовать ее определенно стоит, не обращая внимания на негативные отзывы, которые, в большинстве своем далеки от реальности. Посему - немного каках в адрес хейтеров.

[list]*Провисает FPS, игра вылетает.[/list]
Бегал на ноуте 7-летней давности, ел как милую, проблем не заметил.

[list]*Слабый сюжет, нераскрытые персонажи.[/list]
Ввиду малого времени игры не могу говорить наверняка.
Тут уже личное ИМХО каждого: в игре нет огромных простыней диалогов и журнала с бесконечно интересной (нет) историей всего и вся, касающегося мира. В плане сюжета игра легкая, непринужденная, но при этом не является пустышкой. Не шедевр и не визуальная новелла - и на том спасибо.
Персонажи частично шаблонные, но не картонные. Того же Ласку уже на миссии с баронессой хотелось загрызть собственными зубами =\

[list]*ШАНС ПОПАДАНИЯ 90% А ПОСТОЯННО МИМО КОКОКО[/list]
Мы, конечно же, помним, что помимо отображаемого шанса попадания есть и другие условности, такие, как вероятность уворота и блока, которые считаются после прохождения проверки на попадание. Шайзе, это основы основ, а не китайско-корейский рандом.

[list]*Герой падает / застревает / прищемливает яичко на точках карты.[/list]
Еще в обучении ставят перед фактом, что некоторые ячейки имеют особые свойства. И то, что герои вывелись из строя еще до конца первого хода - виной тому не косяк игры, а чья-то невнимательность.

สายเวทมนต์ ควรพัฒนาเวทมนต์ให้เต็ม เพราะจะช่วยโอกาสพลาดร่ยพลาดลดลง

ข้อดี
- ภาพกราฟิกสวยงาม ตามหัวข้อแนวเกมมืดมน ฉากช่วยงาม ด่านฉากต่อสู้ออกแบบได้ดี มีเหตุผล มีการวางสิ่งช่วยเหลือในแต่ละด่านที่ไม่ซ้ำกัน ช่วยทำให้ผู้เล่นสงสัยต้องลองกดให้อยู่ทุกครั้ง
- ปริศนาไม่ยากจนเกินไปที่ทำไม่ได้ แต่ต้องให้สมองคิดแก้ไขมันให้ได้
- ของทุกชิ้นในเกมล้วนมีผลกับการต่อสู้ ไม่ว่าจะกับดัก พิษ ค่าสถานะต่างๆ ส่งผลกับตัวละครเป็นอย่างมาก
- เกมมีความสม่ำเสมอสูงมาก ในด้านตรรกะตัวเลข ไม่ต้องกลัวว่า AI หรือตัวละครเราเก่งจนชนะมาง่ายๆ จนรู้สึกเบื่อ
- เกมไม่ยึดติดกับการใช้อาวุธ เราสามารถให้นักเวทย์ใช้อาวุธอะไรก็ได้ นอกจากไม้เท้า
- ระบบเกมทำำให้ผู้เล่นต้องคิด วิเคราะห์ของที่เก็บมาได้ เพราะช่องเก็บของมีน้ำหนักเกินเมื่อไร ทำให้ต้องทิ้งของก่อนสู้ มันช่วยให้ผู้เล่นต้องคิดว่าอะไรจำเป็นจริงๆ ทำให้ไม่รู้สึกจะใช้อะไรก็ได้เพราะมีหมด มันทำให้ดูง่ายเกินไป
- เกมยากมาก ดังนั้นเราควรเลือกคลิกทีละช่อง เพื่อให้ระวังตัวอยู่เสมอ
- ยาพิษ สามารถใช้ได้ ก่อนเข้าสู่ด่านทุกครั้ง (ยกเว้นยาเพิ่มค่าสถานะ)
- เกมไม่ใช้ Spec มาก
- ดนตรีเข้ากับฉากเป็นอย่างดี

ข้อเสีย
- มี Bug เล็กน้อยๆ ที่อาจทำให้ตัวเกมค้างได้อยู่บ่อยๆ วิธีแก้ คือ โหลดเกมแล้ว ให้อยู่ฉากนั้นไว้ซะพัก เพราะตรรกะเกมอาจไม่ดีพอที่ทำให้ GPU รับส่งข้อมูลได้เร็วพอตามประสิทธิของ GPU จริงๆ เพราะมันจะ""ค้างช่วงหน้าโหลดตอนเข้าฉากใหม่""
- มี Bug เกี่ยวกับน้ำหนักของที่เก็บ คงเป็นเพราะตรรกะไม่ถูกต้องทำให้บางที ของเหมือนเดิม แต่ออกฉากมา ดันเกินซะงั้น T_T
- ภารกิจหลักง่ายกว่าภาระกิจรอง ภารกิจรองยากมากๆ

ถึงระบบมี Bug ร้ายแรง แต่ตัวเกมไม่ได้ห่วยแตกจนซื้อมาไม่คุ้มกับการที่ที่ได้ลองทดสอบสมองหรอก วิธีการแก้ค้าง ก็จบตัวเกมจาก ""ตัวจัดการงานได้เลย""

คำแนะนำ
เหมาะสำหรับคนชอบเกมแก้ปริศนา ชอบความท้ายท้ายและชอบทดสอบตนเอง เพราะถ้าใครชอบเล่นเกมง่ายมาเล่นเกมนี้ อาจจะไม่ชอบ ทำให้มาวิจารณ์เกมเสียๆหายๆได้ เพราะเกมนี้ไม่ได้สร้างมาเพื่อพึ่งพลังตัวละครแล้วชนะๆแบบง่ายๆอย่างเกม ฝึ่งเอเชีย แต่ให้พึ่งพาสมองผู้เล่นเท่านั้น เพื่อให้ได้รู้จักการแก้ไขปัญหามากขึ้น ถ้าผ่านด่านแล้ว จะรู้สึกภูมิใจกับการชนะอย่างมาก และได้เรียนรู้อะไรมากมายจากเกมนี้

คะแนน
- ด้านภาพและฉาก 10/10
- ด้านระบบ 8/10 หัก Bug เกมค้าง
- ด้าน AI 9/10 (AI ไม่เอาเราได้ซะเท่าไร ทั้งๆที่เกมเป็นตาราง เลยนำตรรกะของหมากรุกมาใช้ แต่คนเขียน จะเขียนมาไม่ให้มันทำร้ายผู้เล่นมากเกินไป)

Blackguards is a straightforward, simple RPG with short battles that are easy to complete in a short time frame, so that's already a plus. There's something about the setting that's nice too - the world is nicely presented and portrayed, considering the budget the game was clearly under. 

The combat and RPG elements are mostly pretty entertaining. There aren't any levels, just experience points you can throw into any part of your character development more or less whenever you want, though you probably won't have points to max out everything you want for each character. My only complaint would be that there are a lot of key skills locked to certain trainers in the world who can be hard to find, and it's never clear who trains what without individually mousing over skills while visiting them.

Combat is pretty typical tactical fare, though it has the usual RNG problem of attacks with very high percentage odds seeming to miss half the time. I think this is because the game displays your base chance to hit, but doesn't factor in your opponent's chance to dodge or parry - bad interface design for sure if that's the case, and in any case it's annoying how often your attacks miss. On the other hand your opponents' attacks will miss a lot too, so it's kind of a wash. Still, basic but fun combat here. Sometimes neat stuff happens, like the time my dwarf knocked back an opponent and he flew past two of my spearmen, each of whom attacked him spontaneously using their attack of opportunity as he flew past, killing him before he stopped moving.

A note about the marketing - the game is trying to sell itself as being a dark and violent game about criminals, but it's really not much darker than any other fantasy RPG. The main characters are mostly criminals, sure, but they're more the loveable rogue type than actually repulsive people - there's a mage in particular with a hilariously over-acted voice who's really fun to listen to, but even the dreamweed-addicted elf and the arsonist dwarf are more quirky than anything. And the game's story is still a typical save-the-world plot, despite a bit of grit thrown in. Go in expecting typical fantasy with a slightly darker edge, and your expectations will be met.

All in all, a fun if not particularly remarkable RPG. Worth a look!",1500165447,1500165537,True,6,0,0.556313991546630859,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Игра однозначно стоит внимания, и вот почему:
1. Геймплей - по факту, состоит из кликов мышки по глобальной карте/районам городов для перемещения героев и общения с персонажами и из тактической части, где герои оказываются на классической ""клетчатой"" арене и сражаются пошагово. Тактическая часть тут реализована на ""отлично"", хотя и не без огрехов. Почти всегда мы оказываемся в невыгодном положении, окружённые превосходящими силами противника. НО, из любой ситуации на поле боя можно выйти с честью, и для этого нам дано много тактических возможностей. Это и интерактивные предметы, которые используются против врага, и собственные навыки и заклинания, многие из которых ""заточены"" под командный бой, и разнообразие оружия/метательных снарядов/ядов/зелий/ловушек, помогающих склонить чашу весов на нашу сторону. В общем, в тактическом плане есть где разгуляться)))
2. Сюжет - звёзд с неба не хватает, но способен удивить парой поворотов. Классическая история заключённого, пытающегося вернуть себе воспоминания и доброе имя вместе с командой таких же отщепенцев, и попутно спасающего мир от страшной угрозы. Команду мы получаем тоже классическую, без всяких когнитивно диссонирующих персонажей со страшными тайнами и запутанными взаимооношениями. У нас есть типичный гном, постоянно ворчащий и лезущий в драку с бандитами и драконами, хитроумный маг-серцеед из далёкой страны, эльфийка-лучница с тягой к дурман-траве (бывает и такое), молчаливый и нелюдимый дикарь и язвительная ведьма. Каждый из них преследует свои цели, но, волею судеб, они объединяются в команду.
3. RPG-составляющая. Она, без сомнения, великолепна. На старте решаем судьбу класса нашего персонажа, который может быть воином, магом или охотником (небольшая подсказка-спойлер - для сбалансированной игры лучше брать охотника). А далее - у нас есть куча всяких разных ""вкусностей"" для прокачки - характеристики, боевые и небоевые навыки, заклинания (только у магов), пассивные и активные способности. Причём навыки и заклинания имеют ещё по четыре ступени владения ими с определёнными бонусами на каждой ступени. Способностям и заклинаниям мы учимся у наставников, разбросанных по миру, и для овладевания ими необходим определённый уровень характеристик. В общем, вся прокачка взаимосвязанна. Многие ругают её за излишнюю громоздкость и непонятность, но достаточно потратить 5-10 минут времени на изучение этой взаимосвязи либо прочтение руководства, заботливо оставленного в меню разработчиками, и всё станет понятно.
4. Заклинания - о них отдельный разговор, так как они дают очень серьёзные тактические преимущества, и маги в игре на вес золота. В нашем арсенале имеются атакующие, защитные, усиливающие, ослабляющие, ограждающие, призывающие чары, владение которыми не раз изменит ход битвы. Тактических возможностей и комбинаций очень и очень много.
Это были основные плюсы, теперь немного о минусах:
1. Злобный товарищ рандом, выдающий иногда промах за промахом при 80-90% попадания.
2. Малый, в отличие от оружия, выбор доспехов.
3. Забагованность некоторых ачивок (если это кому-то важно).

Резюмируя - достойный представитель тактики/RPG.

Vypsat pozitiva této hry je docela težké, protože co se jednomu bude zdát jako pozitivum druhý odsoudí, ano zní to jako klišé, ale u téhle hry to naprosto přesně platí! 

Rozlučte se s nějakým akčním pobíhání po mapě, klikáním o stosedm, či možností, že čím rychlejší palec na myši či ovladači, tím větší výhodu proti nepřátelům získáte. V této hře získáte jedinou výhodu svým přemýšlením a zhodnocením situace na mapě! Celý svět totiž na bojišti probíhá v rámci tahů, a v jakémsi přeneseném smyslu je zmrařený i mimo něj - Kdy kromě filmů posouvajících děj, se vše odehrává vše jen na interaktivních obrazovkách podobných adventurám.

Boje, pokud tedy fandíte tahovým strategiím, jsou skutečně skvělé, povětšinou totiž pracují s interaktivním (Alespoň většinou) Prostředím, které dovoluje získat nad nepřáteli nějakou tu výhodu a rozhodnout bitvu ve svůj prospěch - A třebaže většina výhod je bojová, taktická a hra se týká převážně bojů, hra nabízí zcela jiný rozměr než jen bezduché zabíjení stylem ""Nejsilnější a nejodolnější přežije a zvítezí!"" Což dokazuje hned jedna z prvních bitev, kde kromě možností útoku proti nepříteli, vyčkání v obraně, převrhnutí stolu a vytvoření barikády či zacpání průchodu obráncem a pouštění nepřátel po jednom zkrátka máte možnost v jiných hrách nemožnou, a to shodit na napřátele lustr a rozplácnout je v jednom tahu! A podobných vychtávek je ve hře skutečně plno. Stačí je najít a využít! Takže co se taktiky týče, boje jsou skutečně lahůdka.

Grafika je na ucházející až více než slušné úrovni! Možná by se hodilo trošku více byhlazených textur pro obličeje které ve filmech jsou trochu hranaté, ale co se týče bojů, tak vás grafika vyloženě potěší, zvláště co se různých míst týče, jejichž rycyklace je vyloženě minimální (Ale putyky prostě budou vypadat stejně, bažiny prostě budou bažinaté, jeskyně jeskyňovaté) Ale jinak co bojová mapa, to unikát, co do taktického řešení, to nepřátel. A nutno říci, že i když jsou nepřátele dějově statičtí, možností jejich likvidace je vždy několiv, takže si hru užijete i když si jí zahrajete například podruhé, či potřetí (Podesáté to asi už vážně výzvanebude).

Vyloženě skvělý je systém vývoje postav, trochu sice zamrzí poněkud nevkusně nastavený limit 18 u atributů a skillů, který při vyloženě úzké specializaci dosáhnete někde v půlce hry, takže místo toho, aby jste si udělali extra smrtící postavu se statistikami třeba 22, jste nuceni hrát s 18, a další body dávat do zcela nepotřebných a nevyužívaných jiných atributů, protože hra vás prostě přez limit 18 nepůstí - Což považuji za hodně velký mínus. Protože vás hra neskutečně tlačí k multyfunkčnosti, místo výroby úzce specializovaného zabijáka například jednou zbraní či kouzlem, ale samotný systém vývoje postav ""Dračího oka"" Je vážně úžasný, jak ukazují i jiné hry na tomto systému (Osobně se mi tento systém líbí i více než například Dungeon Dragons, ale tak to je asi věc každého osobně).

Hudba je podle mě velice povedená, nemám jí co vytknout, ale jako hudebně absolutně hluchá osoba si to netroufnu recenzovat, jen podotknu že jsem nikdy neměl potřebu hudbu vypínat nebo přehlušovat třeba rádiem či hudbou z jiného zdroje, což je u mě co říci.

Trochu flustrace asi některým hráčům nabídne těžce koridorový a nalinkovaný příběh, kde prostě nemáte šanci uhnout mimo vedlejší úkoly, s tím je naneštěstí potřeba se smířit, ale vzhledem k tomu, že je hra oproti jiným hrám vedena tahovým stylem to není zdaleka tak rušivé jako kdyby jste měly pseudo volný svět (Srovnám například s druhým dílem Dragon Age) zde koridorový příběh vůbec není na škodu i když možná někomu ne úplně ne sedne - Zvláště asi když hru bude hrát poprvé a na začátu druhé kapitoly potká hráče překvapení onoho mnou nesnášeného stylu ""Nemůžeš nic dělat, dějově to prostě bude takle a basta"" Protože autoři rozhodli, že děj příběhu se bude odvíjet tudy - S tím je opět třeba se smířit. A nepočítat s volným světem, tato hra jej prostě nenabízí.

Příběh samotný je v prologu, první a druhé kapitole docela svižný (A to díky právě svémi úzkému koridoru) V třetí kapitole se svět trochu otevře a musím říci, že to příběhu moc neprospěje! Není to vyloženě negativní, ale ztratí to jistý šmrc, onu atmosféru děje který vás tlačil a nutil k akcím jenž stje prováděli kapitoly předtím. Což se poté trochu usměrní v kapitole čtyři, al to již směřujete ke konci, který je poněkud. Nu. Řekněme, že závěr, ale hlavně jeho souboje vám dají tu pravou zkoužku toho jak jste pochopili tuto hru, že je o taktice a práci s mapou, ne jen síle postav, ale i o taktizování, interakci, plánování a vůbec kombinaci všeho co jste zatím v kapitolách předešlích měli možnost odehrát a vidět v akci, nyní uvést do praxe.

Negativa (Pro labilní jedince): ANO!

Pokud z něčeho ve hře budete šílet, přesněji mít chuť vyhodit počítač z okna, zabít mladšího sourozence, povraždit své rybičky nebo zkrátka provést něco podobně iraciálního a násilného tak je systém, přesněji spíše chaos ""miss"" tedy neúspěchů na selhání kouzla nebo útoků. Jestli jste si někdy říkali, že se proti vám někdy spiklo nějaké temné božstvo, někdo vás proklel pomoví woodo panenky, tak tato hra vám dokáže, že tomu skutečně je!

Pokud například máte šanci na zásah něpřítele 95% (Indikátor ukazuje tuto šanci na úspěch skillu/Speciálního útoku před použitím) Zcela běžně se vám stane, že 3 z 5 útoků vyzní do ztracena!

Nebo pokud vám z tohoto ještě nezběleli, či nezešedivěli vlasy na hlavě, a nevythali jste si to co z nich snad zbylo a nerozvážně jste si vzali kouzelníka (Mimochodem, garantuji vám, že kouzelníka kterého dostanete do party jako NPC budete ze všech NPC v družině proto nejvíce nesnášet!) Tak věřte, že po deseti soubojích budete mít sto chutí ho rozsekat na kaši a tou kaší nakrmit červi a ty znovu rozsekat!

Pakliže sesíláte kouz!lo se šancí cca. 81-89% zcela běžně se vám stane, že dané kouzlo nesešlete i 4-5 kol za sebou, a jen zoufale koukáte na animaci jakési jiskřící energie a ohně, jak vašemu kouzelníku teče z rukou z hláškou ""Next time!"" A podobně!

Zcela upřímně, mnohem častěji jsem zasáhnul se svojí kouzelnicí mečem se šancí 60% na ""Mele hit"" Než abych sesla fireball s kouzelníkem, jenž měl šanci na seslání 81-94% (Případně zasáhl speciálním skillem se zásehem 80-95%) Takže pokud vám z něčeho zbělejí vlasy hrůzou na hlavě je to procentuální systém/Chaos generující zásah, úspěšnost skillů který bohužel funhuje stylem:

100% - zásah
0-99% pravděpodobný zásah, ovšem čím blíže 100% tím nižší šance na úspěch, takže s 60% často trefíte mnohem častěji než s 80% nebo 90% - Zní to nelogicky? Bohužel, po 10-15 soubojích z toho zešedivíte!

***

Takže co říci závěrem? Pokud bych měl udělit hodnocení dal bych slušných 80% Původně jsem si sice chtěl dát 85% ale pět jsem strhnul právě za ten koridorový příběh, který mě včera deprimoval když moji hrdinové zcela bezmocně stáli v obklíčení u otrokářeské karavany, kam se vidali zachránit nějakého zcela neznámého troubu. U Plexe, nejsou to žádní dobráci, vůbec nechápu co tam lezli?

Tá certo, dáva pra melhorar muito, mas ele diverte.

Blackguards é uma mistura de RPG em turnos com point´n´click. As batalhas são em turno, mas a história se desenrola sobre cenários onde as possibilidades de diálogos já ficam marcadas. Eu agradei e tb não vi ninguém reclamando disso.

O sistema utilizado é complexo, mas não é difícil de entender. É bem verdade que terminei o jogo sem entender direito algumas coisas, mas isso é outra história. kkk. Uma coisa interessante é que o tamanho do personagem é levado em conta. Vc pode atirar uma flecha no oponente mesmo se um anão estiver na frente. Mas se um humano estiver na frente já não pode. Isso influencia tb no dano, um char muito alto dá menos dano em inimigos muito pequenos. Interessante...

No mais o jogo tem uma dificuldade razoável. Algumas lutas são fáceis demais e outras (bem poucas) são complicadas e exigem muita estratégia e sorte. Há possibilidade de interagir com o ambiente, o que torna algumas batalhas bem fáceis.

A história é sofrível, linear e não empolga. Assim são tb as sidequests. Os personagens tem o carisma de um zumbi. kkk
Faltou um capricho com armas e armaduras, elas não são muitas. Os drops são poucos e há tb poucas magias para se utilizar. O quinto capitulo é bem maçante e as duas ultimas lutas eu não tenho vergonha de falar q coloquei no easy pq não aguentava mais. kkk. Mas mesmo com todos esses defeitos, Blackguards me divertiiu por mais de 4 meses nessas 56 horas que eu joguei.

Nesse precinho que está é quase uma pechincha!! Se vc gosta de um RPG em turnos, pode ir na fé!

I mean, ok, a lot of them are about too hard level and that there is sometimes only one way to pass the battle and that it's hard to find it. I can see that it's bothering some people but for me it's actually one of the biggest pros. Game is not only the story, fact that I have to think and actually struggle a little with defeating my opponents makes my gameplay a lot more interesting. Furthermore, in the most of the battles there are actually a lot of ways to go through it, and that you can choose what is the best fit for you is super cool. OK, leaving level's topic behind, I really like characters (voice actors did SO GOOD WORK, like, reaaaallyyy, I can play this only for listening to Zurbaran accent) and storyline here. Also most of side-quests are cool  but it's true that they are more like side-MUST-TO-DO-TO-BE-ENOUGH-POWERFUL-FOR-MAIN-QUEST-quest... still it'd be a shame to not see what's in them so that's ok.

Edit: I decided to actually play the game a year after my initial 2-hour review, and while there is some semblance of an actual CRPG in here, it's chock-full of bugs, confusing mechanics, and superlinear storyboarding.

The game, once again, is not a Darkest Dungeon clone where you manage boxed criminals into doing all your adventuring, but a standard The Dark Eye Tabletop Adventure with a mostly pre-generated party of True Neutral adventurers, half of whom happen to be criminals, while half are equally as guilty.

Except your party is imbalanced from start to finish. Two warriors, two mages, and a TEMPORARY archer who has to go back [spoiler]to her addiction, followed by getting killed by a giant monster for the Arena's amusement[/spoiler]. While the game has a complex cross-class system to compensate for this imbalance, it's too complex; trying to discover the system on your own will mainly result in poor long-term skill point choices that you won't discover until it's far too late, and there are no re-specs. (Also, don't use skill books unless they're absolutely useful. They eat up your AP and I guarantee you can find every single skill from a trainer somewhere in the world for free.)

Story wise, the game cripples itself. While the adventure and its modules are fairly entertaining, nearly all of your choices only influence a single consequence: [spoiler]whether or not your mage decides to screw you over. It all boils down to whether you blindly trust a former murder-cultist or the rest of your semi-unhinged team, and is strange and disturbing overall.[/spoiler]. Your main character has little to no impact on the story otherwise, as your other party members will do all the charismatic (or anti-charismatic, in the case of the melee units) talking for you.

But the worst mechanic is the special win-conditions; rather than spice up the fight, they typically turn it into a slog-fest as you fumble around looking for the exact tile to stand next to, so you can waste an entire turn activating some obscure background-looking object that MAY help you or just complicate the battlefield even further. Ever tried conquering a narrow maze filled with respawning Crypt Lice and a dozen pressure pads that will lock the exit door?

[b]= The below is a personal review/feeling of the game, you may feel differently! =[/b]

The goods
1. ""The complex rule system"". All these stats doing all sorts of different things! A must for the sophisticated(?) nerdy RPGer.
2. Equipment changes the character outlook (even made me use a lesser equipment just for the looks that I prefered)
3. Each hero (or should I say villain) has a unique touch of personality in the story
4. Graphics/Animation of skills shows the effort of the developers.

The bads
1. Not-so-good-working ""The complex rule system"".
If I see a 60% hit chance, I expect to hit 6 times out of 10 tries, or 3 out of 5.
But I miss most of the time.
The game is a liar in this sense and no one likes to be lied to.
2. Limited AP (Adventurer Points) to level up your characters.
No random mobs. All encounters are pre-decided.
3. Some encounters are almost impossible if you level-up incorrectly due to the limited AP.
Makes you restart the game because you cannot go any further.
So don't think of making a jack-of-all-trades bard-like character...
Your frustration level will rise to max gauge.
4. Receive same amount of set Experience points (or Adventure Points) for each encounter, no matter how many opponents you fell. There are some encounters where you will meet infinite (respawning) mobs. If you down 1 mob and finish the objective, it will give you the same reward as downing 100 mobs before finishing the objective.

[b]= conclusion =[/b]
It almost felt like a puzzle game more than an RPG because some (if not most) encounters had specific methods to win easily. Other methods, not so easy or impossible (to me).
Personally, I like to farm/grind, especially when I cannot beat a certain area but not with Blackguards.

Perhaps you will survive better than me but comparing the enjoyment to the frustration level, Blackguards is not recommened.",1496137433,1496150460,False,25,1,0.721314132213592529,0,True,False,False,False,,,

* Engaging storyline with memorable characters
* Good conversion of the Dark Eye system with a few tweaks for balance
* Each combat is different thanks to hand-crafted maps with interactive environments

The Bad:
* The Astral regeneration mechanic pretty much forces you to artificially prolong fights so that your casters can regain their astral power (as this only works during combat), making mid-to-late-game combats more painful than fun
* Not available under Linux

Das Spiel ist weit besser, als die meisten Reviews Euch glauben machen wollen. Es ist absolut nicht unfair in dem Sinne, wie viele, viele der Schreiber suggerieren. Aber: es hat eine Menge Design-fehler und man sieht dem Spiel leider an, dass es nicht von Taktikern, sonder von Storyschreibern kreirt wurde.
Normalerweise würde ich dem Spiel nie und nimmer eine Kaufempfehlung geben, ich nehme nur den Daumen hoch um ein Gegengewicht zu all den Verrissen zu bieten.

BITTE STEAM macht einen NEUTRAL-Button!

Die lange Version:
Zuerst einmal möchte ich klarstellen, dass ich nicht ganz neutral sein kann. Ich spiele DSA-Spiele seit 1984, als die erste Box herauskam und ich bin ein Fan von Daedalic, die so großartige Spiele wie ""A new Beginning"" oder ""The whispered World"" heraus gebracht haben, ganz zu schweigen von der weithin beliebten Deponia-Reihe (die nicht mein Geschmack ist) oder den Edna und Harvey-Spielen. Man könnte mich also als einen ""Fanboy"" bezeichnen. Wer jedoch meine Reviews liest, der weiß, dass ich dadurch eher noch kritischer werde, schließlich hat sogar X-Com2 einen dicken Daumen runter von mir bekommen.

Mit Blackguards hat Deadalic sich an ein Genre gewgt, dass eigentlich außerhalb ihrer Expertiese liegt: dem taktischen RPG. Das Spielprinzip ist dabei denkbar einfach. Über Vorgegebene Wege reist man zu verschiedenen Orten, wo man Quests annehmen kann (oder muss), die dann in einer Art ""Kampfarena"" gelöst werden. Innerhalb dieser Arena laufen die Kämpfe absolut rundenbasiert ab, man zieht abhängig von einem Initiative-Wert über ein Hexgitter, gibt Befehle wie verschiedente Nahkampf- oder Fernkampf-Angriffe oder aber Zauber, dann kommt der nächste dran. Jede Figur verfügt dabei über 2 Aktionen, wobei die eine Aktion immer eine Bewegungsaktion darstellt und die andere für das Benutzen von Gegenständen oder Attacken oder Bewegungen etc. ausgegeben werden kann. Macht man erst diese zweite Aktion, so verfällt die erste. Das alles erinnert stark an Spiele wie die X-com Reihe. So weit, so gut.

Doch hier kommt schon der erste schwere Design-Fehler um die Ecke. Denn das Kampfsystem basiert auf DSA-Regeln und diese sind nunmal nicht intuitiv. Zudem werden Zahlenwerte eingefügt, die nur die halbe Wahrheit erzählen und die für die große Wut in den anderen Reviews sorgen. In jedem Kampf bekommt man nämlich eine Anzeige, mit wieviel Prozent eine Aktion, bspw. eine Attacke, gelingt. Doch dieser Zahlenwert berücksichtigt NICHT die Verteidigung des Ziels! So kann man durchaus bei einem Gegner, der bspw. 30% Ausweichen hat, ein Drittel seiner Schläge ins Leere hauen, auch wenn man 95% Angriffschance hat. 
Dies ist nicht in dem Sinne Unfair, nur nicht unbedingt ersichtlich. Macht man aber während des Kampfes die Konsole an, so sieht man sehr schön, was im Hintergrund ""gewürfelt"" wird. Es geht alles mit rechten Dingen zu, es wird nur, und das ist ein schwerer Designfehler(!), nicht erklärt.

Der nächste Designfehler liegt in manchen Maps. Denn so manche Map ist extrem einfach, wenn die erste Runde ""gelingt"" und fast unschaffbar, wenn sie nicht gelingt. Das könnte bspw. sein: gelingt mein erster Schuß auf den Gegnerischen Caster? Gelingt oder Mißlingt der Debuffzauber? Werde ich am Anfang vergiftet oder weiche ich aus? Usw.. Endlosspawns und daraus enstehende Pattsituationen, wo es nicht vor und zurück geht, tragen da nicht zur Verbesserung der Motivation bei.

Für mich der schwerste Designfehler liegt jedoch in der Gruppenzusammenstellung. Ich bin eh kein Fan von Begleitern, die ich mir im Laufe des Spiels zusammen suchen muss. Die optimale Gruppenzusammenstellung zu finden und Charactere selbst zu erstellen und aufeinander ab zu stimmen ist ein wichtiges Taktik- und Spaßelement, dass den meisten modernen Spielen schlicht fehlt. 
Doch mir nicht nur vorgekaute Chars zu geben, sondern diese auch immer mal wieder aus der Gruppe zu entfernen oder ihrer wichtigsten Fähigkeit zu berauben geht meiner Meinung nach gar nicht. Ich hätte gerne EINEN Fernkämpfer, den ich von Anfang an oder wenigstens vom Moment, wo ich ihn finde, dabei habe. So hatte ich ein Großteil des Spiels 3 sehr ähnliche Nahkämpfer und einen Caster. Da ist mit den DSA-Regeln aber mehr Variation möglich!

Noch ein Fehler? Aber immer doch! In den DSA-Regeln werden Waffengattungen unterschieden und beherrsche ich die eine, kann ich noch lange nicht mit einer anderen umgehen. Dazu muss ich erst ein weiteres Talent steigern. 
Das finde ich gut so, doch - das Spiel hat mehrere Flashbacks, wo ich gezwungen bin mit einem Holzschwert oder einer Axt zu kämpfen, völlig egal, ob ich das kann. Dabei wäre es so einfach, eine Waffe entsprechend der Fähigkeit zu zu teilen... 
Ich kann ja nachvollziehen, wenn es Storybedingt ist (also man beim Gefängnisausbruch keine Waffe aussuchen kann), aber warum sollte jemand, wenn er mit seiner Freundin auf den Asselverseuchten Friedhof geht, zu ihrem Schutz eine Waffe mitnehmen, die er nicht beherrscht?!?

Ein für Daedalic unverzeihlicher Fehler schließlich ist das müde und unmotivierte Ende, das keinesfalls für das Spiel belohnt, sondern mir ein ""ist das WIRKLICH euer Ernst?!"" entlockte. Schade.

Macht das Spiel überhaupt was richtig?
Ja.Die Atmosphäre. Die, für Daedalic typische, Liebe zum Detail in der Grafik. Und das - zwar nicht immer aber oft - aufkommende gute Gefühl, einen fairen, aber schweren Kampf geschafft zu haben. Die Motivation, die Story weiter zu erleben. Das grundsolide Voiceacting. Die Darstellung des nun wirklich nicht schönen Aventurischen Südens mit seinen Giftmischern und Sklavenhändler, der Brutalität und der Gnadenlosigkeit gegenüber dem Schwachen. All das bringt das Spiel hervorragend zur Geltung.

Reicht das für ein Daumen hoch?
Eigentlich nein. Aber für ein faires 6/10, was bei mir heißt: ""grundsolide mit Schwächen"". 
Und für einen waagerechten Daumen. Aber den gibts bei Steam ja nicht",1494273435,1494273478,True,14,0,0.667227447032928467,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I was finally successful with the battles but they really killed enjoyment and turned the game into a grind. A little more balance would have been helpful.  

I also recommend having a strategy for building your characters before you start.  You can adapt during the game but it just makes it harder.  

All in all I did really enjoy the game.  After the issues in chapter 2 I think the rest was fun.  The story was interesting although not amazing.  

I give it a 7/10 and would recommend it despite the issues.

This game is cancer, the worst of the worst, about the only people that might like it are morons who thought Darkest Dungeon was good (I didn't, thats just how far out of field this game is).

If you are insane, retarded and have no life, there are 100 other games better than this one, if you run out of those, then try this. As a last resort, befor suicide. Although I'm beginning to debate that last one.

An example of this games mechanics : 74% - miss, 74% - miss, 74% - miss, 74% - miss, 87% - miss, 40% - critical hit.

Another example is one of the arena fights: 2 of your team go up NAKED with WOODEN weapons against an enemy pair, one in full metal armour with a permanently poisoned weapon and 2 health potions, both with more hit points and skills.

This game is not just hard (on hard) - it is UNFAIRLY HARD, hence my Darkest Dungeon comparison.

This is a RPG(RNG) Turn based strategy game.

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

Before you are able to play your game, they will ask you if you do wish to be a Mage, Hunter or a warrior. Each class has their own advantage and disadvantage. This game is borderline... Well let's say uncreative. You click on a map location and that level will start. You are either fighting against an enemy or you are in a town. Once in a town you are able to buy/sell items at a shop, Rest to recover the stats, Talk to some people or even doing quest activities. Whenever you are fighting against an enemy the combat rules are pretty simple (It's like Heroes of might and magic). The battlefield is on a Grid and each unit take turns for their action. The character speed is known as ""initiative"" and the higher number, the faster a character is able to perform again in a battle. Sadly enough the game suffers from ""Random number generator"" in fights (Such as X-Com) which means, Even if you have a 95% attack chance against an enemy. Well jokes on you, The 95% is not really 95% as you are still missing pretty often. Your character is able to level up and they are able to learn new spells, talents and other things. They can be equipped with items to make them stronger in battles.

Subtitles are voiced over. You are able to skip and fastforward it.
Great Graphics.
Turn based Combat.
Decent story.
Random number generated % based in battles.
Character has some customiziation.
There is a rules control overview.
Alot of ingame tips/explainations.
It has dialogues and cutscenes.


[h1]Other things.[/h1]

The random number generator in turn based games is simply NOT WORKING and will always ruin the game. Xcom is a good example (MY OPINION) as the enemy always have a higher hit chance than you will ever get.
So in short words. ""Combat mechanic is unfair towards the player as it is happening too often""

After reading through comments and reviews I saw one of the biggest issues was unfair RNG in fights, I figured it must be a bit like Xcom and similar games with % hit chances where you'll miss the odd 99% chance to hit. Which I could understand, but not when it happens on the 2nd fight out of the tutorial, 4 times in a row mixed with 2 missed spell casts. Again I can handle bad RNG but not when the enemies have a 40% chance to hit and never miss. Even if that was not an issue, running into a bug that stops me from completeing the 2nd fight in the graveyard by not letting me interact with the thing the game is screaming at me to interact with to stop mobs spawning. 

I came into this game optimistic and figuring people were just too used to easy games that held your hand and gave it negative reviews because they didn't have to think. This game has proven that thinking wrong, its just a bad designed game with subpar voice acting, from what little I saw an unoriginal story (Accused of murder and coviently having no memory of it or anything.) No real customisation and just in general poor gameplay.

Did all sidequests I ran across before completion, not sure how close to 100% I was, but I'd guess I probably did a good 85-90% of the content on offer. It's just about learning the game to be honest, there's nothing super difficult here. I play a good variety of games and hardly am ""an expert"" at turn based tactics games for comparison to what you can expect. Fun game, a couple of times I found the combat very slow and wished I could skip through enemy turns when there were lots of enemies (last dungeon had a couple like this...)

Pretty funny seeing all the people here whine about this game being unforgiving or super difficult... I am completely new to Dark Eye game systems and have just taken my time in looking at the character trees etc and sort of feeling my way into where I'm spending my AP. I would say that if difficult = not 1shotting every single battle, then the game is ""difficult"". But beyond that, it's not very difficult. Every single encounter has taken me no more than 2 tries barring the end encounter for Chapter 2 (louse queen as a 3rd battle in a row with no recovery time. I decided to power thru it vs trying to load an old save and set myself up for easier success over all 3 as a whole with the knowledge I'd gained... too lazy to do that). And I can even say that the first attempt is often experimentation or trial/error with the different maps, traps and interactables etc and perhaps new enemy types. 

It's fairly easy so far, although I will say that the difficulty is spiky; it runs the gamut from faceroll to mildy challenging (and some of the reviews I see whining about difficulty are from people that spent far less time than I, so I doubt it's where I am in the game) -- honestly if you are having trouble, maybe reevaluate your movement and positioning. I've found that there is a lot of advantage to be gained and strategy in positioning and more or less ""gaming the map"" to keep control and manage some of the risk/rng. This is a hex based game, and sometimes moving 2 hexes right or left can change a whole lot. 

To give an example -- I saw a ""WTF is"" by TotalBiscuit, where he played a fairly early map and thought it was frustrating and difficult... immediately started making major positioning oversights in the very first turn he had. The corridor is bottlenecked to 3 hexes wide and there are like 6 active crypt lice. Why would you not move 3 characters onto each of those hexes and wait for the lice to come to you? Then you are only fighting 3 at once you only have 3 characters of your choosing taking damage (far more control over damage intake). Following this, you have infinite recovery turns on the map to heal before moving forward and ""activating"" the next group. This is just a very basic example... and I don't really even dabble in strategy games all that much. I just don't see how this game is hard. It's fairly simple with a bit of trial and error involved. The RNG complaints are also pretty bullshit... there is even a ""wounds"" system to manage the RNG... which I discovered at my leisure after continually investigating the ruleset as I played. Have some patience... you definitely don't need to read character guides to suceed. I've learned after playing and reading around that the optimal route is playing a mage as the hero (there's 0 disadvantage since there are basically characters that can cast and characters that can't -- everything else can be developed as you see fit as the game goes on...), and I'm doing just fine.",1491722106,1492563550,True,11,0,0.644955694675445557,0,False,False,False,False,,,

游戏进行到第三章，救了女巫以后，要去竞技场找竞技场老板要女巫面具钥匙，进了老板房间以后，Bug出现

游戏黑屏，有声音，但是屏幕上只有鼠标，将游戏切出去再切回来重新看到了游戏画面，但是一点鼠标就又黑了

重启游戏，失败，游戏在主菜单就开始黑屏，点鼠标就黑，切出去切回来只能点一下，点一下就黑

重启电脑，再进游戏，没问题了，读档，黑屏Bug再次出现

所以结果就是这游戏我已经[b]玩不了[/b]了

一开始玩的时候出过一个分辨率的问题，一进游戏就黑屏，但是那个是因为操作系统的原因，改过兼容性设置以后就没问题了

---------------

吐槽下游戏的操作和界面设计：

-游戏模型经常相互遮挡导致鼠标不能点到正确的目标

-当你的队友站到一起的时候，稍不留神就会看错当前行动的人物，或者看错当前行动的人物的位置，即使有行动顺序提示器也一样，因为高亮的行动区域有时会导致你根本看不清你的人物，两个外形相近的角色没那么好分辨，解决的办法不是没有，就是每次都从提示器定位一下，但是这样玩无疑很麻烦，很破坏体验

-行动区域的高亮提示会挡住场景，有时候看不清脚下路径里哪里有沼泽哪里有水

-这一条可能是我自己蠢，玩了14个小时，依旧不会把技能加到快捷栏上，那一条帮助我看过好几遍，但是它只告诉我可以把技能加到快捷栏上，加上去可以操作更方便，可就是没说该怎么加

The game is worth one play-through, though on replay it is already disgustingly similar. Personally I think that a warrior, a ranger, a rogue, and a mage would live different lives, make different choices, define different loot. Here it does not even matter, as long, as you win fight after fight.

Tactical, combat-enforced hex-map fantasy chess with RPG stats of the once most beloved German pen & paper roleplaying game. The game starts nicely, even though the linearity of the story, and the lack of impact one makes unto the world around the chosen or hand-built protagonist seems to remind of decade old mistakes in RPG's.

The game is A LOT about tactical combat on a hex map, not much skills versus environment, not much story or choices which matter, but if you unlock the console and type WIN after pressing F12, then patch version 1.8 of the game is decent.

Given that several patches still failed to relieve us of all glitches and bugs, that isn't too impressive.

One mistake I found sucking:

Merchants offer a standard script of equipment. Entire armor sets and weapons can only be gained by using the 'give all items' cheat. Sadly that one crashes the game later, as it spawns a bug sabotaging the quest resolving.

Additionally you need your DirectX and VCredists (from 2008 to 2013) in peak-performance-state, or glitches and bugs are guaranteed!

Crystals and chests cannot be damaged by daggers or fencing weapons! Use two-weapon fighting plus a torch or slash or bash type of weapon, IF you need daggers or foils, rapiers to imagine your character (Horasian area of Aventuria)...

[b]The good aspects:[/b]

The character creation is decent.

The world is harsh and unforgiving, while still being the once famous Aventuria (Aventurien in German) of THE DARK EYE RPG system.

The allies of the protagonist and their voiceovers ain't bad.

Background music is decent, too. 

Skills like streetwise and survival make a difference, even though some can only be taken at character creation in expert mode. No trainers found later in the game.

The game does build atmosphere, but only for one more tactical combat on those ancient, antiquated, oldschool hexagone maps...

The oft-shunned Nameless God is much better implemented than in 'Demonicon'.

- лучники - настоящие машины смерти (это типа подсказка)
- можно сделать лучника-мага, который будет лечить, кастовать файерболлы и стрелять из лука как терминатор
- минимум 100, а может и больше (при заявленных 180) сражений практически не похожи друг на друга

Многое, что пишут про эту игру - правда. Каких-то особенных красот тут нет. Она мрачная. Но специфический юмор команды не даёт скатиться всему в беспросветный мрак. Она сложная. Можно умудриться завалить получасовую битву на последних минутах, когда все расклады на твоей стороне. Но это всё же не хардкор, просто здесь надо не расслабляться, а о многом помнить и стараться думать на пару шагов вперёд или возвращаться к особо сложному заданию, немного подкачавшись на сайд-квестах.

И всё же она неоднозначная. По-моему, это первая игра такого плана у Daedalic, поэтому они и наделали кучу ошибок: неровный сюжет, однообразные задания в самом конце (последние 10 часов ну вообще ни о чём на фоне всего остального), есть неиспользуемые перки или такие, использование которых практически лишено смысла. Встречаются (хотя и мало) задания, победа в которых - это просто случайность.

Но самое главное - видно, что разработчики старались: разнообразить игровые ситуации, сделать непохожими друг на друга битвы, удивить игрока.

A very difficult, very unforgiving one. The backbone of the game is made up by the Dark Eye system, a system similar to DnD and (from what I understand) very popular in Germany. I've played  alot of DnD, and read a lot about the game's system and guides before playing Blackguards, but didn't really feel like it made much of a difference. The RNG is very unforgiving, in that if your characters' builds are not razor optimized, you will have an incredibly difficult time with the game, more than it already is. I STRONGLY suggest looking at character guides and just following one to the T in terms of what are good skills, what are must haves, where to put your points, and the like, as it is very easy to render a character effectively useless in a battle as you continue to invest points in skills.

Damage and  status efects stay with characters after fights, and consumables are in relatively short supply, meaning strings of fights become very dicey. Magic casting runs off of the same RNG as the melee attacks do, so it's possible to cast spells, have them fizzle entirely, but still lose mana - very frustrating since you then need to use one of your limited resources in money or mana potions to get them back to the point to where they can even begin to be useful again - or so you hope.

These difficulties in learning the games system will unfortunately turn people away from what is a very enjoyable and very think-y turn based combat game. Almost every single individual map is handcrafted and presents new challenges to the party, and the game often forces you to use various party members in different compositions: Aggravating if you chose to focus on one in particular, but from a game design standpoint, if executed well lets you offer all sorts of new challenges. The problem lies in the game's very punishing permanent levellnig system. With no way to undo bad choices and mistakes (and don't be fooled: there ARE mistakes and just bad choices you can make in character builds), you might be stuck at a fight you now have no way of winning, fifteen hours into the campaign.

The story is not particularly interesting, in my opinion, but I have played  alot of very intensely narrative focused games so I admit my bar may be set a little bit high. The characters are interesting, and it's fun to see a story told from the perspective of sly ne'er-do-wells rather than heroic caricatures. Unfortunately, I never really felt like anything groundbreaking or innovative was really done with the characters or situations they could have used, and instead it just sort of became background set up fora relatively generic story that could have been done with the more ""Usual Suspects"" of heroic characters.

Ironically, I garnered the most fun from the game when my frustration was at its peak and I simply used Cheat Engine to level my characters to the max immediately, giving myself essentially unlimited skill points and ability points to make the characters I actually wanted to make. Due to the punishing RNG and the thoughtful, puzzle-y situations the game likes to put you in, in every single combat, this takes less of the challenge out of the game than you might immediately think (it DOES make it much easier, of course.). Your mileage may vary, but for someone that wants to experience the combat system and the story, i would actually recommend just cheat engining your characters to max level and giving them all the skills you want them to have, and then enjoy using them in the varied combat situations the games put you in.

In the end, I give the game a thumbs down - but only because I think the game's opaqueness and difficulty in learning the system is such a a negative that many people will feel immediately turned off by a combinatioin of that and the game's innate difficulty that they'll be unable to enjoy the game for its positive sides.",1489176683,1489176683,False,10,1,0.581479728221893311,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Toll designte Begleiter, die auch immer wieder Beiträge liefern
- Durchdachtes Kampfsystem

Contra:
- Begleiteranzahl insgesamt gering (man hat auch keine Wahlmöglichkeiten, wer einen begleitet, wie in vielen anderen Rollenspielen)
- gerade in den ersten zwei Kapiteln sind die Kämpfe stark vom Zufallsfaktor dominiert. Die Charaktere patzen häufig beim Zaubern. Dies ändert sich im späteren Verlauf, trotz allem habe ich noch kein Spiel gespielt, wo das Zaubern so schwer ist

Да, я понимаю, что это первый опыт для Daedalic Entertainment в создании РПГ и вроде можно было бы простить их за косяки.... НО! Их слишком много! К слову, у этой студии ряд прекрасных качественных квестов.

Начнем сразу с минусов. 

1. Сюжет. 
Он посредственный. Вроде интригующее начало: вы оказываетесь в тюрьме, якобы по ложному обвинению. Откуда позже вам удается сбежать в компании гнома Наурима и мага Зурбарана (самый харизматичный персонаж в игре, так сказать, тащит). И вот вы на свободе в поисках ответа на вопрос: "" ̶К̶т̶о̶ ̶п̶о̶д̶с̶т̶а̶в̶и̶л̶ ̶к̶р̶о̶л̶и̶к̶а̶ ̶Р̶о̶д̶ж̶е̶р̶а̶?̶"" В общем, завязка окружена мистикой, тайнами и интригами. К середине игры вы ждете эмоций типа ""Вот это поворот!"", а их все нет и нет. Какое-то однообразие и тягомотина. А ближе к концу вы просто мечтаете поскорее увидеть финальный ролик. Кстати, игра достаточно продолжительная, если проходить все побочные квесты. 
Также мы привыкли, что в РПГ мы можем влиять на сюжет при выборе реплик, сторон конфликта. Здесь тоже есть выбор, но большому счету он ни на что не влияет. 

2. Персонажи. 
Они не были раскрыты в течении игры. У вас будет суровый гном, который всю игру ворчит и лезет в драку при первой возможности. Плюс пара-тройка второстепенных персонажей без своего мнения. Ну очень линейно все получилось в этом плане. Приятное впечатление оставляет только похотливый маг с юга Зурбаран. Он был хорош: юмор, тактичность и глубокие мысли. 

3. Ужасный движок.
Отвратительная графика, куча ""мыла"", большинство битв у вас пройдут при 10-15 фпс.
Кошмарная анимация. Также был замечен баг: когда выходил из окна диалога с персонажем, выкидывало из города на глобальную карту. 

4. Сражения.
Долго думал и в итоге решил отнести к минусам. А проблема, как и в сюжете. По началу вас увлекает разнообразие полей сражения, возможность взаимодействия с окружающими предметами, различные тактики. Но через несколько часов вас уже тошнит от боев. Половина из них ужасно скучная.

5. Рандом.
Возможно, этот минус необъективен, так это мой личный опыт и проблема только во мне.
Но я обязан рассказать, как при вероятности попадания (каст спела) 90-98% - 3-4 раза подряд промах. В свою очередь, противник с вероятностью попадания 45% не промахивается + наносит критический урон с вероятностью 35%.
Это преследовало меня всю игру. Я играл с подробным логом и я горел, господа. Добило меня следующая запись: вероятность попадания 100% - промах. За игру такое было трижды. Раунд!

Перейдем к плюсам. О них я скажу кратко, так как они незначительны и не спасают общую картину.

1. Саундтрек. 
Хороший. Выставил на 30% и слушал всю игру. Приятный и ненавязчивый.

2. Невероятно сложная и интересная система прокачки персонажей. Вместо уровня вы получаете очки приключений (ОП), которые в дальнейшем можете распределить. И вот тут самое интересное. Характеристики персонажей, навыки обращения с различным оружием, таланты, заклинания, специальные умения. Просто глаза разбегаются! Система прокачки довольна гибкая. Вы можете слепить:
- мага-лучника;
- танка, который также неплохо владеет арбалетом; 
- ловкого бойца с копьем, который в разгар битвы может переключиться на 2 одноручных меча и устроить танец ножей;
- etc.
Но не стоит сильно увлекаться. Blackguards не прощает. Дойдете до какого-нибудь квеста без необходимых умений и осознаете, что это ТУПИК! Я серьезно. Запускаем игру сначала.

3. Прочее.
Порадовали интерактивные города и глобальная карта. Не нужно бродить долго в поисках кого-либо. Удобно, не более. 

Итог: для коллекции сойдет. 

P. S. Покажите мне людей, которые смогли пройти игру до конца.

装备系统比较简单，虽然有各种分类，像弓箭法棍猛击类击剑类等等等等，但是你只需要看商店里能买到啥穿啥，然后捡着好的穿，人物属性系统就比较混乱了，有基本属性、天赋、法术、武器天赋还有一个被动，而且一部分东西只能跟导师学习，至于导师则是偶尔出现的，而且一个导师只教一种职业的技能，而且所有的人物属性共享一个IP点。这是人物属性，然后就是战斗系统，近战有命中率，远程有命中率，法术释放有成功率，治疗也有失败的可能，地形有高有低，低的你不能通过但是可以射箭扔火球，高的你既不能通过也不能扔火球，有的地形可以互动，有的地形会被你的火球点着，地图上还有陷阱，敌人砍你一刀10滴血，你砍敌人一刀也十滴血，你们都是40滴血，最关键的是敌人数量比你多一倍。。。

I don't know what the developers were aiming for with the way the final product turned out (it is NOT due to technical ineptitude or lack of creative ability - the game mechanics are consistent with its defined rule set, full of intelligent puzzles and reasonably bug free).

The lack of transparency (markedly unsound - it badly hurts their sales numbers by quickly alienating the ""shallower"" player base. ) seems to be caused largely due to intended design. Maybe TDE (dark eye) game rules are were so second nature to the developers they coudn't see how difficult it will be for ""foreigners"" to make sense of their otherwise ""working within parameters"" product. 

It almost like the game is made by aliens strangers to earth based game interface progression in the last 20 years. Maybe this what a game made by programmers/designers that don't play computer games should be expected to turn out (speculation). 

cons
-very limited ruleset/mecanics exposition and ingame feedback (steam guides mostly fixes this)
-alien game interface: bits of relevant information are scattered all over the place (need to navigate 5-6 ""screens"" to gather basic info about a character - a feat the good modern games can achieve in 1-2 ""screens"" with overwelmingly superior amount of detail - wastes player time, hurts immersion)
-stoneage like combat log functionality (mising a lot game critical events and the ones presented lack detail)  
-rough spell/ weapon class balance
-nearly impossible to read opponent's percentage based resists ( some even have vulnerabilities to certain damage types but it is extremely hard to tell due to the hidden resist stats , RNG damage component and poor combat log features)
-liniar story, set drops(limited itemisation issues) and poor spell/abilities balance (few powerbuilds builds) leads to poor replayability value. (maybe the obfuscation was intended to mask/hide the poor balance to the players - or the poor balance is the result of the obfuscation making it hard for the devs to see the problems ?)

pros
-the community with a bit of help from developers managed to unwind most of the critical game mechanics (check out the game's player guides section)
-the game is well oiled (very few bugs), the creative people did great - very high intelligent puzzle combat variation(enjoyable once you start grasping the game mechanics).

O jogo tem basicamente dois tipos de cenários as cidades e os campos de batalha. Ou você está lutando ou está na cidade.

Como todo RPG os personagens possuem uma árvore de habilidades que vão sendo preenchidas com o desenvolvimento dos personagens, no BlackGuards o sistema não é baseado em level e sim em pontos de habilidade que você ganha após cada batalha. Até ai tudo bem e normal, só que o sistema é justo somente no primeiro capítulo do jogo já no capítulo 2 em diante fica impossível/injusto o progresso no jogo para os demais capítulos. Ou seja, mesmo se você for um jogador experiente em RPGs de um modo geral não passará do capítulo 2. Provavelmente, vai recorrer a algum trainner na internet para poder progredir no jogo. Mesmo assim, os NPCs treinadores na cidade não irão treinar você em todas habilidades do jogo, você vai ficar limitado a uns 5 a 6 habilidades no máximo(mesmo você cumprindo os requisitos para aprende-las) , ou seja, somente no final do jogo terá um NPC que treinará seus personagens com  todas as skills disponíveis no jogo. Algumas skills você somente aprende comprando livros nos NPCs comerciantes e fazendo quests, mas são muito poucas.


Prós:

-Cumpre a função de ser um RPG com batalhas em turnos
-Ambientação e interatividade com os cenários durante as batalhas.
-Customização do personagem com armas e habilidades.
-Até divertido e bom para passar o tempo
-Legendado em PT-BR

Pros:

 - Interesting storyline;
 - Decent(ish) combat engine;
 - Some downright funny moments.

Cons:

 - Opaque combat mechanics (i.e., lack of walkthrough, ingame pedia or other assistance to help understand these numbers getting crunched);
 - Zurbaran is USELESS *sadface*;
 - The. Baroness. OMG, the Baroness....where to start. The bonus objective is only achieveable if you've looked up where the traps are placed - and that's just to start!
 - Siege of Morbal. Nothing ticks one off quite like pushing ahead, winning a tough battle....then, as you're winning, having a rock fall on two characters' heads at once, taking them entirely out of the fight arbitrarily!
 - No ""RP"" in ""RPG"" - it's a combat grinder, little more. There are hints of an interesting story, but no background, no dialogue, no choices....

IMHO this game deserves a 8.5/10 and definitely worth hours of gameplay and to some extent re-playability. I found myself planing for hours what spells to get and how to develop some characters. 

Pros:
- Detailed characters that come to life
- Good roles mixture (I played as a mage but my real emphasis was a fighter with usage of the shadow spell)
- Detailed scenarios
- Fantastic spells and animations.
- Hard difficulty requires strategic previous character planning to be able to beat some encounters.

Cons:
- No 360 camera support
- Sometimes win or lose a battle feels more luck than strategy (Fail all the hits and all the magic, bad luck meaning lose).
- Mechanics such as Buy/Sell kind of feels incomplete and Weight system feels off
- End of the story is incomplete and leaves you wondering (Blackguards 2 continues this?)

The game is neither all good or all bad, it's somewhat of any of those extremes.

I really liked the story part, especially the main villain figure, and all that dark cult agenda, it was really fitting. With that said, I'm quite not happy with the pace and rhythm the game plot proceed, the characters making their moves and all such things. It's all... static and boring. Yeah, again, the story is good, the way it was written and told is really subpar.
I liked the subquests, some of them are really creative and interesting... But buggy and not really rewarding.

I... liked the battles, at least, good bunch of them. The maps are challenging, the variety of abilities and ways to get going is really good. With that... Have you noticed the time counter Steam thinks I was playing? Something around 100 hours? Well, in truth it's maybe around 20. I've played the Blackguards on holidays, I never really needed to shut the game. So I was just playing over the moment I get bored and frustrated, and then just leaving the game without closing it. Mostly, it was around some combats, where you abide, and abide... And tarry the tide, if you know that verse.

You see, some of the combats are really long, with big maps, lots of enemies, unobvious goals or some freaky bugs not letting you to finish the fight. Like, for example, a crystal you have to break to proceed. You're standing next to it, with a hammer and 100% hit chance. And then you miss. 5 times in the row. The hit percentage is maybe the one of the worst abominations that Blackguards shows to the world of turn-based RP games. They are so unfair, as loaded dices.

I got it on sale and would recommend it as such, but this game is not worth 40$. 

Nothing in this game is bad except for the UI, but nothing is good either. Nothing impressed me at all. The spell system having 3 stats associated to every spell just doesn't make sense. I need strength for magic? Wait what? Okay it would make sense if its a force push or something maybe that fits right? Well one of them creates and arcane wall, the other is a debuff. How is that associated to strength at all? 

Most irritating part is some fights are just not properly balanced. There is one fight I spent over an hour on, had the moves mapped to a science, and just needed the RNG to connect. If you let the guy hit you on the second turn and poison you, you simply cannot win. So one companion has to move the perfect amount of tiles away from the enemy so it will chase him, while the other moves away and shoots at the non poisoning opponent. Kiting of this level doesn't have a place in a game like this. When I have to take my tank and run him in circles to not die, I feel like the developers missed something...  And to put it in perspective, I have the best armor and stats possible at the current place for a tank, and he cannot tank nor do I even consider him ""tanky"". Your shield will add a lot to your parry, but you can only parry once per turn turn so what is the point? My mage honestly has just as good of a chance to survive as he does wearing cloth without a shield.

While first 2 chapters are fun, from 3 it goes down hill. Especially chapter 5, which is incredibly cheap and frustrating. The game explains itself poorly and people comparing it to xcom should play xcom first.
In this game hit chance % is actually not a real one, because the one that is displaying doesn't add dodge/parry/block to the equation, so the real hit chance is much lower in the end.

Graphics for a game from 2014 are meh, but fps droping to 35 on gtx980 show what an unoptimised mess it can be. If you want to actually check where it drops like that, go to arena and when there is a level with torches and what appeares to be rivers of oil, touch the torch, so half the map is on fire. If you will make them all fall, the fps will go down significantly. Music is unmemorable, characters are just there (with no real development) with really awful VO work. If you thought Bethesda was worst, check this game out on youtube. Completely stoned elf chick is horrendous.
Overall the game is incredibly buggy, from missing sound to other hilarious things.

The only pros for this game that I can think of are:
- cards, which you can sell
- if you really care about playtime, it can be from 20 to 50 hours.
- it is buggy. Why count it as a pros? Because there is a bug in the final fight when the game will beat itself, even if you lose, so you don't have to suffer this cheap and unfair fight anymore (with a trophy for completing and supposedly best ending!). At least I got it and I'm really happy.

I've been a fan of CRPGs since the days of Might and Magic.  Maybe it's the nostalgia of the Dark Eye ruleset that reminds me of games like Star Trail, which even with its flaws I love. I cannot understand some of the complaints I've heard here. I find the battle difficulty perfect. I know this may turn some people off, but I love it. I typically play all of my RPGs on the hardest settings. I play this on normal. There is an easy mode if you need. It's understandable. That said everytime I'm frustrated I put it down, come back to it later, and succeed.  I will say that I restarted once because given the difficulty I was unhappy with how I had planned out my characters. Let me also say that I am happy there was not a ""respec"" option.

Pros:
Feels like a classic CRPG
Superb characters and voice acting
Great truly tactical combat system
Suprisingly mature storyline and writing
Lengthy - some might see this as a flaw, I love it

Cons:
Limited character creation/customization options
Uninteresting and simple models/textures for armor/characters
A few bugs, some graphical, at least one gameplay

Note: For those complaining about the RNG, please remember that the mother of all RPGs D&D is a dice game. Get over it.

I might wait for it to be on sale. For the time invested, the ending felt rushed and not all that satisfactory, but overall game still gets the thumbs up. 

I remember when this initially came out awhile back that people were going on about the darkness of the anti-heroes, the crudeness of the dialogue, almost juvenile humor, etc. Maybe years of playing the Witcher games have heightened (or is that lowered) my tolerance bar, but nothing in Blackguards even raised my eyebrow. In fact, rather than being the EDGY ANTI-HEROES that seem be everywhere these days, it was kind of relaxing to find out that my party were just a bunch of losers, with a lazy, whiny main character, a dwarf who is possibly nuts and most certainly an arsonist, a philandering wizard, and that's just to start with. Rather than choices that are downright eeeeeevil, you mainly get the choice between being a cold-hearted pragmatist or a bit more charitable, which works great. Voice acting was quite good for the price and the type of games, and the graphics, well, they are what they are, I don't mind (honorable mention goes to the fire effects which may be the prettiest I've seen in ANY game at ANY price tag.)

I didn't find the combat to be as intense, strategic or engaging as Original Sin, but it was satisfying enough. The lauded interactive elements were for the most part useless when the surest, easiest strategy (on Normal, anyway) was to fall back, put my tanks in front of my glass cannons, hop the former up with all the buffs I could lay on, and let rip. But the game would fairly frequently throw a curve ball to shake things up; some fights have limited turns before you lose an optimal victory condition, others force you to move forward with ever-spawning enemies or poison gas. There was enough variety that it never got too repetitive or boring, though obviously some of the fights are going to feel annoying or unfair, or leave you way too open for the revenge of the RNG demon.

No obstante, creo que es un juego muy recomendable para los amantes de los SRPG.

Nada más empezar, el juego nos da a elegir entre escoger un personaje entre tres ya definidos (mago, arquero o guerrero) o crearnos uno propio. Es mucho más satisfactorio crearlo tu mismo. Para mi, la mejor opción y la más divertida es crear un arquero/mago que use el arco para atacar y que pueda bostear y curar. De hecho en modo más difícil, el arquero/mago simplifica mucho el juego y lo hace mucho más llevadero. El ataque de arco ""disparo triple"" puede llegar a hacer unas cantidades de daño desproporcionadas y allana mucho el camino a la victoria.

La historia es entretenida y sirve para enlazar las batallas y sobre todo, de hilo conductor sobre el que mover a unos personajes que son uno de los puntos fuertes del juego. Todos ellos tienen fuertes personalidades y motivaciones y ambiciones que chocan con las de los otros compañeros de aventura, de forma que según sean nuestras decisiones, se puede crear una atmósfera tensa que sólo espera una pequeña chispa para estallar. Constantemente habrá que tomar decisiones, las cuales afectarán de forma significativa en el juego. Por ejemplo, el enano intentará arreglarlo todo a la fuerza, pero si dejamos que el mago lleve la voz cantante, buscará conseguir el mismo fin mediante sobornos. El sistema de batalla es el típico de cualquier SRPG, pero con una peculiaridad: la interacción con el entorno. En todas las batallas hay elementos del mapa que nos pueden servir de ayuda en la consecución de la victoria. Por ejemplo, las pozas en los pantanos pueden detener a los enemigos un número determinado de turnos, o los barriles pueden bloquear el paso por determinadas zonas.

Gráficamente cumple sin hacer ningún alarde. Aunque lo que si se echa en falta, son cinemáticas. Hay pocas y muy breves y podrían haber creado alguna más que sirviera para apoyar la narración.

Ahora bien, hay que reconocer que el juego tiene bastantes fallos, algunos importantes son:
-Por algún milagro de la estadística, es posible fallar ataques con un 100% de posibilidad de acierto.
-Unas pocas conversaciones están en un perfecto ""spanglish"".
-Algunas frases no aparecen traducidas.
-En ocasiones es casi imposible seleccionar al personaje sobre el que va a recaer una acción y hay que hacer malabares con el ratón para poder conseguirlo.
-Bugs con algunos logros.

También se puede hablar de otras cosas que se podrían mejorar:
-Algunos logros no tienen ningún sentido. Por ejemplo, un logro te pide hacer un personaje que tenga 10 puntos de talento en todos los tipos de armas y lo normal es que uses un único tipo de arma o a lo sumo dos, por lo que el logro te pide que tires los puntos en crear un personaje inútil.
-Las clases no están bien balanceadas, siendo los arqueros mucho más poderosos que el resto.
-El poder de los hechizos ofensivos y su porcentaje de acierto es muy bajo (lo han arreglado en Blackguard 2 y se agradece).

I don't get the bad rep this game is getting...  The characters (so far) are well voiced, the story, although fairly generic, is decent enough and the combat system is decent.

I will admit, I bought the game as a part of this weekends sale, so got both Blackguards 1 & 2 along with a bunch of other games for about £12.  I've been tempted by both of these for some time now, but was put off by the reviews and the price.  So far, I have found these to be unfounded.

I dove straight in on character creation rather than have the system do half the work for you and I am learning it as I go.  There's a lot to choose from so I just went with basics at least to start with.  It looks diverse enough to branch out later, which is always nice.

Sure, there is a large element of RNG, but look at XCOM...  That game has continually devastated its players by repeated 95%+ shots missing at the, single, most crucial shot of the game.  I can't count how many times in that I have missed that said shot and the mission suddenly went to hell.  This is no different, though I have yet to encounter anything so drastic, but it's still early days.

I can certainly see the game getting repetitive after a time, but there seems to be a lot more variation than XCOM in terms of attacks you can do, especially when you take in to account the spells.

I would say that this game is definitely recommended to fans of TBS games and also to those of strategic fantasy games.  I would also definitely say that this game 'should' be recommended.

To set 'not recommended' as others have because it's niche is just a tad overkill tbh.  If they aren't interested in a game just because it's a TBS or fantasy, then why are they looking at it in the first place?  It's a moot point.",1481646249,1481646249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Is it worth buying?[/b]

Eh, just about. It's regularly on sale for £2 or £3, and I got 70hrs out of it, so on that basis you'd be a whiny little bitch to complain. 

[b]Is it any good?[/b]

Eh, just about. It's a classic TBS affair. The storyline's OK, but gets kinda convoluted throughout the game so by the end, you've pretty much lost the plot and stopped caring. Something to do with a Whisper...? Anyway. 

One big plus is the characters and writing. They're generally a likeable bunch and have good banter between them, and often their conversations raise a chuckle.

Progress is extremely limited - you won't be working your way up through half a dozen better and better sets of gear as you progress: in fact, once you've got a complete set by around chapter 2, you can pretty much forget about upgrading any more. So if you're a loot junky and love waiting for the loot windows at the end of every fight to see what shiny new gear your heroes are getting, you'll be disappointed.

Having said that, if you simply enjoy the basics of TBS combat and love moving your guys around a hexboard and using your new skills/spells to smash zombies in the face, you'll enjoy yourself.

最后说一说让人纠结的两个问题，那就是概率频率和人物AI方面了。说实话，我已经怀疑我学的概率学是不是伪科学了，技能和法术成功概率和频率完全不对等啊，就算是频率围绕着概率上下波动也没有那么大的波动吧！我的法师75%成功的法术居然试了四次全部失败！还有弓箭的命中率也是谜啊，收益率太低让人恨不得拿着大刀向敌人头上砍去啊！还有技能神马的成功率太差了，收益率居然比普攻还低！我的矮人中期拿着斧子一路平A啊，让我觉得我加的AP完全没必要啊！（要什么技能啊，全加斧子一路平推就行啦(╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻）。还有人物AI的问题，对面指挥官辣么厉害啊，[spoiler]帮法师救妹纸的那个关卡有好几次把我的主角（我选的是猎人）按在墙角摩擦啊！[/spoiler]还有怎么我们队友的AI就辣么感人啊！[spoiler]救商人的那个支线任务我打了6次，每次都是那个商人主动走到深色的沼泽里面的！到最后我只能让我的人主动走到沼泽里面去（我是不是很机智）。[/spoiler]

Gra mnie wciągnęła. Choć w głównej mierze przechodzimy z walki do walki, to zróżnicowani wrogowie jak i niekiedy teren sprawiają, że aż tak nie odczuwa się monotoni. Niekiedy potyczki potrafią być wymagające, co jak dla mnie jest plusem. Więcej niż 5 razy nie powtarzałem walki, gdyż uczyłem się na wcześniejszych błędach. Nawet finałowe próby i ostatnia seria potyczek nie sprawiły mi trudności i przeszedłem za pierwszym podejściem, choć krasnoludzkie gry i walka z królową wesz mogą napsuć krwi. Poza dziesiątkami walk mamy bardzo dobry rozwój postaci, różnorodną paletę czarów, gdzie naprawdę każde zaklęcie może się przydać i nie ma zapchajdziur. Wyposażenia też jest trochę, choć te różnice w statystykach są niewielkie. 

Ponadto jest nawet niezła fabuła, wyraziści bohaterowie i dobrze napisane dialogi. Niestety historia w dużej mierze jest liniowa, choć w 3 i 4 rozdziale mamy wolną rękę w wykonywaniu pobocznych zadań. Niestety czasami pojawiają się błędy, gdzie wykonując jedno zadanie mamy dostęp do kolejnego, ale nie wykonamy go, gdyż wcześniej potrzeba zrobić inne zadanie. Takich baboli jest trochę (np. ten Lasca - załatwiłem go w pierwszej turze i już leżąc jeszcze coś tam krzyczy, bo twórcy nie przewidzieli, że ktoś mógłby go pokonać na samym początku). Zdarzają się też błędy w dźwięku, gdzie męskie głosy sa podstawione pod kobietę i na odwrót. W polskim tłumaczeniu jest też kilka literówek i pomyłki w oznaczeniu płci. Irytują również częste wczytywania map. Niby krótkie, ale ich intensywność jednak przerażała z początku. Potem jakoś się przyzwyczaiłem. Grafika jest przeciętna, choć w wypadku erpegów ma dla mnie znaczenie drugorzędne o ile nie jest to jakaś bijąca po oczach pikseloza. Muzyka jest na bardzo przywoitym poziomie. 

Bardzo istotny jest wybór postaci jaką tworzymy na początku. Aby jak najmniej się wkurzać najlepszym wyborem jest czysty łucznik lub mag-łucznik. Trzon towarzyszy to 2 wojowników i mag. Sam z początku stworzyłem woja pod bronie dwuręczne, ale widząc, że jednak brakuje mi kogoś z bronią dystansową zagrałem od nowa, tym razem ze stworzonym łucznikiem, co potem okazało się strzałem w dziesiątkę, bo odpowiednio rozwinięty siał niesamowite spustoszenie i jeden strzał równał się pewnym martwym przeciwnikiem.

Blackguards

L’histoire commence en prison où le héros s’évade de son incarcération pour le meurtre supposé d’une princesse. Désormais fugitif, le voilà donc flanqué d’un nain paranoïaque et d’un mage moustachu à la morale fragile (oui, je sais, on dirait le synopsis du film O’Brother). Si les protagonistes de cette épopée sont donc bel et bien des fugitifs à l’opposé des héros au sourire étincelant ils connaitront au final, en 5 actes, les mêmes péripéties que les héros classiques de JDR : voyage-enquête-dénouement-d’un-complot-maléfique-trahison-sauvetage-du-monde....

Wwhat can I say about it? Some of the battles can seem impossible. Save a lot. Not just a quick save, but named saves too. I like that many of the battles have to be repeated with new strategies. You will need heal spells, potions, poisons, nets, traps and some good strategy. Try to figure out how to get the overhead perspective to work because sometimes WASD camera control just won't do. I have a trackball mouse, so sometimes I can't see all the enemies or my PCs' positions. For regular mice, it should be the scroll-wheel to zoom all the way out. I like the spell effects.

I got this title, because I have quite liked ""The Dark Eye"" digital universe this far, Drakensang games having introduced me to it, and I think I like Demonicon better than the average game critic. I am generally a high-fantasy RPG fan, tending to like pauseable party based tactical combat evolved from Baldur's Gate the best.

In essence: I am not a natural fan of turn-based combat, and the biggest challenge to me on this first play-through is figuring out how to best invest my leveling points across attiributes, special abilities and skills etc.

However: I have liked the combat with Blackguards a lot this far, and have not found game-play frustrating, because the encounters are not that punishing after choosing the setting for players not familiar with Dark Eye rules at least. I've had both a few reloads, as well as feeling of particular successes when environmental effect or tactic has been just right!

What I like about these games is that the game-world feels like it has its own identity, and back-ground lore of belief systems, power structurs and faction relationships, owing to the original non-digital IP.

The gameplay design choices are in my view well prioritised, in view that the developer probably does not have a budget nowhere near the North American big gaming studios. Some choices are not so intutive to me, thou - I for example struggled a bit how to figure out how to get the world map after the intorductionary graveyeard quest!

I am personally pleased to have noticed this title, and have enjoyed my game a lot this far. I am curious to advance the story, and learning more about the game universe is also something that I personally enjoy with each Dark Eye title.",1479227777,1479227777,True,1,0,0.520588397979736328,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While the story sells itself as a dark narrative where you play as outlaws, it’s rather cliche and heroic. The Dark Eye ruleset is the true drawing point. While some rules where cut, such as most non-combat talents, it remains a solid and complex (if rather intimidating) classless system, offering ample freedom when creating your character. It’s a joy for hardcore players, but very poorly explained for newcomers. Sadly, the forced party members end up limiting some of your party building possibilities – sometimes even forcing a restart.

Blackguards knows its limitations and uses some unconventional design choices to compensate them, betting everything on its battles – cities are presented as simple animated backgrounds with stores and NPCs to talk with, exploration is limited to a 2D world map full of icons, dungeons are but a semi-linear sequence of battles without rest and the story is told via simple cutscenes, with an occasional decision to be made. This leads to an unique “Western Final Fantasy Tactics” feel, and while the game first hours are very linear, it later opens up to a wide range of interesting side-quests.

Daedalic’s background as an adventure game developer is felt here in an unusual way. There are no random battles in Blackguards, meaning that every encounter happens in an unique arena specifically designed for it, often with unique challenges or tactical puzzles. There are traps, time limits, holes that spawn enemies, movable and destructible objects, healing orbs, falling chandeliers, mechanical blades, flying dragons, swamp gas, giant tentacles, mind-controlling plants, draw bridges, collapsing passageways, a giant cage on a crane, etc. 

There’s not a single RPG out there that offers so many interesting combat scenarios. This alone makes Blackguards a must-play for any tactical fan – or RPG designer. 

Unfortunately, the game stretches out for far too long (40 to 60 hours), and the limited variety of enemies and equipment result in a rather stale second half of the game. Still, fans of Tactical RPGs will have a blast.",1479051037,1479082080,True,12,2,0.623929083347320557,3,True,False,False,False,,,

+庞大的西方魔幻世界观
+优秀的剧情讲述
+战棋类的多策略战斗模式
+战场中可交互环境
+优秀的人物养成系统
+新增的简体中文

[h1]缺点：[/h1]
-大地图点对点的移动模式
-战斗中玄学的命中率和伤害值
-智障一般的AI
-战斗难度的过高递增
-战斗中不可旋转视角
-糟糕的机翻中文

这款游戏的问题基本不叫问题，游戏开场带入盖很强
中间穿插各种动画CG表现优秀
而且20G的容量内容也相对丰富
游戏中人物的培养需要靠AP值，而AP值是在日常战斗中获取的，数量有限需要合理分配
金钱同上，不能够用刷刷刷大法来完成

但是，整个游戏中我感觉自己在被游戏“玩”
完全感受不到我在玩游戏的乐趣
游戏一开始的战斗难度很低，基本上2，3刀就能砍死一个怪
轻轻松松的推进
到了中期难度突然上升
所谓的玄学命中和伤害就在这里开始表现了
技能，装备都在提升，命中率提示80%~90%,但是就能连着好几次被闪避，被格挡
而我的主角扛着大盾，属性很高的格挡和闪避，在碰到敌人20%的命中下，依然连续掉血
我感觉自己加血加属性完全没有用，命中率的数据也没有什么关心点，反正都是50%的概率，中或者不中
但是当你队友马上就要跪了，放一个84%回复术居然也会失败！！！加个血都失败！还怎么玩！
而伤害值更是玄学，双手挥动武器居然还不如单手挥动武器伤害高
满场的1血2血怪，被敌人一个回复水晶回满血，当时想死的心都有了
再说这智障一般的AI，敌人智商是神，队友简直是猪
好几关的保护战斗中，我保护还来不及，AI居然自己往往火墙里面钻，最后烧死了也不带动的
同学，你真的不叫邱XX吗？
过个河都失败！亲爱的，你这表现的是平静的小溪，为什么水流会如此湍急！一过河就摔，至少让我过去挨两下打啊！
战斗中的视角一直是平行，只能拉近和拉远，然而当我的人物和怪在一个垂直线上的时候，我真的是点不到怪啊！！！
能不能旋转一下啊！！！太难受了！！！小心翼翼的点搜寻者，看着敌人亮起来的瞬间赶紧点，结果错过了！摔！！！

总之，完成这个游戏感觉松了一口气，没有带给我什么乐趣，反而让我一直憋屈难受
尤其是当你命中率在90%连续三次被闪避的时候，S/L大法都不想用了好么

Very, very constrained in level-up points. The leveling up system is quite involved, and the constraint from the points is too tight. It feels like that there is one layer too many,,,
The animation is... special. Everyone has a dislocated jaw. 

The good:
Even though you can see the plot twist coming from a mile away, I still struggled to make the ""right"" decisions to try and get a ""good""ending. (Once you play enough games, you begin to see the ""right"" choice.)
The game has a high F-U factor. Spent 20 hours and tons of money leveling up a character? Guess what, they're dead now, too bad. You think your arrows can break a crystal and you didn't think to equip your archer with a different weapon? Well, that's sucks for you.

Ich kann es all denen sehr ans Herz legen, die gerne tüfteln und eher bedächtig vorgehen (Action-Fans sollten die Finger davon lassen). Die gewonnenen Erfahrungspunkte sollten wohlüberlegt ausgegeben werden, sonst ist bald der Punkt erreicht, an dem man viele Kämpfe nicht mehr schafft und frustriert aufgibt. Ich habe selbst erst einmal für etliche Stunden drauf los gespielt, bis ich die Feinheiten alle verstanden habe. Dann habe ich erneut von vorne begonnen, einen Charakter ganz nach meinen Vorstellungen erstellt und siehe da, es hat geklappt. Und dabei Spaß gemacht, umso mehr, je weiter ich in der Geschichte vorangekommen bin. Ich bin froh, dass ich auch nach mehr als 80 Stunden immer noch nicht ganz durch bin, denn am Ende eines so tollen Spieles bin ich immer ein wenig traurig (weil es vorbei ist).

Die wichtigsten Vorteile:
- Das Spiel besitzt eine Story, die gut und spannend erzählt wird. Viele Charaktere wachsen einem schnell ans Herz, bzw. auf einige Feinde bekommt man regelrecht einen Hass.
- Gute deutsche Sprecher, jede Stimme ist gut zu unterscheiden. Kurze, prägnante Dialoge (kein blabla!).
- Einprägsame, nicht nervige Musik.
- Jeder Kampf ist anders und findet auf verschieden gestalteten Territorien statt. Neben Nah- und Fernkampf kann man Fallen auslegen, Brände entfachen, Barrikanen errichten, die Waffen vergiften, zaubern, Schatztruhen öffnen, Hebel umlegen, Glocken läuten usw. usw. Desöfteren müssen bestimmte Ziele innerhalb einer bestimmen Rundenanzahl erreicht werden. Nicht selten passieren während des Kampfes unvorhersehbare Dinge: Der Feind erhält Verstärkung, Brücken brechen ein, Spinnen schlüpfen oder ähnliches. Oft reiht sich auch ein zweiter oder gar dritter Kampf unmittelbar an, so dass man darauf achten muss, den ersten mit möglichst wenig Schaden zu überstehen.
- Man kann jederzeit und in freier Reihenfolge eine der vielen Nebenquests erfüllen, um Abenteuerpunkte zu sammeln und die Charaktere zu verbessern.
- Das Spiel läuft stabil, kurze Ladebildschirme, keine Bugs.

Ganz wenig Nachteile:
- Der Kampfbildschirm lässt sich nicht drehen und auch nicht nach oben/unten verschieben. Er lässt sich lediglich kippen. Manchmal muss man auf das Charakterportrait klicken, damit dieser wieder sichtbar wird, wenn er sich zu weit oben oder unten befindet.
- Wenn man Pech hat und der Gegner Glück, hilft oft nur, den Kampf erneut zu versuchen.
- Einige Kämpfe sind ultraschwer (wenige habe ich auch nach 5-10 Versuchen noch nicht geschafft; ich bleibe aber dran!)

Fazit:
Ein forderndes Spiel, das wohltuend anders ist und in Sachen Qualität den allgemein gut kritisierten Adventures von Daedalic in nichts nachsteht. Klare Kaufempfehlung für Spieler mit Köpfchen!

I wouldn't go in either direction. To me this is a solid Combat RPG with a pretty decent story and excellent voice acting. The characters are a bit stereotypical, though. There's your hero, the crazed dwarf who sees dragons everywhere and the macho mage, as well as some other characters I won't spoil now, but their backstory and motivations aren't that much better. Still, they managed to make this into a more interesting story than Dragon Age: Inquisition...for a CRPG it's more than you need.

Be warned though, this is NOT a traditional RPG, you will NOT be exploring a huge world, you will NOT have hundreds of different dialogues and quests and choices. There is quite a bit of that but it's not the main focus. Quests are usually: go here and do that. And by go here I mean ""click on the overworld map to move to one of the interactive points"" or on the city screen. This is how you navigate the world of Blackguards, you click a POI on a map and your party moves there. This is either a city in which you can further navigate different parts of said city and speak to people, buy stuff, heal and rest. Anything else is mostly combat.

Combat and gear in general are pretty in depth. There are different types of weapons which all have advantages and disadvantages and must be learned to use. So your spear wielding barbarian is no good with a 2 handed sword for instance. To improve a certain aspect of a character you have to spend AP. You can spend AP for pretty much everything: ranged combat, specific weapons, magic resist, hit points, detecting traps, healing wounds, improving spells, movement points, etc. Like I said the system is pretty deep. Special weapons also have special attributes that you need to factor in. Maybe a weapon does less ""attack damage"", but has a +6 fire damage value, increasing it's effective damage again. You need to do the math in your head, though. There aren't too many unique weapons though so not that big of a deal. Of course there is also armor and set bonuses as well as magic you need to consider.

Once you're happy with your characters' equipment you can do battle. On the easiest difficulty most battles can be won at first try. On the harder difficulties, however, the game becomes rather difficult and potentially frustrating. And I think this is why the game has ""so many"" negative reviews. The combat can be unforgiving and you can't save during a battle. Battles also last forever. Do you like Heroes of Might and Magic? Yeah, like that in the late game. One battle can easily take up to 30 minutes, esp. on higher difficulties. There is of course also a random element in hit and crit chance. There is no 100% hit chance, only when an enemy is prone. And even then I needed to roll x, which I did, and still missed. I'd say that's a bug. Oh, apparently the chances are decided by dice and not actual percentages, so beware of false security. There's a handy battle log though.

Overall I feel that this is a pretty good product IF you are looking for this type of game. If you want Dragon Age or Baldur's Gate, don't bother. This is not that.",1476913153,1476913153,True,2,0,0.496271431446075439,0,False,False,False,False,,,

       整体来看还算是不错的战棋游戏，但是缺点也很明显：

       首先，职业缺点：
       战士分了敏捷和力量两类，但是直到打通关，敏捷系列的技能有用的就一个致命，剑刃风暴可以理解成自由点的弱化营救打击，但是后期经常被一群小怪围的时候，这点自由也没多大意义。
       法师很捉急，剧透[spoiler]最有用的弓箭妹子中期还哔掉了[/spoiler],能用到的技能有限的不得了，而且蛋疼的回复魔法导致不太敢穿金属防具（穿重甲的魔法师这辈子就和快捷酒店结缘了），于是导致法师都得往弓箭或弩箭上靠，做一个磨工手吧（真的磨人啊！）。

       其次装备和一些设定上：
       其实这方面问题一定程度上影响了上面说的职业问题。法师中，法杖回蓝奇慢无比，而且都没有魔法伤害加成，后期能拿到的法杖有一把居然是带毒的且没！有！回！蓝！这游戏最强回蓝套装居然是一把剑和匕首的组合（甘道夫好歹一手智障一手犯贱啊，额貌似不是一个设定体系的），这就导致了法师不想酱油，就得练弩箭或者弓箭•••可弓箭太强了，有3连射，还有7群射，但是这又牵扯到游戏另一个蛋疼问题，命中！顺道吐槽了吧，90的命中连着4次空的心情谁了解，90命中啊！！！同一个人把把都会出现MISS，唉。最烦的是弓箭手，三连和7群只要MISS那就是全MISS，没有单独判定这一说，后期一个占地半径三格范围的大BOSS，90命中，一箭过去全是MISS的痛苦谁了解！（7根箭啊！最关键是这游戏命中统一计算，每根箭的伤害貌似是单独计算，奇葩的不行）
       再说说近战，这游戏可以叫双手剑的忧伤。因为游戏里面有一个叫做步兵伤害的伤害类型，这玩意我到现在都没理解是怎么来的。看看游戏里的装备一套的抗性，挥砍很容易堆，猛击次之，穿刺又次之，后期人类敌人基本都是穿的一套金属防具，前两个抗性相当高，穿刺抗性比较低但是也有明显减免感受，但是即便是游戏里最好的一套金属装备，步兵伤害这个抗性也少的可怜（20%貌似）。
       游戏里，基本上剑类是挥砍伤害，锤子斧子为猛击伤害，长矛、花剑、匕首、弓弩常用箭矢弩矢为穿刺类型，此外，还有一些魔法伤害，火焰伤害的特殊玩具就不多说了，最关键就是这个步兵伤害，一些支线任务给的特殊武器，带步兵伤害类型的只有斧子和锤子，长矛就一把带而且任务时间长的要命，于是，只能给锤系势力低头了（其实游戏里有一个系列基本是稳定步兵伤害类型的，就是各种镰刀••••••）。
       另外这个穿刺属性很想吐槽啊，骷髅架子居然免疫穿刺伤害，弓箭射出去没动能吗？！好吧，就算你说骷髅架子箭能穿过去，那尼玛僵尸一身肉怎么也免疫？（我就换了个弓箭类型之后就不穿了？还有长矛那么大一根东西你说免疫就免疫啦？）

       附上一个后期队伍配置：敏捷战士拿长矛（步兵伤害那个）和弓，两个法师魔弓（幸好第一个法师没学弩），主角第一次玩不懂，选了个战士（应该选弓或者法师能轻松点），初期全学的双手剑，到后期全转成锤斧系了，顺便说一下，就伤害输出而言，矮子才是主角，暴击伤害感觉有隐藏属性••••••

       最后说说游戏细节上：
       其实一个游戏的好坏，设定上奇葩，剧情有些许不合理，也不妨碍相当多的人继续玩下去，但是细节上给人别扭确实会让人难生好感，这个游戏就有几点，比如ESC没法关一些菜单和对话；物品没有叠加的功能（弓箭98和1叠不到一起，非要占两个格子，一怒之下全卖了，用CE改了个998，清爽许多•••我确实没找到方法，有知道的也别告之，不打算再玩了）；物品排序功能极度糟糕，任务道具和药品是一个大栏位的（貌似排序方式就是你得到物品的先后顺序），导致很大的不便，没错，说的就是你，步兵伤害长矛！那么多碎片就不能扔一个栏位显示个数字么？！！！第一块和第二块中间隔了一堆物品，数数都要翻好几页！！（我就懒得说这么霸气的东西最后拿到手跟捧了朵菊花似得••••••）
      这些都不算什么，最关键的是，这游戏的汉化，啧啧，不知道是找的哪家汉化出来的，关键的人名和地名居然不统一，还有每次战利品界面那个单词我都不知道怎么能翻译出来的。
    
      想了想，还是推荐吧，毕竟剧情和整体游戏性还可以（为什么STEAM不能加个中评啊！）。",1476813977,1476814246,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

2. 간간히 보이는 UI 버그나 한글 출력 오류문제
3. 분기점...

케릭터간 순서도 바꿀수 없다. 순서는 그냥 들어온 순서대로 나오기때문에 격수나 마법사별로 따로 모아두고 싶어도

한글 출력 오류는 뭐...우리말의 된소리 발음쪽에서 발견되는듯하다. 뿌 라던가..뭐 그런쪽에서 글씨가 뭉개진다.
나름 세심하게 만들어서 이런저런 엔딩을 보라고 분기점을 만들어놓은거 같은데...이게 정말이지 최악이였다.

물론 실패도 뜬다. 왜냐하면 DND 룰을 따르고 있기때문에ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
그 모든게 확률게임이다. 그나마 확실한건 전투에 들어가기전에 카리스마 수치를 이용해서 꼬시는것 뿐인데..이것도 남발하다보면 퀘스트를 몇개 못하고 지나갈수도 있다. 사용자 입장에서는 한방에 쭈욱 끝을 보고 싶은데 강제로 분기를 만들어놓고 원하는 선택도 못한체 게임 개발사가 만든 정해진 답변을 선택한다.
DND 룰을 따르면서 돈이나 레벨 노가다도 불가하며, 진심 아끼고 아껴서 전투에 임하고 전략? 전술? 그런거 없다. 
그냥 공격성공, 마법이 날아갈 확률 그 모든게 잘 뜨기만을 기다리면 된다. 만약 잘 안됬다고? 그럼 빠른 로드를 통해서 다시 전투를 되돌리면 된다.

스토리 초반에는 지루할정도로 느린 전개와 답답함을 느끼게 된다. 개발사에서 나름 스토리도 잘~~ 확인해보라고 과거까지 가서 전투의 회상을 하라고 만들어놨지만 오히려 몰입감을 헤친다. 그러다가 중반 이후로는 정신없이 스토리가 진행되다가 막의 마지막에는 스토리고 뭐고 그냥 전투와 전투뿐이다.
마치 전투의 마지막에는 끝없는 전투를 넣어놔서 이것이 진정한 보스전이다!! 라고 말하는것 같지만 그냥 작붕을 덮기위한 수작으로 밖엔 안보인다.

It's just so inbalanced. The classes are not in balance. The attributes, skills, talents, weapon talents and special talents (I probably forgot something) are not in balance. The cost of items and services - compare for instance provisions, healing, bandages, potions and taverns - are not in balance.

The game is haphazard inside and outside of combat. You may begin a series of events only to notice that there is no way to return anymore. There are unforeseeable series of battles, and failing one may set you back an HOUR of progress. Failing even one spell might flip the situation completely. Putting all points in a single weapon talent can screw you up, because, well... find it out yourself.

But all this got me thinking. Are we too pampered with forgiving games? Perhaps. Here's a game that you can seriously break by playing it wrong (or right, in a good way!). Here's a game that requires putting those annoyingly flexible talent points into right places.

1. ""Более 180 уникальных карт, которые служат местом сражения и представляют собой постоянно меняющиеся, новые интересные задания"". 
Из 180 карт примерно 165 сводятся к ""убей всех противников"" и только 15 содержат какие-то уникальные и интересные задания. Да и интерактивные объекты, которые дают какой-то простор для тактики есть не всегда. По большей части они или мешают или не нужны.
2. ""Заранее наделайте себе бутербродов, потому что увлекательная игра в стиле мрачного фэнтези займет более 40 часов игрового времени"".
Мне хватило 32 часа на досканальное прохождение игры со всеми побочками. Играл на нормале, на харде может быть и правда больше 40 выйдет. И нет, это не дарк фентези. Классический фентезийный сюжет а-ля ""древнее зло пробудилось"". Короче играть в игру из-за сюжета или атмосферы не стоит. Мы тут тактические экраны зачищаем, остальное второстепенно.
3. ""Станьте предводителем команды числом до пяти персонажей, и приведите ее к блистательной победе или оглушительному поражению.""
Концовка у игры одна, единственная сюжетная развилка влияет на то, будет ли с последним боссом сражаться 5 персонажей или 4. Сокрушительные поражения лечатся задрачиванием сейв-лоада, пока не повезет.
4. ""Насладитесь завораживающими пейзажами, нарисованными вручную. На них приятно посмотреть, даже если членов вашей команды только что размазали по стенке."" 
Эта игра не про графон. Глаза от боли не вытекают да и ладно.
5. ""Задайте боевую тактику собственным выбором заклинаний, навыков и умений. Нападение? Защита? Стратегический план? Как вы преодолеете сложившуюся ситуацию? Выбор за вами"".
Один из плюсов игры - каждого персонажа можно качать как угодно, учить любые навыки и умения. Разве что из не-мага нельзя сделать мага. Но вот из мага танка-кастера запросто. Естественно, лучше заранее определиться с путями прокачки и ролью персонажей в отряде. При этом стоит помнить, что [spoiler] лучницу в конце второй главы убъют, а вместо нее дают ведьму, которая только после длительной прокачки станет приносить пользу[/spoiler]. Мне этот сюжетный поворот здорово попортил кровь и сломал все тактические схемы.
6. ""Чтобы получить дополнительное преимущество в битве, воспользуйтесь интерактивными объектами, например, пчелиными ульями и бочками, или взорвитесь, войдя в облако воспламеняющегося болотного газа с зажженным факелом.""
Интерактивные объекты есть примерно на половине карт и, чаще всего, они создают дополнительные сложности, а не дают преимущество.
7. ""Нанесите серьезные повреждения врагу с помощью 40 особенных умений и более 90 заклинаний… или же окажитесь на принимающей стороне и исчезнете с лица земли.""
Про заклинания - брехня. Всего в игре штук 20 заклинаний, у каждого 4 уровня. Кстати, маги в игре очень сильно ограничены, мана кончается быстро, пузырьки стоят дорого. Но при грамотном использовании способны неиллюзорно нагибать. И, естественно больше половины заклинаний и навыков - мусор, который пригодится или пару раз за игру, в очень специфичных ситуациях, или вовсе никогда. Например все одноручное рукопашное оружие - отсосное, а арбалеты и метателтное оружие наголову слабее луков (им можно прокачать навыки позволяющие запускать по 3 стрелы за раз или 7 стрел по площади - дико поломная штука). Думаю, очень легко прокачаться так, что игра на высоких уровнях сложности станет непроходимой. 
В целом, это хорошая тактическая РПГ, не лишенная определенных недостатков, объяснимых прежде всего неопытностью разработчиков в данном жанре и бюджетностью. Но для тех, кому нравятся подобные игры - поиграть определенно стоит.

Das Spiel startet mit dem aktuellen Betriebssystem nicht korrekt, bzw. wenn es mal doch startet so hat man nach dem Startvideo plötzlich ein schwarzes Bild.
Die Lösung, welche in diversen Foren kusiert, funktioniert nur zu 50%. Ich musste immer wieder, zwischen WinXP und Win7 wechseln, damit das Spiel dann doch lief.

Nun zum Spiel an sich. Grafik und Sound sind für die damalige Zeit ganz in Ordnung. Das Regelwerk basiert auf dem DSA mit einigen leichten Abschwächungen.
Die Story ist weder überraschend noch wirklich spannend,die Charaktere blieben bei dem kompletten Spielerlebnis ehr blass und eintönig.
Die Skillung ist, bis auf beim Hauptchar, teilweise bereits vorgegeben und eine Umskillung vom Magier hin zum Kämpfer zwar möglich aber nicht wirklich Sinnvoll.
Die einzigen wirklichen Kämpfer können auch nicht zu Magiern gemacht werden, da sie die Möglichkeit schlicht nicht haben. Das Spiel erklärt das mit der Herkunft der beiden Chars.

- Story is not great, but is cativating enough
- Graphics and style are neat.

CONS:
- The puzzlish combat I've mentioned made me repeat several beattles over and over
- General interface feels a little awkward.
- Character development takes some time to get used to. Should have the option to redistribute the points somehow.
- Quite straightfowrad and linear, sidequests don't feel like add much.

I did not install it at the time because the looks of the game did not appeal to me at first. I even thought back then that this was a strategy game (its actually a turn based RPG :P) 

One month ago, I decided to install the game in order to get the steam cards. Based on the reviews I was expecting a pretty aweful game. Nevertheless, I decided to play for an hour instead of idling.

The first screen I encountered was the character creation. I was pleasantly suprised by the depth and variety of choices and I found myself tinkering at the various options and builds for an hour!

Well, after an hour, I thought that the options did not really matter because I wasnt going to play the game given how bad it must be according to the reviews I had read. However, I was still waiting for those cards so I decided to have a look at the actual game. 

Again, to my suprise, although it started slowly, the game captured my interest. Slowly, but steadily, I started enjoying the story and the battles gameplay. That was it, after some time I was hooked!

Here is what I think of the game:

+Give the game some time at the beginning. It starts slowly but it steadily builds a strong story! Same goes for the gameplay. It looks a bit strange at first but I grew to like it very much! 
+The Graphs are really good. 
+Full sound + Voice + Subtitles 
+Dialogue options
+Decisions matter
+Challenging game
+Character creation system. There is no level up system - Using adventure points to create unique ways of fighting. 
+Story twists. 
+I havent encountered any in game bugs. 

-Some may find the game TOO challenging. Its not a forgiving game. You have to think the consequences of your gameplay. 
-Linear. Most of the times there is only one battle available. 
-THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT IS THAT THE GAME SEEMS TO HAVE SOME PROBLEM RUNNING IN WINDOWS 10. However, this issue can be solved with a little bit of tinkering. There are numerous solutions out there. 

To sum up, I fully recommend this game at a discount and even at full price if you enjoy turn based RPGS. I dont understand whats going on with other reviews. Perhaps people were expecting a different kind of game? However, keep in mind that the game has some compatibility issues with Win 10.

Il gioco non spiega nulla su come funzionino le dinamiche delle stats nelle azioni di gioco quindi o vi documentate o sbaglierete a creare\sviluppare gli eroi e prima o poi arriverete a un fight che non potete vincere e non potrete andare avanti. Stessa cosa per coperture, range ecc... Questa è la premessa.

Il gioco è assurdamente complicato, l'rng è il 99.9% di ogni fight e a meno che non abbiate minmaxato i vostri personaggi sarete costretti a ripetere decine di volte il fight perchè un tiro di dadi semplicemente è andato male. Non c'è nemmeno possibilità di annullare un azione o salvare durante i fight quindi anche un missclick vi può rovinare tutto costringendovi a ricominciare. La magia (cure e danni) sono rng anch'esse e le stats del personaggio influenzano pochissimo la % in vostro favore. Se non credete alle mie parole c'è un mio screenshot dove una magia al 100% di riuscita è fallita.

Il gioco non è un RPG, manca la componente RP dato che a parte una customizzazione del vostro personaggio il gioco è statico, segue una linea e non ci sono decisioni che influenzano minimamente qualcosa. Inoltre gli altri personaggi del party possono essere sviluppati seguendo solo PRECISI sviluppi, andate da altre parti e vi ritroverete dei personaggi inutili.

Molte volte vi ritroverete a fare 4-5 incontri di fila dove non potrete riposare nel mentre. Il gioco ve lo fa capire in certi modi almeno.

Alcuni ""boss"" delle sidequest non possono essere fatti a meno che non abbiate il party configurato in un certo modo. A meno che non vogliate ripetere l'incontro all'infinito finchè i dadi non vi grazino con eccezionale fortuna. es. (se ci arrivate) la lily al capitolo 3 non può essere fatta a meno che non siate tutti arcieri (praticamente immune alla magia, i melee vengono esplosi prima di arrivargli addosso, un personaggio non è utilizzabile).

Gli incantesimi che userete in gioco utili sono 3 circa. Gli altri sono inutili. I debuff sono inutili, qualsiasi caster che abbiate sottomano trattatelo come danni + danni + danni + danni. O healing. Per far entrare un debuff il gioco compie 3 tiri percentuale e i vantaggi sono praticamente minimi.

I talenti servono poco o nulla se non a conoscere quanti hp ha il nemico o quanta iniziativa ha. I talenti per le armi sarete costretti a prenderne alcuni inutili per sbloccare delle capacità speciali MANDATORIE per i vostri personaggi.

La trama è interessante ma non approfondisce bene i personaggi rendendo l'idea che sia stato fatto molto di corsa.

Giudizio? Non ne vale la pena, il gioco è frustrante e vi fa capire quasi a ogni fight che le vostre strategie o come avete sviluppato i pg conta poco o nulla contro a tiri fortunati o sfortunati.

Every single time you miss a hit, and your enemy never misses at all, and you sit there for a dozen turns soaking up damage for what feels like--no strategic reason, you realise, ""Oh great, this is one of those games where I need to return to town every fucking time I finish a level, to heal up""

Why? Why not just heal back to full between missions? What purpose does returning to the inn after every mission serve as an improvement to the pacing of the game? If you take a bow for your caster (I mean, that makes sense right, you've read the reviews, you know you're gonna run out of mana and you're a ranged character) and you switch to it, and ""Oh, I'm pointblank range with this monster. Hit chance 25% 4dmg"" monster has 20 hp. Wtf. So statistically it should take me 20 fucking turns to kill this? I'm not talking about this being late game and you made a series of bad choices. This is the first mission that doesn't hand-hold you through a required tutorial.

Turns out, yes. It's going to take you twenty fucking turns to do anything, while trying to negotiate the ridiculous gimmick (plug those lice holes! Pull those levers!) no. I was done. The game is not balanced in any satisfying way. It's not ""challenging"". At best, it just challenges your patience to see how many times you can watch your ridiculously weak spell miss for the 20th time, before you realise there's absolutely no pay-off. I understand miss and dodge mechanics. But when your game is structured around you missing more than 50% of the time... there's no fun in that. No one is sitting at home playing this game thinking ""Oh oh oh, I missed! What fun! That's 3 in the row!""",1468399736,1468400056,False,7,1,0.494090765714645386,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a great example of turn-based strategy gone horribly wrong and just because something uses hexagons doesn't make it inherently worthwhile.
Blackguards is cheaply made. That much becomes apparent as soon as the voice acting starts torturing your speakers. The voice actor for the male main character is weirdly familiar from other budget titles. He's not trying very hard and neither is anyone else. The graphics are also fairly poor. I didn't expect much but it looks incredibly cheap and one has to suspect it was meant to be a tablet title originally. The art direction is also incredibly generic. This game makes Dragon Age look like Zeno Clash.

Most of the game is really just battles. Towns, numerous as they are, serve to buy gear and heal up and not much more. There are side quests but they almost always result in even more combat. You would think a game that contains this much fighting would have deep mechanics but no. There is not even flanking or backstabbing. Most of the weapon abilities make you hit harder or pierce armor in exchange for accuracy and that's basically it for physical attackers. Abilities that can hit multiple enemies are only available very late and they are not great. There is a knockdown but it virtually never works and most elite enemies are outright immune to it. The game is terrible with double standards like this.

Mages have a bit more to do but the spells are horribly imbalanced, ranging from absolutely useless to pretty much necessary to beat the game. You can't even make a proper offensive mage because spells do poor damage and are not very mana-efficient. There's virtually no way to restore mana outside of the very poor regeneration between turns. Potions do exist but they are insanely expensive. They're something you use in a boss fight and not something you can waste in a regular encounter. To make things worse, spells are also line of sight dependent. That means if you surround an enemy with your melee fighters, you can't hit them and if one of your characters gets surrounded you can't heal them. Want to throw a fireball into a cluster of enemies? You can't because you have no line of sight to the center so you can never really hit the whole group. It's as annoying as it sounds. Level 4 spells on the other are insane. They can hit every single enemy or ally on the entire map, no matter how far away they are. Sadly, later on enemies use the same spells against you and it's awful because you can't do anything about it.

The game's biggest downfall are the gimmick maps. This is hard to explain. Basically, half the encounters are built some sort of gimmick except... the game doesn't explain these gimmicks to you or warns you that there even might be a gimmick instead of a regular skirmish. The most blatant example is when you plunder a crypt and you get attacked by a gang of skeletons (you never hear about skeleton gang violence in the media, typical) and every time you destroy one, it gets resurrected by some crystal. Fair enough, you have the skeletons distracted by some of your fighters and have another one sneak around and attack the crystal. You attack it with your spear and...it does no damage. The crystal is immune to thrust damage. There is no feedback to it, you can't figure it out on your own through the environment. Well, that would have been nice to know, I thought to myself. Most of the time the best way to beat is a map is to figure out the gimmick and immediately reload the fight in order to actually use it to its full effect. Everything else is an uphill battle.

So yeah, it's not a very good game. It's full of baffling design decisions and even the things outside of combat are not good. I could write for hours about the awful, incoherent story but it's not worth the effort.",1466233107,1466268641,False,20,5,0.584164619445800781,0,False,False,False,False,,,

-	Thorough character creation
-	Fun/beautiful environment and settings

Cons

-	Continuous failing high percentages ( 98% ) attacks often makes strategies pointless

First I want to say that the review was negative because i was really sad I couldnt finish the game, that is to say I was loving it, now I intend to finish. 
The game is great, really good Character Creation, thats the main feature for me, really complex at first, so read a guide, but it only means they didnt dumb it down to appeal to the general public, hence the mixed reviews. but once you understand it and get used to it it is clear what a work of art it is, the people who created it are master RPG designer and i would love to see a table top RPG system created by them.
I even feel bad for leaving a bad review for so long, sorry about that devs. And keep up the good work. I even bought their complete collection even though i already had this game, so it was not optimal, but some great games there too. i didnt have time to try the second BG yet but i hope its as good as this one.

- old negative review-
the game is awesome, no doubt about it, perfect RPG.
but it freezes my entire system after one specific fight in chapter 4, it´s really disappointing not beeing able to finish the game because of that, i have all the recomended system requirements, but loading takes too long and this one cutscene appears to be requiring more memory than recomended. i dont know...

-inventory items are uninteresting: you only get good stuff from a few side quest in the entire game, merchants around the world only sell cheap/bad stuff. also I think the weight of the stuff (especially supplies) is unbalanced.

- Character development is complex
- Good setting
- Varied enemies
- Variety of situations you find yourself into
- Nice graphics

So why downvote?

Because my friends, of two reasons.

The GAME BALANCE. It is so broken i cannot even believe it. Some fights are so unbalanced i had to actually lower the difficultry to Normal to beat them, which i never ever did for any game in my life. This because you are put in situations where you just need luck to make it out alive.

And Luck is the real master of this game, not skill nor strategy. Just pure luck. RNG (Random Numerical Generation) (What determines % of success or failure of things) is so determining in the combat that it just rules over everything. In other turn based games there is RNG of course, but also other factors like strategy, formations, class builds, level are critical to win a fight, but not here in blackguards, not at the same level.

A single random critical, or spell failure (spells can FAIL casting, yes you got it right), or a random miss with 99% chance, or again some trap which activates randomly decides to turn just towards your party and wipe it out with a blast of fire.

All these things can make a fight fail. Random chance upon chance upon chance upon chance. Not even in Vegas there is so much gambling.

This more than a game of skill is a game of luck. I have many many years of experience in all kinds of RPGs but i just cannot take it anymore. I find myself by now to repeat fight over and over and over again just to get a fight where the RNG favors me, where traps do not activate on my team, or on the target i have to protect, etc, and make me fail after a well planned strategy.

- Gra potrafi naprawdę bezlitośnie karać za złe decyzje w rozwijaniu bohaterów. Za pierwszym razem jak grałem, natrafiłem na moment, w którym nie mogłem ruszyć gry dalej, a próbowałem wszystkiego. Tym gorzej, że był to czwarty rozdział, a w grze mamy ich pięć. Dałem grze jeszcze jedną szansę i zacząłem od początku po dłuższym czasie przerwy i tym razem grę ukończyłem bez problemów. Tym razem byłem skupiony na rozwoju bohaterów i gra nie stanowiła większego wyzwania. Było bardzo przyjemnie, ale grubo ponad połowę gry musiałem grać dwa razy, by ostatecznie móc tak tę grę odebrać.
- Animacje. W grze bohaterowie mają ich po prostu za mało. Jedna animacja jest wspólna dla picia mikstur, pociągania dźwigni, przewracania beczek i w zasadzie wszystkich akcji z wykorzystaniem otoczenia. Kiepsko to wygląda. Wszystkie zaklęcia mają praktycznie jedną animację, a szkoda bo efekty zaklęć już wyglądają nie raz widowiskowo, co jest psute tym, że jedna i ta sama skromna dosyć animacja bohatera rzucającego czar wywołuje te efekty czarów. Animacje umierania zwierząt bywają też dziwaczne, kiedy podczas umierania podskakują. Zabawnie wygląda też sytuacja, kiedy powalonego towarzysza ktoś dobije i ten musi wstać, by potem upaść na ziemię.
- Gra ma dziwne bugi, aczkolwiek żaden nie występuję w samej rozgrywce. Gra potrafi Ci przyznać osiągnięcie za coś, co zrobiłeś 15 minut temu, albo nawet nie przyznać osiągnięcia wcale, mimo że warunki zostały spełnione. Po ukończeniu gry sprawdziłem z ciekawości, jakie są w grze osiągnięcia i okazało się, że kilka z nich z niewyjaśnionych przyczyn nie zostały mi przyznane, jak np. ten do którego wymagana jest znajomość zaklęcia na poziomie 18-tym, mimo że miałem kilka postaci z zaklęciami na tym poziomie. A najbardziej rozwalił mnie błąd, kiedy przegrałem ostateczne starcie i to srogo a mimo to gra mi wyświetliła zakończenie i przyznała osiągnięcie za zwycięstwo.

Comparing the number of pros and cons, it's a really impressive game; but one of the cons just happens to be super important to me, bringing the game down to just decent instead.

CONS
The game can basically be broken down into four parts: cutscenes; inventory/ability screens; towns/shops; and battle scenarios.  Each of these is actually very well done.  But it leaves the game feeling a bit hollow simply because you don't get much of a feeling of exploring.  You move around the map by clicking on dots.  You move around submaps by clicking on dots.  Even the towns/shops just feel like clicking on dots.  They shouldn't, because they're much more visual, but the game just builds that feeling of dot-clicking into it, and you can't shake it.  

The inventories get messy.  Weapons and armour can be seen separately, but everything else is all piled up in one section with no sorting options.  So when you're looking for healing or mana potions, be prepared to go through page after page of poisons, traps, buffing potions, throwing weapons, and EVEN all the 'quest items' - new and old, jumbled up with them.

PROS
The cutscenes are well done, the plot's interesting enough, and you really feel like you get to know the characters.

There's a good number of abilities, categorised in some interesting ways.  Most importantly, the spells have enough variety that you can really explore a range of different strategies.  Even within typical categories like direct damage or buffing, there's still variety.  (Potential SPOILER examples: [spoiler] Direct damage has single target, area of effect, enemy hunting single target, cloud spawning enemy hunting single target, and whole map blasts; and some of those stun, or knock down, or curse/debuff.  And that's just within direct damage.  My favourite quickly turned out to be a shadow duplicate spell - which for me meant creating a second archer-mage for 3-5 turns, whose arrows are shadow too, so it was like getting double the mileage out of each arrow). [/spoiler]  The variety might take a little while to sink in, because at first it looks like 24 spells with 4 levels of power each.  But within the 4 levels for each, most have at least one significant change, so it's actually more like 48 spells.

The options for non-spellcasters are more limited, but still allow for some good variety - especially since you can have up to three weapon sets; and/or make use of traps and throwing weapons.  It's hard to do early on, but each route you take eats up experience points, but this ultimately allows you to do things like: (a) Carry a giant two-handed bashing weapon for massive damage and quick battles, but be ready to switch into sword and shield if you need more defense and accuracy.  (b) Run around with a two-handed pike-style spear, but pitch javelins and poison bombs at your enemies before they get into melee range.  (c) Mix up archery and fencing.  (d) Go all archery, but set traps - especially stunning or slowing traps - around you when melee fighters look like they're going to get too close.  (e) etc, etc.

The weapons and armour are pretty bog-standard for an RPG overall, but are just varied enough.  The expense might seem frustrating at first, but I enjoyed the way it made me mix and match parts more often, and set different characters up with different equipment sets.  And when there are all kinds of traps and poisons and buff potions, etc, as well, it feels like you've always got something new to pick up.

The combat!  At first it looks like each map is going to be a matter of big vs small, wide vs narrow, and empty or covered with traps or blocking environment.  That'd lead to a bit of variety, but eventually you'd work out a couple of strategies that you'd just use over and over again.  But soon enough, you start seeing unique twists (some are repeated a couple of times; some are just used once).  There are plenty of them, and they are what really make the game worth it in the end.  (Potential SPOILER examples: [spoiler] A super long get to the end before the poisonous mist catches up to you map.  Skeletons keep coming back to life unless you smash the crystal maps.  Sneak through the dark and you won't have to fight at all maps. Maps with cages to open to let out support.  Maps with cages to close to trap beasts.  Maps with buildings you can knock down to crush some enemies.  Maps with spider webs hidden like traps and as bridges you can knock out from under the spiders.  And more and more.[/spoiler]

I really, really have. The character development system is complex and has a depth rarely found in RPGs. The story and choices are a combination of dark and darker, and yet there is no shortage of humor in the game. Having said all of that, I do NOT recommend this game for the casual gamer who enjoys RPGs. This is for the hardcore gaming fans who want to spend hours agonizing over points spent in skill and character development, only to find that you have to start over because you lack core abilities in your characters to survive. Further, the combat system is ridiculous. You get a wizard at the beginning of the game as a companion who has an ~80% accuracy range - however, in my experience, his spellcasting is weak at best, and backfires most of the time, and at often critical moments. Unfortunately, healing is also problematic because it uses an entire action (turn), and so by the next round, you may be down more health points than you were before you healed. Following me so far? That's good, because on top of that, you can count on being outnumbered and outmaneuvered in nearly every battle. 

I could go on to wax poetic about the ineptitude of the combat system and the way the developers correlated character development with combat in a way that is clear, but I think you can get the gist of it from above. I have to quit playing this game because after too much time trying the same battle over and over again to rescue some baroness who loves the less than useless wizard companion I have, I am going to retire this game entirely and quite playing it. It simply lacks any enjoyment for me at this point. I think the game designers have a lot of work to do to create a product that I would ever consider purchasing again. I feel cheated of my money and my time. 

Oh, and you don't have the option of really grinding your characters up to par, either. There are a set number of quests and side quests, and you spend those character development points at your own risk.

Good:
-Amazing character development using a deep system of random dice rolls and old-school board game elements
-Hard battles (some are pushovers) that make you think or have to re-do because of a single screw up
-Deep turn based hexagonal board-like combat involving traps and the environment
-A Baldur's Gate style of map minus the exploration
-The game really focuses on the battles without the fuss of wandering and exploring (ie. not an exploration game)

Bad:
-The story is not bad, but one shouldn't be getting this game for that reason
-The itemization and game mechanics are a bit complicated to understand and required a lot of Google searching
-Linear story and no exploration

If you are looking for a game that focuses purely on the tactical turn based combat, then this is truly it.  There is no wandering and exploring with your party and discovering secrets.  The world map is like Baldur's Gate, however, when you visit cities and places, you are either transported into a combat situation with some cutscenes or visit a town where NPC's are static screens filled with innkeepers, healers, merchants, etc.",1462851003,1462851003,True,14,0,0.630988121032714844,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Don't bother getting attached to characters or strategically saving points to spend on a worthwhile skill.  You can lose them without any notice, having wasted opportunities to use those points to get you through certain battles.  Cardinal error.

The voiceacting is actually pretty welldone. I was suprised. The art is decent, the story thus far is very predictable, but still enjoyable. There's lots of side quests you can complete. It seems to be a good idea to do them, just to get the experience and the points to spend on spells, and abilities. Makes the game a little easier, and allows for more battle options. 

I'm not a fan of the buying system. There's seems to be a limited number of arrows. After buying all of them in a shop, it seems they don't restock. I've come back to shops after many battles to see if they resupply, but it doesn't seem they do. The potion prices are rediculous. Though you shouldn't need them very often. 

There is a little bit of a freedom  aspect. At a certain point you can choose where you want to go, and dialog options give you different results. You can choose which side to be on in some battles.

I don't understand why game developers think that RNG and setting the odds against you makes a game fun.  If you enjoy loading over and over again until you get a perfect roll and get the scenario down perfect is fun than this is the game for you!

The graphics are mediocre, they characters look mediocre and no way to customize, the classes are mediocre and you don't gain enough skill points to keep up with the difficulty curve.

The game is linear, offering no real exploration.  Just move from one scenario to another.  One scenario will be easy the next not to bad and than they throw one at you that you have to reload over and over again until you get lucky.  No skill involved, just luck on RNG.  This game gets the terrible reviews it deserves.

I am in the second chapter stuck on fighting the ""newcomer"" gladiators.  They split your group into 2 groups.  So if you didn't choose a warrior in the beginning you will be stuck fighting 2 ranged against a tank and range setup, which is painful.  There is making the game difficult and then there is making it silly just to extend the life of the game.  I will try to finish the game and see but my will to continue is slowly dwindling, I am beginning to think that this company doesn't know how to make games.

OK Made it past that point, now I am to a part in the gladiator games where they throw 3 waves of enemies at you without any rest.  This really is some of the worst game design I have had the misfortune in playing.  You get no breaks, no way to bind your wounds... nothing.  I made it to the 8th wave and there is an instant win button the enemies can do that you have no way of stopping.  It is completely random.

확실히 취향을 탈만한 게임이네요.  턴제+전략+알피지 라는 취향만 맞는다면 즐길 수 있지 않을까...

물론 게임이 결함이 좀 있기는 합니다.

설명이 친절한듯 불친절해요. 주로 함정에서 그런데, 새로 등장한 함정이나 장치가 있다면 그에 대한 설명이 좀 동반되어야 할텐데 그런게 있다가 없다가 합니다. 그래서 어떤 미션은 실패하고 재도전하면서 익혀야해요. 특히 2장 아레나에서 악어 등장하는 미션... (악어가 고기를 5개 이상 먹으면 실패라고 미리 알려줘야지!)

난이도가 제법 있습니다. 특히 초반에 AP(경험치)를 계획적으로 잘 분배해야지 이것저것 찍다보면 상당히 힘들어집니다. 이게 동료 선택 폭이 완전히 없다는 점과 겹쳐서 상당히 빠듯하고 스트레스를 줍니다. 다양한 파티를 꾸려볼 여지 없이 최적화만 생각하게 되어버렸어요.

게임진행 디자인이 썩 좋진 않아요. 동료도 정해진 대로 고정이고, 장비도 다양한 편이 아니고, 특히 2장 같은 경우는 좀 당황스럽죠. 자세한 건 스포일러일테니 말하지 않겠지만, 하여간 여러모로 체감 난이도가 급상승합니다. 

최적화도 상당히 안 좋죠. 딱히 좋은 그래픽도 아닌데 프레임 드랍이 들쭉날쭉 합니다. 그리고 이동할 때마다 로딩은 왜 그렇게 하는지. 전투 맵이야 그렇다쳐도 도시는 그냥 고정 화면인데 왜 그렇게 로딩화면까지 보여줘야하는지 납득이 안 갑니다. 

스토리는 후반부에 힘이 빠집니다. 결말로 갈수록 그냥 진행을 위한 진행이 되어버려요. 특히 엔딩은 일정에 쫓겨 대충 만들었다는 느낌이 팍팍 들어요. 

이것저것 까는 말들을 많이 했지만, 그래도 재미있게 했습니다. 확률 문제로 여러 말들이 있긴 한데, 그건 엑스컴도 그랬고 딱히 불합리한 수준까진 아니라고 생각했습니다. 물론 95%가 빗나갈 때 빡치긴 하겠지만.... 5%도 확률은 확률이니까요.....

사이드 퀘스트들도 제법 많고 전투맵들도 아기자기하면서 재밌습니다. 맵 재탕이 없고 단순한 섬멸전 외에 여러 자잘한 승리목표가 있는 미션도 꽤 있어서 전투가 지루하지 않아요. 하긴 전투가 지루하면 이런 게임으로선 빵점이겠지만요.

배우들 보이스액팅도 만족스러웠습니다. 캐릭터들의 개성이 확실히 살아있어서 그걸 보는 맛이 있어요. 무법자 주인공들의 블랙코미디스러운 에피소드들이 많습니다.
여튼 한동안 푹 빠져서 했습니다.

[list]
[*]Сюжет. Цілком цікавий, хоч і не розкрита повністю історія, крізь яку нас проводять сценками з діалогами героїв. Озвучено гру чудово. Актори та автори текстів зробили героїв живими. Кожен з них має свої погляди та переконання.

[*]Битви. 
[list]
[*]Поля бою. Не дарма в описі до гри написано, що ""You will discover over 180 unique hex-based battlegrounds within a dark"". Полей бою не рахував, але однакових не зустрічав точно, окрім тих, де цього вимагав сюжет. Кожне поле бою унікальне. Це не просто набір однакових полів з пересунутими перешкодами. Велика кількість полів містить унікальні механіки, що як допомагають в бою, так і ускладнюють його.

[*]Складність та механіка. Майже кожен бій приносить сюрпризи. Ви не можете бути впевнені на всі 100% чи переможете. Механіка бою і взагалі гри проста і викладена в правилах до гри, які можна прочитати будь-коли. 
[/list]

[*]Предмети та інвентар. Подобається, що в грі немає обладунків, зброї тощо, які кардинально міняють параметри героя. В цій грі ваш герой (його характеристики та навички) відіграють головну роль, а не ""Меч тисячі істин"" з +200 до всіх характеристик, як це дуже поширено серед РПГ, а особливо ММО.

[*]Прокачка. В грі немає рівнів героя, а є Бали Пригод, які треба вкладати в героя. Доволі цікавий підхід.
Також в грі не треба вбивати 20 млн кабанів аби набити потрібний рівень. Тут просто немає прокачки монстрах в лісі. Всі битви пов'язані із завданнями. Нескінченну кількість разів можна битися лише на арені в Менґбіллі, та й то остання битва арени (лише її можна проходити повторно) вже не дає досвіду (Балів Пригод), а лише трохи грошей.

[*]Інше. 
Гра має гарне музичне супроводження та пристойну графічну складову. 
Хоча вам й не доведеться бігати ігровими локаціями, як це в більшості ігор, складається враження, що світ доволі великий.

When I heard about a tactic turn-based strategy game, about some blackguards (that promised some bad guys doing bad things!) with RPG elements, and I saw the game was in my steam library, I said: ""Yes!""
But... that was a big mistake.

The story of the game has a good start: A mystery. A murder. Are you guilty? Are you innocent? If you are innocent, who is the true murderer? Why can't you remember nothing?
And with that, you get out of prison to live some adventures.
The characters are charismatic and with personalities of their own. The world is full of life, but most of the secondary missions are only valuable for the Adventure Points (the XP of the game), and they are irrelevant to the story.

The game has a few plot twists and they are not bad at all, but before reaching them you will probably exhausted. The problem is that the ending is... well... is HORRIBLE. It is the ending that you can expect, but is displayed in a really awful and strange way that makes you think: ""I really finished this game to see this?""

The gameplay is good in the beginning, but when you are more or less mid-game you will probably be sick of being poisoned. And that's only the start: The machine abuses the use of poisons. You will probably hear every turn ""Poison!"" or ""I am poisoned!"" or ""I hate poison"". Also, some special combats in Act 5 are never explained why are this special or why the special rules.

As many other tactic turn-based games, probabilities are really important. That means you can have a lucky day and impact an almost impossible shoot, or a really unlucky and fail all your 98% chance spells. But, as always, it seems ""50%"" means ""1/2"" to me and ""1/10"" to machine, as I never impacted an attack under 20% and usually failed things of 70-80%, 95% or even 98%. In a game where every movement, every action counts, this can make you sick really fast. Also, the enemies are as if they were taken out of Matrix, because they can dodge easily and usually all your attacks.

So, well, unless you really want to be poisoned EVERY combat, lose your patience failing your 98% chance spells and being parried attacks that shouldn't be parried, and playing a lot of hours to receive a half-cooked last Act with a fast ending as closure, you probably shouldn't play this game.",1459707878,1459707878,False,34,3,0.75349724292755127,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Este juego es para ir muy poco a poco. No entrare en detalles sobre él más alla de lo que ya pueden explicar en los demás posts.

DEBES GRABAR CONTINUAMENTE LAS PARTIDAS o por lo contrario te vas a dar con un canto en los dientes.

Llevar horas de juego intentando pasarte la dichosa batalla, y por fin, cuando te has relajado y piensas ""vale, voy a la ciudad a curarme y grabar""... zas!! te salta en la pantalla una nueva batalla que te endosan porque la historia lo dice así... y Oh SORPRESA! Empiezas el combate con la vida tal y como acabó la última, o sea, a mínimos ¬¬
Eso supone que es una batalla que no vas a poder ganar nunca, pq al primer golpe mueres. Y no da ninguna opción a situarte antes de esa batalla. Simplemente te da la opción de ""intentar de nuevo?"" Y si te piensas que los autosave te van a salvar el culo, lo tienes claro. A empezar el juego desde 0

Por eso, o se está grabando continuamente, o juega en una habitación sin ventanas. Por lo que pueda ser.

An und für sich kein schlechtes Spiel, allerdings haben hier dieses Mal die Negativpunkte so stark überwogen, dass auch das gute KS sowie Skillsystem nix mehr retten konnten.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Das Gameplay der Oberwelt ist simpel gehalten. Zu simpel. Man hat eine Weltkarte, auf der gibt es Orte, die man anklickt, und man gelangt dann ziemlich zügig an den gewählten Ort. In der Stadtansicht hat man dann einen Bildschirm, auf dem alle relevanten NPCs zu sehen sind, also Händler, heiler, Taverne etc. Abseits der Kämpfe spielt sich das Spiel wie ein Point´n Klick Adventure. Für ein Spiel der Marke ""Das Schwarze Auge"" meiner Meinung nach keine gute Eigenschaft, auch wenn Laufwege zu den Orten wegfallen. Zu einem zumpftigen RPG gehört es dazu, dass man was zum erkunden hat. Die Dungeons kann man lediglich mit gutem Willen als solche bezeichnen, denn wie auf der Oberwelt klickt man sich hier von Ort zu ort bzw von Kampf zu Kampf. Leider unspektakulär.

Eine der Stärken des Spiels ist das Skillsystem, das erfreulichwerweise ein beinahe klassenloses skillen ermöglicht.
""Beinahe"", weil immernoch zwischen magiebegabten und eben solchen ohne Magiebegabung unterschieden wird, Wie in Spielen des schwarzen Auges üblich, verteilt man Abenteuerpunkte, die man bekommt, wenn man Quests löst oder Kämpfe gewinnt auf die unterschiedlichen Statuspunkte und Talente, die auf diesen Statuspunkten aufbauen. Planvolles Skillen ist hier schon zu Beginn angesagt, da es im Spiel nur begrenzt viele Kämpfe und damit Abenteuerpunkte gibt.
Ein Feature, das gut umgesetzt wurde, wie ich denke.

Ein weiterer Punkt sind die Kämpfe, die auch großteils gut gelungen sind. Kampffelder haben oft Möglichkeiten, Gegner auf unkonventionelle weise auszuschalten wie zum Beispiel durch enflammen brennbaren Sumpfgases. Mir persönlich haben die Kämpfe viel Spaß gemacht, außer gegen Ende im letzten Dungeon, der eigentlich aus zwei Dungeons besteht in denen es wenn ich mich recht erinnere 15 Pflichtkämpfe gab, die zwar nicht alle schlecht aber eben auch nicht alle gut waren. An der Stelle habe ich lange gesessen, weil einfach die Motivation fehlte, weiter zu machen in dem Wissen, dass noch einige folgen.

[b]Interface[/b]
Der Questlog ist leider mitunter wenig hilfreichg gewesen, da zum Teil zwar erwähnt wurde, zu wem man muss, aber nicht wo er ist, was bei einer großen Welt mit einem guten dutzend betretbaren Orten echt frusten kann, vorallem wenn man eine Quest bekommt, die man erst lösen kann, wenn man eine andere gelöst hat, die man eben noch nicht gelöst hat, was wie ich denke ein Bug ist, aber dennoch ärgerlich.

Im Ausrüstungsinterface der Charaktere wird nur die Behinderung durch zu schweres Gepäck angezeigt, aber nicht die durch die Ausrüstung.

Das Schriftbild ändert sich, wenn man einen anderen Schwierigkeitsgrad auswählt. Wirkt komisch und dadurch können sich Wörter überlagern, was wirklich nicht schön aussieht.

Even if you buy Blackguards on sale, you likely still won't find the time to sit down with it.  There just isn't any single thing exciting enough to make up for the blandness of the rest of the game.  Nothing to draw you back in, after the first time you've played.

It's well done from a mechanical standpoint - The skill trees are well thought out and balanced.  There's just nothing flashy in them to draw attention, and the execution becomes poor when you see your character dully performing their moves and abilities with passable graphics and poor weapons/equipment.

More of a visualisation of some DM's real-world tabletop setup that would seem much cooler set up with cardboard on your buddy's gaming table.

Blackguards jest to gra cRPG rozgrywana turowo (chodzi o walki rzecz jasna). Podróżujemy od miasta do miasta po fajnie rysowanej mapie świata. Jak łatwo się domyślić w miasta rozmawiamy z NPC, kupujemy, sprzedajemy sprzęty oraz podejmujemy się zadań. Walcząc zdobywamy punkty za które rozwijamy postaci oraz zagłębiamy się w mroczny świat. To tak z grubsza. A tak bardziej szczegółowy?

Ogólnie klimat gry jest mroczny i ponury. Sam świat jak i postaci są zwykłe, przeciętne, posiadające wady i zalety. Zdecydowanie nie jest to heroic fantasy w którym mamy bohatera w lśniącej zbroi rozwalającej całe zło świata. Ale to akurat uważam za duży plus tej gry. Dzięki temu jest bardziej realistyczna. 

Wcielamy się w postać skazaną za morderstwo, którego podobno dokonał (morderstwo jest owiane tajemnicą, którą mamy rozwikłać jak można się domyślić), której jednak udaje się uciec z więzienia i zabiera ze sobą dwójkę współwięźniów. Krasnoluda-wojownika ogarniętego żądzą polowania na smoka oraz człowieka-maga rozkochującego w sobie niewiasty. Jak więc wspomniałem widać, że nie jest to gra standardowa gdzie dostajemy widealizowanych rycerzy tylko zwykłą bandę rzezimieszków próbujących uratować własny tyłek oraz rozwikłać zagadkową sytuację, która wciągnęła ich w całą tą sytuację.

W grze podejmuje się dużo decyzji. Fajne jest to, że nie ma decyzji dobrych i złych. W sumie zazwyczaj jest to wybór mniejszego zła. To, że się zlitujemy nad złym rządcą owocuje głównie tym, że ściga nas dalej.

Co najbardziej odcisnęło mi się na psychice i z czym kojarzyć będę tą grę? To opcje rozwoju postaci. Jest on całkiem złożony. Mam wrażenie, że dla osób nie grających w prawdziwe RPG (czy bardziej rozbudowane cRPG) może nawet zbyt złożony na początku co może ich zniechęcić do gry. Jak to tutaj działa? Otóż w innych grach zdobywa się poziomy i dodaje umiejętności w zależności od tego poziomu. Blacguards za wykonywanie zadań oraz walkę daje każdej postaci konkretną ilość punktów. A za punkty kupujemy konkretne umiejętności lub atrybuty. Każdy kolejny poziom umiejętności kosztuje inną kwotę. Tak więc trzeba kalkulować czy lepiej kupić jedną lepszą umiejętność czy może dwie tańsze ale słabsze. Postaci posiadają kilka zakładek rozwoju. Są to: 
- atrybuty główne (siła, żywotność)
- umiejętności bojowe (walka mieczem, bronią obuchową)
- umiejętności (unik, silne uderzenie)
- czary (kula ognia)
- specjalne zdolności (przetrwanie, leczenie ran). 

W którymś momencie człowiek zaczyna się w tym gubić. Chce się leczyć i nie wie czy korzystać z czaru, specjalnej zdolności czy może zwykłej umiejętności. Do niektórych umiejętności opisy są skromne i gracz nie ma pewności co mu to da. Podczas jednej z rozgrywek 3-4 minuty szukałem co mam rozwijać żeby mój bohater zaczął wreszcie trafiać przeciwników. Czy zwinność czy zręczność czy jakiś skill odpowiedzialny za uderzenie. Po dłuższym pograniu można zacząć się z grubsza orientować co jest do czego ale na początku użytkownik musi trochę popracować mózgownicą (aż para leci z uszu). Jak więc widzimy mnogość opcji rozwoju daje nam możliwość stworzenia postaci bardzo wyspecjalizowanej w konkretnej gałęzi sztuki wojennej takiej jak miecze dwuręczne, czarnoksięstwo czy sztylety. Jednak potrzeba czasu aby wpaść na to jak to zrobić i zrozumieć tą mechanikę. Zdarza się, że nie zawsze opisy mówią nam dokładnie czym dana umiejętność lub czar jest. Pamiętam jak dostałem księgę, która mogła nauczyć mojego czarodzieja nowego czaru jednak opis czaru był tak niewielki, że nie wiedziałem co w sumie mój wizzard będzie potrafił. Skończyło się na skorzystaniu z księgi i zdobyciu czaru, którego nigdy nie wykorzystałem.

Należy ponownie podkreślić, że jest to gra tworzona na podstawie systemu RPG. Co to oznacza? Że większość statystyk jest określana w pseudo rzucie kostką. Przykład? Wielkość obrażeń może być określona jako 1D6+2. Czyli rzut kością sześcienną plus zawsze 2 punkty co daje nam od 3 do 8 obrażeń. Wszystkie akcje mamy określone procentowo. Procent trafienia mieczem, procent rzucenia czaru. Tak więc można stwierdzić, że często powodzenie jakieś akcji to po prostu loteria.

Co do skilli to jeszcze jedna dodatkowa informacja. Aby zdobyć nowe, trzeba znaleźć nauczyciela, który nas tego nauczy. Nauczycie są rozsiani po wielu miastach w których się pojawimy. Do kupna tych skilli oczywiście wykorzystujemy zdobyte punktu.

Co jest najważniejsze w grze poza rozwojem postaci i zagłębianiem się w fabułę? Oczywiście walki. Te są na prawdę klimatyczne. Podczas walk mamy planszę usianą heksami i to po nich poruszają się postaci. Oczywiście jak przystało na prawdziwego cRPG walki są bardzo rozbudowane. Każda postać ma inne bronie, inne współczynniki ruchu, ataku itd. Postać posiadająca włócznie możne stać dwa pola od celu i ją zaatakować. Jeżeli między nią, a wrogiem stoi krasnolud to można atakować bo krasnolud jest niski. Jeżeli stoi tam człowiek czy elf to ataku nie wykonamy. Podczas walk znajdziemy sporo interaktywnych rzeczy co dodaje fajnego smaczku. Mogą to być skrzynie, które można wywalać grodząc drogę sobie i przeciwnikom. Może to być świecznik, który możemy spuścić na wrogów. Podczas jednej z pierwszej walk, musimy na cmentarzu zakryć otwory przez które wyłazi robactwo i nas atakuje. Podczas oblężenia miasta było widać wielki skrzydlaty cień krążący po mapie. Tam gdzie się zatrzymał, w kolejnej turze spadał wielki głaz. Na mapie też może pojawić się np. strumień. Postać próbująca go przejść może się wywalić (oczywiście od tego są odpowiednie statystyki postaci) co oczywiście marnuje jej turę. Dzięki temu gracz może obudzić w sobie Sun Tzu i pokazać jaki z niego jest taktyk, a dodatkowo każda walka nie wygląda jak klon poprzedniej. Sama walka jest bardzo intuicyjna i mega przyjemna. Mapy same w sobie są nieduże ale to nie jest żaden problem. Na dole ekranu widzimy kolejność w jakiej postaci będą wykonywać swój ruch, a przy avatarach postaci widzimy nałożone bonusy tak pozytywne jak i negatywne. Dodatkowy pasek skrótów, który możemy ustawiać wedle własnego uznania jest już chyba standardem ale cieszy mnie to, że tutaj ten standard zachowano. Ułatwia to dostęp do skilli oraz mikstur. Klikając prawym przyciskiem myszy otrzymujemy menu na bazie koła umożliwiające odpalanie skillów, ataków, korzystanie z rzeczy umiejscowionych w pasie (broń rzucana, eliksiry, pułapki) postaci czy kończenia rudny. Bardzo fajna sprawa choć każda ikonka wygląda tak podobnie, że bywają mało czytelnie i też trzeba się do nich przyzwyczaić.

Co do ekwipunku. Zbroje, topory, miecze, szable, zbroje zbierane w zestawy. No to oczywiście jest rozbudowane jak na prawdziwą grę cRPG przystało. Chociaż jak na początku znalazłem dobry miecz dwuręczny to przez dłużą część gry nie znalazłem nic lepszego czy porównywalnego.

Reasumując Blackguard jest grą solidną i klimatyczną. Poziom skomplikowania mechanizmu może zniechęcić osoby, które nigdy wcześniej nie grały w gry tego typu. Jednak jeżeli przetrzymają pierwszą falę zniechęcenia to ukaże im się na prawdę ciekawa gra o intrygującej fabule i wielu możliwościach zarządzania postaciami oraz walkami.

Wady:
- duża złożoność kreowania postaci pozwala na tworzenie bardzo wyspecjalizowanych postaci
- klimat prawdziwego RPGa
- przyjemna grafika i dźwięki

Zalety:
- czasem opisy umiejętności nie są wystarczające i człowiek szuka w pomocy co one robią lub po prostu je kupuje i testuje
- złożoność mechanizmów gry może zniechęcić niektórych

I personally found the story to be interesting and engaging, it's dark in places and you need to get your hands dirty, but that's how Dark Eye fantasy generally is. One moment in particular seems to have turned some players off, I thought it was a brave decision by the developers, and I thought it worked well, a story should generate emotion, and this one did. It's not all grim and dark however, and the humour is very finely tuned in places. 

Turn based tactical games are a genre that I'm very much into, I play a lot of Chaos Reborn on a daily basis for the PvP side of it. Consequentially I often find that with story driven turn based tactical games that the PvE battles are a let-down, I don't think an AI can generally replicate the engagement that comes from playing against a human opponent. But I tell you what, Blackguards comes as close to it as I've ever found. There's a real wealth of variation in the battles that occur from; small skirmishes, arena fights, fighting withdraws, chase downs, there's all sorts. The developers of Blackguards have really gone out of their way to keep the fighting fresh. As a result this is one story driven turn based tactical game that I can see myself replaying. Just taken on their own the fights are a lot of fun.

I think the one caveat that I'd give is that this is a game where it's worth checking out what happens to certain characters in advance. I’m not going to give anyway any spoilers here, but making your party build based on that knowledge does make a difference to the overall effectiveness of your party by the end of the game.",1458389671,1458389671,True,17,0,0.656777799129486084,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Diese ist unterentwickelt - dadurch mußten die Computergegner so stark gemecht werden, diese einfach und schnell den Kampf gewinnen.

ABER:
Wenn die Gegner jeden Kampf gewinnen, gibt es doch gar keinen Anreiz das Spiel  zu spielen?

Das stimmt, aber hier kommt nun der Zufall ins Spiel. Obwohl die Computergegner betrügen können man gegen sie gewinnen - alles was macht braucht in ein Kampf bei dem der Zufall bessere ""Würfel"" auf der eigenen Seite und (!) schlechte ""Würfel"" auf der Computerseite hat.

Wenn beide Seiten gute ""Würfel"" haben, dann verliert man - einfach weil die  Computer NPC so extrem stärker gemacht wurden als die Spieler figuren.  Von den 4 Konstellationen gewint also nur eine - das heißt das man Kämpfe 10-30x durchspielen muss bis die richtige Konstellation da ist - dies gilt vor allem in den frühen Leveln wo man einfach zu schlecht ist, um den Kampf mit geschickten Aktionen zu gewinnen.

Das dies ""suboptimal"" ist, hat man wohl bei D. erkannt und ""interaktive"" Dinge in die Kampf-Map eingefüht, die die NPC etwas abbremsen können - FALLS diese zufällig in der Nähe stehen - klappt also relativ selten. Selberverständlich werden diese Elemente nicht erklärt und man braucht einen Kampfversuch (von den 10-30 die sowieso nötig sind) um rauszufinden, was das ""Ding"" nun macht.

Ich hätte nie gedacht, eine negative Rezension für ein DSA Spiel abzugeben aber es ist einfach zu schlecht umgesetzt - zu Spielbeginn ist es einfach zu langweilig dauernd den Kampf neustarten zu müssen (einfach weil schon in der 1 Kampfrunde die hälfte deiner NPCs nicht getroffen haben, während der Gegner (die immer in Überzahl sind) alle Treffer gelandet haben und dabei sogar einige Crits dabei waren.

Ich hoffe D. investiert mehr Zeit in die Entwicklung der Computer AI so das die Kämpfe nicht durch ""Betrügen"" des Computers spannend gemacht werden MÜSSEN.

Bardzo dużym plusem dla twórców jest dostępna na Steamie zupełnie za darmo wersja demo gry. Nie jest to bynajmniej demo na 20-30min zabawy, a na dużo dłużej! Niektóre nowe produkcje są krótsze niż wersja demonstracyjna Blackguards ;).

I wouldn't recommend it based off of my standards for games but others might still find it enjoyable.

Cons
Terrible story ( Confusing, presents a lot of questions but gives few answers. Main character seems like a loser)
Flat characters, characters seem to blurt out whatever is in their head instead of talking to each other
Plot twists are in poor taste (They come of as 'we did this to you because we can')
Somewhat steep learning curve when it comes to training your characters
Weapon system seems biased in the sense that there is little to no benefit to pick x over y in any scenerio
Game consistantly pushes you back to square one by taking your gear/characters away from you and forcing you to fight at a severe disadvantage

Pros
Characters are customizable in their fighting style, although non mages have a limited non passive special talent selection.
Difficult (although for the wrong reasons imo)
Tactical turnbased game
Bug free from what I have seen.

If you are a diehard fan of tactical turn based games and do not care about story elements then this game might interest you. I would recommend watching youtube videos first before committing or wait for it to go on sale.

But, also, not that the difficulty setting thing means that, when you finally have to switch back to normal to kill the gators with your incorrectly min/maxed character build, you might have to make the disgusting decision to set it to easy...  which I know a lot of gamers like me just cannot fathom, lol.

- Good voice acting nearly throughout - only a few weaker performances. The main heroes and villains are all voiced very well. 
- Some great characters, such as Zuraban, the womanising socialite, Niam, the drug-addicted lost soul or the gold-loving dwarf. These may be fantasy archetypes, but the interaction between them often takes you to new territory, and is often funny. 
- Fairly deep (but not TOO complicated!) skill tree and leveling up system.  
- Good turn-based combat, and challenging if played on Hard. 

The only criticism I have so far is that there seem to be just a few areas that are a little unpolished - for example, you can skill up you 'traps' detection and disarming ability, only to discover that there is no actual mechanic to allow you to disarm traps.

The overall mechanics of the game are very familiar. Collect experience (action points) and use it to buy upgrades to your character. The battles are all turn based so you essentially get a number of action points per turn with which to move your character and perform a single action.

This game is like... Being stuck with a Dungeon Master that won't adapt to anything you do, and force you to continue on the path it set for you- even if you don't like it.

Usually, when I play a T-RPG, I'll find something that work, blast through the story once to get the pacing right, and then play it again in a harder mode and take my time. Well... it is not possible in this game, and to tell the truth, the story isn't good enough to justify that I ever finish it. 

Let me tell you : You'll not get it right on your first try. 
The game will take away things you put a lot of effort into without you having a say in it.
You'll have to start the game over, or read a guide to make sure you plan your characters correctly. 
You'll have to use these damn consumable I hate to use, put your points in these damn debuff I hate to use.

In short, if you like to play your own way or feel strong, this game is not for you.

  Blackguards strength is easily its combat. Difficulty of encounters is not determined by the number of enemies nor the amount of hp they have but by the types of enemies and the environmental hazards on the map. Hell, even increasing the difficulty actually makes the AI smarter instead of having cheap mechanics like OHKOs.

PROLOGUE: I show as having 88 hours playing this game, as of this review.  I probably actually was playing for 80 hours of that, for ONE playthrough. I am methodical and slow, so most of you whippersnappers who like to cut to the chase will likely finish in 40 hours or less.  I saw a lot of complaints about this game having spikes of frustratingly high difficulty, so I played the EASY/NOVICE setting, which I believe gives more Adventure Points (AP) than the other settings.  In retrospect, I can understand the complaints; but I never had that problem, maybe because of the easy setting, maybe for the most part because I pushed off what I suspected would be the tougher fights until I had more skills under my party's belts.  I ended the game with 1300 ducats (enough to ditch EVERYTHING the party needed and buy it all back again), lots of poisons, potions, provisions, projectiles, traps, and other stuff I never seemed to have the need to use.  I used one potion, and that in the second to last battle.  Perhaps on NORMAL difficulty I would have needed more...

REVIEW:  This game has a main storyline which is fairly linear, but the available sidequests (and locations they open) make it feel less so.  The RPG character development system is versatile and refreshing: You can mold your characters by earning and using AP to buy levels in any of a myriad of basic traits, talents, weapon talents, special abilities, and (for magic users) spells.  You get AP by fighting battles and completing quests.  You do not get enough AP to turn your characters into super heros; but, if you do most of the sidequests, you will get enough to make them excellent in their chosen specialty (magic, melee, ranged) and solid in a second specialty and/or support.  One word of caution: this is not the game for those who want to destroy waves of hapless foes with giant fire or frost balls.  Using magic to buff teammates (and/or debuff enemies) will carry the day. 

There are approximately 180 fights available in the game, for those who wish to seek them all out, with plenty of tactical variety and some light ""in-fight"" puzzle solving.  In all but a few cases, the game clues you in to what is needed to make a fight easier.  For those few where they fall short, there is the internet: I used it about six times.  There were about three fights I elected to replay because I failed or did not like the outcome.  All in all, I found the combat to be satisfying.

Some have complained of running out of ammo (the shops do not re-stock arrows and bolts); but I ran two archers and one crossbow, and did not come close to running out.  I think someone relied too heavily on ""triple shot"" and ""rain of arrows,"" which skills none of my characters learned.

The storyline is nothing to write home about; and the ending cutscenes/wrap-up is lackluster.  But the character voice acting, approriate interjection of humor, and plot intrigue that is played out was, in my opinion, quite well done.

Replay value is modest.  The plot twists and intrigue are a lot of what pulled me along the first time.  Your party characters are a mandatory set of (up to) five characters, only one of which you get to roll from scratch, and even HIM not entirely (name, gender and appearance are all set for you).  After almost 90 hours on record for my first run, another one (this time on NORMAL) will have to wait until I am up for it.  But, for the pittance I paid for the game (got it on a deep, DEEP discount), one run was overwhemingly worth the price!

EPILOGUE / HINTS (which some might consider slightly spoilerish, but I will not give away plot.)
-- Screw the game's advice:  Roll your own character from scratch the first time.  It is almost impossible to fail if you buy in as a magic user and start him out good at SOMETHING.
-- Take magic, unless you are dead set on a heavy melee fighter.  the 500 AP cost might seem like a lot, but it is a pittance over the course of the game, compared to the advantages it gives.
-- Continuing this line of thought, a dedicated heavy melee fighter is probably not the best choice, as you will eventually end up having two excellent ones foisted upon you.  You will be much better served with a magic buffer/healer who is good at bows.
-- All your magic users should be good with staffs, or possibly daggers.
-- Study spells carefully before trying to achieve high ranks in them.  For most spells, level 4 is not worth the cost.
-- Hammer Blow (HB), coupled with level 3 ""Standfast Catlike"" buff is OP.
-- The level 3 buff ""Move like Lightning"" (or some name llike that) is OP.
-- A fighter simultaneously buffed with level 3 Lightning and Standfast, and also using HB, is beyond OP for most fights.",1453792915,1453795276,True,7,0,0.570764660835266113,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 * C'est un tactical-RPG (jeu-de-rôle tactique) mâtiné d'ambiance narrative point n'click (le studio Daedalic étant un spécialiste). Le jeu est donc axé sur les combats, en plateau et tour par tour.
* On suit une aventure bien écrite et interprétée (voix anglaises raffinées) qui se déroule d'elle même, sur rail. C'est le piment de l'intrigue qui prévaut sur la liberté. Il n'y a pas de liberté dans Blackguards si ce n'est quelques choix accessoires ou...
* La spécialisation / montée des personnages touffue.
* La gestion millimétrée de l'équipe de persos.
* Une difficulté au rendez-vous, et une aventure conséquente.
* Un déplacement sur plateau/carte de jeu et écrans fixes (ambiance point n'click).
* Une direction artistique relevée. 
* Une certaine nostalgie des jeux à l'ancienne.

Mais si cette liste vous excite, c'est que Blackguards vous attend.

Personnellement, j'ai tout aimé. Le doublage de haute volée, pour qui goûte la subtilité de la v.o anglaise, y fait beaucoup. On appréciera également le fait de pouvoir faire des sessions de jeux courtes (un combat ou deux avant de reprendre la vie réelle). 

Quelques hics... mais très peu.

Le démarrage est assez long; c'est une histoire et un gameplay qui prennent leur temps à se révéler. Soyez patient(e), car ça en vaut la peine. Le prologue est plus long qu'il ne semble mais entrer dans le trip s'avère gratifiant.
L'Oeil Noir, univers de base (dans lequel d'autres softs proposent des baroudes, en RPG ou point n'click) n'est pas très accessible aux novices, ce qui est dommage. De fait, seuls les vieux briscards ayant pratiqué ce jeu-de-rôle reconnaîtront des lieux et divinités d'Aventurie. Les nouveaux se capteront pas grand-chose à ces références, qui ne sont pas du tout explicitées. C'est un peu dommage.
Enfin, il faut accepter d'évoluer dans un jeu sur le mode écran fixe / écran de chargement / plateau de combat / écran de chargement...

2. Difficulty.  The current trend of overly-difficult games is at work here.  I have zero interset in searching forums for tips or reading an online manual to tell me how to play.

3.  Spell failure percentage is WAY too high.  low level spellcasters are useless.
4.  When restarting a battle, there is no way to switch weapons.  Why on earth do some battles begin with enemies on top of you and others across the screen?

[b] Overall Score: 6/10 [/b]

[u] Storyline: (1/2) [/u]
+ Fun dialogues to read between characters.
- Bad storyline (I don't see it going anywhere besides a basic story of the advanture itself).

[u] Graphics: (2/2) [/u]
+ Well designed character models and gears.
+ Good looking battle maps and towns.

[u] Sounds: (2/2) [/u]
+ Voices matching the characters.
+ Good sounds in battlemaps and overall.

[u] Gameplay: (3/4) [/u]
+ Easy and basic training progress to let you understand the game rules and mechanics.
+ Main and Side Quests (Each quest is intresting because it gives rewards and you never know who the enemy is and how many there are).
+ Visit each town and meet Blacksmiths/Healers/Merchants etc.. (Inventory/cash is usefull)
- Difficulties: It's good to have 3 level of difficulties but we need to understand the difference between each one because it feels hard even on Easy for a new player in Blackguards.

[u] RolePlay Elements: (4/7) [/u]
+ Different Classes (Hunter/Mage/Fighter)
+ Rich variety of equippment (Weapons/Armor Sets/Items to use on A.I/self/enemy)
+ Happy Mage (A full page of spells only for the mage)
- Special Moves for other characters (You're able to unlock them with a trainer.. But I'm reaching 15 hours and I still haven't found this 'trainer' yet.
+ Talents : A sweet bonus in this game which let you upgrade each talent form level 1 to 5 and give you it's special effect [see below]
*Knockdown resistance *Animals/Humans stats detector *Healing Effect * Traps detector and more...
+- Stats : There are good sides and bad sides about the stats because in one hand you can match the stats to your liking
if you want a spellcaster archer or a dual wielding warrior but if you don't know what you upgrade to your character you might have a weaker character than you've expected.
- Equippment stats are a bit clumsy.
- Upgrade Points: It takes more time than it should be for a player to think about where to invest his upgrade points.

[u] Combat: (4/5) [/u]
+ Each combat is exciting and makes you eager for the next one.
+ Basic turn-based combat rules/moves but more challenging then other TB games.
+ Usefull Objects : You can throw weapons on the enemy, use/disable traps , use battle objects to move them around or use them against the enemy. You can even hide in the bush from the enemy.
+ Satisfaction : For those 100% players, you will re-do the battle until you get it done the best way you want it to be.
- Frustration : In some battles I felt like my characters are over powered by the enemy. Had to re-try multiply times in different tactics.

To sum it up, I'm enjoying my new Turn Based experience with Blackguards.
It offers an addictive experience throughout the game so I recommend on trying this game if you're an experienced TB gamer.
Don't bother playing this if you're more of a classic TB gamer who doesn't want to focus much on character's stats and RPG elements that might confuse you along the way.

You're more than welcome to also check my screenshots for this game [link below] to see what this game has to offer.

Игра с большим количеством багов, не очень дружелюбный интерфейс, кривая локализация и конечно нет ни какой заявленной стратегии.
Максимум что есть - тактика во время боев, тупой ИИ и несбалансированная система прокачки персов.

Всего два вида персов -маг и воин.
Второй может быть немного лучником.
У мага много заклинаний (ок.50), но 80% из них не применялись. Во время игры использовал 3-5 заклинаний из всего множества.
Промазать при ударе можно и при 100% вероятности попадания, так и несколько раз подряд.

Не советую.

You'll enjoy it if you like that sort of thing.

Blackguards is an old-school gaming experience dressed in modern threads, a pen-and-paper RPG brought to life on the PC. The graphics are appealing, animations smooth, sound effects satisfying and voice acting mostly good. You take the role of an assistant to a noble family who gets into trouble at the outset and goes on the run, and your attempts to unravel what's happened ultimately take on a global significance. The story, chiefly told in cutscenes whose animation is best described as economical, follows a fairly linear path, but a wealth of subplots and sidetracks provides a pleasant illusion of free movement which probably won't convince today's open-world gamers.

Your character is provided with several sidekicks and you marshall and move your party on the world map. Movement is essentially the selection of locations and passage of time is not tracked. In towns and similar locations you'll find traders, trainers, inns, healers, and the like, as well as NPCs who advance the plot and give you quests. Party management is done through the stat sheet and inventory of each character, and true to the RPG that gave birth to this game, the system is satisfyingly deep and complex. Your decisions about character development will win or lose you the game, and new players should take note: it is possible to build a character badly and it's very difficult to undo this once you've done it, so take the time to read the manual and the in-game character creation notes (which don't appear in the manual and are very useful).

Quests and plot advancement almost always involve a skirmish, and it's these hex-map clashes where you'll spend most of your game hours. It's clear that a lot of thought has gone into skirmish map design: in some cases it's a straight fight to the death, but often there are environmental factors to deal with and in some cases the map is a puzzle which you must solve to win. In fact you can think of every skirmish as a puzzle which must be solved, as enemies differ in their capacities and susceptibilities and you must apply the right tools in terms of weapons, spells and equipment to prevail. That said, the game depends ultimately on the roll of the dice, so luck is always a factor. Fortunately death isn't permanent and so long as you have the last man standing, you'll walk away with your party intact.

Some reviewers have complained of the game's excessive difficulty. At the time of writing this review I've completed the game on Normal difficulty and have clocked up over 80 hours of play. I think I saw every skirmish there was to see, well over a hundred in total, and more than half of those I completed first time. There were only a handful I had to attempt more than twice. The final battle is difficult, but so it should be – my only gripe is that the plotting, or perhaps the scriptwriting, feels a bit wrong at the end, but YMMV. If you find yourself stymied by a skirmish, see whether you can go elsewhere to level your party up a bit; if not, it's very likely that you're either missing something important in the skirmish (always check the interactive objects) or you've taken a serious misstep in character building. Be careful not to spread XPs too thin on your characters: you can't take all spells and weapons to the maximum in the course of the game, and you do need some top-level skills and spells by the end if not by the middle.

Two things bothered me about this game: loading times, and the ending. My system isn't top-of-the-line but neither is this game, and I saw far too much of the loading screens for my liking (Mengbilla in particular tried my patience quite a bit). The ending... without spoiling things, I was surprised to see essentially the same cutscene after winning the final battle that I'd seen when I lost it. I'm unsure if your choice in dialogues makes any real difference to the way the game pans out, and online chatter suggests that a lot of players were left confused by the denouement. I can't honestly recommend that anyone other than a genre purist buy this game at full price, but if you see it on sale grab it and give it a try, and be sure to get to the top of the bow skill tree as early as possible!",1452453767,1452453767,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Esta recomendación está dedicada a los roleros y no a los ''para vosotros jugadores xd'', sin embargo parece ser que se tiene que indicar algún tipo de aviso para los jugadores excursionistas. Las quejas no valen, los combates se pueden repetir todas las veces que queramos. Si no se tiene paciencia para repetir y estudiar los combates uno a uno o para aprender desde cero un sistema de reglas y llevarlo a la práctica poco a poco a favor de la estrategia y todo esto con muchos conceptos nuevos y de muchas formas no se recomienda.

Asumimos el control total o global de un grupo en todos los aspectos y factores de la jugabilidad que el juego propiamente ofrece y que a su vez no va a servir para tener una base y un guión sólido, para dar forma a toda una historia con muchas tramas, misiones secundarias y libertad en muchos momentos en forma de visitas por los pueblos.

El juego mezcla momentos de libertad con otros en que nos quedamos sin provisiones, por ejemplo flechas de fuego, para acabar todos los combates, tenemos que, por lo menos, estar siempre al tanto de todas estas cosas realistas como buenas decisiones roleras.

Su ambientación es de los tiempos de Roma: ropas y armaduras, armas... con toque fantástico: magos, druidas, criaturas gigantes...Y un toque Europeo y de Oriente en general: piratas, gladiadores, sables, cocodrilos...

El realismo y detalle imperan sobre la jugabilidad y la parte técnica, sin embargo y entre unas cosas y otras el equilibrio y la jugabilidad parecen no estar afectadas aunque pueda dar la impresión de que si.

No es que merezca una oportunidad, es obligatiro jugar a esta maravilla, más allá de cualquier cosa que no nos guste o aprobemos. Esto es un tipo muy importante de rol y de aquí salen las grandes ideas.

El fuerte está en sus combates y es asombroso ver como estos llegan hasta el límite con los dos bandos rebentandos, momentos tremendos que, a veces, sólo se ven en grandes juegos de estrategia como Starcraft. 

Para colmo goza de una dualidad equilibrada entre ataque y defensas en relacción a todo: nuestro grupo, enemigos, campo de batalla... Es un equilibrio salvaje entre decidir quienes o como se va a defender o atacar, que no sabría muy bien como explicarlo brevemente.

Žánr tahové RPG pro mě byl úplnou novinkou, takže mi chvíli trvalo se ve hře zorientovat. Ale jakmile se člověk sžije s možnostmi vybavení postav, jednotlivými dovednostmi bojovníků a možnostmi soubojů, ta pravá hra začíná.

Souboje jsou dobře hratelné a příběh hráče vtáhne do děje - v každé kapitole hry se příběh čím dál více zamotává, až hráč neví, co si má o ostatních postavách myslet. Rozhodnutí v dialozích se pak stávají oříškem a když už se hráč rozhodne pro nějakou možnost, uvažuje, jakým směrem by se asi dialog ubíral, kdyby zvolil jinak.

Hra sestává z hlavní příběhové linie a velkého množství vedlejších úkolů. Když tedy hráč projde veškeré dostupné lokality a přijme všechny vedlejší úkoly, dohrání zabere přibližně okolo 60 hodin. Přes variace dialogů je ale hlavní příběh zjevně víceméně lineární, neboť musí směřovat k jedinému konci. Pokud ale hráč netrvá na příběhu, hra nabízí vcelku dobrou znovuhratelnost a to hlavně díky různým možnostem profilování postav.

게임시작 전에는,복합적이라는 평가와 몇몇 사람들이 쓴 부정적인 글을 보고 속으로 걱정을 많이 했지만,의외로 무척 재밌던 게임이더군요.

먼저 기본적인 스토리는 주인공이 누명을 쓰고,도망자 생활을 하면서 동행하는 범죄자 친구들과 자신의 누명을 벗고,여기저기서 일어나는 심상치 않은 일들을 조사하면서 진실에 다다르게 됩니다. 남들은 진부하다고 할지 모르지만,저는 무척 재미있게 스토리를 따라갔네요.
 
스토리를 이야기하니,사족을 달자면 전 좀 더 어두운 이야기를 그릴줄 알았지만,상당히 유머러스한 면 도 많은 편입니다.그리고 범죄자 무리라고 했지만 그렇게까지 주인공 일행이 무법자 처럼 행세하진 않습니다.오히려 정의로운 편이고,성격에 약간의 결점이 있다고 보는 편이 맞겠네요.
만약 완전 100%다크한 판타지물을 원하신다면 이 게임은 그렇게 까지 '다크'하진 않다는걸 알아두시기 바랍니다.

그 외에 가장 문제가 되는 점 이라면 아마 사람 환장 하게 만드는 '확률'일겁니다.이 부분은 저도 어떻게 쉴드를 칠수가 없습니다.분명 70%확률로 공격이 들어가야 하는데 느낌은 50%입니다.반대로 말씀하자면,타격 확률이 60%밑 이라면 그 공격은 시도 도안하는게 좋습니다.그냥 한 턴을 날려먹는 결과밖에 안됩니다.

또한,스포일러이긴 한데 동료중에서 엘프궁수가 중간에 끔살당해서 퇴장당합니다.문제는 이걸 아무도 안 알려주며,처음하는 사람은 이후에 일어나는 전투에서 당연히 엿먹을 수 밖에 없습니다.게다가 가면 갈수록 점점 더 원거리 캐릭이 절실한데,궁수가 하나 빠지는 순간부터 제대로 대처하지 않으면 게임 그냥 말아먹는 결과 밖에 되지않습니다.

위에서 말했듯이,이러한 좀 불합리한 게임 플레이가 의외로 많이 나오는 편이니,만약 하실분이라면 멘탈이 좀 튼튼하고,턴제 게임을 좋아하시는 분들에게 추천합니다.
반대로 말씀드리자면,작위적인 느낌의 게임을 원하지 않는다면 비추천 드릴 수밖에 없겠네요.",1451738266,1451738266,True,8,1,0.575326383113861084,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Blackguards storyline is quite enjoyable. I really like the different characters being voiced by different actors (though I'm sure some NPC's have doubled-up).

 I'm glad that players have the option of ""creating"" their character's base stats.


Cons:

 I'm playing on a 2-year-old  Mac and the game crashes frequently. I restart the game, restart the Steam client -- even restart my computer -- and it's still frequently crashing.

 When I'm in the game, occasionally the screen changes colours / views. For example, I'll see lines across the screen (not just the hexes) and sometimes the screen is entirely composed of solid colours. Another time I was playing the game and all the arrows / NPC conversation icons disappeared.

 Maybe these troubles are just due to playing the game on a Mac. If you can pick the game up on sale ($5 or less), then it's worth giving a try. I don't recommend paying full price for what can be a buggy experience.",1451427594,1451427594,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However it can at times be a little punishing and you will find yourself hitting the restart button on quite a few occasions, especially any levels involving poison, to which there seems to be many. In my opinion the mechanic is used maybe a little too much throughout the game and the effects can start to become a little irritating, so spec to counter this when you get a chance. There are a few bugs, but nothing I would consider to be game breaking, so all in all Blackguards is worth the buy, but I would recommend waiting for it to be on sale and avoid the full price.

My opinions won't really add much to the discussion, as they're mixed... like almost everyone else's. Also, I'm farily new to the genre, so the min-maxing aspect present in the attributes and skill-trees in the game don't really appeal to me, yet (mostly how of ignorance, but anyway...).

I really like RPGs in general, but I'm not one to read up on the game's numerous systems to learn what the optimal builds are -- I like to shape my characters as I please, leading to some interesting, fun, but not necessarily good decisions. I've done the same in Blackguards and will admit that, for the [i]most[/i] part, it went alright. I played through Normal mode, and never got truly stuck, which was my biggest worry.

Many people complained about reaching an unbeatable point in the game because they had a sub-optimal build. Maybe they were either playing on Hard, or I've simply been fairly lucky in my decision.

I will say that there were lots of details in the game that I simply did not delve into -- potions (offensive), traps, etc. Those didn't seem all important in any of the battles in Normal.

Anyway. It's tough. Some of the battles were infuriating, missing 3x in a row when I had a 90% chance to hit, having some periods of extended battles that far overstayed their welcome, etc.

But I did enjoy it quite a lot. Until I finished the 3rd Chapter, that is. Then the game offered nothing new.

The game is very linear, although it opens up a bit in the 3rd Chapter, giving you quite a lot of sidequests. The following 2 chapters barely have any of those, which felt strange.
It seems like the focus of the game was only the 3rd chapter, the other ones being mostly to build it up or simply carry the story.

The story was pretty bland, and the sidequests weren't too interesting either. Gameplay-wise, it's almost a pure combat game. You move from battle to battle. Other than battles, you just go to cities to buy equipment/heal/train, and get sidequests. Sidequests simply lead you into more battles. You never explore anything, never really find emergent gameplay or anything of the sort. It's very, very combat focused.

But hey... I really have very little to add that would be in any way meaningful. I want to talk about one thing exclusively -- and that is how opaque the game actually was! It was one of the biggest sources of frustration, for me.


Sometimes, the game pushes you into extended battles. Battle after battle after battle without an opportunity to heal, restock, change equipment, etc. These, of course, are a much bigger challenge -- especially because, if you do poorly on one battle, you'll carry that penalty onto the next one.
These battles felt extremely tense, to me. Sometimes they could go on for 2 hours, even if they were just 2 or 3 battles. The game is very slow paced, and a mistake can cost you quite a lot of time, which is frustrating. And the game often likes to pull tricks on you that it never pointed to. They're unwelcome surprises.

This is one side of it. The other, happened in the end of the game. After the [i]point of no return[/i], you're lead into a serious of battles, but you [b]can[/b] heal and re-equip between them. What you [b]can not[/b] do, is buy anything. Every healing potion, equipment, etc. that you can use is what you've taken with you. 
There were a few problems here -- first, you had no idea how many battles there would be, so you couldn't really judge. Second, what the game showed you was very misleading, by having it spread over 2 ""pages"", but only showing you the first.
Basically, you're expecting x battles, and suddenly, after wasting most of your potions, you're shown that there are actually twice as many. Well, shit.

Thankfully, the game wasn't tricking the player and ramping up the difficulty artifically -- on that second page, there was a healer and merchant that was essentially a safe point. And that was a very nice thing.
The problem is how the game never communicated that beforehand. Every battle I fought felt that much more frustrating because a small mistake seemed like a colossal one. 

Arguably, that the feeling that the game was trying to carry -- I doubt it, though. In this case, it was simply a case of bad communication with the player, it seemed. And similar issues happened throughout the game -- often leading you into ""extended battles"" without warning, and the like.

For me, at least, it's a huge source of frustration, to have to ""judge"" something without information. Especially when mistakes can cost hours.

So yeah. That's basically it. The game is a huge ""tension"" without the ""release""...


Regardless, I enjoyed it. I'm not a hardcore player of the genre, so my appreciation is certainly different. It was a good challenge! There was some frustration with the dice-rolls, but overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tough turn based rpg.",1450655124,1450655145,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,False,False,False,False,,,

A three or four layered pile of stat sheets that serves to slightly improve your chances of besting the RNG gods on a turn by turn basis. With the odds against you.

If you think this is a dark, or pessimistic way to sum the game up, I can tell you that that is actually the nice way of putting it. To the list of gaming sins this game commits you may a redundant and unrewarding item system, the most difficult to navigate skill system I have seen since the sphere grid in final fantasy X (which is mainly out of your reach anyhow, seeing as it depends on trainers which appear at arbitrary points in the story), multiple attempts at large scale battles which quickly descend into long lines of infinitely spawning enemies dog piling on your phalanx of heroes, percent chance failures on pretty much everything that mean any well laid plan can come to a deadly end at any point in your game, and a difficulty curve that pretends all the random the dice wielding percent chance jockeys whom designed the game smashed into every nook and cranny of the game does not exist at all. 

The end result will leave you hitting the (restart battle) button on the second or third turn of each attempted play because your warrior's power attack whiffed, which you immediately realize means you won't be able to kill the enemies quickly enough to keep up with the level. Assuming none of the heals whiff (yes, your heals can whiff to, about 33% of the time in most cases), which is also a death sentence. I could go into the ham fisted attempts at interactive levels, mysterious and all around dumb line fo sight mechanics that let bows shoot a seemingly infinite distance but leash spells at just a few tiles, impossible side objectives, and lack of actual counter play and tactics, but my ranting would fill three pages.

All this is a shame considering the clear level of effort and passion that went into designing the graphics, story line, and characters, who despite being completely archetypical adventures manage to characterize themselves wonderfully though they're well developed connection to the adventure is set in. If half the effort that went into all that were part of the game, this would likely be a tbs to the caliber of dynasty tactics or r-type command. Instead, you have either a slightly better version of fire emblem, or a slightly worse version of final fantasy tactics, both of which are mind bendingly boring and tediously frustrating to begin with. If you enjoy either of those than you richly deserve this.

[b]POSITIVES[/b]

+ Das Schwarze Auge
+ gutes (auch im P&P) unverbrauchtes Setting im Süden von Aventurien
+ gut animierte Gegner (auch wenn Morfus und die Iribaarslilien etwas groß geraten sind)
+ schöne Zaubereffekte
+ sehr gute Soundtracks (insgesamt über 40 Minuten)
+ gute deutsche Sprachausgabe
+ keine strahlende Helden, sondern verbrecherische eher düstere Charaktere mit dem ""Schlächter von Neetha"" in der Hauptrolle (das ist zwar DSA-untypisch, aber ich persönlich bevorzuge böse Rollen)
+ Experten Charakter möglich (aber leider ohne Vor- und Nachteile wie in Drakensang)
+ stimmige Begleiter (Naurim, Niam, Zurbaran, Takate)
+ rundenbasierende tabletopartige Kämpfe die (leider) eindeutig den Fokus des Spiels darstellen
+ gelungene Battlemaps mit interaktiven Objekten und dadurch auch alternative Lösungen
+ keine recycelten Schauplätze
+ spielbare Rückblenden
+ Lehrmeister die einem Sonderfertigkeiten beibringen, die man erst einmal finden muss, bzw. für die man etwas tun muss, bevor die ihre SF mit einem teilen
+ man sieht direkt welche Auswirkungen Eigenschaftssteigerungen haben, bzw. welche Eigenschaft gesteigert werden muss um etwas bestimmtes zu erhöhen
+ schöne Dialoge (siehe aber auch weiter unten)
+ guter Schwierigkeitsgrad (nur stellenweise etwas zu leicht)
+ maximale Traglast
+ viele Waffen und einige davon auch mit Reichweite oder Zusatzwirkungen
+ gutes KI Verhalten der Gegner die gezielt ihre Stärken ausnutzen, Heil- und Zaubertränke nutzen, sich auch mal anderen Charakteren zuwenden und auch ihre Zauber sehr gut einsetzen
+ Kampf gegen Fornunfur
+ Wendepunkt in der Handlung
+ interessante Storry (auch wenn es etwas länger dauert bis diese in Fahrt kommt)
+ etwa 40 Stunden Spielzeit (habe es hauptsächlich mit der DRM-freien Version gespielt außerhalb von Steam)
+ zumindest gefühlt komplett Bugfrei und keinen einzigen Absturz(!) 

[b]NEGATIVES[/b]

- magere Auswahlmöglichkeiten beim Aussehen des Charakters
- nur drei Charakterklassen wählbar (im Normalen Modus)
- blaues Leuchten des Hex-Bodens ist etwas unpassend
- UI wirkt zu modern und lieblos (ein Ringmenü aus Stein oder Metall mit Ornamenten wäre passender)
- zu wenige Talente und Zauber (ich weiss, dass die bisherigen einigen schon zu viel sein mögen, mir jedenfalls nicht)
- Ladebildschirm bei jedem Ortswechsel nervt (auch wenn die Ladezeiten gering sind)
- keine 100%tige Umsetzung der DSA 4.1 Regeln
- Städte nicht begehbar
- keine richtigen Dungeons sondern nur Kampfpunkte zwischen denen man wechseln kann
- RPG Aspekte kommen zu kurz
- zu wenig Antwortmöglichkeiten und kein wirklicher Einfluss
- lineare vorgegebene Story
- wenig Nebenquests
- keine Zufallsbegegnungen auf Reisen (öde Reisen wie in Drakensang) 
- total unstimmiger bläulicher Flammenblitz der anstatt einer Gruppe, Person oder schlichtem rotem Strich (wie in Schicksalsklinge HD) über die Karte rast
- fehlende Ausdauerregel, wodurch viele Kampf SF zu stark sind, da diese beliebig oft einsetzbar sind (ich bin zwar im P&P kein Freund der Ausdauer, aber gerade in einem PC Spiel hätte das gut gepasst, da der Rechner ja die Verwaltungsarbeit übernimmt)
- kein RS Zonensystem
- statt dessen seltsame %tuale Resistenzen gegen gewisse Schadensarten, was zur Folge hat, dass man seine Rüstung nicht richtig einschätzen kann (herkömmlicher RS auf Zonen wäre so viel einfacher und besser gewesen)
- bei den Zaubern in Bezug auf die Wirkung nicht richtig an die P&P Vorlagen gehalten wodurch natürlich große Ungleichgewichte entstehen
- fixe Schadenswerte der Zauber (dadurch am Anfang zu stark und später zu schwach)
- Axxeleratus Blitzgeschwind mit seiner zusätzlichen Aktion ist zu stark; dass man nun die Kosten für diesen Zauber erhöht hat, ändert daran eher wenig
- auch bei den SF wurde sich nicht richtig an die Vorlagen gehalten
- SF Dreifachschuss ist viel zu stark und sollte gestrichen werden, oder legt hier Legolas aus Herr der Ringe persönlich auf (?); diese SF gibt es auch im P&P nicht
- Flankieren oder Angriffe von Hinten (die nicht parierbar sein dürften) haben keine speziellen Auswirkungen
- generell immer noch undurchsichtige und nicht nachvollziehbare Regelmechanik die sich heimlich im Hintergrund verbirgt; die Trefferchancen werden nun zwar angezeigt, aber nicht wie sich diese zusammensetzen (dieser schwerwiegende Punkt zieht sich durch alle Fähigkeiten, Talente und Zauber), ich vermute auch, dass die Regelmechanik nicht wirklich funktioniert, denn die Werte-Angaben und das wirkliche Geschehen unterscheiden sich maßgeblich (vermutlich wird es deshalb verborgen, denn sonst würden noch mehr Unstimmigkeiten auffallen)
- keine sichtbaren KK-Zuschläge, die man sich selbst aus seinem Wege des Schwerts zusammen suchen muss, in der Hoffnung dass wenigstens diese korrekt umgesetzt wurden; man steigert also KK einfach so ohne zu wissen ob man dann einen TP mehr macht (immerhin wird mittlerweile angezeigt wieviele TP durch die hohe KK hinzugekommen sind, aber eben immer noch nicht ab wann für zukünftige KK-Steigerungen)
- MR scheint ohne spürbare Wirkung zu sein, da selbst Naurim mit MR 15 noch versteinert wird
- zu hohe AE Regeneration, da sogar pro KR (ist DSA untypisch), weshalb man seine Zauberkraft auch nicht mal aufspart, daman nach einigen KR eh wieder voll ist
- zu viele Tränke (Heil- und Zaubertränke) im Spiel, die es an jeder Straßenecke zu kaufen gibt, was nicht zu DSA passt, da diese in Aventurien etwas besonderes sind und nicht wie Wasser gesoffen werden (DSA ist kein Diablo)
- keine Alchemie zum selber brauen
- Heilkunde Wunden zu stark (eigentlich heilt man nur die Hälfte seiner TaP*)
- keine Pflanzen und Kräuter (wie in Schicksalsklinge HD)
- seltsame Ingame-Überlandkarte auf der außer den Orten kaum etwas anderes zu erkennen ist; warum hat man hier nicht einfach die sehr detaillieren originalen Karten genutzt?
- Gegner nutzen viel zu häufig Gift, Charaktere sind dadurch andauernd Grün, was sehr störend aussieht
- Korspieß ""Aderlasser"" hat zu schlechte Werte, dafür dass er angeblich aus Schwarzmetall sein soll und zuvor mühevoll aus neun Teilen zusammengesucht werden muss...sehr enttäuschend
- Fallen zum auslegen total unnötig
- Wurfwaffen und zumindest ein Teil der Pfeile/Bolzen nach kämpfen nicht einsammelbar
- keine unterschiedlichen Roben für Magier (!)
- viel zu wenig Rüstungen für Kämpfer (Reiterharnisch ist hässlich und hat unterirdisch falsche BE Werte)
- zu viele Abenteuerpunkte (AP)
- im Nachhinein verschiebbare AT/PA Verteilung (wodurch man nicht planen muss)
- Echsenlehrer im 5. Kapitel, der einfach alles kann (sehr unpassend)
- wenig stimmungsvolles Ende
- kein Widerspielwert 

[b]FAZIT[/b]

Blackguards 1 ist weder gut noch richtig schlecht. Alles was DSAfremd ist, an diesem Spiel, stört mich aber. Warum benutzt man im Kampf Prozentangaben, von denen niemand weiß wie diese zustandekommen, anstatt sich einfach ausschließlich an die guten alten W20 Angaben zu halten - die jeder DSA-Spieler versteht, und auch für DSA-Neulinge gut nachzuvollziehen wären. Die Entwickler von Daedalic haben nicht nur keine Erfahrung mit Rollenspielen, sondern auch kaum Erfahrung mit der Welt und den Regeln von Aventurien, und das merkt man dem Spiel an. Die RPG-Aspekte kommen bei Blackguards viel zu kurz. Im Grunde geht es fast nur von Kampfbildschirm zu Kampfbildschirm, und im Nachfolger wird das noch schlimmer. Ich kann Blackguards 1 nicht wirklich empfehlen, leider.

 Сюжет в данной игре является нелинейным: по ходу игры вы заполучаете или теряете доверие своих компаньонов; устанавливаете с ними дружеский или не очень контакт, и т.д. и т.п. Короче говоря, от ваших действий зависит: кто умрет, а кто выживет.
 Я рыдала, как силстрайдеры в скайриме, когда один из моих компаньонов погиб навсегда. Эту печаль не описать и кучей эпитетов и метафор. Но не будем о моих чувствах, продолжим об игре.
 Вам предстоит долгое  прохождение этого произведения. И не потому, что я так сказала, а потому, что бои проходятся либо очень долго, из-за скромно огромного количества мобов и ловушек на локации, либо очень трудно, из-за того, что вам нужно предпринять какие-либо действия за определенное количество ходов, что, конечно же, не сразу получается.
 К концу игры вам ужасно осточертеют уже однообразные бои и вы поскорее захотите узнать, что на самом же деле произошло и происходит. 
 Из моих слов должно быть ясно одно-ну сюжет уж очень интересен (по крайней мере, для меня), а бои ну уж очень сложны.
 В целом, о развитии персонажа могу напечатать немного. Вам придется искать (а каких-то не убивать) разнообразных НПС на карте, чтобы прокачивать физические и магические навыки, но уверяю вас- использовать вы из них будете только 3-5(не конкретно) понравившихся. Определенного класса в игре нет, но есть некоторые ограничения. Если вы в начале игры возьмете воина или лучника, то использовать(и прокачивать, ясный пень) магические навыки не сможете. Так же, вы не сможете использовать магию во время боя, если на вас будет металлическая броня.
 Ну, как вы поняли, игра мне очень понравилась, всем советую.

Well it is a good idea for a game, but the realisation is missing something.
What could that be?
Well the first impressions were good- the characters have a lot to learn, but somehow for the new players it is unknown could they learn everything, something or just few things? There is no explanation.
The game gives you to chose between 2 options that will define your game- will the main stats of the hero will be automaticaly distrubuted, or you will do everything manualy.
So far for me, my adventure was with 3 heroes, however I was with 2 warriors and a mage. Somehow I did not made a ranger and I found that as a mistake when advansing in the game.
I found myself more frequently repeating and reloading a map to find the best solution to win or get out from combat.
Yes, the combat. 
Well, the combat is Turn Based so you have time to think your strategy, however heroes miss a lot, and sometimes a chance to hit or make a spell of 70%+ is not enough. Every fail punish could punish you really badly.
The maps are not so big, but for that kind of game I guess they are enough, however, for me, they looked someking small.
You could interact with some object in the map or use an object to take a cover from an enemy archer, however, not everytime this thing works. Some archers simply ignore that.
The audio is good. The voice acting is in good level.
The soundtrack is good. I liked it.
I made few side quests, but one of them was really pain in the ass in at the end I even did not finished it. It was horrible. Probably much higher level heroes could do it.
The grapics are nice for the eye.
I did not encounter any bugs, but I can not keep playing the game. It is enough.
So for final- this is avarage turn based strategy with RPG elements, however, there are better ones out there that you can play.
For me- I would not try this game anymore. I really wanted to like it, but I can't give it more time. 4 hours and a little bit more are enough.",1449614616,1449614616,False,15,2,0.538280487060546875,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It has a good story that makes you want to invest time to find out what happens to the characters.

Just the WORST thing about the game is when you successfully miss 4 attacks in a row each with a hit chance of 80%. This sort of treachery happens often and really spoils the battle.

The battle map is great and you can easily find your way around the battlefield although in my opinion the user interface is lacking a bit - all the useful buttons are grouped together and are a little bit too small for my liking. You can semi-personalise each character and evolve their skills and attributes to your liking - although unless you want to turn a mage into a bad-boy-brawler (and why the hell would you do that) there isnt that much choice.

「とっつきにくい！」

この作品を評価しようとしたときに、まず真っ先に思い浮かんだ言葉だ。
「ヨーロッパではよく知られた「The Dark Eye」の世界観をベースにした、戦闘がターン制で進行するオーソドックスなSRPG」と聞けば、そういう風には思わない人が殆どだろうし、戦闘シーンの動画や画像を見れば、SRPGに慣れ親しんだ人ならどんな作品か予想がつくだろう。
実際、戦闘は見た人が想像した通りに進められていく。至ってオーソドックスなSRPGだ。
だが、「とっつきにくさ」はそこではなく、育成システムにある！

この作品での育成方法は、他作品で使われている「レベル」や「経験値」というものが無く、戦闘やクエストをクリアする度に得られる「AP」を、ステータスに割り振ることで、キャラを強化していくというものである。
それでも、このシステム自体は珍しくもなく、よくあるパターンの一つなのだが、割り振る項目がかなり多いのが、この作品の特徴である。

この作品を始めたら、まず最初にすることが主人公の作成である。この時点で、初心者モードか上級者モードを選ぶことになる。
初心者モードは、あらかじめ用意された３つのタイプから、１つを選ぶだけだが、唯一自由にキャラ作成を出来る機会を逃してしまうことになる。
仲間はある程度ベースが出来ているので、ゼロから作れるのは主人公だけ。
「なら上級者モードしかないだろう！」と思い上級者モードを選び、主人公作成に乗り出した人の大半がこう思うはずだ……

「とっつきにくい！」

この作品、主人公作成の時点で大量の「AP」が貰え、かなり自由に設定することが出来るのだが、例の如く割り振る項目が多く、それぞれがどの様な効果があるのかが、いまいち把握しきれない。かつ、余った「AP」は持ち越せない。
しかも、この作品は所謂「稼ぎ」が出来ず、限られたリソースで、どう進めていくかというデザインになっている。
さらに、一度決めたら振り直しは出来ない点と、見づらいUIが拍車をかける。
おまけに、攻撃力という項目が実際は命中率という、一見しただけでは分からない表記になっている……

戦闘シーンでは、「とっつきにくさ」はなく前述したとおりなのだが、一番気になる点は、やはり攻撃が当たりにくいことにつきる。
通常攻撃は当然、魔法もスキルも当たりにくい。(魔法は外れるというより発動しない)
通常攻撃なら装備武器に対応した項目、魔法ならその魔法に「AP」を振って命中率をあげるのが基本なのだが、MAXまで振っても外すことがままある。
あくまでも体感としてだが、確率表示で90%は外すことも念頭に、80％なら外れることを見越して70％以下は一か八かといったところだろうか。

これらの点に比べれば、翻訳が少し中途半端で一部表記が英語になる。ムービーシーンで字幕が小さい、且つ白字なので背景が白いと読めない。一部の敵の移動が遅いのでイライラする。などということは瑣末なことだと思う。

[h1] 良かった点 [/h1]
ここまで問題点ばかりを述べてきたが、良い点も勿論ある。
個性的なキャラクター、「とっつきにくさ」さえ克服すれば自由に育成出来るシステム、悪人が主役という一風変わったストーリー、など。
限られたリソースでやりくりする。という点も、人によってはプラスかも。

[h1] DLC [/h1]
DLCついてだが、大半は消化できたと思うのだが、DLCを導入した状態で1周しかしていないので、どのクエストと武器がDLCの物だったのかが、正確に区別がつかないので、いまいち評価しづらい。
ただ、メインストーリーに大きく絡んだものではなく、サイドクエストが増え、それに伴って追加のアイテムがあるというものなので、買わなくとも今作を十分楽しめる。

[h1] まとめ [/h1]
これまで述べたように、人におすすめ出来る作品ではない。
なぜなら、やはり「とっつきにくい」からだ。
しかしそれは、作品自体に致命的な点があるわけではなく、あくまでも人を選ぶということだ。これらの点を理解した人であるなら、購入も選択肢に入るのではないだろうか。",1449204323,1682317459,False,17,1,0.673765361309051514,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- repetitive fights (always the same)
- useless quests (you can forge a 9 element spear which is as good as other one you can find easily)

[h1]Spielbeschreibung:[/h1]
Blackguards ist ein Tabletop Strategie Spiel, welches zarte RPG Elemente enthält.
Dabei kann man seine vorgegebenen Charaktere, flexibel, verbessern.
Das ganze Spiel hat eine vorgegebene Story, welche man nur bedingt beeinflussen kann. 
Meistens können durch gewisse Entscheidungen nur Kämpfe vermieden oder getauscht werden.
Der Kernfokus in diesem Spiel sind die Kämpfe.

[h1]Für alle die mit dem Begriff ""Tabletop"" nichts anfangen können:[/h1]

Die Kämpfe spielt man auf Sechsecken. Man hat begrenzte Lauf- und Aktionsreichweite und kann sich auf Zauber, Nah- oder Fernkampf spezialisieren. Die Zugreihenfolge wird nach dem eigenen Initiative Wert gewählt und so wird der Kampf Zug für Zug abgehandelt.

[h1]Positiv:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Die Kämpfe sind innovativ, es gibt viele verschiedene Monster und die Schauplätze werden nicht recycelt.
[*] Man kann in den meisten Schauplätzen, in den Kämpfen, mit der Umgebung interagieren.
[*] Der Talentbaum für Waffentalente ist gut umgesetzt.
[*] Grafisch ist das Spiel sehr ansprechend.
[*] Ab dem dritten Kapitel kann man sich relativ frei bewegen.
[*] Gute Synchronisation.

[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Es gibt Attribute/Talente die für die Gruppe gut sind, man benötigt nur einen Charakter der diese hat und die ganze Gruppe erhält den Vorteil.
[*] Man ist bei den Kämpfen meistens in der Unterzahl.
[*] Die Karte Ansicht ist Geschmackssache.
[*] Es gibt eine maximale Traglast, welche bei Überschreitung Mali verursacht.

[/list]

[h1]Negativ:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Man muss bei manchen Kämpfen mit der Umgebung interagieren.
[*] Jeder Charakter hat den gleichen Talentbaum, der einzige Unterschied ist der das bei manchen einfach Talente gesperrt sind. Dies ist nicht nur ästhetisch unschön, sondern nimmt auch den Tiefgang bei der Gestaltung eines Charakters.
[*] An sich ist das System gerade für Magier und deren Zauber sehr begrenzt.
[*] Eine Stadt unterscheidet sich kaum von einer anderen. Personen und Läden werden hier einfach wiederverwertet.
[*] Die eigenen Charakter sind Abschaum, mir fällt es schwer nur einen davon zu mögen.
[*] Die Hauptstory ist weder innovativ noch annähernd interessant.
[*] Zufallswerte entscheiden maßgeblich über Sieg oder Niederlage in einem Kampf.
[*] Durch das Versagen in Kämpfen, muss man diese (vom letzten Speicherpunkt aus) wiederholen. Dies sorgt dafür das man immer wieder die gleichen Gegner, Sprüche, Taktiken und Umgebungen vor sich hat und das frustriert und nervt.
[*] Am Anfang hat man enormen Gold Mangel, man kann sich einfach nichts richtiges kaufen.
[*] Es gibt enorm wenig Ausrüstungen, dazu noch etwas sinnvolles zu finden ist noch viel seltener.
[*] Hat man mal das Gold um einen Charakter komplett auszurüsten, bringt dies einem keinen spürbaren Vorteil.
[*] Immunitäten gegen gewisse Zauber- und Waffentypen sind so gewählt das man seine Charaktere so weit in den Fertigkeiten fächern muss, das sie zu schwach für die normalen Kämpfe wären.
[*] Das Spiel warnt einen nicht, wenn man was komplett falsch macht.
[*] Die eingeblendete Hilfe ist mMn nicht sinnvoll und störend, lässt sich allerdings ausschalten.
[*] Es gibt bei den Zaubern fixe Schadenswerte, somit sind sie am Anfang enorm stark und am Ende ziemlich schwach.
[*] Die KI ist ziemlich bescheuert..., man kann sie leicht in Fallen etc. locken und sie verhält sich bei jedem Gegner gleich.
[*] Das Spiel hat ein paar Bugs, so sollte man auf der Weltkarte nicht zu weit scrollen da man sonst nicht mehr zurück kommt und ohnmächtige Charakter werden als tot betrachtet, was zu einem Sieg oder zu einer Niederlage führen kann.
[*] Der RPG/P&P Aspekt kommt nicht zum tragen.
[*] Wenige Sidequests, und langweilig sich immer wiederholende Aufgaben.
[*] Laufwege, in Kämpfen, lassen sich nicht richtig bestimmen.
[*] Um sich komplett zu heilen muss man zuerst irgendwo übernachten und sich dann bei einem Heiler heilen. Dadurch werden die Manareserven und Lebenspunkte aufgefüllt und die Wunden geheilt. Macht man dies anders herum, also man geht zu erst zum Heiler und dann übernachtet man irgendwo so zahlt man den vielfachen Preis für das gleiche, da der Heiler Lebenspunkte und Wunden heilt und seine Kosten darauf aufbauen, und die Kosten einer Übernachtung in einer Gaststätte gleich bleiben und diese Lebenspunkte und Manareserven auffüllen.

[h1]Wertung:[/h1]

Spielspaß: 2/5
[spoiler]Also am Anfang war es ganz nett, aber durch die dauernden Wiederholungen und das ständige kämpfen, fehlt einem die Motivation weiter zu spielen. Dazu eine eher schlechte Story und langweilige Nebenquests, hat es einfach nicht raus gehauen. [/spoiler]

Grafik: 4/5
[spoiler]Ich finde die Grafik größtenteils ansprechend. Einziger Kritikpunkt sind die Städte und die Karte die mir nicht gefällt. Dennoch finde ich das hier gute Arbeit geleistet wurde.[/spoiler]

Musik: 3/5
[spoiler]Hat mich nicht besonders gestört, aber auch nicht besonders bereichert.[/spoiler]

Kostenfaktor: 1/5
[spoiler]Grundgütiger, ich habe das Spiel zum Glück nicht für den Vollpreis von 40€ gekauft. Das ist vollkommen überzogen. Ganz ehrlich, ich würde das Spiel nicht noch einmal kaufen.[/spoiler]

Gesamteindruck: 1/5
[spoiler]Schleppend, ich ging eigentlich ohne große Erwartungen an dieses Spiel heran, und wurde dennoch enttäuscht. Das System ist zwar einigermaßen komplex, aber ziemlich schlecht umgesetzt. Da ich RPG's liebe und auch P&P in verschiedenen Spielsystemen leite, muss ich auch sagen das ich Kämpfe an sich nicht die Wichtigkeit zu spreche, wie sie hier zugesprochen wird. Dafür ist der RPG-Aspekt, für mich, viel zu mager ausgefallen. Nur zu empfehlen, wenn einem Story und Charakterentwicklung egal sind und man gerne Tabletop spielt.[/spoiler]

Schwierigkeitsgrad: 2/5
[spoiler]Wenn man sich mit dem System beschäftigt hat ist es nicht schwer zu meistern, das einzige Problem ist einfach der heftige Einschlag von Zufallswerten.[/spoiler]
Hinweis:
Der Schwierigkeitsgrad soll nur eine Richtlinie darstellen und fließt nicht in die Wertung mit ein.

◎よかったところ
世界観：ストラテジーRPGというジャンルはPCゲーにおいては非常に少ないので貴重な存在。そして、世界観も悪人のはびこる西洋ダークファンタジーと行った感じで非常に好み。主人公の仲間も優等生ではなく、どこか癖のある人物達であり、前科がある。
難易度：難易度としてはなかなか高く、ギミックも説明なしで設置されているため食らいながら自分で学習していく必要がある。敵の特性なども分からないので戦いながら推測して攻めていくというのはリアルではあるが楽しさに繋がるかは微妙。個人的にはどういう敵が出てくるのかは楽しみだったので好印象。

✖ダメなところ
成長システム：今作はレベルという概念はなく、戦闘によってスキルポイントを獲得し、それをスキルに割り振っていく仕様である。それゆえ、最初に方向性を決めておかないと器用貧乏になる恐れがある。しかし、初期ステータスを見ればそのキャラの得意分野は分かるので、それに沿って振っていけば苦戦はしないだろうと思う。しかし、そのせいで自由度はほぼ無くこの仕様にした意味もほぼ無い。
テンポ：ストラテジーにおいてはテンポが非常に重要であるが、このゲームは悪い。敵のターンの間だけ動作スピードを上げる設定などもないのずっと等速で敵の動きを見なければならない。もちろん、自軍の動作を速める事も出来ないのでゲームに慣れれば慣れるほどストレスがたまる作りになっている。

総評
世界観は好みだし、シナリオも衝撃的な展開もあって非常に楽しめた。しかし、肝心の戦闘要素はストレスの溜まる作りも多くテンポが悪いのと、成長に自由度が無いので周回性は低い。改善すれば良作になると思うので頑張って欲しい。",1448604316,1448604316,False,17,0,0.714590489864349365,0,True,False,False,False,,,

genre is underrepresented
No game breaking bugs
Significant protag customization
Interesting crapsack world
Portraits, mesh, and texturing is fairly decent
Voice acting is competent
Gave a moderate sense of player choices' mattering on first playthrough

Cons
Balance is poorly implimented in virtually every aspect of the game, from weapon and spell utility and encounter design, to difficulty curve, and pervasively undercuts every aspect of the gameplay
Mechanics are vastly overcomplicated, convoluted, and poorly explained.  VERY POORLY EXPLAINED.  
Animation is very basic

After I got over the needlessly high learning curve by experimenting with several builds, restarting the game a few times when they proved extremely frustrating to play, then reading several character build faqs, I discovered hamfisted, though not completely fruitless, neutral dark storytelling and moderately enjoyable, if one note, TBS gameplay.  Having finished the game I can conclusively say this is a game ONLY for extremely dedicated, veteran fans of the genre who are tolerant of some pretty serious lack of polish.  If you are such a person (and unfortunately since I completed it I was) you may consider this game a frustrating but sometimes enjoyable exercise of the TBS muscles.",1447784713,1447784770,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Sadly, this genre seems to be dying out, though the Blackguards series gives me some hope for the future of gaming.  I love how the Blackguards system is based off of a German roleplaying engine.  Old AD&D games like Pool of Radiance, even Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter NIghts (though I hate the real-time aspect of these) are my favorites, and Blackguards is definitely along that same line.

Some of the positives.  
*The customization available is one of this game's many strengths.  They allow the player to keep each character unique throughout this game without having too many options as to overwhelm.  
*The story isn't that happy-go-lucky anime stuff.  It's dark and intriguing.  The complaints regarding the main character's amnesia seem gripey to me.  Amnesia happens, but it's not overdone.  What I mean is that your main character may forget a few things, but won't go through the game complaining about missing memories.  The amnesia just adds to the mystery and allows the player to catch up on what has transpired.  Make no mistake, though, the focus is on the combat.
*Most battles allow for different ways of completing your mission using objects in the field or terrain.  The complaint some make along the lines of ""I use the same tactics every time and this game becomes boring"" is the result of the choice the individual player has made, not the limitations of the game. 
*I love the variety of the enemies you'll face and their crazy portraits.
*The soundtrack is mostly dark but there were several battle tracks I enjoyed.
*Don't expect to get the ""+5 Sword of Fiery Judgment"" toward the end.  The weapons in this game do not provide the means to become amazing in combat, which is very unusual for RPGs.  I appreciated the change.

What I didn't like.
*Around 75% through the game, my melee fighters were essentially maxed out.  Without assistance from magic, fighters need a lot of luck to be helpful.
*Speaking of luck, that D20 (the to-hit random number generator) is the most evil creature in creation.  90% treated me more like 70%.  1s were very rare and usually happened when I was finishing off a foe with few HP.  20s were frequent, as was foul language coming from me.  On top of that, there appeared to be a glitch.  I tossed, say, a 14 when 19 or below struck, yet the result was miss.  This occurred about one in every 15 attacks  (Despite this, the game is very beatable, I've finished it).
*I wish there was more story.  Not better story, just more story.  I still don't understand the motive for one of the player-controlled characters to follow around the main character.  I wish one of the foes was more-developed.

Those that haven't succumbed to mainstream gaming and still appreciate TRPGs can not go wrong in buying this game on sale.",1447532620,1447532620,True,57,3,0.775208413600921631,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That's about all you need to know; you will miss when you have a 100% chance to hit. It feels like an old game, but not in a good way.

게임을 하기전에 리뷰를 보니 악평이 많아서 시작이 두려웠는데

막상 해보니 게임 자체는 개인적으로 생각보다 그렇게 어렵지는 않았고

잘 만들었다고 보기는 힘들지만 그렇다고 심하게 망겜 수준도 아니긴 했습니다.

일단 그래픽은 2014년에 나온거 치고는 좀 구린 편이고 특히나 동영상의 프레임이 정말 보기 힘든 수준이었습니다.

스토리 역시 진부하고 흐지부지한 결말을 가지고 있는데 다크 아이의 세계관을 토대로 했다고 하는데

다크 아이에 대해서는 잘 모르고 설사 알고 있다고 해도 이런 전개는 이해하기 어려울 정도였습니다.

게임의 스토리 자체는 별거 없는 반면에 서브 퀘스트로 인해서 볼륨 자체는 나쁘지 않았습니다.

이 게임의 악평을 이끈 전투 시스템은 악평대로 게임에서의 명중률, 마법 실패 같은 스트레스 요소가 상당하긴 합니다만

다양한 승리 조건을 토대로 만든 맵의 구성은 그렇게 나쁘지는 않았습니다.

밸런스가 좀 엉망이라  특정 스킬 보유 유무에 따라 게임의 전반적인 난이도가 확확 바뀌는데

이로 인해 게임에서 캐릭터를 다양한 스타일로 키울 수 있게끔 만든 건 사실상 유명무실해져 버린 느낌이었습니다.

캐릭터 육성 말고도 게임 자체의 시스템적인 요소들이 대부분 부실하고 미완성의 느낌이 납니다. 

그리고 많은 패치를 했다고 들은 거에 비해 비록 게임 진행에 영향을 주진 않지만 자잘한 버그가 꽤 있었습니다.  

개인적으로 많은 부족한 부분이 있는 게임이긴 하지만 게임을 플레이 하는데 있어서 그냥저냥 나름 집중해서 

결말까지 봤고 사실 이 게임을 다른 사람에게 플레이 해보라고 추천하기는 어렵습니다만

The game can be a bit expensive for its real content, but I would surely recommend getting it on sale. Combat system's really good, you'll depend on strategies and using the environment to get some advantage. Characters are not very developed but are unusual and funny in many scenes, and the story is... well, a bit different, though it has its cliches.

Be careful when designing your main character! You'll probably end up failing your first game hard and noticing he's useless when it's too late... Start with an archer if you feel lost - you can't go wrong with that.

Pros
+ Tactic and varied combat, with lots of maps and strategies
+ Fully voiced, good dialogues
+ Many different weapons, spells and items you can use during the fights
+ Shady characters, not your classic heroes
+ More content than I expected, with a lot of sidequests
+ A real challenge if you want to go into the hard mode... or even normal difficulty
+ One of the best dwarfs ever

Cons
- Some fights can be really hard compared to the rest of the game
- Learning curve? More like learning wall
- You won't understand how combat works until you've failed a lot
- Game controls feel a bit clumsy sometimes, you may end up casting heals on yourself instead of the intended target
- The ending doesn't live up to the rest of the story, it's too abrupt and you feel like you're missing a cutscene or something

The story has its ups and downs and early it is a bit confusing because they throw alot of unknown terms at you and and most of them you will only learn halfway through the game. And the end is kinda lackluster in my opinion.

The combat is turn based and the battles are mostly diversed since some can have puzzle elemnts others can have a few stages and so on. And your choices along the game influences some of the battles you have.

One of the biggest problem in the game is the amount of stats and character builds you can do makes the game way to difficult and players that dont understand how the game works in that regards can completely screw their games and be forced to start from scratch. The game does a really poor job of explaining how the overall stats work and the only way to learn about them is looking at help menu and read it or go to the manual. 

On the positive side when you learn to make a proper build your mid-late game characters can have quite impressive abilities and power, the high level spell effects are rather impressive.

Also it is worth mentioning some of the achievements don't work properly or don't work at all.

Overall I liked the game however the high learning curve that can really punish you is something that only some people can tolerate.

Die grosse Stärke dieses Spieles sind die Kämpfe. Sie haben eine grosse taktische Tiefe und spielen 
im Rundenstrategie-Genre ganz oben mit. Oft ist auch der Einsatz von interaktiven Objekten bei einem Kampf gefordert,
damit man siegreich vom Platz geht. Es kommt auf das richtige Zusammenspiel der Spezialisten (Nah,- und Fernkämpfer,
Magier) an. Echt super!

Wichtig ist auch zu wissen, dass der Schwierigkeitsgrad recht heftig ist. Ich habe viel Rollenspiel und DSA Erfahrung,
hatte aber auf ""hart"" teilweise sehr heftige Herausforderungen. Dem Normalspieler empfehle ich den ""leichten"" und
erfahreneren Spielern den ""mittleren"" Schwierigkeitsgrad. Damit man mit dem Schwierigkeitsgrad gut zurecht kommt, sollte man sich am Anfang Zeit einplanen und überlegen, wie genau man seine Charaktere entwickeln will. Beim Magier kann man nur ein paar Zauber maxen und die wollen gut überlegt sein. Ob die Überlegungen stimmen, bekommt man im späteren Spielverlauf immer mehr mit und machen auch nen grossen Reiz des Spiels aus. Aber dadurch ist halt auch ein verskillen möglich!

Insgesamt war der Schwierigkeitsgrad in den ca. 200 Kämpfen konstant und fordernd, mit einigen ärgerlichen Ausnahmen. Einige dieser unbalancierten Kämpfe waren optional, einige der Kämpfe aber nicht. Sehr schade, dass man
so oft neuladen muss, bis die Gegner nicht tödlich vorgehen, ohne das man was machen kann.

Auch gab es zuviel Erfahrungspunkte im Spiel. Ich konnte meine Party voll ausbauen und noch einige ""Extras"" leisten.
So geht der Schwierigkeitsgrrad ab nem bestimmten Punkt leider nach  unten...

Leider gibt es auch nen Zauberspruch (Hast Stufe 3) der fast wie ein Cheat ist und auch den Schwierigkeitsgrad
bedeutend absenkt.

Apropos Zauber: Richtig super sind übrigens die Effekte der Zauber. Die Zauber selbst gibt es jeweils in 4 Stufen und die höchste Stufe hat oftmals nen Effekt fürs ganze Schlachtfeld. Da die Zauber jeweils optisch und akkustisch echt gelungen sind, hat man noch mehr Spass an den Kämpfen.

Der grösste Negativpunkt: Trotz das viel Arbeit und Liebe in das Spiel gesteckt wurde, wird es nach Erscheinen
kaum ""gepflegt"". Es gibt ziemlich viele Steam-Erfolge, die einfach immer noch nicht funktionieren! Das ist den Entwicklern schon lange bekannt. Getan hat sich da aber seitdem nichts mehr. Auch wurde im Forum zugesagt,
Waffenschadenssteigerungen durch Körperkraft klar zu machen (ab welchem Wert gibt es eine Steigerung). Trotz Zusage der Entwickler im Januar 2014 im offiziellen Forum ist dies immer noch nicht geschehen. Schwach!!!

Trotz allem freue ich mich auf Blackguards 2, da es wenige Rundenstategietitel mit dieser Tiefe und der starken Lizenz auf dem Markt gibt! Deshalb klare Kaufempfehlung an Fans des Genres!

Wer die Vorlage kennt, findet sich schnell zurecht, denn die Fähigkeiten und Zauber werden wie üblich gesteiert. Neulinge werden jedoch etwas Einarbeitungszeit einkalkulieren müssen. Man kann die Charaktere definitiv verskillen.

Das Spiel besteht eigentlich zu 80% aus einer Aneinanderreihung von Kampfszenen, die nach DSA-Manier in Kampfrunden ablaufen. Die Kämpfe werden lose durch die recht klassische und liniare düstere Story zusammen gehalten.
Natürlich gibt es auch viele Nebenquets, die aber selten sonderlich aufregend sind.
Die Story geht an sich in Ordnung, verliert aber durch die Kampflastigkeit etwas an Fahrt
Positiv finde ich, dass man nicht die klassischen Helden spielt, sondern Antihelden, die mehr oder weniger unfreiwillig in die Story hinein geraten. 
Im Spiel sind auch div. klassische Rollenspielerwitze und Klischees nett verarbeitet, was ich wirklich witzig fand.

Negativ finde ich, dass die Story recht locker insziniert ist. Die Kämpfe als solches sind nicht sonderlich mitivierend, da auch das Zufallselement sehr hoch ist und man mit etwas Würfelpech auch häufiger verliert und neu laden muss. Erst zum Ende hin werden die Videosequenzen dichter und man wird mehr mit genommen.

Insgesamt kann ich das Spiel für Rollenspieler bedingt empfehlen, wenn man mit Schwächen in der Spielmechanik leben kann und nicht allzuviel Wert auf eine aufregende Inszenierung legt.
Wer mit Pen & Paper nichts anfangen kann, sollte auf jeden Fall die Finger von dem Spiel lassen. 

Ich persönlich würde für das Spiel nicht mehr als 10€ ausgeben. Ich habe es im Sale für 3,99 € bekommen und dafür war es schon in Ordnung. Als Vollpreisspiel hätte ich es mir aber nicht gekauft. Im Vergleich mit anderen Vollpreisspielen wie z.B. Skyrim oder Mass Effect ist dann der Vollpreis eigentlich auch nicht zu rechtfertigen.

La montée en expérience des personnages se fait sans niveau d’expérience à proprement parler. En effet, tous les points d’expérience accumulés au cours des combats et des quêtes terminées vont pouvoir être dépensés dans l’intégralité des  caractéristiques (force, courage, etc), compétences (pièges, soin, etc), maitrise des armes et des sorts, comme bon nous semble. Sachant qu’il y a pléthore de paramètres pour chaque personnage, la découverte du système de leveling est un peu abrupte au début, mais une fois qu’on s’y est fait, le système nous apparait comme très complet et nous permet de spécialiser nos personnages finement, comme bon nous semble.

Les combats, malgré quelques soucis de finition question jouabilité, sont très tactiques, et ils se jouent à la façon du X-Com moderne, à savoir que notre personnage a le droit pendant son tour à « un mouvement plus une action » ou bien « un mouvement étendu ». Si ce système a fait ses preuves, on regrettera cependant l’absence du système de points d’action à la manière d’un Fallout qui permet une gestion encore plus fine des opérations tactiques. Le plateau de chaque zone de combat est divisé en hexagone et l’ordre d’initiative des participants (personnages ou ennemis) est clairement affiché en bas de l’écran.

Malheureusement, l’ensemble du reste du titre présente trop de défauts qui, mis bout à bout, finissent par gâcher l’expérience de jeu. En voici les principaux :

La gestion de l’inventaire est simplement une calamité.
Le classement des objets dans l’inventaire général (globalisé entre tous les personnages) se fait en fonction de leur date d’acquisition, ce qui est stupide.
Le système de comparaison entre l’arme/armure équipée et celle disponible dans l’inventaire est bien trop imprécis pour être d’une quelconque utilité. 
Chaque personnage dispose de 3 slots d’armes (main gauche + main droite). Mais par exemple la nécessité d’allouer à chaque arc (main gauche du slot X) son lot de flèches (main droite du slot X) est également une aberration sans nom, puisque ces mêmes flèches ne pourront être utilisées par ce personnage avec l’arc du slot Y.
J’en passe et des meilleures…

Le jeu nous impose en permanence son rythme.
La gestion de l’aventure au cours des chapitres 1 et 2 est une catastrophe, avec un ultra-dirigisme qui donne la nausée, et on se doit d’enchainer parfois jusqu’à 3 combats sans que le jeu ne nous demande quoi que ce soit. Sachant que la gestion de l’équipe ne peut se faire qu’en dehors des combats, leur enchainement peut vite tourner au désastre.
Les choses s’arrangent néanmoins à partir du chapitre 3, avec la quasi-intégralité des lieux qui se débloque et la possibilité de faire les quêtes secondaires comme bon nous semble.

Enfin, le défaut IMPARDONNABLE pour un jeu de tactique faisant intervenir autant de ""lancers de dés virtuels"" : la gestion des statistiques ne suit simplement aucune logique mathématique. 
Chaque action d’attaque entreprise par un personnage au cours d’un combat est notifiée à l’écran par un pourcentage de réussite. Mais le jeu est simplement incapable de gérer proprement ces statistiques et il m’est arrivé de rater un coup affiché initialement à 100% de chance de réussite. Véridique !!! Et il n’est pas rare d’enchainer avec vos personnages des échecs successifs affichés à 90% de chance de réussite. Ce manque flagrant de cohérence mathématique fait qu’il n’est pas rare de devoir recommencer de nombreux combats sous prétexte que nos personnages débutent tous leur premier tour avec une action ratée, le retour de bâton de l’adversaire étant alors souvent saignant. A devenir maboule dingo !

En conclusion, Blackguards présente dans son ensemble vraiment trop de défauts, dont certains sont fondamentaux, et qui mis bout à bout finissent par rendre le joueur fou.

The layout is also in my opinion clunky and you can't rotate the map to get a better view, sometimes characters can be hard to see hidden behind objects on the map.

I cannot recommend this game but if you are really in to the tactical combat part of roleplaying games and want a challenge give it a try.

Most reviewers/trolls/noobs outright complain about the difficulty of the game, calling out bugs on things like dmg type resistance or getting knocked down because they cant figure out character builds.
if you want a game that its pretty much like click here to win, you are in the wrong genre.
if you want a game where you dont want to retry the same fight a few times to get it right, you are in the wrong genre.
This is a turn based rol-playing game, you won't get things right from the beginning withouth knowing the game beforehand. 
I can almost assure you that you might screw up the builds of your party and there wont be an easy way to fix that, but thats the idea of the game, you either push through, start over or go to forums or reviews to whine like a noob because you failed to see the game manual/help/build guides.

Now if you like challenges, and turn based RPGs this one is for you, you have magic, killer snipers and swords! 

bit of a spoiler if you may
you get a very functional party consisting of: A greedy sort-of-crazy dwarf, a gigollo magician, a stoner elf, a killer jungleman and a witch.
you can mold the characters as you damn well please, with some restrictions of course, but who dosnt want to have a mage in his party?

what else? main character is not gender or class locked so that gives you some freedom to choose what you want to do.

Pros:
Hex-based tactical combat
Lots of character customization
Points system for leveling skills
Environmental effects such as setting bushes on fire, slipping in puddles, or knocking stalagtites off the ceiling of a cave

Cons:
You will likely hit your opponents maybe 10% of the time. You have a hit percentage ranging from 0 to 100. This is based on your skill with the weapon, your attack stat, and the level of the creature you're attacking. This does not take into account their ability to dodge or parry. A character (opponent or ally) can parry the first physical attack against them each turn. They can dodge any number of attacks per turn. So, if you have a 90% chance to hit, it is then further reduced behind the scenes by their dodge rating, and again by parry if they have not yet been hit. If you have anything less than say, 80% chance to hit, it may take you dozens of turns to end a battle that could have ended in like 6.

Enemies at the beginning of the game hit every hard, and rarely miss. You can increase your dodge and parry ratings through skills, but at character select you can't exactly make it huge. This would be fine, if it weren't for the fact that enemies can quite often hit for 10-15 damage, while your character only has about 30 health. Early game you only have 3 party members, and very often face off against 5+ enemies. It's easy to get swarmed, so using choke points is a must-- at least it would be if the majority of the levels they put you in weren't open rooms.

Cover doesn't seem to do anything. One of the earliest tips you get is that you are harder to hit in partial cover, and even harder to hit in full cover, like behind a tree. Archers have no trouble hitting you from the full length of the map behind full cover for 5-8 damage a turn, and it will take at least 2 or 3 turns to be able to reach them.

Some quests/scenarios are outright impossible if you try them too early, and the game has no qualms about sending you to your death. A good example of an early scenario in this game is facing a Wood Troll (like a treant). It has a ton of health and does a lot of damage (like 15-20 per hit), but it's slow and in a gaseous swamp. You can stand in front of a gas pocket and  use a fire spell or torch on the gas to explode it a few times to win the fight. You could do this at level 1 if you wanted, but an uninformed player would try to rush it and die quickly. 

A bad example is later on. You fight some dwarves in an arena. They have a lot of health, do a lot of damage, and can move as far as you. You're *supposed* to use the same method as the Wood Troll. Stand in front of the mace trap before it activates, lure the enemy into it, and do most of the damage through the trap. My issue is I was underleveled, and there was no way for me to know this until it was too late. The enemy dodged 100% of my attacks, knocked down a character per turn, and the melee dwarf hit for 15+ damage per turn plus 5 poison per turn while 2 of my characters had ~30 hp, and one with 46. The melee dward also parried the trap that was supposed to deal the damage to him each turn, so he was functionally invincible. I tried at least a dozen times, looked online, and saw the only real way to win the fight is to ignore the mission until you had another party member and were a little more leveled. Looking at my saves, I had one auto save right before the fight, a quick save right before the fight, and a manual save about an hour and a half prior (Which isn't the game's fault, but frustrating nonetheless).

You can't level skills without finding a trainer, even if you meet the pre-requisites to unlock it, or had the option to learn it during character creation. If I don't spend at least one point into the mend wounds ability at character creation, I cannot learn it until much later when I find the right trainer. I would understand for some skills, but for the basic levels of some passive abilities or skills it doesn't make much sense.

Overall, the game is difficult for the sake of being difficult, but not in a way that self improvement can make it any easier. Unlike an action game like Dark Souls, dying isn't always the result of you fucking up. A lot of the time, it's because a creature rolled the highest it possibly could 3 turns in a row, or all 3 of your characters missed every single roll 3 turns in a row. If you're okay with restarting a mission over and over just to beat it, or to avoid getting knocked down and started on fire before your first turn, go for it. If you're as easily frustrated as me at a game where RNG is the core mechanic of the game, avoid it, even for $3.00",1441156873,1441156873,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Una serie di comparti, da quello grafico alla customizzazione e al combattimento, sono davvero ben fatti e molto curati e mi fa incazzare che tutto ciò che di buono ha questo gioco sia rovinato da scelte di gameplay, stuttura mappe, gestione incontri/finanze e sopratutto il BILANCIAMENTO della difficoltà dei nemici e scelte di design delle sfide.

chi è il genio che ha pensato di mettere scontri in serie senza possibilità di cure (limitate già di suo) con mappe fatte a dir poco col culo (ctrl+c e ctrl+v su questo quello e quello. poi ricopro il 75% della mappa di trappole e di NOIOSISSIMI buratti che non colpiscono mai e danno solo noia e fastidio nell'aspettare che finiscano la loro animazione), con scelte di bilanciamento delle medesime sfide al limite del ridicolo? (""ma si per salvare tizio devi essere qui entro 5 turni, 3 ti servono per arrivarci e in mezzo hai 6 nemici con altrettante trappole"", oppure ""ma si, mettiamo due nani fullati di pozioni di cura che asfaltano ogni pg, senza contare che il party è NUDO e senza possibilità di usare gli oggetti precedentemente acquisiti"". davvero si, ottima idea!)

in definitiva; il gioco, per un'amante degli rpg tattici a turni, sarebbe anche molto bello, se determinate scelte di level design e bilanciamenti vari non fossero stati fatti col culo! giocare al normale è frustrante da morire, senza parlare che se sbagli un salvataggio al momento sbagliato, tipo entrare (senza sapere NULLA di cosa sta per accadere) in una sequela di eventi no stop senza tregua ne possibilità di rifocillamenti vari...  devi ricominciare da capo.
e non dimentichiamoci la bellisima parte ""sei nudo, vai e combatti ma prima comprati questo equip costoso come un rene che poi non ti servirà più appena riavrai la tua roba"". 200 monete d'oro butte via nel bottino, ole!

no programmatori, no... prendete chi ha fatto queste scelte di level design e mandatelo a coltivare rape in zimbawe, forse farà meno danni.

Pros:
- lässt sich leicht deinstallieren

Cons:
- Story äusserst fragwürdig, ich kam nicht mit:
   Eben noch bin ich im Kampf im Sumpf, dann plötzlich in einem Haus im Gespräch, dann wieder im Kampf in einem offenen, ebenen Gebiet, nach dem Kampf befinde ich mich abermals im Kampf, diesmal im Sumpf. Wo ist denn da die Logik?!
- An einer Stelle verlor ich fast meine komplette Ausrüstung und Gold (Dukaten). Ich weiss nicht wieso. Bug?
- Im Kampf fällt auf einmal ein dicker Stein auf all meine 3 Partymembers und der Kampf ist verloren. Wo kam der Stein her? Man weiss es nicht....
- Die Kämpfe sind unfair, meist hat man es mit  anzahlmässig mehr Gegner zu tun, als man selbst Partymembers hat. Ausserdem werden die Gegner bevorzugt, zB durch einen Heilkristall, der alle Gegner pro Runde komplett hochheilt!
- Manche Gegenden kann man gar nicht komplett erforschen, weil man sich auf einmal vorher schon wieder in einem Gespräch befindet, plötzlich und unerwartet. Im Anschluss findet man sich total woanders wieder und kommt nicht mehr zurück.
- Die Kampfschauplätze sind unübersichtlich, manchmal kann man gar nicht jedes Feld sehen bzw. anklicken.
- Wenn ich auf einen Gegner klicke, um ihn anzugreifen, muss ich manchmal über 10x klicken, bevor der Angriffsbefehl endlich ausgeführt wird.
- Die Magie ist praktisch wertlos. Man verbraucht sehr viel Mana (AP) im Vergleich zu dem Schaden, der bei einem Kampfspell rauskommt. Lächerlich! Da macht ein ganz normaler Knüppel mehr Schaden und verbraucht nichtmal Mana.

I was getting so frustrated I nearly threw my mouse through my monitor.  Blackguards is presented as a game returning to the core roots of RPG strategy goodness.  Just check out the multiple videos from Daedalic above for all the stuff that sounds so great about this game.  What is presented sounded awesome to me but in reality my two attempts through the game turned into a frustrating slog from one scenario to the next.  

I got hooked on the story from the start which turned out to be a prison break.  Nothing ground-shakingly new here but it worked for bringing three main characters together and launching them off on what was to be a quest to save the world.  The cut-scene interactions just propel the story forward, but did contain some humorous dialogue.  City/settlement locations are really just screens you click on to visit the tavern/shop/quest giver, etc.  Again, nothing earth-shattering for the genre but where this game was supposed to shine was in the combat.

And the combat on many of the levels was excellent.  Some of the scenarios were very challenging and I truly felt good when I had achieved victory conditions.  You certainly cannot simply build up your characters and then rush through everything.  Planning was necessary.   All that was great.

Specific building of your characters is crucial to the point that if you build them wrong, you will find that the difficulty spikes.  Character building is handled through allocating skill points.  There are a lot of options (FIVE screens worth) and very little in-game guidance on what to build up first.  I am sure most players will do what I did and end up resorting to the forums and walkthroughs to know how best to maximize their points.  It should not be this difficult or nebulous on building up your characters - especially with this many options.  The game reminds you to save often so you can go back to an earlier time and rebuild if needed.  But that still stings a little knowing that you lost that progress and will need to make it up.

But then the game started throwing out some curve balls on the scenarios and I found myself needing to restart certain ones again and again.  These levels were often fronted by a cut-scene dialogue that had to be clicked through again and again.  I just do not understand why they couldn't simply start the level with your characters on the field.  Many of these levels had special rules or situations that were not made apparent until you played them.  So you learned the ""special"" rules through failing at the level and had to try again.  And again.  And again.  

It does not help when the game chains scenarios together without a way to rest in-between.  You may find that by the end of the 2nd or 3rd scenario you are completely out of potions/health/magic/whatever.  And you may need to not only restart that level, but perhaps go back to a prior level so that you end with enough health/magic to be successful in the next one.  I could see the game doing this on hardcore difficulty for those who really enjoy upping the difficulty, but I just wanted to veg out after a hard day at work.  

By the time I was into the gladiator fights in chapter 2 I realized something.  The. Game. Was. No. Fun. 

I am recommending a pass on this one.  If you do buy it, wait for a nice Steam or bundle sale.",1440457425,1440457425,False,30,3,0.704629957675933838,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Senza svelare nulla sulla trama chiarisco fin da subito che i cosidetti ""cattivi protagonisti"" non sono poi quel gruppo di degenerati che si può pensare ma risultano più che altro un branco di disperati che tra intrighi e misteri decidono di collaborare tra loro; non mancano situazioni tragiche ma anche umoristiche che però lasciano spesso il tempo che trovano.
La trama in sè non è all'ultimo grido ma subisce un'evoluzione e tutto sommato invoglia a proseguire, alternando persino qualche flashback e approfondendo alcuni aspetti dei compagni di gioco, a patto però di dedicarsi ad alcune quest secondarie.

Graficamente il gioco risulta curato nelle ambientazioni ma non nei personaggi che appaiono come se fossero di una generazione precedente.
Personalmente ho apprezzato la scelta di disersificare le icone di alcuni nemici (per esempio tra gli scheletri c'è nè uno con la benda, altri hanno espressioni diverse e via dicendo) durante le battaglie, però il tutto si poteva applicare direttamente anche ai modelli dei personaggi.
Il gioco nonostante la natura strategica si adatta molto bene anche alla modalità Big Picture, a patto però di usare la risoluzione 1920X1080.
Nonostante le apparenze il gioco non è propriamente digeribile per l'hardware moderno e può capitare qualche leggero calo di framerate sopratutto durante l'esecuzione degli attacchi magici di livello 4.

Riguardo al sonoro è buono il doppiaggio (esclusivamente in inglese) dei personaggi mentre la colonna sonora risulta tutto sommato orecchiabile anche se difficilmente sarà ricordata al termine del gioco.

La giocabilità è affidata quasi esclusivamente al mouse con qualche scorciatoia a livello di tastiera, fortunatamente viene in aiuto il tutorial iniziale che aiuta a comprendere le meccaniche di base anche se la maggior parte delle battaglie richiede più l'astuzia (in particolare interagendo con gli elementi di sfondo) e la magia rispetto alla forza bruta. 
In Blackguards non esiste il ""farming"" e le battaglie spesso danno un numero di punti esperienza esiguo rispetto alle stesse, diventa così importante distribuire i punti esperienza più verso le abilità che riguardano magia e attacchi a distanza piuttosto che al resto e sopratutto diventa fondamentale fare affidamento sugli istruttori (ce ne sono in tutte le città principali).

La longevità di Blackguards è sicuramente buona, ho impiegato più di 36 ore per completare la modalità storia al livello di difficoltà normale dedicandomi anche a diverse quest secondarie, tuttavia penso che la maggior parte delle battaglie (che poi sono il fulcro del gioco) siano state eccessivamente lunghe e che probabilmente si poteva strutturare meglio il gioco, ad esempio l'inserimento di qualche minigioco (magari come tributo agli altri titoli di Daedalic) avrebbe allentato la presa e spezzato il ritmo.

In conclusione questo Blackguards è un titolo di buona fattura, un po' punitivo ma anche appagante e tutto sommato persino divertente, qui su Steam è ancora troppo caro ma la versione retail si trova intorno ai 10 euro.

Убогий перевод. Ну, к искажениям обычных и понятных вроде бы фраз мы уже привыкли, но тут есть и не переведённые и даже полностью исчезающие! В паре моментов, но есть.
Наполненность мира так же вызывает стойкое недоумение. Тактические битвы, города с одним, реже двумя экранами да карта. Вот и всё.
И если в битвы изредка бывают интересными и необычными, то с точки зрения красивостей посмотреть вообще не на что. Хотя казалось бы можно было сделать хотя бы в городах что-то уникальное и интересное, но нет.
Надежда на сюжет, в котором Daedalic'ки традиционно сильны так же не оправдалась. Вроде и сюрпризы есть и загадки, а не цепляет совершенно. Есть несколько интересных дополнительных квестов, однако в основном это просто предлог для очередной тактической битвы.

・序盤の自由度のなさ
・中盤以降自由度が出てきたと思いきや、所々ある装備固定のイベント
・戦闘突入に際してマップの情報も得られず陣形も選べない
・毒・転倒持ちがやたら多く、テンポの悪いゲーム展開
・めちゃくちゃな確率表示

基本的に戦闘はプレイヤー側が不利な状態で始まる上に主人公が一番前にいることが多いので、開幕転倒などで嬲られて怒りの再スタートという展開がちらほら。

また、敵側の状態異常系の魔法等はほぼ失敗しないし、毒も単なるダメージだけではなくステータス低下の効果も持っているので、特に終盤近くは1ステージをクリアするのにやたら時間がかかる。

こういった部分に加えて戦闘中の確率表示がさらに苛つきを煽る。
90%の攻撃が3回連続で外れる、などは当たり前。なんと100%と表示されている攻撃すらスカる。
魔法ですら条件によっては発動してなお当たらない事もある。

他にも育てたキャラが離脱したり、突然魔法を使えなくなったり…

キャラクターや世界観などは好みだし、面白かっただけに色々残念。

This game is like that burger in the TV commercial.. 
Graphic is great, Sound is great and packaging and concept is awesome.

But when you actually play it it's like a Plastic burger that you will have a lot problem to chew on and it taste bad.

First.. The Story is Linear with supposed plot twist but it's quite badly rewriten with a lot things unexplained.
Second.. The Game combat mecanism is following a old DND3 type dice/board game. Which they did a good job translate into a PC game but it just doesn't work out.. Repetitive and uninteresting.
Third.. each battle map suppose give you options on how to finish the each map solution seems very linear and easy to guess. Each battle may have different enemy but they don't feell unique when i see a different one.
Fourth.. The Game difficulty is super hard. I am a DND vetern and studied quite abit of that dice game before i started and I have a tons of difficulty finish the game.
Fifth.. the game interface is not well designed and hard to operate.
Six:.. there are about 7 Achievements broken at the moment and from what i heard in the forum the developer is not gonna fix them.

Ich habe nun den ""Endkampf"" gesehen ... oder eher ein Massaker. Ich weiß wirklich nicht was bei den Entwicklern ""Einfach"" bedeutet. Haben die das jeweils gespielt? Es gibt bisher in meinem Leben nur ein einziges Spiel, das mich mehr aufgeregt hat als das hier ... und Blackguards ist gerade dabei die #1 zu werden.

Ich bin Magier, Buffe meine Leute. Aurelia ist tot, weil ich von den 12(?) Prüfungen nur ein einziges Mal einen Fehler gemacht habe. Wow ... wozu dann sich bei den anderen 11 überhaupt noch anstrengen?

Also Kämpfen wir zu 4 gegen endlose Massen an Gegnern. Die Zauberer werden dauernd niedergeworfen, sodass man keine Zeit für Buffs irgendeiner Art hat. Sobald die es dann schaffen mal nicht niedergeworfen zu werden ... tja ... dann sind die schon so am Arsch, dass sie nur noch sich selbst heilen dürfen.

Meine Leute werden durch gegnerische Buffs geschwächt, sodass ich permanent gerade mal 40% Treffsicherheit habe. Das macht wirklich 0 Spaß. Taktische Herausforderun? Ich weiß nicht ... wenn man nicht ein mal zum Zug kommt ... da kann man noch so viel taktieren versuchen.

Ach ja ... was mich auch tierisch aufgeregt hat war, als ich mit Befreiungsschlag die Massen niederknüppeln wollte ... 5 Runden hintereinander ... 3 Gegner gleichzeitig ... 95% Treffsicherheit ... kein einziges Mal getroffen.

Ich weiß nicht, ob ich das Spiel mit diesen Settings überhaupt noch schaffen kann. Ich habe es jetzt mehrmals probiert ... aber in der letzten Runde gegen Urias habe ich keinerlei Chance auch nur einen verdammten Zug zu machen. Nur Naurim hält es einigermaßen aus ... trifft aber nichts, ist geblitzt, vergiftet etc.. Ich habe Antidots, Heiltränke (+500) etc. mit ... aber das ist innerhlab 3 Runden aufgebraucht ... Alternative: Tod.

Ich bleibe dabei ... das Spiel ist nicht gebalanced. Wenn man einen auf Heiler macht und nicht weiß, dass später Aurelia ins Team stößt und ebenfalls zaubern kann ... dann hat man am Ende so viel Scheiße geskillt. Dabei habe ich mich sogar noch beherrschen können und die Heldenpunkte(?) gesammelt ... ich hatte über 8000, die ich dann entsprechend geskillt hatte. Killermagier, Buffmagier, Naurim der Tank und Takata, der Speerkämpfer. Alles hat Sinn gemacht, reicht aber wohl nicht. Ach ja ... Talente etc. habe ich natürlich auch ""gut"" geskillt ... 

Eventuell würde ich es neu starten und einen anderen Weg ausprobieren. Ich habe keinen einzigen Fernkämpfer ... dachte in der Mitte des Spiels, dass Niam zum Team gehört und da bleiben würde ... tja. Takata und Naurim als Fernkämpfer? Ne.

NACHTRAG #2:
Also ... ich habe einen uralten Spielstand geladen und habe mich bis zum Endboss durchgeschlagen ... überraschenderweise, wenn man weiß wie gespielt wird, wird es wesentlich einfacher. Man kennt die Tricks und man benutzt eventuell Zauber, die man normalerweise nicht nutzen würde in iwelchen anderen Games.

Unterm Strich würde ich sagen, dass man das Spiel doch empfehlen kann ... aber nur für < 10€ und nur für Leute, die sich trotz Rage dazu entschließen können ein Spiel bis zum Ende durchzuspielen.

Боёвка пошаговая, каждая карта сделана вручную и на ней множество интерактивных объектов: ловушки, ящики, бочки с горючим, смертоносные вертушки и т. д. Всё это серьёзно расширяет возможности для тактики и придумывать как заманить врага на лужу с горючим весело. Многие жалуются на сложность игры, и они правы - если вы не получаете удовольствие от зубодробительной тактики, то лучше сразу отложить покупку - драться придётся много и часто, порой с особыми условиями: дойти до другого конца карты, убить 13 противников, уберечь какого-нибудь персонажа.
Сюжет неплох и несколько раз удивит вас своими поворотами, но не ведитесь на намёки о тяжёлых моральных выборах и ""злодейской"" линейки из описания - выборов в игре немного, а партия во главе с мгг или жгг (да, у нас есть возможность выбрать пол своего персонажа и спасибо за это) бросается на выручку NPC в 90% случаев. 
Персонажи приятные и существенно скрашивают походные будни своими перебранками и комментариями. В целом, они не стесняются втягивать нас в квесты, высказываться по поводу заданий, которые мы берём, главного сюжета и друг друга. Аурелия с Зурбараном также часто предлагают альтернативные битве варианты прохождений: подкупить стражу, уболтать фанатиков. Свободно разговаривать с сопартийцами нельзя, все беседы строго по ходу главной ветки.
Особенно порадовало разнообразие брони и одежды - закрытой! - которая одинаково сидит и на мужских, и на женских персонажах, не превращаясь волшебным образом в бронелифчик. NPC в этом плане в принципе радуют: встретим и лучшую гладиаторку арены, и знаменитую ученую, и командира-защитницу города, за что разработчикам отдельное большое спасибо.
В целом и общем, если вам лень читать весь этот текст, игра неплохая, но звёзд с неба не хватает и будет куда более интересна любителям сложных тактических битв, поскольку именно они здесь составляют львиную долю удовольствия. И да: Blackguards основана на ролевой системе The Dark Eye, поэтому в навыках, характеристках и способностях разбираться придётся, если не хотите наткнутся на непроходимость игры. Ничего сложного в этом нет: игра любезно подсветит значения, зависящие от конкретной характеристики, стоит вам только на неё навести. Можно также просто почитать описания этих характеристик.

О недостатках:
- ближе к финалу боёвка начинает надоедать, особенно когда в дело вступают особые условия для победы (с ними откровенно переборщили в последней главе). Если будете рваться выполнять все побочные квесты, это может произойти раньше.

Несколько советов для желающих:
- выберите тип оружия, на котором будут специализироваться персонажи-не маги и вкачивайте все очки в него. Не распыляйтесь на несколько веток (по крайней мере, не берите больше двух), ничего хорошего это не принесёт;
- в партии должны быть воины с секирами/топорами/булавами - оружием дробящего типа. Вполне достаточно и одного такого (скажем, Наурим прекрасно подойдёт), но он быть должен, так как некоторым врагам можно нанести урон только этим типом оружия или магией;
- прокачивайте магам разные ветки заклинаний. У вас в команде будут два мага, не дублируйте их ветки, специализируйте каждого на чём-то своём. 
- в бою можно пользоваться только теми зельями, которые висят у персонажей в слоте пояса;
- магам можно и нужно дать оружие дальнего боя, скажем, арбалеты;
- особые способности и новые заклинания невозможно выучить самостоятельно, вам потребуется помощь наставников (тренеров) или волшебные книги (в случае магов). Учат все бесплатно, так что не теряйтесь и смотрите на ветки способностей и магии: тому, что подсвечено тёмно-серым наставник научить не может, светло-серое вы уже знаете, красному научить тренер может, но у вас не хватает характеристик/очков опыта, синему можно научиться прямо сейчас;
- не забывайте о талантах. В игре много ловушек и вам в любом случае понадобится наблюдательность (observation), которая помогает их заметить и активируется через круговое меню. Также полезна устойчивость (body control), иначе прогулки через болота/масляные лужи превратятся для вас в кошмар из непрерывных падений.",1435736036,1435736524,True,15,1,0.66200178861618042,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Jeder der wenigstens einmal in seinem Leben ein Pen & Paper Rollenspiel wie ""Das Schwarze Auge"" (DSA) gespielt hat, kennt vermutlich diese Situation... 
DSA Blackguards greift das wohl populärste Rollenspielsystem nach ""Dungeons & Dragons"" auf und verfrachtet es in eine Rundenbasierendes Real-Time Strategie Spiel...

Konkret bedeutet das, man verfügt über 3 - 5 Heldenfiguren, die man auf einem Schachbrett ähnlichen Spielfeld zu unterschiedlichen Bedingungen herum schickt. 
In der Regel bedeutet hier die Hauptaufgabe: Besiege alle Gegner.
Hierzu stehen den einzelnen Helden wiederum Spezialfähigkeiten zur Verfügung.

Im Fall von DSA Blackguards wird zusätzlich der Rollenspielfaktor des Originals dazu gemischt. Man kann innerhalb einer Welt agieren, muss sich durch Kämpfe und Aufgaben ""Abenteuerpunkte"" (APs) verdienen, mit denen man sich dann bei Lehrmeistern wieder neue Spezialfähigkeiten kaufen kann.
Darüber hinaus, muss man seinen Charackter verbessern/ skillen. Auch das geschieht über APs, und natürlich kann eine bessere Waffe und eine bessere Rüstung auch nicht schaden. Diese kosten allerdings Gold in Form von Dukaten ;), die man ebenfalls durch die Absolvierung von Quests erhält.

Was braucht ein gutes Rollenspiel noch außer dem Spielprinzip? Genau, eine fesselnde Story!
Diese ist auch sehr gut gelungen, wie ich finde. (Ohne zu viel zu Spoilern)
Der tragische Held wacht eines Morgens auf und sitzt im Gefängnis, aus Gründen, die er wegen einer Amnesie nicht erklären kann. Bei einem Ausbruchversuch, gabelt er zwei neue Freunde auf, einen knorzigen Zwerg und einen schwerenötigen Magier. Auf ihrer Suche nach den Antworten des Haupthelden gabeln sie weitere Mitstreiter auf, darunter auch Bekannte aus der Vergangenheit des Helden, verlieren einige Freunde, nehmen Rache und stellen schließlich fest, das der eigentliche Böse gar nicht der Böse war, sondern das der wahre Feind eigentlich der ist, dem man am meisten vertraut hatte. 

An sich ein solides Konzept, mit den üblichen Stärken und Schwächen.
Hat man sich verskillt, so hat man am Ende ganz schöne Probleme. Oder man reagiert nicht rechtzeitig auf eine bestimmte Situation und verliert einen Helden.
Wer an diesen Dingen aber Spaß findet, kann Blackguards beruhigt einkaufen. :)

Vous aurez donc à gérer, hors combat, tous les points de vos personnages afin d'avoir une équipe solide.

Pour ce qui est du système de combat, j'ai apprécié le fait de la rapidité (ou non) appellée initiative.
Les personnages (alliés/ennemis) que vous controlez ou non n'obtiennent pas leur tour tous en même temps mais en fonction de leur initiative. 
Il est possible de joueur en ""deux temps"", si vous effectuez un petit déplacement, laisse le tour continuer, votre personnage pourra agir ensuite si vous ne vous êtes pas déplacez trop loin. 

Les maps sont très variées, avec généralement des éléments de décors interactifs (passif, quand on marche dessus par exemple ou pour se mettre à couvert mais aussi actif pour inverser le cours du combat). 
Les effets de zones, qu'ils viennent d'un allié ou du décor, se répercutent aussi sur les membres de votre groupe.

Le seul petit point négatif que j'ai pu relever est les chances de rater qui sont assez importantes.

The Good
- Battle system is good.
- The Storyline is great.
- Limited sidequest available.
- Weapons & spells are extremely unique (only when you upgrade spells & weapon skills).
- You can use environmental traps.
- Battle skills & abilities are real great & useful.

The Bad
- This game is so reallistic that when you buy too many items & weapons pass your limit, it'll cause your characters to do negatively poor in combat (depends on the weight of items).
- If your not well prepared before events or battles, you'll have a tough time trying to complete that scenario.

¿Es Blackguards un mal juego? No. ¿Lo recomiendo? Pues tampoco. 

Me explico un poco. Blackguards sigue el reglamento de un juego de rol alemán llamado 'Dark Eye'. Por lo tanto hereda para el combate sus virtudes y defectos. Y para mí ese reglamento tiene más defectos que virtudes por lo que he visto. Encima el juego no te da casi pistas de para que valen las puntuaciones de las hojas de personaje así que andarás más perdido que un pulpo en un garaje al principio. Dicen por ahí que cuando llevas bastantes horas empiezas a enterarte y entonces el juego mola. Yo le he dedicado bastantes y creo que sé por donde van los tiros pero... sigue sin molarme. En el Baldur's Gate (por poner un ejemplo comparativo) también usaban al dedillo el reglamento del juego de mesa (en ese caso AD&D) pero yo creo que explicaban bastante mejor el funcionamiento básico del combate en el videojuego.

Una cosa que me ha fastidiado hasta abandonar el juego es que aparte de tu tasa de ataque los combatientes tienen una habilidad de defensa. Entonces tú te enfrentas a un bicho y dices: vaya, tengo un 70% de posibilidades de darle, a por él. Y sí, le das... pero como él esquiva ya no le das. Hala. A fastidiarse. Por eso muchas veces estarás pegándote piños con gente sin que nadie llegue a acertar a nadie. Sí que es cierto que se aplica a ambos bandos y que sólo se puede esquivar a un oponente por asalto, pero como normalmente el que está superado en número es el grupo del jugador la cosa queda bastante descompensada. Además esto hace que el combate sea impredecible y, para mí, pierda muchos puntos de estrategia.

Además como digo los desarrolladores no se han esforzado demasiado en explicar para que vale cada cosa por lo que cuando empiezas a jugar vas subiendo de nivel sin saber demasiado bien que te conviene subir o que no. En mi caso lo dejé cuando me metí en un combate en el que parece que era vital el mago y le fallaban todos los hechizos porque no pasaba una tirada de Constitución. ¿Y yo como debería haber adivinado eso? Si es tan importante ¡que lo avisen de alguna manera a los novatos! 

Encima al principio empiezas con un equipo mínimo y, la verdad, cuesta bastante conseguir el oro suficiente como para no parecer un pordiosero y comprar algo con lo que zurrarle a los enemigos. Ahora ya sé lo que sienten mis jugadores de rol en mesa cuando les racaneo objetos (sí, lo tengo merecido, soy un director de juego rata). 

Y sin embargo y pese a todo Blackguards tiene suficiente encanto como para que haya perdido un montón de horas intentando dominar el juego. La historia, sin ser de echar tracas, está bien. El personaje del mago es muy carismático y el grupo lo forman un trío de inadaptados bastante simpático. Las conversaciones entre ellos son entretenidas. El sistema de combate, si no llega a tener la peste de las esquivas, sería bueno. Porque además puedes usar el escenario a tu favor (se pueden accionar ciertos elementos en cada fase).

Hasta donde yo llegué en la campaña la cosa era bastante lineal. Había algunas opciones secundarias pero vamos... que esto va de buscar una disculpa para cada combate.

Me queda un sabor agridulce al no poder recomendarlo pero, sinceramente, no me ha convencido.

You could say, tough luck, it is your own fault, because you made the wrong choices. 
And I grant you that. 

But how can I make the right choices when I do not know the strengths and weaknesses of these abilities? And how can I foresee that the story seriously impacts the functioning of my party?  At two moments in the game you will be inflicted with a setback that unhinges your party's fighting power. Once, one of the party members gets killed because the story is written that way. And at another time her replacement, a magic user, gets robbed of her ability to do magic and so thousands of points sunk in developing her magic powers becomes nullified with one stroke. 
So you might expect that the game takes this into account, but not at all: you cannot undo your choices nor does the game allow you to make up for the loss of a valuable party member.

This then, in a nutshell, is the problem with Blackguards.. 

This game is very much like searching for keys to doors, while you do not know which key opens which door, you do not know if a door leads to anything useful, you do not know when or if you will find the key or the door to which it belongs and you might find  that the keys and doors disappeared before you actually could make use of them. 
So what is left is to go back to an earlier point in the game and find the right keys to the right doors: make the right choices. And unfortunately you might have to go a long way back: perhaps all the way to the beginning.

And then another issue pops up.

Blackguards is  basically a tactical battle simulator in which the battles are linked together by a thin storyline that gives the battles context. You will find that many of the common characteristics of a roleplay game are underdeveloped. For one, your party members are a given and so are their classes. Do not expect that you can build your own party. 
Furthermore there are few choices in equipment so your party will be running around with the same armor and weapons for long stretches.  And while many places have shops, you will only visit them to restock your supplies. 
But the crucial issue is that the story is simply too linear. While at some point you can select what to do first, you will be unable to change the storyline in any significant way. And because the story isn't really special at all, redoing this game just so you can change your characters is not enough of an incentive to go through the game again..

Even as a tactical battle simulator the game leaves much to be desired. For instance you are unable to determine the setup of your party members. More often than not the game gleefully shoves your more vulnerable members, your magic users, in the front line.  Hilarious is the ability to set traps. You have almost no time to set traps, let alone set the traps that actually make  difference. The traps are expensive, the relevant skill requires a massive amount of points and you have only a very limited amount of traps.  
In addition some battles confront you with a special setup that is pivotal to the battle, often without explaining to you the specifics. In one battle, for instance, you will be able to make use of automated flamethrowers. But the game doesn't explain this to you, nor do you know what the impact is until you have seen their effect and you figured out how to operate them. It therefore requires you to redo the battle at least once.
Some battles are practically unwinnable until you achieve a certain level, or develop a certain ability to a certain level.

Is it all bad then?

Actually no.
When I went through the game the first time I actually was entertained. The game uses what I call the fall out principle. The fall out principle is that you start out as a nobody and then gradually start to make a difference when the story unfolds. This is the reverse of what you might call the dragon age effect in which  it is clear from the start that you are a special person destined to make a difference.
Personally I prefer the first angle to the last. 
Also the characters are amusing, even though, or perhaps because, they are so cliche. The remarks of the Naurim, the grumpy dwarf, are pretty funny and in line of what you might expect from a dwarf: a fighter who distrusts magic users and elves. 
The story, although linear, has a few twists and also there is some emotional connection as it involves a friend and later on a family member. It isn't also clearcut that the enemy is actually bad and it leaves things fuzzy  for a long time.
So it seems to me that if you go once through the game(using a game guide to form your party) then you might probably be entertained.

Blackguard is a nice filler when you are in between better games. Pick it up when it is in the bargain bin and around five dollars or euros or less.

Balckguards is challenging tactical RPG great focus on tacital, the characters strenghts are based of of the skill points you allocate into different areas such as weapon profficancy and constitution, and to note you can only carry four items per character in battle that includes arrows.  Combat is the typical turn based Hex grid goto but this is when the game can be a pain, traps are invisible of course you can take an action to scan the area around you for them, BUT to scan furthur areas you must move another character into the area avoiding the traps that are reveal. Movement is crap, the Hex grid makes thing wonky and you end up having the character accidentally move through a trap, inflicting damage, possible status effects, and ending their turn. If you don't end up walking through a trap on your way to the empty space you will likely hit a trap that is still hidden. Also the  AI opponents know where the traps are so unless it plays stupid and tries to make it's way to a weakend ally it will almost never hit them.

・序盤の理不尽さ
・説明のなさすぎるシステムと要素
・運要素がでかすぎる
・ユニット育成型ではなく、どのステージも経験値や報酬アイテムが固定で下手に進めて育成していくと詰む
・細かなロードディングがうっとおしい

序盤抜けたところまでしかやってませんが、イライラの連続でとてもじゃないがもうお腹いっぱいです
システムをやっと理解するところまで続けると、ゲームクリアどうでも良くなってきます
一番プレイを阻害するのは「説明のなさすぎるシステムと要素」です
戦闘中のオブジェクトなどの説明はチュートリアル的なものがあり、教えてはくれますが大事な「スキル」についての説明はほぼなく、簡単な分だけ読んでもさっぱりで何が何に影響するのかも分かりません、俺もよくワカラナイので説明しようがないです

そのわからない状態で「運要素がでかすぎる」と「序盤の理不尽さ」です
初期状態のパーティは３人で、その上まともな装備は手に入らず、店買いのアイテムはクソ高く、戦闘で手に入れた固定の報酬を全部売り払わないと買えないレベル、そして何を鍛えればいいのか不明なスキル群
そして襲いかかる敵の強さと一体何を信じればいいのかわからない運要素で、敵の数は多いしすぐに囲みにくる、攻撃力は敵のほうが高いし、装備を揃えようが敵にダメージが入らない、敵の攻撃が連続で当たるがコッチの攻撃は全部避けられる、攻撃成功確率９５％あろうが避けられます、そのうえ急にトラップやらなんやらが即死級のダメージ持ってきます、もうやだ

じっくりとやる人なら楽しいかもしれませんが、それ以外の良いSRPGやったことある人はわざわざコッチやらなくてもいいです

Quite an hard game with some harder difficulty-spike in some point but nothing exceeding. It's about 60 hours game .
Here i put some advice that i would have needed .

General advice:
- Let Naurim tank,he will tank everything on the earth. 
-Buffs,debuffs and almost all spell at level 4 hit the entire map. (for exemple u can buff your entire team or debuff their )
-check all spell teacher to get passives,mage are dumb cows without accuracy passive.
-at the beginning seems that all mage spell has low chance to hit,when you up em and get accuracy passive almost all abilities have 99% chance.
-heals are very important,get em at least al lvl 3 ,pretty nice to heal your wounds.
-CHECK THE ENVIRONMENT,it will always semplify battles.

Starter Class Advices:

first 50% of the game: 
-Normal attack damage class ,specifically 2 Handed weapon  or archer are insanely strong .
-Mages are nice but you've not lvl 4 spells and suffer cause of low mana. 
-hybrid is overpowered: get for example an archer + increased ranged damage buffs.( same for melee)

Other 50%
-Normal attack damage class are still strong,lot of hp,dodge,and damage. (melee weapons with poison are pretty nice)
-Mages now can annihilate an entire battle alone. Just with lvl4  flame spear ,evel 4 shield  and level 3 thunder globe.
-Archers with buffs are still overpowered.

PROS : 
1)You can Customize your chars a lot and its real, REAL REAL delight it reminds the good old rpg with lot of customizing.
2)Epic dialogues, the voices are awesome.
3) Real strategy, some battles are pretty hard. 
4) Unlike a LOT of games you dont have a lot of gold during the game so you got to be cautious with what you are doing with it.
5)Game is ""quite"" long, for exemple it took me 30 hours to finish pillars of eternity max difficulty where i needed 48h for this one.

CONS : 
1)Poison everywhere on the 2nd half of the game. (its pretty boring to have your mage cleansing poison and wasting turns/energy on this).
2)Piercing weapons are bad (you cant hit undead with it, and most of the important ""items"" you need to destroy are immune to piercing damages but it's pretty fine if you havent more than one char in the team using it).
3)Game is too linear though for me i appreciated (as i said dialogues are awesome). 

I would give it 15-16/20 grade. A fair good game while waiting for Torment Tides of Numenera.

Framed and tortured by the one you called your friend, you make your escape with a few other prisoners, trying to find out the truth behind the accusations against you. This review takes into account the Untold Legends DLC.

[b]Pros[/b]: Nice game with enough mechanical depth to offer a variety of gameplay styles: rather than level-based progression, you spend adventure points on anything from attributes, weapon skills, spells and perks and determine exactly how specialized you become with your various talents. The story isn't of a great hero, but of someone who won't leave a mark on history, making your way in shady towns and accepting questionable quests, especially in the multiple side quests added by the [i]Untold Legend DLC[/i] where you must take stances on subjects such as slavery. Graphics are good enough for the genre, tactical maps are clean, most of which have interactive environment elements you might use against your foes if they don't use them against you. The game is sufficiently balanced, and even with the occasional difficulty spikes, you can jump right back in the last encounter to try things differently.

[b]Cons[/b]: Many will find the depth to be a bit too much, scrolling through 5 pages of skills and perks will make it hard to figure the best way to optimize your character. There is a limited variety of equipment, especially armor. The story is pretty linear and not all that complex. The odds of success aren't mushed, so 95% chance of success might still miss, multiple times, in a row, which will frustrate anyone who isn't used to rolling dices. The music is somber, and sucks life and excitement out of the game whenever you're not in a combat situation.

[b]Verdict[/b]: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you

This is an ok RPG. It is definitively ported directly from its tabletop RPG roots, which might feel very ""meh"" to the average gamer. I still recommend it, just make sure you also get the [i]Untold Legend DLC[/i], or you'll feel the game is short on side-quests.

Based on this price I think Blackguards is definitely worth it. The full price of £29.99 is however WAY off the mark for the amount of game you get (hint: not much) 

Despite me finishing the game in 40 hours, it is a very combat focused where pretty much every event you’ll encounter will be a fight. Whilst this is fun to begin with, as a lot of battle maps are quite interesting, after 20 odd hours it just got tiresome. After every cut scene, conversation, exploration, etc I knew I would be fighting something. So you can imagine my utter delight when after defeating the final boss, the final cut-scene was just that a cut-scene!

Outside of combat there is unfortunately very little to the game, hence I only recommend it at a steep discount. There is no exploration to speak off, the town screens are static and the story kind of gets lots amongst 180 fight scenes you’ll have to slog through. 

I also have a few gripes about the story, but these could just be personal preferences. For example, I don’t see how this is a “dark” story as it seems very much like any other RPG where you-are-our-only-hope-to-save-the-world story (spoiler: you save it). Also this games is called Blackguards and makes the point of your character being an outlaw. I was picturing more of a vagabond, a mercenary on the run, or some petty thief down and on his luck. What I wasn’t expecting however was for my character to be buddies with a PRINCES whilst chilling at a home of a COUNT in the first “memory” cutscene. Less of a BlackGuard, more of a Brodude! Also in this game you have no meaningful choice – it really just railroads you along the main story-line with some side-quests where you have a choice between killing guy A or guy B... with no impact on main story-line. 

A lot of negative reviews about this game are regarding the dodgy RNG, and whilst I have encountered some odd miss on a 95% chance, I have never experienced a 3 in a row miss. If you read the manual and understand how the rules work. The % you see isn’t the % to inflict damage, but rather to do an action, then the enemy gets a couple of saving rolls – parry / dodge. So you might have successfully rolled an action, but then the enemy might have rolled a saving throw and so all you see is your guy missing or spell fizzing out.",1431559491,1431559887,True,3,0,0.536769747734069824,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Взяв в одну руку меч/топор/шпагу/кинжал, в другой щит, передвинув ползунок в защиту.

Отразить, за раунд, можно только 1 удар, со скилом «Защитная поза» - 2. Поэтому танк со щитом не эффективен. С любым двуручным оружием блок не опустится ниже 14. Разницу в блоке вы не заметите, а дамаг выростет очень сильно.  И вообще, ваш персонаж чаще будет уворачиваться, чем блокировать.

б. В игре к вам присоединится Такате, воин с копьем. Докачиваем копье в макс и бьем смертелным ударом.Копье бьет через 1 клетку, очень удобно наносить раны противнику из-за спины своего товарища. 
в. Оружие в обеих руках, не имеет смысла. Атака, по умолчанию, с одной руки. Плюс, появится 1 скил - «Простая атака с двух рук», сильно не выиграете.
г. 2H мечи и дробящее.  Лучше качать дробящее. В игре очень мало защиты к дробящему, но попадается иммунитеты к мечам и копьям. Качаем ветку до: «Удар молотом».  [b]Ударом молота[/b], под бафами, можно выбить до 90 хп с одного удара.

3 война. С 2H, вынесут любого с 1-3 ударов, и станут щитом для магов. Если надо подставить война как танка (иммунный голем), просто пропускайте для война ход, когда не двигаешься  защита возростает.

[b]4. Нужны ли луки? [/b]

В игре есть бои, которые без лука, практически, не проходимы. Бои на болоте, против гигантского цветка с щупальцами. Цветок имунен, практически, ко всем видам урона и имеет очень большие показатели уворота. Раздаете всем, луки/арбалеты, и стреляем в цветок. Даже если не качать, цветок легко выносится. 
Кроме этого, лук/арбалет вам пригодится на финальном боссе. В первой стадии, он, обожает телепортироваться. Дамага большого луки они не делают, можно, ронять/выносить вражеских магов на галёрке. Но проще «контролить» их магами.

[b]5. Экспеллиармус и бафы[/b]

Удар грома/Игнификус/Желчь ведьмы/Ледяной шок/Игнисферо — все наносит не очень большой дамаг, 3-4 уровней эффективнее, но останетесь без маны. Лучше магами только добивать или  когда все войны заняты/далеко. 
Из обязательных заклинаний: 
Бальзам исцеления и Плевок ведьмы — лечилки. Маги в этой игре в основном суппорты, и вытягивать войнов, и самих себя, с того света, будут в основном они. 	
Гнев стихий —  дамаг + контроль.
Щит мага — Стоишь за спиной воинов прикрывая их от заклинаний.

[b]Ловкость кошки+Вспышка[/b]. 4 уровня. И в течении 4 ходов, войны выносят почти всех противников. Так как шанс Смертельного удара и Удар молотом становится 70-95%. Кроме того высокий уворот.",1431270235,1431270549,True,15,0,0.60241234302520752,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is linear in nature like most tactical RPGs, it is still engaging enough to keep you playing.


What could of been an exceptional tactical RPG, is heavilly mared by the skewerd RNG.  Enemies with ludecrously low hit chances will regularly hit, while your group with ludecriously high chances to hit will miss quite often.  This simply plays out this way the entire game.

Many of the enemy hits will impose effects but you wont resist them because of penalites of unknown oragin making the skills you developed to resist them, meaningless.  Likewise Enemies will constantly resist your statuses because aparently you dont apply the same penalities to them.

This would be fine for the most part if enemies did similare damage to your group, sadly they typically will almost always do about 50% more, leaving you to scratch your head wondering why.  

In general enemies will always be better than or equal to your group in combat, even if they happen to be some merchant or alchemist they will be exceptional warriors none the less.  They also wont give you the gear they are using (aparently that vanishes in a puff of smoke when they die)

Again this woud be fine through the use of tactics.  However the RNG issues will often destroy the best tactics you can bring to the table.

Plenty of places have traps everywhere and the non-enviromental ones will let the enemies happilly walk over with without triggering them.

At the end of the day unless you are happy to ignore the RNG issues and vague information on many of the combat aspects, I cant really recomened Blackguards (hopefully the second one has improved those issues).

Zu Beginn kann man unter 3 Klassen wählen: Magier, Krieger oder Bogenschütze. Jeder Charakter besitzt insgesamt 3 Waffenslots. Für jede bestandene Aufgabe erhalten die Charaktere Abenteuer-Punkte, die man für die diversen Fähigkeiten, Waffenskills, Grundwerte, Zauber etc.... ausgeben kann. Die Skillmöglichkeiten sind wirklich äußerst umfangreich, für Anfänger wie mich allerdings auch etwas verwirrend. Viel verwendete Skills lassen sich bequem in eine Schnelleiste ziehen.

Es gibt viele Nebenquests und die Geschichte ist nicht linear, sondern bietet auch hier und da Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten!

Kampfsystem:
- Rundenbasiert
- Hexfelder
- interaktive Gegenstände

Als einzigstes Manko empfinde ich das Zufallsprinzip im Kampf. So kann es sein das Zauber oder Waffenfähigkeiten mehrfach hintereinander nicht treffen und einem Gegner dadurch ganz schön zu schaffen machen oder man sogar verliert. Wiederholt man den Kampf, flutscht dieser dann auf einmal wie Butter. Da man aber viele Speichermöglichkeiten hat, ist das zum Glück nicht all zu tragisch oder frustrierend!

Oyunumuz Blackguard , The Whispered World'un de yapımcısı olan Alman firması Daedalic Entartainment tarafından  Steam üzerinden satışa sürülmüş bir taktiğe dayalı rol yapma oyunu.(Tactical RPG).

Hikayemize prensesi öldürmekle suçlanan (kim bilir belki ...) biri olarak hapiste başlıyoruz.Orada karşılaştığımız Naurim adlı müthiş balta kullanan dwarf kardeşimiz ve usta bir o kadar da çapkın büyücümüz Zurbaran Florios'la oyunumuza devam ediyoruz.Bunlara cadı Aurelia , Gıllıalidyator Takate ve keş kadın Niam da ekleniyor.Oyunda zaman zaman flashbacklerle geçmişe dönüyor ve hikayeyi çözmeye devam ediyoruz.Yeri geliyor bir ağaç kurdu karşılığı bir orc un canını bağışlıyor, yeri geliyor size işkence edenleri hunharca katlediyoruz.Tabi seçimler size kalmış.

Oyunda karakterlerimizi turn based olarak yönetiyoruz.Her savaş ve görev sonunda macera puanı dediğimiz MP leri alarak karakterlerimizi upgrade ediyoruz.Oyunda kılıç,eskrim,hançer,mızrak,balta,çift elli balta,iki elli kılıç,asa, arbalet ve yay olmak üzere 10 silahımız var bunun yanına kemerimize takabildiğimiz fırlatma baltası cirit can potu gibi itemlarımız da var.
Karakterimizde silah yeteneğimizi,talentlarımızı,büyülerimizi bir de default niteliklerimizi geliştirebileceğimiz 4 MP harcama sayfamız var.Bunları eğitmenlerde geliştirerek savaş sırasında çeşitli bonuslar elde edebiliyorsunuz.

Savaşlarda tuzaklara dikkat etmek gerekiyor.Aynı zamanda v tuşuna basarak etkileşime geçebileceğiniz yerleri de kırmızı olarak görebilirsiniz.Bazen delirmişcesine can basmak gerekiyor bazen hunharca adamları ezip geçiyorsunuz.Bazen de o savaşı geçebilmek için defalarca oynamanız gerekiyor.Her bölümün kendine has taktikleri var. Ama o kadar korkmayın finale gelene kadar bekleyin (zuhahahaha -erol taş efekti ile) .

Oynanışta space ve enter tuşlarını dünya mapine dönmek için savaşta ise adamımıza turn atlatmak için kullanıyoruz.Yukardaki yanlış hatırlamıyorsam 9 boş kutuya fast skill atıyabiliyoruz bu da güzel bir fonksiyon olmuş.Tabi bunu ilk oyunu bitirişimde sadece sol tık yuvarlaktan eli seç ordan skilli seç yöntemiyle oynadığım için de söylüyor olabilirim.

Grafik olarak gayet iyi.Savaş animasyonları zayıf kalmış. Gılıçla vurdum öldü . Sadece Buz Örtüsü adını verdiğimiz tüm düşmanlara damage veren büyü yapılırken biraz render sorunu yaşanıyor.Bunun yanına bir de bassı fazla kaçmış tipi eklenince olmamış.Orası hariç oyun gayet iyi.

Ek olarak oyunda kendiliğinden Türkçe dil desteği olması benden 1 artı daha alıyor.Sonuç olarak oyun oynanabilir bir oyun Psp'de bulunan Lord Of The Rings Tactics oyununu sevdiyseniz bunu da seversiniz.

Also the only thing you do in this game is fight from one end to the the other end that's all you do but I like a game where there is more to concentrate on than just brawling and that could be done in many ways for instance crafting.  Well there were one or two spots where at least you could do some shopping if you had the money for it however this is a game you start dirt poor and you don't get any wealthier the winning of a fight brings you but little and in coin the same. So you might well ask what was good then and well even if that's all you did was battle, the battles most were original giving you choices to play differently. And I heard that it was the best to start your player of as a mage and go the middle road while still being able to play warrior if you wanted. Yet I found I had two good mages or ranged fighters from the others that joined your group so I'm glad I started mine of as warrior and could sink my points into him just being a strong player.

От каждого из жанров игре досталась часть характерных черт: от тактики – сражения отрядом на гексагональной карте в пошаговом режиме; от рпг - система игровой механики, наличие диалогов, квестов, экипировка персонажей. Однако во всем есть подвох. Состав вашего отряда определяется сюжетом, новые бойцы будут приходить и уходить вне зависимости от ваших желаний, а нанимать других невозможно. Львиная доля удовольствия от игры заключается в том, как сделаны карты и какие условия на них надо выполнять. Все карты разные, никакой генерации, каждая сделана штучно и заполнена интерактивными объектами, ловушками, различными препятствиями (в т.ч. теми, которые можно уничтожить или использовать). К примеру, переверните груду ящиков и получите препятствие для врагов и укрытие для своего отряда. А если перевернуть ящики на головы противников, то те будут обездвижены. Такие объекты на картах хорошо разнообразят игру. Во многих боях вам будут ставить дополнительные цели – победить за определенное количество ходов, не дать какому-нибудь персонажу умереть, довести отряд до зоны выхода и т.д. и т.п., причем если такие условия будут, то и противники будут вам мешать. Чаще всего это неплохо развлекает, но в отельных случаях необходимость выполнения определенной цели, вместо обычного боя, раздражает. Особенно, если учесть неслабую рандомность игры в отношение вероятности попадания по цели, крита, величины дамага, кастования заклинаний. На начальных этапах игры это сильно бросается в глаза: ваш боец не попал при шансе в 80%, прошел на две клетки вперед, поскользнулся и упал в лужу, а враг выбил по нему критическое попадание? Все. Победа превращается в поражение, будете переигрывать заново.

Собственно, игра и состоит из этих самые боев, между которыми вы копаетесь в инвентаре персов, читаете диалоги, торгуете и выбираете на глобальный карте какой квест вы будете выполнять следующим. И конечно же: развиваете своих героев, прокачивая их характеристики. Тут стоит остановится подробней. В основе механики – настолка  The Dark Eye. И конкретно в этой игре халявы не ждите – вам придется разобраться в том как тут все работает, иначе вы не продвинетесь дальше первых глав, т.к. реализована система достаточно скрупулезно, в игре масса характеристик, навыков, атрибутов, умений, все взаимосвязано, и если не понимать что делать можно легко «запороть» прокачку персонажа. 

Трудно однозначно рекомендовать эту игру любителям того или иного жанра – для классической тактики в ней слишком многое ампутировано, рпг-составляющая тоже пострадала. Симбиоз получился необычный снаружи, но с серьезной механикой внутри.

Save Your Games Often. SYGO.

Lore: This games has a great story, or maybe just a good one, but with great soundtrack. Every time the action stops to give me some of the story, be it only with voice over or with a cinematic, it makes me feel like sitting back, dimming the light, lighting up a cigar (I don't smoke cigars, wtf) and just getting immersed in that world. It works. Oh and SYGO.

Graphics: Every graphics outside of the spells and backdrops are ok for a turn-based strategy game, cinematics or gameplay. The backdrops are nice. But the spells are one notch above that. They are cool. Let just say that after 80 hours, I'd gladly skip the crossbow animation in order to save 4 seconds every time, but I'd keep the spells any day of the week. 

Gameplay: I recommend you name your character SYGO. I didn't. I should have. Now I need to restart from scratch. Don't just SYGO. Keep them. You'll need them. This game is unforgiving as it leads you to think that you'll need this skill and that skill in order to make it, yet it surprises you (too) many times with different tactics and resistance to particular damage. If you can finish this game without a single hint from the internet, a walkthrough or without ever needing to backtrack yourself once to change some skill points (let alone back track yourself 40 hours to change almost everything...) you are a God amongst humans. 

TL/DR: One of the best turn-based game I've played, as enjoyable as your favorite HOMM or Civ. Poor DLC value, very good base value. If you don't want a good challenge (60 hours) that kinda forces you into restarting at least once the game from scratch (do I hear 120 hours?), then this might not be for you. Only negative thing is that I'm really dissapointed that the dev made a Blackguards 2 instead of adding more than one DLC to this game. Did I mentioned SYGO? Yeah, SYGO. Or cry.

I experienced 2 bugs during my gameplay, once the game crashed when trying to add a new save to my list of game saves and once when casting a spell in battle, nothing happened after the casting animation so I had to crash out and re-load the battle.

As for game play and story line, you can tell this game was not finished when it was released due to the map being more than twice the size of the actual parts of the map you explore during the game. I found the ending very anticlimactic. The whole game is fully voice acted, yet the ending has a few words show up at the bottom of the screen over some scenic views... There is no obvious resolution to anything in the storyline and you are not told how the choices you made throughout the game have affected the outcome of the ending, meaning if you were to replay the game you wouldn't know what to do differently.

The game is visually very nice and the voice acting is good, although some times in battle I had a mans voice sound when I hit a female enemy and vice versa.

It's just extremely mediocre.  If you're into D&D alternatives and dig X-Com, it probably won't waste your time.  But I can't recommend it for most people.

The character customization is surprisingly lacking, despite the illusion of choice.  There are twice as many attributes as a D&D system, but they all just sum together to increase your attack, dodge chance, initiative, etc.  There are only a handful of combat abilities to use, so there's not a lot of choice as far stabbing/shooting.  The magic users are more nuanced; there are a ton of spells, each with 4 tiers, so you're constantly weighing the cost/benefit of those.

Combat itself is very similar to X-Com or D&D 4.0: you get either a move and an action, or a double move.  This all occurs on a hex-grid, and most maps have some sort of interactable element to spice it up.  They do an admirable attempt to differentiate the levels, but you will take place in about a billion combat scenarios, so a lot of them inevitably feel repetitive.  You'll probably be skipping side quests by the end out of boredom.

The plot is pretty linear.  There are batches of side quests that open up at various points, but none of them augment the main plot line at all.  It's your typical RPG ""save my daughter"" or ""escort my caravan"" kind of stuff.

Als reiner Text:
Bei Balckguards handelt es sich um ein Taktik-Rollenspiel von Daedalic im Das Schwarze Auge Universum.
Oder zumindest sollte es das sein. Um mein Fazit vorweg zu nehmen verkommt das Spiel meiner Meinung nach schlussendlich mehr zu einem Glückspuzzler, bei dem die einzelnen Puzzles durch eine Story zusammengetackert wurden.

Aber fangen wir erst einmal bei dem Setting an, das an sich noch sehr vielversprechend ist:
Wir spielen einen Charakter, den wir frei generieren können, und der zu Beginn des Spiels im Kerker landet, da er für Schuldig befunden wird eine Prinzessin getötet zu haben. Zusammen mit einem verrückten Zwerg, der hinter allem eine Verschwörung sieht, und einem Magier, der wohl einen Schritt zu weit gegangen ist, um mit einer Adligen im Bett zu landen, brechen wir dann aus dem Gefängnis aus und begeben uns auf der Suche nach dem wahren Mörder.

Der Spielfluss ist dabei so, dass wir von einem Schlachtfeld zum nächsten gehen und zwischendurch ein paar Dialoge führen. Und auch ein paar optionale Quests mit Entscheidungen gibt es. Im Kern des Spiels stehen aber ganz klar eben jene Schlachtfelder.

Und gerade diese Schlachtfelder machen einfach keinen Spaß. Warum das so ist, liegt an vielen Dingen gleichzeitig. Vor allem zu Beginn sind diese Schlachtfelder winzig, so dass man im Grunde auch nicht viel Spielraum hat, die Charaktere anders zu bewegen oder ganz grundsätzlich etwas anders zu machen als wie es das spezifische Schlachtfeld für einen vorsieht. Ein paar mal ist es sogar so, dass der Gegner zuerst zieht und noch im ersten Zug vor einem steht. Nun sind aber die Erfolgschancen von Schlägen, Schüssen und Zaubern so extrem glücksabhängig und der Spielraum der Schadenshöhen so groß, dass der Kampf vor allem zum frustigen Glücksspiel wird. Das Spiel suggeriert auch, dass man in vielen Schlachtfeldern mit Objekten interagieren kann. So beispielsweise im Tutorial, in dem man einen Kronleuchter auf Gegner fallen lassen kann. In der Praxis gibt es so etwas aber eher selten und wenn es dann einmal so etwas gibt, dann muss man zuerst einmal einen Kampf dafür verwenden um zu schauen, wo genau dieser Kronleuchter denn dann landet, um dann neu zu starten und das in seinem Puzzle zur Lösung des Schlachtfeldes einzubauen.
Ich hatte ausserdem das Gefühl, dass sich die Entwickler nur sehr wenig Gedanken darum gemacht haben, was für Mechaniken in einem Computerspiel Sinn machen und welche nicht. Viel Frust und Ladeorgien hätte man sich sparen können indem man ein paar Spielmechaniken abgewandelt hätte.
Ganz vorn ist beispielsweise, dass man ausserhalb des Kampfes nur gegen Kosten heilen kann.
Innerhalb des Kampfes geht es allerdings auch ohne, indem man am Ende des Kampfes zig runden mit einem Gegner spazieren geht, dadurch jede Runde Mana regeneriert und diese Mana dann wiederum zum heilen verwendet. Es gibt auch einige Kämpfe, die sich durch wildes hin und her Ziehen der Gegner ganz einfach gewinnen lassen. Das führt natürlich dazu, dass gerade das Ende vieler Kämpfe todlangweilig wird.
Bleiben wir noch einen Moment beim Heilen: Will man ausserhalb des Kampfes eine Bandage verwenden, die man für teures Gold erworben hat, gibt es dort ebenfalls eine Chance es zu verpatzen. Das führt natürlich dann dazu, dass man einfach wieder in den Ladebildschirm abtaucht und es erneut versucht. Schließtlich ist Gold keine endlose Ressource in dem Spiel und so möchte man gut damit haushalten.
So ziehen sich die Mechaniken im Grunde durch das ganze Spiel. Der normale Spielfluss eines Abschnittes ist, dass man in das Schlachtfeld hinein geht, herumprobiert, lernt, was das Schlachtfeld von einem will, dann gegebenenfalls einen Spielstand vor dem Schlachtfeld lädt um Vorbereitungen anzupassen, und dann im Schlachtfeld den Lösungsweg abarbeitet und hofft, dass der Zufall einem keine Stöcke, bzw ganze Bretter, zwischen die Beine wirft, durch die man dann neu laden muss. Zuguterletzt noch ein paar duzend Runden zum Heilen drangehängt und weiter geht es.


Nun kommt aber auch hinzu, dass die Technik des Spiels nicht auf der Höhe ist. Die Grafik ist nicht besonders gut und es fühlt sich trotzdem nicht ganz flüssig an. Die ersten paar Minuten bestehen bereits aus einem Intro, das ähnlich billig wirkt wie die ersten 3D Intros der 90er, aus abgehackten Dialogen und aus wild herumzuckenden Charaktermodellen.
Dann gibt es da noch ein grausiges Interface, das unübersichtlich ist, bei dem viele Erklärungen fehlen und das sich vor allem im Kampf hakelig anfühlt.
Das Charaktersystem von ""Das Schwarze Auge"" ist bereits so schon recht komplex und kompliziert und darüber hinaus möchte ich auch an dieser Stelle garnicht darauf eingehen. Aber gerade dort wäre ein vernünftiges Interface extrem hilfreich gewesen. Sehr schön ist auch, dass viele Erklärungen zu Interface-Elementen erst zu einem Zeitpunkt auftauchen, zu dem man diese schon X mal nutzen musste.

Zur Länge des Spiels sei kurz angemerkt, dass man mit etwa 40 Spielstunden für das Basisspiel auf dem mittleren Schwierigkeitsgrad rechnen kann. Ich habe es allerdings nach 20 Stunden auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad Schwer abgebrochen.

Schlussendlich kann ich damit dem Spiel abgesehen von der Ausgangs-Story nicht viel positives abgewinnen. 

Das Debakel um die Collectors Edition hat es ebenfalls nicht besser gemacht. So haben Käufer der CE nicht nur auf einen Rabatt der Digitalen Version verzichtet, auf Early Access verzichtet, länger auf Release warten müssen als Spieler der Digitalen Version, sondern die CE beinhaltet auch keinen Steam Key, und der einzige Weg damit an die rein Digitale Erweiterung zu kommen, ist es diese auf der Platform Gamesrocket zu kaufen. Dafür wiederum liegen der CE Ingame Gegenstände bei, die das Balancing komplett zerstören.

Von mir gibt es daher einen klaren Daumen nach unten und ich würde das Spiel wirklich niemandem empfehlen. Wo Daedalic für Point & Click Adventures ein sehr gutes Händchen hat, haben sie leider bei diesem Rollenspiel gezeigt, das Spiele mit komplexeren Systemen nicht ihr Ding sind.",1426542231,1426542231,False,48,2,0.738343954086303711,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Game style is squad turned base tactical strategy and has a lot of customization within normal high fantasy.  You have the ability to play Fighters, Mages and Archers of varrying types.

Fighters - two-handed, dual weild, sword and board, single handed
Damage types - slash, bash and penetration

Mages - Customization is really based on your ability to find and afford training the spells.  They start out weak, mid game are super powerful and in the end of the game are better at buffing your Master Archer and Two-Hand DPS meleer

Archers - You get 4 skills, 2 early on, extra damage shot, bypass armor shot and then later 3 arrows dps on single target (highest damage I can find in game) and then AoE rain of arrows.  Past that there is 1 good bow in game and Crossbow users can use those abilities it seems so 1 archer should do.  My main character was my archer.

Mais peu importe ces deux critiques quand on veut un RPG au tour par tour et là ce jeu vaut le coup :

- on peut vraiment se créer via les skills un groupe sympa et bien personnalisé evidemment en toute logique il faut un groupe équilbré mais néammoins comme je l'ai fait en faisant 2 runs en difficile on peut varier l'évolution de chaque personnage hormis un mais c'est logique il a déjà une bonne spé et il nous rejoint en cours de route mais son étoffage reste à notre guise ce qui permet d'autres spé mais d'un point de vue RP c'est pas logique de mon point de vue.
- je vous conseille de lire quelques guides qui expliquent les skills pour monter vos persos logiquement si vous ne connaissez pas les régles de l'oeil noir (ma femme a joué sans rien y connaitre et en lisant à peine les tutos ingame ca ne l'a pas empéché de faire un run en normal puis ayant saisi l'essentiel d'en refaire un en difficile mais elle est perseverante elle a peiné sur pas mal de combats)
- il a variété de combats et de cartes avec des éléments interactifs pour tenir en haleine et contrairement à ce que j'ai pu lire il n'y pas qu'une façon d'en venir à bout. 
- la difficulté des combats en difficile n'est pas un éceuil j'ai peiné sur 3 combats mais 2 étaient faisables quand je voulais car étant des quêtes secondaires donc j'aurai pu temporiser et sur la fin du deuxième run avec une équipe sans combattant à distance j'ai eu une map difficile qui en remaniant mes consommables (potions de vies, poisons etc;) a fini par passer donc j'ai du le refaire entre 5 à 10 fois j'ai pas compté et en même temps j'aurai aimé plus de combat aussi retors...

Mon seul regret est la pauvreté des équipements (armes et armures) peu de choix et au look discutable et le manque d'un  niveau de difficulté supérieur obligeant à allier skills et consommables, ces derniers ne m'ayant été réellement utile sur un seul combat c'est regrettable mais pour contrebalancer mon propos ma femme en a fait une très grosse consommation palliant à travers eux sa méconnaissance de l'évolution d'un perso comme il se doit...

J'ai l'ai eu en promos pour 8€ donc 4€ chacun avec ma femme donc un régal et on fera de même avec Blackguards 2...

Ну что могу сказать - игра очень даже неплохая. Тут интересный, пусть и местами банальный сюжет, неплохой геймплей, как для любителя тактических пошаговых боев, хорошая озвучка (о, этот акцент Зурбарана!), забавные персонажи (тут также выделяется Зурбаран, следом идет молчаливый Такате =)). 
Но есть и куча минусов.
1. Дичайший рандом на сложном уровне сложности. От него, судя по отзывам, многие разбили клавиатуры! И дело тут не в сложности боев как таковых - просто вы мажете стабильно по 95% попаданию, в ваших персонажей вваливают криты по 30-40 хп при том что воины имеют по 40-50, а заклинания никак не хотят кастоваться с 99% вероятностью. Поэтому играйте на среднем - фана больше, нервы целее!
2. Забагованность достижений. Ну ту не критично, просто обидно немного. У меня и у кучи народа, судя по статистике, так и не выстрелила главная интрига - остенется ли Аурелия с ГГ или бросит его на погибель. 
3. Бесполезность кучи заклинаний и предметов. Нахрена мне 3-4 заклинания дамага, если я прекрасно пользуюсь огненным лучем, а прокачать удар грома стоит дикого количесова опыта? Зачем мне куча режущего-колющего оружия, когда важные бои (где разбивать кристаллы) проходятся ТОЛЬКО ударным оружием?

Не ставьте высокий уровень сложности - из-за рандомности событий в игре и общей кривой системе прокачки некоторые бои доводят до психоза.

минусы:
- главный минус - непонятно что покупать, непонятно что качать. Деньги сильно ограничены. Потраченный опыт не вернуть.
- Игра принадлежит к жанру пошаговая стратегия с элементами РПГ, но просто напичкана рандомом. Тут все случайно: вероятность попадания, урон, шанс удачного применения заклинания и всех навыков в целом, порядок ходов, прочее.
- Немецкая ролевая система для настольных игр в которой надо разбираться, но сама по себе эта система убога.
- интерфейс пользователя не проработан, не дает всей необходимой информации по механике ролевой системы
- неудобное управление (неоптимизированное и недоработанное).
- сюжет скучный, но в принципе сойдет.
- скудный арсенал вооружения
- не сбалансированный уровень сложности. На высокой сложности большинство боев проходимы с первой попытки, но часть боев просто кошмар и ужас, аж бесит.

плюсы:
+ тактическая пошаговая стратегия
+ много диалогов

It does also help that the battlegrounds are often different and sometimes with additional challenges.

The lack of possibility for level-grinding can make the game sometimes spike in difficult (at one point I was forced to lower the difficulty setting in order to get past one point, as there was no way to level-grind my characters), but for the vast majority of the game the problems arising from this have been largely avoided.

It has a nice atmosphere and is quite challenging. I really missed the roundbased RPGs, which is, for me atleast, revived in this. Sometimes you have to think ahead, sometimes you can just bully everybody down. Some fights are really stressful, while others are straightforward. The point is that almost no fight is like another one, each requires new tactics and strategies, atleast to a point. Of course you have your base tactics, which, in my case was a mostly ranged combat play style. But pure melee or multiple spellcasters sound interesting too. The good thing is that every character is can mostly do anything, aside the fact that only characters with magic potential can become wizards.

Another interesting thing for was the whole plot. Having played the other TDE games made it easy for me to fit into the world with its twelve gods, its mostly human based civilisation, with much prejudice against other races and of course its bright and wild country side, which makes this world a beautiful place. But the beauty in this is just a mask for all the darker happenings in this world.

I think it is likely that my opinion on this game would change if I had forked out £30 for it.

I knew about Daedlic's point and click games like Deponia so I was interested to see what their take on a RPG would be like. As it is something that I almost expect in a RPG nowdays it is important to state that this game is very linear. If you are expecting something like Dragon Age you are going to be very disapointed (to be fair expecting all RPGs to be like Dragon Age will invaribly lead to disappointment). Also I think the game description is a bit misleading, you and your companions do have a slight criminal air about yourselves but at the end of the day it is standard save the world type stuff, nothing too ground breaking.
The game has three main views, the first is the world overview you use for travelling around. This is basically a map type view with marker locations for villages, towns, places of interest etc... To move around you click on where you want to go and jump to that location - so no player controlled wilderness exploration or anything like that. The next view is the ""town view"". This is pretty much a static view where you can click on characters to buy goods or obtain/advance quests. The final view is the battle view, this is a map split up into small hexagons where the player controlled combat takes place. These battle maps range in size, though none are particularly huge. They consist of different environments and obstacles that sometimes require a change in tactics for some scenarios. Combat is turn based attack and move type stuff with close combat with swords, axes, maces etc..., ranged with bows and crossbows and ranged with magic. The combat can get a bit repetitious but there is enough in there that it does not feel too much a grind.
You get to pick one of three classes for your main character, a mage, a rogue/archer type or a fighter. On levelling up you pick attributes and combat skills and there is the freedom to create hybrid classes by giving your archer some mage abilities for example. I did find though that each class tends to have one particularly powerful skill or skill combo that you will just tend to repeat in combat.
The game itself has a lot of good and bad points, it is quite a mixed bag but there is probably going to be something in there that does end up annoying you, it certainly is not perfect. How much that thing annoys you is probably the defining factor in whether you will ultimately enjoy the game or not. For me it was with the combat, there are some monsters which are only vunerable to one type of damage. However, ahead of the battle you do not necessarily know what type of monster you will be fighting so in my case I frequently had everyone inflicting either piercing or magic damage. That was my best set up given my characters, weapons and prefered skills. However, in some fights monsters will be invulnerable to piercing so you have to quit the game reload and re-equip characters with maces so you can inflict bashing damage. Nothing game breaking but it did really get annoying, you learn pretty early on to have back up weapons handy and make sure your party is at least a bit flexible. You can look on that as somewhat of a positive as my party was really not set up for those particular battles so it did add an extra challenge, making what should have been an easy fight a bit more difficult. I think one other problem that needs highlighting is the party make up. You have a limited number of companions that you can recruit, essentially there is one party for the game. You do not get to deicde if you would rather have a mage or a fighter in your party you get what your are given. I do not want to spoil anything but at some point in the game something happens that means that really to fill a specific gap in your party your main character needs to be a specific class. Luckily I chose this class anyway so it was not a problem in my play through. If I had selected a different class it may have negatively effected my opinion of the game.
On the positive side I liked the story (the ending is a bit meh but nothing too objectionable) and found the characters interesting with some nice back story and different personalities. By the end I found myself invested in the story and felt fairly satisfied with the experience on completion. You do get some ""choices with consequences moments"" that give you a sense of control over how the story plays out. My play through took me 26 hours and I pretty much did everything quest wise in the game.

I would recommend this game but I did pay about £18 for it. if I had paid the full retail price I would probably not recommend it as I think at that price some of the problems I have glossed over would have seemed a lot more annoying. My advice is to pick this up if you see it discounted as on the whole it is a relatively enjoyable experience. However, at full price there a lot better RPGs out there and I would be a lot less forgiving of the game's flaws.",1424560549,1424560549,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Slow-paced and difficult, with too fine a stat/ ability granularity for how clunky and random the tactical combat actually is.

Game difficulty doesn't ramp well... as a starting player I felt always behind the curve, with crappy equipment and not enough gold to do much about it, and I spent more time redoing missions I lost than enjoying any sense of progression or accomplishment. The action wheel adds a lot of friction to the experience... it just took too long to do any action beyond the basic double-click weapon strike. Stores are weird... there's more stuff than I can afford to buy and more stuff available than I would even want, so it's an odd mix of too much/ not enough. As far as your character(s), there are too many skills/ abilities/ talents/ whatever and not enough information on what they are or do or what your starting levels indicate in terms of mastery... just too many knobs on one part of the game and not enough on all the others.

I read many complaints about the immense difficulty and frustrating rng before playing Blackguards but when I got into it myself I found the complaints to be exaggerated though it's a subjective impression of course. The Dark Eye rpg system can seem strange to those who've never encountered it before and are mostly used to dnd-esque games but if one takes the time to study and understand the stats and skills and plan their characters the game will flow much more smoothly though there are a few missions that can feel overly long and frustrating. 

The most underrated part of Blackguards is the writing I think. While the overarching story is fairly forgettable the characters and their interractions with each other and the world around them are a treat on many occasions and the humor feels fresh and I found it genuinely funny as opposed to meme-ish or pop culture reliant as is often the case. The game setting is gritty and reminiscent of the eastern regions in A Song of Ice and Fire (popularly know as Game of Thrones). It's a place where slavery and blood sports are considered the norm and the Poisoners Guild is the ""most respectable"" It's a great place for your band of greedy liars, violet thugs, lazy misfits and romantic rogues to have their adventure. I found the English voice acting for the main characters very enjoyable as well. 

I won't go indepth into the gameplay rules since the game is a year old now and there's dozens of reviews and let's plays already. The system isn't perfectly balanced (is it ever?) and certain skills are not so useful to put it midly but it also offers a lot of flexibility in how you build your characters and it's satisfying to see your characters mature into serious ass kickers.

Камерой в бою вертеть нельзя поэтому ты либо играешь с тактически невыгодным видом сбоку (либо путь между ловушек нормально не проложить; либо ловушку не заметишь за столбиком; либо ты мискликнешь из-за того, что у кого-то там анимация, и вместо того, чтобы магом отойти от трёх противников и кинуть огнешар - ударишь одного из них посохом и останешься стоять в толпе), либо ты играешь с видом сверху, в котором всё видно, но смотристя как говно.

Пасфайндинг, который бегает специально по ловушкам бегает. Буквально. Он, конечно, совсем крюк не делает... Но чтобы попасть в ловушку, он вполне себе позволяет сделать отклонение в одну клетку, чтобы наступить на ловушку, и бежит тем маршрутом, которым бы не побежал, если бы ловушек не было. Поэтому если хочешь пробежать мимо ловушек - давай, прокликай по гексам. Очень увлекательно.

Отвратительно медленная анимация в бою. В глаза не бросается, но через несколько часов игры в долгом бою чувствуешь ""Блядь, да вы заебали, мудаки! Дайте мне кнопку, чтобы это говно ускорить раза в два-три...""

Хуева туча окон загрузки. Просто пиздец. Вот вроде нет ничего такого, что долго загружается, что нельзя было бы в памяти держать... Такое ощущение, что это человеконенавистники специально сделали.

За каким-то хером наделали кучу пустых городов. 20-30 городов, которые по наполнению ничем друг от друга не отличаются, и сведи их к интерфейсному меню там было бы ""таверна, кузнец, торговец"". И может быть, если повезёт НПЦ.
Потрудились же - нарисовали домики и человечков. Внешне города разные, а фактически ничем не различаются и не запоминаются.
Карта обладает нулевой информативностью. Был ты в этом городе или нет; какие квесты туда ведут - хер знает. Хочешь узнать - смотри через лог. Который отдельное уёбищное говно.

Инвентарь тоже неудобный, сортировки нет, бардак. Если в бою использовал предмет, то игра не додумается положить новый такой же в слот. Иди и ручками клади - очень увлекательно.

В целом ощущение от игры - как от большого недостроенного пустого дома. Ворде как что-то большое, и что-то есть - стены, лестницы... А внутри берёт недоумение - ""что это такое, зачем, и какой толк от этого? зачем я здесь, здесь же делать нечего..."".

The game is flawed though.  For a game that states:

""Your choice of spells, skills and abilities determine your battlefield tactics. Aggressive? Defensive? Tactical? It's your call how to tackle each challenging encounter! ""

There is very little choice.  If you want an RPG where you can build your characters and team this is not it.  The game give you a very well defined group to play with.  It makes the game extremely difficult if you do not build your characters to a certain role.  The other characters are far enough down their progression that it makes little to no sense to try and change them.  What is so maddening about this game, is that there is a lot of really cool things you could do.  You are just not able to do them, because they game gates skills, and locks players into roles for you.  If the game just let you have 4-5 characters to build as you see fit it would be far better.  

The story was fine.  The voice acting was ok.  The game is good.  There is no real choice in the game though.  No characters progression choice and no choice in what you do.  That is why the game falls short for me.  It is not worth the full price.  

If you are looking for a decent game that has limited flexibility and is on rails this might be for you.   This game just falls way short of how it is advertized.

Ну а что может быть приятней, чем запустить ""Файрболл"" в, заныкавшегося за бочкой со смолой вражеского лучника, дабы его закоптило до вкуснейшей корочки?  Добавьте сюда элемнет ""рандома"" повреждений, и будет ой как нелегко... Но ведь и ""ой как"" интересно, дорогие мои (с)!

 Нельзя сказать, что сюжет блещет оригинальность, но и заснуть не даст - однозначно. Как по мне, вполне себе не скучен. Диалоги не достают, хотя и имеют место быть. 

 Особо хочу отметить стратегию развития персонажей. Его разносторонность. Мы не получаем 1 очко навыка для того, и 2 для того-то....мы получаем просто очки опыта, и распределяем их на то .что душе угодно. Вариантов - уйма! Для меня - в новинку это. Очень порадован. Про обилие оружия, ловушек, ядов и прочих приятных свистелок-перделок - говорить не буду. Они есть!

 Не легенда ,но очень добротная и качественная пошаговая РэПэГэ.

J'ai bien failli abandonner dés les premiers affrontements tant ils m'ont paru difficiles. pourtant le système de combat et les interactions avec l'environnement m'ont séduits et j'ai donc persisté. Maintenant j'y trouve plus de plaisir.

Le concept est simple : une équipe de combattants, des adversaires, un équipement minimaliste et en avant il faut gagner le combat. Parfois la condition de vistoire n'est pas (seulement) de massacrer tout le monde.

C'est un jeu tactique, il ne s'agis pas de bourriner à grand coups d'épée et de sorts théâtraux. Il faut utiliser l'environement, d'abriter organiser les compétences de chaque personnage etc.

J'ai lu une critique ou le joueur disait qu'il avait parfois l'impression que pour gagner il devais trouver la solution de chaque tableau qu'il n'y avait pas de place à différentes tactiques. C'est un peu vrai, sur certains terrains j'ai eu presque le sentiments d'avoir un puzzle à résoudre.

L'histoire est suffisamment intéressante pour qu'on la suive, mais ce n'est pas un jeu narratif et les choix n'impactent pas l'histoire. Jusque là j'ai perdu un personnage suite à une conversation (et je ne suis même pas sûr à 100% que ce soit lié) et c'est à peu prêt le seul événement qui découle de mes actes. 

Ne comptez pas non plus avoir des équipements absurdes qui vous font dire ""Hey regarde mon perso, ces épaulettes d'1m50 ont la classe!"". Tout est sobre. Personnellement j'apprécie et c'est rafraîchissant.

L'évolution des personnage est particulière. pas de classe parfaitement définie. Tout le monde peut aprendre à manier toutes les armes et la magie. Du coup ça peut paraître brouillon. Personnellement j'aime cette liberté même si au final un mage restera un mage et on ne fera pas de notre guerrier un lanceur de sorts.

Pour conclure, Blackguards est un jeu tactique, de stratégie qui parfois tire sur le puzzle. C'est sobre, l'arbre de compétences offre une grande liberté sans limitation par des classes.

J'ai déploré le fait qu'on se déplace de combats en combats et en villes sur une carte mais finalement c'est accessoire. 

Un bon jeu, réservé à ceux qui veulent des challenges tactiques. Et qui n'ont pas peur de recommencer un combat plusieurs fois d'affiler avant de le réussir.",1422867843,1422867843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Too often your characters will miss leaving foes drooling at another chance to make you reload.

Wer Aktionrollenspiele mag und sich mit jedem Sieg eine dicke Belohnung erwartet, wird sicherlich enttäuscht sein. Auch der 'echte' Rollenspieler, der auf eine richtig tiefgründige Geschichte hofft, wird in Blackquards nicht finden was er sucht, denn all das will dieses Spiel wohl gar nicht sein. Vielmehr ist es eben ein Spiel mit Schwerpunkt auf strategische, rundenbasierende Kämpfe, eingebettet in einen solide erzählten Hintergrund mit der einen oder anderen Möglichkeit, Einfluss auf den Spielverlauf zu nehmen. 

Man findet sich wieder, in der wunderbaren Welt des Pen & Paper Rollenspiels 'Das schwarze Auge' die in Ihrem Detailreichtum und ihrer Vielschichtigkeit hier natürlich nur höchstens ansatzweise dargestellt werden kann. Dennoch erhält man einen kleinen Einblick, ... mehr eine Ahnung... , was man versäumt wenn man 'DSA' nie wirkich gespielt hat.

Die Charaktäre sind klassisch. Soll heissen, der Zwerg ist ein Zwerg und verhält sich auch so. Manch einer mag dies negativ, vorhersebar und langweilig finden, ich hatte meine Freude daran und wäre über alles Andere enttäuscht gewesen. Auch wenn die Dialoge in den Zwischensequenzen oft nicht die Auswahl bieten die man sich wünscht, so musste ich doch oft über die eine oder andere Antwort meiner Protagonisten schmunzeln. 

Die Möglichkeiten zur Charakterentwicklung wirken auf den ersten Blick recht unübersichtlich, doch wenn man einmal das Regelwerk und damit das Kampfsytem verstanden hat, offenbart sich einem die Logik dahinter. Hat man sich dann entschieden, welche Entwicklung der Charakter nehmen soll, ist es aus meiner Sicht kaum noch möglich, die gewonnenen Abenteuerpunkte falsch zu verteilen. Auch verringert man durch die richtige Punkteverteilung das so oft kritisierte 'Zufallsprinzip' im Verlaufe des Spieles drastisch. Ein ungeübter Kämpfer trifft eben seltener als ein geübter und selbst ein versierter Magier macht hin und wieder einen Fehler. Ich betrachte dies als durchaus realistisch. Zudem erhält es die Spannung, solange es sich in halbwegs glaubwüdige Grenzen hält.

Die Kämpfe selbst sind, wie man sie von einem rundenbasierenden Spiel kennt und erwartet. Oft eröffnen sich Möglichkeiten, die Gegebenheiten des Kampfplatzes und die verschiedenen Fähigkeiten seiner Helden effektiv zu nutzen. Auch muss man hin und wieder den einen oder anderen Schalter oder Hebel betätigen, um weiter zu kommen. Nicht immer erkennt man dies alles auf Anhieb, deshalb ist oftmaliges Speichern selbstredend Pflicht.

Um nun nicht nochmals zu wiederholen, was meine Vorgänger schon in oft vortrefflicher Weise geschildert haben komme ich nun zum Fazit:

Blackquards ist ein empfehlenswertes Spiel mit Schwerpunkt auf  rundenbasierende, strategische Kämpfe. Der 'Rest' ist ein gelungenes, teils sehr liebevoll gestaltetes Ambiente.

Die Charakterentwicklung und das Kampfsytem muss man verstehen um wirklich Spass am Spiel zu haben, ein Blick in's 'Handbuch' mag da eventuell hilfreich sein.

1 - História envolvente e com reviravoltas que te prendem mais ainda. Fiquei mais de uma semana jogando somente esse jogo, pois queria ver a conclusão da trama.
2 - As batalhas são de nível mediano, tendo somente umas quatro que me fizeram suar para passar. Estratégia meu caro, nada além disso.

Они совершенно не справедливы и не должны отпугивать от покупки игры, а они отпугивают. 
1) Баги ломающие игру давно пофикшены, если они и были. Я прошел игру целиком за исключением нескольких побочных квестов и ничего не сломало игру. И это инди. И это не первая инди игра которую я купил. По сравнению с инди песочницами у которых 95% положительных обзоров и которые состоят исключительно из багов, в этой игре багов нету.
2) По поводу сложности игры и рандома. Игрок играет в Dark Souls, испытывает БУДАПЕШТ, ставит игре плюс. Игрок играет в Blackguards, испытывает БУДАПЕШТ, ставит игре минус. Я этого не понимаю.

Плюсы игры:
1) Интересный сюжет со спойлерами и вотэтоповоротами.
2) Геймплей затягивает. А что еще игре и надо, собственно говоря. 
3) Колоритные персонажи. 
4) Немецкая RPG! А Готика уже надоела и уже давно не Готика вовсе.

Минусы игры:
1) Прокачка героя убога. ""Прокачай силу чтобы победить"" в случае воина или лучника. И ""вложи 2000 опыта в ненужный стат, чтобы разлочить нужный перк"" в случае мага. Реально в игре 10 ненужных статов которые надо качать чтобы анлочить нужные перки. 
Дамаг ближнего боя скейлится от силы, а дальний и волшебники не скейлятся вообще ни от чего сколько есть у лука/спела дамага столько они и выдают. Хотя это можно замететить только читами выставив статы выше возможных. Но кривость механики тут всплывает.
2) Всемогущий КУБИК. ""Твою мать опять промахнулся"" и клавиатура вдребезги. Всегда есть 5% шанс что ты промахнешься и еще 5% шанс что противник кританет.
3) Слишком сложная на легком уровне сложности. Не смог без читов пройти игру. Проходил на нормальном уровне сложности, во второй главе на одной карте снизил на легкий и обратно. А вот в пятой главе пришлось читерить, даже на легком не смог. Может когда-нибудь попробую еще и таки прокачаю героев правильно.
4) Графон. Бомжи и пауки сделаны нормально. А вот красотки в игре какие-то некрасивые. 
5) Куча торговцев с каким-то бомжешмотом который нафиг не нужен.

Eh bien :

- Vous prenez un jeu de la série Drakensang
- Vous enlevez toute la partie exploration isométrique dans des villes et paysages en 3D pour rajouter à la place une superbe interface digne des derniers jeux flash que l'on peut trouver sur armorgames ou zebest3000.
- Et vous enlevez tous ces autres détails qui font le charme d'un bon jeu de rôle : la collecte d'ingrédients, le craft, les PNJ à profusion etc... 

Vous obtenez Blackguards !

Franchement, autant j'adorais les jeux de rôle au tour à tour (King's Bounty, Heroes of Might and Magic, Dofus... enfin c'était avant l'arrivée de la version 2 !), autant ce jeu a fini de me dégoûter de ce genre !

Ah oui, j'oubliais, pour compenser le manque de contenu, vous rajoutez une grosse difficulté, hmmm... de la bonne grosse difficulté bien frustrante !

Je n'y ai joué ""que"" 4 heures, mais c'était 4 heures de pure souffrance... Vous passez des premiers niveaux tranquille, mais vous ne vous rendez pas compte que vous êtes entrain de monter dans la petite camionnette blanche et que vous allez vous faire ... au bout de 2 heures de jeu ! 

Car oui ! Plus vous allez avancer dans ce jeu, plus vous allez tomber sur de l'irréalisable, des niveaux d'une difficulté... atroce !

Sans rigoler... Trouvez-vous cela normal que dans un niveau, en plus d'avoir une quinzaine de monstres à vaincre (avec 3 personnages...), il y ait des stalactites qui tombent aléatoirement dans un ou plusieurs hexagones, et ce tous les tours, et qui vous tuent en un coup si par malheur, ils touchent l'un de vos personnages ? J'ai réussi ce niveau à la 3ème tentative, mais c'était uniquement avec de la chance !

J'ai carrément abandonné à un niveau où il fallait sauver une baronne... Infaisable ! Il faut en 5 tours éliminer (toujours avec 3 personnages...) 6 hommes de main, qui sont à l'autre bout du terrain entrain de vous cribler de flèches... et bien entendu, le pont qu'il faut traverser pour venir sur eux est rempli de pièges invisibles qui vous font sauter un tour : Evidemment !

Mention spéciale aux doubleurs (le jeu est en VOST) : Les dialogues et leur voix ne collent absolument pas avec l'ambiance héroïque-fantasy du jeu !

The amazing DSA-ruleset, which is for the RPG-players that love to build their chars and favor depth.
The story is mature, so are chars, yes course there's your usual fantasy-cliche, but there's enough darker, more grown up char-interaction. The english voice-over is amazing and engaging.
Many critics just complain about one fact:
missing spells or attacks

those critics spread a lot of missinformation and if your interested you might want to delv deeper into gamemechanics, the DSA rule-set has shown it's amazing depth already on countless PC-games (Drakensang, the old DSA-trilogy) and some forget nowadays how RPGs can work.
In short
-> under the right circumstance a wizard/witch might fumble his spell
-> rolling a hit (which is symbolized by your hitchance, e.g. 95%) doesn't euqal actualy hittin, your target can still parry, dodge, mitigate the damage...which goes also for your party

All in all Blackguards is a love letter for RPGs fans: deep char-customization, not ur usual ""white knightish""-cast, great tactical combat and the list goes on.

BLACKGUARDS! 
Wonderful features such as: 
-EXCLUSIVE SUPPORT FOR 16:9 ratio screens, anything else has massive letterbox black bars that ruin immersion!
-Total lack of a 360 degree camera - the visuals might be 3d, but every battle-screen and town is locked to one camera angle!
-Really bad itemization! I made my character a 2-handed sword focused warrior. Turns out 2-handed swords don't exist in the loot tables until the second act (1-2 hours in), holy shit!
-No exploration whatsoever, anywhere that isn't a 2d city is a 2d battle or a load screen. NOTHING IN-BETWEEN.


The only draw of this game is that you play as a group of misfits and bad guys. Except you don't really play as bad guys or misfits at all - in fact, it seems very standard for a fantasy RPG. You are thrown into the utterly predictable universe of The Dark Eye - a German sort of more boring, more cliche version of the already awful pastiche the English world knows as ""Forgotten Realms."" The entire concept of this game was that you play as the baddies, a somewhat refreshing idea on the extremely tired fantasy adventure. Except you don't - at all. Your character - get ready - wakes up in a prison cell after being tortured, and goes on a mission of revenge against the EVIL badguy with the EVIL artifact. Holy shit, how original. You spend most of your time doing stupid quests like rescuing a damsel in distress and healing the sick. Sorry, what was the title of this game again? Oh, Blackguards? Wait really?

Prepare for a long adventure of boring RNG-decided battles, random and arbitrary interactable objects, and extremely slow loot progression! Repetitive cities, awful dialogue, poor voice acting, and the same 5 load screens 400 times a session. Prepare to reload your game over and over again as your sound strategy falls apart as your heroes miss consistently despite an 85% chance to hit and your mages fizzle their spells due to the shitty standard build that the developers gave them!

I don't even know what else to say about this game. It's an embarassment and a total waste of money. Luckily I got it as part of an inexpensive humble bundle, otherwise I'd be a bit more frustrated.

Enfin, si ces quelques éléments m'ont fait arrêter (aussi et surtout parce que je n'étais pas très motivé de base), ne vous détrompez pas on a quand même affaire à un très bon jeu.",1421942911,1421942911,True,2,0,0.5092582106590271,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In other words, if I had bought this game at the full price tag of $39.99, I'd probably be more inclined to hit ""Not Recommended"". But on sale, I think it's a good game that will definitely keep you playing for a couple of hours at a time if you don't have high standards of character. That being said, you will probably not be interested enough to keep playing this on a binge where you spend hours on end.

The tactics style gameplay is pretty neato. That's... about all I can say about that part of the game. It doesn't really add anything to it or really borrow from some more advanced takes on it like XCOM: You've got area-of-effect attacks, you've to melee attacks, you've got ranged attacks. Don't expect to have any innovative takes on cover-combat, field of vision, and so on. 

The characters are decent. Not really involved enough that I'd say I particularly cared about any of them one way or another, but not bland enough that I wasn't at least interested in seeing where they fit in the story. The character you kind of play as doesn't seem to really have a major stance on anything minus how you decide to direct his dialogue, but it's one of those games where you're kind of your own guy and you kind of aren't. 

There's a lot of good side quests here and there that you are definitely going to want to do to keep yourself armed and leveled for the main questline.
As for the main questline itself, there's really nothing that much to it. The game tries to differentiate itself from other RPG-style adventure games by having the cast of characters be completely unlikely heroes. You, the main character, find yourself traveling with two fellows (a stereotypical and somewhat superstitious dwarf and a casanova mage) who collectively break out of a prison. From there, your party's membership includes a drug-addict elf whose pretty good with a bow (I think she's an elf at least. She's got the ears), a tribal dude who was ready to kick your ass before, and a childhood friend who ended up becoming an (alleged) nymphomaniac witch. 
This seems like an interesting premise on the surface, but the game doesn't really apply itself that well. We don't really get much in on the character's pasts, and the interactions with the main character and the story are very limited. For a game that could've very well built onto a unique premise worthy enough of it being a constantly talked about title, the developers didn't really do much to apply themselves here, and I'm afraid that might still be the case for the sequel, Blackguards 2 as well (I haven't played it yet, so I won't judge).

So basically, this game is good if it's on a really, really good sale and you're already into fantasy and tactical games, but aren't looking for anything too innovative on either ends.",1421882954,1421882994,True,1,0,0.517234146595001221,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Déjà, il faut savoir que derrière Blackguards se trouve le studio allemand Daedalic. Ce studio est passé Maître dans la création des jeux d’aventure. Ils ont à leur actif plusieurs séries toutes aussi passionnantes les unes que les autres.

Ensuite, il faut savoir que Blackguards se déroule dans le monde de L’Oeil Noir. Tout le monde a entendu parlé de ce jeu de rôle sorti pour la première fois, il y a quelques dizaines d’années. C’est un monde stable et bien construit qui va servir de base solide pour ce jeu.

Pour commencer, sachez que vous devez créer votre personnage, vous avez le choix entre trois classes : guerrier, magicien et archer. Mais avant de foncer, les deux personnages qui vous rejoindront au tout début sont un guerrier et un magicien.

L’histoire est bien, le graphisme est superbe, le jeu est bien construit, les possibilités sont énormes, bref, si vous aimez les jeux de rôle, n’hésitez pas, achetez Blackguards.

On peut signaler que la suite de ce jeu, Blackguards 2, sort mi-janvier 2015. Evidemment, le prix du premier épisode ne peut aller que vers le bas. Guettez les soldes ou réductions occasionnelles.

I've spent 112 hours meticulously stripping down every area, every character and every side quest I could find during my first (and so far only) playthrough of this game. For the record, I'm a seasoned RPG-player and accustomed to the old-school turn based games.

Short version: Blkackguards is an average game which could have been a lot better without some of the bugs and a more intuitively developed story engine.

For those of you who remember the glory days of the genre with Baldur's Gate I and II, IceWind Dale amongst others, Blackguars might still be worth looking into. I enjoyed playing it, but I would also like to post a warning about some of things that knocked down the total score for me:

[olist]
[*]The main plot is... kinda slow. And dull. I actually enjoyed several of the side-quests a lot more than the main story. The ending is very dissapointing (and without giving any spoilers, that is an understatement). I also missed having background stories unfold for the main characters, but perhaps Daedalic are saving those for the sequel(?). 

[*]Several achievements are (still) bugged. 5 of them simply can't be completed at all (confirmed by the steam community) but I've had a total of 6-7 that bugged in my game. It's been more than a year since these bugs were first reported and the steam forums have had no response from the developers yet. Like I just mentioned above, they are currently developing a sequel to Blackguards, so chances are that these bugs might never be fixed. Hence: be warned if you're one of those players (like me) who wants to cross off every achievement from the list. For future reference: I have not bought or played the DLC. 

[*]Some of the game mechanics are not explained (at all) in the manual and I had to scavenge the steam forums to see if they actually worked or not. Armor is perhaps the most obvious aspect, where players have no way of telling if the armor skills makes any difference or if the character is encumbered (and if so, what penalties to expect in battles).

[*]An abundance of spells and skills makes things look very promising at first glance, but in reality, most of them are pretty much useless. Even when taking in account different preferations/play styles, at least 50% of the spells are likely to never be used by any player. Unfortunately, that goes for weapon types, talents and weapon skills as well. I can't shake the feeling that these worthless skills where put only there for marketing purposes rather than adding flavour to the game. It's either that, or Daedalic simply ran out of time/funds and had to release the game without proper (re)balancing tests.

[*]Although you are frequently presented with alternatives and choices in NPC dialogues, it rarely matters what you choose. I guess you could say that they are there to add some RP, but even so it could have been handled with more finesse. Instead you're bound to a main plot that you have no chance of altering the outcome of. 

[*]I really don't want to spoil anything for you, but a frequent bother is when the game removes one ore more of your followers (and sometimes even your main character) without warning. A new player might have to start from scratch halfway through the game. Hint: make sure that your main character is at least somewhat decent in ranged combat.

[*]The 20th time the game presents you with two choices where one gives you a handsome reward (typically the ""evil"" aligned choice) while the other leaves you empty handed you can't help but wonder why? Most players expect good deeds to add up to some kind of greater reward later on. In my personal opinion, this is perhaps the single biggest flaw Blackguards has, and it feels like the developers rushed the story instead of taking time to plot out great stories. Let me underline that I don't think that ""good"" alignment should be favoured in any way. The rewards doesn't have to be better gear or more gold, it could for example be new dialogues/NPC's that are unlocked at some point further down the line. For a game that relies so heavily on RPG stereotypes it's dissapointing that karma is pretty much non-existant in Blackguards, And yet, [i]sometimes[/i] the choices you make are actually so important that it could warrant starting over from the beginning. I would advice all new players to SAVE, SAVE and SAVE their game as often as possible. Think of Blackguards as a Bethesda title in that aspect.
[/olist]

With the bad stuff out of the way, let's round things up with the more positive aspects of Blackguards: 

it's an ambitious attempt at rebooting the genre (yes, I'm aware that there are several other similar games on the market nowdays) based on a popular tabletop theme. The graphics are decent and the voice acting is top notch.

Currently priced at €39.99, I'd recommend potential customers to wait for one of the steam sales before buying. For that kind of money you'll likely to find plenty of better alternatives. Personally I bought it in a [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Daedalic%20Entertainment]Daedalic[/url] bundle and 120 hours of gameplay is more than I expect to get from most titles these days.

So you're more or less stuck with what the game gives you, instead of developing the team that you want to play.
You can also lose companions midway through the game, for the sake of the story, which makes it even harder to have complete control over your team.

Blackguards zähle ich eher zu den Rundenbasierenden Strategiespielen mit sehr starken RPG Elementen.
Im Endeffekt ist es eine Aneinanderreihung verschiedener Kampfmissionen, während dazwischen die Story vorangetrieben wird und man seine Chars ausrüsten und weiterentwickeln kann. Nebenquests münden in zusätzlichen Kampfmissionen.
Wer stark verzweigte Dialogoptionen erwartet, wird enttäuscht werden. Der Schwerpunkt liegt ganz klar auf den Kämpfen.

Ich selbst spiel das Game auf schwer und hab erst bei einer Mission knapp ein Dutzend Anläufe gebraucht. (Eigener Char ist eine Kriegerin; normal mode Erstellung) Deshalb kann ich den Kritikpunkt bezüglich des zu hohen allgemeinen Schwierigkeitsgrades nicht nachvollziehen.

Ein Schlüsselpunkt zum Erfolg ist die Ausnützung der Map-Eigenschaften, wie Fallen, Pfützen, Kisten, etc... Hierbei ist allerdings anzumerken, dass diverse Wirkungsweisen am Anfang nicht klar ersichtlich sind und es einiges an Trial & Errror braucht. Ebenso sollte man sich die Missionsziele immer vor Augen halten, da APs durch erfolgreiches Abschließen von Missionen erlangt werden.

-->Kritikpunkte bleiben für mich die etwas unübersichtliche Darstellung der Itemeigenschaften. Hier braucht man ein bisschen Zeit um sich zurechtzufinden. 
-->Die Gegner-KI ist eher schwach, was manchmal zu fragwürdigen Entscheidungen führt. 
-->Die Berechnung der Trefferwahrscheinlichkeiten ist ab und an schwer nachzuvollziehen. Ich selbst hab es schon ein paar Mal erlebt, dass selbst eine 100%ige Trefferwahrscheinlichkeit zu einem Fehlangriff führt. Ein Treffer kann des öfteren zwischen Erfolg und Misserfolg einer Mission entscheiden.
-->Auch ist das Spiel schon 2x zwischen Missionen einfach hängen geblieben, was aufgrund der Autosave-Funktion nach jedem Kampf jetzt nicht so sehr in Frustmomenten gemündet hat.
--> User Interface gefällt mir nur bedingt. Es ist schon so oft vorgekommen, dass sich mein ""Heiler"" selbst anstatt den verletzten Krieger geheilt hat. Alles, weil ich mit der rechten Maustaste auf den Heiler geklickt hab um den Zauber auszuwählen. Ist man halt von anderen Games so gewöhnt.
--> Grafik erfüllt ihren Zweck. Wobei man ehrlich sagen muss, dass Neverwinter Nights 2 aus dem Jahre 2004 wahrscheinlich besser aussieht.
--> Die Synchronstimmen sind OK, wobei es sich manchmal sonderbar anhört, wenn von einem ""Mütterchen"" die Rede ist und diese mit einer süssen mit-zwanziger Stimme trällert. Die Mütterchen in diesem Zeitalter waren zwar schon jung, aber trotzdem... 

Ich spiele im Gegensatz zu ziemlich allen anderen meiner Games übrigens auf deutsch. Deutsche Filme schaut man auch nicht auf Englisch, genauso verhält es sich mit deutschen Games. Es geht doch einiges an Dialogwitz bei der Synchronisation verloren.

Wieso ich das Spiel trotzdem empfehle? Weil es mir Spass macht, und sich die Frustmomente in Grenzen halten. Für ""Tüftler"" wie mich, die sich für Spielzüge Zeit nehmen und etwas durchplanen ist das Spiel wirklich nett. Man freut sich einfach wenn ein Plan aufgeht. Selbst wenn er aufgrund verfehlter Angriffsaktionen 4 oder 5 Anläufe gebraucht hat. Der Preis von knapp 40€ ist allerdings etwas happig, so ehrlich muss man sein.",1420714224,1420714373,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

-Absolute Katastrophe ist der Magier.. unbedingter RAT: alle Zaubersprüche bei Freier Charaktererstellung kaufen
-Magie insgesamt ist in den ersten Stunden fast unbenutzbar, inbesondere AoE.. zu hohe AP Kosten.. und dafür zu wenig Bumms.. schließlich ist man nach 2-3 Zaubern der Stufe 2 oder 3 leer (oom) .. ansonsten gibt es noch die %Castchance der Zaubersprüche.. selbst bei 60-70% fizzelt der Spruch 3/4 Mal.. dh euer Held/Begleiter verschwendet seinen kompletten ZUG für jawohl NIX!!
-Die Kämpfe waren kaum besser als bei Schatten über Riva.. nur eben HD.. eigentlich sogar schlechter, denn Riva hatte eine Handlung und es machte Spaß.. so vor 1-2Dekaden^^

FAZIT: Unterm Strich zerstören diese Fakten den flüssigen Eindruck einer DSA Spielwelt im Süden

Alas, I ended up quite frustrated with a few aspects that are quite game (and immersion) breaking:
1. losing vital companions at crucial times makes party build options very limited. Essentially, once you figure out what will happen to X, you need to rethink your entire strategy for party build. This sometimes means restarting from scratch, or a very earlier save, as party build is very important in some of the encounters (especially the main ones)
2. lack of clothing for non-metal wearing characters - while there are several pretty good sets of armour for warriors, the (complete) lack of mage oriented outfits is a bit mind baffling. I could not fathom that no mage outfits EVER dropped, although you battle many mages wearing unique outfits. And none can be bought. As a consequence, you mage characters have to either wear horrible looking leather armour, or spend a lot of time buffing/running/dying. This is also important for...
3. almost 100% spell failure when wearing metal armour. I can accept offensive spells (cast outward) failing, but having a healing/self-buff spell have a <25% of success is nonsense. So playing as a battle mage/arcane warrior/cleric type role is pretty much out of the question
4. tedious battles - which can go on for a long time, with a lot of time sitting, and staring at the screen while seemingly endless hordes of critters/monsters/lice/etc. go thought their turns. Even tentacles get their own turns, and usually have a higher initiative than your party...
5. endgame decision disasters - going back to #1 - at the end game you find out that you are 'supposed to' have made certain vital conversation decisions with one companion, otherwise they will be lost, which as mentioned before, can be a disaster for the party.

So, if you want to play this:
a) read the guides and build a cooky cutter type that the developers had in mind, and
b) follow a pro-forma discussion template to placate one party member, or lose them at a crucial stage (or build with their loss in mind)
c) have a good book/magazine handy to read during battles, as you otherwise stare at the screen waiting endlessly

The world is interesting, but it gets lost when you fight very samey enemies all the time. Story could be interesting if characters wouldn't change their motivation every now and then, yet they keep being predictable. Also the world is very limited to a 1-3 screens per town.
Battles could be fun - the system has some neat ideas, enviroment has traps and cool strategic placements, but you very rarely get to use that, since you have to attack or you get surrounded and can't move. 

But the major flaw is that the game FEELS UNFAIR all the time (even when maybe it is not really). Instead of making battles interesting, the game more than once takes your whole inventory and offers you bad equipment in exchange, then you have to battle and find out that enemies in that arena are better equipped than you.
Attack chances are random at best  (a number like 90% chance don't mean anything in this game). Damage you inflict is always small unless your character has fully invested in one weapon skill (which I had to change for one character because it had the same setup as my main character and then spent many hours inflicting 3x less damage than the enemies). 
The whole unfairness also applies to experience point requirements - some skills seem very out of reach (I can see the options ahead, but what I can actually afford/choose is 1-2 options and get stuck with that for hours). ""Special"" attacks make very little difference most of the time and are in no way interesting.

(New feature - Simple city interface.)
If you remember Drakensang, Dragon Age or most other RPGs cities, large, vast, many NPCs, a lot of chests to look and barrels to smash for loot. Nothing like that in Blackguards. City is a simple one screen view with most important NPCs, merchant, healer, trainer, quest giver, tavern, the end. If you have business in the city it takes you about a minute to get it done and leave to get back to action. Some might like it, some might not. I like it, as it saves time, no more need to remember where was that cool merchant or a hidden pass etc.

So you may wonder how does this tactical turn base combat looks like.
(Character summary)
Before we get there you must know that Blackguards are based on The Dark Eye RPG pen and paper system. And character development is very much like in the pen and paper game. If you played Drakensangs before you will be very familiar with the system. 
In most RPG games you have classes to select. There are no classes in this game. When creating character you select if you wanna be spell-casting able or not and then you build character on skills/spells you chose. In that this system is similar to Elder Scrolls. If you wanna be a warrior you can be a warrior, if you wanna be a warrior-priest you can be warrior-priest it's all based on how to chose your skills, not limited by class.
So characters have attribiutes that calculate their base stats like vitality, astral points (manna), base attack, dodge and parry. Attriubutes cost a lot of adventure points to raise. By chosing how to spend attribiutes you craft base for your character, if you invest heavy into strength, agility, courage and constitiution you will end up with a fighter with almost no chance to cast any spell. If you go for intuition, cleverness and charisma you will end up with solid base for mage with poor fighting abilities. You can also walk the path of average, but you must be careful and just select few spells and weapons to invest in those heavy.
Keep in mind that mages are limited by metalic armor - they will not regenerate astral points while wearing even a single piece of it and will have negative casting modifier, so a melee mage is a hard to play, but possible with correct spell investment.
Then are the skills. Skills are divided into weapons, talents (perception, traps etc) and spells. And in that game every weapon is another skills, so if your character is an expert swordsman (18 swordsmanship skill), when he will be forced to use an axe, he will be very poor with ti because he has no skill in axe, he will have very small chance to hit and large to be hit by enemies.
Skills make your characters use stuff. Skills are rated from 0-18. Spells and talents unlock bonusses at 8,13,18 levels. Here you choce which spells your character can cast and weapons to use.
At the end are special abilities - special attacks for melees, ranged and boosts for mages.
The better the special attack the harder it is to hit with it.
Original pen and paper game used three 20 side dices for skill tests, to make it computer game, devs changed that into % chance. So unlike dragon age it is not enough to unlock a spell to cast it, you must unlock the spell and invest points into it.
(Note on spells)
For me spells in this game are net design to be used mainly at blunt offensive magic. Spells play a support role in this game. You can cast offensive spells and they will do a lot of damage, however doing so will deplete your astral points in two shots so after your mage will not be able to do anything else than bash stuff with his staff.
(Note on weapons)
I really love games which make using axe different than using a sword for example. Blackguards is such a game.Every weapon type has it damage type (piercing for spears and fancing weapons, slashing for swords and blunt for maces). Every weapon type also uses a different skill. So if you wanna use few different weapons you must spend points on different skills. Different weapons also have different special attacks, you cannot make armor ignoring attack with maces, but you can make attack that tripples the damage with them.

(Combat)
Having explained the above. Combat is turn based in which your heros and enemies take their turns in order of initiative. On their turn everyone can move a little and make action (attack, cast spell, place trap, disarm trap, spot for traps, use item etc) or move further. You can hide behind objects or other heros to break line of sights of enemy archers to your mages as well, there is no other cover system.
Combat map is divided into small hexes for movement and there can be varius hazard spaces on the map like oil set on fire will deal you fire damage when you cross it, while mud can make your character fall down unless he passes bosy control test.
(Tactical combat)
By using combination on magic and physical attacks you must cripple and defeat enemies. Enemies will usually outnumber you as well and some of them will also cast spells, use healing potions and have special attacks. So this is where tactic comes into place. 
Use your melees to block enemies before they reach your mages, or run to enemy mage to bash on him. Use obejects on the map and magic walls to block enemy movement and shoot them directly. You have options.
Cast damage spells to finish fight quickly, or same astral points for buffing and healing magic.

(Plot - Story)
Unfortunately game story is quite linear and not really involving. Characters are a bit shallow and the only one who really feels realistic is the dwarf who is fun and really combat oriented.
At few points in the game you will be stripped of your gear and forced to make through with given equipment untill you can regain your stuff. So it is goot to invest a little into maces(as you will usually end up fighting with a torch or a club) and offensive magic.

(Flaws)
There are some flaws to the game:
-Horrible mouth work. Unlike other modern games, the speaking animations here are just horrible, you will see heros open mouth like fish trying to catch a breath, it has no connectiong with what is being spoken.
-Very bad equipment comparison system. There is no way to compare one set of armor with another other than noting down the stats, changing set and seeing new stats.
-I have really no idea what in this game make it be 20gb large.
-Game does little to introduce players who are new to the difficult character creating and developemtn system. [there is good help&tips in the menu if you can spend a moment to read and understand it]
-Not involving plot and shallow characters.
-Not intuitive UI.
-No crafting system.

(Merits)
+Realistic when it comes to weapons and armors. Armors comes in sets, so it is no longer find best pieces, but you need to wear a complete set of armor to have best benefits. And I like it that way.
+Deep and difficult tactical combat. I like the games that are not easy.
+Quick cities exploration.
+You are not limited when crafting your heros, you have a lot of freedom in systems without classes.

Overall I would give this game 7/10.
I hope most of the flaws will be corrected in the upcomming Blackguards 2.",1420540336,1420540336,True,2,0,0.527559041976928711,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- The difficulty of the game is quite easy at the begining but later on it becomes really annoying because mostly your enemies use spells that lower your move speed, attack chance and health. Also it will become quite impossible to fight your enemies if you don't finish all of the side quest.

- Interface/Combat  is excellent, but the controls are a little wonky and sometimes quite slow. There are some monsters that take up more than 1 hex ( places on the field) and it's hard to locate the spot to hit but it's not that bad that you will ruin your whole turn.

- Information is a little unclear  but after few hours you should figure it out.

- Loading screens. You will spend some time on loading screens.

- There is not much of different gear and weapons. Don't expect to find a lot of variety of great weapons, few of my characters had the same weapon from the 1-2 chapter to the end of the game. Also my wizards had the same clothes from the 1 chapter to the last part of the chapter 5.

- Opponents. There are a lot of different opponents and interesting ones. There are also opponents that are just frustrating you because they have have spells that lower everything (so yout hit chance isn't 95% but 45%) so they are hell to beat but when you beat them it's beautiful.

- Characters. All of the characters u play have different personalities that are unique. In some dialogues you can choose what your characters will say.

- Story. It's not a bad story at all and has some twists.

- Graphics. Some people might not care at all about graphics but I like it when the game I play has at least deacent graphics. The graphics are not that bad at all but when you talk to some people they will look totally different in the picture then they look in the game. 

- Playability it depends on what difficulty you choose to play but It will surely have around 40 hours (surely more).

- To conclude this review I recommend you buy this game but on sale. You will enjoy it and be frustrated.

Lo que me apena es ver tantos analisis negativos cuando se lo podría considerar como un diamante en bruto. No voy a ir al detalle del juego ya que el mismo ya tiene mil analisis (literalmente) pero si quiero poner enfasis en lo siguiente: la primer parte del juego es muy dificil (pero muy) con el agravante de que el desarrollo de los personajes es complicado y no esta bien explicado. Pero, si se tiene paciencia y se superan las primeras horas de a poco se van abriendo posibilidades y vamos entendiendo que atributos sirven y cuales no, donde poner puntos y que es mejor obviar.
 
Muchos se quejan de que los porcentajes de acierto de golpes son inexactos y esto es cierto. No es inusual fallar varias tiradas seguidas con un porcentaje de 80% o mas. Pero de nuevo. A medida que el jeugo avanza y subimos nuestra accuracy esto empieza a pasar muchos menos

Algo que no vi mencionado en la gran mayoria de los analisis es la maestria con la que estan diseñados los escenarios. A diferencia de mucho juegos tacticos los escenarios tienen muchas veces participacion decisiva en el desenlace de un combate y es importante tenerlos en cuenta al planificar los mismos. No es facil y muchos son un verdadero reto pero superarlos realmente transmite una sensacion de satisfaccion que muy pocos juegos logran.

Para terminar. A los amantes de los juegos tacticos les recomendaria darle una oportunidad a este juego pero entiendo que toma tiempo (unas 5 horas al menos) comenzar a entender el sistema de combate y atributos pero una vez pasado eso el juego no hace sino mejorar. Otra cosa es casi obvio pero muchos creo que no lo recomiendan por esto: graben muy seguido. Algunos combates son brutales y no hay margen para el error. Es mejor volver media hora atras y ver que decisiones revisar en cuanto a distribucion de atributos o items comprar que empezar de cero o insultar porque el juego es dificil.

Some nodes are cities where you may learn skills, buy equipment, and get/perform quests, other nodes are quest nodes that may sometimes be skipped. Most of the time is however spent in  hexagon based maps fighting various bad guys. 

The game has a lot of skills and stats that you may experiment with, but mostly it makes little difference what you chose to skill up (For spells any nuke will do, some early bosses are weak to fire, but it makes little difference for most enemies, a healing spell is pretty much required, you will alternate between those two and auto attacks for the whole game), and as most stats and skills are needed in the end anyway the customization adds little depth to a shallow game. 

The major problem with Blackguards is that fights are mostly based on luck. Want to attack someone? Well, usually you have a 90% chance to hit (not bad, but that's as good as it gets unless someone is knocked down), but if you use a more powerful attack it might drop down to 85%, 70%, or 60% (based on dodge stat vs dexterity I think), further reduced with wounds that are randomly obtained when taking damage (I think your to hit chance can potentially go all the way down to 30%). If you manage to hit at all the damage dealt is then further randomed in a fairly large spread, and rarely it will crit for double damage. The damage is fairly high, so 3-4 good attacks is enough to drop most enemies and heroes.
This means that missing more than a few attacks will result in one of your heroes getting knocked unconscious, and the enemies snowball from there.
It's typically the enemies who get the good dodge stats, so while your heroes will mostly take full damage from anything that attacks them late game, your heroes will miss, miss, miss,miss, and miss some more as you watch them slowly die in frustration. 

The game's ""difficulty"" slowly ramps up as you play. Every encounter is level (in)appropriate, so every fight is a challenge. Since spell damage is fixed your magic users slowly get weaker after their 2 main spells hit level 3. While this makes sense in a way you will never get to be satisfied with how much stronger your heroes have gotten. Enemies have about the same stats and skills and do about as much damage as the heroes do, so fights vary little in practise between various encounters.

The game could still be a mildly enjoyable grind with the above mentioned issues, but clearly the devs were obsessed with making the game into a never ending series of encounters by a power tripping DM trying to make your party lose.
I got through several unfair fights like Running past all the enemies who get to hit you for free for 6 turns to get to the girl before she's killed, shoot a giant tree with 150 hp to death with arrows that each do 1 dmg because it 2 shots everything in melee range, run through a basement filled with traps to get to the guy you need to kill before he gets away, kill the necromancer who's surrounded by unkillalbe skeletons that block your spells and arrows, and many many more. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the fight against the tiger lilly where one of your heroes is turned against you, you have to run up to a plant that always has a 60% hit chance, is immune to magic damage, every turn one of your heroes is knocked down, and 5-6 tentacles you're not supposed to kill get to attack your heroes freely while blocking off healing spells you might want to cast on the hero being bullied.
I understand that something like this was necessary to make the game interesting, as the fights by themselves clearly aren't. With a different combat system these fights might have been fun, but in Blackguards you will just keep doing the right thing again and again untill it finally works and you get to go on. 

So, TL;DR: Turn based fights heavily based on luck, little customization in practise despite the wealth of options available, you get weaker as you keep on playing, and gimmicky fights where the devs metaphorically throw your miss chance and weakness in your face again and again by setting up scenarios that force you into doing stupid things over and over untill the RNG gods decide that you may finally pass.

Now, don't get me wrong here, I'm all for % chances to hit, finding tactical ways to defeat the enemy and such, however I really resent the constant <70% chance to hit, and even at 70-90% I've had several times alredy where I do this action 3-4 times and each hit has missed (or failed)(not including piercing to skeletons etc.)
Therefor this game is very inconsistent in how any battle will turn out even by using the same movements and actions each time, and this kind of (almost) luck based combat makes Blackguards very hard to want to play again.

Pros:

- challenging

- good variety of battles (win conditions, interactive objects, environment, enemies)

- multiple ways to win battles depending on your party

- amusing dialogue

- not a single crash the whole time I played and no other bugs

- good length

Minor Cons:

- awkward character development / training and AP gain curve (the currency you improve your charaters with)

- small selection of armor (lets just say I didnt equip my 2 casters with new clothing until the last chapter)

- not many weapons either (many special spears, only 1 or 2  improved versions of other weapontypes)

Tipps & Tricks (light spoiler warning):
[spoiler] 
- do not rely heavily on the Niam character

- make sure your fighters are good with secondary blunt/slash weapon set (for skeletons and crystals)

- make use of the ability to delay your actions with a character by using the space-key (sometimes being the first to move is critical, but other times you want your enemies to move first, so you can move then and hit them

- dramatically increase your chances to hit enemies via wounding them, poisons, knock them down / incapacitate them, attack them with a weak character first so they lose their parade

- have a caster who can cast axxeleratus level 3

- poison your weapons before entering a hard battle (you dont want to waste a turn to poison your weapons in battle)

- use savegames to try out different spells if you have a lot of saved up AP, some are turds but others can really shine / decide a battle (the beserk one can be very good, lightning cloud too)

- get your casters best possible manaregen via gear / talents, maybe archery as a secondary profession

Blackguard is a very fun turn-based strategy game. You will come to love most of the characters. The dialogues are simply amazing. Your party members are exactly what you expect your most extreme type of role-playing friends to be during a sesstion of a tabletop game like DnD.

""I AM A MAGICIAN OF LOVE. I WILL SEDUCE EVERYONE!"" and then you get into battle because he fails all of his seduction.

Everyone takes it to the extreme. One is hella dumb, funny and racist toward the elves. Another is just always sarcastic and mean most of the time.

That covers most of the story telling. Let's get into the gameplay.

THE
DARN
THING
WILL
TRY TO BREAK YOU.

The hex-based map is great.
The game using the ""automated diceroll"" system as if you were playing an actual table top is great.
Problem though is that the other side cheats way too often for you to really enjoy the combat.
Somes of them are insanely easy.
And the next one is just demanding you to either get the spell to work on a 50% rate at the start of the turn with the follow up attack from your friends hitting everything on the first turn or you might as well retry the battle.

And to make it worse. Everything, except for some of the weak fodders, are either as strong as you or much stronger than you. It's funny the first few time you see a lizardman sniping your team with a javelin better than your archer can shoot someone with his bow but after about 2 to 3 hits, it stops being funny because they deal much more damage than you do and even has additional effects until you manage to get to a certain point where you can finally learn your cheap spamming moves too just to destroy everything.

And ""HARD"" mode isn't even hard. It's just frustrating and cheating. Usually, in a strategy game, repeating the same failed strategy oftens lead to the same fail result. However, in Blackguards, repeating the same strategy is what you do until you finally roll enough damage and hit rate to actually carry out that strategy, and that the environment isn't messing with you. 

RNG governs everything. Mobs are predictable but overstat as heck that they will deal your critical-like damage on a normal hit so you just have to retry over and over until the 35% hit rate on them actually miss instead of hitting 3 times in a row while your 90-95% are still missing over and over, or dealing minimal damage when it actually hits, leaving the mobs with 1 hp.

Because this game offers no between-combat regen so sometime, delaying a battle to 60 turns + is necessary although you can end it in 7. It wasn't challenging. It was just the game forcing me to repeat the ""Whole map kite"" for the next 10 minutes just to full heal the whole team. At normal or so, this isn't always necessary. I can try with 75% health and mana on the next map. On hard? You better be full or you might as well restart the whole battle chain.

But that's really the annoying part and it can easily be somewhat remedied by just setting the mode to ""Normal"" unless you're ready to go through pointless self-torture that makes you want to ragequit because of a single crit or a slip on an overstat mob forcing an instaretry. Other than that, I see nothing wrong with this game. People often makes fun of the voice acting but it's only horrible on the trailer. The in-game voice acting is so much better and really fit the situation when the characters are trying to be mean or sarcasting, which isn't really something you can see on the trailer.

I also recommend getting the big pack. The artbook is simply amazing.",1419531949,1419531949,True,2,0,0.535147368907928467,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Story is good, I got really into it from the beginning.  You are trying to investgate the murder of the princess and its possible you are the killer.  As you play more of the story is revealed.

Some good walkthroughs can be found online if you feel the game is too hard, but basically whatever character type you go for you need to invest in one weapon skill to at least 14-16 to avoid missing most of the time.  Also its a good idea to save your experience points until you absolutely need to spend it, and its a good idea to plan ahead what kind of skills and spells you want to invest in as experience points are limited and there is no going back once you purchase a skill.

I recommend this game if you like turn-based tactical RPG's. Overall the game is a fun experience. The biggest aspect of this game is gameplay and story. Other strengths such as atmosphere and tone create a nice world. Great soundtrack as well. 

Couple things to point out. The world map movement is point and click/adventure, which I did not expect to enjoy so much at first. This creates a little slower pacing then I am used to in other RPG's. Just kick back and relax during world map movement and you'll learn to enjoy it. 

Customization can be a ""gift or a curse,"" depending on your personality. Personally, the party customization screens were cumbersome and confusing for the first 5-8 hours. If you get overwhelemed at charcter customization screen, I recommend going with the default builds, or research other builds online for direction. Try not to waste allocating points until you decide on a main build. By the end of Chapter 1 you can handle all of the customization options though. If you love stats and numbers, you will no doubt enjoy the customization. Sometimes battles take party-management prep work before you engage. 

Overall the game is a good experience and I recommend it if you enjoy turn-based RPG's. Great story involvment. The game has a slower pacing, but this is not a bad thing. Just relax and enjoy the world, story, and gameplay!

A game shouldn't be decided if it is loved or hated solely based on other's experiences but rather on if it is appealing to you. With that said I gave it a Yes since even though it does has it flaws, I personally enjoyed it. Now to the nitty gritty part.

What this game is (if you couldn't tell already) is a turn based DnD style type of game and it is heavily based on DnD mechanics. For those that don't know DnD, Here is a quick breakdown on how combat works: Roll for initiative (i.e. RNGesus happens at the beginning of each battle to determine who goes first), move characters around the map and you can do an action like attack, cast a spell, drink a potion or place a trap. Or you can just wait until your next turn. This process continues until every character has made a move/action. Then it is back to the top and you keep taking turns and making actions until either you or the enemy is dead.

Now, keep in mind that this game is RNGesus based and that even though you have 90% chance to hit that doesn't mean you'll hit..just like DnD. 

To keep this short...also my spelling is bad...

Pros: Interesting characters, combat is intuitive and changes per environment (i.e. environment interaction), very challenging scenarios (for those that like to get kicked around). 

Cons: Very challenging scenarios (for those that want to get spoon fed victory), Character customization is limited (you can create a rouge/mage or a hunter warrior but you can't create something like a palidin where you hit people in the faces with maces and then cast cure. Reason being is that wearing heavy ""Metallic"" armor takes away your ability to cast spells and regen mana. This is a con for me because I wanted to roll a palibro). Keep in mind if you do a split class like rouge/mage you will have more skills/abilities however you won't be as strong as a pure rouge or a pure mage.",1419437329,1419437329,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ich meine damit, dieses Spiel besteht aus Kämpfen. Zwischen den Kämpfen wechsle ich die Standorte auf einer Weltkarte während die lineare Story in sehr gut vertonten Dialogen und gelegtlichen Zwischensequenzen erzählt wird. Die Verschrobenheit des ganzen verleiht ihm einen ungewöhnlichen Charm. Die Charaktere wirken am Anfangs wie RPG Standart, man täuscht sich aber den sie sind so verschroben wie die Story und transportieren durchaus DSA-Flair. Städte verfügen nur über eine sehr eingeschränkte Ansicht eines Marktpaltzes und rudimentären Optionen, was Schade ist den da hätte die DSA-Welt viel mehr zu bieten. 

Nun zu den Kämpfen.  Die sind schwer und erfodern oft eine bestimmte Taktik, so dass man die wichtigen Kämpfe meistens wenigstens einmal wiederholen muss. Brain-Off geklicke kann man sich sparen. Das Kampfsystem basiert auf dem DSA-Regelwerk mit einigen Modifikationen. ( Die Modifikationen betreffen Manöver und Zauber: Sie wurden so verändert, dass Magie und Nahkampf ausgeglichener sind. Wer DSA kennt weiß, dass Magie eher durch Ressourcenknappheit gebalanced ist. In BG findet ihr eine Regeneration von Astralpunkten mit einem Punkt pro Runde dafür  wurde die Wirkungsdauer von zaubern massive verkürzt und sie haben nur eine Aktion Zauberdauer. Manöver und Zauber skallieren wie in Darkensang in einem 7 Talentpunkte schritt. Eigene Ansagen gibt es nicht) => Quasi eine Mix aus Ad&D und DSA). Einige Veränderung kann ich Nachvollziehen andere nicht. Der Nachteil an dem ganzen ist klar, dass die Fähigkeiten mit allen 7 Talentpunkten massiv besser werden und so dass progressive DSA 4.1 Steigerungsgefühl auf der Strecke bleibt. Man spart sich aber das Qualitätsproben Prinzip und verhindert so, dass man immer aufs Kampflog starrt. 
Die Magie-Modifikationen sind auch klar, das RAW system wäre für ein Spiel dieser Art einfach zu öde. Positiv an der Magie ist die implementierung von Zaubern wie dem Fortifex Arkanewand oder degleichen, die Einfluß auf das Kartendesign haben. Im wesentlichen hat aber die Reduktion des DSA-Regelwerks den Sinn, dem Spieler das Studium des DSA-Regelwerks zu ersparen und die Aktionsdichte zuerhöhen. 

Fazit: Black Guards macht einiges anders und das ganz Gut. Es ist mehr ein DSA Dogfight Game mit nem RPG Charaktersystem und kein Rollenspiel. Dafür ist es aber sehr gut.",1419417883,1419417883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

包括玩家可以放的陷阱在內，有太多致命等級的地形效果，甚至有些地圖可以說是包含解謎要素的程度

舉個例來說，在很前面有一關墓地，3隻骷髏怪都是穿刺武器無效(弓箭、匕首)，
如果隊上剛好都用穿刺武器，法師MP又不夠...只能讀檔了

技能配點與戰鬥是採用TRPG系統，包括命中迴避也是擲骰，所以有時會很腦羞的miss連發

不過這遊戲S/L設計算是很方便，戰鬥中不能存檔，但可以直接重開戰鬥，
另一個自動存檔會存在上一次戰鬥結束後，所以要重新配裝之類的都還算來得及

戰場上不能從背包換武器或是使用藥水，只能從預設的3種武器組合中切換，
而藥水、陷阱、毒藥、繃帶跟投擲武器，都只有放在腰帶的才能使用，
腰帶早期頂多1、2格，後來才會出現4格的

戰鬥完不會回血回魔，MP自然回復很慢，所以要常住旅館或在野外休息(消耗食物)，
睡覺不會回復傷口，傷口要找醫療所或自己用繃帶，相對的，醫療所不會回復MP

魔法很強，但是藥水非常貴又不好攜帶，MP耗非常兇總量也少回復又慢，所以魔法要做為主要武裝是很困難的
另外魔法一樣會MISS，越高級MISS率越高，當花了超過一半MP放一招大魔法卻MISS時，是真的該認真考慮讀檔

角色太少是致命傷，中間會例經一次劇情換角，隊伍=角色數最大是5個，每個人的特色都非常的明確，
除了主角由玩家自己決定，主角一開始可以從3個職業預組或自行分配點數，
整體來說，這是一個很精美的策略式戰棋TRPG遊戲，

This is (luckily in my eyes) a typical The Dark Eye game. If you do not know this RPG system: it's Germany's biggest and probably oldest Pen & Paper RPG system that is still maintained.

You will not be able to simply start this game, kill some enemies and have fun. You really need to have a look at the rule system and how all the character values influence your fighting, casting and other skills. The same goes for spending your experience points, if you simply raise a stat here and there you will find the game very hard and probably quit. If you decide what role a character will have and raise the necessary stats and skills for this you will have a much easier time and will be able to enjoy the very complex fight options.

One definitive pro from my point of view are the really varied battle maps. Most maps have unique interactive features that you can use in the battle, like alchimistic tables that will poison bystanders when smashed. Or drawbridges that can be raised or lowered. Or cranes with crates that might smash your heroes from the docks - or the enemies if you position yourself smart enough.

The biggest frustration I've had, came from the loading screens. Simply put, any change in location (Map, Street, Battlefield) will have to go through a loading screen. It gets old very quickly.

The character customisation is not necessarily the strongest point of this game, with only one character entirely customisable (the main character), and a few different companions pre-defined, there won't be enough room to craft a custom team.
That being said, I understand that it is better suited for someone new to the genre. Personally I didn't mind it too much.

・自由で楽しいキャラクター育成
・安心と信頼のダークアイユニバース
・公式日本語版

悪い点
・キャラ育成に失敗すると恐らく詰む
・スキル説明文などが少々解りにくい
・戦闘において運要素が大きい

戦闘部分はヘックスタイプのターン制SRPGです。
主人公のみ簡単なメイキングが出来、仲間は固定キャラ。
戦士か魔法使いかの違い以外は共通なので自由に育成できます。

ただ、自キャラクターを純戦士でメイクする意味は余りないでしょう。
戦士は魔法系スキルを一切取得出来ない代わりに、
ヘルス等にある程度ボーナスがありますが…

単に回復魔法を使えるだけでヘルス差は埋まってしまいますし
攻撃魔法に対するレジストは魔法使いでないととれません。
純戦士として育てる場合でも、魔法使いであったほうが有利という
若干本末転倒な状態になってしまっています。

またスキル説明文にも注意が必要です。
アクティブスキルが実質パッシブスキルである事等がままあるので…
中でもノックダウン耐性を高めるスキル等は全員ある程度伸ばしておかないと
地形で転げまわってまともに戦闘出来ない羽目に陥るでしょう。

実際プレイすると面白いゲームであるにも関わらず評価がいまいちなのは、
このあたりのシステム的な不親切さにあるような気がしてなりません。

クリアしたマップの再プレイは不可で無限に育成する事は出来ないので、
戦闘が増えるUntold Legends DLCも購入したほうが良いでしょう。

Chance to hit of 65% or lower is normal for everything but a basic melee attack even when you've pretty much maxed out your character's relevant stats and weapon skill, and that 65% is actually more like 30% chance to hit because the percentage shown is just your character's accuracy. Your attack can and will still be parried or dodged half that percentage again.

You have to buff your characters with magic before they're worth a damn, but guess what. The magic has a chance of success too. So until you spend a few thousand points levelling up your mages' stats and getting them a certain ability, the highest chance of success with casting spells is ~85%. But I don't know how many times I had a mage miscast 4-5 times in a row even with a (supposedly) 80-90% chance of success.

You lose more battles because of unlucky streaks of whiffed attacks and spells fizzling out than you do from anything else.

In short, it was fun for a while, but became tedious by the end. It's worth picking up for $5 or so, because I really loved the battle set ups (there's very few boring battles because most try to do something unique and no two are the same) and the style of the game, but there's just too much wrong with it to be worth full price.",1419073429,1419073429,False,3,0,0.536787211894989014,0,False,False,False,False,,,

    -Story was really good
    -Loved the gameplay(turn based combat and how cities were handled)
    -Lots of sidequests
    -Really nice char development ""tree""

Cons:
    -There are known bugged achievements(0.2% players have this) that noone can seem to get and also there are some achivs that some ppl get and other can't get even tho they did the same things that ppl who got em did..
    -Forums are full of achiv problems and noone has heard anything from the developers for a long time(for at least 6 months if not more)
    -The world map is huge wich is really great BUT this game takes place on only like 30% of the map the other 70% might be used in the sequel so that kinda sucked cos I was really looking foward to playing even more of the game but then I just went to the last chapter
    -The main hero has 4 male and female char models, they could have made it a lil bit more customisable

Conclusion:
A great game sadly ruined by sh*t developers who dont care.

This year is fortunately again fruitful for this style and is experiencing a minor revival. How, then turned one such RPG from relatively unknown Daedalic Entertainment?

Right at the beginning, after selecting a new game in the menu, the player can choose either the simplified selection of attributes, or expert, according as it is familiar with the style board game The Dark Eye. In the selection of the division are three different professions, namely Warrior, Magician and Hunter. In addition, it is possible to choose from several preset face and sex. Already here, I have to criticize that particular types of female faces look sometimes very belligerent manner and at the same time from each other and a little different. Overall graphics page, especially dealing with details of the figure was weaker.

The second setting, ie expert player allows much more extensive treatment of the characters and follow the rules of points. Basically, a player has a choice to 10,000 points, labeled BD from which you can then has any assembly dream champion. At the outset, it must pay 500 if you want to have a magical character. After this selection opens a few talent trees, which can be additionally porozdeľovať points to a maximum of up to 14 properties, the talents and spells 8. However, while playing and later acquire new levels of these attributes can continue to accrue. Points can be reallocated in several areas, namely core values, Fighting talent, talents, spells, and finally special skills. It is important to all of these points divided as effectively as possible, because after creating new characters and the plot itself enters into all the remaining points are canceled.

The core values are called major modifiers in creating characters, namely strength, charisma etc., these in turn affect many elements such as the capacity of heroes, the number of lives, or the ability to communicate with the outside world and the characters in it. Between fighting talent then there are various weapons from daggers, crossbows over, after two-handed swords. By investing points into the player's weapons of course increases the attack or the defense of a given type of weapon, depending on how it is set. Among the talent is also possible to choose from nine different talents. For example, the ability of the trap, which allows the player to identify, considered, or even defuse traps or Ranhojičstvo, which in turn allows the player to heal from injuries. We walk the kids, which are of course only applicable if a player chooses a character magician. Spells are divided between the offensive and strengthening and debilitating. Found them quite a decent amount of fans and fiery, respectively. ice magic school here will surely enjoy. Finally, we get the special abilities, which are different upgrades for close combat, ranged or magic, or even passive abilities.

Edit character is indeed fairly complex and enthusiasts making such tailor-made nature of certain very pleased. Conversely, players who want to jump into the story as soon as possible to be able to circumvent these adjustments using automatic reallocation of points in the selection of the games.

Whether a player chooses to basic or expert mode, after completion of the selection starts intro and the player is familiar with the mysterious death of Princess Elanor. Here are gradually unveiled on different battle tactics such as moving figures after hexagonal boxes, or attacking. However, the main protagonists are caught in a stationary body guards pathetic Princess and cast him into prison. The initial steps of the story thus seek out of this place and the run will help the player and other figures rough dwarf Naurima and individually mage Zurbaran. Later, therefore, the player will control the widening of the characters, and it is therefore important to learn the capabilities and advantages make the most of the fight.

It should be noted that the combat encounters tend to be really hard sometimes, or vice versa, sometimes very simple. At times it can be unpredictable for the game, which depends on various calculations, attack, defense, and to recover the attack power of intervention, and the like. Another element is the very place where the fight takes place. You should be commended on one side of the creators, because these so-called arenas are interactive and can be, for example, to hide his magician for any obstacle from enemies and calmly zosielať healing spells at his comrades, or even drop, for example luster on unsuspecting opponents. On the other hand, sometimes these interactive game environment, they can do very easily, so will everyone else struggle and it's up to the player as will be careful to monitor the area in which the fight takes place and whether it will be able to benefit or not.

After deliverance from prison pending player main story line, which is of course finding a clarification of the death of the Princess, in which the main character was involved already. Later, however, the procedure of the story in five different chapters player looks at different places of the world and in addition to the main storyline is of course possible to perform a secondary task, which can be obtained, for example, also visited cities around the world.

As regards the visual side of the game is not any graphical champion, but what should be on-screen instructions, it handles. The environments are quite varied and dark stomp the player gets to the green meadows, respectively. in different forests or cities. After zooming in, however, and examining the details of the characters come often unpleasant experience, which is especially noticeable when prestrihových animation. The game simply can not cope with these details, but I must say that in this type of RPG is not a graphics page and so important.

Audio is contrary to the relatively high level of quality musical accompaniment and a good dubbing. The only thing you can criticize the common neprecítenie some situations Daberas (initial torture when choosing a female protagonist in the prison).

Это пошаговая РПГ, которую можно охарактеризовать скорее как «набор боевых локаций-арен», на которых группе управляемых игроком героев необходимо выполнить определенные действия: уничтожить всех противников, добежать до определенной точки, сопроводить персонажа до определенной точки и т.д. и т.п. Подобный геймплей на удивление не надоедает. Каждая локация-арена индивидуальна и нарисована вручную, нет ни одной повторяющейся арены. При этом на аренах много интерактивных объектов, которые можно использовать в сражениях в свою пользу (ловушки, ящики, ямы и т.д.) Между аренами ваши герои передвигаются по карте мира, на которой отмечены разные локации и города. Каждая локация представляет собою один статичный экран, где вы можете выполнять ряд действий (сходить к целителю, посетить таверну или кузнеца и т.д.)

Прокачка героев основана на немецкой настольной системе Dark eye. При этом герои не ограничены в прокачке своим классом, т.е. вы можете создавать гибридные классы и мульти-классы. Минусы игры также тянут свои корни с этой системы, в бою активно используются броски кубиков, так что, даже находясь лицом к лицу с врагом, ваш герой-двуручник может промахнуться. Учитывайте и то, что кубики выпадают очень странно, так что если у вас допустим шанс попадания 65%, то это фактически означает, что вы будете промахиваться три раза из пяти. По этой причине целые классы и варианты оружия являются фактически бесполезными. При этом оружия в игре мало, а для некоторых типов (например длинные мечи) в игре предусмотрено и вовсе два-три варианта, так что всю игру пробегать с одним мечом вполне реально. 

Сюжет игры и характеры героев интересны, сказывается то, что игру выпустила кампания Daedalic, на счету которой много интересных квестов. Однако ко второй половине игры, геймплей начинает надоедать, игра провисает и в какой-то момент возникнет желание сделать перерыв. Впрочем своих денег игра стоит, особенно если вы любитель пошаговых партийных РПГ.

The main problem is that it's built around an obscure role playing system that is both punishing and not fun. It's based on the Dark Eye role playing system in Germany. It's a fairly punishing system that gives too much power to the RNG and not enough to the player. 

What do I mean by that?

It's just no fun having a 50/50 chance of casting a spell fail 6 or 7 times in a row and that costing you a battle. It's luck, not tactics or skill, that will get you through battles and luck doesn't make for a fun game. The ""tactics"" are minimal and your choices in leveling a character are severely restricted because if you don't take certain paths with certain classes you simply won't be able to proceed through the battles. This is the core problem with the game. It's like playing chess with an RNG. It simply defeats the purpose.

The game wants you to play it one way. It discourages experimentation and creativity while demanding that you play it the ""right"" way with the ""right"" skill and classes or woe to the user. This isn't a strategy game but more of a puzzle and one that's not fun to piece together. Either you read a guide or you will be forced to start over at some point. That's just really poor design.

As for the other aspects of the game, consider me unimpressed. The voice acting is truly horrible and the plotline is both forgettable and so dumb as to be insulting to the player. You can't rotate the camera and often enemies are obscured. The graphics are decent but nothing fantastic. The videos stutter and tend to happen too often. 

When it comes right down to it, there's really nothing redeeming about Blackguards beyond the fact that when you finally uninstall it you'll clear up 17GB of hard drive space to use for something better.

Money is sparce at best and you can never afford anything but the essencials.  If you picked a ranged charcter like I did, assume all your gold is going to provisions, healers and arrows.  

No farming, since you can't just go get in an random battles, if you have an area to explore it is best to visit every location to get all the EXP you can.  

Make sure you save in multiple save slots, you can get yourself in a chain of mission that you just can't win without an extra provision or something.  If you don't have that save game from before you trigger the chain of events you could be stuck.

One last thing, don't be afraid to click end turn 50 times in a row if monsters aren't activated to get your magic points back and heal everyone and then get them back of to be ready for combat.

玩家扮演一位护卫，在护送公主时遇袭，在她奋力抵抗敌人时，公主被一头饿狼咬死，玩家被诬为凶手，关进了地牢等候处决，但最终主角在一个矮人的帮助下逃出了牢笼，她要去查寻线索，洗刷自己的罪名，找到真正的凶手为自己和公主复仇。
游戏在传统的SRPG上做了大量的变革和创新，制作者试图将极高的游戏性作为核心内容呈献给玩家，因此在冒险上简化了设计，所有的旅程都是在冒险地图上一步抵达，城镇只有一张包含了商人和npc的全景，而地城探险则是标有各种事件触发位置的平面图，玩家在其中行动时并不需要自己来走动，而是直接在地图上的关键位置间移动，这种设计简化了冒险旅途，因为制作公司是制作静态画面居多的冒险游戏出身，所以这也让制作者可以制作自己擅长的背景画面和情节及对话。
游戏的角色属性是一套复杂的系统，人物在冒险中通过战斗和事件获得AP，基础属性、武器熟练程度、技能和魔法的成长全部需要AP，并且属性会限制所能穿戴的装备和技能的学习，所以如何取舍非常有限的AP来打造特定方向的人物，这是游戏自始至终需要考虑的东西。战斗方面我觉得不算简单，战斗中每一步的策略都至关重要，硬打硬冲很难取胜，玩家需要AP花销得当、合理选择交战地点、发挥己方特长、谨慎选择行为方能取胜，并且利用周边环境也是重要的一环，比如用火球炸落洞顶的石笋扎伤敌人，或是用魔法制造障碍，将坦途变成关隘，阻止敌人的围攻等等。
较高的难度和策略性以及引人入胜的情节是这个游戏吸引了一批SRPG爱好者的原因，但他也有一些问题，透露出Daedalic在此类游戏上经验的不足，比如冒险过程过于简化，游戏变得像S-AVG了；游戏的难度忽高忽低，有的简单得发指，忽然又难得让人无语；游戏中钱太容易消耗，造成前期一直窘迫，越弱越没钱，越没钱越弱，新人上手成为问题。

[b]Pro:[/b]
-Round-based strategy game (its like X-Com but with an actual story!)
-complex character builds are possible and a lot of content (there are 5 chapters but I am still in the middle of chapter 3 after 19 hours of gameplay)

Unfortunately the negative points are too much of an issue to recommend this game

[b]Contra[/b]
-all towns kinda look the same and it gets repetive if you don't love grinding and collecting item sets
-incredibly difficult to play because of unbalanced setup ( since you can build every character the same, you basically choose between characters that can use magic and characters which dont)
-RNG makes your game so much more painful and very frustrating ( e.g. you have 2 casters who got a success spell cast of 93% but both still fail 3 times in a row which leads to an abortion of the spells; similar cases also with 95% melee hit chance and still missing several times)

I don't know what the numbers of these probabilities are for, since they do not reflect the actual probability of hit or miss, but probably its a feature and not a bug. As long as this issue is not fixed, I cannot recommend at all.

Update (after finishing the game):
Another negative point: story is extremly linear. Your choices make no difference at all, because the outcome is always the same.

Unfortunately, the dialogue is stilted and often disjointed and the gameplay is dense and perhaps overly complicated.

The dice rolls are punishing and heavily weighted towards failure.  It is laughably common to miss 3 75% chances in a row and taking a risk on anything under a 50% chance is pretty much a guaranteed miss.   It has been said on various forums that there are many mechanics that are affecting the probabilities that don't appear in the shown hit chance.  That sounds to me like a User Interface failure and a pretty important one at that.  

Perhaps the most glaring issue of this is the arena fights at the beginning of Chapter 2.  When you have to pull off 6 hits in a row to kill the first enemy and then another 8 hits to kill the second.  Unfortunately you A) will die in 3 hits, B) Will get poisoned if you take a single hit, and C) the NPCs don't have an issue with the weighted hit dice.  Add to this the fact that you can't go back and level due to your captivity, can't buy potions (though the enemy gets 2 or 3) and lose all of your items means that you are pretty much screwed.

I love the Dark Eye world and the gritty fantasy found therein and I feel that this game does not disappoint.  

PROS

1) THE CHARACTERS! I adored the main characters and genuinely felt that each line of dialogue between them was solid gold.  Every one of them had a great personality and contributed to the overall value of this game a great deal.

2) The Dialogue and Story: You can take it or leave it but I what I came across I enjoyed.  While it is true that the story is linear and doing side-missions does nothing but help you grind this was never an issue for me.  I liked the story and the direction it was taken.  You're a bad guy doing bad things for the right reasons and it is not often to come across something that does this trope well.  The game does a great job of putting you into the ""antihero"" mentality.  

3) Combat: This game does not hold your hand.  You WILL redo fights, you WILL get frustrated, and unless you know how to build your stats and abilities you WILL fall behind but as long as you play your hand correctly you will always be able to win the next fight.  Similar to older iterations of D&D (which Die Schwarze Auge/The Dark Eye is the German equivalent of more or less) there are weapon AND damage types to consider.  Knowing what kind of weapons and what kind of damage types to use are crucial against certain enemies.  For example, DON'T USE PIERCING AGAINST THE UNDEAD!  They are completely immune to anything that doesn't impart massive physical trauma to their skeleton like slashing or bashing weapons would.  Some enemies are immune to poison, some to magic, and some to physical damage.  It will be trial and error to figure this out but this is also why you can equip each character with three different weapon load-outs which you can cycle through in combat so as to avoid being harmless to a specific enemy.  Other things to note about combat include the diversity of places you will fight in (it makes you feel like you're actually traveling from place to place), the importance of positioning, the use of environmental effects to your advantage, and bottlenecking.  Combat is the meat and potatoes to this game and after 50+ hours of this game I, for one, can say that it does not get old.

4) Stat Systems and Leveling: DO NOT RAISE BASE STATS! At least not at first.  This game offers a wide variety of upgrade paths with which you can take your party in a multitude of directions.  Wanna be a crazy hefty tank? Upgrade Warcraft, Body Control, Willpower, Strength, Vitality, and the proficiency of two weapons of your choice.  Wanna be everywhere and piercing armor? Upgrade Agility, Body Control, Spear proficiency, Dexterity, and Vitality for that damage you are most certainly going to take.  Wanna mage it up?  Take Bow proficiency, level your spells like crazy (a hefty investment), and make sure you have a tank or two between you and the enemy.  While some might bemoan the lack of class options with there only being three, Warrior, Ranger, and Mage, it isn't that large of an issue.  This is not a game about diplomacy or sneaking around (ignoring two or three AWFUL missions that can be solved with fighting), it's about slugging it out with the enemy.  To play something that doesn't contribute to the fight directly is to take a difficult game and make it impossible.

5) Grittiness: I consider this a plus because I like games that force you to be aware of the number of arrows in your quiver, how absolutely vital healing can be, and how huge a difference is made when you finally buy that new axe that does ONE MORE DAMAGE.  This is a game where all the small things add up over time to take your party from bandit npcs to gods on the battlefield.  Throughout the game you can also learn special attacks which give you advantages in certain situations such as inflicting wounds (Wounds and HP Damage are totally separate things), knocking down enemies, or doing more damage from a distance with ranged weaponry.  The larger and more valuable the effect the more costly the attack will be in terms of accuracy so a very effective trade-off between damage/utility and accuracy is established.

6) The World: Not much to say aside from how much I enjoyed it and all the people you come across.  It is VERY uncommon for you to run across nice individuals so when you do you instantly grow attached to them.  Even then most of the ""nice"" people you come across are still awful by today's standards due to their desires to brainwash, enslave, or kill off rivals for a plethora of reasons.  Aventuria (the world) isn't a great place and it's heroes reflect that, but maybe, with a great deal of effort, you can change that.

CONS

1) The Probability System: IT LIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! Never in a game have I missed five consecutive instances of hitting with a 95% chance of my attack succeeding each time.  It is without a doubt the single most irritating and detracting point to this whole game.  Until you play Blackguards you will not understand how infuriating it can be.  It doesn't just apply to physical attacks, though.  Your spells will fizzle out and do nothing, your arrows can randomly vanish, you will fail body tests where you have a 99% chance of passing and fall down.  This was a HUGE oversight on the part of the developers and if they would just release a patch that made these percentages more accurate I would have nothing against this RPG.

2) POISONS and Enemy Buffs! In the latter half of the campaign in an attempt to balance the gameplay the developers just decided to either give the enemies a flat magic stat buff or give all of their attacks the poison quality which will do continuous damage or give you a stat debuff for the rest of the fight.  Not nearly as irritating as the percentage issue but it does somewhat cheapen the joy you get when your party goes into an encounter that you should faceroll only to discover that the enemy basically leveled up with you.

3) Stat Building: While I did mention this as a plus earlier you can very easily destroy your game by building poorly.  Seeing as how there is no way to undo this it can prove to be game ruining.  

Overall, I would give this experience a solid 8/10.  Fun from beginning to end and if you see it on sale for less than 10 you should instantly snatch it up.",1417838803,1417838803,True,7,0,0.61504364013671875,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ok, mi análisis personal y subjetivo del juego, primero lo bueno:

- El mundo que plantea.
Aunque el entorno en el que se desarrolla el juego son un puñado de ciudades y no vemos nada global, es suficiente para ver que tiene potencial y una bonita fotografía.

- El combate.
Tiene algunos aspectos positivos a resaltar:
El tablero es único en cada batalla.
El árbol de posibilidades tácticas es muy amplio, aunque no se pueda explorar en una única partida.
Hay diferentes misiones de combate que amenizan la partida.

- La historia.
Un aprobado por los pelos sigue siendo un aprobado, tiene escasas opciones de dialogo que afectan poco o nada al resultado.
El final te deja con tal cara de tonto que yo llegué a pensar que a mi juego le faltaban trozos.

Lo malo:

- La cantidad y frecuencia de cargas es absurda.
- La IA en combate es de las peores que he visto y al carecer de modo multijugador se desperdicia la mejor baza del juego.
- Es corto.
- Buscar las misiones secundarias con tanta carga entre pantallas es muy molesto.
- Es muy simple:
Tiene tres pantallas básicas, tablero de batalla, cuidad y mapa. Todo el potencial del juego está en el combate y, como ya he dicho, la IA no está a la altura ni hay modo multijugador.
- No es juego para más de una partida, por lo que sus arboles de habilidades se desperdician.

I used to recommend this game, as I really liked it. After I got it, I played through several times, and despite some overly complex -- and not well explained -- aspects, it was a (mostly) fun game. I especially liked the humor, the fact that there wasn't always a clear ""good"" choice, and that even when there was, it wasn't always mechanically superior -- i.e. better rewards for being ""good"". It was refreshingly muddy on morality.
But, recently, I'd seen some comments online referencing ""crashes"" being the reason people stopped playing. So I just played through again -- and it crashed a half dozen times in my playthrough. I still enjoyed going back through this game, but I had the benefit of already understanding the confusing character sheet and knowing how to budget my xp and  money well -- what to buy and when.
I think it's more than likely that most people who ran into the random -- and seemingly non-reproducible -- crashes I did won't get very far, especially with all the other aggravating factors.
If you can get past the crashes, and remember to diversify the party, while focusing each character, you can have a lot of fun with it. But if you want a quick dive in for fun, go elseware.",1417753215,1503954417,False,0,0,0.498516291379928589,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You get Blackguards!

Blackguards is another in a string of games recently that have such wonderful aspects about them and yet have some fatal flaw that sabotages every good experience you have with it.  That flaw is that the game straight-up cheats.  Now I'd normally be the first person to say ""suck it up you sissy, it's meant to be challenging.""  But there's a big difference between something that is genuinely challenging, and something that cheats.

-I can't tell you how many times I laughed my butt off watching the number of ways the game abused my characters.  Character killed before anyone can act in a battle.  No problem, reload.  Character recovers from knock down only to be knocked down once more with no apparent cause?  No problem, reload.  The game is full of this kind of stuff.  Prepare to be ""loved"" in the most brutal way by this game.  There's little else that you can do other than laugh about it...it's baked in.

-Ignore any percentages to succeed on anything you do.  They're meaningless.  You'll realize it's all BS after your 10th time of failing when it says you have a 100% chance of success.  This will be driven home even harder when you see your character who has maxxed out stats in his chosen weapon, the champion of the arena, outfitted in the best gear, and still being unable to hit some highwayman in leather armor.  And if you do, it will be a small percentage of the damage that guy can do to you.  It's depressing, really. 

-Forget tactics.  They really have no place here.  You'll find some style that works with your approach to games and work it over and over again (as best as the broken mechanics will let you of course).  The game doesn't give you much reason to try anything else, and you won't want to because you're just trying desperately to win some battle.  

It's like the designers were unable to find a way to make the game challenging besides giving the enemies a wholly unfair advantage.  And that's what it feels like...cheap and dirty hits.  That might be ok if it was built into the story and somehow made sense.  But when it's the developers that are doing it, you really don't feel like supporting them again.  

Which is a shame, because if they tweaked just that one thing...that one small thing...to play by the rules...it would be pretty enjoyable.  There's a lot of content, some really funny breaking-the-4th-wall comedy, amazing production values in some areas (the world map), and combat with some moderate depth. But alas, it was not meant to be.

Meiner Meinung nach ganz oft Genörgel auf hohem Niveau. Fast hätte auch ich mich davon abschrecken lassen.

Gibt es Blackguards irgendwo im Sale, bekommt man für wenige Euro ein fantastisches Spiel. Daedalic kann einfach Geschichten erzählen und Daedalic kann uns knorrige Charaktere präsentieren, die einem wahrlich an Herz wachsen können. So auch bei Blackguards.

Die Geschichte folgt  einem kringeligen roten Faden, soll heißen, dass die Erzählung nicht strikt linear verläuft, sondern hie und da mal ein wenig abschweift, was dem Gesamteindruck aber eher zugute kommt. Die Vertonung der Spielfiguren ist auffällig gut gemacht. Man hat professionelle Sprecher engagiert, die ihren Job größtenteils sehr gut machen. Kaum ein Spiel hat solch eine schöne (deutsche) Sprachausgabe.

Die dynamische Hintergrundmusik ist ebenfalls von allererster Güte. Sehr stimmungsvoll, abwechlungsreich, teils orchestral, teils verspielt. Manches Mal habe ich den Sound aufgedreht, um diese tolle Musik zu genießen. Sonst habe ich die Spielmusik immer gern auf minimaler Lautstärke, nicht so bei Blackguards.

Die Kämpfe sind allesamt hochspannend, Jeder Kampf findet auf einem eigens designten Spielfeld statt. Mit jeweils eigenen Herausforderungen und Taktiken. So viel Abwechslung findet man selten. Ganz das Gegenteil von Level-Recycling a'la DragonAge2. Mit fortschreitendem Spiel werden die Gegner weder übermächtig noch langwelig.  Schwache Gegner finden sich plötzlich in einer, für sie sehr vorteilhaften Umgebung, starke Gegner lassen sich oft durch geschickte Einbeziehung der Umgebung doch noch besiegen.

Das oft kritisierte Zufallsprinzip, der DSA-Würfel,, ja, das gibt es und ja, es nervt bisweilen und ja, auch ich habe schon in die Tischkante gebissen, wenn mein Flammenzauber im entscheidenden Moment versagt oder mein Held danebenhaut. Oft bleiben Gegner mit nur einem einzigen HItpoint übrig, die in der nächsten Runde dann ebenso derbe austeilen, als wenn sie noch ganz gesund wären und dummerweise einen meiner Leute binden, der dem Dödel dann in der nächsten Runde den letzten Punkt wegkloppt. Allerdings .. und das ist immer wieder Grund schadenfrohen Gelächters, die KI haut auch daneben oder versemmelt irgendwelche Zauber. Wenn ein Kampf mal ganz blöd läuft, manchmal entscheidet es sich im ersten Zug, ob der Kampf gewonnen oder verloren wird, kann man ihn wiederholen und bei jedem Start, werden die Ausgangsparameter neu ausgewürfelt.
Ganz ehrlich, grad auch dieses Zufallsprinzip auf beiden Seiten macht die Kämpfe sehr spannend. Nicht selten gewinnt man einen aussichtslosen Kampf trotzdem noch, weil dem Gegner die entscheidenden Aktionen misslingen und man selbst ausnahmsweise mal unverschämtes Glück hat.

Neulinge würden sich in dem verwirrenden Skill- und Talentsystem vielleicht nicht auf Anhieb zurechtfinden, man kann sich ohne weiteres total verskillen und hat dann später wohl kaum noch eine Chance, Kämpfe für sich zu entscheiden. RPG-gestählte Spieler finden sich schnell zurecht und wissen wohl auch intuitiv, worauf es ankommt. Da ist Blackguards ganz klassisch und nicht überraschend. Ein kleiner Hinweis für den Spielanfang: die passiven Skills wie Ausweichen und Parieren werden erst im späteren Spiel gern mal das Zünglein an der Waage sein, hier ab und an mal ein übriggebliebenes Pünktchen zu investieren, wird sich später auszahlen.

Fazit:
Alles in allem kann ich Blackguards jedem wärmstens ans Herz legen, der der Rundenstrategie im Fantasy Universum etwas abgewinnen kann. Es erwartet einen eine liebevoll erzählte Geschichte, stimmungsvolle Begleitmusik, den ein oder anderen knorrigen Charakter, spannende und immer wieder einzigartige Kämpfe und ein sehr stimmiges Setting.

A solid turn-based combat Roleplay game, with interesting fights, varying win scenarios, and no game-changing +50% damage trinkets.


[u] The way the game played out for me. [/u]
[list] 
[*] First, customise your character with a wide variety of spells, talents, and stats. There are quite a few options, here.
[*] Next, crawl through a vast variety of well-designed maps and interesting combat scenarios, in the turn-based strategy style.
[*] Marvel at the lack of decent gear... even in the final chapters. :P
[*] Get frustrated by missing 3x 90% (incorrectly labelled ~ more accurately 50% chance) hits in a row >  [b]adapt by using weaker abilities with 95% hit chance[/b]. Win.
[*] Use reasoning skills to work out the win condition, when the game doesn't spoonfeed you how to succeed > Win.
[*] Delve deeper into the well written storyline.
[*] Contemplate right vs wrong, and the way human societies functions.
[*] Watch a few thrown-together and anticlimactic final cutscenes.. (due credit to there being a few alternative endings).
[*] Decide not to make another char and start again, because you're intimate knowledge of the skills/talents/stats would make you a God on 'normal'... and increasing the difficulty level would just cause the more annoying aspects of the game to become too much to be enjoyable.
[/list]


--------------*[i] See last paragraph for a list of helpful hints [/i]**--------------------

[u]The pro's and con's:[/u]

[b]Pro's:[/b]
[list]
[*] Interesting maps, and scenario's.
[*] Great range of character stats to customise. These stats actually made a significant difference to how your character could be played.
[*] Sometimes required me to stop - think about why I just lost - adapt. Rather than just steamrolling through every scenario.
        Especially, when 2-star enemies start appearing.
[*] Sometimes required me to work out the puzzle of how to win the map. (Despite some other reviewers' comments, this rarely required chain-learning trap locations *but even when it did I could have put points into Traps (talent) to over come this* - see above point about actually [b]strategising[/b] instead of gratuitous wins).
[*] Well written story, and voice acting. Particularly, the wide range of accents.
[*] The overarching theme of the dialogue was thought provoking, with concepts of anarchism, liberalism, and competing social values.
[*] [i] No ""+50% damage trinkets."" [/i]
[/list]

[b] Con's: [/b]
[list]
[*] [i] No ""+50% damage trinkets;"" in fact, upgrades were very hard to come by, with the best gear in the game being only marginally better than the starting level gear. [/i]
[*] The lack of gear-based character improvement makes Adventure Points essential for creating an effectively optimised end-game character. It's important to get it right on the Character Creation screen.
[*] There's almost nothing worth buying, especially because main quests give you free full armor sets in Chapters 2 and 3. By the end of the game, I had over 1000gold and nothing to spend it on (the top level chest armor cost 50g) <- [i] This was only exacurbated by the need to regularly clear your inventory of unnecessary weight[/i]
[*] Around the second half of Chapter 3, 2-star enemies suddenly begun appearing - much stronger than 1-star enemies - receiving a huge buff to their stats and global buffs. (E.g. +8 attack, +2 dodge +20% Magic Resist buff for all enemies!!).  [i] their strength increased too much, too suddenly.[/i] 
[*] [u]Melee Hit chances are too low. Even with maxed out Attack from stats, Weapon Skills, and weapons/shields.[/u]
[*] By the end of the game, poorly scaled hit chance forced me to abandon my expensive big-hitting melee attacks (ie Hammer Blow - which I had spent over 3000 Adventure points in meeting these abilities' requirements). Was forced to use weak high hit chance abilities to even hit anything.
[*] By the end of the game, [u]the game forced me to abandon my dreams of a badass melee build[/u]; opting for 1Hander axe and sheild, instead.
[*] Boss enemies in the 4th and 5th Chapters regularly potioned to full health when falling below ~30% health.  Combined with the fact that I rarely hit melee attacks, it became frustratingly difficult to get through the last 10 or so damage in a single turn before they 100% healed.
[*] The game kept messing with my team synergies by [spoiler] taking away one of spell casters for long periods of time [/spoiler], and [spoiler]killing off my ranger[/spoiler].
[*] There are a few spells pretty much beat any enemy (example: [spoiler]Karnifilo Frenzy - the insane rage spell that makes groups of enemies kill each other[/spoiler])
[*] [u]Maps with many enemies became very slow due to the inability to skip enemy movement and attack animations.[/u] Even enemies that couldn't reach you due to blocked paths would run in this painfully time-consuming circle, in order to use up their movement points.
[*] Back-to-the-past missions took away your well synergised gang of fighters; instead, leaving you with a lone character that wasn't optimised for solo play. (I felt sorry for any spell-casters, here).
[*] In-game decisions make minimal differences to the actual gameplay - mostly just affect the cutscenes.
[/list]

[u]Helpful Hints:[/u]
[i]- Probably wouldn't put points into Treat Wounds (talent). Instead, get 13 points on one of your party member's Healing (spell), because it heals all wounds as well as being much more convenient.
- Don't allow you characters to remain wounded. 3 wounds will severely weaken any character.
- Team buffing & enemy debuffing spells are game changers!
- Rangers are actully pretty decent in this game, so long as you have a tank or two to keep enemies 5 hexagons away.
- If melee, don't bother going for Hammer Blow (tier 3 Abilty), nor Death Blow (tier 3) as their hit chances are way too low to provide reliable damage in the second half of the game. Tier 1 melee abilities remain viable the whole game due to their high chance to hit.
- Minimum 8 points in Body control (talent) for every character is ESSENTIAL; 8+ points in Willpower (talent) are helpful for every character. 
- 8 Points in Warfare (talents) and 8 points in Animal Lore (talents) are very useful for melee  and ranged characters.
- Defensive characters & spell casters should have relevant Weapon Skills of at least 8 points, and set to full defensive mode (for example, Zurbaran with 8 points in staves, with the sliding bar all the way to the left).
- Gear is so hard to come by in this game, so you need Adventure Points in order to improve you characters. Didn't bother putting any points into Charisma as it seems counter-intuitive to effectively reduce your Adventure Points just for easy conversation options.
- Finally, using poisons on you weapons is a great way to get through some impressive damage.[/i]",1417019252,1421156389,True,57,3,0.764433503150939941,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Playing Blackguards felt sort of like playing a chess match over and over again with the outcome being nearly entirely based on luck. Perhaps it boils down to the visuals not being all that visceral, but even things like positioning relative to the enemy seems to have no effect on combat outcomes. In the hour and a halfish I played I did little more than click on enemies and wait to either win or have to reload. It was as if the game was trying to distance itself from me.

The mechanics are broken (IE you get 1 parry a turn except for when you dont, that guy who has parried 3 attacks already, well your 100% to hit which you should never even have got because a 20 is a crit fail, he parried it because he also rolled a 20 on his parry roll, 4th parry out of the 1 he has per round),
They are also counter intuitive (fairly normal for a D&D clone),
And outright stupid (Why do shields give no bonus at all?  Why can you only switch your melee skill between offensive and defensive outside of battle, why does changing it make no difference?  Why can I get 100%s to hit when 19-20/20 is always a crit fail? etc.),
Random to an excessive level (Nothing you do means anything.  Your completely non melee focused mage can work better as a tank than your completely tank focused sword and board char.  Your spell which does 8-18 dmg (firebolt 2) actually rolls for between 3 and 27, before factoring in resists/weaknesses)
On top of that, the AI cheats (They get 100%s to hit fairly regularly, they can parry a seemingly infinite amount of times, they parry your 95%s to hit about 95% of the time, they still maintain accuracy despite having every possible debuff put on them, they get access to things like potions in fights where it is explicitly stated no one has them, they succeed/fail skill checks in a completely disproportionate amount to thier displayed chances of success (etc)),
The story is both unoriginal and bland,
The world is completely nonsensical, you can walk across what is described as a ""Vast empire"" and back in less than a day,
Apart from your PC, Naurim and the fat mage, all of the voice actors are phoning it in, especially Neera (or whatever she is called),
The game is ugly as all hell, yet still has horrendous loadtimes and FPS drops (I am on a 4GHz 3770, a GTX680, 16 GIGs of DDR3, and a high speed SSD, yet it still drops to below 10 frames per second at times, seemingly randomly),
The UI is shit (IE every spell has 4 levels, each needs to be put onto your hotbar at a set level).
The progression is shit (no matter how difficult the fight is, you get 23 or 45 exp),


Probably more, but this game is so painful to play through.  I wish my kindly friend hadnt bought the humble bundle for me, as then I would have bought it myself and could have just never played this game, but since someone bought it for me I HAVE to finish it so as to not waste thier money.

My experience thus far is that the game is well worth while, and I would recommend it to any fan of tactical RPGs. This review will cover positive aspects of the game, negative aspects of the game (and why they don't matter much), and advice for potential adventurers.

Positive aspects:

First and foremost, the leveling system is vast. You are confronted with tons of options right at the outset, which provides a good degree of clarity about how to plan your path. It is definitely viable to create hard class archetypes, and is likely also viable to create more versatile heroes. There is a solid mix of cheap levelling options that help do what you want your character to do now, and choices that allow you to transition to new skills later.

Second, the tactical combat is varied enough to prevent approaching all battles in the same way. Differences in enemy types  and compositions, apparent environmental attributes, hidden environmental objects, and varied victory conditions  all help to keep things fresh. Depending on these scenarios, I've had success with tactics involving methodical advancement, bait and run, divide and conquer, run and gun, and defensive walling. I imagine that if you built for it, you could plan to finish some battles with ranged attacks before the enemies even reach you.

In addition, it is worth mentioning a few things other than the core gameplay. The story is well-told and evenly-paced, and is compelling enough to justify the  constant fighting. The music is solid (though repetitive). And the world map is easy to navigate.

Negative aspects:

First, the graphical quality for character models is a little poor when seen up close. Characters don't look quite right facially, and when they talk you can even see that they don't have an inside to their mouths. Character portraits look little like their polygonal counterparts. While this can be offputting, it is not so apparent in battle view, and is not a major detriment.

The only other negative point is the tedious exploration. While map exploration is simple, it is a tedious point-and-click affair. Finding a quest sometimes means visiting each town (many of which look and feel the same) on the off-chance that it will have one, and clicking through each of the people to make sure. Because this is quickly accomplished, it is not a huge drawback, but it is a boring aspect of the game.

My advice:

Some helpful pointers for those who do choose to buy this game (my first piece of advice is that you do) are below:
- Start with a notion of what you want each of your characters to do, and focus solely on that at first (melee vs. ranged vs. magic, choice of weapons, choice of spells). Plan to branch your characters out later.
- It is probably best to make your starting character a magic user, even if you don't plan to focus on spells right away. I don't feel particularly disadvantaged by not having done so, but I can see how an additional magic user could be helpful down the road.
- Don't focus on magic for your starting character, even if you make them a magic user. You will get other characters, and you probably don't need more than one pure mage.
- Magic users aren't great early on, but focusing on healing first is a big help to boosting their early-game usefulness without taking away from long-term viability.
- You will want at least one ranged character, and it will be obvious at a few points in the game who can fill that role.
- Stats and skills that accomplish more per turn/action are more valuable than capacity stats like HP and Astral Points.
- Gold matters a ton in the early parts of the game, and not at all after. Your priority spending should be on the best weapons you can find, followed by set armor.
- It is okay to skip a quest you're not ready for. Some builds can't handle some scenarios, and you may need to level up a little more to take it on. This is a likely but infrequent occurrence. As far as I can tell, quests don't disappear just by waiting.
- Don't be afraid to re-roll and start over. It is tempting to try different things, and you may discover early in the game that your build isn't working like you wanted. Your second try will be much improved.

Thank you for reading, I hope it was helpful, and please let others know whether or not you found this review informative.

1. random battle results
and 
2.  the difficulty of the game. 

However, it turns out that this is one of the top 5 games I played in 2014 (including Last of Us, Distant Worlds, Dominions 3, and Tomb Raiders). If you like turn based combat in a fantasy world, this is a must. I enjoyed this game far much more than I did for UFO Enemy unknown.  

I do not have any experience with the dark eye world so I browsed steam community guides (class guide was most helpful) and some forum posts. Concentration (on certain skills or spells for a character) was advised and it is really important.  I tried to max weapon talent, base stat and skill which are matched (refer community guide). Chapter 1 was a bit difficult since the system was new to me but the remaining chapters became more comfortable as I learn combinations of spells and base stats (for example, one of the  spells that I specialized requires cleverness and constitution). All the information is well presented in game. Carefully building your character not wasting points here and there is crucial. (Dont be afraid if it sounds complicated. If you play 3-4 hours, every thing becomes clearer). 

Certainly, randomness is there but every RPG has that element. So it wasnt a big deal for me.

Это экспериментальная тактическая стратегия. Скорее всего вы, как и остальные поигравшие в Blackguards, поймёте, что она вам не очень-то и понравилась, но отметите, что в игре очень много оригинальных идей и концепций. В общем-то, так оно и есть. 

Каждая арена здесь уникальна и при этом может обладать набором некоторых интерактивных вещей, которые позволяют улучшить или ухудшить своё положение на поле боя. Выпустить тигров из клетки, взорвать болотный газ, уронить штабель ящиков, и так далее. 

Сама игра представляет из себя приключение в магическом мире вселенной The Dark Eye (загуглите, что это, потому что мне лень объяснять. Короче, это ещё одна вселенная типа D&D – сложная ролевая система). Сначала мы собираем отряд, потом постоянно куда-то спешим, берём квесты и оказываем помощь всем нуждающимся. 

Каждая арена при этом ещё и ставит разные условия победы. От примитивного ""убей всех"" до неожиданного ""просто добеги до другого конца"". Разнообразие идёт на пользу игре. Мы будем защищать города, спасать рабов, убивать только одну цель, участвовать в боях с несколькими сторонами, решать примитивные головоломки прямо во время боя. 

Ещё один момент, который обязательно нужно отметить, это проработанная сложность игры. Даже на лёгком уровне будут ситуации, когда придётся немного вздрогнуть. Что уж говорить о сложном уровне, когда каждый бой превращается в максимально болезненное для рассудка мероприятие. 

В пику сложности стоит отметить боевую систему. Как я уже писал в самом начале, игра очень сильно страдает от неправильно прописанного рандома. Каждый раз, когда вы промахиваетесь при шансе 95%, навечно отпечатывется ожогом на вашей заднице. Попасть же при какой-нибудь 5%-ой вероятности невозможно в принципе. Вот такой односторонний рандом. При этом всё это должен был имитировать обычный игральный кубик. И если бы реализовали его, я бы больше поверил в такие промахи. Зачем было вводить вероятности, которые не соответствуют своему названию, я так и не понял. 

На самом деле Daedalic молодцы. Попробовать себя в новом жанре, попытавшись отойти от неисчислимых квестов и адвенчур – это многого стоит. К сожалению, как всегда это и бывает, на каждую отличную идею приходится отвратительная реализация. Daedalic не исключение. Сюжет интересный, но хромает режиссура. У персонажей есть навык ""харизма"", но на практике он не используется. Персонажи введены в сюжет, но проработаны слабо и выдают свои реплики только в триггерных моментах заставок. Есть ситуации морального выбора, но они также примитивны, и их влияние абсолютно скучно: ты или весь в белом, или кусок морального говна. Другого не дано. 

Blackguards – хорошая игра. Во всяком случае её обязательно нужно попробовать. The Dark Eye незаслуженно предана забвению. А ведь она дарит сложные сражения и глубокую ролевую систему. Но, похоже, нужна она только парочке немцев, которые её ещё помнят. К большому моему сожалению.

no more secrets .... ofcourse i recommend it, its the reason why i bought the hubmle bundle

see, when i was like zero there was this machine with padles i later came to know as an atari 2600, and the game was yar's revenge

shortly after, an old man who wanted to be on edge bought a machine he never touched that changed my life, id been a simple gangster otherwise
it had asmyr adventure, wonderboy, duck shoot, spelunker, simons basic, geas and a power cartridge

a little while later when i was like twelve the old mans friend sold me his atari, i was twelve yes, he sold me and i paid for it with my money

now that

that had a demo of a game named civilization

i cherished it for many turns

rented a p.o. box and had the game imported, found out i could just import more and sell them

no one knew the word copyright and no one gave a shit

my first real turnbased strategy game after asmyr adventures

then 

i grew a little older

i found out my dick could be used for more than jerking off

a friend of mine i met somewhere took me home to smoke a fat one

wanna play a game ?
yea sure, i LOVE computer games

warlords ... a personal computer

warlords

turnbased

modern chess

only more options

so because of that i bought one

a pc
pentium 60

it cost about 120% of a wage thats considedred average today

just to play that game

and di loved it

and all the weedies in the hood loved it
and all my friends loved it

and we spent many hours on a few floppies

smoking criminal shit

which we got cheap cos it was close to the source

we are the local version of favela after all

then came 
XCOM

never seen or done before

now

you ask me why i like this game ?

TBS is rare enough but this one is actually GOOD

although

there seems to be a little problem

i bought it cos it said FULL controller support



it doesnt have that

i want my money back and  i want to keep the game cos thats how paper law should work for real

*FLAWS*

1) Inconsistant Mechanics; in short, they're half baked. An early mechanic is terrain tiles (water is slippery, bushes are flammable etc) and in theory these could make for some more complex tactical play, but sometimes thats not the case, water may just be a watery looking tile, or it may cause you to fall on your ass and be prone for a turn. Enemies never use them either, they just move to attack range throw fire, ice and poison.

2) Incorrect RNG; this is a tabletop system adapted for the PC, so of course its simmulating (with a pretty bad generator I might add) die rolls under the hood. You get told a percentage chance to hit (and can level up enough to see other stats) but the percentage shown is WRONG. That's right, the game actively lies to you because its number generation system isn't implemented right. 100% chance is actualy 90%, 65% is actualy 40%. You will also see the same resualt consistantly for mid range %, every time I fire an arrow at a humanoid enemy with a 65% chance to hit I would miss without fail. same goes for 50% with melee, this makes me think the random generator isn't so random after all.

3) Atrocious Voice acting; Dear gods is it terrible, it's not even laughably bad, the actors are often re-used but its like no-one told them they were doing different characters so everyone they voice sounds identicle. They were also clearly recorded completly seperatly without any lead in or practice because they're all delivered with the same dry detatchment of people with a full frontal lobotomy.

4) Poor story telling; The plot may improve as time goes on, but from what I've experienced so far I can already tell you my version ""And so it was that the brave ranger stabbed the annoying sidekicks while they slept and went to live away from the continent full of madmen"". Honestly it started out bad enough with the giant wolf having killed (or having been eating) a random damsel, you kill the wolf and then get arrested for her murder. The wolf was right there, you kill it, its body is lying on the ground next to the corpse, yet they arrest you for her murder. The rest of the story was following a bread crumb story into a veriaty of linier dungeons, speaking of which.

5) Dull Dungeon Design; if you're making a dungeon crawler then you need decent dungeons, so far everything has been a straight line with preset encounters, no element of maze, mystery or surprise. You know you will need to enter each point on the dungeon map, you know that each point is going to have an encounter, and you know that you will want to save scum the hell out of it just to preserve your precious resources.

6) Cheap assets; It's ugly. Very Ugly. There is no sense of unifying aesthetic. Everything is the same blocky 3d models with dodgy shadowing, terrain detailing can actualy conflict with mechanics ""is that shoreline tile a water tile or a land tile? You won't know till you step on it"" the models are barely detailed, only slightly more complex than the 3d models used for CIV V (the ones designed to render quickly at distance and not be looked at too closely). Combine this with a lack luster muZak score and it just doesn't feel good to experience.

7) Poor Performance; for a PC game, its not offering much in the way of performance options. You can set nebulous graphics quality but get no fine choice, you can pick a resolution but theres no windowed mode. In game I've seen multiple graphics glitches caused by lighting effects, flickering textures and even the Hex Grid breaking and flashing at the bottom of the screen.

Pros and cons as follows, because how much each point sways you will govern how much you get out of this game. 

On the whole I enjoyed it.

Pros:
- Funny dialogue and interesting characters. Naurim might be the greatest character in Western RPG history
- Deep strategy. There are lots of environment effects, ways to optimise and spells to learn.
- Good voice acting. Genuinely good and a nice array of accents. Apart from the main characters female voice
- Dark, gritty artistic direction. Few games capture being and anti-hero so well, with murky non-binary decision making
- Challenge. Good god the challenge.

Cons
-  It's a bit... broken. Little things that seem to have been left incomplete, or lack polish. This includes a few bugs with quests and achievements. A good example is that the combat controls list auto-save, but if you try to use it, the game says you can't.
- Not explaining things. Sometimes you will see environmental effects or objects, but have no idea what they are or do until they kill you. Sometimes it will drop you in a level with a special win condition, but it won't be clear what it is. This is fine once you work it out, but causes a bit of trial-and-error frustration
- The ending is, well, balls. Quite simply. There are apparently multiple endings, but to me the last chapter and ending felt a bit rushed.",1416256744,1416256744,True,17,1,0.58128279447555542,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm so glad I bought this game even though it had rather mediocre reviews on Steam (don't know rly why). 

Blackguards is a turn-based RPG taking place in Aventuria world (Dark Eye franchise) where the main protagonist is accused of murder and must find a way how to redeem himself.

I have played 80 hours so far and still have not finished the game (which is huge).. but I must admit I rerolled my main character couple of times just to try out new skills/approaches. :)

I love the story. I love the quests. I love the in-game humour - I dare to say the humour is even better than in Borderlands 2. It's not so forced and it's generally cooler. :D

You lead your party of loveable outlaws throughout a dangerous world and you are balancing on a narrow edge of legal and illegal behavior. Don't expect any clichés. These guys are not your normal do-gooders, but you will love them. :D

Chapter 1 and 2 are very linear but that changes in Chapter 3 which is huge and has lots of side quests. The game can be  (sometimes) pretty difficult even on normal difficulty and you WILL have to use your brain (or Google). :D

The game is not likely worth the full price (39.99 EUR) which is a bit overpriced but I would definitely recommend buying it for 15-20 EUR on sale. You will spend hours and hours playing it.

Even though there are only 3 classes in Normal game mode to pick, you can always switch to Expert game mode and create a new game and a hero from scratch.
You will be able to create your champion as a mix of warrior/mage/hunter with emphasis on various skills/abilities and talents of your liking.

If you like turn-based RPG's or strategies with a good story, I highly recommend you buying this game.",1416011598,1427020495,True,2,0,0.520841777324676514,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is interesting because it does away with most of the filler that comes with most every RPG. You do not control your characters in any way outside of combat, you simply shift to a different spot in a city where you can talk to a couple of NPCs and that's it. Outside of towns you travel on the world map by clicking on a selectable point on the map and you are instantly transported to a town, or into combat if you have a quest going on outside of town.

This makes the game more fun at the beginning, because you always get to the important parts of the game instantly, that would be the combat and the story. However as you progress through the game the positive turns into a negative because you never start feeling a connection with any of your characters. The only time you control them is in combat and in combat they are simply damage dealing stats.

So the game becomes tedious as you start clicking through all the dialogue to just pick up the quests and then you do the quests, almost always by going into combat and you soon realise that the primary things you do in the game are combat and clicking through the story, which I might add is very simple and not at all interesting.

The combat at first is satisfying, especially for me since I am a fan of turn based, tile based combat. However you will probably start getting more and more annoyed with it because of its randomness (nearly every action has at least a small chance to fail and it seems to happen more often than it should). And also because of the lack of data while in combat, the battlelog is very nearly completely useless so you have to constantly pay attention to know what is happening, since the camera can jump around a bit if it's a larger map and you can lose track of the enemy actions. And there isn't enough contextual information with the game for when you move your characters. For example I'd like to know if one of my characters will pass through where an enemy can do an attack of opportunity on him, it's true that it isn't too hard to figure out for yourself if that will happen, but honestly you probably won't have the patience to do it after you are controlling 5 characters and have 5+ enemies each taking their own turn. The combat just becomes too slow at that point.

Outside of combat you also manage the equipment of each of your characters, which isn't really that interesting because there isn't much choice of weapons or armour and what little there is it's always a straight upgrade or not, so there isn't much thinking involved. Somewhat more involved is improving the skills of your characters, but even that becomes straightforward after a while, since you get an abundance of points to allocate throughout the game and you soon pick up the more desirable skills.

So to summarise my main points: no filler makes for a fun start, but it also destroys any potential character building, the story is very simple and not at all interesting, the combat is at first fun but it becomes tedious after a while, not much variety in equipment and finally not enough interesting skills which are worth putting points in. Definitely try the game if you are into turn based, tile based RPGs however be warned that the game can become tedious to play and it did so for me.

It commits every sin in the CRPG handbook. 

Ultimately this game is NOT an enjoyable experience. The first mistake the developers make is confusing complexity with challenge. The character system in this game is needlessly complex and completely opaque. The fights are incredibly unbalanced, and while it is possible to scrape your way through using tactics, it all comes down to luck.

The combat system is absurd. My archer has repeatedly missed 100% chance to hit shots. Not parries, mind you, just completely missed. When you miss 5 90% shots in a row, against an opponent that has no special buffs, and meanwhile the enemy are not just hitting you but criting away, leaving you wounded and dying.

Twice now the game has committed the cardinal sin of CRPGs of taking away your progression for the sake of a gimmick. Too bad if you were trying to make an archer, here's a club, go knock things on the head for 2 damage. See, the thing is, unless you picked the fighter class you won't have power attack, which makes melee weapons as good as useless since you'll just be scratching the ticks of the enemies back. 

You can play as skillfully as you want and you will still be screwed over by RNG and the absurd combat mechanics. Here's an example: My archer just missed 5 90% shots in a row on a target. Missed. Not parried. The target was not buffed with dodge enhancing stats. Now, in some games that would be okay, you'd curse your luck but recover and reorganize your strategy. In Xcom you might pull back and try to lure the enemy into an overwatch trap while you heal up your guys. In this game, every shot you miss, every hit you do not land sets you further and further behind and it is completely out of your hand due to the level up system and comparitive enemy strengths.

This is not fun. The game itself is boring enough without having to go back and redo every freaking fight over and over trying to find some way to have just one of your guys survive. 

The loot drops are hilarious. Fifty pairs of hardened leather boots. Not one usable piece of armor. Boots. Boots all day. But don't think you can just buy armor for your party, the gold costs of the items mean that at best you will have one reasonably equipped and maybe leather pants on your other guys. 

And why on earth do the combat percentages change every round? Why when nothing else has changed does my warrior go from 90% to 50% then back to 85% ... if anything, im hitting the enemy it should go up. None of this makes any sense, it makes tactics pointless. Nothing is every explained.

As a result i purchased this in the sale at 1/3 of its retail price for £10.99.  So a turn based dungeon crawler with rpg character development.  Right now the nitty gritty there are some details of gameplay but i shall not spoiler you on plot etc

Shortfalls in my opinion 

1) The Overall story of the game is linear there are very few opertunities to drastically alter the outcome of the game, there are a bunch of side quests which are optional? (but not completing these for the extra loot, gold and items will make your playthrough a nightmare in its own right! as enemies will be VASTLTY superior to your party of characters. I completed all the side quests and optional dungeon choices.  

2) Character Creation is shallow at best  you have a choice of TWO classes! the game does suggest three but its a joke you have the choice between spellcasters and non spell casters! There are no merchants, no stealth options, just pick a close combat weapon or a ranged weapon, or spells if your the former mage class. oh and all chracters can basically become cookie cut clones if you want them to be exactly the same. 

3) At Certain points your party composition will be radically altered i.e random members of your party will be unavailble to you for fights following the storyline (so all that time and effort spent developing a character for a specific niche,  those skills to help your party become less brittle will be for nothing making certain fights hellish to complete. 

4) The world map has a mere dozen locations for you to explore consisitng of the exact same format towns with the same vendors selling almost identical gear! Black guards is not like diablo where you can expect hoards of loot and mindlesss array of weapons, there are so few it makes you wonder if your ever going to have a badass looking character. 

5) Most of my game time was spent on loading screens........ugh i cannot stress how mind numbing this was!
The Aquisition of items and gear is extremely tedious especially at the start of the game those life saving potions are almost unobtainable and forces you to either sacrifce weapon and armour or go to battle injured. Later those same items become useless which makes you wonder why you invested so much in the first place. The interface is clunky and at times often difficult to direct your actions.


6) The variety of enemies was also sparse to say the least the same foes  cropping up again and again made killing them a real chore, I should also mention that there is NO level grinding in this game to improve your characters stats  for that fight you are having trouble with. 

7) THIS IS THE BIGGY The chance to hit modifier is The MOST ANNOYING PART OF THIS GAME!!! YOU WILLL NEVER BE MORE FRUSTRATED, NEVER MISS AS MANY ATTACKS OR FAILED CASTING ATTEMPTS  AS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THIS GAME,  It has rusulted in me personally restarting hundreds of encounters because this game is COMPLETLY GOVERNED BY RANDOM CHANCE! it will try to break you!!!!!!

8) There are multiple battles linked together resluting in sometimes impossible to win situations as you have been thumped so bad due to unlucky attacks you've misseed ten times in a row or the enemy lads a whole slew of critical hits forcing you to use all your recovery items. (but....i hear you say what about your inventory?? yeah invent items can only be equiped outside of combat, also quicksaving is the same! only outside the dungeon! 

Basically the ENTIRE game is fight, FAST TRAVEL to location,  distribute stats, rinse, repeat, load, load, load, load,  get lucky, Save. 

Positives

The Dungeon maps are varied and are pretty to look at,  there are interactive objects to help you, most maps have a stratagy behind them to make things a wee bit easier but a couple of crucial misses will send that plan right out the window. 

There are moments of satisfaction when you drop that enemy who has forced you to load a dozen times and you complete the fight in no time flat. 

The Dialogue can be entertainig at times and you do find your characters personalities are pretty unique. 

Im Struggling to come up with more positive points! in all honesty i personally thought this was going to be a bit like a fantasy version of  x-com enemy unknown  (which is a fantastic game i do highly reocmmend) needless to say i was sorely dissapointed!  only die hard fans will see any replay out of this title. even at £10.99 i felt robbed and yes i did pour 60 hours into it but most of this was due to the snails pace of the combat system.

Blackguards je spomienka na stare casy...

Po technickej stranke ma hra zopar technickych chyb, graficky engine asi tiez nie kazdemu pride po chuti, ale ak vezmeme ako hra vznikala a od koho tak predovsetkym velky respekt a potlesk. Pribeh je bezne klise boja dobra nad zlom v tomto pripade aj medzi bozstvami. Lenze hrdinovia prave niesu vzorom bajnych mytickych hrdinov dobrych mravov. Charaktery su dobre napisane a celkom dobre skombinovane. Trpaslik Naurim ktory svojou postavou a charakterom pripomina Gimliho s LoTR. Ale to len ako priklad. Kazda postava ma svoj pribeh a osobity charakter a je len na vas ako si ktoru oblubite. Co musim ale velmi vyzdvihnut je poctive kraftovanie postav do puntilku ako za starych cias, krvava obtiaznost ako sa patri (kde jeden spatny tah moze rozhodnut celu bitku) Co by som snad viac uvital, tak asi viac rozhovorov a v mestach viac interakcie. Proti 2D faceliftu nic nemam ale je to istym sposobom moc staticke. Zato boje su  dynamicke, akcne a oku lahodiace.

Verdikt: (hodnotim za seba ako nadsenec daneho zanru - 9/10)  Technickejsi pohlad na vec 7/10

+ tahove RPG zo starej skoly, charaktery, obtiaznost, kraftovanie postav, nadherne a akcne boje na mapach, pribeh i ked je klise, ale to k dobremu RPG predsa patri...

- nedotiahnute veci ako neprakticky subojovy system, obcas zle snimanie kamery nad bojiskom, sem-tam pokulhavajuca AI, suboje casto na nahodu, trocha zamrzi vlazny koniec.

dodatok: Stale ale ostava fakt, ze Nemci vedia robit spickove RPG (Viva Gothic) Ak prehltnete zopar tych nedostatkov a ste PCckari zo starej generacie, tak pridete tejto hre samozrejme na chut.

Confusing for the sake of confusing doesn't make a game complex or interesting.  The character stat screen tells you very little of the impact that your leveling decisions make.

The hit percentage system, how to recover health/mana efficiently and the effects of decisions are just a few examples of this.

I understand that a fair amount of people believe that this hidden veil makes the game more complex, and that they consequently are ""more intelligent"" because they ""figured it out"".

If you want to experiment with unique builds, play melee or just want some fun battles and original gameplay, look elsewhere, this really isnt for you.

Not even a couple of hours into the game and I realised that the battle mechanics are absolutely one of the worst i've seen, in over a decade of playing turn based strategy games. It's another perfect example of developers compensating for horrible AI, by overpowering the player.

A few other problems: This isnt tactical, it's nearly impossible to be tactical in this game because the maps are way too simple, if you're looking for XCOM style tactics, this is nowhere close. Most of the obstacles can be shot through and they provide no additional defense(unless of course the enemy is behind them, in which case they will shoot from behind their obstacle and also through yours and still knock you down with an arrow, from the other end of the map), even with 90% hit chance you will constantly miss.

I've never once wanted to give up on a game so fast but I already see no incentive to continue with this game, it's just so boring and unrewarding for the difficulty. I regret buying it, even at the sale price of $15.

Which was a bit of a disappointment.

All right, so there's some good points to this game: The combats are each well-designed (often frustrating, but that's part of the fun), and almost every combat has some interactive environment object you can use to either help or hurt you.  This part of the game works great.  I wish the rest of the game was better so I could take more advantage of it.

Further good news: The game isn't ridiculous easy, even on the easiest difficulty level.  I had to switch down from Normal in order to make any progress past the first chapter.

Now for the bad news.

First, the combat system is incredibly complicated.  The rules for combat are mostly invisible, but reading through them (on the help screen) made my eyes cross.  This coming from a guy who plays tabletop D&D, HERO System, Shadowrun, Traveller, and Legend of the Five Rings.  This might explain why the chance to hit an opponent is vastly different from the chance marked on your screen.  Anything under an 80% chance to hit will miss at least 2/3 of the time.  And there's one enemy in particular that you won't hit more than about 1/20 of the time, despite the fact that your hit % is shown as 60.  Always.  I'm not sure if the hit chance is failing to take into account about half the combat rules, or if (as some others have suggested) the random number generator is just broken.  Either way, this drops my enjoyment of the game by quite a bit.

The other problem is that there's really no actual ""role-playing"" involved in the game.  There's little to nothing you can do to direct the game, except in some of the sidequests.  And most of that involves giving up a sidequest instead of finishing it.  Sure, you have dialogue options, but they don't really *DO* anything.  

Overall, I'd probably rate this something like 3/10.  The combat scenes are great, but the combat itself fails, and everything else is boring as hell.",1414918630,1414918630,False,47,2,0.630890905857086182,2,True,False,False,False,,,

- imho the dark eye rpg system is clumsy and makes for rather boring fights
- the game restricts you to fights on small hex fields without any exploring or experience of a world, to small towns (basically a static screen which allows you to click on merchants and trainers), and static travel screens. 
- the story and the characters are stereotyped, especially strange from a company wellknown for its storytelling.
- the interface is very counterintuitive (fighting, selling etc.)

Die Grundidee, detailreiche Taktikkämpfe über eine rudimentäre Weltkarte zu verzahnen, funktioniert super. Auch die eher simpel gehaltene Story wird mit kurzen Cutscenes und ebenso überschaubaren Dialogen gut erzählt. Blackguards holt aus einfachen Mitteln viel raus - das ist mir wesentlich lieber als das oft unnötig aufgeblähte Storytelling, das man in vielen RPGs findet.

Hauptkritikpunkt ist ausgerechnet das DSA-Regelwerk. Ich mag DSA im Allgemeinen und den gigantischen Regelsumpf im Speziellen, aber in einem solchen PC-Spiel funktionieren diese Regeln nicht ideal. Als Nicht-DSA-Profi wird man das Spiel ein zweites Mal starten wollen, sobald man das System grundlegend verstanden hat. Und selbst dann kann man sich aufgrund der vielen Möglichkeiten gnadenlos verrennen. Ich habe beispielsweise erst kurz vor Schluss gemerkt, dass es einen Zauber gibt, der einem Charakter eine zweite Aktivierung pro Runde erlaubt - hätte ich den mal früher genutzt, das Spiel wäre nur noch halb so schwer gewesen.

Zweiter kleiner Aufreger sind einige seltsame Designschnitzer:
[spoiler]An Niam hat man sich kaum gewöhnt, stirbt sie auch wieder. Man ohrfeigt sich, dass man sie diese vermaledeiten Drogen hat nehmen lassen - nur um dann in Foren oder im zweiten Spieldurchgang festzustellen, dass es daran gar nicht lag und sich der Tod der Dame gar nicht verhindern lässt.
Noch schlimmer ist die Aurelia-Geschichte - die wird lange und hervorragend aufgebaut, dann haut Aurelia am Ende plötzlich völlig unmotiviert ab und tritt wenig später als Gegner auf. Warum das passiert ist und wie man es hätte verhindern können, erfährt man nicht. Da hätte man sich die ganze Vorgeschichte sparen können.

Wie sich solche Seltsamkeiten in einem ansonsten sehr, sehr fertig aussehenden und gut getesteten Spiel in der Release-Version finden können, ist mir schleierhaft.[/spoiler]

Die Negativpunkte sind vor allem deshalb ärgerlich, weil sie nicht zum sonst hervorragenden Spiel passen. Das heißt aber auch, dass Blackguards trotz dieser Ärgernisse viel Spaß macht.

Combat is done with an isometric view on hexes. Each combat area is unique. Melee combat is fairly straight forward.

Regarding difficulty, I felt many previous The Dark Eye games were much more difficult and appreciated the fact that I was able to get through this game with minimal issues.

I wont indulge in the pros, you can read on for that, I'll just briefly explain why I abandoned a game that I mostly enjoyed at the beginning of the final chapter.

First it lacks an element that should be at the very core of a game of this genre: character/team customization.

You get a very limited number of characters which is 4, one of them will be swapped with another at a point in the story leaving you with an underpowered character as well. You don't really have a real choice on how to develop them, there is a few things you can decide but since mages are defined by their magic and one of the fighters comes in already half trained the tactical phisionomy of your team is pretty much decided before you start the game. You can customize your main character a bit more but you'll realize that the only role lacking in your team will be an archer which is also the stronger dps in the game... 

Second and most important: everytime a loading screens appears cross your fingers because there's a good chance the game is gonna crash. This is most definetly something that can be fixed and it's also something that didn't affect every player,  but given how frequent and long the loading screens generally are it really ruined my experience with this game.

Third: devs brag a lot a about the depth of the story, they also use it as an alibi to justify things like killing fresh characters for no reason and the impossibility to farm. But the truth is there is not much of a story at all, the most of the game is a barely engagefull hunt for clues to unveil the mistery of what happened at the beginning, very linear, not interactive at all, if you're into powerfull story-driven stuff this game will strike you as trivial and stupid at some points.

The story is trope-ridden and uncompelling, a flaw which is compounded by the lack of any sense of progression due to enemies quickly becoming ridiculously overpowered (don't even get me started on the Iribar lily).
Combining an AP system with the need to locate a highly specific trainer to attain certain special abilities really damages the game, if you save up your AP hoping to find a trainer for a particular you find the enemies outclassing you due to the lack of uninvested points. When even a single missed hit can cost you the battle (which are frequently overly long) it seems counter-productive to have such low hit chances even when the relevant weapon skill is maxed out and complimentary stats are high.
I'm sure if you are a veteran of The Dark Eye, the choice of character build could be optimised such that the battles are easier; on the other hand the highly repetitive battle sequences, lack of character placement pre-battle, dreadful story, and lacklustre town interface probably wouldn't make the game enjoyable.

Let's go over the problems first.

1. Difficulty. Particularly early on, the difficulty of each encounter can be horribly inconsistent. There's a reason why there is a ""try again"" button during fights - you're going to use it. Quite a lot. A lot of the more difficult fights have some kind of trick to them that might a try or two to figure out, and a lot of the time said fights require an element of luck too. One or two bad rolls or a few fizzled spells and it's time to try again. Anyone familiar with D&D probably knows that it's hard to create a balanced party with only three characters, which is all you start off with in this game: A mage, a fighter, and your main character who you can build as you wish. After a few hours you pick up a ranger too, who happens to be pretty good with traps, but until I acquired her, any map with hidden traps was a real pain to deal with. There was one fight where I had to memorise the location of the traps through multiple attempts before I could succeed. Additionally, sometimes quests force you through multiple fights with no escapes, and no warning beforehand, which can catch you off-guard if unprepared. In summary: Save often, and be prepared to try again.

2. The interface. The combat system is excellent, but the controls are a little clunky. There's some oddity to the character models which can make it hard to target enemies at times, and the camera is rather awkward at times too. It can get quite frustrating, but it's not so bad that I find myself making accidental moves or anything like that.

3. Information. The game can be very unclear about things. If you're not familiar with the RPG system the game is based on, trying to figure out how it all works is awkward, and the game basically only tells you things once. Being able to mouse over raw stats to see how they affect things would be nice. I have a parry rating of 7 on a character, what sort of parry chance does that actually equate to? How are these stats modifying dice rolls? You can get a rough idea of how things work over time, but I'd like to be able to see exactly what's going on. Contrast with, say, the original neverwinter nights, where if you wanted you could see every single roll being made.

So those are the negatives.

And the positives? Well, the combat system is fantastic, the RPG system, while incredibly deep and unclear, is also very flexible, you have a lot of freedom to let your characters grow in any way you want them to. The quests are enjoyable, the story is simple but engaging, the characters have some actual personality to them.

If you're willing to get over the initial hurdles of an incredibly complex system and some very frustrating battles, there is a deep and enjoyable game with a wealth of content available for you. The world itself is pretty unique, it does a good job of avoiding a lot of fantasy tropes and creating something a little more engaging, and there's something rather refreshing about having a party that aren't a bunch of do-gooders.

You're blackguards. My party consists of a wrongfully imprisoned warrior, a dwarf arsonist obsessed with dragons, a pompous upper-class noble from the south, and an elf who got high on drugs and owes everyone money. You're not evil, but you're certainly not good either. You're labelled scum by the people around you and hunted across a kingdom, adding to your list of crimes on the way.

От шедеврального XCOM Enemy unknown/within ее отличает строгая линейность сюжета. В данном случае – это скорее плюс, чем минус, т.к. сюжет достаточно разнообразный и динамичный. Вы успеете побывать беглым преступником, рабом, гладиатором, никому неизвестным бродягой, который со своей гоп-компанией вершит справедливость на свой манер, ну, или неизвестным героем в сияющих доспехах. :) Много квестов, оружия, сетов, зелий/ядов, ловушек и всякой лабуды. Так что развлекаться можно много и каждый раз по-разному. Система прокачки тоже очень радует (мое первое знакомство с The Dark Eye). Поначалу, она может показаться слишком объемной и будет лень во все это вникать, но это только на первый взгляд. К концу первой главы уже четко понимаешь, что к чему. 

Не обошлось, конечно, без шероховатостей. Кое-где не хватает перевода, не открываются несколько ачивок, один из квестов дается чуть раньше, чем положено по смыслу. 

Но, на мой взгляд, это мелочи в сравнении с тем удовольствием, которое получаешь от игры. Меня настолько зацепило, что прошел два раза подряд. Первый раз – на нормальном уровне сложности, второй –на легком (дают на 20% больше опыта).

So far I have to admit I am really enjoying it. The story, characters and global setting don't appeal that much too me, although everything is more than correct. The story isn't that special, but forms the perfect background for the many fights I encountered so far.

I like the fact that you have to think about the placement of every character aswell as which attack to use. The fact that it's turn-based also allows you to really plan your next move. Some fights were challenging, but I never got the feeling that it isn't fair so far.

Ecco perche' quando ho visto questo Blackguards l'ho subito messo nella mia wishlist steam; E quando poi ho letto che il protagonista e i suoi compari sono delle canaglie di primordine l'hype e' montato subito alle stelle.
Ma come troppo spesso accade, ad un hype eccessivo segue una cocente delusione e Blackguard purtropo e' appunto uno dei tanti casi in cui le molte aspettative che abbiamo su di un titolo si rivelano prontamente deluse.
Il gioco utilizza il sistema ruolistico The Dark Eye, che prima dell'avvento dei vari Drakensang era conosciuto in pratica solo in Germania: Non sono un esperto di questo sistema (conosco molto meglio AD&D avendoci giocato e videogiocato per anni) per cui mi limito a dire l'implementazione di Daedalic sembra essere parecchio confusa e difficile da comprendere (sebbene abbia riscontrato la stessa confusione e difficolta' anche nei Drakensang).
Ma la componente ruolistica del gioco si limita in pratica alle sole statistiche del personaggio: Infatti, tutto il gioco e' una interminabile sequela di combattimenti a turni. Ci saranno si quest principali e secondarie ma il 99.999% di queste si risolveranno in uno scontro (le eccezioni sono veramente poche).
L'esplorazione e' praticamente assente, a meno che non consideriate ""esplorazione"" l'andare a combattere in aree nascoste che troverete strada facendo.

Viene da se che il cuore di questo gioco sono appunto gli scontri: Ambientati in arene ad esagoni sempre diverse (e qui devo fare i complimenti a Daedalic) vi terranno compagnia per la maggior parte del tempo che passerete a giocare a questo titolo.
Anche qui pero' sono gioie e dolori: In effetti devo dire che sono stato messo in difficolta' piu' dai problemi ""ambientali"" (le maledette trappole o i corridoi stretti all'interno dei quali e' facile finire bloccati dai nemici) o ""situazionali"" (in una delle primissime missioni e' necessario raggiungere una certa locazione in un certo numero di turni) che non dalla IA dei nemici, cosa questa che mi ha fatto decisamente storcere il naso: In un gioco massicciamente orientato al combattimento come questo mi sarei ragionevolmente aspettato una IA avversaria con il coltello fra i denti.
Idem l'IA alleta: Sebbene siate voi a dover comandare i compagni e' necessario usare opportue cautele o questi finiranno per passare immancabilmente sulle stesse trappole sulle quali siete gia' passati voi (sig!).
L'IA scadente, lacuna gia' di per se grave, non e' putroppo l'unico difetto di questo gioco: Ci sono infatti delle scelte di design e gameplay che mi rimangono incomprensibili (WARNING: semi spoiler piu' avanti!)

Non capisco infatti come sia accettabile che di 3 possibili classi per il personaggio principale: Guerriero, Ranger, Mago, quest'ultima sia resa completamente inutile dal fatto che ne avrete ben presto altri 2 nel party.
O come sia stato possibile decidere che l'unico personaggio ranged-combat oriented venga inevitabilmente ucciso nel terzo capitolo del gioco.
Insomma, sembra quasi che nessuno si sia preso la briga di pensare che il party  del player deve essere composto in maniera equilibrata e non alla ""scegli una classe e poi sono cavoli tuoi""...
Infine, sarei grato se qualcuno mi spiegasse perche' l'equpaggiamento base costa una fortuna in rapporto al quantitativo di denaro che si raccoglie per missione (mi ci sono volute diverse quest per poter acquistare una armatura scarsa ad inizio gioco).

In conclusione, sto' Blackguards e' una enorme delusione: Peccato perche' con un migliore bilanciamento, una IA decente e qualche scelta piu' coraggiosa di gameplay sarebbe potuto essere un buon gioco anche senza stravolgerne l'essenza.

Dimenticavo: Avevo anche acquistato il DLC ""Untold Legends"", che in teoria avrei dovuto giocare nel corso della campagan principale del gioco. Se l'ho fatto non me ne sono accorto (e davvero non ho la voglia di indagare in merito).",1412034218,1448360728,False,45,2,0.767921149730682373,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Only 6 hours in doesn't make me an expert by any means, but 6 hours of frustration and boredom is enough for me.  

The towm screens are all static,  with certain activities highlighted.  You can shop which doesn't take long as everything costs allot of coins and what the player gets on drops is insignificant.  Weapons drop and they are all inappropriate for the ""basic"" games preset skills.  For example, your warrior is proficient in single handed axes and the only bladed weapons that drop, initially, are swords.  So, in order to even hope to survive any of the battles you have to pump AP ( which are earned by combat and quests) into a weapon that you have found, rather than saving them for other talents.  Armor is virtually non existant as drops so you have no defense really.

There is virtually no game here other than scrounging for gear and combat.  Your path is pretty much preset with no real exploration and each location is either a static town or a combat grid.  

The other really stupid mechanic is your starting companions.   You get a dwarf warrior that is pretty good and a mage that is as useful as a box of combs for a bald man.  Now if you choose a mage as your class, the party has great ranged dps ability and very weak melee.  If you chosse a warrior its the reverse and you are in even worse shape as the preset companion mage is useless.  When looking at the mages's stats, you wil see he has the best ""ranged weapon"" skills of the three.  He also has the most Astral Points ( mana ) of the three.  Yet when equipped with a ranged weapon like a bow he misses every time.  His casting skills are not bad but the only really good spell is an AoE fire attack that does little or no damage and uses up all his mana in 3 turns.  Oh, your mana regens at the alarming rate of 1 to 2 points every 5 turns.  You are long dead by then as a mage can't wear armor, has little or no melee skills and now cant use magic.

Casting is a thrill, the effects are nice especially the failures which occur more than 50% of the time and the melee companion will miss 80% of the time on the only attack that does decent damage and the attack that has a high chance of hitting does insigificant damage.

Now I know that any starting party is releatively weak and there is an expected number of failures in any combat until the combat system is learned.  However, the punishment vs reward system in this game crucifies a new party.  

The typical battle has the odds at 3 or 4 enemies to 1, so you have 3 party members that miss and fizzle spells most of the time with no armor and medocre weapons against 6 or more enemies that miss maybe 1 in 10 times.  Your mana is used up pretty quick and the regen might let you cast one 10 pt heal just before the 3 enemies around you hit for 10 pts of damage each.

There was one battle in a cave of sorts, the 30 odd enemies were seperated from the party by twisting tunnels, but you can see them, so you know what is up a ahead.  After killing the 1st batch of enemies, about 10, I got to sit there mindlessly pressing the space bar until our mana regenerated enough to heal.  Yes heal pots, well they are  very dear, almost never drop and best saved for combat.   After healing the party I sat there pressing space bar for another 40 turns to regen enough mana to move forward and take on the next batch of enemies.  Needless to say that aside from the very deep skill system this game is visually boring and the combat is more so.  

Quite a few words come to mind for this game:  Dark, Dismal, Uninspirering, Frustrating, Boring.  It seems that the publisher is punishing the player for being stupid enough to actually give them money for the priviledge of being bored!

Blackguards is the sort of game that if you had a choice of getting a root canal or playing the game, you'd rush to your dentist with a smile on your face rather than load this game up!

+ Интересные бои. Зачастую цели ""убей их всех"" не стоит, вместо этого нужно сделать что-нибудь остроумное, отбиваясь при этом от наседающего противника.
+ Приятная музыка, особенно отдельные треки.
+ Любовно прорисованные города и селения.

- Очень посредственная графика в катсценах.
- Местами баги. Например, знаменитый квест про плотника, когда при определенных условиях концовку квеста вы получаете до того, как получите начало. Впрочем, ни одного критического бага я не встретил.
- Трудности с Line of Sight. Часто очень сложно понять, из какого положения лучник или маг поразит нужную цель.

La IA la verdad es que logra, además, complicar muchos de los combates, haciendo un uso relativamente acertado de sus poderes y habilidades. A esta variedad en el diseño de las batallas se les une un desarrollo de personajes bastante complejo y personalizable, donde es fácil escoger entre las diversas posibilidades sin estar atado a clases de ningún tipo, y donde la combinación de habilidades de combate y magia se vuelve imprescindible. Todo ello se maneja desde un mapa de la región donde tenemos libertad para ir visitando las distintas zonas de combate, las ciudades donde aprender nuevas habilidades y comprar equipo, así como los distintos lugares de conversaciones. Las conversaciones no tienen demasiada profundidad, es cierto, y la parte de roleo y la trama flojean un tanto, pero se perdona ante una jugabilidad tan sólida como la que tiene Blackguards.

A nivel gráfico Blackguards se nota que no es un AAA, pero el diseño es colorido y que todos los escenarios y localizaciones sean únicos les da un gran encanto que anima a explorar las diversas localizaciones. Los personajes son probablemente lo más flojo, especialmente cuando se hacen zooms durante las cinemáticas o así y se nota que su carga poligonal y detalle son un poco bajos, algo que pasa relativamente desapercibido el resto del tiempo al estar la cámara cenital relativamente alejada.

Pros: The adventure system is a welcome relief from wandering around huge towns of useless NPCs. It's similar to point-and-click adventures of old. Let's you get to the story and/or combat quickly.

Cool level-up system. Characters really start to feel powerful at later levels.

Attractive graphics and runs smoothly.

Neat battle set-ups. Battles have traps, special objectives, secrets, and ambushes. There are a good number of straight up fights, but the set piece battles really spice things up.

Interesting (but not completely original) story with an compelling (but really not original) cast. It keeps you interested enough to follow along rather than just clicking through the dialogs, and the cut-scenes are simple but well done.

Cons: I strongly recommend starting on ""Easy"" difficultly. This really feels like it should be the default and is best for first-time players. The mechanics of the game are a little obscure, and having one play-through under your belt is best. Easy offers a good challenge without being frustrating, and gives you freedom to explore the game.

Again, obscure mechanics and no way to respec makes the game progression rather unforgiving.

Sparse loot. Don't get me wrong, I think it is a nice chance of pace to have magic items actually be rare and not drop 11 times each battle, but it feels like the game is really stingy with the rewards. It does make the few items you get feel more special but, unfortunately, they're not even that much better than the standard ones you can buy.

The characters you get aren't very customizable in their roles. But they do what they do well. 

Low replayability. You could replay the game on a harder difficulty, but why? It's a long game and nothing is really randomized. It's not really much of a con though since the game is so long with lots of optional quests.",1411193053,1411193053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

戦闘はターンベースで、盤はヘクス・グリッドです。King's Bountyシリーズにも相通ずるものがありますが、もっとテーブルトーク由来を思わせるギミックが仕込まれており、攻略し甲斐があります。例えば、河川で脚を滑らせたり。これはキャラクターの「ボディコントロール」という値で成否判定されています。

礎となるルールはダンジョンズ・アンド・ドラゴンズではなくて、兄妹のように似ているダーク・アイです。歴史あるテーブルトークRPGのルールだそうですが、アメリカではＤ＆Ｄの影に隠れてさほど脚光を浴びていなかったようです。パクリ……おっと、“似ている”（※）とはいえ、部分的にはＤ＆Ｄよりも複雑で凝っており、むしろコンピューターRPG向けですね。※そもそもドイツで独語版のＤ＆Ｄを出版できなくなってしまった翻訳者らが独自に考案したTRPGとのことです。

Ｄ＆Ｄ3.5版の盤上戦闘よりも融通が利かないところを感じます（通常アクション後の移動が不可）。そうであっても、骨のあるターンベース戦闘をソロでプレイしてみたいなぁ、という方にはピッタリなゲームでしょう。かくいう私もハマりました。

[h1]興味深かったところ：[/h1]

・１周目よりも選択肢を意識して、２周目となる新規ゲームまでしてみたのですが、結局、“Friends for Eternity”という実績が取れませんでした。[spoiler]オウレリア[/spoiler]は主人公を親友認定してくれない、なかなかのビッチですね！　これなら、もう一方のフラグ立ての方がラクなのかもしれません。

・（上記に関連して）エンディングムービーが味気ないです。

・命中確率95％にもかかわらず３連続空振り（敵側マスター回避）がザラに起きました。20面体の乱数実装がちょいと怪しい感じもします。[url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/042/G004287/20140905040/]ナムコ作品で見る乱数の歴史[/url]の例で分かるように、コンピューター上の乱数は疑似乱数がよく使用されます……というのは冗談として、ギャル麻雀でギャル側に有利に配牌されているかのような、出目の偏りを感じざるを得ない場面を幾度も体験させてくれました。結局のところ、20面体ダイスなので、運による成否が大きいのです！

・育成の仕方が分かってしまえば、（難易度ノーマルでしかプレイしていませんが）さほど苦労しない戦闘が多くなりました。ただし、もらえる属性値ポイントが限られている序盤や、まださほど強く育成できない局面での強敵（[spoiler]ユリ、森の人のジャベリン、傭兵のクロスボウ、カラスの頭[/spoiler]）には、かなり苦しみました。

・休息無しの連続マップを、如何に損耗を抑えてクリア出来るかも、面白さのひとつでした。

・ターンベースですが、キャラクターの手番が固定ではなく毎回変化するため、なかなか思ったような連携アクションが取れません。詰将棋を思わせるような、雑魚が無限湧きする舞台もあり、味方全員を生きたまま指定地点へ帰還させるのはなかなか難しいことがありました（クリアするには一人でも残っていればＯＫです）。ポイントは敵ＡＩの動きを誘うことで、さもないと通せんぼされて二進も三進もいかなくなります。[spoiler]女男爵、毒霧のトンネル、オナーホールの杖、闘技場での巨大ノミ[/spoiler]、など。挑戦し甲斐のある手強さでした。

・町やメングビラ内を行き来する際のロードが遅めです。新しいクエストを求めて頻繁に訪れましたので、これはちょっと困りましたね。

・[spoiler]シリエゴ[/spoiler]が捕まる以前に、[spoiler]拷問人[/spoiler]が[spoiler]シリエゴ[/spoiler]の[spoiler]えん罪[/spoiler]を話題に出してきます。この箇所に関しては、クエストの後先のフラグが確認されていないように見受けられます。他の箇所では、先のクエストが消化されてから件の話題が出るといった処理がされていました。

・射線を妨げないオブジェクト（幌馬車、石塀、など）が存在しており、敵側はお構いなしに射撃してきます。にもかかわらず、味方からは射線を妨げるとして、該当オブジェクト越しの敵を標的に出来ない場面が見受けられました。

・範囲魔法を発動する際、固まった敵の中点を指定できないことがよくあります。ある１人を中心に周囲６人が固まっている場合、中央の一人を目標として指定できません。どうやら、手前の敵のせいで奥へ視線が通らない判定らしいのですが……。この場合、範囲魔法が７ヘクス指定である意義を疑問に思ってしまいます。

・倒れたばかりの味方を、治療呪文やポーションの対象にできないことがありました。[spoiler]絵[/spoiler]の中で、[spoiler]女王クモ[/spoiler]を箱の下敷きに出来なかったり……。状況に応じて正常に動作できてない処理があるように思います。

・フリーズが起きます。メモリリークでしょうか。

・公式の日本語化（steamでのBlackguardsのプロパティで日本語を選択。Blackguards起動後にオプションで言語をNihongoにする）を行うと、ロード画面のTipsの内容が表示されなくなります。また、クエスチョンマークや記号が抜けた状態で表示されます。文中の数字の箇所で、不自然な改行が挿入されます。

To elaborate, the game draws you in with the idea of a turn-based RPG with an unkown and intersting story and encourages the idea of character customization, dialogue options, and all that awesome stuff.

Its lies, simply said and done its all lies.

1. You will be stuck with a pre-determined 'party', with pre-determined skillsets, there is no 'designing a party'.

2. The story is predictable, you loose your memory and gotta figure out what you forgot...

3. The 'dialogue/charisma' options  while changing minor things are so few and far between there is almost no reason to do anything but SMASH and kill everything.

4. Mages can't learn new skills until you purchase books for them (which are extremely expensive, so you won't learn any new magics till mid-late game.) While I am on the topic of mages there is a checkbox at the start of the game which effective says 'magic abillity' if you select that, you get mana and can be a mage- otherwise you'll never have that option.

5. The skill tree is the same for everyone, so your sword wielding guy will go into swords and use the same 1-3 skills the entire game. (but will have extra points so he can get the same skills as your... archer!)

If you haven't decided to quickly run away from this game yet, there are more 'great' things about this game I can only hope you never find out. The ending is as bad as you think its going to be about half way through (and its almost 100% predictible from the start...).

If you haven't fled by now, you either love torture or your so dense this game might be for you (join the other <7% that have played through more than half of this game...).

I was expecting it to be primarily centered around hex-grid combat. I knew this and dived in - I love games like HoMM and Kings Bounty. Other reviews have mentioned that the game is essentially battle to battle, with a few static village screens thrown in to try and create a background. Even so, I was expecting so much more. Everything in the game seems to have been implemented with the minimum amount of thought. There are relatively few upgradable skills and I found it fairly easy to just divide skill groups between party members and max them out fairly early in the game. Other reviewers have mentioned difficulty spikes in certain battles and this is occassionally true - some of the early battles are harder than the 'legendary' arena battles you have to overcome later on.

Actually, one of the main sticking points for me was the distinct lack of equipment - or at least variety of equipment. If the game is going to be based entirely around battles, surely you should feel like winning is going to bring some great bounty, but in the end all you get is a pair of boots and 5 coins, or whatever. There aren't even any item conditions to mix things up (rusty swards, superior buckler, etc). The amount of XP you get after a battle seems to bear very little resemblence to its difficulty either. All of this leaves the game without any reason for you to be excited or want to carry on into the next battle (apart from the inherent addictiveness of turn-based RPG combat). You feel like maybe you should be progressing the story, but I also found the story boring for the most part, apart from a few of the cut-scene events. I recently bought the Baldurs Gate 2:EE and played for a few hours, the contrast in characterisation is ludicrous - straight away I was enjoying the quips and comments from party members - while the characters in Blackguards just aren't really memorable, I found myself interested at the beginning, but raply lost interest, either through poor writing or due to the incredibly slow pace of storytelling.

Overall, I felt there weren't really any redeeming features for Blackguards - sure its graphically competent (although by no means pretty), sure the combat and strategy is acceptable (but by no means exciting or ground breaking in any way), sure the character concepts are interesting, but they just don't go anywhere.

E' un buon rpg, ha una bella trama e risulta estremamente bilanciato nella difficoltà.
E' un po' come giocare ad una versione moderna e molto più rpg di un vecchio Fantasy General o un più recente Fantasy War.
In partica è un susseguirsi di battaglie su schema a griglia che risultano molto ben caratterizzate.
Ad un livello successivo, sempre su mappa statica, troviamo la mappa del dungeon in cui ci troviamo dove possiamo spostarci di stanza in stanza (mappe di battaglia esagonali). Ad un livello ancora superiore troviamo la mappa statica del mondo in cui possiamo spostarci ""liberamente"" tra le varie location che riconducono inevitabilmente a città (ruolo e componente rpg), dungeon o direttamente a terreni di battaglia. 

Ho letto in giro che è difficile, devo dire che se non si distribuiscono con cura i pavv e le abilità potrebbe risultare molto più ostico di quello che è.

I tired with 4 different setup and every time(sometimes sooner then others) ran into a just stupidly setup battle where I would have selected a much different skill set then I had.

You can miss like 10-15 times on a row, even with maxed skills and thus lose fights on it, and other times you might hit and crit on bosses constantly and wipe them extremly fast... A quick examples are bosses that has 40% dodge on any attacks you do. Now imagien that they also poison you, and spawning mobs that are basically impossible to kill. Now, you can lose this fight, like I did 10+ times because you keep missing everytime. And yes, then another time, you might hit basically every swing and boss is down before you know it. Thats not balanced, its just random and in a SRPG based on tactics luck should never play a big part into it. I can understand some luck mechanics for the rpg-elements, but 40% miss on a boss that hit hard back? and he is a tank? Come on...

I would give this game maybe a 7.5 or 8.0 of 10. When this game is at its best its actually really good, but when its at its worst its horrible. Probably need better beta test for the sequal in terms of balancing out battles, be more open about what to level up in, lots of trial and errors if you dont know what your supposed to level up or not. Also, the story and sidequest need to be better... basically as it is now, side-quest are kind of neccessary to finish for that vital AP which you level up in. So its not even a choice to do them or not.

I finished the game in 40 hours on normal difficulty, so this is a pretty lenghty game I guess 35 to 45+ hours.
Would I buy the sequal? Probably, yes, especially when its on some kind of a cheap discount, because I love srpg's and wanna support them (Final Fantasy Tactics need a sequal...) - but if the sequal for Blackguards, which is in development at this moment, get good reviews from the critics, I would probably buy it at launch.

Vorweg, ich habe die Nordlandtrilogie durch gespielt und hab etwas ähnliches erwartet, wusste allerdings, dass sich bei DSA inzwischen das Regelwerk stark geändert hat.

Die Charaktererstellung hat echt Spaß gemacht, die ist ja egtl. bei jedem Rollenspiel eines der Highlights.
Man kauft sich mit Abenteuerpunkten seine Fähigkeiten zusammen was ich für eine große Verbesserung gegenüber dem alten Zufallsbasierten System halte. Allerdings kann man keine Rasse wählen, das stößt dann schon etwas übel auf.

Dann wird man auch schon sehr schnell in`s Geschehen geworfen. Das Spiel ist eine riesige Aneinanderreihung von rundenbasierten Kämpfen auf unterschiedlichen Schlachtfeldern. Außerhalb von Gefechten kann man lediglich von Punkt zu Punkt laufen.
Und auch wenn das Kampfsystem nicht schlecht ist, so wirkt es recht unausgereift. Ich weiss nicht, ob das Pen&Paperspiel mit DSA v.4 die Aktionspunkte von früher vollkommen entfernt hat, aber es wirkt, gerade wenn man die alten Spiele kennt, wie eine sehr abgestumpfte Version der früheren Teile mit weit weniger Tiefe.
Und leider ist auch das Interface nicht besonders gelungen. Reihenfolge, KK und AE sind alles zusammen am linken unteren Bildschirm aufgeführt. Die rechte untere Ecke bleibt vollkommen ungenutzt und eine genauere Übersicht über den Charakter, der gerade dran ist wäre wirklich angebracht. 
Das Ringmenü ist das verwirrendste am Kampfinterface. Das Spiel ist nie für die Konsolen erschienen und dennoch muss man sich mit dieser Ausgeburt der Hölle herumschlagen. Was Daedalic zu so einer Entscheidung getrieben hat, ist mir schleierhaft.

Es kann jedenfalls nicht sein, dass sie die wunderschöne Grafik zu wenig wie möglich verdecken wollten. Denn die Figuren wirken tot und teils hässlich. Die Charaktere sind garnicht wieder zu erkennen wenn man die wunderschönen Zeichnungen betrachtet und dann wieder die hässlichen 3D-Modelle dazu sieht. Leider sind auch in den Dialogen zwischen den Kämpfen immer nur die toten Modells zu sehen, die sich über Textboxen am unteren Bildschirmrand unterhalten.
Hier sei angemerkt, dass das gesammte Spiel vertont ist, und die meiste Zeit auch ausgezeichnet, allerdings immerwieder von einigen Sprechern unterbrochen, die die Stimmung töten.

Leider hat Daedalic hier viel potential verschenkt und Blackguards kann mit der Qualität ihrer Point&Click-Adventures nicht im geringsten mit halten.

Войдя в город вы удивитесь как там всё интересно сделано. Нету ни единого одинакового города, а в этой игре их огромное количество, уж поверьте. Очень нравится сюжетная линия, самое то что она есть уже радует. Почему я так думаю? Просто есть множество тактических игр в которых сюжет однолинейный, а тут каждый в каждый час игры может всё категорично поменяться и если ты следовал основной цели, то через момент может оказаться, что это было напрасно и главные герои должны были поступить совсем по иному!

А играл сквозь сильную жопную боль (и это на нормальном-то уровне), попал на очередной сюжетный потуг сценариста и окончательно огорчился, удалив игру. Я очень люблю РПГ, сеттинг и правила ДнД и пошаговые игры. Но это просто извращение и омерзение игр с кубиками. Это типа DnD, Фолаута и X COM. Но выглядит несерьезно, как Fable. Равно как и прокачка персонажа там. Об этом далее.

Есть два класса. Боец с магией, боец без магии. Левелапов нет, набираются хп, единые и для абилок и для характеристик и для навыков, и для талантов (из которых нужны только штуки 3, остальные - просто дерьмо). Все просто. Немного, конечно, можно как-то роли распределить в пати, но выходит просто вата (к тому же будет часть игры, где придется разделять пати, и летело Ваше разделение по ролям в трубу и, соответственно, дальнейшее прохождение невозможно).

Начнем с отвратительной системы прокачки персонажа. Тебе дается два режима. Либо автоматический, либо УРОВЕНЬ ЭКСПЕРТА. Естественно я не хочу долбанного персонажа из пресетов игры, а своего, родного. Итак. Скажем, берем мага. У него есть около 30 заклинаний, что-то типа того (МАЛО). На каждый спел и его вероятность каста влияют 3 (3!) каких-то характеристики, коих СЛИШКОМ МНОГО (Ум, Сила, Интуиция, Ловкость, Подвижность, Конституция, Харизма, Храбрость и какая-то еще херня была). То есть магу для каста отдельных спеллов нужна сила(!!!) и ловкость(!!!!!1). И для комфортной игры каждая характеристика должна быть вкачана на 13 минимум, иначе провалы при касте гарантированы. Так же как жалкий костыль в раздел характеристик было вынесено 3 опции - хп, мана и сопротивление магии (то есть повышение конституции и интеллекта недостаточно было). Это не выглядит удобно. Это как кочерга в жопе для любого, кто захочет играть в ролеплей.

Как проходит каст спеллов.
Для каста спелла нужно выбросить 3 кубика на каждую из характеристик. Провал хотя бы по одному - Вы обосрались. Но есть опять же костыль на этот случай, дополнительные очки, помогающие добрасывать при неудачах. Например, я кидаю 1d20, нужно, чтобы выпало меньше 15. Выпадает 20, тратится 5 очков из 8. Но эти долбанные очки кончаются быстрее, чем моё терпение во время боя от постоянных провалов каста. Все проклятия и энчантинг невозможны ввиду сопротивления противника и твоей криворукости, которой просто невозможно избежать, прокачивая персонажа, щелкая по одной из 100 кнопочек,
87% вероятность каста - де-факто, маг провалится 1/3 раза за весь бой.
Кастовать спеллы нормально и избежать убивания с трех раз первым попавшимся голым бандитом с косой невозможно. Либо кто-то танкует, а ты кастуешь, либо ты - манчкины-гомункулусы. Но из-за кучи внезапностей этой игры, ролеплей нереален. Я до сих пор в шоке от мага с 14 силы...

Как проходит бой файтерами.
Обычный бой оружием или луками в принципе ничем от ДнД не отличается, один кубик на успех + сложность противника + его уклонения + парирование, все нормально. Плюс всякие абилити типа нокдауна, мощного удара, который увеличивает порог выброса кубика для успеха, но добавляет очков дамага, всякие уловки, это неплохо. Класс брони впитывает дамаг. Полный сет брони добавляет класс брони. Маг может кастовать +4 класса брони, хаст может кастовать. И еще, если пробегаешь рядом с неударившим еще противником, он тебя ёбнет по загривку. Плюс еще одна тупорылость, которая переходит из игры в игру как эстафета - лучник плохо стреляет в противника, который стоит рядом с тобой. Я думал, чем цель ближе, тем легче попасть. Враг по рукам что ли бьет, не дает целится?

Теперь о высерах сценаристов. Обычная ситуация, когда твою пати после долгого боя, без пальцев на руках и на костылях, без хп и восстановленной маны, снова кидают без реста в бой. Обычная ситуация, когда у противника овер 9000 свистоперделок и преимуществ, а у тебя на руках только полудохлый маг, который только и успевает лечить себя, файтер, который сносит по 6 дамага и в 1/10 случаев 14(ого, это много!) (самый толстый противник имеет 50 хп. Это где-то после 2 этапа игры). Засады - ладно, хуй с ними.

Нет, нет и нет, не рекомендую эту игру. Разработчики хотели что-то своё и новое придумать, а вышло не оч.

Daedalic était déjà un maître dans le domaine de point'n click, et leur premier essai de RPG est un succès. Les combats s'effectuent sur un terrain en damier hexagonal, au tour par tour, avec les règles de l'oeil noir. Assez difficiles à appréhender pour des débutants, elles donnent toutefois une grande satisfaction lorsqu'on arrive à les maîtriser et à faire évoluer son petit groupe.

Certains combats sont tactiques, d'autres TRES tactiques avec des mises en situation spéciales (groupe séparé, compagnon inutilisable, perte d'équipement, temps limité). Rajoutez à cela que le terrain peut être piégé ou obstrué, et que les compétences et sortilèges peuvent être utiles dans une situation et inutiles dans une autre, et vous obtenez un excellent ""tactical"" comme on dit.

Mais attention, ceux qui n'aiment pas le tour par tour et qui favorisent avant tout l'exploration de cartes ou des dialogues riches avec choix/conséquences devront passer leur chemin.

Les RPG tactiques ne sont pas mes favoris, mais force est d'admettre que ce dernier m'a fait renouer avec le genre.

Fan de RPG en tour par tour et en pause tactique, le gameplay m'a vraiment séduit.
Si vous aimez le genre, vous devriez apprécier ce Blackguards.
Héros et ennemis effectuent leurs actions, chacun leurs tours.
Les possibilités d'évolution des personnages sont assez poussées.
De petites innovations viennent rajouter du piment, comme les environnements interactifs.
Il est possible de détruire des obstacles pour se frayer un passage, mettre le feu à des parties inflammables de la carte avec des magies ou armes enflammées, ou encore de provoquer une chute de pierres sur des ennemis mal placés, en détruisant un décor au bon moment et j'en passe...
De même des pièges sont parfois dissimulés sur la cartes, ou les terrains sauvages peu praticables peuvent vous réserver des surprises...
A vous de prendre avantage de tout cela.

Le level design de ce jeu est vraiment de qualité, et sans cesse renouvelé.
Les développeurs ne se sont pas contenté de créer des terrains vagues avec des ennemis dessus.
En plus des décors interactifs, tous les champs de bataille sont vraiment travaillés, et certains sont vraiment originaux.
Conjuguez cela avec des conditions de victoires variées, et vous obtenez des affrontements souvent uniques.

Mais c'est surtout le challenge plutôt relevé qui m'a définitivement conquis !
Il s'agit juste du plus gros point faible des RPG du moment, la difficulté est trop souvent au ras des pâquerettes ou mal calibrée ( difficile en début d'aventure, et trop facile à la fin).
Dans Blackguards, c'est le plus gros point fort.
Ce jeu est difficile du début à la fin !
J'ai savouré chaque combat, ou chaque choix d'action devra être murement réfléchie.
Je conseille au hardcore gamers de mettre le jeu en difficulté maximum dès le début, quant aux autres ils mettront le jeu en facile ou moyen ,et viendront pleurer sur les forums comme certains car ils n'ont pas le niveau...
Ce challenge élevé est à la fois du aux ennemis retords, ainsi qu'au level design ingénieux.
La seule ombre au tableau est le côté parfois trop aléatoire des combats.
La chance peu avoir un impact décisif sur la réussite de certaines actions, dont l’échec peut vous pousser à recommencer le combat tout entier.
D'ailleurs l'option rapide pour recommencer l'affrontement n'est pas là pour rien...
Mais cela devient moins vrai par la suite, car vos personnages deviennent plus efficaces, et les chances de réussites de leurs actions augmentent drastiquement.
D'ailleurs certaines compétences sont vraiment trop efficaces, d'autant plus qu'elles peuvent être spammées à loisir ( triple tir de l'archer fumé....).
J'ai sauvé certaines confrontations rien que grâce à mon archer, mais ce fut sans grande fiereté ni mérite...
Pour en venir à la spécialisation des persos, celle-ci est plutôt complète, et propose beaucoup de sorts différents bien fun.
Mais il faut avouer que la personnalisation est un peu trop complexe, car chaque compétence demande des pré-requis dans certaines stats, et on fini par s'y perdre dans le nombre de compétence à devoir apprendre.
La conséquence, est qu'il est facile de rater son personnage, surtout quand toutes les compétences et sorts ne se valent pas !
Le problème aurait facilement pu être contourné en donnant la possibilité de respect ses personnages, mais non.
Et de grosses erreurs peuvent se traduire par un bloquage dans le jeu, et devoir recommencer de 0...frustrant.

Autre petit problème : l'équipement est vraiment distribué et disponible au compte goutte, et les vrais sets intéressants se font rares.
C'est tout de même dommage car il s'agit d'une carotte bien appréciable dans les RPG.

Le scénario du jeu est malheureusement trop classique et quelconque...et pourtant, la narration a pour moi été l'un des moteurs du jeu, exactement comme ce fut le cas avec Dragon Age Origins.
Ce n'est pas forcement l'histoire qui donne envie d'avancer, mais les personnages charismatiques, et les dialogues savoureux.
J'ai vu ces points critiqués ailleurs, mais je ne suis pas d'accord.
La plupart des protagonistes sont attachants, et l'humour est bien présent.

Les quêtes du jeu peuvent souvent se résoudre de façon différentes.
Le joueur se voit offrir de nombreux choix dans les dialogues, et sur le champs de bataille.
Mais je regrette le fait que les affrontements directs sont TOUJOURS mieux récompensés que les solutions pacifiques.
Seuls les combats vous donneront de l'expérience, et autant d'argent.
Il m'est donc souvent arrivé de prendre une décision contraire à mes valeurs, en privilégiant la brutalité.

La durée de vie du titre est excellente.
Mais pas tant grâce à la quête principale qui n'est finalement pas si longue.
C'est plutôt l'abondance de quêtes annexes, toutes très intéressantes, qui vous prendra du temps.

Attention par contre, le jeu ne propose aucune exploration à pieds ou autre dans divers environnements.
On se déplace sur une map pour choisir les lieux à visiter (ville, grotte etc.)
A l'intérieur du dit lieu choisi, le joueur observe un plan fixe à la 1ere personne, et clique sur les protagonistes pour converser, ou choisi un itinéraire, ce qui l'aménerera sur un nouveau plan fixe (etc.), avec des combats qui se déclencheront en fonction des évenements (dialogues et déplacements).
Pour moi ce n'est pas un gros défaut car la priorité des develloppeurs était de se concentrer sur le gameplay des combats.
Mais fuyez ce jeu si vous êtes du genre à privilégier l'exploration.

Globalement ce Blackguards est tout simplement l'un des meilleurs RPG auquel j'ai pu jouer ces dernières années, et je suis assez surpris de constater certains retours mitigés.
Pour avoir joué à certains Point and Clic des développeurs de chez Deadlic, je peux dire qu'ils sont bien plus doués en RPG.
J'attends Blackguards 2 avec enthousiasme.

The combat is nicely done and obviously the strong point of the game - it works, and keeps you challenged (at least, up to now).
The graphics are nice, but a little too cartoon-ish for my taste (and for the atmosphere the game tries to create).
The story is good enough to carry you from chapter to chapter, although it's a little obvious in its twists.

There are obviously a few cons as well:
- The biggest minus for me it's the inventory, and the way it works. You don't get a clear comparison between your equipped item and another one, in your pack or at a vendor - this alone makes choosing weapons a nuisance at later stages. The inventory also becomes cluttered extremely easy. 
- Also a minus is the auto saving system. The game makes it that, quite a few times, you have to fight battle after battle, without possibility of resting&healing. And the autosave saves as you enter a new battle. This means that, if you don't take extra care, you'll end up (it happened to me once) in a position i hate most in RPGs - making some bad decisions in a 3rd-in-a-row battle, i had no chance of winning the 4th. And the autosave was only for the 4th. So i had to restart not only the 3 battles before, but the whole branch of the chapter (a lot of dialogue and cinematics included) - and i hate remaking choices i already made, listening to the same lines over and over again etc. They should have made an auto save for each battle, and an autosave for entering a chain of events/battles - this way, you can restart the fights without restarting the story itself.

Anyway, all in all, is a nice game (and i bought it during a sale) - so i give it 7.5/10.",1407916724,1407916724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The campaign is reasonably long, though the game doesn't feel repetitive thanks to reasonably varied fight scenarios and win-conditions. Early problems with bugged quests and translation issues from the original German seem mostly resolved at this point (I only noticed some spelling errors in the English version and had no problems with bugged quests.)

Common complaints about the game focus on numerous loading screens and an unintuitive UI. I found the UI fairly easy to pick up myself, only issuing incorrect commands once or twice. Though there are a lot of loading screens between scenarios, each one lasted only 1-3 seconds for me so they didn't detract from my experience. People playing on systems using HDDs rather than SSDs may find the loading screens take longer and so are more annoying, though.

It's not broken.

Cons

The combat is not only nothing new, it's also incredibly boring. There's just a lack of depth here that can't hold up to even very old series like HoMM. On the surface it looks like there could be a lot of depth, but that's just because of the huge radial window of spells and abilities that will never be used. So it falls short as a strategy game.

The writing is mediocre, not bad, but it's by no means compelling, original, or gripping. So it falls short of standards set by many previous RPGs.

Blackguards is a good game that demonstrates the ability of its developers to create games that are not classic point-and-click adventures.

A nice first step for Daedalic Games outside of their roots.

Alla somma di pro e contro, Blackguards è un buon titolo, che segna l’apertura di una nuova frontiera per i suoi sviluppatori. L’esperimento ha denotato carenze al quale Daedalic dovrà saper rimediare in futuro, in particolar modo variegando maggiormente il gameplay, ma si è trattato comunque di un buon primo passo, che consigliamo a chi vive di pane e strategia.

It is ultimately focused more on preparation than on actual strategy in combat. Generally speaking basic resource management and a bit of luck when it comes to the (sometimes infuriating) RNG will win fights.
I found the poison & trapping elements of Blackguards to be more to it's detriment than benefit, with poisons and traps being prohibitively expensive both in terms of currency and the use of a turn to apply them and a belt slot to carry them. Most enemies are immune or highly resilient to poison and trap effects, and there are many enemies which will poison you with debuffs for the whole battle if they land a hit. The only spell which works to remove poison is ineffective against the stonger poisons, which by endgame most enemies use. Overall a couple of unlucky dodge/parry rolls and a couple of unlucky attack rolls will result in your whole party being poisoned and the battle becoming much more difficult.
Blackguards has a very deep character development system, with many core stats which affect different battle stats. The game could have benefited from fewer weapon skills and perhaps a poison resistance skill, however overall I found the stat system worthwhile.
The final act is very padded - there is substatially more combat than previous acts and it can get a little dry. Overall I enjoyed my time with Blackguards but was happy to be finished - usually a sign that something that was fun in the beginning got a bit tedious.

The game has no exploration or sense of adventure. None. Zero. Your experience with exploring the world of Blackguards consists of clicking on an icon on the world map representing a settlement and loading up a marketplace view, said view having a few icons to click on that load up the various types of stores or that occasionally (a different icon) offer quests. And that's it.

The various settlements are highly detailed, but all of that detail exists on static backgrounds. The backdrop pictures could have offered a great sense of place simply by utilizing a nice exterior shot. Indeed, this being a fantasy world, and one where many of the settlements offer a rather distinct size and local elements, exterior views could have added a great deal of wonder and adventure to the player's sense of the world. As it is, though, settlements are just a series of the same four stores with minor hints at the diversity that the world has to offer with a few extra flourishes added to some of the marketplaces.

For the most part, one's interaction with the world is on the level of an mmo. There are stores to click on and buy stuff, and there is the occasional quest giver that is met once or twice, says his generic spiel to send you off on your generic quest, and one never sees them again after. Leaving the game with no sense of character.

STORY

The overall concept of Blackguards is generic chosen one gets chosen for unknown reasons to save the world. It's a bland and generic concept, but there's nothing inherently bad about it. One can take a generic concept and sprinkle originality upon it to make an exciting concept. Operative word being can. With Blackguards, the one conceit to originality is that the characters are ""blackguards"".

Except they're not. The main character is, in actuality, falsely accused of a crime he/she didn't commit. And he/she now roams the badlands, an outlaw hunting outlaws...a RENEGADE.

Some of your cohorts have committed crimes. But other than a few - very rare - jokes, this never really comes into play. The only character who is actually a criminal during the game is quickly killed off. The rest of the characters are more in the ""gang of rogues and misfits"" territory. And the things that that band of rogues and misfits are called upon to do during the game are the usual generic RPG quests. Find the lost ""ring"", rescue the damsel in distress, kill these bandits, etc.

With only that unused conceit to count towards originality, there is nothing original in the Blackguards storyline. It is, unfortunately, the usual generic, bland template upon which to hand an RPG. But it actually gets worse than that, because the various enemies and situations are also generic, and the core development is a jumbled mess, leading to no driving reason to progress through the story. (Stressing here that there is no driving reason to progress through the story, not the game.)

There's a core of a good story lying within Blackguards. Evil villains, saving the world, high adventure. But none of it ever gets used. Instead, the overall story sits in the background while the characters get captured - again - and drug around doing random combats against generic foes that have no personal stake in the overall story. The number of times that the party actually fights people who are involved in the threat to the world before reaching the final chapter is incredibly low. Instead, in a world threatened with destruction, it's mostly bandits, gladiators, various animals, and independent undead that the party meets.

The characters of the main party have some personality, even if it is a bit two-dimensional. Their personalities are well-written. But there is little there to most of them, and those personalities do not drive the story. The only driving force in the story is the Chosen One main character. The other members of the party simply offer some localized color here and there. And unfortunately, the best personality is killed off early and replaced by someone as bland as the Chosen One main character. The remaining personalities are well-written, but bland. 

Which brings up one of the major points that are often brought up about games like Blackguards - ""It's not about the story; it's about the combat"". And while it is true that the centerpiece of Blackguards is combat, one also spends a lot of time watching cutscenes following along the story. If the story isn't actually a major part of the game, then it shouldn't occupy a major part of the time of the game. If it does occupy a large portion of gametime, then it is a major part of the game. End of story. 

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

At first, the resource management of Blackguards seems like it will be an exciting and detailed system. But like so much else in the game, none of what is met in that first impression is ever fully realized. There is a lot of meat here. The consumables system is highly detailed, with a lot to offer a game that put pressure on those resources. But there is never any pressure. None of the resources matter.  The most glaring of these is rations. The sole use of rations is to allow the group to camp out on the world map. Yet, since there are no wandering monsters and no risk or real time involved in traveling, there is no reason not to simply click on a settlement and rest at its inn rather than lug around heavy rations units (other than the obscurely long loading times for the settlements). 

The only resource that is regularly bought are arrows, for those rare times when there aren't bundles of them found on the enemy, or when - much more often - all of your equipment has been taken from you. As with so much else in Blackguards, resource management is a highly detailed system that a lot could be done with, but that never comes to fruition. Soon after it's introduction, it becomes left by the wayside.

COMBAT

For all of the famed glory of the Blackguards combat system, there actually isn't much to it. The party is made up of five members, and they usually fight from 6-7 enemies, occasionally more, sometimes less. The battles take place on a hex-grid, and they take place in turns based on individual character speed and an initiative roll. 

Unfortunately, the enemies are underdeveloped. There is not a great deal of enemy variety. There are a large number of enemy portraits to fight. But there are not a wide variety of methods of attack. Most enemies are melee grunts who attack using the same pattern and single attack, whether they are mindless zombies or (supposedly) intelligent bandits. A few combats have enemies with ranged ability, which they use in a largely random fashion, instead of a focused aggressive one. And a rare few  have spellcasters, which use their spells in a largely ineffective fashion. Combats against opponents with special abilities beyond that are really rare.

On the other hand, it is good for the party that enemies remain stupid and unfocused, as the party are always outnumbered and usually fighting on empty square battlemaps, and thus a focused effort would likely easily overwhelm the party. Likewise, the enemy do not have all of the special abilities that the party do. Again, this is a must for the survivability of the party. The power feats that are available are just so intensely powerful, and there is so little defense against them, that having any of those abilities is essentially an I-WIN button.

Which leads to the main issue with the combat - it's is badly balanced. Open character development systems are really hard to balance, and this one is not even remotely in the balanced ballpark. There are some aspects of the character that are hugely beneficial (Super Improved Power Attack), some that are only of minor benefit (Read Enemy hp), and some that are of no benefit at all (fireball).

The animation during the cutscenes are laughable, as is the voice acting. Undoubtedly it was ""someone's mate"" that did both.

Pour ceux qui aiment étudier chaque hexagone de terrain à la recherche de la meilleure stratégie en fonction des troupes en présence. Car ce jeu ne tire sa quintessence que de ses escarmouches, très nombreuses, et non pas de son aspect RPG somme toute assez limité. Certes, chaque personnage recrutable ( mais imposé...) aura sa feuille de caractéristiques/habiletés/pouvoirs très bien documentée, avec une avalanche de chiffres, comme souvent dans les productions allemandes. Certes, vous progresserez de ville en ville, en respectant l'éternel triptyque ""je prends les quêtes, je m'équipe, je me soigne"", mais l'aspect très figé des villages, réduits au rang de - belles - cartes postales, et l'absence d'exploration sur la carte du monde ne favorise pas l'autonomie du joueur que l'on est en droit d'attendre d'un bon RPG. Linéarité est le maître mot de la progression, et les quêtes secondaires, nombreuses, ne sont pour la plupart que des embranchements scénaristiques de la quête principale. Avec très peu de choix influant vraiment sur le monde qui vous entoure. Quand on sait que l'histoire n'est pas particulièrement passionnante et qu'elle met du temps à vraiment démarrer, on se dit qu'on est un peu mal barré.
Mais en fait pas du tout. Cet aspect du jeu ne représentera que 10 à 20% de votre temps. Tout le reste se passera sur les cartes d'escarmouches, et là, le doigté allemand est très appréciable. Certaines batailles, très difficiles, ne pourront être résolues qu'à l'aide de l'environnement qui vous entoure. Les persos que vous aurez à diriger, tous très bien calibrés, pourront par la suite évoluer comme bon vous semble. Comme toujours, créer une multitude d'hybrides, n'est absolument pas conseillé. En général, les batailles ne s'éternisent pas, mis à part certaines séries d'escarmouche qui vous obligeront à jouer très serré. Seul problème qui  occasionnera quelques désagréments pendant votre progression : les statistiques de toucher complètement foireuses. Malgré les 90 % de chance de toucher souvent énoncées avant une attaque, le nombre de ratés sera incroyablement élevé. Simplement parce que ce chiffre ne prend pas en compte les facteurs d'esquive et de parade de l'ennemi. Quand on sait qu'une attaque ratée peut foutre en l'air l'ensemble de sa stratégie dans ce genre de jeu, c'est un peu dur à avaler. Mais on progresse quant même avec plaisir pendant les 40 heures du jeu, en espérant toujours que le hasard statistique ne va pas trop faire des siennes.

Not let me be clear right off the top, I've played a lot of tabletop RPGs but never the system used in this game, and when I played I kicked it to ""Easy"" right off the top.
I'm looking for an enjoyable experience with some good story but I don't have the time to waste with hardcore difficulty.
So if you're looking for a hardcore review from a guy who loves hardcore tactical RPGs you'll be dissipointed.

My first problem with the game is that even after nine hours in the game I don't know the characters. I have no idea who my character is, what he's done, or if there's any reasoning behind anything I've ran across thus far.
The other heroes are so painfully one note it's not even funny. The dwarf is quite possibly insane and is hunting a dragon (which may or may not be real). The mage is a scholor but mostly a well spoken manwhore. The elf is a drug addict who owes people money. Oh, and has an injured sister.

Most of that stuff is what I learned about them in the first five minutes of their appearing and nothing has changed.
The story isn't much better. After nine hours I've discovered that we're trying escape capture and figure out what's going on.
Which is pretty much where I was ten minutes in. It's just going too slow to really get invested in anything.

The second problem is the combat.
I will conceed that they did a nice job of varying the maps and throwing in varying maps with different enviromental hazards.
Unfortunatly that's about all of the nice things I can say. After nine hours I had access to nearly no abilities to play with, a limited number of spells worth using.
Fights for me basically went ""Warriors power attack, mage fire bolts""
Most of the fights feel like I wont mostly because I had more HP than they did rather than any tactical considerations.
And since most of the fights feel the same, the combat quickly feels very much like a grind.

Which is ironic because grinding is something you can't do intentionally.

Combat only happens during missions and subquests. So you can't build up money to buy stuff, and you can't grind to build up some extra XP. So if you're having difficulty there's no way to stack the odds in your favor.

And if you want anything new you will need a LOT of gold. Sadly, though, you won't find much in the way of new equipment, or new weapons for quite some time.

And you know how in D&D looting the bodies after a fight was the most exciting part, because maybe... just maybe you'd get an awesome magical sword, or some kind of unique armor? Well this isn't D&D, you'll get some generic weapons if you're lucky.
You want something unique? Watch for sidequests. Nine hours in there are two. And those two weapons are only marginally better than the weapons you pick up after your first fight.
*sigh*

The final and biggest problem with combat is that it seems to linked to some kind of weird nonsense logic. You can have a 95% chance of hitting and you can (and will) miss three out of four time.
I had a mage with an 85% chance of success cast one successful spell in five rounds. The good news is that failing to cast a spell doesn't cost you magic points, but it wastes your entire round.
And I am aware that enemies have the ability to dodge or parry your attack, but doesn't that seem like something that should be listed in the to hit percental?
If I see 95% to hit, I assume that means that out of a hundred attacks I'll miss five times. The battle Log, which shows the results of all your attacks, isn't any help in deciphering why you've missed. Which is frustrating after three rounds of both my fighters missing an enemy and that same enemy missing them.
If I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I can't fix it.

And don't expect the game to explain it to you. It doesn't.

Basically all of my complaints seems to come down to pacing. It's too slow. The story is too slow for me to get interested in it, the characters develope to slow (if at all) for me to bond with them, my combat options increase too slow so I'm bored with combat, my equipment changes so slowly I'm not really interested in even winning fights, and my abilities increase so slow I'm not even interested in trying to buy the very limited number of skills in the game.
Hell, going into towns in this game is slow! There is a surprisingly long load time to pop into cities which are, for all extents and purposes, a static shot of a the town with three to five people standing around.
Don't expect to explore the town, either, generally you get three icons to click on and then you're officially done with everything the town has to offer.

But I figured, oh well. If playing it on Easy is still a painfully slow slog maybe I can just cheat to get a ton of gold, EXP and just power through the game.
And, unfortunatly, the creators decided that there isn't even a cheating option. Sounds bad for me to complain about that, but after three fights which were basically attrition battles designed to wear down your team and waste your (EXPENSIVE) potions in long drawn out fights where enemies just continiously spawn...

Yeah, I'm tired. I just want to speed things up so I can see if the story gets any better. But I can't. So, I'm done.

1. Does it have a plot? Yes. Is it linear? Yes. Does it matter? Not really.
2. Is the interface aweful? No not in the slightest, you can choose between a right click menu or a standard button bar.
3. Is it full of bugs? No, the bugs like the character inventory head and feet images in the wrong place has been fixed.
4. Is the character creation and character sheet bad? No, actually its very good. You spend 10-15 mins reading everything and realise there is so much death there are lots of replay options to have a different game. Its essentially D&D stats. Played Baldurs Gate, Diablo or any other game like that and its simple, intuitive and in this case, very good.
5. Its all combat, is this bad? Not really, I enjoy limited dialogue and lots of fighting. Baldurs Gate 1&2 are mostly this and they are cult classics. How good was The Banner Saga, I mean we all loved the talking but the hexed passed fighting where was it all was. This is that game on steriods.
6. Is the fact the game based on a roleplay system a problem? No its actually its strength as it has lots of depth. You can turn the battle log to simple mode if you like or you can have the log go mad with the dice rolling detail. (I turn it off).

Its a damn fine enjoyable game, the fact the scenery is a part of the game (Giant birds dropping rocks, crates being knocked over, tenticles from a monster breaking walkways, oil being set on fire, slippery mud, quicksand and bogs) makes this an awesome and unique experience.",1405001145,1405001145,True,2,0,0.522821545600891113,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Прежде чем влить в противника мощный ""перешибу"", нужно ткнуть его быстрым финтом, иначе он грациозно увернётся и ты останешься стоять как дурак, ещё и со штрафами за промах спецударом. Если мой маг три хода подряд кастует одинаковый спел, значит дела идут совсем паршиво и этот спел - лечение. (На четвертое лечение, кстати, маны ему скорее всего не хватит).

Но и это ещё не всё! Каждая боевая арена - торжество геймдизайна. И суть не столько во внешнем виде, сколько в интерактивности. Болота наполнены трясинами (которых не видно) и болотными газами (которые видно и можно поджечь факелом или заклинанием). Подвалы наполнены ящиками (которые можно двигать и ронять), ловушками и выключателями неясного назначения.

Случайных битв в игре нет, что позволило сделать две важные вещи.
1. Очень тонко выстроить баланс сложности. Каждый бой можно продуть, сделав две ошибки. Каждый бой можно выиграть, если не ошибаться. 
2. Грамотно срежиссировать значительную часть боёв. Поставить дополнительных целей, изменить условия, ограничить доступные действия. Всё это делает тактику ""забиться в угол и лупить оттуда фаерболами"" неэффективной в большинстве случаев.

Как вердикт, рекомендую добавить игру в вишлист и ждать скидки. А если тянет на тактику - то можно и прямо сейчас купить.﻿",1404796392,1404796392,True,52,0,0.771325647830963135,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In fact, there was enough for me to put in a solid 60 hours. Some of that time was redoing battles and such, but there were plenty of quests and plenty to do in general.

The game itself is a curious blend of your prototypical Daedalic adventure/point and click game (when you are in towns, albeit with the hidden object stuff removed of course) mixed with turn based hex battles that use random number generators ala XCOM and other luminous titles. The RNG aspect can make things interesting as occasionally, you will inexplicably miss when you show a 95% chance to hit (actually, it isn't inexplicable..you fell victim to that other 5% lol), but at other times, when your percentage is really low and you go for a desperation power move, and it connects, you totally feel excited and stoked for having taken that risk.

Graphically, it wont blow you away. It is reminiscent of other Daedalic games when in cities/towns/etc..., but when in battle, it's more of an isometric approach with movable cameras that can be adjusted to the cardinal directions as well as going from top down to more straight ahead angles. This definitely comes into play during battles as you get different vantage points to make decisions and set actions. Definitely pulls off that middle ages with mysticism look well. The cutscenes are more of the same. Nothing too spectacular, but still effective and definitely in line with the overall game presentation.

The story itself is interesting enough. You are framed for the murder of the princess, whom you and a few of your friends grew up with while under the care and apprenticeship of a powerful wizard. You are arrested, and escape with the help of two other prisoners, who become your stalwart companions. From there, you are at first trying to solve the murder and clear your name, but as things progress, you uncover a plot that can destroy the world. At that point, your goals become far more lofty. The story was engaging enough to keep me interested throughout. Which was necessary, as the pace of the game was not very fast. In fact, it took a while for me to get to the point where my characters were able to resolve the more difficult battles without copious retries.

The battle system itself was pretty stellar in my opinion. If you have played XCOM or other turn based hex battle system games, you will have a good grasp for this game fairly quickly as far as the combat is concerned. What they don't do is churn out the same basic layout over and over. Each battle gets it's own unique battle map, which was stellar in my opinion. You never get bored from seeing the same map over and over, which even XCOM as guilty of (I keep going back o XCOM as a reference due to its accessibility as a point of reference for this games combat systems). The geography of the battle is often as important as your positioning relative to your enemies. Often, there will be traps, mires/bogs, and other obstacles that will hinder or help you and your enemies. Cover is provided on many maps. Interactive objects also make there way into the battlefield. For example, there might be a stack of barrels that you can knock over to crush enemies underneath or simply block their path (and they might use those same stacks), a stand filled with rocks that can be knocked over, bookcases, oil filled barrels that explode, pools of oil, vats of poison, simple chairs and tables, etc....The battle maps were supremely well thought out in my opinion and kept things pretty fresh. In addition to all that, there might be goals other than simply destroying your enemy, such as trying to fight your way to a specific part of the map, free prisoners to help you fight, defend citizens as they try to flee the battle zone, escort missions, and so on. There was even two instances where complete stealth was necessary and one where you are fighting your way through a cavern while also trying to stay ahead of a poison cloud that creeps slowly forward behind you. So much variety. It was really quite impressive.

The quests were pretty standard fare for the most part. Go find this missing person, please retrieve this item and possibly take it to somebody else, find out what this person or that person is hiding, intercept shipments, and so on. They were fun, and if you play RPG's, they are par for the course. However, they were much easier to finish and never dragged out. Short and to the point as it were. I had a lot of fun with them, and finished every quest the game had to offer.The main quest itself was pretty interesting, as I mentioned before, and kept you moving forward.

The pacing itself was pretty slow. In fact, the first few hours of gameplay might dissuade some people from continuing on. It takes a while for the game to start really sending you places, and it also takes a while for you to be able to upgrade your equipment and abilities. However, once you get past that initial stage, the game never stops moving forward, even if it is at a slower tan normal RPG pace. I wouldn't get discouraged by this. Once it really got going, I never looked back, although I did break up the gameplay by taking a day off in between sessions to play other types of games. I think that approach benefited the gameplay here, as it helped me to stay interested. The reason I mention this is because, on top of all that, this game is absolutely combat focused and is quite grind-ey. In fact, you will pretty much need to grind out every battle to level up enough to have a reasonable experience later in the game. Fortunately, even if you wrap up all te quests, there is the option to do gladiator fights whenever you want (after you become the champions of the gladiator ring), which will fill out any necessary experience and give you extra cash to spend on potions and such, which you will definitely need to do.

Healing and mana potions (they don't call it mana, but same thing) are an absolute necessity, and especially towards the end of the game, you will want to have as many as possible. You cant have too many, and they don't carry any inventory weight with them, so there is no reason not to keep yourself well stocked. The only other things I ever really spent my coins on were arrows and the occasional armor upgrade. You will find plenty of weapons, poisons, etc...throughout the game and shouldn't need to buy any after maybe your first couple upgrades. At a certain point, those all become more than plentiful via combat spoils. You do have party encumbrance, but I never really found it to be an issue, and went over several times, lol. As far as the inventory system goes, it's pretty simple...you have your various clothing slots (which equate to pants, shoes, gloves, shirt, and hat). You have three weapon loadout slots (during battle, you can switch between the three, but each switch counts as a turn). Each loadout has two hands available, so one loadout might be sword and shield, another might be bow and arrows, another might be a greatsword, etc...You also wear a belt which can have as many as 4 slots available (depending on the belt itself). Each slot will hold one disposable item (potion, poison, grenade (equivalent), or throwing weapon).

The RPG system is fairly deep in my opinion. There are several categories that all pull from the same pool of experience points you earn, so you need to be judicious in how you spend those points. There are plenty of guides on the topic although I just used what I thought would work well with a touch of common sense and an idea of how to build a party mixed in, lol. The breakdown is abilities (strength, courage, dexterity, charisma, etc...), talents (such as survival, warfare, traps, healing, willpower, and so on), weapon skills (specific weapon categories....bows, axes and maces, two handed swords, two handed axes and maces, staffs, ec...) *continued in comment section*",1404716501,1429445206,True,290,2,0.904532551765441895,12,False,False,False,False,,,

******** AVISOS **********

* Contém *alguns* spoilers.
* Só joguei até o capítulo 3, com um ""ranger"".
* Antes de jogar, li exaustivamente o sistema de regras no qual o sistema é baseado, além de alguns tutoriais do jogo em si.

***************************

Prós:

- A ambientação é bastante interessante.
- O jogo não tem classes, você monta seu personagem da forma como melhor lhe aprouver.
- O mundo é meio dark, e contém algumas decisões/opções de diálogo mais maduras.
- A história difere um pouco do padrão de jogos de fantasia: herói em sua armadura reluzente, reúne um grupo de também heróis para salvar o mundo do mal. Ela não é tão ""preto e branca"", tem algumas escalas de cinza =) E os “heróis” estão mais pra anti-heróis.

Contras:

- Não curti o sistema de regras, baseado no dark eye versão 4. Por exemplo, achei exagero 3 testes para cada uso de talento ou magia, o que faz no começo as magias falharem com alguma frequência.
- Poucas magias (24).
- A animação dos personagens é estranha: reparem como a boca dos personagens mexe quando eles falam!
- A história parece forçada em determinados pontos: personagens entram no seu grupo pela simples razão de não terem lugar melhor para ir e vão ficando como se não tivessem objetivos muito claros. Um personagem seu morre DO NADA numa determinada batalha, sendo que teoricamente seria possível salva-lo.
- Personagens não são muito carismáticos... E algumas missões parecem ser forçadas também.
- Não parece haver ""ritmo"" na dificuldade das batalhas, a maioria é bastante fácil, mas de vez em quando vem alguma MUITO difícil de repente, e não necessariamente é de boss.
- Achei a dublagem um pouco fraca.

Dicas e sugestões:

- Sugiro FORTEMENTE que leiam alguma coisa sobre o sistema de regras e sobre o jogo em si ANTES de começar a jogar... Pode economizar muita frustração saber de antemão onde colocar os pontos :) Segue alguns links pra ajudar(em inglês).
- Resumo sobre o sistema de regras Dark Eye:  http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/16/16082.phtml

You take on the role of a criminal that has been accused of murder and your ultimate goal is to escape the people that are after you and find out exactly what happened to you... and probably save the world. 

You can pick from a roughly customizable melee fighter, an archer, or a mage to start out with and you will acquire a melee fighter and a mage in your party after the first couple of fights. You do not get your 4th party member, an archer,  until about half way through chapter one. 

The fighting is actually strategic with being able to move and take an action, move further but not be able to take an action that turn, or wait and the rest of that characters turn will move to the end of the queue for that turn. There are a lot of things that can be interacted with in the battles for various effects, such as lighting things on fire to cause damage to anything moving through them, activating traps, or removing items that are giving enemies buffs. 

There is the occasional difficulty spike, but if you think strategically you can work around them. Your choices also have at least short term consequences, and possibly long term ones. Enemy AI can be used against them, which is a bit sad to watch occasionally. It is a bit disappointing watching as the enemy stands in the same spot turn after turn and takes trap damage because one of your characters is standing one spot over and within melee range. 

Character interactions are amazingly fun. The stock melee character you get at the start of the game is very gruff, and will shout out lines if you heal him with magic, just as an example. The dialog outside of battle is just as fun, with one of the characters being obviously very self-serving and causing a bit of trouble because of it. 

Skill trees seem to be fairly balanced, but within the first couple chapters of the game having an archer or 2 is a godsend. My archers have probably taken out more enemies than my melee fighter, so I make sure I am very well stocked on arrows. Mages start out very weak, and don't pick up until they get some levels on their skills to improve their accuracy.

Now the bad, some of the encounters are annoying or just outright boring. I hate seeing crypt lice because they're boring to kill. Another couple instances had me defending an endless stream of helpless NPCs until they got through a gate, and the enemies respawn until a certain number of NPCs get out of the gate. Boring, tedious, and not very fun... especially when the respawning enemies have a throw attack that is capable of instantly killing the NPCs on an unlucky roll. Money is not exactly easy to come by early on and items are EXPENSIVE. So you will be getting a lot of your gear through drops for a fair bit... and enemies drop weapons far more often than armor. 

Good game, definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of the TBS games.",1404186518,1404186518,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Se você gosta de RPG, então a recomendação cresce ainda mais. Apesar da menção ao RPG, esse jogo parece mais com títulos como Final Fantasy Tactics ou Tactics Ogre do que com títulos mais ""RPGisticos"" como Baldur's Gate ou The Temple of Elemental Evil. Apenas o universo do RPG é usado, não todos os seus elementos principais.

BlackGuards é composto praticamente de apenas três elementos: Batalhas, História e Mapa.

Mapa: o jogador percorre o mundo através do mapa. No mapa há apenas dois tipos de marcações: cidades ou pontos de batalhas. As cidades são telas estáticas com uns poucos NPCs para negociar itens ou dar missões. Não tem como você explorar a cidade, tudo que aquela cidade pode oferecer já está sendo exibido naquela única tela.

Batalhas: Onde as coisas realmente acontecem e é o grande ponto forte do jogo. As batalhas são divertidas e difíceis se você não entender bem como a mecânica do jogo funciona. É necessário fazer uma boa construção de personagem e mesclar bem as habilidades de seu grupo para poder superar os desafios sem muita dificuldade. Tudo que um fã de jogos de estratégia gosta!

História: antes, durante ou depois de cada batalha acontece uma cutscene ou animação para mostrar o desenrolar da história do jogo e aqui fica a maior crítica. Quase não há interação durante a história, você é praticamente um espectador durante esses eventos. Quase não há escolhas a serem feitas. As poucas vezes que você é convocado a interagir durante os diálogos, suas escolhas aparentemente não fazem diferença para história.

* Pontos Fortes

- Sistema de construção de personagens.
- Interação com objetos durante as batalhas.
- Batalhas em si
- Apesar das limitações, até que os personagens tem algum carisma.

* Pontos Fracos

- Pouca interação entre os personagens e entre esses e o mundo
- História linear. Embora o jogador possa escolher ente ir primeiro a um lugar em vez de outro isso não afeta a história.

The problem that I'm having is that this game crashes pretty frequently. I don't think it's my computer causing it, but I could be wrong about that. 

If, and when, any stability issues have been worked out, either by the developer, or by me, I will change my recommendation to yes.

It feels like a solid title through and through and it has hours of fun and enjoyment in it where you will be redoing battles over and over until you find the right strategy for them and beat them easily. This is definitely a challenging game with a lot of good sides to it, but it has one major flaw, and that is that it is far from complete and full of game-ending bugs. Expect to go somewhere and not being able to play if you make that choice because the game will crash if you make that certain turn, if you were lucky you had savegames prior to that choice, if not - then you have to start all over again.

By game-breaking bugs I mean that when you reach a certain location, the game will just crash every single time you go there. Reloading the game won't help, it will continuously crash and if you had an old savegame you can get around it, otherwise you are screwed until they either fix it, or you move on to another game, alternatively give this game another try and remember what choice you made that led to the crashing.

Unfortunately this is a dealbreaker for me, and while I did have a lot of fun, I didn't get to experience the game as I played it, and I refuse to go back to change how I played just because the game is unfinished. Supposedly it's going to be done this autumn, but I doubt there will be much more development on this title, they've been releasing a DLC for it already, and announced a sequel, which is underway. It's a pity that a title that has such great core mechanics get ruined in the details, but such is the way right now. 

It is quite possible that you do not run into these bugs, and have an excellent experience, but keep in mind, you might end up like me.

You only get a clean slate on your own character, and because the way the trainers are laid out you can’t develop your character the way you want, his all ties into the game being very linear.
You can’t rotate the camera expect on one axis, which makes some fights awkward.
Shield only helps per parry you get, so shields are not that great.

2.  Strategy gamers will find the combat tacky and repetitive because it always comes down to enemies trying to overwhelm you with odds with very simplistic AI.

3.  It can't possibly appeal to people looking for a great story because the story is clearly an afterthought.  You get brief looks into your characters pasts between drawn out combat sessions but there's no real development.  Things just happen and force you into the next fight.

+ great gameplay (not as good as XCOMs but still nice)
+ based on The Dark Eye - refreshing compared to all the games based on D&D
+ nice story
+ nice quests (and side quests)
+ funny interaction in-between the characters
+ really good value for money when on sale
+ lots of different skills and builds to explore (a bit confusing and overwhelming for beginners though)
+ good difficulty (it will be very challenging at times and you will have to change your tactics which worked before)


-	Obviously not a huge development budget (they made the best out of it)
-	Graphics are nice but could be way better (eg. cutscenes …)
-	Skills & talents can be difficult to understand. You’ll probably need to google a bit to understand the different character values.
-	Some bugs can be frustrating, eg. when the healer in-between the gladiator fights won’t heal you anymore. There aren’t many but this one made it very hard for me
-	Save often. (same as xcom). It could save you time.
-	Usability in the stat/spell/… screens could be better, especially when trying to figure out which weapon does more damage.

All in all, I can live without the best graphics and animations (like XCOM does superb). I was willing to learn about the skills and mechanics. I accepted the couple of bugs I encountered – it only lead to the game being more difficult but didn’t break the game itself.

After reading many negative reviews I think the problem is that this game isn’t like many other games out there, it’s comparable to XCOM but with possibility to skill your characters in a complex way. You can’t save every minute and decisions you made today could be a problem much later. You may have to do some side quests to get the experience to advance. You won’t be able to blindly upgrade every skill and spell there is. You will have to use different tactics. Using Takate with his piercing skill will work awesome most of the time, but if an enemy is immune to piercing you should better have given him some other weapon and skills (I learned this the hard way).

Obviously something went wrong during the beta version, because most of the negative reviews are from back then. I didn’t experience many of the problems from back then. If you like turn based games with a lot of strategy involved you’ll probably like this. If you want to kill many monsters with huge firewalls better get path of exile ;)

[b]Was ist Blackguards[/b]
Blackguards will ein altes RPG Element wieder aufleben lassen und Rundenbasierte Kämpfe wieder Salonfähig machen. Hierbei stützen die Entwickler sich auf das Regelwerk von DSA ( Das Schwarze Auge ) und erhoffen durch ein Konsequentes einhalten dieser den Spielspaß sicher einzubringen. Was leider nicht zu 100% klappt. 

[b]Die Geschichte&Quests[/b]
Es ist schon fast klassisch im Rollenspiel irgendwo aufzuwachen und sich an nichts mehr zu erinnern. Immerhin kenne ich meinen Namen und meinen besten Freund, der mich komischerweise inzwischen vernichten will. So haben Geschichtenschreiber immer eine gute Möglichkeit den Plot langsam zu entwickeln, anstatt den Spieler direkt mit 1000 Informationen zu erschlagen. Also muss ich erst mal, nach meiner Festnahme, fliehen und dann meinen ehemals besten Freund finden. Die Story hat ein paar gute Wendungen, aber man darf hier nicht aufwendige Sequenzen erwarten. Generell wird die Geschichte in Spielgrafik, oder nur über Textfenster erzählt. Insgesamt gibt es nur wenige Rendervideos im Spiel, die man sich von der Qualität her auch hätte sparen können. 

[b]Skills&Fähigkeiten der Party[/b]
Natürlich gehören zum DSA Regelwerk unzählige Skills und Fähigkeiten für die Party. Diese können Rollenspielanfänger ziemlich erschlagen, vor allem da es keine Möglichkeit gibt diese wieder zu verlernen und die in Schlachten schwer erkämpften Erfahrungspunkte zurück zu erhalten. So ist das skillen ein wenig Try & Error und man kann sich wie in einem klassischen Diablo auch verskillen und schon sind 20 Stunden Spielzeit für die Katz. 

Dieses Schicksal blieb mir zum Glück erspart, da ich sehr strickt alle Partymitglieder nur in eine Richtung geskillt hatte und wenn man alle Nebenquests mit erledigt hat man auch einen gewissen Überschuss an XP. 

[b]Der vermaledeite Kampf[/b]
Dank DSA Regelwerk werden erfolgreiche Angriffe gewürfelt und dadurch erhält das Spiel eigentlich seinen schlimmsten Faktor: ""das Glück!"" Teilweise muss man Schlachten einfach mehrfach wiederholen weil man einfach Pech hatte und trotz sehr gutem Verteidigungswert sehr viele Treffer kassiert hatte, oder einfach der falsche Charakter gerade unter Gedankenkontrolle geraten ist, oder zufällig nun Skelette kommen und wir keine Hiebwaffen parat haben. ( Stichwaffen machen z.B. keinen Schaden an Skeletten ) 

Man sollte beim Durchspielen deshalb eine hohe Frustrationsschwelle haben, da manche Kämpfe erst mal unschaffbar anmuten und dann doch irgendwann funktionieren. Ich hab in dem Fall das Spiel dann immer erst mal ein paar Tage beiseitegelegt.

[b]Fazit[/b]
Blackguards ist kein schlechtes Rollenspiel, aber ich kann es leider nicht als Vollpreistitel empfehlen. Dafür ist das Spiel an manchen Ecken zu sperrig und hat zu viele Kanten. Manchmal wirkt es auch nicht balanciert und so schwankt der Schwierigkeitsgrad enorm zwischen den Quests. Auch das falsche Skillen ist störend, da das Spiel hier auch kaum Hilfestellungen gibt wie bei anderen Rollenspielen. Hier wäre es schön gewesen einen automatischen Level Aufstieg für Spieler zu hinterlegen die so etwas brauchen. Auch wirkt, vor allem gegen Ende hin, das Spiel extrem durch Kämpfe gestreckt. Wenn wir in den letzten Abschnitt eintauchen und das Spiel mich schon darüber informiert das es danach kein Zurück mehr gibt geh ich davon aus dass ich nun zu einem knackigen Ende komme. Stattdessen kämpfe ich mich mehrere Stunden durch sinnlose Schlachten und arbeite diese nur noch ab. Ohne das die Story wirklich voran gebracht wird. Hier funktioniert das Spiel anfänglich und in der Mitte der Geschichte weitaus besser. 
Deshalb ist Blackguards nur etwas für dich wenn du rundenbasierte Kämpfe mit Glücksfaktor liebst und es dich nicht frustriert diese manchmal öfters als einmal anzugehen.",1403698459,1418161581,False,26,0,0.524146676063537598,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I believe that this game received too much praise from reviewers who did not play far enough into the game.
The complaints I had with this game I found had been discussed by other players while the game was in Beta on the Blackgaurd forums. The developers obviously did not take these potentially game saving points on, which is the most disappointing thing of all.

Although even those are just a numbers game, just bigger numbers. You can also choose your starting equipment, this is pretty neat, if it weren't for the fact that you lose all of your equipment after your first combat.

Speaking of combat, every action you do has a high chance of failing, from casting a spell to setting a trap to swinging a club. The chance to hit or be succesful is made harder by your enemies' defenses. Wait, that's not all, the damage range of your weapons goes from 1-6, 5-10, or 4-12 for example, this damage is further reduced by your enemies' damage reduction %, and flat damage reduction. This means that on top of the abnormally high miss chance(plus dodge and parry chances!), actually dealing damage is stupendously hard. Now imagine most enemies have around the same health as you, 30ish. So what do you do? You wail on the enemies until they fall down, hoping you even hit them. This makes combat feel sluggish, your actions meaningless, and generally make you waste time.

The story? You get to choose which lines are said first.. sometimes. It also appears you get some dialogue options at times. None of these worked, and didn't work the few times I did try them. Perhaps they work later in the game when you have a higher Charisma? Thing is, I maxed my charisma, it wouldn't go higher, so why have those options there at the start anyway? To waste my time?

Weit weniger gefallen hat mir die Bedeutung der Umgebung, die man sich im Kampf zunutze machen kann. Das Feature liest sich gut, macht gelegentlich auch Spaß, aber nach ein paar Experimenten habe ich einfach keine Lust mehr gehabt, es konsequent zu nutzen. Und dann sind manche Levels schlicht eine Qual (Stichwort: Todesräder!). Oder ohne Einsatz der Umgebung nicht zu gewinnen. Wenn ich mich dem Design nicht füge, ist das natürlich letztlich mein Problem und nicht das der Designer.  Was mir das Spiel letztlich völlig kaputt gemacht hat, war die Serie von Trial-and-error-Arenakämpfen, die jeweils beim Unterbrechen einer Session nicht zwischengespeichert werden konnte. Gerade wenn man durch kleine Fehler einen Kampf so leicht verlieren lassen können, ist es indiskutabel, dass man das Spiel am Ende des Tages nicht wenigstens quicksaven kann und tags darauf immer wieder bei Kampf 1 einsteigen musste.

Do you like campaigns in which dialogue options are almost meaningless and the plot is confusing? Well if you haven't, Blackguards can fill that void for you. 

The plot isn't bad. It captured my attention fairly early and has some nice twists in it. The main focus of this game, however, is the combat system. I love the combat in this game. Blackguards uses a version of tabletop rules to fuel its combat. There are even simulated dice rolls for damage and hit chance. Unfortunately, (or fortunately depending) pretty much every dialogue option leads to some sort of cliche combat. Very rarely is there a non-combat solution to anything. 

The character creation is pretty cool also. There are two modes; basic and advanced. The creation is very open and is manipulated by AP (adventure points (I think)). Using these points (earned from combat and completion of quests), you can add talents, special abilities, spells, and basic attributes to your character, none being restricted to your character (except spells in some cases). 

Unfortunately, this game does have some downsides. Some of the encounters are downright frustrating and (at least for me), very difficult. A number of times I've had to walk away from the game or take a break. These particular encounters seem to me generated specifically to be hard and not at all story oriented. I won't go into much detail about them so I don't spoil the ""fun"" for you. On the plus side however, there is no penalty for losing as the game forces you to keep trying unless you load a previous save before the encounter.

The graphics are actually quite nice and are better than I expected. The layout for combat is excellent, using hex-tiles and a partially destructible environment. The cities however seem more like pretty backdrops for my character sheets and are fairly dull. 

I would recommend this game if you are an avid tabletop gamer looking for your D&D fix, or someone who appreciates tabletop games.

Blackguards is a turn-based fantasy RPG from German outfit Daedalic which is solely based on the Dark Eye roleplaying system. It provides a welcome return to the true turn based RPG combat genre which forces you to greatly consider every action you make, whether that be skill points, combat skills and many more. It provides a good level of difficulty, without going too over-board whilst allowing you a ‘life-line’, a bone for when things get tough – i.e. the all-important and crucial save feature between battles. The overall storyline, writing, voice-acting is good whilst providing enough depth to avoid it being a drag.

Combat is where Blackguards best feature occurs and is perfect for players who enjoy the battles on hex tiles to that of the stories behind them. The use of objects on battle-maps combined with an easy to understand combat interface and a variety of character abilities/skills allows the player to get in and get on with gameplay.

Difficultly in digesting a variety of character abilities, skill points and equipment load-outs, specifically the equipment system, as that proved most challenging and somewhat confusing due to the amount of resistances available. However, once you’ve taken the time to understand how they all interlink, this section opens up to provide the player with a great variety of levelling up elements.

Can appear to be somewhat repetitive if players aren’t enveloped in the storyline. Far too many loading screens which stops the flow of the story and battles far too often.

A very stylish and graphically intense RPG, scoring high on the styles category, specifically in the gorgeous looking towns/outposts, where players are faced with beautifully designed shops and scenery which differs throughout the storyline.
A mediocre score for value with its current (09/03/14) price tag of £26.99.

Blackguards provides players with the opportunity to play for hours on end, experiencing a whole array of new content/utilising new tactics, however players are forced to read every snippet of information/guide to fully understand its complicated character system and some battles can appear to be rather repetitive.",1401620760,1401620760,True,5,0,0.545263290405273438,0,False,False,False,False,,,

After getting to the last battle and finding it frustrating not to have Aurelia, I went back through chapters 4-5 changing strategies. 

The good:

-Not a lot of min/maxing of gear (some of the best gear is available early in the game, and most of the stuff you'll find in the game will not be an upgrade)
-Each of the companions have really well-drawn out personalities (the dwarf, for example, will complain when you heal him that he ""doesn't need it""; the playboy mage will flirt with NPC's you meet).

The bad:
-There are not a lot of varieties of bad guys in the game.  You'll find yourself saying ""didn't I just fight this battle?"" a bit too frequently
- For people that like seeing gear progression, you will not get it here.
- The ending was quite a bit of a let-down.
- During combat, there is no way to speed up the monsters' turns; and you will sometimes literally be waiting a minute between turns while a slug slugs its way across the screen.

The meat of this game is developing your characters and engaging in challenging tactical combat. I played on hard difficulty and it was no joke. You know you have a winner when your first time through a fight feels like a hopeless battle you can’t possibly win, but coming back for another try (or 5) you start to see a path and sure enough you snatch victory from the claws of your enemies. I found myself saying a lot of “No no no!! and Yes yes yes!!” and that is a good sign indeed.

A decent system for equipment and hard choices to make for what kind of characters to develop and when make for pretty reasonable strategic choices between fights. I never quite felt like re-starting to make different choices but I switched focus and direction a few times as I learned what worked and what didn’t. Better yet, different fights call for very different approaches and play to the strengths and weaknesses of your character. There is no one right answer or best build, just a lot of different good choices you need to learn how to utilize. The only mistake you can make is not learning the mechanics and failing to do any specialization at all.

On the other hand, while the voice acting is fine and the writing is decent, I was never all that compelled by either the characters or the story. It was never daft or cliche or bad in any way, but rarely all that awesome or intriguing. There are minor choices to be made here and there but rarely do they feel all that impactful and while the order you do quests is often open, there is rarely a feeling it matters all that much either.

The game is worth the money, especially if you love tactical combat and like a stiff challenge. If you are looking for a story driven RPG or something with a feeling of grand adventure, this might not be your game.",1400033838,1400033838,True,2,0,0.511930584907531738,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm a long-time player of the Heroes of Might and Magic games as well as the King's Bounty games. Now, I'm not saying that these games are the same, they aren't, but they should at least have prepared me for Blackguards. I felt at home in the first few fights, and had a great time leveling and progressing. But, and this is a big but (tee hee), things soon fell apart, and I could not be more disappointed. Here is the list:

1) Difficulty Spikes - Elitist players can go on and on about how 'you aren't playing the game right', but this game is fundamentally flawed; with *five pages* of things to use your AP points (think leveling points) on, it becomes *incredibly* easy to spec your character incorrectly, thereby completely and utterly breaking your game, forcing you to start over. Not to mention the fact that the first handful of fights are pretty easy, then suddenly the game shoots up in difficulty. A game like this should have the ability to respec your characters, or to at *least* give you more of a guide on what you should be spending your points on; it's WAY too easy to make a mistake if you're not familiar with the system the game is based on.

2) The Fighting - The basics of the battle system seem quite good; all of the things are there to make them an enjoyable experience, however... The sheer amount of missing, dodging, and obviously AI-weighted dice rolls makes this game ridiculous. People can say what they will about ""99% chance to hit still isn't 100%"", but there are clear patterns of AI-rubber banding/favoritism, making the game *incredibly* frustrating, and fights lasting WAY longer than they should.

3) Spellcasting - Never have I played a game where spells fail so. bloody. often. What is the point of playing a mage? Their spells fizzle so incredibly often, and they take so much damage that you're pretty much forced to use bows or crossbows to keep them alive, and, as another reviewer mentioned, the only point in having them around is to heal/buff/debuff. Incredibly disappointing.

4) Poor Battle Structuring - I probably should have put this onto the fighting or difficulty section, but I felt it merited it's own section. There are times where you're in a tough battle, but you manage to scrape by by the skin of your teeth, and you're elated. Bask in your rewards! All those AP and Go...wait what? There's ANOTHER battle IMMEDIATELY after? And you don't get a chance to heal? What? You're out of Mana??? Guess that means you're going to have to start the first battle all over again! What's that? There's no potions left? Etc, etc etc. There *needs* to be a way of either warning you of multiple fights in a row(some places like the Gladiator Arena does), or at *least* give you the chance to heal between battles. I'm currently at said gladiator arena and have basically given up on the game and wish I hadn't spent my time and money on it.

This game could have been SO much better; the story is interesting enough to keep you going, and the visuals are quite nice, (and DWARVES!) but the poor battle structure, difficulty spikes, flawed dice rolling (Seriously, a weak 'normal' monster dodged me literally 11 times in a row from all four characters..?), and unfortunate leveling flow choices make this a ""do not buy unless changes are made"". If things are tweaked, this could be a fairly good game, but at it's current state it's nothing more than a frustrating game of blindfolded tennis, (Whiff, whiff, whiff, whiff) and I regret spending money on it.",1398798766,1398798766,False,4,0,0.523309230804443359,0,False,False,False,False,,,

For the same reason I enjoyed other old school CRPGs. It had enough of a story to keep it interesting, the combat was challenging and very tactical, and the character/skill/spell system was deep and interesting. If you like old school CRPGs, I highly recommend this game.

What does old school CRPG mean?
Graphics - while good for a CRPG are nowhere near cutting edge. If you must play something to justify your $1000 dual video card setup, this game is not it..
Sound - voice overs a generally very high quality and clearly done by professionals
Combat - this and the skill system are the meat of any CRPG. Combat is very tactical which makes it fun for me. Anything on the field of combat can be pushed over, destroyed, lit on fire, etc. So for example you can lure your opponents to stand in bushes and cast a fireball on them and not only will they take the initial damage they will take per round damage when the bushes catch fire. Lots and lots of tactical depth and different options make combat fun and at times quite challenging.
Character/Skill/Spell System - the other key part of any CRPG. I like The Dark Age system and this game uses that system to create a very deep and interesting set of skills, spells, and attributes to choose from to build your main character and your party of NPCs.
Party-based - Old school CRPGs are almost always party-based and this game checks that box with 5 NPCs that join (and in most cases stay) with your group throughout the game. You'll play most of the game with you PC and 3 NPCs.
LInear - all good old school CRPGs are linear so they can control the level of opponent you face and unfold the story in a particular way. Books and movies and are linear too and that's what makes them good. I like old school CRPGs to be linear and tell a story and create custome encounters (rather than random ones). Don't get me wrong, I like games like Skyrim, but I generally prefer old school linear CRPGs as the rule and open games like Skyrim as the exception.
Story - good enough to keep it interesting.....

If you like old school CRPGs don't miss this one.

- Akt3 all of them are using poisen!?
- Is there any KI in this game or do you just lie, to make the game interresting.

- Why is the user not beeing warned bevore 3 Battles in a row?
- Why do you not warn the user befor battle (Because its easier to say ""safe often""?)
- The KI is just very bad
- The Story Line is not fluent. Why is Lysander chrashed by the Monster, when the main Character kills him.
Then there should be a Video, where the main character kills him.
- It seams they didn't understand the story of the nameless!?
- Why are the quest you get on the street between to citys so hard, 
and the Main Boss like Lysander killed by two shots?
- Wheres the strategy in this game.
- Why is this tiny game crashing more often then Skyrim?
- Why you created only one Lether Armor.
- Why is there no robes till Akt4.

Donc déjà, avis à tout ceux qui aime les combats au tour par tour inauguré sous cette forme par la séries des heroes of might and magic vous serez servi !!!
Ici 80% du jeu se sont les combat des ""heroes"". les 20% restant c'est aller du point A au point B et zapper vite fait bien fait les texte de quête.
Jeu sous titré FR, c'est pas mal, certaines trad seraient à revoir mais sinon dans l'ensemble c'est bien. Un arbre de skills relativement fourni, il est dommage de n'avoir que deux catégories de personnage, les ""combatants"" et les ""mages"". sachant qu'un mage peut être spécialisé en corps à corps sans problème, la réciproque n'est pas vrai.
Là où je trouve le système de combat bancal c'est sur des points de détails.
je prend par exemple mes héros de cac. Stat maximum, skill au max, des armes pas dégueu, comparé au 5 à 9 points de dégats que je faisais en début de partie, maintenant j'en fait 15-30. Je ne ressens aucun monté en puissance. Peut-être y a-t-il des armes légendaires à découvrir ... mais bon ... si je me fais chier à monter un héros dans une branche précise, j'entend qu'une fois au max il fasse des degats de bourrin. Soit c'est le stuff qui merde soit c'est l'équilibrage et le skill en lui même qui est à revoir, mais là si on retirer les niveaux du jeu les skills et tout le bordel, en fait si on retire toute la partie rpg du jeu, je met toujours autant de temps à tuer mes mobs qu'au tout début du jeu.
A quoi sert la partie rpg alors ?
Je passe au mage ... woaaa les mages ... par defaut c'est eux les gros bourrins, mega sorts de cinglés, dégats en chaines qui te poutrent tout, invocation dans tout les sens, j'en passe et des meilleurs ...
Comment décrire ce sentiment ... mmmm ...
Je sais.
Mes mages sont impuissant.
pourtant sur 3 mago il n'y a qu'un seul mec, et bah non les nana sont solidaire du pauvre mage impuissant.
Comment ça se traduit, bah j'ai eut le sort de la boule de feu en début de partie ... c'est toujours le même sort que j'utilise à l'heure actuelle.
Non, non, il ne fais pas des degats de dingue, non il n'est pas gratuit en mana, non il ne fais pas de distinction entre alliés et ennemis ... C'est juste le SEUL sort vraiment utile de TOUTE la panoplie de sorts d'attaque.
Je vous explique comment se déroule un combat dans mon équipe composée de 3 mage et 2 distant.
Tour 1 : les trois mages lances leur 3 ombre niveau 3 (pas la niveau 4 c'est useless) au cac des ennemis. Les deux distant attaquent à distance. les trois ombres attaque au cac.
Tour 2 : Les cinq perso attaquent à distance le temps que les ennemis se regroupe sur les trois ombres et elles attaquent au cac.
Tour 3 : les 3 mages balancent des boules de feu sur tout les mobs regrouppés autour des trois ombres qui attaquent au cac. les deux distances attaquent.
Tour 4 = Tour 3.
Tour 5 = Tour 4.
Tour 6 : tout les ennemis sont morts.

Je ne lance jamais de heal, très rarement le soin de poison de masse à moins d'avoir à traverser une salle entière remplie de poison. Je ne lance pas de debuff, car un mob même aveuglé continue de te toucher en lançant son javelot à 20 case de distance, il continue de se déplacer si tu l'as congelé et continue de te mettre des tartes au corps à corps si tu lui met un statut de type faiblesse. Pareil je ne met jamais de buff.

Pourquoi me demanderez-vous ?

A cause du système de régénération de points de mana.
A mon niveau chacun de mes mage régénèrent 3 points de mana par tour de combat.
SEULEMENT PAR TOUR DE COMBAT.
Cela signifie que quanf vous êtes en ville, que vous vous baladez sur la map ...etc la mana de vos mages ne regen pas, donc si vous avez quittez le précédent combat avec moins de 10 points de mana vous engagez le suivant avec le même niveau, et vos mages ne servent à rien.

Ce qui m'oblige à un combat sur deux de changer mes mages en archer honoraires, comme ça les ombres occupent toujours les ennemis pendant que eux attaquent avec leurs arc histoire de regen assez de mana pour le combat suivant.

Pourquoi je ne regen pas ma mana avec des potions ? ha ha ... oui ... pourquoi hein ? A part celles que je trouve sur le terrain et que je glisse dans les ceintures de mes magos pour les combats contre les boss, je n'en achète pas, parce que c'est cher. Et l'argent est un véritable problème dans ce jeu. Par exemple pour vous donnez une idée, mes ombres dont je parle dans mes phase de combat, qui sont ULTRA CHEAT, il faut acheter un livre pour apprendre se sort à mes mago, ce livre coute 250 pièces d'or, et ce livre n'est achetable que dans le DEBUT DE PARTIE, car une fois un certain point arrivé, il est impossible de retourner dans les premières villes. EN DEBUT DE PARTIE LES COMBAT TE RAPPORTE A PEINE 20 PIECES D'ARGENT ! Donc faut acheter aucun stuff pour son equipe, tout recup sur le terrain, mettre tout l'argent de coté pour acheter ce livre ! Et tout le jeu est comme ça. je n'ai pu commencer à m'acheter des armures que récemment car une bonne moitié du jeu je devais mettre de coté pour acheter les armes, les fleches, les livres de sorts etc...

Donc bon voila quoi ... les cac ne font pas assez de degats au cac, les magos sont handicapés en regen de mana donc un combat sur deux on utilise pas de magie ...

La seule façon de se sentir puissant c'est de jouer archer tout ses perso, une fois qu'on obtient en milieu de partie le déluge de flèche qui permet de tirer tois flèches d'affilées sur une cible là on se sent fort car les dégats sont pas moche du tout !!
Mais bon même quand t'as tes 5 perso qui ont 90% de réussite de déluge de flèches, qu'ils tir tous sur la même cible en ayant 90% de la toucher et que t'en à 4 qui échouent ... 

tu te dit : ""WTF !!!""

Et tu retourne à tes boules de feu, qui elles, consomment du mana et font moins de dégats, mais qui touchent toujours !!!

Je suppose que si j'étais vraiment en galère de jeu je finirai ce jeu, qui malgré ces lacunes évidente sur les 80% du jeu que représentent les combats, est pas mal :)

I would recommend this game if you have a lot of free time because the battle (which is 95% of the game) are super long. You'll spend a lot of time waiting for your turn. If you are used to turn base table top game like DND heres some insight. Most of the  fighting involves around 15-20 mobs each time each critters moves around... one at a time and if you use the environnement most of the time you will block some path and they will just move around back and forth.. Its a major inconvenient ... the development team had really nice ideas of dynamic and unique fights that are really awesome, but most of the time even nice creative challenge will bore you because of the heavy and painful waiting turn... if only mobs could play all at once it would have been easier to bear.

It's a turn-based, hex-based, combat-oriented game that presents some of the most wickedly challenging combat scenarios I have had to face in a turn-based game.  The developers have made excellent use of the environment, using traps, environmental effects, hindering terrain, and interactive objects integral to most combats.  This, combined with a wide array of special abilities available through warrior training or spell effects, makes combat very dynamic and challenging.  It can also be very frustrating.  On the plus side, when you lose a tough battle, there is an option to replay the battle from the beginning of the battle, as well as from your last save, so you need not redo extensive amounts of replay to ""get to the good stuff.""

There are four character generation options for this game, three basic with pre-builds of a melee warrior, a hunter archer, and a mage, and fourth option to custom build a character from scratch.  I have tried all four, but recommend trying building a character from scratch only after having tackled at least the first chapter of the game to get an idea of what the game is like.  I wanted to build an archer-mage, and found that it was easier (and you got better abilities) by starting as a straight mage and then investing experience points in archery talents and proficiencies to make up the difference.  

The NPCs in the game are fun and all dialogue is voiced.  The dwarven NPC (your first ally) has some really good lines.  The story is VERY linear, literally a ""go here and do this"" with arrows pointing your next route, which is nice in some ways and very frustrating in others. 

You get advancement points for every fight and story event, and you get a lot of them.  They accumulate quickly, but you need a ton to advance a stat or skill.  Stats, talents, weapon talents, and spells all rank from 1 to 18, with varying costs from 6 to over 480 to advance to the next level.   Experience comes in multiples of 25, depending on encounter difficulty, with more coming in the later stages of the game. Still, your Special Abilities are what makes your character be able to do extraordinary things like being able to regenerate Astral Points (mana) or Knockdown an opponent in combat.  These are relatively cheap to buy, at around 300 Advancement Points, but Special Abilities often have stat and weapon talent prerequisites that in turn cost advancement points to purchase, which all adds up to more advancement points....  I could not imagine playing ""The Dark Eye"" without a computer to aid me, especially as your Attack Value, Parry Value, Dodge Value, and Ranged Attack Value are all based on three stats added together and divided by five.  And that every roll in the game is a test against three ability scores.  All of this is handled by the computer and done very nicely in a battlelog that summarizes it in a percentage chance for you.  It can be a bit confusing when your 100% chance to hit misses, because evidently the computer rounds to the nearest %(?) but that's a quibble.  

In all this is an exceptionally fun game.  I keep telling myself I am tired of getting my ass handed to me by the game and will quit THIS TIME for sure, but in minutes I am back to beat the fight that got me.  It's so linear you can hear the train whistle when you play.  You will have your butt kicked routinely.  But if you like challenging turn-based combat and designing your own characters, you will likely love this game.",1397979812,1397980022,True,2,0,0.502360343933105469,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Legendado em portugues
-Customização do personagem
-Ambientação exelente
-Humor clássico da Daedelic

Pontos Contra:

-As decisoes são manipuladas e lineares. (Voce vê um prisioneiro em uma cela, o jogo te da 2 opcoes, Libertar, ou Ouvir o prisioneiro, mesmo se voce escolher ouvir o prisioneiro, voce terá que libertar o prisioneiro depois.)

- A inteligencia dos inimigos são um tanto quanto decepcionante, mesmo no modo Dificil, vc ve inimigos entrando em terrenos com armadilhas VISIVEIS, ou atacando o primeiro personagem que tiver pela frente mesmo com outro com a metade da vida no lado, faltou um poco de programação dos inimigos.

 - Pelo campo ser hexagonal faz o personagem ir por um caminho em zigue zague que faz ser quase impossivel despistar de algum perseguidor

- Os graficos são quadrados e pouco trabalhados, para um jogo de 2014. (Obs: conheço os jogos da daedelic e possuem esses graficos cartunestos e quadrados não reclamo disso, soh da falta de cuidado no acabamento na detalhação dos serrilhados, falto um anti-alissing melhor.) 

- Custo elevado, mesmo que seja um ótimo jogo com esse preço de R$ 75,00 Versão normal  e R$ 110,00 Versão Deluxe é muito caro para um jogo de midia digital.



Conclusão:

A historia, o ambiente e som fazem do jogo uma otima opcao pra quem quer um suspense com rpg-tatico, fora a moral que a daedelic ja tem desenvolvendo jogos  como Deponia ou Edina e harvey, pra quem é fan e quer ajudar a sua desenvolvedora vale a pena comprar, assim como pra quem quer um rpg tatico de alta qualidade também recomendo, para os entusiastas que começaram agora a jogar jogos  do genero tático recomendo esperar uma promoção da Steam e adquirir por R$ 35,00, por ser um jogo dificil, que pode frustar quem nao esta habituado a jogos do gênero.",1397921385,1397921385,True,48,0,0.812139332294464111,2,False,False,False,False,,,

   Я как заядлый геймер, с ужасно большим стажем ролевых игр, причем как компьютерных, так и настольных и даже постельных, могу сказать, что большего дисбаланса, скучности выбора тактик для ведения боя, классовых ограничений и недосказанности в этой самой боевой системе я не видел, а если и видел, то эти игры вызывали лишь ненависть и полёт дисков в помойное ведро, но Blackguards, игра лишь притворяющаяся ленивой, однообразной, проходной ерундой. И в тот момент, когда вы, вроде бы, уже готовы забросить её далеко и надолго, она приподносит вам очередной невероятный сюрприз.
   И так мне потребовалось около часа времени для подробного изучения правил боевой системы. Они сложны и строятся на d20 и d6 кубак, d - dice игральная кость, в которой число означает количество граней куба. Очень сильно радует что система не позволяет математических абсолютов, тоесть всегда есть шанс промаха, уворота, парирования, провала заклинания.
   Самым сложным и интересным является создание и развитие персонажа. Например магия делится на 4 вида, атакующая, усиливающая, вспомогательная (защитная), ослабляющая. В свою очередь при развитии каждое заклинание имеет 4 стадии. Стадии определяют область, силу, урон и так далее. Так же каждое заклинание имеет свой набор из 3ех характеристик влияющих на шанс срабатывания этих заклинаний, при этом это не всегда характеристики ментальные, есть заклинания от ловкости и телосложения, есть даже заклинания зависящие от силы. А например разные типы оружия обладают не только разными характеристиками, типо бонус атаки, парирования, инициативы, бывают кстати как + так и - в этих параметрах, не только разными типами урона влияющими на разную пробивную способность опять же разных типов доспехов, но и всякими параметрами досягаемости, бонуса урона от силы и невосприимчивости у разных типов монстров.
   Что касается ведения боя, тут всё восновном зависит от позиционного преимущества и правильного подбора действий. Например магом можно нанести неплохой урон, но в тоже время можно подождать с действием и в конце раунда подлечить (ну или воскресить) танка, в этой незатейливости и кроется вся сложность, порой из-за 1 неверного решения, весь бой идёт по наклонной в тартарары.
   Blackguards игра вызывающая невероятное количество эмоций в свой адрес, но безусловно являющая собой такой маленький мозолящий глаз шедевр, не поиграть в этот самый шедевр означает упустить массу негодования и удовольствия.

*Interesting system mechanics, with a LOT of depth to advancement.

Cons:
*Tutorial and Tips are useless.  I had been playing for over 2 hours (8+ combat missions) before I got a couple of the tips on how to do basic things.
*Horrible camera system.  Unable to rotate the camera, forcing you to revert to top down view in many areas just to be able to see the hex map behind objects/allies/enemies.
*No resource regeneration out of combat.  You can camp to restore Health and Astral points, which isn't bad, but when you hit one of the first major fight areas, you are prevented from camping.  You are forced to use town healers to restore HP out of combat, even if you have 2 mages with healing in your party.  No Astral Point (mana) regeneration outside of combat, even with talents that grant passive Astral Regen per turn, forcing you to use your very expensive Astral Potions to be able to actually use a mage character.
*Treating injuries with bandages has a chance to fail (very high chance) outside of combat, and almost useless to try in combat (6% chance of success at first rank).
*You are forced to buy belts to be able to carry many items into combat with you, but you are encumbered in combat by ALL the equipment in your bags, even you quest items and camping resources.
*Almost no income, with horribly high priced item.  At one point, you are given a large amount of money and told to go to the armorer to get equiped to help defend a town.  The armorer has 1 type of armor, 2 sets of it, and you are given enough to buy 1 piece of equipment.  Not a set, 1 piece.  You have to choose between upgrading a single piece of heavy armor, or to buy Astral and Health potions.
*Horrible UI.  Almost no explanations as to what means what, or as to how anything is calculated.  When comparing armor pieces, it does not compare piece to piece, only how it will change your whole, and armor/encumbrance always shows a penalty, even if it is an upgrade.
*Horrible combat encounter design.  In many of the fights, all of the mobs will sit back throwing poisoned javelines at you, each of which hits your heavily armored character for 15-30% of his total HP, and also poisons him.  Was forced to use the fighter as a tank, both of my mages as pure healers, while slowly grinding down the mobs hp with my archer (arrows cost a lot, and have weight.  I overmaxed my encumbrance just from provisions, which you need to camp, and arrows alone).
*Buff, healing and utility spells have default fail chance, which until you pick of a very very expensive talent, are almost impossible to cast (22% fail chance to heal an ally, 68% chance to fail to dispel a poison with a spell that only dispels poisons, 48% chance to fail to cast a ""wall"" spell, etc).  Combined with no innate astral regen, very low astral point pool and high astral point cost to cast makes playing a mage character feel like your being penalized for playing the game.",1397579225,1397579225,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ну и конечно обильное наличие интерактивных объектов: возможность выстроить оборонительную линию, уронив стопку ящиков (а если потом их еще и взорвать огненным шаром, мы получим очень эффективную огненную стену!); заранее, либо по ходу битвы установленные разного рода ловушки; особенности местности, как например воспламеняющиеся болотные пары либо затягивающая на несколько ходов тина. В общем, в плане боя вам скучать не придется, будет где попотеть над тактикой. 

Стоит отметить прокачку. Здесь нет левелапов, есть очки опыта, которые как на покупки в магазине, можно тратить на навыки, характеристики и способности, причем как прокачивая уже имеющиеся, там и узнавая новые у учителей, которые появляются в некоторых городах. Также стоит отметить, что здесь здоровье и мана не восстанавливаются сами, здоровье за копейки можно восстановить у лекарей в городе, а ману за 1 золотой, поспав в таверне.

Но теперь о приключенческой части. С первых минут бросается в глаза ее примитивность. У нас не будет возможности побродить по лесам и улицам городов, вместо этого нам предложат просто карту, где передвигаться мы будем по маркерам (как например быстрое путешествие в том же Скайриме). Города представляют из себя анимированную картинку, с кликабельными торговцами, кузнецами, трактирщиками и т.п. Есть еще зоны из нескольких подмаркеров на уже миникарте, например кладбище или поместье палача. Но, честно говоря, к этому примитиву быстро привыкаешь и он уже не так режет глаза.

И конечно пару слов о сюжете и РПГ-состовляющей. Вас сажают в тюрьму по обвинению в убийстве, но вы ничего не помните... все. Сюжет заключается в том, что вы совершаете побег и отправляетесь на поиски своего старого знакомого, чей образ вы помните последним. Сразу же, в тюрьме за вами увязывается каноничный воин-дворф и языкастый маг. Компаньоны ничего интересного из себя не представляют, как и РПГ-составляющая этой игры. Диалоги бедны, решения только из разряда убить/оставить в живых.

Не смотря на вышесказанное, игра затягивает хотя бы на одно прохождение точно, к покупке я игру рекомендую.

Not so bad you would think. Well this is where the problem is multiplied hugely. The point I am at in the game, for some unknown reason, is at the end of a series of very tedious battles. These do not allow you to save of even gather experience between them. So I have to go back beyond this point. Which is frankly killing any enjoyment I got from this game. 

Honestly this is a decent attempt at a turn based RPG. What lets it down is the total lack of freedom in your choices. No random battles means you have to know where to spend those skill points as you aren't getting any more from anywhere. Couple this with the fact that there is no real way of knowing what you need to spend them on till you have a go and this ruins what could have been fun.

战斗中各种技能的搭配设计的很好。右键出列表，简洁明了，还可以把常用技能拖到左上角用数字键直接释放。战斗中可以利用各种陷阱机关带有点解谜性质，这样让战斗多了一些趣味。后期有些战斗开始变得具有挑战性，可能有一些战斗中的随机事件会让战斗变得困难。

剧情刚玩了开头部分，感觉还是蛮不错的，最主要是转场自然，镜头合理，故事叙述不紧不慢。对白有语音，要是神界原罪对白也有语音就好了。

缺点：战斗比较固定，可探索性欠佳。对白选项没有太大意义，聊完就是聊完，不像神界原罪那样可以说不同的话来达到目的，甚至直接杀了npc来完成任务，你有创意怎么玩都行。这点有点可惜，本来解谜游戏工作室，至少在剧情设计上弄个多线路应该没问题的 ，可是他们只是把故事讲完了，就算功德圆满了。

总评：
 《黑色守卫》是一款以战斗为主，只有谈话选项而没有探索的游戏，所以几乎每次的谈话的结果都是回合制的战斗。但是游戏的战斗设计非常出色。战斗的节奏，远程近战魔法之间的平衡，关卡的设计都完美的相互结合。游戏在角色培养的部分稍显不足，但是除此以外，几乎游戏其他所有方面都很有趣。

虽然游戏以战斗为主，但是游戏最大的长处就是设定在了暗瞳世界，这是一个德国非常流行的RPG系统。这是一个次魔幻世界，其中的角色都不能算是拯救世界的大英雄，有时候甚至都算不上是英雄。但是这个设定对于游戏非常重要，因为这种类型的游戏并不单单取决于故事和游戏世界，同时还取决于设计和游戏机制。

但是，《黑色守卫》确实在表现上可以给玩家很多动力。对于战略RPG来说，游戏的节奏非常好。游戏的长度对于每个人都不同，但是基本上都会有20-30小时的游戏内容。游戏的画面非常清晰，艺术风格也同游戏的设定相辉映。同时游戏也提供试装的选项，让你可以看到装备和武器在你身上的样子。配音也良萎不齐，偶尔还会变得非常糟糕。

不幸的是，角色培养系统却同游戏其他部分格格不入。升级点数分配被5个角色信息页面分隔开。每个角色的升级时面对的都是一些令人迷惑的选择。而同时你经常会因为一些小错误而毁掉整个队伍。通常RPG中角色培养是最有趣的的部分，但是这款游戏的系统让角色培养变得令人难以满足和迷惑。",1397300070,1397306719,True,48,2,0.716394722461700439,9,True,False,False,False,,,

Das Spiel bietet nur verschwommene Grafik aber durchaus interessante Schlachtfelder mit teils nutzbaren Objekten. ABER das Ergebnis basiert praktisch komplett auf Glück. Ich mag Strategiespiele, auch wenn die Grafik eher mäßig oder gar schlecht ist, aber was ich absolut nicht ausstehen kann ist, wenn nicht Stratgie entscheidend für den Spielerfolg ist, sondern reiner Zufall. 

Man stelle sich vor, man startet mit einem Magier und benötigt 8 Fertigkeitspunkt in ""Feuerball"" nur um armseelige 47% Chance zu haben, dass der Spell überhaupt erfolgreich gezaubert wird. Wenn das Zaubern dann überhaupt klappt, kommt zusätzlich noch der übliche Zufallswert beim Schaden zum tragen. In der Praxis scheint die tatsächlich Erfolgchance noch niedriger zu sein. Das sieht dann so aus, dass man da 4-5 Runden rumsteht, und vergeblich versucht irgendwas zu zaubern, aber nichts passiert, während die Gegner natürlich weiter munter auf einen einschlagen. Auch 3 Fehlschläge in Folge bei 90% sind keine Seltenheit. Dann kommt noch dazu, dass manche Karten ein Zuglimit haben, z.B. 5 Züge um sich durch Feinde zum anderen Ende der Karte durchzukämpfen. Tja, wenn man dann 4 Züge lang nur das Schimpfen seines Chars hört statt eine Aktion zu sehen, ist es völlig egal welche strategische Idee man für das Level hatte, dann heißt es neuladen. Dazu kommt noch das manche Gegner magische Resistenzen haben, die nochmals bei vielen Spells von der Erfolgschance abgezogen werden, weshalb der Zauber dann nciht nur verminderten Effekt sondern halt gar keinen hat.  Gegen Blackguards wirkt ""Risiko!"" wie Schach. Wieder mal 20 Euro im Mülleimer vernsenkt. Der Vollpreis von 40 Euro wäre ohnehin geradezu lächerlich.


ENGLISH:

Blurry grafics, yet interessting battle fields BUT results depend mostly on LUCK. I like stratic games, even if the grafics is not so good but what I totally hate is when not strategy decides battles but pure random damage results. Imagine you have a mage, you need to put 8 skill points into fireball just to have like 47% to even successfully cast it. That's against a cheap enemy who has no resistances, many spells subtract resists additionally from cast success. If the fireball has been casted it does random damage too. Now having a somewhat random damage with attacks is usual but image you cast a spell in it fails 4-5 times in a row. That means you stand there without doing any damage at all for 4 rounds. There are maps which have a turnlimt, like ""kill enemies in 5 rounds"". Now if your casts just fail, you are screwed and can reload. How the heck is this strategy?!

Short version:

Blackguards is a tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg.  The story is very funny at times and quite dark throughout.  You have quite a bit of freedom in regards to how to train your party, what equipment, skills and abilities each person should have.  You are on a linear path, but there is freedom in that as well.  There is, of course, the main quest line to advance the story, (which I find rather entertaining, it's funny, but also dark) and there are several side quests that you CAN do, or miss.  (I missed a few)  There are some things I don't like, (RNG makes things rough and a few multiple battles means one bad decision early can be terrible for you) but overall those can be overcome and dealt with.  I recommend saving often, as I SHOULD have been doing all along.  Still, I think this is by far one of the best games in the tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg games I've played in a long time.  I really don't understand all the negativity towards the game.  :(

The Long Version:


Blackguards is a tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg.  The story is very funny at times and quite dark throughout. :)

The Good:

The pacing of the game is fun and very enjoyable and this IS one of the longer games of it's type that I've played in recent memory.  The fact that there's more to the battles than just your attacks/skills/spells abilities is a very refreshing change. 

Now, I love X-COM and I know this game catches some comparison to it, but even in the different missions in X-COM you pretty much just killed all the aliens.  There's different objectives in battle as well as usable/destroyable terrain.  Sometimes you might have to rush across a bridge to save someone within ""x"" number of turns.  Maybe you are escaping from prison and you can fight the guards, or free other prisoners to fight them off for you.  There's usually several ways to achieve the goal and they add enough different things to keep you guessing AND make it entertaining.    

You are part of a story. so the linear gameplay makes sense.  There are flashbacks and you learn pretty quickly what all is going on, well for the most part.  There's still a lot you need to discover, but the story is well written even if it's a bit cheesey at times and overly dark at others.  The voice acting is quite a bit better than I would have expected.  I personally think they did an exceptional job in this department.  The music and graphics are also very well done.

The different characters you can pick up for your party all play pretty differently.  The nice thing is you DO have a say in all of their training/gear/abilities after what they have initially.  A mage plays very different from a warrior, who plays very different from an archer.  One of the things I did was had a third mage like character and transitioned her into an archer as I lost my archer a bit earlier on.  So she can use a bow decently well and has spells to fall back on.  

I think 90% of the battles are pretty balanced, but every so often you get a battle that just makes you think and rethink your strategy 100 times over before you get it.  

The game is unique, I haven't seen anything quite like this before.  The concept isn't so different from a lot of other games, but the setting, the story, even just the idea of having a group of misfits, criminals, drug-addicts as the ""heroes""
is fairly different from the norm.

I could go on and on about the ""good"" of the game, but I want to address the few issues that I have come across that you may want to know about.  It's a very good game, but nothing is perfect.  :)

The Bad : (or Frustrating if you will)

The RNG can be exceptionally frustrating at times and bad decisions can bring you to a screeching halt.  I don't recommend ""save scumming"" but I DO recommend saving often, as there are many multiple battles with no way to back out.  There were a few times that I ran into a battle that I made a bad decision in the fight before it and it cost me quite a few stressful attempts to survive.  I have also fought a few battles without really changing my tactics and only managed to win because RNG (Randon Number Generations, i.e. Luck) was in my favor.  One fight in particular that I fought 4 times or more, I did MINOR changes but it really came down to my person not missing as much.  In all  honesty, this is really the only BAD thing.  Now, if I had chosen a different team setup in the previous fight, it probably would have been easier. 

Some of the other ""Bad"" things in the game would be more about personal preferences.  I personally play both open world games as well as linear.  Some people hate linear games.  I don't mind it as I find the story is usually tighter, better told and more memorable in the linear games.  You have less ""distractions"".  You have a main quest line you have to follow and it advances the story.  You can't do stuff from chapter 5 in chapter 1.  There are several side quests however and you can do those whenever you feel like each chapter.  I skipped a few or missed a few in chapter 1 as I wasn't 100% sure which was which.  There's no free-roaming, it's towns, points of interests, people of interests that you click on a map and throughout the cities.    So it's the world map, town maps, area maps, or the battle map you deal with.  Again, I don't mind it, but some people will.

You have only 3 choices for your main character.  Archer, Warrior, Mage (not sure what ""specific"" names they give those classes).  However, you have a lot of freedom on how you want to train your character and the members of your party.  The game slowly teaches you how to play, so it may start a bit slow with all the tutorial messages popping up, but the tutorial DOES do a good job at teaching you what you need to know.  

Occasionally the camera angles can be a bit annoying or cumbersome, but it's not much of an issue overall.

It might seem like there's a lot bad here, but in reality it's just a lot of detail.  Most of which is personal preference or it limits you....only a little, but again, some people hate any limitations.  

Bottom Line:

The game is very fun, and makes you think.  You will breeze through some fights and then just hang your head in shame in others.  You have a set path to follow, but you can take several side streets along the way and the ride is very enjoyable.  I really really like Blackguards and I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Tactical, squad-based, turn-based strategy rpg games.  It has a few problems, but the good outweighs the bad by a landslide.  This is a shining gem from Daedalic Entertainment, well....a Darkly Shining Gem!

1. Ignore Daedalic fanboys who praise and defend their every game with religious zeal.
2. This is not a good game, not worth 40€ at all.
3. Since I was a little boy, I have played A LOT of turn-based games (from Jagged Alliance, Silent Storm, Heores, Disciples, Age of Wonders to the newer titles like Frozen Synapse, Xcom, Expeditions Conquistadors and more) and they are probably my favourite genre.

Oh boy, where to start? On paper this game looks fantastic and fools you into thinking that you are in for a exciting experience. You are not. Every aspect of this game is lackadaisical, poorly executed and underdeveloped. Let's take a look at each component of Blackguards:

Character creation:
You create your character from three available classes: warrior, ranger and mage. However, classes don't determine anything as you can specialise in anything you want. I choose to be a dual-wielding fighter who helps with buffs and some offensive spells. I quickly abandoned that idea, because the game heavily favors archers and maybe heavy-hitting warriors. Not really adequate for an RPG, is it? The battles became impossible and I was literally forced to respec and become an archer. Also, certain skills are a must, other are a bust.
The world:
On your quest you travel across the land, visit different cities. Each city/town is represented by an image on which points of intrests are clickable (tavern, blacksmith, healer). Those town screens are pretty but mostly unremarkable and you only visit them on some of many, MANY fetch quests. In fact, everything in this game is point and click (like in adventure games), which creates a very static feel.
The universe itself will be familiar to players that have played other Daedalic games (Chains of Satinav, Memoria etc) - the Dark Eye universe. As with many other games by this developer, there are references to the their previous entries here and there and you may encounter characters that appeared somewhere else (ie a certain NPC from Chains of Satinav can be found in Blackguards). It's definitely a nice touch.
Your party:
Before the game was released, there was a lot of hype concering your party - a bunch of outlaws and criminals. Ugh, not really. Playing Baldur's Gate 2 and taking Viconia, Edwin and Korgan is waaaay more badass. You never get the feeling that they are really on the run, criminals with disgusting past. No, nothing like that. Half of your party (which is fixed, you can't choose between a bunch of characters) is bland (main character included), the other half is fleshed out, but not spectacular.
Dialogues:
The dialogues in Blackguards serve one purpose only - to push the story forward (or give you fetch quests). As a player, you just click every option of the dialogue (not a lot of them) and very rarely can choose between different answers. Voice acting is hit or miss. Dialogues are done through the dialogue boxes and again, they feel extremely static.
Story:
As for the story, it is indeed intriguing. Side quests are a grind - you just run errands and they always end up with a fight. Main story is what drives you forward. The ending may be a bit underwhelming but I won't spoil anything.
Items, loot:
Forget it. Basic weapons and every once in a while their magical variations, which are still unremarkable and differ only slightly from the ordinary equipment. 
Combat:
Ah, Blackguards is supposed to feature a deep, dynamic turn-based combat. Well, I can tell you it is turn-based. It's nowhere near 'deep' nor 'dynamic'. Out of advertised 40 abilities I used maybe 5 throughout the entire game. Out of 90 spells (wait, what? where?) I used 10 at best. The combat just fails to be exciting or rewarding, despite the environment interaction which becomes repetitive and not worth the trouble. The saving grace here is that each battlefield is special - you will not find two the same, reused battlemaps and that's a treat. The challenge (beware of sudden and unexpected difficulty spikes) comes not from tough opponents but from a vast array of cheap shots and irritating design choices the developers throw at you when it's time to ramp up the difficulty. Examples: you fight a giant lily and a wood troll. Giant lily takes control over your character and draws him into the water where several tentacles (they come out of nowhere) rip him to shreds in a matter of few turns. Now, giant lily grows in the water - if you want to approach it with you fighters and beat it to death, forget it. The tetnacles will block your way and pound you. So you figure to stay on land, as it's a viable option to defeat the lily. You use your archers (did I tell you the game favors archers?) and have 60% to hit the lily. Out of 16 shot, 4 connected. I counted. Some of the hits do no damage (don't know why, it's random). Magic should work, but usually does no or very little damage. Sounds fun? Well, don' forget about the wood troll knocking your guys down every turn. Yay.
Another example. You have to hold on and kill 27 zombies that just keep spawning. You try to hit a zombie, have 75% chance to hit and surprise, surprise you miss 4 of your 5 blows (then you read 'Zombie dodges the shot masterly'). Then you hit the damn thing with magical short swords and do 3 damage. Zombie retailiates and does 14 damage with his bare hands. Logic anyone? Whatever. Bottom line is - combat is rarely interesting, mostly infuriating and frustraing. And this is supposed to be the main point of the game... Ah yes, there are also stealth maps, but they are flat out awkward.
Graphics:
The town screens are indeed a joy to look and the world map is arfully drawn. Other than that, the graphics is mediocre and so are the animations. Whan characters speak their jaws are flapping unnatrually, but you won't see that other than in cutscenes.
Music:
Ah, yes. Apart from the story, the only strong point of Blackguards. The music always accompany you and creates a curious mood as you progress through the story. It's always in the background, never imposes itself, and yet you remember the motifs and find yourself humming the melodies.
Immersion:
Unfortuantely, I was never immersed. I blame the overall static feel of the game, the point and click nature of it. There is no fluidity, as the game is chopped by frequent loading screens as you jump between towns. The lack of environments to explore (I'm not expecting Skyrim here, just your ordinary Icewind Dale locations), lack of movement is what absolutely kills this game. Maybe it would be salvagable if the conversations where meaty and interesting, but the interactions between characters are limited to few lines.

Bottom line:
Do not buy this game unless you are absolutely desperate for a turn-based combat game set in a fantasy world. It's annoying and frustrating. Tell you what. Save your money and buy Divinity Original Sin instead. Or go play Jagged Alliance. Blackguards is a waste of your time and money.

Das Fertigkeiten- und Talentesystem ist gut portiert worden ohne jemanden zu überfordern der die Regeln der Vorlage nicht kennt. D.h. es sind nicht alle Skills des Pen&Paper vorhanden, was aber auch völlig unnötig wäre und das Spiel nur Überladen wirken lassen würde.

In this game you will be taking on the role of a commoner who is friends with those in high places, especially a princess, but wait, what was that? Oh no the princess has been killed, and you are having the finger pointed at you. This is where the true story begins, and where you will met the first of your companions that will help you through the game with either their strength or their magical abilities.

Graphically this game has a couple of small hiccups from time to time, but the overall game gives you the feel of a dark and desolate world that is clinging to the world of old gods. Even though you don't get to actually walk through the towns, you are given 3D scenes that you can click on the action icons to interact with, they all have depth and personality. Another thing is that there is a lot of different models used when it comes to interacting with towns, you are not going to see a lot of repeats, though to be fair its not like any of the towns are overflowing with people. Now as far as the combat graphics are concerned you are placed in a 3D hex-based grid system in which you will be moving from 3/4s side view to top down view so that you can see the whole field and make sure you're not missing anything such as traps or enemies that could be hiding behind walls, plants, etc. I do like the fact that at the bottom of the screen, since this is turn based, that there are images of the enemies, and they have about 3 to 4 stock images so that the enemies have a little bit of variety to them. Sure the models all look the same with the exception of if the enemy is a specific class or sex.

The music in the game was very well made, and there were quite a few haunting tunes that as soon as they start I immediately think about the game. The voice acting for the most part was solid as well, there were a couple of over the top performances, but sometimes that's going to happen when try too hard to capture a specific type of character.

The controls in the game are pretty straight forward. You are going to use the mouse coupled with WASD for most everything while moving around a map, or on the battlefield. You will of course be using the usual 'i' for inventory and 'c' for character sheet.

So this game is pretty deep when it comes to all the little tweaks you can make to your character. There is a good number of spells to cast, there is weapon proficiency to think about, active and passive skills to learn, traits to learn, and of course stats to increase. I have to say that this was always a daunting task for me, but for the most part, once I really got into the game, I had the feel for what was really important for my party to not only survive, but to succeed. You'll also be given weapons, armor, and items galore that you will have to learn to balance. I found out the hard way that putting items or equipment on your characters does not take away much if any of the load in your inventory. So when I had my party fully decked out I almost had no room for much else, unless of course I wanted to play encumbered. That being said it didn't created THAT big of an annoyance.

You of course have your own main quest, starting off with you trying to figure out what is really going on, and then of course the twists happen and all hell possibly breaks loose. The thing is that there are a ton of side quests to keep your eyes out for. Now I will say this, until the very end of the game you might lose access to some quests, but have no fear you will regain it later on in the game. There's also many quests that you might miss out on if you don't periodically check in on all the cities. Yes, I understand that that means that you will be dealing with a ton of load screens, but none of them are really unbearable, and when you get to the end of the game, you will thank me for making you search for extra quests.

I'm going to be totally honest with you, it took a couple of attempts for me to get into this game, but once I was invested in the game I couldn't stop. I wanted to see what was behind the next bend in the road, what enemies would stand in my way, and of course it stood out to me because I've always loved pencil and paper RPGs, and this felt like a pretty good transition from sitting around a round table with friends and experiencing and adventure. So in the end I have to say that through it all I have to give this game an 8.9 out of 10.",1395759148,1395759148,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Я б назвав її деякою сумішшю ігор типу Heroes: Maght and Magic та Dragon Age (там, де можна ""зупиняти час"")
Ця покрокова гра буде увесь час ставити вас у незручні становища. Якщо, наприклад, ви звикнете розставляети своїх персонажів у захисну позицію, звикли до певного строю, то ця гра може зненацька поставити вас у скрутне становище! Можуть бути умови типу ""Врятуй персонажа за 5 ходів"", ""Зруйнуй пристрій в протележній частині мапи"", чи просто ""Переберіться з пункту А до Б"", і доведеться гасати по всій локації) Я вже й не кажу про пастки, перешкоди, рухомі об'єкти... тут є простір для різноманітних шляхів вирішення поставленної задачі.

Окремим пунктом можно виділити й широку варіативність побудови ваших героїв: різноманітні навички, зброя, спорядження... гра дає достатні можливості для створення цікавих комбінацій та власної тактики.

Сюжет тут... досить незрозумілий. Нажаль я не пройшов гру до кінця (обов'язково пройду!), так як на мій погляд дуже затягнута. За весь час, що я награв, я не пам'ятаю якикось помітних рухів у сюжеті. Тому можу ствердити, що гра більш за все концентрує увагу на битвах та невеликих додаткових історіях, діалогах, які зустрічаються вздовж ваших пригод (деякі з яких мають відношення до головного сюжету і дають нову інформацію).

Деякі рівні для мене були пекельно складними і доволі часто доводилося вклонятися Богу Рандома, аби він змилувався і у мене все вийшло в вирішальних діях. В цій грі рандом (випадковість) грає дуже, дуже велику роль! Дуже часто трапляється, що не виходить начаклувати якогось фаєр-бола і вам доводиться одразу перебудовувати свої плани! (звичайно ж, імовірність залежить від того, наскільки розвинута навичка, яку використовуєш).

С початку гри ви можете вибрати Важкий рівень складності. Якщо ви бажаєте, щоб ваші справи від битви до битви були кепськими, як у меня, рекомендую обирати саме цей рівень :)

[b]Висновок:[/b] Гра вийшла дійсно хорошою. Так, вона не усім буде довподоби. Як на мене, трохи затягнута.

This has got to be one of the hardest RPG's I have played since Pool of Radiance, and I'm tempted to place Blackguards higher in that category just because I know very little about The Dark Eye rules, or at least much less than D&D. And it is great because of it.

Graphics are wonderful. They won't blow you away but are for the most part hand drawn and look phenominal. Musical score is excellent. (Really wish I had gotten the SE for the bonuses) The story seems well written, however I have not gotten very far to give a decent opinion about it.

The combat may turn some people away as it can be very difficult at times (and since it relies on dice rolls it can be quite rage inducing) but if you show determination (there is no shame in saving and walking away for a bit, might save a monitor and keyboard or 2) the combat is extremely rewarding.

If you like The Dark Eye world, or am just a fan of strategey based RPG's, take a long look at this game. Just don't forget to spend time reading details about every skill and stat before you use your AP (like XP) on them, because it can be really easy to screw up a build.",1395636162,1395636162,True,3,1,0.532062351703643799,0,True,False,False,False,,,

마을과 지도에서는 마우스 클릭으로만 진행하다가 전투는 히마매 같이 한다
원작이 있기 때문에 배경은 꽤 탄탄하고 스토리도 상당히 흥미롭다, 드래곤 에이지와 꽤 흡사한 느낌

사실 전반적인 전투 시스템을 보면 꽤 괜찮다 주변환경과 상호작용도 꽤 있고 커버시스템 같은 경우도 꽤 잘되있다

하지만 이 모든게 별로 의미가 없는게 전투의 승패는 운이 거의 좌지우지한다
물론 미스라는 개념이 이상한건 아니지만 이 게임은 빗맞을 확률 너무 심하다
케릭터 창을 보면 적중률을 높이고 회피율을 낮추거나 적중률을 낮추고 회피율을 높이는 옵션이 있는데, 이 옵션에서 적중률을 최대치로 올려놔도 체감 적중률은 50퍼 정도 밖에 안된다
게다가 적중/회피에만 운이 작용하는게 아니라 상태효과 같은 것들에도 전부 운이 작용한다
때문에 전투를 전략적으로 하려고 생각하고 생각해서 케릭터들을 배치하고 싸워도 운이 나쁘면 그냥 질수 밖에 없고 운이 좋으면 이긴다

Świetny system walki turowej na mapie heksoidalnej, charyzmatyczni bohaterzy, wciągający mroczny świat gry - to tylko niektóre zalety tej mega produkcji! Z początku gra powoli się rozwija, ale jak tylko dojdziemy do pewnego etapu (nie będe zdradzał, którego), to wówczas otrzymujemy jeszcze ciekawszą produkcję.  Szczerze mówąc pierwsze 2-3 godziny grania jest takim wstepem w formie Samouczka. 

W BlackGuards rozwijamy nasze postacie, zdobywamy punkty doświadczenia i rozdzielamy je w drzewkach umiejętności. Wykonujemy misje poboczne i oczywiście główne (by pchnąć główny wątek fabularny). Kupujemy / sprzedajemy przedmioty, zwiedzamy miasta i rozmawiamy z ich mieszkańcami. Oj wiele by tu wymieniać :).  

Największym atutem gry są same walki, które odbywają się w turach. Fani King Bounty będą wniebowzięci, ponieważ walki są wymagające i niekiedy mocno się namęczymy aby zwyciężyć dany pojedynek. 

Jednym z niewielu minusów gry są przerywniki filmowe. Są one zrobione na siłę. Mogliby zrobić lepiej jakieś filmiki obrazkowe w formie komiksu czy coś innego.

Il n'est absolument pas nécessaire de connaitre l'univers de The Dark Eye et ne donne pas non plus envie de s'y plonger. Pari perdu à ce niveau là. L'univers du jeu est, à mon goût, trop classique pour vouloir prolonger l'expérience sur d'autres supports. En tant que tel, le jeu est réussi malgré quelques soucis techniques dont je n'ai pas trop tenu compte. L'expérience est intéressante avec un scénario qui décole un peu tardivement. La gestion des persos et les combats pourront servir d'exemple pour de futurs jeu.
En définitive, je vous conseille ce jeu si vous êtes amateurs de tactical même si le prix me semble excessif (40€ à ce jour...).

Shame because the looks and ui and the feel of it all is topnotch.

The problem lays in the balance, there is no way to go around and level up and get better gear, except to do the linear preset battles, terrible design. BUT the real problem lays in the fact that you are too weak, cant afford the items they have for sale etc, close to starting you will find yourself against lots of Lice , just one can take you out, but you deal best around 10damage, so do they, but there are lots of them, you can take a couple down but thats it, and that is on easy mode.

The game is really hard even on easy mode, a good game wasted, i feel like shooting the brainless devs.

Do not bother, if you do dont say you was not warned. Check the forum first for a true insight.

Avoid this one and the devs no nothing about balance etc.

Overal Blackguards is an extremely fun game but it has one big flaw. 

First the positive points: 
The strategic turn-based hex battles are great, I'm happy that finally game developers are taking this up again instead of all that RTS nonsense. The combat system with different moves goes smoothly, also the interface using a radial menu is OK. It does take a while getting used to.
Nice character development using a skill/talent system which is unconventional. This feels fresh and is an interesting change compared to other typical RPG's.
The voice acting is great and really adds to the immersion, also the characters themselves are well fleshed out and the interaction between them is hilareous at times (which is positive i.e. there is a lot of humor in the game).
There are many different (side-)quests, lots of items to find and experiment with etc.
The story itself is interesting and while the game is very linear it doesn't come as a hindrance. This also is a nice change of pace compared to other games recently where everything has to be 'open'.

Now to the one flaw which at times totally screws up the game: 'nonsense' battles ...
Each time I play, the battles are sometimes challenging, sometimes easy but overal quite fun. However, when you reach the pinnacle of that fun and are really enjoying the game ... the devs throw in what I call 'nonsense' battles which totally kill the mood and make you want to remove the game from the harddrive.

These 'nonsense' battles for example require you to rescue someone in 6 turns. The first say two attempts it won't work since you have to figure out what is needed, the next couple of attempts you run into traps (you can't detect them since there is no time in 6 turns). So in the end you have to constantly reload and reload and reload. Try a fireball on the first turn, if it fails, reload since no miss can be afforded. The game in such battles also feels as if the 'to hit' percentages are inversed. For example a 'to hit' percentage of 95% in these battles feels as if it's 5% since suddenly everything misses (so reload and reload and reload). It thus has nothing to do with strategy anymore but purely boils down to finding that one single path which 'could' lead to victory and then pray that your attacks actually succeed.

The above is really sad since it totally spoils the mood. After completing such a 'nonsense' battle (which is really a waste of time) the game is again great and fun until you again reach a point where they decided to dump such a miscreation.
It feels as if the game was designed by two different people. One person designed 85% of the game which is great and 15% was designed by someone who's only goal was 'How can I annoy the player the most?"".

The game also has some minor issues like incorrect voices in cutscenes or a slight stutter when using certail skills (hammer blow) etc but nothing game breaking. I didn't have any crash or anything, overal it runs smooth.

In total it took me 47 hrs to complete it on medium.  Considering the fact that it has some interesting replay value (different starting class, different spells, ....) the game delivers quite some content.

So, in summary, it's a great game if you're into turn-based combat and will give you a lot of fun and funny moments, but beware the 'nonsense' battles since they can make you switch to a different game in a blink. When looking at the whole package the 85% definitely outweighs the 15% so I recommend it.",1394280717,1395779600,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Виной тому не плохое отношение к Blackguards. Даже наоборот! Daedalic смогли-такие наконец сделать не очередной квест, а использовали возможность раскуривать тему сеттинга и настольной ролевой игры Dark Eye по полной программе. И перед нами явился мрачный готикоподобный сеттинг в довольно инновационной обертке. По сути игра делится на две части: чтение диалогов и тактические битвы. И при этом в игре конкретно есть чем заняться, есть и побочные квесты, и интригующая история.

Игра выпускалась через ранний доступ в Стиме. Решение было хорошим, шаг был верным, игра действительно годная (правда цена кажется завышенной), особенно учитывая, что ее делала очень небольшая инди-контора.

И при этом всем, спустя 8 часов игры, в начале 2 (из 5) главы я столкнулся с таким багом, что прохождение не является возможным: мой герой просто перестал биться, а его ходы заканчивались автоматически. И так стало происходить вообще во всех боях, превращая их из сложных в невыносимо сложные. Да и вообще, что за дела, когда герой не действует. Он же главный герой. Хотя персонажи тут очень хорошие и яркие (как свои, так и враги).

Посему очень надеюсь, что вам понравится и багов у вас не будет.

Es beginnt mit der Charaktererschaffung, wo ich alle Vorrausetzungen für ein Kampftalent erfülle aber nicht kaufen kann. Was mich besonders daran stört ist das ich ja woanders bewusst ein Nachteil in kauf nehme um das zu erfüllen aber das Spiel gibt es nicht her.

Als zweites gleich nach der Charaktererschaffung, wenn ich mir Items ausgesucht hatte sind die verschwunden und kann mit meinem Charakter eine ganze weile nicht spielen, außer ich schlage mit meinen Fäusten zu bis ich die Items kaufen kann die ich für meinem Charakter brauche, es sei denn ich gebe EPs für Waffenfertigkeiten aus die ich eigentlich nicht spielen wollte. Im Detail heißt das bei mir z.B. das ich einen Charakter mit Degen und Wurfwaffenfertigkeiten erstellt habe und ihn am Anfang nicht spielen konnte weil keine Items für Ihn kaufen konnte und Ihn im Grunde Umskillen muss damit ich mitkämpfen kann.

Wenn man die Hilfe für das Spiel anlässt erfährt man das man die Umgebung nutzen kann für bestimmte Situationen was an sich ein sehr guter Gedanke ist, aber wenn man nicht erfährt ob man etwas nutzen kann in dem man z. B. mit dem Mauszeiger über einen Gestand oder auch Gelände geht und keine Informationen bekommt, es sei denn man steht direkt daneben und klickt auf benutzen was natürlich nicht immer geht und man seine Bewegung in die Richtung umsonst ausgegben hat ist schon echt frustrierend besonders weil ich nicht jedes mal von vorne anfangen möchte!

Außerdem kann man nur bei bestimmten leuten seine Fertigkeiten verbessern, wobei die Auswahl mal wieder begrenzt ist selbst wenn man wieder Anforderungen erfüllt das gleichzeitg für das Spiel bedeutet das man nie in einem bestimmten Skill, wenn man es möchte dem Gegner überlegen ist sondern das es sich die Balance hält was im Grunde heißt egal was du spielst oder wie ist vollkommen egal, denn wenn man sich eine strategie zurecht legt kommt man überall durch und der charakter ist nur nebensache.

Jetzt kommen noch die Begleiter die ich leider nicht los werde selbst wenn ich es möchte und sogar im Spiel immer mehr dazu kommen.

You assume the role of your own custom character who is accused of killing the princess in the opening cinematic. Your only choice is to run away, assemble a cast of shady characters such as the suave mage Zurbaran, the feisty dwarf Naurim and the tribal warrior Takate. The storytelling and the characters are solid, but they really don’t stand out in any significant way, for the most part it really feels like a poor man’s BioWare story.

What makes Blackguards truly shine are its great combat system and wonderful game world. The combat system is hex based and may at first remind you of fantasy turn-based strategy games such as Heroes of Might and Magic or King’s Bounty. In reality, it’s more like a combination of Disciples III and Neverwinter Nights, a heavy mixture of classic turn-based strategy and role-playing philosophy. The fantastic thing about the combat system is that every single battlefield is completely unique. Not only are they all different from a visual standpoint, but they are all set up differently as well. Sometimes you’re surrounded, sometimes you have multiple goals, sometimes you have to defend something. You can also use the environment to your advantage. Cut the rope to make the heavy wooden chandelier fall on your foes or burn down the walkway spiderwebs causing deadly poisonous spiders fall to their doom.

Another big thing different from usual turn-based strategy games is that you’re not building an army, you have a party of up to five characters. As you progress through the game, you acquire adventure points which you can use to upgrade your characters in a wide variety of attributes, abilities, spells, talents and weapon talents. It’s a really robust system that allows for truly deep customization and experimentation. The only negative thing is that the game assumes that you’re familiar with The Dark Eye ruleset when in reality you will need some time to really figure it out.

The other problem stemming from the use of The Dark Eye ruleset is that almost any attack can be a hit or miss. Because the game is really tough and the opening battles are rather grueling, it can be really frustrating missing a 95% attack. There are ways to upgrade your characters to offset this, but again, this will take some time to figure out as the game doesn’t really explain much of anything. This can cause some really ugly bouts of frustration and anger, but it’s not a deal breaker.

The vast majority of the gameplay is in the battles. Apart from that, you’ll be using a lovely 2D map to travel from location to location. Towns are represented with a single screen depicting various points of interest such as shops, healers, blacksmiths and quests. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the wonderful art style is sort of a mixture between fantasy, medieval Spain and 16th century Caribbean which is actually seldom seen in games. The accompanying soundtrack reflects that as well and fits the game very well. However, the animations aren’t that great and the voice work, while mostly solid, can be a bit cringe-worthy at times.

Blackguards is a hardcore game for hardcore gamers and it is completely unapologetic about it. So be prepared for some truly grueling stuff and a steep learning curve. The great thing is, it’s absolutely worth playing thanks to the great combat system, deep RPG elements and a wonderful game world.

So, nach 40 Stunden Spielzeit (mehrere Chars, Schwierigkeitsgrad: Normal, Expertenmodus, bis fast Ende 3. Kapitel) konnte ich mir mMn einen guten Einblick ins Spiel machen. Und ich muss leider sagen, dass ich es so wie es ist nicht empfehlen würde. Warum?
Ich gehöre zu den EA Käufern dieses Spiels, weil ich mich sehr darauf gefreut habe. Aus Zeitgründen konnte ich das Spiel aber erst nach Release spielen, Glück im Unglück.

Ich vermute mal alle, die hier die Reviews lesen haben sich etwas über das Spiel informiert bzw. wissen über das Genre etwas Bescheid, aber dennoch sei hier nochmals gesagt, dass man mit einer Gruppe ""Helden"" in schöner DSA-RPG Manier durch die Gegend zieht und sich (eigentlich) freut seine Helden weiter auszubilden...eigentlich.

Erst einmal kurz zu den positiven Punkten, leider wirklich nur kurz. Die Intromusik ist wunderbar, die Karten-Schlachtfelder sind schön gezeichnet bzw. schöne Locations, die Zauber auf dem Schlachtfeld sehen gut aus, einige Sprecher und Sprüche der Charaktere sind einfach klasse(!).
Das war es dann aber auch.

Die Musik ist auf Dauer unerträglich monoton und nervig, aber das ist ja sehr geschmacksabhängig, ich habe recht schnell die Musik abgeschaltet, weil sie mich irre machte...

Die Grafik und Animation der Charaktere außerhalb der Schlachtfelder ist...zweckmäßig... Zeichnungen wären schöner gewesen bzw. hätte keinen gestört.

Nun zum eigentlichen Problem des Spiels, aus meiner Sicht.
Das Spiel ist sehr, sehr oft unfair und nicht mal ansatzweise nachvollziehbar. Durch eine vielzahl von Talenten, Zaubern, Waffenfertigkeiten, Sonderfertigkeiten etc., welche man alle ""skillen"" kann suggeriert einem das Spiel, dass man viel lernen kann, sich bzw. seine Charaktere individualisieren kann um Abenteuer zu bestehen. Auch werden einem immer schön prozentuale Erfolgschancen angezeigt..welche sich schlussletztendlich als vollkommen egal und überflüssig erweisen. 

Eine Individualisierung oder breitere Auffächerung von vielen Talenten und Fertigkeiten ist absolut tödlich und frustrierend. Bei den Waffen lohnt es sich eigentlich nur Hiebwaffen(1H/2H) zu lernen (bzw, je nach Held einen Schadenszauber oder ""OP"" Fernkampf), gegen Stichwaffen sind alle und jeder ""immun"", übertrieben gesagt: einen dicken Ent bekomm ich mit der flachen Hand klein, aber nicht mit dem bis zum Ende geskillten Zweihänder...

Immunitäten/Widerstände der Gegner sind eh sehr erstaunlich. Komischerweise wird einem gesagt, dass mein Feuerstrahl eine Wahrscheinlichkeit von 98% hat, aber wenn man bei 5-6 von 10 Mal Wirken von Feuerstrahl den Zauber verpatzt wird es frustrierend, weil nicht nachvollziehbar. Auf alle Zauber mit unter 70% Chance sollte man eh verzichten und sich die Astralenergie sparen...
Das ist die große Krux, überall werden einem Trefferwahrscheinlichkeiten oder Prozentzahlen etc. angezeigt. leider ist nicht wirklich nachvollziehbar worauf diese sich dann beziehen. Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeiten bzw. Trefferchance verblassen im Programmcode und es gibt den nicht angezeigten  Widerstands-Algorithmus PRO Gegner..so scheint es zumindest.

Ich habe versucht einen Helden gleich zu Anfang und im frühen Spielverlauf mit 1H Hiebwaffen auf 18 (Max) zu bringen, das hat auch geklappt, aber ich treffe angeblich ziemlich oft und mache gut Schaden, theoretisch. Aber anscheinend passen sich die ""LowLvL"" Gegner darauf an, ich verhaue einen Schlag nach dem Anderen, es wird ständig ausgewichen. Angezeigt wird aber das ich voll der 1H Hiebwafffen Superheld wäre..

Auch hier ein Problem, wie ich finde, man muss sich extrem spezialisieren: eine Waffe (Hieb), zwei bis drei Zauber, der Rest klappt eh nicht weil die Erfolgschancen noch geringer sind als so schon. Wenn aber ein Spezialist tot/gelähmt/übernommen worden ist...kann man den Kampf eigentlich von vorne beginnen, und auch das hat nichts mit Taktik und Strategie zu tun, wenn die Gegner erstaunlicherweise meine hochgelernte Magieresistenz umgehen, ich es aber nicht schaffe mit einer angeblichen 99% Erfolgchance mal zu treffen.
""Sichtfelder"" und/für  Flächenzaber oder Heilzauber sind teilweise sehr merkwürdig, man kann über den Kopf des kleinen zwergen hinweg schießen mit einer fernkampfwaffe, aber man kann nicht über seinen Kopf hinweg einen Heilzauber wirken...? Oder Bewungsabläufe bzw. Laufrichtung sollte man auch aufmerksam machen. Neben ständigen Fallen *gähn* muss man am besten den Laufweg Feld für feld machen, wer etwas unaufmerksam ist und die halbautomatische vom Spiel vorgeschlagene Laufrichtung annimmt, läßt seinen Helden gern mal durchs Lagerfeuer latschen, welches natürlich ausgerechnet dann den Inferno-Apokalypse Schaden macht...während Gegner wieder mal Würfelglück haben und erstaunlich resistent sind.......*abwinkt*

Und das zieht sich durch das ganze Spiel, vieles ist einfach nicht nachvollziehbar und ist dann frustrierend. 
Das man ständig pleite ist, ok, rollenspieltypisch, aber selbst bei den Kämpfen erbeutet man nichts Beseonderes, absolut kein ""Sammeleffekt"", der einen in der Motivation voran bringen würde.
Leider kann man nur an bestimmten Punkten speichern, was normalerweise mehr als ausreichend ist. Aber gerade in oder teils nach Kämpfen geht das nicht, und man rutscht oft genug von einem Kampf in den nächsten. Tränke sparsam gebraucht oder verballert ist egal, wenn man aber halbtot in den nächsten Kampf schlittert und man wieder einer Gruppe frischer Gegner gegenüber steht..hat das auf Dauer wenig mit Strategie oder Taktik zu tun, sondern reines Würfelglück...

Es gibt genug, die das Spiel gut finden oder  denen es zu einfach ist. Das ist ja auch OK, aber mich stören die genannten Punkte einfach.


Wie ihr seht bin ich gar nicht begeistert und das finde ich Schade. Das Spiel hatte/hätte Potential. Aber das ""Würfelglück"" ist mir doch zu oft nur bei den Gegnern sichtbar, da nutzen auch ""X"" Talente und Fertigkeiten nichts wenn sie alle keinen Wert haben. 
Und wenn diese alle keinen Wert haben brauch ich kein RPG spielen bzw. nicht dieses.",1392287519,1392653240,False,221,3,0.844902276992797852,10,True,False,False,False,,,

I wanted to wait until I beat the game to review it. I felt obligated to do this. If you’re like me you bought in to all the good reviews this game had on Steam. A mature, turn-based rpg, starring anti-heroes? How could it be bad?

Well, for starters, the “Key Features” that Blackguards lauds itself on are deeply flawed. Character choice and combat tactics are undermined by balancing issues - certain abilities and spells are clearly better than others to the point where your characters will be at a severe disadvantage if specced the wrong way and beating some of the harder fights will be near impossible if you don’t have one or two specific spells. 

Additionally, the game suffers from sudden spikes in difficulty that leave the game almost unplayable. Battles go from challenging and needing strategy to just plain unfair and needing luck to win out.

Outside of combat, Blackguards doesn’t fair much better. The story is piecemeal and uneven - with the whole second chapter being nothing but a combat-only reenactment of “Gladiator” that only seems to be put in place to fill time. The rest of the main quest is further hampered by a multitude of random side quests that hold no weight in the game world and only serve to distract you from your objective. Narrative elements and choices are frequently brought up only to never be talked about again. And finally, when the story actually manages to come together, it’s a rushed case of too little too late - leaving you with an ending that is worse than Mass Effect 3. Because despite what the game says, you don’t decide the course of the story at key points - nothing you do matters.

Characters are also largely underdeveloped and remain that way. Although, the voice acting, for the most part, is passable aside from one annoying companion. However, the male protagonist is the clear winner between the two gender choices (think the opposite of Mass Effect).

When the game asks, “What happens when the only hope of a threatened world lies not with heroes in shining armor, but in the hands of a band of misfits and criminals?”. It turns out the exact same thing that would happen if it were heroes in shining armor - because for a game starring “criminals”, you spend most of your time helping people and doing the right thing.

Blackguards has so much potential.

Blackguards eschews the traditional “you are the hero!” trappings of most games and instead places you into the shoes of escaped convicts. Granted you are still on a quest to save your world, but you do go about it in a slightly different manner. Does the game differentiate itself enough from similar competitors, or should it have remained in solitary confinement? Suppose you’ll have to read on to find out eh?

Let’s be honest, if you have enough interest in the game to have happened upon this review then you’ve probably seen a couple of videos. From there we can assume you know what kind of art style is at play here. It’s dark, it’s got a lot of browns and grays, and it’s a high-fantasy setting. Dwarves, mages, swords and archers are all present. This is all to be expected, so we won’t cover the art beyond that. It’s pretty generic but it does the job. So we’ll go ahead and move on to cover something you’re more interested in instead.

The gameplay! This is what you were looking for, right? It’s alright. You don’t have to be ashamed that you skipped directly to this section. I won’t hold it against you. I’ll still tell you all about the game and help you decide if it’s worth the price or not. Let’s begin shall we? Blackguards is an isometric turn-based strategy game with all the expected trappings that come along with it. You begin by creating a character via a fairly detailed skill/attribute tree using a preset number of character points. You may begin as either a warrior or a mage, with the mage class costing you extra points to unlock. Points may be spent on spells, skills, attributes and upgrades for all of those. Further character points are earned by completing quests and missions throughout the game. 

As you play, you collect various companions who can be fully customized in the same fashion, giving a great deal of customization options and variations to be had. Each character, including your own, is fully voice acted and animated. Though it is hit or miss, none of it is particularly bad. It certainly doesn’t detract anything from the game even if it doesn’t always add to it either. The gameplay itself boils down to what you might expect; characters act in turns based on their initiative values, which are affected by what armor you have equipped. Heavier armor lowers initiative, light armor lowers it less. It’s fairly straightforward. Combat is equally typical of the genre. During a turn you may move and attack, or move a little further and not attack. It has a bit of depth, but not so much that it needs any more detail listed here.
 
Where Blackguards separates itself from the pack is with its tone. You aren’t a band of heroes out to save the world. You are a band of outlaws, cutthroats and brigands who just happen to be on the path that might end with the world being saved. As a result a lot of your quests have to do with helping a party member engage in some…bedroom fun times, we’ll call it, with a local baroness. Also robbery, murder, chaos and overall mayhem. It’s a nice change of pace from the usual save this person or that thing and be all heroic that usually come in games like this.

Overall, Blackguards is a fun game. It has some downsides, being low-budget, but nothing that detracts in any meaningful way from the quality of the game. It’s worth the price of admission if you’re looking for a turn-based rpg to sink some time into. Give it a shot if it looks interesting and you like the genre. I don’t think you’ll regret it too much.

Großartige Entdeckungstouren durch die Spiele-Welt sind nicht möglich, da man nur zwischen verschiedenen Orten hin und her wechseln kann. Und auch in Städten lassen sich lediglich Hotspots besuchen. Dabei bewegt man sich nicht einmal mit seinen Charakteren fort, sondern die gesamte Kommunikation mit Händlern, Handwerkern etc. laufen über Dialogboxen ab.

Wer also nach einem großen RPG-Abenteuer à la Skyrim, Witcher, Dragon Age sucht, ist hier falsch. Fans von strategischen Kämpfen (Might & Magic Heroes, Kings Bounty) haben hingegen viel Spaß mit Blackguards!

Both are old-school turn based rpgs with more of a focus on tactics than on roleplay, and the ambition of this title is to feel like a real-life in-person, yes-there-really-is-a-live-DM kind of excperience, at which this game is mostly successful.

The writing is adult, the tactics are tough, and the game has the sort of arbitrary cruelty and imperfection you get from a DMs interpretation of the rules. This is not a fps or action game, in any way, its a game for reflection. And yes its a pity there are a few genuine bugs.

This game will appeal to fans of HoMM, Disciples, XCom turnbased, Badurs Gate turn based, and as I say to players of IRL RPGs. I would say right now that I prefer MMX - Legacy to this, and its kinda stoopid that both games came on within a few weeks, given that its 5 years since the last half-decent rpg.

J'explique: dans ce jeu, il est TRES courant que l'on attaque un enemi 4 fois de suite SANS JAMAIS LE TOUCHER même avec un taux de réussite de 90%!!! Le pire c'est que quand on le touche, parfois on fait ZERO dégât.
Un truc qui est marrant, c'est que notre groupe est en petit nombre alors que les enemis peuvent être un dizaine en même temps.... pkoi? le héro n'a pas d'ami ou quoi? Un jour, faudra que les dév m'expliquent ça (problème récurant dans les jeux vidéo. C'est comme si les guerres mondiales n'avaient été gagnées que par 10 personnes, vachement logique...)
L'IA est aux fraises et réagit aléatoirement en ne comptant que sur son surnombre et sa force pour gagner (ah oui, parfois elle balance des boules de feu/glace à travers les murs, on ne se refuse rien. Et changer la difficulté ne sera d'aucune aide: j'ai bloqué sur une bataille en normal, je reteste en facile: aucune différence, tjrs les mêmes abus de l'ia, mes persos ont toujours autant besoin de lunettes pour toucher et de muscles pour faire mal)
C'est simple: c'est presque impossible d'établir une stratégie dans ce jeu de... stratégie!!!! un comble, tellement le hasard a un rôle important.
De plus il y a une tonne de stats, ok, pkoi pas? mais même en augmentant nos stats, on fait tjrs des dégâts ridicules (quand on touche!) Exemple: je boost mon sort de flemme et après 7h de jeu, je fais tjrs les mêmes dégâts!!!! pareil pour les coups. A quoi bon mettre dix mille options si elles ne servent  A RIEN? Autant les rendre plus chères, mais lorsqu'on les choisit, on a un réel gain de puissance et surtout ON VOIT UNE DIFFERENCE.

If you configure two characters exactly the same way with the same exact stats, very often one toon will hit 3x harder than the other.  There is no infomation in the log to figure out why and I even pumped up warcraft to see extra stats and they are exactly the same.

The battle system is pretty good, you have quite a few options during combat and the interactive battlefields add a layer of fun and somewhat fresh gameplay.  

My primary gripe with Blackguards is the difficulty.  To say that Blackguards is a challenging game is an understatement, but I feel that the way that Blackguards challenges you is a bit contrived and ultimately kind of cheap.  I've played difficult games in which I've lost or barely won a battle and have walked away thinking ""wow that was a good fight"".  In Black Guards if I lose I usually feel like I've been robbed.  You constantly miss spells and attacks and the enemy constantly connects whether you're fighting a semi-retarded goblin, a backstabbing rogue or a giant tree.  And the dire situations that you are placed in again and again suggest to me that you're not so much a group of badasses so much as you are really gullible and kind of incompetent.    The main character feels really generic.  Pretty much everyone or everything that you encounter seems better suited for combat than the protaganist.  And so far I don't feel like the four playable characters that I have encountered live up to the name Blackguards.  They actually seem like relatively nice guys.  When I saw the name Blackguards I got excited because I had assumed that I would be taking on the roles of the Lannisters from GOT.  Instead it feels more like I've signed on with the Partridge family.  I've only  played a few hours so far and I'm not giving up on the game entirely just yet, but that's mostly because of the price tag.  This is not a 40 dollar game and I would not recommend that anyone pay that much to play this.

Words which define the game itself and help encapsulate what I'm trying to get across. This game merits one such word, and that word is :

""Chewy""

Here's the deal. Blackguards is a strategy game which has been dipped, liberally, in the world of The Dark Eye, think Dungeons and Dragons germanic cousin and you'll be in the right area. It's got a wonderful, thick, rich backstory, with a lot of history, gods, cults, personalities, politics and intrigue. This is a world that over the course of several games (Check out Drakensang when you get the chance if you find yourself a fan of Blackguards, it's worth the time invested) has become every bit as nuanced and subtle as the more accessible DnD counterpart. The operative word though is accessible.

The Dark Eye is to Pen and Paper roleplay what Dark Souls is to videogames. A stern, rock faced, cold hearted, unyielding dominatrix who seems impenetrable and who demands your complete and total servitude, and at the slightest folly will beat you bloody and raw and tell you to start over again. You will, multiple times, due to a flaw in your build that down the line results in your character ending up stunted and a fight proving a little beyond your reach or poor choices when you level your character. 

But each time, you will learn, through the beatings and the whippings, much like Dark Souls, you will learn, and you will improve. Eventually once you get past the gatekeeper and once you've survived the rite of passage that is the near vertical learning curve of the games mechanics, you'll find a world that richly rewards, and deserves every minute you spend within it.

The graphics finally have shaken off a lot of the shoddiness and rough edges that have pervaded a lot of the TDE games, Blackguards is slick, smooth, and carries a glossy sheen with it, it's not QUITE melt your eyes gorgeous, but it's certainly pleasing to look at, and the spell effects certainly carry with them a definite sense of satisfaction as they connect and fly about the battlefield. So too has the voice acting and musical score improved, as presentation goes, Blackguards has matured TDE into a strong, and at last truly sellable product.

But it's not for novices. Noooooooo sir. This is not a new player friendly game. So far to date no actual ""Roleplaying game"" set in the TDE universe has managed to be even -remotely- new player friendly, this is not about to buck that trend, not when your character sheet runs to five seperate tabbed pages with more numbers to make sense of than the US Federal Budget. Not when the wheel that surrounds your character can offer dozens of possible options as to what action you might wish to take during a turn. Not when a conversation option can turn a story down a route that results in a fight you may not have been prepared for. This game does not go lenient on people who are not careful, not methodical, or not thoughtful.

The main story arc I'm going to leave spoiler free and focus on the mechanical side, the game follows a two-beat system, the world map, being a parchment map overworld that you zip around and visit static settlements to partake in various pleasantly rendered towns and villages, which offer side quests, conversation dialogs, healing and merchants. Then there's the meat of the game, a mix of single encounter and multi-encounter dungeons.

These take place on hex based maps which are closer to things like Kings Bounty : The Legend, however in this case, we're dealing with -single units-, and in this case the strategic rendering is done with TDE levels of detail. Characters are solid, so you can't shoot or cast spells through them, ditto for static objects and moveable objects. This means positioning becomes a factor, you can't just layer your melee in front of your casters, you need to play smart and ensure people are in the right place. Equipment too has significant impacts overall on the fight, with bows having minimum and maximum ranges before major penalties are applied. Spells have granular levels of ""to hit"" based on the casters skill... you get the idea. We're talking pen and paper levels of detail, rendered lovingly in the game.

Once you set up hotbars for your most frequently used abilities, fights run pretty smooth and fast, and the strategy element is as the word I used to begin with implies - ""Chewy"" - you'll be constantly thinking and rethinking your moves, and the AI puts up a respectable fight even at default difficulty. Environmental hazards too present a real and significant problem, and throw in an extra layer, thankfully there's no time constraint, so feel free to get a coffee as you ponder each move.

Do I recommend it? Yes. With the caveat. This is not a game that will appeal to everyone. It's a niche game. I celebrate it's existence. It's a strategy game for strategy gamers.

I am a big fan of D&D and have played more RPGs than I can count.  I am also a huge fan on XCOM and that style of strategy so this looked like a match made in game heaven.

Alas it was not to be though.  Here is the good the bad and the ugly.

Good:
- Graphics are wonderful.
- Voice acting is top-notch.
- There ""appears"" to be a lot of character customizations.

Bad:
- Storyline beats you up in the second chapter and you lose your ""investment"" arbitrarily.  Sad really.
- There really is a lack of ""strategy"" as you are at the whim of roll of the dice.  Not XCOM calibre, not even close.
- $39.99?  I got is pre-release cheap.  Save your money it isn't worth that much.


Ugly:
- XCOM style strategy doesn't play as such.  Random roll really makes this a flawed game.  You can employ the exact same strategy move for move and breeze through a level, and other times get decimated.
- There is no place to ""grind"" it out to build up your characters if you are so willing to do so.  Early in the game you will find yourself redoing levels because you got a bad roll and you haven't enough Ducats (money) to do what you need.
- Some levels (first one) become closed the moment you go to another map.  There is no turning back until later.  A big map, but very linear and very unforgiving.

You have to REALLY love D&D style play to get into this game.  It will take a while to get used to, and even longer to become skilled at this game.  It feels more like work and less like fun.

I would say this game is a typical example where a good idea meets bad story and bad implementation. I would not recommend to buy it, even if it would be on sale for only 9,95.. 
The fights are nice but only because they are turn based... the so-called story is meaningless... there is no good gear to buy... I would even say it is not even needed, because all limited money will be spend on heal/mana potions, which costs 1-4 times more than any good/best gear or weapon.. The game is badly balanced or completely unbalanced at all.. The AI is sometimes very stupid, sometimes cheats badly... All spells/talents are worthless…
I would say, a good game must be interesting and enjoyable... On my opinion, it does not suit for this one.
Buy it, if you do not trust my words. Buy it, if you would like to make your own opinion.

The characters and voice acting are top notch.  The dialogue witty.

Character advancement is done by earning adventure points that you apply to the skills and stats you wish to improve. There's no set levels. The more skilled or powerful you are at something, the more adventure points it costs to improve that skill or stat further.  It makes it impossible to make a character that is unbeatable at everything, so you really need to put some thought into party roles and utilizing each character's strengths and weaknesses.

Most of the battlefields have static and dynamic features that can add an advantage to your party or spell their doom. This keeps combat interesting.

One thing I found fun, but some might find frustrating is that you don't get to choose where your characters start on the battlefield.  For the most part, your characters are started in such a logical position that you don't even question it, but every now and then a battle is added with your characters scattered all over the place. Sometimes it makes sense within the story line, sometimes not.  

The enemy AI does fairly well as an opponent. While it doesn't always use the battlefield features to full advantage, it does it often enough to keep you on your toes. 


Overall, two thumbs up !

One thing to note - if you are the kind of player that has to have tons of sparkly, magical loot, this game is not for you.
If you are the kind of player that needs to have five sets of armor, fifteen weapons, and a house with fifty chests to store all those weapons and armor in, this game is not for you.  Gear upgrades are mundane and modest, and you'll have the same armor and weapons with you for large portions of the game.  Encumbrance penalties dissuade you from carrying much more than the armor on your back and the weapons on your person.

Un juego que técnicamente es mediocre: gráficos de hace 10 años. Las animaciones, las cutscenes, y la mayoría de lo que se ve es anticuado para un juego de 2014. 
Pasando a lo importante, la historia y el desarrollo son bastante simples, recién cuando termina el primer episodio uno puede contemplar la parte divertida del juego, que es viajar por el mapa libremente, visitando ciudades y realizando misiones.
Sobre la trama, puedo asegurar que es de lo más normal y previsible que hay en un RPG, sin casi sorpresas ni momentos memorables. El protagonista es un mero espectador, y carece de toda personalidad (si bien es descripto como holgazán). Los compañeros son poco interesantes, y a menudo son ellos los que tienen las líneas de diálogo ingeniosas, graciosas, o simplemente, los que toman las deciciones, por encima del protagonista.
La dificultad merece un capítulo aparte. Es increíblemente desbalanceada, y tiene de a momentos picos de dificultad desesperantes. Consejo: Si una misión no sale, y no es obligatoria, déjala para más adelante.
Como destacable, es la detallada forma en la que se desarrollan los personajes, a medida que adquieren puntos de aventura, necesarios para subir las habilidades, conjuros, puntos de vida, de magia, etc. ya que no hay niveles de personajes y puedes elegir minusciosamente como gastarlos. Cuánto mejoran los personajes a medida que incrementan sus atributos, es algo que lleva tiempo darse cuenta.
Resumen:
Lo bueno:
El sistema de juego, y el combate.
La dificultad, exige pensar cada movimiento que haces.

Lo malo:
La historia y los personajes son muy poco interesantes. 
El desarrollo de la trama es muy sencillo.
La falta de contenido entre combate y combate (llamese historia, diálogos, etc.) puede ser agotador de a momentos.

It has the feel of a proper RPG though, with various attributes/skills/powers that have points put into them that are subsequently used in the fights. The out of combat system isn't as interactive as, say, fallout 3 or skyrim or something. It's almost exclusively chatboxes accompanying a thumbnail picture of the speaker while there is a static background image, like many JRPGs (especially back in the day), and there is a map with nodes on it to which you may travel but you don't run around freely looking for stuff. Personally I don't consider that a drawback per se but others might. I can't say for sure how much your choices effect the story because I'm too early in the game, but the element of your choices mattering seems to be there, for example *spoiler* there are twin brothers that want to kill each other and you can choose if or which one you help them kill and you fight different battles and get different rewards depending on which one you choose. It's a sidequest though so I'm not certain it's a big deal.

Though there are some serious bugs and exploits possible in the game to beat encounters (such as the final boss), I vastly enjoyed this game. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys tactical RPG's or just decent RPG's in general. However don't expect a super duper in-depth story experience. This game is based heavily on the turn based combat and in a lesser extent on the storyline.

Things that are good:

- Stupidity gets punished
- Upgrading characters is really mandatory
- Reasonable dynamic encounters, that ask for different approaches.
- Letting you wander around the world to do sidequests and unlock trainers
- The exp-gain system (named AP)

Less impressed by:

- Cutscenes were useless and lacked in quality compared to the rest of the game.
- Balance in the different roles is off, my Archer is 1-shotting 80hp enemies.
- Encounters vs caster NPC's are completely random; no synergy or logic in their spells.
- Best in Slot gear is fairly early obtainable, roughly 50% of the game. Didn't feel like a superduper reward.

Der Grund ist schnell gefunden: Man rennt von Schlacht zu Schlacht, dass war es. Ein freies Erkunden der Welt ähnlicher Spiele wie der Heroes oder King's Bounty Reihe ist hier leider nicht, Blackguards beschränkt sich nur auf Schlachtfelder, die Städte wo man zwischendrin mal das ein oder andere Gespräch führt oder was einkauft sind nur statisch und nicht frei begehbar. 90% der Städte bestehen sogar nur aus einem Bildschirm.

Grafik: Zweckmäßig, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Animationen im Kampf ganz ordentlich.

Sound: Gute Waffengeräusche, stimmige Musik die sich schnell wiederholt aber nie wirklich stört. Sprachausgabe in Deutsch teils teils. Die weibliche Hauptfigur sowie der Zwerg machen ihre Sache richtig gut, der Rest der Truppe auch noch ok aber alles was sonst noch so durch die Lande streift ist meist durchwachsen bis schlecht besetzt.

Umfang: Nach knapp 40 Stunden war ich in Kapitel 5 angekommen, was ein recht ordentlicher Umfang ist. Man muss aber bedenken das diese 40 Stunden nicht gerade sehr abwechslungsreich daher kommen.

Negatives: Schlachtfelder lassen sich weder drehen noch zoomen, es kann nur der Kamerawinkel in der Höhe angepasst werden. Es gibt kaum unterschiedliche Rüstungen, für Kämpfer gibt es ganze 4, für Zauberer nur 2 und für Fernkämpfer (Leder) sogar nur deren eine soweit ich das entdecken konnte. Das ist ziemlich mager. Bei den Waffen sieht es schon etwas besser aus aber das Gelbe vom Ei wird einem hier auch nicht geboten. Dialoge im Spiel sehr statisch, Mundbewegungen nicht synchron zur Sprache, keinerlei Mimik/Gestik bei den Figuren erkennbar.

Fazit: Für 12,49 die es mal im Early Access Sale gekostet hat war es definitiv den Kauf wert, aber für mehr kann ich das Spiel leider nur bedingt empfehlen da es zu schnell öde wird da einem nicht wirklich abwechslung im Spielverlauf geboten wird.

Follows genetic fantasy tropes . Character creation is bare bones , you cannot modify starting stats .  Game offers large world map , but due to its linear nature you will be just staring at places you can't go . Story progresses by clicking on hubs where you will either enter a city screen or combat . Side quests are very limited . 

Appearance customization is limited to picking  out of five pre-made characters per gender.  There is significant shortage of light and leather armor variety . 85-90% of all armors in a game are metal which means you spell caster wont be able to use it . Game has nice sandbox system where you are allowed pick whichever skills/perks you like . Perks require xp and trainer .  It can be difficult to find trainer to teach you perk . For example you might unknowingly leave act 1 and lose access to mage trainer for rest of act 2 . 

Combat is dull . Most of it involves using same spell/melee attack and hoping you will get lucky.  

Graphics and are style are uninspiring .  There is no camera angle rotation and overall camera controls are poor . This can lead to some frustration such as inability to target or see enemy hiding in a corner . 

You can interact with some environment and there are some environmental hazards like methane gas in swamps. You characters and enemies can slip on wet floor . Some maps with lots of water spills turn into some kind of comedy involving every character falling to the ground at start of their turn . 

Voice acting is decent . And dwarf you get in beginning of the game is awesome .

Does each character have skeletons, of course but I've yet to see one that actually warrents a ""Blackguard"" title; in fairness here the Blackguard definition, a-la from Dungeons & Dragons, is in a different context then from this title.  

As has been stated in other reviews & from [i]Daedelic Entertainment[/i], the game is based off a tabletop role-playing game from Germany. This is my first foray into this system in any case.  The story is OK, but not much more then that.  You don't gain levels per se, but you gain adventure points (AP) when either defeating foes or completing a quest.  You use these points to raise just about everything pertaining to your character, be it statistics, your skills, your resitances, & for magic users how effective spells are & the astral points needed to cast them.  The higher the ""level"" of the STATS, skills etc, the more AP they cost.  Unfortunately, I've not come into any battle where my group has had a ""windfall"" of AP, so far  I've either gotten 30, 60 or around 120 AP depending on the battle ([i]whether mundane foes or major ones[/i]).   I've gotten a bit more AP when completing quests though. In fairness here I'm playing it on the easiest difficulty, maybe battles give you more AP on the harder ones, though I doubt it.  

The hightlights of the game are the battle system, I've yet to encounter any ""cut & paste"" battle area.  The upgrade system for your characters is fairly subtle, but noticable for the most part.  In short, you don't feel like you're spending AP to upgrade your character & they don't feel like they're more powerful.   The spells are diverse & effective. Mapwise there is a fairly large area to cover in both the in battle maps & world map.   

The weaknesses of the game, thus far are:  

No areas to really grind for AP,  [spoiler]with possible exception of arena, but even there I believe you can only have a certain amount of battles in the arena[/spoiler].  You can't actually make things, not armor or weapons, at least not at the point in the game that I'm at.  There's no height or lowlands difference in battles; in short I've not had so much as 1 battle where either I or the enemy started at the top of a hill.  I've also yet to have been involved in a battle where I've gotten a huge amount of AP. I'm roughly at the halfway mark, going by what the creators wrote on the main page, but I've yet to see so much as one magical item, whether defensive or offensive item.  I don't know the tabletop RPG this is based off of so perhaps the world lacks magical items or if they're simply more subtle in nature when compared to games like Final Fantasy Tactics.   The spellcasters also need work, I find them more useful as party ""buffers"", and from what I've read on the forums I'm in the nearly overwhelming majority.  

This game needs some minor tweaks to really grab you & keep you in it's grip; but so far any issues I have with it, in the scheme of things, are relatively minor & not game breaking.",1391367246,1393877068,True,1,0,0.467836260795593262,0,True,False,False,False,,,

there is really no exploration, its extremely linear and predictable as far as the encounters go. The rules of turn based combat are also not the greatest and are very vanilla. No attack from behind bonuses that I could see so you can retreat and not worry about taking a blade to the back if you were standing in a hex next to an enemy.

Pour les débutants, le jeu devient un peu répétitif quand vous êtes poussée d'un combat à l'autre. Ce n'est pas un RPG classique, mais quelque chose de plus proche des FF tactiques .

Cela étant dit, le combat est amusant, l'histoire fascinante, des personnages intéressants avec skilltree détaillée . Certain  combats peuvent être assez dur et le système de combat  peuvent devenir un peu ennuyeux parfois mais rien qu'un rechargement ne peuvent pas résoudre. J'aime le fait que vous avez réellement besoin de vous préparez avant de passer à la prochaine bataille que vous ne pouvez pas appuyer sur la touche d'inventaire et commencer à échanger des armes ou en utilisant les éléments.

This is my 3-part review of the game. 1. The RPG system, 2. The actual roleplay, 3. The feel of the game. It is worth mentioning that I am a RPG guy with long experience in both Pen and Paper RPG (mostly PF, but also Vampire), and a lot of CRPG. So, naturally, this has an impact on how I liked or disliked the game.

1. The roleplaying system The Black Eye is really nice and has a lot of depth and will be candy if you, like me, havent tried it before. I cannot accout for the differences between the pen and paper 4th edition (witch the game mechanic is derived from) and the system Blackguards has implemented. But as far as I am concerned its really nice. Different attributes combinate to give different base statistics - and control how well you fight / use talents / casts spells. There are no levels for characters, insted you gain Adventure Points from combats and finished quests that you either continually spend or save up to spend on more expensive upgrades. It really is a fun system and has similarity with the way Vampire the masquerade works. The turn based tactics is nothing but pure enjoyment!

2. The actual roleplaying is somewhat linear. If you like that then no problem. If you want more choice, then it has shortcomings. Things are pretty much set up and you cannot deviate too much from the path. The choices you are given doesnt even have that much impact. For instance one side quest presents you with two identical twins, the one is evil and the other is good - but who is who. In the end, if you chose to root out the good guy OR the bad guy there is no impact on the game other than your own conciousness. (...and honestly, who cares abouth truth when it comes to a book worth 50 ducats?!)

3. The acutal feel of the game is, at least to me, awsome. The characters you pick up are rather strange, a paranoid dwarf, a sleezy magician and later on a drug addict elf to name some. But this is what strangley keeps it interesting - actually highly enjoyable. Bugger off with the lawful good paladin that does good at every turn. Here its like ""plant unlawful poison at a highly esteemed noble to get him arrested"" or ""Get a new slavegirl / trophy for the master of the city"".

To sum up, I really enjoy the game - (not finished yet as this is written) and I see a replay possibility with choosing differet abilities. If you enjoy RPGs and in particular the combat part - this is a game for you.",1391253103,1391253103,True,2,0,0.506802737712860107,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Simply put, Blackguards turned out to be a rare gem and has already, surprisingly, found its way to my personal list of all time favorites. A few minor glitches aside, it's a lovely blend of dark fantasy storytelling, challenging tactical combat, and flexible charachter development that so far hasn't failed to delight. And it looks quite attractive to boot, with a fantastic UI and lovingly crafted imagery. 

The cast of lovable rogues that comprise your party is well acted and well written. The story as a whole, at least so far, is engaging without being overbearing, maintaining a light touch while never failing to be consistently interesting. It ain't Shakespeare, but it never aspires to be. Instead, it accomplishes exactly what the early hours of the game promise: it is  a damned enjoyable caper of a kind that perhaps we need more of in the world, a slice of true, unabashed, adventure escapism that somehow evokes the simpler, formative days of a young nerd's nerddom. The subject matter is often dark, but it always feels like an exciting journey above all else. And sometimes that's more than enough to make something worth one's time.

The Game is really good, its challenging, u really need to think about what to do and how u do it. Runnin in axes blazin wont get u far ;)

So, the Combat System is turn-based with NO timer! You can take ur time to think about youre move.
You cant use health/mana potions, bandages etc. Infight! unless u eqipped it inside ur belt.
Belt's have different number of slots. take the right items for each hero ;)
You or the Enemy are able to block,dodge & parry every melee attack or arrow/bolt. Also it can be missed :D
The Magic cant really miss, but there is a high chance u cant get the fireball done :D
You can use (in most of the fights) the environment to ur advantage or to ur disadvantage :D
Espacially the swamps (damn i hate the Swamps), u can get Stuck inside and be unable to use this hero for about 5 turns :(
You can learn the ability to ""see"" those traps. i higly recommend to use it :D
I never died as much as in this game on ""normal"" ^^
There is NO crafting, you need 2 buy everything from a merchant/smith.
Every NPC have a unique set of items 2 sell. Most of em r really expensive so choose wisely ;)

Обещанное взаимдействие с объектами ограничивается поджиганием (остальное не имеет смысл - лучше потратить ход на урон, чем на действие с объектом)

Тактика - остутствует напрочь. Берете воина - на первом ходе посылаете максимально далеко во врагов. 6 врагов его окружают - безумие на всю толпу и победа. Два воина и два мага (даются по сюжету - позволяют подобной тактикой побеждать в любых битвах). 180 обещанных карт, из них 160 проходятся таким образом.

Баланса оружия как такового нет. Ударное за  счет умения тройного урона делает бессмыленным другое оружие. Гном с дубиной и щитом нанес максимально 65 урона против 34 урона двуручной пикой. Два воина с дубинами смеются в голос над финальным боссом с 90 хп. Удары по 65 не проходили, но по 25-30 - регулярно. Собственно - 3 фаза боя у меня получилась - 2 воина за 2 хода подбежали и, по одному разу ударив, убили мага.

Баланс магии? Зачем нужно противоядие, когда враги отравляют каждое попадание? Зачем нужны наносящие урон заклинания, когда их хватает на 4 применения за бой, при этом урон слабже в два раза минимум попадания топором? Сбивание с ног на 1 раунд - есть безумие (но безумие - вообще магия на уровне чита). Мне хватило на прохождение лечения, безумия, огненного шара 8 лвл. Все остальное - напрасная трата очков опыта.

Ну и совет: за прохождение вам встретятся два воина, два мага (один станет предфинальным боссом), 1 лучник (быстро умрет по сценарию). 3 маг не нужен, маги против финальных боссов вообще не нужны. 2 воинов тоже хватает.

The choice of weapons and their cost (in gold). The amount of weapon choices is very boring, just your run of the mill (standard) choices. And the fact that you literally never, NEVER, feel as if ""that weapon was the best choice"". Because all of your enemies have the same or better chance of killing you.

Each battle-map is different fom the last and has a unique feel to it. Customizing your characters in weapon skills and magic feels rewarding. The most fun comes from figuring how this game actually works, like when the points you just spent make a noticeable difference in the overall challenging battles. Don't expect too much offensive magic, you're better off keeping your mages in a support-role (where they ROCK hard). You probably heard about the interaction with stuff in battles, but that's totally overrated: Wasting a turn to push a box or set something ablaze is rarely worth it. Occasionally this is implemented quite nicely, like trapping something in a cage, but most of the time there's only boxes to push.

I hear people drooling over how interesting the characters are, but honestly your party members are *completely* one-sided and sometimes downright dislikeable  (*minor spoiler* Zurburan selling Takate to some slaver...seriously? *spoiler end*). Their is no intruiging background story to them and definetly no progression in personality whatsoever. The story on the other hand is compelling, but since story-specific dialogue is only few and far in between the dominating combat, it's ultimately thin...very thin (if you know DBZ, you lnow what I'm talking about *lol*). The world itself feels a bit on the bland side and the streamlined gameplay leaves little room for Lore or in-depth consideration of your potentially stunning surroundings.

The biggest issue here is how barebone the gameplay is. After a fight you basically point&-)click your mouse button a few times to advance the dialogue or move to the interchangeable towns to check on the completely interchangeable merchants and start the next fight. Combat-Dialogue-Click-Combat-Repeat. Kudos for the quest-writing though which I found top notch!

Positives:
1) Long Playtime; I got around 40 hours out of my first playthrough, got half the achievments
2) Story and Characters are good, interesting and likeable
3) Voice Actors and Music are both great
4) Complexity of Character Building and Fighting is something I hope for in most RPG's and I got it in this one, lots of stats to invest points in and to costumize your characters
5) Sometimes the dice won't roll your way, sometimes they do, it's as close to a D&D experience in a modern Video Game you will ever get

Negatives:
1) Loading times when you enter a city, or go through areas in a city are attrocious and can get really on your nerves when your try to check NPC's for side quests
2) Unbalanced Encounters, Not that big of a deal but sometimes you can get your ass kicked out of the blue which can be frustrating
3) Encounters that don't tell you what the goal is
4) Slow Battle System, the more enemies there are the longer it takes for everyone to finish their turn which can piss me off
5) Lame Ending

Tips for Beginners:

1) Choose Hunter as your MC; You won't get one for 80% of the game
2) Sword and Shield sucks, Spears are great and so are 2 one-handed Weapons
3) Always carry a blunt weapon with your chars to switch to when you encounter UNDEAD enemies, they are immune to piercing dmg
4) Train Perception high with your quickest Character(With highest initiative, mine is Takate) and use it at the begin of every fight to check for traps
5) Spells to lvl for your Mage: Haste to lvl 13 and cast it on your best fighters, it rly helps and is srsly good; Also I like Fireball @lvl 3 and the AOE Spell the 2nd Mage gets can be rly great coz it knocks down enemies.
6) Try to push ""Astral Energy Regeneration"" as soon as you can, helps out alot too.

I can also appreciate the aspect of the game where you need to be very careful how you expend your experience because there is a fairly linear event horizon and if you have mispent too many points you may not be able to win the next fight.

What I very much do not appreciate about the game are the various idiotic things you need to do to stay alive where you aren't really roleplaying, you are trying to beat the ganme:

1. You dont seem to be able to buy a potion of healing and just drink it. You need to enter a fight then waste your time drinking it.

2. I have mana regenration and healing (basically over time unlimited healing) I can sit in a fairly safe town but need to entera fight to regenerate mana. I would be fine with this in an arena with 10 seconds between fights but in the narrative I have hours to lounge around the town. However, I cant heal myself even though I have the ability.

3. When you have a character with a healing spell and mana regeneration, you have to sit around with one monster left hitting one character (or behind a force wall) as your mana regenerates and you heal. You spend 40 turns getting your mana and health up to full.

I think the thing most people have a hard time with in this one is the dificulty of the game and them not really explaining on how attacks work. like in the percent chance to hit someone.  but if you do a little research you can figure out how to make it easy. 

like all spells have three attributes allocated to them. so if you want to cast a spell that has agi, cha, const then you would want all 3 of those stats to be high. the higher they are and the higher the spell lvl is the better chance you have to hitting someone with them.

for rng and mele you want have the stat to be high to hit. for range its dex for mele its str. think there are also others that help. then you need the weapon you are using good also. plus therre is also a slider on the weapon. that lets you decide if you want to defend or attack better. so if you are on defend on the item you wont hit as often or as hard. so set it to attack.

all in all i think this is a decent game worth a shot. at least on the demo for anyone who has an interest in tactical strategy rpgs.  i got it on sale and im not disapointed at all. also the difficulty can be a little harsh you will not win a battle the first time everytime. but im not one for easy games i loved temple of elemental evil and others that are harsh.",1390949354,1391031171,True,5,0,0.554796338081359863,0,True,False,False,False,,,

    the impression i got from my time with the game is that it's a b-lister, mostly directed at heroes of might and magic fans of the easy-to-please variety. boring maps with just stupid combat, hexagonal set pieces with stupid cover and a stupid skill/attack wheel which is too small to see in 1080p on an hdtv without straining. just the most basic of games whos aim was too low and hit the mark squarely (the 'too low' mark).  if i had played the entire game, my opinion might matter more, but i gave this what i feel was a fair shake, and even submitted recomendations about controller support and the ui, which were apparently ignored (probably because i wasnt ass-kissy enough, according to one random poster- paraphrased by me of course). 
     if you are a fan of xcom enemy unknown, you are going to know what you are missing when you play this electronified board game. xcom does all the things right that this game ignores in favor of flashback hour (think ff tactics, but with crappy gameplay). the way you are thrust from one fight to the next is lame, when, given this is 2014, i expected to be able to a) walk around freely or somewhat freely between fights, perhaps with interesting things to do or b) same as 'a'. instead, the story is fed to you between battles and that's it. fight! crappy fight! 

if the price was 10 dollars, it would excuse the quality in my opinion, but they want to charge like the big boys, they get judged like them.

The A.I. makes no sense at all and seems to just roll of RNG. For instance, you could be in combat with an insect, a large dumb version of 'lice' that would waltz right by your entire team to go secure an objective that you should be holding that the insect doesn't even KNOW about, story wise. 

There is no way to view your armor as a whole, to compare it to other armor sets. This also doesn't let you save in combat, and the combats are slow and tedious. Matter of fact, I had the FINAL gladiator fight I was in crash on the next to final turn as a waited out the final baddy to blow up (was on a timer in an arena and covered in oil and lit.)

This game will make you rage, not because of the difficulty, but because the horrible interface, no real enemy A.I. (I swear they go full retard half the time. ""Oh hey, spikes. I should jump up and down on this space over and over again until I keel over!)

Overall, go with something more polished that you can get your hands on. Only 5 characters to play as in this one too, so I suggest you roll an archer, considering you don't get to keep one, forcing you to roll an archer (or gimp someone else into an archer) if you want a balanced team.

You could go the classic route and just beat the baddies in a one on one fight, or if you’re feeling creative lure them into hazards that you normally wouldn't think of. For instance lure them into a bush then set it on fire or release a group of prisoners to fight for you. Even some battles have great story elements. Need to collect some mushrooms while a giant troll is guarding them. Distract the troll and gather the mushrooms, then run. It’s these types of options that make you feel like you’re having an impact and cause you to think outside the box. The few problems I do have with the game mostly revolve around a few graphical glitches and sometimes the enemy AI can be a little too slow. Graphical glitches like people suddenly having mouths that stretch way too far when they speak or the amount of a silver currency you earned being blocked has happened to me. While the biggest flaw is probably the AI, I like how you can set traps for them but when an enemy chooses to continually get burned in a bush and not leave it that’s when I call stupid on the AI.

I have played a pretty good amount of this game so far. Is it the best? No. However it is not bad by any means.

If you like turn based RPGs then this game is great. People REALLY should research games before they buy them. The game has a little bit of a steep learning curve but if you are even a semi-decent gamer and are familiar with TBS games then that should not be a problem at all.

Personally I am REALLY REALLY sick of all the games nowdays hand holding you and making things so simple. What some say about the leveling and skills/stat points is true however. There is really not alot of explaination about how to do this. Trial and error is all you have. I ended up starting the game over a few times before I really started to figure out how to do it properly.

The story is not the greatest and neither is the gameplay or graphics. However I have had alot of fun with this game. I like the darker story. I like that your crew is not a bunch of goody goody types. The movement and cities are pretty bland but that is ok beacuse the fights are alot of fun IMO. The enviornmental parts of the battles are very cool. I like that you have to open cells to create a distraction and get away from the guards. It was way cool that I had to lead the troll into some flammable gas and then shoot him with a fireball to do a ton of damage. Cutting the rope and dropping a chandelier on some  guards was pretty damn cool. There is alot to like in this game if you can get around the mediocre graphics and horrid voice acting!

If you are looking for a AAA super polished graphical game this is not for you. If you like a decent story, dont really care about graphics, and you like TBS RPGs then this is for you!

Overall this is a pretty good game. There are not alot of TBS RPGs out there to pick from and if your a big fan of that genre then you will like this game.

Divinity: Original Sin is a better choice IMO but that is still in Alpha and has ALOT of bugs. I bought both of them and I really enjoy them both.

Again this is not the prettiest game. The voice acting and cut scenes are ATROCIOUS!!!!! But who cares as long as the combat and RPG elements are good.

Graphics: 5/10
Sound: 5/10
Story: 5/10
Gameplay: 7/10

The system is both simple and overly complex at the same time, but it balances out nicely. The graphics and the storyline certainly aren't anything to write home about, but for a turn-based game they are more than acceptable - after all, the real focus of any turn-based strategy game is going to be the combat, not the sparkling wit or crisp graphics.

Unfortunately, the combat is where things really fall apart.

That's not to say that the combat system itself is at fault. It's passable, and roughly analogous to Dungeons & Dragons. The real problem is that many of the set-piece battles are designed to be inherently unfair. Even on the easiest difficulty, you'll often struggle with scenarios that are designed to be one step short of impossible. You'll often find your character(s) stripped of their equipment and forced to use random items that you don't have the skill to use. You'll often find yourself thrown into insane battlefields filled with literally dozens of hidden traps, endless hordes of respawning opponents, or obtuse victory conditions that require you to interact with five or more scattered pieces of scenery. Somewhere along the line, the designers seem to have gotten just a bit too clever about their level designs, inadvertantly making many encounters more frustrating than fun.

Fortunately, the developers made several adjustments as the game went through early release - so if you can power through the first two chapters (Chapter Two is particularly frustrating), then you'll find that the game opens up a good deal. At that point it becomes a much more enjoyable experience, although still occasionally plagued with annoyingly obtuse map design (one optional ""arena"" map can easily take an hour or more to finish due to it's maze-like design and infinitely spawning enemies).

If you're a hardcore strategy gamer, then Blackguards is certainly worth buying. For anyone even slightly more casual, though, you should probably give Blackguards a pass.",1390869245,1390942405,False,10,0,0.542561352252960205,1,True,False,False,False,,,

If you like RPGs, buy a real RPG, if you like tactical combat, buy XCOM. But dont buy Blackguards.

After 10 hours of playing the game, the game is simply over for me. I am stuck at an impossible fight, the autosave is at a point were I cannot make any meaningful alterations to who fights anymore. And the fight is unwinable with the character I build.

Now, dont get me wrong. Its not a badly build character. Its a very straightforward mage. Its not underleveled either for I did every single quest so far. But if your character is a mage, and you dont build it in one very specific way, you will be stuck at the beginning of chapter 2. It is impossible to progress, since there are no potions or pieces of mage armor available so you usually just get one-shot.

Unfortunately, this happens quite often in Blackguards. The game is not balanced - at all. You can in theory build a character, but if you build anything other than a fighter or a very specific mage, you just get stuck in impossible fights - like the one that ended my game.

I had fights like this before, and I got through them by just reloading for two hours until the RNG finally turned into my favor.  Here is an example:

In one fight, turn one, my main character would get shot and fall on his ass about 90% of the time. That means the fight is over - I lacked the DPS to win and he would just continually be shot down. There is nothing you can do against this either. You cannot prepare for fights - all spells etc. can only cast once you are IN the fight. So right away 9/10 cases, I had to reload. If my character managed to dodge, I now had to get a very specific spell of to make sure he wont get shot down every single time. However, the spell barely ever got used so it failed in 3/10 cases. If it failed, reload.

So right away I could only progress in 3% of the cases. Of course the rest of the fight also included a lot of luck.

Sure with a different character build that wouldnt have happened - but if the game is only beatable with some very specific builds than either dont give the players the option to build their characters, or rebalance the fights.

This is the main problem of Blackguards - the game is not skillbased, its largely RNG. That means that dicerolls decide outcomes of fights, not your skill or ingenuity. This makes the whole experience hugely frustrating. 

And its not frustrating in a good way. In Dark Souls, it is extremely frustrating but you know its your fault, and if you get good enough, if you finally figure all the patterns out, you beat it, and its awesome. In Blackguards, you beat a frustrating fight and the only thing you feel is 'finally its over'. Because its not skill that won the fight, its just that for pure random chance the dice have fallen in your favor. 

Almost every fight in the game is like this. The few fights that arent usually have a very simple to figure out environmental danger that you have to activate in order to basically get a free win.

Until this game actually gets balanced, dont buy it.",1390858205,1390858205,False,11,0,0.493563205003738403,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is ultimately a bad story mixed with crappy game mechanics (BTW i am playing on normal).  There is no exploration into the game.  i have played 10+ hours worth so far.  just go hear kill this go hear kill that, save this maiden, do this task.  etc...

Blackguards is one of those games that is not going to give you instant gratification.  After playing it for a couple of hours I initially logged out and went back to another RPG thinking to myself that it was not very fun.  Well after going back to it a few times and progressing through the game I've determined i love the game.  It takes some time to figure out the combat system and how to get a feel for the ebonflow.  It is highly strategic and combat can be approached many different ways using the battlefield, spells, usable inventory and special abilities, this is where the game really shines, it has a difficult and somewhat different system than most RPGs I've played.  

If you dislike a true roll based game where you expect to push x spell and it hit your enemy, do not buy.  This game will drive you crazy sometimes in that regard, the battles can be long and having your caster miss twice in a row with your entire party down really brings me back to the Nintendo days of smashing my controller into the screen.  However this is part of the appeal to me.  And yes somewhat less but the enemies do bork their spells ocassionally too so it is a little fair in that regard.

If you dislike having to study a game with a totally different feel than what you are used to, in regards to stats, abilities, and tactics, do not buy.

If you love a good challenge and are willing to spend some trial and error learning the system, it is extremely fun and the play is flawless, i've seen no bugs or problems other than the Head and Foot Icon on the character pane reversed.  I've only put a few days into the game but can say that it has grown on me with each battle and i can see where the replay on it will be high since each battle really is totally different and your tactics are very modifiable.  I'd give this game a 8/10 thus far and believe it's one of the better RPGs on the market right now.

Bad enough the normal D&D variables to hit, the variable damage, but then lets toss in higher numbers of opponents, invisible terrain traps, and opponents that always have poisoned weapons.

This game will appeal to some of you, but it doesnt work for me.

Blackguardsis a style of game I just dont like. 

To be clear I prefer game that at least give you the appearance of free will and self determination. 

Blackguards has set out to control your play, not allowing for any random encounters and engineering the enounters that you have so that they are all ""challenging"". Which would be fine, except that your toon build really, really matters.
With limited points to spend and ""challenging encounters"" it seems as if there is a certain build type that will work for each toon.
If I am right, and it feels so, then giving me freedom to build 'incorrectly' as is my style of play, means I fail.
With no random encounters to build toons otherwise, it means either re-start and build differently, or follow the guild for builds as in the forum.(There is a forum guide on 'best' builds for your toons.
Seriously, I would prefer auto build if i have that little choice, where certain builds work and others just dont - where you follow the games perfered build or fail.

If you prefer Dark Souls over Elder Scolls or Fallout, then this may well be the game for you, else if you like to play YOUR way, wether it is turtling, over leveling your toons, or just building them the way you want, to play the way you want.. then perhaps stick with games that let you do that.

Combat which you will be doing alot of is bland and repetative. Be prepared to be posioned in alot of battles, also prepare for your spells to fail regardless if you are maxed out in them, For example I had 1 spell called  Cold Shock (Level 18) Maxed in the description I have a 99% chance to cast, in one battle this % drops to 8% with no explaination. This game is not not very forth coming in telling you the negatives that effect you well unless is poison :). 

Magic, What the game does not tell you is with spells that effect all enemies your chances of casting these spells drops to stupid odds... For example in the last few fights in Chapter 5 I was trying to cast a few spells the chance was 1%, please understand I had all my skills maxed regarding spell casting, even reliable spells like the Fireball one was reduced to 48% from 99%. As a whole being a magic user you are punished. Does the enemy get punished in the same way? No they are able to case level 4 spells at 99%.

Storyline, seems non exsistant at the moment and I am on chapter 5 the last chapter, you arent made to care for your choices or characters sorry I like to feel my choices in RPGs actually make a difference.

Skill Trees, again like combat it is bland, if you go melee you want to go for Hammer Blow which forces you to take Two Handed Bashing or Axes and Maces. I did start the game of as dual wielding swords how wrong I was :(. There is very little choices in skills say unlike games like Path of Exile.

The equipment you get is standard and boring. You would expect from a Fantasy RPG to get some magic items well dont hold your breath, there are a few items that will give you the odd boost but they are few and far between.

Overall as a fan of Turn-Based games and RPGs Blackguards comes up short in so many ways.

Die Kämpfe sind schön (teilweise sehr) anspruchsvoll, die Arenen sind sehr abwechslungsreich, und die Anzahl von Items angenehm befriedigend (alle typisch DSA, wie  u.a. der Morionhelm).

And by that I mean the battle map may be unbeatable if you don't figure out which enviornmental trap to use at what time and figuring out how to get the enemy to stand where that trap will be most effective.

While the games tatical battles are quit enjoyable due to this puzzle aspect, at the same time can be frustrating because you can end up spending hours having to try and retry a map to only figure out that in addition to the puzzle you already solved but keep losing at you need to rebalance your attack/parry skill points on your weapon type for the fight in addition to solving the puzzle. Which brings me to the only thing I have come across so far in my play that I have disliked about the game, the combination between having no way to gather more xp since each map seems to be doable only once with the fact that there does not seem to be a way to respec where you allocated your xp. I don't mind that the game does not allow you to grind to over level stuff, infact I like that it prevents you from doing that, but it also means that if you spent all your xp in the wrong areas you can reach a point to where a battle becomes unbeatable because you have all the wrong skills win.  Maybe later in the story it allows you to realocate xp at the cost of gold or something, but currently where I am in the story I can see mismanagment of xp making the game unbeatable.

With that said, despite this one major consern with the games mechanics dealing with xp I would say it is a very enjoyable though sometimes frustrating game. I would say play this game on normal difficulty and if you get stuck on a puzzle don't feel bad having to turn it down to ""easy"", because some battle maps are hard to complete even on easy unless you have the perfect build where no xp was spent in the wrong place. And as I say this game is definitly worth picking up might I just suggest that for a few of the puzzles do not sell your torches even if your close on weight limits because you will come across some puzzles that become 100x easier to solve with having more then just a mage to use fire damage.

・魔法はMPの概念があるが、回復が遅いため（ポーションも高価）乱用できない

I really haven't gotten to invested into the story yet but it is interesting enough.  Visually the game is very pretty and gameplay wise it seems rewarding.

In keeping with the analogy for Dungeons and Dragons, which I use because as a franchise it is one that most people are more familiar with, the Drakensang games were kind of like Neverwinter Nights. This game, by contrast, is more like Temple of Elemental Evil. The game is almost entirely action, incorporating as much of the nuance of the tabletop game as possible, and takes place within a turn based framework, although with the incorporation of an actual hex grid battlemap rather than the approximation thereof. The combat options are numerous and exceptional in variety, with a number of opportunities to interact with the environment lending additional depth to each of the maps. If it has any weakness, it is perhaps that it is too pure; encumberance limits and limits on the skills offered by trainers and the goods offered by merchants seems inconvenient at times. More than once I wished that I had unlocked a skill at character creation that I can no longer find a trainer for once I discovered that one of my abilities lacked the punch that I expected of it.

Mais, cette fois-ci, le studio a fait le choix de s’approcher davantage du jeu de rôle papier en développant un [i]tactical[/i] RPG, ce qui l’éloigne également de son savoir-faire historique, sans pour autant renier cette expérience. Alors, que vaut Blackguards premier du nom ? C’est ce que nous allons voir ensemble. C’est parti ![/b]

La particularité de l’univers de l’œil noir ? Il est sombre, sale, glauque, et les vrais héros sur leur blanc destrier au sourire [i]ultra-bright[/i] n’existent pas (... ou alors il y a un truc salement louche derrière !). J’en veux pour preuve vos compagnons de route : un nain colérique et cupide, un mage flirtant avec le satyriasis, une demi-elfe toxicomane, et un esclave gladiateur psychotique. Quant à vous, après avoir créé votre personnage, vous vous retrouvez en prison, amnésique (... damn !)  après avoir été accusé à tort du meurtre de votre amie et princesse, [i]Eleanor[/i].

En réalité, cette dernière s’est faite dévorer par un mystérieux loup. C’est d’ailleurs dans cette prison que vous ferez connaissance avec deux de vos compagnons de route : [i]Naurim[/i] (le nain) et [i]Zubaran[/i] (le mage). On se retrouve alors de facto sur une alliance de circonstance, avec des bras cassés qui vont bon-gré mal-gré enquêter sur ce meurtre. J’aime.

Pour évoquer rapidement la création du personnage et ses caractéristiques, vous aurez quelques choix sommaires vis-à-vis du [i]look[/i] global de votre avatar, mais également un choix d'archétype parmi la trinité classique : guerrier, mage, et voleur. Il est également possible de faire fi de ces modèles, et de finalement créer le profil que l'on souhaite. Il pourrait être tentant de créer un personnage hybride, tel que voleur / mage, mais je vous le déconseille, car cela n'en ferait qu'un personnage moyen à tous niveaux.

Il faudra donc judicieusement répartir les points disponibles parmi les attributs (force, intelligence, etc...), les armes, les capacités et résistances, la magie, et des compétences liées à la classe du personnage. Améliorer l'une de ces caractéristiques ne pourra se faire qu'avec des Points d'Action, que l'on récupère après un combat. Mais nous ne pourrons pas apprendre n'importe quelles compétences à souhait. En effet, certaines ne seront disponibles qu'à travers un formateur particulier, disponible dans un lieu spécifique.

Les environnements hors-combat sont amenés d’une manière assez intéressante, faisant justement ressortir l’expérience [i]point’n click[/i] de [i]Daedalic[/i]. A travers une carte du monde, vous pourrez vous déplacer d’un lieu à un autre. Vous arriverez alors sur un tableau fixe, où vous retrouverez des interactions avec des objets, des événements, ou des PNJ – voire les trois. Cela pourra éventuellement donner lieu à une quête secondaire non-dénuée d'intérêt. Elles ne sont pas légion, mais permettent d'asseoir une certaine ambiance. A ce sujet, en ce qui concerne les dialogues, ils sont relativement bien écrits, et les doublages ne sont d'ailleurs pas en reste. Quant à l'intrigue, elle est plutôt bien menée, avec un rythme assez lent qui correspond finalement aussi bien au rythme global du jeu, qu'à l'univers qu'il emprunte.

Mais, qu'on se le dise, la principale force de [b]Blackguards[/b] reste ses combats tactiques au tour par tour. On se retrouve sur une grille avec des hexagones, où chaque personnage disposera d'une certaine distance de déplacement. Deux choix s'offrent alors au joueur : se déplacer (ou pas) jusqu'à la limite visible pour ensuite enchaîner avec une action, ou bien de se déplacer plus loin sans possibilité d'agir après. Cette dernière possibilité permet par exemple de pouvoir se mettre à couvert afin de ne pas être trop exposé aux attaques à distance des adversaires. Quant aux actions, il sera tout autant possible d'interagir avec un objet tel qu'un levier pour ouvrir une porte, qu'attaquer les ennemis. Mais, nous aurons différents moyens de passer à l'offensive ; via des compétences d'arme – qu'elles soient de mêlée ou à distance, de la magie, ou bien encore via des objets tels que des bombes aux effets divers et variés.

Une fois le type d'attaque choisi, le curseur de la souris, pointé sur l'ennemi désiré, laissera apparaître le pourcentage de chances de toucher. Ce paramètre varie en fonction de votre maîtrise de l'arme utilisé, ainsi que de la compétence martiale associée, mais également vis-à-vis des défenses et résistances de l'adversaire – sans oublier le fait de savoir s'il est à couvert ou pas. Et les interactions avec les objets ne sont pas en reste ! Pour donner un exemple concret à travers un des premiers tableaux, un lustre est suspendu au dessus d'une pièce ; lorsque vos adversaires passent en dessous, il suffira alors de couper la corde qui le retient pour faire un carnage à peu de frais ; à vous d'éviter les dommages collatéraux en ne laissant pas un de vos personnages dans la zone du piège !

Si vous utilisez de la magie du feu sur un tonneau en bois ou un buisson, ce dernier s'enflammera et pourra provoquer des dégâts lorsque vos ennemis (... ou vous-même !) passeront dessus. Pour rester dans la pyromanie, si lors d'une de vos ballades dans un marais vous croisez un nuage de gaz, vous pourrez l'exploiter afin d'embraser tous ceux qui seront à l'intérieur. Si vous n'arrivez pas à trouver à l’œil nu les différentes interactions disponibles, appuyer sur la touche V les révélera toutes.

Vous l'aurez compris, [b]Blackguards[/b] fourmille d'interactions diverses et variées amenant le jeu sur un plan tactique d'excellente facture. On retrouve également certains objectifs particuliers pendant ces combats : trouver le moyen de délivrer une nana attachée à un poteau, en un certain nombre de tours, avant qu'elle ne soit exécutée. Cela rehausse finalement le [i]challenge[/i] sans que la difficulté n'en devienne rédhibitoire, car il ne s'agit en effet que d'objectifs secondaires. Mais, certains esprits chafouins me rétorqueront que oui, c'est bien beau tout ça, mais il n'y a pas d'exploration, et les choix / conséquences sont franchement [i]lights[/i] !

Le jeu étant composé de tableaux fixes, il n'y a effectivement pas d'exploration possible, mais la curiosité peut parfois amener notre équipe de bras cassés vers des lieux cachés autrement inaccessibles. Quant aux choix et conséquences, il est vrai qu'ils sont relativement [i]lights[/i] et n'iront pas jusqu'à bousculer la trame principale.

On pourrait aussi noter qu'il n'y a pas des tartines de textes à lire au kilomètre, mais encore une fois, l'existant est très bien ficelé, assez pour que j'aie encore envie d'y rejouer.

[b][i]Daedalic Entertainment[/i] a réussi d'une main de maître a concilier son expérience des [i]point'n click[/i] avec son amour de l'univers de l’œil noir pour concevoir un jeu tactique, bien que ce ne soit finalement qu'avec des éléments RPG assez légers. Et en matière de [i]tactical[/i] au tour par tour, il s'en est clairement sorti haut la main, puisque selon la classe de personnage, on se rendra compte de la rejouabilité du titre – plus d'une centaine d'heures au compteur pour ma part.

 + Встречают по одёжке - графика в игре не фотореалистичная, но приятная для глаза.
 + Игра действительно сложная, для меня это плюс: сложное долго не надоедает. Для прохождения на максимальной сложности потребуется И грамотная прокачка, И хорошая тактика. Впрочем, есть и простой режим, в котором при правильной тактике можно протащить практически любых обрубков.
 + Система прокачки - немного переработанная немецкая настолка The Dark Eye. Убраны многие мирные таланты и некоторые заклинания, лимит для всех навыков/аттрибутов установлен на 18, убрана смерть от четырёх ранений (правда не понятно, зачем). То есть развитие персонажа глубокое и вариативное - есть простор для экспериментирования с билдами, хотя о балансе - ниже.
 + Тактические бои действительно являются таковыми. Битва, победа в которой казалась невозможной, при пересмотре тактики окажется лёгкой прогулкой. 9-й бой на арене - идеальный пример.
 + Сюжет как сюжет, не скучный. Обычно я вообще не обращаю на них внимания, но тут действительно было интересно разобраться, что к чему.
 + Персонажи (английская версия) весьма яркие и симпатичные. 
 + Побочных квестов довольно много, хотя и не во всех главах.
 + Оружие и экипировка тоже не в дефиците, есть, из чего выбрать. 
 + За счёт сложности игры и разнообразия вариантов прокачки, переигрывать всё же тянет. Хотя весь серьёзный лут не рандомный.

В пассиве:

 - На момент написания ревью - проблемы с русским языком. Лично я всегда играю на английском, но для кого-то это - очевидный минус.
 - Проблемы с балансом. Хотя игру на максимальной сложности можно пройти минимум 5 принципиально разными билдами + вариации, некоторые из них очевидно превосходят остальные. Зачем они убрали смерть от 4 ранений - не пойму, хоть убей. Впрочем, вероятно, в патчах будут какие-то исправления.
 - Не интуитивный интерфейс, форумы завалены вопросами, наподобие ""кто все эти цифры?"". Некоторые характеристики подразумеваются, но нигде не отражаются. Впрочем, разработчики уверяют, что работают над этим.
 - Баги присутствуют. Но не фатальные, и опять же, будем надеяться, что временные.
 - Мир не настолько открытый, как того хотелось бы. 4 из 5 глав практически линейны, первая - в их числе. 2 из 5, к счастью, 2 самые короткие, линейны совершенно. 
 - По некоторым видам оружия и доспехов всё же наблюдается острый дефицит, либо существующие экземпляры ни на что не годятся.

Este análisis es parcial pues sólo llevo  unas doce horas de juego pero de momento pinta todo muy bien.
Lo primero de todo: SE TRATA DE UNA BETA ESTABLE, JUGABLE Y BALANCEADA, vamos, hoy en día y en steam casi una excepción.
Segundo: hablamos de estrategia por turnos de gestión de escuadrón, mi género favorito y en el único que gasto dinero en productos no rebajados. 
Tercero: es un RPG por turnos de temática fantástica medieval con encuentros absolutamente fijos y marcados y con una buena historia, de las que te hace fijarte en los diálogos. Al ser los encuentros marcados y consecutivos realmente es un juego de estrategia de resolución de escenarios. Hay tres clases (mago, guerrero y ladrón) tú eliges la de tu personaje inicial (hasta ahora te viene con unas skills fijas de inicio que no tuneas hasta que logras XP), el resto que se van incorporando son personajes fijos, NPC que se convierten en PJ tuyos. Los dos primeros que se incorporan (siempre serán estos dos) son un guerrero y un mago (yo, hasta ahora sólo he jugado con este trio, mi PJ, una picara, el guerrero enano y el mago humano).
Cuarto: Hay tres niveles de dificultad, yo directamente he comenzado a probarlo en el más difícil y hay encuentros que son realmente duros. -los primeros pasos son facilones, después se complica. Al ser los encuentros fijos siempre puedes recomenzarlo o repetirlos para enmendar errores cometidos. Realmente cada encuentro es como un puzle con la presencia del factor suerte, algo habitual siempre que hay tiradas de dados, pero lo que te hace ganar o perder es enfocar correctamente la estrategía de cada uno de los encuentros.  Eso resulta muy divertido y retador.
Quinto: El juego tiene unos buenos gráficos, no a nivel del X-COM, pero es de los juegos de estrategia de escuadrón por turnos más cuidados que existen a nivel gráfico. 
Sexto: El tema de mejora de personajes y adquisición de skills (habilidades) está muy  trabajado y es básico para la resolución del juego. Esa es la salsa del juego, lo que puede diferenciar una partida de otra, el como orientar tus personajes y en que talentos y habilidades especializarlos.  Tener muy claro cual va a ser el papel de cada uno en cada encuentro.
Séptimo: Las voces, que son muy buenas, están en inglés, pero ya en la beta hay subtitulación, y francamente buena, al castellano. La banda sonara también está muy cuidada.
Como corolario: Aún tratándose de una beta y siendo por tanto todo análisis parcial, de momento me está pareciendo un juegazo cojonudo y con muchas posiblidades para convertirlo en saga o permitir su desarrollo vía mods. No es un juego de gestión de escuadrón por turnos abierto, está muy guionizado y teledirigido pero cada encuentro tiene mucha chispa,  mucha estratategía y se hace realmente retador, al menos en el modo difícil. Y mucho cuidado al legir en que os gastáis los dineros y como subis el personaje, es importante. 
Disfrutadlo y celebrar que estamos entrando en una nueva edad de oro de los juegos de estrategia por turnos.
PD: Ya voy por el cápitulo 2º en modo difícil y el juego continúa pareciéndome fabuloso.  Una enorme sorpresa.
PD2: Acabado el capítulo 3º, iniciado el 4º, esto sigue siendo una pasada, una aventura de rol clásico como hacía tiempo que no jugaba (desde la épocas de rol de papel o del  primer Dragon Age, el Neverwinter o el Baldurs, rol del bueno y además con combate por turnos). Lo estoy ""gosando como una perra"".  Sigo en modo difícil, porque me da vidilla y me supone un reto. Algún combate lo tengo que replantear hasta dos o tres veces, un par incluso cuatro veces, pero siempre acabas encontrando la táctica adecuada, de verdad que me está pareciendo un juego con muy buenas mecánicas.

EPÍLOGO: Terminado en modo difícil todo el juego. El último capítulo es duro de pelar con rivales jodidos de verdad pero siempre hay un modo de lograrlo (aunque a veces el modo puede llegar a consistir en que la AI no tome la mejor decisión). Me ha gustado mucho, reconozco que no es un juego para todos los paladares, al menos en modo difícil  es un juego para estrategas veteranos, con paciencia para probar el ensayo/error y capacidad de análisis del tablero. Vuelvo a repetir que lo he disfrutado un montón y que no me importa para nada la linealidad de la historia (es un modo de plantear un juego como otro cualquiera) ni lo limitado de las cinemáticas. Espero que saquen segundas partes u otros juegos ambientados en ese sistema/mundo.

the good
1)  turn based combat, for me a plus. 
2)  not totally idiot IA, sometimes  battles could be rough..
3)  by now nice story, not something to drop jaw but solid.
4)  for a beta they worked a lot and well.. 
5)   items cost, and one have to sweat to gain them 
the bad
1) almost no exploration, (would be perfect normal movement on maps and hex only for combat, is a nice world and the way is implemented is  a bit simplicistic.. (a mix between this and eg baldurs gate would be the perfect game for me) .

2) by now only 3 char to choose, and by now (remembering is a beta) few customization.

A game to buy at a fair price, hope Daedalic will continue on this road, maybe watching a bit  the past glory, (black isle/obsidian/bioware)  to catch the good of them and put the  good work they have done by now.

Так оно и оказалось: 

1. Игра русифицированна, мягко говоря, плохо. Ну, я и не ожидал, что все будет замечательно, так что вопросов к проекту по этмоу пункту у меня нету.

2. Оптмизирована игрушка тоже не ахти как хорошо. FPS только так проседает до 10-14 единичек  (при высоких настройках). И это при том, что картинка пока что не очень-то радует глаз. Надеюсь, что когда полноценный продукт будет выпущен, эту проблему решат.  

3. Сама механика игры (ее тонкости), как это практически всегда во всех ролевых проектах, сокрыта от глаз пользователей. К сожалению, с ходу нельзя понять, на какой именно характеристике завязан тот или иной параметр (то же ""Уклонение"" и ""Вероятность попадания по врагу"", к примеру). Процесс постижения игрового процесс затрудняется еще и тем, что много  подсказок и разъяснительной информации - на английском языке. Хорошо, что я более-менее понимаю этот язык, а как быть тем, кто не знает английского? 

4. Сам игровой процесс не вызывал каких-либо особых нареканий или восхищений. Типичная стандартная РПГ, со своими особенностями и нюансами. Из плюсов стоит отметить, что во время сражений вашим персонажам иногда надо не только тупо или искусно поубивать недругов, но и выполнить какие-нибудь обязательные или попобчные требования. К примеру, надо закрыть люки, откуда лезут какие-то твари, именуемые каменными вшами (вроде так их обозвали разработчики?) или открыть решетки и выпустить заключенных на волю. 

Что немного озадачило? 

Маг может одномоментно поддерживать только одно заклинание типа ""Стена"". Это, конечно, ""здорово"", если учесть, что это заклинание держится лишь два хода - раз, во-вторых, сотворить его мой волшебник мог лишь с 75% вероятностью. Спорное решение, на мой взгляд, усложняющее процесс убиение жирных боссов по типу древесного тролля. Впрочем, сколько разработчиков - столько у них и видений того, как должен быть устроен игровой процесс.

О сюжете что-либо сказать сложно. Вот выйдет игра, тогда и можно будет делать какие-то выводы. Пока что можно лишь отметить достаточно грамотно сделанную завязку, где перед игроком ставится ряд вопросов, на которые он должен найти ответы. 

Интерфейс на открытых локациях и в городах - стандартный. А вот интерфейс, связанные с боем, можно было бы сделать и получше.  Так, для совершения какого-либо особого действия надо кликать правой кнопокй мышки по противнику, дабы выдвинулось специальное круговое меню. Потом тыкать левой кнопкой мышки по одному из пунктов этого игрокового меню (""Навыки"" или ""Заклинания"" - аж три пункта по магии, если не ошибаюсь). Потом выбирать нужный тебе навык или заклинание. Не проще ли было сделать стандартную панельку внизу или сбоку экрана со всеми навыками, благо их не так уж много у персонажей??? Тыкнул мышкой по значку навыка на панельке - кликнул затем по врагу или точке локации, на которую хочешь оказать то же магическое воздействие, и готово! 

Рекомендовать ли эту игру или не рекомендовать? Честно говоря, я затрудняюсь с ответом. Чего-то особенного такого я не увидел, но и сказать, что проект провальный - не могу.

There are parts that need tightening up, like seeing the console commands on screen, but aside from that it's been a smooth experience for me.

The story is interesting, the world is intriguingly dark and the characters, so far, are all interesting (my favourite being Niam the crackheaded half elf). Combat plays out on small, hex based maps that keep the action from getting bogged down or boring. And, while in combat, that's all you focus on; you can't loot corpses, for example. All of that happens afterwards which I like a LOT. 

The combat system is simple, really, but it works. There are enough special abilties to keep it all interesting and to give you a wide variety of tactics (at least when you get the right people to suit your style) but they're not exactly trying to break the mold here. Basically, you've probably seen this all before. It didn't bother me, but I could see it boring some people.

The graphics do their job, though they're nothing to write home about. The voice acting has been surprisingly good for the main characters, although I find the NPCs tend to fall into stereotypes (villains sound like they're about to go ""NYAH I'M EVIL""). It's not really distracting, since their lines are short and to the point, but it was something I noticed so take that as you will.

Which is really the best way to sum up this game; to the point. There are side quests and the like, but this isn't an open world game like Skyrim where you can spend a fair amount of time just walking around. You move from battle to battle, taking breathers when you need/want them, and then get right back into the thick of it. It is for this reason that I recommend this game. It's fast, fun but not short.

As an avid RPG player, and one who is all about story, I hold any RPG story I play to a high standard. Daedalic have been great storytellers in the past and blackguards is no different. The game is dark and mature, just what I like. Often in RPG's the more morally grey characters are the most enjoyable, relate-able and overall liked characters of a given game. In Blackguards this the type of characters you play, instead of a group of moral paragons, you play a band of rogues, trying to get by in the world and dealing with events that have been thrust upon them.

You start the game as your chosen character hovering above the corpse of princess Elenor who is being eaten by a wolf, after killing said wolf you are blamed for her death, but the strange thing is, you can't quite remember what exactly happened before you saw the wolf. After being tortured and being questioned for a name you know nothing about. Enter the fire loving, fight craving, elf hating dwarf Naurim and you’re soon on a prison break with the intention of finding out just what the hell is going on here.

The Battles in blackguards are very addictive, they tend to be relatively short but by no means easier. The great thing about blackguards combat is its difficulty, some battles require real thought and careful planning. The game is very challenging but by no means overly difficult and while it can be unforgiving at times, the game auto-saves after every battle and even if you die you have the option to start the battle over at any point from the pause menu. Fans of tactical turn based Rpgs will really get a kick out of the challenge blackguards provides. One of the star features of combat is the interactive environments. In certain levels you will have objects placed around that you can use. You can cut a rope causing the hanging chandelier to crush the enemies below it, ignite flammable swamp gas to burn opponents and more. There are over 190 beautifully crafted battlefields in blackguards, these are no mere random maps, these are hand drawn, carefully thought out maps that not only feel unique but really leave a lasting impression. 

If your an RPG fan, a turn based strategy fan or you just love a bloody good story, I cannot recommend blackguards enough. It is one of those rare games that I literally lost track of time playing. The story telling is good and engaging. Battles while not lengthy have great solid mechanics and good depth to them. The world is fantastically immersive, Daedalic have envisioned southern Aventuria beautifully. Check out the full video review for a more in depth look.

Some games do a very good job of designing a variety of difficulty levels so that anyone can play them at whatever level of difficulty they want to. (ex: The King's Bounty Games, the Witcher games, and the Elder Scrolls series.) some - like this one - do not.

Pros:

- The gameplay is something completely new to me, never played a game like it
- The fighting in the game is well-balanced
- Very large character customization system, plenty of skills and such to choose from
- The game is already awesome, even in its early access state.

Cons:

First of all I really enjoy the game even if I sometimes feel the desire to hammer the game against a wall.
Classes: 
-Mage
I've started as a Mage and even if it is really frustrating at the beginning, because your spells miss all the time (one 7times in a row...(This needs to be fixed!)), at the end of chapter one I have no clue how you would survive without having main char mage + the story-mage that joins your party. The story-mage is even worse at castin than your main-char and sometimes next to useless but for a few heals now an than...if he manages to cast them...My main char-mage now casts some spells with 99% accuracy but I'm not really sure why this improved...
-Warrior
So far my warrior is pretty useless besides sucking up damage, of course this is his main aim at the moment, but it is still frustrating that just 1 out of 5 attacks succed because the parring/evasion rate of most enemies is pretty high.
So far my warrior only fought with axe and shield, so maybe that's just an unfortunate combination.
-Archer
Nothing much to say here, I think this class is pretty good balanced at the moment, or a bit too good if Mage/warrior are taken as standard.

A few pros and cons:
-Until chapter one the game is quite linear, besides a few flashbacks. You can't explore any areals or wander around between cities you just leap from to the other most of the time.
-I really like the difficulty of the game, even though I'm playing on ""normal"" is quite demanding at times, but as mentioned above it's a bit up to luck in hard mission weather you succed or not depending on if you miss the first few hits or not...
-I would really like it if after you explored a city there would be a Sign above the city on the world map indicating what kind of trainer you found in this city, because otherwise you got to go through the cities to find them again.
-The skilling system is nice but sometimes a bit annoying because I don't know when I'll find the next trainer or which skills he can teach me so I end up not really knowing where to invest my points.

I'd like to state again that I think it's a great game despite a few issues and I'm having quite a lot of fun playing it.

The first thing I have to say about this is I really, really like these types of games. I really enjoy games like Fire Emblem & Onimusha Tactics on the GBA and XCOM on the PC, which are specifically turn-based games. Blackguards also gives me the vibe/atmosphere of old school RPG games I love like Baldur's Gate I & II, Path of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights + expansions + mods (The old bioware game, not that new MMO). While the games I just listed are not turn based, they do have pause button tactics, and they share the fantasy setting and RPG skill allocation, feats, that sort of thing. The most recent game of this genre was Dragon Age Origins but it has been a while since that came out. To me , Blackguards feels like a true merger of those two types of games I listed above, the action is turn-based, but the environment and customization is very much just like old school RPG.

Anyway, since then, I have been waiting for another game to grab my attention the same way all these massive titles did. I decided to pick up Blackguards, and I will admit that I was scared because it was Early Access. I will tell you now this game has not disappointed me in the slightest, even though it is Early Access. The characters are fun, the gameplay is exactly what I wanted. I have to say they won me over pretty quickly. I wrote down a few pros/cons that were most apparent for me.

Pros:
-I personally love the turn-based gameplay/combat system
-Nice artwork and environments
-Plenty of voiced dialog
-Fun characters  
Cons:
-Kind of easy even on hard difficulty, but I like these types of games so.....yea
-Graphics are a tad dated so this might bother some
-Some features are kind of buggy but it is still Early Access so calm down (using bandages ect...)
-I would like some cooler / more tiered armors and weapons
-Seeing the reference tags on characters/objects is distracting
-No in depth character customization (but it is to be added later!) 

Verdict: 
YES pick it up, if it is on sale (erm Winter Holiday Flash sale) even better. This is a fun game to play even early access. I am glad I did it and I think the RPG community will come together to love it.

Trully an amazing rpg, the story is great as well which is a huge plus as story kills games for me, if they are bad. 
Pros- Incredible RPG aspects
Lots of costumization aspects
Lots of equipment(weapons,armor, ect) 
Fun spells that make you feel rewarded
Lots of fun, difficulties are perfectly tuned
Story is actually really good, with lots of fun twists. 

Cons- Some of the technical aspects of the game still need work, such as the mouse isn't locked on the screen, so playing this game if you have multiple monitors is a pain, as you constantly have your mouse go off to the other screen. 
I would like a few more ranged weapons
Some battles are a bit repetitive and could be done with out. (though this is minor overall)

Теперь это официально очень средняя игра. Я почти угадал оценку на метакритике. На самом деле, по справедливости должно быть 60-65 баллов, но Daedalic очень любит прикармливать игровую прессу.

Что игра она себя представляет? Это смесь (можно так сказать? - наверное нет), адвенчуры и РПГ с походовой боевой системой. Или если проще - РПГ для ленивых. Здесь не нужно шаро****ться по карте в поисках врагов/лута/подземелий. Весь путь прокладывается на карте и отряд мгновенно оказывается в нужном месте, где следует катсцена с диалогами и затем (опционально) бой. В городах игра становится похожа на серию Аллоды - нашему взору открывается панорама населенного пункта с несколькими интерактивными зонами, куда можно заглянуть, ткнув мышкой (кузнец, таверна, кладбище и проч.) В общем, голимый фаст-трэвел.

Боевая система  проста как колун, без наворотов, типа ""ударить в определенную часть тела"" или заходов с фланга, но даже в таком виде несколько нелогична и расфокусирована. Авторы настаивают на испльзовании ландшафта и интерактивных предметов окружения , но ты редко с первого раза определишь, как поведет себя персонаж на том или ином участке поля. Действительно интересных ситуациий в бою почти нет. Одна сплошная рутина. Находишь какой-то самый дамажистый скилл - его и прожимаешь всю дорогу. 
Для сравнения, если хотите свежий пример удачной реализации походовой боевки - это The Banner Saga.

Тоже можно сказать про квесты. В родословной значится - РПГ, но говорил Костик в ""Покровских воротах"", искусство по-прежнему в большом долгу. Здесь есть только ролевая система, а интересные ветвящиеся квесты будут уже разве что в следующих проектах студии. А пока они набивают руку. Поэтому - рутина. 
 
Только диалоги и персонажи достойны сдержанной похвалы, кстати главного героя (охотника) похоже озвучивает тот же актер, что озвучивал Хоука в Dragon Age 2. Да и сюжет, в принципе не столько банален. 

Резюме: странный неудавшийся эксперимент по скрещиванию адвенчуры, РПГ и еще чего-то. Что ж, немцы с 40-го года любят ставить жуткие опыты. Я купил игру только из-за походовой тактики, но даже ее умудрились сделать нудной. В общем, немцы.",1387890740,1390602589,False,71,0,0.64266592264175415,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Auf jeden Fall ist das Spiel ein ""must have"" für jeden DSA Fan ;)

Nachtrag: So da das Spiel nun vor ein paar Wochen veröffentlicht wurde erstelle ich nun ein zweites Review über das Game:

Das Spiel treibt einem, umso weiter man kommt, immer mehr zur Frust, die Gegner weichen und blocken mit leichtigeit die Attacken meiner Gruppe aus und ab, ausserdem treffen sie meine Gruppe genauso gut wie sie eben meine Attacken ausweichen, obwohl ich so manche Fertigkeiten schon auf Stufe 18 habe und obwohl ich auch schon die Talente Körperbeherschung und Selbstbeherschung auf 18 habe fallen meine Leute um wie die Fliegen, also das Balancing stimmt momentan ganz und gar nicht, wie soll man da gewisse Missionen die eine Rundenvorgabe haben schaffen ? 

..... auch die langen Ladezeiten nerven, vor allem wenn man sich in größeren Städten von einen Stadtteil zum nächsten begibt, hängt man eine Gefühlte Ewigkeit im Ladescreen, das nervt vor allem wenn man schnell von einem Stadtteil in den nächsten will um dort eine Quest abzuschließen oder bei dem Händler etwas kaufen möchte ....

.. auch die Itemsauswahl ist seher klein, man findet kaum was besseres, mein Zwerg und mein Zauberer laufen immer noch mit ihreren gleichnamigen Items rum ... 

.. und die Gefährtenaufteilung/Wahl ist auch schlecht durchdacht, man verliert im Laufe des Spiels einen sehr guten Begleiter und dieser wird dann durch eine sehr sehr nutzlose, schwache ""Hexe"" ersetzt, hier wär mir eine freie Begleitauswahl ala Dragon Age, Mass Effekt oder Drakensang  bei weitem lieber und auch Sinnvoller gewesen .....


... wie ich am Anfang schon sagte ist das Spiel nicht so schlecht, aber es braucht halt noch ein paar Updates um es Spielbarer zu machen, ich bin auf jeden Fall noch gespannt was da noch kommen wird, falls dies nun alles schon geweisen sein sollte, sollte man das Spiel nur dann kaufen wenn man ein großer DSA Fan ist und man auf Herausforderungen steht ;D",1387663690,1392057048,False,3,0,0.407908469438552856,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Once again, I really enjoy the gameplay. X-Com fans will appreciate the turn based strategy. My earlier concerns regarding the limitations of the trainer system which inhibited true freedom in character development have been lessened however. I still would prefer true freedom to spend my experience points, but the additional content gives you plenty of fights and quests with which to expand your characters, as well as more trainers with the important abilities available to train for. If you are looking for cool loots though, prepare to be disappointed. The emphasis is really more on the characters themselves. As you progress through the story, upgrades of weapons that are marginally better are available, but using merchants to upgrade your characters gear doesn't really feel as fun as beating some monsters or bad guys and finding a cool weapon or magic item.

Overall, I feel the additional content pushes this game from 'not recommended' to 'recommended'. I am particularly excited for when they add more depth to character creation, as this will allow me to pick some starting skills that will more coincide with how I want to build my character. For example, warriors start with the skill that improves your attack when using a shield. If you want to build a 2-Hand sword wielding warrior, this skill is just a waste.

Also this game shows several great ideas and aspects I am missing in many other games. Interactive environment (Cut a rope so a chandelier smashes some guards), diverging story lines, and the possibility to fail (sometimes) and still continue with your story.

И хотя (на данный момент) готовы только две главы, местами встречаются досадные баги, уже сейчас, даже если ничего больше не добавится и не выйдет игра сверкает как бриллиант.
Когда то давно, в 1993 году, два тогдашних гранда игровой индустрии, Dynamix и Sierra Online, выпустили не побоюсь этого слова, шедевр - Betrayal at Krondor. С тех пор выходило много РПГ, но все же лично меня, ничто так не брало за душу как BaK. Да, были замечательные Baldur's Gate, NeverWinter Nights и Icewind Dale, были великолепные Dragon Age и Ведьмак (последний правда выбивается из списка типом боя). Все эти игры (и многие другие) были сделаны на отлично, и все же я тосковал по BaK.
И вот, впервые за эти годы мне попалась игра, которая чем то напомнила мне BaK (не в точности, а скорее духом). Что же можно отметить в Blackguards и что почти сразу бросается в глаза (перечисляю в случайном порядке):
1. Музыка - просто отлично, создает определенную, я бы сказал, мрачноватую, атмосферу.
2. Диалоги (только не ставьте русский язык, перевод пока что убог до безобразия), интонациии. Сделаны на 5, зачастую даже зная что герои скажут (при повторном просмотре) все равно слушаешь - так хорошо сделано.
3. Сюжет - интересный, но пока нет всей игры полное мнение составить сложно. Отдельно стоит сказать про боковые (побочные) квесты. Почти все мне понравились разнообразием, и хотя в конце каждый такой квест может сводиться к банальному бою, но сделано и срежиссировано это так органично, что и не замечаешь, что по сути это те же поди принеси и поди убей.
4. Система боя. Очень хороша. Заставляет шевелить извилинами, иногда даже весьма и весьма. На форуме после выхода первой главы были крики - дескать очень сложно, разработчики - порежьте сложность! Но справедливости ради стоит отметить, что это как раз один из главных плюсов игры. Потому что, чтобы победить в очередном бою, надо не просто кликать мышкой, а еще и хорошенько подумать перед боем (если вам не повезло и вас таки убили и пришлось загружать сейв) и решить как тактически победить данного врага(ов).
5. Экипировка, расход бутылок, стрел, ограничение на перенос тяжестей и на ношение магами железа добавляют сложностей, а точнее специфики к системе боя, заставляя игрока и тут включать мозги.
6. Атмосфера. Все вышеперечисленное  создает замечательную атмосферу игры. Бывают игры, где все вроде бы сделано на очень высоком уровне, а вот атмосферы либо вообще нет, либо с ней туго. В Blackguards она не просто есть, она великолепна.

Не написал ничего про графику, так как сказать что она очень хороша я не могу, но лично мне она кажется сделанной на вполне достаточном уровне.

Могу порекомендовать игру всем кто любит РПГ, кто любит думать, кому нравятся интересные сюжеты и атмосферные игры, и конечно тем кому нравятся пошаговые бои.",1385719806,1385719806,True,448,1,0.916543662548065186,26,True,False,False,False,,,

Blackguards is the first Early Access game i really want to recommend!
First it´s quite well developed already (but surely not without some roughness, especially regarding balancing, texting and bugs), second
because they did two things very well:

Second it actually is a good game in the Realms of Arkania/Das Schwarze Auge universe, since the last ones (Demonicon, Schicksalsklinge HD) were poorest crap.
Secondary it brings a new genre to this rpg system - the strategy (yeah i know, they also did two adventures already, but imo adventure and rpg are not that different).

Also they try to bring a bit of a more grey atmosphere to the normally strictly black and white world of Arkania, you play as a convicted murderer, your party also consists of the strangest fellows like addicts, fanatics and so on.
Though this all Daedalic manages to stay true to the typical rpg feeling as well as presents it with quite some bit of humour as well.
You are somewhat limited in creating your character (three classes only, race and sex are fix) but the skill system (which represents the RoA rules surprisingly well) offers quite some flexibility to process all the characters the further the game progresses.
This mixture of freedom and linear story telling, continues throughout the game, while you visit the locations to progress the main storyline, you have always some options for side quests, which offer a variety of goals.

The battles themself remind me for one of Expeditions:Conquistador, where cover and strategically well placement of your characters is as important as choosing the right means of attack.
They also try to keep the battles different with traps, different obstacles as well as victory conditions.

As the game is still in development i can´t ultimately write about the story, but so far the characters are well done and the development is quite interesting.
So if you either like the realms of arkania universe or are a strategy fan, you can give this one a try.


Update:
In the full version Daedalic has implemented kind of free character generation, since many players wanted this and not only the pre made classes.

Well.. the plus is, Daedalic tried to give the fans what they wanted..
the minus is that they implemented it very half heartedly, it´s an ugly, short creation process, with nearly no explanation about classes or whatever (the only choosing here is a single mage yes/no button?!)
Also you kinda notice that the game was made with a hunter class in mind, if you create some very different hero, you may not find the best stuff/make the most out of it.

Also i still get some stuttering issues/cut off ends of cut scenes, so they didn´t improve this much.

All in all, this may be small points, but they damper a good first impression..",1385558238,1391602875,True,193,0,0.775359511375427246,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Kein kilometerlanges Rumgelatsche (wie in TES) und keine USA Style Fantasy (wie in Dragon Age)

It still needs some polish, but it is very impressive at its current stage. The characters, while not very deep during Chapter 1 (only chapter available yet, of 5), are still very fun and you get a good sense of their personalities through their dialogue and opinions on the situations. I see a lot of potential with this game. The combat can be a little shallow at the moment, ending up with just moving across the battlefields and attacking/healing as necessary, but I also have not acquired many of the bountiful skills available. Plenty of skills available, but the game does not hold your hand; acquiring and saving the necessary points is definitely part of the challenge and not unwelcome. While it definitely isn't paced to have you being dragonslayers within the first few hours, it isn't overly difficult either. A few battles required multiple tries from me, but only because I was trying to reach bonus objectives in the alloted time. I've burnt through other SRPGs and got bored within the first few hours of playing, but this game has just enough flavor and interest to keep me coming back to the well for more. It is not a AAA title by any means, but an impressive soundtrack, very believable voice-acting and dialogue, and earnest, hard work prove to be more than any flash and bang a mainstream title would use. Once again, very impressed with the quality of this product. I am in it for the longhaul now, and very interested to see where this (and possible future titles) go.
