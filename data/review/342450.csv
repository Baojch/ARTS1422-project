[i] Sword Daughter - классическая визуальная новелла от разработчика Hanabira. Игра вышла в Steam в феврале 2015 года и на данный момент имеет смешанные отзывы, с преобладанием отрицательных. Давайте разберемся, стоит ли в это играть? [/i]

[u] [b] ПРЕДЫСТОРИЯ [/b] [/u]

Для начала, важно отметить что Sword Daughter является адаптацией книги-игры, вышедшей еще в 80-ых годах прошлого века. Бережно отнесясь к оригиналу, авторы перенесли все что смогли на новые рельсы, добавив музыки и доработав арт-составляющую. С работой 80-ых я, разумеется, не знаком, и сравнивать особо не с чем, поэтому сужу об игре с позиций собственного опыта визуальных новелл. 

[u] [b] СЮЖЕТ [/b] [/u]

История начинается от лица Тирны, молодой леди, чей отец занимает, по всей видимости, весьма высокопоставленную должность. Не имея сына, он принимает решение воспитывать ""по-спартански"" собственную дочь, и та со временем вырастает в неплохого бойца. Способности Тирны оказываются настолько хороши, что папаня решает повести дочурку на Соревнование Бойцов, которое проводится раз в несколько (десятков) лет. И, конечно, чтобы добраться до этих соревнований, нужно традиционно преодолеть большую и страшную дорогу по безжизненной пустоши, где нет ничего, кроме сплошных бед и опасностей. На этой жизнеутверждающей ноте без лишних спойлеров переходим к геймлпею.

[u] [b] ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ [/b] [/u]

Действие Sword Daughter происходит в мире классического фэнтези. Игровой процесс представляет собой визуальную новеллу в самом классическом смысле слова. Сюжет ведет нас по своей траектории, периодически останавливая на важных развилках истории. От принятых нами решений будет зависеть дальнейший исход событий и набор персонажей, с которыми предстоит столкнуться. Всего на выбор представлено 25 концовок, при этом некоторые решения могут привести к одинаковому исходу. 

[u] [b] ОСОБЕННОСТИ [/b] [/u]

В игре имеется функция сохранения момента, однако, по сути, в ней нет большой необходимости. Дело в том, что в главном меню присутствует одна весьма полезная опция - ""Сюжетная Карта"". Перейдя по клику, мы видим всю сетку сюжетных ходов, где открыты уже пройденные нами решения, и показаны скрытые, те, что нам еще только предстоит принять. На самом деле это очень удобная система, которая не только избавляет от необходимости плодить кучу сейвов, но также весьма наглядно показывает, ГДЕ именно момент был упущен. 

Большинство отрицательных отзывов на ""Дочь..."" вменяют игре в минус отсутствие хоть каких-либо изюминок, новшеств или оригинальных идей. По сути, да - здесь вас ждет идея визновеллы как она есть, можно сказать, в голом виде. Никаких статов, хитромудрых механик или чего-то, что заставило бы Вас планировать действия на много шагов вперед. Но лично мое мнение, что подобное не стоит того, чтобы опускать отзыв до красных значений. 

А вот о чем действительно стоит предупредить с порога, так это о ""женской"" направленности игры. Разработчики, как ни крути, рассчитывали на аудиторию, прежде всего, состоящую из представительниц прекрасного пола. Это видно и по смазливо-прилизанным портретам мужских персонажей, и по самому сюжету и роли в ней героев. К слову, основным спутником главной героини будет белокурый эльф на белом коне. И чувствам Тирны к этому эльфу будет уделено немало внимания по сюжету. В общем, я предупредил. 

[u] [b] СТОИТ ЛИ ИГРАТЬ? [/b] [/u]

На полное прохождение Sword Daughter с выбиванием ВСЕХ ачивок у меня ушло 3 часа. Достижений в игре всего 15, но выдаются они весьма странным образом - при некоторых вариантах прохождения Вы можете не получить ни одной, а иной раз соберете по 2-3 буквально за одно принятое решение. ИМХО все же лучше было бы сопоставить ачивки с концовками, но автору виднее. Рисовка в ""Дочери Меча"" весьма приятная, хоть и не слишком разнообразна. Музыка средняя, как-то не сильно запомнилась. Русского языка в игре нет, и, естественно, чтобы получить удовольствие, заморской мовой необходимо владеть хотя бы на среднем уровне. Русификатора в сети мною замечено не было. Без скидки Sword Daughter имеет ценник 133р., и это тот случай, когда я советую дождаться распродажи, где почти наверняка потратите не больше 20р.

TL;DR is game pretty but bad, 3/10

I like both visual novels and choose your own adventure stories, so I figured that despite the mixed reviews this one got I'd still be pretty happy with it. I was wrong. It's not completely terrible and it's obvious that some real work went into it based on the fantastic art and suitable music, but what starts as an interesting story quickly falls apart when you realise just how short a single playthrough can be. I finished my first run in about 20 minutes, with making some mistakes and having to retry some choices, and when I did finish it I was left immensely unfulfilled, as if I'd seen a single episode of an anime expecting more only to be told ""Nope, that's it for these characters."" Clearly the intent was to have the player keep replaying it and discover every single ending to make up an appropriate amount of in game time for the price tag, but after getting 8 of them and learning that many contain the same scenes and dialogue (more so than most CYOA titles I've played) I think it'd be a mind numbing slog to push through all the content this game does have. After letting it idle long enough to get my last card drop, I think I'll be done with it. I will say though, that for the CYOA portions there was a nice element of suspense whenever you found yourself in a new situation.

It certainly doesn't help that the romance angle is somewhat flawed at best, and not just for how quickly the two characters seem to fall in love. I thought it was weird but alright given the short length per playthrough up until I got an ending that made me realise just how awful Gavin really is. He went from lonely outcast in need of a friend to weird guy who thinks he's entitled to a tradwife but has put no effort into being someone that any woman would like, let alone the one of his dreams. Furthermore, he seems to be taking advantage of a naive teenage girl who's just lost her only surviving parent and I think he knows it. I wouldn't be surprised to find out he watched her while she slept for a while before waking her up. The guy is a creep, plain and simple. There's no real way to tell him no either, which is gross.

Another big issue I have with this is the fact that our heroine, the woman warrior who some of us are excited to play as, is quickly made into a supporting character while Gavin gets to be the star and does all the cool stuff. That's not even close to empowering, which an experience like this should be. She's also presented as extremely one dimensional and boring with no personality to speak of. This game misses the mark pretty badly all around in my opinion, with it's few highlights not being nearly enough to outweigh all the bad. Might be worth it when it's on sale for the achievements and trading cards, but otherwise don't bother.",1619700026,1619700026,False,6,1,0.524746477603912354,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Reluctantly joining you on your quest for vengeance, you both get in way more trouble than you could have ever anticipated. 

While there are multiple endings, an awful lot of them are very similar with copy/paste dialog. The music was nothing special and the story has so many holes it might actually be swiss cheese.

I liked that it was easy to go back and forth between the various story lines to try to see the different outcomes, without having to resort to a guide/walkthrough in order to see everything.

What could have made the game better? 
Several aspects of the game could have been better. 
[list][*]The summary map didn't appear to be laid out in a specific order, that I could tell. The only other game that I ever saw provide this branching story view actually mapped it like a tree, which I think was ideal (but may not have worked well for this game, as there are a few diverging choices that will eventually lead to the same endings). 
[*]Bad endings? Overall, there were really only 3 out of 22 endings that were ""bad"" endings. Most ended on either a good or neutral note. There were a few choices that I made that I fully expected to lead to a bad ending, and then...it just didn't. 
[*]Too much romance. I liked the really well done, longer story arcs where I felt that the friendship between the characters was building. However, one of the first endings I got, they were still in the desert, not far from where he'd found her, and the ending [spoiler] already left off at Gavin pledging he cared for her and wanted to keep her safe. Of all the story lines, all of them hint at fast-developing feelings between the two of them, and in only one ending do they go their own way, if they didn't die.[/spoiler] I really did enjoy their interactions, and even the more romantic pieces in the longer narratives, but in a few places, where the story ends quickly, it felt too forced.

And now that I've found it again, well... I can finally make my review of it.

Sword Daughter places you in the role of Tyrna, a young woman who is traveling with her father, a great general, to participate in a competition/games alongside him.  However... disaster strikes, and a rampaging horde of orcs end up attacking the caravan, slaughtering everything and everyone within it- except for our valiant heroine, who is struck on the head by a stray weapon blow. 

Coming to, she finds herself rescued by Gavin, a half-elf ranger who happened to be patrolling nearby, and apparently-

No.  I can't go on like this, not any longer.  I can't hold back the review I really want to do for this game.

This game, this VN... is absolute garbage.  If you're looking to buy it simply based upon the fact the main character is a badass female warrior, well... you don't get to show many of your skills off.  In fact, 90% of the time, pulling out your sword is a terrible idea, and will get you hurt, killed, or some other terrible thing happening to you.  So what are you supposed to do, in this story, if not to fight?

If you've ever played Pathfinder or D&D with a female player/character at the table, and ever run into one of those guys who immediately start trying to convince her that they shouldn't be rushing into combat, that they should just be in the back and maybe even reroll as a healer or mage if they're going to insist on playing (with a high charisma score so he can hit on them), and that no matter what they should consult with him first because he'll show them how to make their character amazing?  And by the way, his character constantly protects and shows off and can't shut up about how she should just listen to him because she's not cut out to be frontline or even have a say in what she does except if it's to fall in wuv with him?

Yep.  Gavin is like super-concentrated That Guy.

The ways to the ""good"" endings are simple- you bow your head and you listen to whatever Gavin tells you to do.  If he tells you that women aren't meant to play with weapons and be warriors, you're supposed to listen to him and go home to learn how to be a dutiful housewife- there's even an ending where he throws Tyrna over his shoulder and implies he's going to imprison her in his home so he and his mother can ""teach"" her what her place truly is- his loving waifu, because girls shouldn't be warriors.

Yep.  This book was apparently based off a CYOA-style book from the early 80s, and boy, does it sure read like it, to its enormous detriment.

No matter what you do- if you try to sneak into a camp?  Gavin does it better and he's the one to do all the fighting.  If you try to fight the orc that killed your father?  Nope, Gavin gets to go in and do it and be all flashy and impressive so he can show Tyrna she should rather be a housewife so he can wuv and protect her.   There is an ending where you can go kill the orc that killed your father, but does Tyrna find grim satisfaction in a job done so her father can rest?

Nope.  Gavin gets all grumpy and whiny, Tyrna ends up feeling nothing but sick to her stomach because vengeance leaves her with a foul taste in her mouth and a terrible feeling in her heart, and she hitches a ride to the next city or wherever with what's left of the caravan while realizing that maybe Gavin was right and she should have listened to the extremely hot elf a lot more, and I think she gives up her career as a warrior.

I think there's just one ending to this game that doesn't leave an absolutely terrible taste in my mouth:

As you adventure through the caves with Gavin, you can end up stumbling across Slag, an ancient blue dragon chained in place by someone or something.  Now, normally, you listen to Gavin and try to double-team the ancient dragon (which turns into him grabbing you and Gavin- of course- busting out leet moves and soloing the ancient dragon without you lifting a finger- no, I'm serious, he solos the ancient evil dragon with a silver sword)- but in an offshoot ending, you can agree to a deal with Slag to allow you to survive- you undo his chains, and go off with him to destroy the surrounding countryside while getting to sport some pretty nice armor.

As for positives?  Well, the art is nice, and the script is clean and free of errors, but... that's about it.  And it's only a five-spot in price, and short enough that you can burn through this turd-pile in less than two hours so you can 100% it and send it back for a refund, and all you're out is the soul-crushing hour you wasted playing this trashheap- and it goes on sale occasionally so your outlay is usually less than that.

The real shame of this game is that Hanako Games is also the maker of such games as the Magical Diary series, which just launched a sequel (Wolf Hall), and as of today (2/19/2020), the original Magical Diary game, which ALSO has a female MC, is less than this pile of garbage.

It refers to the player character, Tyrna, even though she's just a side character in the adventures of dreamy half-elf Gavin. In the first route I found, they have about two conversations, both of which have Tyrna saying that she wants to go get revenge for her father and is annoyed that Gavin's saying it's too dangerous, and then Tyrna bumps her head and Gavin says ""I'm taking you to my home"" and they kiss. Ugh.
Every route that doesn't end with Tyrna dying or being cursed, ends with her hooking up with Gavin, no matter how little sense it makes. If you say you'll go on without him, he'll stalk you and show up a paragraph later like this was his idea all along. If you split up, Gavin will find you as soon as is narratively convenient. If you try to separate yourself from Gavin, the narrative will eventually punish you with one of the aforementioned deaths or curses.

This wouldn't be nearly so bad if Gavin was a better person and a better character. He's a pretty boring character, with his only character traits being badassery, falling in love with Tyrna for ill-explained reasons, and attempts to control Tyrna that keep being framed as nothing more than concern. Even though he pretty consistently criticizes and insults her any time she goes against what he says, initiates intimacy without bothering to ask for consent, and generally assumes he knows best in the relationship. Like Tyrna's a child he just has to protect. And don't get me started on his constant, obnoxious efforts to pamper a woman who clearly wants to be treated as an equal.
And, of course, the narrative supports this. It's okay that Gavin tells Tyrna what to do, because he's right; he's an awesome elf, and she's just a puny human girl. It's okay that Gavin keeps ignoring Tyrna's requests to shoulder her share of the load, because she bonked her head. It's okay that Gavin smooches her without making sure that this surly young woman wants a smooch, because the internal narration has been hinting that Tyrna has the hots for Gavin with all the subtlety Michael Bay could muster, and no need to have her actually say any of that. Ugh.
And then there's the plot. Tyrna tries to sneak into the orc camp? Gavin somehow snuck in behind you, even if he was cowering from a stampede of oxen and you have the cloak of concealment. Tyrna confronts the leader of the brigands? Gavin shows up before Sword Daughter has to draw her sword and lets her spectate. Find an evil cultist guy? Gavin fights him, chases him into the lake, and drives him into the water beetles. When there's a big fight scene Gavin usually lets Tyrna participate a little, though there's decent odds she'll be left to spectate by some event outside his control...and, of course, Gavin always does the badass stuff. I haven't found the ending where Tyrna confronts the orc who killed her dad, but given how every other plot point of import has wound up, I expect some kind of contrivance to give Gavin an excuse to take Tyrna's revenge for her.
After all, who picks up a game called Sword Daughter hoping to play a badass warrior woman? Nah, they want to play a damsel in distress playing at warrior before retiring to be a nice waifu for the badass half-Legolas dreamboat.

The visual novel is no doubt is a man's storyline and I say this because the main protagonist is a female warrior trained by her father to be a fighter.  

Instead of living up to how her father has raised her, the branching storylines paints a damsel in distress.  When you want the female character to kick some arse, instead you get a crappy ending.

So, for the most part, she becomes a warrior who succumbs to the alluring charm of the half human/half elf and not long into their journey, they already want to kiss each other.  Well, at least with one ending, you get to see the sword daughter reacting when elf-man wants her to be domesticated when she agrees to go home with him.

I also noticed a few GoT questions and I will say that you will not get the fire of Dany, you will not get the braveness of Arya, you get young Sansa and how she behaved before she learned of Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon...Granted Elf-man is not Joffrey, more like a hornier version of LoTR Legolas.

Overall, for a cheap price visual novel on sale that cost $1.39...worthy of trying, worthy of getting if you are hardcore into achievement perfection but it's a short non-linear visual novel that one can complete in less than 5 hours, probably less than two if you don't read it all.

[h1]Handlung und Gameplay[/h1]

In [i]Sword Daughter[/i] bestimmen und erleben wir die Geschichte einer jungen Generalstochter namens Tyrna. Nach jahrelangen Training gilt es nun uns zu beweisen und als Kriegerin anerkannt zu werden. So machen wir uns mit unserem Vater und Gefolge auf zu den Kriegerfestspielen. Der Weg führt durch unsicheres Gebiet und so kommt es, dass unser Nachtlager von einer Gruppe Orks überfallen wird. Durch glückliche Umstände schaffen wir es der mordenen Horde durch die Finger zu gehen, müssen uns aber am nächsten Morgen der Realität stellen, dass wir von nun an auf uns allein gestellt sind. Naja, fast. Ein Halbelf namens Gavin hat auf seinem Patrouillengang das zerstörte Lager und somit auch uns entdeckt. Er bietet uns an in die nächst sichere Stadt zu bringen doch wir sind fest entschlossen unseren Vater zu rächen und schaffen es durch unsere Dickköpfigkeit den Halbelben davon zu überzeugen uns bei dem Vorhaben zu unterstützen. Damit beginnt unsere Reise durch ein fremdes Land mit geheimen Höhlen gefüllt mir verlockenden Schätzen, Kammern mit Drachen, Ruinen die alte Magie beinhalten und uns vor allem vor die Entscheidung stellen was uns im Leben das wertvollste ist. Reichtum, Macht oder doch Liebe?

[i]Sword Daughter[/i] spielt sich ganz in der klassischen ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure""-Manier, nur ohne das ganze ""Blätter zur Seite X"". Hier muss man keine Attributspunkte sammeln oder Parameter füllen wie in Otome-Spielen. Allerdings warten somit auch keine versteckten oder freischaltbare Sachen auf einen.
Es gibt 3 Hauptgeschichtsstränge mit insgesamt 22 Enden. [spoiler]Die meisten davon sind bittersüße ""Und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind dann leben sie noch heute"" Enden[/spoiler]


[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] wunderschöner Zeichenstil, mit einem sehr angenehmen Farbschema, der sich komplett durch die zahlreichen CGs, Sprites und Hintergründe zieht. Es ist immer erfrischend mal etwas anderes als den, in dem Genre dominierenden, Animestil zu sehen
[*] willensstarke Protagonistin die trotzdem ihre Weiblichkeit nicht verliert. Die roten Haare und die Sommersprossen bringen zusätzlich noch frischen Wind in die sonst recht gleich aussehenden MCs in Visual Novels
[*] CG-Galerie und eine Jukebox zum Soundtrack anhören sind über das Menü aufrufbar
[*] hoher Wiederspielwert durch die zahlreichen Enden. Diese kann man durch eine ""Jump to the Section"" Option auch ohne Guide einfach erspielen ohne, dass man, wie bei anderen Visual Novels, unzählige Speicherstände anlegen muss. Außerdem wird einem dadurch auch das lästige Skippen erspart
[*] Achievementhilfe mit der "" Have You Done This?"" Option 
[*] die Geschichte ist jetzt kein literarisches Meisterwerk aber die Dialoge fühlen sich natürlich an und man wird gut unterhalten. Besonders Trynas Monologe haben mich mehrmals zum Schmunzeln gebracht
[*] auch wenn das Spiel nichts bietet, was man nicht schon irgendwo mal in einer Fantasygeschichte gesehen hat, wird es nicht langweilig. Durch die, zwar nur kurz, angeschnittene Lore wirkt die Spielewelt sehr lebendig und macht Lust darauf noch mehr zu erfahren [/list]

Bonuspluspunkte:  gut erreichbare 100% Errungesncha & Steamkarten

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
[list]
[*] relativ kurze Spieldauer
[*] der Soundtrack ist nichts Besonderes passt aber gut zu den einzelnen Szenen [/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] die ""Liebe auf dem 1. Blick"" Thematik ist nicht gut ausgearbeitet. Das hätte man durchaus besser machen bzw. natürlicher wirken lassen können
[*] der Titel und die Einführung versprechen mehr Emanzipation und Stärke der Protagonistin als tatsächlich eingehalten wird [/list]

As a burgeoning warrior Tyrna, daughter of the great general Hamroth, is traveling through a vast desert with her father on the way to compete in the annual Warrior Games. As the traveling caravan they are accompanying makes camp for the night it is suddenly and unsuspectingly besieged upon by a marauding band of vicious Orcs who begin killing everyone in sight. Your beloved father quickly manages to safely hide you under a Cloak of Concealment before he himself is murdered defending the caravan during the brutal attack. Even concealed, Tyrna manages to catch a blow to the head from a wildly swinging weapon during the melee and falls to the ground still hidden yet unconscious and left for dead. A short time later and still alive, young Tyrna must learn to fend for herself in the world and make some substantial choices as she vows to track down her fathers killers and rescue the remaining but captured caravaners. Prepare to follow Tyrna on a grand adventure filled with glorious battle, powerful magic, riches beyond belief and romance as she makes meaningful choices while living the life of a swordswoman. This visual novel is a licensed recreation of an original choose-your-own-adventure fantasy book from the 1980's with all new picturesque artwork and a fantastic soundtrack.

Visually, this novel's presentation is simply breathtaking. The outstanding artwork is of the upmost quality with superb illustrations laden with beautiful colors and shading. I'm also quite happy to report that the artstyle in this title is NOT manga-inspired, not that I don't like that particular type of illustration as I very much do but it's just nice to read a visual novel on Steam from time to time that steps away from that prevalent method of art. Aurally, this V.N. is just as superb as there are an abundance of ambient sound effects present that really immerse you quite well into the story. Also, the soundtrack itself is very impressive and blends in nicely with the narrative whether you are traversing through a barren desert, engaging combatants or witnessing a rather emotional moment in the novel. The overall user interface is simple and easy to use which allows you to focus on the reason that you are here for in the first place which is the captivating narrative. In summary, Sword Daughter puts forth a very impressive visual and aural presentation for this quite interesting visual novel experience. 

Seeing as how I couldn't get my hands on enough copies of choose-your-own adventure books to peruse, I completely loved the story in Sword Daughter and the nostalgia that it awakened in me for that particular genre of reading. There was always just something so spectacular about the choose-your-own adventure books and this visual novel managed to capture that ""special something"" perfectly. If you like to read and have never experienced this genre before then I wholeheartedly suggest that you give it a try because you won't be dissapointed. With that said, replayability is quite high as the very nature of choose-your-own adventure books warrant such a thing. As far as options go, there are numerous Steam Achievements to hunt down and Steam Trading Cards to collect as well. The title also has basic game options like sound/volume control, text speed and language selection. Also, there is a C.G. gallery that unlocks as the story progresses, an Achievement screen to keep track of your various accomplishments in the novel, a section map for determining the choices that you selected in order to help you get to the twenty two different endings and a jukebox for the wonderfully orchestrated soundtrack. In the end, this V.N. does a wonderful job of taking you on a fantastic journey packed with combat, intrigue, romance and choice which is what any worthy visual novel should be capable of doing therefore Sword Daughter is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to any fan of the genre.",1527435989,1527435989,True,25,0,0.742846965789794922,2,True,False,False,False,,,

If this was an actual otome, the main character would be a ray of sunshine. Admittedly, I have not yet taken stupid defenseless paths, and I really don't want to.

You can end the game without swearing eternal love for the elf, seizing nearly every moment of sword chopping glory entirely for yourself. I charged the enemies first, thought of tricks first, and compromised my own safety to protect his dumb butt first. The elf's not a guide. You don't actually follow him, because he's stuck with whatever decisions you make. He talks big, but he's entirely dependent on you to make every choice. It's great.

I haven't reached the homemaker ending yet. (I don't want to) I like being an equal as friends or otherwise. In terms of 80s misogyny, I was shook, which was upsetting, but it was brief. It's possible that I would have been shook as a dude in that scenario. I was never slapped. In one playthrough, I was entirely praised, and never heard a word edge-wise.

A lot of readers to VNs have experienced significantly worse, for games made entirely for girls. At least I felt like a hero, I was resourceful, successful, romance not critical to my adventure, and I had eyes.

The story's ok. It's not nearly as confusing as reviewers made it sound. Pretty normal high fantasy. [spoiler]The orcs are building for the mine. The mine is to extract dragon gold, which is partially inaccessible due to cave-ins, etc. They are obeying a shackled, mind-controlling dragon. The raiding party wants workers for the mine, or dragon food. [/spoiler]

If you're only going for one or two playthroughs, it's pretty solid. It's got a great art style, the sound scape is spot on, and the story telling is engaging. 

I wouldn't recommend it, though, for the reasons below: 

Unfortunately there isn't much of a 'choice' between falling in love with an elven stud and going on your own adventure. Most of the endings result in the two falling in love and herione blindly following Gavin's lead (there is only ONE time in the entire game where you have the option to be forward with him). Some endings the herione is pleased with the outcome and some she's like: uh, wait, hold up. Either way, it gets fairly boring and repetative. Can't we just be friends? Sword buddies? Teach me the elvish ways, not swoop me in your arms and drag me home to your mother. 

Also the overarching story starts to fall apart the more you play through it. The passage of time is unclear, but the prisoners meet vastly different fates in some of the endings - but when you save them you always save the same dude. Why are the prisoners being moved around so much, why are the prisoners even there, why was the raiding party sent out in the first place? And then there are all these other questions: who is the REAL leader and decision-maker for our evil-doers, why are they even hanging out together, how did they come to set up camp there, WHY ARE THEY BUILDING THE THINGS THEY ARE BUILDING AND WHAT PURPOSE DO THEY EVEN SERVE?? Like?? I have so many more questions and playing more just made me more confused. 

One last thing: the herione doesn't have much agency. She gets to make a few of the choices, but elf-stud talks more than she does, does all the cool stuff, and generally makes himself out to be an action hero while our herione gets herself into trouble. Like, okay, cool you can do that once or twice but eventually it just gets boring. We understand that our herione is naive and stubborn and a young warrior whose not that experienced in battle, we GET IT, but if our herione were a hero instead she'd get to do a lot more cool things.",1496437083,1496437083,False,30,1,0.707645416259765625,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Далее лёгкие спойлеры.

Sword Daughter не самый худший проект и кое-какие плюсы у неё действительно есть:
- она недорогая. На распродаже её можно купить за 50 рублей, цена за пару часов чтения и несколько красивых артов смешная, а карточки красивые;
- совершенно потрясающая работа художницы, которая игру иллюстрировала: отличные фоны, прекрасные CG, хорошие спрайты персонажей (разве что у эльфа ОЧЕНЬ странная улыбка). Многие арты так и просятся на рабочий стол;
- в два часа игры упихано довольно много событий и вариаций: тогда как общая канва сюжета остаётся прежней, мы можем прийти к ней совершенно разными путями: можем воевать с орками, можем бороться с троллем, можем спасать караванщиков из нашего обоза, а можем забить на них, и т. д. Вариации не всегда очевидны, но в игре есть удобная система развилок, которая показывает, какие варианты вы открыли, где игра разветвляется и позволяет сразу перенестись на ветку, которую ещё не исследовали.

Теперь о плохом:
- главная героиня далеко не во всех вариациях сюжета ощущается главной героиней (есть пара вариантов, где ощущается, но они в меньшинстве). По большей части её тащит за ручку и постоянно спасает эльф, хотя Тирна, казалось бы, не дама-в-беде и сама умеет мечом махать, до печальных событий в начале игры вообще на турнир воинов собиралась;
- эльф, который, к слову, единственный романтический интерес, очень часто ударяется в гипер-опеку. Он постоянно твердит геройке, что не стоит ей сражаться, не стоит мстить, поехали, мол, лучше ко мне в деревню к маме, будешь печь пирожки и рожать полуэльфийских детишек. К чести Тирны, ей такой вариант совсем не нравится. Не к чести авторов сценария: если прямо сказать, что участь домохозяйки не для меня, то эльф обидится, а героиня будет переживать, что вот была любовь, да сплыла из-за её глупости и гордости;
- стремительное развитие отношений между героями не поругал только ленивый, и я тоже по нему пройдусь. До первых признаков влюблённости со стороны эльфа проходит что-то около трети игры, в отдельных вариациях он уже на середине признаётся, хотя за всё время герои поговорили от силы пару раз;
- сюжет очень скомканный, совершенно плюёт на драматичность того, что происходит в самом начале игры, прыгает с одного события на другое. Только что Тирна была одержима желанием отомстить и спасти караванщиков, но вот уже бредёт в совершенно другую сторону, потому что туда надо эльфу. Вот произошла одна из центральных сюжетных схваток и героиня, которая пару минут назад хотела всех спасти, уже решила, что фиг с ними: всех не спасёшь и любовь всей жизни, с которой она знакома полдня, - это важнее. Все такие решения принимаются без нашего вмешательства, и поэтому вызывают недоумение и раздражение. Нужно очень специфически проходить игру, чтобы получить ту историю, что в описании: когда мы всех спасли и любовь нашли, и сердце успокоили.

I bought it some time ago, didn't particularly like it so put it down for a while and picked it up again recently but found more of the same. Overall I'm coming down on the negative side of neutral with regards to it being a game book written in the 80's. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen but it has some significant problems with the story.

Firstly some of the graphics are nice. They're in a consistant style that suits the game book. I didn't find the music that intrusive (although I turned it right down after a while and it got repetative) and the sound effects are ok. 

Onto the story and this is where it falls down. I realise this is based on an 80's game book and it has dated noticably. The characters are shallow, it's hard to feel anything much for them at all. The instant attachement to the elf who turns up is weird and creepy especially since her father has just been murdered. I mean don't you think you'd be too upset about your kin lying dead on the ground to repeatedly dreamily note how pretty the elf guy is? 

***Spoiler's ahead***
What I really objected to was as far as I can tell, your character is constantly railroaded into a senario where she is rescued...falls in love with elf....gives up prior dreams of being a warrior to play housewife with elf (most common). Or gets captured...then enchanted and spends life with Loric as his wife. Or gets rescued then enchanted and spends life as the unthinking slave-queen of a dragon.  

Seeing a pattern yet? Your female protagonist seems almost (or often completely) helpless the majority of the time, basically having to be rescued and ending up as someone's wife. You're meant to be a warrior type (look at the strong warrior chic yelling with sword in hand for the promotional picture!) but in reality you're anything but that. It gets old and is not a great message to be sending to kids either.

It's a shame the story couldn't have been tweaked a bit to give Tyrna a few better lines and involvement in the quests and battles. Especially in places where your rescuer-elf is physically abusing you by shaking you or shoving you on a horse against your wishes (which of course is just showing he cares) or forcing you to kiss him without warning (which of course is what you always wanted most in your whole life and you're instantly deeply in love!)....

Minor spoilers ahead: Tyrna is a fake ""girl power"" protaginist whom the writer clearly did not understand. Her motivation varies, and she often contradicts her main character trait: a tough chick.  It starts out fine, she is a tough chick who her father chose to train in sword and skills. However, after her father dies, she becomes starstruck with Gavin, a half elf. Nearly every ending revolves around them getting together. This story line wouldn't be so bad, if the wriitng wasn't extremly simple. Gavin frequently loses his temper with Tyrna, and even at times grabs her and shakes her. Tyrna, instead of being a boss bitch, she thinks that he really must care for her because he is so concerned. In at least one play through he physically picks her up and puts her on the horse because she is being stubborn. But looking in his eyes she knows he cares? Please, if your main character is supposed to be a tough chick, she wouldn't take that I'm-the-master-do-as-I-say-BS from anyone.

История тут проста: жила-была девушка, путешествовала, но орки перебили весь ее караван и лишь она выжила. Тут ее и нашел красавец-эльф, что был должен стать проводником каравана. Дальше она хочет мстить, а эльф не собирается бросать ее одну. Отсюда все расходится.

Базово эта игра являет ""цифроизацией"" книги-игры из 1980-х. Самого простого вида таких книг: когда в конце страницы пишут ""Идешь налево - читай стр. 15, идешь направо - стр. 56"", когда нет статов, прокачки и КАЖДЫЙ выбор ведет на совершенно отличную ветку сюжета, на которую в 99% случаев вы не сможете попасть никаким другим способом. Очень часто выборы и их последствия не связаны никакой логикой, так что не предскажешь, что делать (классика жанра: два совершенно одинаковых коридора. В конце одного - смерть, в конце другого - сокровища. Но они в момент выбора абсолютно одинаковы).

""Рекомендую"" же я поставила этой игре только за ""портирование"": игре добавили портреты персонажей VN-style и отдельные CG-арты для ключевых сцен, но при этом не забыли и книжное прошлое. Когда ты играешь с реальной книгой в руках, то обычно делаешь закладки или просто прижимаешь пальцами страницы выбора, чтобы потом к ним вернуться. Это нашло отражение в игре: здесь есть список всех ""страниц""/сцен, на которые можно всегда переключиться, не просто чтобы перечитать, как часто в галереях VN, а чтобы продолжить с этого места.

Так что если кратко: сюжетно это обычная жвачка, но техническое исполнение переноса с бумаги на экран идеально, я не могу придумать чего еще можно было бы желать. Игра может быть интересна тем, кому любопытно какими когда-то были обычные книги-игры или кто хочет прочитать что-то игровое и фэнтезийное за вечер (но учтите, что тут героИНЯ и с самого начала к ней цепляется красавец-эльф, так что эпика не ждите, от [strike]любви[/strike] эльфа сбежать не надейтесь), остальным лучше пройти мимо.",1467740832,1467741303,True,6,0,0.625783264636993408,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you grew up with those books you will probably love this game, but (as the creators point out in their patch notes) it has some faithful design elements that may seem incredibly odd or out of place to a more contemporary audience.

To cover the basic elements, this was a fairly generic story, set in the standard D&D/Tolkien setting (made unique and innovative because these elves are typically *shorter* than a human!). The art serves the settings and characters quite well, with some beautifully illustrated backgrounds and relatable portraits throughout. There are a few effects scattered throughout for animation (ranging from parallax levels of sandstorm particles to the much more common but basic screen shake) but the character visuals mostly rely on swapping a handful of expressions per pose over the course of conversation; it certainly gets the job done, and is about what you should expect from a VN. The music and sound effects were similarly adequate, setting the tone but rarely sticking out or being memorable mere hours after finishing the game. The play system (including merciful quick save/load and skip options right on the main screen) is setup nicely for your first playthrough but really shines if you decide to go the completion route, restoring every choice you're given and plumbing their depths as we did through elaborate series of bookmarks years ago.

But even as a veteran of CYOA, there were some rough edges that stood out to me. Looking at the story as a whole, let's say there are three main main plots to encounter; any given ending might resolve one (maybe two) of those while letting the rest dangle, as they were never introduced in that sequence to begin with. As a corollary, one major plot element is encountered no matter which path you pursue, ignoring the conflicts of logic if you were to fill out your routes to see how each path makes it fit. It's hard to call this a fault, knowing how a good DM may alter their campaign on the fly to make sure players hit the various setpiece moments, but learning the whole web of choices does make them all seem a bit arbitrary. You can attempt to roleplay, and if you stick to your guns you can have a complete and satisfying playthrough in about 15 minutes, but the outcome might still largely feel like it was never in your control. This game will frequently throw you for a loop, when you are suddenly placed in an unwinnable ambush several story beats after your last meaningful choice, which makes the entire exercise of cause and effect feel a bit unpredictable - but again, that's entirely accurate to the books it is emulating, so maybe not that isn't a fair complaint so much as it is something to be aware of.

My only real complaint with the story is how much it leans into traditional romantic tropes at the expense of the main character. For a game that (at least in my recommendations queue) bills itself around its strong female protagonist, something like 90% of the ""good"" endings revolve almost entirely around her forming an immediate relationship with the first man she meets. Maybe it's not for me to say, but that feels unfulfilling when the stated premise at the outset is her journey to complete the rites of adulthood and become a warrior in the Sword Games, and that plot thread is rarely heard from again after Love Interest McSavior is introduced. Again, not a bad story, if a bit heavy on cliche, but also not what I believe we were promised from the setup.

Overall I would happily recommend this game, even where it falls short of potential it's an enjoyable bit of generic fantasy action you can complete (and even 100% complete) in one sitting. It's got some elements that will be either baffling or nostalgic depending on your past experience with Choose Your Own Adventure novels, but as an old fan I feel it manages to modernize that format in a very successful way for the VN audience of today.",1466848780,1466848780,True,10,0,0.638856291770935059,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Whenever you choose an option where Tyrna goes off on her own, the elf dude ends up catching up with her and scolding her, and whenever she attempts to fight with her sword, she's ineffectual or nearly gets herself killed and then the elf dude saves her. Only one line in the description references romance, and it makes it sound like you have a choice in the matter, and the preview puts emphasis on the fantasy setting of the story. I don't think I've gotten the ending that included the title image of Tyrna charging ferociously with her blade, but she probably trips and falls on it on the following page, causing the elf to have to rescue her *** and bridal carry her off to the nearest clinic.
I ended up wandering when my choices would actually make a difference, or at least go somewhere I wanted.
I liked the art, especially of Tyrna. The music and sounds also did a pretty good job at immersion. The idea of a dungeons and dragons type game done in a choose your own adventure novel is fun. This didn't have the story to hold up the potential-- it was sorta dry.
I got it for like 2.49 during a sale which seems fair considering I liked the art. Still I'm considering a refund.

While the illustrations are beautiful and the sound effects/music enrich the story/atmosphere be aware that this game is all reading dialogue/descriptions that result from the ""choose your own ending"" mechanic. 

I do not recommend this game because although the main character Tyrna is described as a skilled and trained warrior and set up to appear a strong female ultimately every obstacle she faces is remedied by her stalling and the male protagonist Gavin popping up at the last minute to save her. Why make her a warrior in the first place if she needs someone to save her??? Just make her a stereotypical princess and avoid the bait and switch I fell for. In addition to the damsel in distress situation I disliked that there is a romantic element between the 2 protagonists that just seems like the creators added it just because. Literally a couple choices in and Gavin is grabbing and kissing Tyrna (depending on player choices of course) which doesn’t compliment the story and feels artificial.

Had it started this way I doubt there would have been so many comments/complaints about character development and short storylines.  Truthfully what fairy tale really does have in-depth character development or that much of a plot?     

Storyline: Tyrna, a young woman (a maiden) has been trained by her father all her life to be a warrior.  On the way to the Warrior Games (a tournament to basically earn the right to be called a warrior) the caravan is attacked by orcs.  She is knocked unconscious fighting orcs and because of this is the only remaining survivor of the massacre her father dies in.  Gavin, a half-elf/half-human ranger (on patrol) comes upon the carnage and revives her before the orcs return or wild animals find her.  Of course it is love at first sight, what fairy tale does not have love at first sight.  The adventure and mild romance (mostly of the happily ever type) begins here.

Visually adapted story, though I would say illustrated would be more accurate, from an 80s Choose Your Own Adventure D&D (Dungeon and Dragon) book from the Dragon Roads series by Rhondi Vilott (Thanks Chudah for that information), this game ""plays"" in the same way the books ""read"".  Make a choice (or many choices) and follow the storyline to the end.  Unlike modern visual novels there are no ""bad"", ""normal"" or ""good"" endings.  There are no points to earn, algorithmic based choice lines to follow, no gimmicks to keep the reader's attention and no extra ""hidden"" finale ending.  There are only endings, a few that even lead to death (though most are the 'happily ever after' kind).  Each choice takes the player down a path, and through the quest based adventure of actually two people, Tyrna and Gavin.  Both have quests to fulfill and both have the will, tenacity, stubbornness, and skill to accomplish them.    

The best feature of this game is Jump To A Section.  Here the player can see the endings that need to be found (as ??), and paths that have yet to be traveled (red x).  No need to make a flowchart or perpetually save the game at every question choice.  The player can click on the section and begin the adventure there at that choice, instead of all the tedium of skipping massive amounts of beginning dialogue or loading up a saved game.  There is also a feature called Controlled Skip which allows the player to skip all previous viewed dialogue and stops on new dialogue.  What a time saver that is.  Between both of those features the game plays very smoothly and very quickly.  There is even in-game achievement page called Have You Done This? with things to do like ride a dragon, become a queen or get stoned.  

Though many comment on how short this game is, 22 endings that do not contradict or confuse is a fair feat of tight story telling.  I highly recommend this game for its simplistic approach and fairy tale overture.",1453350223,1453425814,True,31,1,0.77269977331161499,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Non ?! Comment ça non ?! Eh bien ouste ouste passez votre chemin, il n'y a rien à voir car ce Sword Daughter adapté d'un livre de type ""Choisir son aventure"" sorti en 1980 vous offrira des câlins, des bisous, des orcs et euh... des bisous. Allez j'exagère un peu mais lisez donc et vous comprendrez mon point de vue ![/i]

La jeune et téméraire Tyrna voyage avec son père, un chevalier respecté, à travers des terres arides regorgeant de viles créatures. Après que le campement ait été attaqué par une horde d'orcs, Tyrna est sauvée par Gavin, un semi-elfe parti en quête pour comprendre pourquoi la rivière sacrée s'assèche de plus en plus. La jeune fille veut quant à elle se venger de ces orcs qui ont décimé le camp et sauver les caravaniers qui faisaient route avec eux. A vous de faire les bons choix pour satisfaire les deux protagonistes et libérer les innocents des griffes des monstres qui hantent ces contrées.

Ce qui est assez étonnant avec Sword Daughter, c'est que le but ne réside pas dans la complétion du jeu mais plutôt dans l'exploration des différents embranchements de l'aventure. Ainsi j'ai bien été surprise quand au bout de 20 minutes de jeu j'ai atteint la fin ! Enfin on ne peut pas dire ""la fin"" car il y a différentes routes, différents choix qui au total aboutiront à pas moins de 22 fins. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575749785 Heureusement, la découverte de ces différentes fins est encouragée d'une part par une histoire qui va être différente (ce n'est pas parce que les caravaniers étaient retenus captifs par les orcs qu'ils le seront à chaque fois), par des textes différents (vous repassez à des endroits connus, certes mais vous aurez droit à un nouveau texte à lire à chaque fois), et d'autre part par un bouton Skip qui permet d'avancer rapidement de choix en choix et par un menu très pratique qui permet de retourner à une section précise de l'aventure pour y faire un choix différent. On peut d'ailleurs y voir en vert les choix réalisés et en rouge les choix non explorés. Plus besoin d'écrire sur une feuille les choix effectués et en cela le jeu est plus accessible aux joueurs qui ne sont pas rompus à ce genre classique.

Le scénario de Sword Daughter est en effet très classique et mêlera orcs, elfes, dragons, trolls et j'en passe. Un univers héroïc-fantasy qui pourtant n'est pas aussi fouillé qu'il n'en donne l'impression. Étant donné que les parties sont courtes il est compréhensible qu'on ne rentre pas trop dans les détails cependant, l'effet pervers de cette simplicité scénaristique réside dans le fait qu'on va se retrouver avec des personnages peu profonds, pas très travaillés, à la personnalité très manichéenne. Le gentil elfe tout beau, le méchant orc qui pue, la jeune fille courageuse qui fonce tête baissée (mais heureusement le bel elfe est là pour la sortir des mauvais pas). Ah, ça respire un peu la naïveté tout ça d'autant que les relations que les personnages peuvent entretenir sont trop rapides et exagérées. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=576097908 Même si je joue rarement à des jeux de type Visual Novel j'ai plutôt l'habitude des romances lentes, ennuyeuses à mourir avec des fillettes qui rougissent, des garçons embarrassés et un petit bisou au bout de 7h de jeu. Ici ce n'est pas le cas, dès la rencontre avec Gavin on sent qu'il y a romance dans l'air. Selon vos choix il pourra y avoir câlins et embrassades au bout de 10 minutes ! C'est un tantinet trop brusque, l'histoire en prend un coup car elle en devient superficielle et peu réaliste par rapport à la situation (embrassons-nous alors que papa vient de mourir ou faisons une pause bisou en pleine fuite face à des orcs pas franchement sympathiques). Ça reste gentillet et mignon mais c'est trop forcé, pas moyen d'éviter la romance, nos choix seront purement liés à l'aventure en soi. Il ne faut pas se plaindre non plus, il est assez agréable d'explorer les différentes options, de fuir devant le dragon, de sa cacher ou de se mesurer à lui puis de recommencer et de voir quelle sera la conclusion de l'aventure avec un choix différent. Le bon point est aussi qu'une fois la fin atteinte il nous est tout de suite proposé de modifier notre choix final, bien vu !

Le problème qui réside aussi dans cette romance et dans finalement ce qu'on aura tôt fait de comprendre, c'est qu'on a l'impression d'avoir deux protagoniste, deux héros. L'elfe occupe une place trop importante et notre héroïne parait fade, naïve et secondaire à ces côtés. D'ailleurs Gavin prendra beaucoup d’initiatives auxquelles on ne pourra pas couper court et on sera parfois spectateur de ses exploits, ou pire, laissés derrière pendant qu'il effectue son plan. On garde un peu en travers de la gorge l'idée que le mec cool, c'est lui, nous on est juste le boulet qu'il se traine. Toujours là où il faut, toujours fort et courageux, Gavin est trop parfait et cette histoire n'est pas assez tragique à mon goût. Je ne demande pas aux scénaristes d'être plus sadiques mais juste plus réalistes et de ne pas faire apparaitre Gavin à chaque fois que la demoiselle est en détresse.

Au niveau artistique, Sword Daughter s'en tire bien grâce à ses artworks peints à la main maitrisés. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575536628 Ce style un peu flou et ces personnages aux traits classiques donnent un rendu qui parait ancien et qui convient parfaitement à ce jeu adapté d'un livre des années 80. Les quelques titres de la bande-son sont satisfaisants et accompagnent bien les péripéties de nos héros bien qu'il n'y ait pas de thème mémorable non plus.

Pour les francophones, la durée de vie du jeu variera entre 4 et 6 heures selon votre maitrise de l'anglais et votre usage abusif ou parcimonieux du bouton Skip et du menu des différents embranchements. Attention car jeu dans la veine classique signifie aussi anglais assez soutenu avec un vocabulaire qui pourra être complexe pour ceux qui ne se sentent pas trop à l'aise avec la langue.

Au final, Sword Daughter est un jeu plaisant, très classique dans l'âme et offrant de jolis artworks ainsi que de nombreux choix qu'il convient d'explorer. Toutefois une trop grande superficialité se dégage de cette histoire avec ses personnages peu profonds, ses relations irréalistes et ses situations bien trop favorables aux protagonistes. Ceux qui recherchent une aventure épique avec du sang et des larmes peuvent passer leur chemin car ils auront droit à une romance et, malgré des rencontres dangereuses, ils n'éprouveront jamais de peur pour leurs héros.

Sword Daughter is the second VN I have 'played', being the first Fate Stay Night. To be fair, VN is not my genre of choice so  I renounce any expertise in the field. But if I read the word 'novel' I expect something to read for many hours. With a plot. Some character development is always nice.
Sword Daughter's plot is weak so is natural to think its strong point would be in character development. Guess again, there is no character development at all. I don't call a schizophrenic half elf 'character development'. The heroine needs another background, for a warrior to be she is extremely unfit.

Вилотт Салситц, которая в 1984 году написала первую книгу из большого фэнтезийного сериала ""Dragontales"". А книга эта называлась ""Sword Daughter's Quest"". Именно она и вдохновила разработчиков на создание данной игры.

К сожалению, мне не удалось ознакомиться с первоисточником, поэтому я не могу сказать, насколько точно книга была перенесена на экраны мониторов. Но, предполагаю, что основные моменты выдержаны и суть, в общем-то, ясна.

СЮЖЕТ. Вам предстоит сыграть за Тирну - рыжеволосую девчонку-сорванца, которая отправляется в долгое и опасное путешествие по неизведанным землям, чтобы отомстить за смерть отца и спасти угнанных в рабство караванщиков. Вы молоды, амбициозны, умеете махать мечом, но неопытны и можете наломать кучу дров. На ваше счастье судьба сводит вас с Гэйвином - странником эльфийского происхождения. И теперь придётся выбирать, что делать дальше: доверить свою жизнь незнакомому эльфу, самой отправиться на поиски караванщиков или попросить у ушастого помощи, а дальше как карта ляжет.

РИСОВКА в игре очень приятная и радует глаз. Жаль, что многие визуальные новеллы этим похвастаться не могут. Почаще смотрите на экран: герои меняют свои эмоции в зависимости от ситуации. Хотя у рисовки есть некоторые недочёты. Например, в описании говорится, что у Гэйвина фиалковые глаза, а на иллюстрации они вишнёвые. Хотя это лишь придирки. Остерегайтесь картинок, где герои ржут как кони - в прямом и переносном смысле. От смеха у вас может разболеться живот. 

МУЗЫКА хорошая, ненавязчивая. Можете повторно прослушать треки в главном меню.

ИГРОВОЙ ПРОЦЕСС очень и очень простой. Читаете и кликаете, выбирая между разными вариантами ответа. В целом, вам придётся делать свой выбор около 70 раз, так что готовьте слоты под сохранения.

ДОСТИЖЕНИЯ в игре есть. И они несложные. Единственное достижение, которое вы можете пропустить, называется просто - 100%. Оно даётся за открытие всех игровых сцен. И чтобы его не проморгать, я НАСТОЯТЕЛЬНО РЕКОМЕНДУЮ доигрывать каждую сцену до самого конца. То есть, если вы дошли до какой-то концовки, и на экране высветилось Make another choice и End adventure, - сохранитесь, выберите второй вариант (""Конец приключениям""), посмотрите титры и только после этого загружайте нужный файл с сохранением. Иначе игра не засчитает вам эту сцену как пройденную. Сохраняйтесь чаще. Если запутались и где-то что-то позабыли, в главном меню в строке Section Map будет отмечено, что вы пропустили и куда можете возвратиться. Удобно и для лентяев.

О ПРЕТЕНЗИЯХ. У игры очень смешанные отзывы. Некоторые пишут, что игра слишком короткая, неинтересная, нелепая, у неё дурацкие концовки, нет возможности строить отношения с другими героями и так далее и тому подобное. Не понимаю я вас, товарищи. Книга была написана в 1984 и, принимая во внимание сюжет, никак не могла претендовать на лавры великого произведения. Приключение в стиле фэнтези с долей романтики и всё. Это простой роман, чтобы скоротать холодный осенний вечер за чашкой горячего чая, укутавшись в тёплый плед. Героине не приходится выбирать между толпой потенциальных женихов, у неё есть один любовный интерес, который поступает очень рассудительно. Перефразируя слова знаменитой песни:
 
Увезy тебя в деревню, yвезy к своей маман,
Шкуру синюю драконью бpошy я к твоим ногам!
По хpyстящемy песочку поспешим на кpай земли
И сpеди барханов жёлтых затеряемся вдали.

Концовки правильные, по типу приключенческих ""Трёх богатырей"": направо пойдешь - мужа найдёшь, налево - с ума сойдёшь, прямо - к оркам попадёшь. Игра простая и наивная, местами смешная, но она не дурацкая, а возможность постоянного выбора делает её интересной для полного прохождения. Игра не такая уж и дорогая, а если вам посчастливилось купить её со скидкой - то вообще праздник. Для любителей плюшек есть достижения и карточки.

The fact that Gavin tags along with Tyrna for most of the story means there's lots of dialogue, which probably made this more suited to adapting into a visual novel than a solo dungeon crawl-type game book would be; but I was still disappointed by the lack of a good romance.

As an adaptation into a visual novel, however, I think [i]Sword Daughter[/i] is quite good. There's plenty of save slots, as well as a section map that marks the scenes you haven't read yet and lets you easily jump to them. (It took me under two hours to reach all the scenes and endings.) I don't think the music is original, but it's fitting. The art is Western fantasy instead of anime-style. It's distinctive for a visual novel, and pretty, and there's a good amount of CGs. (And I kind of want to use Gavin's portrait for my next [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] character, because he's a nice-looking elf even if he is a dbag.)

If you like visual novels and don't mind the flawed story, I'd recommend [i]Sword Daughter[/i] for the art alone. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing other game books adapted in a similar style.",1444441445,1444441622,True,24,2,0.687552511692047119,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Unfortunately, the game has received somewhat of a bad reputation due to its lack of depth and shallow characters, but a fully fleshed out visual novel with intricate plotting and rounded characters isn't what the game is supposed to be.  For those who've spent countless hours as a child discovering your love for reading while devouring Choose Your Own Adventure books faster than your parents could buy them, you'll find Sword Daughter to be quite familiar.  The style hearkens back to these old stories with treasure, tragedy and monsters behind every page and the path to adventure entirely up to you.  Anyone expecting more of the game is going to be sorely disappointed.

You take on the role of Tyrna, a young woman trained and raised by her father as a sword daughter.  Competing in the Warrior Games was all she ever dreamed of, that is until everything forever changes when a group of raiding orcs ambushes her caravan and takes her companions prisoner.  With a mysterious elf by her side, will she seek vengeance, truth or love in this exciting adventure?

Although the story has elements that place it in the otome category, I do not feel it's a very good example of the genre.  Aside from one dimensional characters with barely any development at all, the romance has absolutely no build up and comes completely out of left field.  Oftentimes one of the characters will start talking about love and being ""more than friends"" when they've barely known each other a few hours.  This can be off putting and uncomfortable (not to mention kind of creepy), but if you can get past the love-at-first-sight awkwardness, it's bearable.  I enjoyed some of Tyrna's inner monologue as she works through strange new feelings at being accompanied by not only a man but a beautiful elf ranger, and there are a few lines of steamy yet innocent writing that will tease mild feels.  However, if you're expecting an amazing love story, this probably isn't the right place for you.

That said, while there is nothing here we haven't seen before, the setting and world building is really well done.  Although each route is rather short with a few of the endings popping before you've barely begun, it takes playing through the 3 main story branches and 22 endings to grasp the full scope of the overall plot.  Every character, object and location has a history,  and even though we don't get to read about it here, you know it's there because the small details given them hint at something more.  It's this attention to detail that gives fictional worlds life.  The lore behind the story is fascinating.  Granted, your standard fantasy tropes are all present, but the interesting twists on old ideas are refreshing.  I only wish we were able to further explore the back stories of the villains who were more compelling than the heroine and her companion.   

Sword Daughter's presentation is phenomenal and possibly worth the price of the game alone.  There is real talent behind the images that accompany this story, and to express in meager words how beautiful the artwork is does a disservice to the artists, but try I must.  The hand painted character images and CG's have a slight impressionistic feel to them which conveys a story-book like quality to the game.  However, it's the breathtaking backgrounds that steal the show with their detail, subtleties and emotion.  Some of these images could serve as hanged canvases on their own!  The soundtrack is high quality as well, with some lovely ethnic-inspired selections that help transport the reader to a far away world filled with magic and dragons.

Although short (4 hours to complete all endings, and I'm a slow reader), this Choose Your Own Adventure story is worth it, especially for the price. You're not going to find a better representation of the genre in visual novel format.  I just hope the game sells well enough to allow for more adaptations in the Dragon Roads series, but only time will tell.  It's definitely worth a look if you're able to appreciate it for what it is and not for what many critics expect it to be. 

Bottom Line: Recommended for those who appreciate classic ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style writing as well as anyone who enjoys beautiful fantasy artwork.

At first, I would've said I wanted there to be an ""ehh"" option between the ""Yes"" and the ""No"" options. Then the elf shook the mc until her (already bruised) head shook back and forth, stopped when she involuntarily teared up, and asked her to trust him. 

Classic abuse 101 srsly game WHY. 

In a game that promises me the role of a female warrior, I was sorely disappointed. The protagonist takes on a supporting role--even though she's known the main companion for all of 24 hours, at most. She's also been trained as a fighter, but she rarely gets to use her abilities. The men in the game a) assume she must be protected, as she is female; b) brainwash her with spells, and c) drug her. 

Sorry, spoilers. I'll put a warning at the top. 

I would've been ok with this game, because it's very pretty and I don't mind dating sims--which, btw, is basically what this is. Did NOT expect that. As I said, I expected to be a warrior. Instead, I got something that I can complete in two hours, where the only decisions are slight variations on one path. 

Not what I was expecting, at all--the description made things sound like I could conquer a kingdom during my life-long quest.  (Spoiler alert: you can't.)

I've chosen almost everything at this point and only unlocked around 15 routes. Certain choices will just loop back to a route you've taken before, and unless you want to restart from a previous save you're not going to accomplish anything by playing it over again. There don't seem to be any additional options once you hit familiar dialogue. 

tl;dr: not worth it. Also romanticizes a guy who wants you to be a good girl and stay at home in the kitchen. That's not even an exaggeration and I /wish/ I were joking.

Bad:
-Very short playthrough
-Immediate, uncomfortable, and unavoidable attachment to companion. Of which there is one. And he forces a bit of familiarity.

In a word? Boring. Repetative dialogue (even when making different choices at key moments), dull characters (I honestly don't care at all whether we rescue the slaves, or whether the protagonist dies or not) and emotionless scenes make getting through this game a chore, which is suprising because it is so short. 

If the player can't connect with the protagonist, then you have failed. The protagonist is supposed to be an extension of myself, and if I choose the option to fight, hoping that she would die so this particular storyline can finish, well that is a bad reflection on the story. Although it is not labelled as such, this is a graphic novel, and while the graphics are up to par, the story isn't; hopefully whoever created the artwork for this never collaborates with the author again and can move on to much better things.

When the summary asked ""will you be tempted by elven romance?"" I presumed that meant I would get a choice in the matter, but it seems that only in the endings where you die do you actually not have to suffer through this 'romance' that the game is trying to force upon you. The creators have obviously never seen any anime; the loner type, who of course is the pretty boy elf, is supposed to be awkward and standoffish to the person he likes before eventually, EVENTUALLY, letting them in enough to see that he is a good person underneath. This doesn't happen in a matter of hours as seems apparent in this game.

The graphics are pretty, but that is the only upside.",1424329718,1424329718,False,17,2,0.622596919536590576,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I did enjoy the world that is lurking behind the story and I would be interested to learn more about that, but I would need a more compelling lead and less abrupt love to get there.

The game is based on a Dragontails book (like Choose Your Own Adventure books) from 1984 called Sword Daughter Quest. Lots of diffrent choices to make as there are 22 diffrent endings. Backtracking in the story to reach all the endings is made easy with 12 seperate save slots and a skip feature that will let you quickly pass over bits of the story that you have already read.

My only real complaint of the game has to do with some of the sound effects. The horse souds like a pig, sword fights sound like a guy banging two spoons together and several other odd effects distract from the game, though most are not too bad. But seperate audio sliders for the music and sound effects do solve  this problem nicely. 

If you are a fan of the Choose Your Own Adventure books you will enjoy this game.",1423969209,1423969551,True,36,2,0.703477442264556885,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After that she meets our hero, the half-elf Warden Gavin and his Horse. So now it's on the player to decide which way to go. The Art is breathtaking, especially the backgrounds, and the Music fits the situation as well as the whole story. I also had no Problems with the Characters (if you ignore a few Endings) - I liked Gavin and I really loved Stormseeker, his horse. Tyrna was also a good Character, altough not as well characterized as the other characters. But that's understandable, since she's the Player's Persona. I was also a bit suprised about the sudden romantic feeling Tyrna felt just after a few seconds together with Gavin (altough I can't fault her XD) and that after she told her father that she wouldn't fall in Love. But that's because the VN is a bit short - not as a whole, because there are 33 Moments, when the player can choose what to do, as well as 22 Endings - if it's one playtrough. The Romance feels a bit rushed. But it's still a good Visual Novel in that price range.
