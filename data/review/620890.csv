It also crashes all the time, so we'd have to restart all the time (online mode, didn't try offline mode since the dude who gave this to me is living some towns away lol) which is not making it much better.

It also forces you to install .NET core version 3.1.x in order to play which is seemingly ancient, and according to google loses official support by Microsoft very soon (this very month in fact), which is making me feel uncomfortable lol.
I uninstalled both the game and the outdated .NET core it made me install and let the person who gifted this to me know that they may refund this gift if they so desire.

Considering that this is early access, I'd say this game has potential, but as of now it's really only good if you have a young sibling and need a quick and simple game for their birthday party or something.

Pros: EZ to pick up and play, good party game, especially if it receives some updates further down the line
Cons: lack of stability, bugged lobby names, keys clipping into very hard to reach places if you miss a throw (forcing a restart) but again, this appears to be early access so of course it needs a lot of care at this point in time lol",1670013008,1670013008,False,2,2,0.543189346790313721,0,False,True,True,True,,,

Alas, the joy passes quickly. Network play is not supported, and remote play is not able to draw more than 2 people. There are few opportunities, few levels and they are very dark.
