B-12 has some neat mechanics and fun gameplay but it lacks in level design and losing weapons and upgrades when you die. 
I don't like RNG level design and i don't like artificial difficulty and this game has them both.
It's a very simple system of find the three colored switches and shoot them ,then go to the exit and every third level defeat a boss across 4 worlds. 
The story it has is a-okay as it's you testing out the products and it very much feels like that but in my opinion it lacks depth or anything more then what it has. It's short to finish but also can get quite annoying since you have to replay levels with no checkpoints or saves and go through loading times a dozen times until RNG is good enough for you to beat the level. If this is supposed to hard then it fails even on the easiest difficulty,since your main ""hard"" difficulty is random levels and dying out of nowhere since you have 0 clue on what can kill you. Like it's one thing to tell to the player ,this does this and this does that but this game has no time for that it seems like so for example the purple crystals i only found out what they do in the last world. After the third time i died from them. So the developers clearly did not communicate to the player how everything works. In the end this is a mediocre third person shooter that does enough to be somewhat fun but fails in being fun as a game and is a more random mix of random elements thrown into one as an experiment which it clears fails as. Check it out i will say but don't expect anything special.",1706629878,1706629878,False,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Even though it seemed unbalanced and horribly unfair I stuck it out to the end.

Did I have fun? I don't really think so. Did I feel a sense of accomplishment when I beat the final boss with only half a health bar left? Damn straight I did, it was super sweet, even though it was 4am and I felt like I'd been beating my head against a brick wall for the preceding five hours.

Action platformer. Run, jump, shoot. Simple mechanics to understand, but unfortunately none of the mechanics are particularly well implemented. Movement is a little lob sided. Moving forward propels you in something like a seven degree angle to the right of centre. That's major flaw number 1. Your character can't walk in a straight line. Fine, you take that into account and make the necessary adjustments to your style of play. Then you discover that it's kinda tricky to judge jumping distances and how far you will travel while dashing. Okay fine, recalculate again and back into the action. A little less running, more measured jumps and then boom, you're blown to bits by enemy robots and laser firing security cameras.

You will grit your teeth a lot. You will swear a lot. You will ask yourself, ""am I enjoying this?"" Your answer will depend on your capacity for suffering and pain.

So two out of the three basic mechanics are slightly finicky ""what then of the shooting?"" I hear no one ask. Well as another reviewer mentions, it's something of a lucky dip, or maybe more accurately a Russian roulette. Fire your gun ten times, and you may observe somewhere between three to seven laser blasts. At no time during the game did I experience a one to one ratio for pressing fire and actually firing. Three mechanics, three problems with said mechaincs.

So you learn to run in a straight line, you learn how to judge distances, and you try your best with your shots. You then begin to learn that you can jump up vertical surfaces, and this changes the way you approach levels, and you think AHA, NOW I'VE GOT IT! But you don't got it. You've never got it. You can't got it.

In each of the randomly generated levels, you must locate and activate three switches which will power up a teleporter that allows you to progress to the next stage. Your basic weapon has three levels of charge, and each switch corresponds to one of these levels. A fully charged shot is enough to destroy some enemies in one blast, but much like the basic shooting, these charge shots are pretty hit and miss. You have to learn to hold the mouse button in, then click it again without releasing the original click. It sounds like a nightmare because it is.

After three levels, you will face a boss before you can teleport to the next world. The bosses range from difficult to unfairly difficult. One boss has about ten different weapons all of which are better than yours. Another boss glues you to the floor and leisurely destroys you from afar. Another boss, well they're all variations on a theme of pain.

Upgrades. The game has upgrades. Thank the robot gods for upgrades. Collect coins during levels, activate the shop, upgrade your gun, your armour, get a jet pack, get a shield generator and wooops, oh dear you just misjudged that jump again and now you've lost everything. This is not a rogue-lite, there are no permanent upgrades to make life easier. Unless you can afford to buy things in the shop, you will have to rely on your basic loadout, your wits, skill and luck.

I will say that I completed the last level and the boss without any additional components, Just my basic laser and a secondary weapon picked up from an enemy. I very rarely used the jet pack as it is designed to lull you into a false sense of security. Unless you can complete the level with only the bare essential equipment then forget about it, you're only punishing yourself more by assuming upgrades will help you.

What the heck am I thinking in recommending this then? None of this sounds like something you'd want to play right?

Well, I did really enjoy the aesthetics. Not just the graphics which are simple and clean and functional, but the general presentation. The font used on the menus, the retro futurist design of the robots, the brutalist architecture of the levels. Then there's the music which is a nice assortment of lo-fi minimal electro tunes. Many of these again evoke a sense of old fashioned ideas of the future, like they were recorded by someone in the 1950s when trying to imagine the sounds of tomorrow.

It all somehow adds up to setting a very specific tone which I just enjoyed after a while. Maybe I was just experiencing a kind of Stockholm syndrome.

There is a level set in a hashtag shaped space station. The corridors are tight and there are dozens of highly mobile, heavily armed enemies actively pursuing you on the ground and in the air. Some of the walls are destructible. Most of the floor is destructible. Within minutes you will have blown holes all over the level and you will be relentlessly pursued no matter what strategy you adopt. You will fall and fall and fall and fall and fall and fall and fall and fall and explode. Then on one chance run, you will blow a hole in the floor at just the right moment to send half a dozen enemies falling to their deaths, you will find the three switches and you will teleport out to the next level, an absolute king among robots.

Then the next level begins with ten enemies bursting into the room as you spawn in, all blowing you to pieces before you even have a chance to move.

I hate loved it. I love hated it. Don't play this. Or go on, do play it. I dare you to play it you filthy cowards.

You know what a shooter game is supposed to have? Guns. What do those guns shoot? Bullets, or lasers, or something meant to hurt an enemy. How do you feel about flipping a coin to determine whether you actually shoot something or not when there is no kind of gun jamming mechanic? Don't like that? Too bad, every gun is fickle and behaves as it wishes. I noticed this within the first few minutes so how on Earth is this not fixed??

This game is a perfect example of why hand made levels are far superior to randomized levels. The randomization isn't even used to any good degree; the levels more or less have the same core design and then things in it just get swapped around. Instead of going to A, B, C, D, it might be C, A, D, B instead. 3-3 is the absolute worst example as it's possible you will be unable to proceed due to the majority of the level simply being out of reach, forcing you to die over and over to get a valid level layout. The combination of a rogue-like and instant death from a bad jump is evil. Hell, sometimes the game knows it failed generating a level so badly it has to redo it on its own. I expect this from an alpha, not a full release. And if you think the jetpack will help, it doesn't work when you're in cold areas, so joke's on you.

Levels 4-2 and 4-3 are their own special kind of hell. The shop isn't even present after 4-1, so you better not die! 4-2 is a very tiny labyrinth filled with enemies, both flying and land, and made up of only breakable walls. You could quite literally shoot out the floor beneath you and die. If you're not swarmed to death at the very beginning, pending a luck roll. 4-3 is a giant level of ""the floor is lava"" and ""5 minibosses are crawling around it"". While you don't [i]need[/i] the jetpack here, it vastly helps to defeat bad level generation otherwise.

And as a super secret bonus treat, if you die too many times in a level, you get kicked out for no reason and are forced to redo the start of that zone.

'[i]B-12[/i]' is a third person/first person shooter hybrid where you fight through 4 worlds that get progressively harder. The levels are supposedly ""randomly"" generated but there is very little variation when it actually comes to generating them. Level layout looks pretty much the same besides little adjustments here and there so the randomized generation is barely present and is very lacking. The game has one too many flaws to warrant a recommendation and majority of the issues lie in the gameplay. I personally don't understand why this game received as much praise as it did considering how much is wrong with it.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
This is where the game could've excelled immensely had the people behind it not implement such questionable game mechanics that do nothing to make the make enjoyable. To start off, one of the biggest complaints I have is the shooting mechanic. Your weapon doesn't always shoot despite there being a sound cue as well as a muzzle flash. As if your weapon has a success rate of whether or not it shoots. Why is this even a thing? Even the enemies can't escape the crappy weapon system. You can hear the sounds of lasers firing non-stop but only see a handful of them actually making their way out of the barrel. Seriously, the shooting in this game is more random than the random level generation.

It doesn't matter what weapon you're using either. There are a multitude of different weapons the player can use and each has their own unique characteristics and drawbacks. Some weapons charge and others act as rapid fire lasers. The weapons could've been fun to use had they not also face the same issue as your regular weapon. Literally [i]every[/i] weapon faces this problem and makes playing the game frustrating because what [b]should[/b] have been a hit isn't a hit because your weapon just decided to malfunction. It's ridiculous and if you're going to pitch a shooting game but have an unstable shooting system, maybe don't make a shooting game?

Then comes the next issue, level design. On top of the lack of variety when it comes to the actual random generation, some of the levels are incredibly frustrating if not nearly impossible to play without the right equipment (specifically the jetpack). So in '[i]B-12[/i]', there are different types of equipment you can use to up your survivability ranging from armor to power upgrades to your character or your weapon and to the most important one, the jetpack which gives you the ability to temporarily fly. Now what's the issue? The issue is that certain levels are almost impossible to play without a jetpack. 

The perfect example is the final boss. It is impossible but not because of the boss, but because of the level design. This is the worst one by far, [b]requiring[/b] the jetpack even though certain areas cause the jetpack to malfunction. Every pet peeve and gripe you had in the game comes back here full force. Almost 90% of the ground deals immense damage, and has overpowered enemies constantly hunting you down. If you die here, you lose the jetpack and there is no way to get it back. At this point the game is over because it's literally impossible to beat the game without a jetpack. How do you screw up the final boss battle so bad you don't even get to see the final boss?

Even worse, the last 2 levels throw the usefulness of the jetpack out the window as if the game wasn't already flawed enough, now you can't even utilize the one crucial piece of equipment you need to survive. You thought having crappy weapons was bad? How about a crappy jetpack as well? Terrible level design on top of a flawed weapon system is a nightmare and a half and make what's already an annoying game to play even more annoying. This game could have been fun, using the jetpack and wall jumping is extremely fun, but the onslaught of bad designs and mechanics suggest that fun isn't what the developer was going for.

[h1]Controls:[/h1]
More responsive than the weapons in the game. I like the wall jumping mechanics and the jetpack is also fun to use (when it works). Sadly these are the only fun aspects of the game as everything else is butchered beyond belief and gunplay is frustrating because the entire concept is based on luck. You can also switch views by pressing the ""Tab"" key which is unique and welcomed but sadly it doesn't help the game at all. All the issues are still present regardless of how you play the game.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
Nothing special here either. It has a particular take on polygon graphics with simple and comprehensive colours. It isn't too bad but gives off a cheap vibe. Personally I don't have any complaints with the visuals, they don't look bland or boring to say the least.

[h1]Audio:[/h1]
Also nothing special, sound effects are limited and not great. The most you'll hear are lasers and enemies charging up shots which gets gruelling rather quickly. Music is also questionable and personally I don't feel they fit the mood and setting of the game.

[h1]Conclusion/TL;DR:[/h1]
'[i]B-12[/i]' is a third person/first person shooter with one too many flaws that make the game more frustrating than fun. It's a shooter where shooting is completely random. You either shoot or you don't regardless of if you pressed fire. This is a permanent issue you're going to have when playing this game. On top of that, the level designs are extremely faulty and require a jetpack (that you don't always have) just to feasibly play. Just let the fact that you can't properly shoot in a shooting game set the tone for the game. It's a terrible structure and makes me wonder why they thought this was a good idea in the first place. It's free, but your time isn't, skip this one and play a shooting game where shooting, [b][i]actually[/i][/b] shoots.",1622079752,1622079776,False,3,2,0.513364076614379883,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's nice to switch between 1st and 3rd person view depending on the situation. There is the platforming and exploring/navigating when I prefer 3rd person and then there is the combat and narrow spaces when to switch to 1st person. Moving feels really good and weighty, you can feel the momentum. You have dashing, dash- and walljumping and a jetpac as a power-up to move around with. Shooting is somewhat reminescent of Mega Man, you can charge your shot (and you have a gun as your hand!). Another thing that this game made me think of for some reason is the Bugs Bunny/Duffy Duck/Marvin Martian episodes that take place in space, which is - let's face it - probably one of the best associations there is. The energy mechanic is also nice, makes you think a bit when to use your gun, jetpack, shield, etc. 

Generally the game feels like it is made with heart, by which I mean that the dev has a vision of what the game should be like, what it should feel like, what kind of atmosphere it should have, and actually manages to capture this vision. I really like that you can see your body, arms and legs when in 1st person. I like that I can pick up destroyed enemy robot's hand (also weapons) only to whip up other robots with it. The enemy robots look nice and funny. Sounds & music fit well and compliment the atmosphere.

I wish there will be more exploring and secrets to find, maybe some sort of collectibles, items/non-talking or broken NPC robots/flora&fauna/art/something that hints about the lore for a carefully exploring player, generally I mean something little to fleshen out the game experience a bit, although I think this game doesn't need anything too complicated for the certain kind of simplicity is one of it's virtues (for example it's nice that it doesn't have any text).

I also encourage you to try the dev's other game, Hoverbike Joust (alpha), available at itch.io, really great fun.",1494445761,1494445761,True,18,0,0.746643424034118652,10,False,False,True,False,,,
