And really, I didn't expected much : just a fun homage to one of the best ""so bad it's good"" movie.

The gameplay is atrocious (something I didn't expect from such a basic sidescroller), just like the level design (the same cheap trick over and over).

Manos (and Torgo) deserved better.

Introduction:
MANOS MANOS AND MORE MANOS?!?! 
MANOS: The Hands of Fate™ is a unique and unexpected addition to the world of video games, based on the cult classic horror film of the same name. Developed by a team of passionate indie developers, the game attempts to capture the essence of the original movie while delivering an interactive experience that's both intriguing and bewildering. Prepare for a journey that blends nostalgia, horror, and absurdity in ways you've never quite imagined.

Gameplay:
The gameplay in MANOS: The Hands of Fate™ is an eccentric mix of point-and-click adventure, platforming, and surreal exploration. Players take on the role of Mike, who must navigate a series of bizarre locations while rescuing his family from the clutches of the enigmatic Master and his eerie cult. The controls are relatively simple, allowing players to move, interact with objects, and engage in occasional combat sequences. However, the lack of proper tutorials can lead to confusion, especially for newcomers.

One of the game's standout features is its non-linear progression. Players can choose between various paths and decisions, each leading to unique outcomes and endings. This dynamic adds replay value as players are encouraged to explore different choices in subsequent playthroughs. However, the lack of clarity in consequences might frustrate players looking for a more guided experience.

Visuals:
The visual presentation of MANOS: The Hands of Fate™ is a double-edged sword. The developers have intentionally designed the graphics to mimic the low-budget, grainy style of the original movie. While this creates a nostalgic connection for fans of the film, it can also be jarring for those accustomed to modern, polished visuals. The deliberately awkward animations and pixelated art style contribute to the game's surreal atmosphere, though some players might find it off-putting.

World Design:
The game's world design is simultaneously intriguing and disorienting. Locations are meticulously crafted to resemble scenes from the film, from the haunting desert landscapes to the eerie lodge. Exploring these areas can be both captivating and frustrating, as the lack of a clear map or direction can result in aimless wandering. This design choice, while meant to evoke a sense of mystery, might lead to player frustration, especially for those seeking a more streamlined experience.

Sound and Music:
MANOS: The Hands of Fate™ nails the audio aspect by delivering an eerie and unsettling soundtrack that effectively captures the eerie atmosphere of the source material. The voice acting, while intentionally exaggerated to mimic the style of the original movie, can be polarizing. Some players might appreciate the quirky charm, while others could find it grating over time.

Horror and Comedy:
The game blends horror and absurd comedy in a way that's both unique and bewildering. The surreal scenarios and unexpected encounters often result in unintentional hilarity. Whether it's fending off bizarre enemies or engaging in strange interactions, the game consistently keeps players on their toes, never quite knowing what to expect next. This juxtaposition might not resonate with everyone, but it's undoubtedly one of the game's defining characteristics.

Conclusion:
MANOS: The Hands of Fate™ is a game that defies convention and expectations. Its deliberate embrace of the bizarre and its determination to faithfully pay homage to the cult film might alienate some players while delighting others. The non-linear progression, combined with the strange world and unpredictable encounters, creates an experience that is both captivating and confounding. If you're a fan of the original movie and have a penchant for the eccentric, MANOS: The Hands of Fate™ might just be the oddball adventure you've been waiting for. Just be prepared to embrace the weirdness and roll with the surreal punches.",1691719482,1691719482,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Though I've never seen the movie (at the time of writing), I think it has an interesting story about a cult-leader with minions and maidens who conducts rituals to worship the god of darkness, Manos. I also think that the Master's costume has a cool design, a black cape with two big red hands on the inside. Even if the story isn't the main focus, it held my attention, and it was complimented by its presentation. This game has a grainy filter, just like an old horror movie, and some stages have tunnel vision lighting; the cutscenes in between stages are presented through well drawn pixel-art illustrations; I also like how the in-game graphics go for a more muted color pallet with a few contrasts to highlight important characters and objects, all of which have interesting designs as well; finally, the music and sound effects also help give the game a creepy, mysterious atmosphere to it. 

As for the gameplay, Manos: The Hands of Fate is similar to an old-school Castlevania title, but much more beginner friendly. The hand statues throughout the stage give you plenty of health pickups and extra lives to keep going, and the shotgun powerup makes fighting enemies easier; my only problem is that you lose the shotgun as soon as you take damage, which I find annoying.

I should also mention that each of the 8 stages has a ""Hand of Fate"" hidden in it. All but the one in stage 6 are pretty easy to find as long as you take the time to explore each stage. When you find one, it increases your health bar, and you have to find all 8 to get the good ending, just like grabbing all the Chaos Emeralds in a Sonic game.

It's a pretty short game, one that you can beat in about half an hour, but it's still a good game nonetheless.

Manos é um jogo de plataformas 2D que lembra muitos os jogos clássicos de nintendo, mega drive, etc.
O jogo é bem básico, você controla Mike que possui um revolver para se defender, você também pode encontrar uma 12 pelas fases e pode encontrar as Mãos do Destino que aumentam seus corações.
O jogo é bem rápido, são 8 fases e as mesmas não são tão longas, porém o jogo não é tão fácil quanto parece. Mesmo na dificuldade mais fácil você vai encontrar obstáculos que vão te irritar enquanto você tenta passá-los, assim como nos clássicos jogos de plataforma NES. 
O jogo é bem divertido e vale a pena jogar nas outras dificuldades pra ver o que o jogo tem a oferecer e até mesmo jogar como Torgo. Eu mesmo terminei o jogo e estou jogando novamente como Torgo no Nightmare pra tentar completar as conquistas. E o preço está muito bom, vale a pena comprar.

Esse jogo é bem anterior ao game do Nerd (um dos chefes do Manos é ""homenageado"" nele) e mostra que eles ainda não estavam naquele grau de jogabilidade, mas mesmo assim consegue divertir.

A história é baseada num filme B antigo que muitos consideram ser uma das piores películas de todos os tempos (rivalizando com o Ed Wood). Nesse caldeirão você pode misturar zumbis, monstros, aliens entre tantos outros.

Jogo de plataforma / ação bem curtinho e divertido, mas com alguns probleminhas que atrapalham um pouco:

- Curva de dificuldade estranha. No início é muito fácil e depois fica bem difícil... você consegue passar muitas fases perdendo poucas vidas para, mais para frente, ficar encalhado em fases e usando vários continues.

- O jogo tem um bug estranho com o controle do playstation. Todas vezes que eu dou Continue no game, eu preciso desconectar o controle e plugá-lo de novo porque ele perde as configurações (isso sem eu sair do jogo, muito estranho mesmo).

- Em algumas poucas fases, o checkpoint é mal planejado e, se você não agir rápido, pode morrer em poucos segundos. 

 - E claro, o famoso personagem com pés de manteiga que sempre escorrega nas plataformas e cai nos buracos.

Tirando esses problemas, é um jogo divertido para quem quiser se aventurar no estilo 8bits com uma história estranha.",1639764020,1639764020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Manos: The Hands of Fate was at one time an obscure, low-budget movie made on a bet by a fertilizer salesman.  After being rediscovered by a TV station, it would later appear on Mystery Science Theater 3000, in one of the most popular episodes. Now, this ""awful"" movie is a cult classic.  Thanks to Freakzone, it is also a retro platformer.

The story follows a family on a trip, who get lost and stop for the night at a rather sinister lodge.  On arriving, the caretaker just nervously keeps saying ""master would not approve"", but relents, and lets them spend the night.  The place turns out to be home to a polygamist cult who are in some kind of hibernation.  The story doesn't actually make much sense, and visually the movie is just bad. Yet it's very watchable, and Torgo is a memorable character.  

Which brings me to MANOS: The Hands of Fate The Video Game Director's Cut, which was shortened to MANOS because of confusion with a game with a similar name.  

This is a retro platformer done in an 8-bit style.  It looks, plays, and feels like an NES game.  There are a lot of those, but this one actually plays pretty well.  So long as you are using a gamepad, the controls feel right.  I feel it's one of the better NES-style games on Steam.  

Thematically, the game is very liberal with the plot, which was kind of typical for movie tie-in games on NES.  Not only does it feature Manos, but also movies like Robot Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space are referenced, along with old video games.  There is one level which parodies a notorious Castlevania area, which in an older version used the quote ""What a terrible night to have a curse!"" (the Director's Cut changes this to ""What a terrible night to have a missing wife and daughter!"").  The game is, pretty much in its entirety, an affectionate parody, but not at the expense of the gameplay.

The game, is hard.  The difficulty, mostly, is not in poor design, and everything can be overcome with practice and timing.  I would, though, contrast this game to the company's other game, the similar Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures.  That game's challenges are sadistic, but also kind of cheap.  In comparison, this game feels more clever.  However, between the two are many similarities (including a boss fight that is in both games).  

The Director's Cut version differs from the original release (which is no longer available).  Cutscenes have been added, native controller support, a film grain effect, a new level, some levels were overhauled, and the ability to play as Torgo was added.  

This is not going to be a top-10 greatest game.  It's also not in the same league as the NES classics such as Mega Man 2 or Mario 3.  What it is, is a challenging platformer that pays tribute to weirdness.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If that doesn't sound appealing to you, then pass on this game.  If you played old games and watched MST3K during bouts on insomnia, definitely check on this.",1593591537,1593591537,True,4,0,0.592849016189575195,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: Short duration, B movie references galore. ""rage"" (AVGN) oriented encounter design, insta death pits. Loads of health points and checkpoints. No staying power.

I played this game in 10 minutes bursts, only to find that I had not, in fact, played it for an hour, like it felt I did. I trudged unto the second last level in 45 minutes and was fairly saturated. The gimmick is always the same, scroll the screen moving forward, learn the BS pattern of silly B movie monsters and learn the precise timing and positioning to proceed. Thankfully the game uses a lot of checkpoints and gives back a lot of health through power ups which helps cushion things along. The controls are sufficiently tight and the level design did feel playtested enough that there would be no unwinnable situations. 

It is simply not my type of gameplay at all. Hooking you because you do not want to give up and make a tiny bit of progress everytime. Testing your patience and perseverance, but when I take a step back I realize I have not had any enjoyment. Serves as a good summary of the kind of experiences you'd see on the AVGN show or maybe even the AVGN adventure platformer game.

Thing is the reason I enjoyed AVGN was to catharzize and liberate me from all those memories of frustration I had with my NES as a kid. Feeling I had to play through games because my parents spent good money on them, but getting silly dealth oriented level design and frustrating broken mechanics for my trouble.

Seems like AVGN just fetishizes the type of gameplay or has a masochistic side, or maybe it just turned into his brand to play these things and yell at them, to the point where the profit motive leads him to finding more, and even creating more of them himself.

As far as I am concerned this type of gameplay is a relic of the past, and should stay in the past. Especially since the plot here is very loose, is just a collection of obscure references and assuming you ""git gud"" the game will end on you before you realize it anyways.

lol... y es precisamente lo que hace este jueguito; a forma de parodia es un juego que esta basado en la peor pelicula de terror gringa (estadounidense) existente (ojo que terminando el juego la vi por mera curiosidad en joetube... xD).

>La historia:
Pues... ni idea de que bergha; a grandes rasgos:eres un padre que llega ahi a una casita, y pues tu esposa e hija son ""secuestradas"" por un loco que adora al dios ""Manos"" (yo pense que la historia estaba meh, pero asi esta de por si en la peli).

>Gameplay:
Es un jueguito que se parece a los castlevanias viejitos de nientiendo, o bien mario bros pero el primero que estaba dificilillo. Con pistola en vez de latigo♥ vas de escenita en escenita, te la aprendes te trolean, mueres y asi hasta que logres sortear todos los obstaculos.

>Lo bueno: 
-a diferencia de la peli, es un buen juego y con curva de dificultad media. Cada nivel se pone mas dificil que el anterior.
-Tienes upgrades de vida y desbloqueables (como personajes y asi, es algo digno de aclamar para un jueguito hecho de forma trol)
-Las referencias a los jueguitos del estilo ♥ (mario y castlevania)

>Lo malo:
-La duracion, lo acabas en maximo 1hr el juego consta de 8 stages con multiples bosses.

The movie bombed at the box office, and was panned by critics (With an average score of an amazing 1.9 out of 10 on IMDB). It is often said that while it is one of the worst horror movies of all time, it is also one of the most famous ""B Movies"" ever too, along with movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Anyways, this game is based on that cult film. In the game, you control a man named Mikey and you go into a spooky mansion named Valley Lodge where weird and strange things occur, leaving your'e family behind. It's a platform game, and while it has some good points, there are some noticible negatives that push this game down quite a bit. Like I said earlier, you control Mikey, platforming through the terrifying 8 stages of horror. But don't you worry! Because Mikey here is prepared with a handgun! This gun is your primary weapon throughout the game, but you can upgrade it to a shotgun to get a triple shot. It's useful, but it goes away if you get hit once, (I hate it when games do that stupid stuff!). You can also optionally collect secret hands throughout the game, this will permanantly increase your health, which is very helpful. The controls for this game are very good, Mikey walks at a brisk pace, stops on a dime when you stop, the jump feels good, and the gun fires as soon as you press the button, or key. The graphics are also pretty good. I like pixelated games, and the graphics are bright and colorful. However, while I like the presentation for the most part, the gameplay is where the game starts to fall apart. The game is of the most simplistic, basic platformers I've ever played, the level design is too basic for my liking, and it's the same basic platforming too. Really, it's either just jump from small block to small block to me, or a stage where there is literally just a single level with maybe some stairs to go up. There is a shooter stage, but I'll get to that in just a second. The music, oh god is it forgettable! It's super quiet and extremely boring too. After playing, I couldn't remember a SINGLE tune in my head, nor would I want too. And finally, the game is super short and ridiculously easy. You want to know how long my playthrough of this game was on the normal setting? 34 minutes, I'm not kidding. The stages go by so quickly and there is literally no challenge in the game. In fact the only difficult thing in this game is when enemies just come out of nowhere, knock you back off a tiny platform, and die. That's not challenge, that's just being annoying and cheap. Remember when I said about the shooting stage? That's also too easy! Just fly in one corner and press the buttion as fast as you can. NOT. CHALLENGING! Keep in mind, there is nothing wrong with making a game easy, but this? This is just too easy, enemies have extremely predictible patterns, and very VERY rarely take two shots to kill. Bosses? Got nothing to say, too easy as well with super easy patterns too. Well, after all that, do I recommend this game? Well, can't you tell? It's a super basic, super easy, and also a super boring game in my opinion. I do know it is on mobile devices, and in that case, it isn't the worst ever, especially considering the quality of some apps out there. But as a PC game? No, this game isn't all that great. I know that it's cheap to buy, but paying 2 dollars for a game that's easy, basic, and super short for PC? There are better games on PC for the same price. If it's 50 cents (like how much it was when I bought it,) That's a complete maybe, but only that. Again, this is my opinion and I will completely respect other's, but in my case. I didn't have much fun with this one, and at it's best, it's mediocre.

On est ici face à un retro-platformer inspiré des jeux nes les plus génériques, des plateformes, des ennemis, une arme, une arme bonus à l'occasion, quelques boss déjà vus et revus et c'est pesé. Graphiquement, la surabondance de filtres graphiques hideux pour faire ""comme à l'époque"" nuit non seulement au jeu, mais aussi vraisemblablement à votre score au prochain test ophtalmo que vous passerez tellement certains effets sont pénibles. Pour le reste c'est du 8-bit sans surprise, il y a bien quelques références dans certains sprites, mais rien qui fasse sauter au plafond. Le scénario est à chier, mais j'imagine que c'est le but recherché, donc je ne sais pas si on peut vraiment le reprocher au jeu ? (je vais dire que oui :D)

Le jeu n'est pas vraiment difficile si on persévère un peu, mais il est terriblement basé sur des vieux concepts de die & retry avec des mobs et des pièges placés de manière vraiment injuste qui vous tueront à coup sur lors de votre première rencontre car ils doivent être anticipés, et soyons francs, c'était déjà du game design merdique à l'époque, alors 20 ans après c'est toujours aussi peu bienvenu. Le jeu est assez court, donc la frustration ne sera pas longue, il y a bien des modes additionnels qui se débloquent pour refaire l'aventure à nouveau, mais comment dire, on a quand même vraiment pas envie.

Sans être le pire jeu jamais créé, MANOS s'avère finalement être beaucoup trop médiocre pour susciter un intérêt autre que l'appel nostalgique aux fans du film, si c'est votre cas, il pourrait vous fournir une heure ou deux de fun et de plongée dans l'univers du film, mais si vous êtes comme moi et que vous n'avez pas la moindre idée de ce qu'est MANOS, passez votre chemin sans regrets.",1479890505,1479890505,False,3,0,0.513931930065155029,0,False,False,False,False,,,

MANOS è un gioco platform 2d MOLTO vecchio stile (8 bit). Di solito i platform mi piacciono, anche quando hanno un look da vecchia scuola... ma Manos pecca in un paio di caratteristiche importanti: non c'è nessuna musica, e i comandi non sono buoni. La grafica è forse persino troppo vecchia scuola e gli effetti sonori sono fastidiosi. Il gameplay è ok. 

Inoltre non mi è piaciuto che il sistema di checkpoint mi ha impedito di collezionare tutte le mani del destino... anche se non mi sono servite, a dire il vero (ognuna ti dà un punto vita extra)

Delle 2 ore di gioco totale ho passato 100 minuti nel livello 7... O_O (è  in bianco e nero :\ )

Sconsigliato, a meno che non sei veramente un fan dei platform retrò.

- Comandi imprecisi

Manos takes place in a creepy mansion where a family of three meet up with a crazy man named Torgo who is the protector of the mansion and he advises them to stay away, cause the Master will kill them.

The movie in itself is a marvelous joke and it's really funny and I highly suggest getting friends together, getting absolutely wasted and watching it, cause it's a delight.

But enough about the movie and let's get into the game.

The game in itself is alright for the most part. I had a lot of fun revisiting scenes from the movie and the music is a spot on 8 Bit rendition of the music from the film which I though was incredibly impressive.

The game has great graphics and the art style is similar to other games in the 8 Bit genre, it's also really similar to the follow up game by FreakZone which of course is the AVGN game.

Gameplay wise it's a simple platformer where you run and gun enemies, but the fun thing is that you run into other bad movies like Plan 9 from Outer Space and The Giant Claw. 

The game is pretty hard, but never impossible, keep playing and you will complete it. Some sections are difficult, but with enough tries you can easily finish the game in an hour, but this game has some replay value like a Hardcore mode and you can play the game again as Torgo after you finish the game with Michael.

The game has a few negatives. The game is really short, as stated before you can finish the game easily in an hour maybe even faster. Also the controls are incredibly slippery and take some time getting used to, but after you find your footing it get's easier.

Overall I enjoyed Manos: The Hands of Fate Director's Cut, but I still suggest watching the movie first (which will be the greatest challenge of all), but since the game is so cheap you can get a pretty decent game on your hands.

Pros:
+ Nails everything about the movie
+ Fun

Cons:
- Short
- Slippery Controls

Two things push it into negative territory: an anti-virus conflict that prevented me from playing for months, and being designed to be annoying.

""MANOS"" is both designed as a callback platformer shooter to movie licence NES titles, as well as an homage to the infamous MST3k episode featuring the ""film"".  The production values and controls are much better than the games it's based on and it's thankfully briefer than the movie.

Unfortunately, the horrible film-grain shadow obstructing your view, the airplane hand of fate, certain checkpoints (namely the nigh-unescapable pentultimate one on the last level) and generally uninteresting bosses aren't enjoyable or even funny, even with a few drinks in you.  Most of the MST3k references and the game in general will sail over most potential buyers' heads, and only the torgo theme stands out amongst the soundtrack.

In short, this is too niche and annoying to recommend.  It's pretty short and easy, but ends up being too similar to what it's mimicking.",1471192821,1471192821,False,3,0,0.556109189987182617,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game takes me back to my youth when every movie had an NES tie in game that was usually lackluster or crap.

The cut scenes look straight out of ninja gaiden and the hodgepodge of enemies (all seemingly taken from MST3K) As for the gameplay itself its a platformer with simple rules yet great controls. 

This game is an obvious labor of love. The sprites, levels, and music are all well done, and Manos's strange story actually fits perfectly in an NES game where story telling was vague.

MANOS: The Hands of Fate - Director's Cut is a very short and frustrating game. Set in a retro horror world with an NES homage, you control Mike and play through the game Super Mario style. Be prepared for some anger-inducing, blood-pressure-raising moments, especially on higher levels of difficulty. 

I've played my fair share of difficult indie platformers so i'm trying my best to separate the justified and unjustified rage-quits. Of course there will be times when you see that flying UFO, but forget that it was coming and reacted too late. Or the times when the swinging spikes just happen to clip you mid-jump. This is all normal in a challenging platformer. The issue comes with respawn locations, poor enemy placement, or poor design choices. For example, one respawn left me on the last (elevator) level on a single-block ledge with two flying eyeballs almost instantly bumping me off seconds upon revival. Another time, a creature bugged out on the stairs leading downwards, getting stuck in my path. Not able to kill him, i tried to jump over him which ended up killing me because i was not in direct contact with the stairs, causing me to touch the bottom frame of the game.....Dying too many times will reset your score and force you to replay the entire level, reliving through the terrible situations previously dealt with.

[h1]Score[/h1]
I actually like MANOS for the most part as it was more fun than aggravating; however, due to a couple bugs and really poor design choices, i really can't advise getting this game at the moment. If patched or fixed, I would definitely recommend this game as the retro style adaptation added a nice flair setting it apart from the common crowd of indie platformers out there.

The platformer part is decend, most enemies die after one shot from revolver, bosses are fair game. Graphics are pixel art, you can switch off the grain effect.

Someting more about gameplay:
- the flow is decent, you have unlimited continues from the main menu if you lose all lives albeit you will lose all points (who cares anyway)
- there is one additional weapon - the shotgun, which is quite powerful one hit killing enemies but you lose it after being hit just one
- the locations are very nicely done with very little unfairly positioned enemies (maybe once or twice I've encountered such a dick move that you can die seconds after respawning if you would not react very quickly)
- music is quite nice, but this is not the main point of the game

The big plus of this one are many references to movies - you can find a Giant Claw, this ape with a radio/diving helmet thing on it's head, one level that is inspired by Plan 9 from Outer Space and so on. 

Overall I would recommend this game. You will get a decent treat for not that much money. 

Additional comments - there is a different ending when you collect all so called Hands of Fate items.

Sure, the knock back was beyond even what Castlevania made you work with, but hey, I could deal with it. That is, of course, until I reached the auto-scroller that obscured your vision... then the knock back became a major issue.

Speaking of auto-scrolling, I assumed that the first one would also be the last; you know, just toss in that old convention of the platformer needing at least one of them. I could deal again, I personally don't like them, but I assumed I had gotten the worst out the way, or at least half of it, since sometimes they toss in a second one just to remind you that this is an NES style platformer. Boy was I wrong, as the last half of the game is almost nothing BUT vision obscured auto-scrollers!

So now that the fun had been completely sucked out of the game, I reached the vertical auto-scroller pulled straight out of Castlevania III... except, again, with obscured vision, because that never gets old, right? Only it came complete with checkpoints that were designed in such a way that enemy spawns could kill you within two seconds of your own spawn for that authentic controller snapping frustration of losing your last life by getting knocked off a small platform by a giant eyeball within a second of respawning.

This game falls under Nintendo hard to be sure, but such a thing is divided into two camps; cheap and an actual, well constructed challenge. When I die, I feel like it's not because I lack skill but because I was cheated: the knock back, the fact that I cannot see anything while the screen pushes me along, the blunt and forced memorization in order to get anywhere in half of the game, all of the slam head into brick wall until it gives tactics are in full force in this game.

Manos is a 2d platformer (think mario) 
You have a gun with unlimited ammo and there is also a shot gun that can be found that shoots 3 Shots but if you get hit its back to the revolver.
Its basic platform stuff. shot enemies, jump obstacles/pits, and fight a boss at the end of each level.
there is also a shooter board where you fly a plane also a few side scrolling boards and a vertical scroller.
There is a hand of Manos on each level to find and if you get them all at the end you'll say something different and your family will be there.

First, let's list the pros.



Pros:
Funny
Feels like an Old School NES game, specifically Castlevania
Challenging
Cheap
Has the same spirit as the original



Cons:
Only Controls you can fix are if you are playing with a gamepad
Short
No Manos themed Emoticons and Trading Cards (I'm normally sort of against this, but I'd love having a Torgo emoticon on steam)

You can also get a shotgun that fires 3 shots (like the Spreader from Contra), but you lose it if you are hit once. You can also find other items by shooting the hand statues through the levels. There are flashing Hands Of Fate items that increase your max health too, and you can an achievement if you find them all. Another novelty worth mentioning is the film grain, which can be turned on and off in the Options menu.

Sure maybe there wasn't a part with a plane fight or an underground sanctuary, but if it was accurate to the movie then I would have cut off my Manos long before the 30 minute mark. (It's honestly a pretty forgiving and solid action platformer.)

As Mike, you must survive through Valley Lodge by leaving your family behind in order to jump, run and shoot snakes with a pistol. Sometimes you get a shotgun, which shoots a three-way projectile that won't hit anything else than whatever's in front of you. The first two levels of the game follow the movie, but everything is thrown out the window once you reach Level 3, which looks like Castlevania... as in it reuses the same graphics! Also, the boss of this level was supposedly so good it got reused in AVGN Adventures.

When Level 4 starts, your protagonist says ""What a horrible night to have a missing wife and child!"". Enough said.

As the game advances, the game stops bothering with Manos and becomes a Mystery Science Theater 3000 tribute. Tom Servo does a cameo in Level 2 and most levels involve enemies from other B-movies like Hobgoblins, Robot Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Why call it Manos then? The setting fails because the writing is all centered on references, trying really hard to wink at you and say ""Hey this happened in the movie, right?""

The game could have been good if the gameplay was interesting, but it isn't. You only shoot in a horizontal line and enemies just bounce back and forth forever, making fighting a joyless affair. Bosses are equally as mindless. The only challenge the game offers comes from occasionally unfair enemy and trap placement, where upon hitting them, you will bounce back in a pit and die. The game sometimes spice things up by making the whole screen dark around you, preventing you from anticipating obstacles and multiplying deaths where you fall in pits. Other levels are autoscrollers, which don't really have a reason for happening and forces you to progress at the game's pace. There's also a vertical autoscrolling level that rips off Castlevania 3.

Overall presentation is also weak. The graphics and sound are appropriately NES-styled, but they have no substance and fail at making an impression. The game also offers difficulty levels, but don't bother with them: all they do is remove health pickups, shotguns and checkpoints from levels. Yes, it makes the game harder, but it doesn't make it fun.

Manos will take you about 45 minutes to finish, maybe more if you want to get the full ending or finish the Torgo playthrough, which just switches sprites, makes you do lots of annoying noises and is slippery as all hell. The complete unoriginality is what mainly kills the game though; it doesn't attempt to add anything new to the old-school game formula, unlike games like Shovel Knight, Binding of Isaac or Axiom Verge.

here's what I thought I was buying. If I had the money back then I would have bought the PC version right after I bought the IOS version. But then mysteriously it vanished, and I thought this steam release would be what I wanted. It is not.  Because of added shadow effects.

[EDIT: It appears you can shut off the lighting effects in options, by switching off the grain effects. This helps a lot in the visibility portion, but the forced shadow effects that don't fit into the game still create a huge problem later in the game when an already difficult game is made more so just because you can't see where you're supposed to jump. Then they also spawn you right where enemies can knock you into an instakill pit. I still reccomend it, its a great game, but let us turn off the shadows.

This game is really horrid, it's basicly everything wrong with NES homage games. It looks ugly as hell, the game design seems intended to kill you instead of giving you a challenge to deal with. Even if this game was made bad in a ironic way, there is no actual fun to be derived from that. The only humor in it is ""Did you see this MST3K episode? Well here's a reference to that"". Which I wouldn't mind if I was speaking to my nerd friends, but just saying ""look at these funnier people and what they joked about"" does not constitute as a good joke for it's own premise.

About half the levels take place in the dark with only a small cone of light around you, which wouldn't be so bad if your cone of light wasn't barely bigger than your character. This creates a large amount of problems because the game just loves to throw enemies at you that knock you back into pits. You could potentially deal with this problem by just shooting what's coming up, but a lot of enemies home in on you from above, where you cannot shoot or are outright invincible. The final level is a auto-scrolling level that goes up, while you can't see what's actually appearing above. If you go too fast you will not notice the ball and chain that has just spawned that will knock you back all the way. There is a moment where they do this twice, one after another.

There is one level which is a plane level where you control a huge ass plane that covers atleast 1/6th of the screen. You die in one hit and it is nearly uncontrollable. The boss of that level is a giant chicken head and a plane which shoots small bullets you can barely see.

The game also just loves to cheat, early on there is a boss which changes your invincibility period to half a second, thus causing it to hit you multiple times if it so deems. This boss also is later reused in another game made by the same developer, so that tells you the effort put into it.

The music is decent, though. It's functional and does it's job well, never sounding unpleasant. However, not the same can be said of the sound effects. There is one enemy in the game that has a noise that can be accurately described as ""Screamer midi as back in the dial up days"". There is a UFO enemy that's spawned everywhere in one level that just the most painful noise known to man.

If you want to get a good homage to old NES games, I would suggest Shovel Knight. It is a better game than most NES games. If you want a funny bad game, just play Bad Rats, it's better than this is ever gonna get.

Oh also, the game outright didn't want to accept my DualShock 3 controller, no matter what program I used or input I set it at.

Update: As of this date, the dev has personally told me that they added a health bar to the plane level, this atleast negates my criticisms about that part. (Also 69% found this review helpful right now which is in fact Very Nice)

Update 2: The dev of this game tweetsearches himself and whined about this review for 3 days on his twitter. Got blocked when I told him in 3 different ways to stop tweetsearching himself.

The first Manos-Vania type game on Steam.
It's a Patrick Swayze Christmas! ""Manos"" has arrived on Steam!! 
I admit I double-dipped on this one, since I own it on iOS, and it was worth every penny both times! This version has a great continue feature that comes in handy (pun intended) and plays like it was designed for the NES when you use a controller. I plugged in my Xbox 360 Wired Controller and it worked perfectly. 

Tons of variety in levels, classic Castlevania-style platforming and more MST3K references than you can shake an interocitor at!  

Are you a fan of NES-era platforming games? Are you a fan of MST3K? If so you already own this, and aren't reading this review unless you are really really bored. 

Remember: Watch Out For Snakes! 

This game was great?

The question though, is the game as bad as the movie it pays homage to, or is it worth your time?

Suprisingly tight controls, effective character guidance during automated screen movement and entertaining cut scenes / dialogue.  Forgiving gameplay allows newcomers to have a go at it, without feeling overwhelmed.  Comparitively speaking, there are a few spikes in difficulty in some areas. Nothing game-breaking.

There is replay value in the additional difficulties and modes.  Secrets can be found as well.

I might actually open one of my copies of MST3K Manos and watch it on the big screen with the Mrs.  The Master will not be pleased...neither will my wife.",1438303566,1438366793,True,32,8,0.638373196125030518,0,True,False,False,False,,,
