My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707221370,1707221370,True,1,0,0.492063462734222412,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Честно говоря, ожидание совершенно не соответствует реальности.
От хоррора почти ничего нет, кроме парочки скримеров в конце и смешков призрака.
В игре всего 4 достижения.
Вроде мало, значит, их будет очень просто получить, но не тут-то было.
Для одного из них нужно пройти игру за короткое время, а если быть точнее, то за 9 минут и 30 секунд или меньше.
Запутался в комнатах и проехал не туда? Начинай игру заново.
Замешкался и забыл отправить фотографию? Начинай игру заново.
Промешкал момент, когда появляется призрак и не сделал фото вовремя? Начинай игру заново.
Помимо прочего в игре ещё имеется какой-то баг с последней фотографией, который не исправили за целых 8 лет.
Я понимаю, что он у небольшого количества игроков был, но неужели это нельзя исправить?
Тем более смешно с того, что об этом баге разработчики написали на главной странице.
Вместо решения проблем, на главной же странице, есть совет, что обойти данную игровую ошибку можно играя в оконном режиме или вообще перезапуском игры.
Очень «приятно», когда ты проходишь игру на время, чтобы получить ачивку, введённую самими создателями этого небольшого мирка с призраками, а потом перезапускаешь её, чтобы начать сказку про белого бычка, если ошибка будет повторяться из раза в раз.
Ну да ладно, у меня проблем с этим не возникло.
Однако, с достижением возникли некоторые проблемы, которые касаются только моей рукoжoпoсти.
Сюжет присутствует, но только записочный.
Что произошло в конце игры я не понял, наверно, как раз из-за того, что не переводил эти самые записки и не углублялся в историю, но призрак, который убивает топором владельца робота?
Что?
С каких пор нематериальные потусторонние существа могут держать что-то материальное?
Они долго тренировались над этим прямо как Сэм Уитт в фильме «Привидение»?
Если да, тогда ладно, не буду придираться.
Камера от первого лица у робота, на которую тратится заряд, не слишком удобная и очень быстро выключается.
Управление роботом отвратное.

Story:

You control a small drone which is sent to an abandoned cabin to investigate the acts of vandalism, however the more you explore, you realize that the cabin is haunted by a ghost.

The story of Shutter is pretty basic horror stuff. You learn most of the backstory through notes you can find in the home and it's fine for the most part, but nothing really amazing. I was never gripped and wanted to learn more, however it's not terribly offensive stuff and what's there is fine.

Graphics:

This is where Shutter stumbles the most. The game looks pretty bad and honestly looks like a low effort unity asset flip. If I had to give the best example, imagine exploring what feels like a plastic doll house, everything just look rough around the edges and very cheap, which does lessens the atmosphere of the game.

Audio:

The audio is also a very mixed bag. It's not bad by any means, there's some really good ambience that helps building a decent atmosphere, however I believe a good chunk of the sound effects are royalty free, but I feel like they sound fine in action unlike other indie horror games. 

Gameplay:

As I said before, you control a small drone which you drive around the cabin and you're basically taking pictures of items which then leads into puzzles you have to solve to progress. Often then not you're looking through a very dark cabin to find  items the ghost has interacted with and then you have to look for a way to unlock more of the house.

For the most part the game works fine, but it's very lackluster in what you get to do. Every so often the people outside upgrade the drone with other items like spectral or night vision which makes thing slightly easier, but not by much. The biggest pain is looking for items to take pictures of cause sometimes these items are either well hidden or blend into the environment which makes spotting them hard.

One time I actually drove around the house for roughly 15 minutes looking for a way to advance and then I broke down to watch a walkthrough to see that I missed an item that was hidden so well I drove past it multiple times. The game is also very trigger happy with jumpscares, especially in the final few chapters of the game where it assaults your sense constantly. 

However I still had a fun time, with the sort of investigation you have to do as the game advances and a lot of the puzzles you have to solve are simple enough so they don't get annoying, this is more or less a problem that the final few levels of the game face and since the game is really short (roughly an hour long) you don't have to deal with it for long.

Verdict

For the price Shutter is not a bad game to spend an evening on if you like the horror genre, but it's not's the greatest game either. It has it's issues like some bad puzzle design and cheap looking graphics, but if you're bored and want something spooky to play, you could do much worse.

Final Rating:
6/10

Pros:
+ Interesting concept
+ Some fun puzzles

Cons:
- Graphics are terrible
- The final few levels suck 
- Really short

[u]Dunkel, Horror[/u]

RAVEN, so heißt das neue Überwachungssystem, mit dem ein kleines Haus nebst Schuppen und Garten  komplett überwacht wird und alles wird von fern gesteuert. Trotzdem häufen sich die Meldungen über Einbrüche, Krawall und störende Nachbarn - ohne dass jedoch ein konkreter Übeltäter ausfindig gemacht werden kann.

Du steuerst einen fahrbaren und ferngesteuerten Roboter. Klein, wendig, ausgestattet mit Lampe und Kamera ist es Deine Aufgabe, die vom ""Dispatcher"" geforderten Aufgaben zu erledigen: Nachschauen, fotografieren, Beweise sichern. So nach und nach eröffnet sich eine makabre Geschichte, und die Erfüllung der eigentlichen Aufgaben scheint plötzlich nicht mehr das Hauptziel zu sein...

Es dürfte ungefähr 10 Min. dauern, bis Du die Steuerung des kleinen Roboters intus hast - denn die ist zunächst gar nicht so einfach. Das Hauptproblem ist das ständige Umdenken, wenn sich die Sicht ändert. Von schräger Draufsicht zu zwei unterschiedlichen Egoperspektiven, dazu eine Lampe, deren Batterie sich rapide leert und immer wieder aufgeladen werden muss (wenigstens geht das automatisch und recht schnell).

Natürlich schreibe ich nichts über die weiteren technischen Möglichkeiten, z.B. die der Kamera, denn dadurch würde ich schon einen Teil des Spiels verraten. Optisch hat mir das Spiel gefallen, die Vertonung leider weniger, da hätte ich Besseres erwartet. Die Steuerung funktioniert tadellos und ist auch mit Tastatur/Maus intuitiv erlernbar (s.o.).

Im ""speedrun"" kann man das Spiel in unter 9 1/2 Min durchspielen, das ist aber für einen normalen Durchgang utopisch. Ich habe etwas um die 100 Min. benötigt, um das Spielende zu erreichen. Die beiden Entwickler betonen, dass sie absichtlich eine grafische Umgebung wie zu Zeiten der P1 schaffen wollten, was mir persönlich wenig sagt, aber manche Kritiker haben es gelobt. Auch wenn es bedeuten mag, dass es älter aussehen soll, so passt die Optik durchaus in die Neuzeit.

Leider funktioniert kein Steam-Overlay, ich hätte euch gerne ein Bildschirmfoto angeboten, um einen ersten Eindruck zu vermitteln.

Fazit: Ein günstiges Spiel, das einem Gruselfreund gut gefallen kann, obwohl es kein Gemetzel gibt. Es ist wieder eines der Spiele, das eher eine Erkundungsmission als ein echtes Horrorspiel ist. Mir jedenfalls haben die knapp 2 Stunden gut gefallen, ich bin gespannt auf Teil 2.",1625424937,1657923082,True,9,1,0.636982917785644531,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The atmosphere is nicely done, and all the different camera angles add a lot to the tension, especially the drone's POV camera.

Es gefiel uns beiden nicht wirklich.

 Zuerst ohne Spoiler:
Die Idee und die Umsetzung des Spieles (mit dem kleinen Roboter) ist ganz gut und auf jeden Fall mal etwas neues, jedoch ergibt es nicht wirklich Sinn, warum überall Kameras und Türmechanismen installiert werden, wenn nun doch ein Roboter reingeschickt wird (nichts gegen den Robo, der ist irgendwie niedlich). Also Idee ist gut, Umsetzung eher so.. meeh.
Die Steuerung war gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber auf jeden Fall machbar und okay.
Ich fand es oft nicht ersichtlich, was ich jetzt tun musste und bin oft random rumgefahren, um mit der Kamera einfach alles zu fotografieren, es also zu suchen.
Ich fand den Mechanismus mit dem Updaten des Robos ganz nett, da dann noch mehr zu sehen war.

Nun mit Spoilern:
[spoiler] Es war zu repetitiv. Ich bin rein in den Raum, habe alles angesehen, habe die Notiz fotografiert (wieso waren die teilweise neu da, wieso hat das Installationsteam das nicht gesehen?), jede Tür ging zu, sobald ich in der Nähe war, das Licht ging aus, irgendwas ist passiert und ich musst es fotografieren und oft war es nicht ersichtlich, was zu fotografieren war. dann hab ich das hochgeladen, der Typ glaube mir nicht (""how do you keep getting these bugs, rookie?""), diese komische Lichtkugel kommt, macht alles aus, ich muss zum Gen und dann neuer Raum usw. Nach zwei Malen wusste man es.
Dann war es teilweise schwer zu fotografieren, weil die Kamera so lange lädt und bis dahin ist das schon wieder weg. 
Der Fotobug war auch nervig, besonders, weil ich mir beim letzten Kameraupdate nicht mehr sicher war, ob das jetzt so gehört oder um es der Bug ist. Ich hatte keine Lust, es wie PinkiiChan dauernd wieder zu öffnen, also hab ich einfach weiter gespielt und gehofft. 
[spoiler]


Ich fand es in der Gesamtheit eher sehr nervig also gruselig und habe mich nur ein Paar Mal erschreckt (und ich erschrecke mich sonst [b] immer [b]. Ich habe das Spiel zurück gegeben. Zwei Euro sind zwar nicht viel, aber da das letzte Update schon über drei Jahre her ist, denke ich nicht, dass noch aktiv daran entwickelt wird und möchte diese lieber in ein anderes Spiel investieren.

Kurz gesagt; Wir beide mochten es nicht.

Die Idee hinter dem Spiel hat wirklich was interessantes, allerdings finde ich die Story wirklich Willkürlich. Warum sollte man erst Kameras und Türmechanismen installieren um dann nochmal eine Drone rein zu schicken? Das ergab für mich irgendwie wenig Sinn. Dann hätten die auch gleich ihre Fotos machen können.

Die Steuerung war etwas komisch am Anfang, aber man hat sich daran gewöhnt. 
Was mich am meisten an dem Spiel gestört hat, war dieser blöde Fotobug. Ich musste im Verlauf des Spieles gleich zwei mal neu starten damit die Kamera nicht nur weiße/grüne/blaue Fotos macht. Das hat echt total genervt, zumal das Spiel keine Speicherstände unterstützt, sondern man nur zwischen den vier einzelnen Kapiteln auswählen konnte. Letztlich kam der Bug einfach immer wieder, also hab ich es einfach so zu ende gespielt.

You play as a little robot, and you are supposed to take photos for an investigation of some strange activity at some cabin. You take orders from your boss, Barry. Funny, he actually looks like Barry from Resident Evil.

“I’m usually the master of unlocking.” Yeah, that's actually what he says.

So, in order for some things to happen, you have to take pictures of certain things, and some images you have to send to Barry. Because otherwise, he’ll be all like, “What am I looking at here?”

You have to photograph notes in order to read them. It turns out that the last owner of this house has been experiencing some spooky scary stuff. You have to send Barry photos of supernatural stuff, but he keeps dismissing them as some sort of bug in the camera, and keeps making new updates to the camera.

The doors and lights must be controlled remotely, since Barry is opening some doors for me, and yet, he doesn’t seem to be physically here with me. I don’t really see the point of making the first-person view use up battery. Seems unnecessary to me. You don’t often need to use the first person view, but if you are stuck in an area, it’s a good idea to look around from the robot’s point of view.

This game is rather short, but I think it’s pretty good. It has some good scares, and moments where you need to remember the layout of the house in order to find stuff. So I recommend people give this game a try, it’s only $2 if you live in Canada.

这个游戏最大的创意点就在于我们在游戏流程中大部分时间控制的不是人类而是一台小机器人在探索鬼屋，游戏的主要玩法就是用机器人上携带的相机寻找并拍摄到屋子里出现的各种灵异现象，再上传给老板获得进一步指示并继续收集线索（操纵机器人时为固定视角可能会让有些玩家感到不习惯，这时可以按住鼠标左键使用机器人的主视角相机，但要注意这会加速消耗机器人的电池电量）。

随着游戏进程的推进，我们还能从主角老板那里得到升级程序为小机器人升级系统，获取更多的功能：像是开始时机器人只能拍摄黑白又很模糊的相片，到后面可以拍摄彩色高清相片，再到后面具备夜视甚至是灵视功能。探索鬼屋都能使上高科技了，想想看真是蛮有想法的；机器人胖墩墩的外表看起来也蛮好玩，这让进行游戏时的恐怖感又少了一分。

尽管不是人类，机器人最后还是会在幽灵的干扰下损坏而失去联系，我们的主角也只得在老板的要求[spoiler]威逼[/spoiler]下只身前往凶宅回收机器人。换成人类身份又切换成第一人称视角让代入感和恐怖感一下提升了不少，几个高能点也集中在这一部分。至于主角的结局如何，回想一下看过的恐怖片中那些主动作死的人最后都怎么样了，你们懂的。

撇开这个创意点不谈，就游戏本身的素质而言其实它并不怎么出彩，画面有些粗糙，操作感不佳，流程也太短。但制作者细心布置的屋内环境和光影效果确实很好地营造出凶宅里阴森的气氛了，画面虽然不精细但也不至于让人看着难受，剧情设计上虽然平庸但认真做了设定（从为情节编写的一系列笔记和官方报告中能看出来），不长的流程中也存在几处能“震”到玩家的恐怖点。这样对于一款价格低廉（打折几块钱）的3D恐怖游戏而言其实就已经足够了。

游戏四个成就前三个都很容易获得，最后一个9分30秒通关的成就可能有点难度。正常整个流程大约1.5到2小时左右，大家可以参考我写的这篇攻略指南进行游戏。

游戏主要是控制一个摄影机器人去鬼宅里探险寻找鬼的踪迹。这样看来，由于主角不是一个人，玩家代入感不会很强烈，所以不会感时时刻刻提心吊胆，心脏轻松许多——我心里的想法是反正主角是个机器人，被鬼弄坏了也无关紧要对吧。而且前期高能对比末尾主角换成人后也少很多，基本就是解谜。再加上末尾主角换成人了，玩家带入感就会强烈许多，恐怖体验就会增强——我为这位明显要去领便当的主角捏了一把汗，他的老板要他去取机器人拍的鬼照片拿去卖钱，还对他说照片比你的狗民值钱。。。。。
游戏最大的亮点还是蠢萌的胖墩机器人。虽然有玩家说操控吃屎，但游戏其实结合鼠标左键和space bar可以长期保持机器人第一视角观察前进，这样操控就简单得多了。而且机器人还在升级，摄影机从低清转化为高清无码，照相机从黑白照转化为彩照再到夜视仪照片，这种递进的游戏体验，就是rpg里的等级装备诱人的地方。
最后我想说，现在科技这么牛逼，探索灵异事件都不用面临危险直接用机器人，可是我想说，那也得看什么鬼！对于伽椰子这样只要招惹她就会追你到天涯海角取你性命的强大怨鬼，以及富江这种泛滥成灾的诅咒，面对她们，只剩下无解的绝望。",1478678257,1478678257,True,8,0,0.618317306041717529,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It also didn't hurt that the game is just under $2, even cheaper if you're buying it on sale. I of course read some of the negative reviews before buying, and they, including some of the positive reviews, brought up very good points. I was worried, being the controller of a drone and somewhat removed from the ""threat"" of the unknown, that the game wouldn't come off as scary. But I'm also a bit of a chicken, so things worked out fine. I was genuinely worried about the drone, and caught on fairly quickly that bright, sparkly orb coming towards you meant a power failure was coming. But a majority of the time I was caught off guard by it, causing me to panic a bit to turn it back on. As I was worried my drone would be destroyed and the game would be over early. Because in my experience, when the lights go off, ghosts or whatever tend to get super violent. So of course I was driving my drone as fast as I could out of that house.

[h1][u][b]Specifics[/b][/u][/h1]

[u]Pros[/u]
[*] The story was okay, though I'm just confused why [spoiler]the home owner didn't cut his loses when he believed the house to be haunted.[/spoiler]
[*]The atmosphere was there, and I hesitated quite a bit when deciding to go in rooms.
[*]The soundtrack fits the game
[*]Maybe the game has been updated a bit, but I haven't ran into any bugs.
[*]Has a few achievements and cards, with one of the achievements requiring you to beat the game under a certain amount of time.

[u]Meh[/u]
[*]Has the ability to configure the game to some degree after pressing play.
[*]Controlling the direction the drone moved in mixed with it's camera was a bit frustrating.
[*]Taking a picture takes a while, but understandable given the game's short nature.
[*]Graphics? I set mine to good, so I wasn't expecting anything amazing. Nor did I expect the outside to look as good as, or better, than the inside of the building. But the rocks and ground were pretty ugly.
[*]All you do is take pictures of notes and ghosts, while occasionally restarting the power to all the lights in the house.

[u]Cons[/u]
[*]Super short, probably one of the shortest games I've played so far. There are a total of 4 chapters, with the epilogue being added into the 4th chapter by default.
[*]Barely any saving - Because of it's short nature, you don't have the traditional save game option. The game supposedly saves your progress, but I'm unsure how it really works. All the chapters seem unlocked by default, and since I wasn't paying attention to the chapter I was on, I ended up accidentally skipping ahead in the story.
[*]Has no pause menu, and quitting for whatever reason quits the entire game, instead of taking you back to the main menu.

All in all, the game isn't that bad, and I did enjoy my play through. Not sure if I'll go after that last achievement, but I am keeping an eye out for their sequel. I don't regret my purchase, and despite finishing it in under 2 hours, I won't be returning it. Just wouldn't seem right.

The cheap price doesn't hurt either. There's not much more to say about it beyond the fact that you go around taking pictures of the strange happenings in this house. The interface is well done and fun to mess around with.

The game is short too, clocking in at jsut over an hour, but again, the budget price means you won't feel cheated.

Exactly as everyone says, it's a fun mixture of oldschool mechanics from the golden age of survival horror but updated with a clever conceit of being based around a home surveilance company, with the fixed camera angles being security cameras and your character, replete with the traditional tank-style controls, being a small remote controlled camera drone that obviously would control something like a tank. It's only about an hour long and the story, overall gameplay, and presentation are all good but nothing teribly special, but that actually adds to its charm. It's not trying to be earth shattering, it's just trying to be a nifty little ghost game with a few fresh ideas and a hefty dose of nostalgia. It made me jump a few times, it kept me interested throughout, it was paced perfectly, and it ended before it wore out its welcome.

This is the game equivalent of settling down at night after getting off of work, turning off the lights, and trying your luck at picking a random no-name, low budget, diret-to-DVD horror movie on Netflix, and being pleasantly surprised at how fun it actually is, and it ends up being a great way to finish off your night.

My only quibble: The notes that you find throughout the game that fill out the game's story were incredibly blurry on my screen, I had to sit back far in my seat and squint my eyes to read them. And the ""Officer's Report"" note from the main menu was too small and too blurry to read at all. I'm not sure what the problem was, I had it set to max resolution, and everything else looked fine.

The atmosphere of the game is chilling. Shutter is inspired by the old school Biohazard games, This can be seen in the use of fix camera angles and clunky controls. There is no combat system; in order to progress in the game the player must photograph certain objects and read e-mails that indicate the current objective. 

Indie horror titles are often immensely disappointing. Whilst Shutter is not among those types of games, Shutter is unfortunately unworthy of a recommendation. The game suffers from annoying bugs and glitches. After multiple playthroughs, the game consistly crashes. Before the game crashes there is a bug with the photographs that cause the image to distort. The distortion is most likely not a game mechanic. If the player pauses the game, there is a note from the developer in red that suggests to restart the chapter is this happens. Not only that, but at times the exit menu glitches and a blank menu opens.  All four achievements are glitched as well. Players may find themselves beating the game multiple times and noticing that the achievements do not unlock correctly. 

Whilst Shutter is a decent indie horror title, it cannot be recommended to anyone. Perhaps the sequel might be better and free of annoying bugs.

I'm not fond of ghost stories in general, as so many of them rely on jump scares so it was quite a relief to find that this one didn't.

The actual gameplay consists of piloting your little drone around and taking pictures, which require a bit of timing to get right.

We are constantly in contact with a software engineer, a guy who asks us where to go and what to take a photo of. The photos we then upload and await his further instructions. Occasionally he upgrades our software which basically means a camera with different modes for shooting (night vision, spectral vision). We take photos of objects, apparitions while experiencing some good-old survival horror scary stuff: suddenly closing doors, flickering lights, sudden blackouts and ghostly sounds / voices.

Regularly, we find notes telling us the story of the place and while it is not much it still contributes to the great atmosphere the game has.

The whole thing takes about 90 minutes to complete. There's diary entries to be found, and ghosts roaming the halls, etc. You know the drill.

There's nothing offensively bad about [i] Shutter. [/i] There's also nothing particularly remarkable about it. I'll give the developers credit for an original approach to a shopworn genre, and for eschewing the use of cheap jump scares. I didn't find it scary, mainly because piloting a remote-controlled robot removes any sense of personal threat from the experience. I also don't remember any blood, so squeamish types should be all right with it.

I could just as easily have given this game a thumbs-up, because it's competently made and well-priced. I'm only voting it down because I just can't picture myself actively recommending it to anyone; it's too, well, not-scary for that.

Introduction:
I asked for a refund. It's bug riddled as hell, in addition to some very legitimate complaints about the game itself. Reading some of the descriptions, and some of the more positive reviews, I figured I'd like this game. I'm a 90's kid, like most of you, so I grew up playing the clunky tank-control horror titles with cheesy dialogue, like Silent Hill or Resident Evil (both of which I'm a huge fan of). Other than controls (to an extent) do not expect anything like those titles out of this game. It's not the worst $1.50 (on sale) you'll spend, but it's still not worth the purchase.

Gameplay:
A huge, huge reason I give the gameplay such a low score is that taking pictures is a huge part of the game, and half the time the camera bugs out, so you can't see what you took a picture of, requiring a restart of the level. There's even a warning about this bug in-game! Spoilers, but a lot of the gameplay consists of roving around looking for shining objects to take pictures of, to recieve jumpscares. The handling on the little robot is pretty good, and the general concept is something I'd love to have seen from a competent or more experienced developer. However, the jump scares lose their draw after the first one. You'll spend a big chunk of the game wondering what the hell to take a picture of next, and it's usually a shiny dissapearing shovel (not kidding). I literally expected a skeleton to pop out and go ""boo"" most times. If you're not doing that, you're wondering why doors keep locking you in areas for over-used, and plain boring, set-pieces.  I (obviously) didn't finish the game.

Graphics:
Looks like something made with community assets in the Unity engine or something. The rover and the house you explore aren't that bad, but the ""ghosts"", props, UI, and other things are just plain bad. Nothing blends together, nothing is believable, nothing is scary. Try again.

Sound:
I couldn't tell if the sound bugged out a lot, or if the developer thought it was a good idea to have loud repeating annoying noises at random times in the game. Jumpscare? Expect the same sound to repeat 5-6 times as loud as possible. Ambience? Expect the same sound to repeat 5-6 times as loud as possible. Something changes somewhere else? (Rinse, repeat).

Story:
What story? You're apparantly investigating the security concerns of a clearly abandoned house that kids have been spraying with graffiti (nevermind the fact that the roof/windows are busted). Someone had time to install security cameras all over the place, along with a recharging/calibration station for your UGV, yet they couldn't just simply send in a dude with a camera, cell phone, and note pad to check security issues on a ran-down abandoned house? The scares, notes you find, and things your email partner says have nothing to do with eachother, and it's all very juvinille level writing all around.

In conclusion:
Do not buy this game, it's fucking terrible. The concept is nice (piloting a UGV to hunt for ghosts and such), but this team cannot produce, as is apparant. I wish I could say better for this game, but I cannot and will not reccomend anyone purchase it.",1455120049,1455120049,False,2,0,0.479746043682098389,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As the game description says, as you progress you upgrade your robot dude giving you a better camera to keep getting pictures of paranormal things like floating objects, shadows, and orbs. The more pictures of paranormal activities/shadows, the more you progress.

Controls are a little janky, but felt fairly appropriate considering you arent controlling a person. You can use your battery power to get into a first person view, but when the battery runs out, you need to let it recharge. Letting you switch between the RC camera and a 3rd person view was a very nice touch.

In my opinion, they absolutely nailed the atmosphere. I might spook pretty easily, but I know I sat there jumping, flinching, and squeaking like a little girl the entire time I played (and especially at the end).

Graphics are a little dated (as a nod to PS1 era I guess), but the audio is very well done. Would have loved for an audio setting though. Im also very happy the dev didnt 100% rely on cheap jump scares. Also absolutely loved the story. Make sure you actually read the papers you find, as well as the police report in the menu (after you finish the game of course).

Outside of the bug mentioned in the description, I didnt find any major bugs. My mouse didnt lock in the window on windowed mode, but Im not sure if it was intended to be locked in or not. It wasnt game breaking for me though.

The only downside to the game is the length. The game is pretty short. Theres actually an achievement to finish in under 10 minutes I believe. So, expect to spend 30 minutes up to an hour on your first (blind) playthrough. I do wish the dev's had added some more meat to the story and expanded the house. It would have been cool to have more rooms to explore for more story pages. 

All of that said, I very highly recommend the game. The story was creepy and the RC robot thing was a pretty cool/interesting concept. I definitely look forward to their next release.",1453294727,1453334919,True,14,0,0.624501526355743408,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It even has a few sneaky little references to classic RE games thrown in for fans.

You play the role of a little RC drone and you drive it around through a fixed-camera environment similar to the old Resident Evil games with similar tank controls. It's an interesting game mechanic having a game of this style where you can't actually directly interact with the environment, all you can really do is observe, take pictures, and communicate with your off-site HQ, and you have to solve the mystery through these methods.

The graphics are pretty primitive for a newer game, though still competent enough, and doesn't quite give the sense of immersion as better visuals would, but it works well enough. It's also very short, as are a good majority of games of this type. The biggest issue I had was getting used to the controls. The game starts you off in a very confusing place and doesn't do terribly well at communicating what you're supposed to do from the start, so it takes a little orientation to get into it because of this. Definitely worth a few dollars to check out if you like classic 90s horror games.",1444854606,1444854606,True,5,0,0.501232266426086426,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That excitement turned to frustration very quickly once I started playing. I found the battery system so unrealistic it was outrageous. You should be able to look around for longer than 2 seconds at a time, especially since that's the only way to actually find what you need to take a picture of. And having to run back to the generator in the dark when it's extremely hard to see with the lights on just to turn the generator back on is stupid, pointless, and maddening. If the guy talking to you from the security company can open doors he should be able to turn the generator on for you!

I kept having trouble with controlling the drone. At times it would only move sideways when I pushed forward or it would refuse to go through opened doors. Sometimes backing up and trying again worked but sometimes I had to restart the level to gain control. This was especially maddening when I was close to the end of a level since you always start back at the beginning.

I did not find this game scary at all. If I wasn't so frustrated or if I had actually been able to see the ghosts & shadows it may have been at least a little creepy. Flashes that last less than a second aren't scary! If those were ghosts then let us see them so we know they are ghosts. You can let then disappear or fade away after we get a good look. As-is they flash so quickly we don't know for sure what they are and just as quickly forget them. The shadows would be pretty spooky if we could see them better, but a shadow in a very poorly lit place is easily overlooked or dismissed as regular shadows.

The fish-eye lens was a dumb idea and almost made me quit playing before it was removed. It's hard enough to see in this game without giving us a headache too. Very bad idea!

The concept of this game is awesome, and if the things above were fixed I would highly recommend it. Those problems make the game no fun to play, and if I don't enjoy the game at least a little then I can't recommend it to others.

I can even look past lower graphical standards, because sometimes that even enhances a horror game, but in this case it really isn't a horror game.

You're moving around in the house at night, with a little robot, equiped with another camera, trying  to catch the culprit red handed. So basically, the game goes for a ""found"" footage idea, which could be really nice, with a proper budget, art direction and game design skills. 
The game looks bad. Not in a charming ""Baby-Sitter Bloodbath"" or ""Power Drill Massacre"" / PlayStation 1 era kind of way. Just in a poor Unity kind of way. Low texture, not even stylised, decent lighting projection but terrible use of it, generic environment...nothing that can stick to your brain. The sound-design is the same. Though the game tries to use it correctly (I'd say it's ""ok"" for the mood it's trying to create) it's just annoying when it tries to actually scare you with some random loud noise of a guy mumbling. 

But that is actually not the real problem. The problem is, the narration and the pacing suck. First of all, why should I be scared for a robot? I don't really know who is driving this thing, where is that character supposed to be, and why is he/she not with the rest of the crew (that seem to be coding software in only few minutes to update the damn thing). Secondly, the notes don't need to be there. If you actually create an environment, and put so much effort into putting the player in a position where he can take pictures, move around, just use the environment. Do not use notes. Notes are good for human beings actually opening drawers, desks etc. The notes come out of nowhere and the story flows mainly if not only through these...I won't even talk about the actual story, which is average or below average. i've seen worst in the amateur creepy pasta realm, and I've seen better too.

Overall, I'm sorry to say, but it feels far to amateurish to be sold. It's a nice idea, sure. I like the concept of making fixed camera angles diegetic. But it's use with such a mediocre ghost story, bad graphics, poor level design and overall lack of skills, that it feels like I've been robbed.

Had the game been free, ""of course"" just try it. But even for a this small amount of money, don't bother.

-the drone idea is quite original and works well

-a pretty good story rounded up by the report that'd be read after completing the game

-overall unremarkable graphics: before you get the HD camera upgrade first person view is so badly pixelated that I thought it was a bug

-controlling a drone makes the things you'll face less threatening since you're not in harm's way: this changes in the last chapter when you're actually controlling a person though

At the time I defended The Chinese Room in this decision, and while I still agree with the general reduction in The Dark Descent's many unnecessary mechanics (including superfluous sanity systems and borderline-inconsequential ""healing"" items), the extraordinary suspense created by Outlast and its battery-conserving antics made me rethink my stance in regard to such issues.  Having said that, Shutter takes such matters to new extremes of extraneousness, by arming the miniature ""droid"" you control with a battery which not only controls your ability to switch to first-person mode, but requires constant recharging whilst adding precisely FUCK-ALL suspense to the matters at hand.  Indeed, I am wondering if the only reason for this mechanic to exist are:  a. To shut up the kinds of people who complain incessantly about lack of ""gameplay mechanics"" in recent horror games, and b. To pad out the length of an already very SHORT game.   

   Here's another theory.  After coming up with an admittedly VERY clever and VERY original concept for their little-horror-game-which-could - one in which the player commanders a Mars mission-style robot in its explorations of a haunted house, and the unravelling of the mysteries therein - the developers of Shutter then faced the difficult decision of whether to make it a first-person or third-person game.  The smart money would probably have been on first-person, but their love for early Resident Evil-style camera angles apparently won out to the degree where the player can now readily switch between first and third-person.  In its own right, not a bad idea at all, but then that dreaded need for ""mechanics"" reared its ugly head.  After all, what fledgling development company wants to become the new Chinese Room, and be ""hated"" by all and sundry (except ME, of course?  Hell, I even liked Gone Home).  

   (On a side-note, I'd also like to thank all the fuckers who whined about A Machine For Pigs for the current plethora of horror games in which the protagonist can't run for more than seven seconds without stopping to catch his breath.  All of these unnecessarily overdone ""mechanics"" are thanks to YOU, ya whining pack o' CUNTS.)
 
   Anyway, back to Shutter.  Oh, and if you need further evidence of the aforementioned Resident Evil obsession, you need look no further than the fact that your ""boss"" looks like Barry Burton and makes a joke about being a ""master of unlocking"".  'Nuff said.  So what of the game's GOOD qualities?  It's certainly not lacking in atmosphere or spookiness, but the genuinely ""scary"" factor is a little hampered by the fact that, at least until the final chapter, you're just a little electronic thing on wheels which can't really get hurt or be emotionally traumatised.  It's an inspired idea just the same, and the ""story"" you uncover is interesting enough (if told in the slightly ludicrous manner of finding pieces of a ""diary"" plastered on walls here, there and everywhere), but its a little difficult to recommend to all bar the horror-faithful at the price of five bucks for barely over an hour's worth of gameplay.  By all means, pick it up in a sale, and I'll certainly be eager to see what the devs get up to next, as this shows an awful lot of promise.  But less of the gratuitous mechanics next time, eh, Cosmic Logic?  You guys were brave enough to try something genuinely different for your first foray into game design, and if there's one thing horror games are in dire need of right now, it's a bit more risk-taking.  Let's all stop quaking in the shadow of The Chinese Room's ""epic fail"" (minor masterpiece, if you want MY fucking opinion), and keep things moving forward, whad'ya say?   Definitely a very solid, if flawed, first effort.

Wasn't really too sure what to make of it when I saw the the trailer and screenshots, but I took a chance and I feel satisfied. 

The atmosphere was good. Not quite as haunting as I was looking for, but it was definitely in the right place. 

There were moments where the flashlight does not work, but it clearly shows it being on. Not sure if that's a bug, or intentional but it when I see the light on and not lighting anything up, I got confused. Another issue was when going down hallways, the flashlight seemed to do very little at all if you point it forward in the fixed camera perspecting. It would have been nice to see just a tad bit more, instead of relying on the first person view for things that shouldn't require it, in context. 

Pacing was fine, can't critique the writing. Not my thing.

I really really liked the consistent upgrades to the camera and such. The fish eye lens at first was not terrible, but I do recall not being overly fond of it. Thankfully it's just a pre-upgrade situation and for that, I think it added a bit more flavor to the situation.

With notes, they tend to have this almost blinding light on them. This came in handy during one section in particular where I really had trouble finding it, but I feel the sort of bubble effect that was used early on in the game would be a better indicator rather than the blinding light. Just a personal opinion.

When entering rooms, the thing you're supposed to look at or photograph seems to only spawn when you've gone in, and then try to leave so that the door closes and locks you in. Since there's no point in leaving anyway, it would be better to have the door instantly close as soon as you enter. 

The 4 chapters felt solid, I liked the ""puzzle"" with the portraits, and the epilogue chapter was nicely done. 

For the price and what you get for it, I say Shutter is a worthwhile game. I feel it captures what it set out to and while I would have loved to play with it longer, it was a good experience.",1430689365,1430689365,True,5,0,0.477420061826705933,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That isn't true. Shutter, for what it is, is a nice little experience that'll make you ask yourself why didn't someone think of this sooner. It's a nice idea. Unique with a story that makes you go, ""*inhale* OHHHHH.""

But Shutter isn't reinventing the horror wheel. It's your run-of-the-mill horror game. You might be startled, you might not be. Your mileage may vary with the jump scares (not many) and you might get the intended creep factor out of the general reveal of the diary pages heroine's fate. Personally, I cringed, I jumped, and I did as intended. My worst reactions came out of the epilogue chapter where I truely felt like clawing the walls in a panic. You will feel panic. You will either panic because that beautiful, expensive equipment or... I'm not spoiling you!

Shutter, however, is short. The price reflects the ""you'll clock in about an hour IF THAT"" game time. Shutter also has some woeful graphics that even I crossed my eyes at and wanted to scream ""WHY?! WHY OH GOD WHY?!""

I say to hell with that it's not pretty and if you're that hard up for cash, wait for a sale. But it's a nice way to waste a quick hour if you like a quick horror game. If you liked Paranormal, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of Shutter. This storyline is a little bit more believable but the scares are dialed down. Play both games for a fun night of video camera footage horror.

There's no huge learning curve. The camera takes a moment to fire up and I'd prefer rapid fire shots, but that would make it too simple to take a ghost's picture, now wouldn't it? As you move along in the game, you get ""upgrades"" to your equipment to take better pictures of ""camera issues"" and such that may hinder your investigation. Personally, I enjoyed that. You can also go into first person mode. This is complete rubbish when you're first using it but you'll be counting on this later on to help you flee. Yes. You will be chased. Your drone will need you so it doesn't get boogled by ghosties. A love story between man and drone. Except man uses drone to capture footage of ghosts so I have to ask what sort of relationship this is.

The one thing I would have enjoyed was a little warning that there was flashing lights used (not like you're obligated to, but this is why I make myself the health guinea pig!). Yes I should have guessed when I noticed there was thunder and lightning in the videos, but I subject myself to this so that other gamers don't have to go ""HOW BRIGHT ARE THE FLASHES, REALLY?"" Enough to put you into a migraine or a seizure easily. There are lots of bright lights. Tread with caution if you are a gamer with a handicap that may be set off by flashing lights. Take breaks between chapters. I know the final chapters are about ten minutes long, but TAKE A WALK. Give your eyeballs a rest.

If you don't care for horror and want a little taste of something unusual, I say give Shutter a shot. If you're a diehard horror fan and you only like extreme experiences, skip it. This is a bit tame for your tastes. If you like collecting horror games because they're pretty fun to compare differences, then you needed to get this game YESTERDAY. Why didn't you get it yet?

I personally enjoyed it. I wish it could have been longer and a little bit more polished, but I can comfortably say it's not something you'll regret in the morning. Like that ghost lady. I'm pretty sure she doesn't regret anything, either. She was pretty happy to suck the battery life from my drone.",1429066779,1429066779,True,43,13,0.754739761352539063,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Shutter has a very decent central concept and the beginnings of a classic ghost tale running through it but it is hindered by being an hour long, uglier than a squashed frog and possessing no good reason at all for having fixed cameras as a primary view. The gameplay is pedantically dull, mainly consisting of you rolling around taking pictures of floating objects and uploading them to your technical support, Barry, who constantly accuses your photos of being clever fakes or software glitches. 
There are a couple of nice ideas here and, if you're a horror fan, I found it worth the playthrough for the surprisingly competent epilogue chapter but wait until the price crashes down. You can check out the fun I had with it below.

But suprisingly I really enjoyed it.

I would describe this game as a puzzle horror game. You control a robot that is equipped with a camera. The robot has access to a computer that you use to receive orders from the person that sent you in there. The orders generally relate to power problems in the house that you are exploring and you are told to investigate these. However as you progress through the game you realize that there is a ghostly presence in the house haunting it. 

This is when what I like to call the puzzle mechanic comes into play. The ghost will leave small clues around a room such as a floating plate. You need to take pictures of these items to trigger the puzzle. After taking the picture a new ""clue(?)"" will be revealed which you need to discover by taking pictures. It is kinda detective style investigations. This is what I really enjoyed throughout the game. Sometimes it can take a while to find these clues but that just adds to the investigative fun.

The game does also feature a story. This is told by notes found around the area. It tells the story of the women who used to live in the house. In my opinion this is the weakest aspect of the game. The story is very cliched and is frankly not told very well. I noticed a fair amount of grammar mistakes in the story as well. Although I believe you can just leave the story and the rest of the game will be enjoyable. The story of your robot and investigation is also told via the person giving orders on the computer. This is also not very well told in my opinion but can't be skipped because the gameplay revolves around it. 

Shutter features a very unique control system. It is meant to represent old school horror games. You see the robot through fixed camera angles. This means the robot is very hard to control initially. You use classic WASD and mouse to control it but due to the fixed camera angles it can get very confusing with what direction you are travelling in. This takes a long time to get used to but I believe that after you get used to it the unique control is what is another main strength of the game. If you don't like this control scheme you also have the option to view in first person mode. However this is on a timer and needs to be recharged frequently so can't be used constantly. 

Now the horror aspect of the game is done fairly well. There were many points in the game where it made be jump through typical game jump scares. They were very well done and the majority of the time I wasn't expecting it. The voice acting on the ghost and atmospheric music is also very effective.

Theres also a few other smaller points that I feel I should mention-
[list]
[*]The graphics aren't very impressive but I feel the particle effects are very well done.
[*]I had a bug where at one point in the game all images where showing as a broken texture. Although this is aparently going to be fixed upon full release of the game.
[*]There is no in game options menu but only an out of game one present. And it has no audio settings at all.
[*]The game only took me just over an hour to complete so it is fairly short.
[/list]

Overall I really enjoyed playing this game and I would definitely recommend it to people that enjoy horror and puzzle games.

However, it still has a very tense atmosphere about it, and there are a few moments where you are truly scared. This game took a huge risk by making the player control a robot instead of another human being. By doing this, it takes away the fear that something can hurt you, since you're just a robot. This is perfectly shown in this game towards the end, when you play as a human for a little bit, and it becomes terrifying just entering the house. The game design is very innovative, and I enjoyed being able to control the robot from both a 1st and a 3rd person perspective. This game took a risk by making the player a non traditional character, and creating a non-traditional horror game, and I really wish that other horror games would also be willing to take risks instead of sticking to the same repetitive horror style. I loved the game, and would recommend it to anyone who dabbles in horror. I uploaded the first 2 chapter below, and am finishing the other 2 as you're reading this, if you want to watch!

It was developed by a two person team and the graphics aren't that much to brag about which is probably going to get this game a lot of thumbs down. The low price is fairly realistic for what you get with Shutter. 

However, I had to give it a thumbs up as I did get genuinely scared a few times and that makes this a successful horror game in my opinion.  The final moments of the game were pretty awesome; I really wish a majority of the game had more of what the ending offered and less of the exploratory robot portion. I did encounter a late game bug with the camera that was resolved with a quick restart. Still, all in all I found a bit of fun to be had with Shutter.

Shutter takes place in a seemingly abandoned property, where break inns are very common place.

For this reason the owner of the house has need for the players services, which are remote CCTV's and a little mobile Mars rover.

https://youtu.be/LGgNE-od4JA

The mars rover is the games biggest part and controlling it and it's primary tasks, surveillance and picture taking is mostly okay and fun.

But then the so called horror element shows it's head.
The abandoned property is of course haunted by the spirits of the dead and for some reason they decide to try and scare the poor little mars rover.
Who of course is made out of circuits and metal.

And that is my biggest gripe with the game. Usually in horror games we control someone or even something that we can relate to and empathize with.
A person or an animal even, has the possibility of feeling fear and dread.
I myself can't find the emotional connection to the mars rover, that is needed for me to feel the fear it might be experiencing.
The player's character isn't in any danger. You just happily control the rover probably a hundred or more miles away from it. If you ""die"" its the rover that dies. It's replaceable and so it's possible battery drainage or death hasn't the same impact as a death in other horror games.

I do love the idea though with the camera surveillance and the rover itself but it would have needed some more refinement.
I can guess that it draws some inspiration from Fatal frame and Five nights at Freddy's, but in both of those series the player is in some sort of danger.

Now imagine this. You have the opportunity to go to Mars. First person to land there.
Amazing right?
Or you can send another rover there and take more pictures and soil samples which is important work of course.
I don't want to diss the rovers.
But I can guess which sounds more appealing to a lot of people.

Its an okay game, but for the horror I can't recommend it.
Maybe you'll manage to get a connection to the rover and proof me a heartless bastard.
