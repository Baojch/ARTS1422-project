I didn't know how glorious the next couple hours would be!

Deeply atmospheric, and a desperate stealth challenge (at least the first time you play it). I recommend against reading any strategy guides, just sit back and enjoy the natural arc of the game.

You'll hide amid the post-apocalyptic ruins of the English countryside, hunted by a variety of mechanical nightmares wielding blunderbusses and quipping in robotic posh accents.

You can definitely replay this game a couple times and still have a good time - but once you have figured out how all the different hunters behave, it becomes pretty easy. 

The multiplayer mode was fun playing with friends. I joined a random server one time and the settings the host was running were so extreme, and the PvP was so toxic, that I have no desire to try again.",1710811221,1710811221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Well, it's still being sold, it's being included in sales, and perhaps people want to still buy it. Also it's worth writing when the game is good.

I've been thinking about [i]Sir, You Are Being Hunted[/i] on-and-off for a decade. My history with the game started in the year of its release, 2013. The then newish Macbook Pro I had wasn't up to the task of running the game properly, so I had to give up and let the game wait until I was in possession of some actual game playing hardware. Even though short, the time I spent with [i]Sir[/i] back then proved me that the game in its sneakiness wanted to convey something similar to my then and present favourite [i]Thief[/i]. But [i]Thief[/i] it is not.

Looking at the game now with a decade worth of playing, thinking about, and making games I can more clearly see that [i]Sir[/i] aims to be first and foremost about survival. Sneaking just happens to be something you need to do in order to succeed in surviving. It's also a game about its environment. The sense of place the game gives the player is strong, with definite love and interest to such real world places from the developers shining through.

As good as it generally is, some aspects of the game feel a bit off. Why for example give the player the opportunity to loot useless junk and even eat some of it, if the consequences are always just going to be bad? I get it in an aesthetics sense, in reality the world would be filled with junk and spoiled food and it's fun for the player to fail in finding something useful, but this leaves me thinking that more could've been done with these items.

Saving being possible only in certain places is good as it emphasizes the aspects of survival. The player has to take risks and when they pay off its well worth it. But it can get frustrating trying to sneak through an island for the fifth time after being helplessly murdered by the crack shot enemies. After gaining weapons and ammo battling the robots became more of a viable tactic of survival and I started to hope for silent ways of taking the enemies down. Something like this might take the game into a wrong direction tho.

Enemy spawns are randomized each time the player loads a save, disincentivizing planning. Killing the enemies feels a bit redundant too, as they will spawn back in, latest when you have to load. As the game progresses the enemies will start to patrol in higher numbers, making the sneaky retrieval of the game's MacGuffin pieces harder. About half-way in I had enough and lost all desire to finish the game. Perhaps I'll return to the archipelago one day or perhaps I'm finally done thinking about this game.

-

During the years after [i]Sir's[/i] release its mechanics of sneaking and survival horror have been both taken further and executed better by other developers. Sometimes in the same game, like Gloomwood! Compared to either older classics or newer indie games [i]Sir[/i] feels a bit rough. Nonetheless it has a charming style of its own, the world is well thought out and the vibes of the English countryside are so pleasant that sometimes I forgot that I actually was being hunted.

If you're a fan of sneaking around, the tender pressure of constantly finding food to eat, and blasting robots into pieces you will enjoy your time with [i]Sir, You Are Being Hunted[/i]. Just don't be afraid to call it quits when you've had your fill.",1710776981,1710776981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

You can loot various houses for food(you need to eat also in order to survive), traps, tools and if you are really lucky, you might find a gun, changing the ties of who is the hunter and who is being hunted.

2- Cuando consigues el mapa, a√∫n tienes que buscar los artefactos por tu cuenta (Siguiendo el humo, o a las luci√©rnagas voladoras que aparecen de noche). Lo cual hace que el proceso de encontrar estos artefactos sea muy tedioso y repetitivo
3- La manera que tiene el juego de decirte que las cosas se van a poner m√°s dificiles es: Spawnear m√°s y m√°s enemigos
4- Hay enemigos muy rotos y molestos, como los perros que alertan a los dem√°s, que en late-game se vuelven muy muy molestos porque, como dije en el punto ""3"", el juego spawnea muchos enemigos y entonces el factor sigilo b√°sicamente queda destruido, entonces te ver√°s siendo perseguido todo el tiempo y corriendo de un lado a otro.

The game's perfectly alright gameplay-wise, the humor is there, the atmosphere and aesthetic are very strong. And if you squint hard enough or choose to get really in-character, I suppose you might miss the game's most obvious flaw: you are, in fact, not being hunted.

Now, are you being searched for? Yes. It absolutely feels like the robots are traversing the land with hopes of stumbling upon you. But they do nothing more to catch you. No following tracks, no systematic area searching, no spreading out, no laying low to get the jump on you, no ambushes, no traps, nothing.

There's a quirky English upper class theme as you're hunted on procedurally generated islands by homicidal robots hunting people for sport.  Certainly a different spin on the genre.

Gameplay consists of inventory management, stealthing around a lot and using objects like alarm clocks and so on to generate noise and befuddle your hunters.  The goal is to collect a number of shards and put them into standing stones, one for each island, so you can escape.  And that's a problem, because having a goal directly defies the developers own insistence that this is a contentless ""sandbox"" game.  It's unclear why they chose to mislead gamers in their marketing, but in this case I think it's just a case of bungling.  This is not a sandbox game.  That's actually a good thing.

You can set your own resolution and there's some lightweight graphical tweaks, so this will work on modern PCs to some extent.  But, it is 10 years old and showing a lot of age already, the game assets weren't AAA tier when the game launched back in 2013 and they look worse now. 

The game features no proper level design or game/story flow/plot, as they opted to try to use samey repetitive procgen algorithms as a substitute for adding such content to the game, to avoid doing the important job of level/map design.  As a result, the game doesn't actually have any content worth mentioning, just endless, boring, repetitive, soulless algorithmically generated sameyness.  Developers must learn that procedural generation is not an acceptable substitute for content.

The game is quite buggy, despite all this time the developer had to fix bugs.  Within 5 minutes of starting my first round, I was stuck on terrain and had to terminate the game.  Developers really need to do their jobs properly and test their games before launching on Steam... and they certainly should fix known bugs like this if they intent to keep holding their hand out for your money for a 10 year old game.

Sir, You Are Being Hunted has the gamer gouging price of $20 USD, for which you could easily get any number of older AAA games.  That's right, this costs more than Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto 5.  That's a ludicrous price for a 10 year old game riddled with bugs, dated graphics, and zero real content because the developer throught procgen algorithms are a perfectly okay substitute for them doing their jobs.  This is also competing with over 9,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.  Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

The biggest downside is that sometimes the game is impossible to complete. Typically this only happens if you try a 'custom' level generation. The primary objective of the game is to collect pieces of a machine to escape the islands, however sometimes these pieces generate inside of a boulder/building other structure, and are completely unobtainable. This has only ever happened to me twice but is a serious downside and very frustrating if you've already made it close to the end.
That being said, I enjoy this game a lot. it's very replayable with quite a few approaches to finishing. You can hoard weapons and ammo while going on a robot slaughter, or try to stay completely invisible to attempt a passive stealth completion. Requires a lot of patients generally, so if you get frustrated easily or have severe ADD I really wouldn't recommend this game to you. If you like scavenging for items and playing a more ""guerrilla"" style combat, you will enjoy this quite a bit.
Overall I think this game is very underrated and gets a lot less attention than it deserves. Modding the game is possible, but requires some real technical skill, specifically C# programming. Not many mods exist and the ones that do only modify values for things like ""infinite ammo"" or similar. I'd love to see that change in the future, as I feel like this game has some serious potential if people could more easily add things into it.

Das Spiel AN SICH, die Grundidee finde ich klasse f√ºr ein Casual-Game, das man immer wieder mal aus der Schublade holen und zocken kann. Allerdings ist mir der Schwierigkeitsgrad zu hoch. Daf√ºr gibt es drei einfache Gr√ºnde:
1. Die Roboter laufen fast immer in Gruppen rum, wenn man sich nicht wirklich gut anstellt bei einer Konfrontation, ist man sehr schnell tot. Und das immer wieder.
2. Die Artefaktfragmente erscheinen wirklich SEHR SEHR SELTEN auf den einzelnen Inseln, also mir pers√∂nlich ist das deutlich zu lange, wie viel Zeit ich brauche um √ºberhaupt mal ein Teil davon zu finden.
3. Ich hab das Spiel gerade eben erst wieder mit dem Sheriff oder Officer oder wie er hei√üt gespielt, das hei√üt man besitzt von Anfang an eine sehr gute Schusswaffe mit der man √ºber Distanz die Feinde eigentlich gut wegmachen kann. Laut Spiel unterst√ºtzt dies den einfachsten Schwierigkeitsgrad. Trotzdem muss ich sagen, leider immer noch recht schwierig, zus√§tzlich ist die Munition ja auch beschr√§nkt.

Also ich werde nicht ganz gl√ºcklich mit dem Spiel, wenn auch die Grundidee hervorragend ist. Am Ende des Tages muss jeder f√ºr sich selbst entscheiden. F√ºr mich trotz allem einen Daumen nach unten.",1688808412,1688808412,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The game has been out (and in my library, unplayed) for around a decade now, and its age certainly shows.  It opens with a 'Made with Unity' logo (probably from back before such a thing was even considered silly) and has a somewhat stiff UI for moving items around.  I had an entire play session where my camera would get locked due-north at a flat angle every time I used melee or drank alcohol, which (to be brief) was a virtual death sentence and instant soft-lock.  It went away the next time I launched the game, and never happened again.

All that being said, this game was bonkers fun to pick up and run through even in 2023.  Very minimally-designed, with only a handful of item and enemy types that have virtually zero overlap.  Hell, they could even stand to throw in one or two more (extraordinarily ripe for a sequel, I'd say).  These few components combine to create a genuinely riveting stealth/survival environment that borders on feeling like a sandbox.  The expert design of its enemies and environments does a stunning job of putting you into the headspace of a frightened little prey animal scurrying through the underbrush, and the atmosphere is top-notch.

Big recommend, but with a warning:  this game is ice-cold, and has no innate sense of mercy or justice.  It will command your attention and demand your caution.  So listen, and understand.  It can't be bargained with.  It can't be reasoned with.  It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear.

The tone doesn't really make sense, the enemy AI is pretty bad, save points are placed half an hour of playtime away from one another to pad the game length, and it's not exactly a looker. It was a commendable effort on the developers part, but you could really do yourself a favor by skipping this one.",1679473082,1679473082,False,2,0,0.496503472328186035,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Bravo. Der Nervenkitzel der Jagd hat definitiv funktioniert. Nur leider waren wir der Gejagte.

In Erinnerung ist mir eine Rezension geblieben, in dem jemand das Spiel abgewertet und nicht empfohlen hat. Wenn ich mich richtig entsinne, ging der Vorwurf etwa: F√ºr 5 Stunden oder so ganz nett, aber was danach? Total langweilig...
Meine Antwort auf diese/n SchreiberIn w√§re: Was denn noch? 

Die Idee des Spiels ist toll. Ohne gro√üe Erkl√§rung werden wir in eine Welt geworfen. Eine Stimme erkl√§rt uns, dass wir nicht zur√ºckkehren k√∂nnen, weil der Mechanismus zerst√∂rt wurde. Ganz beil√§ufig werden wir mit den Worten entlassen: Ach ja, Sir/Madam, sie werden gejagt (auch das noch!)

Das ganze Spiel ist wie die (klischeehafte Vorstellung von Festlandeurop√§ern) F*chsjagd (das Wort wird ernsthaft zensiert...) von britischen Snobs. Das Problem ist nur: Die J√§ger sind Roboter, sie haben (nat√ºrlich) Schusswaffen und wir passen (neben dem √∂rtlichen Wildbret) in ihr Beuteschema. 
Noch gr√∂√üere Probleme (je nach Klassenwahl): Wir haben KEIN INVENTAR. Keine Waffen, nichts zur Verteidigung, gar n√ºscht. Besonders lustig ist das, wenn man irgendwo am Anfang nur eine Falle findet, den ersten Roboter m√ºhsam dorthin lockt, dieser zwar in Gefangenschaft nicht mehr schie√üt, aber 1. wir ihn weder mit unseren H√§nden noch sonstwas attackieren k√∂nnen und er 2. sich irgendwann wieder von selbst befreit. 

Trotzdem versteht man das Prinzip schnell: Wir m√ºssen H√§user looten (was in diesem Spiel nicht durch Betreten und Anklicken passiert, sondern mit einem Klick auf die T√ºr wird alles verf√ºgbare des Geb√§udes aufgelistet). Sobald wir unsere erste Axt finden, wird das Spiel bedeutend einfacher. Auch die erste Waffe wird gefeiert. Nur leider gilt: Munition ist absolute Mangelware und selbst von verschrotteten Robotern gibt es keinesfalls garantiert Nachschub. Manchmal finden wir auch nur eine zerst√∂rte, unbrauchbare Knarre und einen Sch√§del (?). Trotzdem ist es durch exzessives Looten (und Nahkampft√∂tungen mit der Axt) sehr gut m√∂glich, dass wir 60+ Revolverschuss pder 20+ Schrotflintenmunition zusammenraffen.
Neue Probleme: 1. Nichts in diesem Spiel ist stapelbar. 6 Schuss Revolver oder 2 Schuss Schrot sind 1 Inventarslot. Irgendwann m√ºssen wir uns also entscheiden: Schie√üen, Wegwerfen oder irgendwo zwischenlagern (aber das Zeug holt man eh nie wieder ab...). 
Noch mehr Probleme: Die zu sammelnden Questitems sind teils RIESIG und verbrauchen Inventarslots wie bl√∂d. Auf der Zentralinsel kann man nach jedem Fund noch schnell zur√ºck zum Steinkreis laufen, aber auf den 4 Inseln geht man schon am besten nach dem Motto vor: alle 3 suchen, finden, zur√ºck ins Boot und direkt ab in den Steinkreis. 

Halten wir also fest: Das Spielziel ist es, auf 5 Insel insgesamt 4x3 und 1x5 ""Teile"" zu finden. Diese verbrauchen manchmal wenig, manchmal super viel Platz im Inventar, bis wir sie am Steinkreis abgeben. Positiv: Rauchs√§ulen verraten ihre Position schon von Weitem. Negativ: Fast immer werden diese Stellen bewacht. Einfach hinlaufen und looten f√§llt also meistens weg, ist aber, mittels Ablenkung, m√∂glich. 

Daneben kommen nat√ºrlich die J√§ger ins Spiel. Die KI ist √ºberschaubar, reizt man sie aber zu stark, wird es gnadenlos. Gegen 1-3 kommt man, entsprechend bewaffnet, noch gut klar, solange man in Deckung geht und m√∂gliche Blutungen sofort behandelt, aber wenn erstmal 5+ auf dich zust√ºrmen, kannst du kaum mehr wegrennen. Das geht fast immer schief. Die einzige Hoffnung ist dann noch das Versteck in hohem Gras. 

√úberhaupt die Umgebung: Die Graphik ist von diesem Sandbox-Spiel eher d√ºrftig, aber 1. ist das Spiel ja schon fast 10 Jahre alt und 2. war es schon damals kein Hingucker. Trotzdem versteht man erstaunlich schnell, wie die ""Sichtbarkeitsanzeige"" funktioniert. Somit wird ""Sir"" beinahe zu einem Stealthspiel, wo es um das ""unsichtbar-Werden"" geht. 

Auch sorgt es f√ºr Abwechslung, das immer neue, ""h√§rtere"" Roboter-J√§ger mit der Zeit auftauchen und auch die ""Jagdgruppen"" gef√ºhlt gr√∂√üer werden. 

Ich h√§tte mir etwas mehr Munition f√ºr das ""Gewehr"" gew√ºnscht, denn davon habe ich genau ""1"" Patrone gefunden, aber vielleicht ist die Waffe auch zu stark. Daf√ºr ist der Revolver etwas schwach. Manchmal haben nicht mal 6 Kugeln auf die ""Standard-J√§ger"" gereicht"", da hab ich mich h√§ufig gefragt, warum ich jede einzelne Patrone mitschleppe, wo es eine solide Axt gegen 1-3er Gruppen doch auch tut. 

Fazit: Die Anspannung, selbst die Beute zu sein, packt dich, egal wie die Graphik aussieht. Der Tag- und Nachtwechsel sorgt f√ºr Atmosph√§re, denn nachts bist du zwar unsichtbarer, findest aber selbst kaum mehr die T√ºren von H√§usern und tags√ºber kannst du weiter sehen. Im Kopfkino, so schnell wie m√∂glich die Teile von jeder Insel zu finden, gleichzeitig aber stets genug Bandagen, frisches Essen und Munition zu haben, vermischen sich zu einem prickelnden Cocktail. Findet man neue Gegenst√§nde (Dynamit...), will man sie unbedingt ausprobieren, egal wie klug es erscheint so viel ""L√§rm"" zu machen. Am Anfang zahlt man auch gerne mal Lehrgeld mit dem ein oder anderen ""faulen"" Gegenstand. Hin und wieder bei√üt man ins Gras, √ºberrascht von einer Horde Roboter-J√§gern oder von deren Treffsicherheit/Schaden. Der ganz gro√üe ""Thrill"" l√§sst zwar rasch nach und man versucht routiniert die Aufgabe zu Ende zu bringen, aber die Zeit war auf jeden Fall gut angelegt. Um zu meinem Eingangsgedanken zur√ºckzukommen: Ja, nach den 5 Stunden, was macht man dann? Ich h√§tte keine Idee, noch mal (vielleicht mit neuer Klasse) einen neuen Run zu wagen, obwohl Level und Gegner wohl zuf√§llig sind bzw. eingestellt werden k√∂nnen. Aber wozu auch, das Spiel hat seinen Zweck erf√ºllt, es kann wunderbar zu den Akten gelegt werden.

It's a work of genius game design.

Remarkable game design in fact. How all the elements of game play coalesce into a terrifyingly tight piece of horror, full of tension and demanding of a thoughtful mind, is a wonder to behold.

Yes, there are bugs (I got stuck between a rock unable to move so had to reload at one point) and some of the interface elements are annoying (there seems to be no way of reducing the zoomed in view mouse sensitivity, for example). And, yes, it has terrible texture work and demands a surprising amount from a computer despite very basic meshes... 

...and yet poor static visuals alone do not stop this game from creating an atmosphere of such incredible immersion that at times it truly transcends to a work of beautiful loveliness, almost becoming like an oil painting. And all the while infused with such ""Englishness"" that I'd burst out laughing with how ridiculous the whole thing was. And yet the tension never falters, the sheer feeling of danger never drops, and the atmosphere never abates. 

Brilliant game. Brilliant design.

J'avoue qu'apr√®s mes 9h de jeux pour en faire le tour (sachant que j'ai du afk en laissant tourner le jeu une paire d'heures), je reste sur ma faim. 
Mais je laisse une note positive, parce que le concept et la r√©alisation sont vraiment excellents. 
Etre pi√©g√© sur un archipel british avec des robots chasseurs qui n'ont qu'un ordre, vous tuer, √ßa m'a vraiment plu. L'ambiance y est sombre, stressante parfois (surtout au d√©but quand on y connait rien). On loot pour avoir de quoi se nourrir, faire des diversions, avec un peu de chance on trouve des p√©toires pour riposter dans le but de r√©ussir √† r√©cup√©rer ses fragments de machine qui nous permettrait de quitter cet endroit. Et plus on a de ses fragments, plus le nombre de robots qui patrouille augmente.
Par contre, le jeu se targue d'avoir des cartes proc√©durales... C'est bien, mais comme on les survole, l'int√©r√™t y est limit√©. De plus, pour avoir test√© une deuxi√®me partie, je trouve qu'au final tout s'y ressemble, ce qui limitera la rejouabilit√©.
Si vraiment vous voulez l'acheter mais que vous n'√™tes pas s√ªr, attendez les soldes, il vaudra d√©j√† plus le coup. Et si vraiment vous voulez pimenter l'exp√©rience, recommencez une partie √† z√©ro √† chaque mort.

[b] The Aspect Of The Game [/b]
[i] You are a inventor that invents a portal that accidentally breaks on you and teleports you to a land where machines hunt you down. Can you find all the pieces of the teleporter to repair it and go home or is your fate with your head on a mantle in a robots hunting lodge the choice is yours. [/i]

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] You alone or with friends have to find pieces of your device and piece back together your teleportation beacon to be brought back to safety before getting killed by one of the many different robots that will be looking for you throughout multiple islands. Do remember you are being actively hunted though stealth is a recommended option you can go offensive and attack back if ya don't get swarmed by reinforcements. [/i]

Unfortunately, it's executed quite badly. While the robots are certainly very scary and their hunting AI seems great, the majority of the game is just: walk to a place, loot something (be it one of the fragments you need to win or just some supplies), walk around the robots or use something to distract them and then walk around them again. That really is it, there's no diversity in approach to sustain the game. The tension wears off and becomes boredom. What is needed is a variety of tools and gadgets to manipulate and avoid the increasingly dangerous robots; we can still be left low on supplies at all times and dramatically underpowered, it's just that the translation into moment-to-moment gameplay needs to be more than 'throw a bottle' and 'walk slowly through this field.' Again, the slow pace is something I often enjoy in games, but there needs to be more. 

Looking at reviews, it seems the game was essentially abandoned in Alpha and a 'full-release' label slapped onto the game. I think that shines through -- with more diversity of content, this game could have been incredible.

I, for one, couldn‚Äôt wait to see what enemies popped up next, from the Land Owner to The Rider, and you certainly walk away with a real sense of achievement upon completion, safe in the knowledge that your hard work paid off and that you adapted to the dangers that were presented to you and were successful due to your newly found skill.

I highly recommend this game and cannot wait for the reinvented edition to be released, so if you enjoy this, get it on your wish list! Well done, Big Robot!

Look at the forums and you'll see what I mean. I don't know how this has any positive reviews at all.

The bugs which stopped me in my 20 minutes of recent play were:

Unable to bring up the map, which is extremely important in a game like this.

Inventory mouseover quickly stopped working. This also matters a lot because while you find a lot of food the majority of it is poisonous and you can't necessarily recognize this from just the picture. The mouseover text tells you if it is edible.

As far as the gameplay goes you have a hunger mechanic which drops like a rock - I've never seen a hunger mechanic that harsh before. The robots were easy to avoid, so provided the game even works for you most of the game you're going to be fighting hunger and scrounging for food as opposed to actually getting hunted.

So, no. And as I understand it the dev is working hard on a sequel to this, which takes an extraordinary amount of nerve given the state they left this game in.",1642132526,1642133648,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The core objective is to find all the pieces of a teleporter and return them to your spawn point, all the while being stalked by robot hunters. The idea is here, but the lack of any real innovation is what keeps the game from being more than a few hours of fun. Sneaking is slow and mundane, looting isn't very rewarding whether from a killed hunter or a building, environments are mostly clusters of building or shrubs to hide behind, gunplay is deliberately inaccurate but once you collect enough ammo thats pretty much all you'll be doing is shooting to speed up the game. Enemy variety is slightly varied, but a clean sniper shot brings most of them down, and even if you want to conserve ammo, a bear trap with an axe and bottle to lead them into it is a very effective strategy.

Multiplayer, however, is another story. While the mechanics are mostly the same, the last person to put in a piece wins alone. This means when playing with your friends, there are temporary alliances, betrayal, and strategy to make sure you win.

In [i]Sir, You Are Being Hunted[/i], you are - supposedly - being hunted. You find yourself isolated on a randomly generated island, with little but your wits about you, and nary an objective but to survive. The issue is that there's not a whole lot to say about the game. 

[b]G A M E P L A Y[/b]
You sprint around the empty moorland until you see a hostile robot on the horizon, usually guarding some sort of derelict building, sneak past them to loot said building, then leave. This chain of events repeats itself over and over, and is pretty much half of the gameplay. Otherwise, you're intended to hunt down 'fragments' and bring them back to the standing stones which you spawn by at the beginning of the game. The storyline is vague, and doesn't really have any bearing on the events that occur, but the 'fragments', when assembled, allow you passage off of the island, and completion of the game. There's not much else to it.

[b]G R A P H I C S[/b]
Textures are blurry and the whole atmosphere (perhaps by design, in the spirit of Britain) is dreary. It's not great to look at. Inventory items look as though they're from a different game, perhaps even being representative of what the developers had intended the world to resemble.

[b]G R A P H I C S[/b]
The sound design doesn't leap out as being particularly exceptional in any regard.

Overall 'Sir, You Are Being Hunted' may have been a strong entry into the survival genre 8 years ago, but it just feels kind of weak today. There's a remaster on the horizon for 2022, so perhaps it's worth holding out for that. Some additional world-building could go a long way for the remaster, and I'm hoping that there are some sort of narrative elements and characters introduced into the world. The original just feels like a bare-bones survival game that leans too heavily on its quirky upper-crust English gentleman aesthetic.

Throwing objects for distraction is tricky at best because you have no idea how far you can throw it or where exactly it will land, which just complicates the whole process of distraction.  That bottle didn't land far enough away? OOPS guess your fucked now.
Traps are worthless because the robots move in very unpredictable ways.  Guns shouldn't be an option because this is a stealth game, not DOOM, but even then these robots are terminators and take damage unreliably.

The thing that pisses me off about this game is that there are little hints of brilliance in here.  I love the look of the game, the environments feel like real places and I love the atmosphere, especially the industrial zones.  Exploration is the best part of the game, the stealth is the worst.  I want to like this game, I want to LOVE it, but I can't.  It's raw, it's fucked, it's alpha and it sucks.  And now they're coming out with updates that fix everything BUT the gameplay?  Fuck you.  You cannot tell me that the developers actually played their own game because these problems are so frustrating they cannot go unnoticed.",1632416237,1632416237,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was maybe 14 at the time. I didn't really understand it and was terrible at it but I appreciated what it was trying to do. I thought the very middling reviews it got were unfair despite not having much experience with it.

After coming back to it a few days ago having seen the update and remaster announcement, I realised I was absolutely correct and I will never forgive the bastard from PC gamer who gave this absolute gem a 63/100.

The atmosphere in this game is masterful. Each of the island biomes is absolutely oozing with this very unique not-so-merry England aesthetic. Being born and raised in the middle of buttfuck nowhere in the west country myself, some of these environments feel eerily familiar to me. The rolling fields, desolate scrubland, thorny hedgerows and leafless pockets of forest are all very accurate yet grimdarkified reflections of the countryside that lays right outside my house. It almost feels like if you have not experienced life in a rural area of the UK, you will not fully understand exactly how good this game's environments and atmosphere is. Hell, I'm pretty sure some of the randomly generated signs have shown the names of actual villages I've visited in real life.

Gameplay wise, Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a very tense experience. Given you start the game with the aristocrat loadout like a true Bri'ish Chad, you are largely defenceless until you find a weapon. From what I've seen, the weapons available are: the shotgun (found on the hunters), revolver (found on the squires but also spawn in houses), blunderbuss (found on the poachers), the hatchet (found in various loot containers) and the rifle which I only ever found ammo for. The combat is serviceable. The guns feel fine to use but aiming feels a little janky sometimes. The hatchet on the other hand is extremely clunky and slow. Normally this would be a fairly damning indicator that a game is in fact not very good, however, in this case it actually works spectacularly in Sir, You Are Being Hunted's favour. Hatchets are quite common, guns are quite the opposite. I found a revolver in a house once in my last run, any other guns I found after that were on the corpses of enemies I killed with said revolver. Ammo is very scarce. You can occasionally find ammo for all the guns in houses or on enemies but usually in very small quantities. On top of this, ammo can take up a lot of inventory space. You can only stack 2 shotgun shells in 1 slot, 6 revolver bullets in 1 slot and 10 rifle bullets in 2 slots. This makes combat very risky. You likely wont even have enough ammo to take on more than 3 or 4 enemies at any given time. As a result, stealth is more often than not the most sensible option for getting past groups of enemies. To assist you in your sneaking efforts, you can find items such as empty bottles and alarm clocks with which to distract your foes. Stealth in this game feels like a genuinely rewarding and intense experience. I have had many close calls, saved by my sudden remembrance that I still have a bottle in my inventory and promptly throwing it in the opposite direction of where I want to go. The pieces that you need to retrieve to progress the game are always closely watched by at least 2 hunters so you may need to engage in combat at some point in your run but with a combination of clever inventory management and maybe a bit of luck you should have enough tools at your disposal to allow to slip in and out, unseen.

The enemies in this game are all intimidating in their own unique ways. The hunters are a rather formidable force in large enough numbers and can see you pretty easily. The dogs may not do much damage but they pin you down and add and extra level of terror to combat encounters. The squires are just rather pleasant chaps given you don't steal anything from the villages they patrol (trust me, they will know) and even fight with the other enemies sometimes. The poachers are really cute and I wish they didn't hate me. The scarecrows never gave me any trouble but you do need to be wary of them. The riders can eat shit and die and the landowner is a fat fuck. I think I've covered all the enemies there. There's also a bloke in a hot air balloon who patrols the island but he's very slow and the most he does is alert nearby enemies to your location if he sees you. I've also seen a tentacled robot sea monster pop up fairly frequently along the coasts of the islands but it's never attacked me.

My only real complaint is that this game has almost fuck all lore. You get a short cutscene when you start in which a man who I can only assume is the player character's butler explains that you have accidentally teleported to this strange archipelago after some kind of scientific experiment gone wrong. You start at a stone circle in the middle of the central island. You must locate parts of a device used in this experiment and return them to this stone circle. That's just about all the info you are given. No explanation for why these islands are inhabited by robots, no explanation as to why these robots are posh and no clues as to what your experiment even was. Now, there are letters which can be found in houses you come across but they are very few and far between. Some of the letters don't even reveal anything related to the game's lore and none that I've found link to any of the other letters. This is very frustrating. I'm usually most sucked into a game and immersed when it has some good juicy lore to uncover. This game just teases you with it's letters which don't really reveal anything and I feel the player is actually blocked off from finding a lot of them as so many villages are patrolled by increasingly large parties of enemies. I hope in the remaster that there will maybe be some additions which make the lore a little more obvious, or at least increase the spawn rate of the letters so the player actually has a good chance to read them all.

Overall I love this game. I can forgive the lack of meaningful story for it's sheer magnificence in the atmosphere and gameplay department. If I had to score it I'd say it is a very solid 8/10 at the very least. Fuck you guy who reviewed this for PC gamer in 2014, I hope you got fired.",1631748405,1631748405,True,16,0,0.660198330879211426,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have enjoyed it very much, and it is loads of fun with friends. That being said, I will go into my gripes with the game first.
My main issue with the game is that it gets stale fast. The game-play loop basically boils down to wander aimlessly until you see a smoke cloud, then grab the monolith piece, and return. There is some looting to be had, but outside of getting a few bits of food and a half decent weapon, you will mostly be hauling it to just get the fragments and get out. Enemies often form large groups, making combat a distant second to stealth and running away. Ultimately, the issue is there is too little variety. More ways to interect with this quirky world and its enemies are sorely needed. 
However, I will say the core game is well built. Health and vitality are well balanced, combat never felt unfair, aside from maybe fighting 10 enemies in the first place. Stealth is clearly explained to the player, the robots are suitably terrifying to make hiding from them fun. 
Like I said it gets boring fast, but with friends, or in short, spread out sessions (like the game you play once every few months) it is quite enjoyable.",1626907086,1626907086,True,1,1,0.50231480598449707,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was disappointed with this title, I found it boring and empty, the land all looks the same, you can't go into buildings and the loot grid system is a major pain.

I came across three buildings all named the same like it was some kinda asset flip, the funny thing is that they we're right beside each other, very lazy.

Hiding from the robots seem like a boring chore rather then a man hunt.. all for what, to collect these stone things to get off the islands.

I wish I could have played longer but my tolerance for boring survival is spent... 40 mins was enough

Ugly looking
Boring 
Empty

Attingendo a piene mani dal racconto di Richard Connell ""La preda pi√π pericolosa"" e rivisitandolo in salsa fantascientifica, il gioco riesce a fare ci√≤ che promette fin dal titolo: farvi sentire una preda. 
Piccolo consiglio prima di giocare: meno sapete del gioco e meglio √®. Per questo rimarr√≤ abbastanza vago nella recensione.
A prescindere dal ""kit"" con cui abbiamo scelto di iniziare (io consiglio l'aristocratico, per un immersione completa) ci ritroveremo in continuazione a sgattaiolare in mezzo a campi di grano, rovine di antichi castelli e cittadine fantasma in cerca di cibo o qualsiasi cosa possa tornarci utile per sopravvivere ai nostri inseguitori. Pi√π volte mi sono ritrovato immobile stretto in un angolo buio sperando che i robotici cacciatori  alle mie calcagna non mi trovassero.
All'inizio il gioco sar√† abbastanza semplice: pochi cacciatori in giro per la mappa e poche tipologie, con la conseguente possibilit√† di correre dove vogliamo, lootando senza paura. Con l'avanzare del tempo (e della missione principale) i nemici sulla mappa aumenteranno e ne incontreremo di diversi tipi. Una delle cose che ho amato di pi√π in questo gioco √® stata quella di ritrovarmi davanti un robot-cacciatore  che non avevo mai incontrato prima e provare da un lato curiosit√† e dall'altro paura di cosa potesse farmi se mi avesse visto.
Ora, io vorrei dirvi che andando pi√π avanti nel gioco i ruoli si ribaltano e saremo noi quelli a cacciare ma... molto probabilmente non sar√† cos√¨. Io non amo i giochi stealth ma molte volte, nonostante avessi un'arma e un sufficiente numero di munizioni, ho preferito giocarmela in sicurezza, usando sotterfugi e nascondendomi per evitare il nemico. Ricordate: sparare attirer√† altri cacciatori verso la vostra posizione. 
Detto ci√≤, il gioco non √® perfetto. Io lo considero un gioco con enormi possibilit√† solo parzialmente messe in atto, ed √® un vero peccato. La trama poteva essere un po pi√π dettagliata e nonostante ci siano in giro lettere o libri che spiegano gli eventi, ho scoperto che non sar√† possibile trovarli tutti alla prima partita. Anche la mancanza di interni (oltre alle rovine del castello) si fa sentire dopo qualche ora. Mancanza parzialmente compensata dalle ottime atmosfere e dai biomi ben distinti fra di loro.
Comunque finito il gioco sono stato contento di averlo comprato e per questo ve lo consiglio.",1622316163,1622316163,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Sir you are being hunted is a quirky survival game with robust combat, stealth and inventory management mechanics. 

It marries all of these elements well together leading to interesting and unique encounters even after many hours of game play.

The procedural environments (a engine component that was all the rage when this game came out) works incredibly well. Unlike others Ames that use a similar system, the environments and the assets in them make sense and are pleasing to look at and discover.

My personal review:

This game does a really good job of lampooning British culture in many ways. Mainly mocking common archetypes of the British middle class and landed gentry, it really gives a great number of nods to lots of different things.

From English-little-village place names (all complete with their own war memorial) to the very reason that you can stealth being because you are wearing tweed!

I think that this game is possibly 20% more enjoyable to me simply because I‚Äôm English and can appreciate the frequent tiny (but not insignificant) gags and Easter eggs (looking at you dead haggis).

I‚Äôm so happy I redownloaded this and so happy I paid for it after pirating it when I was much younger. 

It‚Äôs a total gem, you‚Äôll enjoy it - it‚Äôs worth the price",1620332932,1620332932,True,2,0,0.542645275592803955,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is great, but it does have it's quirks and bugs. They're not major enough to destroy the mood, except for the occasional falling through the ground.

There's a certain pace to this open-world stealth game that make it exciting and scary. Comparing it to their other first-person game, The Signal From T√∂lva, there's also a lot of walking, but both find ways to make it interesting and feel fine. In SYABH, there's so much walking, crouching and waiting, but they made it feel necessary and stimulating. You're measuring distances robots are from you, counting robots in the distance against the amount of bullets you have, watching your vitality drop while you're hiding, and calculating your next move.

The sound design is pretty well done, and there's so much listening in this game - every beep, boop, clank and stomp are felt. You're listening for who's making a noise, how many of them, which direction they are, and if they're coming your way. The ambient music and sound are so appropriate, and I enjoy having that suspense broken by a flock of squawking birds giving away my position or [spoiler]the splashing of water when robot tentacles surface[/spoiler]. The narration and robot banter is also a nice break once in a while as its both charming and humorous.

The character design and how new robots appear as your progress is an excellent escalation. My first encounters with hunters was terrifying, and after I felt like I had a handle of luring, evading, and killing them, they introduce more and challenging robots to deal with. They all fit together in a very interesting way, making nothing feel safe by the end of it all. I personally really enjoy the feeling of terror when I see a large, stalking robot in the distance making noises.

As the maps are randomly generated, there's a decent variation to the biomes they create. One of my few issues with the terrain is not being able to properly identify how concealing a bush will or won't be and climbing up steeper slopes or even rocks has some jankiness to it. I've only tried the multiplayer a couple of times, and both times the other player and me fell through the ground - which I believe had been corrected but I haven't played it since.

Although it's been well over 7 years since this has come out, I just finished it after a few failed runs, and still really enjoy it.

Y ni as√≠.
Me ha parecido un juego bastante malo. Un shooter en el que empiezas sin armas, y los objetos que vas encontrando son de la √≠ndole de roedores muertos y alimentos podridos. Unas casas y edificios que est√°n de adorno, y s√≥lo puedes interactuar con la puerta para recoger objetos absurdos y sin sentido, esperando tener suerte y que te salga alguna arma con la que poder hacer frente a unos robots que quieren darte caza cual jabal√≠.
Los escenarios se generan aleatoriamente, pero tal generaci√≥n se la pod√≠an haber ahorrado, ya que siempre es lo mismo.
Repetitivo, anodino y cansino. Los gr√°ficos no son cosa de otro mundo y el sonido tampoco me entusiasma.

It has a unique ""survive, scavenge, and story"" type feel to it. Highly customizable in terms of game play. The game revolves around finding pieces of a device to ultimately win the game. There are (15??) pieces to collect and 5 islands to get them all from. You are able to customize all the 5 islands and which enemies spawn at which points in time making the game easier or harder. The game itself isn't too hard until the later stages on just default mode (I played as the default character and put 1 of every kind of island). Great potential for different challenging forms of play. Now to explain why I would NOT recommend this game. As a matter of principle I feel I should mention at the time of purchasing this game I bought it as a Alpha type game. After the developers added a few of the things they said they would add they slapped a ""1.0"" on it made a couple of ""patches"" and declared the game ""finished"". The final game is nothing like what they promised it would be. I cant say it isnt fun as a solo type game but the multiplayer is absolutely horrible. On numerous tries the Host has no issues but the guest will get teleported under the map, fall through the ground resulting in their death, get stuck running in place are some examples of the worst issues. The developers have abandoned this game and do not plan on returning to it after all this time they still insist this is the final product. All in all for a solo 1 or 2 time playthrough its not that bad, but really its just a shadow of the game it was supposed to be.

The title itself brings an air of silliness to it, an air of silliness which is only exacerbated by the comically British narrator and enemies. 

But this game has quite a lot to offer beyond a laugh or two. Pretty quickly, you learn that the opponents are deceptively powerful, as a small excursion of two or so robots can quickly turn into a mob of near a dozen, all firing at you as you run through the trees. You learn quickly to utilize stealth to gain the upper hand, as your shotgun, pistol, and/or axe aren't going to cut it (no pun intended) when you're faced with enough enemies. And the stealth system is surprisingly robust, too, especially for the time: crouching in darkness or among dense foliage can make you darn near invisible, giving you a sense of pride as you slink between patrols of enemies (that is, until they step on you). Setting up traps or using one of the several different methods of distraction is fun and exhilarating, and well-balanced to allow you enough leeway to get what you need done while still having a smart enough AI that it will punish you for any hubris while you sneak away. If you scare off a group of crows while trudging through the forest, it alerts nearby searching parties, forcing you to evacuate the area before they find you. 

It goes both ways, too; the robots really feel as though they're a part of this world, as they're also vulnerable to many of the pitfalls that you are, such as scaring off crows to give away their position, or running into traps that you've set. It lends itself to be really intuitive when you're trying to sneak past a patrol to loot a town, while also not making it too easy on you. 

The game really ramps up after a couple of hours, when the robots begin to send more and more forces after you. A lot of the negative reviews for this game chastise it for being boring - I don't think many of them actually saw the massive, lumbering Landowner appear from a patch of woods and begin chasing after you, though. The game often throws curveballs like this towards you, and while they may not always be fair (as it is a randomly generated game), it's certainly going to keep you on your toes. 

That being said, the game is simple. But that's okay! Minecraft is simple, too. The reason why games like these are so good is because they take one, core mechanic and they make it click almost perfectly. I wish more games would take the foundation of this game, the robust stealth mechanics, and the unique sense of dread and incorporate it into a larger-scale project and narrative. Smaller indie developers like Big Robot tend to do a great job with this, and I hope they find success implementing these sorts of things into AAA games, too.",1610425218,1610425218,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Contrary to its promotional material, [i]Sir, You Are Being Hunted[/i] is not a funny game - its substance is of mechanics and style, not of words. Yes, enemies are amusing to look at, and using alarm clocks and toy trains as distraction tools can be entertaining, but make no mistake - this game's stealth is rather unforgiving. It does a very good job making an open-world where stealth is a neccessity rather than an option - if you are discovered, more often than not you will be quickly hunted down. That's a feat few manage to accomplish.

The combination of different enemy types and devices in your inventory can lead to uniquely tense situations you will not soon forget. I think I will forever remember how I was hiding in the wheat field, shaking as two jockeys were riding almost over my head and both roads along the field were being partolled by two large squads of robots, and the way that I was supposed to go stood a scarecrow which, if I moved too soon, would surely alert all the scrap-metal gentry in the vicinity.

I played for the first two hours and vastly enjoyed the experience, but I quickly started noticing several flaws as I moved forward, so glaring that I grew a hatred for the game rather than the passionate liking I originally had. 
The game is super unpolished.
It's been out for 7+ years and the game still feels like it's incomplete, not to mention the creators are moving onto more ambitious projects like The Light game, I can only believe this game was just some passion project.
The menu is confusing to navigate, especially when you're trying to start your first campaign, which feels more like a minecraft world without the passion of building or crafting or mining, just some guy aimlessly wandering until he stumbles across some gems.
All the items are incredibly displeasing to look at, in your inventory and in your hand. It feels like they settled for their first draft of design and never updated it.
There is literally no point to the water. Going in it can get you killed, and there's never a reason to go in it. They didn't even bother adding a swimming mechanic, you just stand in the water to infinatum until you get bored or the bog monster takes you. 
The games lore is unfinished and unpolished, if there even is lore.
Enemies AI is generally okay, but the way you're hunted makes it feel like a constant game of going bush to bush until you find a gem, then bush to bush again. The cooler looking enemies don't provide a lot, there's no reason to become the hunter because killing enemies is virtually unrewarding and time consuming.
You would imagine the hunters, after spotting you, the only thing left to do is finish the job. But the hunters are notoriously bad at killing you. Even at close ranges I find it hillariously easy to strike one down with an axe despite the fact he's wielding a shotgun. Their aim is god awful and they shoot each other more than shoot me, thus creating robot gang violence.
The difficulty scaling is also very unpolished, with timers indicating when certain enemies spawn, and by the ""end of the game""m (I say this because once every timers up there is no scaling, just you going around until all the gems are got) you never get room to breathe as hundreds of hunters spawn. Different islands don't get difficult scaling, all the enemies are the same across each island, based on timers and gems.
You kill every single enemy on the first island, leave and come back, and suddenly there's those enemies and more. You don't feel rewarded, you feel cheated. 
The different islands offer little variety save from some textures and structures found, and there's never any unique enemies for different zones. 
The game also takes a long time to load, despite the fact it's held together by string and tape.
There is lots I like about this game too, but it cant overshadow the fact this game is unfinished garbage that they don't intend of fixing any time soon. 
I enjoyed the atmosphere the game creates. 
The sound is very well implemented along with the usage of spatial awareness via sounds like footsteps or speaking. 
The textures on trees, grass and fences and even some of the roads and houses are appealing to look at and really make me feel like I'm being hunted by british robots. 
For what its worth, the purposes of each enemy is fulfilled well. To the Landowners terrifying posture and ever-lasting threat, to the gentleman who guards homes. Each enemy has a purpose it serves, just there's so much that could be added to make this game full. 
Nothing would make me happier than this games multiplayer being updated, unique enemies and better textures which they're clearly capable of. 
I spent 20$ on this game so you don't have to. This would be the only game I actually recommend pirating, or just getting for a dollar. They aren't going to update it, so you have nothing to worry about.

This is probably due to all entities in the world being despawned and spawned, it would seem; so it isn't to hard to understand the reason for this issue.

Other than the above stated, the game is a fantastic light stealth survival game. I can run it on a 12? year old computer (i stopped counting after 10), so lag won't be an issue.

The actual gameplay is fun and thrilling for the first 2-3 hours, but becomes boring and tedious towards the end game. Once you realise that fighting the robots is the thing that's most likely to get you killed, stealth is really the only option unless you want a real challenge.

I wasn't able to finish it until I turned Most of the enemies completely off and then I fucked around for a while regularly getting scared half to death by the thing that shows up out of the water. So I don't know how balanced the default settings are, but they are extremely customizable, so you're fine either way. In that sense, it's one of the most disability-friendly games in the genre. Probably not so hot if you're colorblind or have very bad eyesight though.

I find the premise charming, and I think it was implemented fairly well. I love that you can shoot the birds and rabbits going about for food, and they're not just there to fill up space. I love the variety of starting states you can pick from. I love the snarky tone of the butler. I love that you can change from ""Sir"" to ""Madam"" just because. I love the descriptions of the items, I love that you can store items in certain locations for later and Only Find Them There (unlike games where you put something in a chest and find it in every other iteration of that chest everywhere else).

I do not know if I could Use these mechanics if I was playing on standard difficulty. Probably Not. I am Very Bad at Stealth.  But it's so fun, for a little while. I imagine it's even more fun if you're somewhat skilled.

The one thing I feel is missing is a proper end to wrap it up. You put all the pieces together and nothing happens. It doesn't turn out that the butler set you up to get murdered by bots, or how the bots ended up there, or what experiments you were running. There's lore scattered in the letters, but I never found them all, and I like games with stories, so that was a slight let-down for me.

at first the atmophere is so damn good when you really play like being the weak hunted guy who wants absolutely not get into trouble

the sound is so well made even some triple AAA studios could learn from these guys but thats about it at least for me

as soon as you realize how easy it is to run away from the robots with infinite stamina all the atmosphere is gone and as soon as you find your first gun you will see headshot get them down like in any other game

but you will run out of ammo soon and the run away game starts all over

like i said the first half hour was really a blast so tense but yeah all gone now sadly 

i suggest having a look at generation zero instead wich has a better balance between sneaking shooting and running in my opinion and it also has very good sounds specially the robot sounds are very good and oberall the modern graphics look a lot better

i dont call syabh overall a bad game but for 2020 it has not enough to stay in my library i wish i had played it back then 

if i could i had given a thumb to the side cause im sure one or the other guy out there may have some fun with it

Pros:
-Gameplay
-Atmosphere

Cons:
-Replayability

?
-Multiplayer (never played)

It's an open-world, horror, FPS, adventure type of game with a little bit of survival elements. There are 5 different islands, each with a certain piece of element that you need to get. You need to travel to those islands, find the element, take it and move on. You have to be discrete so that you don't alarm the guards in the islands. Sometimes you have to eliminate them. Sometimes you have to fight them and sometimes you have to run away. 

The uniqueness comes from the difficulty of the game. It requires patience, attention. The sources for weapons are scarce and the inventory is limited, so you have to plan your belongings very well. You cannot save everywhere, so you have to plan your attacks very well. The map is not very informative, so you have to observe your surroundings very well. There are different kind of weapons and enemies which doesn't allow the gameplay to be monotone. 

The game also requires courage. The atmosphere is very dark. You get really scared to go out because they can kill you, but you also have to hurry because the enemy gets stronger with passing time. This way the game doesn't let you rest, it keeps you tense all the time. 

Once the game finishes, you linger there wanting more of it but there is nothing much to do. You can replay with a different character, but you wouldn't want it because the game is already very tense, you wouldn't want to experience the same thing again. I didn't play in multiplayer mode. It could be very good, but I don't think I could find many people playing this.

The graphics are a little bit outdated, but that isn't much of a concern for me.",1587647139,1587647684,True,5,0,0.540832400321960449,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The premise was pretty cool, survive by sneaking around Robot gentlemen on a procedurally generated British Isle.

I only just beat the game (going through my backlog quarantined from the Coronavirus) . Took me about 4 hours or so for that playthrough.  I'd say the game is worth one playthrough. It's an interesting moment when you find yourself putting back rifle ammo so you can make room for an alarm clock. At the same time, don't expect to have much more fun beyond that one playthrough. You will have pretty much seen everything. The infinite number of islands are all the same, and at some point the strategy of using a distraction to get your maguffin is rote. If you are a big fan of stealth games, you'll probably recognize this as an interesting experiment.

The comedy is amusing, the feel of constantly being behind enemy lines is thrilling, and the shooting works surprisingly well for a game that feels so low-budget. My biggest gripe with the game is that I noticed after a while, where the game starts ramping up in difficulty, that the difficulty spike just felt way too steep. 

Basically, you're this high-class British man/woman who has to find pieces to some kind of teleporter machine in order to escape this world filled with murderous machines. You find machine parts throughout different locations, carry them back to the teleporter and eventually after you find enough pieces you can escape. And with every piece you bring back to the machine, more enemies and enemy types spawn in to make the hunt a little more intense. 

The increased difficulty would be perfectly fine, except a few key things make it feel outrageously unfair...

1. There are no health packs to regenerate health, If you get hurt, you have to run and hide until your health regenerates. 

2. Ammo is scarce. Too scarce. Hardly ever in houses, and mostly found on enemies. Sure, you can pull it off enemies you kill, but sometimes their guns get destroyed in the combat which makes you lose any ammo you could have gained. 

3. This lovely bleeding mechanic that can trigger when you get hurt. The more you bleed, the faster your health depletes. The only way to stop bleeding is to apply bandages which you can only use by coming to a dead stop, frantically searching your inventory, and applying the bandages manually. At first, this doesn't seem too bad when there's not that many enemies early in the game, but you really start to notice how inconvenient this mechanic is when you're running for your life from a mob of killer robots (with guns, mind you) while bleeding profusely from bullet wounds. When you start bleeding, you're pretty much screwed because if you run while bleeding, you're dead. And if you stop to bandage yourself, you're dead. 

Now, I know what you're thinking; ""Just don't fight the robots then!"" Well, here's the catch...after you find so many pieces to the machine, more and more enemies spawn in and it gets to the point where it feels nigh impossible to make any progress without getting into combat. 

The breaking point for me was when I had one more machine part to collect in an area. This particular machine part happened to spawn in this thicket area smack dab in the middle of the island, where a group of robots was guarding the part. To make matters worse, groups of hunters and other enemies were constantly patrolling the area around the thicket. 
In short, couldn't sneak in because there were so many enemies and the thicket made it hard to see where I was going. Fighting wasn't really an option, because I could only find and carry so much ammo and I was severely outgunned anyway. And every time I tried to distract the robots with a noise making device, I tried sneaking away from the sound source only to get spotted by robots anyway because there were so many of these guys patrolling the area. At this point in the game, I'd died about only four times. After trying and failing to get this piece repeatedly, that number bumped up to the 20's.

Now despite my ranting, I'm not saying I hated this game. I actually really enjoyed the concept, and if you like stealth FPS games there's some good fun to be had here. Just understand that this is game does have its flaws that can make it very frustrating to play at times. If you can overlook some of the clunky mechanics and the difficulty curve, then you'll probably enjoy it. Just beware, this game takes a lot of patience. A LOT of patience.",1582155710,1582155710,False,4,0,0.499448478221893311,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You have used a strange machine that has malfunctioned and taken you into an alternative reality where robots have taken over, and your Butler advises you to find the pieces of the machine and bring them back to the standing stone on the center island. The gameplay is similar to that of the Thief series but using brush and foliage rather than shadows. There's an inventory and you need to find tea and biscuits every once in a while so you won't starve.

The procedurally generated 5 islands are individually striking and, for what the graphics are, they are pretty, mimicking the British countryside and environs. As it's different in each playthrough it does make for some replayability, but you have to give it some time, because there's not much beyond the survival element and looking for the machine pieces.

This game has little story, if any, but I personally didn't mind. I was too busy sneaking around the countryside, running from robots with guns and their robodogs, up to my nose in mud and beartraps, my heart in my throat the whole time. This game is really meant for people who get something out of the experience, the gameplay, the immersion, the fear and sneaky satisfaction. It's mesmerizing, but if it seems too slow or you don't see any point in it then this game isn't for you. There's no cinematics or saving the world. It's just saving your hide. From Gentlemen Robots.

There is an adjustable difficulty for each enemy type, and there are several to keep an eye on, and the islands become unforgivingly crowded near the end. Brutally funny is the perfect description.

It has it's scary moments for such a whimsical idea but this game is absolutely fantastic! It was 100% worth the money and is one of my favorites, very satisfying to finish. This is a very underrated title, and if anyone cares, Gloomwood looks like it'll be very similar sneaky, creepy, gentleman game. This game is up there on my list of greats because, although there's not much to it, the simple wonders of stealth is strong with this one. I would advise a podcast in the background while you play, especially a funny one, because this game is rather tongue-in-cheek...

The atmosphere is the best part of the game, and the sound design makes sneaking up to robots incredibly tense. Every beep and boop has you on edge, and you don't know whether you've been spotted until the guns start to go off! 

It is perfect for some casual playing for fun - watching the intro, spying on the robots, getting a piece or two, visiting one of the other islands to get a change in surroundings... But the game becomes more monotonous as you keep going, until the final stretch ends up being a bit of a chore with enemies that aren't so much challenging as they are annoying. 
For dedicated stealth-game players/lovers, I don't think this game is for you. Hiding options are limited to crouching and breaking the line of sight, and the maps are very open. Hiding behind a tree or rock is about as complex as it is going to get. Your standard distraction items are present - a trumpet to make noise, a toy train to make noise that moves, a clock to make noise after some time, a rock to make noise, and a glass bottle to make noise. Every encounter to get hold of a machine piece will quickly start looking the same. See piece, assess robots, throw distraction, grab piece, done. Escaping from robots is simple as well, if you are not right at their feet - a brisk sprint is enough to keep you alive. 

There is a rudimentary survival system in place that allows you to hunt rabbits and other game and cook them for recovery items, but once you learn how to circumvent the basic robot hunters you will never struggle for food again. It is far more likely that you will end up with a bloated inventory that forces you to throw food out so you can take a machine piece with you! There are junk items and dubious items in the game that risk lowering your condition when you eat them, but this is not randomised, so you will quickly learn which items are useless. 


Final verdict; a really great time on the short term, kind of a drag at long term. The best aspect of it is fighting the robots, and the tension from sneaking really close to them, but there isn't much more that makes this game fun. I still really recommend it, I had a blast, and I still occasionally pick it up. For a game that needs some work around gameplay, the world feels alive and mysterious!

You (m/f) are a fop and you get dropped on an island full of robots hunting you. You have to gather 'the things' and bring them to 'the place' to escape. There's a couple of different starting options, e.g. the cook, the trapper, the officer. You scour the four (five?) islands looking for 'the things' while trying to avoid the robots and gathering items. There's weapons, food, distraction items, usable items (e.g. matches) and junk. You find them on enemies and in houses - which have no interiors, you just 'use' the doors.

The concept is fun, being hunted is quite tense and it's different from most games. Unfortunately, it's not without its problems:

The game takes several minutes to randomly generate the world. When it's done an introductory video starts playing. I missed half of it because i was in the kitchen. If you have long loading times, don't automatically start anything at the end but bring up a ""click to continue"" prompt.

The controls are clunky, you can't simply drag items from your (non-auto-sorting) inventory to drop them, you have to right-click on them to bring up a menu that includes the ""drop"" option. This gets old real quick. 

After finding the second 'thing' i looked everywhere but just couldn't find the third one. You have to look for smoke but i only found fireplaces i couldn't use, because both of the ""easy"" starting options lack matches and i didn't find any in the 35 minutes i played. Which is kinda confusing.

The buildings are really really low resolution. Seriously, it's sometimes hard to tell what part is the door.

At some point i tried to get to a part of the island i hadn't been to. There was a poorly generated gap in between. I fell in the water. There was no way to get out. I couldn't even swim out to sea. 

Asking ‚Ç¨20 for a semi-finished game is just an insult.",1570490775,1570490775,False,10,2,0.570099294185638428,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This is a randomly generated world kind of game, meaning that each time you play the game, it will have a different map to traverse, along with different item spawns. When it comes to these games, the usual deciding factors revolve around RNG(random number generation), meaning you have a chance of starting with some of the best stuff in the game near where you spawn in, yet you have just as much of a random chance for nothing of use to be around you from every corner. Now while I have only one full playthrough on singleplayer to go by, I think there is enough to circumvent that frustration here. For starters: classes that gives you items to start with, allowing you to start off with a crutch or with little to nothing, for those that wants a more ""raw"" survival experience. It was definitely a bit difficult at first, as it was best to be as smart as humanly possibly when dealing with the robotic enemies that search around the map for you, but it mostly depends on how many and what type they are, along with what methods you have of dealing with them. Basic robots tends to just have a simple shotgun, but if you had lets say, an axe, you can just land two hits on them, especially if you get them while reloading, so they go from a pretty big early game threat, to a small challenge to defeat when you can for the extras they drop. Dogs are alot harder if you're not ready to shoot them before they lunge at you, landowners are giants that can take all too much punishment so I try to stay clear of them so far, the blunderbust wielding midgets that are found in the groups of trees are just devastating if they hit you with a shot, the fat guys that roam the towns can take alot of bullets but drop revolvers with a fair amount of ammo on them to make them worth taking down, then you also have jousting robots on robot horses that are a pain in the ass if you're not ready to hit the main robot as many times as you can in his face, you have robots up in hot air balloons that have searchlights for your ass, and finally f  u  c  k  i  n  g scarecrows that follow you and make you a paranoid human as they do everything they can to make you dread hearing them teasing being behind you! That aside? The game is actually quite quirky with its parody of British culture, while having alot of personality from its enemies to the general tone this game gives. It may not be a looker, but god damn will it make you have chills with the kind of atmosphere it strives for and succeeds in, its a shame it seems this game isn't talked about or even updated too regularly, because its definitely worth a look!",1568427573,1568427573,True,1,0,0.493994683027267456,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Il gioco inizia con noi che ci risvegliamo su questa isola e il nostro scopo √® quello di trovare dei pezzi di un marchingegno che ci permetter√† di fuggire, peccato che l'isola √® disseminata di robot ""inglesi"" che ci danno la caccia. Il gioco non √® ambientato su una sola isola ma su un arcipelago formato da cinque isole, una centrale e le altre nei quattro punti cardinali. All'inizio di una partita si pu√≤ scegliere il ""tema"" delle singole isole poi vengono generate in modo procedurale, per√≤ la cosa funziona solo a met√†, alla fine le isole sembrano comunque tutte uguali cambiano giusto qualche edificio, si pu√≤ scegliere il proprio equipaggiamento iniziale e si inizia la ricerca di questi pezzi sparsi tra le isole, nelle isole troviamo questi robot ""inglesi"" che ci danno la caccia, noi dobbiamo sfuggire a questi robot e sopravvivere, l'idea di fondo del gioco √® intrigante ma √® sviluppata un p√≤ male. 

La parte survival del gioco √® basilare, l'unica cosa che ci viene chiesta √® quella di cercare del cibo per mantenerci in salute, non c'√® crafting, basta girare per le case per trovare del cibo, case che non possono essere esplorate all'interno ma sono in fin dei conti delle grosse casse. Oltre al cibo possiamo trovare qualche arma, qualche oggetto per distrarre i robot e tante tantissime cianfrusaglie, √® incredibile come gli sviluppatori sono riusciti a creare tanti oggetti inutili (inutili veramente non hanno nessun utilizzo in gioco) e pochi oggetti utili. Per evitare i robot basta non farsi vedere, si avanza accucciati nell'erba alta, si posso distrarre e anche affrontare ma √® sconsigliato perch√© i proiettili sono pochi e loro con un paio di colpi ti mandano all'altro mondo oltre che il rumore di spari attira tutti i robot dell'isola. Ad inizio gioco il numero e i tipi di robot sono pochi, man mano che accumuliamo i pezzi aumenta sia il numero che i tipi di robot, i tipi di robot sono sufficienti e alcuni sono veramente inquietanti.

A livello grafico e sonoro il gioco √® sufficiente, niente di che ma fa il suo lavoro. Il gioco √® in prima persona ed ha un ciclo giorno notte, alla fine il gioco diverte ma un p√≤ ripetitivo, bastava veramente poco per renderlo un buon gioco, in primis un sistema di crafting anche basilare, molti pi√π oggetti utili e gli interni nelle strutture, io l'ho preso a 1$ con altri giochi e secondo me √® da prendere solo cosi perch√© in giro ci sono survival migliori. Il gioco ha anche una componente multyplayer tipica di questo genere di giochi.

Been on my wishlist for a while because I like stealth games.

Is the game tedious? Sometimes. Is it visually underwhelming? Sure. Is it a bit barebones? Absolutely.

But my god did I have fun.

The premise of Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a simple one. You're tasked with collecting 16 artifacts of varying sizes across 5 areas, each cardinal direction and the center. You have an inventory which is grid-based (think Resident Evil 4) and you have a fairly limited amount of inventory to carry weapons, ammo, healing items, traps, and the aforementioned artifacts, which can either take up 1, 3, or 16 squares. You often won't know how big the artifact is until you attempt to pick it up, which is really stressful when you have a full inventory and you realize it's the largest artifact size while you're trying to clean out space as the enemies you lured away are gradually returning to their post.

As the name would imply, you are indeed being hunted by a variety of British robots that have very solid AI and can see relatively far. Your stealth meter depends on whether it's daytime/nighttime, whether you're sprinting, running, standing or crouching, as well as being contingent on if you're standing in the open or crouched in tall grass- your basic fare stealth mechanics.

The enemy design is pretty good. There are a variety of enemies to evade, the most common ones being the Hunter, a mustachio'd robot armed with a shotgun that either guards an artifact or patrols around villages and fields. They're easy to take down with 2 well-placed revolver shots, but if you're faced with more than 2 of them your best option is stealth instead of direct confrontation. There's also the squire who protects villages and will make quick work of you with his rapid-fire revolver that will kill you easily unless you're hiding behind cover, as well as the Hounds which patrol alongside hunters and run around quickly to sniff you out.

Probably the creepiest enemy is the Landowner, a giant hulking robot that can't be destroyed and slowly patrols around the area making these terrifying moose-esque shrieks and stomping ominously so you can hear him from a distance.

The scarecrow is without a doubt the most deadly enemy. Despite standing there and not doing any damage to you, once he spots you he'll teleport behind you indefinitely, emitting a loud shrieking sound that brings every enemy for miles. As soon as you realize he's seen you, you need to kill him FAST (like within 5 seconds) so you can have a chance of escaping undetected. If you don't, he'll simply lure all the nearby enemies towards him, at which point they'll stay, leaving you stuck and sure to die.

The gameplay consists of looting buildings for ammo and other helpful items and sneaking around trying to kill or avoid enemy robots. Once you beat the game, it basically just says ""good job, you beat the game"" and that's the end of it. Not much replayability unless you really like the game and want to try again on a harder difficulty (I played on Aristocrat mode per the game's recommendation). You'd think after such a long time of being out the creator would create achievements for the game, but he's understandably probably focusing on his newer games, which are more-or-less variations on SYABH's formula of resource management and stealth, but with a bigger emphasis on science fiction.

Overall, not a perfect game, but a damn enjoyable one, especially on sale. Shame it doesn't have more to it.",1565190498,1565190498,True,3,0,0.492753595113754272,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ever since I bought it, I've been playing and recording it for my Youtube channel. As of the posting of this review, I'm currently up to episode 256: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMIB5RQA8bE

And yet I've realised that, in all that time, I've never actually written a review for Sir, You Are Being Hunted. This has to be rectified immediately.

For me, Sir is the gift that keeps on giving, and it's definitely up there in my list of favourite games. I never anticipated, back in 2013, that I would still be playing this game today. Yet here I am, devising challenges to put a new slant on the gameplay with the help of my audience. With a bit of imagination, you can really get your money's worth out of a game like this!

So what is it about it that I like?

Whilst Sir is by no means an amazingly ground-breaking experience, it is nevertheless a fairly solid survival-stealth game. You're pitched into a sinister world that looks like the British countryside, except with a twist: it's populated by murderous aristocratic robots who enjoy hunting humans for sport. Did I also mention they have shotguns? Or revolvers, in some cases? Or blunderbusses? To avoid being turned into a human-skin rug or having your head mounted on a wall plaque, you need to sneak around a series of islands (which you can customise by tweaking their biomes and features, I will add) acquiring pieces of a device that will enable you to teleport out of there.

You can stealth it, using the environment for cover and drawing upon a variety of items to distract the robots. Or you can get your hands on some guns of your own and fight back! If you choose the latter though, take my advice:

1) Don't get too close to the Poacher. Or he'll blast your face off.
2) Don't get caught out in the open by the Rider. Or he'll rip your face off.
3) Don't get yourself in close proximity to the Landowner. Or he'll nuke your face off.
4) Don't get the Squire in a grumpy mood by raiding his village. Or he'll put six shots into you in quick succession... then tear your face off.

All in all, as someone who grew up in a rural area in the UK, the British rural theme for the setting is what really hooked me. That, plus the premise of being chased by upper class automatons.

Granted, there are elements of the game which could be improved or developed further. Sometimes the open countryside might benefit from having some more interactivity. There are also a lot of items you can find in the game that don't actually have a use. And, sadly, there doesn't seem to be as much activity on the multiplayer side of things as there used to be. But then again, I tend to stick to single player anyway.

Part of me wishes Big Robot, the developers, would come back to this game one day and add some new stuff. Seriously, this game could be really, really fleshed out even further with some new content. New biomes (the UK's full of diverse places that could easily inspire some new environments!); new types of enemy; new game mechanics (for example, one of the game's many food items is blackberries; but what about having the ability to forage them from bramble bushes rather than just finding them in buildings?); new uses for junk items; new animals to hunt (besides the usual rabbits and pheasants already in the game); these are all just some of the many ideas that could be added to a game of this kind. There used to be a small modding community around this game adding similar things to what I've mentioned, back in the day. If only they were still around!

It isn't BAD, it's just not for me.  Be aware that I couldn't even make it an hour in this game, so maybe it changes dramatically at some point.  I don't know.

This game is incredibly boring to me.  That's the first problem.  Everywhere in the starter area looks exactly the same and it's hard to tell what's what and where you're supposed to be going.  I wandered around (very slowly because this is a slow stealth game.) avoiding robots, found a few pieces of what I'm supposed to be collecting, and died several times.

That's problem two for me.  It's one of those games whose tutorial is ""Die repeatedly until you figure out how we expect you to play.""  Games are not real life.  They rely on mechanics and leeway to mimic real life, which is how games of all kinds get away with pressing a single button to perform what would be a complex series of actions in real life.  That's why we have tutorials, starter levels, etc.  To teach the player what the expectations and limitations are of the systems the devs use to mimic situations and actions.  Without these, you have to figure out the limitations set by the devs yourself.  For some, this is part of the fun.  For me, it feels like a chore.  Every single game is different.  What might help you in one game (like eating dubious looking food to fill your hunger meter) might kill you in another, or be anywhere in the spectrum between life and death.  Do they tell you that the moldy bread will demolish your hunger/vitality meter?  No.  You learn it the hard way, and once your hunger is at zero you start rapidly dying.  If that's your thing then this is your game.  If that's not your thing, be aware of it.  Everything is learned the hard way.  I don't play games to be punished, I play to relax and enjoy myself so it's a negative for me but I'm aware it's a selling point for others.

The hunger system in general is the third problem.  I played an hour.  I ate more in that hour that I have all day today, and I probably walked more in real life than I did in the game.  No one needs to eat this much.  I understand day and night cycles being faster, and to some extent hunger dropping faster, but it's at a ridiculous level.  I fought the hunger meter more than the robots that were hunting me.  I like the mechanic in some games.  It felt ridiculously overdone and tedious in this game.  It's a constant barrage of ""DON'T FOCUS ON THE OBJECTIVE OR AVOIDING FIGHTS OR EXPLORING, YOU'RE GOING TO F***ING DIE IN THE NEXT 15 SECONDS IF YOU DON'T CONSUME ANOTHER WHOLE CHICKEN.""  Finding unspoiled food was the primary focus of the hour that I played, and I'm not kidding.

The fourth issue is that there is no way to determine if you actually landed a shot on an enemy.  This goes back to ""things that are in place in the game to make up for the lack of detail involved in real life.""  I totally get not having a HUD.  It's great in many games.  You have to do things to make up for that lack of HUD though.  There is zero reaction from the enemy, zero sound (which a bullet hitting a robot would be loud.  I shoot steel targets, it makes a noise.) and zero HUD indication that you landed a hit.  You can't have nothing.  I would be fine with minor enemy displacement and a noise in place of a hit marker.  There's nothing.  There being nothing means it's hard to tell if there's an actual projectile and a need to lead targets, or if it's hitscan.  Another system limitation in place by the devs that you have no way of determining outside of repeated experimentation, wasted ammo, and dying a lot while reloading saves.  

A lot of people love this game, and that's because it's not bad.  The actual stealth seemed to work fine, I had no issues with the controls and it runs fine even though my PC is a little older these days.  It's not for me though.  The issues above aren't what I'm into.  If you're like me, the game will be frustrating and boring.  If you're shaking your head at my review and wishing I had left comments turned on so you could yell at me, then honestly you'll probably love it.  As I don't like it at all, I can't recommend it, which is why I do wish there was a neutral option.",1558210497,1558210511,False,14,0,0.684650897979736328,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its is a real shame the developers abandoned this baby. One of my favorite ""easy to launch"" games out there and I really hope that the developers would jump back into this gem soon!

Few notices:

+  There are lots of options to set to your playground, like which biomes do you want to play in or which enemies do you want to see and how early, etc...
+ I think the fight for survival feeling really feels in this game.
+ I just love how the game just begins to go harder and harder by every minute or by every recovered ""teleport"" piece.
+ Effects and atmosphere is really nice.
+ Lots of enemy types and I love how they slowly introduce themselves while playing the game. Its like the robots are getting smarter against you!
+ replayability 



-/+ Multiplayer! I love when developers add multiplayer to their singleplayer games and its awesome ( Looking at you Hinterlands and The Long dark... Please just do it! ), but it doesn't work with me anymore and it was really unbalanced and dull when I used to play it. I just wish it was just the Singleplayer Hardcore survival with friends, but it had more guns and some other differences.


- I wish there would be more in this game and so does everyone else who loved to play this game. I'm not saying the game is bad or anything, but the fans and the game just needs more love into it. Give it some new equipment, guns, NPC's or Fix the multiplayer to be better etc...

Summary:
Had no issues with performance. Totally worth the money if you want that easy to launch quick survival experience! 

Even tho the game is simple its really fun to play and I enjoyed my time in it and I don't see any reason why I would not jump back to it someday again. I'll give it a 60/100.

Basically it's a FPS/Stealth/Survival. There's not much in the way of crafting like in many survival games. It's more of a pubg type survival. You gear makes you better along with your skills as a player. Both improve as you play. It takes a few minutes to get into it if you start with almost no gear, but you have a nice range of starting options. They're thematic but it also connects to difficulty. For example, you can start as a game warden or a scientist, and they have different starting equipment and perhaps skills (not sure about that point yet). The gentleman starts with pretty much nothing. Once you find a couple of items that can help you transition from defensive stealth style to more offensive rambo style, the game really picks up. The hatchet is amazing. I have a blunderbuss, but haven't needed to shoot it yet. There must be a way to get a rifle or shotgun, but the ones I've found so far have all been broken.

If you're a casual player like me, give it an hour or so before you make any decisions about it. It seems a little kooky since you're a bunch of robots running around eating food, but it really seems to work. =)

This is a very well made game. I haven't encountered any bugs, the gameplay is perfect, and there's a mix of easy and difficult goals that you should skip around until you're ready to take them on. Pick the low hanging fruit first, move around, then pick the stuff that's higher up so to speak. Excellent. The save system is good too. You have a few spots that you can pretty easily get back to and save, so you're not spamming save all the time, nor are you risking too much if you decide to try out something that might be slightly out of your league.

I absolutely adore Sir, You Are Being Hunted. This game is art. The feeling that you are never, ever safe always keeps you on edge and keeps you moving. You will never be safe standing still for more than a moment!

The environment in this game is dull, but that is a good thing. The environment around you makes this experience even more creepy and provides that eerie feeling that many modern horror games just can't get right. You do not have knowledge on why the surrounding areas are colourless and bleak, or why you are even being hunted, and it should be kept that way to keep you wondering. Not only is the landscape creepy, but the robots that want to kill you are even creepier! There is a large variety to see and (hopefully) avoid, some of which include grounded, aerial and in water robots. I haven't even mentioned the scariest part yet - the voice in your head. He comes out of nowhere, I swear!

Unfortunately with every great Indie game comes a down side. The character you control is a bit clunky and jumping over things in this game is just about Hell, but I don't think that it renders you too helpless. It is frustrating when you have nowhere else to go other than into a field of grass and you can't make it over the hedges so you get shot a few times until you bleed out. Luckily though, on top of the hedge entrances, this is not a common occurrence.

Vous venez d'atterrir au milieu d'un archipel de 5 √Æles, toutes g√©n√©r√©es proc√©duralement. La partie commence syst√©matiquement √† c√¥t√© d'un monolithe aupr√®s duquel vous devrez rapporter 17 fragments √©parpill√©s sur l'archipel. Ces fragments sont n√©cessaires pour vous permettre de vous √©chapper et gagner la partie.

Comme expos√© plus haut, l'archipel est occup√© par des robots v√™tus √† la mode victorienne ; et ceux-ci vous chasseront √† vue. Vous allez donc devoir ruser, faire preuve de discr√©tion autant que d'inventivit√© afin d'explorer toutes les √Æles √† la recherche des fragments. Votre inventaire est limit√© et fonctionne par cases. Chaque objet que vous ramassez occupant une ou plusieurs cases, vous serez r√©guli√®rement contraint de vous d√©lester d'un item au profit d'un autre.
Vous devrez √©galement g√©rer une jauge de faim, qui s'√©l√®ve √† 100 points et d√©croit rapidement, √† raison de 1 point toutes les dix secondes. Cela prendra donc un peu plus de 16 minutes avant que vous ne commenciez √† mourir de faim. Si cela laisse une bonne marge, cela signifie tout de m√™me qu'il vaut mieux garder bonne allure. M√™me si la furtivit√© est primordiale, √©tant donn√© la raret√© des munitions, pas question pour autant de passer trop de temps √† rep√©rer les lieux.

Le c√¥t√© survie est assez basique. Les objets ‚Äì nourriture, munitions et babioles ‚Äì ne se craft pas, mais se r√©cup√®rent presque exclusivement en fouillant les maisons de petits hameaux diss√©min√©s sur l'archipel. Vous ne rentrez pas √† l'int√©rieur des b√¢timents, il vous suffit d'interagir avec les portes pour acc√©der √† leur contenu. Un peu d√©concertante, cette astuce technique qui permet de ne pas avoir √† mod√©liser les int√©rieurs s'int√®gre plut√¥t bien dans le gameplay. En effet, tandis que vous farfouillez dans votre inventaire, vous restez vuln√©rable des chasseurs qui r√¥dent.
Heureusement, vous pouvez d√©goter de nombreux outils pour faire diversion. Jeter une bouteille au loin, faire sonner un r√©veil, allumer un petit train ou jouer de la trompette... c'est un r√©gal que de voir une demi-douzaine de chasseurs s'√©lancer vers le bruit en vous laissant le champ libre.

Par d√©faut, les nombreux chasseurs qui √©cument l'archipel ne seront pas la seule menace. D'autres types d'ennemis, bien plus dangereux, apparaissent en fonction du temps qui passe ou du nombre de fragments que vous avez r√©colt√©. Cependant, la difficult√© est enti√®rement param√©trable, puisque vous pouvez librement ajuster le type et la fr√©quence des ennemis. Cela dit, le r√©glage par d√©faut est assez bien dos√©, je vous recommande donc de ne pas y toucher.

Graphiquement, Sir, you are being hunted est assez basique. Vous ne l'ach√®terez certainement pas pour ses performances techniques. Cependant, si l'exposition de son concept laisse pr√©sager d'un jeu avec une ambiance vraiment singuli√®re, force est de constater que le r√©sultat manque de panache. Les couleurs sont assez ternes, le d√©cor ne comporte rien de sp√©cial ; arbres, champs, cl√¥tures et maisons principalement ; et les robots n'ont finalement pas un caract√®re si marqu√© ‚Äì l'aspect gentlemen british n'√©tant que cosm√©tique.

C'est principalement ce point qui risque de f√¢cher. Sir, you are being hunted est un jeu bien con√ßu, disposant d'un gameplay solide et d'un concept plaisant ; mais il manque de sensation et d'atmosph√®re, en plus d'√™tre lin√©aire dans son d√©roulement (passer d'√Æle en √Æle pour collecter les fragment √† ramener au monolithe). De fait, la lassitude peut poindre plus ou moins rapidement ‚Äì √† ne pas confondre avec l'ennui, car les chasseurs, chiens et montgolfi√®res ne vous laisseront pas vous reposer.",1550268515,1550396274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]What It Is:[/b]
A survival type game focused around exploring multiple islands.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
You are dropped into a cold and unforgiving robot infested wasteland and tasked with finding some objects. It's about as bare-bones as it sounds.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Quite difficult, especially given the poor stealth mechanics which were never fully developed.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Not good. This game didn't really look good when it came out, and it looks even worse now. There's cartoony graphics, and then there's this.

[b]Audio:[/b]
Actually passable. The robot sound effects aren't Gen Z quality or anything, but they have that cartoony hunter vibe about them as most of the game does.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
I honestly didn't even finish it in the first place, so none.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
It was a great concept in its day, but it was never given the love or attention it needed to become a successful or entertaining title that stands on its own weight.

It‚Äôs a mixture first person shooter, survival, and moderate horror. It does an excellent job of mixing in a rather quirky backdrop and a sly touch of humor as well.

At bottom it‚Äôs a pretty simple game. You teleport to a land full of robots bent on shooting you full of holes. You have to dig through abandoned houses for weapons, ammo, food, and the like, while dogging search parties looking for your skin. All the while you have to find missing pieces for your teleporter so you can get home again. 

It has a fun dynamic of hunter and hunted, since you can easily overpower a party with a few well placed shots. But it is easy to get in over your head and bleed to death if you aren‚Äôt mindful of how many enemies you‚Äôre engaging.

And this element of keeping things balanced is what gives Sir its synergy. You run faster than the robots, you have greater intelligence, and yet, it is oh so easy to become overconfident and get killed. That balancing on a knife‚Äôs edge keeps the game compelling through multiple playthroughs, even after the game‚Äôs elements have become familiar.

Additionally, while the graphics are sufficient, the devs clearly wanted to remove any obstacle to fast paced gameplay. The result is a refreshingly light shooter that allows you to move, engage, and disengage quickly. This helps to keep the game moving, as you rummage around like a hunted dog, looking for forbidden treats.

You can also play with friends, although the game was not designed with multiplayer as a main feature, so it can feel a little uneven at times when playing with others.

To be blunt, check out some gameplay videos first this game can be super fun if you can get into it, whether you choose to play solo or with friends, this should be your first step.

Now if you do decide to play the game: It was created quite beautifully with some great concepts in mind, no game is ever the same, whether you choose to play one of the several different map types or the same favorite one, each game experience is new and unique with the procedural map generation. 

The game delivers the feeling of being trapped on an island with nowhere to go quite beautifully, in fact they did a remarkable job here.
The entire landscape area is said to be a remembrance of actual British scenery, i having never been there myself can't speak for that, but what i can say is that the game really looks amazing, and beautiful as well, a lot of creative effort and detail went into creating some beautiful visuals for us.

The combat system was done just as properly, neatly worked out and balanced properly to truly deliver a fun experience to you the gamer. The survival aspect here plays off beautifully and really fun, running and hiding from the hunters truly was made fun and challenging here.


All in all a very decent game that is worth a shot if you give it a try.

edit: just found out that this is the final version and holy shit is it a mess.
i like the concept of the game and the art style however in the state its in is really bad,for starters it drops you on the map not telling you what to do,how to play or what the objective is

in the end i found out the only objective is to bring overly large stones wich take up almost half of your inventory space just to bring them to a portal,after wich you go to the portal and start over again doing the same thing

on paper it dosnt sound that bad however the AI is such a bugy mess that lord knows how those robots even inslaved us in the first place,i played this game with a friend and tough the AI were pretty terrifing at the begining they lost all of their fear factor when they sudently just stoped moving,yes the AI were all stuck in place 5 minutes after we started the game and we didnt even notice this was a bugg until we were almost done with collectiing all portals.
And not to mention the second we got actual weapons and ammo for them we basacly could take on an army no problem

overall the AI is fun and uniqe IF you get them to work properly

wich brings me to the next problem with the game and that is the looting and the items in the game.

this is one thing i do not get,is one thing to add lootable items that dont do shit but is another to add items that are only usefull for killing yourself,becasue aparantly theres alot of em

starting off youll probably find alot of dead rats and rotten potatoes,youd think they can fill your hunger at the cost of health or have some general use but no the only purpase of those is to use them if you want to lose health and as far as i know they have no other purpase
and the inventory managment is anoyhing because you always need to add room for bigg ass  rocks wich take up almost half of your inventory space because why not right?
not to mention you cannot expand it or make chests or such for you to putt away your things for a bit no youll have to settle for what you have.

next up we have crafting wich dosnt exhist

finnaly we have the ""stealth and survival"" concept wich i say there is not much to stealth once you get a weapon and there is not much to survival if the only survival is ""remember to eat and not die""

Multiplayer is good, the netcode is solid and doesn't often cause any issues, but there's not much to do beyond ferrying pieces to the centre. The pieces spawn in predictable circles on the island, and beyond setting an arbitrarily large number of pieces to be required, there's no option for starting difficulty (it scales the more pieces have been recovered) - And the scaling can be bypassed with a classic collect them all and dump them at once.

- A little glitchy at times

It was called the Capsula and was simply the lower-half of the vehicle with the upper half being modular so you could swap out the chassis so that the vehicles could be repurposed using the right equipment. A vehicle could be a people carrier with one chassis but then have it swapped out with a new one to make it a refrigirated courier van. The idea was interesting but when you looked into it further you had to wonder why someone would want to buy the Capsula plus all of the equipment to swap the chassis when it was easier to simply by two normal vehicles. Sir has the same issue, it has some novel ideas that simply don't pan out in the long run and lead to a rather broken experience.

First if all, the stealth system is very detailed but somewhat inconsistant at times. It uses a mixture of line of sight combined with how obsured you are by foliage you may be standing/sitting in, the amount of noise you are making as you move and also the ambient light level. What it trips over with is displaying how well hidden you are with the UI indicator and the AI at times will suddenly become very ignorant to your presense. There are times when the indicator says that you are completely invisible, but a robot wanders over and because it was looking in your direction it suddenly gains the ability to notice you. Yet they'll easily walk past you in this 'invisible' state if they happen to be looking elsewhere. Or the UI says that you're making noise by splashing around in water while a bot is 2m away, but it will act like you are not there because can't see you due to something breaking line of sight yet if you did that while hiding in a bush it would suddenly see you. As you play the game you do start to understand what causes you to be noticed  or not but in all fairness that is learned through trial and error and not due to the UI.

The next issue is the vitality system. Now, I can understand why a survival element may seem like a good idea at first in a stealth game, but when there is a finite amout of food in the game you suddenly end up with a hidden time limit for you to complete your tasks. The fact that the RNG for lootdrops makes this time limit completely random is also a big problem. Dying due to poor RNG rolls in a game like this really isn't a very good experience and for a stealth game where you need patience, it isn't great to have a clock-ticking down and forcing you to run everywhere you can.

Speaking of the loot itself, rather than searching building interiors you 'search' the doors of buildings. So they become like massive storage boxes. It seems very half-hearted and frankly it jars you from any immersion the game is trying to accomplish. They also contain vast amounts of useless items which makes me wonder why they felt the need to do that when the time could be better spent elsewhere. The buildings are also one of the only places you can get any items at all which creates a vicious cycle. You need food from buildings, but they are always guarded, you can use items as distractions to lure the guards away but these are also found in buildings. You do eventually find that you can deliberately approach the the bots to cause them give chase so you can swing around to the opposite end and loot the doors but this is both time consuming, risky and not always worth the effort due to the RNG loot rolls.

In terms of concept, I love the idea of retro-robots hunting humans down across the english moorlands. It is a very original settings but as the game progresses the novelty wears off and it becomes tedious to be creeping through woodlands and across fields in one gigantic fetch quest. If you compare this with a similar game like Monstrum, the length of Sir is what works against it. Monstrum is short but brutal, it's a game where the goal is so close yet so difficult and you just know you can beat it if you give it one more shot. But the end of Sir is so distant and the challenge so random that you start to lose interest, plus if you eat all of the food on the isles before you have collected all of the items you've created an unwinnable scenario.

Sir is an interesting concept but poorly executed and not something I can recommend.",1536974316,1536974316,False,28,1,0.66024404764175415,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The overall idea of the game is executed beautifully; the robots that hunt you are both convincingly dangerous and comically British (""Good show!"" shouts a robot as you flee his shotgun barrage). As you progress, additional and more difficult enemies will spawn, i.e. terrible little robot hunting dogs, and a few others that are quite clever, but I won't spoil. At first I thought the lack of ammo was a bother, but in fact they really want you to stealth around the islands instead of making a Rambo-esque stand against your pursuers. Still, despite the low ammo availability, the guns function quite well, the shooting is satisfying, and I enjoyed the vintage feel the weapons have (the shotgun is fuckin' beautiful to look at). The best mechanic in the game by far is the ability to draw the robots away using the many tricks at your disposal; easy examples being if you light a fire to cook, they see it for miles around and charge you, or if you find an alarm clock you can set it and flee, and when it goes off they will be drawn to it.

Overall, challenging and fun, creative and at least a little unique. Very well executed idea, even if slightly light on content. Runs very smoothly. You could say its just what it says on the tin!

Multiplayer was obviously thrown in at the last second; I played through with a friend, and it was, to be blunt, bad.

If you were to die, your body would just disappear, along with all the items that you happened to have on you, so there was no chance for you or your friends to pick up the items. On top of that, you rarely found them, but why would you want to, anyway? That would just mean you could cover less ground as you got bored searching for those last few colourful rocks.

As much as I like what Big Robot is trying to do, I cannot recommend this game.

At first appearances, I thought it would be my type of game. Slowly exploring a beautiful computer generated landscape, while collecting survival gear, and avoiding scifi-style robots. Then, I realized that the gameplay is entirely built upon dealing with robots camping on your treasure. Rather than hiding from robots, you must confront them, with some of the crappiest tools.

You can distract them, but they will see you running behind them. You can shoot them, but they can out-gun you and move in groups. So, you end up dying over and over, which means running all the way from the last dreary savepoint. I am sure eventually you can master the technique required for distracting and crawling, but that whole process is irritating and not something that I enjoy learning. For this vital aspect of the game, the game does a pretty terrible job showing the game mechanics of detection.

Then, there's the terrain that initially looks great, but then you get trapped in your twentith hedgerow square. There's no jump in the game, so you have got to run along the hedgerow, looking for a gap, only to discover the only exit to the square is the gap where you entered it. I ran into these giant cul-de-sacs more often than not, especially at night, when I could hardly see anything.

In opposite it lacks of gameplay. I'm not a survival lover but here the gameplay is very poor. You have to search for stones and take them to a monolith. Houses cannot be explored and provide a menu of unuseful objects. 
Stealth gameplay is also poor. You can crouch and throw bottles to elude enemies, but there is nothing more.
Survival is also poor. If you use a campfire in a few seconds you are surrounded by enemies and you can only run. Where? To the opposite direction.

For example there could be some npc that could sell something or say something or add some quests... But no. There are only stones and a monolith and enemies.

I , at this point, would have appreciated just a walking and eating sim. Just to see the skylines and the hurban industrialized amusing towns.

Le armi da fuoco ci sono, la scarsit√† di proiettili per le stesse pure, cos√¨ come √® presente anche la necessit√† di nutrirsi (pena una terribile fine fra stenti), rendendo l'aspetto survival molto importante. Ma il gioco punta tutto sullo stealth, tant'√® che a fine gioco il riepilogo della partita classificher√† le nostre prestazioni basandosi praticamente solo su quante volte siamo stati visti dai robot, nostri nemici agguerriti.
Lo scopo del gioco √® quello di recuperare 15 frammenti sparsi su 5 isole diverse, mentre un nutrito e disparato gruppo di robot ci daranno la caccia, proprio come se fossimo una povera volpe durante una battuta. Data la bassa quantit√† di munizioni che troveremo nella mappa, la tattica migliore sar√† sempre quella di optare per piccoli diversivi, come una bottiglia lanciata da dietro una siepe, attirare i nemici su tagliole piazzate ad hoc per metterli fuori combattimento e simili. Il gioco, grazie alla vena survival che lascia il giocatore spesso alle strette, ma anche grazie all'ambientazione piuttosto tetra, riesce a trasmettere sensazioni degne di un horror (ma proprio leggero eh, se sono riuscito a giocarlo io non avrete alcun problema a farlo voi, ve lo assicuro).
Il gameplay funziona bene. L'IA √® adatta allo scopo, pur seguendo dei pattern piuttosto semplici. Purtroppo il gioco risulta fin troppo facile, in particolare grazie ad alcune piccole strategie che non sveler√≤ per non rovinare il gioco a nessuno (nonostante le strategie adottate ho ottenuto il rango stealth pi√π basso sia chiaro, ma non ho pazienza con gli stealth e come vedevo un'apertura possibile mi lanciavo urlando con la doppietta in mano!).
Tecnicamente il gioco √® molto semplice, anzi anche troppo scialbo, soprattutto nel comparto texture, davvero troppo semplici. Anche il comparto sonoro non √® per niente memorabile.
Una partita mi √® durata circa 3 ore e mezzo, i mondi sono generati casualmente quindi sempre diversi (anche se poi alla fine le differenze sembrerebbero solo marginali e in 3 ore credo si sia visto gran parte del gioco).

I do understand its not for everyone though and I agree on some of the reasons mentioned in the other reviews. The negative points that are brought up are that the game was abandonned and doesnt feel finished, and I do agree on both in a way. For example the multiplayer doesnt work (last time I tried it) and walking around on the islands feels like theres a lot of space you pass through espcially at the shores of the islands, where theres nothing happening in those areas. So to get some action you have to be in the more central regions of the islands but the more empty ones on the outskirts still exist. On the other hand that gives you a place to run which otherwise you might not have had. But it still feels a bit big and empty in those areas. 
Another point is that variety of ways you play the game such as for example the amount of items there are and the ones you actually use (there are some that dont have a use as far as I understood) doesnt feel too big, once you kind of get the hang of the game. I, at least, will probably always use similar strategies since there arent that many different ones to chose from. However i could be wrong about that.

Now but since this is a positive review lets get to the good parts:
I really like the feeling the game gives you of really being hunted and that you have to be careful while really looking for your way to escape. The brittish setting is also nice. Walking around on the islands really made me feel like I was in England and it was a beautiful nature if you can call it that. Also a changing day and night rhythm makes things more interesting and beautiful (surise i.e.).
Another bonus that I discovered just now again, after completing the game, is that each time you start a new game, a new map will be generated and I suppose the objects you're looking for in game will also be distributed differently accross the islands (yes thers more than one island that you can travel between, wich is another bonus point imo). So that all gives it a replayability value since no game will be exactly like another. Additionally to this you can also choose the type of biome that islands will have, and you can adjust how many of which robot types will be hunting you how quickly, so you can determine the difficulty of the game. That gives you the opportunity to for example play a casual runthrough, or make it a really hard achallenge that you'll have to spend hours on to complete.

So to sum it up there are negative parts to it and I am sad too that many people dont like to play it anymore because of those, but its also a game that is entertaining to play and that you  can spend a few relaxed (or not so relaxed once youre spotted or you have to sneak up close to a danger) hours with. I do recommend you buy it on sale since the normal price is too high, but I myself really just enjoyed the game even though it has its problems and/or flaws too. Hence I'm giving a thumbs up and am happy about everyone else who tries the game and likes it too :)",1521511454,1521511454,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you like stealth action games where you have to take down enemies without being discovered lest you be hunted by adversaries with fantastic aim en masse, this game will entertain you. Resource/inventory management is a must. This game will allow you to make huge mistakes and laugh in your face as you fail. It is not a casual type experience by any means, so if you are looking for a puts around good feels game stick to something like Snake Pass for now. This game will punish your mistakes, and it only gets harder as you get deeper into a run. Day after day growing harder until you win or die.

It's not the theme that is scary in this survival horror, it's the feeling of having a match weighed heavily in the NPC's favor. It's a vulerability you have no matter how skilled you are, and it keeps you thinking about a better way to complete your objectives. It keeps you working to stay alive. Mocking you all the while.

Get it. Play it. Love it. Bring a friend for multiplayer.

2) ...have a fetish for tweed?

3) ...have the patience for a slow, challenging stealth game?

4) ...feel fine with muddy graphics?

5) ...enjoy a quirky sense of humour?

Brilliant concept and extremely fun. Only problem is that the multiplayer, unless done with friends, is a complete ****-fest with idiots who think it's PUBG. First multiplayer game, I spent 25 minutes alive. Got lucky and managed to get a shotgun, map, and even the scanner to help the team out. Figured I'd hunt down as many pieces as I could. I ended up finding and returning 6 of the 10 pieces, myself. All 5x5. So I made several trips. On the map, I marked the last 2, so I could run and grab them at the last stone activation. Ended up being chased down by a player (not robot) and gunned down as I grabbed the last piece. When I typed, ""Why?"" in the chat, I was pleasantly given a: ""Cuz suk my dick"". Then decided that it was fine and I would just head to the portal and we would win, end of game, right? NOPE. Got to the portal after bolting through an army of different types of robots and dogs and was again, gunned down by my own players. After I again, respawned, it occured to me that the server was being modded/hacked anyways. I suddenly had an inventory opened up full of rifle ammo and a rifle with some rags (for bandages) and a bunch of booze (for vitality) and when I attempted to equip the rifle, it kept cancelling it out on me. Like I wasn't meant to equip the weapon. Meaning the game was preventing me from using a ""not-quite-earned"" weapon.

Billed as a humorous, ""relentlessly British"" survival stealth game that boasts ""infinite replayability,"" but I found the amount of content sorely lacking in all of those areas:

[list]
[*] Humor: Unless you find the visual of robots dressed in British hunting garb inherantly funny, there's no humor here (and even if you do, that's at best a one note joke that must lose its appeal by the 4th or 5th robot you see). (I played in multiplayer, and this did not seem to include the promised ""disembodied voice of Walters, your butler,"" at all. I'm guessing maybe that's where the humor is supposed to come from. If that's the case, maybe there is some humor, but it's a single-player-only feature? If so, that's disappointing for those of us who purchased to take advantage of the recently announced co-op mode.)
[*] Britishness: I suppose the clothing style and a few of the food items (haggis, tea, etc.) are British themed, but beyond that there was no personality to this game whatsoever, British or otherwise. (Again, at least not in multiplayer.)
[*] Survival: The survival mechanics begin and end with looting food from containers and then eating it. Some of the containers look like barrels, others look like houses, but you can't enter any of the buildings, so they're effectively just giant barrels. There's no hunting, crafting, or anything else you might find in other survival games.
[*] Stealth: Since the game puts you on a wide open island where you can see enemies coming from a ways off, and enemies are scattered few and far between, the stealth manages to be both too easy ‚Äì just keep your distance from enemies ‚Äì and too hard ‚Äî if an enemy does get close enough to see you, there's often nowhere to hide. To be fair, this seems like the most developed aspect of the game, with a visibility meter that adjusts based on your movement speed, and various patches of grass and bushes that supposedly decrease your visibility. I even had one close call that provided a brief moment of tension. There's some potential there, but the game's overall design just doesn't do enough to leverage the stealth mechanics. If there had been a lot more moments of tension and a lot fewer of running aimlessly through the woods trying to find something to do, my recommendation might be different.
[*] Replayability: The 90 minutes plus that I played seemed to be enough to see everything the game has to offer and then get bored with it. I've read there are actually a few other biomes and robot types that I didn't get to see, but if the gameplay is still fundamentally the same in those areas, I don't feel like I really missed anything. Don't get me wrong, there were some fun moments, but replay value? I don't think so. The game is so repetitive that I was bored before I even played through it once.
[/list]

Basically, the game consists of wandering aimlessly around a mostly empty island, easily keeping your distance from enemies while looting containers. When you happen to stumble across a ""mysterious fragment,"" you take it back to a centrally located special stone to trade it in for a point. Repeat until you have enough points to win. That's it. That's literally the entire game.

Although I do find it quite off putting that the population of the many surrounding towns have up and left! I do hope they don't mind if I knick a few of their belongings, there is a group of robots chasing me after all! Its almost as if I am being hunted!

That being said, it was a terribly boring hour at that. The game seems very bare-bones, and randomly generated to very poor effect. 

I spent about 40 minutes walking around from one objective to the next. The objective being to pick up items and return them to the starting position. 
The other 10-15 minutes I spent in observation that the enemies in this game provide no notable threat whatsoever. They at no point were near my objectives, and were so sparsely present near lootable buildings, they were easily avoided while I could collect an inventory full of loot, such that I needed not be near enemies at all after a few minutes into the game. Nor did I find any intrigue in engaging with them, since your tactical options for doing so are limited and uninteresting.

If you find slenderman envigorating, it's possible you may enjoy this experience; If you do not, then you will likely find this game boring and easy, as I did.

Many say the game is abandoned or incomplete.  Some say they bought years ago and feel ripped off because it is no longer being updated.  I only recently bought the game and 5.5 hours in, I feel like I'm playing a fully developed, complete, and polished game.  More than all that, it is also a rather fun and engaging game.  

I didn't follow devolpment, so maybe I'm unaware of unfulfilled promises from the developer, but I can't really imagine what people feel is missing from the game.   I suppose more robot types could be added, but I've already encountered quiete a few different ones, all with different traits and behaviors.  I don't think I've even encountered all of them.  I find their hunting AI to be very good.  They actually hunt you the way an Englishman would hunt a fox.  When they spot me or I draw attention to myself, they put ot a pretty decent dragnet in the area and I can't always get away.

I find the proceedural generation of the islands to be solid.  A convincing, English countryside with lots of interesting terrain to consider.  Over time you come to know the various copses of trees that you use to travel through.  some reviews complain about how easy it is to get lost while simultaneously complaining about lack of depts--but a lot of the games depth comes from navigating the land, finding your way around, using the landmarks such as those weird towers to orient yourself, and finding good routs to get around without getting detected.

Lot of complaints about not being able to go in buildings.  Honestly, the game would get very tedious if you had to go in each building and click on some drawers and cabinets to find a few scraps of food.   That level of looting gameplay is just not necesarry in a game that isn't about loot.  If you could go into the buildings, then the robots would have to go into buildings to look for you, taking them out of their field searches--which is the whole point of this game--being hunted across English Country side like a fox.  If you could go into the buildings, you would spend tons of time hiding inside of buildings, which would also get boring.  Its fun to sneak around the alleys and buildings of the hamlets--I'm glad I don't have to spend 15 minutes going in and searching 6 buildings everytime I encounter a hamlet.

Sound is great.   The robots make all these computer bleeps and boops that sound like something out of an creepy, 70s sci-fi movie.  Its actually kind of ominous, when youre hiding behind a building, and a robot is coming your way.  You get nervous as those bleeeps and bloops get louder, and you know he's probably going to come around that corner at any minute.  The game is actually very atmospheric, with an ominous sense of dread haning over everything that I wasn't at all expecting from this game when I bought it.  I thought it was just going to be a funny tone (and it is funny) but its also a little dark and ominous.  

At 5.5 hours, so far, I love it.  I feel like I'm really just now digging into the meat of the game--learning the lay of the land, developing competence at foraging, finding meteorites, and avoiding/destroying robots.   It has lots of content, and the proceeduring generation of everything ensures that new, unthought of tactical situations appear all the time.  Last time I played, I got spotted and ended up finding myself between two hunting parties with a variety of robot types.  I vanished into a ditch in a copse of trees, and the robots were hunting all around, but hadn't found me.  Then that balloon started drifting my way.  I have watched that thing hunt the island for hours, but this time, it actually happened to come my way.  All I could do was lay still and hope the search beam didn;t hit me.  When it hit me, the alarm went off, my hiding place was revealed, and I had to make a quick decision about how to flee. 

These are the elements of good gameplay.

I got it on sale for $5.  I guess $20 is a little steep, but this is a high-quality, complete, and fun game.  I just don't think $20 is really that far off the mark.  If you see it for $15 or less, I suggest you go for it, and if you like stealth/survival/proceedurally generated games, I say go for it at $20

I'm giving this one a solid thumbs up.",1508583329,1508583329,True,51,1,0.829668164253234863,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Graphics: this game REALLY ugly. Not that it needs to be super realistic, but doesn't even have a style. Lots of grey, blurred textures. You can barely distinguish anything.

Gameplay: absurdly BORING. A big map full of NOTHING. Oh, but you can LOOT HOUSES! Why bother making into a proper building, where you can enter, explore and hide? Oh no, this is just too much! You die, lose everything and there you go, in a random spot on the map, completely lost, your friends nowhere to be seen. Did I mention on how easy do you get lost? Since everything blends into the scenario, The gunplay is so awful that it makes the difficult seem completely artificial.

Audio: no ambience, no music. Just some noises from robots from far away, sometimes near, that's it. By this point, I don't even care anymore.

This is one of my favourite stealth games, without a doubt. It gets all the basics of good stealth gameplay down pretty well, for sure. It also gives you an incentive to choose stealth, as ammo is scarce and fights can easily turn against you even when you have enough ammo through dogs or traps that immobilise you. One of my absolute favourite aspects of this game is the atmosphere, it's moody and just slightly oppressive while still being beautiful despite the game's presumptive lack of graphics budget. The game is also extremely immerssive, as any first-person stealth game worth its salt should be. I find myself checking my ""visibility meter"" and listening for the chattering of robots sometimes when I zone out at work. Speaking of the robot chatter, this game has a good sense of humour without it becoming TOO present so that the game is still taken very seriously. I adore this game, and my only notably negative note is that the game's updating days are almost certainly over. Big Robot, if you read this, I will buy up to five copies for five friends.

Sound is more of a mixed bag. The voice effects are entertaining through and through, and distinct enough that you can quickly tell who is in an area and what they might be doing at that moment. At other times though, I hear rustling grass as  proceed over a stone bridge, or no sound at all in the water. It brings you out of ""the moment"". I quite enjoy the spooky narrator though, and the music always fits.

Gameplay wise... it turned into a slog by the time I had finished my first three (of five) islands. I didn't try more than one character, but there doesn't seem to be much to gameplay besides avoid-avoid-avoid, which basically means to move slowly in crouch position. Attack is naturally limited because, well, you're the one being hunted, but it would have really helped the game to have a few other creative ways of eliminating the danger of the robots. I managed to get every collectible piece of my matter transmogri-whatever by using glass bottles, alarm clocks, and toy trains. None of them felt all that different.

If it's $9.99 or lower and you live these open-world survival games, give it a try. Unless something truly great is $9.99, then buy that.

To me, that's not even ""videogame/fantasy"" realism.

When you hide in the woods, and it doesn't work, there's something wrong with the game. I did this 20 seconds after starting at the stone and they were all over me and i walked in a crouching position after hitting the wooded area.

I'm good at stealth, i use it in every FPS game i play, so i know how to make it work for me. But for them to find me just out of nowhere....this game needs LOTS of work.

Also the game re-assignment controls don't acknowledge MOUSE2, which tells me they haven't perfected the keyboard reassignment either.

El dise√±o de los enemigos, la idea de tener que huir y tener cuidado para que no te cacen, mientras poco a poco rapi√±as lo que puedes para sobrevivir y defenderte, manteniendote en tension constante, es algo que no he visto en otros muchos ""survivals""

Sin embargo, me encuentro con un juego vacio, digno de un Early Acces a recien estrenar. La jugabilidad es repepetitiva y aburrida, simplemente tienes que caminar, recoger piedras y esconderte (Slender, eres t√∫?), solo he visto 2 enemigos (los cazadores y los globos) y la mayoria del tiempo me veo caminando sin muy bien que hacer.

El sistema de objetos, a pesar de tener gesti√≥n de huecos como los de muchos RPG (me record√≥ mucho a Diablo 2), es un poco inutil, ya que la mayoria de las cosas que encontraras seran basuras que no sirven para nada, literalmente

Me gusta como funciona el sigilo (con una combinaci√≥n de visibilidad y ruido muy mostrado en el HUD), que tiene en cuenta la luz que hay; sin embargo, la IA simplemente correr√° detr√°s tuya sin hacer otra cosa m√°s que disparar, lo cual ahoga mucho la sensaci√≥n de estar en una cacer√≠a a gran escala.

Por √∫ltimo, el mapa tambi√©n es terrible, mon√≥tono a m√°s no poder: Casas por aqu√≠ y all√≠ para conseguir objetos, piedras, arboles y algun que otro edificio en ruinas, y las malditas piedras. Preparate para estar viendo la misma gama de colores continuamente.

En f√≠n, cuando descubr√≠ este juego me emocion√© mucho por la idea, pero despu√©s del jarro de agua fria que ha sido, solo queda esperar al improbable caso de que los desarrolladores vuelvan a trabajar en √©l. El lado bueno es que al menos lo compre en un Humble Bundle, y no gast√© los absurdos 20 euros que cuesta.

PD: El audio 5.1 no funciona, empeorando as√≠ uno de los factores clave en este tipo de juegos.",1504543256,1504543256,False,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Any remark suggesting the AI is interesting is a lie, the gameplay is extremely bare bones. 
You walk around an island avoiding enemies, collecting some stones, and then after collecting all the magic stones, you're rewarded with a ""cut scene"" in which the camera shakes and your character disappears. 

There is very little content to the game, and absolutely no reason to play it for more than 30 minutes. The devs have long since abandoned it, with the last update being some time in 2015.

A procedurally-generated FPS survival game where you have to collect items to stage an escape from an island full of murderous robots and hunters. Great fun, and decent A.I. Good luck, sir!
[/quote]
[h1]Summary[/h1]
[quote]
[h1]A great game, packed with atomsphere and real tension. The island is not too big so the strategy remains tight and often bloody.[/h1]
Pros:
- atmospheric, challenging world
- grim and unrelenting survival
- some cool RPG options

Cons:
- while a threat, you can often just run away far too often - though ultimately you must fight!
- not sure if still supported

[h1]PROS[/h1]
[*] You start with items
[*] Life-restoring items are not hard to find
[*] The enemies can be a treat to you (and not easy to avoid once they spotted you)
[*] Brittish steampunk to stile to feel just in the right time (not too in the futore nor in the past
[*] You can choose you class before starting the game (and get different items for ach class).


[h1] CONS[/h1]
[*] Enemies hard to kill with basic weapons
[*] Not crafting included, meaning most items are useless
[*] Cannot build your own fortess, so you will survirve in the grass
[*] Enemies have too much of good aim so in close encounters they will mostly win (and kill you)
[*] Enemies deal a lot of damage and follow you, so it will be hard at the begining to heal you wounds.

First, the score [(5X2) - 5= 5] .

(Of course, I am not forgetting Karate Kid 2014, starring Jaiden Smith, but it does not feature Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi), except for when they CGI-ed Jackie Chan's entire body over Pat's. ) What most folks fail to realize, is that there is A SECRET INSTALLMENT TO THE KARATE KID CINEMATIC UNIVERSE (TKKCU). This, obviously, is Karate Dog (2005), Pat Morita reprizes his role of Mr. Miyagui, thus confirming this movie to be in the TKKCU (THE KARATE KID CINEMATIC UNIVERSE). Finally giving us the long sought after ending we ALL needed for these good, sweaty, jumping, Karate boys. Or is it‚Ä¶.?

Sidebar, on the cover of the Karate Dog box art, what can only be described as a police officer's badge is being held in what I assume to be the main protagonist‚Äôs paw. IS THIS DOG A COP? DOES HE DO LEGAL KARATE?? WHAT THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• IS GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE? Wait, JOHN ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING VOIGHT is in THIS? WHY?? This movie, Karate Dog, is also directed by Bob Clark (not to be confused with the popular slithery snake man [www.bobclark.com]). The Bob Clark, the director of a Christmas Story, and the remaster of that movie, Black Christmas, oh, and also, The Baby Genius SAGA. John Voight is also in the Baby Genius SAGA (1 & 2), obviously John Voight owes some unknown life debt to Bob Clark! Why is he paying it these works of‚Äî in my eyes ‚Äî art. End Sidebar.

Pat Morita is dead, however, he is credited for FOURTEEN FILMS, after his ‚Äútotally real death‚Äù. Now, if you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre wondering, what about Ralph Machio, The Mythological Karate Kid? Is he dead? I don‚Äôt know. What I do know, is that Pat Morita is a liar (R.I.P Pat Morita 1932‚Äî2005??). Now the running theory between me, and the other eleven TKKCU Truthers AKA the Thirteen MoritApostles is that he is working on a secret sixth Karate Kid. However, they could not do this because, JACKIE CHAN FORCED THE KARATE CHILD INDUSTRY INTO CGI-ING HIMSELF OVER PAT MORITA. Meaning, that the Pat Morita, is jealous, and he wants, no, needs, this final episode to the TKKCU, and attempted it with Karate Dog, but to no avail. But this movie is tainted with John Voight‚Äôs dirty dirty life debt, and that he hates Karate and Christmas, ruining Black Christmas and Karate Dog (originally titled Karate Doggy). 

John Voight, Baby Genius? Lets call him what he is: baby Hitler. And his hate for babies, extends to kids, which is why he hates the TKKCU (THE KARATE KID CINEMATIC UNIVERSE). And let his best friend, Jackie Chan, former baby, ruin Karate Kid 2014. And killed Pat Morita, which is why THE KARATE KID CINEMATIC UNIVERSE (TKKCU), will eventually get that sweet good good conclusion juice, that I need to slather on myself. John Voight we‚Äôve got your lie.

Oh, and uh, it was an alright game. I was busy though.

To be sure, it's not always a high-octane experience - there is a lot of walking across barren, quasi-British countryside (looks more like Suffolk than anywhere else). You'll spend a fair amount of time alone, poking around deserted villages. However, I happen to enjoy that kind of atmosphere - and there's plenty of atmosphere.

When things do get dicey though, they really do. While you might stand a fair chance vs 1 or even 2 robots if you've found weaponry enough, more than that and you're taking your life in your hands. The robots are not at all easy to escape once they've got a bead on you and if you do manage to escape them by crawling through a wheat field and then sprinting through some woods you'll really feel like you earned it, not that you just outwitted a dull AI.

So it's much like war - long periods of quiet boringness (which actually really sets up the mood) with sudden bursts of frantic activity. Often you'll find yourself gazing through your binoculars at a collectible guarded by robots, trying to fathom out the best way to outwit or destroy them. You certainly won't succeed by just charging in.

To have any hope of success you'll really need to find the device that detects nearby pieces - you can start with this by default if you choose the right character mode. If you don't, it'll be very hard going until you do. I played this game a lot before that particular feature was added in and the dectector improved the game exponentially. Before that it was perfectly possible to walk right by a piece and miss it, despite the tell-tale smoke and you could spend hours scouring the same island trying to find it.

Not one for you if you're seeking constant thrills then, but if you're feeling like playing a slow-burning and rewarding experience this is an excellent choice.

What a beautiful way to spend the day. Running in the wide open England countryside. Open fields, birds flying, oh and of course the robotic gentlemen set on turning your head into a trophy. Sir you are being hunted, created by Big Robot Ltd. It combines the tense gameplay of survival games with a cartoon like animated look makes quite a fun combination jumping from humor to horror. The premise is given by your butler Mr.Walters telling the player that the experiment has gone wrong  and you're stuck on the archipelago and that you must collect pieces of the device and bring them back to the standing stones which is where the player spawns in order to return home for dinner and that's all the story you get. Before beginning the game there are options to be chosen before starting your play through. The games starts with your selection of playing as Sir, or Madam purely an aesthetic choice affecting nothing but the dialog spoken to you by Mr.Walters. Once you start a new game then the player chooses their ""profession"" which is their starting loadout and the choice entirely depends on how difficult you want the game to be. Aristocrat is the default choice and begins your game with no equipment except for some rags and is the ideal choice for players looking for a challenge. Other options vary your equipment greatly such as the inventor loadout which has a scanner which can be used to locate device pieces and Officer loadout which gives the player a revolver and rifle right from the start. Once that's done then the player will be allowed to customize their world by choosing the setting of the other 4 islands you will be going through. The center island at the start of the game will also be the same rural setting every time which are large fields, forests, and small groups of houses but the other 4 islands you'll be visiting can have there biomes changed to Castle- fields with castle ruins that can be used for cover, Industrial- large structures and much more housing making it ripe for finding items but can many more robots walking around , Fens- marshlands with canals and plenty of tall grass to hide in., and Mountains- Massive forests and very large hills with plenty of space to keep away from robots but also few homes. From there the difficulty can be left at the default which does increase over time and based on the progress the player makes but can be adjusted at the start to suit your play style whether you want a casual run or a nerve wracking one. Your mission is to collect all 17 pieces of the device and return them to the center island to the standing stones. They'll be spread all over the 5 islands and your inventory menu will allow you to keep track of how many pieces remain on which islands and how many total you've returned. The only thing giving away their position is the smoke rising from their craters. Also now and again you'll see strange floating sprites going across the landscape to the device pieces and they'll serve as a guide you may see only one or as many as 5 at a given time so it's definitely worth keeping an eye out for them. Once you've spawned in you'll receive some basic instruction of how to play but for the most part the player must figure out how this world works on their own. That is a very poor aspect of the game for various reasons one, in regard to the various enemies that'll be faced of which there are plenty you get no information on them so when the player comes across a new foe they'll be unsure of how to face them and the only way to know is to go head to head with them which is not something you should be doing in a survival game. Speaking of the hunters which are the very first enemy encountered is the most basic and will be most often seen thin, looking dapper and carrying shotguns these machines will be your most common foe. They'll be patrolling the islands usually one or two will be guarding a device piece and they can even roam in packs they have an almost random behavior so it can be tough to tell where one can be moving next or when it'll turn around. Beyond just movement they're random with their behavior with each other  interacting with themselves in random ways sometimes they'll have a short conversation about taxes or show each  other some trophies they may also argue and fight other groups until one side is dead. The way the player will approach these machines will entirely depend on what's present in their inventory if the player has rocks and bottles they can toss them to cause a distraction. If they have weapons they can sneak in close and try to take them on with a hatchet or shotgun. If the player has nothing to use then they may employ a slow stealth approach to avoid being spotted or if they're desperate they can sprint past them and hope they don't land any shots. The way your spotted is dependent on your level of visibility shown on the bottom left corner of your screen if you're running through an open field it'll be pretty easy for the robots to see but if you're crouched in some tall grass unmoving then you're practically invisible. Should the player be damaged in anyway your health will recover slowly provided you have a decent amount of vitality which you keep maintained by constantly eating food that you find in the environment such as mints, cured ham, and a jar marmalade. Scavenging is another big part of the game besides the starting equipment which the player may or may not have scouting structures will be the primary source of where you'll get resources from. Any home or building with doors can be scavenged just go to any door and you can interact with it in order to find supplies none of the doors open so buildings are inaccessible. However each door you go to will have a different set of items so be sure to circle around a house and go to every door to try and find valuables which can be difficult since the drop rate on good items is quite low so trash items will be commonly seen in most places. All the items in game fall into four categories Useful, equipable, dubious, and junk the first two will be the category of food items, tools and weapons. Dubious items are items they may have use or may be harmful to you and junk items are just trash and serve no purpose and should never be in your inventory.

This game is so unique that I had a hard time pin-pointing what this game does well.

Sir is a survival stealth game. Your task is to gather all teleporter pieces from five island and gather them into one place. The longer the time passes or the more teleporter pieces you collect, the more foes you will encounter.

First off, I ADORE the soundtrack and the visual design. If it was a war game, it would be boring as hell, but because it goes for highly exaggerated world that looks like other people think Britain looks like it's suprisingly solid. It's great, atmospheric and overall good design. However if you don't like depressing grim colors for 2 hours of gameplay on one save, this isn't the game for you, cause it might look dull to some (this comes from a guy who plays cute games with tons of colours.)

The stealth in this game is very solid. If you get out from a predicament somehow, it really feels like it was your doing. The game is punishing, but just enough that you don't want to give up. Each hour of gameplay gives you more to work with.

There are two features that were a real lifesaver for me. Custom world generation and Multiplayer! With the first one, you can create much more interesting worlds with more decorations and stuff than the default generators, however you need to be quite careful with sliders. The second feature is hit or miss. There aren't many servers (but I host one in my free time), so you might not encounter as many players. If you do, you're in for a great ride. Basically you have to escape the island competing with other players in doing the same. There's PvP, loot and trading! Find a friend, have a battle or form an alliance.

What are the flaws? This game feels a bit incomplete, but every now and then I encounter a new item that got me really excited thanks to custom world generation. For some reason the default one isn't so generous with them. When I found a Thingometer and a Mysterious Talisman, they really enchanced the game.

World generation can be really poor too. Unless you're playing on custom generated worlds, they might be really boring. I would like this game to support modding, so I can add more structures to spawn, more items to create and more enemies to fight! I'm a modder type of guy.

Set up a server, be patient and you'll be rewarded for it. However for the standard price it's not worth it. I would wait for a sale below -50% to really make it worth your money.",1498917115,1499190732,True,7,0,0.57235419750213623,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But I let it sleep in my library for a long time after I had played it and stopped after getting shot for the first time. I can¬¥t remember why I was so mad but maybe it was the right reaction to the game¬¥s structure. In 'Sir, You Are Being Hunted' you are to choose between these classes at the beginning: 'The Aristocrat' , 'The Gamekeeper', 'The Inventor',' The Officer', 'The Cook' , 'The Artist' and 'The Old Soak'. All these classes differ in terms of equipment but as far as I know don¬¥t change anything else (I only tried The Officer so don¬¥t believe me here).  After that you are introduced to the game you are going to play if you are willing to. You are told to find meteorites to start a Stonehenge-like machine which is located on the central island and the only way to complete the game at the same time. There are 17 of these stones (which is a weird number to me). You are to find them on 5 islands (central, North, South, East and West). While finding them you are hunted by robots. Everything is embellished with great British Humor. At the same time you have to take care of your Vitality but Health and Visibility too. From time to time you will be realizing that there are different categories of items which might be amusing you. Some are just junk, some are useful and others are something between junk and useful (can¬¥t describe them). At the beginning robots might feel like something rare. But the more meteorites you collect the more robots spawn and the more difficult it gets. What problems does that have? Well‚Ä¶at the beginning running away is quite easy but the stealth genre is felt more and more from time to time. The difficulty is how not to be seen or heard: robots seem to be spawning next to you and can detect you even if they are far away and should not. But their detection area is really unstable and is nothing that you can trust.  The movement is really fine and the options are easy to understand. So is the navigation. The next to talk about are the graphics. They are not good‚Ä¶well that is still a polite way of describing them. I took a screenshot that shows a sunset or sunrise (not sure anymore). This is still the best you can find but not what you¬¥d expect as beautiful for a game of 2013.  One thing I almost forgot, the mutliplayer mode is not working at all. However these reasons still would not make deny a recommendation for that game. To sum it up I actually liked playing it. But 20‚Ç¨ as a price for a game that can be completed within 5 hours? [B]Just: no way![/b]

De eerste keer dat je achterna wordt gezeten door de moordlustige robots en je tenauwernood kunt ontkomen, zul je niet gauw vergeten. Jammer genoeg wordt het spel al snel repetitief. Er zijn een aantal problemen die ervoor zorgen dat ik het spel niet kan aanbevelen:
- te weinig mogelijkheden om te sluipen door willekeurige plaatsing van voorwerpen in de spelwereld
- te weinig nuttige voorwerpen in de gebouwen die je onderzoekt 
- managen van je inventaris is erg jaren 90 en niet leuk, biedt geen meerwaarde
- je kunt gebouwen niet in gaan, schuilen of op krachten komen is dus niet mogelijk
- te weinig verhaal, te weinig systemen om de speler te boeien
Het spel bestaat uit het verzamelen van stukken van een obelisk, deze stukken naar de restanten van de obelisk brengen, zodat deze wordt hersteld en een poort opent naar het volgende eiland. Tijdens de zoektocht naar de stukken van de obelisk wordt je gehinderd door zwaar bewapende robots die het eiland bewaken en je aanvallen als ze je zien of horen. Je kunt bij de start van het spel kiezen uit verschillende personages, ieder met een beperkt aantal voorwerpen in zijn of haar inventaris. Er zijn voorwerpen waarmee je de robots tijdelijk kunt afleiden (kookwekker), voorwerpen waarmee je een beetje gezondheid kunt herstellen (voedsel) en wapens waarmee je je kunt verdedigen. Maar de nadruk ligt op sluipen, niet op schieten. Jammer genoeg worden de eilanden waarop het spel zich afspeelt willekeurig gegenereerd (je kunt een aantal variabelen instellen, zoals de hoeveelheid bomen, huizen enz.). Hierdoor ontstaan er grote open vlaktes waar je onherroepelijk wordt gezien en muren en hagen waarachter je je kunt verstoppen op plekken dat je er niets aan hebt. Dat maakt het soms bijna onmogelijk om ongezien langs de robots te komen. Als je eindelijk een paar verlaten huizen hebt ontdekt, komt de volgende teleurstelling. Huizen zijn er slechts voor de show, het zijn in feite grote voorraadkasten. Maar dan wel lege voorraadkasten. Want in de meeste gebouwen vind je niets dan een dode rat en beschimmeld brood. Ik snap best dat de ontwikkelaars het spel niet te eenvoudig wilden maken, maar dit is het andere uiterste. Na anderhalf uur spelen is het heel normaal dat je misschien twee dozijn gebouwen bent tegengekomen en daarbij slechts een handvol (hooguit vijf) nuttige voorwerpen hebt gevonden. Dat maakt je opties om robots af te leiden of aan te vallen nog kleiner dan ze al waren. Na twee uur spelen had ik het dan ook gezien met dit spel. Als er meer mogelijkheden waren geweest om je te verschuilen en je meer nuttige voorwerpen tot je beschikking had om de robots mee af te leiden, was het nog een interessant spel geweest. Maar een sluipspel zonder iets om je achter of in te verstoppen en zonder voldoende voorwerpen waarmee je je tegenstanders om de tuin kunt leiden, is gewoon niet leuk.",1495547290,1495547290,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm not one to bash a game, but this game is not that great. It has a great concept, but it's pretty boring overall. It took me 7 hours to beat, and for probably 3-4 of those hours there was almost literally nothing happening. I was just wandering around looking for the items needed to progress and not finding them while completely avoiding enemy patrols (there's no reason to go anywhere near them and they are very easy to avoid). When you are forced into a confrontation, such as needing to deal with guards around an object you need, you simply distract them with an alarm clock or a wind up toy, then walk up and grab what you need. Or later, if you find weapons, you can just kill them with no problem at all. You can also escape from enemy patrols by simply running away. Once I figured this out, I would just run constantly; it didn't even matter anymore if I was seen.

The objects you need to find to complete the scenario are really hard to find... until you realize there are a few ways to see where they are, and then you don't have to do any exploring at all, you just walk straight over to them. Several of the islands I explored took me 90 mins. to 2 hours to complete, but once I realized a good way to find the objects you need, I completed the last two islands in like 15 mins. each, which was very anticlimatic. I didn't explore those islands at all...

There are a few good moments here and there, like a chuckle from the writing, encountering new and creepy enemies, and a few tense standoffs with enemies, but the sheer amount of hours where nothing at all is happening really drag things down, as do the anti-climatic encounters with easily killed, tricked, or out ran guards. I heard that the devs worked hard on the sound design, and that does show in the sound effects. Pretty unsatisifying overall, which is a shame, as a game with this exact concept and set-up could be really cool if done right.",1494100215,1494100215,False,32,0,0.730281293392181396,6,False,False,False,False,,,

It has the theme of british fox hunt, which makes it quite unique and standing out from nowadays generic trash. The base gameplay mechanics are clear and semi easily to get familiar with, but mastering takes time. While fighting is quite easy, it still offers a challenge to win against several opponents, which is what i prefer, to not make things so easy. However, there is some flaws too. The gameplay gets a bit too familiar in few games. The developers should consider adding more content to the game. Simple item spawnrate adjusters could add a lot to the game. So thats a big - for devs! Other thing is multiplayer. I actually enjoyed it a lot. However, the winning condition is unclear. They should chance winning conditions, so that there is actually point to compete against each other and team with others. Well, i guess its not a problem anymore since we don't have enough players in multiplayer servers. Best bet is to take few friends and playing your own game.

Don¬¥t sell games over steam that you can¬¥t play through steamworks. Plug and Play should be standard. 
I¬¥ve tried all the stuff the developers have said is known to cause problems. Port forwarding, firewall issues etc. 
A lot of people have posted similar problems on their discussionforums. And I get that it might be something on my end but it¬¥s weird that I have 50+ multiplayer games on Steam that works flawlessly but this doesn¬¥t. And we were several friends who we¬¥re coming togheter for a Lan-weekend who I talked into buying it and Neither have been able to see any public servers either here nor at home.  
At this point I¬¥m just saying fuck it. I¬¥ll reimburse my friends with some pizza. It¬¥s not like I spent a fortune on the game. The real waste was our time trying to get it to work.

I might still try the game more in singleplayer. But yeah. Dissapointed.

I liked this game a lot, It took me just less than 4 hours beat, and I enjoyed every minute. I do think it is telling that nobody who reviewed this game seems to have more than 20 hours. Overall the game reminded me of the excellent game ‚ÄúUndying‚Äù 

The Story

There is not much to the story but it is there. It starts you off with a storyboard, which makes little sense. You can find books, letters and plaques, with a few hints to the story. Nothing is really clear, other than that the stonehenge can weaken the barriers to other worlds -don‚Äôt say it's magic-. I don't think it is very fitting, however. 

The Graphics
People complain about the graphics in this, and they are not very realistic. I think they are nice and stylised and reminded me much of ‚Äúundying‚Äù. There is fog, and it‚Äôs all not very colourful, but I think the graphics well suit the game. There was graphical errors, but these had little effect and I think it is because it is randomly generated. the robots and houses and such look appealing, the ground and the rocks could use some work. There is fog, and I can see some people being bothered by that, however you can still make out things in the distance clearly.

The Gameplay
There are a few weapons(pistol, shotgun, rifle, blunderbuss, axe) which is a good thing, as inventory management is a big thing, and there is little space for many weapons and an effective load of ammo. Each has a defined purpose, and there is nothing else fitting that could be added and not feel unnecessary. It took me awhile to get used to combat, as the sensitivity was strange at all levels. New items don‚Äôt spawn in, which mean you can‚Äôt play around in one place too long. Some enemies are unkillable, and over all it feels like you are meant to avoid all enemies. Despite being open world and randomly generated, it has low replayability. I blame this on the fact it has only one mode, a scavenger hunt .

The game starts you off the center island, with an equal in size island to the north, east, south and west of you which you can go to at anytime by finding a dock in the direction of the island you want to go to. The goal is to find 20 or something gems, which you need to put into the stonehenge to win. These gems are scattered around the islands. There are number of enemy types that randomly patrol the islands, the more gems you return, the more enemies will spawn. There are towns and other building with loot scattered around the islands. Depending on the class you can start with almost nothing, but with luck you can have a ton of good loot fast. You can store found loot in the buildings without fear of them despawning. It took me only a hour or so to realise you can also stash gems in buildings, so the game does not spawn in more enemies. You can find maps, which you can use to mark 3 spots. 3 spots is more than enough, as it allows you to mark 2 towns where you stashed goodies and a final one for the dock. Your position appears on the map, so navigation with one is real easy. The gems produce smoke which can be seen from far away, but even then there was some frustrating times where I could not find the final gem on an island. Once a robot patrol finds a gem, 2 of them, and a robot dog guard it. Only the first and most basic robot hunters guard gems, and so it is not hard to just shoot them and take the gem. Gems are normally far off the beaten path, so robot patrols will to too long to arrive if you move fast. Alternatively you can throw a clock or bottle as a distraction, but this is far harder to pull off and more risky in my mind than violence. The fact only basic robots guard means you only have to encounter these basic robots, as you can just hide from the other, perhaps cooler types. It was easy for me in the final hours of this game, to make a safe point and stash near the dock of an island, and then find and retrieve the gems with ammo to spare.   

Mechanics
 	-Stealth
               Not like most games, there is no sneaking up behind people and stabbing them in the neck or what not (there is no one hit melee). Rather you are more like a powerless convict running from police. Areas are randomly patrolled, and there are a few options of distracting enemies. This is hard to do, and sometimes it feels just easier to kill them. The game does not pause when you loot, so distractions are even worse. There is bunch of guarded items you need to collect, I think only 2 of which I used a distraction. Some other reviewer said this game was more like guerrilla warfare, you hide, shoot a few shots, pick something up then run away. 

	-Combat 
	  Once you get used to it, it feels good. The health system is very forgiving, but once you run out of rags(which do not respawn) to bandage, you are dead. Eating food frequently will allow to regain health. The guns are powerful, but lack range, even for the sniper. Ammo and guns are rare, yet almost necessary. There is an ADS function that greatly improves damage and accuracy. Going in guns blazing never really works even on small groups later in the game, and if you chose a real class, you will only have a gun by then. If there is something you really want, you can try to sneak up to it, distract the guards or pick one off, hide, pick another one off, hide‚Ä¶. It is repetitive, but also fun.

 	-Inventory
You can keep thing in homes without them despawning, so you are encouraged to keep caches of food and ammo in easy to reach spots. Nothing knew spawns in, yet you can discard things, so watch out. There are 3 types of loot: junk, dubious and useable. Junk does nothing, dubious hurts your hunger when used, and useable is what you want. I at first wondered why there was useless items, but I figure it is to keep you looting and exposed longer. People complain about not being able to go in homes, yet being able to enter them would ruin the game. It is never worth it to kill every one guarding lootables, so you need to sneak up on them, and loot what you can quickly before you are seen, to be able to enter the homes would break this. Judging whether it is worth the risk is one of the biggest aspects about this game. 

Horror
The game was unconventionally scary just like its stealth. It is ‚Äúyou hide behind a stone wall as a clunky robot flies past, wondering to yourself if it will see you‚Äù kind of scary, no jump scares or anything. The point of the game is to avoid enemies, you never really encounter these scary enemies up close, limiting the thrill of the game. I think more horror would have improved this game. 

Other Notes
Over all it is a beautiful game, I just love to see a line of hunters march in a line through the long grass. However it is kind of niche, and the novelty of it wears off once you finish your first play thru. There is just not enough game for it to be worth 20$. I encountered no bugs, and it felt finished.  It took me 4 hours to beat it, and I was not rushing. The Devs claim the game has replayability do to its randomness, however when the game is so straightforward do to its one goal and limited supplies, that replayability is questionable. The is no other modes. There is starting classes, and that's all to make each game different, other than the map not being the same. This game is dying for more modes. It's a great game that will take up an afternoon, but for 20 bucks?

Pros: Different Characters with Unique abilities, can generate your own maps, You can change the difficulties (I love a good challenge so my first game was to max spawn everything. Took 2 steps toward the giant rune better the airballoons gunned me down lol!) The concept is extremely innovative. The baddies were unique, tough, frightening, and therefore satisfying to kill!, I approve of the airballoon. The atmosphere was excellent! And the choice between satiating hunger vs. vigor (health) was well done: Eat an uncooked rat: lose 20 health, rather than die from hunger. Life is all about balance.

Cons:
No Interiors.
Very limited amount of items 
not a lot of craftables

My BIGGEST problem was that:
The stealth system sucks: PLEASE READ BELOW before immediately dismissing my argument:

Being clever at hiding is not a viable option:
- I've played dozens of games of man-hunt, hide and go seek, created successful ambushes. I'm an excellent seeker, I think both in and outside the box. As a runner/hider In real life: I've hidden right under people's noses as long as I remembered to:
a) be aware of my surroundings 
b) be deceptive
c) remain quiet, and well-hidden, 
d) think both inside AND outside the both (i.e don't hide under the car, stand still feet hidden behind the tires, be robust and silently maneuver. Also, don't go for the Tall car shrouded in darkness, Go for a small car in a BRIGHTLY lit area. Find a ladder? Climb up and either take up with you, or place it opposite side of the house of your location. Many a times I've been asked: ""How the hell did you get up there!?

- In reality: I've won almost every hide and go seek type games using methods mentioned above.
Don't believe me? Fine I bet you're the dumbass that traps yourself in the darkest room with no escape route. Hides ""Behind the velvet curtains"" and my personal favorite: ""under a pile of clothes""/""Buried under leaves."" Very obvious. 

Here are a few examples using a,b, c, and d.
1) simply hide behind any door, DO NOT CLOSE IT!!!, instead: squish yourself behind the middle of the door as open and inviting as possible so your pal won't slam you in the face by openng the door): the seeker walks in, checks the closet, the chest, under the bed, piles of clothes, the entire bathroom then leaves.
2) flattened myself as close as possible to the front of the couch., seeker walked straight past me to ""check behind the TV set, when he got there, I volted over the couch and touched base.
3) hid behind a small car right across from the seeker, feet tucked in behind the car tires. Fool thought I'd hide behind the TALLER cars because they had more cover. While he was checking under the wrong cars, I won.
4) Hid on the opposite side of a wall like a ninja, sitting comfortably on a slab of concrete. The gaem had no base so I just chilled there for 30 minutes listening to the footsteps off my budies being chased, running back and forth, on the other side. Finally the seeker caled it quits (Ironically right behind me!) and gave him a good scare.

So you see, that is why the stealth system is unimmersive and crap. Another Argument of mine is thus: The AI CLEARLY do not have Heat Sensors, as you can still sneak up on them and whack the shit out of them with a bat. But when detected, it doesn't matter that they last saw you running in a completely different direction, that you ran 100 meters from them and are virtually invisible and far away in giant corn stalks and wheat fields, or hell, hiding in a tree. They magically gain the sixth sense. but ONLY if you trigger them first! 

The only alternative to survive when out gunned in this game is to run, far, far, away. That shows laziness on the creators' part for the AI

And Yes, I know this is just a game, but I play stealth games because I enjoy using wit, deception, and innovation. This game surely was innovative, but the broken stealth, and the bi-polar AI ruined it.

P.S I hope the authors see this and agree with some of my arguments. Sadly, I cannot recommend a game where it's main feature: Stealth is broken.",1487231860,1487234243,False,6,2,0.472881019115447998,7,True,False,False,False,,,

A j√°t√©k monoton, de a XIX.sz√°zad vid√©ki Britanni√°j√°ba kalauzol minket, annak a kornak a hangulat√°val, ami mi tagad√°s nem azonos a XXI. sz√°zadi csillog√°ssal √©s rohan√°ssal. Ami pedig a t√∂rt√©net hi√°ny√°t illeti: A j√°t√©k annyira elvont, hogy szerintem nem is hi√°nyzik neki.

Pozit√≠v:
- Fekete humor (S√≠rk√∂vet, robotok besz√©de, tal√°lt levelek, stb)
- Egyedi megk√∂zel√≠t√©s (Rusztikus t√∂rt√©netvezet√©s, s√∂t√©t steampunk robotvil√°g)
- Egyszer≈±, de m√©gis √∂tletes ellenfelek
- Kiv√°l√≥ kikapcsol√≥d√°s mag√°nyos est√©kre

Negat√≠v:
- A j√°t√©k viszonyl√≠ag s≈±r≈±n gener√°l olyan vil√°gokat, ahol olyan szigetre ker√ºl ""g√©pdarab"", ahova vagy lehetetlen √©lve √°t√∫szni, vagy ahonnan lehetetlen √©lve vissza√∫szni. ritk√°bban az is el≈ëfordul, hogy a st√©g a semmibe vezet, √©s b√°r be√∫szni a 4 k√ºls≈ë sziget egyik√©re be lehet, vissza m√°r lehetetlen mert ott kempigezik a felj√°r√≥kn√°l a n√°di sz√∂rny.
- Monotonn√° v√°lik viszonylag kor√°n
- A kuty√°k lel√∂v√©se ki tudja kasztani a Unity enginge-t
- A multiplayer gyakorlatilag m≈±k√∂d√©sk√©ptelen

Konckl√∫zi√≥:
A j√°t√©k egyedi, √∂tletes, humoros, de a p√°lyagener√°l√°si √©s egy√©b bugjai miatt m√©gsem tudom tiszta sz√≠vb≈ël aj√°nlani. Sajnos m√°r nem is lesz kijav√≠tva...

Straight up not finished, needs another few months of polish, make the the gun play smoother, less graphical oddities, flesh out some of the interactions (campfires are super unfinished, theres no cooking UI or anything) They left some of the enemies out of multiplayer, and technically there is only a competetive mode, but larping co-op is still possible. It would be totally worth the 20$ they ask for it if they pushed it as far as they wanted. 

Either the game devs weren't able to continue work on this project, due to engine limitation, lack of funding or lack of want. Or they chose not to work on it, and pursue other projects with games that are very similar in premise and game play. 

They've gone on to make two more ""Survival/Action"" Games and those are also, more or less, un polished and not living up to their full potential.

This survival game is unique and lures you in with its premise and English theme. The sound design is good and the core game play is fairly simple.

 

Its just a shame, its so close to being something really awesome, but if this is how the devs make a title; unfinished, then im not going to be getting any other titles they've developed.

If have the trombon (or how its written) you can lure them and them just give them two chop with your axe and robot is dead. Maybe in Multiplayer could be shooting highly effective if all players have enough ammo. At all its is maybe better to just dont kill them if its possible. Speaking about not killing, stealth is prety simple here, you have little circle with eye and it shows you how much are you visible. Sometimes I wished there was quick saving but it would make the game too easy. You can only save at stone monument (your task is to find all mystical fragments that are scattered around 5 island) and boats that are the only way to get to another islands. one negative is that it is short, I completed it in 5 hours, But if it would be longer it would get repetetive.

If it had been some other settings or theme, the game wouldn't be as good.",1482231218,1482231405,True,10,2,0.566894173622131348,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Luckily you are ridiculously good at hiding and sneaking.  But the robots can also be good at searching, and they have robot dogs.  And search balloons.

Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a themed open world stealth survival game set in the British countryside, with an experience that is, at times, as charming as the title of the game would suggest. However, there are things holding this game back from greatness that have made me decide to revoke my previous recommendation of this game in my last review. I've been heavily critical in real life of other developers for doing what these devs have done, and after taking a hard look at my experience in this game, I've decided that I'm not going to give these guys a free pass.

I'll be dividing this review into Pros, Notes, and Cons. Pros are what most people would consider good for what this game wants to be, Notes are noteworthy things about the game that some people may like or dislike based on preference, and Cons are things that most people would generally consider to be negative in a game. Spoiler Alert: The Pros are strong, but boy are the Cons even stronger... Let's get right into it!


Pros:
 - The game has its own unique character, and I know I've said this before in a recent review, but it applies here as well. It feels very much like it's doing its own thing, and there's nothing much out there quite like ""Sir, You Are Being Hunted"". The unique sounds of the enemies, ambience, and the art on the HUDS and menus create a very tailored experience in the game.
 - Each enemy in this game feels like a threat and can be terrifying sometimes the first time you see them. They are all pretty dangerous (when they're working how they are supposed to), and can take you out easily if you're not careful. It also seems to have the most specialized enemies of any game that I can recall as of writing this. Each enemy fulfills its own purpose and poses its own threat without too much overlap, so much so that some of them are even limited to specific regions and behaviors. They all compliment each other in a meaningful way, and if you're found out by one, it can end up leading to a domino effect where you find yourself dealing with all.
 - No crafting. I think that for a game like this, it's a positive. You're supposedly using what you find in the homes of the locals, so it doesn't make sense to throw some obligatory crafting system into this game.
 - Nice looking environments, even though the graphics aren't the best. It's apparently a common criticism of this game that the environments feel dead. I don't think they feel completely dead, but I think that it's good for them to feel kind of dead as it gives you the sort of feeling that the world is wrong in a sense, like it actively hates you and wants you to join it in feeling cold and dead. I mean, it's an alternate reality where robots hunt humans, afterall!
 - Pretty fun gunplay, even if the hotboxes can feel a little wonky. There will be some times when you might ask ""Why didn't that hit?"", but that can be attributed to how skinny the robots are that you'll be shooting the most.
 - You can choose a starting ""profession"" that gives you items to start with that are appropriate for that profession.
 - The game can feel heavily atmospheric at times, and then heart-thumpingly tense at others. 


Notes:

 - Procedurally Generated environments provide a new map on which to play, but the experience is relatively the same unless you crack open the advanced generation settings which are easily available to all players. I believe this somewhat samey gameplay is the cause for the criticism that this game is repetitive, which it kind of is, to be frank.
 - The graphics won't make your shiny new GTX 1080 boner throb. They have a specific art style, and they get the job done. They aren't spectacular, but they aren't bad either.


Cons:

 - The gunshots are RIDICULOUSLY LOUD compared to everything else. Basically, you have three options. 
     1. Crank up the volume to hear your surroundings better, and then be surprised when your ears are almost ripped off           by the invasive volume of the gunshots (like I did) 
     2. Lower your volume (therefore lowering your awareness) and then be surprised when you end up walking out in front of robots you didn't even know were there.
     3. Run to the settings menu and cut the weapons volume IN HALF. Just trust me. It'll save you a pair of ears and headphones/speakers if you do so.

 - The game is a buggy, half-baked mess that was abandoned by its developers on October of last year, which shows that the game was simply a profit machine, not one crafted from passion as it should be. At the very least, there are no microtransactions or DLC because that would be downright [i]insulting[/i] for the state that this game is in. Game-breaking and immersion-breaking bugs have a chance of crawling from their habitats to KILL the singleplayer experience, as the last time I played, enemies, even some of the most threatening ones that are to be feared, could be found running infinitely up against walls, or being completely blind to stimuli altogether. I had some loading corruption where the map was completely void of all enemies, or completely overrun with them. Even worse, I had an entire SAVE corrupted, where crazy things were happening every time I loaded the save, and eventually all pieces of ""The Device"", which are required to be found to complete the game, were NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I only had 5 left, so obviously it would be harder to find them, but I had a scanner that goes off when you have one nearby, and I ran around the whole of all 5 islands with that thing in hand for hours and nothing showed up. And then there's Multiplayer...

- Multiplayer has ONE ISLAND, when the game is supposed to contain an archipelago, which is a GROUP of islands. Now, I understand that it would be kind of taxing on one's server if there were 5 worlds loaded up at any given time with players on them, but they could have at least made the single island bigger so we're not finding up to 4 pieces within view at any given time, couldn't they?! Not only that, but the same glitches I listed for Singleplayer CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN MULTIPLAYER AND EVEN WORSE!!!! Worlds have a chance to load with no pieces of The Device to be found, no enemies, super rare loot, a ridiculous EXCESS OF LOOT, or an EXCESS AMOUNT OF ENEMIES. Pieces of The Device were found with NO ONE TO GUARD THEM all but one time in my multiple online playthroughs with friends. All of this brokenness could be forgiven if the game was in Early Access, or at least still being worked on, but its ""finished"" and the devs have already moved on to their next project.


The Verdict/TL;DR:

It's a mostly full experience (on singeplayer... multiplayer's a half-finished mess) that I've had many hours of fun in, but it's held back by Game-breaking/Immersion-breaking glitches and bugs which even include save/world corruption, and the developers abandoned it in this half-finished state. Do not support this game or its developers unless they decide to fix and finish this game. Period.",1479752240,1481826684,False,38,5,0.487531781196594238,20,True,False,False,False,,,

Fine? Very well, let us begin.

Firstly I will state this, I played this game at about 15fps on the smallest window size possible. The text was too blurry to read, the gun was too laggy to aim. Yet despite all that, I enjoyed every single moment of this game. (Note this was because of my laptop's crappy specs, not the fault of the game)

This game looked appauling due to my computer, so I will refrain from speaking about that.

The main robot you find is a sort of stuck up chap, he refuses to speak with anything other than his shotgun. And blast that thing hurts!

And that is the biggest problem I had with the game. However bleeding is calculated, it is too easy to bleed. 90% of my deaths were from bleeding out trying to find a bandage or being murdered trying to apply a bandage. OR applying a bandage but getting shot again and bleeding again!

The next trouble I had was inventory space. It may seem generous when you first start, but when you find a 4x4 sized chunk, you have to clear out so much stuff. AND I DONT WANT TO THROW AWAY MY CROCKERY!

OH Oh oh! Also love the ending music! Almost skipped because I didn't know something would start playing~

ANyways I like, 8/10

Well i kinda gave up on the whole 'trying to be english' thing half way through that...

It isnt a bad game at all and I am completly enjoying it, thank you to all the hard workers who made this game, but as is usual to steam I think that $21.99 is a bit steap for a game like this. Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic game and I'm sure people will get their moneys worth out of it but I bought it on sale and I feel that if I hadn't I would've been a bit disapointed. I totally recommend this game and if you're using your parents credit card then go for it but if you're looking for a good game to spend your own money on, wishlist this game right now and once it goes on sale buy it.

The game itself is amazing but being about 3/4 done my first playthrough (the game is randomly generated so I will at least play it a few times to mess around with the settings) I feel that besides the generator settings I'll play around with (adding more enemies or making the whole map one biome or something) I'm worried I wont play the game again. Which isnt a real insult to the creators, this isn't skyrim and it isnt a fastpaced FPS, for the intended purpose of playing it a few times all the way through and logging decent hours doing so, its a fantastic game. It has stealth (which is why I bought it) that may not be splinter cell but it has made for many different cool scenarios where you can trick them and kill them or just flee when there are too many. There is also the completely valid option of run and gun as long as you keep looting ammo from the bodies. All in all this game has good elements of action, exploration, stealth, survival and even horror (pro tip, the guy with big legs will murder you and is invincible....) 

In summary, wait for another sale and when it comes, you're in for a wonderful game that merits at least a few playthroughs",1476801640,1476801640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is SOOOOOO nice to actualy take your time and play a FPS that is far closer to reality than anything Ive played in a long time.  OK... Sure, there isnt much ""reality"" in being chased by deranged upper class English robots across a deserted Archipelago, but I can overlook that bit ;)

This game is pretty straight forward as a FPS in its controls and intuitive interface.  Not much overly revolutionary from that aspect...  But the play is Very fun.  I have found myself absorbed it its Quirky little world.  I always know its a good game when I find myself talking to the game as I play it (as opposed to cursing it).  Despite the lack of Blood and big guns, I have enjoyed this game more than anything since the orginal Borderlands.  This is a much slower game than many People may be accustomed to with the typical FPS.  It may be too slow for many, but To me it feels far more realistic and worth my time. 

If I have any suggestions/complaints, there are two.  ONE: Stratagy hints flash up between load screens (typical), but they flash so quickly, and often contain a lot of info, its difficult to take in the suggestions.  Id rather have the guide avalible as a ""help"" option.  TWO: Finding the 15 Pieces of the mysterious artifact you need to assemble inorder to complete the game, can be frustrating. You more or less need to stumble upon each part, rather than Hunt the parts down. The one tell as to the location is extremely subtle and difficult to spot unless you are right on top of the part.  The majority of my frustration with the game is spending far too long randomly looking for the 15 parts.

-Simplistic looting (access all doors of a house to find various loot in the same house)
-Graphics (grass and trees do not hold up to srcutiny and BELIEVE ME you will be looking very closely when hiding which        is what you'll be doing 90% of the time)

There is no end cutscene or better explanation of the story or getting to see your character.  I guess I have been spoiled, but I like something other than credits and an amusing rap song. :(

Pros:
-Old school minimalism (few way points, no map at first, forced exploration, and only a couple of save points)
-Truely terror inducing (achieved by difficulty not by stupid game mechanics)
-Great humor (funny loot, item desciptions, and robotic movments)

Needs a higher graphic, better skinned, more voiced over, with greater story element, and true end sequneced Sequel
I would give $15 to $20 for that Sequel with no steam sale reduction.

But I wouldn't recommend trying to beat it, not without a walkthrough and strategy guide. The difficulty is unforgiving and escalates with each found objective. You, on the other hand, don't get any upgrades and have to fully rely on random loot. I managed to find 8 pieces and then was unable to make further progress. I never found any weapons, and only a few bullets.

Objectives:
There are 15(?) pickups to find across 5 large islands, and the difficulty escalates with each one. They are not shown on the compass or map (you don't even have a map until you find one). At night(?), glowing will-o'-the-wisps can slowly guide you to them. Or just wander around until you see smoke surrounded by enemies - because the objectives are always surrounded by enemies. You are always forced to sneak up close, then dash in, grab the quest item and start fleeing. The objective items vary in size and can take up up to 1/3 of your inventory space, so you have to leave enough room just in case, to avoid getting screwed as you try to grab the item.

Resources:
You find loot in buildings. 90% is garbage, and the rest are either tools or one-use consumables. There is never enough inventory space because items don't stack, and there is barely enough food in the game to cover the most direct route. Scavenging is no longer viable once the difficulty escalates, because you waste more energy sneaking around looking for food. A possible strategy might be to loot everything at the start and stash it in an easily accessible location.",1473447908,1473447908,False,11,0,0.485935956239700317,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It is a rather short game if you fully keep your eyes on the prize. But I've replayed it 4 times now. 


-- Advice: when to buy it, when not to --

If you're somewhat of a perfectionist that needs that pretty polish and all details worked out completely: 
-> Don't buy, you'll be frustrated

If you find yourself absorbed in the atmosphere of games, enjoy weird orginal feeling games and can look past things like dated graphics:

The Standing Stones only appear on the central island, meaning every teleporter fragment you collect forces you to go across the width of the island you're on, ferry over to the central one, then walk over to the stones, all while avoiding robots and staring longingly at villages you could be looting but you can't because fragments are so fucking huge and take up so much inventory space.

I personally feel that a lot of negative reviews towards this game are incredibly unfair. People forget that this is not Metal Gear, it's not Ghost Recon, it's not Assassin's Creed, and it CERTAINLY is not a copy/paste of other survival genre games. Allow me to rebuke some negative comments I've heard about this game.

-Yes, the game plays slow. Sometimes, it plays slow as hell. Obviously this is not a style of gameplay for everyone. This DOES NOT, however, mean the gameplay is faulty. Sir is a game about survival at it's core, and you are intentionally given few options to fight back. Sneaking is your alternative to fighting, and if staying slow and steady isn't your cup of tea, don't ruin this game's credibility by calling it broken gameplay. And for the love of mercy, yes, standing up in an open field WILL get you seen and that is NOT unfair gameplay!

-I've read complaints about guns being useless due to their noise attracting enemies... um, duh. That's what guns do. Unprofessionalism aside, I actually really enjoyed this feature. It adds a tense cost/effect relationship to defending yourself that very few survival horror games honestly have. You can't just shoot an enemy, walk two feet, hide, and not get spotted; besides, I've used guns in this game a number of times and I've NEVER been spotted but once or twice after using them. Shoot a robot to avoid being seen, loot his scrawny metal-ass corpse, and run like hell before his buddies show up. Seriously, if you're having trouble because you haven't played the game before, it takes PRACTICE and TIME to learn how to survive using what you're given.

-The axe... okay you guys win, the axe needs to be fixed. It's realistic! The problem is, eh, it's too realistic, and because the enemies are as aware as they are in this game, it's damn near impossible to use the axe for its intended purpose: sneaking up and attacking enemies from behind. That being said, perhaps some tweaks could be made. Make the axe do more damage so robots can't just run away when you hit them, even if they've spotted you. Use the axe to cut lumber and build a campfire. This item really does need to be made more useful.

-The save mechanic also needs to be addressed. Because of the game's slow nature, players are unable to return to a boat or the standing stones before being surrounded by hunters. Perhaps a feature could be implemented allowing players to find books that they can ""use"" to save their progress on the move, but maybe like ink ribbons in Resident Evil they're a one-use item. Also, can we please get more standing stones than just the one at the central island? I can't stress enough how much longer this game honestly gets having to make trips one piece at a time between islands.

In short, there are a few flaring issues with this game, and they should be addressed. However, a lot of people who write down on this game seem to share something in common: they've barely played it for an hour or two, and they've already decided they know exactly how the game works. This is not a game you can just pick up and play; it's trial and error. Sure, it can be tedious, but that doesn't make it a bad game. If anything it makes it a dynamic game. The lesson of Sir is that survival is hard, and should not be taken lightly. Speeding through it, wantonly fighting robots, and getting impatient WILL GET YOU KILLED. So please do keep in mind, sir, that you are being hunted (nailed it).

I personally recommend this game to anyone looking for a new experience when it comes to survival horror. While Sir isn't necessarily horrifying, it's pretty damn chilling the first time you're dropped in, and it takes a lot of getting used to. SO: if you get this game, be patient. If you don't like it, oh well, it's not your thing. Now go out there and... don't die. I guess. Good luck.",1470621757,1470621993,True,42,6,0.772466182708740234,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is a blast. It does a wonderful job of creating tension naturally. Even though I‚Äôve played the game a couple times, my heart always still races every time I find myself creeping through a robot infested town or when I am running through the country side being chased by two hunting parties.  The grim atmosphere and constant threat of danger is always enough to keep me on edge.  The inventory management adds a very fun element to the game. It limits the amount of supplies that the player can carry, forces the player to make tough choices on what to bring and what to leave behind.  I like the inventory system because it makes me feel like I am on the run. I can only take the essentials, and if I want to keep something, I have to cache it somewhere on the map. I can't just stock pile weapons until I can go full Call of Duty on everyone. I have to conserve ammo and only use them when I am in a bind.
I do have some criticisms of the game though. When walking through the brush, the frame rate drops. I personally think the game should have permadeath. I know there are some mods that offer that but I think the game should include it. My funniest play through were the ones where I told myself that if I die, I would have to start over. I only felt like I was playing the game the way it was supposed to be played when I couldn't use the saving system as a crutch. Even with the save system though, the game can still be punishing, just not as punishing as I think it should be.
Overall, this is one of my favorite indie games, and I think it is worth a play through. It‚Äôs a game where I can play through a couple times, drop it for a month, and then pick it up again.

[h1][i]Okay, maybe I am going to mince words[/i][/h1]

You know all those tense moments in other stealth games of sneaking up on a mook oh-so cautiously, praying he doesn't turn around, to take him out, then methodically do the same to every one else in the area so you can explore unimpeded and progress? That simply doesn't happen in this game. There are very very few tactics for you to use against the robot and this means the gameplay is incredibly boring since actually interacting with the main obstacle of the game is counterproductive to the game's objective. Perhap it's unfair to expect this game to have gameplay more similar to a stealth-action game since this could be more a part of the survival horror genre than the stealth genre, but it was not able to immerse me or terrify me with it's minimalistic presentation. The robots don't seem scary, just overpowered. Now about the survival aspects of the game: they are incredibly simplistic, the game enviroments are sparse and dull from a mechanical perspective, and there are few interesting tools with which to fight or avoid the robots. Some other reviews say the game simply needs ""more content"", but that does not address the fact that the problems with it are mostly on the design level, in my opinion. The game does not need more stuff to throw at you, it needs a more interesting way of putting all that stuff together to make your encounters with the robots more nuanced and exciting or make exploring the map more interesting. It is a bland and wholly un-interactive experience.",1469906505,1480370018,False,0,0,0.467032968997955322,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I love the premise: sneaking around a bunch of run-down British islands, hiding from British robots who are trying to kill you. The atmosphere is really good too. But the gameplay is decidedly lacking.

The point of the game is to sneak around. You can get weapons, but they're not really common, and they're not great (to use an axe, for example, you have to close to melee range against a shot-gun wielding enemy, or to use a gun you have to make a ton of noise that can bring other enemies to you). That's all fine by me: I enjoy stealth games. But there's no real stealth system. If you're standing up and someone looks in your direction, they see you. If you run anywhere near an enemy, they hear you and come looking. The only way to avoid notice is to crouch around. The main problem with that? It's slow as hell.

That was my biggest problem with the game: it was incredibly tedious. You're collecting these fragments of a machine/magic device/whatever for reasons, and they're scattered around five seperate islands. You have to wander around these fairly large areas, and if there's ever an enemy around, you have to do it at this ridiculously slow speed. And to make matters worse, the only times you can save are when you're at the device at the center of the center island, or when you're at a boat on any of the islands. So if you mess up, all your work since the last major thing you did is gone, and you have to do all the tedious BS all over again.

I only played an hour, but I played that in three or four seperate sessions, because literally every single time I played, the session would end with me alt-f4ing in frustration after making one mistake and getting blown away in two shots. I don't mind my character having low health; I don't mind it being difficult; I don't mind it having few save points. What I mind is spending 15 minutes sneaking up to one of the fragments you're supposed to be collecting, distracting the guards, grabbing the fragment, then getting killed by a robot you didn't see and realizing you have to do all that sneaking and setup again.

This game could be a lot of fun if there was a better stealth system (maybe if different terrain made different amounts of noise, so you could run across soft grass, for example, and not be heard, or especially if sneaking wasn't so damn slow) and maybe a bit more to do than just creep around the island. You can loot stuff to get more items, and you have to eat to survive, but there's barely any crafting (you can cook food on a fire) and there are no interactable objects anywhere.

So Tl;dr: it was tedious and it was boring, except when getting killed and losing all my progress, and then it was frustrating. But good atmosphere and setting.",1469833040,1469833063,False,27,0,0.521988570690155029,4,False,False,False,False,,,

All encounters can be deadly.
It is a short game, albeit long if you suck at stealth or are impatient and waste ammo like a dud.
If you enjoy sneaking around with the occasional gun fight then you may like this game.  Unless you are good at distracting foes, you in most case find yourself shooting your enemies to get artefacts.

You can sneak in longer grass/bushes but watch out for crows- the bots know something is up and will investigate.
Newer types of enemies and more in quantity will spawn as game time progresses or as you return more artefacts to the beacon where you stared at.  

There is a main large island that you start on with 4 smaller islands (loading screen separated) branching off from it.  You must explore 4 islands and from each return 3 small artefacts.  The main island artefacts are huge.

Some issues for newbies- If you go the character with the rifle, don‚Äôt expect to find ammo for it until late game.  If you take 3+ shots to kill a normal shotgun robot consistently, you‚Äôre  doing it wrong and will probably run out of ammo soon.  If you catch them by surprise one shotgun blast kills them.

To keep it interesting you probably want to make all 4 islands ‚Äòindustrial‚Äô as they have the most things in them, in comparison the other 3 types of islands are boring.

Content is lacking and it seems like a lot of focus went into ""flavor"" for the game instead of making the game its self fun. There's about 30 types of silly random nonesense items you can find while looting but they all literally do nothing but are there for fun. Meanwhile buildings are basically loot chests. 

Guns are very limited and remain so, it's actually pretty infuriating how rare some weapons are when they take up such a huge amount of space and it's so hard to get ammo. I understand it's meant to be a stealth game but when I've worked so hard to get some weapons like the sniper rifle it just makes me rage that I have to drop it in order to get one the progression artifacts. 

On top of this all, the game is just... boring. There's four different islands to visit but they all feel mostly the same with some slight difficulty changes. There's nothing to really do in the game and progression is minimal. You can honestly win the game pretty easily just by running away and jumping over fences and whatnot. There's also an issue of finding the damn artifacts to begin with. They're incredibly easy to miss when they're hidden inbetween several trees with the robots often patrolling around them.

The game's difficulty is also a mix of too easy and too unforgiving. For example, you can save very very often, it feels kind of weird and out of place. I think maybe a checkpoint system after finding artifacts would have worked better. However then you have the Landowners. These robots are pure aids. If you are spotted by one they literally will follow you forever knowing exactly where you are, and they have a one hit kill attack. The game of course doesn't explain this to you whatsoever, so when I wasted all my ammo in the hopes of bringing it down I basically fucked myself. 

It's a neat idea but with awful execution. It's a very mediocre survival game and despite being single player focused it STILL lacks content. I don't know what happened. I can't really reccomend this game to anyone, it seems just so mediocre and like a failed experiment.

To name a few of the mechanics

- Collects number of items, increasing enemy frequency and difficulty as you collect
- Loot containers with food / ammo / junk
- Shallow stealth system
- Tiny inventory for 'Management'
- Walking simulator

The graphics are extremely bare even for an indie title. I did not find the art style to be engaging at all but that is preference. 

Something to be noted is that no buildings in the game have interiors. The buildings dotted on the horizon serve essentially as large loot containers. The developers have stated that they wanted to focus on other areas of the game. While that is completely their decision to make, this results in every building feeling like a giant cardboard box. For me this left me feeling like I was interracting with a placeholder in an early access game.

The humour that the game and many of the other reviews hint at (Relentless Britishness?) boils down to 'British Aristocrat... BUT ROBOT'. If you find a synthesised british accent saying 'You bugger!' and 'Tarry ho!' hilarious then you may find this game clever and witty. I did not. 

As an aside I dislike games that claim that a part of the difficulty revolves around 'managing your inventory'. Making the game more infuriating / awkward for the player as a selling point is lazy game design in my opinion.

While none of the mechanics in this game feel new or interesting they are a fair bit more polished than a lot of the games in this genre. Where I felt the game really excelled however was in the audio. The ambient sounds and music create a terrific atmosphere.

SUMMARY:

This game has a very high price tag for the content. It feels extremely unpolished and unfinished. 
If like me you have the chance to get this game on sale and really want to scratch the itch in the Survival / Horror genre and find references to tea and biscuits incredibly funny... I'd still probably tell you to go play a different game. 

This is not the worst example of a survival horror game on steam. That however, is a bit like being the kid in the special class who doesn't eat his crayons.

Get the stones to go back to your time, avoid the robots and survive off what you got. And thats why I LOVE THIS GAME. It is as simple as that. Just survive. No XP. No quests. Just survive. The only building you do is make campfires and that is it. That is perfect for a survival game like this. Now onto the review!

I did say that this game was simple but it is also complex in ways. There are different enemies ranging from just a standard farmer with a gun to these giant shadowy dudes to scarecrows that attract enemies. Your objective is to get magical stones to power up a ruin to go back to your time period. In this time period, robots have taken over and are killing off all humans. Enemies react in a number of ways. For example, they can see you from a mile away if you are just standing up and running around. They will also hear the running and if you fire a shot, it will bring even more robots to you. There is one robot, the trapper, that lays bear traps that cripples you and shocks you enough to get close and shotgun you in the face. The heatlh and food system is easy. Eat good food or drink to replenish health and use bandages if you are bleeding. Stealth is simple, crouch to go silent and if you are in the brush then you are practically invisible which makes going on the open roads a bad idea. 

Now onto the cons. This game can be quite confusing and somewhat overbearing if you are playing for the first time. HOWEVER, there is a tutorial in the game that somewhat tells you what not to do. Enemies as I said are simplistic but there are only a few select types. All unique yes but when you get to know them, you know how to counter them with easy. Minor gripe, nothing major. The graphics are a bit ugh but it's not terrible. 

Not a bad game to play once and a while.",1468462893,1468462893,True,3,0,0.457821428775787354,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Dear Sir and/or Madam, you are currently being hunted

Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a stealth and survival game where you end up in a randomly generated world full of robot men with guns, robot dogs with big teeth and big hot air ballons all tracking you down whilst you have to find pieces to what looks like a extra terrestrial shard thingy

The game is scary as you are constantly on the lookout for any of the enemies and the electronic conversations and shooting in the distance really makes you on your toes. The game is challenging, you can only carry a certain amount. Your view can change depending on where you are hiding and the level of crouch and when you're hit, you start to bleed out

Overall, the game is fun and interesting to play but sadly after 4 hours of playing the game, I felt like I covered all my tracks and I was just doing the same things over and over again. Find shards in different areas of the world whilst trying to avoid the robot men with giant guns

The game also offers multiplayer, it's mostly the same thing only with other people and you can be spotted by the robots easier because of the amount of trolls in the game

Sir, You Are Being Hunted is an interesting and scary game to play, but after a while, it just gets repetitive. This game is best played in bursts rather than in one whole sitting

It's stealth and survival with tea and biscuits, lovely

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]",1466972403,1466972460,True,5,1,0.506800591945648193,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I love the Thief series.  Deus Ex.  Metal Gear.  If I can sneak and outsmart my enemies, I'm all in.  

This game makes that rather difficult.  Each of my untimely demises brought about a story, and made me shout.  Each time I was able to crouch behind a bush, tree, fence, and watch the search lights of the enemy sweep past my hiding spot, I got a terrified little thrill.  There's a lot of sneaking, and searching, and standing out in the open trying to find the next waypoint, but it all leads to moments like that.  

I ran into a small copse of trees to hide from several pipe-smoking robots out looking for me.  As I slipped further into the trees and into a low swampy area, I heard this sound.  It was errie, something new, and difficult to locate.  I peeped around the large tree I was hiding behind, and saw this big, round, shadowy figure slowly plodding through the swamp with the help of a cane.  I had no idea what he could do.  What his attacks were.  How well he could see.  I only knew he was taller than I was, with round, white eyes, and that huge cane.  I hid from him, not because I knew what kind of threat he posed, but because I DIDN'T know, and that was much more frightening.  

That's what Sir, You are being Hunted does best.  It leaves things up to your imagination.  It is very much in the ilk of Brittish Movies like, ""Cold Comfort Farm,"" were one of the characters constantly says, ""I saw something nasty in the wood shed,"" but all they show you is her peering into the shed, and her screaming in terror.  Well, I saw something nasty in the water, and I'll never go for a swim there again.

Yes, I haven't played for very long and yes, I'll probably edit this review later on in life, but it's still a great game! You are always looking for places to hide, and you are always on your guard.

There is so much I can say about this game, but I won't. All I shall say is that the graphic style is nice, the robot diversity is great, the music is edgy and strange, and the game play isn't that bad. Besides, the robots have top hats and monocles, how awesome can you get with this game?

Keep the rocks between them and us! Let's go.......

SYABH is a brilliant stealth game.  The programmers who made the random scenery and terrain are geniuses.  It may also be the most british game of all time, as well!     The end-music is well worth playing through for, as well... 

If I had to describe this game, it changes it feel according to what you're doing. Sometimes it feels like Thief, sometimes ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R""...  The whole atmosphere is excellent, and despite dieing repeatedly, I just couldn't stop, because I knew I could beat it with patience.  Oh, yes, that's what this game needs, patience, and LOTS of it.   You are very vulnerable, so being quiet, taking your time, and planning your move will help you immensely.     The graphics aren't as polished as a AAA game, and the music is ambient and atmospheric, sounding like some of the stock sounds from a synth app.  The UI is minimal and does look a little amateurish.. However, none of that really detracts from the game.  The locations are superb, the path-finding is excellent, and the constant pressure to keep moving is superb.  you really do feel like you're public enemy #1.

Well recommended, but not for people who only like SHMUPS and FPSes... Quake, this ain't.  If you liked Thief, though, this is more your style.     Make sure you have a thermos of tea and some biscuits when you play as well.  It's what us brits would do :)",1466091043,1466852011,True,7,3,0.566016495227813721,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Sneaking is the selling-point of the game, but it's poorly implemented. A ""visibility"" meter indicates how easily enemies can see the player's avatar, but the meter contradicts the apparent terrain. An avatar can be 0% visible in foot-high grass and 100% visible in a dense thicket. Aside from simply memorizing all the different plant models, there's no way to intuit a concealed way through the landscape.

Looting is not as glitchy, but it's tedious: about 90% of the loot is useless (and marked as such), and loot-areas are often clustered in identical-looking buildings, making it hard to remember which caches are picked-over and which may still hold riches. Food is so scarce that a player must spend a third to half of their time in pursuit of it instead of going after the artifacts that are the ostensible focus of the game. Other essential types of loot are rare to the point of being absent: after two hours of game-play, I've yet to find a means to light a campfire for cooking the copious amounts of raw meat I've acquired.

Combat is reasonably well developed, but no matter how satisfying the gunfights are, they're necessarily a secondary aspect of the game because, even with a very aggressive strategy of mowing-down enemy robots early, the shuttling of artifacts requires so much time (due to strict limits on inventory size) that food becomes an urgent requirement and the tedious process of looting cannot be avoided.

Sadly, if you're looking for a game that offers ponderous weapons, kooky loot, rotten eggs, metal men, and proceduraly generated terrain, you'll find a much more complete and satisfying experience in [i]Minecraft[/i].",1465937539,1515553151,False,5,1,0.440470844507217407,1,True,False,False,False,,,

But it's slightly below the bar over which I'd recommend it - especially at full price.

The thing is: for the first few minutes while it's a novelty it's hilarious. But soon enough you'll start to find the problems. For example, there's no story, no background, no nothing. You're just ""there"" and need to collect a few things that don't make sense. 

But ok, I can live with that. However, for single player the biggest letdown is replayability: There's none. Sure it's a procedural world but it's plain and boring. So once you've seen one you've seen it all.

Multiplayer could really save this game. That's where I've spent most of my playing time. It's fun, until you realize all the shortcuts that have been done and how much more simple the game is compared to single player. The MP is fun but it feels completely unfinished. And from what I remember it really is.

So what puts the last nail on the coffin is that it isn't in development any more. I was enthusiastic about this game while it was being developed. When MP came out the devs said they'd improve it. This never happened apart from a couple of bug fixes... Until they apparently said ""meh, good enough"" and left it at that. 

It's a sad state of affairs but unfortunately one in which many good ideas get buried. 

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

If you like playing something ""different"" with a ""peculiar sense of humour"" then this may be for you. Grab it on a strong sale. If you can get a 4-pack for little money it's also worth gifting to some friends and play some MP for an hour or two worth of laughs. Most of the fun goes away after the novelty wears out though.",1464705616,1464705616,False,44,2,0.686802685260772705,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The procedurally generated landscape and buildings ensure surprises around every corner, no matter how many times you create a new file. 

The suspense and style of this game will never tire, as the fear of encroaching enemy forces permeates all. 

I would strongly recommend this game to stealth lovers, action gamers, and puzzlers alike. The multiplayer mode is excellent- I just wish more people played it! 

One problem I had was that my cursor intermittently disappeared, making inventory navigation quite difficult. 

I found great enjoyment in this game, despite its graphical simplicity. Here is a general summary of my experience. 

Step 1: Buy ""Sir You are Being Hunted""

Step 2: Start new file. How hard can this be?

Step 3: Enter world. See the robots. Laugh. 

Step 4: Run at robots. Kill them all. 

Step 5: Get shot. Get shot again. Bleed out. Cry. 

Step 6: Respawn. Look for food.

Step 7: Suddenly, Airship. Cry myself to sleep.

Step 8: Respawn. See robots. Run in fear. Hide. 

Step 9: Find cool sh*t. Lots of guns. Overconfidence levels rise. 

Step 10: Shoot everything. Pull dank trickshots. 

Step 11: Steal fragments. 

Step 12: Start fire. Run away. 

Step 13: Walking in field- get mauled by attack dog. Cry self to sleep. 

Step 14: Hear abnormal noises. Landowner ensues. Try to kill. Fail. Die. 

Step 15: Scarecrow. Run. Get caught. Shot.

Step 16: Love the Game.

This is the survival sim experience to the core; without over loading you with recipes or having to constantly babysit your character, it has ARMA like leaning and firearm control; the AI is FUCKING AMAZING; scary even; I hate being hunted; even though I chose not to live in fear of my robotic over lords and stack their bodies like cordwood at every given chance...

It's very easy to get into, but has a great depth; and I like how they handled some things that other games struggle with; like when looting a house you don't have to go into each individual house, and get each individual box; you just check the door and be on your way; so I can focus more on maurauding against the Over Lords; whoever they are.",1462485899,1462485899,True,20,3,0.668617129325866699,0,False,False,False,False,,,

great atmosphere. Very well thought out ... 
Sneek around trying to find food to stay alive - while trying to track down and steal
15 artifacts to exit the island - thats it. simple you say ?... give it a try.
don't expect a typical shooter ... it's definetly more stealth than fighting.
If you want action it's there, but you will have to shoot and run like hell.
Took me 9 hours ish to complete ... and I'm sure I'll give a replay in the near future.
I picked my copy up for ¬£5 in the steam sale ... so definetly one to add to your wishlist

The entire time you are constantly on edge, trying to survive and make tactical choices throughout the entire game (day and night cycles are equally nerve-inducing). All the enemies, items, weapons and encounters are unique, and the game gets harder as you progress towards successfully escaping the five inter-connected islands. Stealth is key to this game. If you do not like taking your time or being stealthy, then this game WILL punish you; you will find yourself running away from enemies or dying most of the time as a result. 

Despite a few personal issues I had with the lighting and game mechanics (mainly item usage like the alarm clock or bottle), I believe this game was a quick, fun, and overall entertaining way to spend an evening. I was able to finish a complete game in a single day that lasted a little over three hours. Just know that those were very worthwhile hours though. To me, there is not too much immediate replay value, but I can see myself coming back to this game some future afternoon. There is also a multiplayer option outside of the single-player gameplay, but I cannot comment on this since I have yet to have friends willing to play it with me. 

Basically, I know this game won't be for everyone, but it is a solid stealth-based game. Therefore, pick it up during a steam sale when you get the chance! Also, due to its relatively short single player, if you do not like it within the first hour or so, you can always get your money back from Steam. I hope this review helps you in making your decision to buy this game or not, but if you have any questions about the game before you purchase it, feel free to add me or leave a comment here about it. 

Oh yeah, my final rating (as people find this to be almost a necessity):

Wow. You have no idea what you are truly getting into until you're there. This game is funny, ridiculous, and stressing all at the same time.

I spent the first part gathering up a whole bunch of gear and not finding the the robots, only to have all the gear lost to my frantic unpracticed shooting when I was finally being run down my robots. We scrambled trying to gather up the stones to win, eventually learning how to properly coordinate and got better at not being owned by robots (ie hiding).

And then came the unintended shenanigans. Working my way to the stone with one of the pieces, approaching a building to hide next to, I hear my friend being spotted and shot at. Having no weapons but an objective piece, there was nothing I could do for the poor doomed soul. I resumed my approach to the building and just before getting there, my friend runs right across my path, and I knew then, that things were just about to get real. Ya, the robots chasing him got to stumble across me so now I was the one desperately running. After circling the building a few times and a few failed hiding attempts, I settled into a new spot as one of the robots rounded the corner in pursuit. For an agonizing nerve-wrecking minute or two I waiting in terror as the robot continued to search for me and kept creeping closer to my incredibly flimsy hiding spot next to the building. After what felt like an eternity, he decided to resume patrol, and wandered off, leaving me, somehow not dead.

Honestly, I don't think this is trash or anything, but I can't recommend it, especially at full price.

I think this is an OK game, but it definitely isn't worth $20.  Additionally, it still feels very rough but the last update was in Oct 2015 (it's now Apr 2016) and the version is 1.0+, so I don't know if the dev is planning to do much more with it.  If you're playing this single player, I can't imagine you getting more than 3 hours of quality gaming out of it (I probably got around 1.5 hours myself before I got bored of it).  The multiplayer is a bit clunky to set up and once you've got a game going, I guess it could be good if you have like 4 or 5 people in it, but when you have 2 or 3 I personally didn't find it added much.

Overall, it's a decent game that needs polish, but I don't think it'll ever get it.  $20 for this is just absurd though, even with all the necessary polish I'd say $15 is the max I could ever recommend this for.  In its current state, if you're ok with a rough game that will probably remain so, I'd recommend picking it up at around $7, maybe $10 if you have 4 or 5 friends who are also going to get it.",1460337342,1460337342,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But after watching a couple of Richspeed's charming SYABH YouTube videos (check out Ep 13), it was clear I'd been playing all wrong, and far too timidly! I should have been running around and only stealthing while bots are near. Also, the hunting rifle is powerful and satisfying, so it's worth scavenging around for one.

I suspect the devs have done some tuning since my first go at it, and now the gameplay just feels right.  Plus, having the single-player option to start with a rifle (as the Officer) made a huge difference.

I've also played a few co-op multi-player sessions with friends and I'm here to report it's a ton of fun. The art direction and gameplay are both top-notch, so we found it a very satisfying experience. And the networking was solid, no issues there.

If you enjoy the stealth and combat in Skyrim, Sir You Are Being Hunted will probably appeal to you as well. I recommend this game.

Positives:
+ Amusing dialogue and humor
+ Excellent atmosphere that keeps the player on edge
+ Excellent world generator that allows some customization

Neutral:
* Subpar graphics, but what you'd expect from an indie game
* Okay variety in items to collect

Negative:
- Unfortunately very dull half of the time. There aren't enough enemies, locations, and objects to collect to keep the suspense going,

As a huge fan of both stealth games and survival games, I really wanted to enjoy SYABH. But in its current state, I can't get myself to recommend it.

Technisch hat es noch viel Raum nach oben, und in puncto Stealth-Gameplay erfindet es das Rad in keiner Hinsicht neu. Warum empfehle ich es trotzdem nachdr√ºcklicher als alle anderen vergleichbaren Spiele?

Zum einen erschafft SYABH mit einfachen Mitteln ein wunderbar stimmungsvolles, absichtlich √ºberzeichnetes Abbild der englischen Landschaft. Die prozedural generierten Spielwelten mit ihren regnerischen Feldern, versmogten Industriegebieten und deprimierenden D√∂rfern sind ungemein atmosph√§risch und passen gut zum Spielgef√ºhl.
Zum anderen nimmt sich das Spiel erfrischend wenig ernst. Die blechernen Gentlemen, die den Spieler jagen, klopfen trockene Spr√ºche, und die Texte sind mit einer Prise englischen Humor geschrieben.

Eins muss ich trotzdem kritisieren: Der Titel ""Sir, you are being hunted"" ist eigentlich irref√ºhrend, da nur wenige Roboter dem Spieler aktiv nachstellen. Die meisten von ihnen bewachen lediglich wichtige Positionen, die der Spieler somit nacheinander abklappern kann. Ein echtes Gef√ºhl des Gejagtwerdens kommt so nicht auf - schade, aber vielleicht war die Umsetzung technisch nicht anders m√∂glich.

Alles in allem m√∂chte ich dieses Spiel dem geneigten Leser w√§rmstens empfehlen. *Tee trink* *Monokel zurechtr√ºck*",1457978517,1457978517,True,4,1,0.576690495014190674,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Guess what i did.

I teleported while my friend was pointed the other way. He was not happy.

Anyways, to the real review!

This game is fantastic. Robots hunt you down with guns while you try to survive off of rats and cat food from their own houses. But, you can fight back with various weaponry, including muskets, dynamite, and the trusty axe. To escape the island of robots, you have to find pieces to a teleporter, which only takes pieces occasionally. Said pieces are scattered around the island, in small craters, with smoke coming from their location. Once you have enough pieces, you can teleport out. But, only one will make it out.

Pros
- Its hard ( As a survival game should be )
- The shooting and moving and such works perfectly
- The Old Movie aesthetic is awesome
- The atmosphere in this game is intense and you feel like your always on your toes and worried.
- Its Multiplayer

Cons
- A lot of useless items
- Not much enemy variety
- The guns are basic and uninteresting
- The way you beat the game isn't fun. ( You look for rocks the entire time )

I'd recommend it on a sale, or if you love survival games.

There are a variety of robots, such as robots on robot horses, robots with rifles, robots with blunderbusses, scarecrows that warn other robots, robot hunting dogs, and a giant hot air balloon that will attract robots to your location if you are spotted. With only having a rag to stop bleeding and a bottle of alcohol for vitality, stealth becomes a vital role in the game until you find enough guns and ammo and other weapons, traps, and distraction items to combat the robots, and even then is a huge role in staying alive. Even though sneaking through the map from town to town getting loot, avoiding robots, running from robots, and occasionaly attacking a robot for its loot is fun for a while, this game does lose its fun rather quickly. Because you cannot punch or kick in this game, having a weapon is crucial to defending yourself from the ever-present threat of being attacked by a robot. Typically a game goes like this: 
1. Spawn, get to the nearest town, and loot it, possibly finding a weapon or two
2. Go looking for a piece of the teleporter (you win the game by returning all the pieces of a teleporter to a place called the stones) and possibly grab it if it is unguarded
3. Return one or two pieces of the teleporter and then get killed by robots
4. Repeat this process a couple of times. No problem, right? theres always some loot to be found, right? WRONG!
5. Get to the point where all the loot that will actually help you is gone, except the occasional food or bottle that can be found in some place that you somehow skipped when you looted a town
6. At this point, there will probably be a lot of robots, as more spawn as you return more pieces of the teleporter.
7. Get stuck in an endless cycle of trying to find an ungaurded teleporter piece, then try to get it and run to the stones, but get shot 90% of the time
8. Repeat 7 until you win
Overall, its pretty fun, but loses its fun after a while of having no weapons and just being forced to run from every robot.

Only thing SYABH has going for it is British countryside aesthetics and the game hardly uses it to  its potential: environment is very dull and there is barely any atmosphere or lingo in flavor text, all you see is typical north England housing and robots wearing top hats(yet speaking in very broad accent using common terms). 
Another completely misused asset in this game is procedural generation: supposedly it creates parts of the world from a seed, but the only difference it ever has is in occasional building, that you can only push button on to receive loot, looks different, but even with that 90% of the world is the identical tall grass and copypasted trees.
Enemy AI is lackluster as well and for a game that bases itself on the premise of stealth it falls on its face.  
UI is functional but that is all that can be said for it, no flavor, no stylistic impression, just a grid with objects on it. 
Finally the survival aspect is non-existant, and while I can appreaciate a game that doesn't want to put a dozen idiotic parameters that you ahve to monitor constantly like other representatives of the genre, boiling everything down to two parameters one of which is your HP is just lazy and feels pointless.
Another good point this game is capable of striking is the weaponry feel, shotguns have a nice punch to them, but even that gets spoiled when you realize every single firearm has the same sound and hitting an enemy with it results in metal clinking anyway.

when i first saw this game, i didn't really like it (i just saw a trombone and how a plyere lured something to them and decied to check this game out) but when i gave it a try, i realized one thing, this is a phenomenally good game:
- it has a uniquie story.
- Rarely in game history, play not as a hunter, but as a prey.
- Weapons are secondary in this game (i beat appox 60% of it without even finding a gun)
- Enemy has a very interesting AI (they look around the last place they saw you, always stick together, lay traps, guard sertain areas, can be distracted for a short time, will investigate noises)
- loot system is very interesting.
- You can hunt animals and roast the (of course fire will attrackt every enemy in the vicinity)
- Some coments are just hillarious.
- Five unique styles of islands (that you can choose)
- Stealth is balanced and it is the only way of winning the game as the ammo is quite a rare treat.
- Design of the robots is just awesome.
- Save system is quite rare, that adds to the thrill.
- Graphics are not amazing, but sound system is awesome+ startled animals ma help giving away the hunters' location.
- Starting calsses with different items on start (i personally advise ""cook"" because the game is harder that way and more thrilling)
- Four weapons (blunderbuss, rifle,shotgun, revolver) that are quite rare themselves, each with unique charecteristics and ammo types+plus carried by different robots.
- Tentacles!!!! For lovers of Hentai anime. (I personally call them ""Hentai tentacles"")
- Desent multiplayer, but most of the serves are pasworded (just so you know)
- A lot of loot, food, junk, strange items.
- Ratings and adjustable number of enemies on each island.
- interesting objective with a spark of a challenge.

To sum up, Sir you are being hunted is a greatand stable game, that can be both enjoyed alone and with friends.

Durchgeknallte Roboter auf Hasenjagd im Inselland, gepaart mit knallharter R√§tsel-Stealth-Shooter-Action und a lot of britishness. Ein Survivalspiel zum schmunzeln und zum lieben. (Man ist der Hase.^^)

Nach etwa 7h das erste Mal, mit der ersten von mehreren Startklassen des Charakters, ""durchgespielt"", hier aber auch nicht wirklich alles erkundet und gesehen.
Man startet auf einer von 5 Inseln und ist von blutr√ºnstigen, aber sehr britischen Robotern umgeben, welche Jagd auf Menschen, und manchmal auch auf sich selbst machen. Um der ganzen Misere zu entfliehen, muss man alle Teile eines magischen Steins wiederbeschaffen und sie zusammentragen. Hier liegt aber auch schon der Hase (oder Mensch) im Pfeffer, denn diese sind Zahlreich und gut von den (nicht ganz so) rostigen Kollegen bewacht, auf allen 5 Inseln, welche bei jedem Spiel wieder komplett neu und zufallsgeneriert erstellt werden, verstreut und das Inventar ist so knapp bemessen, dass man mit Sicherheit mehrmals laufen muss.
Ein kurzweiliger und lustiger Spielspa√ü, mit liebevollen Details, lustigen M√∂glichkeiten, britschem Humor, verschiedenen Gegner- und Spielerarten und einem genialen Soundtrack im Abspann, f√ºr den es sich alleine schon lohnt, es mehrmals zu spielen! 
Multiplayer gibts auch noch. Alles in Allem ein solides und packendes Game mit Wiederspielwert.

A very good survival game, but i do wish it was either $10 to $15. This game is very good and in an overall rating, i rate it a 8/10, now lets look at the pros and cons.

 Pro's

Everythings British
It's multiplayer
It has a different feel that most
You can change what robots are enabled and not
You can change what area is what
You can change what difficulty the robots are at
Classes!
Something different than any other survival
Small storyline
I believe you can finish the game
(There is more small things!)

 Con's

I don't believe its worth the $20, should be $15 to $10. (Don't let that discourage you, and thats my opinion.)
Robots are a bit op
A bit hard to set up
When you fall in water, you have to find a shore to get out, even then a kraken is gonna murder you.
You cannot defend yourself until you get a gun, not sure if there is melee.
No shelter building. (I believe.)
(More small things.)

You could go full Rambo and go into massive firefights with the enemy robots, or stick to a slower, calmer and more stealthy way of playing.


Pros:
The game is extremely atmospheric and can downright make the player jump at every noise they hear.

The Robots have some pretty good AI and will be relentless in later points of any given game.

I haven't had trouble with the Multiplayer and it is very enjoyable when playing with someone else (talking to them via a voice chatting app or program is recommended).


Cons:

Graphics aren't out-of-this world in quality (This is a minor detail, overlook this if you don't care about visuals).

The Wisps aren't explained at all and will easily confuse new players. Wisps send you to pieces of The Device.

(except for being robots and the homicidal intent part).  

The core gameplay loop is pretty solid, though not entirely perfect.  Stealth games rely on controlling the tension between the calm and chaos, and there are some rough edges in the loop.  As with many stealth games, audio cues and enemy animations play a significant role in determining the state of the enemy AI.  As such, some audio cues and animations were somewhat ambiguous, or seemed ambiguous.  For instance, robots in a heightened awareness who are facing away from you will nevertheless spot you immediately if your visibiility was above some unknown threshold.  Such behavior limits some strategies that were seemingly designed by the developers (i.e. throw a bottle, walk behind them); or perhaps the developers coded these behaviors so that these strategies would not be too effective?  While such AI behavior does detract from the immersiveness, it does artificially add to the tension, which feels cheap.

Also, sometimes robots would get into firefights among themselves; it's unclear what causes this, which is a shame.  One of the greatest feelings in any game, stealth or otherwise, is using the game systems to cause your enemies to wipe each other out.  Since the game makes these conditions opaque, you have no way of causing such firefights.    

Another complaint I had with the game was the UI.  It could have been streamlined a lot more.  For instance, while rooting a building, there's no option to take all useful items or discard all useless items, only the option to take everything.  Or on a map, I can only place three markers.  

SYABH is also certainly nice on the eyes.  During the moments when I wasn't chased by these robots, I found myself admiring the idyllic countryside.  Although this game doesn't have the bells and whistles in graphics as the latest AAAA titles, I was nevertheless impressed by the beautiful environments (which only required low system requirements!)  The character models were likewise exceptional, evoking charm and characteristics of british archtypes.  

Overall, I would highly recommend this game if you like stealth games, like killing homicidal robots, and/or are an anglophile.",1453307348,1453307348,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Sir you are being hunted is a pretty unique game. You play in a randomly generated world that consists of 5 islands. The objective is simply to obtain all the ""artifact fragments"" on each island. There are about 9 on the main (Middle) island and 3-4 on each small island. In doing so, you have to avoid robot hunters, their robot dogs, and other enemies, as well as eat.  

The game focuses mainly on exploration and stealth. It is very unique and works - for the most part.


PROS:
- Randomly generated levels where you can set the parameters. So lots of replay value.
- Stealth works well. Even if you are spotted, it is very possible to run away and recover.
- Lots of items and loot.  Use what suits your fancy.

Cons:
- While there IS a map (you have to find it) and the game DOES tell you how many artifacts are left on each island, it doesnt do a great job at documenting what you have searched. I wish it had some sort of map painting feature where i could color the map to mark off things.
- The fragments are in random locations (which is fine) and marked by (white) smoke and (usually) 2 robots. Still, most of your time is spent literally wandering in circles looking for them. This brings me back to the map suggestion. This isnt necessarily bad thing, but some people might find it offputting.",1453016299,1453058564,True,1,0,0.518181800842285156,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You just want to keep popping quarters into a cabinet everytime you die (that's making me sound old, isn't it?  Well google it you millenial brats, it'll make sense).

Seriously though, pip pip and cheerio to the team that put this game together.  I was never a big multiplayer fan, but even THAT draws me in!    

ONE Complaint:  In the story mode, there's these GIANT BEAST THINGS accompanyed by little 'short bus robots' (that's what they seem like anyhow).  They're not in the multiplayer :(

Three Suggestions: First, I'd like to see those Giants and Short Bus Robots (and maybe even some larger / MORE gigantic ones) added for multiplayer as options to pepper the game with. 

Second,  I know the game is about stealth over confrontation, but maybe ONE giant big bad that enough bullets can take down?  How crazy is it to tackle a giant robot while other robots, scarecrows, and dogs are messing with you at the same time?  THAT. CRAZY.

Finally: Capture the flag TEAM mode?  I've noticed going into multiplayer it's everyone for themsleves / only one person can leave.  Can you guys create a team mode, or even a Team vs Team mode, where all members of your team need to be 'checked in' to The Stones before you can leave?  THAT would be epic.  Especially if it's 3 on 3 with cowboy corral showdowns at the stones and lootable bodies.

[b]This it's not like other games of its genre, i mean, in other games you escape from zombies, aliens and even robots, but what about british robots ?[/b]

[u]Sir, You are being hunted[/u], is an indie stealth sandbox, in which after you (for a strange reason) create a time machine you got teleported to a twisted dimension in which english robots control the earth, as the new supreme race they will not rest until eliminate the humanity. 
[b]The hunting season has begun.[/b]

The objective here it's collect some kind of magical stones and retrieve it to a monolith to return home, not an easy task. 

[b]About gameplay mechanics, Sir, You are being hunted gives to you the option of generate your own world in which you will be chased, mountain landscapes, rocky highlands, a woodland, etc, [i]just choose your grave.[/i][/b]

[b]Something that i loved is the great variety of enemies, you will never be bored of this, trust me, this game has [u]since the classic weak enemies up to a big badass robot.[/u][/b]

[i]The background sound can be boring sometimes if you aren't being chased, but when you're in trouble music does its work and make those situations a great experience.[/i]

Graphically looks a bit odd but at the same time marvelous.

[b]This game definetily sounds like a great challenge and it is due the weird save system,[/b] the save point it's a boat and it's too far from the objective, if you don't put enough attention and you die you will have to begin again from your boat losing your progress, and yes you can save it as many times as you want, but with a big map, will you walk 5 mins each time you want to save ?

[h1]With tea and biscuits this game will make you hate a bit more the english robots (or even the poeple).[/h1]

[b]But the question is ... Did your head will be with the others in the smokestack or you will live to fight another day ?[/b]

There are a lot of good concepts in the game. A randomy generated world, an interesting survival-esque style of gameplay, and an odd setting in general to keep you on your toes.

However, the gameplay feels sluggish. Also, limited inventory space is something that is seldom fun in any game: but it's even less so when your main objective markers (that are literally scattered around the world) have to be carried back to the center of the world so often due to small inventory space. It's backtracking that artifically increases the length and difficulty of the game.

It's not a bad game. And depending on your tastes, you may end up liking it a lot. But it's certinly not a game that can appeal to the masses.

Long version: this game is a survival extreme game that takes the term ""survival of the fittest"" and replaces it with ""survival of the fanciest"". This game could be compared to DayZ or a game of the sort, but I believe it was done better. The game follows a simple yet complex survival algoritham. All items you obtain can be used in one way or another, and sometimes that use is not stated, and experimentation becomes more and more important as the game throws more and more variables at you. The game starts off simple enough: don't die, do a thing with some rocks. But as you get deeper and deeper in and the longer you take, the more complex the game becomes, forcing you to be creative, skillful, strategic, and quick-minded as you take on the growing complexity of the opponent, be it the environment or the other players in the multi-player. Really that in itself is good enough to make an amazing survival game, but it does not stop there! It gets even more amazing as you realize that the developers put enough time and work into the game to make sure there are no cheap wins or losses. The game is well balanced, and this is done by disabling water escape, punishing you for running from opponents, punishing you for assaulting opponents in the open (as opposed to assassinating them or ambushing them), and forcing you to reset... over... over... and over. The difficulty is sufficient to keep you on your toes but not harsh enough to make you give up completely. And because of the aforementioned lack of cheap deaths, you can learn something from every play through, and get a little better each time. Overall, a terrific game, and I'd even go so far as to say it should be the standard for all survival multi-players.

You're basically forced to keep moving all the time, because your vitality goes down constantly like you're a ticking bomb, and once your vitality hits zero your health is sapped away right then and there. In other words, you can and will drop dead just by standing and doing nothing. There are a lot of useless items to be found, and I made the mistake of eating a rat, thinking that it would restore a tiny amount of vitality, but I suffered for it. Aside from the robots on foot, there are also hot air balloons, hunting dogs... To top it all off, you can only save at the standing stones or the boat, and only if you're not bleeding or starving. All in all, it's not what I imagined the game might be like from watching the trailer. But I could easily see it being very fun and engaging for people who like games where they feel pressured, so I wouldn't not recommend it, because as far as I'm concerned it does successfully create a good atmosphere where you do feel like you're being hunted. Still, I wouldn't really recommend it for the more anxious people out there.

Die verschiedenen Inseltypen haben alle ihre eigene Stimmung. Wenn dann auch noch der Tag/Nachtwechsel dazukommt, wundersch√∂n.

Leider bin ich wohl nicht so der Schleicher. Allzu viele Fragmente habe ich noch lange nicht gefunden - und ich bin schon 9 Mal oder so gestorben - weil ich es immer noch nicht lassen kann, um die Roboter konsequent einen Bogen zu machen. 
Aber wer nicht h√∂ren will muss f√ºhlen - oder am letzten Speicherpunkt wieder starten. ;o)

Wahrscheinlich finden einige die beiden Speicherm√∂glichkeiten nicht genug, da nur an Booten und am Steinkreis gespeichert werden kann. Doch deswegen w√§re es halt besser, sich durchzuschleichen und nicht mit jedem einzelnem Roboter anzulegen.

Ich habe bis jetzt 5 verschieden Robotertypen gesehen + den Patrouillenballon, habe aber noch keine Ahnung, was der einzelne Robotertyp f√ºr sich macht. Von den J√§gern und dem Hund mal abgesehen.

Mir gef√§llt das Spiel - und ich finde, es hat definitv mehr Aufmerksamkeit verdient.

It balances all the great aspects of a stealth survival including the occasional terror (those damn patrol squads just come out of no where sometimes) and atmosphere (which is really well established early on, and even more established with the new enemies and their arrivals).

Par contre, n‚Äô√©tant pas un fervent joueur de jeux d‚Äôinfiltration, il est aussi possible que je sois simplement tr√®s mauvais √† ce jeu. 

Bref, dans ¬´ Sir, You Are Being Hunted ¬ª, vous n‚Äô√™tes pas un pr√©dateur cach√© dans l‚Äôombre, vous √™tes une proie, une proie avec tr√®s peu de moyens √† sa disposition pour fuir ses funestes pr√©dateurs et ce d√©tail peut vous faire compl√®tement abhorrer ce jeu.

Comme autre d√©faut majeur, le fait que chaque carte est g√©n√©r√©e de fa√ßon proc√©durale rend l‚Äôunivers de ce jeu vide, artificiel et mort, il s‚Äôagit peut-√™tre d‚Äôun choix des d√©veloppeurs, mais √† certains moments je m‚Äôennuie ferme de marcher dans des zones quasi vierges de vie biologique et compos√©es de lieux beaucoup trop semblables.

Pour finir, je trouve que le contenu de ¬´ Sir ¬ª est trop fam√©lique pour son prix. De mon point de vue, son prix devrait √™tre de cinq dollars et il serait acceptable qu‚Äôil soit vendu √† un prix de dix dollars, mais certainement pas √† vingt dollars. √Ä r√©server √† ceux qui aiment le concept de traque et qui ne sont pas rebut√©s par les d√©cors aussi creux que la fosse des Mariannes.",1451321980,1451322001,False,1,0,0.5,0,False,False,False,False,,,

White in color, but with tinges of green with mold, and also black from fires. My heart was pounding. My stomach was growling. A thousand thoughts racing through my mind as I saw a fire pit. My stomach told me to cook some food over it, but my mind told me not to draw attention to myself with smoke. I walked around the property, slowly checking around corners to see if a mustachioed robot gentleman would be there waiting for me. But alas, none were spotted. I carefully tiptoed back to the fire pit to cook food to appease my rumbling stomach. I took the matches and lit the fire. 
""*VRRP* WHAT'S THAT? *CLANK*""
A robot was indeed near me. I quickly threw a rock over his head hoping he would be distracted, but he was not. His sights were aimed at me, and his only concern was that I was still breathing. I drew my revolver and fired off two shots. I still don't know if either hit their target because immediately afterward, I turned around and began running through the gap in the charred walls. 
I spotted a tree and immediately ran behind it. I could hear two robots now. Their clanging joints sounded like the bells ringing to mark the time of my death. I stepped from behind the tree and fired three bullets into the iron torso of one. I then felt a hot, stinging pain in my side. I'd been shot. The other robot was rushing toward me to avenge his fallen comrade. I knew i only had one bullet left. I darted from behind the tree and pulled the trigger.
The bullet rang true! The hot lead surged through the metallic skull cavity of the machine that was hunting me. I was safe!
Or was I?
I was surrounded by the sounds of beeps and whirs and clanks and I soon saw that four new robotic foes were upon me. I put my revolver in its holster and began running. Hot lead flew past me and all around me as i sprinted away from my pursuers. I came to another set of houses, but this was no time to stop and loot. Those robots meant business. Their bullets still whizzing past me, I ran through the houses into the rocky hills by the ocean. After many deep breathes to restore the oxygen to my lungs, i was left with four words that filled up my mind.

If you like stealth or even mild horror games you are likely to enjoy this. The atmosphere and tension the game creates makes you think twice before you try and loot a house or steal a fragment and this is what makes it unique. It manages to create an atmosphere which many othe games are unable o achieve. The graphical design is almost perfect even if the graphics them selves are no so good. The bots themselves are very challenging, you'll spend more time distracting the bots than you will killing them. Especially towards the end of the game where the bots get brutal.

Pros:

+Great Atmosphere (I know I have already said that a lot)
+Great AI (even if a bit brutal)
+Good variety of bots.
+Pretty landscape.
+Different map every time.
+Large variety of methods to distract/ kill the bots.
+Multiplayer is extremely fun, you can either play PvP or Coop (Coop still has a bit of competitiveness to it).

Cons:

-Stealth is very hard (maybe it's just me).
-Villages can look very similar (you may need to read the village name to work out which ones you have been to).
-Gives you a swetty mouse :)
-A bit to expensive for ¬£15 (should be ¬£10 max), buy on sale.

I find it difficult and slow. It's very common within this game to run into more enemies than you can handle. Therefor progress it hindered by going back to the last save you made. That save point is one postion on the entire map. You can go wandering off looking around, die and be sent thrown back to the save. 

Basically I am looking for five stones on the first island. I got one after dying a few times. I died before I got it back to centre stone where you take it and save. next time I played I couldn;t remember where it was or in which direction. Then the time after that I found the stone again. I got it back safe this time. 

However this is how the whole game goes. I have gradually after many time starting the game to play a bit more, found another two stones. Yet I have no idea where I found them, so I have no idea where not to look again. Since it goes so slowly and you quit-out of disblelief, by the time you play again you have forgotten.

A simplistic and straight forward open-world survival game. The game starts with a dull naration which isn't humorous, trying too hard to have the British slang and painfully slow.

You are placed into an island where you need to collect parts to escape while avoiding robots. You have to constantly scavenge for fresh edible food to keep your vitality (which is basically hunger) up. This will help you regain health when taken damage. The island is rather barren and dull with tonnes of props and houses heavily reused (you can obviously see the pattern). The island is plagued with robots that are constantly on the lookout for you. There seem to be multiple type of bots including a hot air baloon and dogs but really they don't make much difference.

Weapons and ammos are scarce but trust me it really don't make much of a different. You may need to travel to other island via boat to look for more parts but those island just seemed rather similar to me. I joined a multiplayer (you don't actually get to interact with other players) game where all places have been scavanged with only 1 cloth and 1 drink in my inventory with 2 more parts to collect. One of this part is guarded by 2 hunter and a dog. I practically waltz in crouching, pick the part and ran off without taking damage (yes they spotted me but I just ran). That is how bad the A.I. is.

After 5 minutes into the game I've already seen everything the game has to offer and got really bored because actions occured too little and the game is just plain dull with the pace set.

If you are really into games like these, this can be decent for you with no visible bugs or even hiccups and the multiplayer seem to have dedicated server (in EU) but with 200+ ping I can still play smoothly; otherwise steer clear (I had to leave this game overnight to collect the trading cards since I spent 5 hours into the game and not a single drop).",1450507517,1450507517,False,17,3,0.538280665874481201,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Maybe a better comparison would be the old S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trilogy.  Inventory management is very similar, there's a lot of worthless junk in the world like Bethesda RPG's, but you'll be forced to prioritze between nourishment and weapons as you progress through the game.

What makes SYABH unique is surely the English country-side art style, with all the Victorian robots running around.  The designs are not over-designed, if that makes sense.  Their comical dialog, and gentleman's dress code really adds a sense of comedicness to the bleak, foggy marshes and hills that dot the islands you explore.  Unfortunately though, for all their charm the robots are just as freaking deadly.  

The game gives you a chance to save your progress semi-regularly, but the fear of death is still very real as you can end up losing nearly an hour of progress and restarting back on a beach.  This might sound like a challenge but it really emphasives how stressful the game can become, especially as you proceed and the robots begin to spawn in bigger masses with deadlier tools in their belts.  I've sat for nearly 15 minutes in the grass just waiting for patrols to die down so I can get back to the freaking boat.  

I actually had to take a break from games for a few days after completing the final island of the main story purely because of how stressful the robots become.  They shouldn't be scary, but they become terrifying.  The land owner robot rivals Slenderman in terms of terrifying stalker material.  An invcible giant that makes high pitched squeels, and will follow you relentlessly once he spots you.  

I played on one of the easier starting load outs with a randomly generated set of islands, though you're free to choose your starting loadout from several presets.  You can even manually adjust what types of islands and robots you'll receive in your playthrough.  With all that in mind, I can't really think of anything this game does wrong.  You are equipped the tools to configure it to your suiting right out of the box.  There's no crafting system like other major open world titles, but the game doesn't really suffer for it.  

If you enjoy sandbox experiences, especially from a first person perspective, you won't regret putting this on your wish list.",1449955410,1449955410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The creepiest game I own in my Library.
Sir, You Are Being Hunted is quite the long title, so I'll abbreviate it. Let's keep it at ""Sir"".
Well, let's get to it then.

Pros:

-Very atmospheric.
-Very creepy. Like, pretty damn creepy.
-Acceptable graphics for indie standards.
-Very DayZ-like looting, it works.
-Easy to understand mechanics.
-Wide arsenal of traps and distractions, creating a fair game.
-Multiplayer is fun. Unlike DayZ, you don't get shot on sight, or at least, not often.
-Great boat-system, creating multiple areas to go to.
-Variety of classes to choose from, which you wouldn't expect in a survival-game.

Cons:

-Sometimes feels unfair; you always have to be on the run.
-Not alot of weapons to choose from.
-Not really that cheap. I got it during the Autumn Sale for ‚Ç¨3.99 (translates to $4.40/3.50 Pounds)
-Multiplayer doesn't add much; basebuilding would greatly increase the fun you could have with your friends.
-Most of the time, your inventory is stuffed with bottles. aka The loot usually sucks ass.
-You don't really get anything for taking down robots.
-Loot shouldn't just be in houses, this doesn't give you much of a choice of where to go.

It's kill, or be killed.

But about an hour in, I give the game a 9/10

Replay Value
Atmosphere
Great Soundtrack(Atmospheric and scary)
Good Loot system
Good Gunplay
Good Melee

Das Spiel sieht nach mehr aus, als es ist. Denn es ist tot langweilig.
2/10

Als ""Sir, You Are Being Hunted"" zum ersten Mal bei mir in Steam auftauchte gefiel es mir und alles was ich dar√ºber las/sah/h√∂rte. Ich habe es dann beim Sale f√ºr einen Appel und ein Ei gekauft und habe mich auf den Multiplayer gefreut.
Zu Beginn hat es mir gro√üen Spa√ü gemacht durch das hohe Gras zu schleichen und zu versuchen Roboter vom Objekt weg zu locken, welches man um zu gewinnen zu einem Sammelpunkt transportieren muss. Doch sehr schnell wurde mir bewusst, dass das Spiel nicht mehr als eben dieses beinhaltet: Es gibt gro√üe leere Fl√§chen ohne Loot, H√§user in denen man nichts findet und die man noch nicht mal betreten kann. Nicht zu vergessen, die teilweise strohdoofe K.I. denen man oft einfach davon rennen kann und die einen manchmal sehen ohne, dass man sichtbar ist oder sie sieht.
All dies lies mich den Kauf dieses Spiels schnell bereuhen.",1448402637,1448402637,False,1,0,0.434782594442367554,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The objective is to hunt down teleporter pieces, which are necessary to win, while you are constantly being hunted by robots.

For the positive aspects of this game, the islands are all randomly generated, the artificial intelligence is good, sneaking aroud is fun, and setting up decoys and traps makes it interesting.

One very minor bug I have noticed is that the water robots are sometimes able to come up through the ground on small islands, which can hurt you.

Multiplayer is currently PVP (Player vs. Player) only, but you can still team up if you wish. There can only be one winner, though.

Literally. You have to find all 20 artifacts and bring them back to some rocks where you spawn. All the while you are being hunted by a bunch of british robots! Its awesome! This is the only game where you can experience the horror, and hillarity, of being chased around by, hunters, dogs, balloons, (FYI I have more on the list) sea monsters, robo kids, no serieously the robo kids are terrifying. Their robo parents let them run around with guns!

This is a horror/comedy game with a little FPS (First Person Shooter) thrown in. You can loot houses for weapons and supplies, and some other things. (I once found a dead rat, true story) but you have to do so QUETLY. 

Rules for Sir You Are Being Hunted:

#1. Long grass is your best freind.

#2. Speak in a british accent while your playing

#3. If you see a cute little dogy, DONT PET IT. IT WILL BITE YOUR ARM OFF.

#4. If you find haggas dont throw is away because its a sheep's insides cooked to perfection. Its actually quite tasty. (not)

#5. Folllow the rule ""Dont go towards the light."" Because that light is a search blimp.

And final rule: Stay hidden.

You are tasked with collecting the teleporter pieces to get home. Fighting off starvation is no where near the biggest threat though,

 The islands are inhabited by a race of genocidal dapper ""gentlebots"", as you wander the ruins of what once seemed to be a productive human civilization they will hunt you for sport. ducking through thick brush, dodging the ""mantraps"" of poachers, the scent hounds of the hunter bots, and the ever present eyes of the hot air balloons searching for even the smallest sign of your location, you will never be safe.

Thats just a small helping of what is to come now that you have become stranded on these strange ""robo-isles"", not even the ocean is safe here, being constantly patrolled by a giant robo-leviathan. Your only way home is to get all the teleporter pieces, and it sure as heck is not going to be easy!



Thats not all to Sir, You Are Being Hunted though! Now with the addition of multiplayer you can hunt with your friends, or heck, even just hunt your friends! Battle for survival with multiple players on a custom island in multiplayer! It is something I enjoy about Sir a great deal since I started playing.

good sound design, good visuals, good theme... my only qualms are the sometimes-wonky procedural land generator (i once had a dock surrounded entirely by land without any connection to the ocean), the horribly unbalanced riders (how the heck do you evade them? can you even?0, and the F***** SEA MONSTER (for example, i'm trying to get in the boat and leave because i'm being chased by sixteen hunters, seventeen dogs, and the landowner, but it decides to pop up in the middle of the dock, literally in the middle of the dock, and insantly kill me). other than the sometimes-infuriating bugs and glitches (and the overly simplistic and somehow simultaneously unfair ai in some cases), i have a lot of fun playing this game.

it's not gonna be for everyone. it's brutal, punishing, unfair, and will make you wish you were dead. it will destroy you for the slightest mistake, error in judgment, or misclick causing you to accidentally destroy your food and make you starve to death. oops. i'd put this on the same level as the ensign or lord of the rings: the third age on hard or metro 2033 redux survival hardcore in terms of difficulty. or i guess dark souls. and the worst part is the procedural generation will screw you over more than the tactics of the enemy hunters (which basically consist of 'shoot each other' or 'only look in one direction' or 'not pay attention to my buddies behind me getting hacked to bits by a starving axe-wielding robophobic british man or lady'). but even with all that, it's a great game because these aren't bugs, they're features. and the difficulty is definitely worth it just for the end credits.

also they added multiplayer, but i haven't played that yet. i'd like to. infinite replayability and all that.",1445941902,1445941902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I scurry into a forest after the sound of a squadron falls upon my ears; I am in no condition to fight. I wander the forest for a little bit, helplessly watching my vitality droop into the low thirties. I need food, drink, anything. 

And fast.

After crawling through the forest for a few minutes, I hear humming. There is a lone robot here. I scope out the immediate area, hoping to set course away from certain doom. Upon laying eyes on the beast, however, I sit in place, carefully calculating where it was traveling.

For it was passing an unlooted shack.

I watch the shack and robot from above, for I was stationed on a hill just out of sight. My vitality is hitting the low teens. This shack was is last shot at life, for any village would be too far to not starve. This is my last chance, and I need to spend it wisely. I note the robot's steady patrol around the shack, and sprint when he rounds the corner away from the door. I do not care if I am seen; I could run after I retrieved any food in the shack, and any other course of action would leave me dead.

A meter or so away, I note that I can no longer hear the robot humming. This was either my lucky day, or my last. I got within a few decimeters of the door, so close to life once more.

Snap

That is all I hear, and all I need to hear. I am dead. The abrupt and loud snap and accompanying crunch can only mean one thing.

I quickly look down to inpect my injured shin, shattered by a perfectly placed bear trap. I quickly try to undo the traps mechanisms, to free myself and run. I am interupted by a loud click above my head, to which I stand up to identify. I am greeted by the barrel of a large gun, and then by a bright light and darkness. I can feel the ground as I land, I feel it welcome me to a long, peaceful slumber. As I fall into eternal sleep, I am greeted with a lullaby, a familiar song that I am unable to name. It was unsettling, however in the way it was sung, or rather, hummed.

But I'm not impressed. Sir/Madam, You Are Being Hunted promises that each playthrough is unique, but in my experience not a single playthrough has been unique. You might be looking at the screenshots and saying to yourself 'Hey those robots look pretty good!' and you're right - but nothing else does. I sure hope you like the colors brown and grey, because that's the entire color palate. There are different seeds available, but within 10 minutes you've seen every house or castle or whatever on any given island because there simply aren't enough assets. 'But hey,' you might start, 'this is supposed to be drab and dreaery just like real England!' Aside from being a lame excuse to justify a bad art direction, perhaps that's why no one else makes games set in such boring locals.

Even if you try to ignore the graphics in favor of gameplay, you get a pretty unrewarding stealth game. For starters, the visibility gauge seems arbitrary. I swear I was about 10 meters away from a robot with two pips on the visibility gauge and I got by no problem. Same exact condition 5 minutes later? Instantly spotted. This is only compounded when robots are alerted and you find out they're psychic. And did I mention the combat sucks? You don't start off with any weapons and when you get lucky enough to find one, it feels awful. 'But it's a stealth game!' some fool is going to say. True, it is, but classics like Thief and Deus Ex gave you a bunch of different options to avoid combat that all felt refined AND both games start you off with a weapon that's useful, if only occasionally. If you fire a gun in Sir/Madam, you've already lost, and if you find a hatchet you've already won. It all comes down to RNG, which oddly enough, doesn't mind giving you loads of consumables making the survival aspect a formality.

Eventually you get to experience the horrible checkpoint system. You can save whenever you return one of the stone pieces to the altar and when you go between islands. That's it. Be prepared to run upwards of five minutes just to get back where you died so you can restart again. Did I say run? I meant crawl, because running makes you visible from miles around. Realistic, but not even slightly fun. And with movement comes the weird camera bob/lean. Whenever you move with the keyboard, your character leans in that direction like he just pounded down a six pack. I've never had problems with motion sickness in video games before, but this one makes my head throb.

Multiplayer is the same thing but minus the mechanics. Everyone runs around like it's team death match in unreal tournament and eventually wins through sheer luck. And if you die? Hey no problem just respawn and you don't lose any progress!

I've been looking forward to play this game since it entered Early Access but resisted the temptation. I recently got it as part of a Humble Bundle and I still feel ripped off.",1445388279,1445388279,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Tout d'abord ce jeu est un FPS rogue like, la map n'est jamais la m√™me et vous pouvais m√™me la customiser a votre sauce (que se soit pour les lieux ou pour les ennemis).
Vous commencez donc votre partie et la un truc deja tre choquant d'entr√© : c'est moche, c'est m√™me vraiment vraiment moche ! D'habitude les mauvais graphismes ne me derangent pas dans un jeu donc je me suis dit ""ok c'est pas trop grave temps que le gameplay y est, tout va bien""
Maintenant le jeu: tres t√¥t vous allez recuperer un artefact que vous allez devoir ramener au point de depart, cette artefact prends beaucoup de place dans l'inventaire (tres bon systeme d'inventaire au passage) ce qui vous oblige a en prendre 1 ou 2 a la fois et la on a le gros bemol du jeu. En gros vous allez devoir parcourir la map pendant DES HEURES (sans rire) pour trouver les 17 artefacts du jeu en sachant que en plus il y a 5 zones au total. C'est d'ailleurs pour √ßa que le fait que les graphismes soit aussi moches est vraiment derangent, si a la limite on se baladais dans une map magnifique comme dans The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, le cot√© simulateur de marche ne m'aurais pas d√©reng√© mais la c'est vraiment perturbant.
Enfin je ne pouvais pas conclure cette critique sans vous parler des ennemis: Dans ce jeu il y a tr√©s peu d'armes, encore moins d'armes √† feu et je ne parle m√™me pas des munitions du coup le jeu oblige a utliser la furtivit√©, prendre certains chemins pour √©viter les ennemis et fuir des que l'on est reper√©. MAIS car il y a un mais, c'est que les ennemis ont des armes a feu et que √ßa met 3 plombes pour finalement les semer, tout en sachant qu'il y a 2 enemis a cot√© de chaques artefacts, que l'on ne peut pas sauvegarder a tout moment et qu'une balle a possibilit√© de causer une hemoragie ce qui fait diminuer votre vie petit a petit, je vous laisse deviner l'arrachage de cheuveux.
Du coup est ce que je conseil ce jeu ? Non, dans la theorie c'est excelent (Rogue like/Survie/Exploration/Infiltration), dans la pratique c'est vraiment decevant et personnellement je trouve √ßa vraiment pas terrible. Apres ce n'est que mon avis et a en juger les 84% de commentaires positif le jeu a beaucoup plu mais pour moi √ßa a √©t√© une enorme deception.

-Original art design.
-Analog rain. (as opposed to Minecraft's digital rain) Actually pleasant.
-Procedurally gererated world for replayablity.

Definitely for those that enjoy a bit of heavy stealth along with running for your goddamn life!

Difficulty curve was quite steep at first. You will have to come to your own realization how to best handle every different encounter with your hunting adversaries. Hunters will be the most often encountered, I highly reccommend not engaging any group of three or more unless its late game and you have the very rare rifle with ammunition to spare. Far more often than not, discretion will be the better part of valor, think about the reward versus the risk. You can only save at the center of the beginning island and any boat dock.  They have unlimted units while you have.. well, admittedly unlimiited lives. But hey! You probably want the best ending score right?!

With the axe, if you're lucky enough to find one, you can circle strafe around one or two hunters until you hear them let off both barrels with their shotgun, then quickly close straight in for the kill! Don't let them backpedal, sprint. Make sure to check your surroundings, might be that a hunting party or two heard the shots and are now zeroing in on your position. If its safe, then loot them bitches for a possibly working shotgun and bonus items. Traps are one of the best items in the game, learn to use them!

Honestly wouldn't bother with poachers at all. I killed a few when they first showed up but their blunderbuss, while insanely powerful at close range, seemed unnecessary seeing as how a single shot required a 2x1 space in your inventory. And basically underperformed with dynamite which seemed far more worth carrying for tough enemies, as in squires or horse riders, or groups of softies guarding fragments.

So far I've had a couple of super-entertaining and tense 2-player LAN sessions of this game. We were both very drawn in to the aesthetic and the unease the landscapes create.

The sounds and ambience are decent too (though the narrator in single-player is a little immersion-breaking and irratating).

Toward that end you will sneak around, loot houses (or more precisely their doors),  shoot overly pesky robot hunters, and dodge those that can't be so easily dealt with.  There are 5 islands to explore per game, all proceedurally generated from general parameters you choose, on average 3 bits per island, and several different starting loadouts (occupations?) to experiment with.  The numbers of robots and and their type escalates as you gather more pieces until they become so numerous that stealth becomes tedious and combat a little overwhelming.  Still, with hit and run tactics or distractions you can still outmaneuver the robots whose AI is *usually* not that dilligent or perceptive.  If you manage to reassumble your device you are treated to a short in-game animation followed by static credits and a decent song.  I spent a little less than 5 hours beating the game my first time.  MP seems a bit too PVP focused, and doesn't currently use Steamworks so it's currently a bit questionable.  I would have liked to see more variety of loot, additional story elements to flesh out the narrative, and slightly more rifle ammo in loot caches, but none of those held back my enjoyment of my initial playthrough.

After playing this game for an extended period and then turning it off, I had a real ""coming out of the cave"" moment. I felt relieved to be back in reality where I'm not the only living human, robots aren't hunting me, and the weather doesn't constantly suck. 

Funny thing is, I'm really looking forward to coming back to that world in my next play session. It seriously feels like a warzone, but not the kind you'd see in Modern Warfare. It's the kind you'd see in Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"".  Buildings are falling apart and the environment is dusky and depressing. Sometimes the silence is punctuated by a fire fight off in the distance as bots start infighting with each other. It's a dangerous environment where you rarely get a chance to relax. 

And then the game gets unsettling. When you hear an unearthly.....""sound"" off in the distance and see a giant landowner limping about with its two guard dog bots following. Or when you get impatient and attract the attention of a squad of bots when you're low on ammo. They know you're there, and they relish in the hunt. Which is made apparant by their creepy robotic laughter as they creep ever closer to your hastily chosen and flimsy hiding spot. And after waiting with baited breath with your finger on the trigger as a bot just barely uncovers your hiding place, you hear a siren go off and the area around you bathed in red light. Turns out you weren't paying attention to the balloon sentry floating around the area, and now you have to make a split second decision. Fight for your life, or try to run and hide, hoping that any bullets that penetrate your backside don't do enough damage to end you. Because it's been an hour since you last saved at the waypoint, and it would be terrible to have to find all those hard earned items again. 

I'm not kidding when I say that this very scenario happened to me. I have the sweat that was accumulating on my brow to prove it. I just barely managed to escape with just 2 points of health remaining, and my heart didn't stop pounding until well after I managed to get back to the waypoint to save. It's a kind of terror that is rooted in reality. I would've lost a ton of items if I had died. God knows what would've happened if I had decided to stand and fight. 

The ""brutally funny"" description that the developers decided to go with puzzles me. Because at least for me, this game is one of the most tense and stressful experiences I've had in awhile.

Dont answer, I know this is everyone's dream.

Look no further! This game will take care of all of your needs. Want to hide around the corner from a squad of robot hunters while sipping lukewarm tea? Now you can! Strike fear into the hearts of your enemies by equipping everyone in your game with a trumpet and stroll through the streets, sounding off the war horn, warning all the robots of their incoming demise.

I remember it like it was yesterday, *BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRR* *BURRRRRRRRRRRRRR* *BUUUUURRRRRRR* We took down countless robots trying to gather the pieces of the teleporter all while keeping our spirits up with the lively trumpet of freedom. Living off of the food we scrounged together, mainly wisky and tea, we kept our strenght at maximum. We all had our designated weapons of choice. I was the shotgun specialist with an axe and no regard for the law. Near the end of our struggle to escape, we came across an ammo supply shortage during our biggest battle yet. Thankfully we never lost our morale due to the constant *BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRR* our trumpeter played, both to keep us from retreating from the robot scum and to strike fear into their hearts. We started to take casualties due to having to make the fight more upclose and personal, but we never stopped the trumpet. The trumpet is a symbol of freedom, of hope. The last one of us starts to make a break for it towards our safe zone, littered with traps and stocked full of supplies. Not once did he let up on that trumpet. At this point it was just so that the robots wouldnt lose track of him into our turf. The trumpeter makes it into the ruins of a large building surrounded by small walls, filled with bear traps. This is the last stand. We need to let the world know. He climbs to the top of the pile of rubble in the center of the ruins and... *BUUUUrrrrrRRRrRRrRRrrRRrRRrrRrrRRrrRR*. Robots stepping on traps left and right. Never once letting go of that trumpet. Never once giving up hope. Not once will we let up on the trumpet. Not once will we stop taunting them with our freedom. The last trap is sprung. A robot dog dashes up the rubble and tackles the trumpeter off of the top.

The battle is over, but we've left our mark.

___ Le but du jeu (solo) :

R√©cup√©rer tous les fragments d'une pierre se situant au centre de l'√Æle centrale.
Survivre et visiter les 4 √Æles qui entourent l'√Æle centrale.
A priori 2 fragments respectivement sur l'√Æle Nord, Ouest, Est et Sud.
La carte est recouverte de robots qui vous traque et le nombre de ces derniers augmente au fur et √† mesure que vous raporter des fragments au centre de la map. 

___  Les plus :

- L'ambiance visuel et sonore (m√™me si pour cette derni√®re on peu pr√©ciser que la musique est trop peu pr√©sente)
- L'aspect graphique/artistique du jeu

___ Les moins :

- Plantage au chargement de map
- Jeu non optimis√© ; moche de base et pourtant consomme beaucoup
- Sensibilit√© de souris carrement wtf ; tr√®s tr√®s lente au menu + inventaire et tr√®s tr√®s rapide √† la vis√©e in-game
- Escalier bugg√©s (biome Castle dans les tours)
- Rechargement revolver wtf (chargement de 6 balles pour un remplacement d'une balle)
- Impossibilit√© de mettre en racourci inventaire les talisman (bonus in-game du type ""etre invisible pendant X sec.)
- L'inventaire carrement pas pratique (cause de 50% des morts du jeu)
- Touches bugg√©s en mode multi (je pense aux A et au E pour se pencher par exemple ; mais il y en a d'autres)
- Pas de chat vocale en multi.
- Il faut re-r√©gler les options en multi ; le solo et le multi sont dif√©rienci√©s et donc les options ne sont pas synchro.

Conclusion :

Le jeu donne envie mais au final c'est plus un simulateur de randonn√© qu'autre chose.
En solo on s'ennui vite d'autant que la dificult√© du jeu est bas√©e sur un gameplay tout mou et mal foutu.
Le jeu nous occupe un apr√®m mais pas plus en solo et pourrait occuper une bande de pote en multi  ; mais pas plus.
En multi c'est du gros WTF ; les gens se co sur les serveurs, ils recup√®rent du loot, tirent dans le vide et au final se d√©connectent avec le stuff. Pendant se temps les robots sont bugg√©s et tire dans des buissons √† l'infini.
Au final personne ne va r√©cup√©rer les fragments pour reconstituer la stone au centre de la map.

Its okay If I were to rate it out of 10 I would give it a 5, why? because the game is quite boring after an hour or two. 

The stealth mechanic is okay not the best but good enough you will find tall grass to be your best friend. The ""Distraction"" system for me was fantastic and the most fun for me when playing this game, using items from simple bottles, to alarm clocks, toy trains etc...  to distract enemies was quite entertaining. The enemies themselves are funny looking and fit the theme, and you discover new enemies throughout your journey.

The objective is quite dull, you must collect Fragment pieces of the ""Device Teleporter"" and bring it back to the special Stone circle, the fragments themselves are scattered throughout the island, that being said the fragment pieces take up 16 inventory slots and its quite irritating having to travel back and forth to dump them at the stone to get rid of them.

The Landscape is okay but it tends to get quite repetative with structures. The looting system is a bit of a letdown for me, to obtain loot you must press ""F"" on a door and it has items (Occasionaly barrels etc..) there are no interiors for any building aswell which is quite stale. not to mention the textures of the building are of low detail which is dissapointing for this day n age, considering the environment looks better then the structures...

You don't sprint in this game, you jog.

*Multiplayer*: The Animations/Character model are quite lame and looks like they were put together in 10 minutes, not to mention the character customization is completely useless (You can only change hat n shirt).

I was fairly intrigured. But then I got in game.

There is a clear ""goal"" for this (collect all these missing parts) but there are what, 20 of them? In 5 HUGE sections? I couldn't even find one in about 30 minutes. If it is going to take me hours to find 1 part I don't want to even bother trying. On top of that, this goal isn't really satisfying and there are no shorter-term quests or anything so you lose track of objectives real quickly.

There are houses and stuff to loot, sure. I started out looting every single one. Then I realized that they are just randomized ""chests"" that give you the same garbage items 90% of the time (dead rat, broken plate, moldy bread, a rock). It is super time consuming to just go through one by one and loot every door when the reward is useless. My inventory filled up very quickly.

I got to a new area and finally found a pistol and a hatchet. Great. -Finally- some combat. I found some robots wandering. The combat was awful. Their AI is incredibly bad. You can walk right past them and they will be alerted and see you, but then they will take cover behind a house rendering them useless. They cover from you but end up making themselves do nothing since they are just hiding the whole time. There is no threat there. I ran out of my 6 pistol shots quickly and got bored again.

SUMMARY: this game just seems like a grind for the same objective over, and over, and over again. I don't see the gameplay evolving at all as you progress. Too boring for me. I will say the one thing I liked was the atmosphere. They definitely got the creepiness down.

Spawn back in, fucked off in the opposite direction of the spooky woods to a set of houses. I searched about 20 houses between the starting island and the East island and never found any kind of weapon...plenty of vitality foods and a few bandage, but no weapons.

This game is a bloody awesome spectacle of jiggery pokery. What what, cheerio, hip hip hooray for ""Sir, You are Being Hunted."" Graphics are a little ole school, circa 2007-ish. But what it lacks in sleek modern graphics it more than makes up for in addictive fun. Somewhat of a typical stealth game, but unique in its presentation. The complete lack of supplies makes this the ultimate challenge. You start with a handful of items, you pretty much have to figure out how things work for yourself, and you find so much useless junk that an empty bottle or rock you can throw suddenly becomes a great treasure. OMG, when you find an axe or a gun it's like the most epic loot ever.  

Basically you are a human (I think) trapped on a weird set of RANDOMLY GENERATED islands. How awesome is that for replayability. You look for these glowing meteorite-like rocks, then you have to lug them back to a certain location. So, no treasure hording, which I have to admit is very hard for an OCD dungeon sweeper like myself. You are constantly being hunted by clockwork robots with red glowing eyes, robot dogs, some weird stilt like creature, big ole robot constables, and more. You can stand and fight if you have weapons, but most of the time you have to use cunning and skill to sneak around them, distract them, or even lure them. 

Quite simply one of the better stealth games I have ever played. Simple, yet challenging. I grabbed it on sale for a pittance. But I would have gladly paid the full $20 if I had known it would be this much fun. I would easily put this up there with Thief, Dishonored, or any of the bad arse stealth games.",1444811403,1444811403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I finally bought it on sale for $2 and even had a friend buy it as well because multiplayer was a new feature. At first I was very excited. Sneaking around thruogh the tall grass and trying to lure some robots away from a smoldering item that you need to collect in order to win (there are quite a few of them around the map). After about 30 min I began to realize that there wasn't much more to it than that. Big empty fields with nothing to loot, houses that are just glorified item chests that you can't even enter, and dumb a.i. that are easy to just run away from made me really regret buying this game. 

TLDR;
The game looked like it was a lot of fun but turned out to be quite boring.

*Varying enemy types are quite interesting and their introductions are well-paced throughout the game (this can be configured to the player's specifications - I speak mainly of the default settings)
*Combat is balanced well enough - meaning that you while you can pick off a group of two or three hunters, anything more is a fool's errand and will attract too much attention in any case, forcing you to be stealthy for the majority of the game
*The game's atmosphere is great for creating tense moments, especially when hiding or evading pursuit
*Limited save system is effective in making you carefully consider any risks you take

Cons:
*The game gets repetitive by the third island - you won't change your playstyle much once you've got a gun, ammo, food
*Fragment placement can be quite stupid - one of the perils of a procedurally generated game - I found that often, fragments would spawn within sight of island entry points, incredibly near each other, or in one jaw-clenching instance, in an inccessible location, forcing me to abandon my first run, and on the very last fragment to boot
*Fragment detector makes the game go way too fast - starting with one on my second run after the aforementioned doomed run made that run last under two hours
*Survival elements may as well not exist - I never had to cook meat on a bonfire and was never in any sort of danger of running out of food, even with bare minimum scrounging
*Distraction items were never useful enough to let me avoid a fight at a guarded fragment
*While the game mechanics are robust enough to pull off many sneaky tricks (allowing the Squires to fight for you, setting and baiting traps for unwary robots, setting bonfires to draw attention away from guarded areas) none of them are really more practical than finding a good hiding place, waiting until there's only two guards and/or a dog, attracting their attention, strafing to avoid their first two shots, then giving them a buckshot sandwich while they reload, grabbing the fragment, and running away

But it's not my cup of tea. I expected more exploration and deeper management to the survival, but this seems to be a very distilled experience.

Klingt spannend. Ist es auch. Stimmungsvolle eher d√ºster gehaltene Grafik. Tag- und Nacht-Zyklen. Musik und Soundeffekte sind auch gut. Die Atmosphere wird wirkungsvoll aufgebaut und gehalten.

Leider passiert dann nichts mehr.
Mann kann keine Geb√§ude betreten. Schade, dabei sind eine ganze Menge da.
Die Bots in Fallen zu locken (was in dem Video cool aussieht) ist unverh√§ltnism√§ig aufw√§ndig, da sie dadurch nicht drauf gehen, sondern nur verz√∂gert werden. Es sind auch zu viele Roboter da.
Das das Inventar zu klein ist - kann ich verkraften.
Das die Map ein schlechter Witz ist - kann man dr√ºber hinweg sehen.
Roboter spawnen irgendwo in bereits ges√§uberten Gebieten - nervig.

Aber wo ist die Story? Wo ist mehr als schleichen, sammeln, ablenken oder schie√üen?
Der Survival-Faktor ist sehr klein - man nimmt erledigten Gegnern Essen ab, findet es in H√§usern oder erschie√üt Hasen/Rebh√ºhner.

Fazit:

Only downside - it's a bit unfair in places and you can get very, very lost - very, very quickly.  No mapping is a massive error in a game which reuses assets/generates worlds (no useful landmarks!)

After a few runs I found myself with getting totally lost or surrounded by enemies with no way of passing them - the randomness of the game is working against the chances of having any fun/making the challenge a bit - well - random.

I have a decent computer and even on low graphics this game runs like a dog with one leg. The highest framerates I was getting was maybe 20, and I spent longer finding solutions to it crashing than playing it.

Nothing I found online helped, so as far as I'm concerned, this is a broken game. Not worth the dollar I paid for it on Humble Bundle.

7/16/2016 Edit: I have a better computer now and I tried running the game again. Still ran awfully, but I managed to get it to work. I thought I would give it another chance and see if the gameplay was actually any good since this time I could actually play it. Err, thought I could actually play it. 

I restarted the game Four. Fucking. Times. Every single time, I got a gamebreaking bug within TEN MINUTES. 

Tried to check inside a door, game froze. Jumped onto a rabbit, couldn't move, had to restart. Tried to climb over a fence, fell through the world. Tried to check inside another door, game crashed. At least it didn't freeze and force me to restart my computer this time!

Pros:
 - interesting concept, sneak through a world of british gentlemen robots that try to kill you
 - neat design, looks funny enough to me
 - everything works smoothely ... kind of an exception nowadays

Cons:
 - so far it turned out to be way too easy

Verdict:

I'm not sure on this one, I give it thumbs up as I haven't found a flaw in the game, but I have yet to hit a point where it got engaging. 
if you have the coin to spare for a little stealth game that is not too serious about anything, Sir, You Are Being Hunted is worth a look.

Here you're a HG Wells type traveller (like The time Traveller but across dimensions not time?), and you really dont want to stay in this place you landed, its not a fun adventure,

I play lots of survival/horror type games and most are easy and a bit formulatic....""you gain experience from killing the enemy allowing to power up, then explore to loot to get weapons that really can wipe out legions of the enemy etc"" But this is hard. Hiding in long grass, afraid to shoot a gun because it will draw in lots more hunters. Getting lost cos theres no map unless your lucky to find one so have to remember landmarks. Theres no crafting, only survival when you have to find matches to eat recently killed rabbits in the rain. And always hungry. Always hunted. Hoping to esape the Islands.

Cooked a pheasant on a fire - happy times, decent food in inventory, but the smoke drew the robot hunters nearer.... not so happy times..... RUN!!!! BANG!!!! Dead... perhaps crawling away would have been the better option in hindsight.

No idea where I am going, stumble from small hamlet to small hamlet that all look alike hoping to find something other than dead rats and bad eggs. I just found a boat.... I'm off this island.... to another just the same no doubt... at least it is a save point apparently.

I always thought stealth games needed to be tightly tuned, with carefully-designed levels and sharp AIs on patrol routes. Sir, You Are Being Hunted proves that isn't the case, but also illustrates the flaws in such an approach. The result is challenging and engaging, though not without periods of tedium and frustration.

Sir drops you into the middle of five randomly-generated islands, each populated by murderous metallic monsieurs out for your human hide. A mysterious device brought you here from your presumably bourgeois lodgings, and is now scattered into 16 or so useless pieces across the archipelago. Each piece must be returned to the standing stones at the center of the center isle if you are to return home in time for roast phesant, but the robots are not about to let you off so easily. To aid in thwarting their deadly directives, you can scavenge items from the ominously ruined structures that dot the landscape. As you find more pieces though, the robots step up their efforts to include robo-dogs, scarecrow sentries, hot air balloons, and more monstrous machines to hunt you down.

The robots are the heart of this game, and they can be terrifying at first. Sure, they make conspicuous beep-boop noises as you draw near, but once they spot you with that heart-stopping bleep, you're in deep trouble. The 'bots are almost as fast as you and have rifles they are not shy about using. They also follow more logical search patterns than most stealth enemies, tracking you all the way to your last known location and then combing the area, making educated guesses about where to search from there. Most robots patrol the islands in groups, paying close attention to structures that can be looted but following and suspicious leads they find. Patrols can be avoided but there are always two or more clankers guarding the artifacts, requiring you to either come prepared with distraction items or a willingness to lead them away with your own sorry hide as bait.

You have two important numbers to keep track of, Health and Vitality. If either one bottoms out, you're not making it to tea time. Health regenerates slowly unless you've been shot, in which case you need to bandage yourself up using rags. Vitality drains over time with activity, and must be restored with food recovered from buildings. More intact buildings are more likely to have unspoiled comestibles, but they're also patrolled more heavily. It's worth mentioning you can't enter any of the buildings in the game, they just serve as giant loot containers. It's a bit of a blow to immersion and options for hiding, but other than that the loot system is solid. You have limited space to store weapons and traps, food and bandages, and any other interesting odds and ends you find. Some items have hidden uses as well, which adds an element of mystery and experimentation to the game.

You can only save at the standing stones or the boats to other islands, so you really have to think twice about risky moves. Stealth in this game is trickier than most, because movement and proximity have a much greater effect on how concealed you are than you might think. You're free to roam most of the islands at a brisk pace, but once robots are near your ass better be down in the grass, creeping along when they're not looking. It'll take time to learn how best to circumvent patrols but it requires a great deal of caution and patience, and slows down the game considerably. It's here that the procedural elements take their toll, sometimes plopping down patrols all around you without consideration for the stone walls or cliffs that funnel you into them. And if that doesn't happen you might be treated to huge tracts of empty land to scamper across in search of those faint wisps of smoke marking an artifact.

Is it a good game? Yes, but one you have to put serious time into. Finding 16 fragments across 5 islands is going to be a tall order, especially as patrols increase and stealth takes more and more time to get right. The randomization keeps the game fresh but can lead to unfair situations between patrols or artifacts in nigh-impossible locations. The sound design is on point with creepy ambiance and amusing voice work, but the graphics don't exactly impress or inspire. The nicest thing I can say about them is that they really capture the post-apocalyptic British countryside. Still, if you can settle into it and dedicate some time, it'll keep you on your toes for a good long while.

I can toggle on/off enemy showing signs or make my game harder by making robots be more common than ever through editing robots. You can also generate your own island by choosing what you want on it.

It feels nice to have limited and rare ammo, since I don't need to go all gun blazing back at them. And of course, there's always ax for anyone of lads who has hard time spending ammunition on pasky robots.
Play it for fun, you don't regret it. If you like resource management games with little bit of shooting and traveling, it's one game that should be tried.

The game is a survival-stealth title that features British Robots and an overall British theme. Your first playthrough will be full of tense moments and take about 7-10 hours, though anyone accustomed to stealth games may have much more favorable results. As with most survival games you need to consume food and avoid skirmishes with your robotic rivals. If you're interest is lessened by screenshots featuring guns have no fear, you will never become an overpowered thriving individual able to engage 10 robots at once. Using guns will send robots in your vacinity charging towards you. Reload times are long and the clips are very small.  Killing robots is a big component of the game, but you have to use hit and hide tactics. Very often you have to investigate a house's defences before you're able to make a move. You'll need to use distractions, traps and a few choice weapons to outwit the robots. Gameplay is very enjoyable, allbeit very short.
There are a few issues that can detract from your experiance however: death, poorly placed device parts and an invincible enemy. The game uses a save point system and there are five spots to save your progress. Upon death you return to your last save with everything you did undone. This causes some serious balance issues: suicide runs to find things can have no risk, and 3 hours of inventory management and storing items in houses become totally irrelivent if you forgot to save. I'd honestly prefer some kind of perma-death system to being flat out ignored by the game. The device parts also tend to get clustered togeth on the coast. You can basically beat the game by walking around each island and you'll find 80-90% of the needed parts in most instances. There are two invincible enemies in the game one is a hot air baloon that shines a light on you and makes a ton of noise, but can be temporarily disarmed by shooting the light or easily avoided. The other can one shot you, track you to the ends of the earth, and is difficult to evade. I don't like that one. Usually if I get caught I just save and quit and then reload.
The game has been finished and the final product is similar to it's beta. I still recommend the game, though I am disappointed in how little content there is. Wait for a sale. Less than $15 is worth a buy.",1440254363,1495640343,True,1,0,0.510273993015289307,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Pros: 

+I really love the concept of hiding from robotic english huntsmen in remote islands in the UK
+Well-executed foliage-based stealth
+4 weapons that are destructive when used correctly (I don't recommend combat that much)
+Lotsa enemies each deadly in their own way [spoiler] (except the Squire, he can be beaten with an axe provided you keep running in circles around him. I dont like the squire) [/spoiler]
+The Landowner's sounds keep me up at night
+Lots of interesting gadgets provide various ways of ridding yourself of pesky robots.
+I really like some of the island types, especially the Mountains.
+I like the way the stealth is also based on how noisy you are.
+Random-generated terrain and the ability to edit the robots that spawn allows for massive replayability.

Cons:
-Multiplayer is VERY VERY VERY BUGGY. I've noclipped through the world so many freakin times and I really hope they fix this soon because I love the multiplayer so far. Wish you could have a Co-op option in the single player ""story"" (there is no real, complex story), like in Borderlands or something similar.
-Please make the landowner less spooky.

What I hope to see in the future:
-Glitches being fixed in the multiplayer/Co-op in singleplayer would be nice.

Ok, so, what to say about this game.

[b]Good[/b]
Robots are extremely Posh. So you won't be dissapointed by a lack of tophats or monocles.
Found letters are so British you will forget you are fleeing from teams of Polite Murder bots who hunt with shotguns to give you a sporting chance (I think).
I got spotted by a baloon and felt like I was fleeing a POW camp.
Tutorial is minimalistic but gets the job done. Don't get killed, use things, eat, find artifacts.
Music is on point and really adds to the atmosphere when you ae being chased.
Drunk effects are decent and can cost you your life if you drink at the wrong moment.

[b]Bad[/b]
Robots often patrol around artifacts in the open, making fighting a requirement (yes even though you can distract them)
Difficulty ramps very quickly. I found 4 artifacts and was suddenly unable to scavenge as each town had a group of Robots in it.
All of the junk. There appears to be [i]alot[/i] of junk stuff everywhere. Why?
Rats, and other dubious items, can they be cooked to remove their dubiousness?
Hunting. I have read that there is hunting and I have seen some rabbits in the game. Do you have to shoot them? Run them down and hit the with an axe? Use a trap on them? The game offers no insight into this and I feel as if it is quite important. There is a finite supply of food that is scavengeable.

[b]Overall[/b]
I do not usually play survival games. I do however, reccomend this game on the basis that it made me actually [i]feel[/i] hunted. I found myself ducking my head (Control Racing style) when I was trying to get asway and hide from a group of hunters. So bravo!

1) immersive envioment
2) simple yet elegant story telling
3) The best stealth system I have ever used.  When you get seen you know why!  
4) Customizable difficulty. (honestly I often turn all enemies off just to explore, and loot the immersive world)
5) excellent modding potential

Cons
1) the story while told well is lacking (honestly this is not that big of a deal given the sandbox nature)
2) lacks replayablity (I play for the enviroment of the game, but other than that there is not much reason to come back)

Summery
This is overall a very good game; however, the normal price tag of $20 is a little too high. This feels more like a game that I would pay $10 for.  That being said it is way better than most games that are asking $30.  I value games by the number of hours of enjoyment they give me.  This game gave me one great play though.  I will, and have come back to it from time to time, but after the first play through you have all the game offers.

The modding potential of this game is enormous.  The sandbox of this game is perfect.  It is simple yet funcitonal.  Every thing feels balanced.  Weapons can be hard to find.  once you do find them Ammo is always an issue, and killing anything without ammo is quite an engaging trick.  Honestly this is the only stealth game I have ever liked. The reason being when I was seen I knew the reason.  Further I got to chose when to engauge, and when to sneak.  Unlike most stealth game that are fairly linear in their levels;  Sir gives you a wide open sandbox with a reason to sneak.

I cannot stess enough for one play through this game is great.  Mind you it will take a few tries to learn the game, and that is fine.  I will be excited to see the mods that come out of this game.",1438216977,1438216977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was making my way through an abandoned town, crouched down, peeking around every corners. A hill, nearby. Suddenly, 12 pairs of glowing red-eyes appear over the knoll. Bearing muskets. I turn around, going in the opposite direction. Then, I realize there's four more enemies on the other side of town, and a hot-air balloon just to top it all off.

Apr√®s un accident lors d'une exp√©rience (en gros), vous voila propuls√© au milieu d'une archipel britannique du 19√®me si√®cle, o√π de petits aristocrates robotique font une partie de chasse. La proie, c'est vous, √©videmment. Comme tout jeu de survie, vous allez devoir chercher des armes et de la nourriture principalement.

N√©anmoins, la difficult√© repose sur des principes assez simple. En effet, l'objectif est de rassembler des objets qui ont √©t√© dispers√©s, des sortes d'artefacts, qui doivent √™tre ramen√© au cercle de pierre du centre de la map, l√† o√π vous d√©marrez.

-Qu'est ce que √ßa donne?

C'est un bon jeu, √† n'en pas douter. M√™me si les graphismes ne sont pas exceptionnels,""Sir, you are being hunted"" promet de bons moments de survie, m√©langeant la discr√©tion, les diversions, et un peu de combat. Le point fort repose notamment sur la g√©n√©ration al√©atoire de la map, qui est ma foi de tr√®s bonne facture, m√™me si certains espace sont parfois un peu vide. Vide? Pas tant que √ßa en y regardant √† deux fois une pr√© avec des hautes herbes ou une for√™t d'arbuste n'est pas un vide, puisque cela vous maintient cach√©. Qui plus est, lors de g√©n√©ration de map, vous aurez aussi la possibilit√© d'avoir diff√©rents ""biomes"" (chateau, industries, campagne... 1 biome par √Æle). Le jeu est plut√¥t bien √©quilibr√©, tant au niveau des loots que de la difficult√©.


- Parlons en, de la difficult√©.

Il est int√©ressant de se pencher sur la difficult√© du jeu, apr√®s tout c'est le fondement d'un jeu de survie. Car celle-ci r√©side dans les objectifs. En devant aller chercher ces artefacts, vous devez pas mal voyager, √† pied. Puisque vous devez les ramener au centre, √ßa vous promet pas mal d'aller-retour, et donc, corse la difficult√©. En effet, la sauvegarde est possible, mais pas souvent, quand vous √™tes au cercle de pierre, ou bien quand vous √™tes au bateau, qui est donc votre point d'arriv√©e sur une carte. Autrement dit, si vous mourrez alors que vous √™tes au beau milieu d'une nouvelle √Æle, vous perdez votre progression et retournez au bateau qui vous a emmen√© l√†. Autre d√©tail concernant la difficult√©, un artefact prends de la place dans votre inventaire, parfois beaucoup, vous obligeant √† le g√©rer en r√©alisant parfois quelques sacrifices.
Sachant qu'il y a une grosse dizaine d'artefacts √† r√©cup√©rer, il ne faut pas se le cacher: certains trouveront donc le principe r√©barbatif, bien que la situation peut √™tre √† chaque fois diff√©rente. C'est le risque lorsque des moyens simples (bien que plut√¥t efficaces), sont employ√©s pour cr√©er la difficult√© du jeu. N√©anmoins la difficult√© est relativement personnalisable lors de la g√©n√©ration du monde et dans les options.

- Et les robots l√† dedans?

H√© bien, les robots ne sont pas si mal. Je trouve l'IA assez √©quilibr√©, facile √† √©viter. Le surnombre vous posera souvent soucis, vous obligeant √† contourner, √©viter, faire des diversions. Si on a la bonne approche, on peut s'en sortir. Ca reste assez ardu, mais je n'ai pas eu le sentiment, personnellement, d'√™tre compl√©tement bloqu√© parce qu'ils √©taient trop forts. Les combats sont n√©anmoins √† √©viter la majeure partie du temps.


- Bref, il y a des d√©fauts quand m√™me, non?

Evidemment. On pourrait appr√©cier davantage de contenu. Des armes suppl√©mentaires, un moyen de locomotion discret et ne donnant pas trop d'avantage comme un bicyclette. Un mode multijoueur serait amusant. On peut aussi songer √† devoir fuir des battues. Bref, ces ""d√©fauts"" n'en sont pas vraiment, puisqu'au fond, on ne critique pas ce qui est pr√©sent, mais on regrette des choses qu'on aimerait √©ventuellement voir apparaitre.



En conclusion, c'est un tr√®s bon jeu de survie, qui p√¢tit d'un graphisme plut√¥t vieillot, mais d'un bon √©quilibre quand √† la difficult√©. Il promet pas mal d'amusement pour un jeu solo. Il m√©rite qu'on s'y attarde, m√™me si on certains tourneront vite en rond. ""Sir, you are being hunted"" sort vraiment du lot dans le monde du jeu de survie solo, c'est une belle r√©alisation sur laquelle on aurait aim√© voir beaucoup plus de moyens.

This game has it all for me, a veteran of stealth since Tenchu and Metal Gear Solid, here was a game that allowed greater flexibility than even they allowed. Sure, it allows you to make more mistakes and it can be very unforgiving when it wants to be, but what we have here is a very solid game. 

You, a gentleman or lady of apparently some standing have been transported to a strange alternate Britain, populated by a variety of robots who seem focussed on making your days end. Gentleman hunters, with synthesized Upper-Class British accents are you initial foils, but soon a whole range of robotic country-pursuits types are also on your trail, from poachers to foxhunters and of course, the robotic force-of-nature which is the Landowner.

To escape, you need to collect several parts of a machine scattered across the five islands, returning them to a set of standing stones at the heart of the map. 

You have weapons and traps available to find, as well as a number of items to help distract your opponents and, of course, food to keep yourself alive.

Vastly outnumbered, stealth is the key to victory here. Sure, you can try to slog your way through the robotic hordes but that is unlikely to end well for anybody. Rather you are encouraged to explore and retrieve what you need by subterfuge, or perhaps through use of a rusty trombone.

So, the gae itself. Lets look at the negatives first. The world is precedurally generated, which is great for variety but it sometimes seems that this makes the landscape you biggest enemy from time to time. I've never had a problem with beyond some locations being fiendishly difficult to get to, but it seems others have been completely stymied by this.

The graphics are great for such a small team and have an excellent visual identity of their own, but especially at night there are a couple of glitches that sometimes give you cause to pause, was that the flash of something significant, or just a glitch in the landscape.

And of course, thr focus, this isn't a big narrative game, this is a game that gives you a world and a mission and lets you get on with it. Don't expect AAA production values here...

...but...

that's a good thing. You see, the designers have come up with a good idea. This is a clever open-world stealth game that rewards ingenuity, careful planning and the occasional bout of gung-ho bravado. This is a game that is not afraid of stacking the odds against you and leaving you to your own devices. If there are insurmountable odds between you and your target do you wait it out, try and sneak through anyway, or just back off and live to fight another day? The game is certainly challenging in this way and with this in mind, the ones who will be most disappointed with it are those who like to be led through a game by their noses, or rely on quick reflexes to blast their way through a horde of opponents.

As a stealth game, its a welcome return to form from a genre that had lost impetus in recent years and as the kind of person who would once upon a time sit patiently watching guards waiting for that perfect moment, this game has rekindled my enthusiasm.

As mentioned, Graphically you are not looking at detailed character models, but beautifully stylised creations that can bring a smile to yoru faces with their occasional nuances and the scenery fantastically evokes the British countryside. Sound is equally well thought out, with a balance of excellent natural cues and some brilliant audio for the hunters themselves (The gentleman hunters somehow manage to come across as upper-class Cylons). The sound design will be as much of an ally in this game as anything else and playing with headphones is warranted.

The Keyboard/Mouse controls are responsive and clean and the HUD and inventory interfaces are straightforward and intuitive.

Frankly, Sir or Madam, this game has brought be a lot more joy than the last few TripleA games I bought and that is an achievement in itself. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to set my hat at a jaunty angle and go and explore the North Island again.

Your helpful butler will explain things more fully, but suffice to say that this game is not your standard survival fare. I'm sure you'll be informed about the striking resemblance of the Archipaelago to some nightmare post-apocalypse Britain, and you'll likewise be educated about the wonderfully dreary atmosphere whihc makes this game stand out from the crowd of survival-horror titles. You'll be instructed how to avoid detection by the cold, calculating automatons that will relentlessly pursue you. You'll endure the elements, and learn to prepare impromptu meals from dubious ingredients. You'll learn to outwit those hunting you, and to fight back against them. You may even discover the hope of a safe trip home.

I'm sure you'll learn of all these things in good time. However, I'd like to draw your attention to another matter. 

You see, you are no longer alone with the robots. Others have made their way to the accursed place, and while that may be an opportunity to band together; it could equally be the sign of a new and far more dangerous threat. Not all your fellow prey are interested in working together, and it seems there may not be a way to bring everyone home...

Ignore the cut-throat ruffians who spread rumours of ""abandonment"", for the hunt is very much on. 

... ok, breaking character now for the sake of a more complete opion. Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a phenomenal game where you must combine stealth, guile and brutal combat tactics in order to escape a relentless horde of very British robots on a group of very British islands, while a very British butler guides you in a quest to recover the fragments of a mysterious machine. The stealth action is extremely tense and clever; and you'll be rewarded for keeping a cool head. The survival aspects are basic, but they get the job done -- and when you're running from crazed robots with shotguns, feeling a little nip of breeze is your last concern. Keep calm and carry on, and all that.

The controls and menus are intuitive and functional, and the world of Sir is far from hideous. If you get a chance to stop and admire the sunset, it's quite nice really. However, most of the game is spent crawling, creeping, sprinting and dodging; so the view doesn't always need to be the most spectacular... soon enough, the sight of hard cover and safe shelter will be more attractive than the most breathtaking vista. As such I'd suggest you ignore anyone complaining about low production values or a supposed lack of polish -- there's a definitive rustic and gritty tone, but that's kind of the whole point.

The real sense of excitement and enjoyment comes from that moment you turn the tables and begin laying your own traps, making your own plans, and visibly progressing towards your escape. Everything in the game points towards that end -- from the not-so-subtle reminders that most of the ""loot"" you find will be utterly irrellevant to your quest, to the way that the robots force you to keep moving, and even the barren-ness of the landscape.

That said, there are plenty of moments of levity mixed in; and the addition of multiplayer adds a whole new dimension to that. Items which were previously useless (or as good as useless) can now be used inventively; both for pure shenanigans or for a tactical purpose. 

Furthermore, multiplayer adds a new element of competition -- the robots can be outsmarted and outmanouvred, but fellow players are a whole different matter.

Sir, You Are Being Hunted combines the best elements of horror, stealth and survival; and wraps them all up in a quirky British package. It's not everybody's cup of tea, but if you're into that kind of thing then it will do very well indeed.",1437391793,1437391793,True,5,1,0.557581901550292969,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game meets its concept well and even /plays/ well, but the only people I can recommend this to are serious fans of the stealth genre. Inventory is limited, as are your opportunities to save the game - a simple misstep in a crowded area can bring half a dozen hunters to your location and may cost you 20 minutes progress in the blink of an eye. Think NES levels of frustration at times.

The procedural generation sometimes leaves a bit to be desired; I attempted to visit the northern island only to find the island had generated with sheer cliff walls. A piece of the machine is in there for me to find. Can't wade in the water, because water robots will get me. Can't climb a sheer wall because the game isn't set up that way. Hard to progress, under such circumstances. 

Controller support felt loose and lackluster. Keyboard WASD was fine, and felt more natural. Remember, inventory doesn't pause the world, so good luck using those rags while you're bleeding out!

In all, things I'd have liked to have seen:
* A few more save opportunities for those of us who aren't particularly great at Stealth
* tighter controls on a gamepad 
* some basic fairness would be pleasant, though certainly not required

You have to find mysterious parts that are strewn about the landscape while avoiding different types of robots that will try to kill you on sight.

The islands are procedurally generated, and the parts you have to find are dropped in random locations on the map. They are made easier to find by emitting a pillar of smoke, and are usually guarded by a couple of robot huntsmen. You can either rush in and try to demolish them or you can sneak in and steal it from under their nose. Or maybe it's safer to create a distraction, in the form of an alarm clock going off that you previously dropped some place else, or maybe a little choo choo train that you let go somewhere in the hope that the robots will go and investigate the disturbance.

The game has a day and night cycle, so it's obviously better to wait until it's dark for your pick up attempts. The problem is, you will get hungry while waiting. So you have to find food, maybe in the form of a glass of pickled eggs that you found in an abandoned house, or you might stumble over a pheasant in the fields, which just tastes splendid when cooked over a campfire. Too bad you haven't found any matches yet to get the fire going.

The default settings generate 5 islands that are connected by boat (which serve as the loading transition), and measure about a square kilometer in size. The British landscape is well represented, with rocky coasts and small, but thick forests, rolling countryside with some agriculture, some castle ruins, and so on. The weather is also well represented, rainy, with a chance of clouds. There are small abandoned hamlets, hunting cottages and other buildings strewn about the maps, which can unfortunately not be entered, but if you activate the doors, you can find useful items within. They range from junk like bones or souvenirs over dubious food items like dead rats or strange mushrooms to useful stuff like guns, ammunition, bandages or cans of tea.

The robots are pretty deadly, they only take a short moment for aiming, then you are blasted with shotguns, blunderbusses or other weapons, which leads to a quick demise. If you start bleeding, you better have some bandages on you, or your health slowly runs out until it's game over. The AI is pretty good, the robots investigate all kinds of noise and movement; for instance if you startle a rabbit while your sneaking towards a guarded piece, a robot might see it run away and start looking for trespassers in the area. Sometimes a robot can get stuck in an obstacle, but I only saw it one or two times. The different robot types require different approaches to deal with them or to avoid them, which creates a bit of variety in an otherwise pretty repetitive game (you walk around looking for the smoke pillar of a piece in the distance, sneak there, deal with the robots who might guard it, get the piece, rinse and repeat 15 times).

Technically, the game is solid, the controls work well, the AI behaves like it should, and video and audio is well implemented. It obviously doesn't have triple A graphics, but it gets the job done, and art assets are stylish and support the British setting beautifully. The soundscape supports the feeling of being alone and hunted by a superior foe and sometimes even creates a mildly creepy feeling, when you are sitting in the high grass and listening to the distorted electronic voices of your hunters all around you.

There is no free save system. You can only save at the place where you have to return the pieces to (a spot in the middle of the central island), or at the boats. This obviously creates some tension, because if you get detected while going for a piece and die in the aftermath, you will start again at the boat and have to travel the whole way to the piece again (which doesn't take very long, fortunately).

I finished the default 5 islands scenario in about 7 hours, but it's probably doable in less time.",1437004571,1437004571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is a 100%  stealth and strategy game.  I have played using all the different character types  available which does not change the gameplay just the items in your inventory at the start of the game.   You can change the landscape and the buildings and throw in the amount of robots that you want.   I really like the ability to be able to modify and change landscapes and structures because you have a different game each time.  I will strongly advise not to start the game with the max amount of robots  if you are a beginner as it will be almost impossible to play.  Between the dogs and the horsemen you will  running  for your life and may not enjoy the game.  Horsemen  sometimes  do not appear if the fields (hayable, stonewall,  hedge, woodfence) are not checked or turned on.  They will appear outside of fields obviuosly but many times I have constructed landscapes with no fields with horsemen added in  the mix of robots and none were ever seen during the game.   If  you  really want a challange give it a go because almost every single field will have a horseman.    Horsemen are not limited to the fields and they will roam the woods and villages as well but prefer the fields it seems.   It does not matter where you are  if the horsemen see you run.  In the landscape menu you have a variety of landscape types to pick from and to modify.  Only one landscape pattern per island.    Be careful when choosing dramitic with mountains and valleys as it can make extreme pits and  canyons to fall into and mountains that are very tall and hard to climb.     Also, if you choose large islands for all your islands sometimes the game will have trouble loading and then other times there may be  one of the docks that is off in the corner of the screen (map) or way out in the water where you will always be killed by the mechanical arms (bog monster) before you can reach the dock.     However, not all of the arms will bite you causing damage.    I have found that they tend to rotate damage vs non-damage.   The first one you encounter will make noise and that is all but when it goes away the very next one will bite and cause severe damage and death if  you do not run away.   Sometimes you will have a piece of the artifact (teleporter) on an island that is only a few yards away from your main island and you will have to walk through the water.   There are no boats to use for these situations you must wade through chest high water and sometimes go underwater.  You do not swim or drown just walk or run through the water.   I have spent alot of time in and under water and never drowned in this game but anything is possible I suppose .   Jump in the water and wait for one of the bog monsters to  pop up.  If it does not bite then keep going but if it does, retreat back to shore and wait for it to go away.  Do not stand at the waters edge cause they can hit you on land.   Once it goes away try again and the next one should be harmless.   There is so much to this game that I love and appreciate.   My hats off to the makers of this game at Big Robot.  Great job and well done.   I  know some people do not like this game because they cannot save game progress anywhere anytime in the game or they say there are not enough weapons or they want massive damage weapons.   This IS NOT a ""shoot'em up"" type of game.   It is a stealth and strategy game.   I love the fact that you can only save at the standing stone or at one of the boat docks.    Also,  if you are bleeding or starving you cannot save either so make sure you have rags and food.    I like the challenge this puts on the player.   Its 100% all about STEALTH and strategy.   If you use your noise makers wisely ( clocks, trains, bottles, rocks and trombone)  you can distract the hunter bots to accomplish your goals.  I  know its just a game and that the robots can be predictable sometimes, but you still have to plan  and think ahead about how you manuver.

There's a nice attempt at world building with little tidbits of information to be discovered, which are fairly well written.

AI is quite predictable (isn't it always the way in stealth games, though?) but the scarcity of defense measures and variety of enemy behaviours allow the game to remain challenging (run on default bot population:  I have no intention of playing on the hardest settings, thank you very much)

Picked it up during a monster Steam sale -- I think for like 90% off or something -- and it was definitely worth the ~$3CAD but probably not the full price of >$20. 

Sir (or Madam), You Are Being Hunted is a sandbox first-person stealth game set in a vaguely Edwardian time period where you, the protagonist, get stranded on a series of islands and are hunted by murderous robots. Your goal -- to travel to each island (five in all) and acquire pieces of a machine to transport you to safety. All the while, you have to mind your hunger and scavenge for items like food, bullets, weapons, and alarm clocks. The islands are procedurally generated with each game with a choice of one of five biome types. I really like the procedural islands; each biome is different and they feel natural and well thought out. On the default setting, the game starts with a few robot  hunters and, as you collect more pieces, ramps up the difficulty until finding those last pieces becomes seriously difficult.

The good and the bad (caveat: I haven't finished the game yet because of the serious difficulty mentioned above):

Good:
Procedural generation: I'm a sucker for it, my favourite game genre of all time is roguelikes, and this is roguelike-y in random generation of the islands, the buildings and the enemies.

Stealth: this game is at heart very stealth oriented, inasmuch as even if you do find weapons going in with guns blazing, even on the lower levels, is not a winning strategy. Bullets are scarce, weapons are scarce, and there are way more of the enemy than there is of you. It's entirely possible to play the game without shooting any weapon at all, which I find refreshing.

Graphics: I game on Linux, which okay, I'm already at a disadvantage, and I game with a low-endish business model Thinkpad, which again, problematic, but the game is smooth as anything on my machine and still is graphically nice to look at. Well, ""nice"" in that the game is simulating a depressing English countryside, so colours are muted and browns, grays, dull greens abound, but that's ok. 

Sound: Surprisingly this game is *very* sound oriented. Don't try to play without having your sound on; you'll get clobbered. You'll need to hear the robots approaching -- each type has a distinctive sound -- in order to avoid them. There's an option in the game to turn on an indicator, which puts a little Metal Gear Solid-ish ""!"", ""?"" above the robots' heads to gauge how aware they are of you, and this is *invaluable* - at least if you're playing the game without headphones -- but even so you'll have to listen hard to survive.

Repeatability: There are *lots* of options to tune the robots appearances and numbers. I haven't messed with this yet as I want to finish the game on the default, but it's great to have something beyond ""Easy, Medium, Hard"" for difficulty.

Gender: It's a small thing, but the fact that you can pick your gender is a good one. More games should do this.

Bad:
Stealth: hey wait, didn't I just put stealth in the ""good""? Yeah. But in this game you spend a *lot* of time crouched in reeds or ducking behind buildings while all the while your vitality trickles to zero. This does present a nice amount of tension to the game, but the islands are *big* muthas and finding the pieces without the piece detector is hard enough; trying to find them blind is *really* hard. And when you've spent hours combing an island to find that last piece, while all the while the *hordes* of robots that populate the endgame are shooting you, trapping you in bear traps, running you over with rocket horses, and biting your foot it gets real frustrating real fast.

Sound: I have a mild hearing disability and I don't particularly like games that are super dependent on sound, so I sort of resent the fact that I *have* to have sound turned on in this one. Not sure how it would work without it though.

Items: The primary way one gets ahold of things is by searching buildings for them, and there are a *lot* of junk items you can't actually do anything with. I would love an option to turn off junk items because it's annoying to go to a door and just find bones. You can't do anything with junk -- not even throw it as a distraction -- so I'm not sure why the designers included the junk items in the game at all. As far as I can see, they serve no purpose beyond annoying window dressing.

Buildings: The buildings look great, but you can't go inside them. They exist solely as a cache for (mostly) junk items. The game would be improved greatly if you could enter a building and peek out a window, or have, say, fixed items to heal damage, like beds or something. Instead they're basically giant crates.

I'd say, eh, three and half stars out of five to four stars out of five depending on your tolerance for frustration in the difficult endgame.",1435768323,1435771504,True,127,2,0.856143951416015625,3,True,False,False,False,,,

You step into the role of a high-classed gentleman/ lady scientist/ inventor of some sort who's latest experiment has gone horribly wrong, and has this Sir or Madam stranded on a group of islands in an alternate reality. If things didn't look bleak enough, your butler informs you that you are being hunted by denizens of this strange new land; they are Victorian England robot hunters looking to fill in a space on their den wall. Keep a pistol in your hand and an ear to the ground as you venture forth in this funny yet freaky adventure.

The goal of the game is to repair the Standing Stones, the relic that went haywire during your tests, in order to use them to warp you back home. To repair the Stones, you need to locate the missing pieces which where dislodged during your failed experiment, and gather them back to the Standing Stones. The catch, however, is the presence of the manhunting automatons that are more than happy to riddle you with buckshot, catch your ass up in a bear trap, and otherwise just ruin your unexpected journey. Their forces grow larger and more dangerous with the more progress you make.

As a survival game implies, you have to manage needs like hunger. It is called Vitality in [i]Sir[/i] and it is basically a calorie meter combined with your potency to regain lost health over time. You use various food and drink items you gather from looting and hunting wild game to restore Vitality.

Even though the game supports a decent variety of weaponry, from a simple axe to a high-powered rifle, the best weapon is stealth. Ammo can be difficult to find as the game goes on and can be very cumbersome on your inventory, so sticking to the shadows pay be the most safe and economic way to play. If you're one who isn't worried about saving every bullet and shell, then you can employ guerilla tactics and Rambo your way to victory. There are also other means to gain advantages against your predators, such as bear traps and noise makers.

This game stands out fairly in the survival game scene nowadays, with its somewhat simple yet surreal/steampunk art direction, witty humor and Easter eggs, the haunting feeling of being watched and hounded down, moments of ""what the hell..."" and robotic gentlemen with shotguns instead of zombies. I give this lovely game a 9/10.",1435117132,1435562376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When I first saw the title, I liked the concept although I forgot to follow it.
I'm through now a couple playthrough and I have to say it is quite a great, violent hide-and-seek game.
I like the idea of randomly generated worlds which we see quite rarely in games although with todays tech it is more than convenient to build certain games to have this feature.
I liked the AI - it payed attention to check out places where they saw some distraction multiple times.
And I liked the touch of horror in some robots - personal favorites are the Landowner and the Scarecrow. It's great when you don't notice it, you hear something from behind and when you turn around suddenly a glowing pumkinhead smiles back at you, you unload your rounds (it would be fun if you could shoot yourself in the leg in such frightening moments if you don't aim right), then it minces you in a couple of blows... Or when you sneak through the forest and then for the first time you hear the landkeeper's scream and you open up your inventory and rather drink up all the brew pretending it will make it go away...
Another funny factor was when robots started to fight each other. In some playthroughs I've got my first weapon+ammo this way.

You have to weigh up risk and reward, since you can only save at key locations. It's nailbiting when you're driven to sneak through an occupied village because you're desparate for something to eat, hoping you don't get caught. Although, when you do get caught, it's a rush. You're faster than the standard, common hunters, so you'll be able to shake them if you put enough forest between the two of you.

If you loved that feeling of tension and vulnerability, this is the game for you. 

In Sir, You Are Being Hunted, well, you get what it says on the tin. You are being hunted. Constantly. At first, if you're cautious, avoiding the patrols of dapper british robots trundling around looking for you in the wake of some robo-pocalypse feels pretty easy. 

But the more of the key pieces you gather to get to safety, and the longer you survive, the more dogged and determined the robots get.

Weapons are few in this game. Ammunition scarce. Weapons (on both sides!) are devastatingly powerful. Nothing feels like a peashooter in this game, especially on your meatbag fleshy body. Running and hiding is ALWAYS preferable to combat, not least of all because the sound of gunfire and violence will bring in robots from the surrounding countryside.

This game isn't very fast-paced, but it is tense, and great at punishing you for being too careless. (It will also punish you for being too cowardly, as you've got to keep scrounging and wandering to find/hunt food.)

This isn't a game you'd call a power-fantasy. It's more like a vulnerability-fantasy.

If creeping across English moors with little but your wits, evading an entertaining array of robots, who are naturally, hunting you, sounds like your cup of tea, nick some biscuits from an abandoned house and dunk away.

It is immersive and spooky, the lighting in particular adds to the tension as the tell tale sound of one of the excellently animated robots tests your stealth and nouse.

A flaw perhaps is that it is repetetive to a degree (few games aren't) - find the 15 scattered items to get off the island, but the random generation of the map and item placement adds enough replayability for me. For now.

The limitation of only being able to save progress at various points, for me, adds to the game. A few well set traps and a loot filled rucksack can all be undone by not taking the safe option occassionally. It's your decision if you want to risk past progress. 

Multi-player is being added soon - will be interesting to see how that develops.

Highly recommended.

For a start, it's incredibly difficult - and I mean difficult. Finding out how to get past that robot patrol guarding that telebit piece is a challenge in and of itself, and whilst I've never been caught by the Landowner I have indeed seen his creepy-as-bollocks appearance. 

Scarecrows are another matter. Let's not talk about them.

The aim of the game is to fix your teleporter whilst also not dying. That is literally it. This sounds fairly simple - but then you discover that your butler is ethereal, seems to refer to you as a madam (disclaimer: this is indeed an option), and there are robots with guns trying desperately to find you and the telebits whilst also generally being a nuisance. Couple this with the fact that not only is your Vitality is constantly draining, but food is basically non-existant, there's a giant Bog Monster in the sea, and an invincible hot air balloon can see you from miles off, and it makes for an atmosphere to kill for.

Oh, and also everyone in the game (bar yourself, the silent protagonist of old) is English.

Second, I'd like to also say that this game is horribly optimized. I have an i5 4690k, and a GTX 970, and I'm only getting roughly 50fps on medium.

PROS:
This game has a great atmosphere, and pretty satisfying combat. 
Inventory is quick and easy to organize.
Enemy AI is surprisingly good.
Gun play is well balanced, and ammo is relatively hard to come by
This game also offers quite a decent challenge. 
CONS:
Bad graphics (doesn‚Äôt really matter)
Poor optimization, even on high-end pcs
The save mechanic is rather annoying (you always have to run back to spawn to save)
You can‚Äôt explore any of the interiors of the buildings.

With 75% of my inventory occupied by bottles and empty guns, but no food or rags, I need to find a source of food. a house to loot, perhaps. I scurry into a forest after the sound of a squadron falls upon my ears; I was in no condition to fight. I wander the forest for a little bit, helplessly watching my vitality droop into the low thirties. I need food, drink, anything. 

And fast.

After crawling through the forest for a few minutes, I hear humming. There is a lone robot here. I scope out the immediate area, hoping to set course away from certain doom. Upon laying eyes on the beast, however, I sit in place, carefully calculating where it is traveling.

Because of the shack it was patrolling.

I watch the shack and robot from above, as I am stationed on a hill just out of sight. My vitality is hitting the low teens. This shack is my last shot at life; any village would be too far to not starve. This is my last chance, and I need to spend it wisely. I note the robot's steady patrol around the shack, and sprint when he rounds the corner. I do not care if I am seen; I could run after I retrieved any food in the shack, and any other course of action would leave me dead.

A meter or so away, I note that I can no longer hear the robot humming. This is either my lucky day, or my last. I got within a few decimeters of the door, so close to life once more.

[i]Snap[/i]

That is all I hear, and all I need to hear. I am dead. The abrupt and loud snap and accompanying crunch can only mean one thing.

I quickly look down to inspect my injured shin, shattered by a perfectly placed bear trap. I quickly try to undo the traps mechanisms, to free myself and run. I am interrupted by a loud click above my head. I look up. I am greeted by the barrel of a large gun, then by a bright light, and darkness. I can feel the ground as I land, I feel it welcome me to a long, peaceful slumber. As I fall into eternal sleep, I am greeted with a lullaby, a familiar song that I am unable to name. It is unsettling, however in the way it is sung, or rather, hummed.

And it sounded oddly robotic.

Players can choose what environment to make the four outlying islands, from dystopian industrial, to crumbling fens. In each, small rows of buildings remain behind, with different types of rural English tropes of robots awaiting. These robots are programmed to hunt down the player, if the player is seen or heard in the vicinity of their paths.

The player, however, begins the game either with a minimal amount of items, or on easier settings, weapons and distractions for the robots. The player can also find more weapons, ammunition, food, bandages, accessories, and plenty of unusable items, in buildings and bins throughout the islands. Since this is a survival horror game, all items are scarce, and the player may only take what can fit in his or her backpack. However, the player can store items in buildings or bins along the way.

The object for the player is to find mysterious rocks that have struck the islands. Taking these to a monolith at the center of the middle island will teleport the player off the island and to safety. Guarding these rocks, however, are very alert robots, knowing the player must try to retrieve these pieces to get off the islands.

To assist the player, wisps spawn and fly toward one of these fallen rocks. A player can always track down pieces by following a wisp, but this also makes the player a bit more visible to robots.

On harder settings, robots also have canines that can run faster than the player and can hear the player farther away than the normal robots. There is also a hot air balloon robot which will sound an alarm and shine a spotlight on the player when he or she is discovered.

The game feels like the player is a game animal, being released for hunters to find and kill. It is a different, but well executed, idea for a survival horror game.

The graphics are mediocre, and the sounds need plenty of work. But the game is still being updated infrequently, so eventually these shortcomings will be resolved.

I'm not a huge FPS player, I have finished Portal, finished Fallout 3, left HL2 at that boring car level after Ravensholme and that's about it.  I need a good narrative to get me playing.  I found it here.

This game is fantastic, the level of tension is unparralelled, in Dishonored, I know if I get seen I can probably fight my way out, in this, I'm fucked if I'm found.  This sort of urgency/agency is rare.

Varied and interesting enemies, great terrain, excellent narration.  Five out of fucking four!

the style of the gameplay change, sometimes  its a stealth game sometimes more like a shoot them up.
The loot and inventory system is pretty nice. The only thing it needs is coop.

sir you are being hunted est magnifique, les graphiques sont beaux, comme le gameplay.
le style de jeux peut changer de temps en temps. des fois le stylent de jeux peut-√™tre stealth pis 2 minutes plus tard √ßa peut devenir un shoot them up.
l'inventaire et le syst√®me de loot sont vraiment bien faites, la seule chose dont ce jeu a besoin c'est de la coop.

People looking for some deep backstory need to look elsewhere, it's not really necessary in this game.  You know what you need to know from the beginning:  You are dropped in a procedurally generated world, a group of 5 islands, each with their own ""theme"" (industrial, feudal, countryside, etc.).  You need to find a bunch of scattered parts for some sort of teleportation machine that will get you home (back to your home dimension, according to the ""victory song"" at the end).  All the while you must concern yourself with survival, looking for food, weapons, ammunition, and useful items in houses, sheds, and towns.  
However, you are being constantly hunted by robots, armed with guns, dogs, and lots of fun British lingo.  They tend to hang around areas that contain items that you need, so you are always looking for ways to sneak past them, distract them, or if you have enough ammo and the numbers aren't too great, taking them out.
The game is a lot of fun.  Lots of things to chuckle at, but also some great gameplay.  It's Day-Z without the assholes, and with a dark sense of humor.  The environments are varied and look nice, each area having it's own feel.  The robot AI is very good, and strikes a good balance between being not so good that they are impossible to beat, but not so stupid that they are always easy either.  The robot variety is also well done, with various types each posing their own challenge.  Right when you think you've seen every kind, the game surprises you with a new one.

Even at full price, I have already gotten my moneys worth out of it. 

I would suggest to anyone that they play it on aristocrat, the initial part of the game trying to find tools and food is far more tense than starting as another class with stuff. The very first play I used the officer (I think, the one with a pistol and rifle) and it was good just to get the hang of it but I would recommend restarting ASAP as aristocrat for a full experience. 

I honestly don't understand the (overly verbose) negative reviews, granted that they were done well before me playing it now, but the game plays perfectly well and honestly what more can you ask for? You can't expect AAA title polish and such an interesting concept, its $20 and more than worth it, anyone coming up with a laundry list of minor complaints at this point is either not in the target audience at all (which is fair, its not necessarily for everyone) or just can't be pleased.

The game is also quite ugly, theres a distinct different in aesthetic between the enemies and the levels, if they used a more uniform aesthetic across the whole game it would look better. Despite looking pretty ugly it still ran pretty awful on my computer, my computer is no pushover either. The game has a randomly generated world but no replay value whatsoever. I think if there was a mode where you hunted robots and mounted thier heads in a trophy room it might be cool because the robots AI is very cool and different depending on the robot so it would make hunting them entertaining.

There ain't much to it really. Not even humour, which is what I was really looking forward to find. Quite bland references to what the devs believed to be ""English culture"", that's all this game has. Crikey!

As for gameplay, you'll find mostly anything you'd find in any other so called ""survival"" title.

There is food and drinks, but the need for them is only noticed via the ever decreasing vitality meter, which upon reaching zero, also decreases your health.

There are bandages you have to use when shot by robots or hurt somehow, otherwise you'll bleed to death.

There is stealth, which consists in hiding and/or moving silently. That includes not upsetting the wildlife, which will scramble all nearby robots in search for whatever caused the stir.

There are 5 different weapons (at least that I could find): a hatchet (melee), a pistol, a double-barrel shotgun, a bayonet and a rifle, this one very difficult to acquire. There is also a bear trap you can set to catch that distracted robot, or your dinner. 

There are also a few items you can use to create a distraction so you can run away, or get the robots over so you can ambush them: a rock, empty bottles, a alarm clock (this one gives you time to hide and prepare before it goes off) and a toy train.

The only good thing it has going for it are the huge open world maps, but frankly, there ain't much exploration to be done. For example, you don't get enter buildings, you just access its inventory screen by interacting with the door.

It get's boring very quickly.... you almost forget that your main mission is to find some shiny stones you can stuff into what resembles the Stonehenge, in order to open an escape portal of some sort...

I say, old chap! Game's a load of old cobblers, and you'd be mad to pay more than a fiver for it!

Tambi√©n puedes editar los robots que quieres, la cantidad etc.
El juego es tambi√©n un poco survival, tienes que buscar cosas en casas, como munici√≥, comida y herramientas, adem√°s de poder cazar y cocinar.
Aunque lo principal de este juego es el sigilo y la estrategia, tienes 2 opciones al coger un fragmento 1: a saco eliminando a todos los robots, o m√°s tranquilamente sin morir distray√©ndolos con los diferentes objetos para hacerlo.

It all starts swimmingly well with the first piece right next to you but the closer you get to victory, the more persistent and diabolical the automate that besets you becomes. For you are not just being hunted, it seems like the whole of the species is in season and you're the only one left in the vicinity so other than the supplies you can scavenge, you are very much alone against what at first seem insurmountable odds.

It's not so bad after some practice but it takes the patient and persistent sort. If that's you then you are in for a treat. Enjoy.

A rather dificult survival game that has you running for your life from dastardly but good fashioned Robotic British noblemen.
Yeah, that rather sums it up.

Catapult√© par accident lors d'une exp√©rience, sur une √Æle d'une myst√©rieuse archipel. Vous devrez retrouver tous les fragments de m√©t√©ore, afin de vous t√©l√©porter hors de l'archipel. Cependant des robots tenteront de vous abattre comme du gibier.
Ceci est l'intrigue de base de ""Sir you're being hunted"", et c'est malheureusement le seul contenu r√©ellement innovant de ce jeu, et malheureusement un bon concept ne fait pas forc√©ment un bon jeu.
Parmi les d√©faut, ou, si vous pr√©f√©rez, les manques d'originalit√© du jeu, on retiendra un gameplay particuli√®rement pauvres, les m√©caniques de FPS sont moles, tout comme les combats, et que dire de ses m√©caniques de gameplay en tant que jeu de survie? Seule la faim y est simul√©e, les crafts sont inexistants on sent que cet aspect du jeu n'a pas √©t√© assez approfondi, ce qui aurait √©t√© excusable si √ßa avait √©t√© pour compenser un cot√© action plus nerveux, plus travailler, mais non, ou alors, qui sait? Pour compenser un travail trop pousser sur les graphismes, comment? Ah beh l√† aussi ce n'est pas le cas, le moteur graphique est r√©ellement sous exploit√©, et surtout, SURTOUT le personnage contr√¥l√©, n'est pas encod√©, en r√©alit√© nous contr√¥lons un cube symbolisant la cam√©ra, mais c'est tout, ce qui veut dire que les armes en ""main"" flottent en r√©alit√© dans le vide, ce qui est visuellement assez d√©rangeant.
Au final, ""Sir you're being hunted"" est un de ces jeu qui suscitent l'attention, il nous intriguent, √† la simple √©nonc√©e du concept on souhaite de suite s'y plonger, mais tr√®s vite la pauvret√© tant de son contenu que de son gameplay nous rattrape et √† ce moment l√† notre int√©r√™t pour son univers attrayant s'estompe et on s'ennuie.
R√©sum√©
Verdict: 9/20
- Gameplay: 2/5 m√©caniques de survie pauvre, combats trop mous.
- Graphisme: 3/5 l√©g√®rement faible par rapport √† ce qui est sorti parall√®lement, manque √©vident de travail sur certaines mod√©lisations. 
- Sc√©nario: 1/5 Tiens en une phrase: on se retrouve t√©l√©porter sur des √Æles habit√© par des robots chasseurs.
- Direction artistique: 4/5 les robots sont marrants avec leurs costumes de chasseurs de l'√©poque victorienne, et ces √Æles aux allures de campagne britannique poussent √† l'exploration.",1424288815,1424288815,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While the gameplay is somewhat limited, with only a handful of different enemies, each of them has a lot of personality, and strenghts and weaknesses that make them very distinct from one another, same goes for the limited number of weapons.  The usable items could be more unique... I never found myself using the toy train, or the alarm clock, or the traps at all, as throwing bottles and rocks to draw enemies away from you seemed superior, although you may find better uses for those items than I did.

The game is pretty simple; you start off on the center island, and there are 4 more to explore (N, S, E, W) as you gather all the shards of whatever it is you're collecting that will teleport you off the island to safety.  Sneaking around is FAR superior to engaging in combat, which I really found enjoyable,  because in real life, you can't stand and have a gunfight with 1 or more other people and not expect to die.  The use of the red light emanating from the enemies eyes, as well as their characteristic sounds was perfectly used to help you identify them in the bleak British countryside, as well as build suspense... It's a little difficult keeping your cool and crouching in the weeds while a towering Landowner strolls by, screaming, with hunting dogs swarming around him, waiting to attack and pin you to the ground so others can finish you off with their guns!

I liked that they made building unable to be entered; they would too easily become safe havens against the robots hunting you, and checking them in broad view of passersby while your screen is obscured by the doorways made for some very tense moments... especially knowing that if the big, normally passive robot that patrols them sees you, he'll make very quick work of you with his pistol!

The health and vitality meters worked out perfectly... there are no health restoring items, just food, which you eat to keep your vitality up.  This not only prevents you from starving to death (which never happened to me), but the higher your vitality, the more quickly your health regenerates while you hide in the shadows licking your wounds.  If you take enough damage, you start to bleed health fairly quickly, and MUST take cover to apply a bandage, even while being fired upon, otherwise you will surely die!

The learning curve of the game is fairly difficult, as you'd expect from a procedurally generated game, but there are infrequent save points that make dying more pallatable; I think the difficulty along with infrequent saving perfectly balanced each other out so that you couldn't be very reckless, as you'd lose a significant amount of progress, while not forcing you to play so conservatively as to completely avoid risks (Nethack, I'm looking at you!).  Currently, there's not a huge amount of replay value; the different classes are nearly identical, and all their starting equipment is easily found.  I think if they added more classes/items/monsters/weapons/biomes, and made them unlockable by reaching objectives, it would greatly add to the replay value... currently, I can see playing through this game 1-2 times before being completely satisfied with it.  Being able to craft some items from the myriads of junk, as well as adding helpful NPCs would also go a long ways.

All in all, I definitely got my $20 worth of fun out of this game; don't hesitate to buy it if it goes on sale!  I'm excited for expanded content to come out; more enemies, weapons, unique items, biomes, and player mods could easily take this game from a B/B+ to an A-, maybe even an A!",1424195248,1424195248,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First things first, you need to actively scavenge, and begin with a mostly empty inventory (emptiness dependent on your job prior to the incident, IMO the jobs are well balanced, and the ""easy"" one has serious disadvantages).
There is next to no story here, but what little there is can make you think (and let's face it, plots in a game are like plots in explicit material, no-one cares about it). Call me a nut, but I think what happened was the dev got fed up of russian stereotypes and went for something with brittish stereotypes. For his next game, he should make ""Comrade, you are being hunted"".
Great game, but needs more filler.
The horror comes in that, at some points, you realize that the robots are making the sounds of women screaming (or maybe it's a fox's cal, IDK), and you what is going on, and you need to fight your curiosity to not peek behind your cover.

It's a cute game with quite the amount of action, stealth and survival. There's tons of loot to be acquired from doors in randomly generated villages which can help you on your journey and whatnot. 
Despite all that, the game doesn't feel complete. Everything feels so overly repetitive after a while (but so does every game, really). The developers should possibly give it another look and see what they could add onto it.",1422970726,1422970726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You are stuck on an island where several groups of hunting robots trying to kill you. Your job is to recover bits of an experimental device and return home. 

Initially it looks like this will be a walkover, the hunting robots are easy to evade or out run and food and materials are abundant in abandoned homes all over the island. However, as time passes the pursuit heats up. Swift hunting dogs join the patrols, sheriffs start to guard the towns and strange ambushers set leg traps in the best hiding spots. The early strategy of out running the patrols works at first, but very soon you will need to think carefully to avoid running being hemed in. The environment is the real star of this game, flocks of birds will break cover and reveal your location to your pursuers; Robot patrols will sometimes start shooting at each other when the meet and lighting a fire to cook food will attract every robot for miles to your location, useful as a tactic when you need to lure them away from a bit of the device. 

The game is not perfect, it is simple to a fault and while the stealth parts are very good they are pretty much all there is. Combat is not the focus of the game and is not rewarding either in terms of loot or risk. Often you need to kill a robot to proceed, but if you can avoid this you should. The houses have mostly junk and there is no crafting or real story to this game. To me this is an advantage as it allows the player to focus on the job at hand without distraction. To some other people this game may appear shallow, watch some videos to get the feel of it if you are not sure.",1422852565,1422852565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Multiplayer update:[/b] I do still recommend this game for the single player experience, I do feel like the multiplayer was just shoehorned in.  If you are getting this game exclusivly for the multiplayer you may want to stay away.  Also it seems really dead, I was on last night and 11 people were playing across servers.

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

You will only need like 5 minutes to realize that this game is really boring and not very rewarding. You will walk for ages to house to house, finding for supplies.. Well just clicking on the door to scavenge for loot and move on to the next house or walking around in a massive empty landscape with no purposes. There will be robots walking around and scanning the area. Looking for you and kill you so you will have to hide, distract and eventually even kill them. There is a vitality bar and you will have to eat often to keep this up before you will die out of starvation.

Game feels really boring.
Game feels like a demo or unfinished.
There is a hunger bar.
Gameplay is bad.
Health regeneration.
Really repetitive.
TOO overpriced. This game is only worth like 5 bucks.

Coming from a Linux background I try to purchase Linux-friendly games as much as possible. And I think this may be the best first-person stealth game currently available. 

The menus, using items, and gun-play is all straight-forward and intuitive. You could easily sit down and play this game even if it was your first fps and/or stealth game youve ever played. 

I like the fact that searching for items isnt a tortured experience. Many devs think that searching a building (or any type of container) requires the character walking into a house or barn. This system of being able to access the items from the door of a building help keep the player focused on the main objectives in the game. Its brilliantly simple and I let out a sigh of relief when I first ""explored"" a house.

Even playing on the ""easy"" level (selecting a well-equipped character) is challenging al while being a good starting point. Its one of those games that you look forward to mastering.

Price: I had this on my wishlist for a while and never pulled the trigger. Not sure why not. But I saw it on sale at Humble Bundle for $4! So that was a no brainer (especially since I had about $20 in BTC laying around). But $19.99 is spot on for full retail price. I wouldnt have been pissed if I had paid full price.

You Sir (Or Madam), begin your adventure by spawning next to the standing stones. Unsure of what's happened, A voice explains to you that you need to collect some stones and return them back to where you are currently standing. 

The problem facing the player is that these stones have been scattered randomly across the world and they are all well guarded by some deadly robot hunters. There isn't much explanation on why or how the robots got here, but one thing players learn very quickly when playing this game is that these robots only want you dead.

A world is made up of five islands: the centre is where you begin and has islands connected north, south, east and west. While the world is randomly generated at the start of the game, you can choose to have each island stick to a theme or bio dome and there are a few different bio domes to select from. 

Some bio domes available are simple rural areas which provide plenty of long grass, bushes and some villages. Old Crumbling castles, Stone work and Tall Churches and my favourite The Industrial Bio Dome. Gloomy skies, Brick Mills and Huge abandoned factories. 

The enviroments are well detailed, you wont see any bright and happy skies as the usual weather forecase is often overcast and cloudly. Accompanied by dark surroundings that constrast with a world of no electricty. However the coloured clouds by the sunset or sunrise in the mornings can often leave some incredible wallpaper worthy like pictures but they also enhance the feeling of being alone in the wilderness. 

And while you may feel alone, There's always something out there to remind you that you're not.

The Robots have many different forms. Your average hunter robot smokes a pipe, carrys a rifle and looks left and right, while patroling his area. They will talk to other robots in their strange robotic voice, sometimes you can work out what they're saying too and its funny.

Early on the robots are found walking through the area, and you can always expect them to be near some fragements of the stones you are trying to collect. If you manage to snatch one  of them and return it back to the standing stones where you spawned, You'll be a step closer to winning the game, but more advanced robots appear...

should you set one of these bots off They'll aim to chase you and find a good range to shoot you. Be aware, It will not take them long to take you down. The early robots may appear to be dumb for a while but 3 or 4 shots and you're dead. 

It's also worth noting that taking damage you risk a chance to bleed, if you dont treat the wound asap you could possibly bleed out and eventually die very quickly. The sense of panic while trying to apply a bandage as well as having a robot chase you for a better shot is fun in its own way   

Bleeding? Bandages? You'll need to carry some for a lot of 'just in case' scenarios so players will need to plunder houses, buildings and anything else that may contain loot. Because while you're looking for ammo for guns, tools to distract the robots or first aid. You'll need to look after you're vitality meter too. Fortunately this isn't too hard to look after, Simply keep this meter high up and you'll heal  and have energy to run and jump. you'll start by eating dead rats, old eggs and maybe even cat food but over time you'll find more healthier things to maintain good vitality. 

By the way, Try the mushrooms... 

The best part of this game is the sense of flight or fight. 
Sure you might have loads of ammo and you're good shot with your gun, but opening fire may alert robots near by and draw them closer. The other idea is using traps and devices to distract robots so you can walk past, loot a certain building or even take one of those special rocks to win the game. Ammo doesn't show up very often, so you will need to find alternatives to deal with robots if they stand in your way without drawing attention to yourself or resorting to violence. 

Sir, you are being hunted provides many great moments where you will enjoy outwitting the robots for your own gain and frantic moments running like a fugitive and never looking behind you because it means death. The Vitality system makes the player remember the on going need for surivial but it isn't too difficult or complex and the variety of enemy robots deliver different types of AI and behaviour, they can be hilarious at times but in the right scenarios can be intimidating and sometimes even scary. 

I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys FPS and enjoys the whole stealth approach and having their brains tested, Also use headphones with surround sound for the best experince.",1421910080,1421910080,True,2,0,0.532237708568572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In this very fun, excruciatingly painful experience are some gems of game creation, and some rather hilarious very very very bad glitches. 

Pros:
-Regardless of some of the reviews, the gunplay is very well-balanced and the perfect level of difficulty.
-Inventory Management is always fun in games and this game handles it well.
-Stealth and distraction techniques are difficult but rewarding.
-Item descriptions are occasionally hilarious.
-AI is very very good and finding you and blowing you and your snazzy tweeds away.
-Food system is awesome.
-Enemies are scary.
-Getting drunk in this game is entertaining.. (Not in real life.)
-Good story premise.
-Good weapons.
-Neat Class system.
-Funny town names.
-The Great Marmalade Famine.
-Fires.
-Climbing trees.

Cons:
-What with the world being randomly generated, there are some terrible if hilarious terrains to navigate.
-The Scarecrow.
-AI tracking is great but buggy.
-No Multiplayer yet.
-Gets rather repetetive.
-The Riders kill you almost instantly, but a good challenge to have.
-Landowners.
-The Dark.
-Graphics are meh.
-Animals are incredibly stupid, can't do anything right.
-Not being able to go for a swim without being ripped to shreds.
-Not enough Tea and Biscuts.
-Lacking story.
-Feels rather abandoned.

The Good/Bad Stuff:
-Face it, this game is in beta and was VERY RUSHED. But this game is still hilarious in its shattered beauty.
-The robots are amazing at their jobs and it SUCKS to be on the other side.
-The terrain can kill you if you are not good at not falling off cliffs.
-The Scanner attracts robots with its irritating -BEEP- BEEP- BEEF-
-Not super scary.


Conclusion: Buy it. Wait for a sale, but buy it. This game is broken. But it is beautiful none-the-less. Great time waster and something to do when you have nothing to do. Shoot Robots and DRINK ALL THE TEA!!!

SYABH has the parts of DayZ Arma2 mod that I really enjoyed; sneaking around a dangerous landscape, scavenging for supplies, limited prowess through firearms, and made a nice little game out of it.  

It's not very deep, but it's still fun.  There's some really funny moments, but the focus is more on running around, scared, and hoping a Robot doesn't spot you before you find another hiding spot.  

Maybe a little too easy once you get the hang of it.  And it's no doubt the game would've benefited from a month or 2 more of development.  Such as:

- Greater variety of robots.  There's a handful of different ones, and they are all very different, but it seems like there is room for more.  

- Crafting would've given this game another layer of complexity.  There's many throwaway items you find in the various houses you loot.  Why not give everything in the game a use?  Put spices on rabbit before cooking it to gain a boost.  Or even weapon customization.  Would've loved to have a silenced or even scoped pistol, providing that I gathered up the supplies needed to craft one.

- Explorable interiors

- Better textures.  Although I loved the atmosphere and the open landscape feel of most of the game, I sometimes feel like they didn't put enough time into making the world look nice.  I'm not a stickler for graphics, but there could've been more done in that sense.


All in all, I really like this game.  It's fun and that's what counts the most.  I just feel that where other developers would've spent some extra time to polish this game, this one was sent out the door a little too early.",1421565855,1421565855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i][b]Hello all lets sit down and have some Tea and Biscuits and talk about Sir,You are Being Hunted.I really like this game! The mix of FPS ,Stealth and Survival mechanics come together pretty nice in this game.The controls are your standard FPS set up,so its cake if you play any fps games. I think what grabs you the most and draws you in is the look and the atmosphere of this game. This is what a good team does with the Unity Engine (Incomeing Unity Haters in 5...4...3...2...1.. :P ).

The only draw back i think this game is missing is 2 things Co-Op and Steam Workshop !! I think these two things would have brought me over the top with this title!But all in all a killer single player game!

{Hold on governor...Just got this new news over the call box} Wait what... You mean they added Co-Op ??? GOOD SHOW OLD CHAPS !!!

So if you havent by now put down your Tea and Biscuits and go Pick this game up !!! CHEERS!!! PIP PIP CHEERIO!!! [/b][/i]",1421558210,1454310012,True,44,16,0.565388143062591553,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Both the people who cite the game's enjoyable systems and the people who claim these systems fall flat are, in my opinion, correct, since the ability to respawn with minimal lost progress after every death both destroys the otherwise well-created tension in the game, and makes the optimal strategy a tedious and repetivie sucide dash for the machine pieces scattered across the islands. However, once I realised the ability to respawn was the source of these problems, I switched to playing the game in a self-enforced permadeath (delete world manually on death) fashion, and the game almost magically became the tense, engaging stealth and survival game it had always promised to be!

In conclusion, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game, but only when played in the permadeath fashion it feels like it was designed for (though the devs never even mentioned it!). Devs, if you're reading this, for goodness sake, ADD A PERMADEATH MODE! (Also I'm sure we'd all appreciate the promised multiplayer).",1421535841,1421535841,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It feels more like an early access game at this point, but since it is now out of alpha, I wouldn't hope for the developers to be adding any large amount of new content at any time in the future.

I was reminded of the game thanks to Jim Sterling's Squirty-play of it, and instantly threw it on my wishlist to be bought later, 24 hours go by and it went on sale for $4 and I jumped at the chance. Ever since then I can say with confidence the purchase was well worth, though I do agree with the general consensus that it could use some tweaking/optimization, and there's plenty of room for additions both in the robots, items/usage of items, and environments departments.
  
  What ""Sir"" brings together is plenty of experiences that I've had with other games into one package: Paranoia, fear, excitement, all fuel your actions as you strive to escape the islands and the gently-but-lethal mechanized foes that are hunting you. The eerie and contextual music adds a layer of tension, and ambiance that draws me back to playing older PC games like Myst for the atmosphere, though the subtly oppressive one in this game has a flavor all it's own, a very british one at that with a thin layer of dry dark comedy. The art style, robot designs, and music compliment one another, and fit snugly. The game-play is tense to the point I found in some moments hiding in the tall grass from a pack of hunters passing through, holding my breath in real life as if it would matter in my attempts to go unnoticed, as well as outwardly panicking when the bullets started to fly. Sneaking about takes time, though the gun-play is an alternative, bullets are scarce, the Enemy-AI is a sharp as their aim is fine, and will notice when things are amiss, ensuring you have to be alert and considerate of your actions, or your cranium will be their new trophy. The game has tons of potential it can strive towards, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing take on the survival genre, challenging, unique, and more British than the queen of England herself, where else are you going to snack on Fish&chips while reloading a pistol and hiding in the bushes from top-hat wearing killer robots?",1421312442,1421312442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's an interesting premise and the stealth aspect of the game is well done, but unfortunately not much else is.

The biggest problem I had with the game is that the islands are just too big, and the stones are increadibly hard to find. It ends up being a needle in a haystack senario and I spent most of my time sprinting around the island in circles just trying to find the tiny little stones. After that, the ""survival"" aspect of the game seems shoehorned in. You have to eat food every once in a while in order to stay alive, meaning you're forced to go into areas with lots of guards just to get some food to eat as there is literally no other reason to go in those areas.

The game could be improved if you spent more time sneaking into areas to grab stones instead of just running around until you find one or get hungry.

As the amount of robots hunting you increases so to do does the variety. Each one is vastly different and you must relearn many of the lessons you have learnt before.

I want  to spend my money correctly... but this time around I just wanted to try something I didn't know anything about--- I made a huge mistake

Don't get me wrong, the game by itself has infinite amount of potential, but the execution? Really terrible

The ""tetris like""inventory management is greatly done and innovative... that's what I thought at first... but as you find pieces of the... thing (?) it gets full in no time and you have to go back and forth between islands.
The saves, goddamn, the saves! Why can't you save whenever you want? Why do you have to be in a boat or go to the Stonehenge construction thingy? Why? It seems like the developers wanted a way to keep you as busy as possible, when instead, they are just annoying you with having to do all those ungrateful tasks. 
The combat is decent, but really, the same everytime: get in area, kill 2-3 bots, get out. That's it!
Traps are also friking terrible.

Another HUGE problem is how big the island are: this isn't a real problem by itself, but considering that most of the times you will have to sneak around enemies... it could litterally take you 15 minutes to get from one side to another of the map.
The looting is uninteresting, the game lacks rare and cool guns, bibs and bobs, goddamn for a game that's, in great part, composed of looting, the only things you find are rat meat and useless junk 90% of the times?

No. No. No.

Why I played only half an hour? Because I wasn't even able to equip a weapon from the inventory (using both controller or keyboard/mouse). The game doesn't even have a tutorial, and nowhere it is explained, and it is not intuitive. So, after half an hour of frustration (I've played a lot of games, and never it happened to me to not even be able to equip a weapon!!) I quit.

In that half an hour I've also noticed very poor graphics quality. No, I know that is the art-style (and I kinda like it), I mean other things, like the grass billboards for example. If you look at the grass, you immediately realize it's 2D graphic file that is there to represent grass. I am a novice hobbyst Unity developer and even I know it can be done better. And the opening scene is made of static hand painted images that are so badly painted that I think they were made by a 14 years old art school student.

La idea es genial. Te sueltan en unas islas y unos robots van a cazarte. T√∫ te las tienes que apa√±ar como puedas: recogiendo cosas, montando trampas, rob√°ndoles armas... ¬øTe suena de algo? A m√≠ me sonaba mucho a 'Acorralado' porque soy viejo pero a los chavales de ahora quiz√°s les suene m√°s a 'Los juegos del Hambre' (aunque tus contrincantes son superiores a ti en t√©cnica y no se matan entre ellos).

El caso es que el juego es result√≥n. Tienes esa sensaci√≥n de estar siendo cazado, con los nervios de punta, correteando entre las hierbas altas o refugi√°ndote tras unas rocas mientras intentas buscar una manera de escapar o cargarte a alg√∫n cazador. 

Los robots son bastante implacables as√≠ que por ese lado no hay queja. Las armas, el sistema de comida, las heridas. Todo correcto. Si te gustan los juegos de tipo 'survival' creo que √©ste te parecer√° entretenido. Hay gente que se queja de que te curas con un bot√≥n... claro: si consigues las vendas. No s√©... igual quer√≠an que te curases haciendo un torniquete con un palo virtual o algo as√≠. Hay quejas que nunca comprender√©... 

Por desgracia hay otra queja de la que s√≠ me hago eco porque lastra significativamente el resultado final: las casas son de cart√≥n piedra. Cuando te acercas a una puerta y la examinas te devuelve un resultado de cosas para el inventario, pero no puedes entrar. Creo que si eso llega a funcionar recomendar√≠a el juego a todo el mundo.

Aparte de eso es evidente que la mec√°nica del juego es repetitiva: huye, mata, roba, recoge las piedras m√°gicas (si las completas ganas el juego, aunque yo nunca lo llegu√© a hacer). Poco m√°s.

I suppose the real thing holding me back on Sir (it's going to make me sound like a casual noob but) is its difficulty. The robots are way too smart and it makes just about every strategy I try guaranteed to fail at least five times. Not the mention the fact that robots have a tendency to always gather around lootable buildings and never leave. I‚Äôm always forced to do some sort of trickery that, like I mentioned before, never seems to work on them. Later, I figured that the fastest strategy actually just involved running through and looting as fast as I can since the robots were always too smart for any of my tricks to reliably work efficiently. 

Even ignoring all of that, the game‚Äôs charm wears off after about an hour of play, and what you‚Äôre left with is poorly designed sneaking sections that encourage exploiting to get through them and a combat system obviously designed to make you NOT want to use it.

I want to like this game, I really do. I'm British and no longer living in the UK so this game does a good job of making me feel at home. It is very quirky, has a tinge of black comedy about it and is very British, however...

This is one of those games where you have to spend alot of time playing it... dying repeatedly, starting again, rinse and repeat trying to do a little better each time. While alot of players are into this, I am not one of them and instead favor games with progression. 

I will say that it's very hard because your character needs to eat every 10 minutes and the amount of food in any given game won't be able to fill a saucer, let alone your belly. Not only do you have hunger to contend with but also robots with insanely good aim which all seem to huddle around the objects that you need to collect to progress. Killing them really isn't an option as there are usually so many around at any given time and distracting them works for only a few seconds and they WILL spot you before you are able to grab the object and hide.

I dunno just feels like it could do with some more work maybe some tweaking. The general gameplay as is right now, is basically: Start game, find one fragment (the objectives) get hungry, spend ages trying to look for food before going for another fragment which is heavily guarded. Try to kill/distract them, fail and end up sprinting away while getting shot at as if you were caught with the farmers daughter. If you survive, hand the fragment in and then eventually end up starving to death or running out of bandages/ammo/distractions very quickly.

I know alot of people are into this masochistic kind of gameplay but I like to relax and enjoy a game. If you are like me then you should avoid this game, if you like the sound of what I described or you like to play RPGs on ""hardcore mode"" you'll probably love it.

Oh and despite the bragging there is neither tea nor biscuits. I know that your ""servant"" narrator promises them but I am dubious about anything he says.",1421002260,1421074826,False,14,2,0.422565221786499023,3,True,False,False,False,,,

[u] Let's start with the things I liked: [/u]

[b] Open world [/b] - First time I jumped into the game I had no idea where to go. North? West? East? South? Stay in Central? In that specific moment of time, I felt the game was drenching me with choices and oppertunities. I like those moments very much and they get rarer each time I play.
  
[b] Random generation [/b] - This is a part of the game I also enjoyed. When you start a new game you'll have the option to change what biome the islands will have (Except for the center island. It's always rural.) and the amount of enemies you'll face.

[b] The thrill of being hunted [/b] - Since this is a game about stealth, it will punish you for not being stealthy enough and it does so by letting the robots run after you and try to kill you if you've been spotted. Robots will also alert other robots nearby of your presence, which makes the game alot tougher. I have gotten myself hunted and killed a number of times and sometimes a special type of robot will hide in thick patches of forest and wait until you get close enough to them.

[u] And now the things I didn't like: [/u]

[b] Graphics and textures [/b] - After about 27 hours of running around on islands looking for fragments I have noticed certain graphical errors such as bricks you're able to see through and houses that looks like tall buildings that just sank into the ground until they hit something. 
The textures makes me cringe a little, especially one of the ground textures that reminds me of Call of Duty's digital camouflage but with fitting colours instead of the traditional black, white and grey. Another example of my despise towards some of the textures is in the castle biome. I enjoy walking up in castletowers and looking down on robots with my binoculars but I always notice that the inside of the towers have the exact same texture as the outside which I find to be a little annoying.

[b] The goal of the game [/b] - Collect 17 pieces from the islands. Bring them back to spawn. Win the game. This entire process is quite boring and it prevents me from continuing to play due to all of the motivation that was drained when acquiring just a few of these fragments. 
An example of my train-of-thought when returning fragments:
""Alright! Returned 3 in a go and I have ... 9 fragments left?!? *sigh*"" 
""Screw it! I'll deal with this later.""

[b] The gunplay [/b] - I have to admit that the firearms and weapons lacks authenticity in both sound, look and feeling. The guns have a very basic design and the reload animations are basically non-existent. The revolver's cylinder doesn't pop out of its place so new bullets can get in and double-barreled hunting shotguns doesn't break in the middle. It just tilts itself in a way that makes me think that a hole opens and new shells glide in without me seeing it. 
The game compensates this by making ammunition so rare that it is nearly impossible to really observe and analyze how a certain weapon looks and feels like.

[b] Survival [/b] - Survival in games is generally a value that the player has. The player needs to find objects that reduces this value from reaching zero. Survival in this game is exactly what I just described. You walk around and look inside buildings in order to find something to ""eat"". No sound is played to amplify the feeling of eating. You just ""use"" the item, it disappears and your hunger has a slightly higher value. 

[b] Buildings [/b] - Houses and buildings is a common sight in ""Sir, you are being hunted"". It can get people pretty excited when they can imagine themselfs walking into an uninhabited shelter, desperately looking ammunition, food or tools. Or just seeking refuge. That doesn't apply to this game. Houses in ""Sir, you are being hunted"" have the same function as a chest or a crate. 
You open it up, take what you need then leave. This will make houses in this game useless if you ever need to take cover in them. I personally wish I could get inside houses when I'm being chased. Getting cornered when hiding behind a giant rektangle is one of the worst ways to die, I imagine.
However, this doesn't apply to the aforementioned castletowers.

The sound of a robot is distressing and you need to turn on your hyper perception to see and hear them before they see you. Sometimes, a gun fight is unavoidable, the best cover with fast thinking and reactions are needed when a robot lifts his gun in your direction. Stressful decisions must be made all the time; fight or flight, stealth or rush, stop bleeding or keep running, rush or stealth. There are many different types of robots after you and jump scares should be expected frequently. On top of the action and stealth, there is breathe taking scenery, 5 very different biomes and the world is always changing weather and time of day. 

I personally find this game hard to play due to all the stress it gives me but it's certainly rewarding. I have yet to play this game properly due to lost progress in previous updates. The developers have not added more content in a long time due to some networking issues of a multiplayer update. They are planning to release the multiplayer update early next year and I'm highly anticipating coop with friends. As a result, the game is still a bit barren like a beta but it should get more content and details in the future. Even though a great deal of improvement of a great game can be expected in the future give some thought about getting this game now to support the great indie developers.

In the past I made it clear how disappointed I was with how the game was turning out, and now I'd like to step back and review the game, the developers, and the history of both in their entirety.

The game taken completely by itself, with no consideration of the developers or the Alpha development phase, I feel is a decent but flawed stealth shooter. There's some fun to be had in sneaking around in the tall grass, but nearly every other aspect of the game has something wrong with it. 

Exploring is flawed in that there are far too many ""dead zones"" with nothing interactive in them. 

Looting is flawed in that nearly all loot is gotten from largely non-interactive buildings, as enemies rarely have valuable things to offer when defeated. This is also a flaw of combat, since the lack of valuable items means there is very little reward for winning a gunfight. 

Combat is also not exceptionally fun because it doesn't have much gravity. Bleeding can be cured with a single button, health regenerates, and most enemies are weak and easily evaded or defeated. 

Music doesn't appear to play a large role in the game. I recall hearing an opening theme, which was interesting, but not memorable.

Graphically, the game has a lot of heart, which I appreciate, but at the same time it's got a very dated, rushed look. Most objects have bland, flat textures and barely react graphically to light. Even the guns looks like they're made of matte plastic, not wood and steel. 

The rushed look is present in other elements of the game as well, such as the user interface, which lacks key features like a quick option to discard something (there's no discard button, there's no dragging the item off the inventory screen, there's no icon to drag over, just a context menu opened with M2) or the ability to stack similar items (bullets cannot be stacked once separated, be careful with your rifle ammo). 

Animations look sped up and choppy, though this may be on purpose for the robots. There are no reload animations, instead the character lowers his guns offscreen and reload sounds are played. 

And finally, the AI is not exceptionally good at tracking you. Even the searchlight, which can see you even when you're perfectly hidden, will forget where you are if you're near a building.

Overall, I'd say it's worth a play if you could pick it up on sale, but it's certainly not worth $20, not for this level of roughness around the edges.

Now, taking into consideration this game had an alpha stage in which quite a bit of money was raised for its complete development, and that there are multiple developers who have had years to fine-tune and polish the game, the overall image becomes considerably less positive. Instead of appearing to be due to time delays or personal problems, the lacking aspects appear to be due to developer inexperience or possibly even laziness.

It has been made clear to me that the developers are a team of ten or so people with decent but not exceptional talent in making games. It has also been made clear that funding was a large concern for them during development. However, a similarly sized team with inconsistent funding and only two experienced game designers was responsible for the creation of GoldenEye 64, which was lauded as one of the greatest first-person shooter games of all time and maintains that status even now (96 on Metacritic, compared to this game's 63). If a team with similar resources and worse technology can make something so memorable, the only thing keeping the developers of SYABH from doing the same is the developers themselves.

It's an unpleasant but well-known fact that game developers who are paid for their work ahead of time can be known to cut corners or even abandon projects at a whim. KickStarter and IndieGogo are rife with such half-finished and abandoned projects. This game, while at the very least playable and somewhat enjoyable, is certainly not finished, and definitely should not have been released from alpha in its current state.

And this doesn't even take into account the fact that many of the lacking features were requested by the community, but outright ignored by the developers during the alpha phase. One of the most requested features was interactive buildings, even something as simple as a 3d door that opened when interacted with. All of these were labeled ""too difficult to implement"" by the developers and ignored. 

This reveals much of their mentality during development. Even during the alpha stage, they'd already decided what the scope of game would be like. Implying that the community had any say in the matter was at best misleading and at worst outright lying. Furthermore, since they already had the finshed project in mind, releasing the game from alpha stage is a sign that they consider that pre-defined scope nearly reached. The fact that they're currently working on additions that do not expand gameplay, such as bugfixes for already implemented features and controller support, seems to enforce this conclusion.

I bought this game when it was on sale during its alpha phase and followed the development for quite some time before it became apparent to me that these developers were not going to produce a finished game. It appears instead they've opted to produce the bare minimum according to their own standards and not the community's. I'll say again, this game has heart, but it just doesn't have enough life in it currently for me to recommend it

Ich bin ein wenig gespalten und wei√ü nicht was ich zu ""Sir, You Are Being Hunted"" sagen soll. Das Spiel versetzt mich in einen Zwiespalt der Gedanken. Ich bin sowohl fasziniert als auch ern√ºchtert, ich war verbl√ºfft und ver√§rgert.
Das mag sich negativ anh√∂ren, aber ich nehme vorweg, es ist ein gutes Spiel. Jedoch keine Innovation.

Die Geschichte ist plump und simpel. Roboter britischer Abstammung jagen uns quer durch ihre Welt. Sie haben es sich zum Sport gemacht uns, einen Menschen, zu jagen. Unsere Aufgabe ist es dabei Teleportfragmente zu den Teleportsteinen zu bringen, diese dort wieder zusammen zu setzen und uns dann in ein anderes Universum zu teleportieren.

Zu Beginn w√§hlen wir eine Klasse aus, welche eigentlich keine gro√üe Bedeutung hat, au√üer das diese bestimmt, welche Ausr√ºstung sich am Anfang in unseren Inventar befindet. Sind wir ein ehemaliger Sheriff? So besitzen wir einen Revolver mit Munition zum nachladen und Verb√§nde. Sind wir dagegen ein Aristokrat, so besitzen wir viele Trash-Items und m√ºssen uns ein Inventar zusammensuchen.

Was mich definitiv fasziniert hat war die Spielwelt. Es herrscht eine d√ºstere Atmosph√§re, wir verstecken uns im hohen Gras und hinter H√§usern und B√§umen, um blo√ü nicht entdeckt zu werden. Denn sollte dies der Fall sein, hei√üt es: ""Sir, you are being shot"". Die J√§ger nehmen Ma√ü und ballern los. Wir nehmen die Beine in die Hand und versuchen raum zwischen uns und der Verfolgern zu schaffen. Aber das ist gar nicht mal so einfach, da Sch√ºsse und ""Schreie"" der J√§ger, gleichgesinnte aus der Umgebung anlocken. So kann es schnell mal vorkommen, dass man einigen Robotern mehr in die Augen guckt.

Die J√§ger stehen aber meistens an Hotspots, wie St√§dten oder D√∂rfern, oder an den gesuchten Teleportfragmenten. Sodass man sich abseits nahezu ungest√∂rt bewegen kann. Als Ausgleich dazu streunen ab und an Patrouillen durch die Pr√§rie, das Gef√ºhl der stetigen Angst entdeckt zu werden bleibt.

Die Art und Weise wie wir ans Ziel gelangen bleibt uns √ºberlassen. Entweder baller ich die Bewacher von H√§usern und Fragmenten nieder, oder ich lenke sie ab. Als Ablenkung dienen hier verschiedenste Items, wie Fackeln oder Feuer, oder akustische Ablenkung wie Wecker oder eine aufziehbare Spielzeuglok. Ja so etwas gibt es. 

Was mich jedoch ein wenig st√∂rt ist, dass man die Standort der J√§ger vorweg erahnen kann. Man h√∂rt sie auf eine unglaublich weite Entfernung. Bei riesen Robotern verstehe ich, dass man von weit weg das Gestampfe h√∂rt, aber m√ºssen J√§ger bereits aus der Distanz so gut zu h√∂ren sein? Das macht es oft zu einfach.
Des Weiteren ist es zu einfach die J√§ger abzuh√§ngen, zumindest die Standardj√§ger.

Aber das ist meckern auf hohem Niveau.

Grafisch ist das Spiel stimmig. HD-Texturen sucht man vergeblich, aber es h√§tte auch nicht gepasst. Ich finde die Models humorvoll. Generell liegt auf dem Spiel immer ein Hauch Humor. 

Alles in Einem gefiel mir das Spiel. Das Gef√ºhl gejagt zu werden und sich zu verstecken, da man der kleine Schwache ist, ist spannend. Insbesondere die Momente in denen es zum Kampf kommt sind spannend.
Ich empfehle das Spiel, auch wenn mir die KI ab und an zu schwach war, und man immer wieder das Gleiche macht um ans Ziel zu kommen, ablenken oder niederm√§hen.

Ich habe das Spiel 2-Mal durchgespielt und habe etwas die Motivation verloren, was es keineswegs zu einen schlechten Spiel machen.
Ich m√∂chte damit nur sagen, dass der Preis ein wenig zu hoch ist, das Preis-/Leistungsverh√§ltnis also nicht so stimmig ist. Aber im SALE aufjeden Fall sein Geld wert.",1416315395,1417521152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has great atmosphere, great mechanics, a lot of humour and of course tea and biscuits! Everything in this game is perfectly crafted to make you laugh or send shivers down your spine. The enemies have an overall good A.I. and they feel threathing even when they make jokes about the weather, the ""oultrageous"" taxes or what they gonna do to your body once they have killed you. (Note: Some enemies don't make jokes at all...they are the more scary.) The Landscapes are just beatiful even with this graphic that's only slightly above average,thanks to the haunting lightining and original concept design.In every step of the way through this game, you really feel haunted while you grasp to find new ways to survive at any new challenge. It has some little issues like a disorganized inventory, the complete absence of indoor enviroments and the absence of a true narrative, but they don't take much away from a game that is still in development with many new ideas and that is allready incredibly fun. Ah, and the developers are currently creating the multyplayer. How cool is that?!  

Recommend if: You want a true survival experience.
You like original games with a vivid personality.
You want to both laugh and be scared.

Don't recommend if: You want some more narrative.
You can't handle the tension of being haunted like a bloddy rabbit.",1415551189,1415551189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This really seemed up my alley--turns out that was mostly the (misleading) trailer.  I played through a few hours of mild disappointment, thinking I would just beat it and be done.  I had cleared 3 of 5 islands at this point, and had quickly come to expect nothing but more of the same monotonous slog of gameplay from beginning to end.

So I go to the West island and... my boat dock procedurally generated right into a sheer cliff's butthole.  No matter, I shrug it off, as I just finished the mountain island and learned you can jump up about any embankment.  At the top of this one was one of the Mysterious Fragments, and some robuts wandering about.  HOWEVER, I must have been wearing a stovepipe tophat I was unaware of, as one of them saw me, behind some thick grass hanging off the edge of a cliff.  After I use my last marshmellow ammo on them, I sigh and reload.  Walking up the dock to bang my head against this, not the first nor last samey, mind-numbing obstacle in this game, a bundle of those robot arms that sprout from water shoot up THROUGH THE DOCK.  I decide not to take any evasive action, and the next keys I press are Alt and F4, followed by Delete Local Content.  I can't think of a single game that's done this to me, or that I did to it in return.  And that was just the straw that broke the camel.

You have to find pieces scattered around generated islands and bring them back to the starting position to do 'something' (What that something is I don't know, I never finished it). As you progress new enemies will appear that will ramp up the difficulty. The way I see it this game has 3 main elements, combat, stealth and exploration.

The exploration aspect of the game is extremely lacking as there is rarely anything interesting to find. Just more and more houses to scavenge for supplies and the occasional 'something' piece. You can find diaries and stuff that help you understand the setting but they are rare'ish loot and without them there is barely any kind of narrative. It's just not fun to explore because there is nothing worth finding. Just more random houses that does nothing.

The combat in the game is boring, I understand that it is not meant to be a combat oriented game and that you need to preserve your resources in order to survive long-term, but whenever combat 'does' happen it is extremely clunky. I ended up just sitting behind a wall and then waiting for a robot to pop around the corner so I could blow the head off and that's it. There are traps you can use (which are especially useful for the robot dogs) but the enemies might not walk into a trap and then you might be shit out of luck.

And finally, the stealth, in order to not attract attention you need to sneak around sometimes but when you progress far enough into the game it becomes a necessity to stealth in order to avoid being clusterfucked by dogs. The problem? It's a sandbox world where you have to travel large distances. It isn't fun to move the speed of a slug when all you want to is to just get another damn 'something' piece. The stealth works well enough on its own merits but the problem is the amount of distance you need to travel 'and' the necessity to use stealth. It becomes tedious real fast.

The setting is really interesting, the enemies are well designed, the concept behind stealthing around and using resources is great. But the gameplay is boring, repetitive and tedious.

What the game needs is a stronger narrative, it needs to ditch the generated islands in favor for consistent set-pieces, it needs to polish the resources system, the healing system and the combat system. It needs to have something more worthwhile to find while exploring, like unique mini-bosses, NPC's, locations, puzzles and traps.

I've started without watching any trailer, without knowing anything about the game. Just after a few minutes I got into the system and immediately felt the survival aspect. After gathering some orbs, a new robot comes into play, which is a cool feature itself, but the discovery of it is the main thing. Wandering through the woods and seeing just a glimpse of a robot you have never seen before, wanting to get a closer look but without risking your life.
I have to mention, I don't use the save-function. I play 'hardcore' which adds some more of the survival instinct and makes me overthink my actions. As the maps are all random generated, it makes sense to start over from a whole new map. 
As there are 5 different Islands and each one has its own theme, it is again all about the discovery, still in mind that some robot could spot you while you are admiring an interesting building or strucuture. The balance between ""I really want to see what that is"" and ""I hope it doesn't kill me though"" is perfect. 
Like I said, it might be the fanboy effect I'm suffering from, but I got this from various chases through the woods, resulting in a firefight in a small village, while trying to get some robots into a trap I originally set up just to gather another one of these crystals.

I... Wow.

This is one of those games that is a lot cooler than it seems so let me try to paint you a word picture.

*ahem*
First, there is a whole 'survival' element I never really noticed in any of the videos on the store page. Its very simple, however, a vitality meter to symbolize hunger. And an inventory of junk, cookable food, and the tetris box-style inventory screen.

Next is the 'horror' element. It isnt objectivly scary, like real horror games, but play this game with headphones with the volume turned up. Bird's wings flapping as you stir a grouse from the bushes. By the way, your hunters will see and hear this and the looming ever presence of a spotter in a hot air balloon breathing down your neck make you think out every move carefully.

This game EXCELS in atmosphere and simplicity.

What it doesnt excel at is inventory. Equiping items really needs to be done before you need them. However I think that's by design.

Yet, it was a mixed experience overall. My biggest issues were;

1)The trailer is quite misleading. The game has pretty gloomy and dark atmosphere, not comical as the trailer was. So my initial feeling was disappointment, because game was nothing that the trailer made it look to be. But eventually, the atmosphere of the game stands on its own. Just be prepared that the game is not as funny as the trailer.

2)I didnt feel that the procedural system adds anything to the game. The environments are made randomly for each playthrough, but there is not enough variery in the landscape patterns to make any worthwhile differences via procedural system. Its the same barren lands, and having the same trees in little different places doesnt really enchant the gameplay. The game is not a roguelike either. When you die (and you die very easily), you dont start the game from a 0, but just load a checkpoint. This imho kills the point of randomly generated world, since you dont need to really adapt into new world every time you play it, like you would do in Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Spelunky, etc. In this game, I kept thinking that it would be much better, if the open world was well planned solid world full of unique situations, instead of a procedural world.

3)Sneaking is too hard, and too punishing. The distances in the game are very very long, and most of the gametime you will be running from point A to B, without really sneaking. But when you reach a point where you ""must"" sneak, often its better just to shoot the enemy who is in your way, and run away as fast as you can. Doing proper sneaking can take a lot, lot of time, and getting spotted by enemy when too near to them is almost 100% death to you, which will mean a lot and lot of time wasted due to rare checkpoints. If you run and gun instead, you will lose only a 1-2 minutes of your time (most spent on running), instead of 10-20 minutes you would spend trying to sneak properly.

Overall I was somewhat disappointed with the game, but liked the idea and style of it enough, that I wish the developers move into a new interesting and unique projects soon. Apparently this game is getting a multiplayer someday, but IMHO its waste of time of the devs, and they should just make a new game instead.

There's a lot to like on paper with Sir, and even once you are in the game some of that potential shines through gloriously.

However, of this never quite comes together in a cohesive whole. The game feels incomplete, and seems to lack some more substance and depth, in terms of gameplay, goals, and story. The AI of the robots ruthlessly hunting you down is actually quite good, but the process of evasion, distriction, fleeing, and/or fighting them quickly becomes tedious and uninteresting; and this interaction is supposed to be the focus of the gameplay! Often times the best strategy is to just sprint around grabbing your objectives and ignoring the thoughful stealthy approach, which should not really be possible, and essentially breaks the way the game is clearly designed to be played. Also, after the initial cutscene, there is next to no story or world development, which is a somewhat bizarre decision, as the setting is one of the most compelling aspects of the game. Where the hell am I, and what is the backstory of these tweed clad robo-gentlemen? Who is my character, and who is this myserious Butler who speaks at the game's beginning? Why are all these houses abandoned? None of your questions will ever even be acknowledged by the game, let aloned answered, which is a major cop-out for an incrediblely unique and interesting set-up. Additionally, the random world generation, while ambitious and great in theory, doesn't always work out well, and leads to really weird and hard to navigate terrain and towns at times, which also helps to undermine alternative playstyles and the believability of these strange islands actually being a real place.

Much of this seems to stem from the sudden jump in development from late Alpha to full release earlier this year; as someone who was supporting the game from almost day one, it seemed somewhat inconsistent with the planned development of the game, and the final product is proof of that. I feel that development dragged on internally, and once a workable build without significant bugs was finished, with enough development bullet points technically checked off, and a decent existing player base, the developers pushed the game out, without actually confirming if the game actually worked like they had intended it to. I hesitate to say it, but I would argue it does not.

If there are any more large updates for Sir to bring some fullness to the package (such as the often promised, but as of yet undelivered exciting competitive/cooperative multiplayer mode), this may still become realized as a great game. And I hope it does because many of the pieces are here, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have good fun with it at times. However I cannot recommend the game in its current and sadly, final state (if the developers are to be believed), and have taken Sir as a lesson in the dangers of supporting overly ambitious early access games, even if the developers are genuine in their intentions.",1413735060,1413735060,False,1129,8,0.90620952844619751,21,False,False,False,False,,,

But that's it.
I'd expect this to be a beta or even an alpha or be sold for $5.

A short synopsis: (don't worry about spoilers because there's little to no plot to spoil)
You pick a character, generate a group of five islands, and then begin. With a smug sounding narrator telling you some basic information every so often, you quickly pick up the basics of gameplay of movement, looting, and stealth.
And then thats it.
You just wander around an island searching for rocks to put in a bigger rock while avoiding robots that are hunting you.
Sure there are letters and little tea sets you can look at but they serve no purpose. After a certain point the narrator even says that he'll be gone and you're on your own for the rest of the game. No crafting, no special items or gamemodes that can only be obtained with certain actions. The only real difficulty in this game is the lack of inventory space. Robots can be easily avoided by walking in a large circle around them with the use of some alarm clocks.

I'd love to see a crafting system or more variety in the game, being able to pick what type of island each one is and what starting items you recieve is hardly variety. Seriously, just look at Don't Starve for ideas to expand gameplay.

Perhaps the harsh unforgiving landscape of the original hard-core PC genre is simply too much for the AAA studios of today to stomach - given how most of their output has become about as creatively impotent as Michael Bay directing the latest Transformers snore-fest. Well it turns out not all is lost as once again an indie darling swoops in to save the genre with the excellent (if not perfect) Sir, you are being hunted.


But steady on now dear boy! What‚Äôs it all about?

Starting with a wonky hand drawn cutscene (Though narrated by an excellently plummy butler voice-over) the simple premise is presented: Being stranded on a series of very British Isles you are tasked with recovering a series of scattered mystical stone artefacts to activate a kind of magical Stonehenge endgame ‚Äì a simple but effective plot device not only permitting but encouraging the open ended ramble you embark on. Oh - and all the while avoiding the murderous but delightfully polite gentlemen robots who, if you didn't quite catch it already, are out to hunt you.


Go on then, spill the beans! Is it any good?

Endeavouring to avoid the very British habit of meandering around the point I should start by stating the most important thing you need to know: The stealth works. And golly is it a thrilling chase! Sir, makes use of its gloriously procedural open(ish) world and enemy placement to generate a genuinely compelling rhythm of long eerie walks, interrupted by tense moments of avoidance as you slip by patrolling hunters and the occasional run in with live fire in response to which you mostly run for the hills (But often rather the safe bosom of stealth-friendly shrubs and long grass).


Details man, I need the details!

While a shocking amount of AAA games still continue to pile on such migraine inducing modern videogame tropes as overzealous tutorials, quick time events and general (Console era) hand holding, Sir, plays like a greatest hits of all the classic stealth and RPG mechanics of 90s with a dash of the modern survival genre throw in there for good measure. You will manage a classic grid style inventory system. Your enemies will not patronise you with obnoxious alert level visual indicators. You will bleed out in seconds unless you brought bandages with you (And can apply them fast enough). You will not be guided by point defeating objective markers. You will shoot, cook and eat pheasant if you want any chance of surviving your time in the country. In short ‚Äì jolly good times ahead!

With its short but well-structured runtime Sir, can also evoke some very special moments of player agency. Its clever reinterpretation of the classic scaling challenge/empowerment mechanic, invite new opportunities for emergent character development: Building resources and confidence you can eventually embolden yourself to take on the hunters - the cathartic fantasy of transformation from prey to predator or Garret the Master Thief to Gordon Freeman if you like. However with stealth and avoidance mechanics as enjoyable as they are you‚Äôd certainly not be missing out to ghost you way through the entire experience given your ruthlessly oppressive and increasingly thorough adversaries.

Oh, and did I mention it‚Äôs quite funny? Yes indeed. It seems no one is better at capitalising on the pastoral, fox and hound theme than mocker-in-chief (And game designer) Jim Rossignol ‚Äì a Brit himself. I‚Äôm not sure the quintessentially British sense of humour will tickle everyone‚Äôs fancy but if the image of homicidal robots drinking tea is enough to muster a chuckle you‚Äôll probably be ok.


So, you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs rather good then?

Sir you are being Hunted is an inspired stealth gem not to mention a legitimate vision for the genre‚Äôs future. Despite its modest graphics chops, Sir, evokes a mythical version of the British countryside we almost forgot existed. The pervasive sense of danger, juxtaposed against that ancient, almost ethereal beauty conjures a unique sense of place that will linger long in the memory after your short adventure/ordeal ends.


Well then - Bloody good show! Carry on.

Pros:
- Interesting concept - Finally a game that has health/stamina/stealth that doesn't involve zombies
- Differing enemies that can track or chase you in different ways leads to dynamic gameplay
- Stamina / Health system is very simple but works well
- Starting a new game generates the full map to save on load times
- Not a performance hog so it can run on lower end PCs easily

Cons:
- A little easy once you figure out what enemy does what
- You more or less work around enemies. They don't actively hunt you down

Don't mind the number of hours - I've easily put in about 10-15 hours, most of it played offline on my laptop on bus journeys.

I'd rate it about 6/10. I got it on sale, if I recall correctly, so it was rather cheap; and for the price I purchased it at (a few pounds), it proved to be a decent casual game I could pick up and play at just about any time - be it on my desktop, or my outdated laptop, which more often than not struggles to run anything.

So what brought me to this arbitrary rating?

[b]Difficulty: 3/10[/b] -> The game is rather easy. Actually, it is almost ridiculously so at some points due to the ease of evading enemies. It may be a stealth game, but more often than not you'll find yourself running out of the way or taking a different route rather than sneaking past those pesky robots. Why? Because it is easier, faster and generally more simple to do so.

Robots [i]are[/i] somewhat dangerous if you're new to the game - they hit hard and you will probably die pretty fast. But after you've thought up a few tactics to combat them, you'll find that early difficulty gone.

Robots are also fairly easily to spot out. They produce alot of noise, so if you miss them because they're deep in some shrubbery, you're sure to hear them fairly quickly and thus avoid them. Or you'll see their glowing red eyes, and take a different route.

Hunger on the otherhand can catch you out if you're not careful. They've got a decent hunger system, which can keep you on your toes if you're not careful. But then again, after going through a village or two, you'll find yourself loaded with plenty of food (unless you arm yourself up).

Guns. You're not really meant to use them, being the way the game is set up - but you can anyway. They hit hard, and given enough bullets you can drop the whole evasive and stealth part of the game and go on a bit of a turkey shootout. They're pretty easy to kill, and if you use a bit of cover and run enough, you should have no issues at all.

[b]Graphics: 7/10[/b] -> Highly subjective, but I'd rate the graphics quite high - many others would probably rate them much lower, but you should be able to make your own mind up from the screenshots alone. I think they look rather pretty and give off a nice atmosphere, despite being potentially 'dated' or at the least, far from AAA graphics.

A big plus concerning the simplistic graphics is... Well, I'd put it down to the specs. It isn't intensive, and you can run it easily on old systems.

[b]Price: 7/10[/b] -> I believe I got it on sale, as mentioned earlier, so I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. This is largely due to the fact that I do not regret spending cash on it, nor do I feel cheated out of pocket. I've spent cash on AAA games and felt cheated or that I've wasted cash, such as CoD, but in the case of 'Sir, You Are Being Hunted', I don't.

But, then again the price is really down to how much money you have to spare. For me a few pounds was cheap, but for others you may find buying something else to be more value for money.

[b]UI: 8/10[/b] -> I'd actually rate the UI rather high. It is relatively unique and rather simplistic, and has a nice feel. That, and the inventory system is the sort I like too, on top of it (Diablo/Two Worlds Style - a limited number of squares within the window in which items can be placed, and some items use up more squares than others).

[b]World: 5/10[/b] -> Beyond looking pretty, I sometimes feel a lot of space is wasted in this game. You can find yourself wandering through plains and fields, and then the odd forest - actually, you will likely find yourself spending most of your time doing this and the wilderness doesn't really feel threatening, which is a downside for a game where you, the player, are being hunted.

Another minor issue would be that despite the worlds being random, they do often feel and look rather similar. A little more diversity in world generation would be wonderful, such as large hills, denser forests or bigger towns or villages.

---

I'd say the devs have done a good job on the game, but they can do plenty more to make it considerably more fun and interesting for the player. Heck, ramping up the difficulty a little bit by making the robots somewhat more dangerous would be nice. Say, they could even make it so the robots actively hunt and seek out the player. That'd be nice...

I'll probably dump more thoughts here some other time - hopefully this should be enough to give people an idea of what they're getting into.",1411002860,1418965296,True,0,0,0.483076542615890503,0,False,False,False,False,,,

So, by that standard, I wouldn't like Sir, You Are Being Hunted.

But I also like British humour, beautiful rendered countrysides, over-the-top premises that are just too cooky to pass up. And that's what you get! 

Purely based on the title, I picked it up in version 0,5 or something and the team has been steadily developing it into this wonderfully crafted, ridiculously twisted game. Although the emphasis is mostly on stealth and avoiding the plaid-wearing robots (yes, really), you could go all Die-Hard as well, the rural countryside is gorgeous, especially during the sunrises and sunsets. The solutions that are available are sometimes far-fetched, but will always bring a smile to your face and have you sometimes burst out in laughter.

And that's on top of the fluent gameplay.

In my opinion, it's pretty genre-bending experience. I'll just sum up what the plot is: You are an English gentlemen who has mysteriously teleported and anbandoned on an archipelago of 5 islands, which are inhabited by several different types of robots, who, like you, are English gentlemen. These robots range from Hot Air Ballon pilots to just normal humanoid robots with rifles and hounds. Their mission is to hunt you down and kill you, before you are able to acquire a certain amount of crystals, which in return transport you back to your home, where your butler awaits. 

I'll tell you first hand, that this game is TERRIFYING when you start playing it. When you see a Hot Air Balloon, you'll run for the forests to hide. When you see a group of hunters moving towards you from a distance, you WILL panic. Not only is this game scary in some ways, but it is also very depressing. Somehow the abandoned and destroyed setting and constant rain somehow brings it all down to a quite sad and almost nerve-wrecking experience. 

But nevertheless, all of that depression is replenished with the spirit of scavenging and hunting your hunters! Although this seemingly a stealth game, you have all the wits and will to fight back. Eventually, you may find an axe. Or a rifle. Or even a grenade, Which all can be found through this game's scavenging system. Food, gadgets, and gizmos can be found all across the 5 islands in houses, destroyed robots, and more. 

I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes a nice amount of stealth and a strong sence of fear. 
WARNING! You need a pretty beefy computer, as mine cannot handle some of the detailed textures, and often lags when looking at, say, a forest. But even if you don't have a good computer, still try getting it! It's really worth it!

It is a rather plesent blending of alot of little game ideas that seem to pay off.  

You play as a inferorior human, and some strange monolyth like marchine has exploded.  It is up to you to put it back together.   However while playing across some Britich Archapellago, you are being hunted by a colorful veriaty of robots who seem to find you fitting spot.

So while hunting down these chunks of machine you have to dodge, hide, scavange and possiably fight your way through the world, small strange towns hold places to scavange for supplys but also seem to be the favriote hangouts of robots aswell.  
You need to eat to stay strong, you need rags to bandage yourself up, you need all kinda noise makers to distract robots, and if you lay your hands on a weapon you really need to wonder, is it safe to shot the robot, or is there another way.  Guns are very loud and raise alot of atteniton and are pretty much a last resort, for any situation.

The worlds are pleasent and procedurally generated from game to game, you do have some control over it.  There are methods of finding the chunks of the machine, however they take up an aweful lot of bag space, and the diffrent kind of robots range from not very dangerious, annoying, to making you paranoid as you lay face down in a puddle of your own terrified wee praying that they didn't see you.

Very unique setting and characterizations of NPC's are well done. The game only excels and is carried purely from the strength  of the originality it inspires to achieve, sadly, the actual gameplay detracts so much out of it that the originality is all that remains. 

A simple premise of collecting fragments of a crystal from different islands filled with pompus, steam-punk policemen wraps this game up in a nut shell. The gameplay mechanics are extremely primitive and under-developed, and in most cases- broken. 

It doesn't take long for the novelty to wear thin with this one. Not worth buying in it's current state.

Bots, while their dialogue amused me, and their aggression towards you is something to consider, aren't as amazing as the blurb suggests either. I scrapped one with an axe and it bunny-hopped backwards away from me, continuously, until I finally managed to end him with another swing. I don't get why they try to escape you like that when they could very easily put you down. 

The terrain is vast and mostly uninteresting. At one point I roamed so much of an island undisturbed I actually thought a glitch had ejected all bots from the map. This game would be cool if you were actually being constantly hounded by hunting parties that are out looking for you, so the stakes would be that much higher.

Firstly, the entire setting is wonderful. An archipelago of islands filled with deserted towns and houses, being watched over by Tweed-Donning robots with a taste for tea and murder. Exploring the islands is great fun, as you must always be on the lookout for roaming hunters and their dogs, hot air balloons lighting up your position or the Landowner, a fearsome robot with a cane that is well accustomed to crushing various bones and organs. Some variation in setting between islands whilst keeping the same British-Grey colour palette allows each area to be individual but memorable. The Castle biome has many ruined walls and turrets of old fortifications, while the Industrial Biome has larger towns with great chimneys and drilling platforms. Finding landmarks in the terrain that are often guarded by the posh automatons makes exploring no walk in the park, and adds to the tension and sense of adventure this game can create.

The enemies are very well designed, with types varying from the standard Winchester-wielding Hunters to the turbo-charged  robo-horses that are ridden by jockeys determined to run you over. The big cheese of all the robots is the Landowner who, as mentioned before, is a formidable opponent that must be avoided or outwitted in order to survive his metallic glare. Enemy variation doesn't stop there, and the combinations these types of robots can be found in can make taking certain Pieces a challenge.

The Main Object of the game is to retrieve each Piece of the ""Device"" that was destroyed in the ""Experiment"" (some backstory here wouldn't go amiss) and return them to the standing stones on the centre island. Each piece is guarded by at least two or more robots and can vary in size from tiny pieces that barely take up any room to giant parts of the device that need prior planning and inventory space to take back to the standing stones. Once all of the pieces have been collected the game ends. As time passes and pieces are returned, more robots appear, in greater numbers and variety, making each piece harder and harder to collect.

The Inventory system is tile based, so that certain items take up more room than others. A Flask of Luke Warm Tea only takes up 2 tiles but the Largest Piece of the Device takes up 16 tiles all together. Looting houses, fallen enemies and occasionally bins and phoneboxes mean that your inventory will stack up with all kinds of good loot, making you consider whether you want those extra shotgun shells or that canned pie that might be needed later.

All in All, I enjoy this game immensely and hope that Big Robot continue to add fresh content to this already wonderful concoction of a game.

So, ""Sir, You Are Being Hunted"" is a relatively neat concept of a game that you a in fact being hunted, with a twist of some British humour. I like the concept of being hunted, but the execution is rather disappointed. 

I expected the rush of being the target of a manhunt, but got a scavenger hunt with a heavy emphasis on inventory management. Like, the main goal of the game is to find some ""mysterious objects"" which tend to differ in size like some can be relatively small and other, very big. So how can this be a problem? Well, you gotta manage your inventory all the time since it is not intuitive. You have to scavenge for food all the time since your vitality keeps going down and well, you gotta keep some space for guns and ammo. However, from the guns I tried, they were weak and the robots took a few shots before being brought down... and more than half the times, their scavangeable goods are trashed. So, guns are weak and ammo are more than scarce. So you're better of just avoid the robots huh? NOPE! They'll find you anyways since in each strategic places you have to go, there's not only one but a few robots patrolling. And talking about places, you keep trying to figure out WHERE THE FRAK YOU HAVE TO GO, since the map isn't working... or maybe I haven't found it on the character I've picked? Bah whatever!

The game do look nice and the procedural generated world is well made, but are often repetitive and mostly empty. Playing around with your grid-based inventory can be time consuming enough to break immersion. Having limited inventory for a game like this is great, but having to reorganize a grid-based inventory to pick up an item when enough space is available is annoying (so you're hunted and you gotta play Tetris at same time!). Also, you can't enter buildings since they act like chests.

So overall, sneak around robots, scavenge for goods and ammo, manage your inventory ""Tetris style"" while being Hunted, look around and find the plot items ""mysterious objects"" FIFTEEN TIMES without knowing where they are. Fun? NOPE! 


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Procedural world setting is decent.
+Atmosphere and setting of being hunted get's creepy.
+Audio atmosphere is gloomy.[/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-Poor inventory management.
-Game world looks pretty much the same everywhere.
-No maps to help your navigation around (maybe you do get one from another character build?).
-Way too scarce ammo.
-Fetch quest is the main goal of this game... finding those mysterious objects FIFTEEN times gets tedious for nothing.
-Story is simply not interesting.[/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. Unfortunately, Sir, You Are Being Hunted fails to either impress me and make me feel like I am being hunted and breaks immersion too often to maintain my interest.  Basically, ""Sir, You Are Being Hunted"" is not good enough to justify spending X amount of hours just to finish the game. I haven't finished this game nor I am willing to spend more time on this below-average game when I got lots of better titles around.[/b]",1408305999,1676065872,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The first thing you'll notice in this game is the complete lack of challenge. The bots are completely easy to avoid, and hunger isn't really ever a struggle or challenge for the player because you can find food everywhere in the towns. The only part of the game that comes close to difficult is when the air-balloons fly around and spot you with their spotlight.

Second, there's absolutely nothing to do in this game. Every game has some sort of direction it wants players to go in. Even DayZ has the loosely defined goal of 'getting tons of cool stuff, making a helicopter, and killing other players'. But in [i]Sir, You Are Being Hunted[/i], there is nothing that the player needs to accomplish. The developers /knew/ this would be a problem in an open-world, single-player game like this, but do you know how they tried to fix it? They added a goal where players need to follow these little shiny 'wisp' looking things to crystal shards so that they can go to another island. 

As a player, I'm left thinking, 'why do I want to even do that'? What's my motivation to collect the shards? The next island is gonna look pretty much the same, and it isn't going to be any harder to clear than the last. The game itself is a chore. A chore I paid like $15 for, and not even a fun one like pulling lint out of an AC filter. 

Don't buy this game. I bought it a year ago expecting the money to help the developers work even faster on the game and make a great final product, but now the game is pretty much the same as it was when I bought it.

Oh, and one final note. The voice-work in this game is pathetic. It's some guy with a painfully-fake British accent talking into a headphone microphone. You can even hear it 'pop' when he says 'p' syllables because they didn't even have a professional microphone with a pop guard.

Your first and only objective is to find pieces of the mysterious machine that can take you home if fixed. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôll be doing for the rest of the game. 

[i]Stealth[/i]
So, you approach a piece and see that it‚Äôs guarded by a couple of robots with guns. You can throw an empty bottle or a rock to the side, the robots will leave to investigate the noise, you safely grab the piece and leg it. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they see you: they can‚Äôt run nearly as fast as you or shoot straight. Even if they hit you, it still doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîyour health regenerates over time and their guns don‚Äôt do much damage from a distance. The old bottle trick will help you get the first fragments, but, the thing is, it‚Äôll work just as perfectly for the very last fragment on the last island. There are other tools you can use to distract or fight the enemy, but why bother if bottle throwing works every time? At later stages of the game some tougher enemies will appear. They never seem to approach the fragment sites. You have no reason to disturb or confront them, so I‚Äôm not sure how tough most of them really are.

[i]Survival[/i]
You need food to regenerate health, but it is abundant. I only ran out once, and that was at the very end of the game when I already had all the fragments. Sure, it‚Äôs neat that you can hunt and cook the game you‚Äôve just shot, but you can easily get by with whatever you find laying around.

[i]Story[/i]
The intro is intriguing. How did you get there? Who built the device and what does it really do? What was the experiment all about? How did it go wrong? Who‚Äôs the man helping you? Why do the robots hunt you, and why do they seem to control the area? Where did all the humans go? What‚Äôs with the will-o‚Äô-the-wisp things and what do they have to do with the device? Sadly, I didn‚Äôt get closer to finding answers to any of these questions when I got to the end. Even the ending cutscene just shows the machine starting and then cuts to credits.

All in all, I guess it was interesting enough for one playthrough (took me roughly 4.5 hours), but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be getting back to it unless there‚Äôs a patch that makes survival harder or expands the story greatly.

You have to get machine pieces and bring them back to where you start to repair a teleporter as your butler, Mr Walters, talks to you. As you get more pieces, more and new, tougher robots come. You have a hunger meter, so you have to scavenge for food in the houses that lay around. At first, your only tools of dealing with the robots are bottles that you can throw to distract them (they don't hurt them) and alarm clocks that you can set to go off - up to 60 seconds of delay. Although, you might find some weapons that will be of use - the hatchet, the pistol, the shotgun, the rifle and even a blunderbuss! All the time, you will have to deal with a Tetris-like inventory.

- The amount of walking you do gets boring, fast
- Very, very poor save system which harshly punishes simple mistakes
- Very limited selection of traps and weapons
- Increasing numbers of enemies as you progress seems to be the only way that difficulty is managed, which doesn't really add anything; You'll be dealing with enemies the same way, only there is more risk, which is bad (considering the save system)
- All the different island types feel the same, with few distinguishable features
- Best approach to enemies is to either avoid completely, or shoot to kill quickly, which seems like the opposite of what the devs were hoping for, so I count it as a negative that they ended up not encouraging traps
- Poor replay value

En fait, le jeu emm√®ne le joueur sur une grande √Æle sur laquelle il y a d'autres √Æles accessibles par les bords du centre, on peut choisir sa classe au d√©but (par exemple le ""Policier"" qui commence avec un revolver) et ensuite la loi du plus fort prend le dessus : Les robots qui sont en groupe sont difficiles √† battre au d√©but, mais c'est souvent gratifiant car leurs armes les tuent en un coup (le revolver les tuent en 3 balles, ce qui est r√©aliste). Le protagoniste (vous) se r√©veille pr√®s d'une sorte de Stonehenge qu'il faut charger de cristaux pour retourner chez soi, ils sont souvent dans les feux de camp (Un conseil : Cuisez votre viande crue si vous en avez avant de prendre le cristal car apr√®s le feu s'√©teint (ce qui attire les robots)).

Au niveau de la survie, il y en aussi : 
 - Il y a une barre de faim, qui ne peut pas √™tre recharg√©e en mangeant des assiettes ou des cr√¢nes. (on peut)
 - Si vous vous couper vous saignez et il faudras un bandage sans quoi vous mourrez.
Ainsi que de la furtivit√© : Vous pouvez approcher les robots en discr√©tion dans les hautes herbes par exemple et leur tirer dessus (ils sont g√©n√©ralement 3 - 4) ou les couper si vous trouvez une hache. Par contre personne n'est sans savoir qu'un coup de feu fait du bruit, mais vous pouvez prendre les bouteilles et les lancer, ce qui fera aller voir les robots ailleurs.
L'inventaire quand √† lui fonctionne par cases, une assiette prendras 4 cases par exemple et une bouteille 2. Donc si vous avez jou√© √† Dr. Mario ou Fragile Dreams (jeux pas connus, Fragile Dreams est un tr√®s bon jeu d'horreur sur Wii) vous ne devriez pas avoir de probl√®mes avec √ßa.

Aside from the slight British humor that saturates the game, I found the robots themselves to be a bit comical (In a murderous, creepy, sort of way). It's an easy game to get into, but I must admit it had me checking the Wiki every so often, especially when a little creepy voice kept whispering ""Behind you!"". 

As a fleet of enemies, these robots can be both heart-stopping and childish. One loan hunter is no problem at all if you have a rifle or a man trap, but 5 hunters in a party with dogs becomes a force to avoid. Thankfully I never had the misfortune of alerting the landowner, but his thunderous steps were intimidating from the distance I kept between us. Each class of robot has their own strengths and weaknesses, but virtually all of them can be lost by just running in a straight line and ducking behind some cover. So long as your visibility is low they will almost never find you. I found it very interesting that the robots will eventually attack each other. I noticed that groups of hunters will often attack each other, riders, squires, and scarecrows. Although a little confusing, it sometiems works to your advantage when a group of 5 hunters shoot themselves down to 1 and have taken out 2 riders and a trapper.

The narrator is a gem, but a little more could be done with him. His ability to talk to you is never explained nor his in-depth knowledge of the alternate universe you've been accidentally flung into. Nonetheless, more of him would have only added to the charm of the game. I was a little dissapointed by the backstory and ending; they could have been a lot more indepth and provide an atmosphere that better explains and better allows for this alternate universe. There are books spread across the islands with little tidbits of story, but I found those few and far inbetween.

Starting from the easy setting, it took me about 7 hours to make it through the game. After finding all the parts on the center island I would collect all 3 items on each adjacent island and run them back to the center. Each island was a different landscape with a different theme, but as I collected more pieces there were more robots. 

All in all this was a cute game that I enjoyed playing, well worth the $5 I paid for it when it went on sale. It has some decent replayability to test out harder settings, but i look forward to any future updattes the game might see. Since the story and ending will be the same every time, it may be a while before I choose to play again.

Exploitables (Possible Cons):
-Saving the game does not save the robots. Saving at either the center rock or a boat and then immediately loading the last save point will erase all the robots and reset their spawn allowing the player to make a mad dash to find the next piece. 
-If a machine piece is surrounded by enemies, just find a cozy spot with 0 visibility and wait for another group of hunter to come through and shoot up the place. Normally they do a good job defeating the other classes (squires and riders hardly fight back at all) and leaves the player to take out the 1 or 2 survivors who are at lowered health.
-Hiding is too easy. A patch of grass can hide you completely and have a squad of hunters walk directly in front of you without ever being alerted. The only exception is the rider who will see you from his vantage point attop his robot horse and run you over repeatedly until you sprint away. You think the fastest robot in the game would be able to chase you, but they don't. At least not very far.
-Robots need an invitation to shoot you. When a robot spots you it will make a little beep and take aim. Hide or croutch, lowering your visibility, and it forgets it ever saw you. You can juggle a hunter by doing this, letting him see you, hide, let him see you, hide, and so on. This works especially well to pick off the last person in a line of hunters by having the others continue on while your target can't decide what to do.",1405546647,1405546647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The good reviews show the good sides of the game while the bad reviews show the bad sides of the game. Most importantly, many of them are incredibly truthful, althought this game gave me a fun challenge for a few hours, I'm going to have to give it a negative rating.

Lets start off with the good things about this game!
First of all, the game runs and looks as it was advertised, with all the features the store says it features, but do not expect anything more from this game.

First-person stealth and survival.     Check.
Procedurally-generated British landscape.        Check.
Five biomes to explore: castle, industrial, rural, mountainous, and fenland.            Check.
Powerful, brutal AI that becomes tougher as you play.          Check.
Tea and biscuits.             Check.
Foliage-based stealth system.            Check.
Scavenge to survive.          Check.
Play as Sir or Madam.          Check.
Relentless Britishness.         Check.

HOWEVER.....

Infinite replayability in a sandbox world. 

Now this is where my review gets a little bit on the negative side. The game is infinitely replayable, IF you like playing the exact same game, but a slightly different generated world. Sure the landscape will not be the same, but everything seems the get more and more repetative the more you play the game. Villages become bland and overdone and you see them quite often without much variation besides the occasional big village or small village. Of course the AI acting differently must add some kind of extra replayability right!!??? No. Yes, they have different hunting patterns, but if you play long enough, they dont just become easier to predict the more you watch them, but they become easier to avoid. As said, ""The AI becomes harder as you play,"" is a pretty acurate statement by the devs, except the the fact they don't really get harder, there are just more of the tweed jacket wearing hunters. Max I give the game a few hours of playability before it gets bland and overdone, maximum would be maybe 48 hours of gameplay.

THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT MAKES ME HORRIBLY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS GAME was that it was released with low resolution textures. I mean the textures were REALLY low resolution. They look like alpha placeholder textures that devs put in before-hand to make sure everything runs and looks as it should. The textures have not gotten any updates to clean them up or make them neater and prettier, the game looks nice and all, but everything looks as though it was painted by a four year old with water color paints. ALSO, with all these horrible textures, the game runs like absolute shit! Although it does not run as bad as another MAJORLY disappointing game, Starforge, it runs worse than Skyrim, which is saying something because Skyrim is a pretty intensive game to run even with it's high resolution textures. Sure they might try to pass it off as the games artstyle, but at least try to make that excuse convincing and make some good artistic textures.

All in all, Sir, You are Being Hunted is a fantastic game, besides its extremely limited playability and horrible textures. If I had the choice to either by this game or not, having played it, I would choose not to pay $20 for a game that looks and runs badly, that can only be played once or twice.

This game has a bucket load of atmosphere, the sound and music particularly are superb and the recent addition of 5.1 surround is tactically important.  Combat is short and brutal.  I still jump when the bots fire their first volley at me.  It's a superb sound.  Not booming hollywood gunshots, more the snap of a 18th century musket.  And being shot in SYABH is a genuinely unpleasent thing to happen.  It absolutly cains your health and unless you find cover quick you will not last long; the screen shakes and rocks, things start to go grey when health is low and your heart becomes audible.  All standard gaming tropes but effective nonetheless.
I found that the stealth is satisfying.  It isn't hardcore stealth.  It's easy to figure out and get right, but it feels fair and believable and it requires a fair amount of patience and observation.  I think the most important thing about this game is that, like Mario, the game never feels broken.  You never get spotted, or killed and think ""screw this, that shouldn't have happened, this games broken"".  It's ALWAYS your fault.  Or you got unlucky.  Either way it feels fair, and in this kind of game (indeed any game but particularly this kind), that is important.  The hunger/health mechanic works well, and I like the plethora of objects to loot.  There is a loose backstory, however I have yet to find all the letters and books scattered about.
For me, the most important thing about this game is the setting, theming and atmosphere.  In this regards, this game is an absolute winner.  The gameplay might not be for everyone, but I thoroughly enjoy being hunted by those loveable, ruthless robots.  It's only going to get better once mod support and co-op is introduced (if this happens, and I have heard that it might).  So put the kettle on, grab a packet of Hob Nobs, slip into your smoking jacket and get ready for the most British sneaking experience you are likely to enjoy this year.",1405355546,1405355546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

AT FIRST. However, things will go downhill after sometime. Buy this game on a low price and ONLY if you want some short fun.

This game is a survival stealth game, where you have been thrown into a world (This world can be edited somehow before the game) where you need to collect different parts of a machine to get back. There are enemies though and you are given the choice to either avoid them or take them down: Silently or loudly. In the mean time, you have to take care of yourself and scavange for food and shelter.

This game looks interesting at first as the enemies range from infantry to riders. Some are rather fearful so much so that you would rather avoid it than fight them.

However, that is just about it.

Because everything is repetitive afterwards, making the game very boring towards the end as you continue to scavange, hunt, kill and collect pieces. That is what is going to happen after that. Even with the other classes, you will not want to go back and play this game after once.

It turned out to be better than I expected!  The atmosphere is fantastic and it really does feel like Britain especially on a dark drizzly night, crouching in the woods with the moon shining down above you.

While it's definitely not Amnesia (and doesn't try to be), the robots can be genuinely scary, especially when you hear the slow thud of the Landowner bearing down on you.  Which brings me to maybe the best bit about this game - the sound.  It really evokes a dark, 'tweedpunk' future filled with menace.  The first you'll know of the robots is when you suddenly hear their whirring and clanking from behind a hill.  They also come out with some humorous phrases (""I blame the foreigners"").

The AI seems pretty good, and the robots will sometimes erupt into firefights amongst themselves, giving you even more ways to outwit them.

This is a game you need to use your mind for as the sandbox environment (and 'British Countryside Generator') provide a pretty much infinite number of situations you can find yourself in.  If you like sandbox games and sneaking games, this is definitely for you.

While this game is very nicely designed from an artistic point of view, the textures can look very plain close up.  I was surprised to learn that the engine used in this game is the same as the one used in The Forest.  However, this really does not detract from gameplay at all, and I especially love the effect of the sun's rays shining through woodland at sunrise and sunset.  It also means that the game is well optimised for slower systems.

Downsides?  If you want a comprehensive survival experience this isn't it.  You can hunt for food and cook it and so forth, but it's not worth it.  You can keep your 'Vitality' topped up by munching on blackberries and drinking tea every now and then and that's really all there is to it.  There's no system of shelter, sleeping or crafting so it's nothing like as deep as other 'survival' games out there such as Rust and The Forest.  It's a 'shallow' survival game, which to be honest is all it professes to be.

Approach this game with an open mind as there is really nothing else like it out there.  It is still being patched currently and I think multiplayer support is still to be added.  It's certainly well worth the asking price and I look forward to seeing what Big Robot can make next.

Reading some of the comments on this game, I did not expect too much of it. I picked it up on sale for $5 and glad I did.

Pros:

-Large environment to explore.
-Great use of night and day lighting (easier to hide at night than at day)
-Real sense of fear to get caught or seen by one of the robot, making you play stealthy as much as possible and the fact shooting guns makes a ruckus that will always attract more of them to your location encourages you to play that way most of the time. Still, dispatching robots with guns is so satisfying...remember to run away after as other robots in the vicinity will survey the noise you caused.

Cons:

-Buildings can be looted, but you can't enter them. Would've been nice to actually enter a house and loot or hide from the robots.
-Sometimes, the sheer number of robots patrolling an area is makes hiding almost impossible...and the tendency for them to sometimes move towards you even though they should not know your location is kind of suspicious to say the least.
-There is no implementation of stealthy dispatching of the robots (like moving behind them and pressing a quick-action key).
-You have to go back to the stone to unload the repair parts, and limited inventory makes travelling back from Islands to the main one a chore. Also, there should be a few scattered save spots on each island.

It's not worth it.

But not for the reasons one may think! The game is a very simple game, with procedurally generated maps and loot 'chests' (the doors of buildings are basically all loot stashes, and you just loot them instead of going into the building), and some good AI for the robots that are always trying to kill you.

On the one hand, I often found myself bored as I trudged through empty fields, seeing nothing and becoming lost all the time.

On the other hand, when I was finally able to defend myself, figuring out ways to combat the often overwhelming bot force became very fun and action packed. So much so that when I was inevitably killed, I felt like playing again (after a bit of a cool down, thanks to my temper lol).

Normally, I'd say this easily merits the $5 tag I picked it up for... but for one word: Glitches.

Did these developers test their damn game before releasing it?! I have CONSTANTLY been running into three specific glitches that make the game unplayable.

Glitch 1: My inventory mysteriously vanishes- yet I cannot place items into it, or remove items from it (or try to use any of the few items that do show up).

Glitch 2: The boats in between islands mysteriously dissapear, thus stranding me on the island I am currently on.

Glitch 3: My most hated of all glitches- randomly (though it likes to do it more when I get shot), the entire game will vanish, leaving behind nothing but a colored blur that you can tell is the layer behind the clouds above. I still have access to my hud, and can even open my inventory (but not use items), but everything else is gone. no buildings, no weapon in hand, no clouds, and no ground. It's just blank. I can hear when i use my weapon, and even still take bleed damage (but cannot be shot or hurt otherwise), but anything else (including enemies) just dissapear, and never come back.

After the 5th or 6th time of this occurence, I have decided to give up on this game. Please try harder next time, devs.",1405227253,1405227332,False,7,1,0.530955672264099121,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Having already acquired half of the Stones, (of which are 18 BTW,) I think I should be able to write a decent review on this title.  Let me start by saying this:

Unique.  Yup.  I've played a lot of games, and nothing is quite like this one.  YOU are being the one hunted, and boy are you ever; those robots are EVERYWHERE.

The robots, being CPUs, have really good AI.  They aren't just idiots who, when seeing you run behind a corner, completely forget about you and walk off.  No.  They will search wherever you were last, and then some.  An interesting mechanic is that you can use trains, rocks, clocks, and glasses to distract said robots.  Using this technique, you can even trap them.

At first, getting a gun can be hard work.  Then you have bullets... Sometimes, there will be a small village with around six mags of bullets, each of which includes 6 bullets.  And then other times, you won't be able to find any bullets for an hour or more.  So don't expect this to be a war zone with guns blazing... well, not YOUR guns blazing, anyway.  

After that, you have to remember to watch your ""Vitality"" bar, or hunger bar.  This does not deplete fast, but the more it's filled, the faster you regain health.


So, overall, what do I think of this game?
Very unique, with a pleasant art style and decent game mechanics.  Robot AI is quite smart, and there is a wide array of different kinds of robots.  Being a survival game, there are lots of survival mechanics and good stealth mechanics as well.  I HIGHLY recammend this, though for the $20 price, It's steep, but with a replay value, worth it.",1405198234,1405198234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Do you like robots? Do you like -punk universes? If at least 2/3 of your answers are yes, you should get this game! I've been playing it since it was early access and feel like the devs have managed to balance every item and robot type very well, and you can tweak stuff in the options to suit your tastes.

Some initial reviews say that you don't really feel as hunted as the name suggests, and at the time that was true. The robots spent much of their time with the teleporter fragments you're gathering, largely allowing you to set the terms of the confrontation. In the full release, however, the devs have upped the number of robot patrols and depending on how your island generated, you really can't get too far without having to duck in the grass, the bushes, the woods or behind a structure. There's gentleman robots looking for you all around. There's trappers in the woods / bushes. There's bots ready to stalk you on the fields. Every environment (but not every island type) has its own special hunters, and some hunters look for you all around. Lucky for you, some of the bots don't get along and will fight when they encounter each other, allowing you a chance to escape or get some loot when things die down. There will usually be some at the fragments too, since the bots know you will be coming to get them sooner or later.

With the variety of enemy types and starting equipment, beautiful environments that are randomly regenerated each time you start a new game, different options to customize your game (even removing all the enemies if you just like to walk around) Sir is an excellent choice for the stealth enthusiast. The graphics aren't to everyone's tastes, and the open world environment with its own stealth mechanics might rub some of the fans of the genre the wrong way. Personally, I adore the look and the mechanics, but these are the gripes others have repeatedly expressed and which seem to be dragging the metascore down.

Good base plan: survive in open world where your only real goal is to escape.  I've always wanted to resident evil game like that, where you randomly find lickers and tyrants in the city and can run or fight.  Back to topic...  Good plan, lazy execution.

First, you can't go inside of buildings.  Just one question... Why?  In an area full of evil robots (or any enemies searching for you) crouching in the 2nd story window of a house and shooting down or throwing a bomb would feel great!  I understand this game is about being sneaky and hiding if you can, but that's even more reason to be able to go in building.  The general world doesn't have too great of hiding spots.  You need buildings to hide in and jump to and from just to get around anywhere that has more than one robot.

Second, any robot with a gun deals so much you are lucky to survive and patch yourself from the first shot.  Then, even if you do survive, you can't (to my knowledge) put bandages on your hotkey bar.  So, you can't instant patch yourself, meaning you have to pause and do it while they are still chasing you or else you will bleed out in about 10 seconds.  God forbid you get hit in a field or an area with nowhere great to hide, because you will get shot and killed while trying to bandage yourself.

Next, minor complaint: I do wish it was true open world.  I mean that the islands were all loaded with a render distance enabled.  Having to teleport from boat dock to boat dock is a little lame feeling.  I want the moment of running from robots, hopping on a boat and sailing out while ducking in to the boat and barely escaping in to the sea.  Then having the excitement of finding a new island and trying to find a safe place to dock.

I'm pretty good about going on for a really long time when reviewing games, so I'll cut it here, but I just have to say: Good start.  Great idea with the possible escape to try and give the open world genre some feeling of meaning, unlike games like minecraft which, while very fun with friends, can get dull fast when you realize all you are looking forward to is fighting a very laggy dragon that clips through blocks, to get an egg that does nothing.  But if this game wants to be remembered it needs to open it's doors (literally) and brouden it's scopes.  Also, not sure if this is a thing, but it would be cool if you could use hotair balloons you shoot down.  Patch them, etc.  Then be able to fly anywhere with them (again requiring a true open world).

I've now done two full playthroughs on Aristocrat difficulty. 

At first I was surprised by how divided some people were about ""Sir..."", and in retrospect I can sort-of see why. The lack of building interiors, simplistic stealth mechanics, small weapon roster and lack of world building outside of the basic premise could all be seen as negatives.  

That said, I think the last of these points is the only one I found actually a bit disappointing. The scattered letters and books found in the houses/giant-loot-crates were amusing and interesting to find, but it felt like it needed a bit more. Also, although I like the procedural generation for replay value, there was some noticeable jank in the form of buildings spawning in the sea, the Land Owner ""boss"" getting stuck in trees etc. Though these were mostly just a bit funny rather than actually impeding progress. 

Anyway, I maintain that the gameplay loop is still a fun mixture of stealth and a bit of guerilla warfare. Fighting back is often dangerous and cumbersome, but makes it more satisfying when you pick the right moment and come out on top, telebit in hand. I also liked the fact that not all the robots are out to get you, and that they can sometimes turn on each other; made it all feel more ""alive"". The multi-tonal beep-booping of your pursuers sometimes plays tricks on you, I found myself imagining I could hear them when there were none nearby and even started hearing them in the real world! 

If there was one big thing I wish they'd added it would probably be more opportunities to save the game than just the standing stones and boats. Perhaps at the bonfires used to cook things (a la Dark Souls)? Sometimes you'll expend a lot of time, energy and items trying to get just one or two telebits (especially late in the game - one time I had the Land Owner, a rider, scarecrow and about four hunters all around one telebit!), and running all the way from one side of the island to the other to make sure you don't lose all that progress can be taxing. Since updates are finished, I'll leave that as a warning for new players! 

The atmosphere generated by the Tim Burton-esque scenery and spooky lighting give its mechanical ""tweedpunk"" inhabitants an extra dose of menace, and their quips about the weather, how obscenely wealthy they are, how great Britain is etc. add humour and even a dash of political commentary (indeed, you could say the whole thing is an analogy of something like fox hunting - we don't see any foxes running about, but the player fits the role!). Overall I think the game looks great, and the music is non-intrusive and oddly soothing at times.  

I do think the very specific cultural referencing makes ""Sir..."" rather niche, and may have had an impact on its reception as those who didn't relate to that side of it were less won over by the gameplay mechanics. This is a game where its strong presentation is what sets it apart from the deluge of stealth-survival titles we've seen in recent years.

It's quirky name and decidedly tongue-in-cheek ""maximum Britishness"" approach made me think it was going to be too much gimmick and not enough game.  I am happy to say that was not the case.  [i]SYABH[/i] (what an acronym) is a solid game that perfectly captures the appeal of the stealth FPS genre, but with its own unique ambiance and the added boon of high replayability thanks to random map generation.

To be more specific about the gameplay, [i]SYABH[/i] seems to combine a lot of elements from other stealth (or stealth-optional) shooters into one attractive result.  Combat plays out a bit like [i]Deus Ex[/i], of all things: crouching is the key to being unobserved, enemies won't detect you if you're not in line of sight, and sometimes the best choice in combat is to simply leg it.  Inventory management is also a bit like [i]Deus Ex[/i], certainly with the grid-based ""you have X slots"" system, but the use and variety of items is more reminescent of [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i], especially with the game's focus on looting and storage.  [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i] also comes to mind with the game's health and vitality (read: food) system, along with the possibility of bleeding from injuries and the necessity to stop said bleeding with bandages.

As for the ambiance, it's very tongue-in-cheek humorous while also retaining that real sense of danger and, dare I say it, horror at times.  Some enemies can and do strike fear into your heart if you see them under the wrong circumstances, which in this game is more often than not.  Above all though this game is very, very British.  The robots look British, say British things, and act British.  I once caught a hunting party stopping mid-field to have tea before continuing on.  It's the little touches that make this game charming, some of which I'm sure I'm missing because I'm not British myself.

Difficulty wise, I've found this game pretty decent.  Early on the game is easy for anyone experienced with stealth combat, particularly for [i]Deus Ex[/i] players.  The basic robot variant is fairly easy to take on in combat if you're sneaky, and will even reliably miss you at close range so long as you're circle-strafing.  Once more variants start showing up though, or even simply start appearing in more numbers, things definitely get more challenging.  Certain combinations and/or numbers of enemies are definite ""run away only"" situations no matter how much firepower you've managed to scavenge, and just sprinting across the landscape in the hopes that you won't get shot too much simply won't work anymore.  You have to think, observe, and plan in order to make it to the end of the game, picking your battles where you can.  It's a reasonable difficulty ramp, and one you can tackle more or less at your own pace, since it seems to be tied to how much of the game's central fetch quest you've completed.

Overall, [i]Sir, You Are Being Hunted[/i] is an enjoyable game that manages to amuse in one second and induce very real tension and even a touch of fear in the next.  Anyone who likes the sort of stealthy resource-reliant looting-with-optional-combat type gameplay seen in [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i], [i]Deus Ex[/i], and countless other titles will find that same part of their game brain satified by this, and the randomized and adjustable nature of the game makes it highly replayable.

Now the random maps... They are more like small random island. Five in total with boats that ""load"" the closest one when used. Terrain is mostly flat and uninteresting. Some wild animals and cool sunsets add to the otherwise boredom of the landscape. Was expecting more: hills, cave, large town, resource gathering...

The game requires you to find different magical stones for The Device, which I assume takes you away from this godforsaken place. Or it explodes and alerts every robot on the island to turn you into swiss cheese. EIther way, I haven't found out yet.

Another great part of the game is the survival aspect. You must always have food to survive. I don't mean a Dead Rat or some gross spuds either. I mean you must always have GOOD food, or in the game's case a lot of whiskey, otherwise you're living on a timer until your Vitality and Health runs out, killing you.

One the the best things is the stealth required in the game. You can't run up to a group of robots later on in the game, otherwise you're asking to get loaded with buckshot. You must sneak up to them, distract them, or my favorite, use a ManTrap on them, which is simply a beartrap reinvented to hunt you. Also, pay attention to your visibility. Robots can spot you from just looking at you so it's best to crouch when they're near and to get a rock or some other cover between you and your hunters.

Overall, this game is great and has a lot of replayabilty considering you can tweak the world generation and the amount of robots. I also think this game would be great if they had more survival features and it was a challenge to survive without the robots.

The story in this game is left up to the player to figure out, for the most part. Hidden messages in the randomly generated maps will help you to piece it together if you play enough. But the story isn't the most important part of this game.

This game, because levels are randomly generated, can be either extremely hard or very easy. But for the most part the game has a fairly good difficulty, with enemies becoming increasingly difficult to handle as you spend more time playing. This game is advertised as being a stealth game, but you can choose yourself wether to go down that route or just jump in guns a blazing. Both tactics work well. Some players argue that this should not be the case, but it didn't bother me while playing.

This game can be played with a controller, but I would reccomend sticking with a standard keyboard/mouse setup because it makes inventory management much easier.

The graphics in this game are not to most amazing. They're not bad as such, but they could be made more detailed, especially the ""ground"" textures. However, the world generator does a good job of capturing what you could call the stereotypical ""brittish village"" look (amongst other types of land), and when seen from afar, it does look very nice.

The sound in this game is good, the ambiance and such sounds do a good job of immersing you, and it can be very jarring (in a good way) to suddenly hear a robot coming up behind you.

Because things are randomly generated, don't worry about just restarting if you happen to come across a world that places you smack in the middle of an impossible area. The chances of that happening are very low. And if you are finding things too hard or too easy, you can use the newly updated ""custom world generators"" to swizzle the difficulty.

This is a really fun open-world stealth game, and definitely worth a shot if you like survival horror games.

You should consider purchasing this fine entertainment product. I have taken the liberty of personally previewing it myself and can reveal to you its delightful secrets. Simulating an unlikely otherworldly situation, you will be hunted by robots through a series of 5 different and randomly-generated islands designed by the developers to resemble the fine British countryside. The verisimilitude of the setting is quite striking and you will surely marvel at the beauty of the thing while shotgun wielding tin cans try to blast your head off!

There are a variety of things to find in aid of escaping the archipelago including weapons, distractions and the necessary nourishment to see you through the ordeal. You can deal with your hunters in different ways, and must consider stealth and deception a primary means of remaining alive.

There are limitations, of course, and there is perhaps a limit to how many times you might wish to revisit this joyful simulation. There is a chance to define how the islands are randomly generated in the latest retrofitting of the code, but overall once you have figured out how to deal with the problems and accomplish your glorious escape (perhaps after a few lethal mishaps), there isn't much left to draw you back.

You've been stranded on a group of small islands, and tasked with finding the scattered pieces of a broken machine, which should help you escape. But the islands are home to strange robots who will attack you on sight.

There are 17 pieces to find, spread across 5 islands whose layouts are randomly generated. They can be identified by a trail of white smoke rising into the air, not high enough to see from behind a building or a hill, but obvious enough that you'll immediately notice if you're looking at it. I like that, instead of just slapping a waypoint marker on each location as some games would do, SYABH trusts the player to actually put some effort in. You might find a scanner that will beep if you're close, but I only had to use it to find the last piece. I found everything else quite easily within 6 hours of gameplay, just by conducting a methodical search.

Along the way you'll need to deal with the various types of robots. To begin with its just a normal human shaped robot with a shotgun, usually hunting in pairs. But over time, more dangerous types start to appear such as robot dogs or robot horse riders. You can decide whether to fight them or avoid them, but you can only save in specific places so you might want to be cautious.

I mostly used the open nature of the islands to keep my distance, only fighting the robots who were guarding the pieces. Guns are not fun to use, they feel slow and weak - probably by design, because the robots struggle with them as well. I had more success by first distracting them either by throwing a bottle or setting an alarm clock, then sneaking up behind and using a powerful axe. Stealth is a tricky thing to get right for me, but I enjoyed this system more than games like Thief or Assassins Creed.

Meanwhile you need to find food, because if your hunger meter reaches zero, your health will start to decrease. If you take damage during combat, your health will automatically regenerate, but only if your hunger meter is high. There is plenty of food available, but you might need to search villages, which are guarded by more robots. Searching buildings can also give various helpful items such as binoculars, matches for lighting a fire to cook raw meat, a map which helps navigation, and more.

Technically the game is solid. Graphics are what you would expect from an indie game, controls are fine on mouse and keyboard, and I didn't suffer any bugs. The most disappointing thing for me was the story. The end was very anticlimactic and failed to really explain anything at all.

Overall I enjoyed SYABH and I would recommend it, if you're looking to play something a bit different to the usual genres.",1402141525,1402141525,True,1,0,0.520182788372039795,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Newer updates have added the industrial and castle biomes, new enemies like the scarecrow and the lord of the manor and a class system, which is basicly a difficulty setting giving you different equipment at the start depending on what job you pick.

Many stealth games are somewhat of an illusion. Behind the rock throwing, sneaking and stealth assassinations there is essentially a puzzle game, designed to have a few specific solutions. This is where Sir, you are being Hunted differs, the procedural nature of the game gives you a number of situations without an obvious solution. A patrol of 4 guards doesn't necessarily have a blind spot, so completing the game without ever being seen becomes near impossible. This might frustrate some die-hard stealth fans for obvious reasons, but it feels different and somewhat realistic.

The premise is as so, you're stuck on an island with the task of retrieving 17 MacGuffins from 5 different islands. You must take the 17 items to the standing-stones in the center island to repair the ""device"". You really don't know anything else except you're being hunted by angry English robots.

The English robots match the theme of the environment; the fens, countryside, industrial areas, castles and forests that you stroll through will be familiar to anyone who lives in or has visited the UK. This may not sound exciting in words, but it really is, no other video-game has done anything in this setting. It's dank, dreary, usually raining and very atmospheric coupled with the ambient music. The industrial area in particular has a certain uniqueness about it, the landscape is littered with abandoned towns, villages, churches, factories and ruins. Something very awful happened in this place, and it's never clear exactly what that may have been. The robots speak a number of stereotypical English phrases even talking about their wives. It's as if the personality of the once residents of these islands has been transferred into each robot.

Unfortunately the awful low resolution textures and procedural generation take you out of the game every so often, certain placements don't make sense with roads leading nowhere, walls connected in strange ways and docks located in very small lakes. However this wasn't a large problem for me considering the world is supposed to be in a state of extreme entropy and you don't have much time to focus on the small details anyway. Why don't you have much time? When the game says you're being hunted it doesn't mean it lightly. With sprawling robots which are around every corner don't give you much rest-bite, you're constantly looking behind your back.

This is the one thing that Sir, You Are Being Hunted absolutely nails, the feeling of being on the run. You will relish moments of silence when you can't hear the sinister ""bleep-bloop"" of the tweed, pipe and top-hat geared robots. Another stand-out aspect is the enemy design. The basic robots can be seen from far away by their glowing red eyes, and even when they aren't in sight each enemy makes a distinct sound. This is clever because you can often get a good idea of how many robots you're facing without even seeing them. The AI is far from intelligent but I wouldn't call it stupid. Even when it does make the odd silly decision, you aren't taken out of the experience like many other stealth games because they're robots. Maybe that's a cheap excuse, but it works. As the game continues more creative enemies are added to the mix, some which create such weird and terrifying sounds you'll never want to go near them. Robots also have a tendency to shoot pheasants and rabbits for their own entertainment and at my scared confusion, wondering what they were shooting at. This creates an unexpected side-effect, making Sir, You Are Being Hunted quite a scary game at times. Avoiding the outlandish looking robots makes it all the more exciting and horrifying when you accidentally bump into them.

The gameplay consists of finding the 17 MacGuffins by following blue will-o'-the-wisps to each location. This works quite nicely as they don't give you a direct way to the MacGuffin, often taking you a longer way around. However I think there are too many will-o'-the-wisps on the islands at a time, reducing your compulsion to explore. Along the way you will find places to loot such as houses, barrels and sheds. To the dismay of many fans it was announced early in the game's development that you won't be able to go inside houses. While this makes sense for a number of technical and economic reasons, it's an obvious shame. Buildings would add a lot to the game in terms of hiding and exploration. Towns are still interesting though, providing a lot of loot and many places to hide. Each town also has a suitably randomized English name that will probably make you chuckle.

The loot consists of random useless objects (of which there are far too many), food, drink, tools, traps, weapons (both melee and ranged) and letters (which provide a bit of context). There is a vitality meter also which you have to keep topped up by consuming food and drink. If you let it drain to 0 your health will start to deplete, in addition to this the lower your vitality is the less quickly your health regenerates. This is never anything to worry about though, in my first playthrough it never went below 20. You can also cook pheasants, rabbits and raw meat on a fire with the disadvantage of the fire attracting robots. But this never becomes a necessity because there is simply enough food that you can eat uncooked.

I did find myself lacking in bandages a few times though. Some of my most tense experiences actually came from those moments when I had no bandages left. I was a sitting duck, getting seen was much more of a consequence, I couldn't risk getting shot, even once. Interestingly enough there is also quite a big chance that robots drop bandages. Giving me a few interesting situations where I risked my bullets for the chance to get a bandage. Despite those moments however there were still far too many bandages, and far too much food for these systems to be of much of an impact. I am happy to role-play a little but some players might resort to charging around the landscape chugging whiskey and eating biscuits, using the health regeneration to tank gunfire.

That said, there is still a great deal of intensity when it comes to fighting robots. Unlike food, bullets are very rare, weapons have lengthy reload times and shooting accurately isn't easy. There was one memorable point where I managed to take out two robots with a hatchet without taking any damage, I had a gun but I wanted to save the bullets. Considering you can't save whenever you want the stakes of dying are quite large too. You can only save at the standing stones where you drop off the MacGuffins and the boats which you use to travel to the different islands. There is a big risk reward element to this system. Either I can grab a MacGuffin and head straight back to a boat to save, or I can save time and head around the island and try to get as many MacGuffins at once. Even though death is usually the players fault your patience is still tested whenever you die, as you are required to do the same thing all over again. Throughout I couldn't help thinking a different save system would work better.

When you come across a MacGuffin there are a few options to get your grubby hands on it. You can throw a bottle to distract the robots near-by, mess it up however and those robots will run to you rather than where it smashed. Alarm clocks are the most effective, hide it somewhere, set the timer and wait for it to go off. Once the guards find it they'll realize it's a trick but usually that gives you enough time...

Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a relatively cheap indy open-world shooter. While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, it is too short to outstay its welcome too much. 

At its heart SYaBH is a stealth game and you won't survive for long if you use your weapons too much. In this game, as the title suggests, you are the quarry. For those that enjoy permadeath, I think this game is well suited to it. Such an approach would no doubt add grist to the extended-play mill. 

While I quite enjoyed SYaBH, it could potentially have been a very, very good game, and the developers seem to have settled for a game that is okay to good. Various interesting items and opponents appear in the game that add to the variety, but after the first couple of hours, careful players will learn how to keep out of trouble. From then on it's just a matter of going through the motions. Nothing happens that really shakes things up. There is no second (let alone a third) act to this game. 

Like Betrayer (which I also reviewed recently, and to which this game bares some similarity) this game has oodles of flavour and atmosphere, but not a lot of variety. Unlike Betrayer, SYaBH makes your goals clearer and there is a little bit more to be found on the islands. There is also a lot more humour in this game. While Betrayer was a very pretty looking game and SYaBH falls a little short in that regard, the graphics are more than adequate to create the 'baskervillian' moors. 

Verdict: If you like sandbox (or stealth) games, you are a bit of an anglophile and the game is on special, give it a go.",1399976584,1399976584,True,1,0,0.525931954383850098,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When version 1.0 was released, I decided to see where the game went.  I LIKE IT!  After I obtain an Oculus VR, this is going to be one of the first two games I really want to play while using it (Skyrim is the other).  The balance of the game is much better.  It can be very challenging and rewarding.  While it is better to be patient and plan your moves, you are at the mercy of your food supply.  The save system is great as it doesn't allow for a save, die, load, cheat pattern.  

The stealth is pretty good... however the only way to know you limits is to push untill a robot beeps that lets you know they heard or saw something.  If you stay still and in cover, they'll keep walking.  My constructive criticism of this game is that it's tough to understand just how stealth you are.  There is a visibility meter with an eye that gains rings as you become more visible.  They eye goes away completely when you are completely hidden.  The rings are sort of ambiguous.  They only way I see it is that you are invisible, a little visible, or visible.  Now sure what the difference between 2, 3 or 4 rings really does as far as just what the robots will notice.  Is it based on distance as well?  It's hard to tell... you do get a pretty good 'feel' for it... which might be the point.  It's not something to compute, but something to feel.  Should I take the risk, am I feeling lucky sort of thing.

Sound you make doesn't seem to equate to much of the visibility meter either.  Seems to be a whole other system of detection that goes unannounced.  I think you can just figure if you can hear them, they can hear you... sort of.  Makes it hard to just sneak up on a robot.  You're barely visible and they aren't looking in your direction as you sneak up, but all of a sudden they turn and are aiming right at you!  Guess that's the advantage to being a robot I suppose.

If you like sneaking past guards, looting buildings, or assassining then you'll probably enjoy this. However if you like replaying 20-30 minute sessions because of the rare save points and punish difficulty, then you'll likely get frusterated very quickly. The goal of the game is to scavenge for goodies, avoid starvation and detection, and find pieces of a mysterious device in a five randomly generated environments. 

The biggest problem currently with the Mac verion of Sir is the fairly frequent yet unpredictable crashes every 90-120 minutes. These seem to occur most often in some of the more exotic areas. Being that save points are infrequent, and that there are incentives to not to save often, this gets to be a big problem.

Gameplay-wise the biggest problem is the difficulty. I'm a big fan of high difficulty games, but there is not a large skill ceiling here, so it gets very frusterating even in the early stages. However because of the limited inventory system (and consumable nature of supplies) it is almost impossible to ""defeat"" the game by ""snowballing"" large amounts of supplies later on, so while Sir is punishly hard from the beginning, it stays consitent until the end.

Another big problem is the most basic enemy type, (which is also the most common enemy type) a bipedal robot with a shotgun. Having a low tier enemy, or a common enemy with shotgun in a stealth-based combat game is very frusterating. The purpose of stealth based combat is to sneak in close proximity to enemies, either to kill them or get to objectives; but if they have a shotguns, then the closer you get the stronger they get. This creates incentives to battle from a larger distance (which isn't viable), or to avoid combat altogether (which also isn't viable). Getting killed in 1-2 shots from full health is can work if it is clearly your fault, and the stealth detection system works well, just not the inability to deal with enemies regularly.

Bandages are also another problem with Sir, being that when you take damage it is possible to start bleeding out until you die. Bleeding can only be stopped by bandages, which are uncommonly found and very rarely dropped by enemies. This makes combat frusterating because even a low-damage, grazing shot on yourself (especially with the abundant shotgun enemies) can be can be lethal if you don't have a bandage. Or if you use your bandage to stop the bleed, only to get another one put on yourself by the next shot.",1399637987,1399637987,True,1,0,0.460115790367126465,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Well, since then it hasn't been on sale (until now that is). I saw it come up for 17 and couldn't let it pass me up again.

I made the purchase and honestly, I don't regret it. The game is very enjoyable and well designed. It does seem like it could use some optimization though. I don't have a gaming rig by any means. I run an i7 laptop, 8 gigs of ram, and a intel hd 3000 integrated graphics. I can play fairly comfortably on low settings (roughly 30 frames). There are times where I dip into the 20s and even teens but it's not very noticable due to the stealth nature of this game.

What are you missing by running low graphics as compared to high? Well, it seems that high graphics introduce more shrubbery (low grass and the such), more shadow effects, a little more general detail (kind of a given), and a further viewing distance. All these would be nice to have but I defintely haven't found that not having them hinders the gameplay or fun.

Now some may argue that it was a quick death, but there is no doubt that there is a group of people out there that would definitely question my methods of robot killing. Maybe it was inhumane, maybe robots have a complex mechanism system in place that lets them consciously feel pain and fear, which may be like or unlike the nervous system that we humans have, or maybe the group of robots I killed whom were patrolling the church were actually a friendly group of robots, and I made a terrible mistake by generalising all robots to be savage/mindless drones, and without giving them the benefit of the doubt to explain their humaneness I killed the whole lot of them. Now I will still go on to argue that you can not kill what was not alive in the first place, I'm sure these robots did not function on a conscious basis of awareness in both their existence and life around them, and everything they did was probably out of pre-programmed coding for situationary reactions. But there definitely will be some politically correct robot-abuse advocate out there who will without a seconds doubt scold and judge me for the dynamite incident that I was responsible that day.

Although Sir, You Are Being Hunted bills itself as a stealth game, in reality you will spend most of your time avoiding your robotic foes altogether as you trudge over empty hills in search of the macguffins you need to escape the islands. 

This is no accident: interaction has been designed out of the game in several ways.

Foremost is the lack of any player motivation to approach the robots (save for those which guard each macguffin ‚Äì more on that later). The best the game musters is its hunger system, which encourages scavenging the abandoned settlements where robots are more likely to patrol. Alas, early on in my game I shot and cooked two rabbits. This simple task, plus occasional visits to unguarded buildings, led to me finishing the game with enough rabbit in my trousers to feed a poorhouse.

The wide open terrain also works against interaction by giving the player too much information and too many choices. There is [i]always[/i] plenty of warning of approaching bots, and there is [i]always[/i] more than enough space to hide in until they pass. When the player is spotted, running and hiding in the open are both farces.

The game compounds all of this with a thinly-spread checkpoint save system, punishing experimentation and killing curiosity. Developers: please stop doing this.

With the player relegated to an observer it‚Äôs just as well that the bots are fun to watch. Pathfinding AI is robust, with sensible group dynamics, and the designs are imaginative and distinctive riffs on various aristocratic stereotypes.

Procedural island generation is also reliable. Yet despite each biome having one special feature (Castle and Industrial, added later in development, shine in this regard) they otherwise all merge into one brown lump. The slightly different items sprinkled on top aren‚Äôt enough to create anything memorable and it doesn‚Äôt help that they offer no apparent variation in robot behaviour, type or numbers.

Which brings me to the subject of pacing. Here it is in one sentence: the more macguffins you collect, the more robots there are. You will otherwise finish the game in the same way you started: avoiding bands of robots until you find a macguffin, then killing or distracting the two (always two!) low-level robots guarding it, then scurrying back to the nearest checkpoint while again avoiding all contact with anything.

The letters scattered about try to hang a wider narrative on these bones, but they are so rare that multiple play-throughs are required to join any dots together ‚Äì and that is not a prospect I relish.",1399237777,1399280414,False,951,2,0.815918505191802979,23,True,False,False,False,,,

You're going to bleed to death, you're going to starve to death, you're going to be shot with shotguns, or blugeoned with giant robo-canes, or gnawed on by vicious robo-hounds, or spmething equally unfair.

That's sort of the point though. This game isn't at all fair, and it makes that the central theme. You, Sir (or Madam) have been unceremoniously deposited in an alternate dimension. In Britain. Your interdimensional whatever has exploded all over five islands, and in order to get home, you needto find the smoking remains and cram them in to a conveniently sized hole in a magic rock.

Also, there are a lot of robots, and no people.

Robots have a pretty good idea what you want, and despite some clearly worded letters to the contrary they aren't inclined to give it to you. They'll do a pretty decent job of patrolling, on foot, in baloons, with robo-hounds, and they'll make a habit of frequenting the places where you find things you need to not starve to death or die from being mauled by robots.

As you retrieve the pieces of your gizmo, the robot hunt will intensify, adding new types of robots to the hunt and increasing their number.

Luckily, you have the opportunity to save your progress at the aformentioned magic stones, or at the boats that carry you between islands. You should do that, because you're probably going to die once or twice.

Aside from weaponry (which is pretty scarce) there are plenty of insteresting gizmos to spice up your experience including bear traps, fire, trombones, alarm clocks, toy trains, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and a slow of other useful or just fun to find stuff to help, hinder, or amuse you along the way.

You're on a group of islands in the English countryside, where a bunch of robots dressed as hunters and gentlemen are stalking you as the last human alive on the island.  This isn't a shooter; you are prey.  Run, hide, ambush, loot, survive.

An interesting game mechanic (besides not allowing save-anywhere, which is as it should be for a game such as this) is that your health is constantly draining.  You need to eat to keep up your health, and you need to forage to get food.  This keeps you in constant motion and heading in new directions rather than camping.  A second mechanic which I haven't seen in a game before is that messing with inventory doesn't stop the world...do you finish moving your inventory around to pick up more loot, or do you keep an eye out for hunters?  It adds a decent sense of fear to the game.

I haven't played much of it yet, but it is unlike anything I've played before, and has a sense of whimsy to cover up what is essentially a horror/survival game.  Definitely a fun game.

You run around islands collecting fragments and then lugging them back to the center. That's your objective. This means that you'll be going through the same areas over and over as you run back and forth like a courier to the centermost section of the center island. This is tedious, needlessly time-consuming, and not very fun.

There is a reason stealth action games have not historically been open world/sandbox games. When you have all the space you need to navigate, you can just avoid most dangers by taking a wide route around them. There is no tension 90% of the time you are playing. It's just running, running, and more running. The amount of time you spend not playing the game and instead running and searching from place to place is absurd. It's seriously as bad as an MMO.

There are plenty of other small issues: Houses and buildings don't actually exist, they're just gigantic loot crates where you can click on the door to search them. There are huge inconsistencies in what qualifies as grass you can hide in and grass that's just there for show. AI is not any more intelligent than in other games, even though the developers brag about it in the description.

Fortunately, most of these issues can be fixed post-release, if the devs pay mind to them. Change the objective of the game in some way so that we aren't running back and forth, make the entire world WAY more dense with both loot and enemies (so that players are never just mindlessly sprinting across an entire island), and add more stealth elements to the game than just hiding in grass or behind a building every now and then.",1399147178,1399147178,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Now, I am enjoying the game, as I said, but it is really not going to be a game everyone can get behind in my opinion simply because of the simplicity of the game, i.e. go here, grab that, come back, repeat. Sure you have to avoid all the enemies along the way and yes, that is quite a challange but thats it.

Now, I like it.

Above is my video impressions of the game.

Sir, You are being hunted certainly has a lot of style going for it. It features unique visuals and design, as well as interesting open world stealth mechanics. The game is a sandbox when it comes to how you tackle your goals. Though the environment and character design are interesting and unique, it's not all smooth sailing. There are certain execution issues, most notably the low res, and dull textures. It is the one most dominant flaw with Sir, but other than that, It's an enjoyable game.

Positives:
- Randomly generated worlds offer more replayablity
- Unique theme, character, and environmental design
- The world feels large
- Strong stealth mechanics
- Challenging game play
- Good sense of humor
- Supports mods

Negatives:
- Low res and muddy textures
- Could be too difficult for some
- Depending on the generation of the world, it can some times feel empty
- Lighting is passable, but nothing special",1399134210,1399134210,True,4,0,0.578947365283966064,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The intensity is non-stop. The entire time, you are searching 5 islands for the mysterious stone fragments, which then need to be returned to the center of the center island. However, with each stone found, the robot hunters become stronger. The game becomes even more intense when you hear the beeping of the robots, indicating that you've been found. You can run, or you can try to fight back with the little ammo you have in your shotgun. Be careful, because each shot you fire is very loud, and will attract many other hunters. The game features stealth with terrain, a visibility meter, vitality (which is hunger and thirst), a day/night cycle, building searching, looting robots, and many kinds of enemies. Overall, the game is horror in its rawest form: you, alone, with many wanting to kill you. That being said, the game isn't really scary, but extremely intense. I highly recommend it.

My dearest player,

I have been on the hunting grounds for a long time and have been a witness to all it's changes. Wheather the changes benifited me or aided the enemy to my dismay, I have seen it all. It was a relentless journey that filled me with the upmost fear. Yet, depited my cowerdice, I still managed a brave face and went on my journey, and I enjoyed every step of it. When I was told the news that I was being hunted, I must say, I didn't take it well. THe grounds were plain and empty at first, but as the time went on, things begain to change. There was more to find each and evry day, as well as more to hide from. This hunt. This dangrous game. This sport of man verses robot. This was terrifing, yet exelerating. I don't know if it was because I've gone mad with the idea of a semingly difficult victory or if I just grew to love the sport. Whose to say really. My dearest player. How much I miss you. I wish I could wright you a whole novel of my adventures here on the hunting ground, but I must go. I can hear them coming ever so closer to me.

The last words you hear before entering the game and the only real guide you have.
This game is a genre of its own, there are no other games like it on the market. Theres nothing like walking through a field in the dead of night and suddenly hearing strange robotic noises. you duck down into the grass only to see several automatons come marching past, you hold your breath praying that they didant see you, adrenaline rushing through your veins. you rumage through your backpack searching for something to defend yourself with. you find an empty bottle and toss it over the hedge line. your hunters turn and hastily march over to the source of the noise. you turn and run as fast as you can.

Dispite my description sounding as if you are helpless and defenseless you are really not, there are plenty of things to use to decieve and kill your enemy.

I would reccomend this game to anyone who loves hardcore survival games and people who love stealth games in general. it has amazing combat mechanics and stealth mechanics and is one of the most finished early access games on steam.

Sadly is has a few flaws like a complicated directions system and it can be very difficult to find good loot and food to keep your vitality alive, but dispite these flaws the game is still very playable and i have not encountered a single bug.

The game is slightly difficult and has a little bit of a learning curve, and you are really only given a slight nudge at the beginning of the game as to what you need to do. The developers and the rest of the team that made this game are extremely helpful and friendly and make the forums a welcoming environment.

If you enjoy stealth, suspense, a world to explore, whilst being hunted  by a bunch of gents in need of a spot of oil and repair, then this is the game for you.

The difficulty progression is very solid, and the variety of robots is impressive (and keeps things from getting old).

But it was a little weird to have to travel between islands - i would have preferred to have one giant island.

That said, there's definitely more work to be done before I could honestly recommend this as a gift for someone.

It was launched stable and with some good content. It was updated once a month with lots of bug fixes and content. 
Now its close to release and its better than ever! 

This is a fun, challenging and scary survival game. You have an open world of 5 islands to explore and the objective is to find pices of fragments that will help you get out of there. Around each island there are robots roaming/guarding villages and the fragment locations. You can sneak past them, distract them and/or ambush them with different traps and weapons. 

The stealth system is great and there is a good viarity among the robots, Normal guards with shotguns, dogs, flying patrol units, cavalry, scarecrow, land owner and a few more that i dont want to spoil. (some of them are really creepy) 

The story is pretty cool, its nothing special but its not bad. 

Is this worth you money? 
If you like a challenging game where it will take you some time to learn what to do and how to do it, if you are playing for the survival feeling, not the Call of duty ""run and gun"" gameplay.. this is a game for you.

The atmosphere feels perfect. Especially when the sun goes down and you jump at any sound that sounds remotely like a bleep and/or bloop. I've yet to find a gun through my few attepts but I've managed to get by with using rocks for distractions when I need to. Improvising should be something you should always keep in mind while playing. Your butler Walters also helps you get an idea of what you should be doing upon your first time playing.
There are a few things that can and WILL screw you over though. Such as the robot's pathing glitching into eachother...on one of the pieces you need to collect. The music (being very well done btw) is a bit of an annoyance. It starts playing when you need to keep your ears open when you've got your face buried in some shrubery and is completely silent when you're being chased.

If you can overlook the small problems/bugs you find in the game then I would say, buy it. you'll get a lot of fun out of it and you won't regret it. Unless they release a patch that breaks the game forever. Then I imagine you would.",1397840420,1397840420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The five islands are procedurally generated, and are absolutely stunning, with beautiful sunsets, dark woods, and eerie moonlit moors. Everywhere the robotic voices of your pursuers pierce the silence, and hearing the thumping and screams of the Landowner approaching is a truly terrifying thing.

I really, really like this game, but I have two concerns. First, ‚Äúcollect the MacGuffins‚Äù is becoming overly familiar as a goal in procedurally-generated games. Second, and more complicated, is that procedurally-generated games always make me feel like I‚Äôve seen pretty much everything I‚Äôm likely to see, far earlier than their promise of endless variations might suggest. While the environments are never identical, variations that feel significantly different are fairly rare, and the nature of procedural generation means you‚Äôll mostly see stuff that falls within a certain band of stuff that looks much the same.

Welp, I finally got round to buying it today and I've fallen into it's grasp already.

Sir is an exceptionally fun and entralling play, from the moment you step into the world you find yourself tingling with excitment at all the possibilties that lie ahead. The world is procedurally generated mind, under 5 different categories, so every player has a vastly different experience, which really builds on the excitement. 

The British touch is terribly amusing as well, and really adds a unique feel to the game that I have yet to experience elsewhere. In fact, the whole game is original to that same extent. From the simplistic yet gorgeous scenery; to the merciless droids that prance around in hunt for you; everything about this game is truly one of a kind.

All in all, 'Sir, You Are Being Hunted' is an excellent game. It's intense, un-nerving and heart-poundingly thrilling, but, by the same token, tranquil, soothing and beautifully scenic. It all depends where you are, and what you're doing, and I can only suggest one thing... that you purchase it now and dive into the world yourself, unlocking the exclusive, unique experience that lies in wait for you, and you only.

The core element of the game is to survive.  Loot, sneak, kill, repeat to paraphrase a popular song of 2013.  

The thing that impressed me the most about the game was the environment - the randomly generated areas are great and depending on where you are (industrial, moors, mountains etc.) you will have a different experience dependant on how easily you can get from point A to point B, who you may or may not encounter along the way and how much cover you might be afforded.

The humour is another element of the game which is great, from the robots screaming ""Ah! me leg"" when they're caught in a bear trap, to the ability for the player to set up an alarm clock or a model train set as a distraction, the game will both surprise and humour you.

Would easily recommend it to someone who is jaded with the whole zombie scene of survival games or is a bit of a steam-punk fan - or they just want a fun & humourous game.

I would recommend this game to players who enjoy stealth type first person shooters(though none automatic weapons). It's challenging and the atmosphere puts you in the position of being a prey. At first it is scary in an environment where humans are replaced by robots. Once you are settled the fright factor is not vanished, but you know it's becoming a survival and a vengence game. Absolutely love it! I have just completed this game. Spent a solid 15 hours. It's like British Ninja vs Vintage Terminators. 

I have over 300 friends on my Steam and none of them has got this game and only 3 of them wants this. If any of you read this, buy it! Would love to have achievements on this! Anyway thank you Big Robot Ltd can't wait for new updates and keep up the great work =)

A truly gentleman's game!

Not because its dark or the enemies have their intestines hanging out, but because of the amazing sense of apprehension and fear it manages to build with minimal sound or graphic complexity. There is something about being hunted by robots with guns, horses and dogs that makes you feel powerless and weak. However, this is probably the game's negative too: it can be quite frustrating when you have 2 shotgun ammo, a rock and alcohol to survive 10 robots (this happens often later on if you're not stealthy). I would like to see mod support added (not sure if it is possible with Unity), some more biome options (there are greyed out ""edit"" buttons so I assume its coming) and maybe customisable difficulty (like robot spawn rates, robot health, accuracy, and senses). Overall, this Early Access game has to be one of the best on the system. It has tension, 19th century guns and plenty of British accents.

So what has it got going for itself?
Sir, You Are Being Hunted is an Action Stealth game being created by Big Robot Ltd. In the past, they have created a game under the name of AVSEQ. To say the least, it was a mixed opinion. Now this has come out, and to say the least, AVSEQ can't even compare towards SYABH. In the game, you are stuck on a total of five islands. You require to collect some artifacts, bring them to the central location on the map, and use them to save progress. The game is beat, when all the artifacts are located, and used. To keep you from completing your target, a good number of robots will try to hunt you down, and shoot ten shotgun shells into your skull. Charming to say the least. While avoiding them, you must also find food to stay alive. These three concepts mix together to create the enviroment you will be in, and it works amazingly. You have to keep so much on your mind while you explore this world. Where is that robot? How hungry am I? What caused those crows to fly away? It really keeps you on your toes. At the moment, enemy mixture is decent, but not all content at the moment is final, considering its early access. 

Gameplay. A big part to say the least. The game is mostly stealth, so you will be crouched most of the time. Noise and visibilty is view by a eye and noise icon at the bottom of the screen. Stealth works nicely at the moment. You feel any action COULD have its problems. Anything noisey will cause the robots to invesigate, which could be your death, OR your key to survival. Distractions become a big part of the game when the robots just wont cooperate to move away from a location or something along those lines. A well placed alarm clock or even a toy train will divert their attention just long enough so you can complete your task. However, keeping in mind, I said this was a ACTION game. At some instances during your looting of buildings, guns or ammunition will be found among the skulls and mouldy bread. Your options now open up a bit more. A problem could be controlled, a divertion could be caused, or you could simply run and gun. The last option is NOT recommended. On a personal note, at times i have played this game in the pitch dark. A few encounters have made me spoil my boxers to say the least. My point is, under the right conditions, you can turn it a bit into a horror. 

As a sum up, this game is great. More than that really. Exploring these vast wastelands while worrying about all the issues has never felt so good. Even a few times, this game has made me chuckly due to the slight humor. (Robots taking a tea break to say the least is one of them.) I really recommend getting this game, and as time goes on, more content will be added. As of writing this, i have not even tried the January Patch yet! There is nothing more to say that this really:

Let's be completely honest with ourselves! This game is 20$ I beat it in around an hour on the hardest difficulty and that's that. I'm done with it! There's no replayability and even playing the game for one play through got repetitive! You literally just walk about and pick up god damn thermoses! It's a novel idea but implemented to a degree of shit that makes it look like the Harrison administration actually accomplished something, it's ridiculous!

""Sir (or Madam), You Are Being Hunted"" is a 'procedurally-generated' first person shooter, set in a hilariously extreme British world, where robot gentlemen hunt humans for sport.
The game does a lot of things right. The setting is unique, as is the plot. Your job, as the human, is to survive against the robotic apocalypse and track down fragments of a teleportation device that will get you safely out of this 'tweedpunk' nightmare. There are 25 fragments, scattered across five islands. If and when you are caught, the robots will not hesitate to shoot. Should you lose all your health and fall to the ground, you'll be sent back to the place where you last saved.
An impressive array of weapons awaits you, however, should you pick and choose your battles wisely. There are weapons ranging from the close-encounter woodcutter's axe to the fine hunting rifle, along with a pistol, shotgun, and blunderbuss. Ammo is scarce, and should be conserved.
Along with ammo and weaponry, there are foodstuffs and bandages. If you've ever played Minecraft, you understand that eating food doesn't refill your health.

why?
-well, the saving system is realy bad. just on boats and at the circle

i couldn't go on, why? there are two devices-fragments, with two groups of robots one in a forest, the secound at the border of that forest and the pretty plain fields. if you go to one of the two spots you also have to be aware of the group of hunters with the dog and the robot-hunter-guy in the forrest. how should i say, random or not, there are with the solo-hunter 9 robots at the same spot and a little village in noise-range for some more.
the first try, after my dead was nice: returning, killing the solo with the hatchet, between the small gras spots near to the plain-fragment, because of the scarecrow and the ""i see you"" i have to attack with the second group in my back, but well i could run.
killing the two robots with my hardly saved ammo and run like hell... well the dog is faster.
second turn, again crawling to the spot, again killing the solo with the hatchet, this time i'm starting with the forrest spot, more hiding options. sneak to them for an hatchet-kill... well there comes the hunting-party with the dog again... third try
finally killing the plain-group, ready to pick the fragment up and run like hell... well this third time i forgot to empty my inventory for the fragment => there comes the party, death
fourth one, sneaking to the spot, kill the solo, so i could hide my stuff in the little shack in the woods, again sneak to the plain group, well this time the hunting party is crossing my way to soon. death
...
i try and i try, several times, the fighting and sneaking is funny and cool but well, the running to it, hidding the stuff, 20 times or more is getting really annoying. i'm sure, if i could save right there or at least at the shack, it would be ok. i would try it 40 times more, because i bought the game for sneaking, planning, trying and fighting. but the hole running part to it, because my next savepoint is the circle... that sucks, really it sucks.

-the bleeding
two shots dead, ok. that is ok, but two shots nearly dead win the fight, open the inventory and bleeding kills you, that sucks.  i died several times after wining a fight (with sneaking, running or a combat gun vs. gun) because i was to slow with the inventory to stop the bleeding. if somebody shoots you down to a few hp-points you could give up, because you need real luck to be quick enough with the inventory

-the inventory
remindes me to diablo I and this stuff, you have small space, could only sort it out while the game is running and you could get killed all the time and don't have a quick-sort-button. not the big deal, but if you find out the fragment is big and you have to pick it up fast or die, it could be really making you happy, even if you die anyways, it give you the feeling there was a chance

The big problem for me is the saving system, you could handle even bad luck like a big group of robots on patrol around to fragment-spots with two groups of guards with tactic and trying. but it sucks if you have to run everytime again to the point, crawling and sneaking on the way to it, hiding the stuff because you have to much of everything and then die to repeat it...
even a barrel or two at the circle would help, so you don't have to run allways to your store-places and get in, out and return sneaking to get shot...

I'm going to watch the next updates, maybe it becomes better (or me^^) but i'm pretty sure, making the fighting/crawling and so on easier would be a bad way, because thats the game. i think the saving-system it the problem for me",1390511553,1390511731,False,1,0,0.432624191045761108,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The premise of the game seems to be: Find the special glowy things while running away a lot. Sometimes you'll find a weapon, but using one is usually more dangerous than not. That sounds great in theory, and the game has potential, certainly, but currently the game feels a lot emptier than the time it takes to generate each world would have you believe. There are several buildings, but you can't actually enter any of them. The reasons for this are well explained in a developer blog (and essentially boil down to ""it'd be too easy to escape from the robots if you could and would take too much time away from things that are far more important"") but that doesn't help with the emptyness factor. 

I'm not sure if it's actually true (or if it's something to be worked on later), but it feels like you're literally the only non-robot in the world; every time I play it I'm left with a feeling of loneliness which makes me want to stop playing. My one hour of game time on record (which I'm sure is slightly more than that in reality but probably not much) is spread over at least 4 sessions, because I just couldn't keep playing it any longer. Not because the game is bad, per se, but because there (currently!) isn't much to do other than run away from robots. Nobody to interact with, no side-quests or missions to complete (that I've ever found). It feels less like a singleplayer game, and more like a multiplayer game with nobody else on the server. That kind of 'there should be something else here but there isn't"" kind of feeling. Admittedly, that could very well be due to it's Early Access status, but nevertheless it's for sale now, so worth mentioning. The fact that your opponents are literally a bunch of machines intentionally devoid of any individual personality doesn't help here either (they're characterful, certainly, but they're all basically the same other than 'Baloon Guy' and the new Poacher).

I like the ideas in the game, and I'll keep checking back every now and then, but so far it's not a game I enjoy playing. And not in a Spec Ops: The Line style ""you're not supposed to enjoy it"" way. Entirely willing to admit however that it might just ""not be my sort of game"", because a lot of other people love it.",1388792866,1388793746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Although you have multiple personas to choose from (trapper, drunk, artist...), the Aristocrat is still the one that gives you the fullest experience (nothing but bandages at the start). I'd recommend starting with him.

Note for Vista users: It works, BUT will drain more resources than it should because of the lack of support for this OS (and hence optimization). Older average computers running Vista will be put under stress and can overheat as a result.

The minced pie I ate on the trip has me feeling pretty good, I'll head along the coastline and try to stay out of trouble a while. So much for staying out of trouble, I've just walked right into some ol' boy's bottom brush and it appears he's out for an early stroll. I'd bet my last bottle of brandy that's a blunderbuss tucked under 'is arm too. 

I'm far enough away he hasn't noticed me, I'll head for that big tree now that he's turned and started back. Still not too light and the tree and tall grass has me well hidden, I'll wait here a bit and see what this chap's up to. There he is, heading back this way again, coming down the hill out of the trees. Where you going, Gov'nor? As I suspected, he's coming this way, going to stop right out there 40 yards from where I'm crouched. 

Okay - I'm quite hidden, don't think he will see me at all, just have to be quiet. Gonna be you or me, sparky, blunderbuss to blunderbuss - I get one chance at this, don't rooster it up. Here he comes, I can hear his whirring gizmos. Little closer, bit further, there - stopped right where I thought you would, pretty mornin' ain't it..? 

Now turn, start back, now or never - creep from my hiding spot a few feet, NOW RUN! Run right for 'im! No 2nd guessing now, I'm committed, closer, closer, almost to him. He's turned! Shoot! Shoot now or I'm dead! At this range there'll be no hope!

GAWD, what a roar! The blast! Was it mine or his? I'm still standing... he's NOT! I got him! He's there on the ground, sizzlin' and cracklin' like June bugs in a camp fire. I'm alive. HA! Take that, ya clanging pile of bolts. Crap, I'd better make myself scarce, no time for celebration the whole county must've heard that. 

I'll just see what chap has first - a pair of pliers, nice - and if you don't mind good sir, I'll trade my empty blunderbuss for your loaded one, 'preciate it. Gotta get the hell outta here now...

You have two goals: assemble pieces of some sort of mysterious artifact to return home, and most importantly survive.

Surviving is easier said than done, however, with well armed hunters, poachers, robodogs, and even a scarecrow that follows you around all trying to exterminate you.  Even if you get your hands on a gun the sound of gunfire will attract other nearby robots and they will rush to your location to investigate, so attacking quickly and quietly with an axe is your best option if you can't avoid a fight.  You have a vitality meter which acts as a hunger meter that you have to constantly keep your eyes on.  You can't run most of the time unless you're positive the coast is clear, for these robots have 2000x2000 vision and will instantly spot you.

This is not the game for you if you desire a casual romp through the fields, and it's unlikely the devs will make it any easier.

But I can be running around for hours, and not have anyone hunting me. As they're too busy patrolling buildings.

Again, this game is in heavy development. I hope in the future that the robots actually do what this game title is; hunt you down, where you're forced to run and watch your back.

take heart though since you can find weapons to defend you self from the robots whilst you find your fragments as well as random objects you can throw to distract them.

The only caveat is that the multiplayer is based on very old code, so you may run into bugs playing with your buds. I personally haven't had any problem with multiplayer, but I have heard that they are not uncommon.

Ok, they added stuff like classes and persistent containers now but the core gameplay is still the same. Search stone, pick up stone, return to portal (walk), insert stone, repeat. If enemies appear, sneak around. Don't know if there'll be some change then but I can't imagine doing this for hours so I won't know.
I really want to like the game, I like Don't starve and the classic Thief series and steampunk and England and sneaking around in general but I'm just not having fun here as there is not really much to do.


Early access review below->

-Sir, can't recommend buying at the moment-

I'll retry in half a year though since it's early access if they add more content and completely change the gameplay. The setting and the ideas looked good so I gave it a try. I'm always for some good stealth in a randomized scary robo-england.

However that's it. Endlessly creeping through the grass. Like some stealth-""don't starve"" minus the crafting. The houses are just large loot chests and there's a lack of detail to the surroundings. After searching some of the item storages I found it's not really worth it - maybe they'll add some crafting for the junk items? Leading up to the next problem with the small inventory. The game's mission is to search out key items in the landscape which take up half of your inventory and carry them back to the start. (They'll probably add permanent storage chests to fix this which means even more backtracking through murky environments).  Mostly the key items are guarded by some robots so you'll have to sneak there. I did that three times and realized it wasn't fun anymore then (you're supposed to do this over and over apparently). 

I'm not really sure if they will change the gameplay entirely when the game releases so buyers beware. Indeed beware of all early access games from my experience but that's a complex topic.",1387322510,1399232831,False,9,0,0.455624938011169434,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Is so creepy, you have to hide as best as you can. i prefer to hide at night because I can't see too well then.

Now professionally......
I quite enjoy the game. When I first tried out the game, it was relatively simple. Squires in towns that you can't let see you looting houses otherwise they get irritable, poachers in the woods that force you to be wary of bear traps, scarcrows that work like living weeping angels that don't kill you but scream like crazy, a blimp, a seamonster, and normal hunting robots with their temporary bear trap dogs. Now, It has branched out a fair bit. Now there are very speedy horsmen who run you over with the force of a steampunkish floating car and knock you flat in doing so, a castle biome, the landowner with his cane & freaky horn noises & knocking you flat on your back where his 2 pet hounds finish you off and or trap you, and much fewer fragments to find beefore you win. As a side note, something weird happened yesterday in the game for me while I was offline but that can wait until later. Anywho, all this christmas pudding and brandy and such, is simply delicious. For me, this is a game of eats, sweets, meats, hunting, running, hiding, ambushing, trapping, eating bad food, hurting, eating all sorts of random mushrooms you find, shooting, hacking, sneaking, stealing, escaping, and definitely more but I don't know what.
Also, I propose 2 new things to add to the game. Fishing, and either digging or undrground tunnels with exceptionally well hidden entrances. the tunnels would probably be in the mountain biome. I know that you are working on the multiplayer thing right now probably, but I mean when you are done with that I think it might be a good idea. Maybe adding a mine biome? There is or was such a thing as mines on small islands.",1387321962,1396561733,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You hear those damned voices again. You don't know how many are out there, Just that they will not stop until you are dead.


So what should you do? Run, Try to make a last stand? Could you possibly kill them all, Weaken them? 


You take a peek out of the bushes and see them looking through the grove to your right. They are sweeping to area in a counter-clockwise fashion and will soon near you. So you grab a rock and lob it in their general direction, in trying to keep their soulless eyes away from your hiding place.


Success! The rock appears to distract the hunters from your impending ousting. You wait for them to turn their backs to you while they attempt to find the source of the noise.


This is your chance! You decide to take out the first hunter you see and make a break for it. You grip your pistol with both hands and start squeezing on the trigger, raising your weapon up in front of you. The crude sights aiming near the sounds of footsteps and crunching of the grass. 


Now! You burst out of the brush and hastily fire off two shots into the back of one of the automatons before veering into the opposite direction of the group.


You hope you sent that bastard to android hell.


You assume you are southbound but you don't have time to check your compass.


""I'll try to find a path out of this place later, the only thing that matters now is that this direction is away from those monsters.""


Inhuman screeching followed by gunshots breaks your train of thought as bullets whiz past you. Your speed doubles and your heart pounds faster than it has even pounded before. You were never a working man, your legs and heart used to feel as if you had just ran a marathon after you went up the stairs. 


The fact that you are possibly having a heart attack is the least of your worries right now as a second volley of lead is the more immediate danger.


You make it over a hill and believe you have broken the predators line of sight.


They will catch up soon, think fast! You leap over a fence and sprint towards a nearby ditch. You lie down in an attempt to make yourself less visible and make yourself quieter. You start piling mud on top of yourself to make some impromptu camouflage.


Catching your breath you greedily inhale air for your deprived lungs. You hear voices approach and you slow your breath, hoping that they will ignore you and move past. You hear the wet thumps of metal hitting mud as the pack nears you. Your body tenses up just like the metal demons that are hunting you. You attempt to stay quiet and motionless as they search through the nearby brush searching for you before you finally hear them move on. You lay for what seems to be the longest few minutes of your life before letting out the longest sigh of your life as you reflect on these last few hours and how you nearly died multiple times. The last words you heard before you were deposited on this accursed archipelago echo through your mind.

It's a brilliant survival game, the art style and mood is one of a kind, If you turn out the light's & put headsets on, then prepare for epic suspense, the game just has that kind of feeling about it.
Make your way through 5 different Biomes Castle, Fens, Industrial, Mountains & Rural, all of which have a distinctly different feel but all ties to the british countryside.

Hunt the Robots, Run from the Robots, Trap the Robots, Hide from those pesky hunting laser beemed eyes with Robots attached to them.
Patch by patch, the game keeps getting better & now we are at Version 1.0.
Stealth wins the day, being in a rush will ruin it, stay hiden, think sneaky & you'll be fine........maybe.

The devs know what they want and they listen to thier backers.

Overall what makes this game good is the replayability, every game is different, the exploration is particulally fun, altough the shooting aspect leaves a little to be desired, most of the time you will either be hiding or sniping from a distance, so that's not such a large problem. The hunger bar feature, although questionable in Minecraft, works well in this, forcing you to venture into the heart of machine infested villages for food, rather then making an encounter with a machine a very rare occurance.

You don't get very much in the way of weapons with the default character, so you're left with some distraction techniques and that's it.  The rest has to be scavenged from the island, except good luck with that.  Also, visibility is really poor no matter if it's day or night, but again, that seems to hinder you and not the robots very much.   

If there was a simple takedown, even if only temporary that I could do, this would be a cool mashup of survival and stealth.  So far as I can tell though, there isn't one, or at least the game hasn't told me about any takedown techniques.  Then again I did find a book in one playthrough so maybe it's something you're supposed to scavenge as well... books about how to deal with the robots?

Anyway, this is early access, but it looks OK... just way too dark, gloomy and yet way too wide open with few areas you can really hide out or sneak in.  The name of the game is to find these pieces of something and bring them back to a set of ""Standing stones"" like the standing stones in Skyrim... 

You can change the layout of the various islands to certain set archetypes (fens, industrial, rural, and one I can't remember right now).  Unfortunately that's 4 different island types but there are 5 islands (a center island with four islands to the cardinal directions).  I guess if you fancy a specific type of terriain you could make the whole thing the same, or you could try to make every part somewhat different (but two islands have to be the same).   

It's procedurally generated so you won't be able to get used to the landscape too much, but at the same time, it's not so different that it will look unfamiliar either.   

The bottom line is that right now, the default character is a tad difficult.  An easier character starts out with lots of traps and ways to stop the enemy from chasing you, but that may well be TOO easy.  Updated review coming when I've had time to play with it more.

Yes, and here's why. 

Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a very fun, different, and interesting open world sandbox game. In the game you will be primarily exploring a few randomly generated islands that have their own specail theme such as open country, industrial regions, and mountainous regions. In order to survive you will have to be stealthy to avoid detection. You will have to loot buildings for food and other supplies. In some cases you may have to use weapons to dispatch those pesky robots that are hunting you, but do so with caution, as gunfire can attract even more hunters which would make your already desperate situation even worse. 

The game is an early release but it is in a very playable state. No need to wait for the final release, start having fun now.

I blindly bought this game knowing absolutely nothing about it and having not heard even the title before.  However something about the first 30 seconds into the quick video ""December Festive Teapot"" had me hooked and before even finishing the trailer, I bought it.

Now obviously this is a Beta, this does have bugs and is not a final product but this is a very exciting opportunity as a gamer to be a part of the continuation of improvements it will undertake, ultimately ending up as a finished project.  That being said, as it stands, it's remarkable!  Coming from someone who always looks for reviews or some form of general acceptance or denial helps me at times to filter through the vast array of games available.
  
This one bypassed a frequent filtering system and found its way into my game collection - boy am I glad it did.  Right from the beginning I was hooked on the art style, the Steam-Punk appearance to the UI.  It was nice to have a handful of choices prior to starting the game as to who you want to wonder the eerie islands as.  Once in the game and quickly advancing past the ""tutorial"" if you will, I began my journey - no idea what kind of journey or what to expect.  But with my binoculars, and rags, I began to walk.  As I said, I had no prior knowledge as to what the game was about I just installed it and started playing and before I knew it was I quiet literally being hunted, and yes I feared for my life.

The audio is raw, it's intense, it really suites the environment and the atmosphere.  It felt like I was actually being gunned down as I ran for my life and literally jumping in my seat at each sound of gunfire.  This was intense as very few games legitimately have me jumping out of my seat but the sounds of gun shots in the atmosphere had me completely engaged in my survival.  By seeking shelter in a field with some form of grain I crouched and managed to get away only with a few shots making contact.

As the environment goes through its day to night time cycle there were times my eyes played tricks on me making me think there were people around me, this was effectively conveyed through the spooky as hell tree shadows.  These shadows sway along the ground and surrounding environment displaying some eerie shapes.  The sound design for the environment at this time compliments the eerie environment the night time paints around you, equally so when the suns shining.  

However there is a fairly long wait time to actually start a new game, this of course is because the game is procedurally generating new environment layouts and such for a fresh experience every time, but the wait time can take a few minutes.  Once in, the game runs smooth other than a few laggy moments when looting buildings, this of course was to be expected.  The graphics in game are quiet nice considering the stage of development, though my only comment is they are lacking in the building areas as the resolution on some doors and walls is quiet poor.

I can't be too critical at this time as I'm certain they are aware of all these comments and graphics really are of no concern for a Beta experience.  As for gameplay i've only encountered those few laggy moments - as it stands, it's extremely impressive and am happy I pushed aside my usual routine of check up and went through with purchasing it.  I look forward to future development and advancement and will most definitely be an active player along the way!

Unlike Thief, you spend quite a bit of time traversing open space, which is a kind of nervewracking unto itself.  The recent addition of fat scarecrows with ""Slim Man"" tendancies makes open fields even more worrisome. 

Picked this one up during a sale, and it's definitely worth $10.  If you like sneaky stuff, it's worth the regular price as well.

""Sir, You are being hunted"" est un m√©lange entre un jeu de survie √† la ""DayZ"" mais aussi √† la ""Don't Starve"".
Vous y incarnez un homme (ou une femme) qui ce retrouve coinc√© dans un monde o√π les robots vous chasses comme du gibier. Grosse parodie de la chasse √† l'anglaise, vous devez retrouver 24 artefacts pour pouvoir revenir dans votre maison mais cela ne va pas √™tre si simple croyez-moi !

Le jeu propose un certains challenge et vous allez devoir g√©rer votre survie √† tout prix ! C'est en s√©lectionnant une classe en d√©but de jeu que vous allez pouvoir choisir votre niveau de difficult√© et partir avec plus ou moins d'√©quipement. Le monde dans lequelle vous jouez est divis√© en 5 zones diversifi√©es ou non et g√©n√©r√©es al√©atoirement. A vous de choisir avant de d√©buter votre partie. La g√©n√©ration de monde est assez longue et vous prend environ 5 bonnes minutes mais une fois en jeu, la partie peut commencer ! Graphiquement, le jeu est moche (on peut le dire) mais pas vraiment. A vous de voir. Pour ma part, je ne le trouve pas si moche que √ßa mais rappelons que c'est encore une version ALPHA. Une fois dans la partie, tout vous est expliqu√© (ou presque). Vous √™tes constament sur votre garde essayant de ne pas rencontrer ces salet√©s de chasseur qui vous veulent au mur de leur salon. Le jeu est tr√®s prenant et l'adr√©naline monte une fois rep√©r√©.

Malgr√© que le jeu soit encore en ALPHA, il vaut le coup quand il passe sous la barre des 10‚Ç¨. 20‚Ç¨ pour une version ALPHA, c'est un peut ch√®re pay√© mais du contenu est constament mis √† jour.

The maps are very detailed and robust; when you first start a ""world"" it is generated and saved, which can take a few minutes to build.  First impressions is it is a simple game but as it is a stealth / strategy game, a single game looks like it could take a very long time to complete if you stuck with stealth and assassination (~3-4 hours), or if you just want to tank and spank you can but there are no difficulty controls so you may die a lot and well, that also may take ~3-4 hours too!

The overall gameplay is also quite challenging in many senses - limited inventory so when you find an objective piece you usually won't have the space for it and have to decide to ditch items.  Easy enough, but, you also have to continue eating so that can be rough too.  There are two variables - Life and Vitality.  Eating restores Vitality, which decreases over time to 0.  Once at 0, then your Life begins to decrease over time to 0 in which you die.  This type of challenge is also what make this game very challenging even for simple concept.

Highly recommend and can't wait for it to be out of alpha release, but do know this is alpha - there are bugs and missing features.  For example I had t restart a few times in order to get resolution up to 1920x1080, when moving from one world to the other it locks up on the Loading Map screen and I have to CTRL+ALT+DEL to get out and start over.  No difficulty controls.  Small things like that and you will absolutely run into them, but considering the developer(s) are putting out patches every month and doing a great job (the best of any software development I've come across) with video updates, I can overlook this for now as an alpha and just restart the game.

Oh, and there are only two times you can save - when at the ""recall"" point, or when moving to another map, so be sure to save each and every time both for the alpha bugs but also well, you are almost guarantee to die a few times :)

And believe me, that was very VERY il-advised.


SIR, YOU ARE BEING HUNTED.

It's a stealth survival game and a pretty decent one at that. You are a poor sod of a.. Erm.. Scientist ? Who very unfortunately gets telly-ported to an alternate dimension of sorts.. Or something along those lines, you know its really hard to hear what the narrator says in the intro. As i was saying.... The poor sod of a scientist gets telly-ported to an alternate (And very British) dimension. Where Robots of the tweed wearing kind, hunt silly humens for sport. And here is where the game starts.


GAMEPLAY:

The gameplay element rolls around stealth about 80% of the time, the remaining 20% are centered on collecting food and SOMETIMES, and i really press SOMETIMES. Attacking a hunting robot, or their dogs. (mangy mutts..)

The main objective is to find and collect the pieces of the experiment that our unfortunate science fellow was working on and transport them to a circle of standing stones... for... I dont know, to finish the game i quess.

But anyway collecting food and certain items to distract the robots are usually found in houses and shanties in the wilderness.  Rarely you will find a firearm, which makes fighting those tweed wearing, posh, pipe smoking metalheads alot easier. Unfortunately it also causes a lot of noise and usually alerts every single hunting-party on the whole bloody island...

Anyway for those, trigger-happy, no sense of self preservation types. This game is not for you, since you die. Very very VERY fast. 


GRAPHICS:

Not much to say really, i'm not the best person to evaluate the graphical-fidelity of something. But there were a few places where the graphics weren't quite up to snuff... But if you keep in mind that this is still in early access, that is rather easy to forgive. But not forever....


SOUND:

Ambient sounds, ""Bleep-Bloop"" Bots and the standart gunsounds. you really cant hear the robots coming easily, which caused me some cheap deaths... 

*Needs some work.


CONCLUSION:

Well, i'm not going to say that this is the best stealth-game ever. It has enough small quirks to prevent that.. However it has enough to merit a play, but yet again it beinng a stealth-survival game. It really does not sound that.. ""Appetizing"" to some.
 
So for those who love survival games, i could recommend this rather easily, although with the small issues within it. I could also recommend this for stealth fans, but rather carefully explaining it first...

A solid 7/10.

Its decent in what it does, but as always with everything in an early state, it doesn't do it perfectly.
But i still believe this has the material to come a good game, when it is fully ready.",1386443436,1386443436,True,1,0,0.502262473106384277,0,True,False,False,False,,,

___________________________________________________________

Sir, You're Being Hunted is my personal favourite Early Access.

For being fairly entertained by stealth-based games, and devoted admirer of the british culture and folklore (I also like to live dangerously), I couldn't ignore this title!

In [i]Sir, You're Being Hunted[/i], you find yourself teleported on a island after a mysterious experiment went wrong.
Your goal is to collect all the lost fragments of the device that had been scattered around a procedurally-generated archipelago made of 5 distinct islands with a different setting (countryside, forest...) But beware! As you progress, you become hunted by robots with high-hats and traditionnal tweeds. And they love to practice that noble sport that is manhunting. Being careful and methodical is required : the ennemies will grow in number, and they will become tougher as you gather the fragments.

Although it may still be an alpha version, the game in its current state provides more than a decent, enjoyable content so far; and there is even more to discover in the future (new island types, new robots, multiplayer...).

[i]Sir, You Are Being Hunted[/i] has a lot of potential, and already offers a difficult challenge. What a feeling when you beat the game!

Undoubtedly a must-have for all stealth lovers!",1385666602,1675793074,True,12,0,0.622664391994476318,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's stealth mechanics are lacking some depth, and in general,
your objectives lack much meaning, you kind of just go to
where the game pushes you. I found myself sprinting past
enemies instead of sneaking around them with barely any
repercussions, simply running past their shots as if it were 
nothing.

This may be an issue with me or my attitude towards the game,
but this game isn't really a good example of an early access
release in that i have little to no reason to want to return to it.
The point of Early-Access is to create an atmosphere and a bit 
of hype for a game that would otherwise go un-noticed upon
release, but i found myself telling friends not to buy the game
as apposed to telling them to, or even describing its better
qaulities.


The way I see it, there are only two solutions.

Your goal is to survive long enough to gather all twenty-five of the pieces of that mechanical device, in the hopes that completing it will allow you to escape the islands.

Now, you might be thinking to yourself ""You keep on hinting at some danger and survival elements in the game. What exactly is threatening your life and preventing you from just gathering all the parts or deciding instead to live out your life on the islands?"" The answer to that question, simply put, is: British Robots.

No jokes, no puns, no witty humor (which is normal from me). I honestly mean British robots. Upon your arrival to the islands, the robot denizens will do their damnedest to search you out and kill you for sport. These guys mean business. They've got shotguns and rifles, as well as robotic dogs, hot air balloons with spotlights, and many other things at their disposal that they will use to get you and mount you as a trophy on their wall. You don't want that. Being a wall trophy sucks. Trust me.

This map is randomly generated each time, with resources distributed randomly throughout. There are food items (because yes, you do need to eat), distractions you can use, useful tools, and the occasional weapon that you will thank whatever you worship for. As you find more parts, the robots try harder and harder to end your puny organic existence. Have fun trying to survive. I know I have, and I completely recommend that you at least give this game a try to see if it's for you.

The scavenging system is alright, and the cooking function is a good idea as well. The enemies are varied and intresting, and for such a simple engine as Unity, they are actually quite intelligent.

The protagonist, who you are in control of, is an exceptionally well-crafted piece manmanship that none other can compare. A true man who, in the face of adversity and robots with guns and annoying bleepbloop noises, never forgets his heritage. He is a gentleman. So he scrounges through peoples' houses to find hisself some tea and crampets, so he can shove them down his crumpethole like a true gentleman would. 
This determination to remain a gentlemansir even on a godforsaken island filled with angry native robots that say stupid vaguely aristocratic things to each other is an unparalleled look at the human condition at its very finest, the unbudging will to remain true to ourselves. I view this game as a psychological critique on mankind, and a well-made one at that. 
Marmalade aside, this game is bloody hard and I've eaten more bullets than I have consumed bottles of whiskey and sherry combined. And let me tell you, I've seen this guy's drunken stumbling many times already. True story, alcohol makes you high, yay for sir. 
This game, if I were to compare it to other games, is like pokemon. You creep around through tall grass, praying that nothing attacks you. When they do, you run away and hide to the best of your abilities, which isn't very impressive. 
Later you supposedly get weapons, but since I'm both a gentleman and really bad at this game, I haven't found any yet. Instead, I found some of the objectives. Device parts.
Device parts, when taken to the magical stonehenge in the middle of the island, will let you make a device that does something probably helpful like making you the winner.

I don't usually write reviews of games, but I felt compelled to write this in response to some of the fair yet slightly misleading user reviews I see on the front page.

** THE PROBLEM WITH USER REVIEWS **

Firstly, I don't like steam's user review system. I have no idea how to fix it either. The problem is apparent with games like this, which have some legit criticisms from some gamers, but others would find it immensely enjoyable. The button that ""upvotes"" reviews is labelled ""helpful"", but I do believe that a bad review can be helpful without my holding the same opinion. On top of that, it seems that people with a lot of review ""helpfuls"" have a large group of friends or are in guilds, etc. I am not criticizing anyone...just a flawed system that might lead people away from a niche game that many would enjoy.

** GAMEPLAY **

In fiction, there is a thing called a trope. A trope is a often used device, such as a fallen hero or a damsel in distress. These things can be over used, and genre fiction has a habit of creating whole works based on them. The point of a trope is to use something people are comfortable with so that they can spend their efforts enjoying the important bits...like characterization, or sometimes a fresh look at an old trope. Tropes are a creators shorthand because wholly new things are dense and difficult. The greatest works of literature and film use tropes, some creating new tropes, so that they aren't over long and dull.

The gameplay in this game is the trope. It is resource management, fetch quests and stealth. While the game is not quite a survival horror game, it uses the same limitations for an effect that I will get into in the next section. There are games which expand what a game can do...some successful, some not. This is not one of those games, nor does it try to be. You will understand what is expected from you early on and you will be doing it a lot. I would like to point out that the combat in this game can be easy for some, but I would contend that this game is not about hammering through with a weapon and those people who do are missing the point.

** MOOD **

This is where this game shines. Back in the 1960's, some folks at a small British movie company decided to remake an old classic film, Dracula. By that time everyone had seen the original Bela Lugosi film, so really what is the point in remaking a film when everyone already knows the plot? The answer is mood. Hammer films are not gory in the way contemporary films are, they are not jump scary, they ooze creepy. There is something of the molester in Cristopher Lee's performance in Dracula: Prince of Darkness, something that is in the original text, but sadly missing in Bela Lugosi's self-indulgent performance. And yet, Hammer films always have a wit. It is a mood that had never been reproduced in gaming...until now.

I roleplay this game. What I mean is that it might be possible to manhandle the robots, but I refuse to try because I let the mood sink in. I am more quick to run from the dogs than wisely set a trap for them. Not because I am a bad gamer, but because I let myself get into the environment. In sucking at this game I heighten my enjoyment of it. Winning is not the point of a game like this, experiencing it is. Ultimately, Dracula gets a stake in the heart, the end. This could have happened on page one, but it didn't.

** STORY **

There isn't one, and thank god for that. I am so sick of game makers thinking they are novelists because they largely suck at it. With some exceptions, almost all being in the adventure game category (I hated Bioshock Infinite,) good stories in games are second rate rehashes of better novels or movies. If I want character development or a solid plot I will read a book. If you don't read books and need videogames to get some narrative, well then please don't breed.

That isn't to say there isn't a narrative. There is, but it is one that I felt I was creating myself. Gone are the overwrought cgi cutscenes. Gone are the ""easter egg hunt"" notes on why we are here. What you have is a series of islands, some evil robots, and an attempt at surviving impossible odds.

** CONCLUSION **

This game isn't for everyone. Anyone who reads the negative reviews should take them to heart. But I am aware that people will see the number of ""helpfuls"" and think that is a vindication of their opinion, rather than what it says...it is helpful. I greatly enjoyed this game for the mood and emotive character of the world and level design. I had no problem jumping through the fake hoops required to spend some time within. But fake hoops they are. If you want an original experience, a successful experiment, check this one out.",1379990883,1407256950,True,13,0,0.653819918632507324,2,True,False,False,False,,,

""Sir, you are being hunted"" is a game where a sir or madam(you have an option to change how the game adresses you right in the main menu) got stuck in a world/dimension full of robotic ""Ye old hunting British"" gentlemen that, as you could guess by now, are hunting you. You are given the mission to survive and find parts of a machine that will send you back home, which sadly are scattered across the entire arcipelago(5 Islands in total, which have different biomes by your choise).
Stealthing in this game really gives you a suspence feel, the damn beeping noises and sadistic laughs and comments that the robot chaps make gives a nice tension while you are trying to stealth the hell out of there. I can happily say that the AI is well done, I won't spoil much here, the the variety of enemies is well done and original.
You can loot various houses for food(you need to eat also in order to survive), traps, tools and if you are really lucky, you might find a gun, changing the ties of who is the hunter and who is being hunted. You can hunt small game and cook them to replendish your hunger, but houses seem a better source of food.

There's lots of promise in this game. It is playable in its present state (August 2013) but clearly there is refinement to come.

I am generally not a fan of playing games in an early access state. I will withhold a proper recommendation until a later date. But as it stands, it‚Äôs interesting. I had no game crashes.

This game is a survival fps, a mix of STALKER and Don't Starve. The genre it self is already my GOTY. I am recommending this as of Aug 22, 2013. Its currently in alpha so don't say I didn't warn you.

You are a human. You are stuck in this dark/grim looking world with robots hunting you (you are an alien to them).  Your mission is to collect pieces of these magic rocks to power up this mechine that takes you back home. Along the way, you must stay alive and don't starve. You must search houses or robots you killed for supplies to stay alive till get back to the real world.

Gameplay: Its an FPS; find gun, shoot robots, don't starve, SURVIVE. You start out with nothing and you need to search for your 1st weapon. Weapons ranges from currently that I see in game are, axes, bear traps, revolver, 2 barrel shotty and a hunting rifle. Guns seems inaccurate so you do need to conserve ammo ALOT. Robots consists or dogs, normal huntsman in various cloths (seen in title art), fat town mayor guy and a flying ballonist spotter with floodlights that alarm nearby robots. To stay healthy you need to eat things, some things are bad for you like rotten food but you can cook some game. Currently you can't hunt game yourself so you have to find them in houses/robots and cook them at bonfire. Stealth is a BIG part of your survival. You are not a bullet sponge and you will be killed because currently it feels like the robots have aim/wall hacks. But you do regen health as long as you're not starving. Inventory management is also a big part of your survival. Its a tetris based bag and you have limited space where you can store things. You have to choose weather to pick up food vs ammo vs gun vs space to pick up those magic rock fragments to stay alive in the world. Also there is no storage chests so you have to be a hobo and scavage things or store them in nearby houses and hope you know where to refind it.

For comment on art style of this game just youtube, I can't really describe it to you. Its not realistic, its kind of a grim/dark cartoony thing but its VERY fitting to what they have going on.

Overall, I LOVE THE GAME and this can and will be my GOTY when it release. If you want to try it out BE WARNED: ITS IN ALPHA, updates will change gameplay. What I heard is dev is thinking about adding mulitplayer (so DayZ with robot as zombies with guns...HNNNNNNNNNNGGGG) and new content like trappers with traps that set up and wait for you to get caught and kill you.

TL;DR - FPS survival, great gameplay, my GOTY nomination, still in alpha so be warned. >If I didn't like it so much then why did I just write all this review? ITS A FUCKING GREAT GAME.
