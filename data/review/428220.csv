I really did. The art style's is adorable, the little spark you play as is just so cute, and I love that you move between the foreground and background layers in game. It was even made as a means of bringing awareness to Earth Hour, when everyone is supposed to turn off electronics for an hour to conserve energy or whatever. Everything about this game I should like is there. But there's a big reason I personally didn't enjoy this and I'll get into that after I explain what the game is about and like.

TurnOn is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you play as an alien entity made solely of electricity that can only move through electrical currents. You must use your innate electrical charge to turn on items to solve puzzles, collect energy, and try to otherwise help Electro City deal with a sudden blackout. Some levels are chase or fast paced platforming segments instead, and if you've ever played any of the minecart stages in Rare's Donkey Kong Country games, they feel a lot like that in a way mixed with a rhythm-based system. It's a nice idea, but maybe a bit much for this sort of game. Feels slightly tacked on but I get what they were going for - electricity moving to new places through high voltage wires, clever and fun.

The graphics are simple, but cute - I love how the little spark has its eyes move and squish as it moves along the wires, and I love the papery aesthetic done in 2.5D. It's really very cute and friendly. The music is also quite nice, if a bit generic in some spots and a bit unfitting in others. It's pretty clear that the creators just picked songs they thought fit, but it's a shame so many of them sound like Youtube Creator Studio stock music when it has a nice mix of styles otherwise. I feel that it should have stuck to either a gentle orchestral, jazz. or electroswing type feel, but instead it runs through many disparate styles and they just don't all work together even if they're all pleasant to listen to.

Now for what I didn't like. First off, the controls. WASD/Arrows is perfect for this particular game because you only move in four directions anyway (up is also jump which makes sense here), but I often felt especially on faster paced or timed sections that jumping was much, much more difficult than it needed to be. It somehow was both too loose and too precise IMHO. For example, when trying to jump up I felt like I should have a bit more height as the spark's hitbox doesn't quite reach enough to cling to the next wire on some jumps. I'm not a physicist or electrician, but come on, you're sentient electricity - I know IRL that electricity can only easily jump smallish gaps, but electricity has a charge, and charges attract opposite charges, so shouldn't it be a lot easier to cling to charged items like wires? I know this is a game, but guys... really? It's frustrating to have a wire just out of reach, especially when the spark can make some jumps that would reasonably be several feet away, yet can't seem to jump up and grab a wire that is not even a foot above its ball-lightning body.

Second, the foreground and background do not always make clear what can and cannot be jumped to. I often found myself falling off wires because I thought I could make a jump to another FG or BG object, but turns out no, you can't do that. This seems to happen without any real rhyme or reason, making some puzzles more difficult than they needed to be. Under this point I'll mention an issue I had with the platforming in general: some parts are so pixel perfect you have to be at the absolute tippy top or you won't make it, and some moving platform puzzles are even harder than they should be because trying to control the jump midair feels loose. Especially when falling down, I found controlling the arc of the jump difficult and a little too floaty, which made some types of platforming difficult. Furthermore, when landing, the spark tends to slide forward, making it difficult to dodge things coming at you or not fall off the platform. It was clearly supposed to feel good to go fast, but I can't go fast when I'm worried about how the next jump is going to land and IF it's gonna land in some cases. Also, this is a bit nitpicky, but I have never met a single gamer that truly enjoyed a moving-wall segment. Call me nuts here, but I'm pretty sure that nobody actually likes these. I get that the final level was a throwback to older Nintendo platformers with the tower, but come on. Make the platforming tighter so we can move quicker, or at least give us a break. There's no reason for the checkpoint to give you mere seconds to start moving when the wall of death is an instant kill, and there's never, NEVER any reason for an instant kill wall to move in a cutscene, that's just cruel for the sake of cruel. I picked up this game to relax, not yell at my screen because I can't make it to the next platform in time because the insta kill wall is right on my butt.

Third, the glitches. So many, so often. None really game breaking, but still. Several times I ended up floating midair for no reason, but still able to move. Sometimes the music breaks on some of the rhythm-minecart type segments, and sometimes it will reset your electricity counter or start you back at the wrong checkpoint during them. Button inputs occasionally did not work when I clearly pressed them. Sometimes, collectibles will not be collected, even if you are sitting right on top of them. A few times, I was completely stuck on the scenery bouncing or unable to move, but it got better. Once, at the start of a level, I randomly couldn't move at all and had to restart the level over. I'd think this must be to do with the spark's hitbox possibly being too small, same as with some platforming issues, but still. Glitches, they are there. I know this was more of a game jam type game, but you'd think there would be some more polish before you put it on Steam, that's all...

All things considered, I'm not so sure that I can recommend paying full price for this. TurnOn has plenty to like, but I did not have that great a time with it personally. Maybe it's that it's too short for $15 - it took me all of five hours to beat it, most of which was spent being frustrated at having to do the same exact rhythm-based minecart style levels twenty times just to get an inch further along the wires. Maybe it's because the platforming was too artificially hard, or the puzzles too easy, IDK. I wanna like it so bad, I wanna recommend it, but I can't. I'd recommend if you want a better platformer with tighter controls, pick up Hollow Knight or Sundered; if you want a better puzzle platformer, pick up Incredipede or Mutant Blobs Attack. If you really do want this game, wait until it's on sale for about $10 or less.",1612420464,1612689731,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Однажды из космоса упала маленькая искорка. Да так упала, что обесточила весь город. Она встретила работника электростанции который решил помочь ей вернуть в город свет и радость :)

Искорка может бегать по проводам и перепрыгивать с одного на другой. Получается классический платфомер. Проходя мимо лампочек или щитков мы даём туда электричество и на улице появляется освещение и в домах появляется свет. Это и есть основная фишка игры. Очень доставляет, когда путешествуешь по пригороду или торговому центру, а вокруг загораются лампочки, витрины и свет в окнах такой разноцветный. Впечатления немного портит только последний эпизод на небоскрёбах. Там надо просто долго прыгать вверх. И никакого света.  Между эпизодами встречаются уровни гонки, где надо нестись по проводам под музыку и если делать всё во время, то получается не плохая мелодия.

А вот музыка просто отличная. Спокойные блюзовые мелодии мне очень понравились. А в гонках, наоборот, музыка быстрая, веселая и очень в тему.

Pretty good, especially considering how this game had a very small development team (something like 4 people only).

EDIT: (THIS GAME WAS MADE BY RUSSIANS, THEREFORE I CAN IN GOOD CONSCIENCE NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS GAME DUE TO THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE).


TurnOn is a platform game wherein you control a cute little electrical alien orb which jumps from powerline to powerline turning on various electrical appliances (usually lights and generators) to bring power back to a city which has gone dark due (I guess) to an electromagnetic pulse from a passing asteroid (I guess the same asteroid that brought you to the planet to begin with). Or perhaps you were created or otherwise drawn to the surface by some weird scientist guy. 

This game, which features no real dialog, is very light on explanation concerning exactly what is going on and why. The cut-scenes leave a lot of room for interpretation also. It is fun to jump around on powerlines and turn lights on as you go but there are several segments here and there (which act like boss levels of a sort) which can be frustrating and have a much higher difficulty than the rest of the game.

+Somewhat innovative and strange platform gameplay, forcing a two-dimensional control scheme into a quasi-three dimensional environment (sometimes you can jump to a distant powerline by simply jumping up or down from the line you are at, even if it is in the background or foreground). I’m really not sure how to describe it. Merely jumping up or down can, if there is a place to jump to, cause you to jump either into the foreground or into the distance.

+Your character really is amazingly adorable despite the fact that it is essentially a bolt of electricity with a face.

+Nice, artistic artistry and colorful lighting effects.

+This game is not necessarily simply a children’s game. Despite TurnOn’s generally high level of cuteness, there is a lot of urban decay depicted in this game including lots of empty beer bottles laying around, destroyed cars and some ghetto style street parties here and there. Poverty and some of its effects are prominently depicted along with some of the crime that same poverty creates. There is some social commentary hinted at in the inner city scenes this game shows you. This game takes place in a city and it does not shy away from how the city can be an ugly place to be forced to live in when you don’t have money and how that state of affairs can be even worse if there’s no electricity or other services.

+/-Controls are very responsive but I often wished that my character could jump just a little bit higher. Responds well with a keyboard but it’s best to be very proficient with a keyboard if you play this game on one like I did. A controller is NOT absolutely necessary however. 

+/-OK sound though the constant electrical zapping sounds could get irritating over time. The music is mostly mediocre but can be fairly good in places, especially during the nice ending level.

-Extremely uneven difficulty. Most levels are very easy but some levels are crazy hard and some of these happen fairly early in the game (like the one where you have to defeat the weird malfunctioning flying drone and the ones where you are forced to race along on long-distance power lines at breakneck speed) These frustrating areas sort of act as boss levels between the far better designed normal areas where you just have to solve some simple puzzles and light stuff up as you make your way from point A to point B. TurnOn can become fairly challenging and frustrating very quickly with little warning. New gameplay elements occasionally come into play with no introduction or explanation of those elements whatsoever. You simply have to adapt as you go along. To decrease frustration it’s probably best to play this game in short bursts rather than for hours on end.

-No character upgrades in this game. The abilities your character has at the start of the game are the same abilities your character has at the game’s end.

-Most menus are self-explanatory and simple but the status display which appears at the top left of the screen as you actually play is a bit strange and seems mostly irrelevant.

-Fairly short game which took me only 4 hours to adequately complete. Early levels will spam you with steam achievements.

-No good explanation as to why the majority of the city’s power grid is ultimately controlled by this one generator on top of the city’s tallest building. It felt as though more levels were planned but were never made.

-Highly linear game with no alternate endings or choices to make. No way to be an A-hole and turn everyone’s lights off instead. No replay value as a result.

-TurnOn sounds like it should be some sort of a hentai sex game but it isn’t.",1584579299,1703246665,False,0,0,0.545642316341400146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Графоуни[/b]. На скриншотах выглядит красивенько, на деле сильно напоминает трешовые игры нулевых. Плоско, пластилиново, быстро приедается. Комиксовые вставки сделаны очень небрежно. ОЧЕНЬ. Визуалы идут лесом.
[b]Сложность[/b] в игре ужасно несбалансирована: есть обычные чилл-уровни, которые можно исследовать без напряга, а есть раннеры, которые бесят. Сюжетка, кстати, очень короткая, и кроме нее контента нет. Такое ощущение, что с помощью ""сложных"" уровней игру хотели искусственно продлить. Хардкорщикам не зайдет, ибо скучно, желающих отдохнуть и расслабиться ждут неприятные сюрпризы, так что и те, и другие хмуро догоняют визуалов.
Отдельная боль - [b]звуковое сопровождение[/b]. Звуки кричащих/радующихся людей (стоковые, не иначе) раздражают даже если слышишь их однократно, так они еще и зациклены. В пресловутых раннерах музыка начинается с определенного момента после каждого фейла, и через некоторое время ее очень хочется выключить. Аудиалы присоединяются к процессии.
Вопросы экологии, упомянутые в описании, притянуты за уши. Игра вообще не дает понять, почему важно беречь электричество, и не отражает реальных проблем, которые может повлечь за собой относительно крупный сбой в питании. Собака напала на девочку в темном переулке, поэтому нужно сбросить гигантский хот-дог с вывески, чтобы ее отвлечь?.. Окей, это попытка в юмор, но все остальные ситуации столь же поверхностные, а мы только и делаем, что зажигаем фонарики для человечков, которые не вызывают ни малейшей симпатии.

Le jeu compte une trentaine de niveau avec parfois des niveaux de ""course-poursuite"" assez frustrants, je veux dire par-là qu'on passe d'un super jeu de ""plate-formes"" limite super zen, où l'on prends grand plaisir à diriger notre petite boule électrique à du presque ""die and retry"" ! Après ces niveaux là ne sont heureusement pas nombreux (4 ou ( il me semble) et si vous ne cherchez pas à avoir les 3 étoiles de fin de niveau vous les passerez quand même assez facilement après quelques essais, que cela ne vous freine pas si vous hésitez à acheter le jeu.
Je vous parlais du nombre de niveau, on pourrait croire qu'il y en a beaucoup mais ils ne sont pas très long et, une fois encore, si vous ne cherchez pas les 3 étoiles vous arriverez très vite à bout du titre. Pour les chasseurs de succès le jeu sera juste long comme il faut (comptez entre 5-7 heures je pense) pour le 100%.
A noter que les musiques collent très bien, assez calme dans les phases plate-formes et un peu plus stressantes dans les phases défilantes.
En tout cas j'ai passé un agréable moment sur ce titre que je ne connaissais pas, merci la mise en avant des titres en soldes de Steam.

Les + :

+ Le principe du jeu.
+ Facile à prendre en main.

It is very much its own thing and players should keep that in mind before getting started. In a loose sense, it is a platformer, but all the action takes place between power lines, and touching the ground forces you back to the most recent checkpoint. As a spark of energy, you go around the levels turning lights on and powering machinery in order to restore order to a city that has been plunged into darkness, and is suffering from all sorts of problems, from failed marriage proposals to all out riots and vandalism.

All of this takes place on a particularly charming world with a cartoon style to it, and it's quite enjoyable to watch the consequences of your actions unfolding as you help citizens go about their lives. Sounds good? Well, it is, only... perpective works quite strangely in this game. Your character has a set size that doesn't change no matter how deep into the environment you are. In this sense, to jump to a power line that is behind you, the character does not really change planes, but rather when you jump up, it gets snapped by the line farther behind and you are able to interact with it.

Now, sometimes the camera follows you in an appropriate manner, but at others it doesn't. It's kind of convoluted, but it works just fine. You shouldn't be discouraged to play it because of this, but like I said, do understand how quirky it is before getting into the game. I saw some complaints on reviews about there being many blind jumps, but I never really felt like there were more than a few of those, and I completed the game 100%, so take that with a grain of salt. A more valid complaint is about the autoscrolling levels, which are not that good, but they are very playable if you are not aiming to collect evevything; if you are... yeah, they kind of suck.

I like this game. I really do. It has charm out the yinny, an interesting concept, and alright level design. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but graphics are never my first concern. I like that the devs tried their best to not make this just a pretty but boring ol' collectathon.

So it's better than Poncho.  It has that going for it.

But what stops me from recommending this game is what stops me from recommending any game: lack of polish and lack of understanding the audience. 

The collectathon levels and the running levels do not mesh well for me. I like a challenge, but I would not have expected one from this game considering the first few levels are relaxed, enemy-less, Rube Goldberg-infused collectathons (which, if I have not made it clear already, I find to be charming and fun). But there it is; the first few levels are chill and great, but then the running levels kick in. While they aren't impassibly difficult, they, dare I say, ruin the momentum. They stick out and not in a pleasing way. Unless you enjoy being throttled about, they darn near ruin the experience. And they are fairly constant. 

Also, while I again praise the non-running level design and the Rube Goldberg-inspired themes, It's clear that not quite enough testing went into even the middle levels. Jumps that would have worked in previous levels clearly do not in later ones, and that is quite a shame; I want to see later levels, but I won't live in frustration. Maybe I'm just not that dedicated a gamer, but there are loads of other games to play that have good concept and design and actually WORK.

I don't expect miracles; I expect love. There was much apparent love put into this game, but, like a child that peaked at a middle school spelling bee, clearly disappointment set in early and didn't let go.",1532150815,1532150815,False,4,0,0.568893790245056152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Maceramız uzaydan gelen bir elektirik formundaki uzaylının şehre düşmesiyle tüm şehrin elektriklerinin kesilmesiyle başlar. Doktor Brainy adındaki bir bilim adamı bu uzaylıyı laboratuarda bulur. Ardından tüm elektriği onarmak için bu uzaylı elektrik akımı olarak elektrik telleri arasında gezinerek şehire elektriği tekrar kazandırmak ister. Bu esnada şehirde çıkan isyan ve karmaşaları önlemeye çalışır. Oyunun senaryosunu ben yaratıcı buldum. Bununla birlikte oyunun müzikleri kulağa hoş geliyor. Grafik ve kullanılan renk paletide göze hitap ediyor. Kısacası hikaye, müzik ve görsel sanat gayet başarılı. Karakter seslendirmeleri daha iyi olabilirdi. Bana bu anlamda yapmacıklık hissi verdi.

2 boyutlu platform oyununda perspektif özellik kullanılarak oyuna derinlik kazandırılmış. Oyunun birçok bölümü 3 boyutlu düşünmeye teşvik ediyor. Ancak bazı bölümlerde perspektif hatalarının olduğunu düşünüyorum. Bunların yanı sıra ufak tefek oyun hataları mevcut. Yinede oyunu fazla etkilemiyor. Kodlama kısmında ve bölüm tasarımlarında eksikliklerin olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Bağımsız yapım bir oyun olduğu için ve ekibin ilk oyunu olduğundan bu tarz şeyler göz ardı edilebilir (Yinede oyunu alacak arkadaşlar bu kısmı göz önünde bulundursun). Oyun kayıt noktaları ise biraz tuhaf. Eğer boşluğa düşlerseniz kayıt noktasına geri yolluyor ve topladığınız nesneleri tekrar toplamanıza gerek kalmıyor. Ancak oyunda bulunan 3 adet yanma hakkımızı harcadığımızda bölüm en başten başlayarak sıfırlanıyor. Bölümü bitirdiğimizde son olarak derecelendirme mevcut. Belli bir skora ulaştıysanız en yüksek seviyede geçmiş oluyorsunuz. Bölümü en baştan oynama seçeneğinide eklemişler.

Takie pytanie często muszą sobie zadawać aktywiści głoszący tezę, że za grami często kryje się przemoc w życiu rzeczywistym. Jest to temat na poważną rozmowę, ale nie przy tak barwnej i prostej platformówce jak TurnOn. 

Kilku programistów zakładając małe studyjko zwące się Brainy Studios pokazało, że jak się chce to oczywiście można. Powstanie gry towarzyszyło pewnej akcji, mianowicie ""godzinie dla Ziemi"" czy coś w tym stylu i miało zwrócić uwagę nam ludziom jak bardzo jesteśmy uzależnieni od elekrtyczności i chodziaż raz na dłuższą chwilę w wielu miejscach na globie wyłączyć wszelkie światło w geście pojednania dla matki Ziemi. Pomysł i cel bardzo zacny, ale z czym się je samą grę. 

Gdy pada światło w całym mieście pewien naukowiec wyrusza z latarką do generatora by sprawdzić co się stało i jak może temu zaradzić. Z mocy generatorów powstaje nasz uroczy, płaski(2D) protagonista, który jest iskierką. Zamiast standardowych plansz z ziemią i platformami mamy tu inny zabieg, bowiem będziemy się poruszać głównie po liniach wysokiego napięcia i innych kablach, ponownie dostarczając prąd do różnorakich punktów miasta.

Tutaj objawia się największy plus produkcji, mianowcie różnorodnośc lokacji. Iskierka pomoże masie ludzi czy to w odegnaniu psa i zaprowadzeniu dziecka do domu przez zapalanie lamp, czy nawet ułatwi zakochanym spotkanie się albo zaaranżuje nawet randkę odwiedzając przy tym takie lokacje jak posterunek policji, market, bibliotekę, park czy wieżowce. Napotkamy też pewne intensywniejsze akcje typu zatrzymanie pędzącego tramwaju czy wyłączenie szalejącego diabelskiego młyna. Na każdym z poziomów zbieramy niebieskie błyskawice i zapalamy rózne urządzenia. Towarzyszy temu wszystkiemu naprawdę niezła muzyka.

A skoro jesteśmy obok muzyki to warto też pochwalić grafikę. Mimo, że do nowych produkcji się  nie umywa, ba jest nawet mocno kanciasta, to i tak jak na indyka dzięki użyciu odpowiedniej gamy barw wygląda to sympatycznie. Sterowanie jest proste jak drut, choć pojawią się tu elementy ucieczki przed laserami i tam gra potrafi być nieco denerwująca, ale to nadal nie jest nic złego. 

To tyle z plusów. Jest też parę minusów. Drugie podejście do pewnych plansz aby je wymaksować potrafiło mnie zmęczyć dość mocno, a mowa tu o kilku poziomach z poruszaniem się po liniach wysokiego napięcia i robienia sobie z nich swoistej trasy zjazdowej. Przy całkiem fajnie rozwiązanych zagadkach przestrzennych(prawie zawsze chodzi o jakiś generator, przydałaby się większa róznorodnośc) te etapy wyglądają blado. Nawet końcowa walka z bosem jest bardzo szybko i łatwa. Zresztą końcowe etapy pokazują, że twórcy chyba zaczynali cierpieć na brak inwencji, gdyż etapy na biurowcach uważam za jedne z nudniejszych przy tym co było wcześniej. Wiąże się to z faktem, iż TurnOn jest krótką grą. Spokojnie da się ją zrobić w kilka godzin, ale może to i lepiej. Przynajmniej nie znudzi się tak szybko jak niektóre inne tytuły.

To by było na tyle z narzekania. Towarzystwo małej iskierki jest fajne, ale radzę kupić grę na promocji(jak ja). Dla tych, którzy maksują na 100 % gry to kilkadziesiąt szybko dostępnych osiągnięć. Dla reszty jako ciekawostka. Być może skłoni nawet do pewnych refleksji. 6+/10",1518387257,1518389604,True,4,0,0.572649598121643066,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i][h1]點亮城市中每一片黑暗的角落，替人們帶來光明與幸福！[/h1] [/i]

一顆來自外太空的小電球，墜入了一位科學家的實驗室，造成整座城市大停電，玩家將操作小電球，透過自身發電的能力，與科學家一同嘗試替城市恢復電力； 遊戲分為兩個模式，一般模式有簡單的探索與解謎，操作小電球抵達終點即可過關，數個一般模式後，會接一個跑酷模式，這個模式有非常好的配樂，但關卡的難度，讓人不敢恭維...

----------------------------------------------------------

[h1]遊戲特色[/h1]

[i]探索、解謎玩法[/i]

操作小電球遊走在電線、電燈、發電機...等物品上，來點亮燈光，為黑暗的人們帶來光亮。 遊戲中有一些解謎，多數都不難，場景設計很特別，分為多個層次，玩家可以向前或向後來移動，透過不同層面的移動，盡可能點亮這個區域來賺取分數，可以在過關時取得三顆燈泡評價（類似三星評價）。

[b]小電球不只帶來光明，也到處製造幸福～。[/b]

[h1]遊戲問題[/h1]

[i]跑酷關卡過於困難[/i]

跑酷關卡的配樂相當出色，但關卡設計過於刁鑽，全程幾乎沒有什麼容錯的空間，以一款休閒、探索為核心玩法的遊戲來說，玩家追求的就是輕鬆玩，結果塞進這樣一個要求反應、操作的跑酷玩法，和遊戲本身相當格格不入；而且難度會越來越難，後面兩個跑酷，我大概重試了20～30次以上，才通關...根本不奢望拿到三顆燈泡 Orz。

[b]當我遇到後面的跑酷關卡，這關難度就只是還好而以...[/b]
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1295594442

[h1]優點：[/h1]
[olist]
    [*] 漂亮的美術。
    [*] 出色的音樂，電車跑酷那關的「Run away」超好聽～
    [*] 不一樣的探索設計。
[/olist]

[h1]缺點：[/h1]
[olist]
    [*] 跑酷關卡的難度，嚴重破壞了遊戲體驗。
[/olist]

[h1]結論：看似輕鬆休閒，但其實一點都不休閒的小品。[/h1]

TurnOn 在多數的遊玩時間裡，玩起來很輕鬆、愜意，但只要一進入跑酷關卡，就需要打起12分精神，注意跑道變化，並且會不斷的重試、重試，再重試；此外遊戲的後期關卡，會突然變成有難度的動作遊戲，加入了限時、閃躲的元素。

而這幾點，都讓 TurnOn 不是一款單純的休閒遊戲，因此如果只想體驗輕鬆休閒的小品，個人會不建議你遊玩 TurnOn。

[h1]TurnOn评测[/h1]

大家好我是少年粥。
这款游戏在我关注到的时候已经进了包，制作精良，关卡丰富，音乐效果更是incredible。
但是我为什么要给一个差评？题目已经写了，这是一个被红色闪电毁掉的游戏。

[h1] 游戏特点[/h1]
玩家作为研究所点亮城市光明的电球儿，穿梭在电缆电线中。游戏最大的特点是忽略了真实空间中的前后距离感，可以从很远处高处的电缆上，跳到近处低处的电缆上，仅受重力限制。点亮灯的一路上，你会帮助到很多镇子里的人们，剧情有趣；可以点亮暗处的灯泡或是打开机器获得分数，收集感满满。

[h1] 游戏玩法[/h1]
操纵电球儿！让它到达断电镇子的每一处！

[h1] 游戏吐槽[/h1]
好了，那么说完了游戏的优点，就应该说一些吐槽了。
这是一个被红色闪电毁掉的游戏。
首先说明一下，游戏中的绿色代表电球生命，蓝色代表电和电线，而红色代表着电球失去生命。
大多数时候，红色在游戏中是不存在的。所以大多数时候，这个游戏内容丰富、有趣。
而最初红色闪电开始虐我，是在一次城际电缆穿梭之旅。
在你想要跳跃电缆之间的缝隙时，游戏的作者把一个红色闪电，正正正好好好放在你会落下的地方。
你们说可以靠技巧躲避，那么好，我为了过那一关，大概玩了一个多小时。
要知道如果你付出的努力，得不到价值实现，也就是过不了关，那种感受有多难受。
然而那一次我忍下来了，因为那一关的背景音乐特别好听！！！
接着，今天好不容易有时间重新玩一次turnon，刚玩了两关，又出现了一关，
红色闪电会限制我的行动时间，而我打一次到上面需要好几分钟，现在已经失败了十几次了。
忍无可忍我要来发泄我的情绪。
这么一个好游戏竟然因为这样的关卡安排而变得非常非常非常非常难过。
本来是不想给这个差评的，实在是忍无可忍。
看了一些评测，也不是我一个人觉得难。
这就是我给出差评的原因。

还有那个恶心死人的跑酷关卡，看其他人差评基本上都提到了这一点。重复的问题就拿最后一大关来说，就是爬楼，不停爬楼，明明一个楼，一关就能搞定的事，它给你设计几座楼，好几关。

- diversity of locations

MEH:
- some levels are somewhat repetitive - there is material for 25 levels and they made 32 levels
- sometimes the levels are too easy
- the only thing you control is movement (up, down, left, right), there are no action buttons whatsoever

CONS:
- the ""cut scene"" graphics are 2D drawings which are somewhat ugly

...is a puzzle platformer. As a little alien who crash-lands on Earth causing a blackout, you must run on the power lines to restore electricity to Electro City, helping people along the way.

[h1]⚙ [u]Game Description & Mechanics[/u] ⚙[/h1]
You go from one neighborhood to another, travelling on electrical wires and other conductive surfaces, and jumping from one to the other. You supply power to lights, generators and other electrical equipment by touching them. As you seek them out throughout each level, you also collect sparks of lightning bolts along the way.

There are also musical segments, where you travel on high-tension wires at high speed, jumping from one wire to another to avoid obstacles and pits, using the music and following its beat to time your jumps and drops.

Falling off wires will throw you back to your last save points to continue where you left off, while red sparks will kill you after a few hits. In some levels, red sparks corrupted some objects that will chase you around.

[h1]☺ [u]What I enjoyed[/u] ☺[/h1]
While the platforming is simple enough, and patience will be all you need to find every spark and secret passages before moving to the following levels, the musical segments are much harder, at least if you care about getting a 3-lamp score at each level.

A game probably built with a younger audience in mind, it is very colorful, almost whimsical, it's unlikely that you'll mind the low resolutions and very simple animations. Each level has a basic but implied story, from lighting the path home of a little girl, you helping to lovers meet halfway, or assisting the cops calm down a riot. The gorgeous sundown and charming music will appease to many.

[h1]☹ [u]What bothered me[/u] ☹[/h1]
Gameplay is tied, no matter how zoomed in or out the camera is. This means that jumping about an inch high ""on screen"" sometimes results in multiple yards leaps to a line in the foreground or background because the current camera angle shows it an inch away. This is a very unreliable, very inconsistent mechanic for a sidescrolling platformer.

The game is definitely way too easy at times, allowing unlimited retries. It's pretty easy to find all hidden sparks, so you probably won't be replaying it again to get a better score. But then come the music segments with a huge difficulty spike to the 3-lamp score, which means you might be playing over and over the same level until you get frustrated, or memorize the entire level.

[h1][b]My Verdict[/b]: ★★★☆☆ - [i]""It's up to you.""[/i][/h1]

This game has its charm, done by a tiny development team. While I wouldn't recommend it to hardcore gamers, [i]TurnOn[/i] is a nice little game for children or casual gamers, the only audience I will actually suggest this to.

What ensues is a grand adventure through the city witnessing the chaos that happens to the mundane when the lights go out. Every few levels tells a bit of story about what you have to do and who you're helping but story elements while touching at points are very light and non-consequential to gameplay. 

Gameplay itself is a mixture of casual platformer and runner type missions. Each self contained without overall impact on each other. Now I might be a bit of a sucker for the simple stuff but I found myself genuinely enjoying my time spent in this game. There is no hardcore challenge to be had. The visuals and music brings it all together to make the experience a solid, well done and not boring. This is something I'd play if I wanted a little fun but didn't want the monotony or hardcore challenge that came with other games of the genre.

The music in this game is beautiful, and is necessary considering there's no dialogue or text moving along the story but when I'm scaling the heights of a building and the piano concerto starts to pick up I understand the urgency and pressure behind my ascent. Or during the slightly more urgent runner levels the uptempo beat that gives you the sense of urgency. In all I would recommend this game for anyone wanting a casual time killer but come in with low expectations. It's not a revolutionary game but what it does it does it well.",1498355962,1498355962,True,8,0,0.614898622035980225,0,False,False,False,False,,,

La maggior parte dei livelli sono pura esplorazione, sottoforma di platform. Nonostante sembri un'accostamento particolare, i due generi sono fusi alla perfezione.
In questi livelli avrete diversi obiettivi, fermare rivolte, salvare persone... sempre saltando da un filo della corrente all'altro, attivando generatori, lampioni, insegne.
Tutto questo vi porta attraverso l'avventura di TurnOn (la sfera di energia), il cui obiettivo principale è quello di tornare a casa, sul suo pianeta.

Oltre ai livelli di esplorazione ci sono alcuni ""intermezzi"" musicali che trasformano il gioco in un ""runner ritmico"" nel quale dovrete solamente saltare o scendere dalle linee per arrivare alla fine del livello.

Inoltre ci sono due o tre ""livelli boss"" in cui dovrete, sempre con la stessa meccanica dei fili di corrente, sconfiggere certi nemici, colpendoli nei punti indicati mentre saltate di qua e di là.

[spoiler]L'avventura termina dopo aver riportato l'elettricità ovunque. Fatto ciò, lo scienziato coprotagonista, vi porterà all'ultimo livello, che in realtà non è altro che un ""livello bonus"" senza particolari difficoltà, nel quale finalmente partirete con un'astronave diretta nello spazio.[/spoiler]

Il gioco è di buonissima fattura [i](specie se consideriamo che è prodotto da un piccolo team indie di quattro persone!)[/i].
I livelli di esplorazione rasentano la perfezione. Bellissimo l'effetto ""2D/3D"" che crea profondità nei livelli d'esplorazione (in pratica, potete saltare e scendere su fili che si trovano in basso o in alto, anche se questi sono dal punto di vista del giocatore più vicino o più lontano).

I livelli runner sono un po' rivedibili. A volte le linee non sono così precise, inoltre non si capisce dove siano i checkpoint, per il resto nessun problema.

Gli ambienti sono fantastici e molto dettagliati e lo si capisce già dai primi livelli.
La colonna sonora è una delle migliori che abbia mai sentito. Non snoia, anzi, è godibilissima e azzeccatissima!

Achievement tutti assolutamente fattibili, unico problema, è capire a volte dove essi vadano fatti.

 #好評原聲帶 #紓壓 #冒險 #可愛 #色彩鮮豔

歷史最低價是80%off  79元 個人覺得很值得


一、故事背景

  「啪！」 整個世界突然斷電了，陷入一片黑暗與恐慌之中，發電廠發生意外之後

  只有唯一的火花倖存下來，就是科學家的小寵物(?) 電電(我自己取的XD)

  http://imgur.com/a/pzlrV
  科學家小心翼翼的把電電抱上去線路上面 但是不會被電到(?)

  唯一的星星之火，背負著要點亮整個城市的責任，讓市民們回到以前的生活


二、遊戲介面

  控制方面非常的簡單，只有方向鍵，藉由在各電線與電燈之間跳躍，解決市民們的問題

  路上會有三種顏色的閃電，藍色是分數，綠色是+1生命(生命最大為3)，紅色則是-1生命

  生命扣完會從頭開始

  目前沒有繁體中文，只有簡體，但劇情情上面，是用美式漫畫風格傳達

  所以沒有語言的問題

  http://imgur.com/a/mvPQ9
  等等要和導亂的空拍機大戰一場囉


三、遊戲特色

  1.關卡不難，死掉幾次一定會過關的

  2.關卡有兩種，故事解謎 & 跑酷， 在商店網站上面都可以看到

    我最喜歡的是跑酷的關卡，因為音樂很舒壓XD

    但如果讓 電電 跳躍的有節拍的話，會更好 (那樣的話不就是音樂遊戲嗎XD)

    https://youtu.be/mzHdIxlLfWw  (結果還是死一次了OTZ)



  3. 遊戲有點假3D設定，移動的時候前景跟後景捲動速度不同，我們的電電沒有

    所以可以從前景的電線很不科學的跳到後景的電線
    http://imgur.com/uJTsPMb

   個人覺得這設定蠻有趣的

四、心得

這是個適合在悠閒的下午時光遊玩的遊戲，遊戲時數大概3~4小時，重玩性不高

除非想解成就，如果可以的話希望他們增加跑酷關卡，一邊聽音樂一邊跑酷，

超愜意的。 79元我覺得是很值得的一款遊戲

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You play as an alien lifeform that needs to light up a dark town via puzzles. There aren’t any platforms per se, but you do travel through the power lines, transformers, etc. There’s a lot of exploration and trinkets to pick up in hidden areas as well. If you land on the ground, you will die and will start at a checkpoint. Losing lives in the middle of a level sends you back to the beginning.

There isn’t any dialogue. Instead, the story is purely visual and everything is told through what you see and what you don’t. The cutscenes resemble a graphic novel and you as the player can put the pieces together as the story unfolds.

The levels vary; some will be on-the-rails and you’ll be required to dodge enemies and obstacles as you’re auto-propelled and then there are the freeroam levels where you can freely move and explore at your leisure.

There are various things to collect ranging from lightning bolts to hidden objects found throughout the level. Collecting enough lightning bolts at the end of the level will grant you a better score. Turning on all the lights and hitting switch boxes are the key to getting a high score. Pay close attention, a lot of the utility poles have lamps that will give you points when you turn them on too.

The puzzles have you figuring out how to turn something on, helping someone get somewhere by lighting their way, or turning on a series of lights for someone that open up a new path for you to explore.

The end of each level has a scorecard and 3 lightbulbs. Light up all three when you get a higher score. The 3 buttons on the bottom are Replay, Map, and Next level. So, if you didn’t get all the bolts or didn’t light up all 3 lightbulbs, you can choose to go back through the level.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
I used an Xbox 360 controller for this, but you can also use a keyboard. Left/Right you can use the left thumbstick, on the keyboard it’s A or D. Jumping up is A or W on the keyboard and jumping Down is B or S on the keyboard. There will be moments where you need to time your jumps just right in order to get to certain areas or reach a secret collectible.

[h1]Graphics/Music[/h1]
The entire story is visual, so the visuals here are fantastic. The story cutscenes are told in sort of a graphic novel style panels. The music is pretty chill and reflect the mood or action in each level. All the sounds fit perfectly and don’t take you away from the experience.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
I highly recommend TurnOn, BUT I would wait until it’s on sale or found in a bundle. At it’s current price of $14.99, that’s a pretty steep price for about 4-5 hours of gameplay. Personally, I feel that this should be in the ballpark of around $5 for the limited amount of gameplay if you aren’t a completionist.

Overall, the visual story coupled with the intuitive gameplay where the entire level becomes your playing field makes for a very casual game. Having to light up the city becomes fun and a challenge where you’re curious as to what other secrets or lights you can turn on to rack up the highest score. TurnOn by Brainy Studios is in the Steam store, link in the description.

- Der nächste Punkt wäre das es in manch einem [b]Level stellen[/b] gibt [b]wo man nicht[/b] ohne Internet oder langer suche [b]weiter

混亂的社會、失色的約會、孤單、寂寞、害怕。

於是從發電機開始，路燈一盞一盞被點亮。
守秩序的市民、甜蜜的戀愛、家的溫暖與安全感。

每一盞燈都再次被開啟，世界又重見了光亮。
但人們卻又熄滅了燈，只為了送走最後一束火花。

劇情雖稍短，但內容很溫馨，而最後一幕有被感動到。[/spoiler]

[h1]畫面[/h1]
本作在場景細節的製作非常細膩(例如: 看板廣告、街景、牆壁、告示牌)，讓遊戲畫面即便是Q版玩具風格，卻仍然具有真實感。
在一些火光特效與點亮燈光的動畫做得很舒服流暢，從選單畫面就可以看出精細程度與其畫風的風格特色。

[h1]音樂[/h1]
本作的音樂除了對於影響氣氛之外，有時甚至可以搭配遊戲的節奏來遊玩。
因為多屬抒情的鋼琴演奏類，我非常意外本作竟然沒有出原聲帶，因為每一首的旋律都相當優美、餘音繞樑。
音樂節奏的快慢抓得非常適當，伴隨著進行中的遊戲，使遊玩之餘更添一種悠閒的感覺。

[h1]操作[/h1]
操作簡單，只需要使用鍵盤方向鍵即可。
不同的地圖有時會搭配劇情與音樂，使操作的感覺忽快忽慢，而不只是單一的速度與反應。

[h1]遊戲性[/h1]
雖然在各項表現都有優秀之處，但是遊戲性就真的相當普通。
真要講，也只能說「就是那樣」。

遊戲大致上可以分成兩種玩法:
配合劇情完成任務、配合音樂與反應結合

雖然說遊戲性相當普通，但是需要配合音樂節奏來進行的關卡讓我很喜歡。
本作還有一項比較特別的視覺錯覺玩法，角色可以在看似接近卻遙遠的兩條電線，透過視覺錯覺的方式進行移動，讓原本必須走一大段路才能到的地點瞬間抵達，這種特殊移動方式在一般動作遊戲中是比較少見的。

[h1]整體6/10[/h1]
綜觀來說，這是一款小品佳作，但是在遊戲方式的多樣性可以再更豐富一點，不然音樂優美、畫面舒服、卻只有普通的遊戲性，反而容易催眠玩家。

[h1]優點[/h1]
-利用畫面的景深，延伸出視覺錯覺的玩法相當特別
-音樂旋律不絕於耳

[h1]缺點[/h1]
-遊戲性稍微低了點

--------------------------------------------
[h1]簡評:[/h1]
如果只是無聊想玩玩什麼遊戲，可以試著考慮這款。但是劇情不長、遊戲性不高、難度也不高，雖然配合音樂節奏與錯覺的遊戲方式很特別，但也「就是那樣」，而且有些關卡帶給我的樂趣不高，使我一度受到催眠。[/b]

It has a nice art style and the idea of repowering the city by jumping from electrical platform to electrical platform and reaching collectibles and different goals seemed cool to me.  Especially the way the story is told appeals to me.  In one level you're powering homes to get the lights on in order to scare away burglars attempting to get inside.  In another level, you're bringing a man and a woman together for their date by turning on traffic lights to make it safe to cross streets, getting a water pump running to spray malicious thugs, and so on.  In this way, the game is great.  The leisurely way you roam the levels and interact with things to see the effect you have on them and watch a small story unfold - it's relaxing and fun.

And then there's the reason I give this game a thumbs down.  There are about 6 levels that are ""runner"" levels.  You are automatically moving forward along power lines and all you can do is jump up or down them.  These levels can be immensely frustrating depending on how you play them.  I, for instance, really want to get everything and achieve a high score.  To do that, you need to get almost every collectible in the stage.  Make mistakes, and you get to start the level over - the checkpoints are few and far between.  Imagine playing DDR and you make three mistakes and it automatically starts you off at the beginning of the song again.  The music in this game is nice, but you start to hate it when you hear it over and over again fifty times.  

Of course, you don't have to try to collect everything and get a high score.  You can just run through these levels casually.  However, if you're doing that, they're too easy and there's not much to do.  You press W a few times, you press S a few times and you're done.  Unlike the normal levels, there's no story, no exploration in these levels.  If you're not trying to collect everything, these levels serve no purpose.  And if you are collecting everything, they're pure frustration.  The camera is way too zoomed in, you can't see far enough ahead of you and often cannot react to things immediately enough to accomplish anything.  I don't feel the controls are as responsive as I'd like, either, though this may just be my perception - I press W at times and it doesn't jump.  The level design of these runner levels have caused the community as a whole to just exploit them.  If you've reached a checkpoint, your collectibles are saved if you die from falling, so you keep dying on purpose over and over again to collect as many as you can manage before completing the level.  This just proves bad level design.  I feel they were only added to give the game a false sense of challenge.  They don't seem to fit the overall mood of the rest of the game - one of exploration and interaction within a beautiful world.

With the runner levels, I must give this game a thumbs down.  They are either too hard or too easy, depending on your playstyle, and simply don't fit with the rest of the narrative or gameplay.  Otherwise, this game would get a thumbs up.  Regardless, it's a worthy game to play casually if you can get it really cheap on sale.

DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.

TurnOn is a colourful little side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you play as some sort of alien ball of electricity. Your job is to return light to a city that has plunged into darkness by repairing wires, turning on switches and completing circuits that restore electricity to the town. You work along side a scientist who sort of moves along each level with you. Together you overcome obstacles and puzzles in order to save the city from it's blackout. 

--------

[b] Graphics: 7 / 10 [/b]

The graphic assets of the game are quite lovely. Each stage is presented differently with some great animation and lighting effects. It's a very colourful game despite the basis of the game being about lighting up a darkened area. The art-style is very cartoon-y but works well with the theme of the game. The game runs fine on any low to mid-tier setup.

--------

[b] Sound: 7 / 10 [/b]

The soundtrack of the game is also very well done. The game's music sets a nice tone for each of it's stages while at the same time following the game's motif. The other sound assets of the game are pretty standard, though they do get the job done. 

--------

[b] Mechanics: 6 / 10 [/b]

The game has very solid mechanics, and plays how a puzzle platformer is expected too. You move your character around with the WASD keys and can jump using the space bar. Your goal is to traverse through the wires, hitting switches to turn the power back on, and return electricity to certain areas.

There will be puzzles in your way such as; which power boxes to activate and in which order, which wires to jump and travel on or which direction to move in. It is not very difficult, although the obstacles do become progressively more challenging as you continue to play. 

You more or less only die in the game if you make a blind jump off screen into the wrong area, which can be a problem as there are certain points within the game where you do need to make blind jumps. 

--------

[b] Final Personal Remarks: [/b] 

The game is really cute and colourful. It's something I can see people playing when they want to take a break from playing more intense games. It's not incredibly difficult either. It's more of a highly stylized maze. You can see where you need to go during each stage, and if you get stuck, a bit of trial and error will usually overcome the challenge. I do think the game is enjoyable, and there might be some more value to the game for those who enjoy speed running. 

Thanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.

这是个带点解谜要素的平台游戏，顽皮弹借由电线穿梭于城市的不同区域，启动发电机、路灯和电闸，一路上经过住宅区、学校、公园、商业区，最后将整座城市点亮。玩法挺简单，大部分关卡都能轻松过关，不会有敌人追着你跑，大可以慢悠悠地跳来跳去，欣赏一下路途上的人间烟火。

虽然是平台游戏，但游戏是有景深的，顽皮弹可以在远景和近景间穿越，很有意思。

Мы будем в роли маленькой искорки, которая сможет зажечь весь город, оставшийся без электричества. Сам гемплей напоминает езду паровозика по рельсам, но разница в том, что передвигаться мы будем по проводам и постепенно помогать жителям города. Одна маленькая искорка зажжет весь город!))))

Особенно на уровнях, где нужно по проводам бежать. (ну или уровень с бешеным трамваем).
Сложность тут слишком завышена и управления этой самой сложностью в игре нет.
Что плохо: контрольных точек можно добавить как минимум в два раза больше. Например, на одном уровне-проводах есть два перехода от медленного темпа к быстрому - так и сделайте четыре контрольные точки! Почему если я погибаю на быстром темпе - мне приходится проходить медленный заново! 
Далее, жутко бесит что порой не видно что там дальше за экраном, в итоге совершаешь прыжок в никуда - и в итоге либо падаешь в пропасть либо натыкаешься на красную молнию (которой блин не было видно изначально). Я согласен, в игре должен быть вызов, трудности. Но это должно быть что-то, что человек видит и к чему может подготовиться. А так получается, что какая-то случайность постоянно мешает пройти уровень. Как решение - не нужно искру-ГГ помещать в середину! Она должна быть слева, чтобы больше игровой области было видно заранее. Какой блин толк в левой половине экрана? Это та область которую мы уже ""пробежали"" она нам нафиг не нужна. Поэтому я думаю, искра должна быть слева, а не в центре. Либо же нужно отдалить камеру, чтобы больше объектов входило в область видимости.
Плюс к этому проблема в том, что красных молний сильно больше чем зеленых. Соотношение 2 к 1му мне кажется более подходящим. 
И плюс к этому если я правильно понял - те молнии, на которые ты натыкаешься - больше не появляются до проигрыша. Таким образом, я скажем собрал все зеленые молнии на участке, потом случайно упал на землю, начинается этот участок по новой - но теперь есть только красные молнии и ни одной зеленой! Т.е. игра стала ещё сложнее. Это просто пи**ец. Думаю и зеленые и красные молнии нужно респаунить каждый раз при восстановлении игрока на карте.
Ещё порой кажется что управление подглючивает на последних участках подсвеченных линий проводов - не раз падал из-за этого, т.е. нажимал скажем прыжок (кнопка А на джойстике), а искра ""валилась"" вниз. Возможно стоит сделать эти линии чуть подлиньше (т.е. часть невидимой сделать). Чтобы при нажатии на кнопку в последний момент искра могла слегка по невидимой линии проехаться и совершить прыжок. - Так управление будет более отзывчивым, на мой взгляд. И не таким раздражающим.

Комиксовые вставки 
Честно. Выглядят очень аляповато и грязно, набросанными на скорую руку. Лучше было это дело хорошему художнику на аутсорс отдать. 

Ещё плохо (субъективно)
Раздражающие возгласы ""Wow! Hey!"" и странные танцы NPC. Лучше бы просто хлопали в ладоши. 
Уровень с колесом обозрения получился сложноватым. Можно было бы там сделать две контрольные точки - на каждый трансформатор по одной. И даже если красные молнии полностью нас убивают - мы начинаем с контрольной точки, а не сначала. (Либо должно появляться меню выбора, кототорое позволит выбрать чего мы хотим ""начать сначала"" или ""продолжить с контрольной точки"")

Что хорошо получилось и понравилось
Визуальный стиль, 3д модели, работа со светом, уровни хороши. Музыка тоже довольно классная (чем-то напомнила Ori and Blind forest)
Уровни довольно простые и я думаю отлично подойдут для детей.
Но вот эти уровни с проводами всё портят - не каждому хардкорному геймеру хватит терпения их пройти.
Таким образом получается ""и не вашим, и не нашим"". Не понятно, на какую аудиторию эта игра рассчитана.

p.s. для улучшения будущих игр предлагаю собирать некую статистику игровую - например конкретно на каких уровнях игроки сидят дольше всего, и даже в каком месте чаще всего проигрывают. Например можно уровни-провода взять за 100%, если часто игроки падают на 56% уровня - значит что-то тут не то. Стоит редизайн сделать возможно. Что-то не досмотрели.

This game tries to do too many things, and is consequently mediocre at everything it does. It's mostly a platformer with the twist that rather than a person jumping from platform to platform, you are a living electricity... thing... jumping from wire to wire. This is a good concept, poorly executed.

Rather than provide the player with a consistent view of the world with which they interact, the game instead uses perspective to decide where you will land from any given jump. So you can jump from foreground to background, so long as the wires line up right from player perspective.
Unfortunately, the player has no control over the camera, which is often oriented to funnel you through the path the designers laid out for you. What's more, the designers evidently aren't very experienced. Several times, the only way to proceed was to take a leap of faith, on the assumption that there would be a wire to catch me offscreen.

Often, though, the game will switch over to a sort of rhythm game wannabe, where you are moving forward, only able to jump up or down between wires. These segments are possibly the worst part of the game. They seem placed at ""climactic"" moments in the story structure (in so far as this game has a story).
Yet if you fall off the wires, you're placed back at the last checkpoint, which in these segments are unmarked and uncommon. The song also resets to match where in the level you were sent back to. It's not even a seamless transition. It's very abrupt, yet not fast.
Oh, and the speed at which you're moving can change without warning.

Most levels involve reaching the transformer at the end, with various collectibles and fuseboxes on the way. The fuseboxes, when touched, will activate something in the world, such as neon lights or a winch. Some levels require you to solve a ""puzzle"" in the world, such as guiding a couple in love to each other. In practice, this is just another collectible with cutscenes attached. Which wouldn't be a bad thing, but the art in the game is, again, mediocre.

The ""art"" in the game consists of the 3D environments which contain the wires you move through, and 2D drawn comic-style ""storytelling"" cutscenes. You would think the art in the cutscenes would be of better quality, but it's awful. And the 3D art is merely passable.

I haven't said all I can about this game. But by now I think you get the gist of it. My recommendation, if you're going to buy this game, is wait until it's on sale. like, 60% off at least.

Several levels had been designed to add some kind of 'challange', but they only add frustration instead.

A lot. I loved the art style a lot. The animations had a little bit of jank to them, but that just added to the charm for me. 

The gameplay held me back though. Making a fun platformer is about good level design, good camera control and the controls feeling right. TurnOn doesn't exceed at any of these and it ends up making the entire experience worse off for it. 

TurnOn has mostly okay level design except for a few areas where you have to do blind faith jumps because the only way to progress is to jump to an offscreen rope. The game often has no indicator of these so enjoy sometimes blindly jumping to your death. The camera control is bad... or rather there is no camera control. The camera is hard locked to your character so you can't just test to see if it's a blind faith jump and airstrafe back. Despite there being no punishment for jumping to your death, this does make this part of the game incredibly tedious, especially for the 4-5 second respawn animation and it teleporting you back to the last checkpoint. The gameplay works on a 2d plane, however there can be multiple 2d planes for you to jump between in a single level. This can work in the game and sometimes it's pretty novel, but for the most part you'll probably find it incredibly annoying. The camera will flick up and the scenery will move in an attempt to get you to hook onto the scene behind -- even if it isn't possible for you to successfully make the jump. This will make jumping for the collectibles annoying, but it will also make you try and jump up to an area that may not be accessible at all. 

As a causal platformer, these issues would be annoying, but just an annoyance on an otherwise enjoyable game, right? Well that's until you play the annoying auto run levels. These appear to be synced up to the music, but it's done very poorly. Instead enjoy a lot of trial and error and hearing the same part of the song as you unsuccessfully try and make your way through. At first it's a neat gimmick, but the game continues to throw them at you.

The exploration levels were definitely my favorites, though since I played the first 2/3 of the game three months ago I can't pick the best one.

The forced scrolling levels are frustrating as there seems to be one checkpoint in those at best, far into the level, and if you die due to too many hits (instead of just falling off the course) you go all the way back to the start instead of the checkpoint.  I always seemed to die just when the music was really kicking in...   Also, the second-to-last level is really luck-based to finish.  Hop around like mad and hope!

I played on a 360 controller and that worked well, not sure how their other schemes work out.  If you aren't sure about the two gameplay styles (and the forced scrolling sections seem more frequent the further you get in the game) watch the second video (the one in the middle), it shows both kind of levels and gives a good idea of how it feels.

$15 may be a bit high, but I caught it on sale.  Also, there are occasional bugs (I hit one on the Ferris Wheel level) where a level just won't complete.  Luckily (?) restarting the level worked out.

整个游戏可以看作是一个在3D世界里的2D平台跳跃游戏,操作很简单,只需要用方向键控制小电球穿梭在蓝色的电线之上就可以了,然后是关卡上分为通常关卡和强制卷轴关卡两种:

普通关卡的话,要说它是横版过关游戏,这个游戏几乎没什么操作性可言,如果说它是解谜游戏,但是也没有什么解谜成分,基本上只要全地图跑一遍,把能看到的开关都碰一遍,路过的灯和电力设备都顺手触发一下就可以了,所以说整个普通关卡的流程就是四处看看风景直到终点这种感觉,然而如果说前期这种休闲的游戏方式还可以让玩家享受一下把城市点亮带来的喜悦的话,后期大环境点灯的场景明显减少,而路程又变得无比的长,变成了枯燥的寻路游戏,惊喜越来越少,甚至终点的设计都变得不够明显,印象很深的就是后期某关走了漫长的一段路后看到一个开关本来只是想普通的碰一下,结果碰了才发现到了终点,而我前面路上还有没收集的东西导致2星评价需要重新开启这一关,真是想死的心都有了,着实令人失望

强制卷轴的关卡的话,玩到最初几个的时候还是很开心的,因为关卡被设计成和BGM相匹配,可以按节奏来玩,能感受到制作的用心,然而后期的关卡难度激增,基本变成了背板游戏,本身在普通关卡无所谓的略僵硬的操作手感在这里极大的破坏了游戏体验,经常死的莫名其妙让人怀疑是不是自己的键盘失灵,根本无心去欣赏因此如同卡带般的BGM,看了眼全球成就完成率确信不只我一个人被摩天轮折磨了很久,结论是几乎没有存档点的背板游戏就是反人类

顺便一提,这个游戏的死亡判定不是坠落到地上,坠落到地上只会让你回到存档点而已,之前触发的开关和收集到的电力都会保留,而如果触碰红电导致HP归零则是连存档点都救不了你,整关完全重新开始,有些时候感谢这个设计可以让你故意落地自杀来回到上一个存档点收集漏掉的电力,但是远没有被三红出局带来的恼火深,理由同上参见摩天轮

虽然基本通篇都在抱怨,不过说到底自己也是耐着性子一路玩下来全成就通关了,看到结局动画的时候还是稍微感动了一下,自己最初也是因为喜欢城市那种灯火通明的感觉才买的这个游戏,不得不说整个游戏的设计初衷还是很好的,只可惜玩起来内容上感觉还是欠缺了太多东西,总之还是推荐一下,毕竟前期的有几关真的是很美,爽了前面的,后面的(哔--)不吃也罢(......)",1474044503,1474220652,True,6,1,0.592384755611419678,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The product of a four-man team, Russian-based Brainy Studios, “TurnOn” features an electrical alien creature of the same name. Players control this creature as they journey to bring power back to a blackout city.

Other than having wires as platforms instead of rigid, straight planes, the game’s penchant for relaxing players lies behind its lack of dialogue and soothing soundtrack. Sound effects are limited, but for a good cause - they keep the experience free of distractions as much as possible. They easily blend in with the background, save for a few manufactured shrieks and grunts for the humans. Cutscenes are presented in a comic-book style, allowing for an easy-in-easy-out process while saving space in order to show the most number of panels.

The soundtrack, on the other hand, range from jazz-like tracks to easy-listen instrumentals. They match each stage perfectly - peaceful stages are accompanied by the soft, hushed tracks, while the slightly more stressful stages are more upbeat. Even the most touching cutscenes elicit just the right amount of emotion.

As for the gameplay itself, “TurnOn” boasts two kinds of platforming: free roam and autoscroller. Free roam stages usually require the player to fulfill some kind of small mission, ranging from helping light up the environment for a date to saving kids from a horribly failing ferris wheel. Collectibles come in the form of blue bolts and are half the requirement for getting a perfect rating for the stage. The other half involves giving power to lamps and air conditioning units strewn around the map. These two tasks provide points, which are tallied at the end of each stage and are assigned a one, two, or three light bulb rating.

One of the more interesting concepts of the free roam stages is the way the focus shifts from foreground to background as needed. Seemingly higher and unreachable wires are usually reached by a slight leap of faith and a sudden shift of focus planes. It’s a little scary at times, especially when making a significant jump from a high plane to low plane. It’s also slightly startling at the beginning, but throughout the game it becomes second nature.

The other kind of stages come in the form of autoscrolling levels. Given its nature, the path is more straightforward and there are only a set number of platforms to worry about. The goal is the same: collect all blue bolts and reach the end of the stage.

The main difference lies in the sudden difficulty spike. It is during these stages that players must summon some quick reactions in order to quickly change platforms. The speed is never the same - they slow down and speed up according to the accompanying soundtrack. Don’t be fooled, however. Even though the jumps seem like they are in tune with the soundtrack’s rhythm, they quickly go out of sync with the music. This makes for an awkward transition from enjoying the track to quickly ignoring it in order to keep going.

TurnOn is a charming platformer/runner where you play an alien ball of electricity who has crash landed in a city causing a blackout, and must then restore both the power and help the citizens out in the process. This was a mostly enjoyable experience that took me  4.8 hours to complete. There were a few parts of the game where I got stuck for a little while, which extended my time a bit. A player with solid platformer and runner skills could probably play through this in about 3 hours if they wanted.



[h1]Story[/h1]


The story in TurnOn is presented without any captions or voice work. It is a strictly visual experience from this standpoint. That said, it does in fact carry itself reasonably well in the story department. Basically, this is the tale of an alien who crash lands in a city (and fortunately in a scientists laboratory) causing a city wide blackout. The alien, who is represented as a ball of electricity, and who can only travel via electrical currents (such as power lines and such), and the scientist together attempt to restore power to the city before the people in the city destroy it via looting and other crime, accidents, and what have you. You, the alien, will also try to help people along the way, from helping out a couple on a romantic date to making it possible for a kid to finish his round of mini golf (and other stuff as well). Certainly the story in TurnOn is no magnum opus, but it serves well within the context of this platformer.


I give the story a 7 out of 10


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]



The gameplay in both a platformer and a runner is of paramount importance. Brainy Studios did a very nice job of creating a seamless experience in this regard. The controls in TurnOn were tight using a gamepad (I didnt try keyboard and mouse, so I have no opinion ion that manner of play for this game). I experienced zero crashes or stuttering. There is one amusing bug that will show up however. You can sometimes end up travelling along invisible power lines. This happened probably 8-10 times in my playthrough. Each time, this bug worked to my advantage as it made jumps between power lines a bit easier.

So, the actual gameplay itself:

The platforming was fairly basic overall. As mentioned before, in TurnOn, you travel via power lines and electrical currents. These are presented in a number of ways, from straight lines to mazing paths, with shifts in elevation, and moving platforms (such as window washing lifts, the scientists vehicle, forklifts, etc…). There will also be bridges that you need to power up to unlock, doorways that need to be unlocked, street lights that need to be turned on, and so on. Along the way, you collect currents of electricity (which basically take the place of the more familiar coins in platformers) which impact your ranking on each level and are attached to certain achievements. There are also red charges of electricity which damage you and green charges which heal that damage and basically give you up to 3 health points. If you run out of green energy, you will have to completely restart the level you are on.
The running sections I personally found to be a bit frustrating. Not because they werent done well. They were. I simply am not so good at that style of gameplay. However, despite my deficiency in this regard, I was still able to complete each level with some trial and error. You are still traveling across electrical lines, and so the presentation for the runner levels is basically like sheet music, with a few different levels and breaks on various ones causing you to have to stay on top of your game and change lines frequently. The pacing is tied to the music in the game, so the faster the tempo, the faster you are running.


You will also encounter enemies on a few levels in TurnOn, which are variations on red energy. They are fairly easy to avoid overall, but you will still die plenty of times on a few of those levels. There is also what is essentially a timed level towards the end. This was the level I had the most problems with overall. Again, it was done well, but I still died a lot trying to figure out and remember the patterns as I ascended a building trying to stay ahead of a line of red energy that inexorably advanced upon my little electrical alien.

The gameplay in TurnOn deserves an 8 out of 10.

 

[h1]Graphics[/h1]


The graphics in TurnOn were are presented in comic book fashion. The intros for each section are actual comic book frames which let you know what challenges you will face in the level to a certain extent and what your overall goals are. The actual game graphics are an extension of this comic book approach. They were especially well done in my opinion and the highlight of TurnOn for me. This was simply put a beautiful and lovingly crafted game from a graphics standpoint.

I think this game deserves a 9 out of 10 for this category. The graphics in TurnOn were almost done to perfection


[h1]Sound[/h1]


I have mixed feelings towards the audio in TurnOn. The music was the sort of stuff you would expect to hear in inspirational videos and commercials. Sort of uplifting, but also a bit sterile. The rest of the audio was simply sounds of electrical discharge, muttering speech done intentionally to further the voiceless story telling, and other ambient noises appropriate to the various backdrops. This was the low point of the game from my perspective

6 out of 10


[h1]Verdict[/h1]


Taken as a whole, TurnOn was a pleasant gaming experience. The setting and main character were charming. I was also impressed by the fact that this game was crafted by a four person team.

~~~~~~

This is incredible and you are not going believe it - Electro City power station has suffered a slight malfunction, causing the entire city to be blacked-out! Electro City without electricity – unbelievable! Thankfully, Professor Brain was on duty when the event occurred, and by fluke he found a Spark. Not the kind of light-bulb spark you get when you have a great idea,  but “Spark”, a courageous alien with plenty of zap who will help our professor to restore electricity to the city!

TurnOn is a platformer/adventure game where you play “Spark,” an alien who looks like an electric blue ball. The aim of the game is to travel throughout the city and restore power to houses and re-activate generators so the citizens can go about their lives as usual. 

“Spark” will travel the city jumping from wire to wire to turn on light poles, activate generators, restore electricity to houses and public places.  On the wires, you will notice electric icons. The blue ones are collectables and each time you pick one up, it will give you a point. You will need to accumulate as many as possible to successfully turn on three lights at the end of the level. If you go over the red electric icons, you will lose one of the three green electric icons which represent “Spark’s” lives. If you lose all of these, you will restart the level from scratch. The other way to die is if you miscalculate a jump and fall down on the concrete. However, you will not lose any points and you will restart from your last checkpoint, which is the last large generator you activated. This type of level is more or less like a typical platformer. The other type of level is the one where you move from one part of the city to another. Very similar, but it is faster and reminds me of a runner genre of game.  It will become harder when you will have to avoid obstacles and enemies within the levels.
 
If you enjoy collecting in-game achievements, TurnOn has plenty of them and they are quiet easy to gain.   
The 2.5D artwork is really good and I enjoyed the soundtrack. In terms of the controls, you can play with your mouse and keyboard, or with a gamepad.

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

-	Good artwork
-	Two types of levels
-	Controls are responsive
-	Good soundtrack
-	Achievements and trading cards

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~  
-	You might get frustrated in the runner levels.

Turn On the light of Electro city is a well-designed game and should see the light in your game library!

A high sense of player agency is accomplished through this game, in the way that the gamer is able to see solutions having an effect on the world created in the comic book narrative. Each problem solved gives a sense of satisfaction that translates into the visual story you are playing out. 

[b]Comic Book Narrative:[/b]
The graphics are incredibly well done, in a heavy battle for supremacy with the audio soundtrack. You begin each level with a set of comic strips that basically gives you an indication of what you are expected to ‘fix’ in that level. So, the game is heavy on story while using no language. I know, right. I wouldn’t have thought it could be done. But, there it is. This story is not dropped at any point, but plays out very dramatically in the conclusion. 

The art is old-school Americana, with poignant scenes described by level titles like, Beware of Dog, School Routine, Unusual Date, Mad Tram, The Smell of Trouble, Mass Rally, and Pursuit in the Sky. The helicopter battle level & the chopper high-wire level were two of my favorites. But, the Ferris Wheel was definitely spectacular as well. The level early on with the Drones was definitely a difficult level… probably the most difficult, since I was unsure of the requirements at first. So, the level difficulty doesn’t really increase or decrease, since each level is built on a different and unique concept. This provides a lot of variety, as well as visual appeal.

The art is, as I mentioned, a comic book style, but the level maps are built in a medium that looks like modeling clay, and is very pleasing to the eye. Lots of primary colors are used throughout, so the overall effect is definitely enjoyable and artistic. It makes it difficult to believe so much can be accomplished with a four man team. This high level art translates into some very nice profile backgrounds if you collect the cards. 

[b]Audio, Audio, Audio![/b] 
With a wide variety of music from old ragtime syncopated rhythms, to peaceful piano melodies; TurnOn is ear-candy. The only thing missing is some serious dlc for the soundtrack. I know I enjoy listening to game soundtracks, like some of the really great ones from Paradox games, while I’m doing other things. If TurnOn gets a soundtrack, I will definitely be adding that to my playlist on my Smartphone. 

The game fx is creative & diverse. The voice sounds of the npc’s can be annoying with repetition. But, I enjoyed the sound effects that came with the actions, as most of them were audible cues to success. 

I received a copy of the game free for review purposes, but that in no way affects my review since I only play games I would enjoy. I do think it would be worth the price, even if you don’t catch it on sale since the hours in-game are definitely worth the price. And, I will gladly buy any dlc that is later offered. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]
TurnOn is one of [i]those[/i] games that forces you out of the box of language by using just picture cue cards and visual, color, & light cues to guide you through the levels. Even when speech is used with the npc’s, it’s just mumble-jumble, intended only to convey the urgency of a cry for help from people who are suffering some mishap because the power is out. That does serve to direct you, since the levels are not laid out linearly. The gameplay itself is linear, as you must complete one level to proceed to the next. But, within a level, the end action may be anywhere. Also, many actions don’t open up until you’ve performed other actions. So, you will find yourself zipping back & forth, & around & about a level to complete all the tasks. 

The game can be broken into halves at about the point of the Ferris Wheel. In the 1st half, you are still learning new ‘tricks’ to battle your way through the game. But, in the 2nd half you find the intensity picks up into some really awesome speed platforming. In the very beginning levels I missed some things, simply because I didn’t understand the visual cue system. So, I’d say this is not a game you will only play through once. 

A number of the achievies are miss-able. I earned 80% on my first play-through, (which took me 12 hours) & will definitely be replaying some levels to find the others. Part of the reason for this is the fact that parts of each level are hidden, & activating the end-level action is not always obvious until you’ve done it. Then, you missed some things. Of course, you can choose to replay the level immediately if you want, but I think most of us want to get to the end first, regardless of what we missed. 

What I originally perceived as bugs turned out to be mistaken assumptions in the scoring system. Without saying more to prevent spoiling it for you, it’s definitely a unique system that encourages trial & error, as well as total mastery. The map is divided into areas, with levels within each area. It looks like there are 28 levels in all. Each area has about 3 levels that are the norm puzzle-type levels where you explore & trigger generators, looking for the end action. Then, each area ends with a high-wire speed level, where you basically play in side-scroller fashion by jumping across gaps in the power lines, trying to stay on the wires until you reach the end.  

You are scored in each level at the end by how many lamps light up on the scoreboard. There is no indication of what scores are needed to get ‘3 lamps.’ This needs to be added, along with level numbers on each scoreboard for those like me who want to look back at screenshots & compare results. 

[b]UPDATE: Actually, I realized after posting my review that you can see you many points are needed to score 3 lamps by looking at your achievements page. You can see, for example, that you have achievied 134 of 136 on a specific level, meaning you were short by 2. So, basically, the requirements vary by level.[/b]

[b]Controller or Keyboard?[/b] 
The controls are simple WASD & usually only 2 keys at a time are used. I preferred using the keyboard controls for accuracy & versatility for most puzzle levels. However, I found that using my Steam controller on the high-wire levels provided more speed. So, it looks like the type of game that if you really get into it like I did, then you will find yourself swapping back & forth on the controls.

The game is similar to Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack. If you enjoyed that, where you don’t see the whole level at once, but search high & low for bonus items, then this game is for you. However, TurnOn is not as difficult, & much more engaging to me, probably because of the art style & music, as well as the simpler gameplay.

[b]Pro’s:[/b]
* Unique levels designed & crafted individually
* Variety in game play
* Awesome music for each level!
* Eye-pleasing art with an engaging story

[b]Cons:[/b]
* No indication of how many points needed to score three lamps in a level 
* Individuality of levels tends to leave difficulty a bit unbalanced from start to finish

Почему бы не применить эту формулу к TurnOn. А что? Для этого есть все необходимое. Платформер с недвусмысленным названием: «Включай» отлично подходит чтобы скоротать вечерок другой. Может это и не правильно, но все ещё трудно поверить, что в России тоже могут быть хорошие игры. Вы не смотрите, что TurnOn это не AAA проект со всем необходимым реквизитом вроде графики, голлувидского сюжета, морем персонажей, а также… «Выключай» — это прорыв, независимый и мощный прорыв.

Тут очень к месту будет провести параллели с величайшим искусством — литературой. В те стародавние времена, пока вся Европа утопала в громоздких и монументальных трактатах посвященных классицизму на Руси после «смутных времен» давала свои первые ростки литература, который мы уже её знаем. Она постепенно порождала Ломоносова, Державина, Жуковского и Пушкина. Эти авторы творили не многотомные романы и повести, они создавали оды и стихи — творчество приятное слуху и взору. TurnOn это та самая ода, которая, во-первых, лишний раз напоминает нам, что история развивается по спирали, а во-вторых, говорит о том, что российский разработчик тоже может подходить к созданию игры с желанием создать что-то хорошее.

Стоит, конечно, оговориться, что сперва я был немного удивлен, так как в силу своей лени не прочитал толком о чем игра, а повелся на великолепные арты. Эта та самая стилистика, которая присутствует во многих инди играх, однако не везде это уместно, а где уместно — игра оказывается на деле невыносимой скукой. А ещё может оказаться что на деле мы имеем дело с пиксельным геймплеем. Но TurnOn не таков, он не стал втыкать предательский кинжал ни в спину, ни в лицо. Brainy Studio прекрасно поработали над графикой и это на том самом Unity, который то перехваливают, то жутко презирают. Все же в декорациях мрачного города, где шаг за шагом нам следует возвращать свет во всякий предмет источающий оный, приятно находится и колесить вправо и влево, вглубь и вниз по экрану в роли космического сгустка энергии. Это этакий русифицированный Южный Парк с приемлемой дозой гротеска и новых архитектурных находок, особенно в плане размещения линий электропередачи.

Зато сюжет, если не брать в расчет то, что мы играем комком энергии, вполне земной. После выключения света во всем городе начинается настоящие проблемы. Влюбленные не могут встретиться, рабочие работать, анархисты крушат все подряд, воры забирают все, что плохо лежит. Мы и наш помощник в лице ученого глава за главой вдыхаем в город новую жизнь. Если вы привыкли к размусоливанию повествования то тут я вас хочу огорчить. История подается в виде коротеньких комиксов, блобов и визуальных намеков прямо на экране. Этакий примитивизм, но хватает с головой.

Другое дело сам геймплей и разнообразие уровней. Сначала душная лаборатория, затем скромный пригород, дальше парк, дороги, городские площади и небоскребы. Каждый уровень имеет стандартную механику. Мы двигаемся только по проводам, можем прыгать с одного на другой, зажигаем свет везде, где только можем. В конце уровня подводим итог — количество очков и достижение за старательность и дотошность. И казалось только вы начинаете скучать нам подкидывают какую-нибудь интересную фишку — нестандартный босс, необычное задание и тому подобное и самое главное — музыкальная гонка!

Режим который меня влюбил в эту на вид простенькую и добрую игру — музыкальная гонка. Перед глазами пролетело детство, когда картинка скроллится вправо, играет отличная, то есть по-настоящему отличная, музыка и мы должны успеть собрать как можно больше жетончиков/кружков/монеток или молний, не напороться на красные, подлечиться зелеными и не угодить в пропасть. Вот казалось бы, это совсем не инновация, но так разбавляет игровой процесс и освежает, что переходя в новую главу начинаешь получать удовольствие по новой.

TurnOn заслуживает исключительно положительного отзыва и не из-за того, что это единственный достойный проект из России за последнее время (брать в расчет псевдо MMO с постсоветской тематикой не имеет смысла, совершенно другие форматы). Это настоящая капля таланта в море игрового мусора. Brainy Studio создали очень приятный проект. Несколько вечеров подряд я наслаждался каждой минутой проведенной в дебютном проекте небольшой команды разработчиков. Отдельное спасибо за музыкальное сопровождение.

Нет, это не сюжет очередной постапокалиптической картины, и в главной роли не спасатель всия мира Брюс Уженетотович Уиллис. Хотя определенные параллели провести безусловно можно. Некий уездный город, назовем его N, погрузился в сумрак. И наш протагонист, существо, скорее не земного происхождения, отправляется в путешествие, с родни ""Армагедонна"" Майкла Бэя, только в локальных масштабах. История чем то напомнила мне произведение Рэя Брэдбери «Урочный час», только герой там был, мягко сказать противоположной направленности. 
Переходя от сюжетной части к игровым элементам, нельзя не сказать, что это один из самых красивых платформеров в который я играл когда-либо. Графически выглядит просто отлично, модели, задники, прекрасная анимация, количество локаций тоже на уровне.
Звук подобран идеально под игровую составляющую, иногда даже прослеживаются в некоторой степени блюзовые мотивы, приправленные мелодичными сетами рояля.
Геймплейно всё приближено к эталонным показателям, нарастание сложности после знакомство с механикой, головоломки - всё на уровне. Можно играть как на клавиатуре, так и на геймпаде, но как по мне, второй вариант более предпочтителен.

The story is simple, the town fall to the dark, nowhere is an electric, your goal goes to the town and back a light back! The whole story telling completed without any words, just with visual effects, is unusual but looks good.

The game levels contain two type of games, one is a “runner”, where a little creature moving alone, your goal don’t fall down and collect a little electric. Second game type is a “platformer”, there your main goal is moving at lines and bring an electric in all thing what need it. At some places game need some thinking from you, but mostly here need only your skills. If you fall down, you will start a current level from last checkpoint, but all what you collected till this time stay at you. Also at some levels you will find something like “boss” fights.

By far the most beautiful and enjoyable platform game I ever played in years.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
TurnOn is a platform game on 3D full of puzzles and secrets, you are an alien power that literally runs by electrical wires. Has simple controls, making it a enjoyable game, you can jump from wire to wire and your main objective is to go through parts of the city by solving small puzzles and bring back the light. But I recommend you get light all that is in stage, this will give you a better score at the end. During the stages you will go through a mini-game a bit more challenging where you should go jumping from wire to wire avoiding falling to the ground. Game loadings are fast and has a awesome optimization.

[h1] Graphic [/h1]
Amazing, even it's not the latest generation, TurnOn has a unique graphic style, abusing of the lighting effects, is a pleasurable gameplay for hours. Detail that really impressed me was the cutscenes in comics style that appear in stages, have vibrant colors and a mild stroke.

[h1]Soundtrack [/h1]
Original, orchestrated and impressive. It molds to stage events.

[h1]Grade: 10/10[/h1]
TurnOn is a game to elapse the time and relax. Has easy puzzles and a perfect playability.

Man steuert so etwas wie eine Energiekugel und muss das Licht in Electro City wiederherstellen. Bewegen kann man sich auf Stomleitungen, zwischen welchen man hin und her hüpft und dabei Generatoren einschaltet, Strom in Form von Blitzsymbolen einsammelt, kleine Rätsel löst und so den Bewohnern hilft oder auch ab und zu Gegner besiegt.

[h1]Grafik:[/h1]
Grafisch ist das Spiel durchaus stimmig, durch die 3D-Perspektive (eigentlich 2,5D) ergeben sich sehr interessante Persektiven-Spielereien - man kann sich zwischen den ""Ebenen"" bewegen (ist schwierig zu erklären, dazu bitte einfach das Video am Ende anschauen). Die Story wird durch comicartige Zwischensequenzen erzählt (mit animierten Standbildern).

[h1]Sound:[/h1]
Die Musik passt wunderbar ins Spiel, ich habe glaub ich noch kein Musikstück ein zweites Mal gehört - die Palette reicht von sanften Klavierklängen bis hin zu treibenden Beats - je nach Level. Auch am Ingame-Sound gibts nichts zu meckern.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Ein Standard-Plattformer mit interessanten Ideen in der Perspektive und ein paar Rätsel-Einlagen zwischendurch. Es gibt auch immer wieder mal kurze Abschnitte, die eine Mischung aus Runner und Rockband sind. Man ""läuft"" automatisch auf den Stromlinien entlang, sammelt im Takt Blitze und versucht, Gefahren auszuweichen.
Sterben kann man in dem Spiel auch, indem man entweder runterfällt oder 3 Mal von etwas getroffen wird. Die Checkpoints sind allerdings so fair verteilt, dass dies grundsätzlich kein Problem darstellt - außerdem behält man alles bisher gesammelte.

[h1]Fazit:[/h1]
Ein wirklich schönes, rundes Plattformer-Spiel. Klar gibt es kleinere Bugs, aber der Gesamteindruck ist auf jeden Fall sehr positiv.

Ні це не симулятор знайомств як можна було б подумати з назви =) Насправді це симулятор електроенергії. В місті вимкнули електропостачання (звичайна справа, метеорит впав на електростанцію) тим самим створивши нас, щось типу частинку енергії, яка повертає її електропристроям та освітленню, цим ми саме і будемо займатись протягом гри.
Візуально гра доволі класна, приємний графічний стиль з хорошим освітленням вдало передають вечірнє місто без електроенергії. 
Музика в грі спокійна, приємна та вдало вписується. Також є рівні де навіть рухатись доводиться в такт до мелодії.
Це безумовно переваги гри.
З особливостей хочу відмітити, що у більшості рівнів прийдеться кружляти щоб знайти всі секрети і набрати максимум очків, добре це чи погано, кожному своє.
Також цікавим моментом який не зовсім добре працює є ""багаторівнева система"" тобто як і у звичайних платформерах ми маємо рівні вище та нижче між якими ми пересуваємось, але тут вони наче у трьох вимірах, тобто ми бачимо глибину картинки, але вона не впливає на наше пересування, і це заплутує, а часто і мішає пройти рівень, так як там де наче ми перестрибуємо, гра вирішує що насправді ні, а деколи навпаки потрібно падати у невідоме насмерть щоб знайти прихований шлях. Задумка звісно цікава, але виконання не найкраще нажаль.
А от з мінусів це стало керування, я грав на геймпаді і керування було не точним, часто затримки на дію приводили до падіння і т.п. Керування на клавіатурі трішки краще, але такі ігри на геймпаді граються частіше звісно.

При цьому всьому гра цікава, в грі доволі багато досягнень які не дадуть засумувати під час гри, а візуальна складова точно залишить декілька скріншотів на память.

[b]Uzun bir inceleme, özeti için son bölüme bakabilirsiniz.[/b]


Rus menşeili Brainy Studio tarafından geliştirilen TurnOn, iki buçuk boyutlu bir side-scrolling platform oyunu. Çizgi romanı andıran tasarımlarla harika bir sunum yapan oyunda ana karakterimiz TurnOn’u, mavi renklendirilmiş elektik kabloları üzerinde yönetiyoruz. Ekranın derin tarafta (X) gözüken kablolara da zıplayabilmemiz sayesinde bize iki boyuttan fazlasını sunan oyunda, bir kablodan diğerine zıplayarak ulaşmak istediğimiz nihai amaç, bizzat karakterimiz TurnOn’un da içinden çıktığı uzaylı bir objenin, güç santraline çarpmasından sonra karanlığa saplanan Electro City’ye elektriği geri getirmek. Uzaydan gelen bir elektrik kıvılcımı TurnOn ile, evlerden marketlere, lunaparklardan gökdelenlere şehirdeki her yere elektrik götürdüğümüz bu maceranın neler sunduğuna gelin birlikte bakalım.

Elektrik santraline çarptıktan sonra Profesör Brain tarafından keşfedilen ufak ışık hüzmemiz, dokunduğu her elektrikle çalışan objelere tekrar elektrik verebiliyor. Santralde başlayan maceramızda lambaları, klimaları ve ufak elektrik santrallerini yeniden çalıştırdıktan sonra şehrin farklı yerlerine gidip ev eşyalarını, tabelaları, trafik ışıklarını ve birçok farklı elektrik ile çalışan objeleri tekrar aktif duruma getiriyoruz. Oyunun ekserisini oluşturan bu tarz seviyeler kolay ve rahatlatıcı, bir o kadar da keyifli. Bu bölümlerde amacımız genellikle o bölgeye elektriği geri getirmek, ve bunu elektrik trafolarını kullanarak yapıyoruz.

Açıkçası doğrudan bu güç noktalarını bulup yeniden çalışmalarını sağlamak gayet kolay. Oyundaki keyifli deneyim de zaten bu bahsedilen temel görevi tamamlamaktan ziyade bölümlerin kıyısını kenarını bir güzel dolaşıp mavi elektrik işaretlerini toplamak. Tabi bunları yaparken de başlangıçta karanlıkta olan mekanlara elektriği, bir anlamda hayatı yeniden getirmenin güzelliği var ve TurnOn’un en iyi hissettiren yönü de bu. Köpekten korkan bir çocuğun yolunu aydınlatarak onu evine ulaştırmak, yarıda kesilmiş bir partiyi yeniden başlatmak veya romantik şekilde aşkını ifade etmeye çalışan bir adama yardım etmek. Hayatın içinden hissettiren bu ufak hikayeler kaliteli müziklerle birleştirildiğinde hoşnut bir oyun deneyimi sunuyor. Fakat her seviye bu şekilde basit ve keyifli bir deneyiminden oluşmuyor. Bazı rakipler veya daha zorlu durumlarla da karşılaşacağınız oyunda bazen tempo artıyor ve bu nadiren olumlu bir geri dönüş sunuyor. Hikayenin akışında bulunan aksiyon ve boss bölümleri genel tempoya iyi bir değişim sunsa da, ileride değineceğim müzikli bölümler benim için büyük bir eksi.

Oyunda bahsetmem gereken olumlu noktalardan diğer ikisi görseller ve müzik. Oyunun görselleri göze hoş geliyor ve bolca renkli. Çizgi roman çizimlerini andıran grafiklerin renk ve ışıkla uyumu çok başarılı. Seviyeden seviyeye değişen görsel sanat oyunun atmosferine harika oturuyor ve gerçekten çok tatlı bir görüntü sergiliyor. Arka plandaki karakterleri veya olayları izlemesi ve siz elektriği getirdikçe onların mutluluklarını görmek de benim için büyük artılardan. Oyunun yavaş temposu sayesinde bu görsel sanata bolca bakabiliyor ve takdir edebiliyorsunuz. Ayrıca müzikler de başarılı. Yavaş tempolu müziklerden aksiyon dolu olanlara kadar müzikler genellikle yerinde ve gayet kaliteli.

Gelgelelim oyunun olumsuz yönlerine… Oyunda bazı bölüm aralarında, bir paragraf öncesinde övgüyle bahsettiğim müziklerin tempolarına uyarlanarak yapılmış müzikli bölümler var. Bu bölümlere üst üste sıralanmış olan elektrik direklerinde başlıyoruz ve amacımız bu düz hatlar üzerinde düşmeden seviyeyi tamamlamak. Fakat çoğu oyun bölümünün huzurlu atmosferinin ve keyifli/basit oynanışının arasında bu bölümler ağzımıza zorla tıkılmış gibi hissettiriyor. Oyunun kontrolleri çok çabuk ve keskin değil ve bu hareketli müzik odaklı bölümlerde tempo arttıkça hız da arttığı için elektrik kıvılcımını yeterince iyi kontrol edemiyoruz ve çoğunlukla tellerden düşüp bölümlere yeniden başlıyoruz. Yine bu bölümlerde ileride ne olduğunu görmediğimiz için bolca deneme-yanılma yapmamız gerekiyor ve bu da daha fazla baştan başlama demek. Bu tarz bölümlerde normal bölümlerdeki gibi kayıt noktaları olmadığı için tüm sürece baştan başlamak gerçekten hayal kırıklığı yaşatıyor ve belli bir süre sonra oyuncuyu boğuyor. Tabi bu bölümlerin çoğunun hikayeden kopuk ve sırf tempo değişikliği için oyuna eklenmiş hissettirmesi de büyük bir etken.

Diğer birkaç eleştiriye gelecek olursak… Oyunun süresi ve yeniden oynanabilirliği bir soru işareti. Ortalama 4 saatte tamamlayacağınız oyun, bittikten sonra geri dönmenizi sağlayacak pek bir şey sunmuyor. Eğer casual oyunlara sevginiz fazlaca büyükse bu bir sorun olmayabilir, ama genel oyuncu kitlesi düşünüldüğünde 4-6 saatlik bir oyun süresi kısa ve farklı deneyimler olmaması sıkıntı verici. Bunun yanında bir diğer eksi de oyunun sesleri. Düşük kaliteli ve kulağı hoş gelmiyor. Daha önemli bir nokta da oyun sonlarına doğru uzayan ve anlamını, hikayelerini, kaybeden bölümler. Sonlara doğru bölümler bu ‘casual’ oyun için biraz olumsuz bir hal alıyor.

[h1]Özet ve Son Karar[/h1]
Rahatlatıcı ve keyifli bir deneyim sunan oyun, tatlı grafikleri ile de göze hoş görünüyor. Fakat oyunun genel çizgisinden uzak bazı bölümleri, nispeten kısa oyun süresi ve genel olarak daha iyi yapılabilir noktaları olması çok özgün veya aşmış bir yapım olmasının önüne geçiyor. Yine de uygun bir fiyattan alınıp kesinlikle hoşnut saatler geçirebilirsiniz.

Но об этом по порядку.

В результате аварии весь город остался без электричества. Но по какой-то случайности в лаборатории местного учёного, по совместительству электростанции, обрела жизнь маленькая искра, воплотившись в некоего духа электричества. Который в свою очередь живёт в проводах и способен делиться своей безграничной энергией со всеми подключенными приборами.
После этого мы покидаем лабораторию и при помощи того самого учёного возвращаем свет, а по совместительству и жизнь, во все районы города. Ведь что за жизнь без света? Электроприборы в домах не работают, светофоры останавливают движение. А сигнализация больше не помеха ворам и хулиганам. Так же, периодически наша рутинная работа будет разбавляться гонками по линиям электропередач в стиле Subway Surf.

+ стилистика. Первое, что хочу отметить, это визуальное оформление. Не знаю почему, но у меня возникла твёрдая ассоциация с 60-ми годами прошлого века. Так же бросается в глаза и 3Д, сразу ощущаешь всю ""глубину"" данного города.
+ изменения города. Не знаю как ещё обозвать этот пункт. Суть в том, что жизнь на каждом уровне заметно меняется после того, как включили электричество. Тёмные улочки становятся светлыми и безопасными, опасные перекрёстки - обычными развязками, тихие застолья становятся шумными вечеринками.
+ дизайн уровней. На каждом уровне ощущается всё та же ""глубина"" города. Перемещаясь по проводам вы оказываетесь то ближе, то дальше от экрана. Так же практически на каждом (а может и на каждом, просто я не нашел) уровне есть секретки - скрытые от глаз места, куда можно и нужно нести свет
+ комиксы. На каждый уровень нас не просто забрасывают, а показывают некий анимированный комикс, который является брифингом. Из него становится понятно с чем мы столкнёмся и что нам предстоит сделать
+ музыка. Особенно сильно это замечаешь во время гонок по ЛЭП - большинство (если не все) перемещения привязаны к такту музыки.
+ ачивки. Ну кто их не любит? А тут игра прямым текстом заставляет вас изучать уровень вдоль и поперёк, собирая все молнии и неся свет куда только можно, награждая вас за это заветными значками.

Однако вброшу пару ложек дёгтя в общую бочку:
- озвучка персонажей. Все персонажи-люди, имеющие голос в игре, больше похожи на первобытных людей. Они не говорят, они просто мычат, плачут, фыркают и тд. Имхо, но этот как-то неуместно в данной игре.
- уровень с потерянной девочкой забаговал. Прошел его первый раз на 2 лампы, решил перепройти, но что бы я не делал, девочка просто стоит и плачет в начале. Пришлось идти дальше без лишней лампы.
- уровень на ЛЭП после битвы с дроном (это какой реакцией нужно обладать, что бы во время ускоренной музыки успевать перемещаться?)

В целом, игра сделана с душой и очень хороша. Не побоюсь этого выражения ""даже излучает добро"". В роли маленькой безымянной искорки мы возвращаем жизнь в маленький городишко. Где ещё вам предложат такое?",1467316138,1511467435,True,5,2,0.545588791370391846,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I wasn't disappointed. Yes, it only took me around three hours to complete, and I plan to go back in and gather the rest of the achievements, but I believe the music and the atmosphere it creates in-game are what really sold me. As we all know, long games do not always equal good games.
The lack of speech does nothing to attract from the overall  ""narrative"" (though the few times a woman yelled was, it was cringeworthy~ :P ) and having sunk hours upon hours into the game, Journey, I have no issue with that.
I almost wished to know more behind the scientist and our little energy-laden protagonist, but the story sort of lends itself to your imagination in that aspect.

I used an XBox controller to play, so I never tried this out using the keyboard only, so I can't really speak to that particular aspect of the controls. Playing is pretty intuitive and the controls are easy to pick up. So, I'd reccommend this to really anyone~.

Turn On is a very relaxing play, and only once did I find myself stuck, just briefly as I learned the level layout.

I am very happy with my purchase. I must also note that I paid for this game during the Fourth of July sale for $8.99. It's a little steep for the length of the game, but with a regular price of $15.00, I felt it was justified given those whom make games deserve something after producing something that requires so much hard work.

TurnOn is an extremely adorable platformer without platforms. Following a blackout event, an “alien creature” traverses through electrical lines in an effort to bring light to those who need it most. Child-friendly gameplay, cute aesthetics and visual storytelling elements make this game a truly relaxing ride through Electro City. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[u][b]The Spark[/b][/u]
Professor Brain needs help following an accident at the power station in Electro City, so he employs a cuddly alien creature (spark). The player controls this spark in an effort to bring electricity back into homes, activate failed generators, and maintain order throughout the shambling city.

There are lots of easy achievements that promote exploration of the many levels in TurnOn, including: an achievement for turning on 3 lamps for each level, an achievement for lighting up X in each level, etc. Animated comics, along with NPC actions throughout gameplay, provide immersive visual storytelling along with insight on upcoming levels.

[u][b]Platforming Elements[/b][/u]
In this platformer without platforms, the player traverses through electrical lines in order to progress. Many familiar platforming elements are utilized, such as: jumping/falling, hazardous objects, hidden pathways/alternate routes, collectibles (lightning), checkpoints, and a lethal fall (the ground). Even though TurnOn is a 2D platformer, its artistic use of multiple platforming depths/layers and multi-linear progression makes it feel almost like a 2.5D platformer. 

Most of the deaths in TurnOn stem from missing a line/jump and falling to the ground. Every now and then, hazardous objects or an enemy (drone) will attribute to it, but this is a very friendly/casual game so that’s generally not the case. You can die from falling as many times as you need, without any penalty, and restart from a checkpoint. Any previously acquired lightning will remain in your possession. Specific objects, however, will hurt the spark’s health (denoted by 3 green lightning bolts); these are red lightning bolts (collectibles) or enemies. If the spark loses all of its health, the level will restart, and all collectibles will be returned. Green lightning bolts can be collected to recover lost health.

One of TurnOn’s most challenging, yet most exhilarating, elements is with its use of runner levels. On these levels, the screen and spark will progress forwards at an uncontrolled pace. Often times these runner levels are themed and present many active animations. A major aspect that makes me love these levels is with its great harmonization with the music. You will find yourself jumping and falling to the melody and beat changes (adds a lot of joy and promotes immersion).

Even though I personally enjoy the runner levels, the other platforming levels also provide a great deal of fun with its visual cues. Each level is themed, and often times, the spark will have a specific goal: guide the little girl back home by lighting up the street, scare away burglars by repowering alarms, revive a household’s energy consumption, etc. This variation in level design and immersion through effortless storytelling helps keep the player compelled to continue playing.

[u][b]Video Gameplay[/b][/u]
https://youtu.be/U0Kik73QmM8
[h1]Controls[/h1]
[u][b]Controller Support[/b][/u]
The controls for TurnOn is very simplistic; 1D movement, jump, and fall. Although the controls, by default, are sufficient for gameplay when using a controller or M&K, there is no support for rebinding controller/keyboard buttons. This shouldn’t be too big of an issue as precision handling is not required, but many platformer veterans may want to be aware of this.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[u][b]Current State of the Game[/b][/u]
The developers of the game seem to be very active with regards to player support and update frequency, as seen in the Discussions board and News updates. After only 5 days of release, a major patch was implemented to take Let’s Plays and Review feedback into consideration. Details of the patch can be seen [url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/TurnOn/announcements/detail/798641005146904200]here[/url].

[u][b]Advised Suggestions[/b][/u]
Even though TurnOn is fairly polished, there are a couple suggestions that may improve gameplay; these are listed below.

[list]
[*]Make the areas that the spark can travel through (on runner levels) more noticeable.
[list]
[*]Some portions of the wire (even if unlit) can be traversed – very confusing at times.
[/list]
[*]Allow controller/keyboard rebinding.
[*]Fix minor visual bugs.
[list]
[*]Awkward contact collision against walls.
[*]Abrupt screen jumping when traveling through terminals at times (almost as if travel animation is spliced in between starting/ending positions).
[/list]
[/list]

[u][b]Verdict[/b][/u]
TurnOn is a very relaxing and addictively fun product. Its cute aesthetics, visual storytelling and harmonic runner levels earn it a recommendation for any fan of platformers or child-friendly/casual games.

It bills itself as a platformer without platforms, and while that’s not strictly true, there's a focus on exploration and puzzle solving that the genre isn’t especially noted for. It’s a game about restoring power to a darkened city, which you do by moving a grinning alien spark around power lines until it’s able to reactivate circuit boards and power grids. 

There’s a kind of understated plot behind it all, dealing with aliens made of electricity, but it’s all kind of nonsensical. And that’s okay, because it makes it no less adorable. Exploring a world draped in darkness and reactivating the lights is strangely satisfying. Most levels are very laid back affairs, asking you to explore until you meet certain criteria, such as saving a girl walking home alone from an angry dog, or uniting two lovers at their favourite restaurant by clearing their way. What was once something as simple as turning on lights slowly dials up in complexity. You might have to activate cranes to drop metal platforms across pits, or reactivate traffic lights to clear massive congestion.

[h1][u][b]Game Overview[/b][/u][/h1]

[b]TurnOn[/b] is a casual, side-scrolling platformer that conveys a story through stellar audio and visual presentation without the use of words. (Except for the guides and instructions, of course)

In this game, you control an alien that takes the form of an electric ball and lead it through its journey to restore the light in Electro City.

The gameplay is pretty simple and straightforward - you traverse through electric lines/wires and apparatuses which activates and/or repairs them through contact while collecting blue lightning symbols. Each of these actions will have an impact to the score you will get upon finishing the level. Still seeing people in need through the level? Search again for hidden paths that you might've missed.

Also, you will find adversaries that might stand either your way or the people living in the city, and some of them require different mechanics in order to be cleared. Though there isn't a game over that could force you to start over, there are still some cases that may halt your progress through the game. 

Falling through the lines and touching the ground will result in you being sent back to your checkpoint, but everything that you have collected are still with you, every apparatus activated, and no damage taken. However, if you exhaust your life bars (represented by the green lightning symbols on the upper left part of the screen) you will restart the level from the start.


[h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]

[list]

    [*][b]Charming, Calming, and Hilarious Gameplay Experience[/b] - Summarizing the gameplay experience that I felt as I played through the game, it was very calming, charming, and fun experience that I would proudly say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. I mean, I never would've thought that I would see a character in a game crying over not having a cable signal. If that doesn't seem funny enough to you, then I guess you're Jaden.

    [*][b]Artistic Game Graphics[/b] - The game is very appealing through and through in each of every visual aspect it presents. The landscape and scenery fits the very theme it presents on every level, as well as the visual effects filled in it. The character models are clean and well-animated, along with the comic-strip cut-scenes. And most of all, the aesthetic lightning work in each and every level is impeccable.

    [*][b]Beautiful Game Soundtracks[/b] - Ranging from serene piano tracks to cheerful up-beat songs, this game has a lot to offer in the auditory department. And when I do say a lot, I really mean it. Each and every level has its own unique track and aside from the cut-scenes and the map soundtrack, almost nothing was ever re-used. Everything is quality-made and the proof of that are the hours I spent listening to the tracks while idling the game. If there is something that is missing, it is the availability of a soundtrack DLC for users to listen and enjoy.

[/list] 

[h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]

[list]

    [*][b]Irritating Sound Effects[/b] - Although the game has a pretty good array of soundtracks that is very pleasant to the ears, there are certain sound effects that will make you tone down the level due to discomfort, especially if you're new to the game. A good example of this is when you ""respawn"" to your checkpoint upon touching the ground. Fortunately, the game lets you adjust the volume of the sound effects. However, the downside is that you might not know other SFX that you're missing to hear.

    [*][b]Hard to Navigate[/b] - Just to be precise, I am pertaining to the game having no cut-scene skip and absence of the settings menu while you are on a level. Regarding the cut-scenes, you can actually speed them up by continuous left clicks or by spamming the ESC button, however, it still takes at least five (5) seconds in doing that before you proceed to the level. Having an option to skip them would be pretty handy for people uninterested or has already seen them several times. Same goes for the settings, which should be available while in-level instead going back to the main menu just to adjust the volume or video settings.

    [*][b]Minor Visual Bugs[/b] - During the course of my play through (which I could safely assume that I've reached at least one-thirds of the game), I have encountered two minor visual bugs, though take note that these bugs didn't have any impact on my play through. The first one I found was on the end part of the ""School Routine"" level which involves a speaker still being highlighted in blue even after activating it, and the second one is when you're going through the level selection and passing between the ""Bulb Monument Street"" and ""Unusual Date"" levels which shows an empty flat terrain. 

[i]Both of these bugs are recorded on my screenshots page here:[/i] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/screenshots/?appid=428220] (Screenshots)[/url]
[/list] 


[h1][u][b]The Verdict[/b][/u][/h1]

Truthfully, there isn't much of a discussion to this considering that I can't find anything that big of negative aspect could persuade you into NOT buying it (unless you're not into casual gaming). And if you are a fan of this kind of game, I'm pretty sure you will love it.

전자 구체 모양의 외계인 친구를 조종해서 어둠에 휩싸인 도시를 밝혀나간다. 전봇대와 전선을 타고 돌아다니며 전등을 밝히고, 환풍기를 켜고, 전기가 필요한 장치들을 작동시킨다. 가로등을 키고 장치들을 작동시키다보면 사람들의 행동 양상이 하나하나 변하고 도시 전체도 점점 밝아지기 시작한다. 

게임을 진행하면서 점점 바뀌어가는 도시의 전경을 구경하는 것이 꽤나 쏠쏠하다. 아트웍도 꽤나 괜찮은게 운치도 조금 있는 편. 무엇보다 음악이 정말 예술이다. 별도로 사운드트랙 하나 낼 정도. 거짓말 안 하고 사운드트랙이 같이 발매됐었다면 진작 구매했을 것이다. 

기본적으로 난이도는 쉬운 편이다. 전선만 잘 타고 다니면 클리어는 쉬운 편. 기본적으로 전기가 없는 세상이라는 설정이다보니 게임 화면이 약간 어두운데, 이것 때문에 밝혀야 할 것이 잘 안보인다. 그래도 전선만 잘 타고 스테이지를 꼼꼼히 훑으면 어지간한 것들은 다 밝히고 전등 3개 클리어에는 큰 문제는 없다. 다만 캐릭터가 자동으로 움직이는 러닝 스테이지가 암기를 조금 요하기도 해서 생각보다 조금 어려웠던 편. 사망에 대한 패널티도 별로 없긴 한데, 죽을 때마다 이전 상황이 리셋될 때도 있고 안 될 때도 있어서 조금 난감하다.

그 밖에 사소한 점들이 조금 거슬린다. 이따금씩 전선 배치가 조금 난해하게 되있어서 어디로 갈 수 있는지 파악이 안 되는 경우가 있다. 이럴 땐 아무데로나 뛰어보거나 신뢰의 도약을 할 수 밖에 없는데, 화살표 같은 걸로 보기 좋게 표시해뒀으면 더 좋았을 것 같다. 중간중간 이벤트 컷씬들이 스킵이 안 되는 것도 경미하게 짜증났고. 가끔 게임 진행 안 되는 버그도 조금 있는데, 인디 게임 답게 이런 면에서는 조금 투박한 감이 있다.

TurnOn is one of these games that don't focus specificly on gameplay alone, but rather on the atmosphere. You are a spark which can only move between wires, which makes the game a platformer. However, because the enviroments are in 3D, you will also be moving back and front, which can cause some confusion. Another thing that bothered me a bit was the camera, which, I feel, was a bit to close in certain parts. However these are only minor gripes in an otherwise very well made game. 

Your job will be helping all kinds of people and with the aid of the soothing music, it is a great combination to enjoy yourself after a long day at work/school. The game is also apropriate for younger children, however they might not be very good at it because of the previously mentioned 3D enviroments. However, that is not a big problem because it's actualy very hard to ""lose"" (it is possible by hitting to many red sparks or enemies). If you fall to the ground, you will simply resurrect at the checkpoint without loosing anything. 

While the gameplay is fairly basic, the atmosphere is the part to enjoy. When you start a level, it's mostly dark and depressing. After running around for a bit, it slowly gets brighter and brighter and the people get more and more happy. The sequences in the form of a comic book are a nice adition too and you will be seeing them quite a lot. 

To wrap things up, while the price isn't that low, I feel the game is worth it. It's not one of those competitive games to raise your adrenaline but rather a soothing and calming adventure, which often brings up a smile to your face. If only the camera was a bit further away at some points.

The game is not very challenging but is a fun game if you want something to sit back and enjoy and not have to worry about tough jumps or time limits. The mechanics are pretty simple as you jump between different power lines in the city to turn the city's electricity back on. The game includes some puzzles which mostly involve exploring to find what you need to turn on in order to proceed. Despite not being much of a challenge, I had a lot of fun with TurnOn.

Another area where TurnOn excels is its' atmosphere. TurnOn is a really charming game. The graphics are pretty nice especially as the levels light up as you turn on the city's lights. The music fits the mood perfectly. The thing that stood out most to me though was the little storylines in each level. An example is a level where you guide a lost kid back to their house. The main story could have been developed a little more but the game does such a great job creating a charming environment. 

While I really enjoyed TurnOn I have two issues with the game. As already mentioned the game is really easy. You will breeze through most of the levels. If you are looking for a challenging game, TurnOn is not it. The difficulty leads to the other issue which is the length. Since you can breeze through the levels the game ends up not being very long. I finished the game in around 4.5 hours. Unless you want to go for all of the achievements it will probably take you around the same amount of time to beat the game. 

If you are looking for a really challenging game, you might not like TurnOn but otherwise I would recommend picking it up.

[h1]THIS IS A MIXED REVIEW! TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION![/h1]

TurnOn is a cute platforming adventure with some levels using aspects of a running game. In TurnOn, you play as an alien creature (that looks like a ball of electricity) in a city shrouded in darkness, and it’s your goal to help the citizens, and restore the power and lights.

You travel along the powerlines and telephone poles jumping from one to another to bring power back to the city. There are two styles of levels: one is more of a casual platformer, and the other has some of the aspects you would see in a runner game (like Temple Run, or Bit.Trip Runner).

In the platforming levels, you move to power up things as you go, and in some levels you are basically escorting the characters through the levels by opening doors, and setting off alarms to scare away the bad guys. Contrary to the casual platforming levels there were other levels that resembled a simpler version of running game. You are forced down the lines with no way to slow down or speed up, and all you can do is jump from one wire to another.

Fortunately, there were more platforming levels than runner levels, but I spent a lot of time dying repeatedly on these runner levels. I don’t like runner games, and I admit it’s partially because I just plain suck at them, [strike]but I really hated these levels. I found it frustrating to play them, and I felt a sense of dread every time I encountered these levels. It really took away from my overall enjoyment of the game. With how casual the rest of the game feels, and then to have some levels like this eat up so much play time, these levels felt out of place.[/strike]

[h1][i][u]UPDATE:[/u] There have been several patches to address the runner levels being too difficult. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/428220/discussions/0/350532536105528124/](more information)[/url][/i][/h1]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list][*]story is short and sweet
[*]cute and colourful animation and art style (image boards, and short cinematics)
[*]the platforming incorporates using objects in both the foreground and background (it took a bit of getting used to, but I didn’t experience too many issues with the platforming)
[*]good, enjoyable, casual platforming levels[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*]music was good for the most part, but it was fairly repetitive (especially in the areas where you die repeatedly)

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
The game took me 4-5 hours, with at least an hour and a half of that dying repeatedly [i]before the changes were implemented[/i]. While it wasn’t the most frustrating game I’ve played, I would have probably skipped on playing this game if I had known about the runner levels. At the same time though, I did enjoy the other parts, so I’ve got pretty mixed feelings about the game as a whole. [i][u]I have changed my review from mixed negative to mixed positive to better take into account the many updates the developers have done.[/u][/i]

The overall theme could be better explored, and there’s not real challenge for “Hardcore Gamers!”, but it’s a game you should give a chance and try it out. Brainy Studio, you got me Turned On!

Which is where TurnOn comes in. A casual platformer developed by the four man team of Brainy Studio, TurnOn features some great relaxing music, colorful art style, and creative level designs. 

TurnOn is a narrative story told through comic-like cutscenes and during the game’s levels. After a power station accident, an alien becomes sentient by fusing with the power stations’ systems. Players take control of the little ball of alien electricity as it makes it way throughout the city trying to restore the cities’ power. Players travel along the electrical wires throughout the power station, residential, and commercial districts of the city. Players must solve puzzles like helping a little girl get home safely and fighting crime by setting off alarm systems to scare off looters. 
The levels of TurnOn are wonderfully colorful and dynamic. The power lines allow players to travel seamlessly from the background to the foreground. This gives each level the feeling of being three dimensional despite the games 2D art. What slightly contrasted this great feature was that the electric alien of the game would not change in size when moving from the foreground to background in some parts of the game. It was minor, but it still made the character seem out of place compared to everything else, which would shrink and grow in size as the game’s camera moved back and forth. The game’s puzzles in each level were not overly challenging. It mainly just took a bit of exploring and common sense to realize which power box to jump into to activate more lights or to stop traffic lights for someone to safely cross the street. The slower paced and relaxing puzzle levels of TurnOn were juxtaposed by racing sequences. During these, players would jump between four different wires at a time, trying to collect as many hovering lightning tokens for points, while avoiding falling to their deaths or hitting the red tokens, which when three were hit, you died. 

TurnOn’s art and music were two awesome parts of the game. The lighting in the game feels bright and vibrant due to its contrast with the blackout of the city. The background is painted with a darker color palette of blues and purples, that still give the game a fun and cheerful feeling, without making it feel dark and gloomy. People also populate many of the game’s scenes, usually in distress about one situation or another, all related to the cities’ blackout. This helps the city feel alive, and being able to watch them cheer or enjoy their lives again with your help adds to the satisfaction of completing each puzzle. The music of TurnOn was one of my, dare I say it, turn ons. The casual gameplay and vibrant colors are complimented by the smooth jazz throughout the game. The music during the puzzle scenes adds to the relaxing mood and made this game one of my favorites to come home and play after work. The racing sequences of the game had faster pace music to compliment their gameplay. The developers definitely hit the mark with creating a great atmosphere for their game with the music.   

TurnOn is a very enjoyable and relaxing platformer that is great for adults and kids. The colorful art style and smooth jazz music fit well together, while the simple gameplay and dynamic level design made it fun. I did run into two bugs during my playing, but both of the them were easily fixed by simply reloading the level from the previous checkpoints and neither occurred more than once. The developers were quick to respond to my email about the bugs, so I am sure that these minor kinks will be fixed soon. 

Pros: 

Colorful art style

Relaxing music

Dynamic levels

Fun gameplay

Controller support

Steam Achievements

Comic-like narrative

Kid friendly

Simple controls

Support for 18 languages (check Steam for list)

Cons:


Few bugs (minor and easy to get around)

Character does not change size with movement from background to foreground sometimes

Such as scaring away looters and people who are taking advantage of the darkness to perform bad deeds. The musical sections in which you must travel along a long bridge of power lines in beat with the music are also a nice break in between areas. The game also subtly spreads the message of environmental awarness in a nice and calm sort of way, without sounding all preachy about it. If you are a fan of colourful, cute and musically satisfying games, then TurnOn is the game for you.
