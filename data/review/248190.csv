Pros, amazing world building, nice graphics, nice controls, good consistent humour, relaxing, I loved exploring everything it was rather relaxing

Neutral, rather short but its not a cheap game, 

Negatives - time consuming to navigate, this isnt a issue in earlier shorter chapters but it does drag the game down especially when back tracking in chapter 3 (the last chapter), plot is ok but falls short of anything substantial,

One of my favourite 2D platformers. I consider it “required reading”.

This game is huge. It’s a criminal steal at its current price considering its breadth. The soundtrack alone is almost 5 hours of beautiful mostly‐ambient tracks (complemented in‐game by suitably‐muted sound design that’s still got punch when it should), and it’s a perfect zen companion to even more hours of exploring the vast underground world finding all manner of obscure secrets. Not that it’s just about exploring — mastering the fun platforming mechanics is key to your traversal, and you’ll find your ability to harness your powers is what truly opens up the world to you. There are no “upgrades” to collect like in a traditional “Metroidvania” game; you just have to learn and practice the depth of the controls given to you. There are also a few parts where the exploration is stripped entirely in favour of presenting a pure series of precision platforming challenges, which I also really enjoyed.

The graphical style is perhaps unusual, but manages many beautiful environments regardless. I think character design is the weakest point here, being in a stiff “toon” style which feels a bit out of place, but that’s also not what’s front‐and‐centre most of the time, and it’s still fine anyway.

The game’s story is pretty interesting and engaging. It’s more prominent than you’re probably expecting. It also gets into some more deep and philosophical stuff, with a few things that particularly hit home for me. Do be aware that there are some “adult” themes mixed in with this; it can be a bit surprising to see F‐bombs dropped in this game given how chill and zen it is on the whole, and it’s not plentiful, but they are there. Text and dialogue also end up being something of a weak point however, purely because of how it’s presented: dialogue boxes fade in and out abruptly, and there’s no animation or formatting to it at all (practically the opposite of a Paper Mario game for example), which makes some things fail to land nearly as well as they could have. On occasion the text falls flat on its own merits as well. I still enjoyed the writing on the whole as well though, particularly the quips between your 2 main companion characters.",1697478369,1697478424,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I heard this was a game about exploring, gave it a look when it was on sale for about a dollar, and have left feeling like I ripped off the dev. The environments, the characters, the music, the storytelling, have all left this as one of my favourite games ever. It's extremely fun to move around, the dynamic between the two main fairies was entertaining throughout, and the worldbuilding is some of the most fascinating I've seen in gaming since I played Rain World. I will say a few things if you want to try this out:
1: There is no real combat. The 'game' is about exploring and platforming, and some of the platforming gets difficult, but the focus is never on the enemies or your ability to defeat them, because you (largely) can't.
2: The first two chapters are basically prologues and tutorials for chapter 3, which is for all intents and purposes the main attraction here. The map opens up and it's fucking massive, all 17 of those hours came from seeing every corner of it. And for a sidescrolling indie game where you can actually get around pretty fast, that's saying something.
3: On that note, every single tile on that map has a room in it. If there seems to be a blank space with no connections to it from adjacent rooms, there's simply a secret you're missing. Figuring those out is very satisfying.
4: Your character does not gain ANY movement upgrades past chapter 3. This means once the map opens up, you can go literally anywhere you want. If a particular piece of platforming looks impossible, it's just because you haven't discovered the way to pass it yet, and at most there is a power-up a few rooms away that you need to utilise in a creative way. The only exception are the big grey doors, usually locked by a button on the other side.
That's it. Nifflas, thank you for making one of the most relaxing and utterly entrancing games I've every played. This particular world will stick with me for a long time.",1695993485,1695993485,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The main gameplay loop involves traversing the massive 'Underground' to find objects/relics/plants/etc and doing fetch quests (usually associated with platforming challenges).  Many of the objects you find will have flavor text with them, and the quests are filled with character-driven moments.

The graphics may appear basic at first, but they are actually quite charming after a while.
The game consists of three chapters and a hub that connects them. Chapters 1 and 2 serve as tutorials, helping you become familiar with the game's unique traversal mechanics. As a sprite, you can move, jump, and wall climb. However, the real excitement comes when you transform into a ball. The ball bounces, and you can make it bounce a little higher, but you need to learn how it interacts with the environment.
Chapter 3 is essentially the main game. You can freely transform between sprite and ball, giving you more freedom and traversal options. The game's primary objective is to ring six bells, which are scattered around a huge map and guarded by NPCs who request that you collect generic items. This means you have to explore on your own, but that's one of the best parts of the game.
The map is 48x30 screens in size, totaling 1440 screens. It might sound daunting, but most of the screens are relaxing passageways, and only a few of them have obvious puzzles. The mini-map is your best friend. It tracks everywhere you've been and, more importantly, marks rooms with items, quests, or points of interest. If you're unsure about what to do next, just keep exploring, revealing the map, and collecting the items you find along the way.
There are also interesting NPCs scattered throughout the world. The main character is mute but accompanied by two fairies with opposite personalities. In each interaction, you can choose which fairy speaks on your behalf, altering the dialogue. The game also has great, relaxing tracks that enhance the experience.
In a map this big, you'd expect a good fast travel system, but I think this is one of the worst ones out there. It tries to be a unique mechanic but sacrifices almost all the convenience of normal fast travel systems. Here, you must first find an entry point, which is fine. However, you're then thrown into a dark, miniature version of the world without a mini-map. You have to navigate in the direction you want to travel and find an exit point that takes you somewhere in that area.
But it gets worse. You only have one minute for the travel segment, so good luck going from one end of the map to the other. Additionally, each time you use this system, you consume a finite resource. It's just a pain to use, but thankfully, it's not required. The map is big, but even backtracking manually doesn't feel too bad since most rooms are empty anyway.
It's a big game, and it gets even bigger because there are a lot of secrets to find, hidden inside passages. The hub looks innocent, but that's where the majority of secrets are located. Oh, and there are even secrets within secrets! Most achievements are related to specific secrets, and while I encourage you to you to beat the main game by yourself, you'll definitely need a guide to find everything hidden around. With those, the game's size increases to 1800+ screens!
It's a great game with great design, especially considering it was mostly developed by one guy. However, it appears that the PC version lacks a few features compared to the console versions. For example, there's no quest log or display of map coordinates. But the biggest issue is the lack of any form of controller support! The game is available on consoles, so there's no excuse for their absence in the PC version, especially since it's a platformer. However, you can use a third-party software tool to map keyboard inputs to a controller, and it works fine like that. It's just an extra step.
Overall, I had a great time playing Knytt Underground. I enjoyed all the exploration and freedom the game provides, along with its interesting movement options. Finally uncovering the entire map was incredibly satisfying, and the abundance of secrets adds a lot more playtime. It's a hidden gem that I definitely recommend.",1686730808,1686730808,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

You are thinking about if you should purchase it.  Well ask yourself these questions:  ""Do I like precision platformers?""  ""Do I like puzzlers?""  ""Do I like exploration?""  ""Do I like ambient music?""  If you answered 'yes' to any one of these questions, you may want to consider looking into this game.  If you answered 'yes' to more than one of those questions, you will kick yourself if you don't get it.  If you answered 'yes' to all of those questions, please stop reading this review and just get the damn game already, you will not regret it.  I loved playing through this game.  Them 80+ hours don't lie!

I feel obligated to start by saying that this game is definitely not for everybody.  First and foremost, it is a precision platformer game with some sort-of puzzle-y elements to it.  You will miss your jumps and landings.  A lot.  You will die.  A lot.  You will hit parts of the game where you're not quite sure what to do, at least not right away.  If you don't have the patience for it, then you will find it frustrating.  Another factor which I've noticed some folks in the reviews section complaining about is the pacing.  To some, it may feel a little slow because a big part of the game is just kind of exploring--especially when trying to hunt down all the gazillion secrets squirreled away in all the corners.  If that sort of gameplay isn't for you, then you will probably feel like this is a little too frustrating or slow-paced for your enjoyment, and you may just want to pass on this.

Okay, now with that out of the way, let me extoll the virtues of Knytt Underground, easily one of my favorite games.  I feel like this game is a real credit to its genre; it really gets the precision-platformer formula very very right.  First off, games like this reward repetition and fine-tuning your maneuvers.  On top of that and the obvious stuff, though, this game has a pretty unique element in which you need to switch between two different modes which handle completely differently in order to, y'know, get past obstacles and continue the game.  One mode is where you're on foot, and you can walk and jump and climb, and the other mode is where you're a bouncy ball and you can gain bounce height and momentum and bounce off of surfaces and stuff.  Additionally, there are short-term power-ups which are strategically placed in the platforming challenges which you will need to use in order to get through.  Overall, pretty cool and fun!  Now yes, you will fall into lava or walk into laser beams and you will die a lot; but, the mechanic is, in my opinion, pretty forgiving as you can generally return right to the start of a section when you die.  I think that's kind of the perfect way to balance this sort of gameplay.  For those of us who enjoy precision platformers, I think this game has some unique features and really brings an extremely strong offering to the table which will bring many hours of enjoyment to fans of the genre.

Speaking of hours, let's talk about the length.  You'll breeze through chapters 1 and 2 in...  I dunno, 30 minutes, maybe less.  Those are basically just the tutorial chapters, though, so don't enter chapter 3 thinking you'll finis the whole game in an evening.  Once you start chapter 3, things actually start to get interesting, and then before you know it, you're 20 hours in and haven't even explored half of the map yet.  This game is actually huge!  The main story will take you all around the sprawling map which has loads of areas to explore, with an absurd number of secret areas hidden away for you to find.

And that leads us to the exploration element of the game.  The game consists of a whole lot of varied areas to explore, with platforming challenges to solve, characters to interact with, fetch quests, and new areas that will open up.  If you do enjoy exploration, then this game is for you, as there are loads of places on the map to explore, and each area brings its own interesting and unique atmosphere and ambiance, and the (rather excellent) soundtrack really brings everything together very nicely.  And the secrets.  Ohhhhh buddy, the secrets.  There are so many little secret passages, shortcuts, areas, and challenges hidden ALL OVER the map.  If you want to go balls to the wall, you can spend HOURS just trying to ferret out all the little secrets the game has hidden all over the place.  This is a game where before or after completing the platforming challenges (some of which are, indeed, very challenging), you then may face the urge to try to climb into all of the corners of the room, just in case there's a secret passage somewhere that might lead to some new bit of the story of the world it's set in.  And be aware that exploring every little thing and finding secrets is actually the only way to truly beat this game.  In fact, if you really play this game in and out, you'll find that the whole premise of the main quest is somewhat of a farce (actually it's one huge farce nested in another farce), which really plays into the whole central point/theme/whatever of the game.

So now, let's talk about the story.  Most of the story is told through dialog; there are lots of characters to talk to and lots of dialog to read through, and all of it, plus the environment, kind of builds up into a sort of atmospheric story.  The main bulk of the story isn't really told in the main quest line, it's built up in all of the side interactions, which I think is a pretty neat way to do it and express the overarching themes.  I will say that sometimes the writing can feel a little clunky because English is not the creator's first language, but it's fine, and the point definitely gets across in every section with dialog.  There are plenty of funny moments and lots of moments that'll just kick you straight in the feels and make you think.  The storytelling was actually one of my favorite parts about the game, but it might go a little bit over your head if you aren't actually giving it the attention it deserves (which, tragically, seems to be the rule rather than the exception in today's gaming community).  It doesn't always take itself too seriously (4th wall?  What 4th wall??), but it's definitely interesting and fun, and manages to engage some philosophical ideas without actually getting super serious about any of them or trying to shove any ideology down your throat.

So...  Overall, yeah, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys...  Well...  All the stuff up above that I just wrote about in that little wall of text.  If this sounds like your cup of tea, it's well worth way more than the 7 bucks it's listed for.",1685730825,1685730825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The platforming just felt great the moment you take control of the character. There is a huge, interconnected world to explore, filled with things to find, and platforming challenges that have you switching between powers (Mi and jump and climb and use various power-ups, the ball form can bounce higher and has a grappling hook). 

What really sets Kynnt Underground apart is that it is a exploration platformer that is NOT a Metroidvania. It's just one big world, not segmented into separate areas, and no doors locked behind certain power-ups. It is still a lot of fun to find your way through the world and there are varied settings with area-specific gimmicks. It just doesn't have the usual tropes of the Metroidvania genre that was starting to get a bit old for me. 

I also can not stress enough how much I loved the vibe of the world. It's not lonely/desolate, but alive and filled with people. The NPCs quests/dialogs just elevate the game so much for me. Some are goofy but charming, while some are heartfelt and sincere. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will give one small example I really liked. In chapter 3 of the game, you get a fairy companion. And while you are exploring the world, you two might wonder upon her parent's home, and you see her having a small argument with her family. Her dad wants what's best for her, but is being a bit too over-protective / conservative. It's a little detail, but the writing felt very believable and did a lot to make her more believable as a person with her own life.

These were the last words I read in Knytt Underground. This was the best game I played this year. A game that had so many things in it, and, even though they were quite simple, I still have difficulties in piecing them together. I enjoyed every minute of it, every minute of exploration, every minute of dialog that gives a further glimpse of character backstory. I really loved the fact that there was no human in the underground, and still, all the creature were so human-like, from the fairies, to the disgusting jellies. All of them expressed what seemed like the whole spectrum of human emotions, and, as humans, their stories never quite resolve the way we expect, or even resolve at all.

Given that I am under 50% completion in achievements, I probably have so many things to find still, but I won't bother. Excavating the underground came to an end today, and I am very happy that I met all the characters, and experienced their emotions, fears, and wants. I expected nothing in the beginning, but this is a game that I will cherish forever. Thanks, Nifflas.",1669693504,1669693504,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

However, the game has a weird way of scaling difficulty. Some of the challenges in Chapter 3 required a good amount of precision, or backtracking, or knowing where to find hidden passages. The last two being particularly difficult as much of the map looks very similar.

The overall gameplay is nice, with quests to help you progress and funny NPCs that constantly break the 4th wall. Despite this the overall theme, artwork, and feel of the game are really nice and those familiar with previous nifflas games will feel right at home.

Let me explain. The reason I loved this game is because I think it looks and sounds beautiful, and it was a joy for me to search and explore every corner of the map. You never know what you'll see/hear in the next screen. The platforming puzzles were pretty good overall, and I grew to really like the main character's ball form and quickly switching between forms to get places. 

Beyond the exploration and sight-seeing, there was the secrets - and boy is this game chock full of them! I've visited all of the rooms in the game's map, and still probably haven't revealed even half of them. I do have to say that a lot of them are too well hidden and give no indication of being there. It's really upto the player's taste, whether they like hunting secrets like this. I personally liked looking for them whenever I could, but I am certainly not gonna spend the time to go after each and every one of them. Most achievements are related to secrets, and given how well hidden they are in this game, very few players get any achievements at all.

So, to summarize, the reason I love this game are the beautiful visuals and music, the exploration, and the secret hunting. Now to the criticisms. The main criticism from me is the story and writing. The way the game ends seems to be a setup to send a message about ""the journey being more important than the destination"", but it really comes off as if the developer just didn't know how to do a cohesive story. It feels as if the game is chiding me for expecting a well executed ending and fears that I will think the worse of it because of the lacking story. It would have been better to not have so much dialog and set up so many characters. An abstract and vague story would have worked just as well. To be fair to the developer though, he seems to be aware that he's being a jerk and characters in the game badmouth him at the end :D

Because of the way it's written, it feels like the developer had some ideas, started to write and incorporate them in the game, and then at some point threw up his hands and did self-inserts to try and make it funny. This can be a huge turnoff to many, as it makes everything feel pointless. Hence, this is a very cautious recommendation - if you like just running around exploring, occasionally doing some platforming and puzzles, and hunting for secrets, then this game is right up your alley. If you can't stomach bad writing or hate games without a story or atleast proper payoffs for the exploration, then I you'll find this game boring and pointless.",1655141772,1655141772,True,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,False,False,False,False,,,

At first I was like ""what is this?"", then I start playing it and it was actually pretty good platformer with its own atmosphere. The whole soundtrack in this game is pretty charming and fits really good with the art style.

Knytt Underground, eis um jogo que me pegou completamente desprevenido.

Comprei ele em uma promoção por 3 reais (pra fechar um valor múltiplo de 5 na compra total - sim, eu tenho esse TOC as vezes), então, quando comecei a jogar ele, não estava esperando nada além de um jogo de plataforma simplório que eu terminaria em pouco tempo.

Resultado: Depois de 25 horas de gameplay, após ter explorado absolutamente tudo no mapa e platinado o jogo, eu me encontro triste por não ter mais dele para jogar.

E é por conta disso q eu venho fazer essa análise, para tentar explicar toda a experiência incrível contida nesse jogo que, infelizmente, passa batido por muita gente.

[hr][/hr]

 [h1]O que é Knytt Underground?[/h1]

Knytt Underground é um jogo que possui 3 capítulos, mas não se deixem enganar pelos dois primeiros, eles são apenas tutoriais, pode-se dizer assim. O verdadeiro jogo começa no capitulo 3, que te dá total liberdade para explorar todo o mapa do jogo. 
E é aqui que eu faço um aviso: Se você não gosta de exploração, passe longe desse jogo, porque Knytt Underground é 95% exploração (e os outros 5% são plataforma).
Eu não estou exagerando quando digo isso. Para vocês terem uma ideia, os mapas dos capitulos 1 e 2, que são até que grandinhos, somam apenas, mais ou menos, 10% a 15% do mapa do capitulo 3 (que seria o mapa completo do Underground). 
Sim, É UM MAPA [b]GIGANTESCO!!![/b] E não apenas isso, como é um mapa CHEIO de segredos, áreas, caminhos secretos, quests, items, etc. 
(Destaque pra parte dos segredos e caminhos secretos. Esse jogo tem tanta coisa secreta que algumas são Inceptions de segredos. Literalmente, há lugares com áreas secretas dentro de áreas secretas, e isso não é incomum de achar)

E aqui eu devo deixar o meu fascínio pelo jogo. Esse mapa gigantesco não é algo feito de forma simples, nem de longe. Ao se explorar, é perceptível o cuidado do desenvolvedor em tornar o Underground um local dinâmico e vivo. Há diversas áreas com ambientações e temas variados, há diferentes locais com cidades e NPC's de diferentes espécies, há diferentes conhecimentos, histórias, ideologias e construtos para se aprender mais acerca do underground e dos povos que lá vivem, há uma soundtrack específica para cada área diferente no Underground, etc. E falando na OST, as músicas desse jogo são muito boas e agradáveis.

E, um dos elementos que mais gostei do jogo, é a história dos personagens (principalmente das duas fadas que você conhece no final do capitulo 1 e que te seguem durante todo o capitulo 3). Ao se explorar o Underground, você passa por diversos lugares e coisas que fizeram parte da vida dessas fadinhas, e elas comentam acerca dessas coisas. Quanto mais você explora, mais você vai encontrando coisas que fazem as fadas se abrirem e explicarem conhecimentos acerca do Underground e coisas das vidas delas, e essas coisas não são apenas historinhas, são umas paradas meio ""realistas"", como experiências traumáticas que elas passaram e como elas seguiram em frente com isso (e, meu amigo, o que essas duas tem de histórias traumáticas... damn!). Essas histórias não apenas te deixam com vontade de explorar mais, como, algumas vezes, realmente te fazer pensar e te fazem se apegar e simpatizar com os personagens do jogo.

Quanto ao elemento plataforma do jogo, eu achei ele desafiador na medida certa. Tirando os vários desafios secretos que tem perdidos pelo jogo (esses sim são difíceis de fazer) os obstáculos que você encontra durante a exploração possuem uma dificuldade até que fácil (o que faz sentido, tendo em mente que o jogo tende a ser mais zen), com uma ou outra parte que te faz parar pra pensar como passar dela.

 [h1]Conclusão[/h1]

Acreditem quando digo que Knytt Underground é uma pérola dourada perdida na Steam. Não se deixem enganar pela sua aparência mais simples, há muito, mas [b]MUITO[/b] conteúdo dentro desse joguinho, o suficiente para trazer uma experiência de jogo única e fantástica que vai te prender por horas.

Like the previous titles, it's a 2D platformer that focuses on exploration and platforming rather than defeating enemies.  Chapters 1 and 2 are just the introduction for chapter 3, which contains the main meat of the game.  You can climb in your humanoid form, and switch to a ball and bounce on surfaces, and you get temporary powerups like a super jump or horizontal flight.  Using just these mechanics (you don't really get any more abilities, unlike a typical Metroidvania) you can go anywhere you want, and explore the beautifully crafted world and uncover all its secrets.  Sometimes you'll be running around and just stop to admire the scenery.  Few other games can match the ""I wonder what's over there"" aspect of Knytt Underground; this feeling drove me to try and see every room.  Anyone who enjoys open-world adventure games will feel right at home.

It's almost impossible to get even one. I have no achievements, just like 96% of average, non-hardcore gamers who played this.

And to beat this, You should go to all the corners many times. I read in other reviews that is a kind of MESSAGE, and it is not about beating the game, but about exploring. But how anyone should find fun in a pointless exploring with 0 (zero) rewards?

Maybe there is actually some plot in this game, but after hours and hours of gameplay i still don't know what actually going on, who is the main character, who are bad guys, if there is any.

- The story is thin (on purpose), but the main characters are fairly well written.

The music, as well, is a logical follow-up, although I do wish there was less music used simply for extra content like the Figure rooms. The platforming as Mi is easy to learn and fits right at home for anyone who has played either Knytt or its sequel, and the ball is equally as easy to understand if you have played Within a Deep Forest.

A lot of reviewers seem to have issues with the narrative and goal of the game, so I will say: do not go into this expecting a ""metroidvania"" or anything like that--it's a much more traditional exploration/adventure kind of game, where a fair amount of the fun of exploring is just seeing the world and meeting people, with the occasional challenge on some screens for items (similar to Knytt). The story, while it may not take itself very seriously (re: the end of any of the three chapters), still provides engaging moments (namely Dora and Cillia's respective storylines), as well as welding together the canons of the Knytt games, Saria, and Within a Deep Forest. If you go out and do the quests, you get a better idea of the world and its inhabitants (and a few extra after-game credits scenes). There is also tons of extra content--be it the secrets around the main menu or in Chapter 3 itself--to keep you going both during and after the game, ranging from additional lore/story to harder challenges for those who simply enjoy the gameplay as opposed to its loop.

The things that threw me off most originally were the character designs and dialogue. The characters are unsettling gremlins with huge eyes and ridiculous colors/clothing/accessories. Dialogue boxes have these awful color gradients that remind me of windows 98/2003. The story is a mess (but grew on me eventually with its very personal character struggles). The ending is still a big slab of nothing though - actually, nothing might've been better than the slap in the face it gives you for daring to ask for a bit of closure.

All that said, what I came to love about this game was its exploration. Chapters 1 and 2 are short, but chapter 3 is absolutely massive for this type of game. Just look up a map and you'll see how crazy it is. Instead of permanent upgrades, most of the gameplay in KU involves freely exploring this giant world, making it much less metroidvania and much more ""open world platformer"", although there are some temporary powerups, 1-way paths, and items needed to open doors blocking your way. These items are usually obtained through side quests and puzzles. But the majority of rooms you'll come across won't have any enemies or puzzles in them at all. Instead, it's the environments and sense of exploration that make Knytt Underground so amazing.

Each room is a mix of ominous black solids and colorful backgrounds that are often filled in with real photos of plants, flowers, fruit, etc. In contrast to the unsettling character sprites, I think these environments offer up an alien world with a fantastic sense of wonder and variety: from forests, to lakes, to crystal caves, to underwater labs, to volcanic caves, to fossilized remains, and many more. The music helps greatly, ranging from atmospheric ambiance to catchy tunes. Some of my favorite places include the shadowlands near the top right side of the map, the dark caves at the bottom, and the little forest maze on the left side of the world. But no matter where you look, there's good stuff to be found.

I think this is the type of game you'd enjoy most if you like exploring not to find new abilities, but for the reward of coming across a mysterious new place to get lost in. There are also many, many secrets in KU. Several of these are linear challenge areas that play differently from the rest of the game, and test your platforming abilities and powerup usage.

I used to hate Dora and Cilia, but now I find them to be interesting (and sometimes hilarious) characters. The writing, over the years, shifted from annoying me to becoming endearing and understandable. My overall opinion on KU has done a complete 180, and now it's once of my all time favorites. It's an extremely personal and detailed atmospheric exploration game, with a mix of good parts and bad, and eventually I came to realize that it wouldn't be the same if it had been made any other way.

The game is generally too big and with too many useless rooms. The backtracking is sometimes annoying because some rooms are only one-way and the map doesn't tell you that.

The story background is fun enough what with the group of people trying to understand how humans used to be and what the objects they find were. The story itself however is really awful. The main character doesn't speak (much), and that's fine, but the two fairies with her speak a lot and their personalities are generally awful. One is an angry lesbian and the other one a ""good girl"" that wasn't born so good. Other characters in the world are not terribly interesting.

I'm still recommending it because it plays well, there's a lot of exploration involved (as in, there's a lot of objects to find, not just going through empty rooms, thankfully) and the platforming is fun enough. There's also a lot of secrets to find, and a few extra challenge room.

The way the story is written and the plot is delivered almost completely eschews how ""video game writing"" is supposed to work.

Even the gameplay, which emphasizes things such as exploration and sidequests for their own sake rather than any particular reward, has dispensed itself of any possible airs.

In many ways Knytt Underground is a reflection on Nifflas' games up to this point, particularly Knytt, Knytt Stories and Within A Deep Forest, though there are also areas that remind of NightSky and probably other references I've missed. Truth be told, I haven't actually played most of these games and so I actually felt a bit unqualified to be playing this, though that is of course my own crazy preference. The way Knytt Stories is utilized in this game felt particularly touching to me though, and this idea of importance, the previously mentioned idea of unimportance, and the clash between them is what this game is really going for, I think.

Such an odd game, and I can hardly elucidate why. It's also a game that doesn't really begin until Chapter 3 and had me wondering if I was enjoying it or not up until then.

I loved the original Knytt way back when; recently found it again on my HD, played it, and decided to look what else the developer had been up to. I was very happy to see a new Knytt-titled game; bought it without checking it out. Boy, talk about making a big mistake.

Despite the name this has little in common with the original game. Knytt - the original - was about leisurely exploring a tranquil world. You had a lot of freedom in where to go. Enemies were few and far between. The game wasn't even primarily about collecting parts for your spaceship, even though that was its nominal objective; rather, it was about exploring, about going on a virtual ramble, as it were, and enjoying the scenery. It always made you wonder what you might find on the next screen: what new areas would look like, what you might find delving down into the bowels of the earth, and so on. 

This game, OTOH, is linear. Everything looks the same. It's rife with enemies and replete with puzzles. There's a fair bit of talking to other characters, too (the original game lacked any kind of verbal dialogue), and most of the time when you talk to someone you'll end up getting a fetch quest. 

Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily a [i]bad[/i] game in and on itself. It's nothing special, but if you like puzzle platformers, go for it. If trying to get past the enemies on a screen for the 20th time because you can't get that jump 100% right is your idea of fun, knock yourself out. Different strokes for different folks.

It certainly isn't for me though. And I'm disappointed not just that it doesn't live up to the original, I'm also disappointed (and more so) that it's called ""[i]Knytt[/i] Underground"". That's my real beef with this game: in reality, it has little if anything to do with Knytt, and lacks pretty much everything that made the original such a great game. I don't really mind the admittedly modest sum I spent on it, or the time I spent trying to like it, only to find I couldn't. But I expected something great, and got what strikes me as a mediocre game at best, and that's what really smarts.

As someone who is not great at video games and made it through WaDF only with many retries and a not insignificant amount of swearing, I appreciate that Knytt Underground contains areas of varied difficulty so you can tackle whatever degree of frustration you're in the mood for. The basic story is overall not too tough to complete, but some of the secret areas have challenges so maddening that even the hardest parts of WaDF look like child's play in comparison.

Nicklas Nygren (Knytt author) is one of my favorite indie developers, along: Ben Croshaw, Derek Yu, Daniel Remar, Pieter Simoons, Jonathan Blow, J. Kyle Pittman. Crossed path with some of their work in 2006 during my own personal PC recession where circumstances and saturation with current games led me to explore the indie scene. I purposely left out Matthew Smith and Matt Thorson because they rule the throne above anyone else. Smith for creating two best platformers the size less of your average desktop icon and Thorson for surpassing the legend. Played most in not all of the games from people mentioned above over the course of next 5 years, to give you have an idea where I'm coming from.

LoL, who am I kiddin? Who have no clue who these people are do you. Let me get on with it then...

This game is a platformer, pure and simple. Metroidvania it is not, not even a little, as I've seen it called. Abilities you start with stay the same until the very end. Sometimes you need to fetch an object for an NPC to open a door, that's it. The rest are more or less trivial fetch quests. Focus is on exploration and rarer on skill. The only punishment for death is a respawn on a nearby platform in the very same room, without consequences. There is no ego crushing death counter after the end thankfully. Some areas are more difficult than others but nothing you won't be able to handle with a little practice. Usually those areas are optional and hide some secrets that you won't beat yourself over the head for missing. Unless you are achievement hunter but that means you are sufficiently skilled already.

* * *

I will now shortly go over some details why I set out to give it a Negative review until I got to Chapter 3 where I changed my mind.

Chapter 1 & 2 are roughly the size of Super Metroid map area (say around 50 map tiles each) and what bothered me greatly was not the small size or super linear progression, but the extremely infantile NPC dialogues. They are like punchlines of internal jokes only Nicklas and his buddies understand. Making absolutely zero sense and coming off childish AF. Not one of those where you get the meaning later either. A complete waste of CPU cycles to be brutally honest. I'd be less frustrated with a malignant crypo-miner running in the background.
Aside that the Chapters serve as training levels of sorts although I would rather see them condensed to training rooms as part of Chapter 3 5-min warm up. Wasted about 4 hours on low quality Chapters 1 & 2. The last Chapter is where the real game begins so that'll be my focus from now on.

* * *

Firstly the advertised 1800 rooms number is no joke, this fcker is the size of one-and-a-half Super Metroid in terms of map tiles. The foreground detail is no match in quality but suitable. The backgrounds are another story however. Almost every room has animated foto-realistic image of some kind. Fauna sways on the wind while static machinery decorates the underground. All I could think about is how much effort it took to align and harmonize it all in continuous fashion... Solved a 2000 piece puzzle once and that took ages. But to fiddle with so many intertwined screens, from scratch - forget it.
Map consists of a 48 by 30 grid tiles and it all filled without even a single empty tile. Any gaps you may have will let you know about hidden passages you missed. The remaining off-map tiles are hidden very well and seeking those yields appropriate reward, including a series of expert level puzzles! Careful where you step.
What's even better is that the whole thing is split into several biomes or sorts. Each with its own graphic style, audio track and sometimes even a bit of lore explaining its purpose in the grand scheme of things.

There are two modes of movement: as human you walk slowly and climb vertical walls; as a ball you bounce high and move faster. Switching mid-air is possible and necessary to latch on to higher ledges. There are few temporary powerups that modify your abilities forcing to you get creative with nearby puzzles. This important part is really well done as is expected from an old indie guru.
Movement isn't perfect: walking could use more animation frames for extra smoothness, and initial speed (from standstill) is too sensitive so you end up launching like a dragster car. Both relate to human mode, the speedy ball I found easier to control for places it was designed for. Speaking as a keyboarder.

Huge map is littered with creative platforming puzzles and most were a joy to tackle and rewarding to complete. Rewards usually consist of coins and regular or quest items you can trade to eventually open passages to complete the story. All those are handled by simple and clean but descriptive inventory system.
It was fun to discover a higher jump mechanic mid-game completely by accident and then abuse it to reach forbidden ledges and shortcuts. Yeah I thought highly of myself for one-uping the game designer. It wasn't long before I found out that hidden areas and completionist puzzles actually rely on that same mechanic. And there I though I was smart.

Because of its size, map could use teleporter shortcuts at strategic places to reduce backtracking, or more than just two shortcuts. There exists a sort of another dimension map that does that sort of thing but it's a chore to navigate on PC (consoles have it easier) and it costs items that are limited in quantity each time you enter. In the end its usefulness it questionable in that will going out of your way to the entrance coupled with somewhat unknown exit coordinates end saving or loosing you time. Personally I avoided using it until the endgame when I had better idea how many trips I could afford.
Too add to that, map could use some kind of rudimentary notes system to remind you where you want to return. Not all such situations are handled by existing notification system. Minimalistic UI sure helps with Zen-like exploration but the tiny accumulated shortcomings do pull you back in the real world.

Dialogues improve greatly throughout Chapter 3 with hardly any nonsense despite map having many dozens of NPCs. Some just dump their irrelevant thoughts on you while others deepen character backstories and few deliver whole history and lore about the game world. You'll have to do some exploring to find those though. Carefully dotting them around the place helps to perceive it as a place that could actually exist. Only good games manage to pull that off.
Don't expect grandiose story or anything like that, it's practically a one man show after all. Boils down to: do this and that here and there to save the world kind of thing. Nothing spectacular about the destination but it's the journey that counts here.

虽然挂着“银河城”的标签，这货其实和传统的银河城类游戏有很大不同。主角没有新能力可以获取，度过短暂的相当于教学关的前两章之后，进入正篇的第三章，全部的操作方式就都交待给了玩家。相应的，地图中也没有需要新能力才能开启的通道，只要绕路开捷径就好。没有BOSS战，甚至没有任何真正意义上的战斗。玩家能做的就是在20+乘30+的巨大地图中探索，和形形色色的NPC对话，完成他们给的支线任务（收集物品、找人、送信等，本质上仍然是探索地图）。至于主线，也仅仅是跑到特定的6个地点敲钟。可以说，探索是唯一的乐趣所在，也是本作的精髓。

[h1]探索型玩家的乐园[/h1]
游戏可显示的地图有七八百格，加上隐藏地图应该近千格。不过地图虽大，跑起来却很轻松。在熟练结合变球弹跳和变人抓墙之后，开图过程宛如行云流水。看着一片漆黑的地图被一格一格揭开，对于探索型玩家来说，就像动作玩家玩无双割草游戏一样爽快。仅有少部分地图需要精密操作才能通过。此外，游戏还设置了一些额外成就，要求玩家到达指定位置或通过额外的挑战关卡，对操作的要求更加苛刻。整体而言，本作定位是休闲向的2D平台探索游戏，同时又在难度上保留了很高的可扩展性。游戏时长介于十几小时到几十小时之间，完全取决于你有多愿意发掘这个世界的边边角角。

游戏背景设定在人类灭亡之后的地下世界，展现了尼特（一种小矮人）、精灵、史莱姆等许多地下小型生灵的生存状态，他们中的各种派别，各自不同的信仰和主张。主角作为the chosen one，要按照预言的规定去敲响6个大钟，以免世界毁灭。主线剧情简单到令人发指，支线剧情也并不曲折，且相互之间没什么关联。叙事像很多公路片一样是碎片化的，不注重故事性，仅展示现象和世界观。主角本身是个哑巴，与主角同行的两个性格迥异的小精灵则担当了评论音轨的角色。随着流程的推进，两个小精灵的经历也渐渐浮出水面，她们性格中的拧巴和纠结也成了可供阅读的一部分。虽然游戏背景是架空的，各种理念和情感的碰撞却格外真实，从中可以体会到作者对纷繁复杂的现实世界的感受，他的理解和困惑，慈悲和愤世嫉俗，喜悦和孤独。从这个意义上来看，这款游戏是有灵魂的。

Each room (specifically in the open world portion of the game) is it's own mini challenge, as well. Will you tackle it slowly and methodically as the Knytt, or try to fly through it as the ball? The decision is yours, and this oftentimes creates multiple ways to play.

Anyway, I was not impressed with the rest of the game, either. The graphics are not good at all. There are decent backgrounds, but the platforms are really pixelated, and the character looks like a stickman with a most basic jump animation. I also did not like the timed / puzzle jumping sequences that seemed out of place here in this game setting.

This game really needed an early storyline to keep me interested, and it is really a shame this was given only a token effort. (The protagonist is conveniently a mute.) Over the first hour, there were just a couple very, very limited npc dialogs.

The droning background music loops is actually pretty good, but they do get repetitive after a while. The rest of the sounds are just okay, and sounds like the water splashing is a bit grating.

If you can get this game for a dollar, then sure check it out. Functionally it works and I did not have any crashes on ubuntu 18.10 with radeon drivers. The game has a 500MB install size.

[i]Knytt Underground[/i] is the 2013 sequel to [i]Knytt/Knytt Stories[/i], a couple of free flash games Nifflas made years beforehand. Those games were short, punchy, and kept you entertained throrough. [i]Knytt Underground[/i], however, does not.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]* Length[/b] - The game is actually [i]too long[/i]. [i]Knytt[/i] and [i]Knytt Stories[/i] were quick affairs, each screen offering a new challenge, each area a new dynamic. Underground, however, presents you with a [i]massive[/i], sprawling map - and no real content to fill it with. Add this to the rampant backtracking for every last little coin and rock, and 16 1/2 of my 17 hour(!!!) playthrough were drugingly dull.
[b]* Story/dialogue[/b] - The story seemed very forced, and the dialogue was ill-fitting to say the least - your two fairy sidekicks are constantly spewing expletives at each other and the other NPCs, the story seems to both take itself seriously but then also drop a ""Narrator: then the machine exploded, the end"" throughout - the entire experience was jarring.
[b]* Controls[/b] - Why a 2013 platformer doesn't support gamepads is beyond me. Yes, you can use Steam's Big Picture Mode to customize your pad to work in-game, but it's insulting that the player has to go to the added effort. Even with a gamepad, the game is still a chore to control - the jump button is also the climb button (default UP on keyboard), which makes fiddly platforming that much harder. The physics when in ball-form are fun to play with, and feel great once you've mastered them, but that doesn't make up for the shoddy overally controls.
[b]* Graphics[/b] - [i]Knytt[/i] and [i]Stories[/i] were cute pixelly games, and they had a set style. [i]Underground[/i] doesn't seem to be sure what it's going for - some areas are very reminiscent of the older games, some look like LIMBO, and others are a seeming mishmash of clipart. The character portraits are [i]abhorrent[/i], and do nothing to absorb the player into the already jarring story.
[b]* Audio[/b] - Not much to say here, but I quickly grew tired of the audio. It wasn't particularly [i]bad[/i] (barring one or two tracks), but having to listen to it for [i]so long[/i] grew monotonous quickly.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]* Stability[/b] - The game did not crash once for me throughout the entire run. No real bugs, no glitches, all in all a fantastically stable experience.
[b]* Difficulty[/b] - While the game itself was a boring slogfest through the same areas over and over again, the optional extra content (accessed through a strange maze that makes up the main menu) was amazingly fun - challenging but not unfair, quick and rewarding. I only wish as much could be said for the main game.

[h1]Overall:[/h1] [i]Underground[/i] seems to be a game trapped in the past - yet is somehow weaker than its predecessors.

I really loved playing through this game. 
It does well to recreate the same sense of wonder, scale and adventure. There is a huge map to explore and gorgeous zones and landscapes with different almost tangible atmosphere. 
The world created is beautiful, mellow, mostly silent and in places very dark and meditative. Seeing well crafted siluetted scenes of foleage swaying in the breeze is just stunning and very peaceful.
In terms of gameplay its an open world with items to collect, quests to do and well made jumping platformer type puzzles. It also has a lot of secret passages and areas. I always found it immensly rewarding when my meticulous exploration or jamping and timing skills gave me a bit more story, a puzzle and/or item to work out and collect.
It was frustrating at times and I did wonder if I would ever get the satisfaction of seeing an ending but got there with some perseverance.
To compare it to other 2d open world exploration games its like Ori and the Blind forest, VVVVVV, Fez, Cave story+, but it has its own unique character upgrades and game dynamics as well as art style and atmosphere.
Some things I didnt like as much: The player and NPC artwork didnt really gel with the overall mood for me it was a bit too cartoony against the siluetes and real life digitised background artwork.
I also thought the writing was pretty bad and 9 times out of 10 the attempts at humour fell flat for me. The whole story felt a little half baked if im honest. I loved the allusions to some apocolyptic disaster in the distant past sort of like the game Hyperlight Drifter and the items and coversations revolved around it. However while I found the game immensly satisfying for its stunning atmosphere and well thought out and executed challenges, I thought the ending was a bit of a cop-out and it ended too abruptly.

The story is just as contrasting and contradictory as the world. It is a carefully crafted exploration of Communication and Belief, and all of the challenges that this brings with it.

TLDR: No Xbox360 pad support. Too much waste of time puzzling out which way you can progress and where to come back later. Cliche story. No main menu, no options menu. 

Cliche protagonist that lost memory. Dialogue helps compensate for that somewhat. Map is button toggle and not on screen, but is well done easy to consult and motivates exploration. Sooner or later you will hit dead ends as you explore around, and you will also find strange power ups that alter movement or allow special one shot attacks. You only carry one power at once, and only one charge of said power. Power wears out over time usually barely longer than a screen's navigation. Game can become puzzle heavy in figuring out which pathways you have can mechanically progress through and which you have to come back to later which wastes your time needlessly. The footsteps sounds are strangely psychologically satisfying, climbing on walls is always easy to execute and you can tell at a glance which surfaces are scalable. The black foreground and colored light background art style has been done to death, but the implementation here does not hurt the game but I would not count it as a pro either. I remember playing this pretty far when I got this off bundle because I did not own a remote back then anyway and I was just starting out buying games. I had an okay time but spent way too long on the game. I feel like back then the movement of the protag were slower which means that in a couple generations this game might be broken with ultra fast movement. But it could just be my memory playing tricks on me. Now with the collection I have built I have no need for a remoteless metroidvania of this caliber.

I bought it 4 years or so ago, and completed it once back then, and once more now after finding all the secrets. This is an absolutely incredible game.

What makes it incredible? It utilises the full potential inherent in the platforming genre, with lots of cool movement sections, some interesting movement-altering abilities you pick up, and just overall tight controls and a well-designed world. The soundtrack is so good you'll be listening to it long after finishing the game (I certainly still do). As a nice bonus, if you enjoy speedrunning you'll find this game is perfect for it, which a built-in maze-like shortcut system called The Disorder which makes the any% category really wild.

Your character, Mi, can both walk around normally AND transform into a ball, which gives completely different movement possibilities. Travelling through the (enormous) map is never dull in Knytt Underground.

The map itself is a masterpiece. There are two sections before the main game, both of which are small sections of the main map (which you revisit in the main game). The trailer does a decent job of showcasing how atmospheric this game is but it doesn't show even a fraction of the epic-ness you feel traversing the all the little tunnels, both obvious and secret, while listening to relaxing and ambient soundtrack. If you get lost, there is a an actual 'map map' which shows you where you've been, where you need to go (to ring the bells for the main story) as well as where any save points are. As you play through it you feel like an explorer in a vast cave system, and that's what makes Knytt Underground so fun to play and play again - there's always something new.

Secrets are the core of what this game is. This is a game about exploration and surprise and it's got plenty. There are secrets WITHIN secrets and none of them are too hard to find. If you do the exploring, you WILL find them, but you'll probably never expect to find them where you do. Even when I began deliberately searching for any leftover secrets as I did this year, I still found myself laughing out loud at just where Nifflas had managed to hide them all.

TL/DR: If you love secrets and you love exploring, you WILL love this game. It has the best atmosphere of any game I've ever played in my entire life, and yes I DO mean that literally. If, however, you prefer games where everything is laid out clearly, or you particularly dislike secrets that have no clues attached to them, then this game is probably not for you.

Diría que no puedo recomendarlo, pero aún así hubo cosas que disfruté.

Creo que parte de mi molestia hacia este título es que destruye mucho de lo que sentó el Knytt original. Knytt era casual, relajante, abierto, sin más misión que recolectar piezas de tu nave que quedaron desperdigadas, en cualquier orden y casi sin ninguna limitante. 

Knytt Underground carga consigo historias, y por tanto, quiebra la sensación de mundo abierto. De hecho, gran parte de su escenario es subterráneo, privándonos de los bellos paisajes coloridos del exterior. Además, es que la historia ni siquiera es interesante. El autor del juego lo sabe y por eso se ríe de su misma historia todo el tiempo, colocando deus ex machina que intentan ser graciosos. Pero el jugador no se siente motivado a continuar casi en ningún momento.

Los personajes tienen diseños que bordean lo desagradable y todos son sumamente parecidos. Insisto, luego de experimentar la belleza del Knytt original, me siento un poco timado y/o decepcionado de que éste no haya seguido la misma línea y potenciado todo lo hermoso que tenía su predecesor.

El mapa es, creo, mucho más grande, pero tampoco da mucho placer recorrerlo. Ha perdido su colorido y sus diseños se sienten ligeramente repetitivos, además de que te restringe mucho.
El factor audio también está mucho más aminorado aquí.

Aparentemente, lo único ""bueno"" que el juego tiene son sus diálogos, pero sólo en cierto sentido. Es que son muy cómicos, y suelen romper la cuarta pared. Da risa leer lo que dicen los NPC. Y aún así, eso me deja insatisfecho: no me gusta ese humor en algo que lleve el nombre de Knytt.

I certainly enjoyed many aspects of the game, such as most of the design elements, as well as the soundtrack. 

However, I feel that there are also some issues that need to be pointed out here. 
First, the game is too long for what it is. While I do appreciate the designer’s efforts to create the large and diverse map, the gameplay does not really benefit from it. By the time I was about 75% through the game, I was already bored with it, to the extent that I almost didn't even have the motivation to finish the game. 
Second, the ball physics are rather frustrating. The ball is difficult to control with any degree of accuracy, and in many tasks that involve using the ball you basically have to rely on a serious dose of luck in order to get through. 
Which brings me to the third, and most important point. In many of game's puzzles, the solution can be fairly obvious. However, you then have to spend a significant amount of time repeating the same action numerous times, until you get everything lined up to the millimetre and the timing to the second, exactly as the developer intended - or else it won’t work, and you'd have to try again. This type of challenges is just not particularly interesting to me, as they are in no way intellectually stimulating. In fact, they are not fun or entertaining, but rather frustrating and annoying. 
Also worth mentioning is that in some areas of the map the soundtrack is bugged by various crackling and popping noises - I guess some of the soundtrack files might be corrupted.  
The ending is also kind of a letdown, to the extent that the developer himself admits it. Personally I expected that there might be another puzzle after the last bell, possibly involving the giant clock in the area right above it. But no - the ending is kind of abrupt, and basically  it leaves you with the sensation that something is missing - some kind of definitive conclusion, one way or the other. It is obvious that the dev left it that way on purpose, but what can I say - philosophy and entertainment don't mix particularly well. 

Anyway, the game is not perfect, but despite its flaws it would be difficult not to recommend it. Most of the artwork in the game is beautiful, and creates a special atmosphere that is worth experiencing. Chances are, you will enjoy it, at least up to a point.

While most of his games tend to have a similar gameplay style, they are always enjoyable and have an amazing aesthetic.

Knytt Underground is one part ""Within A Deep Forest"", one part ""Saira"", and one part ""Knytt"". The simple platforming and exploration gameplay of Knytt is merged with the harder, physics-based platforming from WADF and is then set in a world using surreal photo-realistic environments akin to Saira.

This all produces a massive, metroid-vania-like, ambient, exploration platformer that is easy to get lost in. It is not afraid to crank up the difficulty in a few areas to keep you on your toes, but the whole map is incredibly non-linear so you are rarely forced to go through a section when you first come to it. This game is essentially one huge scavenger hunt, but it never feels like a chore, even when you are backtracking through areas you have already been to. There are quite a lot of secrets as well, many of which provide the hardest sections of the game and are completely optional.

I honestly cannot remember much from the plot apart from having to ring 4 bells, but this game left a lasting impression in the memories of simply exploring the beautiful and serene world along to the ambient, relaxing soundtrack.

Exploramos un enorme mundo post-humanidad halucinado de forma totalemente libre (una vez pasados los dos primeros cortos capítulos que son una introducción tanto al mundo y sus habitantes como a las capacidades del personaje), incarnando a una chica que debe llebar a cabo una quest cutre para salvar el mundo, porque así lo dice su religión extraña. ¿O será que de verdad estamos salvando el mundo?

Estarás acompañada por dos hadas, una de muy mala leche y totalement increyente, la otra demasiado amable para su propio bién y totalement devota, las dos muy cabeza dura. Darán lugar a muchas discusiones divertidas (nuestra prota es muda, y debemos escojer cual de las dos hadas se encargará de hablar por ella en cada encuentro con un personaje) y invitarán más de una vez a reflexionar sobre variados temas.

Aúnque de lejos el juego parezca el típico metroidvania, este difiere en que no se obtienen ni necesitan upgrades para progresar (puedes transformarte en bola para botar hacia donde quieras o puedas, y al absorber flores de distintos colores ganas durante unos secundos un movimiento especial que te servirá a resolver el puzle del mometo). Puedes ir por donde te da la gana, pero aconsejaría ser metódico ya que el sistema de ""viaje rápido"" es muy peculiar y un enigma en sí (no digo más!).

A diferencia de sus predecesores, pone cierto énfasis en contar una historia aparentemente sencilla, pero que esconde muchísimos matices y abundantes pinceladas de ambigüedad y surrealismo. 

Ambos aspectos -el jugable y el argumental- difieren bastante de lo que se espera de un videojuego de estas características (irónicamente, tomados por separado, tanto el diseño de ciertos niveles como la progresiva complejidad en su ritmo serán un marco relativamente conocido para los veteranos). A pesar de sus referencias plataformeras obvias, de su apuesta descarada por la exploración libre y del tono socarrón y melancólico de sus diálogos, es difícil no dejarse seducir por sus encantos; más aún a medida que pasan las horas y el trasfondo del mundo y sus personajes se desarrollan.

En definitiva, si te gusta el género y quieres probar algo distinto, deberías dejar de leer y hacer de Knytt Underground una de tus compras prioritarias. 

[h1]Capas sobre capas[/h1]

Cuando empecé a interesarme por el desarrollo de videojuegos independientes (allá por el 2008), fueron 3 los títulos que me arrastraron a la marea -por aquel entonces en ebullición- del que hoy es un mercado sobresaturado, rebosante de ideas y creatividad ignoradas. Uno de esos 3 títulos fue Knytt Stories: el diseño gráfico, la música, su jugabilidad sobria... todo en él me dejó fascinado. Desde entonces, he seguido de cerca las creaciones de Nifflas, así que no tardé demasiado en lanzarme a por su continuación, Knytt Underground.

¿Qué puedo decir? Si conoces el resto de juegos de Nifflas, Underground tendrá un valor añadido. Hay muchas referencias a la mitología de los capítulos anteriores, incluso al olvidado Within a deep forest, que en cierta forma se fusiona con el universo Knytt de un modo mucho más visceral en esta secuela.

Sea como fuere, este plataformas atípico esconde muchísimo más de lo que deja entrever en sus primeros minutos. En realidad, si se le dedica el tiempo necesario, resulta evidente que su ritmo lento, sus picos de dificultad y su gigantesca red de túneles y zonas ocultas no son más que un vehículo estilizado para dar lustre a varias ideas y obsesiones del autor. Aunque predomina la exploración, hay constantes virajes hacia el plataformeo con mala leche y hacia una evocadora narrativa agridulce. Es posible, sin embargo, que este ritmo irregular eche para atrás a los que se dejen engañar por las apariencias y crean que van a encontrar una aventura de desarrollo clásico. 

Personalmente, creo que su mayor logro es desafiar todo tipo de convenciones. Los lugares comunes de las mecánicas jugables se ponen en tela de juicio con frecuencia: se nos invita a completar misiones que en última instancia no parecen servir para nada; tratamos con individuos extraños que nos engañan, timan o dan al traste con nuestras expectativas; pasillos ocultos bien escondidos que no llevan a ningún sitio, entrelazados con otros que llevan a zonas extrañas y hermosas. Y es que si algo llama la atención de la excentricidad reinante, es la superabundancia de recovecos y engaños: ¿crees que has encontrado todos los secretos de una zona? Mira otra vez, seguro que te llevas una sorpresa.

Creo que Nifflas acabó creando una obra personal inclasificable, que probablemente sea prejuzgada por su ritmo pausado e inconexo. Creo también que cualquier jugador puede llegar a apreciar su belleza y sus intenciones, si le dedica el tiempo que requiere.

TL:DR

+Diseño gráfico y sonoro brillante.
+Largo, plagado de capas y secretos.
+Argumento y personajes principales atípicos e interesantes.
+Libertad total para explorar cualquier zona, desde el comienzo del capítulo principal.
+Relación calidad-contenido/precio sensacional

(And if you haven't, Within A Deep Forest and Knytt Stories are both freeware, so go play them). And I don't just say that because your characters control like the two from those games. However, this is not just ""more of the same"", and does see him treading new ground.

Gameplay is exploration heavy and very atmospheric. Many areas have puzzles or hazards like enemies and lava, and in some cases (mostly in secret levels) those can be quite difficult. However, those are not the focus of the game, and many other areas there's only platforming or even no obstacles at all. You don't gain permanent powerups, but areas may have objects that give you temporary abilities. Emphasis is on the scenary and atmosphere instead, and on the story.

Yes, the story. And that's the new ground: The story here is very good. You spend most of the game with two companions with layered personalities and backstories, and can choose which one of them will talk for you with most NPCs. As you explore you'll uncover more of their backstory along with the mute protagonist's. The story defies a lot of genre conventions; quests don't always end in a way the characters find satisfying (though they usually do), people are occasionally unable or unwilling to compensate you, and ultimately a lot of doubt is cast on the claim that your quest to ""save the world"" is actually doing anything. Combined with the unusual backstories and themes, it is a pretty unique experience.

The game becomes extremely nonlinear once you beat the introductory chapters. You can explore in any direction as far as you want, and the world is huge, but if you want you can ""beat"" the game before seeing huge portions of it. There's also tons of secret rooms and levels, both within the game world and accessible from exploring the menu/hub world.

These games, created by a lone developer called Nifflas (also of NightSky and Saira fame), are some of the finest exploration-based platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Knytt Underground is the most recent in the series, and while it might be the most ambitious, it makes some unexpected departures from the previous games.

You know you're in for something special when the game loads straight to a tutorial that turns out to be the main menu. There are three chapters in Knytt Underground, though the first two are essentially introductions to the massive third. You play both as Mi Sprocket, a mute little sprite, and Bob, a sentient bouncing ball from another early Nifflas game, Within a Deep Forest. Together they embark on a grand journey through the underground of a post-apocalyptic Earth far more mysterious and colorful than anything you've seen in Fallout. The surfaces you traverse are all shown in silhouette but the backgrounds are vibrant, animated collages of Photoshopped worlds. Every alien landscape you can imagine is represented here, with enormous gardens, crystal caves, blasted deserts, crumbling temples, ominous graveyards, and sinister machinery among them.

While you have a massive, massive map to explore, don't confuse this with a metroidvania. Mi and Bob never gain new abilities to navigate with, though their own basic skills provide a wealth of options. Mi can climb walls and Bob can bounce, and switching freely between the two allow you to pull of some surprising maneuvers. There are also colored seeds that grant Mi a one-time power like flying in a straight line, and robots that Bob can tether to. Creative use of these resources can indeed get you anywhere you need to go, no matter how impossible the passage seems. The result is almost like a puzzle game, where you'll find rooms that look like they need special powers to traverse, but eventually you'll have that eureka moment and puzzle it out yourself.

You'll have tons of items to find as well, and the denizens of the underground give quests that'll reward you with what you need or point you in the right direction. These items are used to pass the gates barring your ultimate objective, but there's some welcome flexibility to the collecting. One gate might require 5 items out of a possible set of 8, and if you find some of the game's well-hidden coins you can substitute them as well. This means you'll never get stuck on a particular puzzle for a single item, and exploration will always reward you with something you can use.

Previous Knytt games had stark pixel graphics and a distinct sense of isolation to them. Nifflas often populates his strange and alien worlds with little harmless critters but not sentient creatures, usually leaving you alone to explore the vast spaces in solitude. Knytt Underground is a sharp departure here, adding not only loads of characters to talk and deal with, but also giving them incredibly unexpected personalities. Everyone speaks with modern sensibilities, almost like irreverent sitcom characters. They'll call out their own foibles and contrivances, and denigrate a lot of your quests as pointless busywork. One of your two pixie companions is also as foul-mouthed as you can imagine, frequently telling people to go fuck themselves and eat glass and such. It's such a weird departure in tone from the previous games, even moreso in how their hideous, blobby portraits clash with the clean lines of the rest of the game.

The NPCs are the only major knock against an otherwise atmospheric experience, and to be fair, seeing their character arcs through redeems the worst offenders. Even on top of the 10+ hours of exploration the game offers, there are a host of secrets to find. Some are tied up in the game's unique and challenging fast travel system which I won't spoil, but be aware there's no easy teleporting around the enormous map until you master it. Just like the rest of the game, though, it's worth putting the time into to experience. Knytt Underground is a marvelous journey from start to finish, one that's easy to immerse in and immensely rewarding to play.

Brilliant Sound design, fitting music, intelligent dialogue, addictive gameplay, and a massive world to explore that's handled expertedly.[/b]

I'm in love with this game, when I first got it I knew that I was going to love it. The sounds, the music, the backgrounds, the art, the gameplay, the characters, everything! It just feels so thought out like a giant complete puzzle. As such, I'll be going into detail about things that make this game great, and also replying to the most Popular Negative Reviews here on Steam. 

Gameplay -- The most important thing in any game is of course how it plays. And Knytt Underground plays execellently. It's an entirely physics based platformer with neat power-ups that don't make you stronger, but instead allows you to navigate in different ways to get past obstacles. There's also a transformation that turns Mii Sprocket (The muted character you play as) to become a bouncey ball, where you can bounce up to high places. This transformation is entirely physics based, and it's damn accurate! It's very addictive. 

Exploration -- Chapter 1 and 2 of the game are basically Introductions to the World, Tutorials, and the primary characters. Chapter 3 is where the training wheels are removed and you're allowed to freely explore an underground world of massive size with varying environments and hundreds, thousands of secrets to discover. There's even secrets in the main menu! 

Themes -- Probably the second most important thing in games, at least in my opinion. Here in Knytt Underground you have some pretty serious themes that you have to stop and think about, they also reflect the Modern World in a way or too. Religion, Atheism, Emotional trauma and finding happiness in the little things play a major key in the story and even gameplay in the form of quests. ""Hey! You're that Sprocket Explorer kid, right? I don't suppose you could help me by going up into some dangerous caves to fetch me my dead Brother's skull? I need to complete his grave. He blew up, you see. In a nasty dangerous awful accident-- blah blah blah blah~"" Dialogue is usually like that, except that you can reply, in an interesting way... 

Artistic Themes -- The literal themes of the game are very pretty, sometimes dark, and othertimes just bizarre. There's some characters who look like a Child drew them, othertimes there's characters who look batshote crazy, but each is charming in their own way. I love how there's basically zero limitations to the amount of characters you'll find. A weird monkey creature and can speak fluent English? Yup. A 6-inch high Ninja Warrior who wishes to kill you? Yup. A literal blob that's just chillin' around toxins? You bet'cha!

Dialogue -- There's hundreds of different and unique characters in Knytt with who you can interact with and even alter their futures, past sometimes as well! However, being the Mute Video-Game-Protagonist, you can't talk, you can certainly think, but never talk except for dreams. Instead you have to find two Fairies, a Moon Fairy called Cillia and a Sun Fairy called Dora. Their elements reflect their personalities. Cillia is dark, sarcastic, and down-to-earth, emotionally limited on the outside. Dora is the opposite, a bright optimist who's willing to give everyone a chance, but has a very dark past, and most likely a dark future. The dialogue for every character is usually really well written and is light-hearted at times, and dead-serious at other times. There's a secret where you find a Dead Body and you have to learn about the Dead Body's past, pretty grim stuff. 

Interactivity -- To interact with this world's characters, you must send out two of your fairies; Cilia and Dora. Black and White. Moon and Sun. Negative and Positive. So you're limited between being Negative and Positive with your response, very black and white. There's no middle line, no silver lining, no inbetween that you can pick. Instead the characters of the world which you interact with are the Grey between these two choices. There's no perfect person in the world of Knytt Underground, they are realistic with the fact that they have problems and personality traits unique to them. So it's up to you to decide how to deal with them. Your choice will affect other outcomes and Cilia and Dora themselves. Pick Dora too much and Cilia will feel like she's a third-wheel. Pick Cilia too much, and Dora won't think that you're too good of a person. Not even Cilia and Dora are perfect at what they represent, Dora can be mean, while Cilia can sometimes be nice. Very realistic and solid. 

Sound Design and Design in general -- I'll start off with Design in general. There's no Main Menu, instead you play through the menu and enter different path ways, it can take up a little too much time, but it's very pretty to look at and is always a good way to prepare you for your saved game. Sound Design is brilliant! It's super crisp quality that's authentc from the sounds of waterfalls, to mechanical robots, to the sounds of magical chimes. 

Story -- I won't give away any spoilers, but you're an Explorer called Mi Sprocket of the Sprocket Family. You have been chosen to save the world by serving a Religion called Myriadism, where they believe in a God and have no respect for technology that was left over by Humans. Also forgot to mention that it's set after Humanity has killed itself, so the surface is a no-go, thus Knytt UNDERGROUND. Then there's the Internet, where they believe that the Human's technology is God-Like in design and activation, they value technology, but don't care too much about life of others. The Story is often interrupted and recapped to you by Nicklas, the developer and creator of the Knytt Series where he breaks the fourth-wall quite often. He's a really chill and cool guy in real life, and his personality and wall-breaking comments don't ruin the flow of the game. 

Music -- The Musical Musicsky Musics of Knytt Underground are really relaxed and really fit well. There's a few songs which I dislike, but they did fit their environment. Some of the secret musical pieces are pretty repetitive since in their context they were just 10-second loops and entirely optional and don't impact the game in any big way. 

Difficulty -- Chapter's 1 and 2 are very easy as they're tutorials. But some of the puzzles and platforming in Chapter 3 are really frocking tough, and sometimes will take at least an hour to nail down. But being such a large world, you can usually always skip through the platforming and puzzles via a secret path or completing certain quests. 

Replayability -- I've never really heard of a replayable 2D Platformer before, except for maybe Mario Maker, but that's not really a game. But I've replayed Knytt Underground a few times now. A typical playthrough, focusing just on story takes roughly 5 hours. Filling up the map of each chapter, roughly 15 hours. 100 percenting that playthrough takes around 50 hours. 

Modability and Community -- Since Knytt Underground is such an underrated and hidden gem in Steam, the community is small and inactive, likewise is the modding community. Infact, there's little to no mods, nothing major at least. 

TIME TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!
-- 
""The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art""
This is to avoid distracting the tight platforming. 
--
Nitpicks -- I always go against Nitpicking, but for a masterpiece which is claimed by many or myself, I will point out issues. There's very little impactful nitpicks in Knytt, thankfully, but there is some. When you transform into the ball, you can sometimes bounce at the very top of slanted edges, but this can be dismissed as being on purpose. Realistically, the same thing would happen.",1453728877,1453728877,True,17,0,0.604621350765228271,1,False,False,False,False,,,

There are a lot of ideas here, but I think the story-telling in particular didn't work out.  The stories were so spread out and so jumbled over the many hours of play, it was difficult to necessarily remember characters from time to time as they came up.  Even with the three protagonists, this was a problem, as I couldn't always recall what details were true of which one.  

The second thing that didn't work out was the warp zones.  The entries to them were so spread out, and the exits not marked on the map at all.  So it always seemed better not to use them and walk straight to where I was going, rather than possibly walk the same distance and break a crystal.

What is great is the feeling that you are exploring a real space.  This isn't an over map and castles, everywhere is connected to everywhere else, there are no barriers.

There are also some quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces, with music that wonderfully accompanies them.

And as in Knytt, the pitter patter of the running and jumping is very satisfying.

Finally, I have not idea why this game is M-rated.  Because one of the characters is a lesbian?  I find making a game M-rated simply because lesbians exist extremely offensive.",1453185756,1453188604,True,0,0,0.456062942743301392,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is much more of an exploration game than a puzzle one: it is not the destination that matters here but the journey itself, and there are dozens and dozens of secrets scattered around just waiting to be found, the characters are also surprisingly fun and well-written, and some puzzles very cleverly crafted.

However its story and characters come with some unexpected surprises which you'll probably find off-putting, while late-game can get tedious with lengthy backtracking.

This game has left me with very mixed feelings, but my overall enjoyment still outweighs the frustrations and disappointments. For the measely $5 there's plenty of quality content even if you ignore the main story.


[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]FANTASTIC PLATFORMING.[/b]
If there's something Nifflas is good at - it's creating fun, responsive and challenging platforming with great stage design and interesting mechanics to go with it.

[*] [b]HUGE WORLD.[/b]
1440 unique rooms in the main story alone, not even including indoor areas or any of the extra content. That's impressive. Admittedly, many of them offer nothing beyond a pretty scenery, but plenty of others provide fun challenges and secrets to spice up your quest.

[*] [b]ATMOSPHERE.[/b]
Game's massive world is filled with distinct areas and landmarks, surrounded in pretty glowing colors and over 100 tracks of fitting music. All this combines into an overall serene, beautiful and mysterious feeling. Just getting from point A to point B can be a very zen experience.

[*] [b]EXTRA CONTENT.[/b]
Main story is actually only about two-thirds of the content. Another big chunk is stashed inside all sorts of hidden areas, even in the main menu and credits. Extra content includes short story levels, silly stuff, rhythm-platforming, easter eggs, and pure rock-hard challenges.
[/list]


[h1]THE BAD:[/h1] 
[list]
[*] [b]HUGE WORLD.[/b]
The world is perhaps too big for its own good. Backtracking gets dull after a while and game's ""fast travel"" system is so contrived and inconvenient that it's often easier to just walk. Many areas are there just for the scenery, which some of you will find atmospheric while others will see it as boring filler.

[*] [b]CHARACTERS & WRITING.[/b]
The biggest shocker for me. I was expecting a weird fairy tale, akin to Nifflas' other games. Instead I got angsty teen drama complete with swearing, daddy issues, ""it's complicated"" relationships and more. 
While there is some interesting character development, the characters themselves act like they're from a completely different game.
[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352485410]This[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352488175]this[/url] screenshot sum it up (spoiler free).

[*] [b]STORY & QUESTS.[/b]
The game pushes the idea that ""it's not about the destination - it's about the journey"", and it shows. Story and quests are simplistic and not really something to get excited about. The real ""story"" is exploring the world and learning about its inhabitants by completing their little errands, and just enjoying the exploration. Don't get your hopes up for the big reveal - that's not what the ""journey"" is about and the game will make sure to remind you. (tip: if you're underwhelmed by the ending - one of the bonus levels does offer some closure).

Also the game never explains where the ball character came from, what it is, or what's its purpose. Even other characters don't seem to notice its presense. If you played Nifflas' other game - ""Within a Deep Forest"" - you'll know a bit about the ball's past, but present and future still remain a mystery.[/list]",1450994594,1512450317,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

With past experience playing both Knytt and NightSky, you could be forgiven for saying that KU is something of a midway point between the two, with the sprite design of the former and background and atmosphere of the latter.

The controls take a bit of getting used to, but are eventually smooth and fluid and make for a lot of moments that make the player feel like a badass. There is a bit of flab in the plot, and I eventually defaulted to skipping the majority of the dialogue, but there's something innately satisfying about exploring, pulling off jumping puzzles, and finding all the little nooks and crannies in the map that would otherwise go unexplored. The tone isn't too light-hearted but also(thankfully) doesn't feel the need to take itself seriously, and the background design has this amazing, almost Pikmin-esque quality to it that looks incredible.


EDIT: I wrote this review right as I was beginning to explore the full map that's revealed to the player a fair bit into the game. I will say that the map is kind of ridiculously huge, and the fetchquests get way, way too numerous to care about or keep track of. Also, something I failed to mention in the beginning is that the sprites look pretty odd, and it doesn't seem to be a stylistic choice. In-game character sprites all have this very weird look to them that makes it hard to take any serious moments seriously.

+ Beautiful atmospherical graphics. Just look at those screenshots. 
+ Nice music as well. No wait, the music is awesome, and so is the sound design. 
+ Very simple but fun, tight mechanics. 

~ Don't expect any kind of deep emotional storyline. It's cute and funny at times and there is some (actually quite some) intruiging lore to try to make sense of, but the way it's conveyed didn't work quite enough for me, personally. I would have loved a bit more of immersive style of writing, the wit of the dialogues pull me out of it too much. Or rather they fail to draw me in.

- Unfortunately the fixed resolution is kinda low, especially on a 27"" monitor. I have played this before on the PS Vita (one of my favorite games on that platform) and there it looks pretty clean and sharp. Not as much now, although it's still pretty enough to get fully immersed in. So arguably the PC is not the best way to play this game, maybe. Maybe.


Having said that I would nevertheless heartily recommend this game for anyone fond of 2D platforming world exploration kind of games.

Do you like platformers? If so, buy this game. If not, buy this game anyways.[/h1]

Knytt Underground is, by and large, one of the best 2D platformers available on the PC. 

The game has beautiful environments, an excellent soundtrack and level ambience that can put sites like asoftmurmur.com to shame. Simply put, it's therapeutic to the nth degree. The platforming is simply top notch with ([i][b]no exaggeration[/b][/i]) perfect, 1:1 controls and level design that can get pretty nintendo hard at times. The 'overworld' itself is freaking massive - and like any other Nifflas game, it's packed to the brim with secrets. You [i]will[/i] miss secrets on your first playthrough, guaranteed.

However, KU is not without its faults. One [b]terribly massive[/b] con - no native controller support. It's very easy to work around this, (try [i]ControllerToKeyboard[/i] for Windows, [i]Enjoyable[/i] for OSX, or [i]qJoyPad[/i] for Linux) but you'd think for a PC platformer it would come with partial support at the very least. There is also a surprising amount of dialogue for such a game, but you're really not missing much if you skip through all of it. If you're capable of reading a minimap, you can skip through all the dialogue you want.",1437377009,1437377073,True,7,1,0.588138461112976074,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Knytt Underground is a platformer with puzzle mechanic. Most of the time these puzzles are simple.  switch between 2 forms (human for climbing, and ball for bouncing) and  use ""right one-use-power"" at the right time to get to hard to reach places.
 
The thing is some solutions are not so simple and not very obvious on first sight so you might end up trying to go around some areas ... often leaving you in this ""what the fudge"" state. That made me use a uncovered map i found on google :P.  And made me revisit most of the areas and try to ""re-reach"" areas if there was some hidden passage. And belive me there are lots of them. But there are also areas only accessible if you uncover lore about characters. Just do every quest you find(or events marked as ""?""), so dont get frustrated if you cant reach something now.

First two chapters are more of a tutorial short and simple. Real challange is chapter 3 wich is HUGE, map covers WHOLE SCREEN. played almost 20 hours of it to reach to the end (i started to use uncovered map after having about half of the map reveald and it had lots of uncovered holes).

There is this teleporting mechanic wich lets you teleport across the map but i havent use it ... cause i didnt know how so i ignored it.

In overal the game is challenging. ESPECIALLY if you plan to unlock all steam achevements. so if you are aiming for that i suggest reading steam community walkthroughs cause there is one achevement you get for ""not paying bell guards for entrence"" wich i did unfortunately.  

Other reviews state that dialogues are bad ... well maybe because this world is confusing, maybe that was the aim for the creators to make strange relations between races while engaging in some dificult topics about main characters. Depends on personal tastes . I didnt find them that bad. Some funny more or less. (there is even one adult joke but i wont spoil it :P)

Background pictures are amazing. Music is calm and pleasing. For adventurer LOTS of secrets to uncover. 

In overall its a average game, good choice if you have nothing to play, Would be nice addicion for a mobile game.(there would be problem with implementing chapter 3 world map).

I ""kind of"" liked it.

It is the sort of thing that you can play for ten or fifteen minutes and feel like you accomplished something, or intend to play for an hour and find yourself still playing after four.

The ball mechanics are as close to perfect as you can find in a game.  Importantly, there is some ability for course correction mid-air, so you are not bound to just ricocheting around based only on your bounce.  And the transformation mechanic lets you move in ways that neither the sprite nor the ball could alone.

The core of the game is exploration.  Puzzles are usually “how do I get there from here?” and typically aren’t more than four or six rooms.  They are spread about often enough to be interesting, yet sparse enough that at no time does it feel like you just completed a difficult challenge only to be rewarded with a harder one, and in fact almost always do reward you.  The rewards vary from inventory items (which may be quest related) to story exposition, and sometimes earthquakes that open up new paths elsewhere.

Death is mostly non-punishing, typically at most it resets you to the last safe position you were in, which is usually in the room you are currently in.  If you collected an item just before dying, it does not reset the item.  That said, you do have to then make it to a save point to keep the progress after leaving the game.

Mi, the character, is mute.  When you have a conversation with an NPC, you can choose if you want your friends Dora or Cilla to answer for you.  Dora is generally going to give an optimistic or positive answer, while Cilla tends to be cynical if not mean.  But they can and will also surprise you.

While I very much enjoyed this game, the experience was certainly heightened by having played the developer’s previous games, which are not currently available on Steam.  I think it stands alone well, however there are many references to several other games (including ones for both Knytts and the Ball) that were very cool for those in the know.

As much as a third of the game’s rooms are hidden off-map.  Some are short or long challenges or even just “easter eggs” accessible from secret paths accessible from the chapter select area - hidden in secret tunnels.

Also please note the rating!  Cila in particular can be quite vulgar, and both of the fairies have histories that might be surprising and a bit colorful.  

I do recomend this game!

The Knytt franchise at this point has gained a good bit of history.  Underground's predecessors might even be older than some of the folks reading this review.  Fortunately, they are all available on the developer's website, free of charge.  Since 2006, I've played them many times; seriously, they're some of the most charming games out there.  If you're on the fence about this title, look up Nifflas and give Knytt Stories a test drive - you won't regret it.

Knytt Underground is a game of simple two-dimensional platforming and exploration, broken up into three chapters.  The first two chapters are short mini-stories introducing your characters - one, a humanoid who can scramble up walls, and the other, a strange ball with elastic properties.  The third chapter is the main draw, and has the two main characters join forces to accomplish a great quest.  The quest itself is basically a series of mini-fetch-quests, but that hardly matters.  The fun comes from exploring the enormous, intricate map.  Level design seems relatively minimalist, but the gradual change from region to region, and the charming, easter-egg like decorations on every screen are the real reward.  Expect a lot of soft, ambient lights, soothing sounds and music, and a satisfying, effortless grace to your navigation.  There's no frustration here, and navigation is pure joy.

If you're coming for hardcore gaming, I'd stay away; this is not that game.  Also, don't expect much in terms of story; Underground has inexplicably included a couple of fairies to join you on your grand adventure; neither of them are very interesting, none of the dialogue is well-written, and one of them has a penchant for dropping F-bombs, detracting from the family-frendliness of the game.  It's kept to a minimum, though, so it's not enough to detract from such a joyful exploration experience.  Give the original Knytt games a go, and if you love them as much as I do, go ahead and get this, too.  Support this developer.  This is every bit as good as I was hoping, and I would love to keep revisiting this series for a long time to come.",1421809770,1421809770,True,2,0,0.535370469093322754,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Knytt Underground is one of my favourite games that I have played this year, totally unexpectedly. I came into this thinking I'd mess around on it for half an hour but what I found is one of the most deep and immensely enjoyable puzzle exploration 'complete the map' games I have ever played. I can't really explain it, but I found the mechanics really fun and easy to get the hang of yet difficult to master and the game has an unexplainable charm to it that I haven't found in many other games this year. Initially in the first two chapters the game seems small and limited, but this is simply a tutorial or prologue if you will to the massive chapter 3 which is when the whole game's map opens up. It's addictive to try and discover and explore each of the grids in the game's map system and to discover the secret and story behind each area. Many areas involve puzzles which make use of enemies and hazards and the game's climbing and jumping mechanics to solve, and the ability to *SPOILER* transform into a ball and use momentum to bounce and reach previously unreachable areas *SPOILER* which is fun in itself.

It's one of the games that looks simple and low-budget and to an extent it is, but it also has this deceptively deep story and an incredible atmosphere and soundtrack which to me at least is one of the hardest but most important elements of a game to get right. 

To say go play this game and see for yourself isn't very helpful I know, but it really is something that you need to play to understand the points I'm making.

[i]Design[/i]: 
The graphics in this game are extremely cleverly made. The highlighting of important things are a good guide through the game, while the real setting is rather introvert but very beautiful. The athmosphere of the game is keeping up the whole time from the very first until the last second of the game. Even though it kind of remings me of Braid, it is still it's own in a kinda way. [b]8/10[/b]

[i]Music & Audio[/i]: 
While the audio is deeply integrated to the game, the music is kind of lost. Long phases without music playing in the background are taking the fun of the game, but when the music plays, it is very breathtaking and keeps up the morale. [b]8/10[/b]

[i]Gameplay & Addiction[/i]: 
Besides that forced humor that is kind of annoying, the story of this game is told very great and is worth as much as the original Knytt. The gameplay is familiar and very clear, even though the level designs feel like labyrinths sometimes, but that's good. The long and sometime difficult levels are very fine and provide a lot of gamefun and playing hours. [b]7/10[/b]

[i]Cost-Benefit Equation & resumé[/i]: 
This is truely a great sequel to the platformer that will take your breath. A kind of funny told story that is worth it's money. The gaming duration is worth it, if you like to play interactive stories. Who cares about books? Play Knytt. [b]7/10[/b]

[b]For the cheap price of 6.99€ (1.99€ in sale at the moment!) you get more than you can ask. Sell some of your useless DotA2/TF2/CS:GO stuff and buy this game.[/b]

The platforming and puzzle elements are generally quite fun and  challenging. Challenging, but never to the point that I lost my shit. This is partly due to the fact that I spent much of my time simply exploring it's brilliant world and talking to the interesting, amusing, and complex characters.
 The art style is absolutely brilliant, and mostly consists of black sillhouette foregrounds, cartooney characters and backgrouns made of photos of various things like rocks and flowers, and such, pieced together in interesting ways.
 The music is often times quite trippy and kind of melancholy, which really adds to the lonely atmosphere of the game. It's surprising that a game about sprites and fairies in a post-apocalyptic world, could have some of the most realistic, and  deep characters of any game I've ever played.

It's also about life after us. The little buggers who built their civilization on whatever garbage we left behind seem to be doing just fine, impending doom notwithstanding. Vexing, but hardly surprising.

But, at its heart, what Knytt Underground is really about is an impossibly large map.
Man, that thing is big. There's about 1,500 screens in the main world, and there is even a little extra hidden beyond the boundaries.

This is not quite a metroidvania -- your ""verbs"" are limited to jumping, bouncing and the occasional single-use power-up used for the trickier platforming puzzles (firing one shot, double jump, limited flight ability). A lot of the Nifflas experience is going through vast areas with no real challenges, taking the scenery in. All the same, it's not just a stroll in the park: there are also tricky jumps, shortcuts and hidden passages galore. While your palette of actions is limited, the controls are tight enough that this is all doable on a keyboard.

The backgrounds in this game are pretty, even if they're mostly saturated pictures of nature. Character portraits are kind of goofy. As for the writing, it can be grating in an indie games kind of way, but it's just self-aware enough to land on the ""charmingly quirky"" end of the spectrum.

Knytt Underground looks like a small and cute trifle with nothing but a cool photo-collage backgrounds paired with primitive art-style and rather abstract jokes. And it ends with explosions, quite literally. Well, at least the author inserts himself into the game to tell you this in person. First two short chapters (out of three, mind you) don’t look like much. The player is introduced to the base mechanics, of which there aren't really a lot of: you can jump, climb any vertical wall, transform yourself into a big rubber ball (this particular one can be seen only in demo-level, which is included along first two chapters and has its complete separate level) and gain access to higher jumps. Occasionally you can collect a one-time-use-power-up which looks like glowing flower bud; and most of the time this “special ability” is nothing more than some fancy high jump or short free-fly-mode for getting where you couldn’t just climb up, because the wall isn’t completely even.

So I was ready to write it off with I a notion “I certainly understand why it’s so highly praised on indie scene, but…”. But then the third chapter happened. Forty minutes later, when I was realising in panic that I haven’t seen even 10% of the map and found a single save point, I realised I got into the rabbit hole; what I didn’t know is, that it would turn out to be a truly amazing adventure. The seem-to-be-obvious primary purpose of “just following the story” is being crushed by the enormous world size. You don’t really know the right path, there’s a lot of obstacles and, finally, the path to the story points is blocked by some treasure-hungry NPCs; so you have to wander off. And that’s where it becomes firstly mysterious, then great, and finally, near the end, obvious. You didn’t come here to just play it through. You’ve come here as a discoverer of sorts. The one that boldly steps into the unknown and makes a map of the journey; all this quite literally: the world is divided into a familiar grid of separate screens and there’s no telling what will you see in the next one for most of the time. The game also acknowledges this fact without a single doubt: formal purpose is what it is — formality, cause for an adventure.

So what did I discover here? I found a whole surrealistic underground world inhabited by sprites and fairies, who barely remember the history of this world, but call themselves strange names, like “The Internet”. They remember though the catastrophic events of war waged by humans, that ended with the world being reduced to these scattered survivors, living in ruins, holding mystic beliefs and treating leftover household items from pre-war times as magical powerful artefacts. And yet these folks have enough in them to give you a good reason for watching them in natural habitat, exploring their lives and getting from them pieces of history. It will never, though, become clear what really happened. You didn’t really expect that from a game, which literally is dedicated to uncertainty and meaning of seeming obscure final goal? Yep, that’s it, fourth wall is a regular punchbag here.

Aside from the cryptic story and chilling ambience of the scenery, there’s more too. The gameplay makes a sudden skyrocketing, shifting from “mindless jumping” to “carefully solving puzzles with jumps”; and not only with jumps. Rubber ball form now becomes useful not only for jumping higher, but for doing all kinds of tricks. Those simple power-ups now require planning before their usage. One wrong move — and at best you’ll have to try again, sometimes dying from contact with molten lava or not-so-friendly-robot laser beam. And that’s not worst that could happen, sometime you’ll fail so bad, you’ll fall to the other screen; getting back up isn’t an easy task for most of the time. But with enough focus and thinking you’ll get all those coins, and flowers, and keyboard keys, and maybe even some secret symbols. Even if you don’t it won’t change much; a game that is filled with secrets won’t hide that much if you won’t find all of them. After all, that was the message of it. If the goal isn’t clear, or doesn’t really make sense, it will be the false one.",1410267899,1686315833,True,76,0,0.843567728996276855,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Playing the original Knytt felt like a sweet regular nintendo game with way better sound.

Knytt Underground feels like if the franchise just came to Super Nintendo as it significantly sets the bar higher than the previous game. Everything is improved and worth paying for. 

Years ago, I played Knytt which was a free platformer game from some guy i never heard of. He or someone provided a level editor and pretty soon, I was playing dozens and dozens of fan mods (essentially the same game concept but with different locations, music, puzzles and enemies and some pretty infuriating gameplay mechanics)

What drew me into Knytt and kept me coming back was the great feeling of size and scope. The sound design was always brilliant. Wonderful ambient music (which is some of my favorite kind of music) no voice acting (good thing) , satisfying sounds of scuttling along, jumping, crawling up walls, splashing into water, ect. You feel like a little beetle bug just trying to get somewhere. 

Generally Knytt games revolved around a very bare bones narrative story, just simply enforcing the idea you had to get somewhere. Sometimes the motive was silly, sometimes it was supposed to be serious. 

Depending on which map you got, you might have a giant maze world full of keys you have to collect to advance, like a typical metroidvania, and/or was simply set up in a way that required abilities to be found and progress. Sometimes it was both.

never did the game hold your hand. It generally pointed you to go ""left"" and that's all the instructions you usually got. Figure it out on your own. 

Knytt Underground is all of this, still. But its better. the new gameplay mechanics immediately feel welcome and a great add on to an already winning formula ! 

The only criticism I have for Knytt Underground is the art style of the ""sprites"" (as in, the characters who identify as sprites, little magical beings). I don't mean the pixelated sprite that represents a game character in a 2D pixelated game. In action, the sprites look fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing.
however, the points where the game pauses for dialog with a NPC are where I have issues. 

The original Knytt, if I recall correctly, didn't do this. Character's 1 line or so of dialog would simply display as you walked near them and the dialog disappeared when you got a certain distance away. 

Now the dialog is initiated by pressing a button, which is fine ! No problem with this. The problem is the hideous enlarged profile portrait of a sprite when you are talking to it (or when your sprite character is talking).
Suddenly all that beautiful art style you were enjoying gets shattered by the worst looking MS PAINT quality blotches of color I've ever seen in a game. (ok, i've probably seen worse but the point is these are completely out of place).
I wish they either re-did these to look smaller (as the larger presentation is what reveals how crappy they look) or simply use their head instead of the whole body. Because they simply look awful. I do not like.


Other than that, I pretty much covered it all ! Watch some gameplay vids of the original Knytt to see what i'm talking about.

However, the result is not something which I can call worthwhile.

Graphics:
Unfortunately, the transition to higher res graphics is not flattering at all. While Stories used simple sprites, the low res meant that this could pass for a purposeful aesthetic and it worked. Underground, by contrast, looks generally incoherent. The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art - they are impossible to take seriously.

Audio:
The music and sound effects are consistently fitting, minimal and and atmospheric so a good job on this count.

Gameplay:
The platforming mechanics here are fairly good, the level layouts are smart and there are a good number of save points along the way. The chaper two mechanics are pretty neat. However, progression through the game is not rewarding in the same way that a good Metroidvania should be. A lack of character upgrades and variety makes progression feel less like purposeful exploration and more like aimless stumbling around and backtracking. On a technical note, there is no controller support. The creator suggests using joy2key or xpadder but having tried this, it is clear that design choices in the keyboard conrtrols make this impractical.

Dialog:
This is one of the more frustrating parts of the whole experience. It is clear that there was an attempt to be whimsical here but in reality, the dialog just serves to pull you right out of the game; creating a feeling that neither the characters or the writer are invested at all. Rather than being charming, it just kills the neat atmospheric mood that the game partway manages to establish.

Overall:
Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game. Play Knytt Stories instead. It is free and feels much more complete and satisfying than Underground in every way. If you like Stories, then maybe consider buying this to support Nifflas almost as a donation for that game.",1408998890,1408998890,False,54,0,0.771854698657989502,2,False,False,False,False,,,

[b]Overall Game & Story Thoughts[/b]
Knytt Underground is a 2D platformer/exploration/physics puzzler developed by Nifflas’ Group. It’s the third game in the series though you won’t likely have heard of the previous two games as they never made it to Steam. You follow the adventures of Mi, a mute sprite who must ring six special bells in this underground world in order to save it. She is joined by a sentient, yet also mute, bouncing ball and two fairies. So, with this quirky cast of characters, you are tasked to save the world….and fetch every single item in this vast world of sprites. 

You begin with a couple of short tutorial chapters to get you familiar with the game mechanics that Knytt has. After that, the game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you in chapter three. The game world is huge and there is a lot to see. Much of the game is focused around exploring every nook and cranny while listening to a pretty darn good soundtrack. There's also a story involving your two companion fairies that gets fleshed out during your adventures though I found the writing to be wonky. Basically, there's a science VS religion theme going throughout the story and I'm not convinced that it pulls it off that well. The two fairies themselves are also a bit two dimensional and predictable to how they'll treat each situation. It's not well written. 

[b]Level Design[/b]
While the game has over 1,800 rooms to explore, a lot of them are empty corridors and dead-ends. A very large majority of the quests in this game are fetch quests and the rest are finding somebody. (So, just ½ of the fetch quest). Most items are obtained after solving physics-based puzzles that get continually harder as the game progresses. Getting around the world is a chore as the fast-travel system is very gimmicky and tricky to get to the area that you really want to be. The whole shadow world that has you rushing in a netherworld to get to the exit but if you don't get there in time, you'll be thrown into a random room that doesn't help you progress forward. It can get extremely tiresome to deal with. 

[b]The Game's Content[/b]
I will say that I enjoyed the exploration...for a while. I enjoyed the puzzles...for a while. I enjoyed the fetch quests...for a while. It’s really a testament to the game that I tolerated 14 hours of fetch quests. But towards the end of the game, I just wanted it to end. The game’s content is bloated, repetitive and lacking in interesting new mechanics to explore after a while. While being able to transform into a ball is a little different on the platforming genre, I think its the worst part of the game as some areas and puzzles require extremely precise jumping in order to pass. 

[b]Ragequit[/b]
The game ended for me when I got to the 5th major locked door in the game. Each bell that has to be rung is locked by a jerkface sprite that demands you hand over items for varying reasons ranging from “I’m just like this because reasons” to [i]“You need to PROVE yourself”[/i]. (This goes back to my complaint that the story isn't well written). When I was told, at the 5th door, that I still needed more items in order to pass, (and hence complete the game) I pretty much said this: [b]NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE. I’M DONE, I’M FINISHED. I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS[/b]. And promptly quit the game. I do understand that there are ways to get around the bell without paying but it requires trial and error to get around him through the other world system. I can only tolerate so much of the same repetitive activity. The enemy variety is lacking and many of the >physics< puzzles consist of a lot of trial and error. An absurd amount of trial and error dependent on nailing skillshots at the right time in the midst of bouncing around the room. It can get very quickly frustrating after dealing with it for 10+ hours. There's nothing there to really vary it up. 

[b]PC Settings[/b]
Knytt has rebindable keys and audio sliders. Graphics settings are extremely basic, allowing for changing full screen and some enabling/disabling minor effects. That's all. It's a stunningly basic settings menu. While 2D games don't necessarily need a lot of settings, not even having the basic such as V-Sync or Resolution is not ok. One last note: the character running around in the chapter-select screen is cute but please don’t add it to future games. Adding time to entering the game (especially when its the longest path of all the three chapters) gets very old. Using a regular menu UI is much more preferable to getting us into the actual game. No need to make a repetitive game out of entering the [i]actual[/i] game.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
I can’t recommend Knytt Underground. The game is unique with a great soundtrack and solid enough presentation for sure but the repetitive gameplay and frustrating trial-and-error puzzles drove me insane. It’s a large ocean of a world with the depth of a puddle. Adding different kinds of quests and less item questing would have made the experience more enjoyable in my mind. The game is far too long considering its story and mechanical depth. You'll realistically see most of the game's mechanics in the first two tutorial levels before moving onto the main world. Said world will only slightly change things up, but depend far too much on what it first designed to create challenges. The story itself takes too long (mostly due to the game's pacing issues) and has a central, if uninteresting, conflict between religion and science that has been done better elsewhere. This is, bemusingly, too much content for this game's concept and execution.

But the dialogue is tacky. It feels like something I would think was cool in middle school, and if I was trying to write something in a second language. The scenery consists of photoshopped fruits and hardware that feels tacked on, like early 90's CG in action movies. The story is juvenile and plodding. The game forces is episodic, and each episode ends up with you retracing places you've been before, but rather than being part of the exploration or platforming it's just something that makes you run back and forth.

These games are all about the atmosphere and solid mechanics as you explore an otherwise featureless world for vaguely defined reasons. The formula didn't work so well in this incarnation.

Игра разделена на три главы.

Первая глава - маленькая, но симпатичная платформенная адвентюра о немой девочке, которая хочет подружиться с феями. У девочки две спецспособности - умение лазить по любой вертикальной стене и использовать светящиеся ""звёздочки"" (разный цвет звёздочек даёт разные эффекты). Проходится часа за два и обрывается на полуслове. Хм.

Вторая глава - о прыгающем шарике (происхождение шарика не объясняется), который ничем не связан с первой частью - ну, кроме отдельных локаций, которые он делит с первой главой. Спецспособности шарика - умение высоко прыгать и ""примагничиваться"" к некоторым объектам. Забавно посмотреть, конечно, как те же самые места проходятся совершенно по-другому, потому что способности не те. Но и только. Проходится за полтора часа и обрывается точно так же. Хммм.

Ок, приступаю к третьей главе, ожидая незатейливого соединения двух глав во что-то единое целое и настраиваюсь ещё на час-другой игры.

А вот не тут-то было! Внезапно оказывается, что первая и вторая главы - это такой туториал к _настоящей_ игре, какой и является третья глава. Причём там объём немерянный. На глаз, присутствует несколько сотен локаций, с секретами, необязательными предметами, квестами, сложно соединёнными проходами - в общем хорошая, большая экшен-адвентюра часов на 20 (с моей неспешностью там и все 100 будет - я уже наиграл 17, а ещё и четверти не прошёл).

Если нравятся лабиринты с загадками - рекомендую. Симпатичная такая штука, почти детская, если исключить неизбежные смерти героя в лаве, кислоте и от ударов током и убийства роботов (чаще, правда, роботы убивают тебя).

One who finds the plot interesting may also face handful of diffirent creatures, each with their own stories and/or optional tasks that may make traveling through the world easier. I would also note the great fairy companion Cilia, her intelligence and cynicism really brought a few smiles for me.

You play as Mi Sprocket who is a mute sprite. She is chosen to go on a quest (because her brother freaked out or something) to ring the six bells in order to prevent the world from being destroyed. Along the way she picks up two pixies who are her voice. Dora and Cilia couldn't be more polar opposite. One is kind and considerate. The other is brazen and brash.

The first two ""Chapters"" of the game are a kind of tutorial. The first shows you Mi. She can run and jump and climb. She also picks up colored lights and can activate them for a one time special power. 

The second introduces you to Bob. Bob is a ball, and can bounce. Pretty high. He also can create a static field around him that will pull him to special robots to allow him to play Tarzan the ball.

This will take about 90 minutes. Then you get to meat of the game...Chapter three. The map in Chapter three is a rectangle 30 by 48 (1440) screens. Plus several secret areas not on the map including a small inverted world and you have a huge world to explore. 

There are side quests to complete and some symbols hidden in what seem to be extremely inaccessible areas. There are other sprites and pixies around the world that tell a quirky story about some sprite ""religions"" having to do with technology. 

The environments are unique. The different areas of the underground each come with different theme music. The part I liked best was trying to get items that seemed to be inaccessible. Many times you look at a screen and say ""No way"" can that item be picked up. Then you go through the game and learn some tricks that will allow you pick them up. The mapping system does a good job marking these items (i) as well as quests (Q) on your map.

There have been many discussions around the internet regarding the controls for this game. Personally, I didn't find them to be an issue. I have been playing games with a keyboard for a very long time. Arrows to move, ""A"" to use the special power, and ""S"" to switch between states. The only issues that I had were on some of the timing puzzles and pressing the wrong button (A instead of S). I thought keyboard controls worked well with the game.

I would say to try the demo, but this only lets you play through the first chapter. While this will give you some feel for the game, the real meat and potatoes is in the third chapter.

The girl can climb up walls, and the ball can jump high and gain some serious horizontal uncontrollable speed, which is fun, until you hit a ledge or something. You can climb to a high distance with the girl, then change to the ball and gain some extra jump height, or you can jump high with the ball and get to a climbing spot the girl couldn't get to before.

Exploration is the main part of the game. There's little mini stories scattered all over for you to find. It's a big map, so there's quite a few of them.

Both titles provided fantastic exploration, with a stunning sense of place delivered by a low key asthetic. Platforming was thoroughly enjoyable, challenging, without ever being unfair, although that is not to say it wasn't occasionally frustrating.

Knytt Underground continues the pattern set in these earlier games. In my mind its the first of Nifflas' premium games to recapture the charm of the simple graphics of the earlier games, while maintaining the visual richness of more recent titles. The metroidvania style progression has been tuned back, in favour of a couple of tutorial chapters and a few obviously gated sections. Initially I was  a bit disapointed by the change, but the satisfaction of returning to a challenge and beating it at a later date, because [i]you[/i] were better, not your character, is immensely satisfying.

I was a bit concerned after finishing the first couple of chapters so quicky, but the third chapter is sprawling, with tucked away non-critical path challenges to keep even the hardcore happy. 

There's a bit more written narrative going on here than in other Nifflas games, but it's pleasingly well written, and primarily acts to frame the fetch-quests, while fleshing out your fairy companions.

Gameplay consists of platforming, exploration, and item collection.  The enjoyment of this game for me comes in with the characters, the atmosphere, and the setting.  While there is no combat or complex puzzles and a lot of quests dead end and have no rewards, what you are left with is a game you play for the story.  If the story isn't to your liking here then you probably wont like the game, but it worked out pretty well for me.  I liked the interaction and development between the characters, and the game doesn't feel held back when it comes to discussing a few unpleasant topics or having characters act vulgar or make violent expressions when it fits (hence the game's Mature ESRB rating).  The game's art-style for character portraits was initially a turn-off for me but I found myself not really minding it later into the game.  The game also has good sound and art design for its environments, and can be very nicely ambient in atmosphere.  The setting and lore of the game was very appealing to me too, and gives the player a few humorous moments thanks to meta-knowledge that the characters in the story dont posess. 

Performance - No issues, runs fine, rebindable controls, graphics options are satisfactory.  Controls are fairly tight and platforming is not very problematic.  Some puzzles are hard, but not excessively so, and the game is very much non-punishing for failure-retry in its puzzles.  There are optional parts with quite difficult puzzles, but those are presented completely aside from the main setting of the game.

Its a very good game, and quite long too for an indie game.  I spent a lot of time enjoying myself and exploring things, and seeking out a few optional achievements, and put in about 20 hours into the game.

It has some really nice and smartly designed platforming mechanics. For most of the game you can switch to a ball at will, which has its own style of gameplay seperate from your normal self. And this interaction between the two generates some truly fun, if at times frustrating, platforming challenges.

There are 3 main chapters to the game, there are also side areas, which are even more challenging however all of them are hidden and you have to discover them for yourself. The first two chapters are more like introductions to the gameplay and the story. The third chapter is where everything takes off and you find a truly massive game underneath (for a platformer).

It's just a shame that it's so badly let down by its last third (not the third chapter itself, only the last part of it), the platforming becomes a chore, and the pay off in the end, storywise, is virtually non existant.

In the end speaking as someone who doesn't really enjoy platformers, especially sidescrolling ones, all that much I'd take this as a glowing endorsment to anyone who is into platformers.

作为2D独立游戏本作的画面已经算是非常出色的了，音乐也很棒，但这些只是添头所以都不重要（逃），不过对比同类游戏确实有着一股浓厚的小清新风格，但其实内在是一款内容十分丰富并且充满了作者恶搞精神的作品。

游戏只有3章，前两章很快就能通过，但那其实只是训练关而已，分别训练如何控制小人和某个球，然后第三章玩家可以用S键切换小人和球，于是就可以走遍全地图了（地图非常大，而且没有定点传送门跑路跑到死），游戏才正式开始。小人模式没什么好说的，如果吃过光球可以按A键施放，红色对应大跳、黄色对应竖直上升、蓝色对应水平飞行、绿色对应自由飞行、白色可以作为一发子弹发射出去击毁敌人，这些能量球（和万恶的隐藏通道）是游戏中解谜的核心；而球模式就很独特了，因为玩家是一个球……然后球不停弹来弹去很难控制，但一些比较难以到达的敌方都要靠球的弹射配合小人抓墙来完成，具体方法大家自己摸索。

剧情说实话我没怎么看懂，不过确实有诠zhuang释bi空间，第三章的主要目标是撞地图上的若干个钟，但为了过去一般要贿赂门卫（花啊石头之类的或者钱），于是必须满地图搜集奇怪的东西以及做支线任务来凑够门票材料，和NPC对话可以了解到一些世界观，以及看两个小精灵吐槽卖萌（毒舌好评），在章节末尾作者本人会跑出来做旁白以及自我吐槽，来达成坑爹式的结局……好吧我只是照着攻略草草走了一周目，反正结局非常坑，有成就狂人达成隐藏结局（需要用贿赂门卫之外的方法来传送到钟的场景）的话求剧透～如果没攻略自己探地图的话玩个花个几十小时很正常，要开隐藏结局则要二周目耗时更久。

另外有人提到成就的问题，所有成就都和隐藏要素相关，而且都藏的非常隐秘……比如进入游戏之前在主菜单瞎逛可以找到一个，在Credit界面则有另外两个，第二章幕间用绿球飞到奇怪的地方有两个，诸如此类，不过当然大部分都需要经过一些非常非常隐蔽的通道，不知道不看攻略收集齐成就的人脑洞到底有多大……

总体而言，在同类游戏里面算是制作精良又非常有特色的一款，如果不介意在没有战斗的情况下满地图跑来跑去跳来跳去，又喜欢探索的话，还是很值得一玩的。",1395502948,1397306222,True,12,1,0.671653389930725098,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What really differentiates Knytt Underground from Nifflas' prior work is the story. I've seen all too many reviews disregard the story, saying it's weak. An awful lot of reviewers have evidently missed what the story is. The central plot is not the story. It's little more than a framing work, something to give you a reason to go and explore the hauntingly beautiful landscape.

The real story is on the side-lines. It's about religion, and whether it matters if there's a god, and WHY it matters to people whether or not there is. It's about the good, the bad and the ugly of faith and belief and all the little insecurities of life. It's supported in this by a very human cast. (Which is vaguely amusing given the lack of humans present.) I actually cared about Dora, and Cilia, and even the little side characters who did little but add flavour to the world, building it up to something that feels real.

My love of this game can only be aptly compared to my love of the works of Tove Jansson, whose Moomin series holds a strong resemblance to the work.

There are two main problems. First, the -mood- of the game is terrible. Yes, it's called ""Underground"", but the art style and background style is far far too gloomy. The aesthetics are just a huge turn-off. The background images tend to be real images or 3d rendered images that seem completely out of place. The terrain is simply all black.

Niveau dextérité, ça reste abordable, on est loin de Giana Sister Twisted Dream ou Guacamelee. 
En plus si on bloque on peut généralement passer son chemin: ces passages défis permettent en général de récupérer des artefacts mais il y a un système d'artefact joker (les pièces) qui permet de finir le jeu sans réaliser tous défis.

Bien que l'on obtienne pas de nouveaux mouvements/pouvoir du début à la fin du chapitre 3, au fur et à mesure de l'exploration, on apprend à combiner les mouvements de base pour accéder à des endroits que l'on pensait inaccessible. Il faut découvrir ces astuces par soit même, mais le design de certains tableaux aide à les découvrir.

L'aspect exploration/non linéaire est légèrement déroutant au début (il n'y a pas de ""aller ici maintenant"", enfin sauf pour les mini quêtes), mais cela donne une liberté énorme sur la manière de jouer.

Bref, un jeu très sympa et hautement recommandé (surtout vu ce qu'il coûte).",1393453373,1393453373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is one of the most underrated platformers. 
I'm never a big platformer fan, even Mario and Rayman can't attract me much. But this one, you should never miss it.

Bad platformers give you tons of challenges and a tutorial that comes from nowhere, then they call it a ""game"".
But in Knytt Underground, you put yourself in this eerie but beautiful world, granted with strange power and start your journey. Challenges in this game are not that difficult, but you still need to analyse and prepare your steps. If you fail the jump, you will immediately go back to a check-point in this small room, so the jumping is challenging but never annoying. 

Control is easy and precise, but you may need some other software (like joy2key) to support your controller.

If you just want to read the main story, the game is not difficult and short. But there are much more things to explore. And you could find many interesting items, side-quests and more challenges.

The two most notable of these titles are Within a Deep Forest and Knytt. Within a Deep Forest had players taking control of a sentient bouncing ball that had to save the world from a bomb. The game focused on the bouncing physics of different types of balls of different weights and materials.

Knytt focused on a little hero of the same name needing to find parts to fix a crashed spaceship so that he could get back home. The mechanics here dealt with the notion of climbing and sticking to walls. Both of these games have now been combined to create Knytt Underground which marks Nifflas’ first move into the realm of console gaming.

Split into three chapters, Knytt Underground has players take on the role of the mute Mi Sprocket as she explores a huge environment. Her aim is to look for human artefacts and complete quests in a Metroidvania style. The first two chapters act as short tutorials to help players understand the mechanics of how Mi and then Bob the ball handle. By chapter three the two characters have magically been morphed together allowing players to change from Mi to Bob at will.

This allows for some situations requiring lightning reflexes as you change from Mi to the bouncing ball mid-air to cannon off the landscape at all sorts of weird and wonderful angles in order to reach new areas. As well as the bouncing and climbing there are different coloured plumes of smoke which give temporary abilities. These range from turning Mi invisible, making her jump higher or turning her into a set that can shoot horizontally or vertically.

Everything is designed as a means for you to get to another locations and this is where Knytt Underground really works well. Nifflas games before this have always focused on short bursts of quick reflexes and skill. When Knytt Underground asks players to do the same it comes to life in a flurry of ever changing physics and colourful plumes of smoke. (Note to developer – a colour-blind filter would really help with those plumes of smoke)

However, in Knytt Underground there are often long stretches of exploration through empty screens to reach these areas. Sometimes the beautiful graphics and sound create a haunting and ambient environment which you don’t mind trekking through. At other times it can all be a little dull as you wander through empty screen after empty screen. This was an issue on the PS3 version but strangely, seems to be much less of an issue on the PC. Maybe we’ve mellowed a bit, or maybe it just fits the system a bit better.

When Knytt Underground works it works well but when it doesn’t it can feel a bit  empty. This isn’t helped by the seeming lack of progress you make. There are numerous quests and items to discover but on completing or collecting them it doesn’t seem to mean much. Of course it all adds up in the end but the game could do with tweaking its risk reward system to help players feel a greater sense of achievement after they have overcome some of the incredibly fiendish screens.

It is worth highlighting just how lovely the game looks and sounds. This game is beautiful and the music is of the highest standard. We expect no less from a Nifflas game and in that department Knytt Underground can never be faulted with a stunningly ambient atmosphere created throughout. The spaced out save points also seem less of an issue in the PC version, even though some of them are still some distance away from tricky sections of the game and back tracking is something that can begin to hinder the experience. We lost count of the amount of times we trekked along a tunnel for five or six screens only to reach a character telling us we needed to bring a certain item to them. This then meant trekking back through all the screens again. There really isn’t a need for this and you wonder if the game would have benefitted from a slightly smaller, more focused, map without many of the empty screens - or at least the ability to teleport between save points.

Overall, Knytt Underground is another promising game for Nifflas. The look and sound of the game is gorgeous and easily rivals the best 2D artwork out there. The game itself gives players a huge world to explore but many may well feel that it lacks focus and a real sense of rewards for the skill you need in order to progress. Those looking for an adventure set at a slower pace will love it, while others will be left wanting a bit more excitement.

Nifflas, creator of the Knytt series, is a whimsical developer who just up and makes whatever he feels like making, usually a whimsical game about whimsical creatures going on whimsical adventures, and while Knytt Underground draws on that in its story and its visual and audio design, the characterization is a drastic change in tone. It handles serious and sensitive issues, and there's plenty of heavy language to go with that. Maybe it's the sheer unexpectedness of it that contributes to the M rating, whereas plenty of games with way more ""questionable content"" keep their T rating because their general tone is darker. But that's not what the game is about. The game is about secrets. The game has way more secrets than achievements. There are often secrets within the secrets. Sometimes there are even secrets in THOSE secrets. How about a 4-layer secret? Don't put it past Nifflas; he'd do it. Nothing is too obscure. Very few players get the achievements in this game, and it's for a reason. Even if you find them all, you could still be missing a lot. Fact: Nifflas hates progress bars.

The Knytt series is a bit of a Metroid ""lite"" with the emphasis on exploration and platforming challenges scattered throughout. Enemy encounters are infrequent, and they are not very aggressive, letting you take in the atmosphere even when they're around. Even more rarely will you actually have to confront the enemies, as most of the enemy-based challenges are about avoiding enemies or using them to your advantage. The biggest obstacles in the game are the NPCs, who are more than happy to make their living by setting up doors in the way of your goals and charging you in rare artifacts to open them. If you take this gameplay mechanic at face value, it can seem like the biggest gameplay element in Knytt Underground is a bunch of annoying fetch quests, but this is not necessarily true. Yes, if you've been staring at the map the whole time and heading straight toward your target destinations with no effort to explore on your own, you will be sent on fetch quests, but if you've been exploring adequately throughout your experience, very rarely will the NPCs actually succeed in making you turn around. The quests are also pretty lenient, as you don't have to find every item in the game to pay the tolls, and, in fact, you don't have to pay the tolls at all. If you're very skilled at navigating the world, you can find shortcuts around these annoying characters. The fetch quests aren't here to draw out the game length, they're there to offer a loosely guiding sense of purpose as you whimsically (there's that word again) explore the world and enjoy its atmosphere--just as how in Minecraft, the ""goal"" of taking out the Ender Dragon is not the main appeal of the game, and if that were all you ever set out to do, you'd be missing the point. This isn't the kind of game you want to try and plow through quickly. If you do, you're seriously missing out, and probably not having a very good time.

The information in the above paragraph does not mean that Knytt Underground is braindead easy, however. There are plenty of hidden challenges that will test your platforming mettle, no matter what your background is. The key word here, though, is ""hidden."" They are far from mandatory to advance the story, and not necessary to complete in order to enjoy the game. They are there because Nifflas gets bored and makes them, and hides them in the game so there's something for everyone.",1390949743,1390951868,True,15,1,0.615679621696472168,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You are Mi Sprocket, a sprite who cannot talk. But the game has conversations, how does this work? Soon you will get two companions and you can choose who should have the conversation each time. Your companions have quite different world views. The story is not a fixed story but creates an incredible sense of a journey and you feel your companions have real growth.

I've spent most of my day today playing it because it's just that engaging.
It's a beautiful combination of exploration-based gameplay and 2D platforming. The game map is huuuuuge. And that could be a bad thing, but exploring it is a joy because of the diverse atmospheres and all the little bits of story scattered throughout. I filled out the map simply because it was fun to explore. There's hundreds of puzzles and plenty of hidden objects to find, and the map's nice enough to mark mostly everything for you. The only thing you have to find on your own are the hidden passages (which on a few occasions are really difficult to find and figuring out how to reach hidden rooms is quite the epiphany~)
That's not to say the game is easy, though. There's plenty of difficult action sequences, and if you plan to get all the achievements you really need to master the controls and the game's physics, because it can be HARD. Not quite as difficult as some precision platformers get, but you can spend a lot of time on the same screen or two.
I really can't properly describe how this game pulls you in. Personally, I'd sit down, boot it up, and start filling in more of the map, only to discover that two or more hours had vanished while I was making progress. It's a game that demands your attention and doesn't easily let it go. And I'm quite glad I played it~",1387520851,1387520851,True,4,0,0.510603606700897217,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's definitely worth the money.

The game is first of all visually impressive - just as expected. Sometimes I wonder a bit if the experience wouldn't have been even better if the ground wasn't all black, throughout the whole world. One gets used to it, but the other knytt games had colored background, which looked a bit more friendly. However, it may be that black is a good choice to clearly differentiate between the background scenery and the ground you're walking on.

Storywise, well, forget the story. It is really not necessary. Surprisingly, this game is much more about characters than about story - something I didn't expect. There are *lots* of NPCs to talk to, and almost every one of them has an own story and personality. What impressed me most is that once you reach the third chapter, you don't have any red line to follow, so you get the dialogues between the two main (talking) characters in some random order depending on which places you visit in which order. But although there are some main themes repeatedly exploited in the dialogue, it never gets messed up if you change the order. As for the dialogue itself, it's really excellently crafted and highly intelligent.

While you're exploring the - really vast - world, you'll also explore the protagonists and the history of this world. Most games are about story advancement (and sometimes character advancement), but this one is purely about exploration. There's so much to discover you'll hardly remember an area you already visited. The game also features quite some subtle humor if you pay attention.

And did I mention the soundtrack yet? It's awesome.

Now, nothing is perfect. I'll flag the following comments as spoiler although it really is just a very mild one.

[spoiler]One thing I don't like about this game is that it's breaking the forth wall. Having the protagonists talk to the author talking steals away some of the atmosphere. But this only happens rarely, so it's forgivable. Another thing is that one does not get to know the main protagonist much. We do get to know something about her family, but almost nothing about herself. I know that this is a usual technique to make the player identify himself with the protagonist, but in this world where everyone else has a story, it's really strange that the protagonist lacks one. We don't even know whether she actually cannot speak or just doesn't want to.[/spoiler]

Oh, and the super secret challenges section is really, really, [b]really[/b] nasty.

<rant>Just one last side note: I really cannot understand why this game got an M rating by the ESRB. Is critical thinking forbidden for teens in the USA? Yeah, it may be offensive if you're some fundamentalist, but seriously, why should such people dictate which games are appropriate for teens? Here in Germany, it's approved for age 12 and up.</rant>",1387489711,1387489711,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The game builds around a very simple puzzle mechanic: you can switch between a girl that can jump and climb, and a ball that can bounce higher and move faster. This works very well, and you'll meet some smart puzzles throughout the game where this comes in good use.

The game is comprised of Three chapters, the first two are 30-45 minutes each and will leave you worried the game is going to be 2 hours long. Fear not. Chapter Three offers the vast Kyntt exploration we know and love.

That is to say, Kyntt is a Metroidvania exploration game without the normal character progression you'd normally see holding you back. Instead there are a number of clever puzzles that are challenging but shouldn't leave you frustrated (in my experience so far at least). Instead the game reigns you in through, first and foremost, a vast world that forces you to explore your local area or you'll miss much of the beauty of the game, but at the same time makes it extremely clear that you've reached a deadend on the map so you're not left wondering if you can make a jump or not. 

The second way it gives you a sense of progression comes by letting you try things. In some instances it explicitly warns you not to until you know more about this or that and if you ignore the warning chances are you're going to fail unless you already know what you're doing. It's a nice way of developing the story and mechanics for first time players without forcing repeat players through lengthy tutorials.

That's the kind of game creator Nifflas is. Fucking amazing.

As it stands, the game does better with controller enabled, but since it's lacking support.. you can use workaround like Joy2Key to have controller support. 

For the game itself, It's an exploration platformer, meaning you won't find many enemies to pawn like in Giana Sister or Mark of the Ninja. What you need is to move around, get past puzzle and do some tricks to advance. There are some annoying puzzles though that require you to be precise with the jump timing, or backtracking quite a bit when you fail. I guess it's part of the game.

The OST is a complete opposite of Electronic Super Joy with its hard punk - or whatever it's called - OST genre. The OST is pretty bland and unnoticed at times, well I don't think about it too much, the game's pretty slow paced as well.

Now available on Steam, the game has you playing the role of a little girl who looks like some kind of evil doll. Look at her run, that’s evil. Freaky little legs swinging around like sticks. But either way this little girl goes on a metroid style quest to explore temples and dungeons. While the game may look like a first grader’s attempt at drawing, the level design is pretty solid. The dialog is a bit strange, and for some reason the game got an M rating because somehow characters get into sexual conversations and curse a lot. There’s something a little… special? about this game. If you can get past that, you will find some fun platforming and metroidvania style platforming. Plus now I’m going to beat it just to find out what that M rating was for.

I've Put almost 100 hours into the PSN and DRM-Free releases, and I know I'll be playing through a fifth time with the Steam release. The reason I can return to this game so frequently without getting bored is the world. It's the biggest game of its kind, and every single area has recieved a genuinely impressive amount of care. The story might seem inconsequential at first, but it explores some very sensitive topics with sincerity and handles its subject matter well. After you've finished the story, there's piles of ultra-challenging bonus areas and secrets to explore, too. The whole package is finished off with one of the best soundtracks in video game history, period. You can find it free on the developer's website, and I suggest you do. It's five and a half hours of outright brilliance.  If exploring is your cup of tea, you should've picked it up when it first released last year.

Just a side note. It might not seem like it, but the game really does deserve that M rating. It has some serious subject matter in it that I wouldn't reccommend for kids (or for that matter, some adults).",1385413855,1385413868,True,19,0,0.600625395774841309,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Странно, но вступление, предвосхищающее начало игры и появление её названия впечатляют больше, чем вся остальная игра целиком. Вы управляете девушкой Ми, которая путешествует по миру (к слову, мир просто разбит на локации) и собирает разные секретные плюшки, попутно решая несложные головоломки. Основная проблема игры в том, что большую часть вы просто бегаете по разным экранам, ничем не заполненным, поэтому их нахождение в игре абсолютно непонятно.

I've played a sizeable number of them since, but the ones that made the biggest impression on me were the ones where it's not all about the platforming, but really exploring the game and trying to figure out every single secret hidden in it. And secrets have become such a de facto standard of the mainstream 2D platformers to the point where the secrets and locations of them have become rather formulaic. The wonder of finding them has all but disappeared.

That's one of the reasons I love Knytt Underground so much. The fact that the world is so huge makes just getting around it a great endeavour in itself, but there's also so much stuff hidden under the surface if you care to dig into it. And it's mostly not about finding an equivalent to a star coin or a 1-Up, but rather about getting intimate with a game world that's so carefully and lovingly crafted. It's about talking to an NPC that isn't a step towards beating the game, but piecing together another part of the lore of the people of the underground. And it's about exploring amazing locations just for the sake of exploration; not because there's a carrot dangling at the end of your journey.
