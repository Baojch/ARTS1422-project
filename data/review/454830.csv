It's possible to knock balls for huge distances, bounce and add spin. I enjoyed this a lot more than i expected to and i think it's because beach balls don't have the mass and resistance you expect with tennis or basketballs so they feel right in VR . 
   There could be a really satisfying and  different Selfie Tennis type game or some sort of weird relaxation activity here as the physics are great. I'm intrigued to see where this goes but it needs more of a purpose than the game currently delivers.",1483794151,1483794151,True,1,0,0,0,False,True,True,False,,,

Back in 2016 it was fun to see what could be done with physics. But forward on 6 years to 2024... I tried it again, and it's just not where it would have to be for maintaining a recomend. 

----- first review------ Early days for this game, but it could grow in to quite a nice experience. There's something timeless about trying to get a ball through a hoop... launching the beachballs down the hillside was a nice surprise. 

Controls need a bit more explanation and clarity, and a TP feature and Dart Blower would be great to take out some of the beachballs. 

But a fun wee distraction which I'll give to some people to play around with during my demos of the Vive :). Thanks for creating and thanks for sharing.",1461442126,1678754864,False,0,0,0.497942358255386353,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Yes I know it looks dumb. I expected to play it for about 30 seconds and shut it off.

But the interactions with the beach balls are tactile and satisfying, and I enjoyed spawning dozens of them & smashing them with my wooden arms. There's also a simple minigame where you can bounce them through targets for points. Like I said, weirdly fun.

I initially gave this a thumbs-down but after seeing the new features I'm recommending it.",1460073581,1572756742,True,4,0,0.563514232635498047,0,False,False,True,False,,,
