My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707405324,1707405324,True,1,0,0.489690721035003662,0,True,False,False,True,,,

There's a specific amount of that corn if you reach it/pass it you've won however there are deadly trucks which are trying to kill you. They grow bigger each time when they collide with another deadly trucks. If you die before you get the amount which is needed you didn't lost. When none of the players reach the amount, the guy/girl who were closest to the amount win. There can be maximum of 4 players in one lobby/game.

They are not charging a lot for the game, so it's not like you are getting ripped off and for someone that can find a group of friends to play with here and there, decent value.

The game itself is very short and simple, you get dropped into a corn field with a scythe and you harvest corn and drop it into the waiting trucks, same mouse button that harvests corn also drops it into the trucks.  Other mouse button drops some of the corn you harvested so you can run faster from AI bots or the tractor.  Using your Scythe on the bots will temporarily disable them and make them easy prey for the tractor, the bots can also attack you and you repeatedly smash the space bar till you are up again.  It isn't until the tractor gets you or the timer runs out that the game ends.  The tractors that chase you start out small and eventually end up into rather large monstrosities.  The tractor AI seems half decent as well, I was spotted by a smaller one and it did chase me around when I was in it's field of view.

The bot matches I played were fun enough, couldn't find an online match, although there is the option for it there, so maybe you might get lucky there.

I had fun with the little bit there is here, but I just can't recommend something that people might play for 20-30 minutes and never think about again.

TLDR : Game of Cat and Mouse. You are the mouse and some corn harvesting tractor is the cat. You use hand tools to steal corn from the tractor and outrun it. Meant for multi but not worth the hassle.

You walk around the corn field and generate points the longer you stay alive by constantly swinging a scythe around which collects corn by clicking furiously. Thus the clicker tag. You can return the corn to the trucks that are at the edge of the field to lock in your current score. The whole idea is to play this multiplayer and challenge your friends but I dont see that anybody would actually want to play this, multiplayer option offered for me to host or join but did not list servers so I am assuming this involves directly connecting to each other. I have not tested it because by then I had a grasp of the general concept and decided to axe this game. The tractors are tiny not very intimidating which is the tone this game is going for. Also the game looks surprisingly bare, with everything being just barely shaped and textures being solid colors.

The game is essentially one giant death match, and the one who gets out with the most corn and manages to stay alive wins.

The developers have displayed their obvious sense of humor towards this obvious novelty game right within the store page description. Death Tractor is not a title meant to be taken seriously, but there is a fine line between decent and awful joke games. Unfortunately, this title is one that falls right in the middle. A few factors have caused me to press the dreaded thumbs down button.

Maps, there is an incredible lack of them. By lack of maps, I mean there is only one that comes with different flavors of the fence that houses the large rectangular patch of corn field. You'll run around in a giant square most of the time as you harvest your corn, daring only to venture into the middle if you're feeling particularly lucky enough to avoid the tractors of death. This stale, repetitive pattern grows old quick and yet there is so much more potential to maps that could be created.

Sound effects are minimal and music is non-existent, except for when you die. You'll be hearing the same hum of the tractors, their beeping horns, and your sickle for the entire five minute duration of each match that you play. These minimalistic attributes only further push the mundane factor up on the scale of ""growing bored, quickly"". Although on a positive note, the game only has three button functions; left click to use your hand-held agricultural tool, ESC to return to the menu after death, and space bar after you've been knocked down by an opponent.

The mechanics are equally as simplistic; the more corn you carry, the slower you become. The slower you become, the higher chance of you ending up as tractor food. So how does one get rid of the corn they've harvested, you ask? Why, by dumping it into the back of pickup trucks lined around the outside of the map. The more corn you harvest, the higher your score will go. However, the opponents around you can also dump their corn into these trucks, and once a truck is full it leaves for an amount of time. If no trucks are present, and you're loaded down, you're pretty much screwed.

You're also screwed if you spawn in the wrong place at the beginning of the game, as tractors spawn just as randomly as you do. You can be dead before you even begin. Usually, one can tell when a death machine is nearby due to the headlights and honking of its horn; this is not always the case, and you may die without ever having seen a giant 20ft tractor coming for you. Also, if an opponent knocks you down, it takes about 5-10 seconds to recover, during which time a tractor may just run you over. In short, you're going to die... a lot. On the bright side, you can also screw over opponents by knocking them down with your sickle; this in turn steals an amount of their corn. This may also cause them to become tractor chow.

Death Tractor kept me entertained for all of an hour and a half until I got supremely bored with it. This is also with getting a good majority of the achievements, and only playing to farm them. As you may have guessed, online is deader than you will be in this game. Luckily, the developers have implemented bots so that you can still get that full Death Tractor experience. I got this in some bundle, but there's absolutely no way this game is worth $4.49 CAD, $1.09 at best. Buy if you wish, but don't say that I didn't try to warn you of the monotony ahead.

[u] Skip to the bottom for the rating [/u]

I almost feel ashamed to say this: [i] I actually enjoyed playing this game. [/i] It's becoming a guilty pleasure of mine, if you will.

With a name like [i] ""Death Tractor"" [/i] I was already capitvated. I was expecting a sort of B-movie charm, and even though this was never truly an apt description of the thing, it certainly isn't entirely without its pros.

[b] Pros [/b]
- [i] Original concept: [/i] You're being chased by an increasing number sentient killer tractors spawning in your cornfield. Though the story is lacking, the atmosphere is tense and engaging.
- [i] Arcade style gameplay: [/i] Entertaining, leaves you wanting to beat your highscores.
- [i] Price: [/i] Cheap.
- [i] Design: [/i] The tractor's designs are pretty damn cool. Even though the environment isn't particularly varied in the game, it makes the most of the little details it can put in. 

[b] Cons [/b]
- [i] Tractor AI: [/i] Buggy. The tractors often pull sudden violent turns, which can end up having them unfairly drive straight into you. Other times, the tractors lose focus chasing you and wander off.
- [i] Lack of content: [/i] There's no story mode, just a single player and an online mode, which are the same thing. The games are 5 minutes long, and you have to rack up as high of a score as you can. That's it.
- [i] Hit detection: [/i] There are AI bots that harvest corn in competition with you in single player, however, when it comes to attacking them, landing a hit is seemingly random, yet, those same bots'll hit you with ease.
- [i] Optimization: [/i] For a game with graphics certainly not ""cutting edge"", it could run better. 
- [i] Pause button: [/i] It says you can pause. You can't.

[b] Neutrals [/b]
- [i] The corn itself: [/i] It's difficult to see anything through the corn, which is good and bad, creating a claustrophobic environment, heightening tension, whilst being irritating at the same time.

Overall, the game's entertaining enough for me to recommend it.

Having to collect things while being chased by a demonic tractor is a decent prospect; that is, if you were making something that gave off more of an arcade feel to it, and if the tractor was actually menacing, not Hot Topic's cheap remodeling of a John Deere product.

The game is incredibly repetitive with very little to actually collect. It's just corn. You're just swiping at corn. That's it. No other special vegetables you could look for, no real points system, no powerups, no rotten plants you should avoid, etc. Those are things I would have imagined with some creativity, but I couldn't find any of that here. Just corn.

The sound design is dreadful. I could not differentiate any sound based on distance or orientation. It's just noise coming from you, or the center of the map (do not go near the center, you will go deaf). Noise pollution is not scary. It's just really frustrating to put up with.

Multiplayer is just a host-or-join setup, but you can only join YOUR friends. And even if you know someone else who paid for this, you have continuous voice-chat with eachother. No push-to-talk, no keyboard options, no exceptions. You have no selection for the levels, but they're all the same map size, so it doesn't matter. You have different player models, but you can't select them, and they're all the same in-game, so it doesn't matter.

[b] VERDICT: [/b] I think there are plenty of games out there that are less than $4 that are worth your money more than this. There's really nothing interesting here after 20 minutes. If more content was here to play with, it would be a different story, but I doubt anything will be added to this game anytime soon.

Perhaps people are right when they hint that I could use some ""therapy""? Crushed dreams aside, let's try to be objective and put this as simply as possible: some of you may actually enjoy this, but I can't in all honesty say that [i]I[/i] did.  
 
   It's...well, for starters, it's a ""deathmatch"" game. And a really simplistic, super-repetitive one at that. With only one ""map"", best as I can tell. It also has the usual complete lack of storytelling logic that virtually all such games have. I mean, who's honestly going to be out harvesting corn when they know full well that there's a homicidal, demonically-possessed tractor roaming the fields? Sure, there's a half-arsed attempt at justifying said premise on the Store page...but there really is ""clever"", and then there really is ""dumb"".  

   Not that any of this lunacy would greatly hinder my enjoyment, if there was some to be had. But it's mostly just a frustrating experience, in which you can never quite tell what direction the bloodthirsty farm equipment is barrelling down on you from; and I also couldn't, for the life of me, work out why I ran at a perfectly good clip at certain times, and at a snail pace at others.  

   I'm sure I could persevere and suss the game out some more, but that would require time. And patience. And given that I'm a dole-bludging university student who's only got one assignment to go before he's on three-and-a-half months' worth of holidays, I frankly don't have either. I have other, [i]better[/i] games to play, darn it! That said, there's always the remotest chance that the devs will make significant enough improvements and/or embellishments to render this a worthwhile buy...but at the moment, I'd say it's a wait-for-90%-off proposition at best, and even then mostly 'cause it's got cards. 

   Nice gimmick, but not nearly amusing enough in execution, I'm afraid.
