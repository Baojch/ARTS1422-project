Edge Guardian may be one of the more polished VR titles currently available at such a great price point. Granted, you're not getting a story per se, and it does fall under the ""Wave Based"" genre.

For the low cost of this game, you can get some quick fast cardio if you're punching/backhanding the targets.

Edge Guardian is an arcade game in which you have to defend your base by punching floating cubes. You can also collect dead cubes and throw them against enemies, or raise a shield on the ground to stop the floating bastards. I had a lot of fun and played 40 minutes straight. The patterns change every time so every match is different and challenging.

Armed with two giant fists you are taking on hordes of cubic robots! Furthermore, there are a number of interesting game mechanics, such as a temporary wall of light, to help you beat each wave. Although there was only one environment at the time I tried it, this was very nicely constructed and suited the genre very well.
I think this game has potential to develop further, in particular when more environments are brought out and an interesting story line is worked out!

It feels almost like I'm standing inside the game 'Journey' (graphics-wise), and that feels *amazing!*

The gameplay is active, addictive, and feels *very* distinct from other 'punching games' like Audiosheild, Bitslap, or Thrill of the Fight. 

I'm breathing pretty hard after my first few rounds, and I expect I'll be playing this a *lot* in the future!

Il gioco ha enormi potenzialità secondo me, la grafica è gradevole e ben realizzata, con un pò di attenzione si possono cogliere dei dettagli che non sto qui a spoilerare, si vede l'impegno e la passione che ci sono dietro. Molto carina anche il comparto sonoro, le musiche ricordano l'introspezione delle colonne sonore di Vangelis per Blade Runner che un'appassionato di cultura sci fi come me non ha potuto non notare.

Questa è una piccola perla nel firmamento di Steam da non lasciarsi scappare, consiglio l'acquisto anche a chi è semplicemente incuriosito ma ancora non è in possesso di un visore, sarà un valido aiuto per i sviluppatori che per chi non lo sapesse sono italianissimi.

Ecco un mio video di primissimo approccio al gioco:

The game has a nice stylised look, has no configurable settings (like many VR games) it runs at its settings at 90fps (980 here) absolutly fine and the world looks at the correct scale.

[b]Audio[/b]

Music is fiting, sound effects are suited to the title, combat sounds are good too. Music can be muted in the options if you wish

[b]VR specific[/b]

Bots do sometimes seem to be just outside the play area, and im not risking a full power punch to my wall :D

[b]Game play[/b]

You have to hit the bots in the face and with enough speed, this adds to your combo and is the main way off racking up a high score. It rates as high if not higher than holopoint for intensity, this will definatly work your back arms and shoulders well and would suit for a VR fitness routine.

[b]Overall[/b]

The core game play is in place, works and is rather fun (you must try something in VR you cant judge on looks). I have played quite a few times and my arms and shoulders are getting a real nice workout. Its priced perfectly and the devs put a lot of detail into their launch post, so I expect more things to be added in the future (Power ups changed Space Pirate Trainers gameplay in a big way, heres hoping you take notes :D)
