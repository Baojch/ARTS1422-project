Maybe a mini map showing altitude, a map path over the globe is interesting but minimally useful. Better visibility and panning/movement around station. Status of modules require clicking each individual one. should be central hub.

It is worth playing for its price point, but it has more than a few problems, so only get it on sale or in a bundle.

The game is pretty, as all the station bits are animated if possible. Your station floats above Earth in stable orbit, Your radiators will pop in and out. Your solar panels rotate to catch the best light. Periodically the station will fire thrusters to maintain stable orbit. Shuttle capsules visit your station every 2 weeks (if a dock is available) or even more often. And you can zoom in/out and rotate all around your creation.

You can pause the game, go at ""real-time"", or go 10x time. Unfortunately, there are no other speeds available. And yes, it seems graphically accurate too.

You can choose between ""simulation"" (the full economy) or ""sandbox"", where you can build anything, no economy, infinite budget, just to test your design.

In simulation mode, you start with the base module, 1 astronaut, and 6000M budget. You need at least ""small lab"" to conduct research and make money. EVERYTHING ELSE cost money to run. And as a space station, you also need power (solar panel and batteries), oxygen (oxygen generator and storage tanks), water storage tanks, and food storage, to keep the astronauts alive. Shuttles will bring water and food, but NOT oxygen. You need shuttle dock to get the resupply capsules to dock, of course, and trusses to add attachment points in order to expand the station.

The early game is extremely difficult, because a wrong move will often send the entire economy into a death spiral, as you run out of one thing or another. If you run out of money, your station goes into disrepair almost immediately. If you run out of power modules starts to lose power, and astronauts who don't get sleep are not productive. Short on oxygen, water, and food? Astronauts will abandon station and head home. And no astronauts means no lab research done, which means no income.

Once you got the station expanded to comfortably support 3 astronauts, so the lab is getting 24/7 use (3 shifts of 8 hours each) the economy is stable, and you just have to add more labs and more habitation modules and expand the station, add some RCS system  periodically, more solar panels and storage... and the station pretty much cannot fail by this time.

So the game gets kinda boring near the end-game.

Furthermore, there are many annoying quality-of-life issues. For example, it is NOT possible to change priority on the research tasks. You will often run out of time on some research contracts as you can't get to the contract with the limited lab capacity you have, esp. in early to mid-game transition (when you have only one lab), if you can't adjust priority, as the contracts don't arrive in the order of ""must start by"" date. Or if you are running out of money and you need to start a SHORT contract first to get some cash... Can't do it.

Once you got the economy stable, these problems just becomes irrelevant. Which makes the end-game phase kinda boring, even as you unlocked the bigger parts like ""large solar panel"" with research.

All in all, while the game *has* some replay value in that you can redesign the station with a different layout, there really is a very limited path through the simulation mode. And the author has indicated that the project is now bugfix only, no more new features.

So all in all, it's okay, not great.",1606674943,1606674967,True,3,0,0.529276728630065918,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The most major issue is that your early-game build order HAS to be optimal up to about 20-30 minutes in or else you'll run out of food, air, and water. After that, you're generally blown past the requirements enough that your limiting factor becomes incoming ships not being able to deliver enough resources to support any station past a certain size, since ships are on a set timer regardless of your station size or modules. You HAVE to play optimally unless you're in sandbox.

The second major issue is the save system. Sessions have to be done in a single sitting because the save system procedurally simulates through your station development from the ground up. It's not actually saving the station, per se, but rather your progress. If ANYTHING goes wrong in the simulation process for any reason, your station is lost forever. I've had stations I barely got 5 minutes into that didn't load properly and were lost forever. I've had stations I spent hours on that didn't load properly and were lost forever. It's awful.

初期資金があるていどある状態で基礎モジュールから様々な機材を増やしてうまく宇宙ステーションの状態を管理しながら自分の理想の宇宙ステーションを作ろうというゲーム。
サンドボックスモードもあるので好きな形のステーションを作ることも可能です。
ただ、設置できるモジュールの形はある程度きまっていて、種類も多くないのでそれほど自由度が高いこともなく、シミュレーションモードだと施設を拡張するのに費用が、メンテナンスに費用が、そして人員を配置するならその人たちの食料・水・酸素などの物資の確保が必要で更に電力や放熱施設も設置しなければならないので決まった形になりやすくなってしまうかもしれません。

シミュレーションモードでも時間さえかければ初期状態のラボに人を呼んでひたすら研究を繰り返すことでお金はたまりますし、人の増加を見込んでモジュールを先読みで設置すれば詰むこともないのでせっかちさんでなければそれほど難易度は高くないと思います。
ただ、最初の数十分はどんなモジュールがあるのかやどうステーションを経営するかの楽しみはありますが、それが過ぎると前述した通りステーションの設計もそれほど奥深さはなく、経営要素もひたすらラボの研究を受託するだけでなんとかなるので奥深さがないかなり浅いゲームに感じてしまいました。

他のレビューでも指摘されているそこの深さなども時間がたった今になっても改善されていなさそうなところをみると今後も期待は薄そうなので残念ながら今作の購入はオススメできません。

If you want to make story mode easy then do the following

[spoiler] The first thing is ignore the guide. Simply add the min and don't use more than 1 person. Do this until you have everything 100% stable and no changes makes your stuff unstable. Next you need to focus on 1 hab and getting a lab. Just make the station 100% stable and wait until you can build lab 2, large node, and hab 2. Once you can, focus on labs first and have 1 of each type. Then slowly build up your crew. Basically, the crew needing resources and is what will get you. If you can overcome this, then everything is on easy mode. By making 2 sets of lab 2 for each thing and being able to support 40 people. I was able to easily get a good 100 billion in a short time.

--------------------------

As of right now I can't recommend it. I purchased it for $1 from Green Man Gaming with 4 other games ( for the bundle to work $1 ea ).


The game is at a good starting point for Early Access. Wait, I just saw that it is no longer in early access - this is a shame. It looks to be a money grab if this is the case.

Good +, Bad -, Neutral ±

+ Graphics of the Earth are beautiful to look at - If this was an animated wallpaper it'd get 5 stars ( This in Real-Time of the ISS position above the planet with realistic position of other worlds, etc.. would be perfect ).
- Simple UI - Thrown together - there are some good aspects of jumping to locations but overall, it could be better.
- Short Game - It doesn't take much to get to a state where you are making more money than you can spend - Gameplay says 2 hours on my end, however I spent about 30 minutes playing before I passed out ( pain, broken neck / back and severe nerve damage, and the soothing music and lack of sleep also contributed ) - but 30 minutes and I had 7 or 9 people on board, 3 labs or so, and billions coming in. My space station was also incredibly large at that point.
- You can't auto accept research assignments - this is a huge problem because by late gameplay ( 20 minutes to 25 minutes and beyond ) you are in that menu ALL the time, you can't close it because you are chewing through the missions so quickly and if you close it you stop making money. You can only close it to re-arrange parts on the station or whatever, the rest of the gameplay you have that menu open to continuously click accept all.
- There is an overall lack of gameplay - it takes very little time in simulation mode to get to a point of generating more money than the world has,  The list of components are so few and since they are ALL displayed at any given time, you see exactly what you are able to unlock and since most are unlocked to start with, the few you can unlock don't really mean anything ( large solar panel means nothing, 3 person lab may be nice but would only cause more jobs to come in and require to be in that menu more often than 99% of late game anyway - likely 99.99% or so along with the fact that you'd be completing those missions 3x faster )...
± Actual maintaining of orbit - albeit cheap. RCS is never ending it seems. If you do not create RCS blocks every now and again, you will have too much mass for the small RCS thrusters to move you - we know this to be false. The more mass means the longer it takes to move with a small thrust, but it doesn't mean that thrust can't do it. The auto orbit stabilizer boosts for a second or so every half orbit or so - if it would be on 24/7 then you'd be able to maintain orbit - they may do this to simulate limited fuel, however adding more thrusters without more fuel storage doesn't seem be realistic either...
- Lack of options - you are forced to use their binds with no way to rebind, but you are at least given a menu showing a portion of the binds. This is negative because the menu doesn't list all of the controls. If it was only not being able to rebind I'd throw in a neutral since most of the gameplay is click based anyway.
- De-orbiting looks like a cheap way to show it. Like FSX and previous versions without special ini changes, a plane crash showed the word crash on screen and paused the game. This is no better... In short, it looks like an arcade uh-oh moment. The camera moves away from the craft or the craft moves away and down a bit, and starts spinning comically
- The manual boost button doesn't appear to work
- Time progression sucks - It is supposed to be a simulator and simulators are supposed to be as accurate as possible. Time progression in normal play mode shows an orbit every 15 seconds and in fast mode every 5 seconds or so if I recall correctly. It is too quick. In real life there are 16 orbits per 24 hour period aboard the ISS if I recall correctly - I would've liked to have seen something similar for play along with real-time progression for the main play with fast forward buttons similar to what the current play and fast forward is set at now.
- The coupling and decoupling of items is comical - when a shuttle arrives with supplies, it arrives in a decent manner depending where the docking port is. When it leaves, it looks like a magic arm takes it, moves it back 10 meters or so, then drops it.
- Some components seem to have no purpose - ie why have an airlock if it can't be used. This is proof the game isn't complete and is likely a money-grab.
- You can't unlock the large solar panels, or the 3 man lab, not that they were ever needed. Maybe a bug.
- Can't re-order accepted missions. So if you get a mission with an earlier deadline than 2 that you've accepted and 1 is being worked on, then you have to open, in the early game this is a problem, that your single person can complete the 2 previous missions before the timer expires - I wasn't so lucky on a few early missions and this may have caused the issue of not being able to unlock some missions despite completing the first 2 missions at the start of the game to unlock parts - no clue which parts were unlocked.
- The notifications UI is next to useless.. Marking something as read doesn't seem to do anything. You can't archive the posts or hide them in order to make newer posts easier to find / read.
- There is no Canadarm so if you want to re-arrange your space-craft, you have to throw away  billions of dollars in equipment to burn up in the atmosphere ( HOPEFULLY ) just to move something around. I mean, an astronaut or cosmonaut could, in reality, undock the component and attach a leash to it, put the new part in, and maneuver the piece removed into the new position by hand without the Canadarm. That option is lost to us. It doesn't matter in endless free-fall what the weight of an object is - It may take longer to gain momentum and slow it down relative to your position, but moving it is much easier than on earth so moving an object a few tonnes could be done by a single person, by hand in orbit ... if it impacted something it could cause damage though, it could probably crush someones arm if it was pinned between it and another object, although it'd likely need more momentum and the other object would need to be as heavy, or heavier, than the object being moved otherwise the smaller object would be moved / bumped out of the way almost effortlessly. What I'm saying is there should've been a way to prevent the loss of components when rearranging the station ... although since late game is 20 minutes into simulation, it really doesn't matter that hundreds of billions can be lost by detaching an item since that much money is earned in seconds.

In short - the game is not a simulator by a long shot. It is an arcade knock-off to make a quick buck ( That's the current price on GMG ). Some features don't work, some components don't do anything at all. Some parts of the space station are destroyed by no outside forces at all ( Maybe stresses are calculated in, since I made a space station 6 simple nodes long and the nodes in the front were destroyed INSTANTLY without any damage meter - this may be because the RCS was at the rear on the main unit.

It doesn't appear that you can unlock some of the tech tree for some reason. I haven't found a way to unlock the 3 man lab or the large solar array, not that they were needed - I completed all of the early missions except a few because I can't re-order accepted missions, this may have caused the issue because there were early missions to unlock some parts, which I completed.

Stable Orbit is a simplistic space station simulation. It's about building up your [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1531752938]orbital space station[/url] while managing your limited resources (h2o, food, water, energy, heat, money). There are two game modes, simulation and sandbox. In simulation mode you start with $6000M and you need to finsih research projects (profit) to keep your station alive (profitable), and to expand it furthermore. In the end it's sadly only an endless circle of research and expanse without a real goal/passion. Although I had fun and the potential is there, unfortunately the excitement doesn't [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1531753280]last that long[/url]. There's also no game mechanic that lets you get attached to your crew in any way.

I got a couple hours of play, and have done everything in the game already. After a while all you do is accept research contracts and build whatever, becuase you wont have money issues.

Usually if I get something like 1hr per $1 USD spent I'm at least not dissappointed. I didn't quite get there

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*]It is decently fun until you finish everything.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
    [*]Not worth the money even on sale
    [*]Very Narrow gameplay, nothing left to do after a couple hours
    [*]Info in the HUD is unintuitive and there is nothing explaining them
    [*]Above is even worse because there are frequently errors, where the UI will say a part is producing zero of something even though it is operational.
    [*]The assets in the game feel unpolished
    [*]There is only one way to start the game. You need to build the exact things specified in the tutorial or you wont be able to make money in time. Once you do this there is no difficulty at all. Then all you do is accept contracts until you have enough money to build your next part ad-infenitum.
[/list]

[b]Suggestions for the developer[/b]
[list]
    [*]Fix the information displayed in the UI so it is actually correct.
    [*]Add tooltips that give extended information in ambiguous parts of the UI. Especially in the Power section. The icons that are in hours under the daylight and night hours are seemingly irrelevant. I could not figure out what they were supposed to be becuase they didn't actually seem to reflect information. This is the most important part of the game becuase if you don't have power the ship starts a cascading failure. [b]Make some kind fo detailed view for the Power on the station[/b]
    [*]Add an income section. In the game's current position it doesn't need it becuase once you get started there isn't any need for it. But, later on when you finally add more to the game it would be helpful to see how much you're spending on expenses and how much you're bringing in from research.
    [*]Add some kind of option to auto accept research contracts of types that you have labs for. Right now the game is just accept contract click simulator.
    [*]Speaking of contracts, add a seperate tab for them in the meesages section that people can mostly ignore. I cant ever see what the supply pods bring becuase my inbox is just all contracts in the info section.
    [*]Of course add more gameplay.
    [*]Add some kind of ""self sufficiency"" screen in the future that can track your produciton of meals in your hydroponics, so see how much more you would need to be ""off supply drop""
    [*]Maybe add some kind of tourism modules so there are other ways to make money
    [*]Maybe a government sponsorship type deal is possible for an easy mode. Where a governent provides continual funding so that people can build things other than the exact modules in the exact order that is required now.
    [*]Scenarios (maybe scenario editor too) to give poeple some more gameplay. Such as, rescue a failing station etc.

It does a pretty good job on the balancing act aspects (e.g. - you have to balance power generation, heat dissipation, oxygen storage, water storage, food storage, crew storage, etc.), but unfortunately there are some ways in which you can just instantly and permanently screw yourself over, and there is no chance of recovery. In some ways it's similar to Banished, however I feel that in Banished you at least have a shot of recovery if it turns out winter is approaching and you haven't got any firewood stockpiled or whatever.

Stable Orbit's tutorial is...alright. It's not bad, but IMO it doesn't do a great job of pointing out the ways you can totally f**k yourself over nor does it give you strategies for mitigating that. For instance, it tells you that crew members can't traverse through vacuum (okay, makes sense) but then it's like ""now build a strut [which your crew cannot travel through] to connect things to"", ""now connect a habitation module [which they cannot get to if you connect it via the thing we just told you to build in order to connect things]"". Well geez, I sure hope nobody was hoping the tutorial would actually tell them what they need to do to succeed, wouldn't *that* be a letdown!

Or for instance, it tells you to build storage tanks for food, water, and oxygen, which get replenished when supply shuttles dock...except oh wait, NOT oxygen. Shuttles bring up food and water but for some reason they are incapable of bringing up oxygen...so until you build an oxygen generator (which you won't be able to afford because it's ruddy expensive and you need to spend that money on OTHER things to establish income) your only recourse is to just constantly keep buying oxygen tanks! Which the game does not let you know about at all--it's only until your oxygen half depleted that you go ""huh, I wonder why that's happening...""

Maybe my gripes are more with the game's tutorial than the rest of it. But in any case, I can't really well tell someone ""yeah, it's a great game, you should go and get it"" given the experience I've had thus far. FWIW after it's cooked a bit longer I am more than willing to revisit it and will be happy to change my recommendation if it's warranted.

Massive disappointment. I'm refunding this despite having bought it for less than $4.
I could maybe like this game if not for the fact that the early game is designed so that if you don't do a very specific set of decisions within a specific time frame, you will just automatically lose. I had to restart 6 times, doing nearly the exact same thing every time (approximately the same sequence of events the tutorial tells you to do) and every time I just ended up in a state of entropy that would eventually lead to a game over.
You simply don't get enough starting money, don't have reliable ways of getting more money early, and lack management features that would better help you manage your early money.

In my best and final attempt, I actually had things more or less under control, but then I noticed I wasn't getting any new crew because my oxygen was so low. Apparently the supply pods don't actually bring more oxygen either. Luckily, I had just enough money to buy an oxygen generator, so problem solved right? Nope, because now I was drawing more power than I could generate without enough money to make a new solar panel. Well I figured this was an easy solution! I'd just make oxygen until I had enough, then turn the generator off.
Except you can't turn it off. You can't disable non-essential systems temporarily to save on power. My only option would have been to eject the whole damn thing and send a literal billon dollars' worth of tech flying into space. It was at this point I decided I'd rather just give up than restart a SEVENTH time.

+++ PLUSY +++
+ ładne widoki za oknem
+ ciekawie stworzony cykl dobowy (światła miast)
+ poziom trudności stanowi wyzwanie – ale przez to może także zniechęcić co niektórych
+ aktywny rozwój gry – autor ciągle dodaje coś nowego
+ nastrojowa ścieżka dźwiękowa
+ dopracowany wygląd stacji
 

— MINUSY —
- gra nazbyt wcześnie wyszła jako wersja rozwojowa (early access) gdyż część rzeczy znajduje się w fazie opracowywania. Znajduje się w fazie rozwoju lecz z uwagi na braki w mechanice będzie zbierać negatywne recenzje. Autor mógł z wydaniem jeszcze chwilę poczekać…
- brak możliwości ustalania kolejki badań (zatrzymania / odrzucenia projektu)
- niejasne działanie wskaźnika temperatury i wykorzystania radiatorów (sumaryczne zamiast bieżących potrzeb/możliwości)
- mała niska ilość modułów do zbudowania
- trudna – drobna pomyłka w kosztach/surowcach (brak prądu/pieniędzy po prostu zdewastuje naszą rozgrywkę). Nie można budować modułów ot tak sobie – ponieważ niewłaściwa decyzja może doprowadzić nas do porażki.
- stała orbita stacji – ciągle krąży po jednej trasie a przydałoby się mieć możliwość jej modyfikacji – latać nad Polską 😀
- klawisz ESC został „niewłaściwie” wykorzystany. Z przyzwyczajenia staramy się wyjść klawiszem ESC z wszelkich menu które pojawiają się w grze – tu przenosi nas to do głównego menu

Czy zastanawiało cię kiedyś jak wygląda zarządzanie stacją kosmiczną orbitującą wokół Ziemi? Już teraz możesz się o tym przekonać a to dzięki tworzonej właśnie produkcji o nazwie STABLE ORBIT…


=== WPROWADZENIE ===
Gra Stable Orbit jest dziełem jednoosobowego studia Codalyn. Gracz ma w niej za zadanie objęcie pieczy nad stacją kosmiczną i zarządzanie nią – w tym dbanie o zapewnienia właściwej ilości środków do życia jak i pozyskiwanie funduszy na dalszy jej rozwój.



=== GRAFIKA I MUZYKA ===
Co do grafiki – gra przedstawia się ciekawie – widok to trójwymiarowe środowisko w którym przyjdzie nam budować bazę kosmiczną. Nad nami znajduje się kosmiczna pustka pełna gwiazd, pod nami nasza rodzima planeta. Stacja kosmiczna przesuwa się na orbicie okołoziemskiej tak więc pod nami znajduje się Ziemia a na niej kontynenty oraz oceany. Wraz z cyklem dobowym i zapadnięciem zmroku znać dają o osobie zgrupowania ludzkie rozjaśniając mrok świecącymi się miastami. Z nadejściem poranka wszystko gaśnie, Wygląda to ciekawie. Na początku bardzo mi czegoś brakowało tylko nie wiedziałem czego – brak jest chmur. Stacja kosmiczna jest dopracowana i jej widok cieszy oczy aczkolwiek przydałaby się większa różnorodność kolejnych z właśnie dodawanych modułów.

Muzyka i udźwiękowienie – W ostatnich update gry dodano komunikaty dźwiękowe które informują nas o mających miejsce zdarzeniach



=== ROZGRYWKA ===
Cel gry.  Naszym zadaniem jest zarządzanie stacją kosmiczną. Musimy dbać o spełnianie potrzeb przebywających na niej kosmonautów a także zapewnić im spełnienie ich podstawowych potrzeb życiowych – powietrza, wody i pożywienia. Prócz tego możemy przyjmować zlecenia od różnych firm przeprowadzenie badań w kosmosie nad różnymi technologiami za co otrzymamy wynagrodzenie – a te z kolei możemy przeznaczyć na rozbudowę naszej podniebnej placówki.

Początki; Grę rozpoczynamy z głównym modułem który został wyniesiony na orbitę okołoziemską oraz dysponując pewną kwotą pieniędzy które możemy przeznaczyć na rozwój naszej stacji i zakupienie kolejnych modułów. Wraz z postępem gry ich ilość będzie coraz większa i otworzą się przed nami nowe możliwości
 
Rozbudowa stacji:  Naszą stację możemy rozbudowywać za pomocą przyłączania kolejnych modułów do już istniejących. Każdy z nodów (łączników) posiada kilka włazów które służą nam za miejsce przyłączenia kolejnych.
Wygląda to w ten sposób, iż wybieramy lokalizację (wolny właz) a następnie z listy dostępnych modułów wybieramy ten który nas interesuje. Po jakimś czasie zostanie on stworzony (jak dla mnie brakuje tu animacji gdy rakieta z Ziemi dostarcza nam kolejny komponent) – po prostu się pojawia. Przy budowie wybranej części ma ona kolor niebieski i pozostaje nam zatwierdzić naszą decyzję. Niektóre z nich mają nieco większe rozmiary i wymagają wokół siebie nieco więcej miejsca więc trzeba je zbudować w odosobnieniu (w szczególności duże panele słoneczne). Możemy także skorzystać z rusztowania które jest dosyć tanie i pozwala przesunąć punkt mocowania nieco w przestrzeń kosmiczną.

Wydatki/Utrzymanie: Trzeba szczególnie uważać na brak gotówki – jeśli skończą nam się pieniądze – może mieć to naprawdę opłakane skutki – brak bieżących opłat na utrzymanie stacji spowoduje postęp jej degradacji a tym samym podobnie jak w przypadku uszkodzenia spowodowanego przegrzaniem jej elementów będzie nas naprawdę słowo kosztować jeśli chodzi o jej naprawę. Trzeba także pilnować kosztów jeśli wyznaczymy naprawę jakichś elementów ponieważ w przypadku wyznaczenia jednocześnie zbyt dużej jej ilości możemy dojść do sytuacji gdy utracimy całość zgromadzonych pieniędzy – a to z kolei…

Nauka. Naszym źródłem dofinansowania będzie prowadzenie badań nad różnymi zagadnieniami, które są znam zlecane przez różne firmy. Różnią się one (badania) czasem trwania (złożonością = levelem), typem zaawansowania (co przekłada się także na czas potrzebny do realizacji danego projektu) a także ilością gotówki którą pozyskamy po jej zakończeniu. Możemy pobrać jeden z projektów z naszej skrzynki odbiorczej i wrzucić do kolejki do realizacji. Niestety na chwilę obecną nie mamy żadnego wpływu na to by móc przesunąć dane badanie „do przodu” by zostało zrealizowane jako pierwsze. Na szczęście nie ma kar za nieterminową ich realizację czy też nieukończenie w terminie.

Orbita. Stacja podróżuje na wysokości około 400 km nad powierzchnią Ziemi – a to oznacza, iż ma kontakt z atmosferą, przez co zwalnia i powoli opada – update w ostatniej wersji wniósł konieczność stałego podnoszenia orbity – za pomocą zasobów tlenu będącego na wyposażeniu stacji.

OCENA: POZYTYWNA
Zastanawiałem się jaką ocenę powinienem wystawić. Z jednej strony – negatywną, ponieważ gra wyszła do ludzi nieco za wcześnie (nie jest jeszcze w pełni grywalną), z drugiej – pozytywną ponieważ wygląda ciekawie i zapowiada się na fajny tytuł. Jest nadal aktywnie rozwijana i trzeba mieć świadomość, że nie jest gotowym produktem. Na chwilę obecną zasługuje na pozytywną. W międzyczasie autor poprawił zgłaszane mu błędy – choć brakuje jeszcze kilku rzeczy by można było mówić o różnorodności i pełni zabawy. W pewnym momencie wszystko już obadamy i zacznie wiać nudą…

Wg mnie gra wyszła nieco za wcześnie z Early Access (nadal jest w fazie aktywnego rozwoju a autor przykłada się do roboty). Stadium gry wczesnego dostępu (early access) sprawia, iż nie mamy jeszcze do czynienia z gotowym produktem a zatem pozostaje uzbroić się w cierpliwość i zgłaszać autorowi napotkane problemy. Większość rzeczy już działa jednak na chwilę obecną brakuje jeszcze nieco elementów by gra była na tyle spójna by stanowić wyzwanie. Niektóre rzeczy są jeszcze niezbalansowane ale z czasem zapewne zostanie to dopieszczone. Jestem fanem wszelakich symulatorów tego typu tu jednak czuję lekki niedosyt – gra wymaga jeszcze zbalansowania.
Najbardziej jednak cieszy, iż autor jest otwarty na pomysły społeczności i stara się je realizować. Trzymam kciuki by mu się to udało – to może być w przyszłości ciekawa pozycja. Na chwilę obecną odradzam zakup – poczekaj aż gra zostanie jeszcze dopracowana i poszerzona o nowe możliwości.

It has great potential and i thought here i could expand on what i liked most in Kerbal Space Programm. Building Space Stations.

However this is for me a fine example on how Early Access should not be done. Althoug the communication was there and more honest then other devs, it still is a big dissapointment.

Early access began in november 2016. The game had high potential but only content for about 2-3 hours. Very few content and even basic features like proper save game managment (a delete button?) were missing.

The first few updates were steady and delivered what was planned.

In Juli 2017 the dev encountered Problems, realised that the more complex the game, the more time to develop and test it needs. So the roadmap was somehow changed to meet the already planned release date (http://steamcommunity.com/games/481190/announcements/detail/1341359957178550873).

End of July 2017 he already ""entered the homestretch"" and told that ""there is no way to compete with Call of Duty"" and that he worked backwards from the release date and a had to re plan what can be done in this time. 
( http://steamcommunity.com/games/481190/announcements/detail/1443819397196251950)

Best of luck, "" The game was buggy and far from e feature complete experience. Not much content has been added. Now you can have 3-4 hours fun. 

Until 16th november 2017 there were several bug fixes and a small content update. 

I would refund the game if i had still the possibility. Not for the money but for the dissapointment. I can only recommend to stay away from this 15 bucks full release alpha version.

For the price of a cinema ticket (sale) I had fun roughly two times the length of a movie (played offline, so more than the recorded time on steam). 

Pros: 

+ Great atmosphere (music and view from the orbit onto earth)
+ At the begining a nice tough challenge to figured it out 
+ Its very short, hence doenst kill hours and days of your time
(I will come back to it because its short)

Cons
- the core mechanic is too simple once you mastered it 
- after that it leaves you with not much more to do or to aim for than building your station bigger, wich is at some point very easy
- so it is a bit too short (yet does not kill too much time)
- I could not move existing modules and restructure my station (reberthing)

As a space fan, buy it on a sale. Do not expect hours of addictive play but a nice short challenge (as a station manager), you will enjoy for a short while.

•	Some models are not even finished i.e. Supply ship has no textures and a just flat 3D model with no docking port on it. 
•	The supply ship just clips right through the station then then drops strait down to earth just destroying the very little emersion this game has.
•	Other than clicking on ports and adding new parts to your station this game gets boring very quickly.
•	You are limited on the placement of objects i.e. no rotation and getting solar panels to your desired direction leaves your station looking like an utter mess.
•	Cannot reuse parts or relocate them I don’t think any space agency would ever just dump a solar array just to build a new one in another location.
•	Where is the real astro-physics?
•	Manage your stations orbit yea by letting the computer do it for you are spamming the shit out of the boost button
•	
The problem I have with this game is that it’s not listed as early access yet the game feels like It is in a very, very early alpha I know it’s only £9.99 but I have seen better mobile game at this price and do a hell lot more in fact I could buy GTA vice city for £3.99 on the play store. I have requested for a refund, but I would rebuy when the game is finished and a lot lot more new features are added 

And to the dev’s I will give you some free hints; able to go inside the station, rotate struts, mini games on the repairs, disable systems to save power, become one of the astronauts in the station and complete tasks.

Fairly addictive
Replayable
Station layout is up to you

The fun part of the game is on the first part, where you are trying to ""make it"". If it takes you a few tries, then it could be worth the price. But if, like me, you succeed on the first try, then it's not quite.

It only takes about 1 to 2 hours to get to such a point at which money is a nonissue. Which means after that point, it's merely endless and repetitive expansion. It gets rather clicky as it becomes increasinly difficult to navigate the station with so many things on the screen (my use of gimbal nodes didn't help)

And there really aren't much replay value, there aren't enough random events to make the experience sufficently different. Unless you get extremely unlucky and experience shuttle grounding and/orr module loss really early, there really is no difference to be had.

I think what the game needs is more random event someway into the game. Not at the start, as it would merely piss people off to fail due to bad luck. But say a hour or so in (or say 2 years game time?), let the disastors rip. Make it a game that test your ability to build the station robustly with backup plans, redundencies and backup plans to your backup plans. Continue the ""fight for survival"" feel of the initial stages and then it might have some prolonged playing value.

Also, please do fix the water, it's super annoying to have to build a dock for every other person on board. I'd like the pod to send me nothing but water thank you very much, and perhaps let me invest in bigger pods? And maybe buy increased frequency on the same dock instead of just spamming more. I mean when you have a long rod of big nodes filled with docks, there is something wrong (and it also looks wrong... granted a space station with thousands of module and hundreds of peopel long passed looking right)


Overall verdict: not exactly bad, but not worth the price. If there is way to partially refund, I would do it. But it is worth 3-5 bucks IMO so I'm not going to rob the developer of all the money.

Pick it up on a sale.

The Good: This game is very pretty, and the background music is very relaxing. Once you figure out the inital stabilzation and priority of work (basically just follow the ""tutorial""), you can build and build and build until you have a monsterous space station that looks like it was designed on the whims on a drunk man sitting in his living room.

The Bad: There are no panels that tell you if you have too many of this or not enough of that. The guagues at the bottom of the screen, to me, were vague at best. For a space station, I would imagine efficency is key, I would expect readouts telling me if I am utilizing all of my storage tanks to capacity or if I've got a bunch that are not needed and wasting space. 
The notification panel provides useless information, once I have 75+ people on board and 25+ research projects going on, I don't care when one is completed, it doesn't matter to me anymore. I only care if I lose power or if a module decides to jettison itself back to earth. When a module does blow away on its own accord, the notification panel is useless on telling me where it came from so I can replace it. And that leads me to the biggest problem of this game, once the station is so large, it is difficult to get around it. The camera focuses on the last module you clicked on, so getting from the front to the back is like climbing a ladder, The controls are so simplistic there is no reason I cant control the camera with WASD and free float it around, and if I can do that, it was not clear in the 5+ hours of how to do that.",1508082889,1508082889,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Stable Orbit is a simulation and management sim set on a space station orbiting Earth that is largely inspired by the International Space Station.  Gameplay consists of making a space station that can sustain it's sole occupant at the start, then expanding to hold a laboratory, which makes it possible to perform research, which is your meal ticket and means of survival.  From there, you increase the size of the station through building trusses to hold new additions to your station, add solar panels and batteries to make the station capable of supporting more units, storage for food, water, and oxygen, then build radiators to dissipate heat.  From there you can build more nodes to increased the habitable parts of the station, habitat moduels to sustain larger numbers of crewmembers, laboratories to take on more contracts.  After all this expansion, you'll have to eventually build another thruster on the bottom of the station so your amazing creation doesn't fall into the Earth's atmosphere, and totally disintegrate.

Graphics and Sound:

Graphics in Stable Orbit are absolutely nothing short of breathtaking.  If you love space and sci-fi games, you're going to be aroused, and I do mean in the sexual sense!

The view Stable Orbit is in full 3D, so if you get tired of looking away from the Earth, you can always look down at it to see the current location of the station in regards to the Earth.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1165281798

What if you don't know geography well enough to be able to tell where the station is in relation to the Earth?  Not to worry, there's a map you can access that shows the station's present location, along with the track of everywhere the station goes around the world.

The music in Stable Orbit works very well with the game.  In fact, the music is good enough to where I forget that I should be playing my own sort of music while I play the game.  I wanted to say that the sounds of the game are realistic, except for one problem:  This game is in space, and being in a vaccum, it's impossible for sound to travel anywhere, so if you were actually viewing the station from the angles you can view it, you wouldn't actually hear anything as it happened.

Positives:

Anyone who loves games that involves building stuff will have a great time with Stable Orbit.  Being the management sim lover I am, Stable Orbit fills the bill for a subgenre of games where there's almost nothing in the way of competition.  I've played enough games in Stable Orbit's genre to know that I love building cities, building armies, building sports teams, and even building buildings, so I can honestly say I've enjoyed building a space station in Stable Orbit.

Contracts that are required to make money are all fascinating.  Although it's really just the money that matters, the game does add harmony to the game's experience by telling you just exactly what sort of research you're assigning to any astronauts, and exactly who it is you're doing research for.  (Or at least simply who's paying you to do the research.)

Negatives:

When you're looking down at the planet Earth, there's no clouds to speak of.  Although I personally would like to see the occasional hurricane (or regional varient thereof), but all you're treated to, is a CAVU (Ceiling And Visibility Unlimited) view of the Earth.  Does Earth weather add to the gameplay value?  I'd have to say not really, as nice as it would be to see some variety that makes the player want to point the camera downward as much as the player would like to point it upward to see spectacular views of outer space.

The biggest negative of Stable Orbit would have to be the lack of achievements in the game.  As a result, this motivates the player to almost exclusively take on Earth & Space research contracts, which are the most lucrative sorts of contracts.  (Although the game does provide some balance by making less-lucrative contracts shorter to complete, but it seems pointless given the way that either way, you're going to be waiting in the early stages of the game before you can build additions to your station.)

Conclusion:

Although Stable Orbit represents a niche game which non-fans of management sims would likely find uninteresting, those who do enjoy repetitive games from the genre will find Stable Orbit fascinating.  I was lucky to have been awarded a free key for Stable Orbit, because I found myself unable to play the game I was most hooked upon at the time of the awarding.  The two main questions any game would have, is replayability factor and value for money.  For Stable Orbit, the answers are ""yes"" and ""yes.""  If you got the guts (and patience) to take on contracts other than Earth and Space research, you can do that.  If you want to simply try and build the coolest, craziest, happiest, saddest, or perhaps even ugliest space station you can, you can always challenge yourself to do that!  Value for the moeny?  I've played far less interesting games that costs even more money than Stable Orbit (and promptly refunded them), so go ahead and buy this game, and especially if you can buy Stable Orbit while it's on sale, because there's no way you can count on winning a free key!",1507937255,1511577736,True,12,1,0.622368752956390381,1,False,True,False,False,,,

Stable Orbit
-------------
A single-player space station management simulator.

I'm partial to simulators, so I may be a bit biased, but here goes...
I have about 20 hrs. into this game and have, after several disasters, managed to get a nearly self-sustaining and stable station going, but it was hard as hell to figure out the best way to do that without either going broke or having the station break down and my crew die.
There is not a lot of action in this sim, you can follow the orbit and choose when to add on to the ""core"" or starting module of the station, but be careful what you build and when or you will go broke fast, and if you don't have atleast one lab and one crewmember, you cannot make any money.
Speaking of money, I think this sim starts you out just a bit on the low side. You start with a budget of 6000M which starts dropping immediately due to operational costs of the core in orbit. Since your money is slowly 'eaten away' by these hidden expenses, you will have to make your station habitable, with a functioning lab to make money, very quickly.
The key things for your lab to be habitable for crew is water, oxygen, food and power. If any one of these are missing in the early stages of your station construction, you will fail.

Overall, I like this sim, it's an early release, so it does need a little work, but the gameplay is very smooth and the graphics, while a little on the 'basic' side, have potential. The engine seems to be optimized well at this stage, I maintained a steady 60FPS in 1080p HD over my 20 hrs. on this game.
I'm not aware of any VR version of this game, though I think it might not be a bad idea, should the developers decide to go that route.
I've by no means reached an 'end-game' point in this game so there's really no way of saying how this game might end, but I see two possibilities:
1. You finally run out of money to maintain your creation and it comes crashing to Earth due to lack of maintenance.
2. You build a station so massive that you cannot keep it in orbit any longer, despite how much money you may have, and it eventually falls to Earth.

This sim is roughly based on the ISS (International Space Station) and the devs have said that the ISS was the inspiration behind this sim, so as you expand your station, you almost can't help but see some similarities to the ISS in the modules that you add on as you expand.
I have not yet unlocked everything, and I have seen some claims on the discussion page for Stable Orbit, that these don't seem to be 'unlockable', so who knows for sure, this is an early access beta afterall... lol

There are points in this sim where you basically will do nothing but keep an eye on things and assign contracts to your lab, so there are some 'boring' spots in it, other times, Murphy's Law kicks in and you are frantically trying to repair key systems and keep your station in orbit and your crew alive.

For concept: It has potential, so I give that an 8/10
For Graphics: Smooth and steady 60 FPS in 1080p HD (1920x1080 resolution). Models are sharp and look nice, the Earth and space textures, while looking somewhat realistic, don't really look realistic enough, at this stage in it's development.
Because of this, I give it a 9/10.
For replayability: Unless there are some more modules and design options in the works, I don't see any real replayability outside just repeating the design that lasted the longest... 5/10
Overall Design: The GUI is very easy to follow, not a lot of submenus to deal with and everything is spelled out rather simply. This sim is very easy to just 'pick-up and go' as far as the menus and controls are concerned, and yes, it appears to be controller compatible, though I haven't tried one out on it yet. 10/10

Overall Score: 8/10 (If you like simulators, that is..)
If you are a sim fan like me, I highly recommend that you give it a spin, or at the very least, keep an eye on it. I have a feeling it just may improve over time.",1507524039,1507524039,True,7,0,0.57980048656463623,2,True,False,False,False,,,

After 15 hours in-game i feel i've seen enough and played enough to make a review of this game.

Let's start saying that this game is far away from being completed. There are some critical bugs, but the developer is always ready to fix them and that's a very good point for me.
What is Stable Orbit? Stable Orbit is a space station building simulator, simple as that. Beginning from a main core, use junctions and attach houses for your crew, labs for well payed researches, oxygen food and water supplies and so on.
The most difficult part is the first 20-30 minutes, where you struggle for oxygen and energy, keeping your 1, 2 or 3 people survive until the station is enough big and well crafted to support a grand quantity of basic things like food or water. If you manage to do that, the next hours are gonna be easier, where the money spent will be less than the money gained by researches. The crew will keep getting bigger, and so the station and your wallet.
And then you've got nothing more to do. No achievements, no objectives, nothing. If you manage to build a stable autonomous station, you've seen all of the game. So why should i recommend it?
Because i think that's just the beginning. It has a great potential, and if the developer keeps his hand on it, this game could become better and better. As now, i'm really, really enjoying it.

Pros:

+ Technically astonishing
+ Quite challenging for the first 0,5-1 hour

Streamed the game for about 5 hours on my Twitch channel... and I got about 5 hours of entertainment out of it. Finally declared victory when we had determined that you could put rotating nodes on rotating nodes ad infinitum to make a Space Flail, broke 1 trillion dollars, and were making money faster than we could spend it. 

Like many buiding games, it takes a little creativity to get the most out of... the game doesn't present you with all the possible problems to solve, but a little applied engineering can add some challenge. For example, we worked at trying to design a self-sufficient Lab/Hab Module design, that could be stacked end-to-end to increase station capacity.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Gives a very basic intro to some of the systems used on the ISS IRL: solar panels and batteries, water recyling, supply delivery, etc.
[*]Shows a very basic form of orbit degradation and requires you to boost the station, although it doesn't explain why the orbit would degrade (atmospheric drag)
[*]Lets you explore some more complicated concepts, like making sure you have enough battery storage to keep the labs and habs running throughout the ""night"" period.
[*]Looks rather nice, if not ground breaking. 
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[*]Tutorial was basic, but took some guess, test, and revise to determine the correct build order for the early game. Almost felt roguelike as we'd hit the *next* issue and have to restart. Not very forgiving for new players who don't have time to stick with it or understand what failed.
[*]Parts lack basic stats so you can preplan your moves... ie, this module will consume this much energy per hour and produce this much heat per hour. This radiator will dissipate this much heat per hour. Must guess at first, and makes it hard to optimize designs. 
[*]Limited control over station operations, ie SHUT DOWN THAT LAB UNTIL THE RADIATOR IS COMPLETED.
[*]Limited info on contracts... ""research units"" to complete, estimated time, etc. Can't reorder them or reprioritize once accepted
[*]New Research Contract. New Research Contract. New Research Contract. Really needs an ""auto accept all"" once you get to a certain level, or at least slow the incoming queue to something your station may be able to keep up with.
[*]Not currently a lot of replayability
[/list]

[b]Realism Nitpicks:[/b]
[list]
[*]When boosting the station, it illustrates RCS-style thrusters firing anti-radial, a common misconception. When the ISS boosts, it doesn't boost ""up""... it boosts ""forward"" (prograde) to increase it's velocity, raising it's altitude on the oppsite side of the orbit. 
[*]RCS Style thrusters aren't really used for boosting... instead, they're mainly used for desaturating the Control Moment Gyros which help the station keep it's orientation. Boosting is done by visiting vehicles (Russian Progress craft) or main engines installed on the Russian Zvezda module. Maintaining altitude on the station is more about ensuring there are often-enough visiting craft, or enough thruster fuel... not about adding more thrusters.
[*]Boosting happens way too often... IRL it needs to be done every 2-3 months, not every two minutes like in the game. Began to be distracting, especially since there was no resource management around fuel. 
[*]Gah, please leave the little not-quite-Dragon supply pods at the station as emergency egress for the crew. IRL we dont just leave astronauts up there with no way to leave *immediately*. Would be a cool mechanic to require enough berthing points for craft to allow all crew to leave in a hurry.
[*]The timing of module delivery seemed way off, would rather things occurs over months instead of days. I understand that it needed to be arcadified to allow passage of time without an annoying day-night-day-night flash cycle 16 times a day, but it would be great to get a better feel of ""planning in advance"" because parts don't magically appear.
[/list]

[b]Opportunities[/b]
[list]
[*]I was personally hoping for some launch management mechanics when I first saw the game... scheduling launches, handling payload mass to deliver parts and supplies, choosing rockets, etc. For example, an expensive heavy lift for new modules, vs a cheaper supply craft with limited big-part payload capacity. A cheaper rocket that would be more likely to fail or be delayed, or a more expensive rocket that was more reliable and on-time. Maybe BEAM-style expandable modules that could be unlocked for more pressurized space on orbit but smaller lifters for delivery.
[*]Would love to see a basic ""launch"" animation when starting a new station, instead of ""your root module magically appears in orbit!""
[*]Other ways to get funding besides the labs would be great, small commercial cubesat releases, space tourism, etc. 
[*]A loan system for new players, so the first time you need some repairs it's not game over, start from scratch. 
[/list]

Overall, I'd recommend the game... even if it's not an ISS simulator, we were able to compare the game's mechanics to the real world.

Pár rad do začátku: nezapomeňte na chlazení, CHLAZENÍ a zase chlazení, dostatek energie, vzduchu, vody a jídla. Poté laboratoř a ze začátku jí nespecializovat... Co možná nejdříve postavte port pro zásobovací lodě.  Pak už je čas na hab...a jedeme...

Ok, so it's got a couple of bugs, which I've found aren't game-breaking - but don't let that put you off.

Overall, it seems well designed and  even though I think that the tutorial could do with being expanded just a touch, it's thoroughly enjoyable. I'm sure the developers will be adding in new features as time goes by - or at least I hope they will because there's a lot of scope for expansion here.

A couple of tips to get you started.

1) Follow the tutorial. Even if you think you're goin to be a natural when you first start, follow the tutorial - then restart the game, if you wish.

2) Don't be tempted into taking on a huge contract before you have the Oxygen Generator - and this is the bit that's missing in the tutorial - if you focus on money and just money too early, you'll have problems, because you'll be stuck 3/4 of the way into your research and have no money left when your crew leaves.

Finally, don't forget to put RCS Thrusters onto the station. These will keep you from falling out of orbit.

Overall, a great game and I'm looking forward to updates from the developers. Thoroughly recommended. It's discounted too, so give it a try...

It's being actively worked on.

I got it while 33% discounted, so my opinion is based on that price.

First, this game is a roguelike, which I didn't expect. Your station is saved at the point you leave it. If your station falls out of orbit, it's gone. Loading the save just gets you an empty orbital position. There's no incremental or manual save options. It makes for an interesting mechanic.

The UI currently lets it down, as it feels like it hasn't been properly audited before release. There's now a basic tutorial, but you can't globally disable it and it will prompt on each new instance. UI scaling has just been disabled to fix another bug, which means on my 1024x1280 screen, the info bar at the bottom has text about 4 pixels high, which makes judging the current status very hard. Likewise the icons are tiny. There also aren't any tooltips, where items have descriptions it appears it's missing information, resource quantities modules provide are always zero in the purchace descriptions. It also feels it's a bad omission that modules don't list their stats for production & consumption. It means it's very hard to plan ahead. What's my stations current mass? How much does this newly researched module weigh? Will my station fall out of orbit if I add it? Or will I get brown-outs from unexpectedly high power consumption?

You can however wing it by watching the balance bars in the status bar, but it would be nice to plan ahead with more accuracy.

Overall it's an enjoyable thing to play and quite pretty. It feels like a solid base in need of some editing. That in-game options duplicating options from the loader window seems like an example of that.

I would hope that additional challenges & technologies are added later, as once you get the knack of balancing resources, I could see just waiting for research to complete get a bit tiring. Maybe a manager to hire? Or at least a way of sorting tasks by expiry or type.

The only thing I'm honestly sad about is that the branching construction system means you can't reconnect ends. For example, trying to put a truss all the way around a rotating habitat as a cage.

Originally I thought this was a pre-release; knowing that it is a 1.0 release I DO NOT recommend this game. It still needs to be finished.

This is a beautiful game to play or sit back and watch. 

 I lost the first station to RNG about an hour in when my lab (the ONLY way to make money) was randomly removed from my ship in an ""event."" Immediate loss since getting up and running requires you to spend a lot of money, leaving you unable to pay the big bucks when you get punched with these events too early.

My second playthrough I got to 5 astronauts and 2 labs with 150 O2, 3K Water, 2.5K Food and only losing ~25% total battery life at night. Then I specialized my second lab into tech (so I could unlock extra/large parts.) The only unlock that worked was for the large solar panel array. The other items stayed locked and doing research to unlock the other specializations actually locks those specializations so you can't use them. 
Those are what we gamers call GAME BREAKING BUGS.
I understand wanting to make a difficult and realistic game; however, having early game stations which literally live paycheck to paycheck take full piece destruction like that is not possible without losing or keeping a ridiculously high rainy day fund in reserve. 

New users:
Just to get a station running you need to build the following:

A Lab - Your only way to bring in income.

Batteries - Although not mentioned anywhere, if your station runs out of power at night, the shuttle will not launch to bring you supplies and crew. (Testing it showed that you cannot start without batteries, the shuttle will never leave with the crewman you need to man the lab.)

Oxygen Generator - I found that spending the $1B off the bat for this instead of buying oxygen tanks saves you a lot of trouble. (Your crew will die between drops otherwise.)

Water Tank - The Windows Generic Female Voice will not shut up about your fatal and depleting water levels (50L or base starting water levels BTW) until you buy a water tank. 

RCS Thrusters - A part that relies on guesswork since the stats are non-existent. This keeps your ship up. If you are constantly having the WGFV yell about altitude then you need more of these.

Waste Disposal - Honestly, not sure how any of the waste is calclated but this prevents ecxess weight from forcing your station down faster. 

At this point your ship should be semi-stable. Upgrade some storage tanks, add some more solar arrays.

Easiest way I found to accomplish anything was to stabilize a one crew ship then specialize a lab in Earth and Science and perform the lengthy but well-paying contracts. 

This game is not yet user friendly. Some contracts when undertaken restrict your labs from those specs instead of unlocking them. Further the new rooms don't seem to unlock at all. When repairing your ship, there is no cost estimate. If you hit repair it just starts draining money, leaving you without the ability to compair the price for repair against the price for replacement. 

---ALWAYS KEEP $1.5 BILLION AVAILABLE---

At any point the game will take a module from you with one of its random events. If that module was your only lab and you are sitting on $400 Million, that is game over.

Original review:
Purchased and installed the game today, bug fix solved some problems. Due to the limited starting funds there is little variation how to start the station to become self sufficient and profitable. Best hint: Start with only one small solar array and  save some funds for critical repairs and replacements. O2, H2O and other storage utilities can be upgraded to enhance capacity. Game is quite interesting until you earn enough bucks, but it becomes boring due to the lack of new challenges. Large solar panel, habitat and lab are still locked, couldn't figure out what purpose the airlock offers. This game resembles a bit the old Space M.A.X. game but seems to be unfinished. I recommend this game, because it offered for some hours great fun and in prospect of further developments it can become a real jewel.

The concept is great and it has more potential but it lacks depth. Once you know what to do the game becomes very repetetive. I really hope the dev keeps improving it (But to be honest i fear for that since it's final release and made by 1 person).

But i can say it worth it's money for me, i just enjoy the building part of it. Keep in mind, the game comes without a manual or tutorial so for gamers not used to this sort of games it can get fustrating.

Don't worry, i also at least had to restart 10 times before i got the hang of it.

This should be the first stage of early access, with another 2 years to put some meat on the bones and give it a good polish.

Its a great idea with a little polish and some more content a good game and good value,if you dont like bugs leave it for now and come back after a patch or 2.

1) There is no tutorial what-so-ever in game. You are thrust looking into your initial 'base' piece. <Has been fixed as of 1.0.2, but still very basic> 1/10/2017

2) Running in windowed mode seems to just 'shrink' textures and text, making models look very poor, even with max AA, as the edges are jagged. As of 1.0.2 the textures are still jagged in windowed or fullscreen, even with AA. It's more irritating on the edges/lines of objects, but it's a personal issue.

3) Because there is no tutorial, and minmal UI (Aside from the messages on the right slide-out window) you can't tell what is happening, where the contracts are... no 'summary' of stats or what is going on. <There was a UI bug that has been fixed as of 1.0.2 as well> 1/10/2017

4) No keybinds or keyboard shortcuts displayed, if there are any

I have played a small amount of the game which you can see in this let’s try.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYVpFWMpaTY&t=25s

Firstly it should be said I love the concept. Managing a space station is a great idea and although we have seen it before in games like spacebase they are always based well in the future where players are colonising massive structures for people to live. This is about astronauts carrying out their jobs and surviving in the current day.

The game looks great, and plays well. I would suggest a slight change to the labels when items are being built. A couple of times I couldn’t find the marker to tell what I had or hadn’t built.

My only issue with the game is the lack of human element. Astronauts arrive at your station but we don’t see them they just have a name and a job. Without this connection to my astronauts I find I don’t really feel bad if they have no food or drink. Or its too hot or cold. This is my preference however. 

My only other issue is the longevity, once you have built everything where do you go? Still if you love space then I would recommend trying this. If you want something a bit more story driven go with rimworld.

Summary:
- Music is really amazing and relaxing
- Concept of game is great, it's basically a colony management sim except you're managing a space station
- Lack of options and polish, game didn't work on my PC until I started messing with registry keys
- Lack of depth. It took me four tries to get a stable station. This was great fun to do. However, this all took me about an hour to do, and once I had everything working, there was basically no reason to continue. You can build a bigger ship, but it doesn't necessarily increase the challenge.
- Needs many more components and things to research. Random events in their current state are not fun (woops you lost your solar panel...yay!)

There is no way to generate money on the side to get more items. If the crew complains they need something and do not get it (because you are short on funds) they just leave the station on the next supply shuttle and with not crew you do not generate any funds. The supply shuttle in the simulation portion seemed to not deliver any supplies or empty the waste (another reason the crew would flee the station).

[b]Stable Orbit[/b] is a space station management game with detailed, realistic graphics.  The game runs very well on Linux, and I've not encountered any of the issues reported by users of other operating systems.

The game centers largely around managing resources to support the station's crew.  Crew members earn money by completing science experiments.  Earning potential scales with crew size, and larger crews require a larger station.  Building onto the station increases heat absorption, and heat must be radiated into space to prevent station damage.  The passage of time is controlled by the player, allowing for a stress-free gaming experience.

Stable Orbit is an early access game that, in its current incarnation, lacks depth and difficulty.  The only challenges occur early on, as one struggles to understand how resources and systems interact.  Once figured out, designing a stable and profitable station is trivial.

All in all, Stable Orbit is a good game.  It is well-suited for people with limited amounts of time on hand, as well as those who do not wish to devote a lot of time to a game.  At the same time, Stable Orbit is ideal for anyone who wants to spend hours building the largest station possible.",1501414660,1501414660,True,7,0,0.60370558500289917,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Sul versante audio non ci vuole niente tranne effetti di repertorio per me, ma per una colonna sonora ci vuole mooolto ma mooooolto di più.

Uscito ufficialmente su Steam il 27 settembre 2017, dimostra in pochi giorni di essere all'altezza delle basilari aspettative. Non mi sarei aspettato un cambio nell'interfaccia grafica utente, che risulta stravolta ma migliorata sotto quasi tutti gli aspetti ( qualche informazione in meno), e invece desideravo che si potessero scorrere alcune informazioni con la rotella del mouse, e sono stato presto giustamente esaudito.

Sono stati introdotti nuovi moduli sfiziosi, e la stazione spaziale può ora mostrare ulteriori animazioni salienti.

A mio dire l'interfaccia potrebbe tranquillamente slittare a scomparsa, oppure poter essere resa visibile a comando; nelle fasi più cerebrali capisco sia utile avere più cose fissate in vista, ma non dispero riguardo nuove modifiche.

优点：
操作上比ksp简单太多，所有的空间站结构不需要你一步步操作去对接，而是直接生成的。这无疑是手残党的福音。
（当然想要更有挑战也更有成就感的空间站建设还是ksp比较好）

画面还是比较精致的~

缺点：
很明显 还是游戏的early access版本，很多内容都不够健全 。
比如1.任务系统做的还是很粗糙的到后期任务会来的很多都来不及点0.0，钱也会花花的流进你（G胖）的腰包，会陷入一种程序性的单调游戏进程。
2.外太空真的很安全呀（除了过热没有什么对太空站的实际威胁）
3.给予玩家的数据还相对较少，我很想知道我造了几个科学研究站需要多少人来工作0.0总不能要我一个一个桶去数吧0.0

虽然现阶段缺点比优点多而且很明显，但这个游戏无疑有着很大的潜力，比如推出新的空间站建造模块，新的任务模式（观光客啊，科学大会啊什么的）。总之对这个游戏还是有很大的期待的！

++++++++

Game has been released, a few pretty harsh bugs that were not in Early Access showed up. Bad news I lost all my stations, good news, I got to build them all over again with better designs! Love the gimbaled nodes, so I can have rotating structures. Game is lacking in that we cannot build large rings, agro modules, or expandable large structures. It is desiged for a casual gamer who wants to spend a few hours putting a little station together, I kind of over did things and built stations a couple of orders of magnitude bigger. Still the game managed to handle it well and I had fun. So I recommend it for the guys who in the middle ages would build little ships in bottles. Here we build stations in Space instead.

++++++++

Good News is that the game is pardon the pun, stable. Saves appear to work again and we have large nodes and 3 sizes of Agro modules. Cost a bundle tho and they use up a lot of water.

If you want a unique experience, with a few quirks and understand you are supporting an indie developer with a good vision and ideas then get it, but understand it's not currently much of a game.

Early Access 7/10 for its current state, and including the vision of what the final product is.  Will add to this when it goes into RTM

Hru jsem zakoupil až po vydání velkého updatu s názvem Vector, takže nemám srovnání s původní verzí.

K hře samotné: pokud někdo hrál SSM (Space Station Manager), velmi lehko člověk pochopí princip a návaznosti jednotlivých modulů, které si můžete postavit u své vesmírné stanice. Na začátku hry začínáte s hlavním modulem a malou zásobou peněz, dostačující na stavbu nejzákladnějších (a také nejdůležitějších) modulů - solární panely, generátor kyslíku, chladící panely, obytné jednotky, laboratoře, skladiště vody, jídla, vzduchu, baterie apod.

Cílem je tedy použití těch modulů, díky kterým může vesmírná posádka přežít pohodlně na stanici a díky postaveným laboratořím vydělávat důležité peníze, které můžete zpět investovat do stavby své vlastní orbitální stanice.

Klady:
+ velmi pěkná grafika
+ jednoduchost pochopení principů
+ odpočinková a nenáročná hra
+ příjemná hudba
+ aktivní vývoj hry
+ velký potenciál a přidávání nových funkcionalit

Zápory:
- absence manuálu nebo tutorial (ale dle mého není třeba)
- velmi titěrný text a popisky (možná dle mého rozlišení?)
- zatím omezené počty modulů ke stavbě
- zhruba za dvě hodiny máte postavenou luxusní vesmírnou stanici a už jen vyděláváte peníze

It is nice to look at. The music is relaxing (until you get you hear the vocal track). The idea of building my own space station is interesting.

I've only a hour play time before this review, and there probably won't be much more. Not in its current state. There doen't seem to be a point to the game. 
Build enough core items (water tank, oxygen generator/tanks, power source, etc) to keep a person alive. Build a science module to give said person something to do, and to earn money. Use said money to build the same, and additional living quarters, for more people to arrive at your station. Repeat. Repeat.
There is some forethought needed in planning your station. Although I'm not sure how much. Does the science module in front of the solar array actually effect the amount of power generated? 

Give me a challenge. Some random events. Something that makes my crew come down with Space Madness. Make the powers on Earth demand that a indepth study of Pigs in Space, and all the resulting puns, is required to ensure the funding continues. And let me be able to delete messages. 

I understand what Early Access is. I understand the game is intented to evolve and grow. I understand that this may never become the game I want.

Can I recommend the game as it stands now? 
I am hesitant to do so. If you want any kind of challenge it isn't for you. Not yet.

Would I recommend the game, if the developer actually completes everything on the development roadmap? 
Yes. Without hesitation.

I guess it comes down to the fundemental flaw with early access. Do you trust a developer enough to pass over your money? You already know my answer to that question.

TL;DR - Visually pretty, bug free, somewhat playable (Early Access), space station building sim (external view only).  
If you love space sims, I'd say go for it.   If you're not a space junky, then you might save your cash for when it's further along.

Even with the limited complexity of the Early Access state, it took me two stations to max out the game's current potential, which consists of balancing basic crew needs (literally haveing a powered habitat module), very simple thermal control, then power, water and O2.  WIth the generic ""lab module"" in place, crewmen can ""work"" and make $ which allows the purchase of necessary staiton bits.

The thrill ends when you have a few labs running 24/7, with crew assigned to all three shifts... and you've managed to purchase everything there is to be bought.

It took me about an hour to get there, but it was a fun hour.

Looking forward to the coming releases and of course 1.0.

I HOPE that this game will allow one to go INSIDE the station at some point.  That would be fantatsic...  maybe Vive and Oculus support?

With the Perihelion update the game gets sufficient content for the average punter to consider supporting a game in a favoured genrre. It's still not yet 'engaging' but it is certainly progressing along nicely and, based on current progress, should arrive at a fun little niche game. In it's current state expect maybe 4-5 hrs gameplay if you teach yourself, maybe 2-3 hrs if you read the guides. Afer that it begins to tail off and really only allows gameplay to continue just playing with the sandbox. Whilst I like the game, and have enjoyed playing, I think it still needs some sort of gameplay mechanic to really make it engaging. The orbit/disaster patch coming out in a few months may well achieve it. Looking forward to it.

But that currently the only negative thing I have to say about Stable Orbit, since the Developer Roadmap looks pretty ambitious and I am sure that the additional features (like thrusters to maintain the orbit or additional modules) will help the game become better and more long time motivating.

An additional feature I would like to see are Building Missions that provide a target to build a certain amount of a certain module (e.g. ""The European Space Travel Agency demands the presence of at least to middle sized laboratories on the station"").

A more extensive review:

You start with a small module in space. You add on a lab to make you money, solar panels for energy, habitats so your astronauts can sleep and heat vents to vent heat to space. 

At first, it is tricky to balance it. But you figure it out. Once that's done you've won the game! (Unless you enjoy just continually building the same combination of modules over and over again while you earn billions of useless money)

If you added in challenges, like random damage, debris strikes, astronaut freak outs.... any random event it might be a game. But as it stands it's little more than a Space Station Building Simulator (Think walking simulator style).

Though it is pretty good and beautifull.
The planet graphics is really good, and music also give you a scence of calm and make you feel relaxed.
The modules on the space station is well done and nice.

The building of the space station is easy to learn.
All in all I do not have negative comments on the above part of the game.

Where the game lack some work ( it is early access so expected ) is the gameplay.
You can only build a few things and you earn money for new modules by doing research.
This happen automatic when you have astronauts onboard.

Once you have your first basic station setup with power/cooling/1 habitat / 1 researce module / 1 docking module then the game more or less become very much just a waiting time to earn money to build the next thing.
No real challenge or disasters i notised.  ( I only played for like 60 minute so maybe i just did not encounter it yet ).
The game is very easy once you get the basic things and there for there are not really that much gameplay.
You can more or less just wait till you get funds while doing nothing, and then install a new module and repeat.

I do think the game look good and promising, and I will put the game on pause for some month and come back and follow the development now and then.

[b]Flares, Big Hair and Disco[/b]

Those are the three words that sum up the 70's for me, but there's a lot more to the polyester decade than Boney M. and the Bee Gees.
Whilst the western world was listening to John Lennons ""Imagine"" and losing interest in the American Moon landings, the Soviets took their own giant leap for mankind with the launch of the first space station Salyut 1, this was the first step towards a permanent manned presence in space and a proof of concept for the following Salyut missions.
Back in the west there was a very different but just as significant ""first"" taking place in the form of the commercial release of something called ""Pong"".


[b]Smell the Future[/b]

Pong was of course the table tennis inspired arcade machine which managed to introduce ""gaming"" to the masses and make a buck or two for Atari in the process.

Pongs popularity was such that it led Atari to release ""Home Pong"" (not something you get when you break wind in your living room but rather a home games console which allowed fans to enjoy virtual ping-pong without leaving the house.)
This was the start of a revolution in home entertainment.
The humble paddle and ball game (well, stick and square game) paved the way to the mainstream world of gaming we all find ourselves living in today, a world where anything can be simulated, from table tennis to truck driving, space invaders to space stations, everything is fair game.

Which is great for us, we're living in a golden age of virtual entertainment, since Pongs release in the 70's the games industry has gone from strength to strength, but can we say the same about our extraterrestrial endeavours?


[b]Stairway To Heaven[/b]

Remember that space station we spoke about? Salyut 1?
That was launched in the same year as Pongs release, but it wasn't quite so long lived, orbiting the Earth for just 6 months before it fell like a led zeppelin in to the upper atmosphere.

The death of Salyut 1 was followed by several other short lived stations before the construction of the more enduring Skylab and Mir platforms in the 70's and 80's (both of which have subsequently died a fiery death).
Of course we now have the International Space Station, with 4 giant solar arrays providing power to over a dozen pressurised modules, powerful batteries and sophisticated telemetry.

The ISS is a modern wonder and one of mankinds greatest contemporary achievements.


[b]The Long and Winding Road[/b]

So we have the disco decade to thank not only for a permanent manned presence in space but also for the greatest hobby in the world, gaming.
That's a significant legacy and one which has culminated in the development of a game called Stable Orbit, a space station simulation title by Codalyn which gives you the chance to indulge in your gaming hobby and celebrate our space based ingenuity at the same time.
The first thing you should know is that at the time of writing Stable Orbit is in Early Access (and paradoxically not that stable) so you can expect a lot of missing features, a few bugs and the occasional crash, you can also expect some nausea but I'll get on to that later.


[b]Go Your Own Way[/b]

So Stable orbit gives you the opportunity to construct your very own space station.
As it stands at the moment, you start the game with a core module already orbiting the earth.
This provides a limited amount of power, cooling and communication capabilities.
There's also just enough life support to accommodate one brave astronaut.

From these humble beginnings you're tasked with constructing a station to surpass the ISS itself.
You're going to need a source of income to fund your construction ambitions, building a lab module is a good place to start as at the moment this is the only way to generate money (although this will likely change as development progresses).

You're going to need some extra power to keep things ticking over so putting up a solar array might be a good idea, maybe you could build  living quarters too, it'd be good for your solo astronaut to have a friend up there.
Of course you'll also need to construct a shuttle dock so your intrepid new astronaut can board the station, the dock is also important as it allows your station to receive vital supplies from Earth.

Your astronauts have developed an addiction to luxuries like food and water so it's a good idea to fit a ""space door"" to accept the online grocery orders, after all a dead astronaut isn't great for productivity.


[b]Seasons in the Sun[/b]

The next problem you've got is that whilst the solar panels are providing electricity to keep the lights on, they only work in sunlight, which isn't much use when you're on the dark side of the Earth and actually need to ""turn the lights on"" so it might be wise to attach some batteries to help keep things powered when you're orbiting through the shadows.

So now you've got a lab making you money and a living quarters for well... living in, everything is powered and your astronauts are fed, watered and oxygenated but it's still far from an orbital paradise.

Your technological tin can will get pretty hot with all that machinery running and unfiltered sunlight blazing on to its surface, you're going to need to build a radiator or two to regulate the temperature before you cook your cosmonauts.


[b]Wuthering Heights[/b]

A few button clicks and a short while later you'll have a Station happily circling the Earth without the need for further input from yourself.

You can click on a module and order some repairs if anything has gotten damaged, you could expand further, build another lab, a larger solar array, a bigger living quarters etc.
Bigger is always better and you can definitely build an impressively large station by repeating basic module construction over and over but therein lies the problem of playing through an early access title like this.

The current lack of content means that things are going to get stale pretty quickly and once you've built a station or two there isn't much left to do apart from admire your handy work in all its glinting metallic glory.

Watching your station orbit around the earth is fun for a while and a game of ""find your house from orbit"" will entertain for a few minutes more but you'll soon get sick of that and as I mentioned early, you might also get sick in the physical sense too. 


[b]Killing Me Softly[/b]

Whilst this ""space sickness"" might add a little something to the immersion it's an additional level or realism I could definitely do without.
The nausea is caused by the rapidly rotating Earth constantly spinning like a crazed merry-go-round beneath your shiny new space station.

The game currently has 3 speed settings, Too Fast, Way Too Fast and Vomit Now.

From a design point of view there's no denying that you need the ability to fast forward time speeding up the construction of modules etc, but you should also be able to slow things down and catch your breath.

Taking a few minutes to enjoy looking at your creation is part of the fun with this sort of game but with your station hurtling around the world at what feels like light speed, taking in the view can be an eye watering experience.
Stable Orbit desperately needs a ""real time"" setting so we can enjoy the view without the need for a sick bag.


[b]Another Brick In The Wall[/b]

I do hope there will be more features in future, obviously some items are locked, so I'm sure they will eventually be available. What would be great is a comfortable management section, so see at a glance if something is damaged, maybe assign repair crews, maybe instead of eject, allow modules to be moved etc. Maybe also an option to control what the scientists are studying , that ability to align the station with thrusters etc., just all the things that are do-able.

While I agree, there isn't that much to do, I enjoyed what I could do and I certainly will give future updates a try.

The graphics are nice, controls are OK for now, what is missing is some ambiance. Maybe music, maybe some radio chatter between the station and ground control, especially when shuttles come and go. This game has great potential, and as I don't need action or shooting things to enjoy a game, I hope it retains a certain level of simulation and concentrates on science and management!

It is not currently worth the price being asked. I received this (I think for free) through GreenManGaming. 

I strongly suggest waiting for a more developed version.

11/11/16
The game had an update today, gave it a very brief look. I think I can see where the creator is trying to end up with the game. Once an introduction, better tooltips and mouse controls are added for new players I may give the game a qualified recommendation.

So Stable Orbit has had its second update to Vector.
We got new models and new cabins for connecting livable units and various bug fixes.
We also got new settings for older machines(Hurray!)
The game is now to me playable with solid machanics and can now run on my older pc with decent frames instead of the 20 i was getting.

While the game is still lacking in content it is really showing promise at this time and i hope the developer keeps supporting his product.

I can now give it a thumbs up as it is in a state of where i think the starting line should be for an early access game.

Good Job, Codalyn and keep up the good work.

====================================================================
Electrolysis Update:
Stable Orbit has seen the first update for the game and so far it is coming along nicely.
Added was:
Better management UI
Food, Water, and Oxygen Storage and management.
Oxygen extractors
Slow Orbit of earth down to a total of 90mins to do a full rotation.(fixed some motion sickness for me.)

Overall the game is going in a good direction for it.

Still i cannot recommend the game at this time due to preformance issues along with a lack of features but it still continues to impress and i hope for the continued support of the developer.

Buy this if you want to support the developer but if you are looking for a full feature game Stable Orbit isnt the game for you at the moment.

To the developer i say keep up the good work, you will get there and keep us informed as that is your best PR.

==============
Original Review:
==============
Stable Orbit is a Space Sim about building a space station after the ISS has been decommissioned. Currently the game is in Very early access so Items are limited but it is in a playable state.

Pros:
Space Sim(need more of these)
Management
Very Mellow

Cons:
Can cause motion sickness for some people if you look at earth too long.
Not Very realistic as it doesnt pass over standard launch sites on earth.
Very little customization.
Lack of information boxes when selecting items to build (so not much you can know when trying to build)
Management bar at the bottom is lacking more detailed information
Lack of a moon
Station is hard to see when it is in the Dark(would make it so you can see the station just make it low light or that station sections light up as you hover over)
Lack of seeing a modern shuttle instead of a 1960s shuttle.
Lack of settings to adjust quality on stuff for older PCs not using a GTX980+

What i would like to see:
More Options in modules like a garden/bio, Science is nice, Observation, Water recylers, Air scrubbers.
Less wireframe options as it doesnt fit with most extensions to a station but would be ok with it if you have an upgrade option.
Hotkey to disable health options on all modules as seeing green health bars all the time is annoying.
Better movement as i cannot get to some modules as they do not center when i click on them.
Zoom feature.
Slower planet rotation(even if it breaks reality(Would solve the motion sickness and other issues with hardware requirements))


Summary:
Stable Orbit is a diffrent but similar game with alot of potentala and while its doing itself good and i dont see any crashes there is a lack of missions or goals to complete.
My Recommendation to the developer is to focus on the station at the moment and fix and impliment some changes and get some goals in place for people to work twords. Then focus on other things like earth and weather for additional effects. As station building is the goal you want to enable people to work on that and to make what they want.

At this time i cannot Give it a recommendation because a various lack of features but it is something i would keep an eye on.

For others if you want to just do some basic station building this game can do it.
