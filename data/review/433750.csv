Le point fort de ce jeu est son histoire étrange, surréaliste, qui au fil de son déroulement fait naître en nous ces sentiments à la fois de curiosité, de dégoût, de tristesse et d'empathie. Les images dessinées à la main viennent illustrer et intensifier ces sensations.

J'ai été mitigée par les créations de ce développeur mais de mon avis personnel ""The gandfather"" est la meilleure des trois. Celui-ci ne dure certes pas très longtemps mais il est amplement suffisant pour nous dépeindre et décrire l'essentiel tout en sachant retenir notre attention.
Les énigmes (si l'on peut vraiment nommer cela comme ça) sont simples et intuitives mis à par la toute première qui vous posera peut être problème (une fois compris les mécaniques le reste suit sont cours très aisément).

Au niveau de l'histoire (je vais essayer de rester la plus brève possible pour ne pas spoiler car je me répète c'est très court et la description ainsi que le trailer nous en révèlent déjà une grande partie), nous suivons l'histoire d'un papy tourmenté, le mot est peut être faible, ce petit vieillard tout rabougris nous ferais même pitié, tellement il traîne sa misère et son mal d'amour face à une épouse acariâtre au coeur de pierre.
Les scènes sont gores et sanguinolentes (j'adore ça à condition qu'une histoire vienne y apporter un sens et c'est le cas ici), les nuits se suivent et se répètent jusqu'à en arriver au dénouement final.

La notion de point and clic est bien présente mais ne vous attendez pas à de moult combinaisons d'objets, maintes allers/retours, entrecoupés de puzzles tordus ou emprunts de logique ou de mathématiques, ni à des discussions à choix multiples, ici on va à l'essentiel, c'est simple, efficace, court et rapide.

Le seul et plus gros problème de ce jeu est qu'il ne permet pas son accessibilité à tout le monde, en effet celui-ci n'a pas été traduit. 
Un jeu en langage universel (Anglais) permet plus ou moins de comprendre du moment où l'on ai appris les bases à l'école, mais ici il n'y a aucun sous-titrage, aucun écrit, toutes les paroles sont orales et doublées par une actrice mais cette voix est plutôt faiblarde et donc difficile à comprendre.

Pour ma part, c'est en faisant des pauses régulières après chaque scène de langage, et en alternant avec une vidéo youtube aux sous-titres activés, que je suis parvenue à comprendre l'histoire.

Donc il vous faudra disposer d'une très bonne maîtrise de l'anglais oral pour comprendre les tenants et aboutissants de l'histoire, ce qui est bien regrettable.

""The Grandfather"" ist ein kleines, kostenloses und sehr stimmungsreiches Point-and-Click Adventure.

Dabei geht es weniger um das sehr rudimentäre Gameplay als vielmehr um die dunkel-depressive Geschichte, in der es um die Einsamkeit eines alten Mannes geht. Und diese Geschichte ist zwar sehr kurz, aber auch richtig gut.

Der gezeichnete Grafikstil ist bestechend kraftvoll und sehr passend zum Thema. Künstlerisch trifft der Titel ins Schwarze. Gekonnt führt uns Grafik und ächzender Sound in die Welt der Depressionen ein. Die fast wispernde Erzählstimme fungiert nicht nur als Inhaltsvermittler, sondern auch als irritierender Teppich. Man erschrickt vor der emotionalen Tiefe, die hier visualisiert wird.


Spielmechanisch ist das kurze Programm nicht wirklich der Rede wert. Im Kern ist es viel eher ein gezeichneter Kurzfilm, der durch etwas kryptische und umständliche Click-Passagen unterbrochen wird. Aber um das Gameplay geht es auch nicht. Vielmehr ist das Programm künstlerisch hochwertig und spannend und zudem noch sehr emotional.

Story:

You play as an Old Man. You live with your wife, who is a cold and bitter person, that never loved you and the story follows on her coldness towards her husband. 

That is the basic gist of the story and it basically follows on the Old Mans feelings and how he deals with the situation. It's definitely some messed up stuff and honestly it was pretty depressing to play, but overall the story was pretty interesting and definitely was worth going through all of it.

Graphics:

Most of the game is hand drawn and I liked the art style, even though it's very rough. Some of it seven gross to look at, especially the main characters. I liked the hand drawn art style a lot, but I felt it suffered in places, especially the environments, which weren't that good, they look much lower quality than the characters.

Audio:

The audio design is flat out the worst part of the game. The voice actor that narrates everything, her acting is decent, but the mixing makes it sound super quiet, where most of the time you can barely understand what she is saying, not to mention everything else is incredibly loud.

The music is not very good and the sound effects mix into are just an awful experience. There's a lot of echoing whenever something happens and it's just attack on the ears. 

Gameplay:

The gameplay is going to be really hard to explain. Basically you control the head of the old man and you fly around in a room of the house and you basically try to mess around with the items in those rooms to progress into another room.

The gameplay is not very good, for multiple reasons, first of all it's really cryptic on what you have to do. I had plenty of times where I had no idea what I was doing, all I did was flying around, interacting with items and just hoping I was going to progress. 

Controlling the head is also not easy, as it feels incredibly slippery. It just sort of slides out of place and it becomes annoying when you're trying to interact with something specific. 

Verdict:

The Grandfather used to be a paid game and if this was still the case, I would have given this a negative review, however since it's free, I think it's worth it for horror fans, since it only takes roughly 20 minutes to finish, only worth it if you're a horror fan.

Final Rating:
6/10

Pros:
+ Decent plot
+ Art style is pretty decent

Cons:
- The audio design is terrible
- Goals of each level are pretty cryptic 
- Controls are way too slippery

The puzzles, in my opinion, were complicated, but not in the good way. Complicated in the way that makes you want to throw your controller or computer across the room once you figure the puzzle out.

Spoiler Alert - At the end of the game, I did not feel a sense of accomplishment. I just felt sad/bad for the character that we played as...and even more confused than when I first started the game. Oh, and did I mention, that I felt unpleasant?

The Grandfather is a point and click puzzle game with a strong narrative focus. Story wise, the game is pretty weak and cliche. It often feels like the writer was trying to make the plot as dark and edgy as possible and wound up overdoing it. Graphically, the game is extremely hit or miss. There are a few different art styles that don't clash, but also don't really fit together. The art ranges from MS Paint quality to professional grade graphics. The gameplay is basic and poorly executed, resulting in boring puzzles that are occasionally far too difficult. Overall, the game falters every step of the way and isn't fun to play at all.

安い洋ゲーにありがちな直球のグロさがあり、サイケなSEもあいまって病的ホラーな雰囲気のゲームです。
出来はさておいて雰囲気だけで言えばゆめにっきやLSDを過激で直接的にすればこうなるかな、って感じです。

何がフラグになっているか分からなくて反応するものをポチポチしてたらいつの間にか先に進んでるタイプのゲームです。いや、進めていけばちょっとずつ何をどうすればいいかは分かってきますが…。

It's a truly miserable art piece that would be best experienced on a dark rainy night at 3am, that time your mind starts to drift into that inbetween sleep and awake limbo.

I am not sure I would recommend it if it cost money, unless it was a very reasonable price.

+Surreal sound design with ambience and nightmarish psychedelic sound effects 
+It's free

-Felt the voice acting took me out of it, would be enough just text for the story scenes imo

However, neither of these points really ""saves"" the game.

While the game's coding has some noticeable problems, the biggest flaw overall is the structure. The game is horribly repetitive: there's a bit of storytelling, a zoom into the house, a small tunnel leading up to one of the grandfather's body parts, a simple puzzle, and...repeat. Everything besides the storytelling and the puzzles just pad out the game's length, and the puzzles are easy and have nothing to do with the story. Overall, the game is lacking in substance.

Well, to call it avant-garde would be one way to describe it, but an equally as accurate description would be to imagine your worst possible trip if you were to take both mushrooms and acid simultaneously. This is a game that's best enjoyed under the influence of a few bong rips (if that is legal in your area, of course), since it'll be fairly boring if experienced sober. There's supposed to be room for story interpretation and all that artsy fartsy stuff, but when it comes right down to it this 25-minute psychedelic trip is just plain weird.

The fact that The Grandfather is based on a true story is pretty sad; thinking that anyone could go decades with an ungrateful and unloving partner, only to die sad and unloved at the end of a long lifetime is one of the most miserable thoughts anyone could have. The gameplay reflects these feelings, as it too is both miserable and sad, being comprised of endlessly spam-clicking until something happens; or until you're able to figure out what it is that you're supposed to be doing. On the upside, the hand drawn art is awesome and the amount of blood in this game is acceptable. It's free, but that doesn't mean it's good; if you have half an hour to spare, give it a whirl.

Жил был дедушка, которого не любила бабушка. И мало того что она его не любила, так еще и холодно к нему относилась, гнобила, и видимо орала на него, когда он еще не был дедушкой, и приносил домой мало денег с работы. И вот таким вот жалким и подавленным был наш дедушка, пока однажды, очередное издевательство бабушки не заставило его, изменить все это, самым кардинальным образом. Впрочем издевательство было тоже кардинальное.

Сюжет полнейшая психоделия - мы управляем дедушкой, пытающимся собрать себя заново (во всех смыслах), дабы избавиться наконец от своих мучений.

Что картинка, что геймплей, полнейшая наркомания. Арты, это просто что-то с чем-то. Музыка соответствует атмосфере.

В остальном нас ждут странные пазлы, расчлененка, д@рьмо (много д@рьма), пуповины, страх и ненависть, и много прочих глюков.

Как итог: как игра оно такое себе, как апофеоз наркомании и психоделики, самое то, когда у вас закончились волшебные грибы. Палец вверх за атмосферу и психоделичность, в остальном, очень уж на любителя. Вот и все. Ну а я пожалуй, пойду сварю еще этих грибочков.

I've honestly been debating whether I should redeem that key I had to [i]The Grandfather[/i] for over a year now...but it seems the developer made my decision super easy by making his games free as of July 2018 (whether this is permanent or temporary, I have no idea).  It's a short game that's about 20-30 minutes long, but is it worth your time?

[i]The Grandfather[/i] is a game about a lonely grandfather who has suffered from neglect from his wife for several years and ended up waking up as a floating head roaming his house, eliminating all sources of light while he finds his missing body parts and ultimately finding his freedom...which makes me wonder how it's based on a true story if it's about a floating disembodied head...was the developer personally familiar with floating heads in his grandfather's home?  And why didn't the grandfather just get a divorce if he was so miserable?

The puzzle aspects of [i]The Grandfather[/i] are fairly simple when you realize the goal is to eliminate all sources of light.  The difficulty is low, but I did end up looking up a walkthrough for the toilet (we all get stuck on the toilet, you know?).  This game's accompanied by surreal imagery that's often described as creepy, but it's not scary (scary being the one reason I've avoided this game for so long).  When picking up body parts, you're in a first person perspective in a 3D Unity-based tunnel...but the rest of the game has a more 2D perspective.

What I didn't like about this game?  Too many things.  The obnoxious music/sounds, the unskippable cutscenes (if you can call them that since they just zoom in on a house or just have you sit there and stare at a still image), and the fact that there are two jumpscares (the heart in stage 1 under the washing machine and the giant grandmother's face when she's nearly defeated).  Puzzles often ranged from super easy to ""What am I even supposed to do?!""...no middle ground, just those two extremes.  If I had anything nice to say about [i]The Grandfather[/i], it would be that I can appreciate the art that went into the making of this game, but sadly, this game forces itself down your throat.

So, do I recommend [i]The Grandfather[/i]?  Sadly, no...and it's not because of its status as a horror game.  It just simply wasn't all that good of a game in my opinion.  Sure, the story was nice, but with the wait times, the 2 jumpscares, and the puzzles ranging from pointlessly easy to super cryptic (that toilet...it was the only major cryptic part...there was another in the kitchen, but it's doable without a guide).  As I stated earlier, this game became free as of July 2018 and I have no idea if it's temporary or permanent.  Either way, I'd say to avoid this game unless you're looking for some quick entertainment.  Just be warned, you will be weirded out.

I like this game, the art, the story. It's gripping and emotional. In one word, beutiful. 
I think there has been a huge improvment in the way the story is beeing told from The Lady. There is narrative but the story isen't force fed down your throat. It gives you enough to comprehend the overarching story but leavs enough room for thought. 

However this is far from perfect, i felt like wen i was figuring out the puzzles it kinda happend by random. I force kicked my way through most of them, the only once i figured out were tv room and kitchen. In short i wanted more ""game"" from it, abit clearer on what the goal of the puzzle is as there is more enjoyment in figuring it out then. (Atleast for me).
The length of the game is also quite short, I finished it in about 20 minutes.

It also misses some key components which i hope will be adressed in future games, like a propper options menu with sound levels for the background sounds and the narrator. Some subtitles would also be nice. 

All in all for the price, id say this game is worth your time if your a fan of deeper story. But if your here strictly for the puzzles, id pass.

To me art is simply human expression, which leaves the door open for just about anything to qualify for interpretation and criticism. That's not to say I'm going to be kind to a blank canvas with a dot on it or fifteen minutes of metal scraping; I acknowledge these works as art but I judge them to be poor examples of it. And that brings us to The Grandfather, a game desperately trying to be art while failing to provide the most essential element, a message worth gleaning.

The moment you start the game, you a treated to a drawing of a sad, naked old man on a toilet while an angry old lady head is yelling at him. A low-fi narrator explains that he is a very sad old man because his wife is mean to him. From here the game proceeds into a loop of several scenes, including a slow zoom into the top window of the house, a first-person march down a rough tunnel, and a scene somewhere within the house where you control the old man's floating head. This sequence repeats four or five times, revealing more of what story there is with each cycle.

There are only two parts of the game where you have any input on what happens. One is in the tunnel, where you navigate with first-person controls. All you can do is walk straight ahead, though. You can't turn more than 90 degrees either direction and the tunnel has no branches or paths other than forward. At the end you find some gruesome piece of viscera which takes you to the other playable part, a room in the house. Here you maneuver the old man's head around like the cursor in a point-and-click adventure, clicking on things and sometimes clicking and holding to pick them up.

This is the most significant part of The Grandfather from a gameplay perspective, so it is essential for you to understand that what passes for puzzles here are both completely linear and completely nonsensical. For example, in the bathroom scene you have to click on the sink, toilet, and bathtub to make them overflow. This fills the room halfway up with water. Then you grab the floating plunger and touch it to the drain at the bottom of the room. This makes the water drain out, and then more water explodes from the drain like a geyser. That's it. That's how you solve the bathroom puzzle.

Is there any indication this is what you're supposed to do? No. Is there any clue or mention in the cutscenes of these washroom shenanigans? Nope. Does flooding the bathroom tie into the story or symbolism in any way? Not as I see it. There's a rough disconnect between what you do in the tunnel and rooms and what happens in the story, rough enough that I can't even come up with charitable interpretations of your actions as a player that reflect on the tale of neglect and violence peddled around them. I honestly don't see much of a story here at all. There are things that happen that COULD have implications about aging relationships and depression, but they're never expanded or explained in any meaningful way, leaving barely enough to scrape together for a 101-level essay on symbolism.

It's a sorry waste of a skin-crawling aesthetic to be sure, but too much of it relies on gore and disgust for my tastes. I'm reminded of the more depraved animated shorts MTV used to run in their early animation days, the ones that felt like portals into the diseased psyches of madmen. The problem is that here, there's no neurosis to diagnose or combat. The Grandfather is very conspicuously a hollow shell, a gruesome wrapper that someone forgot to fill with the promised nightmare. Clocking in at less than 30 minutes, you're welcome to see for yourself if edgy, experimental titles are your jam but I can't say it'll be 30 minutes well-spent.

So maybe that’s why the reviews are 50/50 as they stand right now.

I was a little sceptical going into this as the reviews aren’t the best but I thought I’d try it despite that fact as I quite like other games David Szymanski has worked on and I’m quite open to odd games. 

Honestly, in my opinion it’s not as bad as the current “overall” score might have you assume. It’s much more an art piece and an expression than it is a game but I enjoyed the overall feel to it. It lasts 40 minutes (probably a lot less for you if you don’t get stuck for a while like I did) and although it’s not very long, it’s free. For what it is and what it’s intended to be I don’t think you can really complain too much over a free game.

The “puzzles” are a little bizarre but I personally found that playing around for a bit you’d figure out what it was you were going for. A few of the reviews I read prior to playing this saw that as a bit of a problem but I didn’t mind it.

It’s a well-made oddity, the art is quite nice and in terms of quality I think it does well in bringing forward the right kind of mood. It’s creepy and weird and you’re not really sure what’s going on most of the time, but I took that as an intentional thing in light of the character, his mental state and what’s going on.

I think a lot went into this emotionally, but it’s not something you would label as your every day “game”. Try it if you’re interested in things that are a little bit different. If you’re looking for a long, story driven adventure game or something this isn’t really the place for it.

It’s weird, but I think I like it.


TL;DR : It’s a short 40 minute arty game worth your time if you don’t mind things that are a bit different and bizarre. It’s cheap and the quality is pretty good, but it is rather weird.

如果说《幻女》试图展示的是一个抽象化的地狱，那么《苦爷》则尝试表现一个具象化的地狱。游戏的画面较之《幻女》更精致了些，难度和游戏时数则有所下降，剧情也相对更好理解。
如果说《幻女》是深入梦境底层见识到的恐惧，那么《苦爷》则是半梦半醒间一次压抑的妄想。
所谓画鬼容易画虎难，抽象地狱更方便天马行空地表现，同时也给人更多的阐释空间。而具象地狱的容量则十分有限，归根结底，地狱即他人。
所以说《苦爷》不能说是一款进步之作，只能说是在前作基础上朝另一个方向的小小尝试。顺便一提，《幻女》的主角在本作中也有客串。
整体来说这是一款非常简单，着重于表达情绪而有意无意忽视游戏性的游戏。一定要做比喻的话，类似一些不太讨好的地下音乐、电影或诗歌。当然，这类作品在“独立性”上，做得更极端也更纯粹一些。
如果你是前作《幻女》的粉丝，那么本作尝试一下也无妨。如果你对猎奇或艺术向游戏有些兴趣，那么买下来玩玩也可以。13块钱支持一个拒绝向市场和消费者妥协的独立游戏人，大约和在街头为唱自己歌的流浪乐手投上一两枚钢镚一样——于事无补，却有情调。

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I bought this but the creepy art was enough to make me curious about it. It's a very short experience, you'll be spending 20 minutes at most, probably less, since the game's main gameplay element is a series of simple puzzles which you simply need to click on various thing to figure out. There is no context and no explanation to help you with these puzzles, but they're easy enough to figure out, it's pretty much impossible to put a puzzle in an unwinnable state.

The story is rather creepy, which is really the game's best quality. The art, the mood, the plot, all this has been put together in a bag of gore and darkness to make the player slightly uneasy with eerie sounds and dark, dirty-looking rooms inside a big, creepy house where a sad man suffers from his cold wife's constant torments. The plot, well, it's nothing much, it's a very short story, the Grandfather's sadness is explained as you progress through the puzzles, there's not much development but it's surreal and dark.

Of course, with an artsy 2$ game there is bound to be some flaws, for one, its length. This is a 20-minute experience at most, the puzzles are pretty easy to figure out and don't require much thinking, only some clicking and dragging random objects until the screen goes dark and the narration continues. The narration, not bad in itself, is unfortunately muffled and hard to hear and there are no subtitles, you'll have to really pay attention to understand what is going on. The gameplay is very simple but before each puzzle there is a boring, unnecessary walking segment that only serves to pad the game between puzzles and narrative sequences. The Grandfather also have zero replay value, unless you want to show it to a friend, there's absolutely no change in the story, it's the same experience over and over again.

Now, would I recommend The Grandfather? This is a time I wish there was a ""Maybe"" option on Steam, because I don't fully recommend it but I also don't think it should be completely be dismissed as a low-budget, low-ambition indie game with next to no appeal. The art is good, the narrative is interestingly creepy and it's a pretty casual puzzle game which doesn't require much effort to play through but it's also short and has low replayability.

   The Grandfather is a very short (less than 30 mins), story-driven puzzle game.  It's a dark tale about The Grandfather and his wife (thats all Ill say about that to avoid spoilers).
   The game boils down to basically, a short voice segment telling parts of the story, followed by a short walking segment thats just strictly walking forward, followed by a short point-and-click puzzle.  Rinse and repeat 5 or 6 times and that's the entirety of ""The Grandfather"".

PROs
   - It's short and cheap, the game is perfect if you want to go through a random game completely, but dont have a lot of time to spare.
   - The artwork is nice, some twisted and mildly grotesque drawings.
   - The puzzle's are very obtuse, but simple enough that it's not too frustrating (the puzzles will be under CONs too)
   - The story is interesting enough for you to want to see through to the end.
   - The overall game has a creepy ambience which I am a fan of.

CONs
   - The sound quality and the reading of the voice-over is pretty bad.  It sounds muffled and the ladies voice doesn't have the needed eeriness or conviction to the mood of the story.  It heavily detracts from a decent, creepy story.
   - The segments where you walk forward before every puzzle is a complete waste of time and if taken away would turn this game into a 10 minute game at most.
   - The puzzles are just a point-and-click-and-see-what-happens-next situation.  Only a few times I had to think a little bit about what I should do next.
   - No replayability at all.  Once you finish it, then you'll probably never pick it up again, unless you want to show someone else the game.",1472445575,1472445800,True,0,0,0.497131913900375366,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It was incredibly short, and the content was dubious (which I will get to in a moment.) enough to give me pause. However at just under a dollar, the fact that it has a beginning, middle and end with gameplay in between makes it at least worth the price of admission.   

 I appreciate what the developer of this game was trying to do, and I appreciate oblique, surreal or mysterious storytelling. A peice of work just needs to have a solid sense of itself, and steady direction to not have it be an unrelatable mess. This game does not have a solid sense of itself. It wears it's Lynchian influences embarrassingly on it's sleeve without realizing that what makes his movies so good is that the symbolism, while impenetrable, is consistent and resonant. It never got around to developing it's own set of symbols for the player to relate to (The umbilical cord was a literal umbilical cord, for goodness sake.). The story is a straight line from start to finish, with no conflict to speak of. Even the antagonist is revealed to be such through a series of flashbacks which do not relate to the surreal gameplay, which one can assume is the ""present"" in the narrative timeline. 

 The gameplay is shitty puzzles. They're meant to be non-logical puzzles, I realize, but that makes them shitty puzzles.

That's all the smack I'll talk about this game. Those are my personal opinions on the game's story, but I'd still say it's worth the dollar I paid for it.

Background images subtly shake out of sync with foreground images, leaving you feeling queasy.  Puzzles include no context or clear goals whatsoever, leaving you disoriented.  The game opens with the most difficult puzzle, which adds an element of frustration on top of that.

The Grandfather is just a strange a ride as the screenshots suggest, so know that going into it. Be prepared for some elements to not make sense or even feel random. Also be prepared for an interesting exploration of ideas and a fairly strong story, though, which helps balance out the sheer weirdness of the imagery/gameplay.

Visually, the game is amazing. The audio ties the strangeness together with almost alien sound effects. Initially, the voice over was too quiet, but apparently that issue has been addressed already, so good to see the devs responding quickly and positively to relevant feedback without compromising anything vital to the game's creativity.

The game play is fairly straightforward puzzle solving, but the puzzles are not always logical and the game does not hold players' hands at all. I found myself clicking on random things in random order to progress at least once, which was the only time I became frustrated.

The game lasts about half and hour or so, and the conclusion to the story is satisfying. This game probably won't blow your mind, but it will take you to places that no other game can.

First of all, the narrators voice is way to low, she is almost barely audible the first time you hear her. I suggest getting this fixed. Let it be known that this was the only issue in the game, I did not encounter any other bugs or issues so it's definetly a stable and well made game.

The Grandfather is a wonderfully illustrated horror game that tells you about a sad miserable grandfather who has never been loved by anyone, including his wife who enjoys torturing him emotionally by giving him the scariest version of the stink eye ever. 

One night after going to sleep in his bed, separated from his wife's (wow that woman is a total bitch), he wakes up, none of his body parts present OR attatched to his body! Only his head, which also can float, he begins his venture to find his body parts, what he ends up with though, is better than what a paint brush could ever do.

The puzzles in The Grandfather were, honestly, not very difficult. Maybe I got stuck two times trough the whole game, the puzzles felt sort of meaningless as I just clicked at things, but they were fun to figure out when figuring out was needed.

The game was made in Unity 5 (which I highly suggest to any devs who are starting out, for real, get it, it's free) which most people enjoy shitting at, however thanks to games like Firewatch, The Forest and the development hell beaut' Raindrop it's slowly getting a better reputation after it got slaughtered by the billions of Slender clones.

The Grandfather though, it's weird, it has this ugly yet pretty, cool looking style that gets accompanied by some nicely done lighting. It also has these short segments that are first person where you walk forward, these are also very nice. The illustrations of The Grandfather are done by the talented SaintYak, the art is very well done and characters have a nice artstyle going on, objects in puzzles look sort of sketch'y like if they were drawn quickly, really adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game.

There isn't really any music in The Grandfather, if there is then it's some sort of saw being played on, it's very weird and sounds kind of creepy... Or funny. Other than that there is omnious ambient noise going off most of the time, which works and fits the rooms you solve puzzles in. Whatever is there of soundwork is interesting and adds to The Grandfather's already creepy atmosphere.

All in all, I pretty much enjoyed The Grandfather, it was way cheaper than I expected it to be and it totally came out of nowhere as I forgot it's release date, I hope it does well and that more people will try out this little enjoyable, creepy game. 

I give The Grandfather a 8/10",1462304503,1462304554,True,28,6,0.652591347694396973,1,True,False,False,False,,,
