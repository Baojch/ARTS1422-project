I'm a bit of a space junkie and, as a result, I really wanted to like this experience. 

Star Chart has some pretty cool features: 

Being able to point at a celestial body with a lazar sight and have the planet/star immediately appear in the palm of your hand is definitely a plus, this also allows you to use the touch pad to garner some pretty interesting information about the these heavenly bodies,.

The planet touch pad dial allows you to quickly find the planet your interested in and one click launches you towards it. (at what I can only assume is close to the speed of light) 

The Greek art overlaying the constellations is ever present and pretty fun.  

Unfortunately I ended up returning it, I don't think there is enough unique features to make me want to load up Star Chart over Universe Sand Box 2 or to a lesser extent the Solar System simulation provided in TheLab.

Star Chart is definitely the most educational of the 3 games I've mentioned but there isn't enough here to make me want to show it off to someone who came over to check out my vive.",1473126364,1473126364,False,7,1,0.626666665077209473,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I’m a bit torn on this one. First off, the principle is great, and many of the visuals are indeed stunning. That being said, it does not really feel quite finished yet:

[list]
[*]As someone already mentioned, the sky is often too bright: there is some dust in space, but nothing near what is being simulated here. Coupled with the excessive use of lens flare effects, this makes me feel like I’m in an early JJ Abrams film, not floating in space. 
[*]The navigation system is clunky, with the pointer often catching objects behind the one you are actually trying to target. Needing to target every object twice as opposed to being given the option to fly, for instance, to Mars system or Mars directly is somewhat annoying. It should also be noted that not all bodies have textures, and even some that do will deteriorate into a wireframe once you get close. 
[*]More worrying is the fact that the Vive’s VR cage is not always functioning correctly. I would like to know when I am about to walk into my bookshelf please, that’s why the function exists after all. Sporadically losing the cage forced me to repeatedly open the Vive menu to locate my lighthouses in order to know where I am in my room.
[/list]

If those issues are fixed, I would wholeheartedly recommend the software, but in its current state I would recommend it only to those who have a certain level of tolerance for a somewhat unfinished product. Personally I am still going to – cautiously – enjoy it.

2) No representation of ""ground""-- it shows the sky in 2 halves of the celestial sphere-- with NO OPTION of blocking out the ""lower half"" which you cannot see
3) The night sky is so damn BRIGHT!! No immersion of being in a field viewing a starry sky on a dark dark night
4) No option for setting location or of setting time or of actually showing the night sky move as time passes

I suggest the devs go see ""Stellarium"" for PC-- and convert some of that apps feature to VR in Star Chart. Maybe it will be worth for me to re-buy it by then.
