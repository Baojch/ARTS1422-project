This has the same gameplay (more or less) as their action unleashed U title, but either I don't remember that game correctly, or Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies is just about worse in every way.

The gameplay is pretty basic for an action game. There isn't much variety in terms of the main combos, but each character has a plethora of special attacks taken from the main Hyperdimension games. Though the weaker ones don't have any indication of when you can use them or not. 
It took me three quarters into the game to figure out how to use items, and you have to use them in real time, which makes it pretty tough, since you're typically surrounded by enemies. 

 Pretty much every time you attack leaves you wide open, and there is no invincibility after being hit, so enemies can rack up hits on you pretty easily, and you die very quickly to boot.

That being said, the game isn't that hard. In fact, for the most part, it's pretty dang easy. I probably only failed missions four times on some tougher bosses that take a billion hits to kill.

My biggest problem with the game is how clunky it is to upgrade stats. It takes so many clicks or button presses and a bit of guesswork to upgrade your characters. I don't know who designed it that way, but shame on them.

You can fuse items. The game never explains what that does, and I never tried it, so have at it!

In conclusion, the game isn't good, but it isn't bad. It's ultimate saving grace is the story is 4-5 hours long. It's a goofy, not-so-good story, but whatever. There's other things to do outside of the campaign, so if you do enjoy the game, you can play some co-op or whatever.

I think the story of this game is a bit difficult to understand. It started with a group of girls who wanted to make a film about zombies. Directed by Blanc (White Heart), I think it's okay, but what's strange is when they want to make a zombie film but players are told to kill real zombies. From start to finish the story makes a zombie film, but the gameplay actually kills zombies. until there is a sequel to the story to fight boss zombies. In my opinion, Tamsoft should improve its game in terms of story structure.


[h1] Graphic [/h1] (8/10)
The characters of this game are quite good and are covered with typical Neptunia graphics whose quality is beyond doubt. what I like is the boss character, which I think is good and cool. It would only be better if there were new characters added. Maybe because this isn't the main game, Tamsoft can't create new characters without Idea Factory's permission


[h1] Gameplay [/h1] (8/10)
The gameplay of this Tamsoft game carries an action RPG style that utilizes the evade and block functions. I especially like this kind of gameplay, because this kind of gameplay makes the game more challenging and difficult to finish. Moreover, if you add an open world theme to this game, it will definitely be even more challenging to finish.


[h1] Sound [/h1] (8/10)
I think the soundtrack of this game is good. The zombie theme matches the tone of the zombie songs in this game. So when we play the spin off game from Neptunia, it's not surprising that we will see a new soundtrack from the original one.

[h1] DLC [/h1] (7/10)
Because this is a spin off game, there isn't much DLC in this game, so I can't really comment much.

- Esse jogo consegue se propor a ter uma historinha boba e descontraída e mesmo assim criar a coisa mais desinteressante do mundo.
- As piadas, um dos pontos mais fortes da franquia Neptunia, aqui não tem nenhuma graça, são chatas e repetitivas.
- Outro ponto forte da franquia Neptunia são as músicas boas, aqui isso é inexistente.
- A gameplay é horrorosa, a câmera é dura e estranha, a personagem que você escolhe também tem uma movimentação toda dura e travada. Em suma, é uma gameplay tão fluida quanto a gameplay de Red Dead Red Redemption 2 porém sendo rodado em um PC da Positivo.
- O jogo é cheio de bugs nos mapas. Tem mapas que você vai precisar resetar mais de duas vezes porque uma vez que você tenha derrotado certa horda de inimigos, a próxima não vai aparecer mesmo que você ande por todo o cenário.
- A Blanc aqui não tem carisma algum. Todo mundo que já jogou algum game oficial de Neptunia, sabe que a Blanc é praticamente uma subversão do esteriótipo de personagem calma que lê livros e sempre tão zen, ela é o oposto disso, ela é boca suja, sarcástica e tem um pavio curto. Nesse jogo ela é só o esteriótipo mesmo, chega até a ser irônico que no jogo dedicado a ela, ela seja a personagem mais descaracterizada e que não solta um palavrão na história.
- O jogo é absurdamente repetitivo. Diferente do Action U, onde você tem uma certa variedade de inimigos e as missões tem um certo requisito de conclusão, nesse você só precisa matar as hordas constituídas pelos inimigos que você já derrotou outras 10.000 vezes e hora ou outra a missão acaba.

no se dejen llevar por el tiempo del juego vengo jugando este juego cuando la vita aun tenia vida 
primero que nada si vienes de jugar el NeptiniaU te vas a llevar una decepción 
comparando con su antecesor este es un paso a tras 
- los graficos, no tanto de los personajes, si no de los escenario se les nota un bajón en el diseño, no digo que el anterior tenia mejores gráficos pero los escenarios eran mas detallados  
-un ambiente gris y sin vida, ya se que quieren darle un toque películas de zombies pero los juegos de neptunia se destacan por ambientes coloridos aun en situaciones devastadoras 
-mapas grandes pero vacíos, en ocaciones te vaz a topar con mapas enormes lo malo que toda la accion solo ocurre en una esquina de estos por lo que lo demás queda inutilizable 
-la cantidad y variedad de enemigo fue reducida, el juego anterior destacaba por escenarios pequeños pero lo compensaba con la absurda cantidad de monstruos en la zonas que te daba ratos de diversión, aquí se queda corto la cantidad es tan diminuta que la acción pasa de un parpadeo y te da una sensación amarga que realmente no hiciste nada 
-nivel de dificultad, el juego anterior la dificultad estaba rota es decir la distribución de experiencia era absurda que los personajes podrían ser unas maquinas de matar por la exageradas subida de nivel que tenían, se nota que quisieron arreglar eso disminuyendo los punto de experiencia y aumentado el daño causado por los monstruos y en eso falla por que los personajes pueden ser igual de rotos que el juego anterior aun si no suben mucho de nivel   
-poco contenido a pesar del juego anterior que tenia variedad e quest aqui en la campaña principar ni a eso llega puede jugar los quiest principales y secundario aun así acabar la campaña muy rapido por lo que el tiempo en terminar este juego es muy corto 
-un multijugador pobre, si la campaña te resulto corta y quieres entrar al multi por mas contenido adivina que, tambien queda corto por los mismos problemas que sufría la campaña principal 
- un prota desechable, si querían que Blanc tuviera su propio juego como protagonista hubiesen inventado otra cosa, este juego se ve que fue hecho a prisas y sin ideas que no le hace justicia al personaje 
- falta de fanservice, si el juego anterior te gusto por el modo de romper la ropa pues esa idea la desecharon, no digo que lo debe de tener pero si tu buscabas contenido asi, pues aqui no lo vas a encontrar 

pasando los contras mencionare los pro del juego si aun te interesa adquirir este juego 
-variedad de nemigos en el multi, a pesar del corto contenido que también sufre la campaña puedes toparte con enemigos nuevos y únicos e incluso de entregas anteriores 
-mas waifus por jugar, si eres fan de la franquicia este juego tiene un aumento en el repertorio de personajes que le hacia falta en la entrega en su antecesor, no te va decepcionar 
- modo de personalización, si tu personaje se ve aburrido puedes personalizarlo como te gusta al conseguir accesorios que puedes usarlos a tu gusto comprándolos en la tienda del juego que obtienes con puntos al jugar los modos de juego 

puede que el juego tenga mas contras que pros, no es el peor pero tampoco es el mejor juego de la franquicia es otro mas de su muchas entregas solo para pasar el rato, si eres fans puede que te guste pero con un mal sabor de boca, si eres nuevo voltea otro lado que existen mejores musous que este juego",1669235009,1669235009,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Durante la grabación oyen la ""leyenda"" de una dimensión oscura que ha traído el apocalipsis a esta academia. El argumento intenta parodiar -sin éxito- los malos giros de guión y estereotipos de las películas de zombies de serie B y de la saga Resident Evil.

El juego se compone de dos modos de juego principales, que es el modo historia en el que se desarrolla a través de 12 capítulos, y un modo multijugador donde se desarrolla desafíos diarios o completar una serie de desafíos relativos a la leyenda negra de GamingIndustri. Por suerte, este último modo puede completarse en solitario sin muchos problemas debido a que no hay salas activas para jugar en modo cooperativo.

El modo de juego es un Action RPG en tiempo real, en el que destaca el uso de combos con un personaje asistente. Los controles son sencillos y los combates en general no dan ningún problema, dada la cantidad de experiencia recibida en torno al capítulo 6. Mi gran problema es que no es nada fácil fijar a un enemigo cuando estás rodeado, especialmente cuando quieres derrotar a un jefe y no preocuparte de los demás.  Tampoco ayuda la cámara, que tiende a bajar su altura en pleno combate, restando visión al juego: no es problema si se usa gamepads pero llega a ser una molestia si eres un jugador que le guste usar el teclado y, por desgracia, no tiene teclado numérico que son las definidas por defecto.

Los trofeos son relativamente sencillos y consisten en acabar el modo historia y compra de objetos, subir a un personaje al nivel máximo, alcanzar el nivel de amistad con otro personaje (aproximadamente diez combates) o realizar un largo combo. Sin embargo hay dostrofeos que pueden ser una verdadera molestia si te gusta conseguir el 100%.  En estos dos  tienes que coleccionar todas las partes de tesoros y todas las partes de los jefes finales del modo multijugador; son completamente al azar y puede salirte a la primera o después de veinte combates.

En cuanto a extras, destaca la galería donde puedes desbloquear ""tomas falsas"" del rodaje -no cambia nada, tan sólo se sustituyen unos personajes por otros - y las conversaciones en backstage entre los personajes. Todas ellas pueden conseguirse uniendo a dos personajes como principal y soporte en determinados capítulos. El juego te da las pistas suficientes para saber qué hacer.  También hay un modo trampa que desbloquea bonuses para la historia principal del juego, consistente en matar de un sólo golpe, vida y especial inifinto pero son completamente inútiles debido a que no hay motivos para usarlo si ya has completado el modo historia.

Para terminar, debería decir que me ha gustado el juego y es bastante recomendable para jugadores casuales. Por desgracia este spin-off ha perdido el sentido del humor que caracteriza la saga principal y puede sacarte una pequeña sonrisa si eres capaz de detectar algún homenaje en el diálogo.  Si eres un jugador exigente que espera un hack&slash difícil al estilo Dark Souls o cualquier RPG inspirado en Roguelikes, este no es tu tipo de juego que pudieras dedicarle tiempo.",1664228466,1664228466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

They make alot of improvements to Action Unleashed, but have an equal number of missteps that hurt the experience. In the end, I had fun and I’m giving this a reluctant thumbs up for people that both: “Like neptunia” and “Enjoy fast, dumb action”

The core gameplay, like AU, involves spawning into a map with hundreds of enemies and mashing them as hard as you mash the X button. There’s loads of special moves and button combinations, but none of them actually matter because the gameplay is as dumb as a certain lovable CPU. But I’ve put quite a few hours into both games because it DOES work.

The overall pacing is exponentially better than Action Unleashed. The story is told in a sequential set of levels and your characters grow near enough to the mission difficulties.  You earn a decent chunk of money to unlock weapons and items, Lily Ranks grow 1 per mission instead of 1 per 3, and there is story* EVERY mission. When I sit down to play, I enjoy the experience and there was never any doubt I’d finish this game.

*Story might be too strong a word. Silly pointless cutscenes would be more accurate.*

But the pacing on the missions themselves is downright awful. I’ll often run 3-5 minute cutscenes only to start a mission that ends in under a minute.  I found myself longing for Action Unleash’s defeat 300 enemy missions and hidden objectives. 

The moment-to-moment play is another area where it doesn’t quite excel. The increased speed of combat is nice and exciting, there’s loads of button combinations and the UI offers no hints to what they are. It’s equal parts overwhelming, and a constant reminder that the gameplay isn’t deep enough to need them.  

It’s worth mentioning that I had quite a bit of fun with the multiplayer levels even as a solo player and it almost feels like you were expected to switch between single player and MP for a smooth leveling curve through the story. I found it to be a good break from the pacing in the main game and definitely want to recommend this mode.

This game is not a must-play, it is not a deep meaningful RPG, and it’s neither a masterpiece of narrative nor gameplay. But it works well enough that I’d say give it a chance at a deep discount if this seems like your thing.",1663907881,1663907881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Unresponsive is because sometimes you can't use your EXE drive skills etc. (super moves).

~游戏支持故事模式和多人模式~

多人模式下支持多人协作打Boss！不过反正也没人一起了···
多人模式难度级别从一颗星到五颗星的任务好多，还有8个特别任务。
~多人模式难度比故事模式难好多好多~

因为刚玩过海王星U，所以这游戏虽然菜单什么的没汉化，但是操作基本类似，而且换装备都带预览了，不像海王星U预览都没有···

画面和海王星U差不多，可惜角色超小，场景超大！很多老游戏都是如此···
不过至少游戏每个cut下都会提示存档了！不像海王星U要是没手动存档突然闪退估计会哭/(ㄒoㄒ)/~~
画面和海王星U一样，阴影依旧是个灰圈···

[spoiler]~基本只要把所有角色点数用CE加满基本可以无敌游戏了~[/spoiler] 

因为除了剧情外其他内容都没汉化，所以剧情文本是中文，但游戏框上却是阴文~QAQ~
于是乎只好记录（虽然看角色也能认出来···）

剧情流水账：
[spoiler] 
布兰发现萝姆和兰姆在校园被丧尸袭击！于是去救援，结果发现她们在拍戏···
电影研究会妮普禔努打算拍电影吸引生源，布兰打算加入，不过要当导演和脚本！

妮普禔努作为社长开始介绍影研社团的成员，妮普禔努的妹妹妮普吉雅和萝姆、兰姆。
兰姆开始讨论脚本的时候，发现学园到处是DQN丧尸···布兰打算利用这些丧尸拍电影！妲(dá)姆莎芙觉得很有意思所以也入社。

于是开始演戏，学园被巨轮撞了，从巨轮上下来好多丧尸，开始打怪···主角们本打算和学生会长和副会长汇合，结果学生会长被掉下来的人造卫星砸死！副会长掉裂缝里了···

因为守护女神的缘故那些变成丧尸的学员也慢慢恢复正常了。

游汐学园学生会这，妮普禔努和布兰来找贝儿会长和诺瓦副会长借东西，可惜因为社团不是正式的，所以不允许···所以现在的目标是晋升为电影研究社。

电击新闻社社长电击子和电玩通新闻社的社长来采访了，和影研社一样是同好会，但自称新闻社···然后开始因为谁报道而吵起来了···
不过知晓情况的布兰让她们两都暂时加入到影研社。于是正式升级为社团。

继续演戏：主角们遇到了狗狗变成了丧尸犬后，布兰终于想起了自己是为了阻止这场危机而被派过来的某结社特务！之前之所以不记得是因为记忆被封印！

诺娃和优尼姐妹听到被丧尸攻击的人的惊叫后冲出去救援，并遇上布兰，然后支援演戏。

影片中，英雄们遇到诺娃扮演的老师和布兰扮演的英雄是同一个结社的成员，并得知原先病毒源头在某教室，但现在不见了，可能是被N财团抢先取走了！

拍摄过程中，诺娃还要来摄像机看效果，还想傲娇一下来帮忙！布兰还能看到诺娃自制的魔法少女偶像神奇诺瓦铃的影片！之前有个疑似学园女生在影片分享网站上捅娄子的视频正是这个，因为差评如潮，诺娃还忘记用户密码导致视频无法删除！！于是布兰趁机拉入影研社的支援队伍···还get了能坑诺娃的小办法！

果然没多久布兰就因为脚本没想好于是用小办法让诺娃帮忙···然后贝儿也被拉进来支援了。

影片里，英雄们逃离了学园又遇到了其他结社的成员，还遇到想让别人都变成丧尸的神秘少女···
一路找到财团的关联人员，结果对方二话不吭直接变成丧尸！

离交稿还有一周，结果最后一个场景的脚本还没写完！于是布兰想到了个好办法，高潮部分的脚本不写了，由演员们自由发挥！

影片中，杀出去的英雄们从结社那得知感染源从N财团转给了公社后又交给协会，接收人都变丧尸了！最后终于抢回来了···然后妮普禔努扮演的求救者干掉了结社的其他人···和布兰扮演的结社成员完成各自的任务逃离丧尸的包围！

虽然诺娃有点不清楚电影演的是啥···不管怎么说都拍完了！

漫长剪辑工作中，妮普吉雅和优尼的百合气息被布兰拍下加入影片最后一幕···最后终于完成了并上传评审···

虽然最终只获得了鼓励奖，但大家都很快乐~而布兰因为这部电影被大人物关注以作家的身份出道···
“激次元组合 战机少女 vs 丧尸军团” The End

然后被妮普禔努叫停！影研社的目的可不是只为了拍摄一部电影的！于是她们打算继续拍续篇···

并解决DOQ丧尸问题！续篇肯定存在新角色！于是应该有新成员和新社员···

谜之人似乎在解除谜之封印···DOQ丧尸似乎就是这个封印松动的缘故而出现的！

刚转学来的天王星涡芽就被大伙们恶作剧了！直到布兰出来澄清···然后拉入社，加入要求要一起对抗八奇魔神！封印在这座岛上的八个魔神之一！

影片中，天王星涡芽以国际刑警的身份加入英雄们，从她那得知黑历史，八奇魔神是丧尸之王被封印在这座岛上，N财团偷出力量碎片制造病毒！于是英雄们的目的转为封印如果可以打败丧尸之王。

大家准备解决丧尸问题，从天王星涡芽那得知游汐叶界从太古时期到现在埋葬的黑暗部分，八奇魔神被封印在岛上！可惜不晓得具体位置在哪，
不过这时候妮普禔努介绍新加入的了学园最强太妹普露露···

影片中，结社的领导找到了背叛结社的英雄们，控制丧尸攻击英雄，天王星涡芽扮演的角色帮妮普禔努的角色挡下攻击扑街了···

天王星涡芽对于一直没找到封印地而纠结，但大家觉得既然暂时找不到也不急于一时···那就快乐地拍摄吧···然后新成员毕也和萝姆和兰姆介绍下加入···大家都介意毕也女神化后比贝儿还大！！

影片中，突然出现孪生小女孩，然后又是丧尸变的！

学园的丧尸化越来越严重了，净化快来不及了···布兰这里最后一个场景打算留下大家最真实的一面，而不是构想的故事···
同时怀疑八奇魔神就封印在校园地下···

影片中，结社的领导继续丢丧尸，还丢出丧尸之王，英雄们打败丧尸之王···

妲姆莎芙从一年6班那发现异常，在那间教室中她们听到八奇魔神正在诱惑她们赚钱···

电影的最后一个镜头直接把八奇魔神当作丧尸之王打败。打败后丧尸居然没被净化！反而在布兰和妮普禔努Kiss后净化了···

最终影片获得鼓励奖···

- Chistes pobres, y comedia(algo que caracteriza mucho a los juegos de Neptunia) prácticamente inexistente.
- Reutilización de recursos abusiva. El juego aporta poco y nada comparado con U Action Unleashed ademas de encima quitar cosas que si eran bien recibidas, como la pose de victoria a la hora de acabar las misiones. Que decisión mas extraña.

Se tratando da série de jogos da Neptunia acabo ignorando a maioria de seus títulos em decorrer disto. Quero dizer, prefiro jogos de ação em tempo real.
Conheci este game em época de promoção, no qual se oferecia alguns pacotes de jogos da Neptunia e um deles consistia nos jogos de ação (apenas 3, sendo este, mais o Cyberdimension Neptunia e o Hyperdimension Neptunia U). No caso, este é o primeiro que zerei 100%.

Falando da minha experiência, foi simplesmente boa (nada fantástico, mas me rendeu algumas horas de diversão, 28 horas pra ser mais exato rs). No caso, o game conta com um modo história bem curto (você zera em algumas horas, acho que passei ela inteira em cerca de 5 horas). Claro, no caso, não acompanhei os diálogos (se o fizesse acho que estenderia de meia hora e 1 hora a mais).

Se fosse só isso que o game tivesse a oferecer, provavelmente eu não o indicaria. Contudo, ele conta com o modo ""Multi"" que é feito para jogar online, mas infelizmente é raro encontrar alguém pra jogar. Felizmente dá pra jogar neste modo sozinho e é por meio deste que você realmente vai ter os maiores desafios do game, incluso chefes que não existem no modo história. Em decorrência disto, será necessário, para os desafios mais avançados, que se eleve o level de alguma personagem de preferência (no caso, acabei usando mais a Tamsoft e a Iris Heart, mas, vai da preferência do jogador). Vale lembrar que elas vão sendo liberadas no modo história (a Tamsoft que citei é disponível desde o início, se não me falha a memória, mas a Plutia, que quando transformada vira a Iris Heart, é liberada no meio de seu progresso no modo história). Elevar níveis de ataque e defesa são essenciais para completar o modo Multi, especialmente se for sozinho (foi o que fiz, no caso rs). 

A gameplay é agradável, embora não tenha um modo tutorial para facilitar o aprendizado (tem apenas uns prints disponíveis). Contudo, é simples de aprender, não tem um gameplay complexo.

Enfim, é mais ou menos isso. Eu recomendo o game, especialmente em época de promoção (atualmente sai quase de graça em época de promoção rs). Tem um DLC também que basicamente disponibiliza alguns, digamos, brindes (Wallpapers, Artbook), mas não é essencial para a experiência do game em si.",1627336803,1627337486,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

По сравнении с предыдущей игрой геймплей слегка доработали и исправили (но по сравнении с Senran Kagura от этих же разработчиков игра очень простая), ранее у Юни была имбовая бесконечная стрельба, в этой игре ее мувсет обновили и здесь такое не прокатит, так же убрали разрушаемость одежды у персонажей (кому это будет минусом, но я рад что они это убрали) но рваную одежду можно надеть заранее (но сначала ее нужно разблокировать, и она доступна только основному ростеру из предыдущей игры), но так же отсутствует победная анимация, не критично но это можно было оставить. В игре есть мультиплеерный кооперативный режим, в котором доступны новые противники и боссы, которые не фигурируют в основном сюжете. К сожалению онлайн здесь мёртв и для мультиплеера нужно будет искать тематические дискорд сервера, но иногда сами разработчики игры приглашают игроков на свои стримы, а для получения онлайн достижений можно играть и одному.
Игра хорошая, но короткая, отсылки на видеоигровую индустрию и юмор так же присутствует.

It doesn't even deserve anything higher than a Mixed rating.

This game is what you get when you don't expect anything better from the masterminds of not giving a rat's bum about making actually good games.

MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies (which I will now shorten to ZombieNep because any game that tries to have ""omg quirkyyyyy!!! long name!!! XDD"" is just annoying at this point) is a lot like the previous Neptunia action game - completely not worth your time and money, ahem, I mean, it's a Warriors game with none of the fun of playing one.

I shall now copy and paste some parts of the review I made for Action Unleashed, to reflect how the developers copied and pasted some parts of Action Unleashed to make this game.



This game is a perfect description of me: mostly soulless, boring, and the things it does, others do way better for the same price. This is a game that got Very Positive solely because of the franchise it is so sloppily stapled to. If any other developer were to make something of this calibre, it would get laughed out the door. A tried and true example of ""Why spend money to make a good game, when our horny fans will buy it anyway?""

The enemies lack any sort of intelligence, with their sole purpose seemingly to just merge their body with yours in the vain hopes of dealing damage. You'd have to play like a complete idiot to even give them a fighting chance. I get that this is a Warriors type game, but even other Warriors games don't have infantry that are this incompetent at doing their one, sole job. And for fuchs sake, sometimes the enemies can't even hit you while you're standing right next to them.

Combat is incredibly boring and repetitive - even more so than Dynasty Warriors 9 despite only being a mere fraction of the length. It's your standard Warriors affair with large, sweeping normal and heavy attacks, special attacks for quick area clearing, and EXE Drives for killing anyone in the same postal code. Yet, for some reason, despite having all the basic fundamentals of a Warriors game, it's nowhere near as fun as one should be. The balancing between the playable characters is completely non-existent, and you can steamroll the entire game in your sleep - the state in which the game most certainly would bore you into. 

Stages never last longer than three minutes. And to all those that would inevitably say ""It's a portable console game, the levels aren't supposed to be long"". Two words: Monster Hunter. Hell, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker was on the PSP, so any arguments that portable console games are supposed to have short levels are invalid.

You can tell they really just wanted to phone it in - an astounding lack of passion and effort that is honestly almost on par with the annual EA sports games.

I won't even talk about the story because it's forgettable. I dunno, something happens at a school or something and it involves zombies, I guess, and everything that happens in between are a blurry haze. At the very least, most of the game is voice acted in English for all you dub fans, and the writing for the banter between characters is alright. But that's it, really, the only good things about this game don't even pertain to what's arguably the most important aspect of an action-oriented video game - the gameplay.



Now for the things that are different.

At the very least they made new maps... that they don't even use in their entirety, and are entirely flat, and uninteresting. Christ almighty, it's like for every step forward they take, they run back eight hundred miles.

You can block... In a game where most characters have evade dashes that allow them to span the entire Great Wall of China, so it's completely pointless... Unless you're abusing its ability to cancel the recovery animation of evade dashes, meaning the only reasonable purpose of the block is so you can dodge faster. So much for guarding.

There's a character progression system. It's basic, but it's there.

There's online multiplayer... with some of the worst idiot netcode I've seen in my life. Playing CS 1.6 with a 56k modem is a far smoother experience than ZombieNep's pitiful excuse for online multiplayer. Crashes can happen for any reason. Switch character in the lobby? Crash. Fight a boss in an empty arena with your best mate? Crash. Just launching the damn multiplayer? Crash. I'm all but certain that if your PC detects you coughing too loudly in multiplayer it would probably be grounds to cause the game to crash.



The optimisation is of questionable quality. The game seems to suffer from slowdown at time, especially during sections of heavy combat. It's not a frequent occurrence, but it happens enough for me to notice. My rig isn't the best, but you'd think a GTX 1050,  16 GB of RAM, and an i7 would be able to run a Vita port.


Look, if you wanted a good musou or Warriors game... Senran Kagura and the actual Warriors games exist. There's no need to waste your time and money on this one like I have. Don't even buy this game on sale. Don't reward mediocrity.",1620464214,1620464214,False,1,1,0.477884829044342041,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Story is just filler and also the game is very short. The map is empty and I really don't like the bullet sponge enemies. The game just tells you all the controls at the beginning and doesn't explain any of them properly.

It features characters from all 4 mainline games (up to VII), so it's recommended you play all those first, else you'll be left wondering who are all these characters and why are they hanging out together.

The gameplay is the same kind of [url=store.steampowered.com/app/411830]Senran Kagura[/url] lite just like Action Unleashed. But the mechanics have been expanded a bit, there are now lock on and block/parry buttons. Just like before you take two characters on a mission, switch between them whenever, go HDD if you feel like it, and mash buttons a lot. The gameplay is very easy and very shallow, even compared to Senran Kagura. The enemies are very slow moving and telegraph their attacks way in advance, so the only difficulty is not falling asleep while you're hacking away at the more spongy ones.

The game features the whole cast from Action Unleashed (that is, 4 CPU's, 4 candidates + Dengekiko & Famitsu), as well as some newcomers, namely Plutia, Peashy, Uzume and Tamsoft (the developer's original character, also appears as an NPC in [url=store.steampowered.com/app/632350]Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online[/url]). Iffy and Compa sadly aren't playable.

While Action Unleashed was almost entirely an asset flip of Re;Birth games in a Senran Kagura engine, MegaTagmension is a higher effort production and features many new assets thanks to its school/zombie theme. The girls get cute school uniforms, there are new enemies, levels and backgrounds. Of course, a decent amount of assets are still recycled because hey it's a Neptunia game and it has to be eco-friendly. But overall, the graphics are nicer than in Action Unleashed, and the Live2D scenes are 1080p this time around instead of 720p.

The clothes tearing mechanic (which was prominent in Action Unleashed and Senran Kagura games) is now gone. Seems like it was a last minute change probably because of censorship concerns. You can even equip torn versions of default outfits, but the gradual tearing of clothes (along with the very sexy cutscenes that accompanied it) is not in the game anymore.

Overall, the story and gameplay won't blow your mind, but it's a decent time waster if you like the Neptunia series and its characters.

和那張蘭姆蘿姆瑟瑟發指的CG((笑))

但其實故事模式每個關卡的戰鬥也就沒熱身好就結束的感覺
因為一場戰鬥快的10秒 大部分1分鐘 最終BOSS久一丟丟 就結束了
如果說這是割草遊戲呢...爽度不足
明明是個單機這種一場戰鬥10秒30秒1分鐘完事的感覺搞得像個手遊一樣
線上模式感覺就是一個戰鬥長一點點的單機模式!(無誤

不過感覺沒動力 沒勁 我連單角色100級都沒刷上去
刷到六七十左右都覺得膩了
就是感覺沒什麼意思的刷 可玩性不足 爽度沒有

I really like Nep games, and I managed to enjoy MegaTagmension because of that, but I'm not fanatic and I can see how it's just an atrocious garbage of a game.

This time, the star is Blanc, who decides to write and direct a zombie movie in their school so it doesn't close, and real zombies appear, which is a blessing so they can save production money. The playstyle is a hack and slash, a musou, with light RPG elements, very similar to Action Unleashed.

PROS:
- The characters you know and love
- It features both a Story mode and a ""Multi"" mode, in which you can play online with friends. (in theory? I never saw anyone online). You can solo Multi lol, but no local co-op for you.

NEUTRAL:
- Like all of Nep games, at least 80% of assets are recycled from other Nep games. Characters, outfits, enemies, items... I mean, they're good, but when you're at your 5th or 6th game, it starts to feel like a rip off. And it is that.
- Runs smoothly and glitch-free today, but I've read there were bugs before.

CONS:
- Combat ""system"" is full of features you'll never need to use, as you'll just need to dash and mash the simple attack button. Use skills when they charge. Dodge and defend only if you want to end the battle faster. And forget about items, I never ever used them. I didn't even ever felt the need to transform into HDD.
- Extremely unbalanced. You get a fuse (craft) system that requires high-end materials for stuff you can acquire in much easier ways. I only crafted once, for the achievement. Most of the items I still wasn't able to craft because of the lack of materials, even after 100%ing the game with all achievements, and I had tons of those items to be crafted anyways. Basically, the products are very common, while their ingredients can be extremely rare. How does that make sense?
- Weapons. Each girls gets 4. While the latest weapons have stronger raw power, they don't have as many ""slots"" for ""attachments"" which improve it, so they don't feel like an improvement (unless you're not using those attachments), and I still feel that need for an ultimate weapon.
- Insanely long loading screens, which probably amounts to about 5 hours of my total gameplay. It's really annoying when you spend more time loading into and out of the stage than in the actual stage (not always, but can happen when you're farming easier stages. To make things worse, Multi adds a 10-sec ""ending session"" timer to your wait.
- Awful story. Nep games don't have good stories (they don't, fans), but it's usually nice to see they interact and act silly, and generate some sort of goofy comedy. I'm not sure if it's because Blanc was in command, but the story was a really tedious experience that can cure severe cases of insomnia. Every chapter is basically the same things, girls acting in a scene of the movie Blanc is shooting. It can be fun 2, 3 times, but when I was halfway through the Story mode, I couldn't take it anymore and started skipping dialogues, for the first time in a Nep game, and for the first time in a looooong time for all games.
- Some maps are complex, but those are always very empty. You can walk around (painfully slowly) and explore, but there's nothing to gain, not even enemies to fight.
- Lacks decent explanations about most stuff. I'll split this into multiple topics:
>> You don't have a proper inventory. If you want to know how many of an item you have (unless it's a consumable), you have to try to sell that item,
>> No bestiary where you can keep track of enemies weaknesses and strengths, or which have you defeated yet.
>> It took me many stages to realize how to equip consumables, but even then I never got to use an item.
>> Hard to access information on lily rank bonuses, but again those matter little
>> No information on skills, except for when you actually try them out
>> It's absurd that you have to leave Story mode in order to access the Gallery, especially when the Gallery provides hints (sometimes inaccurate) on how to unlock extra scenes in Story mode. So there, more loading screens if you want to check the Gallery (don't, just use a guide)
>> Half-baked and poorly explained weakness/strength system, and very unbalanced in the sense that some attack types are the weakness of many bosses, while others don't show at all for the major bosses.

VERDICT:
There are probably still many bad things to talk about this game. I enjoyed it because, you know, I like the Nepverse, but it's  objective a terrible game. If you honestly want to know, then this game is probably not for you. If you're reading just to talk trash because you're die-hard fan, then nothing I say will matter anyway...",1610600599,1610600773,False,8,0,0.598985731601715088,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Currently, i've only played this one so my judgement will not be based on Neptunia U or any other action game from the series.

Based on that I can say that the game is decent for a Neptunia Game.
You have your classic jokes in the main story and some good references from other games and all. In term of design it's Neptunia so it's a classic.
The main problem for me at the moment is that the game feel kind of sluggish until you get used to it and even after that there's still a weird feeling to it.
There is a good cast of character from the Neptunia games and it's clearly a plus for those who want specific character (do inform yourself to know which ones are here)

I've totaly completed the game from Story to multiplayer missions and it's totaly doable as a solo player. Nothing really hard once you've found the character you enjoy to play !

As for the Multiplayer i'ven't tried it with any friend so i can't really judge this part, i'm pretty sure it's ok from previous IF experiences (nothing great and it's playable).

Finally, for the price tag, I would recommend to pick it during a sale or in a Neptunia Bundle.

TL;DR : Okay Neptunia Action game with a decent story for a Neptunia. Wait for a sale or a Bundle !

因為人物升級只是給你點數去分配能力 而不是全能力提升 導致前期到中期沒通關故事模式之前難度略高
通關故事模式之後會解鎖作弊 這時候就比較好一點去割草 然而到多人模式 你會發現作弊用不了
多人模式5星最後一關才是真正的last boss 裝備可以帶個Earth patch（攻擊附加吸血）可以全程滿血通關 Keep patch是個好東西
多人模式居然還有每週限定關卡 就是所謂的素材關卡 解成就的話這些限定關卡幾乎都要打 個人就打了星期一到四的關卡 解完全寶箱收集和全怪物擊殺 就全成就了

At first, I thought this game was okay. The story is overtly goofy and vaguely feels like something the Neptune Crew would be involved in. A number of cutscenes change depending on who you bring into battle, but only the most dedicated will see all of them.
The gameplay is what hurts BNVZ. Attacks often outright sail right past their target. There are only a few bland enemy types and bosses, and little strategy is involved, even with bosses: just hit the enemies until the EXE-Drive charges, then let them have it. Unfortunately, EXE attacks have a very limited range, and enemies will often move just out of range, rendering your efforts moot.

另外第一遍刷的时候不需要追求sss，通关之后故事模式就可以开一击必杀之类的，联机模式连不到人是个问题，但单刷也不难，只要满防御的女神模式基本上都是无伤过，除了最后那个boss之外其它的boss基本上造不成什么伤害。
5000连击的成就不需要特意去刷，联机模式的每日任务（貌似是周日的任务）里有一个无论怎么打都只掉一滴血还不会还手的怪，拿那个慢慢刷就好了，攻略里拿女神模式的rom刷的方式还要观察boss走位，虽然只要一直顶上去就ok，但还是比较麻烦的。",1581852717,1581852717,True,0,2,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Игра, это явная деградация по сравнению с прошлой частью(Hyperdimension Neptunia U), игра приобрела несколько новый механик, но при этом потеряла кучу по сравнению с прошлой. Я могу посоветовать вам в неё поиграть только если вы ярый фанат серии, если же нет, но вы хотели бы познакомится с этой серией, лучше купите Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1.

Плюсы:
1).Сеттинг,
2).Музыка,
3).Введение ещё нескольких новый играбельных персонажей
4).Появление полноценного мультиплеера

Нейтральное:
1).Мне не понравилось как переозвучили некоторые фразы старых персонажей,
2).Появления кулдауна для применения способностей, на замену полоске SP, при этом сами навыки стали менее эффективными,
3).Основной акцент в этой части сделан на мультиплеер,
4).Появление, на первый взгляд интересной, но оставшейся на уровне идеи механики изменения диалогов при выборе других персонажей на уровень, которая просто меняет персонажа говорящего ту же самую реплику, и лишь в паре диалогов поменялась 1-2 фразы в диалоге.

Минусы:
1).Некоторые старые персонажи потеряли приёмы при том что их и так не много,
2).Самая короткая и бесполезная сюжетная кампания из всей серии,
3).Введение самостоятельной прокачки статов персонажа и открытия комбо (раньше статы и приёмы просто прокачивались с уровнем), 
4).Прокачка персонажа теперь проходит до неприличия медленно (я после получения всех ачивок и прохождения абсолютно всех миссий и в сюжете и в мультиплеере, и перепрохождения некоторых раз по 50 раз смог прокачать только 1 персонажа до максимального уровня, остальные не ушли дальше 25-30 уровней),
5).Введение дебильной ачивки на комбо из 5000 ударов, и при этом в игре нет уровня где его можно получить без гайда и игровых читов открывающихся после прохождения сюжета, приходится лезть в гайд, брать юни, скидывать её статы на 1 уровень, включить чит на бессмертие и сопротивление отбрасываниям от атаки врага и идти долбить кнопку лёгкой атаки на последнем боссе сюжетной кампании, при этом с первого раза у вас ничего не выйдет так как этот счётчик комбо сбрасывается ну очень быстро, так что после этого ваш палец и джойстик или клавиатура скажут вам спасибо(Нет),
6).Игра стала до неприличия лёгкой,
7).Ни в сюжете, ни в мультиплеере нет каких-нибудь интересных миссий, все заключаются в истреблении монстров, даже миссии по сбору вещей падающих с монстров или миссий с какими нибудь особыми условиями по типу бей только навыками или убей 2 противников одновременно из прошлой части убрали, и есть только 1 немного отличающаяся от остальных, нужно найти на карте спрятанных врагов, и это также единственная миссия где используется кнопка прыжка и вертикальность уровня, так как некоторые эти враги сидят на возвышенности.
8).Как по мне мультиплеер при всей своей короткости и однообразности, это слабая замена арене, Башни Нептрала, и сайдквестам из сюжетной кампании Hyperdimension Neptunia U.

Мой вердикт, даже при том что это спинноф серии он плох, игра по эмоциям не отобьёт потраченное на её прохождение время. Если рассматривать её как просто игру, в разрез серии, то она средняя, ни плохая, ни хорошая, в неё можно поиграть и получить от этого удовольствия, типичная игра на 1-2 вечера.
Моя оценка её как части серии 5\10
Как самостоятельной игры 6,5\10

Спасибо тем кто дочитал, но не верьте мне на слово, если вам действительно интересна эта игра, то скачайте её с торрента, и если понравится потом купите её, это моё мнение и оно вполне может отличатся от вашего, и если это так то не нужно бежать в коменты и писать ""обзор хрень, автор идиот и ничего не понимает"", а просто напишите с чем вы не согласны и мы вполне сможем это обсудить, поэтому всегда имейте своё мнение и не позволяйте кому-то навязывать его вам.

Эту игру не за что хвалить.
Минусы:
 - Выдохшиеся сценаристы, которые не смогли ни в юмор, ни в хоть сколько-нибудь интересную историю;
 - Раздражающие, не понятно зачем сделанные, завершающие анимации в конце комбо. К примеру, убирание меча за спину у Тамсофт, так как на время её выполнения персонаж на несколько секунд становится не управляемым. Но при этом он будет получать урон, так как неуязвимости в этот момент тоже нет;
 - Всего пять типов арен, да и те выглядят убого;
 - Крайне малое разнообразие как рядовых противников, так и боссов;
 - Долгие загрузки;
 - Ужасная камера;
 - Кошмарное прицеливание. К примеру, при сражении с боссом игра отдаёт приоритет в захвате на мелких монстрах, а не на самом боссе.

如果和我一樣是使用鍵盤操作的玩家，在遊戲的操作方法上面，可能需要花稍微多一點時間去適應，不過遊戲一開始的任務都非常簡單，玩家可以透過這些簡單的任務去熟悉操作方式，為角色提升等級，來提升角色的生命值、攻擊力、防禦力與技能，並且賺取信用點，到商店購買新的武器、道具與寶物，等到慢慢進行到後面比較困難的任務時，玩家也更能夠輕鬆地擊退敵人並完成任務，同時隨著故事劇情的發展，也會有更多的角色可以提供玩家來遊玩。^^
而我認為這款遊戲最成功的地方，是在於劇情方面很具有創新性，而且既輕鬆又好笑，讓玩家在進行遊戲的時候，不僅能夠享受橫掃殭屍的快感，穿插的遊戲劇情也可以讓玩家更期待後面的劇情發展。^^另外，在遊戲主選單的布蘭，還會依據當下的遊玩日期，用不同的方式和玩家打招呼，例如夏天的時候，布蘭會說：「好熱啊!實在是熱過頭了。」到了秋冬之際的時候，布蘭就會說：「天氣開始變涼了」之類的話，到現在接近耶誕節的時候，布蘭還會祝大家「Merry Christmas」呢!^^這確實有讓我感受到開發團隊的用心呢!^^
最後，這款遊戲也有多人連線模式，可以讓玩家在線上和好友們一起來遊玩。多人連線的任務當中，也有更多不同種類的敵人和獎勵讓玩家去收集。已經完成遊戲主線劇情的玩家，也不妨到多人連線模式來試試身手呢!^^

Review:
I am not really a huge fan of the neptune series, not in a way that I dislike it, but more to not being too familiar with who's who and what this series is about and whatnot. I've only played Nep U which was repetitive and the Re;Birth that was a turn based rpg in which i didn't play it much because I'm not a fan of turn based anyways.

The gameplay is good, there are combos and consumables, exe drive, transformation and all the good stuff. My only complaint is that using a (PS4) controller, I had to swap my dash(circle) with R2(which had nothing mapped). Most JRPGs I've played had to press R1 or R2 to dash or evade. I do like the progression system in which you level up, spend skill points and setup your gears before the battle. It's like a simpler Nier;Automata.

Storyline is okay, it's cheesy and fills in your time as well as progress your characters. You'll probably need to play this to get the few treasures you want.

The Multiplayer is great, only if you have friends because I almost can't find a stranger's lobby and nobody joins my lobby anyways. You get access to unique missions and enemies that are not in the storyline. The progression and reward here is good too. I just wished I could transform from normal form because I'm used to it when I'm playing the campaign. And also wish that people would join the lonely me.

Overall, god I love plutia and iris heart.",1572189819,1572189819,True,11,3,0.645794928073883057,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Com um enredo bobo (uma escola que está para ser fechada é atacada por zumbis, e Blanc tenta salvar a escola no concurso de artes gravando um filme com os alunos enfrentando a ""organização"" e os zumbis), o spin-off da Blanc acaba sendo mais fácil que o esperado para a personagem mais casca grossa da franquia e traz uma série de personagens mais interessantes com os quais se pode jogar, como Nepgear, Noire, Uni e Vert. Você pode escolher apenas um personagem para a batalha ou formar duplas, podendo alternar entre os lutadores durante a batalha, e dependendo da dupla que o jogador escolhe (Uni + Noire, por exemplo), novos especiais são liberados e até a pontualçao de XP pode ser influenciada. Os comandos são bem simples e o sistema de evolução lembra o de Phantom Breaker, no qual você ganha pontos de XP e decide a quais atributos vai destina-los.

O grande pecado é que o jogo está mais para um beat'em up 3d do que um action RPG, com lutas extremamente rápidas e pouco desafio (a maioria é resolvida antes de 1 minuto). Os inimigos também não possuem uma boa A.I., causando mais problemas pela quantidade e aproximação simultânea do que pela dificuldade em si. A trilha sonora atende ao proposto bem, apesar do tema da intro ser horrível, compensando com a ending que é muito boa.

Poucos extras fecham o pacote desse jogo que, poderia ter sido tão bom quanto o 4 Goddesses Online bem antes de seu lançamento, mas fica na mediocridade. O que salva, como sempre, é a inconveniência de Neptune e os momentos engraçados entre os personagens, e até um momento muito esperado de fan service entre duas sisters.

Indicado para fãs da série e jogadores casuais que só querem passar um tempinho.

And unlike action unleashed, this game has online co-op, so if you and a friend have the game, it's a fun experience together. For a few people, that might just be the deciding factor to chose this over Action Unleashed.

As for the plot, it's so bare bones you'd be forgiven if you even remember there's a story by the end of the game.

The pros are that if you like Neptunia, the characters are as charming as always, so at least there's that.

As such, it features the Neptunia characters in a different game and a different environment. This clearly compares to Action Unleashed, and I'd say it does better. It's not particularly long if you just go through the story and only level one character.

Now, it's on the easy side, as always. I've only really played Neptune, and found it easy to keep her overlevelled. I don't even remember whether I took damage :-) Afterwards, while I was heading for level 99, there was never anything that could hurt her, and there's only one boss that can hurt a level 99 Purple Heart. But that's just achievement grinding, of course. I still have to kill him a few times for his rare drop.

It has some kind of multiplayer, but I don't know much about it. You can't do the story in MP, as usual. ""Multiplay"" is important for achievements, but worry not: all of it can be soloed no problem.

Do make sure you have a guide handy. The game doesn't tell you where to get things like treasure drops, and it does NOT tell you how to unlock the extra ""backstage"" scenes. Which, btw., have no english voice acting -- although it's the first Neptunia game that I've played that just plays Japanese in this case (which is better than keeping it silent).

But Idea Factory are really getting more and more lazy.
Not only the game is buggy and very badly optimized, loading times are a pain in the ***, but the game itself is just copy / paste from every Neptune game ever. 
Same content as always, and the gameplay is bland, boring and too easy, there is no threat nor any challenge in this game, plus it is very short.
I'm all for an action hack and slash of Hyperdimension, but at least, make it good and somewhat a bit challenging with good replay value, different enemies and different content.
It's getting really annoying to always end up with the same content in each game, party-wise, it's al right, but enemy and other content-wise, it's not okay, they'll have to change their way otherwise i'll just stop buying their games or i'll wait until they'll be like 2$, their real worth.
Because let's be honest, with such bland gameplay, same content game after game, it's not worth much at this point.
Story is kind of confusing and doesn't really make sense at all, its mediocre at best.

Despise loving Hyperdimension, its characters and its story, this game is just not worth it, and if they keep making the same games again and again, none of them will be worth it, so if you want to see a change, stop buying their game full price, they won't have a choice but to actually make new content, new mechanics, new stuff and of course, a better gameplay for those hack & slash games.

Este juego es el segundo hecho por Tamsoft. De nuevo perteneciente al género hack'n'slash aunque con muchos cambios desde el primero. Algunos muy interesantes mientras que otros un tanto desagradables.

Empezando directamente por los buenos tenemos el Multiplayer. Como ya te habrás imaginado, 3 años despues del lanzamiento vas a necesitar contar con amigos para jugar en grupo, sin embargo no te preocupes, ya que todas las misiones se pueden completar en solitario.
Otro cambio muy importante ha sido el hacer que los lily ranks se incremente en solo 1 mision en lugar de 3. Algo de agredecer a la hora de completar el juego por completo.

Tambien se ha modificado la forma en la que funciona el equipo. En lugar de contar con diferentes armas y accesorios, en este juego utilizarás armas que a la vez se equipan con idea chips y unos accesorios especiales llamados ""parts"" que se desbloquean en el multiplayer. He de decir que tardé muchísimo en descubrir como funcionan los chips de arma y casi no he encontrado información al respecto en internet. Por otra parte, las parts solo aportan unos pequeños bonus defensivos por lo que al final en lo único en lo que te fijarás será en el atributo de tu arma y la debilidad del enemigo.

Por otra parte, a los 10 personajes de la entrega anterior ahora podemos sumar otros 4: Plutia, Peashy, Uzume y Tamsoft. Con sus respectivas transformaciones.

Aunque no todos los cambios son buenos. Los combos han cambiado de una entrega a otra eliminando, entre otras cosas; la posibilidad de enlazar facilmente un combo con otro, lo que provoca que la fluidez del combate se vuelva un tanto espesa al quedarse tu personaje demasiado tiempo parado en mitad de una animación final o simplemente por no poder hacer ciertas acciones en ciertos momentos. Desgraciadamente este es uno de los puntos más negativos del juego ya que además han aumentado la dificultad respecto al anterior título considerablemente.

Y precisamente de dificultad va el siguiente punto: Esta vez, al subir de nivel nos darán la opcion de gastar puntos de atributo en cuatro categorías: ataque, defensa, salud y combo. Da la casualidad de que si aumentas tu defensa lo suficiente llegará el momento en que ningún, en serio, ningún enemigo del juego te podrá hacer daño. Lo que reduce las peleas a una molestia mas que un desafío.

Otro punto que quizá a alguno le resulte interesante es que ya no existe el costume break. En lugar de ello tendremos los trajes normales y los trajes rotos para equipar desde el principio, y los personajes que no formaban parte del juego anterior no tendrán versión rota. No es algo que afecte a la jugabilidad, pero quizá a alguien le parezca importante a la hora de decidir.

Y la historia: pues como todos los juegos es sencilla y absurda. Vale para echarse unas risas a costa de las voces y caras de las protagonistas y poco más. Hay algún detalle bastante interesante pero que prefiero no destripar.

En conclusión: recomiendo el juego por que a pesar de sus fallos me ha entretenido mucho. Sin embargo tened en cuenta que la entrega anterior es muchísimo mejor en la mayoría de aspectos.

1. Режим КООПератива
В этой игре можно надирать задницы зомби максимум в четвером, мне нравится.

2. Эксплоиты
Есть такой эксплойт, который мне до пuздbI понравился.

3. Управление
Недонократно в своих обзорах на игры с Непками я писал о проблеме с управлением.
Но здесь к моей неожиданости меня тут устроило управление.

4. Режим РПГ
Что я тут имею в виду? Я подразумеваю под тем. что можно сражатся с врагами не пошагого, а в реальном времени.
Да, это создаёт малые дискомфорт после тех игр, в которые я играл, но всё-же.

It is based off the Manga series which has all the CPU'S attending high school. Which I assume translated means an excuse to have girls in school uniform. But that is not the point at hand. This game s about the Film Club headed by our favourate protag (or should that be Neptag) Neptune and she asks Blanc to write a script. They begin to shoot a horror movie but then the students really do become Zombies and everything kicks off from there,

The combat is the exact same as in U, but this time the maps are alot smaller. Each mission is presented a scene and often you will get a different version of a cutscene if you replay a mission with a certain set of characters. The scene don't change dramatically but it can add a joke or 2 or even use the characters relationships for comedic effect.

Although this game is zany and in some areas just downright bokers it actually works. There are many hillarous scenes between Neptune and Blanc, and a sweet Nepgear and Uni scene. There is also a really funny moment between Neptune and Noire afterwards but they two always work well together.

All i can say is this game really asks of the player one thing:

Serious review below

TLDR: Get it on sale. The game is fun, but I don't feel that it's worth $25. You may not be playing it for long, but it's fun while you are.

Misc:
- No FOV slider, 0/10
- Camera can get a bit wonky at times.

Story/Singleplayer: 
It started out okay and fun, but declines in quality at Chapter 6. After that, there was too much filler and I gave up on trying to complete it. There are lily ranks if you wanna grind for that. The lily ranks give buffs, but they don't tell you how much.

Multiplayer: 
- It works, albeit with some crashing here and there. It wouldn't be a Neptunia game without some unexplainable bugs. 
- All missions can be done solo. 
- There are some filler missions, but they are a lot better than the story mode ones.
- You cannot transform in multiplayer because you can just choose the CPU/transformed form to start the missions with.

Gameplay (and some comparisons between Neptunia U):
- The game feels relaxing, as in you won't be swarmed by a bajillion enemies at close quarters all the time. Even when you are swarmed, you won't be stunlocked to death as the enemies attack way less. So when you do mess up, it's your own fault.
- The maps are waaayyyyy bigger than Nep U's.
- You can block now, thereby erasing everything wrong with Nep U.
- Some combos are locked behind leveling up the ""Technic"" stat. Dunno how I feel about that.
- Charge combos need more love. They leave you standing there without protection and can be easily interrupted (being attacked once), leaving you disappointed.
- Combos can't be interrupted by yourself, which is bad. Stuck doing a combo when the enemy is right about to attack you and you want to block? Sucks for you.
- Bosses and mini-bosses are annoying, just as they were in Neptunia U.
- Some bosses feel like reskins.

Overall, it's an enjoyable game and the positives outweigh the negatives.",1547013469,1556589586,True,4,0,0.483601629734039307,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm happy that this game has most characters in Neptunia series and you can customise them too. The plot is so funny to me, it's centred around ""It's so bad that I love it"" and it's great. Sad part of the game is that it's story mode is super short and it doesn't have the content of the CO-OP mode, this is bad because if you don't have a friend to play this with you then the story mode won't satisfy you. But if I remember it correctly, you can still play the CO-OP mode solo but I'm not sure. The CO-OP missions are great and they are better than story mode missions.

the mission in the game itself kind of short duo to the fact that you only need 2-5 min to done a mission there are no diffcult on this game other the mission level require hight level which emeny deal more damage you (cheat mode will unlock after the game done which is good )
the game also have good amount of cosmetics for your characters to use and you also able to change it how ever you want like 5 sun glasses stack on each other you can also unlock orignal characters outfit which it good i guess
for buying and sell item i dont really know i havent touched any of the patch or upgarde those thing other than buying better weapons and cosmetics the buying price for item is very cheap mean you dont have to grind that much to get what you need 
the characters design i know nothing about these characters so it very hard to tell i not sure if any character is over power or not becuase some boss and emeny have diffrent weakness against the characters
multiplayer in diffrent from single player becuase you just doing mission and fight boss over and over for an item that boost your character stats aleast multiplayer also use the data from the single player beside the multiplayer is ok if you have some one if not you gonna do every thing by yourself it better to have aleast some one if you down they can help you which make me remind of left 4 dead (i already done the hole multiplayer alone so meh) just to remind that single player you could use 2 character at the same time and 2 support while multiplayer you only allow to use 1

Idea Factory, as the name suggests, is a company that loves to explore and experiment different genres within the same franchise. Hyperdimension Neptunia was a JRPG, while this specific game is an action game. The result? I can't say that it's great but it's not bad either. I don't believe people were actually expecting something from this game, but nevertheless it is a very light hearted game, with a very funny story. The classic lewd moments in the dialogues are here, aswell as the ecchi stuff. The gameplay itself is really pretty straightforward containing some combos and a lot of button smashing. Soundtrack and almost all scenarios are basically a copy pasta from the other games. Also, the way you can customize acessories and adapt them to the characters is kinda impressive, making customization nice.
Well, Zombies is a over used theme that can cause boredom, but it does not matter here. All that matter is NEP NEP.

致命的是角色普通攻击硬直严重，且只有普通攻击的第一下和部分攻击可以被防御打断。

角色攻击动作结束之前不可改变角色方向。

从头到尾打一遍需要5个小时。
手感方面很粗糙，远远不如海王星V。
从前作中拿出来的建模直接用可以看出比较偷懒，算是个套壳游戏。
每个角色都有自己的技能和连段，然而日本游戏的通病，你可以一个套路不需要动脑的玩到底，完全不用考虑打法和配置，你掌握了使用连携技的节奏基本没什么难度，和mmo网游的玩法没有区别，所有角色都能使用连携技能，所以尽管这个游戏准备了大量可用角色，但是没什么意义。
本人使用xobx手柄打这款游戏，可以看出 ，键位基本完全照搬原作的psv版本，这点很不用心，无论是DS4手柄还是xbox手柄玩这款游戏都会存在明明有大量键位闲置，但是还是要使用组合键释放招式的情况，建议移植者买个微软手柄实际玩一下再重设键位，然后放进游戏内的设定选项里面。
这款游戏并不是一无是处，我们对它定位一下，它不是什么3A大作，甚至不是2A游戏，在打折的时候购入，是物有所值的，这款游戏的画质不错，配音演出很到位，一场战斗往往只需要一分钟左右，低配置的机器用来消遣是不错的选择，每个角色都可以培养，如果喜欢她们，倒是可以尝试练满看看的。

Better graphics and dialogue art; alternative scenes. It's obvious to me that the developers learned a lot from Action Unleashed and moved to improve their game.

The one thing that might be aggravating are the achievements, but only if you're a completionist. They require significant grinding and also involve multiplayer - which is dead.

4.这个游戏比前作海王星U要整体好不少
5.这个游戏自带截图功能(360°的哦~)
6.这个游戏剧情上是日常卖萌(性感诺瓦贝露在线直播哭泣)
7.这个游戏可以联机,游戏体验性非常好(比起四女神简直好的不行)

au niveau du mode SOLO :
- On retrouve tous les personnages de la série ""Hyperdimension Neptunia The animation"" ce qui est un très bon point.
- Les personnages sont customisable. Vous aimez pas une tenue? changez-la !
- Sur le sénario c'est du Neptunia traditionnel (scénario bien écrit, avec un sens...)
au niveau du mode MULTIJOUEUR :
- Malgrès la limitation au niveau du multijoueur je peut vous le conseiller si vous et vos amis habitez dans la même région.
Si vous habitez pas dans la même région que vôtre ami vous pourrez avoir quelques problèmes pour trouver sa session.
- Multijoueur stable : Le mode multijoueur du jeu est (pour ma part) assès stable. (tant que la connexion reste assès bonne et que l'ordinateur de l'hôte ne lag pas en fps.)

Good:

+ good graphics for a port
+ playable at 4K (game still stretch 1920  to full 4k), fiddle with graphic console settings. and voila great game with 4k smooth graphics....
+ great effects
+ some new cool tracks
+ easy story
+ cool conversations
+ many chars to choose from
+ many new maps
+ online multiplayer
+ interesting cutscenes
+ lovely artwork
+ easy to control
+ great effects and realisation of movements
+ new Monsters
+ good customizeable accessory (resize, make bigger etc.)
+ interesting chars with many variations in fighting styles (all have there ups and downs)
+ Blanc, Iris Heart, Black Sister, Uni, Dengikiko
+ best Zombie voices from voice actors (best is Dengikiko)
+ great japanese voiceover as ever (english: just NO)
+ cool background and visuals as ever
+ cool soundtrack
+ easy navigation in menues
+ all in 4k greatness, looked so much better then the native 1920
+ much to laugh about 


Bad:
- some screen tearing
- fps drops from 60-50 sometimes
- minor crashes
- multiplayer is pretty easy
- some audio tearing

as great as the game is. it is sure short. i am a slow player and finished around 25 hours the storyline. 100% gameplay was finished in additional ~15 hours or so. i hope next time the gameplay gets a lot bigger. Neptunia U was great too and this game is great too. the graphics are smoother, movement too. but you need a good pc to cover the medium port. i give the whole game 95% it sure is great....",1515888055,1515888055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cannot run the game past the second level of Chapter 2. It just freezes and crashes the moment I gain control of whichever character I select. I know the system requirements say that the game may not run well on AMD processors but this lack of optimization is just plain unacceptable.

Impressions (of the limited play-time I had) from someone new to the Neptunia franchise: English voice acting is rather bad, like ""one person does most of the characters"" bad. Story is mostly just there as an excuse for the gameplay to exist, and the AI is really dumb. Controls are loose and combos have no ""feel"" to them.

在剧情方面，因为本作跟正传也没什么关系，所以剧情还是挺轻松搞笑的，声优们的表现也可圈可点，对于喜欢海王星系列的玩家还是值得一玩。
对于成就党而言，该作的成就获取难度也算是较低，除了打倒所有种类敌人需要细心不要漏怪和5000连击需要点技巧，剩下的成就基本不是通关送就是无脑刷，全成就还是比较容易的（虽然本人没有）。成就神作，值得一刷。
不过作为一款ACT游戏，本作的战斗还是有地方不太友好。永远锁到杂兵的锁定，不是XXXX就是XYXY的连招（大概是设计时候偷懒了），砍掉了不少连招套路，也降低了不少战斗时的乐趣，比较遗憾。
还有就是角色要跑到指定地点时才能刷怪，如果对地图不了解很容易出现跑一圈地图才找到刷怪点的蛋疼情况，而通关评价还跟通关时间挂钩......

The most medicore low-effort forgetable game.

Neptunia games live and die off their writing and even though the actual quality is rather debatable Megatagmention hits a very low point. The plot tries to sell its self on its cast trying to save its high school by making a zombie movie using the current sudden zombie outbreak to attract more students. It really, really tries to get into that its so bad its good category and ocassionaly there is a gem, but at all other times its meh.

Graphicaly the game looks exactly like a PSVITA game because that's what it is, and it rather bland forgetable environmen.ts. Enemies in the main campaign are a first for the series but repeat very often, while the multiplayer mode takes enemies from Action Unleashed.

Musically the game is average; some tracks such as the menu theme are above average, and transformation music for Neptune and co. are quite nice, but nothing sticks out compared to the previous mainline game Megadimension, so you won't be hearing anything on the level of 'Will be Venus' or 'Dimension Zero'.

Gamplay wise, this is where this game really shows its lackluster design. Basic hack and slash mechanics are there for all the characters, which can all perform one or two combos each, and can transorm to change up their small moveset slightly. MegaTagmention controls relatively well, combos have weight and moves are satisfying to pull off, however jumping feels very heavy and unnatural, and the double jump timing is very strick. Characters have a dodge technique whcih blasts them across the field at the speed of sound, but feels highly difficult to aim. Besides basic combos, guards and counterattacks also exist, however they can be slightly difficult to activate due to the unoptimised controller layout straight from PSVITA. Characters have 4 special attacks that they can use when their SP Gauge fills up and these can be very useful for crowd control. Characters can bring two allies into battle which can be used via a button combination that can boost attack, defense, restore HP, restore transform gauge or other effects. You'll quickly discover all you need is transofrm gauge recovery and HP recovery.

Your transformation gauge is charged by hitting enemies, and when it is filled to half or more you can transform into the CPU or a more souped up form of your current character that has different combos, different SP moves and is more powerful. It can also be used to perform powerful EXE and Lily attacks (attacks based on your bond with a different character, raises the more you fight with them). EXE attacks however have a severe oversight where they will knock enemies out of their combos, meaning it will do a fraction of the possible damage.

The two characters you chose into battle when they win (or lose) will gain experience and a boost in their Lily Rank plus money and drops, which presents a problem for the short 6-7 hour campaign. Characters that you don't use won't level up meaning that if you want to use them you will have to grind them up, meaning you will keep sticking with your tried and true character combination. This would be more of a problem if the game wasn't so easy. Enemies largely sit around and look pretty, there isn't much variation in big enemies besides hit and dash, and the game doesn't even feature a proper boss until the end of the campaign! Map design is very small and linear, and largely doesn't effect the way you fight foes. Due to the game featuring more then 10 characters in its short-campgin you won't get bored until the end.

Money can be used to buy weapons, patches, and visual accessories at the store to applly to those weapons to give to your characters to buff them making fights easier. Patches and drops can be fused together to make even better patches, and drops you obtain from mission can be used to unlock costumes for your characters. This system is rather basic, but can be fun to play around with. However, buying weapons reinforces using a minimal amount of characters for your playthrough.

From my brief 1 hour experience with multplayer, enemies from Action Unleashed are back providing much needed variety and 6 big proper bosses that should of been in the main story, alongside a use for your much stronger weapons. Multiplayer gets rid of allies, Lily attacks, and bring two characters in exchange to work together with 3 other players, being able to freely revieve them, and to use a character pre-transormed or that one in the base form unable to tranasofmr. Due to the higher difficultly, better play is required but not too much. I had no connection issues, and the communicatioon menu provided gives a wide range of options to say phrases that translate to other languages well. 

In closing, MegaTagmention Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies is a medicore hack and slash game that doesn't feature anything noticable of interesting. It plays perfectly fine with some minor quips with controls and physics, but the story is very, very weak, with few funny moments typical of Neptunia games. Idea Factory and Compile Heart have showed they can make quality games with the release of Megadimension Neptunia VII, but they haven't followed through with their efforts with spin-off games. Skip this unless you are a big Neptunia wee-I mean fan AND only if it is on sale.

Not a lot of enemy variety, not much of a story, the maps arent very big, the combo system is pretty easy to master.

But there are some differences between those two games. MegaTagmension has a bigger selection of characters than Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. The combat also feels faster which made this as a Hack and Slay a lot more enjoyable. The quests you do don't just take place on a big stage anymore where you have to defeat a bunch of enemies but rather on a bigger area where the enemies are sometimes scattered throughout said area. But this only applies sometimes to even rarely. Most of the enemies spawn at the same spot as you do and most of the quests can be done on this said spot. Most of the quests take place on bigger areas but most of them don't use them effectively as you only have to fight your way through the enemies at one spot. Because of this most of the quests can be done in under one minute, which also feels kinda odd when they are giving you a time limit of 30-60 minutes. Also there isn't much variety of the enemy types you are going to face. The enemies you fight at the beginning are also the ones you are going to face throughout the entire game. This also applies to all of the bosses except for the final one of course. If you get the hang of these bosses you will most likely get bored to face the same bosses over and over again. On a positive note. All of the characters you are able to play feel different and you will most likely find one that suits your playstyle best. But there is also one problem with leveling those characters. You unlock more characters as you make your way through the story of this game. The problem with that is that all the characters that join your party at a later point are at a very low level and you either have to grind with them first to use them on the current quest you have to do effectively or just ditch them and stick with the characters you used up to this point. Also the amount of EXP you get for each quest isn't as high as it used to be in Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. It feels like you don't get enough EXP for each quest. To level up even once you have to do the same quest multiple times. So if you want to beat the story as fast as you can it may be best to stick with the characters you get at the beginning. The last point I'm going to talk about is the story. The story is enjoyable but it's not very good. To keep it short. Blanc and her friend are trying to make a movie to save their school. While they're filming a zombie virus is spreading all over their school and they have to take care of that. That's all you need to know for now. All the characters behave the way you expect them to behave and the setting is pretty refreshing for a Neptunia game. After you beat the story there isn't much to do anymore. You don't unlock additional quests or challenges. You can only play through the story missions again.

In conlusion the game is best suited for you if you are fan of the Neptunia franchise and enjoyed Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. The dialogue is pretty funny and the game uses original music aswell as music from previous installments. The game has it's flaws but it is also very enjoyable.

首先吐槽下剧情，各种莫名其妙，不过看在偏无厘头风格，这点就算了。
然后吐槽战斗，布兰是主角啊。。为什么那么难用。。那个5000连击的成就谁设置的，出来我保证打不死他，断连击好几次总算做成了。还有一些图，怪物的生成地点根本没有提示，于是我绕着地图转两三圈怪物才生成，简直有毒。
在幕后事件方面我觉得还不错，小故事都挺有意思的，还好不要求百合度不然我得刷吐血，这点给个好评。
全对话这个谁设置的我也要打死他，我是看着攻略表格解锁的，为什么同一章节同样的对话仅仅换了个人我就得再打两遍，尤其是整个第六章打了三遍，简直绝望，刷这个花掉我三四个小时，这还是在通关能开启秘技的情况下刷的。
技能点方面也很坑，主用涅普，升到99级发现还有几个地方不够升级的，而技能点已经无法再获得了。不过后来似乎触发了奇怪的bug，每个人都再拿到了5w多点，虽然是良性bug，但也得差评。
在角色数值方面，似乎伤害与防御是呈线性关系的？满级防御打后面的boss几乎不掉血。。。这样有点没意思啊。。
一些boss的走位相当风骚，尤其是兽型boss，刚玩的时候虐得要死要活的，各种空大，不过，大招不就是用来空的吗？（笑）
联机的话，也算是比较好评的，似乎怪物血量有翻倍，一般来说就是大神带萌新，有幸被大佬带过，也带过萌新，这个体验还是不错的。
联机任务刷黑历史就有点烦了，尤其是打Dark Purple/white拿宝物材料的时候，刷了十数次才爆出素材，达成全成就。要是不看攻略只凭自己摸索的话不知要猴年马月才能凑齐。。。
服装大大的好评，历代海王星都是这点让我喜欢，收集那么久的材料正是为了换装嘛。变身装的话。。我一律选择破碎装，嘿嘿。

  上手度很好，无论是从主机还是到PSP全系列优化做的都很到位，操作手感、特效和打击感等介于刀剑神域与无双之间，但缺点还是有的，很少但很让人在意的说；不错，就是镜头问题，相较于U的全自动化调节，激次元的设定比较反人类，战斗时的视角调节可以说是无双类游戏的命脉之一，视角需要自己手动调节、虽说有锁定敌人这么一说，但使用键盘的玩家就会相较于手柄玩家更吃力一些了。[spoiler] 小声告诉你，联机模式的特殊任务里竟然还有个小的跳台关卡~哈哈哈，想SSS？玩的时候强烈建议带一个有跳跃远程攻击+目标锁定跟踪的优妮及拉姆、罗姆[strike] （蕾姆？雾）	[/strike]吧。	[/spoiler]

Oyunun controller ile oynanmasını şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum, klavyede oynarsanız oyun gerçekten bir işkenceye dönüşebilir.

Multiplayer modda 4 kişiye kadar birlikte oynayabiliyorsunuz, odanıza şifre koyabiliyorsunuz.

Multiplayer'daki günlük görev sistemi gerçekten hoş, oyuncuyu oyuna bağlayacak şekilde önemli itemler ve bol para veriyor.

Oyunun hem ingilizce hem japonca seslendirmeleri bulunuyor ve iki dilde de seslendirmeler gayet kaliteli (ingilizce seslendirmede ki Ram&Rom hariç ama bu benim görüşüm)

Oyunda gerçekten çok fazla karakter var ve bu karakterlerin transformlarını multiplayer da her karakter 1 level olsa bile seçebiliyoruz ama story mode da seçmek için story mode'u bitirmek gerekiyor ama oyun içinde transform olarak kullanabiliyoruz belirli bir süre için.

Biraz klişe bir hikayesi var, zombilere zombi demek imkansız ama oyun ""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things"" benzeri bir formatta olduğu için beni rahatsız etmedi.

Oyunda bölümleri oynayarak düşürdüğümüz Fragment'lerle kutuları açıp karakterler için kıyafetler elde edebiliyoruz, bütün kutuları açıcam diye ciddi ciddi uğraştım.

前作U试水之后，地雷社得到的回馈和经验统统在这一做得到了体现——除了镜头距离无法调节以外和删除了爆衣系统外，各方面都相对于U有了极大的提升。难度虽然相对于U来说有不小的提升，但对稍微有动作游戏基础的玩家来说难度还是偏低，因此大可不必看数据选择自己喜欢的或者玩着爽的角色玩，个人推荐布兰、电击子和tamsoft。

布兰在U和VS里的动作不像正传里显得僵硬，女神化后更是十分的霸气，Lowee三女神的bgm也是四国里最燃的，因此即使不是[strike] 任豚[/strike]布兰粉也会玩的十分爽快；电击子依旧是空中连段最bug的存在，这一作居然一次滞空能两次空中连段，当然地面的连段也相较许多角色实用，技能十分的危险——包括了炮姐的弹硬币和夏娜的贽殿遮那，大招居然调出了SAO的UI和桐人的剑，如果哪天这游戏因版权问题下架了，那都是电击子的锅；tamsoft以自己为原型做出来的角色，不得不说十分偏心，设定巨乳，声优小清水美亚，武器太刀，招式居合，HDD化的武士盔甲和两本杂志的动物化鲜明对比，隐藏三连居合连段更是炫炸了，当然也有太脆和硬直太大的缺点，三连居合第二连不但难搓而且一旦失败中断连段硬直超大，上手难度比较高。

boss方面比较偷懒，虽然有八个，但是全部招式简单，配音敷衍，三个机器人丑的一匹，大鸟攻击模式完全就是羊库库，也就剧情里的那只双面人能看，掉落宝箱碎片和部件套装概率太低，好在难度不高可以单独刷联机任务[strike] 刷着刷着感觉自己像孤独之心[/strike]",1510937215,1510937215,True,1,2,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

SO MANY WAIFUS TO CHOOSE
A decent shop to buy stuff from
A nice level system to upgrade ATK DEF HP and learn new moves
Decent replayability with the treasure to collect.
Weekly missions
Many cloths to wear
Epic boss battles

Cons:
Shitty campaign
Really fast combo meter so it’s hard to keep
Shop could have more items IMO
The full price 30 is way too much!( that's why I got it on sale 40% off)

A lot of things, actually. While the main series are RPG games this one is just a button mashing Hack ‘n Slash game in which your character is placed in an arena and need to defeat hordes of enemies. Some of the arenas are just circles and others have a few corridors leading to some open areas but there isn’t anything to explore at all. Just go after the zombies and that’s it. While at the first glance the combat system seems to be somewhat interesting in the end you will end up only spamming the same moves over and over again because the game doesn’t really encourage you to change combos and try something new. Just spam the moves you think are more powerful and that’s it. That said, the game gets repetitive fast and the story doesn’t help much. While some of the dialogues are actually fun the whole thing isn’t something that make you want to pay attention because it is actually poor. The game, just like in the original series, works with the level up system but now this time you actually need to distribute the points in the attributes you want to upgrade the most. And well… the balancing of this thing isn’t really good since if you just spend all your points and max out the defense attribute your character will be almost immune to damage, something that is a game breaking feature that should not exist outside the cheats (that you unlock after beating the game) That said you can make this game be painfully easy, just making things even more boring. Just like in the main games there's an item shop where you can buy new weapons and well… just buy the strongest one and that’s it. You don’t really need to plan anything since in this game, unlike in the main series, the weapon you wield don’t really changes your combos in any way. If there’s something in this game that I think it was a nice addition to the series is the customization. At the same time it is a bit too simple the game allows to resize the accessories and place them wherever the heck you wish. Like, literally. If you, for whatever reason, want to place a wrist watch inside the character's head, you can. If you want to shove something into their buttholes, you can also do that. If you want your character to have a giant hat flying upon their head, take a guess. YOU CAN! You can even pretend to be in TF2 and make a towering pillar of hats. But the customization isn’t only limited to accessories, you can also unlock different variations of the characters main outfit and, if you want, you can also use a torn-up version of their main set of clothing so they will fit more to the zombie apocalypse scenario. (We all know you will actually make your characters wear that for other reasons) The graphics are ok when it comes to the playable characters but the scenery is way too bland. Ahh, whatever, nobody plays Neptunia games for the graphics anyway. The soundtrack is mediocre at the best, you might just want to put something else to play on Spotify. There aren't many glitches to mention but one thing that is annoying is that the game sometimes stop working when you boot it up on full screen. I really recommend you to play the game in windowed mode so this problem won’t annoy you.
In an overall this is just a mediocre Hack ‘n Slash game that can only please Neptunia fans since it features a lot of different characters from different games and if you don’t even know who they are I don’t really think you’ll enjoy the game at all.

Then felt rather disappointed when I started seeing the content of games like Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed or Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart. I felt like all they had to deliver was either over the top fanservice, which I'm not really okay with, in the series (I don't mind fanservice as long as it's not over the top, in this case) and... I don't think that having a tsundere character as a protagonist is a good idea. I feel like there's little to go with. And I really love Noire as a character. But like... particularly with Neptunia U. The way I see it is the following: ""Ripping clothes in combat? Really? What am I playing? A Hyperdimension Neptunia game or a Senran Kagura game?""
What I can say is that my view on the Neptunia side games I'm aware of changed when I heard, saw and played MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies. This game ACTUALLY has something more to deliver, even if it's not much.
The game was released in 2015 in Japan and at the time, only for the PS Vita. Then a year later in North America and Europe. And got its Steam release that same year, in October 3rd.
[b] The story [/b] **SPOILERS AHEAD**: [spoiler] In order to learn more about humans, Neptune and the other CPUs have been attending classes, at Gamicademi. Neptune, Noire, Vert and Blanc are seniors, with Vert and Noire being the Student Council President and Vice President, Nepgear and Uni being juniors and Rom and Ram are in Elementary school. At this point in the story, Gamicademi is under the threat of being closed, due to birth rates being declined. Neptune, being the academy's Film Club president and wanting to save the school, she decides do make a zombie movie to submit it for a contest, along with the help of Blanc's sisters, Rom and Ram. While filming a scene for the movie, Blanc spots them and thinks they are being attacked by actual zombies, intervening and beating the crap out of them. After that, she is told of what's really going on and is asked by Neptune and her sisters to work with them, declining at first but then agreeing to work with them as long as she's the director and she's the one writing the script. What they didn't realize is that they accidentally summoned actual zombies into their world. Seeing as an opportunity to shoot scenes, Blanc takes advantage of the situation to help everyone saving the school and make the movie. Problem is, they don't have enough people to make the club official, so their activity is not exactly allowed by Vert and Noire. That is until they get more people to join them. Tamsoft, a fellow senior, agrees to work with them and enter the movie. And later on, so do two others, Dengekiko and Famitsu, the two Gamicademy reporters from the junior class, who have a rather lively rivalry towards each other. With enough people working with them, they decide to go Vert and Noire again to make the Film Club official, which Vert allows and decides to join them too, but Noire still doesn't really support the idea, not showing much faith in them and not wanting them to make themselves look bad. Later on in the game, Blanc finds a video on the internet which pretty much was the reason why Noire didn't want them to go through with the movie, as it's really embarrassing to her. She then joins Blanc and the others as long as Blanc keeps quiet about it. A few scenes later (the chapters are called scenes), they finish the movie and submit it. Though this isn't where it ends, as there's still the zombie problem to deal with. Though seeing as there are still zombies in the academy, Blanc takes the chance to write a sequel to her rather random movie, though her and the others start wondering about getting more people for the movie. Later on, Uzume arrives at Gamicademy as a transfer student and looking for the source of all the zombies, being later revealed to be an entity known as HachimaJin. With the purpose of her presence being made known, Uzume joins Blanc and the others to film the 2nd movie and to search for HachimaJin. But Blanc is still looking for more people since only one more person isn't enough. Neptune gets Plutia, another fellow senior whom is punishing a bully in her rather infamous HDD form when she is introduced. Rom and Ram get Peashy, whom is also in their elementary class. Now with enough people, they continue working on the movie while searching for HachimaJin's whereabouts. After being almost done, they realize that there's only one place where they haven't looked. A classroom which, according to Vert, shouldn't exist. The girls decide to go there to conduct their search and shoot the final scene. That's when HachimaJin shows up to them. The girls eventually defeat the entity and with that, they also finish the movie and things slowly go back to normal. Sometime later, they finish the editing of the 2nd movie, though they keep it to themselves as a memory. On that same day, they also get the contest's results, which gets a place in the honorable mentions. [/spoiler]
The story in itself... is nothing really special. It's not something memorable, but not something forgettable either, taking around 19-21 hours to complete.
[b] The gameplay [/b]: If you've played Neptunia U or some of the Senran Kagura games, you won't spot that many differences. If you didn't, then here's how it is. Unlike the main Hyperdimension Neptunia games, this game is pretty much a hack and slash. You have a total of 14 different characters to play as which are unlocked as you progress through the story and their transformed forms make it a total of 28 characters, which you get after you beat the story. Each with their own style of gameplay and special moves, some requiring more dexterity than others. But once you get the hang of their combos, the gameplay turns out to be what's probably the best part of the game. Though don't get used to having every action assigned to a single button press. Certain actions require small button combinations, so read the tutorials carefully.
This is also the very first Neptunia game to feature Multiplayer. Co-op, in this case. So if you got three more friends with the game, gather round, set up a room and have fun. It's worth it if you're hunting collectibles, which unlock mostly just outfits for the characters.
[b] The graphics [/b]: For a port of the PS Vita, I'd say the graphics look rather decent. It retains the art style that has always been used for the series and I never really encountered any graphical glitches in the game.
Lastly, I should mention the sountrack, which is a mixed bag. Not in a bad sense, though. While it re-uses tracks from previous games, MegaTagmension also has a few tracks of its own. But nevertheless, the music is always really enjoyable.
So with that taken care of, it's time for the final score. Which, in my opinion, is a 6/10. It's slightly above average. I honestly wish I could give this game a higher score, but I can't. One aspect cannot carry the whole game on its own, no matter how good the gameplay is. While the graphics are decent, those don't make the game perfect. And the story could be a lot more memorable than it is. Even so, that shouldn't be a reason to not grab this game. If you're able to, get it and give it a shot. You won't regret it!",1506898061,1511389817,True,3,2,0.558823525905609131,8,False,True,False,False,,,

Lembrando que nessa análise, comparações diretas serão feitas ao seu sucessor espiritual, o NeptuniaU.

     O jogo começa com a Blanc(que agora é a protagonista) falando que nessa dimensão, as deusas que eram muito próximas aos humanos decidiram ir à escola saber mais sobre a cultura humana. E também fala que a academia iria fechar por conta da baixa natalidade, causando a falta de alunos. Após isso, corta pra uma cena na qual as 4 deusas estão juntas e a Vert, que é a presidente do conselho estudantil, falando que a Gamicademi(a escola delas) fecharia no final do ano, a Neptune fala que o jogo acabou de começar e que ela não iria desistir. Inicia-se então o capítulo 1, que começa com a blanc na parte de fora da escola, lendo um livro, até que que ela ouve gritos de suas irmãs. Ela vai ver oque é elas estão sendo atacadas por zumbis, ai começa-se a primeira batalha que serve mais como um tutorial. Enfim, após a Blanc meter a mão na cara dos zumbis, a Ram pergunta porque ela fez aquilo e a Rom pergunta se os zumbis, que na verdade eram alunos vestidos estavam bem, Blanc ja não estava entendendo nada, mas aí Nep chega e explica pra ela que elas estavam fazendo um filme para salvar a escola e pede ajuda da Blanc...ela recusa, mas a Nep consegue convencer ela, dizendo que ela escreveria e dirigiria o filme. Após isso, começa o capítulo 2, que começa com elas em uma sala e a Nep apresentando os membros do clube, que são...ela mesmo, a nepgear, a Rom e a Ram, e a Blanc...que seria o quinto membro, ela vê que oque a Neptune tinha feito até agora era só colocar coisas aleatórias  e decide reescrever todo o filme, após um pouco de conversa, a Tamsoft, nova personagem...entra na sala perguntando se elas estão gravando e que tem zumbis la fora, elas dizem que não e vão ver os supostos zumbis, ela percebem que são zumbis de verdade e a Blanc tem a ideia de usar esses zumbis na gravação buscando deixar o filme mais realista, e é aí que o jogo realmente começa, com os objetivos de fazer o filme, salvar a escola e descobri porque os zumbis estavam ali.

     Bom, a história assim como a do NeptuniaU não é das melhores, mas a desse jogo é um pouco melhor, oque eu ja esperava ja que esse não é realmente o foco do jogo. E vale lembrar que ela se passa em dois momentos, um deles é elas interagindo e conversando e a outra seria a gravação do filme, com elas atuando.

     Mas agora vamos ao que realmente interessa, o jogo em si. E a primeira coisa a se falar é sobre os movimentos do jogo, esses que foram acrescentados alguns em relação ao outro jogo, nos podemos correr, alternar entre ataques fortes e fracos, dar um ""dash"", pular, usar skills e skills especiais,trocar de personagens na batalha, travar a mira no inimigo(esse que também serve pra mostrar a vida dele), defender, usar um suporte(esse que eu falerei depois), usar itens, além de se transformar. No jogo assim como no NeptuniaU você escolhe uma missão(as missões irregulares foram retiradas) e nela você pode escolher 2 personagens, mas agora são 14 personagens e mais suas formas transformadas(você pode transformar normalmente, mas com isso você pode começar com elas transformadas), essas que são liberadas após o zeramento, cada uma com suas respectivas individualidades, e outra...o jogo agora não te obriga a jogar com todas as personagens, ja que o jogo não faz você jogar determinadas fases com determinadas personagens, você pode jogar todas as fases com sua personagem favorita sou a com a personagem que você joga melhor, que é oque eu aconselho, eu por exemplo joguei a maior parte das missões com a Tamsoft. Ah! E aquele negócio de rasgar a roupa quando leva dano também foi retirado D:, é uma pena.

E agora, falando sobre os personagens de suporte, esses que são paralelos aos que você usa nas batalhas, agora você pode usar eles para ganhar perks durante as batalhas(como ataque, defesa, ou etc), você pode escolher 2 deles. Os cenários do jogo melhoraram se comparado ao seu antecessor, mas eles estão em menos quantidades, pelo menos na campanha, são escolas, cidades, florestas...mas não é possível  visualizar muitos detalhes ja que basicamente você não vai se movimentar muito nele, ja que você vai ficar basicamente em um lugar matando os monstros.

No menu do jogo, a Blanc fica do lado interagindo com oque você vai selecionando lá, caso você não faça nada, ela vai ficando entediada(bem legal kkk). No menu temos o ""Action"", que serve basicamente pra você jogar a campanha, ""Setup"" que serve pra você equipar os itens, mas aqui temos algumas mudanças, primeiramente nas armas, que agora você pode equipar um ""perks"" nela(como mais ataque, mais vida pra você, etc), a customização do jogo é a melhor da série, agora além de mudara a cor do cabelo e roupa(com itens que você ganha), você pode equipar acessórios, esses que podem colocados aonde você quiser na personagem...você pode colocar um chapéu no pé da personagem por exemplo, se você quiser, no Setup você ainda pode equipar as dark parts, essas que você ganha no multiplayer e também usar pontos de atributos para fortalecer as personagens, você pode distribuir os pontos em Vida, Ataque, Defesa e Técnica, essa que serve pra você desbloquear novos combos, pois nem todos são liberados no inicio do jogo(essa árvore que eu aconselho mais você investir), no menu ainda pode-se acessar a opção ""Treasure"", um Tesouro, que serve como aquelas moedas do jogo passado, também tem o ""Shop"", a loja do jogo...lá você pode comprar itens(armas, itens de fortalecimentos e aqueles perks das armas), vender itens e tbm fundir itens, que serve também para aqueles perks de armas, finalizando sobre o menu, você pode ir em ""Config"", configurações do jogo e ""Exit"" pra sair do jogo.

Aquele negócio de Lily Rank, continua aqui que serve para aqueles skills de dupla. A campanha ta bem curta, em cerca de 8 a 10h você pode finaliza-la, mas ela tem uma coisa especial...você pode mudar algumas personagens de algumas cutsceenes no jogo, em algumas fases se você colocar determinadas personagens na party, por exemplo, em uma parte do jogo, no filme que elas estão gravando, vai aparecer uma policial...que é a Uzume, mas, se você colocar na fase 8-1 a Uni e a Vert, essa policial vai ser a Uni...bem legal. Nesse jogo assim como no outro está REPLETO de loadings...loadings pra tudo que se faz...e também tem aquelas informações, que dessa vez em vez de informações sobre a personagem em si, vem informações sobre o gameplay com ela, se ela é rápida, se ela é lenta, etc, etc.

E finalmente falando sobre o diferencial do jogo, o multiplayer...esse que pode ser jogado em até 4 pessoas, e ele tem algumas diferenças da campanha normal...aki você tem que derrotar os ""grandes chefes"", esses que não encontrados na campanha, com o objetivo de encontrar aquelas dark parts, e além disso não é somente esse o conteúdo exclusivo do multiplayer, temos novos mapas, inimigos e etc, e além disso é mais dificultado, ja que vocês tão em grupo. Vocês ainda tem o lobby na qual serve como um Menu. O único problema, é não ter um chat, a única coisa que tem é uma espécie de mensagens pré-selecionadas na qual você pode mandar mensagens do tipo ""Bom trabalho!"" ou ""Sim"", ""Não"",""vamos mais uma!"", mas como são muitas mensagens, não tem muitos problemas de comunicação...mas seria melhor um chat mesmo. Sobre bugs, o único que realmente deu foi o jogo crashar.

MegaTagmension Blanc+Neptunia vs Zombies é mais um ótimo jogo, e mais um bom spin-off da série, com a oportunidade de multiplayer que deixou o jogo é melhor, e que pode não ter uma história muito boa mas isso não atrapalha no jogo.

This story is talking about Blanc. She wants to be famous so she joins Neptune's film club and become scripter and director. Their school nearly closed. They want to make something to protect their school. Therefore, they are making a zombie film.
The plot is good. especially [b]Magical Noirina [/b]
I love Blanc and his sisters.
The game is easy. However, I think the recovery time of Blanc is quite long. Well, she is using a heavy hammer.
The loading time is reallllllllly long.
The default camera position is quite weird. It is not a big deal though.

Multiplayer is a different mode then story. It carries over what you get in story but its a different menu selection with new maps. Its a little slower with people then soloing it as enemys scale. You must wait for host to pick quest and everyone to rdy up. But you have lots of fun voice recordings to spam in that time. Then wait for people's potato computers to load. Then there are a few bugs when people leave. Its a good start for future games. Not the best or even good multiplayer but its neet to play with others. Prob best to play with a friend but not needed.

Le jeu est bien moins intuitif que d'ordinaire et certaines commandes ont disparues (comme le panneau qui donnait les touches à faire pour lancer les différentes attaques spéciales en cours de combat)

Les maps sont plus grandes et surtout plus vides que jamais, dommages.

Moins de plaisir de destruction massive car les ennemis sont beaucoup moins nombreux que dans Action U.

Le gameplay est plus nerveux qu'avant (surtout avec Uni), on dash dans tous les sens, on vole comme des furies, toutefois les enchainements sont moins faciles à mettre en place, vous êtes vulnérable quand vous les faites, il y a un temps d'animation maintenant ce qui rajoute de la difficulté mais qui retire un peu au plaisir de jeu selon moi. 

Enfin ils ont ajouté une commande pour bloquer les coups, merci.

Le gameplay a perdu un peu de son charme même si il s'est étoffé un peu, je pense qu'il mérite encore quelques ajustements avant d'avoir vraiment LA bonne recette.

En ce qui concerne l'histoire : elle est très bonne, très drôle comme toujours, mais avec une durée de vie pitoyable pour un HN même si la rejouabilité est bien là, je n'apprécie pas la méthode utilisée qui consiste à refaire l'histoire à tour de rôle avec les autres personnages pour débloquer les scènes inédites, tout comme monter le lily rank vu le nombre de personnage c'est juste du farm no brain top long et bourratif, surtout que je m'étais déjà bien embêté sur celui d'avant pour le lily rank alors refaire ça ici non merci ça suffit les conneries.

This time ""for some reason"" the goddesses are highschool students.

That reason being, schoolgirl outfits I'm sure... And in this school, there is a film club. In previous games Blanc has always been pegged with the trope of being a reader and being a creative writer. So, this outing, which is accredited to her, she is the film club ""writer"" and she narrates the ""story"" but this is not all, the film club is doing an amateur film about Zombies, at the same time as there is an actual Zombie outbreak at their school.

So, the anime-girl-anthropomorphised console wars have done a spin off game where they are high school students, who are making a zombie film, at the same time as a zombie outbreak. Simple eh, I don't know why some people may think these games are not accessible!

It pretty much follows as a cookie cutter of Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action unleashed, without the gratuitous ""clothes breaking"", and a couple of new features and tweaks to levelling up.


All this additional stuff is good, but I had way more fun on Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action unleashed. And its down to one very superficial reason, loading times.

It's so slow, I checked it out and its a know issue for the PC version, but I find it frustratingly long, and especially for a game which places you in a fast paced action environment, the change of pace seems obnoxious!

As much as it pains me to ""dislike"" a spin-off game about anime-girl-anthropomorphised console wars, where they are high school students, who are making a zombie film, at the same time as a zombie outbreak.

P.S. I'm quite a big fan of neptunia thus the positve review.

Story
The story is light and easy going, it features the characters going through a sort of ""normal life"" with a bit of zombies, which the zombies are treated almost like a joke, which is sort of fun to watch. But if you are expecting the usual hillarious comedy from the neptunia series, sadly this game doesnt have such a comedic touch. But if you are here see a chance of Blanc being an MC, you have come to the right place

Music
The music for the game is nice, it does fit every scene quite well and I enjoy the music.

Gameplay
For this part, i have to admit, it is horrible. First, the enemy lock on function is broken, it is hard to even lock on an enemy, which means it is hard to hit an enemy without a lock on. But then even so, there is another point, the enemy attack patterns are properly, they look like dummies that just sit there and wait for you to hit. The whole gameplay is sort of repeatative as there is not much diffrence between the enemies which most of the time i just mash ""Y"" for Rom, without using any of the other combos.  The maps are also not fully filled and mostly reused.

Art
Reuse, Reuse, Reuse
A lot of art assets are heavily reused, from the enviroments to enenies. The reuse rate of art assets for the enviroment and the enemies is 10x worse than in usual main series. 

But as for the character wise, the art is quite good as usual, and also you have a pool of accesories to choose from, and customizable on the x,y,z axis of the characters, meaning you can place wherever you like. But i do see complains that the clothes choices are limited compared to its Hack and Slash precessor Neptunia U.

UI
For UI navigation, I have no complains about this, the UI is easily understanble and I can navigate through it with ease.
But compared to the usual neptunia UIs, this game has terrible UI Art Design, The whole UI of the game looks like it came from student project. The Design of the buttons looks a bit plain and bland in my opinion, could have done better.

Overall i would still recommend the game for Neptunia fans, the game has potential, but just too many issues within it.

和上一作U对比的话，手感依旧很迷，动作收招时间严重变长这点很不习惯，怪的攻击性也更强，但至少打怪的逻辑更明显，需要掌握怪的行动适时回避。
但总体来说难度不高，可能取决于使用人物吧。
个人主nep，攻击连段用起来比较上手。其实人物选择就是看哪个用的比较顺，或者就是对角色的爱吧。
出去联机发现nep防比较高，被打基本不是很痛，相对的输出有点低，不知道是不是装备问题。

说起来的话，海王星系列主要不就是看妹子卖萌么=w=
然而问题还是流程太短。主线特殊剧情就是换个角色出演，台词没怎么变，刷起来多少有点无趣。

前作U中，你可以用Uni和Nep守小道（Nep不做描述因为没变过，Uni的攻击在U是有往前飞行的子弹的，只要命中就有伤害和击退。我甚至怀疑她用的不是步枪而是玩具枪。不仅距离神近无比，连个击退都没有。）

+ 战斗时注意右上角，与前作相比，角色的对话不会干扰到视角了，并且为此专门绘制了8位点阵图
+ 所有对话都是有语音的
[spoiler]+ 战斗中对于几位巨乳角色似乎专门做了乳摇特效（奶子！）[/spoiler]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 建模依旧是地雷社风格：没有抗锯齿，没有高清。尤其是Uni的武器，平面感太强以至于怀疑这是块纸板
[spoiler]- 为什么要和谐我们的果衣？？？你设置一个R18不就可以了嘛[/spoiler]
- 与前作U相比，打击感稍差，连招不顺畅
- 这游戏调整分辨率会死机。开关显示器也会导致死机（显示器问题应该是个别）
- 战斗说明有点不明不白的（重申：LB+B换人，我重看3遍教程才发现）
- 这游戏没有真正的暂停，除非你选择摄像机视角（而且有限，不能往上看[spoiler]没有胖次，呸[/spoiler]）

    [*]Если бои в Neptunia U происходят довольно динамично, то тут всё заторможенно так сильно, будто на вашем оружии висит 10ти-тонный груз, но убогость игрового процесса этим не заканчивается: после каждого комбо или скилла вы смотрите длинную анимацию, как главгероиня убирает в ножны меч или принимает боевую стойку. Во время таких анимаций персонаж неуправляем, потому вы тут же получите в рыло. Единственный способ обойти эту фигню - увороты посреди комбо. Мотивация? - Не пи*%ите.
    [*]Камера... Нет, я понимаю, что, как во всяком слэшере, тут вид от третьего лица, потому камера фокусируется со стороны персонажа... НО КАКОГО ХРЕНА В ЭТОЙ ИГРЕ КАМЕРА ФОКУСИРУЕТСЯ НА Ж0ПУ ГЛАВГЕРОИНЬ?! Эту х%№ню ещё и не перенастроить!

Но со скидкой и только для любителей гринда, ибо другого игра предложить не может. И лучше делать это дозированно)

Тут есть два режима игры: режим истории и онлайновый кооператив на 4 игроков, который спокойно проходится соло, если вы forever alone, ну или онлайн мертв (оба варианта на данный момент в силе)).

В отличии от той же нептуны U, тут есть сюжет в сюжетном режиме. Но он такой, кх, никакой. Так что его нет. По сути стори тут это только подготовка к онлайну. По ходу сюжета к вам присоеденяюся новые персонажи, включая 4 новых которых не было в U, но всем, за исключением главного костяка персонажей, уделено настолько мало времени, насколько возможно. 3 новым персам буквально уделено 1-2 минуты в приветствии и всё. Ну ещё 3 сайд ивента, которых тут с натяжкой наберется десяток. И создаётся ощущение, что их ввели тупо ради этих ивентов. 
Сам режим истории разбит на сцены, аля мини-миссии. И под мини я имею в виду, что они очень маленькие. По 1-3 минуты макс. За всё время до платины не было более длинных. И в каком-то смысле это хорошо, т.к. квесты в U были очень унылы и однообразны. Тут тоже, но не такие долгие) Ещё в зависимости от выбранных персонажей, некоторые сценки перед уровнем изменятся. На такие сценки есть по 3 варианта. Но они настолько одинаковые, что буквально отличаются парой слов. Местные сайд-ивенты ""находятся"" таким же способом.
После прохождения сего сюжетного безобразия открывают читы аля ваншот, неуязвимости и т.д. Но они не работают в онлайне, где от них был бы хоть какой то толк. Тут в отличии от нептуны U, после прохождения сюжета в нем ловить совершенно нечего. Разве что уровни для онлайна поднимать.

В плане игры тут есть улучшения: появилось больше кастомизаций, выкинули бессмысленный фан-сервис (хотя его остатки можно найти в гардеробе). В пушки можно вставлять всякие полезные и не очень бафы, количество которых зависит от памяти пух (чем сильнее, тем меньше). Можно выбирать 2 супортов, которые дают небольшие бусты во время квестов, но требуют небольшой перезарядки. Как и в U, нужно играть за 2 персов. Но супорты и второй персонаж недоступны в онлайне. Так же за повышение уровня дают AP, которые нужно раскидывать в 4 стата: Хп, Атака, Защита и Комбо. Последнее открывает новые удары. А теперь о веселом - балансе. Которого нет. Опять. Если все AP за повышение кидать в защиту, то к концу истории вам будут сносить 0 урона. А если ещё вкинуть AP из онлайн режима, то даже финал босс 99 уровня вам ничего не сможет сделать. Ещё появилась возможность использовать предметы, т.к. в отличии от U, лечилки больше не выпадают. Но я за всю игру не воспользовался ни одним предметом. И в онлайне их нельзя использовать, или я просто не понял как)

Насчет онлайна, тут всё просто. Выбрал перса и вперед, проходить квесты на 6 уровнях сложности. Все персонажи открыты сразу, вне зависимости от прохождения сюжета. Есть ежедневные квесты, которые меняются в течении недели, и в воскресенье все сразу с перерывом в 2 часа. 
В отличии от режима истории, где босс по сути всего 1, и то финальный, тут их 15. Правда из них 6 рескинов ( с натяжкой 9). И в этом режиме вы проведете довольно много времени, если захотите выбить ачивки или собрать уникальные шмотки, которые есть только в этом режиме
( у меня ушло 5 часов на стори, и 10 на мульти).

Почему же я рекомендую? Сам не знаю) В отличии от нептуны U, в бланка просто приятнеё играть. Ещё тут довольно клевый ост, не тот который взят из других нептун, а новый. Хотя он по мне не подходит этой игре, уж очень местами он мне напомнил Guilty Gear) И его вполне можно слушать в отрыве от игры.",1490292458,1490349014,True,5,1,0.566412687301635742,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Para quem já jogou o Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed, esse jogo é basicamente igual.
Trata-se de um Action RPG bem simples e normalmente fácil, feito mais pela diversão de ver as personagens fazendo coisas engraçadas do que pelo gameplay em si.
Embora claramente o jogo envolva as personagens dos jogos anteriores do Neptunia, a história contada não tem nada a ver com o que aconteceu anteriormente. É realmente uma ""dimensão diferente"". Tem que ter um motivo ""bom"" pra reaproveitar as personagens que os fãs tanto amam né...

Pontos positivos:
- Para quem é fã da série, a narrativa é muito engraçada, mais do que costuma ser!
- Sistema de batalha melhorado em relação ao Neptunia U;
- Os acessórios podem ser customizados (alterar tamanho em todas as dimensões e o posicionamento no corpo);
- Cutscenes especiais em alguns pontos específicos dependendo dos personagens que você leva na equipe;
- Modo multiplayer online MTO bacana;
- Uniformes escolares;
- Plutia ♥♥♥;
- Magical Noirina auhuahuahuahuhaauh

Pontos negativos:
- História completamente random, simplista e tão zuada, mas tão zuada que pra não ficar insuportável a Neptune precisa zuar a história do jogo o jogo inteiro;
- A personagem principal é a Blanc e ELA NÃO FICA ABSURDAMENTE P*TA EM MOMENTO NENHUM DO JOGO... para um jogo com ela de personagem principal eu esperava uma enchurrada de insultos e palavrões...
- A personagem nova (Tamsoft), além de ser totalmente sem importância, parece uma periguete BR que não sabe se maquiar;
- As opções de missão são: ""Mate todos os monstros"" ou ""Mate o Boss""... só;
- Não deram qualquer desenvolvimento à história do Boss, mesmo a história toda girando em torno dele...

Ou seja, embora o jogo seja divertido de jogar e engraçado de acompanhar, devo reconhecer que é um dos games mais fraquinhos da série, sendo salvo pelo humor e pelo modo multiplayer online.

Se você é muito FÃ da série e o jogo tiver com uma boa promoção, RECOMENDO comprar, você provavelmente não vai ser arrepender.

Pros:
Same style of combat to Nep U albeit with a few changes to how certain moves are pulled off
Great 4th wall breaking story we have all come to love from the Neptunia franchise
More characters than Nep U
Hours of content

Cons:
many models are reused from Nep U
Soundtrack is mostly reused tracks from other Nep games(but what is new is of a high standard)
(For some people) It is a game heavly reliant on grinding so that may put some people off

I would definite recommend this but would suggest getting this when it is on sale as the price tag may be a bit too much as though it has plenty of content, it has nowhere near as much as main series Nep games.

Как и Hyperdimension Neptunia Action U, эта игра является слешером. Вот только, к сожалению, создать Action U 2 разработчикам не удалось.
Плюсы: 
-какая-никакая, а история. Хотя движется она и в основном за счет ввода новых персонажей.
-улучшенные опции кастомизации, включая возможность раскидывать очки развития по характеристикам.
-оригинальный контент в виде уровней и монстров, а так же нового персонажа - Тамсофт.
-более тактические бои и правка баланса (""юлы"" непки или непгиа больше нет).
-персонажи из виктори и виктори-2: Пише, Плутия и Удзуме. Только появляются они довольно поздно.
Минусы:
-убрали раздевание из Action U.
-бои стали менее мясными.
-новые арены радуют, но повторяются больше старых, а новая возможность (прыгать по пузырькам) плохо проработана и встречается лишь раз.
-в эндинге представлена куда более интересная версия игры про Бланк (а эта игра посвящена ей), и куда более, ну, ""про Бланк"". Сама игра, не смотря на название, игрой про Бланк является с натяжкой, особенно по сравнению с игрой Нуар.
Отдельно следует отметить мультиплеер (впервые в непках!). Он куда более адекватен геймплейно, чем синглплеер, но контента в нем ровно на одинь день серьезной игры.

Game mechanics are pretty simple but great. You just need to mash the buttons to win but must still defend and run away from enemies if needed so there's stil some tactical gameplay going on despite being minute,

Characters and humar are the best selling point of the game. If you've played Nep games before you'll no longer need to understand anything because... welll... Neptune. For those who are new to the series there game is absolutely great is you want a hack and slash game. Missions are too short however to my liking, I finish some missions in under ten seconds so for people who are looking for a challenge this is not the game for you.

It's not really a bad game, just completely different than what I was imagining/hoping for. :(

They did improve a few points, though, so I'll say a few things I think they did better and worse and stuff.
First, the better: [list]
[*] I liked the added customization options for the characters (the accesories, mostly) and weapons, it was a pretty cool addition to be able to make them feel more personal.
[*] The support characters are pretty cool and add some more options.
[*] Multiplayer is a cool idea (I haven't personally tried it myself yet)
[/list]
Neutral? (I guess):[list]
[*] The leveling system/skill upgrades are kind of cool, but with the normal combos requiring certain levels of upgrading to fully perform, it's part of combat's clunkiness (mentioned more later)
[*] The story and missions aren't very coherent, but it's pretty funny and all, so that's fine.
[*] The Clothes Break from U is no longer in, I usually just used sturdy clothes in U once they were unlocked (more family-friendly and all) but it was a cool idea that defense would lower and ability recover rate rose when your clothes broke. [spoiler]And the animations were dang cute, I'll admit.[/spoiler] Now the broken clothes are just one of the outfits.
[/list]
The worse:[list]
[*] The combat is much clunkier, skills are harder to use (need to defend in order to use a skill, so the fluidity is messed up) and no longer customizable (and you can't see which skills you can use like in U, so you have to either memorize them or hope the one you chose works well)
[*] The controls in general don't seem to work as well, in my opinion (I always have to check how to transform and stuff when I come back because it's different than U. And there's items in this that I rarely, if ever, use since it's annoying trying to choose them during battle...
[*] There's a lot of stuff missing that was in U, like equipping different skills and the three stat-changing item slots, etc.

本作的战斗系统仍然是和U一样的无双制（毕竟人家搞出来的新玩法不能玩了一次就扔了啊），但是操作难度有所上升。最主要的表现就是角色的惯性增加，硬直时间加长，闪避不再那么灵活，人物攻击范围也减少了。

同时BOSS战斗力大幅度上升，这代的BOSS也再也不会像U的那些BOSS一样被硬直到死，一般来说BOSS在受到多次攻击后会被击倒一次，持续几秒，这段时间BOSS是没有反抗能力的，但是除此之外，BOSS不会硬直（少数特殊BOSS比如单人的最终BOSS会在使用一些特殊攻击后硬直一段时间，这段时间就是你攻击的最好时间）,同时每个BOSS都有复数的攻击方式（最烦的就是大史莱犬还有那个忘了啥名字的石头人的那种跳在天上的攻击QWQ，还有那个猩猩，不过那个好像不是BOSS），导致BOSS战难度非常大。

我认为本作相比于U一个很大的优点就是音效，人物动作等的优化。虽然我打了60小时，但是因为主要是在用几个单独的人物，所以并没有玩全人物，可能导致这段会有失真，请谅解QWQ。首先在音效方面，音效的真实感加强了，同时也间接加强了打击感，至少对于我比较常用的基雅来说，这作砍怪的时候你每刀砍下去的音效会让你有种砍到肉里面的感觉，而不像U那样“嘟嘟嘟”的砍果冻的感觉。

至于动作，首先，当你的角色被击倒后，一般形态的人在起来时会有一个后空翻的动作，而女神形态则是一个被击退后用手支撑地面的动作。对比U的被击倒后慢慢起来，是不是很有一种高战力人物的感觉？[strike]俗称逼格高[/strike]。同时我很喜欢UNI的那个战术翻滚的动作。我记得不错UNI是生存社还是什么社的成员，这个动作虽然是为了削弱UNI，但是还是让UNI有一种身手敏捷，久经沙场的感觉（UNI酷酷哒~）。

[h1]吐槽[/h1]

[spoiler]剧情继承了海王星系列剧情的特点：萌以及没啥逻辑性（别给我说阿虚QWQ）。

首先你们8个人来上课就把国家放着不管了？就算4国大主教能够治理国家，8个女神全部失踪怎么解释？（不要给我说国民知道8女神是去上课了，如果知道8女神去上课我怀疑这学校完全不可能没人气啊。）

顺便这学校还能正常运作以及居然还有转校生我也只能说这封锁消息的效率有点高.....

不过我最想吐槽的还是......

Conclusion, it's a terrible port. Avoid it if you don't wanna experience a buggy/broken gameplay, even from this. Otherwise, if you're a hardcore fan of the franchise, go nuts.

Edit #1: Giving it a thumbs down doesn't change the fact that it is still a bad port, love you guys for being denial. <3

โดยเนื่อเรื่องเกมนั้น เป็นเนื้อเรื่องใหม่หมด และ ยังรองรับระบบ Multiplayer ด้วย

โดยระบบ Multiplayer นั้น จะเล่นได้ทั้งหมด 4 คนด้วยกัน

ระบบเกมเพลย์ : ถือว่าง่ายมาก ( แนะนำให้ใช้ จอย เล่นนะคับ เพราะถ้าใช้ Keybord อาจจะยากไป)

เราสามารถทำ Combo รัวๆ ได้สบายๆ และ แต่ละด่าน ไม่ยากอีกด้วย 

ระบบ Multiplayer : จะมีภารกิจ ให้ทำ และ มีระบบชุบเพื่อนด้วย ในกรณีเพื่อนล้ม ถือว่า ง่ายมาก

หลังจากตัวผมได้เล่นไปนั้น ถือว่า เล่นเพลินดี และเล่นกับเพื่อนก็ยังสนุก (ถ้ามันมีระบบ PVP ก็ดีละนะ)

เนื่อเรื่องโดยย่อ : เมื่อเหล่า CPU นั้นมาเรียนในโรงเรียนแห่งหนึ่ง และ ต้องการสร้างหนังเกี่ยวกับ Zombie

I know some of the characters from 4.chan /vg/ but as i said i have no real clue who is who. I really looked forward to test this game since i thought to myself that it looked kinda fun - and well a coop mode is something i really enjoy in games nowadays.

The games i normally play are team based FPS games like CS or if we talk about a diffrent genre - the Souls Series (since most RPG´s like TES games are to casual for my taste). Since i am a huge anime fan this game got my attention - but well i never gave it a ""go""

Now lets see how the game plays and feels to someone who never played anything in this genre/universe before.

After i started the game i looked at an intro that had a catchy song „be my zombie“ and introduced me to the characters of this universe - the intro feels a bit like watching a good anime opening - from the quality how its made.

Intro 9/10

The ""main"" menu had a average amount of ingame settings that i could adjust (pretty basic but still all i needed).
rly like the orginal jap voice acting but dunno why i like the english voice actors so much

Settings 7/10

Sine i normally watch animes in english sub - i started the game with the orginal voice acting - that was very fitting to the characters of the game. Still - i switched to the english voice acting mid game and this was very good to.

Voice/Sound 9/10

When i started playing the story mode i got briefed about the story of the game and got small and quick tutorial missions where the player learned the ""basic"" controlls of the game. I had some problems in the beginning tho - i know the Souls Series have pretty bad controlling but this was ""hard"" for me at start (i had problems with the lock on enemy funtion)
Maybe i was just not used to this controll ""scheme"". That was the only thing i did not like about the game but still its about learning (as in the Souls Series) - ""Git Gud?!""
I liked the Story behind the game, but since i don´t know that much about the characters and universe i have to skip this part - i would recommend you reading other reviews below mine - for this part at least.

Controlls 4/10 (if you get used to them i would rate them 6/10
Story 8/10 

About the Art/Visuals of the game i have to say - i really enjoyed the parts where the characters talked to each other - the feeling of reading an manga came in my mind. The 3d ""gameplay visuals were pretty basic - nothing special, nothing bad.

Art 8/10
Visuals 6/10

Well then mid game i tried out the coop part and well this one was very fun - best part of the game for me ( i just love ""jolly cooperation""). You can play the entire story mode with an friend or with a random person online. So no further comment from my side for this part of rating.

Coop 10/10 (i had no connection problems at all - played from EU with NA friend)

I still have to finish the game and well i am looking forward to do this plus all the unlocks you can get for each of characters. 

So Would i recommend this game? Yes

My final rating for MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies will be an 7,5/10 (the controlls part was the part where it could had reached an 8 easy but well as i said thats the only thing i did not enjoyed that much.
I am looking forward to play more games that take place in this ""universe"".

And I kind of hoped, that Blanc+Neptune vs Zombies would be equally as good as Action Unleashed, especially giving the great ratings it got and the similar looking gameplay. Honestly I dont understand why many people say its so great, it is in fact very disappointing. Barely any unlockables or game modes, outfits are only color swaps most of the time and the story is... painfully cheesy, doe that one is intended so it makes it quiet funny.
I will summerize the Pro and Cons for a better overview.

Pro: 
- Full Hyperdimension Neptune cast
- Colorful and funny dialogues like in the other games
- A tiny bit of fan service
- Cheesy as heck, but still very enjoyable
- Co-op mode

Cons:
- Barely any unlockables
- Short story, without much content
- Not able to restart levels
- Characters control like tanks, go down in a few hits doe
- Sooooooooooooo many Looooaaaaaadiiiiiiing screeeeeeeeeeeeens
- Locking onto enemies is weirdly difficult
- Characters are unable to move when hit or untill their move animation is over (like swinging the weapon), 
   making them a very easy target
- Transforming in battle or leveling up makes almost no difference when fighting
- Bulletsponge enemies
- Unlockable outfits only color swaps most of the time

Overall rating from my side: 5/10

If you are a fan of the series and you can find it for like 6 - 10 bucks or so, then get it. It does have funny cringeworthy moments. But if you hope to find the same variety of content or fun like in the other titles, Im afraid you will be disappointed aswell.

It pulls the action-hack-and-slash gameplay off more elegantly and the characters in general feel more balanced. For instance, ranged characters are no longer effectively god mode.

The plot is about what I've come to expect from a Neptunia title: The goddesses attend school to try and understand humans better. There's a zombie outbreak. So they decide to film a zombie movie while resolving the zombie outbreak to advertise the school.

This game includes multiplayer, which is pretty fun and a bit chaotic. It has a Monster Hunter Lite feel, especially with the bigger bosses.

The only honest complaints I have about it is the farming required for some of the Treasure items, which gets repetitive when you only need 1 item that drops from 1 boss and wind up doing that boss 50 times.

This game story is rather interesting. A bunch of goddess going to school and doing a movie. What could possibly go wrong? Nice plot turning, and some peoples might complain about the lack of seriousness, but he? That is what make the Neptunia serie great for me, and if you can't live with it, you are in the wrong fandom.

-The inclusion of Tamsoft and some characters of the main series, which were missing in Action Unleashed, made the fighting more interesting. Sometimes I just find myself button mashing until I find a usefull combo.
-The inclusion of the fan service from the previous Hack n Slash of the serie made it a bit awkward, as I didn't play Action Unleashed before this game, and didn't expect they give the Costume Break as a costume from the start.
-For the Multiplayer, its rather dead but still worth it if you know peoples actually playing the game. Its also a great way to break the main story and raise your character with less grinding (in the case you play online with someone who is farer in the game).

Even if some peoples complain about the gameplay, I find it pretty neat and a good addition to the serie. I recommend this game for peoples of the Fandom, but you can start with this one if you want.

I'm more in the middle but that's for another topic.

Let's get this review out of the way: How did this game came to be you may ask? Simple answer - take Hyperdimesion Neptuina U, give a zombie makeover with a zombie story, add the schoolgirl genre because it wouldn't be Japanese enough right and take everything that made U fun and throw it all away and you get this. A fast paced hack and slash that's quite slow to be honest especially compared to Senran Kagura and Hyperdimension Neptunia U which are much faster paced and are actually fun to play. 

The story is about as ordinary as any zombie based story is: the school is infested with zombies(it's actually a play but who's paying attention to this badly written story)and it's up to the Neptunia Cast to stop them(Loose sense of the word). And that's where all the problems begin - the zombie thing has been done to death(pun intended)by the Western World to the point all you need is zombies and BAM! Instant money(coughcough The Walking Dead coughcough). So the makers of this game(must be on something high)thought they can input their ideas into the genre and added the most cliche thing ever: schoolgirls(because it wouldn't be Japanese if it didn't have them). The game has crashing problems when changing the screen size or just changing the screen to full size which is retarded as hell. The story is a snooze and the shop menu(for buying weapons, why am I telling you this, no idea)doesn't work and does this freezy thing(music plays in the background but you can't see anything!!!)causes a crash where the game sorta hits a freezy moment until you press B(I use a gamepad. Obvious reasons)

They took the one thing that made U slighty more interesting: the clothing break system. Thats bad when you consider it's made by the same people who did U and Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus. Sucks when you think about huh?

Through and through the game isn't as bad as the haters say but it's too far from good like the supporters of the Series say it is. You can definitely find a better game out there, so keep looking and pass on this title.

P:S - I loved Neptunia U and I really wanted to love this one too because I have a love/hate relationship with the Main Series because they're turn-based and I'm not a fan of turn-based combat. But I really can't recommend this even to the diehard fans. If you have to get this game, get it for the PS Vita. You'll thank me by not getting it's crappy PC Port(which seems to be the trend for PC Games made this year: all of them are crappy)

Leveling up and building your character feels great, though i kinda just leveled up one character... by the time i got what i wanted i was already op with nep... in short singleplayer is gud, is fun, gud game. now most people (including me and my friend) saw the coop part of this game and thought. Yes. The coop is, well, not boring, but not the best, if your wondering no you cannot play through the story in coop. Instead you go through a series of missions varying in difficulty. and i have to say... they are really easy, like, wow... though to be honest the whole game easy. connectivity is a problem sometimes to, occasionaly we wont be able to connect to one another for no reason but i didnt expect better. Overall i give it Nep/Nep if you adore the interactions between characters of gamindustri this game is for you, if your looking for a ARPG with coop, this is not the game for you. im not good with reviews, but i enjoyed the game.

В якій дівчата попадають до світу людей і щоб ви думали, вступають в звичайну школу щоб краще пізнати культуру і звичаї людського виду, але стається лихо і школу хочуть закрити за непопулярність, тут нашим героїням приходить в голову зняти кіно-жахастик з зомбі щоб прорекламувати свою школу. Ідея наче хороша, але під час зйомок на школу нападають справжні зомбаки, що стає в пригоді нашим героїням, вони вирішують їх використовувати при зйомках свого фільму =)
Сюжет доволі простий і не надто довгий, але має декілька цікавих поворотів. А головне діалоги справді веселі, Це звісно порівняння, сатира і висміювання, але дуже часто справді влучно =)

Відносно основної серії ігор тут є декілька змін, по-перше геймплейно це не покрокова стратегія, а скоріше слешер. По-друге в грі є мережевий кооператив, ну і звісно головним протагоністом цього разу буде Бланк, хоча Неп йде відразу поруч =)

Графічно гра не отримала ніяких покращень що до інших ігор серії, хоча до переваг можна занести багато нових моделей монстрів, а в цілому все стандартно - доволі скромні локації, і чудові моделі персонажів під час діалогів.

В плані звуку хочеться виділити, що тепер в грі озвучені всі (наче) діалоги, частково це пояснюється меншою кількістю цих самих діалогів, але тим не менше така тенденція не може не тішити. Звісно з нами всі чудові голоси з попередніх ігор, так само як і японські звукові доріжки оригіналу, для фанатів читати субтитри =)

Як я вже казав геймплейно гра є скоріше екшн слешером, в якій ми наносимо швидкі атаки котрі можна, а на пізніших етапах гри навіть потрібно, обєднувати в комбінації для ще сильнішого пошкодження, також є супер атаки котрі можна як виконувати самому, так і в кооперативі з друзями, в цілому геймплей доволі простий для освоєння, і доволі цікавий для експерементування, так як персонажів в грі справді багацько (більше 20-ти) і кожен грає по своєму, що дуже урізноманітнює гру.

В цілому, ця гра не претендує на звання найкращої в серії, але завдяки різноманітності персонажів, і веселим діалогам, як і секретним діалогам зможе заставити пройти себе навіть двічі чи більше, а з друзями в кооперативі стане ще цікавішою.

Toda la profundidad de este título radica en la customización, y su encanto es propio del carisma de la franquicia; Más allá de eso, este juego no es particularmente bueno ni recomendable.

Los escenarios son muy grandes pero carecen de detalle, el combate es tan básico como lo esperable de un Hack'n Slash de Neptunia y los bosses se manejan con patrones muy sencillos de comprender y vencer.

No cuenta con muchos puntos positivos, como ya dije antes una de sus virtudes es el encanto de la franquicia y sus personajes. Ser un juego de Neptunia es su mayor virtud y aunque tampoco lo llamaría un mal juego, amerita la inexistente opción de ""[b]Recomendación Intermedia[/b]"" que a Steam le hace falta.

Going into MegaTagmension (MT) as a newcomer to the Neptunia series, I was thinking that I would be playing some sort of visual novel with hyper-sexualized content under a metaphorical cloak of story progression. Or maybe something with such prolific fan service that I'd have to worry about someone walking in through the door. Little did I know that I was getting myself thrust into a world bathed in 14 different flavors of cuteness. Maybe I've been playing way too many outlandish anime games, but this VN fused with action elements managed to show such a refreshing sense of originality and style that I couldn't help but swoon at its characters. At its core, MT is a fully voiced VN with a little bit of beat em up/hack & slash thrown in, not too dissimilar to the Dynasty Warriors/Musou series. These battle sequences are relatively short and aim to enhance the story's sense of credibility, but ultimately plays a backseat role in expanding Idea Factory’s Neptunia universe.

In this newest release, a small band of girls who seemingly represent their entire academic population are uniting to save their school, Gamicademi, from closing down. In the opening scene, Blanc overhears her sisters being attacked by ghoulish zombies. To her surprise, the zombies are actually actors cast by Neptune in an effort to create a high profile movie with the hopes that it'll be the school's saving grace. Naturally, Blanc decides to join in on the fun and direct the movie herself; however, in a rather ludicrous turn of events real zombies end up getting involved, even if they are neglected between shoots. It is now up to these heavily equipped Powerpuffs to make sure Gamicademi lives to see its grand return to the spotlight.

[h1]MegaTag-Teaming[/h1]

Now saving Gamicademi may be of the utmost importance to Blanc, but some part of me did not allow myself to proceed without first changing all of the girls' outfits to their torn counterparts… Moving on, I began to notice important personalization options other than cute costumes and accessories. Japanese and English voice options are available, to my surprise, helping me solidify my stance to support the original dubbing. For the non-purists out there, the English VAs are actually much better than the average folk employed in domestic dubs, and I even found it to be less cringy and sensual than usual. Either way, I definitely liked the ability to pick audio languages, and feel a need to commend whoever was responsible for that decision. Delving further, MT also lets players have a choice in who they cast for each scene event or fight. This ends up creating ""alternate cuts"" depending on who you cast, as the resulting scene's dialogue and special events system follow your decisions to an extent. This responsibility puts you in Blanc's shoes, creating the story direction of your choosing in a much more immersive manner.

Regarding MT's Warriors/Musou-like combat system, various aspects regarding its design makes it to be the weakest mechanic of the game. Really poor camera tracking impedes fluid movement and makes positioning more difficult than it should be. Worse is when there is a boss around that can fly and perform diving maneuvers, compounding to create a slightly debilitating combat experience. Furthermore, most of these battle sequences will be completed within a handful of minutes, requiring very little variability to overcome. As the game progresses, combat ever so slowly feels like tedious exercises in mindless button mashing. It’s a big shame since advanced maneuvers are incorporated, such as taking advantage of animation cancelling, invincibility frames, or aerial combo strings for evasion, but they aren’t necessary at all to beat the game. MT's tag-team mechanics, plentiful amount of unlockable combos, and visually appealing SP/EXE Drive skills help make up for the combat's grievances and keep these portions slightly enjoyable, just much less than ideal. 

MT’s combat oriented multiplayer aspect seems to be the game’s biggest wow-factor when comparing it to other Nep titles, as MT is the only game so far to contain such a system. The ability to group up with 3 other players online in a mode featuring new enemies, bosses, arenas, and VN events not seen in the campaign, add major play value. There are tons of quests separated by Star difficulty, providing rewards and experience to level up character stats that carry over to the story mode. Also, unlike story mode, the multiplayer aspect unlocks every character and transformation from the beginning for use, along with changing some of the combat controls to incorporate online player joint attacks. Strangely, I found the multiplayer mode really enjoyable, even while playing solo along with the fact that the multiplayer combat system is the same as the story mode’s system. It’s most likely attributed to the lengthier and tougher quest challenges, unimpeded by tiny segments of dialogue. Unfortunately, MT’s multiplayer mode seems to have been plagued with connection issues for many players ever since launch, but since I haven’t seen any such problems myself, the only experience I have in multiplayer is a fairly positive one.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Although the story was a bit absurd, it seems to be what defines the style of the Neptunia games. Plenty of funny jabs at the girls’ own ridiculous situations closely flirt around breaking the fourth wall creating a neat sense of relatability, and Blanc’s “extortion” scheme in obtaining MagiGirl Idol’s support is comically hilarious. What started off strong ended up petering out throughout the second half of the game, as the story essentially kept walking around in circles without introducing any real major changes. A new character here or there with a backstory blended in with something zombie related is the extent of MT’s narrative. It’s a bit of a shame since the game is much shorter than its RPG sister titles; so stretching MT’s story thin is pretty problematic. Worse is the alternating nature of the VN and battle sequences. When you get involved with the VN’s story, you’re forced to fight 2 minute battles, just to watch a 2 minute dialogue and repeat the process (up to four or five times in one scene with multiple loading screens for each transition). It’s hard to get attached to either aspect when the game switches gears so often. 

Regardless, as a casual fan of anime and visual novels, I didn't find the newest installment in the Neptunia series too eccentric to take in, or alienating as an entry point. There weren't too many inside jokes or references, and the iconic song and dance summarizing previous important world aspects is present. After wrapping things up with Blanc and friends, I still found myself wanting to delve more into their world, especially as I only seemed to have observed them in such a confined environment. If you are a long-time Neptunia fan, I’m afraid that my verdict may not be very enlightening or relatable from my perspective. Just know that MT is much, much, shorter than the main series games. But for those that are weary of this as an entry point into the series, I can say that MT seemed to be rather welcoming, and is definitely enjoyable as a VN experience all on its own. There is a desire for improvements in the combat realm, but the multiplayer and VN aspects proved to be commendable enough to make checking out MT, or at least other Neptunia games, rewarding, especially during one of Idea Factory’s deep publisher sales.

So, what is this game? A hack'em slash'em with neptunia characters. HDN:U with Multiplayer. That's the gist of it. It Plays a bit more like Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus than U, as the game will spawn it's enemies only from spawn points close to you, and despawn them if you go too far from them. Unlike the ""Follow the Path"" of SK, or the ""Continue on the only obvious path""/""stay in the small arena killing things until the objective is completed"" of U, most of the time you go on maps hunting for bosses, who are even denoted on your minimap!

Now, for the enemies changed from U:

Aztec Golems have a jump attack, and are more aggressive.
Kupokitties are less hyperactive.
No robot enemies
Zombies that throw their head as boomerangs
""Flying disco zombies"" that shoot hellfire rockets at you, very slowly.
New Large bosses:
-Temdinkale is a one-handed sword fighter with okay mobility and a fun to fight moveset
-Megadonkale is a red dual-wielder with TONS of mobility, a pain to melee, since even his dodges damage you
-Doomkale wields a hammer, is slow as hell, and is badass.
-Undead Cannoneer lugs around two huge guns, and has spectral gauntlets to slap you around with in close range.
-the two Mariwogus-types are large fenrir-type dogs with launchable frisbee weapons, four per doggy. They have high mobility.
-Truenail and it's clone type are big walking birds with a glowy tail ending in a christmas tree light.

Unlike Nep U, you no longer map your skills to specific buttons, but instead always have four skills available.

Like Nep U, and SK, the camera control is abysmal, and needs a specific autohotkey script to be convenient with a mouse.

The multiplayer is a pathetic joke, no real communication (no chat, there is picking up phrases from a phrasebook), no real steam integration, dead game is dead tier lobbies, few games, often someone's either playing with a low-level character who dies in two hits, or a high level murdermachine kitted out in invincibility patches, high def, keep patch, life steal patch, who can steamroll bosses without thinking... Best of all, enemies scale up in HP and Damage with more players, so playing solo mp is easier. Go figure!

And as usual with IF, the game is a buggy wreck. It can lock up when looking for multiplayer servers, it can lock up before the menu, it WILL lock up (not responding) if any application asks for permission to change things in the computer.

The missions are no brainers in story mode, loading times are large.

So all in all I can't wholeheartedly recommend this game. Get it if you are interested in playing with one character or another (I've come for plutia, and you know how she doesn't leave anyone until she's satisfied :D ), get it if it's in the bargain bin, don't get it for full price.

And if you really need some action hack'em slash'em and you haven't played diablo 2 yet, do yourself a favor and get that game. For two thirds of the price you get the base game and the expansion. The ability to play in either classic mode or expansion mode, which are two wholly different experiences. Deep itemization and high amount of character customization allow you to play the way you want (Aside from a few caveats). Battle.net is a wonderful place to be (if you can avoid the bots) and you can even activate the Perfect Gem! (sorry, inside joke)

[*]Le pusieron customizacion [b]totalmente libre[/b] a los personajes, lo cual me dio un buen punto de vista sobre el desarrollamiento del juego. Eso si para este editarlo de manera que te guste como se ve, requieres de un poco de tiempo

[*]La obtencion de eventos y su multiplayer adaptado bien de cierta manera
[*]Para los que amaban el ecchi del U les dejaron las ropas destruidas de ese titulo
[*]Adicion de nuevos personajes de la saga (Sigo esperando uno donde salga mages)
[*]Tiene un nuevo sistema para combatir, muy diferente del U

[*]El UI/menú de pausado durante el juego, este tiende a ser molesto de usar en el juego aunque añade bien el chat durante este
[*]Las partes del dark history sería bueno si las pudiese colocar a mi manera o almenos mezclarlo como en los otros titulos 
[*]Igual que todo hack and slash una vez aprendido el patron de ataque de los enemigos, el juego se vuelve facil... aunque en este a diferencia del U los enemigos no ""avisan"" sus ataques

[最近更新]算起来已经更新了快⑩个版本了吧（或许⑨个？），作为业界公认的萌豚星，能认真平衡游戏这么久也算是用心了吧，可惜全任务完成后后继乏力的问题没有根本上解决。不过这也是游戏题材本身的硬伤，毕竟这一点上单机比不上MMO啊。
话虽如此，诸君，为了你我的waifu，买买买啊！

本作比起U来改变的不是一点点，核心游戏内容不是割草了，连段被限制了，招式和怪物各种梗，增加了LB锁定以后莫名其妙的有了点怪物猎人的味道。
因为不割草了所以难度相对U高了一些，新手以及没有主线RUSH多人的玩家可能会有些不适应，如果觉得打不过还是先左转单人剧情吧。
[h1]单人部分[/h1]
[spoiler]“那些先打多人不管故事的都是什么心态啊，反正……想要白金必须打单人剧情啊”——强迫症晚期玩家
“那些先打多人不管故事的都是什么心态啊，反正……看妹子卖萌果断打单人剧情啊”——绅士玩家[/spoiler]
这次的单人剧情有些无厘头啊= =游戏长度与U没有太大差别，不得不说新次元以后的LIVE2D真是棒极了，剧情嘛又是独立于重生和新次元世界观的，可能是要服务于战斗，显得有些呆板了。
不过瑕不掩玉[strike]有妹子看还瞎BB什么[/strike]还是优秀的。
如之前所言，想快速提升等级最好的办法就是推剧情，强烈推荐新手先进行单人游戏。
[h1]多人[/h1]
本作最大卖点，终于可以和小伙伴一起玩耍[strike]看妹子[/strike]了
[h1]注意，请确保下载时和小伙伴选择了同一地区的服务器！否则无法互联![/h1]
游戏中并没有严重的卡顿现象，体验还是很优秀的。至于其他不再赘述，诸位[spoiler]绅士[/spoiler]自行体验吧。
[h1]怪物[/h1]
总的来讲，这一作你终于不能随心所欲地割草了。
U中后期才出现的肥宅这次贯穿游戏始终，前期攻击力不够想要破除霸体是较难的，[strike]誓死要在极限攻击流一条路上走到黑的[/strike]我被摸两下基本就残了；大众新怪物DQN远程攻击频繁数量又多，原地炮台流可以淡出历史舞台了。具体各位自行体验。
主要说说大怪。
主题怪无比菜鸡，攻击手段贫弱（DIO：ぴんじゃく！ぴんじゃく！）气绝非常容易，屁♂股处全都是破绽……[strike]让人想起了某同样地位的雄火鸡[/strike]
三只机甲个人觉得最难的是双刀的，移动灵活破绽很难找，地面上相对安定的左脚其实也不安全，不过对空安定点很多，各位可以自行摸索。
大剑和大锤各有套路，勤洗脚即可，唯一几个大动作预判好用技能规避掉就是了。
狼的出招变化似乎是最多的，但不同的关卡中攻击方式不同，没什么死角不太好打，恕我无能，除了堆属性刚正面没想到什么办法= =
长的就像只怪鸡的某雌火。IF玩得一手好梗（捂脸）技能基本都是怪猎的那些= =龙车啊吐火球啊空中乱舞啊= =无论有没有怪猎经验，熟手了都不是问题。
最终BOSS给我印象最深的就是他的JOJO立= =伤害都在刀轮上，不要贪刀，角色机动性够就直接贴身猛干。
[h1]原有人物[/h1]
U里就有的人物普遍改动都是一样的，加大了收招后摇，降低了攻击灵活性。[spoiler]老婆[/spoiler]ギア酱变身不能无限转转[strike]键山雏[/strike]了不开心。小天使ロム有了奶，真成牧师了。
当然也有大改，[h1]拉姆·甘道夫[/h1]彻底走上了布大锤第二的不归路，华丽变身近战法爷，还能上BUFF……
[strike]不过也是挺好玩的……[/strike]
[h1]新人物[/h1]
[h1]天王之星·空调うずめ[/h1]
打击感极度强大的角色，主要输出手段是普段蓄力，直拳简单粗暴后摇小伤害还很高，对付大怪很强劲，缺点是普段范围薄弱。
变身小奶音依旧萌，只是伤害不怎么高，所以不推荐变身。感觉这货就是为了多人开发的。
EXE：オラオラオラオラオラオラオラ！！！！！！！！
[h1]TAM·维吉尔[/h1]
当我第一次玩她[spoiler]想歪的全出去面壁[/spoiler]的时候被惊呆了，灵魂剑阎魔刀力量之刃，斯巴达血统太可怕了啊…………
如果玩过鬼泣系列，立马就能看出来技能各种梗。
然而不只是玩梗啊，大攻击范围高伤害，真的很强。
[h1]普露露和皮ko[/h1]
卖萌有余强度不足，不管是哪个世界大锤都对yellow heart充满怨念哈哈哈哈哈awfawkgialjtauitjkajwilt
并不是棍机，虽然普露露真的真的真的真的好萌……

Несмотря на то, что я ставлю палец вверх, я остался недоволен приобретенной игрой. Да, это по прежнему Нептуния, но, покупая игры этой серии, я всегда считал, что обеспечиваю себя геймплеем на 40-80 часов. Эту игру я прошел за 8, выполнив все квесты на максимальный ранг. Еще 11 ушло на фарм уровней, эвентов, предметов и т.д.. И того 19 часов. Игра просто прошлась и забылась, к сожалению. Сюжет у нее понравится далеко не каждому, ибо он изначально слишком комедиен, чтоли. Я бы сказал глуп. Вокруг вроде как реальный зомби апокаллипсис, а они кино снимают... Геймплейно игра тоже проста, что подтверждают те самые 8 часов. Абсолютно никакого челленджа, вы просто берете любого персонажа и идете им по сюжету до конца игры. Вам не придется беспокоиться о способностях, экипировке, пассивных скиллах и прочем.
Тем не менее, почему я рекомендую купить эту игру. Полагаю, раз вы зашли сюда, на страницу седьмой игры серии Hyperdimension Neptunia, вы являетесь поклонником серии. Как мы знаем, иногда, чтобы увидеть Valiant Hearts и Child of Light, нужно купить парочку Ассасинов и Фар Краев. Вот здесь то же самое. Я готов купить порт простенькой игры с портативной консоли, если это ускорит появление новой части теперь уже одной из моих любимых игровых серий.

ระบบภาคนี้จะเป็นการนำภาค U มาปรับปรุงระบบต่างๆ ให้ดีขึ้น (เรียกง่ายๆ คือ Nep U 2.0) ตั้งแต่ระบบการต่อสู้ที่ลื่นไหลขึ้น โหมดเนื้อเรื่องที่ยาวขึ้น(นิดนึง) และเพิ่มโหมด Co-op กับเพื่อนอีก 3 คน ตะลุยเควสล่ามอนเตอร์และบอสในดันเจี้ยนต่างๆ ด้วยตัวละครที่ท่านรัก ในส่วนของเรื่องการอัพเลเวลตัวละครในภาคนี้ ได้เปลี่ยนให้ผู้เล่นอัพค่าพลังต่างๆ ได้ตามใจชอบ ตามที่มีค่า AP เหลืออยู่ ซึ่งจะได้ทุกครั้งเมื่ออัพเลเวล แทนจากการที่เกมอัพค่าพลังให้ตามเลเวลที่เพิ่มขึ้นเหมือนภาคก่อน และในโหมดเนื้อเรื่อง เหตุการณ์บางฉากจะเปลี่ยนไปจากปกติ ขึ้นอยู่กับตัวละครที่ผู้เล่นเลือกด้วย

ส่วนที่ติในภาคนี้หลักๆ คือ ในเรื่องของความยาก-ง่าย ช่วงต้นๆ เกมยังมีความยากอยู่บ้าง แต่พอเล่นไปได้ซักพักจนตัวละครเลเวลสูงระดับหนึ่ง คุณจะสามารถลุยโหมด Co-op ได้ด้วยตัวคนเดียวทุกมิชชั่น โดยที่บอสจะทำอะไรคุณแทบไม่ได้เลย (ยกเว้นบอสบางตัวที่ดาเมจใส่คุณได้อยู่) และเรื่องของบั๊กสำหรับโหมด Co-op ที่หลายๆ คนเจอ เช่น เข้าหาห้องแล้วเกมเด้งหลุดเอง บลาๆๆ ยังคงต้องรอให้ทีมงานแก้ไขแพทช์ตัวเกมต่อไป

หากใครเป็นแฟนซีรีย์เนป หรือคุณไม่ใช่แฟนซีรีย์นี้และไม่เคยเล่นมาก่อน ก็ลองดูได้ เล่นง่ายๆ สบายๆ ก็ลองดูได้ ถึงคุณจะไม่ใช่แฟนซีรีย์นี้มาตั้งแต่แรก หากคุณได้ลองสัมผัสดู คุณอาจจะหลงรักตัวละครในซีรีย์นี้ขึ้นมาก็ได้ครับ

+ ตัวเกมเข้าถึงได้ง่าย ไม่ซับซ้อน

Completed 100% Achievement in 26 hours
Well, compared to other Neptunia games, that's pretty fast...

Okay, let's review this game compared to Hyperdimension Neptunia U 
Pros :
+ Moar characters! (Hell yeah Uzume!)
+ Multiplayer! (But I don't have any friends so I just use it to complete the achievements... *cry*)
+ New Art Style! (Not exactly new, but this game use Megadimension art style which is compared to Nep U is... new)
+ CPUs in School Life! (More precisely, CLUB Life)
+ Better Port! (I think.... isn't it?)
+ Menu Voices! (Finally, someone who miss me when I'm gone)
+ Less Cancer Achievements! (Finally no ""ALL LILY RANK MAXED"" Hell yeah!)
+ Better Equipment Setup! (We can add patches update, dark history part and accesories)
+ Yuri Sniper Uni and Magical Noirina (THE BEST PROS )
Cons :
- Multiplayer is still buggy, we can't see if the room is currenly Playing or Waiting, and region locked
- Cringest Movie Ever!
- Cancer text font from Nep U is back!
- Short, but hey we can still enjoy the buggy multiplayer, can't we?
Not sure whether it's good or bad :
? No Costume Break.... Less fanservice is good....isn't it?

Well overall this game is good and fun. It runs faster and smoother than Nep U. If you like Nep U, you'll like this one...even if you don't have friends to play with....trustme.",1476612831,1476807991,True,7,0,0.550030052661895752,6,True,False,False,False,,,

Idea Factory's ready to serve you more with MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies (what a mouthful!)!
This is a spiritual successor to Hyperdimension Neptunia U Action Unleashed, but this time, you're brought to the Light Novel universe known as Gamicademi, where you take control of schoolgirls fighting zombies. Yep, schoolgirls, zombies, AND Neptunia, an epic casserole we have here. Now I'm sure we've all modded Left 4 Dead 2 to include Neptunia characters and go on 4 player zombie slaying havok. This here is the real deal, you're getting the actual Nep girls fighting zombies (which are zombified monsters of Neptunia lore like the Dogoo and Super Otaku).
Just like Neptunia U, the story is rather silly, but it's a lot more interesting as it progresses. The story is that Gamicademi is closing, and as a means of saving the school, the girls must film a movie about their school, and believe it or not, zombies appear and the girls use the opportunity to make a zombie movie featuring their school. Both the movie in the making and the game's story all prove to be very silly and hilarious. It's even funnier when some of the girls go into crazy antics.
Meanwhile the gameplay is a lot like Neptunia U, but the moveset has been nerfed and reworked. The new attacks take time to get used to since now you can charge attacks and in turn makes combo stringing a lot more challenging (good luck getting 9,999 combos). You still have your horde of enemies with dumb AI at least, so they can make things more or less easy. It takes time getting used to the new schemes especially with 14 characters (another 14 with their HDD/transformed state), but it still feels fast paced and easy to pick up and play.
Missions are much shorter as well. As this is a Vita game, this was a perfect way to get your Nep on the go. And if you're using a laptop, then you'll get about the same amount of portablility and accessibility. Now the missions may be shorter, but sometimes they can be difficult especially at lower levels. At least you retain the EXP gained if you die in the apocalypse.
Another thing I like about this game is how you can put accessories in JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE. I repeat, JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE. What is this, Garry's Mod? I can cram two stackable plushies onto the same head, headphones, hats, all in the same spot. Clearly someone wanted this to be the next Hat Simulator since Team Fortress 2.
When you're done playing the singleplayer, you can tackle the game's biggest focus, the multiplayer. It's 4 player hack and slash goodness as you take on various quests like it's Monster Hunter and God Eater. I'm surprised at how stable the game's servers are in my view especially with lag free input (a friend of mine told me Tamsoft makes excellent netcoding and their Steamworks are just as good as the Vita). I sure could use a handy button to invite friends over. There's private servers that you can secure with a password, so it's something. And if you wanted to cross-platforms with Vita, no dice. Just Steam servers. But hey, Multiplayer is very fun.
In the end, this takes a lot of the fun things about Neptunia U and made it quirkier, and more fun to play. It's also zombies and schoolgirls mashed in. It seemed to me that Idea Factory saw how many L4D2 and GMOD players loved playing with Neptunia mods and wanted to make a game of its own. I had a lot of fun playing this game, and since it's the Halloween season, what a perfect time for them to bring this game to Steam.

Pros:-

+Blanc!
+Uzume!
+Waifu dress up
+Pretty high FPS, even for a low-end graphics card.
+As with other Neptunia games, it's cute
+Compared to Nep U, it has an RPG-like feel, with a point allocation system
+Multiplayer, which is a first for the Nep series.

Cons:-

-Region-locked multiplay
-Opening sequence can't be skipped
-Opening sequence is stuck in a specific resolution (at least for me)
-Freezes at start if played without WiFI (again, it's probably just me)
-Somewhat lacking in Nep jokes compared to the other games
-You can't friggin move Blanc's hat (tbh annoying as f**k)

Overall: 8/10

So yeah, this game has its bugs, but if you've played the other Neptunia games, you would love it just as much. Be prepared to lose your dignity though (But if you've already played the other games, you would probably have lost most of it already). Enjoy.

ตัวเกมเป็นแบบเดียวกับภาค Nep U คือเป็นแนวลงดัน+ฟันแหลก แต่มีการปรับตัวละคร
ให้ลดความ OP ลง คือในร่าง HDD จะไม่สามารถโจมตีพร้อมกับเคลื่อนไหวอย่างรวดเร็ว
เหมือนภาค Nep U อีกต่อไป ทำให้เราตกเป็นเป้าหมายของศัตรูได้ง่ายขึ้น 
แต่ถึงอย่างนั้น เกมนี้ก็ยังง่ายอยู่ดี 

เกมเน้นไปที่ระบบมัลติเพลเยอร์(MP) แบบ co-op โดยจะมีเควสราว ๆ ครึ่งนึงของทั้งหมด
อยู่ในโหมดนี้ รวมถึง special quest ที่จะเปลี่ยนไปตามวันอีกด้วย
(จันทร์, อังคาร , พุธ...) แต่คุณสามารถเปลี่ยนวันที่บนคอมเพื่อไปทำเควสพวกนี้
ได้โดยไม่ต้องรอเวลาจริง ๆ นอกจากนี้บอสที่ยากที่สุดในเกม
ก็อยู่ในโหมด MP อีกเช่นกัน ดังนั้นถ้าคุณเล่น Story Mode จบแล้ว อย่าเพิ่งคิดว่า
นั่นคือทั้งหมดของเกมนี้ครับ ต้องมาเล่นโหมด MP ด้วย

และไม่ต้องกลัวว่าเกมเน้นโหมด MP แต่ไม่มีเพื่อนเล่นด้วยจะเล่นไม่ได้ครับ เพราะถึงจะเป็น
โหมด MP แต่สามารถเล่นคนเดียวได้ และถ้าคุณอัพเวลจน 99 คุณสามารถเล่นคนเดียว
ไปจนจบทุกฉากได้แบบชิล ๆ (ถ้าเวล 99 จะมีบอสใหญ่ของโหมด MP ตัวเดียวที่ทำคุณเลือดลดได้)

ข้อเสียหลัก ๆ ของเกมก็คือ บั๊คเกมที่ไม่รู้จะแก้เมื่อไหร่ โดยเฉพาะโหมด MP
ที่มีบั๊คที่น่าปวดหัว คือระหว่างที่คุณลงดันในโหมดนี้ หากมีคน join ห้องเข้ามา
คุณจะออกจากดันไม่ได้ ติดแหงกอยู่ในนั้นจนกว่าคนที่ join มาจะกดออกจากห้องไป
ทำให้หากคุณอยากเข้ามาเก็บเควสในโหมด MP คุณจะต้องตั้ง password ห้องเสมอเพื่อกันคนเข้ามา

นอกจากนี้ก็บั๊คเรื่องปรับความละเอียดเป็น 1080p แล้ว เกมจะค้าง+เด้งหลุดโดยไม่มีสาเหตุ

+ The characters are awesome as always

- There isn't an extra after played the story (I really liked the Neptral Tower and the Gamindustri Gauntlet of the U)

A new spin-off game of the Neptunia franchise, based on the same system as Neptunia U and of course develloped by the same team. Just like Noire got her own game, this one has Blanc as a main character, even though Neptune is present throughout the entire game. When will a Vert-only game come out?

But let's now evaluate the game.

The gameplay :

If you have played Nep U and got the mechanics right, it will not be hard to play MegaTagmension, as it is also a Hack-N-Slash. Although, a few changes are visible. The commands are a little bit different, and if you play with a keyboard you might wanna go through the settings to re-assignate some keys. Goodbye to the torn-off duds caused by the monsters, and goodbye to the Nepbull released by monsters. Now, if you wanna heal during battle, you have to buy items and equip them. New ennemies, and a new way to improve your characters using ""Ability points"" that you gain through leveling. No medals anymore, but instead treasure pieces (in fact consoles) that let you unlock new outfits. You can also by accessories and customize your characters, this can be helpful later. Overall, an easy-to-understand system. Also, if you're used to grinding in the Neptunia games, try not to grind too much. A lvl 70 character won't help you fight the last boss in an epic battle, as you need to be around lvl 40 to beat it. You don't want to kill it too easily.

The Story :

As I said earlier, this game's main protag is Blanc, our Justice goddess (No, Blanc, that was a praise, put that hammer down! ). Our 8 Gamindustri rulers (Yes, I put the Candidates as rulers) have enrolled in Gamicademy, a school situated on an island in the center of Gamindustri, so that anybody from any country can join. They have joined this school to understand humans better and help their people. But when they hear that the academy is gonna close because of a lack of students, Neptune don't hesitate to do anything she can to save it and bring more students. The story itself is pretty entertaining, our 4th-wall breaks are still here and some scenes are an hommage to the community. The time completion may depend on your will to end the game fast or not. For me, it took 8 hours, and I haven't ""fully"" completed the game as there are some scenes that can only be unlocked via certain conditions (But in-game hints can help you unlock them). A whole lot of characters from the different games, as well as a new character brought by the constant wish of the Devs to put themselves in the game : Tamsoft. The same way IF and Compa represents Idea Factory and Compile Heart (And don't forget our dungeon helper Stella, representing FelliStella), Tamsoft represents... Well, Tamsoft, they didn't bother trying to change the name, which is not completely a bad thing. She's a rather strong character and can become useful in some fights. (She even have a transformation).

The Multiplayer :

Remember earlier, when I told you about customizing your characters? Well, it is mainly because there's a brand-new multiplayer mode, allowing you to take on quests with up to 3 other people. The quests aren't related to the main game, and the Multiplayer has in fact it's own story, and can take some time to complete. You will even be able to play directly with the HDD form of a character, while another player uses it's normal form. (It happened to me, I was playing as Purple Heart while somebody else was playing as Neptune, and we cleared bosses with an excessive amount of Neptune Break). You can choose wether to use a save from the Story mode, keeping your lvls, or you can start with a brand-new save only for Multiplayer and work your way from lvl 1 to lvl 99.

Issues :

I have only noticed a few issues :
-Whenever I start the game, I have to wait 5-10 minutes before reaching the main menu. I suspect this is because I don't have the perfect configuration.
-Sometimes, in multiplayer, people might try to join while you're doing a quest, which may results in endlees loops of : <Player> has joined, <Player> has left, <Player> has joined, <Player> has left, etc...

So this concludes my review of this game. A rather good spin-off that doesn't deviate from the franchise, a good story, a good gameplay and very few issues. For me, I give this game a 9.5/10",1476370375,1476370375,True,0,0,0.499833405017852783,0,True,False,False,False,,,

MegaTagmension is a musou style game (like Dynasty Warriors) while the promise and potential is good, the problem is that the whole game consists of very short scenes in which you fight just 1 pack of monsters. The most gameplay you will get in a row is about 3 minutes.  This is NOT a game in which you traverse large levels with monster packs, bosses, complete objectives etc. You load the scene, kill 20 mobs, and that's it. I haven't completed it yet, but the whole thing can probably be completed in about 3-4 hours tops. Of course there is some replayability thanks to leveling, lily ranks, treasures gathering and such.

Most of the time is spent in menus and reading dialogue cutscenes, which are funny and interesting as always in the Neptunia games, but when you have to spend 5 minutes reading dialogues to get 2 minutes of action it kind of kills the fun.

If you are a hardcore Neptunia fan, it will still be fun of course. Though I would suggest waiting for a sale. This game just isn't worth 30€.",1476351285,1476351285,False,1,0,0.490004360675811768,0,True,False,False,False,,,

这回主题是……学园+丧尸（让我想起了《学园默示录》，当然这款游戏就没那么血腥）
故事是游戏学园快闭园的时候，学生们为了能够维持下去借这次丧尸危机来拍摄电影作为青春的纪念
而且居然拍摄途中选择特定角色，拍摄时就会出现该特定角色（所以全CG收集注意这一点）
手感跟前作海王星U差不多（我用手柄的）
而且这作有联机（在之前首发那时候联机都有时候跳出，直到现在更新到1.03时稳定多了）
再说今次优化很好，我的渣渣GT240卡都能够到60帧

all you do is right click the game in library then go to properties then go to local files and right click the application thing (should have a picture of one of the characters so easy to find) then go all the way down to properties and hit compatibility tab then if you have windows 10 like me put the game in compatibility mode for windows 7 (windows 8 or xp1 might work too) then look at bottom of page under settings and click ""disable display scaling"" and ""run as administrator"" then hit the apply button and play game! and enjoy some more of our beloved NEP NEP!!!

this site might help too: http://www.chaoshour.com/articles/fixes/megatagmension-steam-broken-faulty-crashing-freezing-loading-screen-problem-bugs-glitches-fix

but to get on with my review, i have every single neptunia game except the spin-offs so i figured after seeing this on steam that I should give it a shot and so far I am glad I did! This neptunia game unlike the main games has a more Dynasty warriors style of combat (which I enjoy its a nice change) and it is quite fun!! the ability to pick and use any character is cool especially considering the co-op which is unique. The music is cool and the comedy has not yet dissapointed me! This is classic nep-nep so if you dare call yourself a nepper you will buy this game on ps vita and steam NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (ANGRY BLANC VOICE)

I love nep-nep i honestly will buy any neptunia product just because the characters are so awesome and hilarious (though the nep sisters come first!!)

EDIT: now that I have completed the game and got my fill of nep I can say for sure that this is a great neptunia game its the first spin-off game of the series that i have actually bought it does not have anywhere near as long of a story or content as the main games have though but thats to be expected right? other than the really short storyline and lack of content for replay value i thouroughly enjoyed this experience like any other neptunia game I definetly recommend you buy it if you find a good sale on the game",1476273312,1476303287,True,0,0,0.487804889678955078,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Il y a eu quelques améliorations surtout au niveau du scénario très orienté humour, le système de médailles a été enlevé (ouf!) et les combats sont un peu plus interessants avec quelques attaques a esquiver sur les plus gros monstres.
Certes il reste assez limité surtout sur le contenu, sa manque de quêtes, d'armes et accessoires. Attendez vous a une dizaine d'heures pour la ""story"" en ayant grind un peu, sa fait peu mais le jeu reste plaisant avec les différents personnages de la série et quelques nouveau (mention spéciale pour Tamsoft qui est pour moi le perso le plus interessant a jouer).

Points positifs :
-Personnages équilibrés et emblématique de la série.
-Possibilité de placer les accessoires comme on veut (positionement dans l'espace).
-Présence d'un multijoueur avec des quetes inédites (faisable en solo).


Points négatifs : 
-Les programmes a mettre sur les armes ont un certaine durabilité, ils faut en acheter/craft plusieurs du coup. Dans ce cas la pourquoi ne pas les avoir fait permanent?
-Niveau trop court en général, sa se plie en quelques secondes pour le début du moins.
-Jeu globalement trop facile.
-Certains personnages ont des combos beaucoup trop simples et si on a pas débloqué toutes les ""techniques"" ils sont vite ennuyant a jouer.
-Le lock est a revoir : il est très imprécis, la caméra est trop zoomé et on le perds quand on se transforme.
-Chargement dans le menu ou on peut customiser et lancer les missions du jeu un peu long malgré que le jeu soit sur SSD.
-Peu d'armes, acessoires un peu limités et grind complétement RNG sur les ""trésors"" et les ""Processors/Dark history parts"", c'est infame comme systeme !
-Il manque une liste avec ce qu'on peut avoir sur telle scènes ou monstres, sur internet celle ci n'ont pas été mis a jour pour la version PC.

既然《MegaTagmension》是款關於殭屍電影的遊戲，單人戰役幾乎百分之九十劇情都是女神們在自編自導自演，無厘頭又肆無忌憚地惡搞電影業界不成文的【好萊塢公式】，例如：一開始登場的夥伴會在關鍵時刻背叛你、明明可以逃走卻硬要留下斷後送死、死去的神秘角色是主角失散多年的親人、反派放出殭屍卻讓自己被咬死等等。令人感到遺憾的地方是劇情與關卡內容幾乎沒有任何關聯性，像是劇情明明進展到萬年臨演 Norie 突變成殭屍攻擊 Blanc ，進入關卡後卻是要求玩家在時間限制內斬殺特定數量敵人，就連被 Neptune 推薦飾演黑幕大魔王的 Plutia 都只演出短短數幕，隨即便拔下大魔王一角，如果製作團隊能夠真的將劇情和關卡內容同步連貫，遊戲體驗肯定會比當前版本好上百倍。


關於戰鬥系統的缺點其實很明顯，角色施展大招時非常容易打空，不知道是否為製作團隊想要讓整體難度上升所作的決定，還是純粹是設計上的失誤，大招影響範圍比起前作不僅大幅縮水，還不會附加群體定身效果，玩家會很常發現施展大招到一半，敵人居然大搖大擺【慢步走出】招式範圍，除非像是大魔王等級的怪物（這種怪物血量多且機動性差），不然很少怪物會完整吃完整套傷害。這種現象造成所謂的【大招無用論】，筆者個人愛用角 Iris Heart 就是一個很好的例子，她的普攻範圍大又廣，就算不出大招也能打出可觀傷害，可是當你使用大招後會看到女王大人不斷對著空氣抽鞭子，抽完鞭子後立馬變回羅莉型態，那還不如不出招式比較省事，反正用普攻打到底也不會取得較差的關卡評價。


相同於前作，開始遊戲進入選單界面時，點選【Action】就能依照建議等級展開電影拍攝作業，玩家最多可選擇兩名角色參戰，同時配置輔助角色在戰鬥時為你施放增益效果，前作不人性的角色限定任務不存在於本作，也就是說我們能夠用一隻角色一路打到通關，不需要花費精力去培育其他不感興趣的角色。這項設定對想要快速通關或是對特定角色較不擅長的玩家可說是一大福音，不過相對地讓耐玩度大幅下降，不是有意要獲得全成就的玩家，有些角色可能永遠都不會拿來使用（筆者個人就對黑國姊妹花興致缺缺）。

真的要提到《MegaTagmension》與《Hyperdimension Neptunia U》最大不同之處，就在於本作並未收錄前作廣受好評的【服裝破壞系統】，玩家無法再次欣賞到女神們被怪物欺負到遍體鱗傷，衣衫不整地倒在地上臉紅喘息的美景。儘管製作團隊提升了招式變化性、登場人物數量、以及新增多人連線模式想要帶給玩家更美好的遊戲體驗，但少了爆衣系統就好似大口享用炸物時少了一杯冰涼碳酸飲料陪襯，由衷希望未來《Hyperdimension Neptunia》系列如果還有機會推出新的無雙割草遊戲，請務必要讓服裝破壞系統復活啊！


關鍵問題來了，所以說《MegaTagmension》是款值得一玩的作品嗎？這個問題會因為詢問者不同而有兩種完全相反的答案，如果你是系列作死忠粉絲，其實筆者想不到任何阻止你去購買本作的動機，《Hyperdimension Neptunia》系列一直以來就不是透過遊戲本身所呈現的內容去吸引玩家，人物設定和誇張無厘頭的歡樂氣氛才是粉絲最津津樂道的部分。如果現在用專業動作遊戲玩家的身分來看這款遊戲，它的玩法從開始到結束都沒有特別突出的變化，遊玩一輪就可以解鎖大部分成就更是讓耐玩度大幅下降，除了登場角色數量值得給予正面評價之外，其餘部分都僅能獲得【差強人意】之中庸偏差評價。


優點：
+白國子民歡呼吧！主角由遊戲業界支持票數第一 White Heart 領銜主演。
+可操縱角色上升至十四名，武士刀專精廠商娘 Tam Soft 首次登場之作。
+新增多人連線模式，與主線劇情完全獨立的四人協力關卡等你來挑戰。


缺點：
-不管是從遊戲性還是玩法變化性來看，表現都差強人意，及格邊緣水準。
-服裝破壞系統慘遭移除，實在搞不懂為何要拋棄前作擁有的優質設定呢？


結論：與前作相比變化不大 ，白國子民必須直接入手，普通玩家建議等折扣。

The missions take usually about 30-60 seconds and only boss fights can take more time.

Before you play you must know:

-	game is like U: action only the camera control can be tricky some time as you fight a 6-7 times bigger enemy so prepare to see mostly only the legs of the bosses.
-	the story is the least good of all Neptune game, but if you liked the other games you will like this as well
-	Multiplayer it sill buggy as I write this but I could get in teams at least a couple of times so later it will surely get better(and you can do multiplayer fight alone as well)
-	 the humour and style is the same as before
-	Uni and some other character attack style changed so you cannot own all enemy so easily with them like before… that’s  great because some of them was to over powered (and some still remain, but that’s not bad)
So if you liked U: Action you will love this to and will make you wait for the next game!

If you have never played a Nep game before I personally would play Rebirth One first as thats a much better way to get to know the CPU's.

If you did like Nep U then Blanc vs the zombies is a better more polished version of that with multiplayer online co-op and this time the enemys are more active with some of the larger mobs having skills you actully have to watch out for and dodge. Plus this time the cloths dont break which I regard as a good thing though you might not.

Furthermore, multiplayer rooms are SERIOUSLY needing some updating in password department as despite me putting in a random number password, people sometimes get lucky (Or the password means nothing and gets removed when the room is created. Again, needs updating) and enter which again, causes the game to not finish off the multiplayer mission unless they leave before the timer at the end runs out.

Итак, в этом обзоре распишу всё по порядку, все достоинства и недостатки, ну и чуть-чуть заденем, как пример, AU.
P.S. чуть-чуть для справки: AU вышла в 15 году на Виту, Blanc + Neptune (в дальнейшем будем сокращение B+N) - в 13 году.
[h1] Геймплей.	[/h1]
Здесь, я могу с уверенностью сказать, что он намного лучше, чем в AU. Здесь теперь не получится долбить одну кнопку! Хоть как и осталось, два удара, ими надо постоянно комбинировать, иначе рискуете нанести 2-3 удара и всё. Спеллы теперь не имеют шкалу заряда, а просто используется время до следующего использования. Менять их нельзя, но при этом доступно 4 разнообразных спелла для использования. Мини боссы, как, допустим Rival Mech теперь не бьются как обычные мобы в AU. Это теперь полноценные мини боссы, против которых надо обязательно ставить блок во время их атаки! (да, как раз в этой части можно ставить блок!).
В этой части мы можем играть за 14 всем нам знакомых персонажей, в отличие от AU, где нам так не хватало Ирис, Пиш и Узуми![spoiler] особенно Ирис :D	[/spoiler]. Прокачка уровня теперь ""адекватная"" (несмотря, какой сложности уровень, получите максимум +2-3 уровня). Оружие и различные плюшки, акссесуары, патчи (я их называю модули прокачки оружия) можно покупать в магазине, в отличие от AU, где нам приходилось собирать медальки для открытия всякой всячины. Во время боя можно использовать различные предметы, от Nep Bull, который восстанавливает незначительную часть хп, до предметов, которые дают полную полоску EXE drive.
Здесь присутствует прокачка статов, что как раз не хватало в AU.
Из минусов - чрезмерно маленькая дистанция того, когда вас заметят противники. Вам надо всегда подходить к ним в плотную, чтобы они хоть как то реагировали на вас. С боссами такие проблемы не возникают, они всегда вас видят, где бы вы не находились.
[h1] Саундтрэк. [/h1]
О боже, новая музыка? Неужели?! Да, да, здесь совсем другая музыка в главном меню и бою, лишь присутствуют некоторые треки в диалогах, которые сопровождают всю серию игр Непки. Особенно радует тема боссов, как будто играешь не в игру, где маленькие девочки дерутся против желе, а в самый натуральный Devil May Cry!
[h1] Мультиплеер. [/h1]
Эту часть можно было отнести к геймплею, но слишком много бы получилось, поэтому решил рассказать о нём отдельно.
Мультиплеер здесь совсем не даёт скучать, в него интересно играть, много квестов (не понимаю, почему все говорят, что мало их? По-моему, их достаточное количество.), а что самое главное, он на 4 человека! Так же, есть специальные квесты, которые являются ежедневными и рассчитаны на прокачку того или иного атрибута у персонажа. Здесь большое количество боссов, от главного злодея из сингла, до огромного кибер-пса, робота, похожего на космодесантника из Вахи, ну и фэйковых богинь (Да, вам дадут возможность сразится с Нептунией, Верт, Ноар и Бланк. Естественно они будут в форме богинь). В игре присутствует глобальная таблица по очкам, заработанных в мультиплеере, так что любители соревноваться за первое место - вперёд!
---------------------------------
Ну, вроде бы я всё рассказал по данной игре, хоть и нашлись определенные минусы, но я особо не обращал на них внимания. Лишь нашёлся большой минус по фуллскрину - игра просто напросто показывает черный экран, либо игру, но с очень низким фпс, поэтому приходится играть на растянутом.

It's very similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia U : Action Unleashed for it's hack and slash genre and that this installment features co-op multiplayer!

However, in regards to playable content, I find this one lacking compared to NepU, NepU has more quests I believe and afterwards you would have to complete the tournaments + Neptral tower if you were aiming for 100% achievements, NepU provides much more play. With MegaTagmension, after finishing the 12 acts, you'll have to resort to multiplayer to get 100% and it's pretty much more quests and luck to get certain items. A few things that I do like is the accessories in the game, all accessories are avaiable to all characters and do not require multiple purchases if multiple characters are going to wear the same thing. I also like how you can adjust the position/placements of the accessories. And of course, I liked how Uzume, Plutia and Peashy are in this game along with the new character, Tamsoft.

I do have some cons about the game. Firstly, the game's consistency. I feel as though the game may be a bit too easy especially when you decide to do a ""YOLO"" with a character at level 8 on a mission that recommends level 25-30 (Around there) and you are still able to beat it despite being underlevelled by almost 3-4 times, if not more. Then again, for players who love a good challenge, this may be a downside. For me, I personally don't mind.
With multiplayer, I do hope there is a patch in the future that may fix some possible issues such as players joining MP games that are password protected. I am willing to play game with another player but when I set a password protected MP, I set it because I want to do solo MP for achievements and so, it'd be nice if players would stop randomly joining my password protected rooms somehow XD

简单说说这一作的优点：故事剧情更为优秀，游戏的连招系统也逐渐的完善，耐玩性和ACTU相比，一个天上一个地下，学院装的诺瓦露涅普，普露露，污子梅更是让人欲罢不能。而且支持联机

但这个不是一款合格的ACT游戏，想玩ACT的玩家请谨慎购买，我玩黑魂都没被玩的这么气过，所幸的是，游戏的故事模式难度不大，通关之后刷3S评价也不是问题，除了联机的部分地图那是就算你99级也能打得你不要不要的。

游戏暴露出了地雷社做act游戏的稚嫩和太多不足，连招舒适度，玩家拆招解招，躲避伤害。这个游戏能让你感到:嗨呀，好气。因为你的人物，在放完SP技能，闪避之后，甚至是挨了一下伤害之后都会被打断所有动作，然后恢复姿态要一秒甚至更多。然后你就被BOSS打完一套之后又一套活活给打死。好吧，这些忍了，我像真三国无双那样，被打了硬直之后跳一下，减少我的硬直时间，受身可以吧。接下来，是BOSS的联机图，总之，BOSS除了四个女神之外，一个比一个大，基本都是修脚，最可怕的是什么？这个游戏不像真三，可以在一套招打完之前的其中一个攻击动作之后可以闪避，而是必须打完那一套动作！比如紫心有一个轻攻击，是三连斩，意思就是说，等那三连斩打完了之后你才能闪避或者说接一个SP技能。呵呵！这还不算，里面的BOSS，除了幺鸡，小高达之外，都没有硬直！就连部位破坏也是尸王的专利。意思就是说你一套连击，你不能拆招闪避就算了，你还打不出硬直。另外，敌人的攻击没有起手动作，基本是瞬发，比如高达的摩擦地板，比如机械鸟的甩尾，比如小高达的王八拳，另外，那让人想吐的视角设定，导致各种神奇的攻击判定也让我欲罢不能。另外这个游戏的连招起来感觉不如真三，打久了会很无聊，感觉什么绚丽的大招也不过如此，相比真三7的连招，你会觉得真三7连招这么爽？好吧，游戏难度低，时间长一点，我99的黑心紫心有啥不能解决的？

然后是联机图里，有个挑战四个女神的任务，我想：嗨呀，终于有同等体积的对手了，这下可以打硬直像DMC一样玩皇牌空战了吧？然后你会在打白心的时候气的想砸键盘鼠标手柄。你不仅不能像真三那样紧急闪避，你还只能看着自己的人物傻逼兮兮的站在那里打完一套武术或者说在打完之前被白心那一套打得不要不要的，就连受身也没用，因为白心有一个龙车的技能，而且白心的连招相当恐怖。

这些就完了？不不不，我们还有这屎一般的联机，除了首发当天我和我朋友一起开了黑玩了几把之外，之后再也连接不上，移植到PC你至少稍加改动可以吧？把搜索房间翻页，支持搜索房间名字这些加上可以吧？另外加入房间你还能进入里世界，你和朋友加入同一间房，你会发现，咦？为什么没房主？另外两边看到的房间里的人都各不相同。还经常出现莫名其妙加不进房间的情况。
再来说说DLC，非信仰误入，否则你很可能会心疼自己的那36。

在我看来，地雷社这段时间一直在炒冷饭，没有丝毫的进步，玩家一直在等四女神OL，我也在期待，倘若哪天四女神登录steam，我也会非常高兴，如果是买断制我也会毫不犹豫的为了自己喜欢的紫心买。可是等了这么久，那个网游呢？",1475748944,1475749488,False,23,7,0.740738749504089355,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I throroughly enjoyed the Nep U and Famitsu grew up to be one of my favourite characters in the roster. Plus the game was supposed to have multiplayer! I couldn't be more hyped for this game! I even bought Vita LE for amazing physical merchandise...

...but after all the buildup, the game turned out to be a very disappointing experience for me. At least with Hyperdevotion I knew what I was getting into. But this.... I'm very surprised in a negative way :(

Nevertheless, let's get into positives first!

[b]Pros:[/b]
-[b]Combat feels vastly improved over NepU[/b] - combos feel more fluid, new SP system is more fun, active skills feel strong but not broken. Majority of characters feel fresh and fun to play. I really enjoy mechanics of the improved combat system!
-[b]Plutia, Peashy and Uzume[/b] make their spin off debut!
-[b]Blanc finally is being protagonist of her own game![/b] And I really like her visual design in it!
-[b]The english VA with few exceptions is as good as ever![/b] Noire, Uni or Nep sisters dub always cheer me up!
-[b]Vastly customisable accessories[/b] - it's really fun to play with them to alter appearence of your character!
-[b]Monsters' sounds aren't as obnoxious as in NepU[/b]


[b]Cons:[/b]
-The most important one, [b]multiplayer is simply broken[/b]. I spent around an hour in total trying to get it work but all I got were crashes and ghost rooms. The only multi game I managed to run was when I made the room and played alone because nobody could join in reasonable time. It's really disappointing, given how supposedly MP is important in the game.
-The MP is made even worse with [b]artificial region locking[/b], it's stupid to change download region just to try to be able to play with my USA friends.
-The MP issue is reinforced by the fact that there is [b]no end game at all in single player[/b] - it seems all the endgame focus went for Multuplayer mode...
-[b]The stage design in single player is simply bad[/b]. It does no justice for improved combat system at all. Every, EVERY single one of the stages is ""your character spawn - pack of mobs spawn in front of you - whack it till they die - mission complete after 30 seconds"". The stage design is much more simplistic than NepU, and NepU was already a pretty simple game.
-[b]There still are some things that feel simply wrong in the combat mechanics[/b] - like team-attack and majority of EX Bursts knocking most of the enemies back with first attack, so it's really hard to damage any enemy with the skills. The stage design usually doesn't support pushing monsters into corner (if there even are any corners at all). 
-[b]Some characters still got short end of the stick with balance[/b] - For example Blanc feels really sluggish to play and is simply not fun.
-[b]Story is bad[/b], not ""so bad it's funny"", it's failing trying to be ""funny bad"" (think of AVGN movie for example). 
-With an exception of few geniunely cute or funny moments,[b]everyone from the cast lacks almost any characterisation unless going for behind the curtains scenes[/b] I think you shouldn't try so hard just to see Famitsu and Dengekiko doing anything else than roaring at each other. I didn't see every one of them yet, but truth to be told, the game didn't give me an incentive to try hard unlocking all the events neither with strong story nor strong stage design in SP mode...
-[b]While being good most of the times, the english VA occasionaly felt wrong[/b] - even if they have to reuse same VA for more than one character, they should at least make her change her voice tone even just a little bit. It really kills immersion - [i]was Tamsoft C-Sha in disguise?[/i]
-One of the most fun aspects of NepU for me - [b]the lily dialogues - were taken away[/b]. Lilies are almost completely meaningless in the game yet again.
-[b]Soundtrack is inferior to Nep U[/b] - there are decent tracks here and there but it lacked anything memoriable like Eager Editor from NepU. For me it's telling that even for the last boss they used remix of an existing track, while In NepU they did compose new music for that event.

Despite my negative review I'm still quite hyped for MP component of the game! I really want to play with my friends and I hope that the region locking or crashes won't stand in a way after few patches! I'll be more than happy to change my review to positive once that change happens and MP turns out to be as good experience as I'm hoping for it to be!

Unfortunately, as of now, I think single player experience is far too weak to recommend and is simply below average. It's not hyperdevotion's level of bad, but it's still not good. And the major appeal of the game - Multiplayer -  is simply broken.

For now I'd rate this game [b]4.5/10[/b] :(  [please fix multiplayer so I can improve the score!]

[b]TL;DR[/b] - single player mode is not really fun, Multiplayer is broken. I don't think the game is worth buying until multiplayer mode is fixed.

Edit as of 2017-01-04 : I tried to come back to multplayer but it feels dead, and there are only rare password-protected rooms. Those mission feel fun to play solo but unfortunately they aren't good enough to change my review score significantly - maybe up by 1 point to 5.5/10. I still wouldn't recommend this game, which makes me sad :(",1475744468,1483568459,False,11,0,0.553844213485717773,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 Megatagmension é um spinn-off da franquia Neptunia na qual a Blanc(White Heart)é a protagonista.Ela é as outras CPUs do jogo como Neptune,Vert e Noire fazem parte de uma escola que está para ser fechada.Eis que Neptune,que faz parte do clube de filmes,pensa em fazer um filme amador sobre zumbis para salvar a escola.
 Ao convidar as irmãzinhas de Blanc,Rom e Ram,que aceitam o convite,elas rapidamente começam a filmagem,que é interrompida por Blanc.Após a interrupção,Neptune explica a situação e convida a mesma para participar,Blanc de imediato recusa alegando não se importar com a escola,mas depois de Neptune dizer que ela pode escrever o roteiro e dirigir a filmagem,eis que Blanc aceita participar.Dessa parte em diante começa a historia de Blanc pelo mundo das filmagens.
 
Este jogo ao que pude ver na mera uma hora que joguei(momento em que estou escrevendo a analise),segue o mesmo estilo de Hack´n slash de Hyperdimension Neptunia U,ou seja,ordas e ordas de zumbis lhe aguardão(eu acho kk),os controles são de fácil manejo(pelo menos eu não achei complicado) e claro aquela pitada de fanservice + moe que todos nós fãs amamos de coração ^^.
 Muito obrigado por ter lido minha analise.Espero podermos jogar no modo multijogador desse game qualquer hora.Bom jogo e futuras boas compras ^^.

I got tired of this game's story pretty quick. It didn't seem to have the same quality of humor the other Neptunia games have. I had to start skipping the story mid game, because the battles can be really short. You're sometimes faced with 3 minutes of story, literally 30 seconds of gameplay, then another minute of story, then starting a new mission you may get even more story before you get more game play. If the battles were longer, this may not have been such an issue.

Megatagmension has very little challenge if you learn to use all of the controls. Once I started blocking, and sticking with one character I flew through the game. A lot of the missions you will beat in 10seconds-1minute

 A large part of the game are the multiplayer missions, which you can start at any time, at any level. The multiplayer missions end up significantly harder than the end boss of the story mode. During my play time, players couldn't connect to me, and I couldn't connect to others, it is/was a wide spread issue. You may have to plan on playing the multiplayer missions solo. I was able to beat all the multiplayer missions on my own, and think it might be more fun that way, it's just not challenging enough with more people.

I think a lot of my gripes with the game are because of design choices based on it being developed for a portable system (PS Vita). Short missions are good for on the go systems. You can't always depend on being able to play multiplayer so it would be nice to be able to play the other half of the game without internet. Consider 2 years from now, how many people are going to be playing the multiplayer anyway.. 

Despite it all, I had fun with it, which is why I'm giving it recommended status. But this game is not for most. If you've never played a Neptunia game, I recommend the first game: Hyperdimension Neptunia rebirth re1.

Story Summary

To put it in a much more simplistic way, due to the population of humans being decreased dramatically (obiously they were pointing out what the situation is in Japan) school is about to CLOSE! Together with Blanc and the others, they will be filming a zombie movie to save the school.

Multiplayer

Yeap, the main core of the game and also the first Neptunia game with Multiplayer (Co-op) experience. Is it good? Overall, I would say the combat system feels good, controls are not too complicated so every nep fans can get on to it easily. AI are much more smarter than Action U that's for sure. And yeah, EPIC BOSS BATTLE!

Of course there were some balancing issues, some characters are just way too OP. After one week or so, everyone is going to stick to that one character on almost every match even its a maxed out Lv99. The quest are going to be repetitive as well, I can assure you that in 2 weeks time someone is going to clear every single quest in Multiplayer...

BUT STILL, it is worth the money, especially when you have friends to play with. Spending a few hours with fellow nep fans, getting a chance to find new friends to add on Steam is definitely one of its charm

This game is pretty great.
Changing my game to fullscreen gave me a black screen, but it saved the setting after I closed it.
Singleplayer works flawlessly after that as far as I can tell.
Multiplayer is buggy, but that should be fixed soon.

You can make the game look nicer with:
-Nvidia DSR: Just set something like 2x or 4x and the game will automatically render at that.
-GeDoSaTo: Add the game to whitelist and it should work.

[h1]Workarounds for getting your game to work properly[/h1]
You can change the config file in the game directory to make it fullscreen.
1 for full screen, 2 for borderless window, and 3 for window

โหมด Co-Op ไม่ได้ต่างอะไรจากโหมดเนื้อเรื่องมากนัก แค่...
- มันเหมือนโหมดที่คนต้องเข้ามาเล่นเป็นหลักมากหว่าเนื้อเรื่อง
- มีของให้เก็บมากมาย และ บอสจำนวนหนึ่งที่โหดขิงๆ เลยทีเดียว
- เล่นกับเพื่อนได้ด้วย แถมไม่ต้องแปลงร่างตอนสู้ เพราะสามารถเลือกเล่นเทพธิดาที่แปลงร่างแล้วได้เลย
- ไม่ต้องปลดล็อคตัวละครให้ยุ่งยาก เพราะมีให้ครบใน Co-Op โหมด
- ตังค์และของดรอปเยอะกว่าเนื้อเรื่อง

ตัวละครในเกมถือว่าจัดเหล่าเทพธิดาที่สำคัญในภาคก่อนๆ มาให้ครบกันเลยทีเดียว (ถึงแม้เหล่าแฟนๆ ของ if-tan และ Compa จะได้เห็นพวกหล่อนแค่ในร้านค้าเท่านั้น) ส่วนของเนื้อเรื่องเรียกได้แค่ว่าค่อนข้างน่าเบื่อ เหมือนหนังเกรด B ยังไงยังงั้น CG ในเกมไม่มีเลยมีเพียงบทพูดและเสียงพากย์ให้จิ้นกันเอาเอง

สรุป ภาคนี้มีดีที่แฟนเกมเนปจะได้เล่นด้วยกันได้ ถึงเกมนี้จะเป็นหลักของบลัน แต่ถ้าต้องการคุณภาพขอให้เล่นภาคหลักจะดีกว่านะครับ

Сюжет повествует нам о некой Академии в Игромире, утратившей свою популярность, и, конечно же, наши неутомимые богини со своими друзьями собираются решить это проблему, сняв фильм про зомби. Но, как оказалось, Академия и действительно подверглась атаке неприятелей.


Это уже второй слешер во вселенной Neptunia от IF.
Рассмотрев отличия Neptunia U и MegaTagmension Blanc, мы можем выявить плюсы и минусы новой игры.

Итак, плюсы:
+Большое количество новых и красивых локаций;
+Новые и старые переработанных враги;
+Измененная анимация и радиус атак;
+Очень здоровский  Online-режим, во встроенными фразами и падающими процессорами с боссов;
+Огромное количество миссий в Online-режиме, появляющихся в разные дни недели;
+Большое количество боссов в online-режиме, в том числе и dark purple/white/green/black из megadimension neptunia;
+""Умный"" редактор акссесуаров, аля ""присобачь что хочешь и куда хочешь"";
+Система ""сокровищ"", из которой вы сможете получить новые костюмы;
+Сама игра более хардкорная;
+Стабильно 60 FPS;

Минусы:
-Очень мало миссий в сюжете (всего 12 чаптеров, вроде), которые проходятся довольно быстро;
-Мало DLC;
-Не ""рвутся"" тянки после нанесения большого кол-ва урона ( а для меня это очень существенный минус :D );
-Как и в U, графика не была изменнена, а осталась как на  PS VITA;


Стоит отметить, что ИГРА ПРЕКРАСНО РАБОТАЕТ И НА PC, НЕ СООТВЕТСТВУЮЩИМ СИСТ. ТРЕБОВАНИЯМ - они тут очень завышены.

Вердикс:

В игре можно почувствовать драйв и просто отдохнуть и почитать легкий и не затейливый сюжет, приправленный смачными боями. +Ко всему развлечься с другом в online - режиме.

vor weg ich Persönlich finde Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed spielerisch besser,
MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies ist wie alle Neptune spiele auch ohne Imba items viel zu einfach.

auch story technisch ist VS Zombies ziemlich lau ist schwer hier einen rerun zu machen, es fehlt mir bis her jegliche ambition , da mich werde die story packen kann noch irgend wie fordern ist.

auch die typischen Neptune Like Humoristischen einlagen ziehn hier kaum

Liegt wohl daran das TAMSOFT  hier mit am boot ist die schon für Onechanbara Z2: Chaos verantwotlich wahren.

Für mich das schlechtes Neptue game , im kern denoch noch grund solides spiel.


warum ich es nicht zurück geben ?

1. mag ich die spiele von  IDEA FACTORY, COMPILE HEART ziemlich und hoffe das auch andre titel  noch den weg auf steam finden

2.  bin ich großer fan der Neptune Serie und möchte diese Serie weiterhingern unterstützen 

Technisch gesehn
bis her der schlechteste port der Neptune Serie ,
es gibt viele kleine probleme z.b Vollbild abstürze , kein richtig funktionierender multiplayer modus,
freez beim grafik umstellen so gar hier kommt es ab und zu zu abstürzen.
die Voice (englisch) der Charakter sind schlecht  bis sehr schelcht ausgepegelt.
beispiel; Blanc ist  nomral laut und Nepgear ist im gegensatz da zu sehr leise im allgemein sind alle leiser wie die Voice von Blanc, wenn man die Spiel musik auf standard lässt werden die leisen stimmen oft von dieser verschluckt.

หรือถ้าจะให้อธิบายโดยย่อสำหรับคอซีรีย์นี้ Blanc VS Zombies ก็คือ Nep U 2.0 ที่มี Blanc เป็นตัวเอกนั่นเอง

[b] เนื้อหาของเกมเป็นอย่างไร? [/b]

Gamacademi กำลังอยู่ในภาวะวิกฤต นอกจากโรงเรียนกำลังจะถูกปิดเพราะจำนวนนักเรียนที่ลดน้อยถอยลง ที่นี่ยังถูกโจมตีจากฝูงซอมบี้ที่จู่ ๆ ก็ได้ปรากฏตัวขึ้นอย่างเป็นปริศนา เพราะเหตุนี้ Blanc และผองเผื่อนในชมรมภาพยนตร์จึงพลิกวิกฤตเป็นโอกาสโดยการสร้างภาพยนตร์สุดแนวเพื่อกู้ชื่อของโรงเรียนโดยใช้ฝูงซอมบี้เป็นตัวประกอบจำเป็น...

...เอิ่ม... 

เอาเป็นว่าถ้าอยากจะเล่นให้สนุกก็จงอย่าคิดได้ใส่ใจกับเนื้อหา เพราะเนื้อหาของ Series นี้เป็นเหมือนกับ Parody ของเกมแนวซอมบี้ทั้งหมดที่มีอยู่เกลื่อนตลาด ตัวเกมจึงมีเนื้อหาเบา ๆ เอาฮาแทบจะหาสาระมิได้ กระนั้นถ้าคุณชอบเหล่าเทพธิดาจากภาคหลัก คุณก็คงจะชอบเกมนี้อยู่ดี เพราะจุดขายก็คือเหล่าเทพธิดาสุดโมเอ้ของเราที่มากันพร้อมหน้าในชุดนักเรียน ม.ปลาย แม้แต่ Uzume, Plutia กับ Peashy ก็ยังมีบทในภาคนี้ แถมด้วย Dengekiko, Famitsu จาก Nep U และตัวละครใหม่จาก Tamsoft ผู้พัฒนาเกม (ที่ผมสารภาพตามตรงว่าค่อนข้างจะชอบเป็นการส่วนตัว)

ด้วยเหตุที่จุดขายหลักของเกมก็คือการได้ควบคุมเหล่าเทพธิดาทั้งหลายจาก Nep Series ถ้าคุณไม่ใช่คอซีรีย์นี้ ผมก็แนะนำให้เลี่ยง เพราะอรรถรสในการเล่นของคุณคงจะลดน้อยถอยลงไปมากพอสมควร

[b] อะไรที่ทำให้เกมนี้ต่างจาก Nep U ? [/b]

- ระบบต่อสู้ในภาพรวมถือได้ว่าดีกว่า Nep U มาก ๆ ในทุก ๆ ด้าน ไม่มี Service ด้วยชุดขาด (แต่ก็มีชุดรุ่งริ่งจาก Nep U ให้เปลี่ยนใส่ได้) และคุณสามารถปรับแต่งรูปลักษณ์ตัวละครได้หลากหลายกว่า Nep U มากพอสมควร
- คุณสามารถที่จะ Co-op กับเพื่อน ๆ ของคุณได้ถึง 4 คนในโหมด Multiplayer (นับเป็นโหมดที่โหด มันส์ ฮาเอาเรื่องถ้าคุณมีเพื่อนเล่นด้วย)
- ฉากหลังของเกมคือมิติใหม่ ที่เหล่า CPUs ทั้งหลายได้เข้าเรียนและมีศัตรูร้ายคือเหล่าซอมบี้ และแน่นอนว่ามี Blanc เป็นตัวเอก
- เอกลักษณ์เฉพาะที่น่าสนใจก็คือตัวละครที่คุณเลือกใช้ ""อาจจะ"" ส่งผลให้บทสนทนาในแต่เทคที่คุณจะได้พบเปลี่ยนไป

[b] ได้ยินว่าตัวเกมเปี่ยมไปด้วยปัญหา ? [/b]

ณ ปัจจุบัน (ตุลาคม 5, 2016) ตัวเกมมีปัญหาทางเทคนิคให้ได้เจอพอสมควร ไม่ว่าจะเป็นส่วนของการแสดงผล (บางคนปรับเต็มจออาจจะค้าง) หรือระบบ Multiplayer ที่ทำเกมล่ม ต้องยอมรับว่าตัวเกมพอร์ตมาไม่สู้จะสมบูรณ์สักเท่าใดนัก กระนั้นปัญหาส่วนใหญ่ก็สามารถแก้ได้ไม่ยากโดยอาศัยคำแนะนำขอเหล่าผู้เล่นด้วยกันใน Forum ของ Steam และสามารถเล่นจนจบได้ 100% แต่ก็หวังว่าทีมพัฒนาจะมาแก้ปัญหาเหล่านี้ให้ได้ไม่ช้าก็เร็วนะ

[b] สรุป [/b]
ถ้าเป็นแฟนบอยของ Nep Series ก็จงกดเสียอย่าได้รอช้า 100 / 10 ไม่ผิดหวังอย่างแน่นอน ทว่าสำหรับเกมเมอร์ทั่วไป ผมก็ยังคงแนะนำให้เล่นภาคหลักเสียก่อน ถ้าชอบค่อยกลับมาสอยเกมนี้ก็ยังคงไม่สายนะ",1475607913,1475607913,True,12,0,0.671308994293212891,6,True,False,False,False,,,

As of version 1.09 (Halloween patch release) all major issues and annoyances have been solved. (I'm keeping this up as a negative as it lists the initial issues and the days that they were fixed (and broken again, and fixed again) rather than shifting it to a recommended title. I always look at the negatives first and seeing these issues along with a timeline of when they were dealt with seems more useful to a prospective customer than yet another review comparing this to Neptunia U.

Edits will be added to the bottom of this review as things change, original will be preserved at the top, scroll down for current information.

If you liked Neptunia U you're going to like this as well.

Great game, buggy as all hell on PC.

It's a fresh release, so I suppose it's to be expected, but when I switch to full screen and everything goes black (there are other bugs, and some Vita legacy showing through with the graphics, but that black screen thing is the only one that's a real issue and not just nitpicking) I can't recommend this game...

Yet.

They'll fix it, and when they do it'll be worth it, but I'd say hold off for now.

EDIT 5th October:
There has been an update pushed, the crashing has stopped, but the black screen and minor freezes when the resolution switches back to 720p between every intro video is still there. Not quite there yet, but much more stable now than it was when I first installed it.

EDIT 8th October:
All crashing is gone, multiplayer works (but people bounce in and out of rooms like crazy and hardly anyone is online) now, the only issue is the wonky intro videos making it go nuts jumping between fullscreen and black boxes, but once you get through the intro and to the start page there's now nothing wrong with it.

EDIT 17th October:
Crashing again, seemingly at random, during the initial launch when screen jumps between native resolution and 720p black box hanging in the corner of the desktop. Works perfectly once you're to the menu, it's just the intro credits that are causing issues.

EDIT 19th October:

Crashing gone again, online play (if you can find someone in there) works, only weird resultion issues with into cinematics remains.

EDIT 26th October:

Blanc now says ""Trick or Treat"" in the menu. I'm not seeing any other differences. Resolution issues still present, but crashing has not come back. Game is currently stable, both offline and on, but the lobby is always deserted.

EDIT 31st October:

Resolution issues have been fixed. Game now plays pefrectly from launch to exit. Online multiplayer works, but is still pretty deserted, and single player has zero (at least that I've encountered) issues remaining.",1475594190,1491017175,False,63,4,0.618615806102752686,20,True,False,False,False,,,

+画面：对话的画面依旧优秀，但是战斗场景久比较差劲了，虽然人物建模在900P下没有什么狗牙（你们一定招募了那个起动战士MOD界的平滑帝了把）总的来说对比之前出的几部作品来说完全没用心！
+联机：人很少，中文会显示乱码，但是繁体字又不会时乱码。相对于单机部分的画面来说，联机时的人物模型狗牙非常明显，明明设置都是一样的！
+打击感：连招连贯了一些，需要带上脑子玩，不像U那样无脑无双了。虽然战斗手感比U好了不少，但是感觉组合技能、必杀技的PC键位不怎么好按。
+优化：可惜可贺，这次WIN10没有跳出、没有假死可见官方是努力了，但是载入画面和OP结束时FPS波动剧烈1-60跳，还好战斗时不会出现这种情况。
+惊喜：总算见到了一些新造型的怪物

1、本作有官方中文的、日语的，然而PC没有，日本人到现在还是认为外国人只会英语么？明明这个系列在中文区也有不弱的销量。（毕竟我大天朝是世界第二大日呆国家）

Pros:
-4 player online co-op, you can finally play this game with people instead of solo.
-The ability to kick people out of your lobbies online.
-The usual many different costumes.
-You can reset your stats when ever you want, so if you want to go full glass cannon, and then tanky for a fight that hurts much more you can.  You can also realize just how useless getting that much tec is on most characters.
-Zombies

Cons:
-Region locked multiplayer (If you don't have friends, good luck ever getting into a game).  If you have a different download region than the host you simply get instant kicked on joining their game.
-Online rank system could do with some explaining, currently SSS on all avaliable missions, rank 8/10.  Buddy had the same rank as me on every mission and was 6/10 instead of 8/10, which made no sense.
-Zombies (so many games with zombies now, some people are just tired of zombies).

如果发现多人游戏搜索房间出现游戏未响应，大家试试自己单开一个多人游戏进去打完，保存之后在搜索房间就不会未响应了。（不完全有效）
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
首先说明一下，鄙人算不得这个系列的真爱粉。
今天是游戏发售的第一天，本体41%OFF，捆绑包36%OFF的首周促真是好顶赞。虽然明知道是炒冷饭还是入手。毕竟如果下次折扣大概也就是冬季特卖了。到时候不论是回本还是其他都感觉慢了太多。
其实也是因为今天是发售的原因（不要问10.4的评论还要说是才发售，，麻烦自己复习时区概念）游戏本身没有官方汉化。可能是因为大法那边的问题，很多宝石V上移植的游戏都没有官中，但是宝石V本身是有中文的。其次，游戏说明上写了支持多人游戏，但联机上似乎有些问题，经常搜索房间时会出现未响应。其次要说明的是虽然说包含STEAM集换式卡牌。但不知道是什么原因（可能是地雷社还没做好吧）今天还是没有的哦。
如果各位信仰不是太足，那么购买本体其实很超值。DLC的话是PC主题，但是因为各种原因所以是美声福利（主题的各种语音都是英文的）。诸位日系死宅，如果接受不了美声的话，还是死了这条心吧。
--------------------------------------------
游戏本身是ACT割草游戏，和U类似，可以为角色换装。但本座的怪物被替换为各色僵尸。比较有意思的是僵尸可以把脑袋丢出来攻击。。。这个设定真是颠覆三观。。。游戏本身依旧是日式动漫萌系画风。没有过多血腥暴力内容。僵尸也走的萌系路线，期待各种血腥猎奇的朋友可以死心了。

-มีระบบใหม่ support ระหว่างต่อสู้  ต้องกดใช้เอา IF + Compa 
-ของในร้านค้า ราคากำลังดีไม่แพงไป แต่ต้องขยันทำเควส เอาตัง
-เสียง English ตัวละครในเกม บางตัวดูแปลกๆ ไปนิด กว่าที่เคยฟัง มีตัวละครใหม่เพิ่มเข้ามา Tamsoft
-ดูเหมือนว่า พวกท่าทาง ตอนที่ตัวละครพูด จะหายไป อ่ะน่ะ พวกยกมือจิ้มแก้มของ Nep ไรงี้

-Co-po เล่นกับเพื่อนได้ แต่จะมีเพื่อนเล่นด้วยเปล่านี่สิ 55 ชอบๆ

this game is like hyperdimension neptunia: U action unleash but no costume break and more character
but fear not, you can choose broke costume before you play
too bad no costume break scenes tho :(

i don't know about others but i have loading issues here. the loading is very slow and screen frozes when loading. i have samsung 850 evo ssd and have no problem with the other game.

for dlc, i do not recommend you to buy deluxe pack. i see no benefit in it, the artwork practically can be found on internet and the support character isn't good at all. if you want to buy it for soundtrack, well its up to you lol

overall the game is good, it run smooth (60 fps on 1920x1080) and has no problem besides loading. for $10 bucks its really worth it, no regrets

Dengekiko：是你妹妹说的。

Neptune：我妹妹说的就是真的了？你们媒体啊，还是要注意一点，不要“见得风，是得雨”，接到这些消息，你们媒体本身也要判断，明白这意思吗？即使这些完全无中生有的东西，你再帮他们说一遍，你等于——你也有责任吧。

Dengekiko：现在那么早你们就是说支持Blanc，会不会给人一种感觉就是内定啊，钦点Blanc呢？

Neptune：没任何意思，这还是得按照游戏业界的……按照基本法，按照选举的法去产生……（拿着布丁的左手向前平伸）

Neptune：刚才你问我啊，我可以回答你“无可奉告”，但你们又不高兴，那怎么办？我讲的意思不是我钦点Blanc当主角。你问我滋瓷不滋瓷，我说滋瓷，我就明确地告诉你。

Dengekiko：能不能说一下为什么支持Blanc？

Neptune：我很抱歉，我今天是作为一个长者跟你们讲。我不是新闻工作者，但是我见得太多了。我有这个必要好告诉你们一点人生的经验。刚才我很想啊，我每次碰到你和Famitsu，我就讲，紫曜之都有一句话叫“闷声吃布丁”。我什么话也不说，这是坠吼的。但是我想我见到你们这样热情啊，一句话不说也不好。所以刚才你一定要，在宣传上将来如果你们报道上有偏差，你们要负责。我没有说要钦定，没有任何这个意思。但是你一定要问我对Blanc支持不支持，我们不支持她？她现在在超次元游戏的死宅粉丝中人气相当高的，我们怎么能不支持人气王？对不对？

Dengekiko：但是如果说当主角呢？

Neptune：当主角也要按照游戏业界的法律啊，对不对？要按照白露之滨的...当然我们的决定权也是很重要的。白露之滨是紫曜之都的铁杆盟友，到那时候我们会表态的。明白这意思吧？你们啊，不要想喜欢弄个大新闻，说现在已经钦定了，就把我批判一番，你们啊 naive！I am angry！你们这样子是不行的，我今天是得罪了你们一下。",1475550322,1508067394,True,264,675,0.866883456707000732,71,True,False,False,False,,,

Verdict: It's a good break from the main series and there are tons of new combos that you seriously need to learn about rather than just mash random buttons, but the only problem with this game that it's a little too short which is a downside for me.

有了锁定之后经常闪避到BOSS下一击的位置Orz

第一个大boss单挑完成，就是OP里面那个，打他太简单了，一句话：接下来，臀部很有用
第二个拿剑的高达boss，体型太大难以预判动作，破绽难找，需要拉开距离等待其出招硬直。只能修脚，绕后和贴脸都会后跳(有伤害判定)远离你ORZ，提升等级后属性就可以碾过去了2333（但是仍需要一定技巧）
第三、四个大boss分别是双刀和大锤高达，打法就是要谨慎，没别的了
后面的两个boss分别是数码暴鸟和数码豹，鸟的话注意要勾引它奔走，这样它必定会在停下后甩尾，这时在其身下输出，但是不要贪刀，小心其接下来的转体；数码豹的左后腿的左后方是个弱点，在那原地输出它很有可能蹬右腿或者右甩身，但是不是很容易打到你
最后的boss，原罪...这真的不是一个绅(hen)士(tai)么，打这个boss近战不能贪刀，建议拿技能磨血+规避攻击。它攻击力蛮高的，我满防御力都被打了大管血走。

领取箱子里有个是给50000属性点AP的，我拿到以后把所有人物的防御升满，combo解锁完毕了，真是爽
当然里面大部分都是解锁角色衣服的，这种箱子的领取材料前期能在不少小怪身上刷到，后期都是特定boss爆的，具体可以查阅掉落表

小药瓶限量10个，中药瓶限量5个，剩下的带了也没用，正常等级打boss的话小药瓶一般都喝不完的，要调出菜单（BACK键）喝药
总体来说好好玩啊，真想拉朋友一起玩~

[h1]战斗方面[/h1]
连招比起U来说有了大改动
很多人物都不能无脑连击再接闪避了，闪避后有一定硬直
相比于U的手感来说，如同魂2与魂3的差距那样吧，玩过U之后明显感觉这作人物有点得小儿麻痹症了23333

在这里说一下，多人游戏比较适合新手玩的肯定是涅普迪姆；贝露比较适合新手玩的，其女神化适合新手游玩；涅普姬雅的女神化是最适合新手的；另外诺瓦露的女神化也适合新手游玩
[h1]注意：所有女神化均不能无脑循环连招了，一定要记得打完脱离[/h1]

[h1]涅普迪姆[/h1]招式有巨大改变，首先需要连招lv.1才能学会U的招牌技nep groove，而且转完后无法闪避取消硬直，但是升级combo后可以接重击飞天，这时候可以空中闪避脱离；
女神化后与U完全不同，首先攻击范围缩小至面朝方向的180°，然后需要通过接重击飞上天来进行闪避
[h1]贝露[/h1]虽然不能无脑突刺了，但是可以先打一下然后突刺，再闪避循环，中间依旧是无缝衔接，没有硬直的，只是咸鱼突刺久了就不准了，感觉就是瞎鸡巴乱窜23333；
女神化后相较于U的原地耍枪，此作中攻击会带有小型前进位移，而攻击范围保留，相当好用。接重击连招完闪避脱离。
[h1]涅普姬雅[/h1]连招跟U没多大区别，可以照常使用，；
女神化基本连招不变，攻击带有非常大的惯性，不过由于起手快，无需重击后闪避，而是连招完毕直接闪避再次循环。最适合新手使用，没有之一。

新角色非常爽，真的。至于神次元的角色尝试了一下，怎么说呢，最低难度都没打过去，因为连招太简单，而且出招收招都很慢和诡异，导致不容易操作2333
而且那两位招式粘性非常重，就算是打完后立刻闪避也容易被打到
[h1]普露露[/h1]本体跑得最慢，闪避距离最短，攻击范围小且较慢但是攻击力大，在combo全解锁后，地面连招打完会上一个防御BUFF，在空中打完连招会有一个攻击BUFF。感兴趣的可以练习一下~
女神化后攻击范围大且方式鬼畜，轻击重击交替按就会攻击两次就变动一次位置，可谓“雨 露 均 沾”，割草非常厉害；另外攒EXE槽非常快，平砍一直在原地，打boss很有用
[h1]PC[/h1]本体也是以萌为主，也就是范围颇小而已，说缺点的话也不大，说优点也不多，卖萌倒是真·优点
女神化攻击粘性高但是位移大，而且拳刃攻速快，实际上连起来比较安全。

最后作为主角的[h1]布大锤[/h1]...
哎呀，该怎么说呢，拿着大锤攻击距离还没有涅普迪姆长
范围也较小，连招粘性也重，可能不太适合新手
但是技能刷EXE槽异常得快，割草必备
女神化后攻击范围与U相比变小，并且不是很安全，应灵活使用

你说[h1]诺瓦露[/h1]？本体连招跟U基本没变，一样的废材，一样的味道orz
女神化后连招基本不变，但是重击有所改变，是砸地+短剑气，可以无脑重击+闪避循环刷怪，平砍有所改善，相较于本体是质的飞跃吧。只是个人不太推荐大家无脑连，这样游戏乐趣会少很多

[h1]尤妮[/h1]战术动作做得很好，又可爱又帅，有种就是在特种部队训练过的那种感觉。就是平时打起来不太好操纵射击方向和战术规避方向。
女神化后重击的粘着性削弱了不少，以前是小黑洞，现在更像是鬼印珠。其他的话没啥特色，射击方向的操作仍然是苦手

[h1]萝姆[/h1]本体一般
女神化后能奶能打，大招攒的快，用的人蛮少的
[h1]拉姆[/h1]
拉姆的招式也变化不大，但是重击可以蓄力——辣麼大的锤子！旋风斩！萌得我生活不能自理。多了个BUFF技能，暂时提升攻击力和防御力
女神化后普通攻击无法穿透了，但是普通攻击接重击的冰之长矛挥击效果非常出众

[spoiler]3个我不太想玩的角色：电击子、Fami通和天王星
电击子，这种PVP型角色割什么草嘛，大招还开星爆弃疗斩
Fami通连招改变之后打起来感觉有点别扭了，不太想用她了
天王星这种打击感暴强(连招里面几乎都可以蓄力)，放大直接“欧拉欧拉欧拉”的DJ(真的既视感满满)，我选择 [strike]哦，在这停顿！[/strike]
反正如果有空我会详细评测一下的[h1](字数限制到了，我选择拒绝更新这几个角色的评测了TAT)[/h1][/spoiler]

[h1]（各角色女神化需要自己在角色选择页面进行选择，或者在装备页面切换至该角色女神化状态后退出）[/h1]

总之这次移植我一直很期待的，玩到以后算是蛮满意的，就是不知道联机会不会受到什么阻碍orz
这作初期难度相比于U来说难度提升很多，其中原因多半是角色大幅度削弱和BOSS韧性提高，后期防御属性上去后基本上就是硬肛boss磨血了，但是可玩性还是比U强得多
这个游戏要正常连招与技能相配合，技能输出并且利用其极长的无敌帧，然后用连招压制，以争取CD时间，不可以尝试无脑连招。这也算是解决了U刷怪无聊的问题了吧Orz
另外这次IF似乎鼓励玩家在空中规避敌人啊，毕竟本作所有角色都可以在空中进行闪避，并且大部分收招都是会往天上飞。

[h1]注意事项：
一、在游戏进行有人中途加入的话，你有可能会无法退出游戏并进入结算页面，这个情况各异，我是在日本下载区里，有些人游戏中中途进入房间并没有导致我出不去游戏，但是有些人加进来就会。可能是跟个人网络状况有关。

二、联机游玩是按照steam下载区来分配玩家的，而我在中国下载区一进入房间就停止工作，日本下载区完全没这问题，已确认跟中文ID无关

三、目前全屏后跳logo和op依旧会卡顿，建议大家无边框化或者窗口化游玩~

四、多人游戏不能随时手动存档，只能打完一局后在结算页面提示存档时存档（这个设计真是有毒）

And for the people mentioning workarounds, fixes, and graphic card driver settings- don't care.   If a game is releasing for 30 USD, it should work.  These are basic settings that even indie devs typically can manage; a studio with 5+ releases on steam should have that handled by now.

MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies เป็นอีกภาคของซีรีย์ Neptunia ที่เป็นแนว Hack and Slash โดยเน้น High Speed Action(ฟันๆเร็วๆ คอมโบเร็วๆรัวๆ) เหมือนภาค Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed และในภาคนี้ก็มี Tamsoft (ที่ทำ Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus , Onechanbara Z2: Chaos ซึ่งวางขายแล้วใน Steam) มาเป็นส่วนหนึ่งใน Developer ด้วยเช่นกัน และยังเป็นภาคไม่ได้เป็นภาคต่อจากภาคไหนเลย(Spin-off) เป็นเนื้อเรื่องใหม่ทั้งหมด โดยดาวเด่นของภาคนี้ซึ่งแน่นอนว่าคือ Blanc(White Heart) CPU แห่ง Lowee นั้นเอง ! 

โดยรวมแล้วระบบการเล่นส่วนใหญ่ของภาคนี้เหมือนกับภาค Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed อยู่หลายจุด หลักๆที่เหมือนกันก็คือฟันๆ คอมโบรัวๆ เข้าถล่มฝูงมอนสเตอร์ , ระบบสวมใส่อุปกรณฺ์-อาวุธ , ระบบ Lily Rank แต่ก็มีจุดที่ไม่เหมือนอยู่ เช่น มีการดำเนินเนื้อเรื่องเป็น Scene แต่ละ Scene , ระบบการซื้อ-ขาย ไอเท็มซึ่งในภาค U ไม่มี , ระบบ Fuse ไอเท็ม , ระบบ Online Co-op (ข้ามแพลตฟอร์มไม่ได้) สามารถชุบชีวิตเพื่อนที่ HP เหลือ 0 ในขณะต่อสู้ได้อีกด้วย , ระบบ Ranking , ระบบ Support ที่ช่วยเพิ่มความสามารถในขณะต่อสู้ , ระบบ Treasure , มีการเก็บค่า AP(Ability Point) เพื่อเอามาใช้อัพเกรด Ability ให้กับตัวละครได้ ซึ่งจะประกอบไปด้วยค่า HP , POW , DEF , TECHNIC อีกทั้งภาคนี้อาจจะเป็นที่เสียดายของบางคน นั้นก็คือ[u]ระบบเสื้อขาดแบบในภาค Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed โดนตัดออกไปในภาคนี้แล้ว[/u] แต่ๆๆๆๆ อย่าพึงเสียใจ อย่างน้อยในเกมก็ยังมีพวกเสื้อผ้าชุดขาดๆ ให้เลือกใส่ให้กับตัวละครได้อยู่ครับ

ว่ากันด้วยเรื่องของตัวละครทั้งหมดในภาคนี้ มีทั้งหมด 14 คนด้วยกัน ซึ่งมาพร้อมด้วยเครื่องแบบชุดนักเรียนกันทุกคน ระดับ Seniors มีทั้งหมด 7 คน ได้แก่ Blanc , Neptune , Noire , Vert , Uzume , Plutia , Tamsoft(มาใหม่ในภาคนี้) ระดับ Juniors มีทั้งหมด 4 คน ได้แก่ Nepgear , Uni , Dengekiko , Famitsu สุดท้ายระดับ Freshmen มีทั้งหมด 3 คน ได้แก่ Rom , Ram , Peashy

ส่วนเรื่องระบบการเล่นของตัวเกม โดยรวมแล้วไม่ซับซ้อน เข้าใจได้ง่ายเหมือนภาค Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed อีกทั้งในเรื่องของ Achievement โดยรวมแล้วยังจะเก็บง่ายกว่าของภาค Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed อีกด้วย

[h1]สรุปโดยรวม[/h1]
พอร์ตออกมาได้ดีครับ ตัวเกมรองรับ Full HD 60 FPS (แต่บางคนก็มีปัญหาเรื่องปรับขนาดหน้าจอภายในเกมอยู่บ้าง) ควบคุมการบังคับด้วยจอย XBOX 360 ได้ง่ายเหมือนเดิมและภาคนี้ยังใช้พื้นที่ในการติดตั้งเกมน้อยเหมือนภาค Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed ด้วย ในเรื่องของราคาลดลง 40 เปอร์แล้ว สำหรับใครที่ชอบสไตล์การเล่นภาค Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed ผมว่าคุ้มค่าครับสำหรับเงินที่จะจ่ายให้แก่ภาคนี้ครับ บวกกับใครที่มีงบพอ แล้วเป็นแฟนซี่รีย์เกมนี้หรือชื่นชอบ Blanc เป็นพิเศษ เหมาะมากๆที่จัดแบบ Deluxe Edition เลยครับ

Что можно сказать о игре?
По сути мы видим похожую на нептунию U игру с доработками и новыми плюшками
Из плюсов:
Новые всеми любимые персонажи  Пиши, Узуме, Плутия и совершенно новый персонаж Тамософт
Мультиплеер - да в игре есть полноценный онлайн мультиплеер, набераем группу из 4 человек, берем миссию и идем проходить 
Хочется выделить систему чата в онлайне, имеются заготовленные полностью озвученные фразы для каждого персонажа что очень необычно.
Кастомизация персонажа (как в Сенран Кагуре) можем брать любой предмет и прикреплять его куда угодно меняя его размер по желанию)
Использование навыков упростилось, теперь вместо шкалы используется простой откат навыков по времени.
Из минусов:
Сингл - он уныл и однообразен, сюжет скучен, каждая миссия похожа на предыдущую.
Прокачка - максимальный лвл в игре 99 и чтобы его быстрее достичь нужно гриндить его на одной миссии снова и снова
Количество миссий в мультиплеере - Их мало.. достаточно пару часов чтобы их все пройти.
В отличии от U тут нет никаких других режимов помимо сюжета и онлайна.


В целом для любителей нептунии и просто любителей поиграть весело с друзьями игра вполне подойдет.

I highly suggest getting a controller though, because for once, we have a Nep Game that requires full use of the controller.

So far I've had fun with it, it's got a bit of the usual humor you would expect, and brings a few new characters too. Apart from that, it's the usual Nep game with hack and slash combat instead, and the attention going to the best CPU ever.

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that I've seen more panty shots than I have killed enemies, so 10/10.

Edit: Multiplayer has some issues now and then but most of them seem to only be temporary and tend to be solved after a pc restart. The game has a decent variety of chat options you can use, but it's still pretty restrictive if you want to communicate what you want to do. There's not a whole lot to do after a few days, but it's definitely a great game for playing with friends and strangers. Getting a 5k hit combo is a pain in the rear but it can be done. Most the other achievements just require working on the game and progressing through it, and there's no need for pointless restarts of your game just for the sake of another ending.

-----------------------------------------------------------
For Non-Neptunia Fan Read Here
-----------------------------------------------------------

- This game is spin-off and not related to the main series.

- This game genre is ""Beat 'em up"" like Warriors/Musou Series from Koei.

- There's leveling system but it's not complicated, just adding status in Atk, Def, HP, and Combo. 

- Clunky/bad camera control (For me, this one was the worst part that ruined my gameplay exp)

- So-so story. The selling point is still comedy but it may hard to catch up if you don't know 
character and their personality from the original game.

- Gameplay length is short. There are only 12 chapters and took around 30 sec - 3 mins in each mission. (Might take a little bit longer in later chapters)

- Very small maps, more like you're fighting in arena in different environment.

- 4 players co-op (but sill has bug and keep crashing atm)

-----------------------------------------------------------
In Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------

- This game is average beat 'em up.  

- Would recommend if you are not serious about simple gameplay and better if you have friend to play with

- Wouldn't recommend if you love action game with complicated combat system.

- Wouldn't recommend if this will be your first Neptunia game.

[h1] Story Summary [/h1]
To put it in a much more simplistic way, due to the population of humans being decreased dramatically (obiously they were pointing out what the situation is in Japan) school is about to CLOSE! Together with Blanc and the others, they will be filming a zombie movie to save the school.

[h1] Multiplayer [/h1]
Yeap, the main core of the game and also the first Neptunia game with Multiplayer (Co-op) experience. Is it good? Overall, I would say the combat system feels good, controls are not too complicated so every nep fans can get on to it easily. AI are much more smarter than Action U that's for sure. And yeah, EPIC BOSS BATTLE!

Of course there were some balancing issues, some characters are just way too OP. After one week or so, everyone is going to stick to that one character on almost every match even its a maxed out Lv99. The quest are going to be repetitive as well, I can assure you that in 2 weeks time someone is going to clear every single quest in Multiplayer...

BUT STILL, it is worth the money, especially when you have friends to play with. Spending a few hours with fellow nep fans, getting a chance to find new friends to add on Steam is definitely one of its charm <3

[h1] Is the port good? [/h1]

No issues with performance or translation after completing the first 4 chapters. Resolution scales up to 4k+, runs  at 60fps and options for both Japanese and English audio languages. One minor full screen bug which can be worked around by using windowed mode to set screensize first. Yet to try multiplayer which is main selling point, there were no players available so I will report back later today. Won't go on about the story but rest assured it's packed full of the usual memes and fourth wall breaking. Isn't for everyone and personally I did feel this game took it a little be too far at times.

Keep in mind there is very little action between the long drawn out visual novel segments, which is normal for nep games but seems worse then usual.  For the discounted price (17.99usd) I would still recommend it. Mostly to fans of the previous games, for others I would suggest starting on the rebirth series or perhaps just picking up U. Cheers.

El performance del juego es impecable, 60fps estables en todo momento, los controles todo perfecto, asi que es un buen port almenos en mi caso ya que anteriores juegos de la saga me daban bajones cuando no deberian el cual se solucionaba activando el triple bufer.
