You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/1Wr0o9FI8Ac

This is a stand-still 360 wave shooter. You basically clear out the enemies in one area and then you fade out and fade in unto the next area. The visuals are pretty bland, from boring environments to blocky enemy models. The shooting mechanic is rather rudimentary - it doesn't feel realistic or engaging. It feels like you're shooting a nerf laser gun as bullets travel slowly. You can either dodge projectiles or block them with your hand shields. 

The good news is that there is quite a bit of enemy variety for a free to play wave shooter. There's even two boss fights (although one of them is more a puzzle than a boss fight). However, it's pretty light on content. Whole game lasts 10-20 minutes, depending on your skill level and there is no replayability.

I can't say I had fun. Other people seemed to have enjoyed this game more than I did.

If you're low on cash and needing a fix of VR shooting, then look no further than RAYGUN COMMANDO, an on-rails, stage-based sci-fi shooter that lasts roughly 15 minutes per complete playthrough. There's no story, but you pretty much just have to defend your spaceship from the onslaught of invaders that are trying to board it. You get one gun and infinite ammo, though you do have to keep reloading, and once you've dealt with all of the enemies on one stage, you're instantly transported to the next.

What the game lacks in aesthetic variety between stages, it makes up for with a decent soundtrack and genuinely fun gameplay. There are only a few different enemy models, but there's also a boss battle near the end of the game. Not to mention, there are actually zero-g physics during a couple stages. There is no locomotion, so you must dodge incoming attacks or deflect projectiles with your gun. If you get tired of arcade mode, there's even a 2 minute time attack mode.

RAYGUN COMMANDO is as good as it gets when it comes down to a free shooting title. The developer is still active in the forums, and although the game released in January 2017, there was an update as recently as August 2017 at the time of writing. This title shows clear love from its developer, and hopefully in the future we will see some amazing paid content that elaborates on their game creating skills, but for that to happen more enemy and location diversity would be essential, as well as a longer campaign mode. Keep up the great work!

I guess I should quickly review this game and describe what you are signing up for if you install this game.
I am pretty sure this is the game that they play in Hell for all eternity.

The game consists of rooms and corridors. You spawn in the middle of a ""scene"" where you have a second or two to look around before the enemy turns around and shoots your dead at point-blank range before you have to start from first level to repeat the procedure. The enemy placement never varies, it is the same every time. There is no cover mechanic, as you spawn in the middle of the corridor and you can not move more than your static room-scale play area you set in room-scale setup. There is only one anaemic-sounding weapon in the game. You can fire a few shots before a new magazine appears in your hand and the old one disappears. Of course there is no indication of this other than there is no (weak and anaemic) pew when you pull the trigger. When you take a hit the view flashes bright red and the obstruction stays there for a second or two, making it incredibly difficult to see anything. You can take a few hits before you are thrown to ""tutorial room"" that shows a slideshow of instructions and then teleports to level 1 again. 

If you look at the teaser video, it literally shows you the first two ""levels"" of the game. 
Yes, that is right, you  are a floating gun that shoots a few enemies, screen fades out, you shoot a few more enemies in a slightly different setting, screen fades... That is literally all there is to the game. This gets incredibly boring about 30 seconds. It does not help that the projectiles look like green tennis balls that take around 3 seconds to reach the target. I did not waste my time for more than a few levels, fighting against the urge to fall asleep.

A tip of the hat to the developers/developer of this game.Yeah, pretty awesome. Felt like I was stuck in an old arcade game... wait a sec, I think that's Disney Copyright... and so it should be :)
Great dodgeplay, and maybe a bit too addictive. Needs a bit of polish...or grit (hint hint), but gameplay makes up for it, by far. Abit hard-core for casual players, but also a nice game to turn noobs into shooter lovers. I was looking around for a (mindless) fun rail-shooter : This game is better then a rail-shooter, and it's not mindless.

Easy to review because it's instant fun : You can't go wrong by trying this one out.

PS : Works on my Windows 7 + Oculus Touch, with just the usual non-support issue resulting in the Touch controllers pointing 90° downwards towards the ground (so you have to hold them pointing 90° upwards to make up for it).

For a free game I'm actually thoroughly impressed.  I picked this up thinking it would be the dumb usual shovelware for Vive, but considering it's free, it's not bad.  Having taken only 15 minutes to beat, I definitely wouldn't pay more than 2$ for it.  However, the gameplay is surprisingly solid enough that if it were more than an hour long, I'd actually pay upwards of 5-10$ or so for it, which really isn't bad.  The game runs remarkably smoothly compared to many worse-looking VR titles, the action is nice and responsive, and I felt immersed in the action.  
The game plays almost exactly like a classic arcade shooter.  And I don't mean ""arcade"" like a steam ""arcade"" game- I mean this actually feels like one of the classic rail shooters that you play with friends at an arcade, paying tokens and being rewarded tickets.  Surprisingly, very (VERY) few VR games actually take advantage of this type of game mechanic, clearly making the false assumption that it's not worth making it less immersive.  The action makes you feel badass enough that it's borderline silly (similar to arcades- as long as you have good aim, you can see all the opponents collapse in almost an instant).  Between the aesthetics, music, and action, this game feels *exactly* like a traditionalistic early 1980's sci-fi classic vibe.  
There are only two cons that I'd say are substantial:
1.  There are things that appear as fun, intimidating boss battles, of two kinds: A giant exosuit, and a powerful shielded knight.  Apparently, the giant exosuit isn't implemented in the game yet, since shooting it immediately brings you to the next area without any fight.  Although the shield knights would otherwise be badass, they go down in almost a single hit.
2.  The reloading system feels a bit dumb.  It's interesting- when you run out of ammo, a clip automatically appears in your non-dominant hand and you have to slap it into the gun.  This actually feels pretty cool.  However, seeing as how bare-bones it is, I'd rather just press a button.  I like it when vive games let you use only one controller.  In this game, you need to use the second controller, but solely for this one purpose that isn't even necessary.  

Overall, I've gone on too long seeing as this is a free game.  I'd say it's 1000% worth downloading and playing.  It's not spam, and I promise that it actually gave me a wholeheartedly FUN experience for a solid 20 minutes or so.

This is an awesome free game which I'd see no problem spending money on but the fact it's free is just great and it should be in everyone's game library.

It makes great use of the play area since there were very few moments I found myself standing still. There are always some bullets being fired your way which you will have to dodge. In that sense it's a little bit similar to Sairento VR.

On each level you will switch location and it makes it a much more enjoyable experience than what I imagine it otherwise would have been like.

Strategy is key here. You have to carefully decide which robot to shoot first at least that's what I found when playing some of the later levels.

Also reloading requires timing. You can't reload until you've empited a mag. That might sound dumb but it really makes the gameplay more difficult and as a result more fun.

The graphics are average. I mean, it's not amazing but it's not really that bad either.
