The right way is to combine great gameplay with real artwork and a contemporary instead of pitching a low effort deal and not reverting to the old and dead ""retro"" look to avoid having to hire an artist. 

The developers of SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect decided on the latter.

Gameplay - Terrible platformer with a clunky engine

Artwork - None - they opted for a slightly japanese looking 8 bit motif - it's old, tired, done, and dead but here they are rehashing it again as if it's somehow still cool and hipster to be retro.  It's not.

Engine - Some special comments on the game engine.  They decided to use an arcade emu for the game without permitting widescreen or even 4:3 graphics - so if you own a PC, this game will look terrible on it, and not just because of the terrible 8bit style.   You cannot change the engine and the controls aren't by default mapped to a keyboard or joystick, it expects a gamepad, which would be great if this was a console game but it's not.

Adopting a retro arcade 8-bit art style, the SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect, or Sword Justice Deluxe Selective Memory Erase Effect plays as a 2D platformer where you move your character, a mechanical android cat through different layers of fear clusters in order to reach an end terminal to log out and return to the real world where his link partner, M1Mi resides in.  Along the way, the cat meets many parts of the operating system that take a physical form as enemies.  In order to progress through the game, players must complete each level by moving their character from the left to the right; killing enemies along the way which will increase your score.  The developer has taken an extra step, whether intentional or not to bring the complete experience of a CRT arcade cabinet by featuring in-game screen brightness control for CRTs‚Äô, three button layouts found on cabinets and of course, infinite continues.

[h1] The Good	[/h1]

SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect follows true to the standard cabinet platformer.  To give an idea of how the game is like, think of the original metal slug, except your default weapon is a blade instead of a pistol.  Jumping, ducking, dodging, button mashing all the good mechanical components of cabinet games are retained in SWR JST DX SMEE and mesh really well to play a fun to play game.

SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect‚Äôs visuals are extremely well done.  For a game with only 256 different shades of colours to work with, this game manages to bring colourful visuals with unique background design for every chapter.  Although enemy mechanics and attack patterns were used in more than one type of enemy, each chapter of the game introduced new and special looking sprites for all the enemies.  

The difficulty of the game increases at a reasonable rate.  The first few chapters introduce players to the mechanics, and slowly become more demanding, such as throwing daggers while dodging and immediately air strafing in the opposite direction to slash an incoming enemy.  

The plot is based off of a good concept which actually revolves around an inner conflict that appears within the player. Taking a step back, you can see there are two sides of the story.  One of which is really evident to the player, the cat‚Äôs drive to log out of this nightmare and return to M1Mi.  But in order to reach the terminal, all the operating system enemies‚Äô have everything that they longed for destroyed.  Looking back into the dialogue between the main characters, reveals that the main antagonist isn‚Äôt even truly evil, but just someone whose ideals sided with the OS components. 

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

Let‚Äôs start with the game itself.  Mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm not sure whether or not the developer decided to bring about the whole experience of old arcade games including the problems, or was just simply limited by the game engine they are working with.  Please note, at the time of writing this review, the game cannot save, meaning each time you start the game up, you have to start from the very beginning.  The argument may be that the game is short and can be completed in one sitting, but it is just a poor excuse that a save function not be implemented, if high scores can be recorded.  SWR JST DX SMEE also has problems shutting down properly.  The window may close, but it hangs on steam locking you in-game.  In order to play your other games again you have to shut down steam and restart the client.
 
Level design is not the best, and is very evident in the ice chapter where you utilize the same run and gun strategy.  Progression between levels can be spontaneous and abrupt with no warning narrative as seen by the mine cart stage. The result is a lot of gimmicky level designs that force you to lose a life no matter what, unless you‚Äôve played through a second time.

The game itself is contradictory as to the scoring style.  2D side-scrolling platformer games like these usually are fast paced because they provide you with a ranged default weapon and unlimited ammunition.  Since SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect gives you a sword as a default weapon, you will often find yourself kiting backwards and staying just outside of the enemy hit range.  Anyone who has played a 2D side-scroller knows that going back the way you came from breaks the tempo of the game and since scoring is widely based off of number of enemies killed, you are forced to kill your enemies, making pacifist and speed runs totally redundant, not to mention impossible on some of the later levels. 

The plot itself is pretty shallow and leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes, the writer may have been going for a hero vs villain scenario, but nine lines of text between levels is not enough for the player to connect with the characters, leaving an empty and hollow characters.  It really is not enough for the player to judge the scenario correctly, and is hard to sympathize for the other cast of characters that are being antagonized. 

[h1] Overall Score [/h1]

As a complete package I rate Sword Justice Deluxe Selective Memory Erase Effect at 4/10.  This game is just too large of a hassle to get up and running and an even bigger annoyance when it comes to shutting down.   If you look at just the game, I would personally score this game at 6/10 just for the amazing visuals and good controls.  The reason it isn‚Äôt higher is because the game really falls short in terms of level design.  But if the game‚Äôs art piques your interest and your computer successfully passes the [url=https://nekomuragames.itch.io/swr-jst-dx-selective-memory-erase-effect] tech demo [/url], give this game a try.",1463928401,1536377846,False,8,0,0.592478096485137939,1,False,False,False,False,,1709976822.0,"Hi, thank you and sorry for the late reply.

Firstly, this game looks wonderful in action. Screenshots really don't do the lush backgrounds and fantastic digitized-looking sprite work justice.  The interstitial animations also look great, and there's a fairly memorable soundtrack backing everything.  This is a game that does not drop the ball at all with its presentation. 

Gameplay-wise, it's about as arcadey an experience as you can get. As a cute little robot ninja cat, you'll run, jump, slash, and throw daggers to overcome most of your obstacles, but the game's strength is the staggering amount of variety it manages to pack into all of its stages.  Nearly every world has a unique set of gimmicks and challenges to overcome and it's always shuffling you in and out of new situations so you never end up doing too much of the same thing for long.  

Each level is a fairly bite-sized affair, lasting roughly 30 seconds, and nearly all of them are fairly challenging (except the bosses. They're all chumps), but there's nothing that can't be overcome with a little persistence.  There are however a couple gimmicks that feel like they needed a bit more work.  The stages that drop your character into a boat with only a sword and some daggers to defend yourself don't feel properly balanced at all, and this is only emphasized later in the same world when you're able to equip your boat with a proper projectile weapon.  The mine cart stage a bit later in the game, though fairly short, is a nightmare of randomly generated nonsense that can create many impossible situations and was really a low point for me. 

Other than those niggling flaws, I had a blast with the game.  It'll take you just over a couple hours to see it to completion, and even though the overly easy boss encounters kind of make for an anti-climax, the storyline and stages leading up to them are definitely solid enough to stand on their own.",1447914234,1447914234,True,16,0,0.697645604610443115,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Una piccola avvertenza sulla sua particolare natura va fatta: il titolo in questione prende a ispirazione i vecchi platform in formato cabinato da sala giochi, ed √® quindi pensato esplicitamente per essere iniziato e finito in una sola run di circa un paio d'ore (con ""continua"" infiniti). Il titolo non stanca mai con una discreta variet√† di situazioni, livelli brevi e frequentemente (e sapientemente) intervallati dall'incalzare dialogico della trama. Sebbene sia dunque quest'ultima il motore trainante di tutta la genuinit√† di questa produzione, il comparto grafico risulta veramente di buon livello (gli screenshot dello store non rendono giustizia), ingraziosito da pixel art statiche (ma molto drammatiche!) per i momenti pi√π solenni come la sconfitta dei boss. E ora via con i contenuti: ""L'effetto della cancellazione selettiva della memoria"" tratta sotto una maschera di tenero sci-fi (che non pu√≤ non ricordare lo spielberghiano A.I. Artificial Intelligence) un tema molto delicato, e lo fa con estremo tatto e contemporaneamente con incisivit√†. A volte alcuni cari con cui avevamo particolarmente legato, con cui addirittura ci sentivamo in un rapporto di mutua interdipendenza, ci lasciano dopo un avvenimento drammatico soli, o meglio: gli ultimi ricordi della persona cara arrivano a monopolizzare la nostra esistenza, e sono ricordi di paura, addirittura panico. Un panico cos√¨ acuto da rimettere in discussione la capacit√† di sopportazione pi√π basilare, lasciandoci in un tunnel paralizzante di ""blocchi"" psicologici. E qui arriva l'idea grandiosa della simulazione della personalit√† altrui: cosa avrebbe fatto la persona cara davanti alla nostra perdita, ovvero la perdita... di se stessa? Le opzioni sono due: o lasciarsi andare alla pazzia, in cui ogni nostra funzione cognitiva si slega dall'insieme in una farsa che si regge a stento nella sua dimensione utopistica, consapevole dell'effimerit√† di questo stato; oppure andare a sbattere contro tutti i blocchi, e contro il nostro stesso spirito di autoconservazione, verso una destinazione ignota in cui la persona persa che vive dentro di noi e il noi dolente della stessa perdita andranno definitivamente persi. A che pro? La normalit√†. Anche se nell'immediato pu√≤ sembrare un enorme salto nel vuoto, il gioco punta a favore di una visione in cui questa √® il pi√π grande pegno di amicizia verso il caro che non c'√® pi√π, che ha bisogno di essere lasciato andare. Il gioco tratta cos√¨ di due tipi di perdite di memorie: la prima, quella che rende l'inconsapevole coraggioso e il consapevole codardo. La seconda, ancora pi√π positiva in tutto il pieno significato agentivo di ""selettiva"", consiste nell'accantonare nella quotidianit√† le paure elementari, relegandole a quello che sono: segnali di allarme esclusivamente contestuali, e non permanenti. SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect √® tutto questo, e la vostra memoria di certo non vi far√† lo scherzo di dimenticarlo in fretta.",1447806202,1447806202,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

My only main gripe is the minecart section. I spent an entire continue on it because the first obstacle was a jump...and there was always a boulder right above me. Incredibly frustrating because it just became luck at that point, hoping I didn't have to jump when there was a boulder coming down.

With that said, the player starts with plenty of lives, and there's infinite continues for those who don't care much for high-scores.

The game can be played through in an afternoon or less, which is fine, but there's no saving level progress, only score.  Another potential issue is that the game can hang after closing, leaving one's Steam status reading as in-game long after one has stopped.  It might be an issue with the Steam overlay, so a solution could be disabling that, maybe?  I haven't tried it, but since these issues aren't too terrible, I'm still satisfied with this purchase.",1446860922,1446860922,True,3,0,0.509041905403137207,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It even has the menu set up as an operator menu. It's pretty solid, my only gripe is that some of the platforms can be a little deceptive about where they end (turning your double jump into a single jump to your death...), otherwise though, it's a game you can play through in an afternoon. And you have to, as it has no save feature, only the ability to infinitely credit-feed. That said, it's forgiving enough. Any levels longer than a few screens seem to silently checkpoint themselves, there's no timer, and powerups are relatively frequent. The game changes tactics from world to world as well, so it doesn't run the risk of repetition.
