This isn't a 4X game at all. It's a browser-building game that, despite it's depth, still doesn't break itself free from it's grindy core.

You do not eXplore or eXterminate. There is no exploration whatsoever, the full map is revealed already. There's no extermination at all, since the community has taken a pretty ""pacifist"" attitude as to not scare new players away. You are seriously berated if you attack someone who is active in this game, veterans might gank on you if you decide to go that way repeatedly. For one, this is great if you're starting. Everyone gives you resources and everyone treats you nicely. However, if you are looking for a brawl later on, you'll find yourself terribly disappointed.

There's also, as you might have expected, not an ending. This is a game of YEARS. Not days, not months, YEARS. Just to get your first city going in this game takes weeks if you don't buy/use prestige.

I recommend this game for those who take and enjoy it as it is: a free, browser-based, spare-time, chat-room time-killer game. It's supposed to be played while you do other things, to distract you from time to time, not to be taken as a primary source of entertainment. I do not recommend it for people who don't like sitting for hours watching the paint dry while chatting with strangers.

Side note: If you expect something special about the Steam launcher, don't. Besides achievements, full screen, 5 tracks of music and improved chat room, there's nothing different from the browser version.

The good:

1. Lots of depth

2. Lots of planning to do if you want to really enjoy the game.

3. You can enjoy the game on a casual basis as well, especially if you are aiming at trading/crafting.

4. The community is very very helpful. Seriously, I've had no end of people offering advice or free resources.

5. The game is not P2W, at least not in a way that's comparable to any other free to play games I've played recently. There are elements that will allow you to grow faster, but you are still limited by resources and you cannot accelerate any of your troops or troop built times. It's very well balanced.

6. The game is a slow burn, so you can check in on it while you are at work, or que up build times so they finish when you are done work. It's not constantly demanding your attention.

The Bad:

From my perspective, it's really just the graphics and the tutorial that need to be improved. There is a lot not explained, that the Community has put together guides for. The devs could make it easier for people to find up to date resources through introduction emails. Other than that, the graphics are very dated, but for a game that moves at a slow pace, it's not a big deal. My only other complaint is that the developers should be releasing new updates for the game, as it appears it's been a few years since new features have been added.

TLDR: Good long-term slow moving strategy game, that you can spend hours each day or minutes each day playing. You can play the game in many different ways and the community is very helpful. Highly recommend if you like a game that you will be able to be playing for years to come.

И давно искал достойный ммо проект-статегию. В этой игре устойчивое ощущение, что концепт создавал талантливый человек, а реализовывал какой-то идиот. Пример 1) можно выращивать коров, делать из них кожаные доспехи для солдат; можно выращивать коней для конных отрядов. Звучит красиво. Вот только из коней доспех не сделать, поэтому корова стоит на рынке у игроков 400 монет, а лошадь 60. Плюс ограничение в одно пастбище в городе, которое не позволяет выровнять ситуацию за счет увеличения числа пастбищ для коров. Пример 2) можно варить пиво и делать вино из винограда. Звучит красиво. Вот только бочка пива стоит на рынке у игроков 300 монет, а бочка вина 1 600 000 (это не опечатка!). Как так! Где логика! Пример 3) На старте игры строишь трущобы, которые позволяют нанять отряд бомжей для сбора всякой всячины на глобальной карте. Эти бомжи собирают за сутки, например, 100 минералов, которые продаешь за 20 000 (по 200 каждый) другим игрокам. Но есть технология горного дела, которая открывает доступ к гильдии шахтеров, в которой их можно нанимать, а они судя по описанию должны собирать те же минералы быстрее + находить драгоценные камни и редкие минералы. Звучит красиво! Изучил технологию, построил гильдию шахтеров, а шахтеров нанять нельзя, т.к. для этого нужно исследовать геологию. Ок, выучил геологию, а шахтеров нанять нельзя, т.к. для обучения нужны книги, а для создания книг технология книгопечатания. Ок, выучил книгопечатания, построил мастерскую создания книг, сделал книги, нанял шахтеров, отправил собирать минералы. Шахтеры пришли к минералам и возвращаются обратно со словами -  а мы простые минералы собирать не умеем, можем только редкие минералы и драгоценные камни. Как так то! Но ладно, посылаю собирать редкие минералы и отряд шахтеров приносит мне через сутки один минерал стоимостью 1000 монет. Т.е. отряд бомжей почти бесплатных на старте приносят 20000, а шахтеры после всей этой эпопеи 1000. При этом чтобы построить гильдию шахтеров пришлось снести домик для бомжей ибо место ограничено для строительства в городе. Пример 4) Для создания копейщика нужно копье и кожаный доспех, что логично. Для лучника - лук и кожаный доспех. Для всадника - лошадь, седло  и, тут барабанная дробь, пиво! Да, Карл! Пиво! Ни копье, ни доспех. Пример 5) В игре есть осада и захват городов. Здорово! Вы можете воровать ресурсы, золото и вещи с помощью воров. Круто! И вот вы вычистили из брошенного игроком города все до последней монеты с помощью воров, перебили весь гарнизон армией, украли все ресурсы. Осталось захватить пустой город. Для этого понадобятся осадные орудия. Иначе никак. Да-да, чтобы захватить город без защитников нужны осадные орудия, которые сначала должны несколько дней сносить стены до уровня 0, а затем несколько дней уничтожать 70% зданий, чтобы захватить пустой город. Соответственно по итогу вы получаете город в руинах. И вишенка на торте: все здания требуют ресурса на содержание, что логично, но если у вас хотя бы на несколько минут закончится, например, еда, то все ваши здания в городе, которые вы несколько месяцев строили и прокачивали будут автоматически мгновенно снесены без возвращения ресурса на постройку - огонь!",1664130825,1669067792,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Thanks for the thumbs up for the game.  

Apart from your assertion that you ""throughly enjoyed"" playing Illyriad (with which we wholeheartedly agree)... literally everything else requires our response and corrections.

a) The player who you allege somehow hacked your account is named Kilgore, not ""Kilmore""

b) The alliance he belongs to (and you belonged to as well) is called SkB not ""BsK"".  

c) He did not ""remove you from the game entirely for two days and nights"".  This was a system-wide problem we had with Steam logins.  You can read about it - and the issues other people like you experienced at the same time - here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/559310/discussions/0/3039355912944303750/  

d) Kilgore did not ""sabotarge"" your trader access to the markets.  This was a server issue that affected a number of players, and you can read the patchnotes to our hotfix here:  https://forum.illyriad.co.uk/some-bugfixes_topic10909.html - acknowledging and fixing the issue 

e) Our developers don't play favourites; we are not ""friends"" with any players

We gave you all this information weeks ago, in-game, in response to your multiple support petitions, which you chose to ignore.

After you fell out with your alliance leadership, you haven't mentioned the many other various accusations you levelled at Kilgore in countless other support tickets, including that he had ""stolen your research"" and ""replaced it with a list of suspect research"" - neither of which are even possible within the game mechanics.  You also accused him of providing you with ""suspect error messages"", of ""hacking my account"" and of ""removing my password"", none of which was true.  

You made many accusations, all of which were patiently refuted by the dev team, and none of which you were able or willing to provide any evidence for despite multiple requests.

Having ignored all the evidence provided to you (that the issues you experienced were not due to a player 'hacking' your account), and having failed in your attempt to get us to ban a player who you disliked (aka 'Death By GM'), you doubled down and accused the dev team itself of somehow collaborating with this player.  

You then wrote to GM Stormcrow that, in your words: ""STEAM have invited me to write an article for their publication and if you continue to turn a blind eye to all that Kilgore has done to totally spoil two or three years of Research and other work by me then I will write that article to fully advise them and others all that has taken place..."".   

You are clearly saying that 'unless you ban this player who I don't like, I'm going to write bad things about Illyriad', which sounds a lot like attempted extortion to us.

We took the time to respond to all of your support tickets, but this was the last straw, and we perma-banned you.  

Still, we agree with you that it's a ""great game"", so thank you for those kind words.

We wish you the very best in whatever game you choose to play in the future.  We especially wish the development and support teams of that game all the very best, and our commiserations.

The Illyriad Team"

Ther are tournaments regularly where you can compete without direct warfare, keeping your cities safe.

The game is rather slow, but it means you can play it in the background. Even if you purchased it on Steam you can log in on a smartphone so you get to check up on it or take part in a conversation in Global Chat when you have spare time.

I'd recomend a try. Let it take you in.

For example I can click on the production of resources to be able to upgrade building and produce more, but I cannot get there the info, if th enumber +7 means +7 per hour, day, week...? I found it finally somewhere that it is per hour, but it is hidden, even though you have a bunch of details when clicking on the resource.

I got that info only when trying to send more of them, in an error message...

When I set out to find a browser based game I had a couple things in mind: Fantasy setting, decent presentation, doesn't DEMAND much of my time but could occupy it if I wanted to, has an interesting mechanic, and has a good community.  Illyriad passed this test with flying colors.  

Illyriad as a setting is an amazingly vast space with so much varied terrain and just enough fluff to inspire your own imagination.  

The graphics are simple but well presented.  

The demand on your time can be as little or as much as you want.  If you're away from the game for a few days your cities will be fine (most likely).  If you're worried about that and you have made a couple trusts worthy friends in game they can sit your account for you until you return.  Once you have settled a couple cities and have built them up there is so much you can do with diplomacy (mostly spying), building, researching, crafting, selling, and , oh yes, war.  

The mechanics work and are deeply layered in this game.  You can't learn it all in one sitting but if you take it a little at a time you'll eventually understand.  Nothing is very complicated but there are many simple mechanics at work with most in game activities.  A key thing that you must learn is that TEAM WORK is the backbone of this game.  Not graphics,  micro transactions, celebrity voice acting, nor unique game play... Its team work.

Which brings me to community.  Illyriad has an outstanding community.  It is so full of helpful and friendly players.  When I first started I was given a very sizable shipment of goods just for asking a question in global chat.  There are a lot of charitable people in this game.  However there are some who are not so.  There are militarily aggressive alliances as well as peaceful training alliances. Both have their place and I enjoy a world that allows me to construct these intricate cities but also presents a reality where they could be under threat.  I'm not trying to write a guide but I do urge new players to research the player alliances and pick the best one for you.

I think most people that give up the game or who don't like it are ones that tried to go at it alone.  People sometimes complain that there is no real PvP.  That is a complete lie.  There are always attacks going on.  And if you want that PvP you can have it.  The problem is if you go at it alone and choose your targets carelessly then you will be confronted with the awesome might of one or more of these alliances.  That's not the work of the dev's.  That's the community.  If you can't accept that, then this game may not be for you.

First, for a MMO, the game's community is exceedingly welcoming to newcomers.  Many of the established players are willing to answer basic questions in the chat, and even provide early game resource donations.  The game world is suitably large and there is a strategic depth to the game that requires classic ""guns vs. butter"" decision making.

Those things said, there are two components of the game that prevent a recommendation.

There is absolutely a P2W aspect to the game.  It's not overbearing, but it is there.  There are time gates to facets of the game; things such as building construction, resource gathering, trade and others all occur in real time.  If you want to avoid the wait, you can ""rush"" the completion of these tasks by spending Prestige (the in game currency that is available for purchase).  

Of course, one can play the game in such a way that rushing construction and so forth doesn't make too big of a difference.  If you are of the mind that you simply wanrt to develop a network of varied cities, conduct research, gather resources and so forth without engaging in the PvP, you can certainly do so (so long as one of your more established neighbors doesn't get itchy and decide you are a prime target).  However, that brings up the second critical flaw.

As you constuct your initial city, you will be able to research certain technologies that allow for varied buildings and units.  This is all worthwhile as it forms the foundations of what your city can produce.  However, once you have progressed enough to settle a second city (and start thinking about the new tenor this city will possess) you are met with the fact that you have to start all research over again.  In other words, even though you researched the Militia technology in the first city (a necessity), you have to research it again in your new city.  Seeing as the object of the game is to create and foster an integrated kingdom, this mechanic makes absolutely no sense and is unnecessarily frustrating.

In the end, if you are looking to engage in the social aspect of a MMO, Illyriad is probably as good a choice as any other.  However, if you are looking for a game that provides a sense of progression and proportionate reward for effort, this game will likely disappoint.",1499432014,1499432551,False,50,4,0.800922155380249023,7,True,False,False,False,,1582143665.0,"Thanks for the detailed feedback, we really appreciate well thought out critiques.

Pros:
- Community both in a guild and outside a guild are very helpful to one another and help new players get off to a great start
- Graphics are perfect for the game, this is not a game where they try to push the graphics past what is right for the game
- Content! There are multiple playable races, climate zones, huntable creatures, units.
- Back story/lore. There seems to be a storey/lore if you are willing to look for it.
- Real time play - with anything taking real time to do it means you are not stuck infront of your computer or device for extended periods of time.

Cons:
- The community is stuck in a non-aggressive state of play where no one ever attacks anyone else, ever. While I am not big on PvP this seems weird to me in a game where PvP is an eventuality
- Soverity is basically a tool that allows anyone to place a visable claim on any square, even resource squares. This then allows them to possibly nagociate mining rights with other players for a ""fee"". This is not nescessarily a bad mechanic but it is an annoying one since the next resource square of the same type might be 2-3 times the distance away.

 Illy is LONG term. It is the most complex RTS I have ever played. It also has the most freindly community of any other game I've played- idiots will be hammered very quickly, veteran players will happily send you resources if you ask (politely) in GC.

While most games of this nature have little to no tutorial, Illyriad actually covers what matters without bogging you down in information that won't be useful to a new player. It also starts you out with a 7 day newbie shield (No one can attack you) and starts you in the ""newbie ring"" a ring of other newbie villages. It's also worth noting that people don't tend to attack unless provoked. 

I was also surprised by the depth of the game. There's 4 races, each with their individual unique units and traits. There's also magic.

The research tree is fairly menacing at first but once you learn a bit more about the game and figure out your playstyle you realize that you only need to pick a few paths. 

The Good:

Great and friendly Community
Great depth of gameplay
Lots to do
Fun gameplay
Good writing for lore/quests

The Bad:

Dated graphics

The Ugly:

Some things require the client to be restarted to show up. IE: Alliance chat tabs

The community shapes this game, and it has been at different stages throughout it's life...sadly though, I am writing this review as a eulogy. I truly believe that the move to Steam before being ready was the last nail in the coffin for what could have been the greatest strategy game of all time. Now, the game is met with sup-par development and dedication from the staff, false promises, and a growing veteran pool that makes growth for this game look more like mold on a cadaver than a fruit bearing tree. Despite the communities growing interest to support the game, for free even, the devs seem to have no interest of expanding their staff or following through on the multiple promises for advancement that have been waved in front of the players faces like a carrot for years.  As a new player, the game itself is already overwhelming for most, so the move to Steam fell embarrassingly short simply because the game is stagnant and the devs released a dead game to hoping it would be resurrected. 

I have seen this games potential, and it's no longer there. Not that this game couldn't be taken from the incompetent devs to  skyrocket it's success to new extremes, but it's not going to happen. The devs are distracted or non existent, and they have other projects they value much more, so this game is dead by their choice specifically. The only people playing now are attached. Addicted perhaps, but no new players will stay longer than a year. The moment they see that the game is dead, they'll be mad they ever started playing.


At best, this game has 700 players on at a time, and their one server is a global one. Just to put that into perspective, about 25% just leave the game running, so they are afk, another 25% of that number is alt accounts logged on simultaneously, also mostly afk, and the rest are new from Steam, destined to leave within the year. Just do yourself a favor and skip this one. The community used to be generous and mature, now it's just a bunch of sour old people that are too technologically inept to play anything apart from browser games. 

It is painful to leave this review. I have many friends within the community, but after several times butting heads with GMs and having left and come back twice, (starting fresh to understand both the veteran and new side of this game...) I have seen that this game belongs in the ground so we can all move to the new age version.

This isn't a 4X game at all. It's a browser-building game that, despite it's depth, still doesn't break itself free from it's grindy core.

You do not eXplore or eXterminate. There is no exploration whatsoever, the full map is revealed already. There's no extermination at all, since the community has taken a pretty ""pacifist"" attitude as to not scare new players away. You are seriously berated if you attack someone who is active in this game, veterans might gank on you if you decide to go that way repeatedly. For one, this is great if you're starting. Everyone gives you resources and everyone treats you nicely. However, if you are looking for a brawl later on, you'll find yourself terribly disappointed.

There's also, as you might have expected, not an ending. This is a game of YEARS. Not days, not months, YEARS. Just to get your first city going in this game takes weeks if you don't buy/use prestige.

I recommend this game for those who take and enjoy it as it is: a free, browser-based, spare-time, chat-room time-killer game. It's supposed to be played while you do other things, to distract you from time to time, not to be taken as a primary source of entertainment. I do not recommend it for people who don't like sitting for hours watching the paint dry while chatting with strangers.

Yet another ""build your city, make friends, maybe go to war"" game ... but one that seems to have avoided some of the problems that have plagued others. If you like this type of game, you'll be quite satisfied with Illyriad. Its really about knowing what to expect. To be happy in this game you should be aware:
- This game is primarily a ""city-state"" builder. the successful players seem to build a network of cities, which take months...putting in a little effort with multiple sign-ins per week.
- This game is not one for folks that want to quickly become a ""top player"" in the game. Top players - those with large empires, have been playing for months or years.
- In spite of that, a new player can be comfortable and experience everything pretty much without fear of getting wiped out by some ganker. This is because:
- the community is very friendly and welcoming to new players. They know they need them to keep the game going.
- while there is a currency you can buy, there is no way you can use the currency and ""pay to win"".  I could spend $500 and nothing I can do will allow me to suddenly become powerful in the game. The game mechanics simply won't allow it (all progress eventually ties to your level of research, which cannot be sped up)
- After spending my $5, I've not used more than 20% of the currency I bought - and doubt I would ever need to buy more. Frankly, 
- One drawback of these games is that you need to log on periodically to keep production, etc. going, but most of us have a life to live. As an HTML5 game, you can log on with any browser. It works tolerably on my phone (at least enough to queue up production, etc.) I've played it on iOS, Android, and Windows. That's a nice convenience. (Getting more common - but thought it worth mentioning)
- Wars - if you want constant battle - find another game. While I hear that there have been some pretty nasty wars - I also hear they were very specific battles between particular alliances. So far, the several thousand players have been largely at peace.

So, if you are a ""patient"" game player that likes to spend time thinking and planning while building up a network of cities that gather resource and support your friends, you'll probably be happy here.",1486453656,1486453656,True,5,0,0.551283180713653564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

One of those literally for 6 years every day. I can honestly say Illyriad is the most mind-blowing browser game I've found so far. Infact it's got more content than many installed MMO games I've paid for.

There's so many features in this game that I'm not sure I'll ever find them all. Unlike pretty much all of hte other games, you don't just build up the same stuff as everyone else and whoever has the most (or can use them the best) wins. You actually can't build everything in a city on this game. There's so many different buildings you can't fit them all in a single city, and so many weeks/months of different research that you most likely wouldn't ever finish it all - I could be wrong on that point.

I've only been here a few days now, but the community is a throw-back from the internet's much kinder and more mature years. Global chat is welcoming, helpful, and respectful. It's also ridiculously active. Even at 3-4AM there's people out there chatting away. I've seen a couple spats break out between the vets, but they were still handled without the name calling and flaming you'd see on every other game these days. Just saying ""hey"" will often get a new player drowned in incoming free resources. I've not ran out of anything yet, and I've not asked for anything. You also won't be pounced on and killed when you get out of newbie protection. It's just really so refreshing to see respect and people that genuinely care about the long-term viability of a multiplayer game these days.

For those new to these kinds of games, or unsure of whether they could handle learning the potentially overwhelming amount of content, don't be afraid. The community has also made a TON of guides on the forums, everything from where to start, to advanced topics. There are also training alliances to join that exist solely to teach new players the game and graduate them onto their future ""real"" alliance. Even the folks in global chat will answer your questions happily.

For those vets of browser war games.. this one has more than just war available. There are weapons, armor, and critters craftable to use with your army or other crafting. There's a magic system. There's quests. There's tons of different troops. There's a building and research for everything you could imagine and a lot of stuff you couldn't. I'm not sure if there's a total number of cities limit, but if there is it's pretty high. 

This game is not greedy. It's not pay to win. You get 25 prestige (in game currency) just for starting. You get another 200 for playing on Steam. Prestige is used to speed up buildings, cavarans that are marching to/from you, and provide minor boosts to production for a length of time. You can't buy troops or research or anything game changing with prestige. You won't be obliterated by someone outspending you. And if you do decide to spend, it's cheap! 

You can play this game free on the browser, or you can buy it on Steam. I started on the browser to see if I liked it first, then bought it on Steam the next day. It's absolutely worth buying it on steam, the 200 prestige is a big help in getting you going faster. If you started on the browser and then buy on Steam, you CAN keep your account. Just link them when Steam gives you the option.

---------------------

Some CONs: 

I'm not gonna lie, this is not a quick game. This is a game for people looking to casually play long term and build up their stuff. If you need instant gratification or immediate wars, this is probably not the game for you.

You will start as a newbie amongst monster sized players that have been here for years. Don't let that intimidate you. They're not gonna bother you, they will help you build up. They will shower you with love because they WANT you to play. 

The interface is a bit clunky in some places, it's not that they suck at GUI making, it's more that there's just so much stuff they have to have menus under menus to fit it all, lol. I figured out where to click for what I wanted by the 2nd day, so don't let that scare you off. I gotta admit I spent my 1st day clicking everywhere trying to remember where I saw whatever I was looking for. It does have a newbie tutorial that guides you through building a few things and such, you'll likely forget half of what it said by the time it's done. At least.. I did :)

The world map is crowded with graphics. It makes it hard to find resources or goodies on the map to loot. Unchecking the ""terrain"" box makes it a thousand times easier. Once you remove the images of mountains, forests, etc. then it's all clear and good.

You can even sign in through your steam account there. I encourage you to check it out. https://elgea.illyriad.co.uk

Secondly, what you are paying for here is what in game is called ""Prestige"" it's a premium currancy that allows you to speed certain things up like building, or boosting resource production. Understandably some people may find this feature to be a ""pay to win"" style of play, however, there's a massive time sink involved with research that has to be done with each and every single one of your cities. Research can not be sped up. 

Production can also not be sped up in the terms of spending prestige to do so. Plus you can get 1 free prestige per day, and most of the speed up options only cost 3.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
1. The community on the game is absolutely amazing. I have met more friendly and helpful players in this game than in the last 16 years of online gaming.
2. The game is fairly easy to pick up, follow the tutorial, and check out a couple guides for more in depth knowledge.
3. The premium currancy is given out for free just for logging in once every day.
4. The map is insanely huge, with tons of territory to claim for yourself, or your alliance.
5. The political system is intriguing and fun.
6. Trading within your region is easy.
7. Even the large alliances are willing to help out new players.
8. Great depth within the game and plenty of avenues with which to play by.
9. The steam sound track is enjoyable.
10. Four races to choose from with different play styles.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
1. No animations or sound effects for things within the game.
2. It takes a long time to get established within the game. (i love this fact, but some more casual folks will not.)
3. The game can be daunting for anyone not familiar with grand strategy games like Hearts of Iron, Crusader kings 2, or the like.
4. The learning curve can be steep. Although the information is readily available, a lot of the generation of need it now will find it less enjoyable with out a little bit of research. 
5. Sometimes in the game you will end up in a time sink where you are unable to do anything but wait. I use these times to play other games, or attend to that weird thing called life.
6. It is rooted in a browser game style. I tend to avoid these games like the plague as they are usually just money sinks, but after looking around in game, and researching, I find that this is not like that. However, due to the browser origins, there's not much to look at in terms of animations, and things you might find in games like Hearts of Iron.

All in all I have been playing the game for a little under a week now, and love it. I feel that the game will keep my attention for quite some time into the future. Given that you can check out the game completely free you really have nothing to lose. Though for the cheep price here on steam you get the music sound track and plenty of the premium currancy for half price of the normal.

3.Complete the tutorial, the game will send you some extra resources

You can not speed up research.
Starting resources are very limited, unless you talk in open chat.

I love, love text-based browser games.  I've played and loved Utopia, Travian, and others.  But this is absolute garbage.

-The interface is clunky.  The graphics need to make up their mind between being purely functional (like in Travian) or being aesthetic.  It's a horrible mix of both.  The map is just garbage to look at.  Rather than pick between pretty but slightly less functional or purely functional (i.e. just having a key and having shapes/symbols on a grid make up the map) the devs chose to incorporate the worst of both worlds.  So you have atrocious functionality and an eyesore of a map where they just repaste the same clipart mountain/plains/forest.  What's more they mix two and sometimes even three art styles and it's just visually displeasing and even somewhat upsetting.

-Chat client takes up half the screen.  Can you make it smaller?  Of fucking course you can't, don't be stupid!
