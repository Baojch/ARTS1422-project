Genialna gra dla kogoś, kto w turówkach lubi po prostu turową walkę w wariancie niemal epickich bojów - bo z dosłownie dziesiątkami jednostek wroga, napływających kolejnymi falami. I to wszystko na pięknych mapach, z których każda jest inna, projektowana pod dane wydarzenie - a to chroni się budynek przed podpalaczami, musząc wybić ich, nie polec i wygasić ileś tam źródeł ognia w tyle a tyle tur, a to czyści się z sił zła kopalnię czy jaskinię, broni budynku, atakuje budynek...
Nie wiem czemu w recenzji napisano o losowości i rzutach kością w ramach walki - bo gdy już się walczy, to akurat los nie ma wiele do powiedzenia. Kości są ważne na starcie do każdej kolejnej tury: rzuca się wszystkimi, od każdej postaci jej własną, a potem wybiera się pasujący bonus wg kolejności ustalonej siłami wojowników. Przykładowo: trzech naszych, potem jakiś zły, potem nasz, potem znów jacyś od nich... I gdy już każda postać dostała swoje wzmocnienie (albo trupią czaszkę, która potrafi osłabić) - dalej jedziemy zgodnie z tym, co ma postać w rozpisce. Jak zadaje 5 obrażeń, to zadaje ich 5, nie ma zlituj, tyle że rozmaite osłony mogą z nich zrobić 1 trafienie albo i żadnego gdy wróg napakowany.
Ciekawa mechanika jest tu stosowana, fajnie się sprawdzająca i pozwalająca bawić się w taktyczne ustawki. Oto w ramach ochrony przed ciosem każda postać ma ileś tam punktów pancerza - 1,2...7 (mój chwilowy lider) itd. I te punkty - tracone przy każdym ciosie, odnawiają się w kolejnych turach. Czyli gość z pancerzem 7 dopiero trafiony za ósmym razem zaczyna tracić serduszka, czyli życie. Oprócz pancerza są jednak jeszcze tarczki - nie dosłownie tarcze, tych w grze nie ma. To otrzymywane z kości ekstra bonusy, tym różniące się od niszczonego pancerza, że nie da się ich zniszczyć - i kto ma taką tarczę wartości 2, ten od każdego ciosu odejmuje 2 pkt. i dopiero nadwyżkę bierze na elementy ulegające niszczeniu - czyli pancerz i zdrowie.
Piękna sprawa - można zaliczyć Termopile, gdy oto nasza szóstka (tylu ich w misji było) stoi w szerokiej na 3 osoby bramie i fala po fali bierze na klaty hordy koboldów. Po zabiciu 30 - wódz napastników gratuluje nam męstwa. Mówiąc inaczej: właśnie taką epickością potrafi powiać. Bo na widok tej hordy, wielokrotnie liczniejszej od garstki gracza, palec odruchowo pomyka ku białej fladze i ucieczce.
Gra jest liniowa, z dość zabawnymi dialogami, za to bez możliwości wybierania czegokolwiek - przynajmniej w tej części, jaką zdążyłem rozegrać. Wybrać można - misję poboczną i treningową. Oba typy nie są konieczne, ale dają w nagrodę lepsze wyposażenie lub prozaiczne wkłady do sakwy w typie mikstur leczących, dopalaczy, tarcz itd. Parę dóbr, ale mocno urozmaicających rozgrywkę - ich odpowiedni dobór, no i oszczędne stosowanie, by nam w jakiejś wielostopniowej misji nie zabrakło - to istotny element taktyki.
Już pisałem, że plansze są śliczne? No właśnie - to ta liniowość tak sprawia. Pasują po prostu do misji i chyba warto to opłacić liniową akcją. To nie RPG, to gra wojenna z zajefajną, bo wielką drużyną - która inna gra oferuje nam po kilkunastu zindywidualizowanych herosów, mogących (choć nie w każdej misji, większość jest bardziej kameralna) tłuc się z jeszcze liczniejszymi zastępami potworów?
Grafika jest fajna, komiksowa ale bez jakichś przegięć i udziwnień, daje wrażenie uczestniczenia w boju serio.
Biorąc pod uwagę, że na jakieś wyprzedaże to trafia po śmiesznej cenie - BARDZO NAPRAWDĘ WARTO! Na Youtube obejrzałem jedną polską zajawkę, autor nie umiał (albo może to była jakaś wczesna wersja) wyłączyć w opcjach potwierdzenia ""wykonaj ruch"" i strasznie narzekał, jakie to niewygodne. Cóż, teraz jest wygodne, da się w to dość płynnie grać, choć nie jest to naturalnie ideał i parę razy bluzgami rzucałem, gdy przenoszony na pozycję łucznik ""spadł mi"" parę pól wcześniej - i straciłem ruch, bo stamtąd pociskami nie sięgał gdzie miał. A w turowej grze, wiadomo - niekiedy jeden taki stracony ruch = przegrana. Ale generalnie jest OK, są skróty klawiaturowe niektórych czynności, mapa się pięknie obraca i skaluje, widoki iście filmowe, gdy tak nią obracamy i zmieniamy ujęcia, obserwując nadbiegających przeciwników.

1- Les items: oui vous trouverez une panoplie d'items. Mais au final il y a très peu de variété. C'est surtout une augmentation des dégâts ou de la défense. Ce qui revient à n'avoir aucune progression. En plus, impossible de vendre les anciens items donc on se retrouve rapidement avec des dizaines de trucs inutiles dans notre inventaire

2- Les classes: encore là une panoplie de classe qui n'ont finalement que les items pour les différencier. Pas de pouvoir unique ou de mécanisme particulier. Et comme les pouvoirs des items se déclenchent seulement sur des résultats de dés précis, on se retrouve à faire des attaques standards 90% du temps

3- Les dés: autre idée mal exploitée. On a beau mettre tout les items qu'on veut pour influencer nos dés, on se retrouve toujours avec des têtes de mort comme résultats. Évidemment l'ennemi lui peut les utiliser. Mais il choisit toujours avant nous, ou presque, alors il ne nous reste que ces têtes. Encore là, au final, les décisions de personnalisation de nos personnages sont inutiles

4- Les ennemies: ici aussi manque d'imagination. Après plusieurs heures de jeu, je n'affronte que des Kobolds. Et ils sont nombreux. Donc on passe 80% du temps à regarder les Kobolds avancer, faire des attaques de 1 (donc sans effet la majorité du temps). Ensuite on joue un personnage pendant 5 secondes et encore une minute à regarder bouger les Kobolds. Ça devient rapidement lassant et redondant.

5- Les tableaux: ça aussi c'est assez ennuyant. On ne fait que tourner en rond autour d'obstacles. Outre l'apparence, il n'y a aucune interaction. Pas moyen de détruire une malheureuse boîte de bois.

I normally despise games with dice, but SDT is an example of dice done right! Every turn, the dice are rolled, and you choose which characters to assign them to. Thus, each turn offers compelling decisions right from the start: like do I give the blue die to Snapjaw and send him into the middle of a hoard to retaliate every hit he takes with some amazing damage, or do I give that blue gem to my cleric and gather my party around her so that she can heal everyone at turn’s end? 

Early on, I didn’t realize when it’s your turn (based upon the initiative bar), you can move any of your characters that hasn’t already gone that turn, rather than the highlighted default character. Probably missed it in the tutorial, but this made a big difference to my gameplay from midgame on. So many turns are packed with small decisions, which manages to strike just the right balance between interesting choices and analysis paralysis. 

That being said, a few things could be better. Once you complete a mission, you go back to the Guild Hall and assign your loot from the previous mission. The problem I had was, once you’ve accumulated a number of items, you spend your time sorting through the stuff you don’t want to determine what you do. And each character class has a slightly different version of what items they see, and how those items work for them. Sounds good on paper, but there needs to be a better way to assign useful items (and perhaps sell the items you don’t want) to remove some of the clutter. I would also have liked some indication of how many chapters there were before game’s end. Are there a dozen chapters, or 300? Hard to tell while you’re playing. The loot progression was fairly good, until about the last quarter of the game, where I felt I’d exhausted everything I wanted. And what’s up with seeing multiple health potions (like four groups of 9), but only being able to assign one of them? Something’s not right there. Finally, the story and music are okay, but not my cup of tea. But the core mechanics are a blast! I wish, after you finished the campaign, there was a random encounter/map generator that allowed you to keep progressing outside the storyline. I wasn’t quite ready to leave my favorite characters when the game ended.

Overall, a well-executed turn-based battle system, forcing players to balance many great decisions at every turn. Huzzah!

[h1]Super Dungeon Tactics[/h1]
《超级地牢战术》，由Underbite发行的一款回合制策略战术游戏，玩家需要创建英雄公会来抵抗来自黑暗力量。经典的回合制策略玩法融合丰富的RPG因素，硬核战斗游玩之余给人玩桌游的体验之感，游戏提供了良好的战斗平衡机制，职业搭配十分丰富，独特的主线和支线剧情能让玩家获得大量战利品来提升你的实力。游戏采取Q版的可爱画风，不过地图细节画面不够精美。
[h1] 游戏剧情 [/h1]
和大多数冒险故事一样的救世剧情，通过冲突讲述故事；通过冲突诞生英雄。无论是出于义务还是因时代潮流而生，能够拯救世界的人们终将会被人们称赞而成为英雄且流芳百世。
·
在水晶世界诞生之前，世界上只有女神存在。无边的孤寂黑暗让女神创造了这片奇迹般的大陆，女神快乐的歌声和喜悦之情形成了水晶世界的土地，而幸福的眼泪则形成了海洋。然后，女神高兴地将她的目光投向了天空，在那里她将自己的力量之光分裂成彩虹的所有颜色，并并诞生了水晶世界的所有生物种族。
·
然而当力量之光被投射时，在石质山脉、茂密森林和田野中同时诞生了一个完美的阴影之地。在这个黑暗的国度中，土地被扭曲，不在展现出水晶世界的美丽之感，生长在这片土地上的居民也变得像这片大地一般残忍。
更令人绝望的是，阴影之地中也孕育了黑暗的掌管者，他凭借高超的技巧锻造了一种强大的武器——午夜之刃，这个武器能够打破两个领域之间的屏障。
黑暗的掌管者用午夜之刃打开了水晶世界和阴影之地之间的第一个传送们，大量的怪物从传送门喷涌而出进入水晶世界，平和的水晶世界因此而陷入冲突纷争...
·
许多人敢于追逐成为英雄的梦想，很少有人会坚持下去，但是现在有两个人打算努力实现这个梦想...
·
其中一个矮人族的战士，他挥舞着钢铁武器，将在在战场上挥洒热血，证明自己的勇气。
另一个是操控火焰的人类女法师，很少有人能超过她的魔法实力，她将为大陆展现她伟大的奉献精神。
在夹杂金属敲击声、风过植物沙沙声以及各种爬行动物嘶嘶声的暗黑森林深处，他们将面临第一场冒险...
[h1]游戏体验 [/h1]
传统的回合制战术战棋玩法，游戏的战斗机制较为平衡，每个职业都有不同的对战手段，职业搭配丰富。
游戏在开打之前采取了传统的RPG对话剧情模式，游戏有着较为丰富的RPG玩法，在游戏中玩家需要建立一个公会，招募各种英雄来对抗黑暗势力，随着游戏的推移，你所能操控的英雄队伍会越来越庞大。
战斗是给人的感觉就像在玩桌游，人物采取棋子式的走法，每个人在可移动的回合内都是从起点拖到终点进行移动，而不是点击终点进行移动，同时游戏也有严谨的投骰子玩法给英雄提供各种能力，投骰子可以自己决定，也可以随机分配，玩起来满满的桌游味道。
随着游戏的进展和战斗胜利后会获取到大量的战利品，这些战利品可以提升玩家的装备和英雄的能力等级。
[h1] 画面 [/h1]
游戏采用的是Q版动画建模风格，虽然加上立绘看上去很可爱，带有幽默感但整体不会太过精美，游戏的场景制作有一些简单。此外游戏中每个英雄都是系统预先设计的，玩家无法自行更改外观，哪怕是改下发色，唯一可以更改的是他们的名字。随着游戏的推进，玩家所能获得的新物品看起来也和老玩意没什么区别。
[h1]结束语 [/h1]
游戏有着中规中矩的英雄冒险故事，玩家可操控的英雄会随着游戏的进程越来越多，总体玩下来感觉还算是比较出色的回合制策略游戏。

Ok I don't know who's bright idea this was, but it literally ruined the game for me. It created too many situations where an enemy would get 2+ of them and you literally couldn't kill him because he'd often have too much temporary health and the only one who could punch through the shields couldn't also punch through the temporary health. It's just too anemic. What a poor design choice. Like seriously, the shields are too strong.

Why not make it so each attack removes a single shield? This would've made the rogue esq character a lot better. It also means that if you want to actually do any kind of damage later on you need to stack high damage single hits.

Okay, so, I just beat the game on normal for all the quest and side missions (skipped tutorial missions, did not go for harder difficulty yet), AND I have also played the tabletop miniatures/board game ""Super Dungeon Explore"", and have enjoyed both, So here are the ups and downs.

Up sides :
I had fun. Some levels where comically easy, while others had me tearing out my hair trying to figure out how to beat the enemies (I'm looking at you cage-match level).

The art style was cute, and consistent. 

I spent 35 hours beating this game, only about 2 hours of that total was wasted time. There is still harder difficulties I might come back to, so there's that to factor in. 

Plenty of heros, all but a few of which can radically have their gameplay changed with equipment.

Replayable

arguably better than the board game / miniatures game.


Downsides
The story abruptly ends. Over the course of the game, their are 2 main villains introduced. you never directly fight either of them. you find a mcguffin, destroy it and then ""yay, the... bad guys still exist.... but that's the end of the game for some reason"" Let me repeat, There are 2 BBEG's, who are named directly, and spoken about for half of the game, they are in the info tabs and have story about them, and even artwork, but you never once encounter them, much less fight and defeat them. 

There is no map/mission customization. once you beat the game, the only thing you can do is start over, or go back and play earlier missions with different heros / equipment, on harder difficulty settings. 

There is no multiplayer, though, getting people to actually commit to turn-based multiplayer and not just abandon games, is tough, and understandable why they would leave this out.

you stop getting new items several missions before last.

there is 1 item that has the wrong description that I've seen (It says it's burst 1 but it's actually burst 2, it's a fire staff)

The menues are just a bag of ass, launching the game feels like opening a powerpoint presentation

Arbitrarily Weird resolutions.

Did I mention the story just abruptly ends long before you go fight the BBEG?

I mention that there's a lot of heros, but about 1/3 to 1/5th of them are out-dated as soon as you get pretty much any new heroes, particularly the melee heros, and this is not simply a preference for ranged or AoE over melee, because there are later melee heros, that have faster movement, higher damage, stronger armor, and even counter attacks, which makes later game melee hero characters better than the early ones right out of the gate.

you never get a mission that lets you use every  hero at once. 

The only optional endless mission limits you to 6 heros. 

There is no map editor or campaign editor.

the games difficulty fluctuates wildly. particularly, by the time you get to the last mission, as long as you have half a brain, is comically easy compared to most of the game, which compounds my complaint of just abruptly ending. 

it feels like they got the gameplay perfect got the in-game graphics the way they wanted it, and then phoned in the rest and ran out of budget.

If you move a character and click okay, you cannot undo that, so make sure you have line of sight before you click the green checkmark, except you can't check line of sight while that part of the window is up. so you have to pan the camera, then click and move and not let go of the mouse button, to make sure enemies are in range, because line of sight can be finicky. 

The music was fairly dull so I muted it and listened to my own. if there is actually good music later in the game, I missed it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All that being said. I had fun with this game more often than I didn't, and my only real criticisms of the game are variations of ""it just ends suddenly and then there's nothing to do"".

If you like turn-based strategy, and cute art, and don't mind that the game just abruptly ends at around 30-35 hours without warning, this is worth buying. as for the cost... 30-35 hours / 20 bucks. is that worth it or do you insist on a sale? that's up to you man.",1548787905,1548787905,True,2,0,0.560293138027191162,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Although you'll certainly recognize the characters, locations, and bits and pieces of the game mechanics, the gameplay only superficially resembles SDE. SDT is turn-based and uses grid-based combat, but otherwise it plays very differently that SDE. 

Super Dungeon Explore (the board game) feels like a turn-and-grid-based adaptation of classic action-RPG video games such as Secret of Mana, a strange but surprisingly solid mixture of two wildly different genres. As suggested by the name, Super Dungeon Tactics feels like SDE adapted into a turn-based tactical game akin to titles such as Fire Emblem. Because we've gone through another major genre shift, the action-RPG flavoring of SDE is lost completely in SDT, but the resulting tactical game is surprisingly enjoyable.

Your characters generally only take one action per turn, rather than having a pool of action points like the SDE board game. Each turn, some buff/debuff dice get rolled depending on the equipment you're carrying and enemies you're facing, and then you and the consul (computer opponent) take turns assigning one die to each character until all dice have been assigned. Attack strength is based on the equipment, buffs, and debuffs applied to the attacker and the target; you do not roll dice to make attacks or to defend from attacks. Interestingly, there are two kinds of armor buff, one which absorbs an attack and is then depleted, and another which provides a flat reduction to enemy attacks. Unlike the board game, ranged attacks tend to have minimum ranges, which keeps ranged units from dominating gameplay.

Heroes can no longer heal themselves as a basic action; instead, you have an inventory of healing items that you can use during your turn. Potion abilities have been removed completely.

Because the multi-action and dice-rolling mechanics from the board game have been removed, and attacks can remove more than one health, positioning is a bigger part of the strategy than it is in the board game. Also, the removal of dice rolls means that you no longer generate hearts by attacking enemies.

SDT includes a couple of systems not seen as often in tactics games. SDT includes an aggro system loosly based on the ""wrath"" system from the SDE board game, but the mechanics have been altered quite a bit (and are harder to understand). Characters will generate aggro by killing enemies, and enemies seem to roughly prioritize targets by aggro, so you have to take that into consideration when using your units. However, your heroes lose aggro as they take hits, so the entire enemy force won't converge upon a single character like they do in the board game.

Additionally, there is an initiative system. Each round, RNG decides how the turn order will alternate between the player and the computer. For example, the iniative order might have the player move two units, then the computer move one squad, then the player move three units, then the computer move two squads, etc. This adds additional depth to the game; do you prioritize attacking to whittle down the enemy, or moving your wounded units into cover? The initiative system adds more depth and replay value to the game; each time you attempt a mission, it will play out very differently depending on how the initiative rolls come out each round.

Overall, SDT is a solid tactics game, but fans of Super Dungeon Explore may find the completely new rule system somewhat jarring. I would recommend this to anyone who likes tactics games or is invested in the Super Dungeon universe.

Aside from game mechanics: the fantasy universe is a bit on the generic side, but well-developed regardless. Dialog is fairly standard fantasy writing, with pop culture references thrown in every now and then in a way that isn't too distracting. The dialog seems targeted towards a younger audience.

The 3D graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are perfectly adequate for a tactics game. The 2D character artwork is outstanding; some of it comes directly from the board game, while other characters appear to be new. Even art taken from the board game has been spiced up with new facial expressions.",1526960290,1526961644,True,6,0,0.592193126678466797,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Суть - это игра сделанна по настолке Super Dungeon Explorer, довольно точно передающая источник, нсколько я понимаю. Отсюда вытекают как плюсы, так и минусы игры. В основе лежит классическая тактическая схема - одно действие и одно перемещение за ход + бесплатным действием можно использовать ограниченое количество усилений, в том числе и лечилки. В этом плане без откровений, разве что перемещение стилизовано под настолку - мы словно перемещаем фигуры. 
Но особенности, разумеется, есть. 
1) Во-первых, это специфическая система развития персонажей - параметры и возможности, кроме базовых, целиком определяются их снаряжением - никаких уровней и прокачки. За каждым классом определен свой набор снаряжения. У этой системы есть свой шарм - ударную группу можно менять как угодно, было бы что надеть. Но реализована она через корявый рандом, из-за чего возникают ситуации, когда персонажи, которых вы таскаете с собой всю игру, оказываются на порядок слабее новичков. Так я первые несколько часов на все миссии ходил с воином, но ему никак не выпадал новенький топор, в итоге пришлось переключиться на паладина, который сразу пришел с неплохим мечом. С одной стороны это стимулирует ротацию кадров, с другой - вызывает раздражение. 
Во-вторых, забавная идея с бонусам вроде повышенного урова, брони и так далее в начале хода, явно пришедшая из настолки. В начале каждого раунда кидаются кости бонусов - по одной на каждого живого героя и элитного противника - из них каждому герою надо выбрать усиление себе по вкусу. Идея забавная - пока у вас мало героев и противников. Но однажды их становится очень-очень много. И кости надо перебирать каждый раунд. И назначать каждому бойцу. Каждый раунд! На это тратится по-дурацки много времени. Особенно раздражает, когда остались только недобитки на один тычок, а тебе все равно надо перебирать кости. 
В-третьих, помимо бонусов, кости могут дать возможность использовать навыки, и вот здесь главный косяк игры. 90% времени мы тупо используем одни и те же базовые атаки. Потому что надо выбирать - или усиление, или спец-атака. И толку от спец-атак, как правило, ноль, разве что крутые штуки с голубыми фишками попадаются. В основном потому, что растут спецатаки преступно медленно. 3 урона от спецатаки варвара против 6 урона от базовой атаки - серьезно? Или жрица лечит на 1 пункт здоровья, в то время как противника все чаще бьют по 3 и выше.    

И так везде. Смирится можно, и если поймать волну, то будет весело и интересно. Но игра также легко вызывает усталость и фрустрацию. 
Еще у игры дикая проблема с режиссурой - задания совершенно бессистемно могут быть как быстрой зачисткой на 5 минут, так и внезапно обернуться изматывающим марофоном на 4+ миссий без возможности сменить снаряжение и набор персонажей. Однако задания сравнительно разнообразны, мы не всегда обязаны всех убить. 
Сюжет есть, он легкий, без серьзного отношения к себе и местами даже забавными диалогом. Вот только подается целиком через говорящие головы. 

В целом, к покупке скорее рекомендую, удовольствие от игры получить несложно. Просто негодование приходит столь же легко. Но удовольствия больше.

Funny characters and awesome visuals. Everything fits, from the cartoonish characters and their cliché dialogue to the backwater village scenario, everything screams ""old school hack'n'slash RPG tabletop"". But between nostalgia and loot, building your mecenary guild hides two very different sides to consider. First of all, the combat system is brilliant! Next to the usual ""skill does x damage and does y to enemy"" you need to assign dice to your characters. What's on these dice? That is decided by your gear. So now you need to consider, if you have the right amount of red or blue buttons on your dice to have a chance to use your life saving burst heal ability. This is a massive turn on for strategy fans that like the roll of the dice in their game. But the second side is bad. Very, very bad. Changing objectives. So I defend my city from a hoard of enemies by blocking the gate with my tanks. I reach the objective (kill x) and it switches to ""kill the boss, maybe the rest will run away"". The boss comes with an army the size of Japan and hides in the back lines. Everyone dies. Why? Because ""hold the fort"" does not seem to hint at a party, that can quickly reach a boss through enemy lines. Or ""defend the food"" doesn't tell me, that you need to run around putting out fires, so a fast loadout would have been nice. This angers me, because the otherwise beautiful and well put together game is now frusttrating, because information is kept from me. This makes it really difficult for no reason and every mission needs to be restarted, as soon as you know, what kind of mission will await you. And that sucks in longer or multiple-parts missions! Backpacksystem is shit, too. 8 People, only one fanny pack? Rly?
The game is great, it has lots of difficulty settings for all player levels and does everything else right. Fans of tabletop games like Battletech or Warhammer definitely will have their fun.

Today I will be reviewing Super Dungeon Tactics a turn based tactical game in the same vein as X-Com and various other games of the ‘tactics’ style.  Made by a small developer based on a popular miniature board game by Soda Pop miniatures this game is not trying to be a Triple A title nor is it trying to break the mold.  Simply this game tries to be an introduction in to the word of Crystalia with some decent gameplay based (for the most part) of the table top game.  Does it accomplish this?

Sparkle Burst:  The game itself is based off a board game where some players will take control of heroes in order to stop the monsters, kill spawners and ultimately kill the boss.  This game plays heavily like a table top turn based version of the arcade classic ‘Gauntlet’ and the video game version of this does this more or less the same way.  Ultimately, you will find that the game does most things as it should, the graphics match, the sounds, though few are correct but there are sadly no voice overs.  I will say that there isn’t much in the way of music but I enjoyed it (especially the music while playing manor levels).  The game play itself is solid (with a few minor annoyances) and plays a lot like the table top game, which I also play.  The best way to think of this is that it is much like a less complicated and more ‘casual’ version of X-Com style games.

We’re All Idiots:  The plot of the game is fairly simple and has more of a comical approach than anything serious.  That is not to say that the game itself is a comedy but more just silly more than anything; the characters constantly make bad decisions to cause additional problems until finally they stumble into a victory.  This doesn’t mean it is a bad story just a bit silly and whimsical in nature; but this is overshadowed by the enjoyment of the game itself.  The complexity of the gameplay comes from the equipment but more interestingly the dice mechanic.  Unlike many other tactics style games there aren’t any random number generators in the attacks and abilities themselves but at the beginning of each turn the game rolls a set of dice.  These dice can be allocated to heroes to give the bonuses (bonus damage, block, speed, etc) but some monsters can allocate dice as well.  These dice are created by the hero or monster based on their equipment that not only increases stats but adds symbols to your die.  This creates an interesting point where you are setting up gear to not only make yourself more powerful but also give you favorable options for die rolls.

Micro Managing:  So, what’s bad here?  There really isn’t much; initially I didn’t like how the characters moved (you ‘pick them up’ and drag them) but when I understood the idea was to move them like in a miniature game it actually grew on me.  The itemization can be a bit annoying, some items that are objectively less powerful are higher ‘tier’ and some also need to be rewritten as they list their stats out of order.  Nothing hugely wrong here, just minor things I’d like to see fixed.  I will say if you scroll while going through menus (as all RTS players do) the games scroll will lock; this is a common problem in smaller games and only had real impact on the game a few times but was very frustrating none the less.  Along the same lines camera angels can be a bit annoying when you are trying to line up shots or see if you can target something…especially on the manor levels (which is a shame they were my favorite).  I feel this could easily have been a non-issue by having a ‘rewind’ button that allowed you to take back your previous action.

Ultimately, I am happy to say that I recommend this game.  The game can be a bit short as there is only the single player (really, no co-op or competitive?  This game is based on that) but I really do feel the experience was worth the cost of time and money.  I did get this game for free for purchasing a new release of the core game as well, so there is that.   Again, thumbs up, which is good since I haven’t given one of those in a bit it seems, enjoy!",1517519264,1517519473,True,2,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It has a cutsy presentation (good or bad, depending on your preference) but the mechnically it's quite involved.

The major gimmick is the dice, which are influenced by your gear selection. The dice are allocated to each character at the beginning of the turn, based on inititive order including 'hero' enemy types, and each dice provides a small but sometimes extremely significant edge to some aspect of that character's performance. This is where much of the strategy of the game comes into play, as you need to trade off which character needs that specific buff this turn, and which hero might be able to do without. Especially once enemy powers comes into play, as you may start picking to deny enemy abilities rather than to enable your own powers. More than anything else, it's this aspect that makes the game not really casual (at least at higher difficulties) as doing the cost/benefit analysis here can be agonizing. This especially gets challenging as activation order becomes extremely important as more hero units are on the board.

Since all of the character power comes from gear, there's no issue of respeccing (just swap out gear). This is quite convenient and allows you to experiment a lot with different builds, but the downside is that a lot of the characters feel somewhat same-y. The only real distinction between two characters using the same set of gear are the character-specific support skills; for many characters this is becomes almost a non-factor (though with a few very significant exceptions - couple of characters are practically defined by their support abilities). 

The game does feel somewhat unpolished in some areas (I noticed at least one misspelling) and the storyline is entirely forgettable, but it's a great mechnical tactics game.",1514790860,1514790860,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I - SUMMARY
Details will follow, but to summarize first:
- At first it looks like a casual game for kids, BUT play one or two hours is enough to realize it's a game with a depth and a mood that could fully satisfy many adults.
- Greatest aspect is combats that have a nice depth, a fair diversity, and are based on a system avoiding routine and automatic playing.
- Second greatest aspect is party building. It is very special because it's based on equipping party and party composition selected among a roster. Also it's useful and fun (but not mandatory) to redo the party building each time you'll start a series of missions and prepare a party for it.
- Equipment seems simple but it's rather deep and complex and it is linked to party building.
- The writing is ok, but it is surprisingly interesting, and it is easy to read.
- The graphics are pretty good if the style isn't a problem for you.
- It lacks of polishing on some details like some points of the UI but overall this is good stuff.
- Secondary missions have a too short story, and should have been more secondary quests.

Overall a great Tactic RPG focused on combats and party building, both with a very original approach.

II - GREATEST ASPECT, THE COMBATS
Combat system use two original designs not coming from the tabletop:
- There's a mix of an initiative system and a system that allows you to choose the order you play your characters. It avoids most often play the full party before there's any enemy reaction, and choose character order adds choices and depth.
- There's dices coming from tabletop but unlike in tabletop, at beginning of each turn you throw them all and set yourself a dice result to each character. This is increasing the tactical depth, and it force think at each turn.

Those two combats mechanisms provide:
- Quite a lot of depth to each turn.
- A lot of control on the random aspects.
- Make impossible to quickly rush each turn.
- So avoids routine which is the classical main curse of turn based combats.

Moreover combats have other qualities:
- A fairly good diversity of missions types.
- A pretty good design and diversity of each combat.
- The difficulty progression along the campaign is very well done, nowadays even many AAA games aren't as polished on that aspect.

II - SECOND GREATEST ASPECT, THE PARTY BUILDING
Party building isn't based on pure character progression, the characters don't really level up so you don't have skills and attributes to choose for each level up. Instead each character in roster is unique, and their equipment provide:
- Characteristics increase, health, speed, attack power, armor, damages bonus (armor, jewel, weapon, special, consumables)
- Provide one or two base attack types and many with a specific AOE (weapon)
- Provide special skills either passive or active, those skills are different for each item and each character that can use the equipment (armor, jewel, weapon).
- Provide dices results that will influence the chance of those result to happen (armor, jewel, weapon, special, consumables).
- Each equipment item is unique except for consumables, but there's a progression so some items will make obsolete some older items.

The result is the party building is a complex choice of characters from roster that you put in party, from 2 to 10 characters to choose among up to 15. For each character you need choose the equipments they'll use, knowing that there are many conflicts between characters because any equipment is unique. And you need choose from 2 to 5 consumable types depending of party bag size.

It's a special party building, but if you like party building then there's a lot to enjoy with this game because it's complex and before each quest that is a series of missions you can redesign your party.

III - PRETTY GOOD, EQUIPMENTS
There's only 4 slots per character, plus up to 5 or 6 slots for party consumables, but there's still a nice depth:
- Your party is up to 10 characters which is meaning 40 slots, no single character RPG can challenge that from far.
- All items but consumables are uniques which is pretty cool, and many are adapted to each character, knowing that final roster size is 15.
- As items are uniques and most are adapted to each character, equipping characters of party is quite more complex than just pick best equipment that can wear each character in party.

IV - SURPRISINGLY INTERESTING WRITING
I can's say that the writing is great because it's a standard story and standard characters. But it is surprisingly interesting, it captures well the attention, it is easy to read, and it builds well the curiosity. Not sure why it worked so well even for a second play, what I quoted is:
- There are touches of gentle humor, and myself I enjoyed.
- I found most characters sympathetic, despite it's nothing very deep or original.
- The story brings well interrogations and suspense elements to increase player curiosity to know ""what's next"".
- One aspect is lacking a bit, the secondary missions tend have a too short story, and should have been more secondary quests with a real story.

V - SOME DETAILS NOT FULLY POLISHED
Since about 10 years, some indie games target an AAA polishing level for many aspects like UI, controls design, controls customization level, rules clarity, in game documentation, more.

Despite it's a game with a production level quite higher than many indie games, and with many aspects quite polished, it has also some polishing weaknesses, I quoted mainly:
- UI is overall good but has some weaknesses, overall it's quite playable anyway by learning a few shortcut, use mouse mainly, and disable option to request confirmations.
- It is missing a few more shortcuts and some more handy mouse interactions.
- Drag & Drop is a burdening mouse usage and nowadays a bit obsolete and replaced with click to pick something, move it, click again to drop it. The game UI implements it a few time but it's not consistent and not always possible.
- There's only 3 profiles and for each only 3 saves slots, it's usable but a pointless limit.
- You can't customize the keyboard keys and mouse buttons (probably not the gamepad buttons too).
- Despite a large part of the game is in 3D (not the UI) and characters have nice 3D graphics, the characters equipment isn't shown on the 3D characters. Ok with the large amount of unique items and the number of characters this would be a lot of work, but it's clearly a lacking aspect anyway, not really breaking the fun, but it would be great and fitting well the game design to have it.
- Combats graphic animations are ok, but it's nothing spectacular nor even noteworthy.
- On Mac the fullscreen mode let Menubar and Dock popup in game when mouse goes on top and bottom borders.
- It seems that first creation profile for a game newly installed on a computer can still cause a problem with a game stopped on a ""please wait"" message. Try again eventually in window mode not fullscreen and after even for new profiles it seems solve the problem. At least it happened to me in September 2017.

VI - CONCLUSION
It's already in the beginning of the review that starts with the summary, I copy/paste: Overall a great Tactic RPG focused on combats and party building both with a very original approach.

EDIT: Update after to have finish a second full play only at Veteran difficulty and did all secondary missions available, and there's plenty. Again, a lot of fun, again. It's a different challenge level, and Veteran difficulty shows more clearly that some heroes and setup are stronger in general. But there's still a lot of possibilities to experiment many different approaches. This game is a bit more for players that like experiement than those focused on optimization, great game overall but more food for the first category of players.",1506623398,1508271804,True,5,0,0.478277713060379028,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is simple but pretty involved.  The bulk of your strategy will rely on mixing and matching equipment which are semi-randomly dropped from the missions you complete, equipping them to characters, and then selecting the right characters for a mission.  At a tactical level, the game can be a bit slow (dice assignment is time consuming and large maps with tons of enemies take a lot of time to get through) but is overall very rewarding.  
Elements that detracted from the game include nearly everything left to random chance and not being able to save in the middle of a multi-map mission.  Battlefield control is kind of wonky; threat is well implemented but monsters can still run past your frontline without anything to stop or slow them down.  Also, there's no way to influence initiative that I could see.  Non-HP consumables seemed pretty useless... but I say that in almost every game I play so whatever.

The UI is adequate but could use a lot of polish to improve quality of life.  I would have liked to see an item-centric screen that lets me quickly see who can equip it and what the differences are.  Being able to adjust characters on the character... bar? on the bottom of the screen.  Saving consumable selection between missions.  Relatively small changes that could have improved my experience by quite a bit.

The graphics are simple but in a cute way that doesn't detract too much from the gameplay.  I turned the music off because I was listening to podcasts so I can't comment on it.

The story is simple and railroady.  Not really a selling point for the game.

Played each mission on level 4 difficulty (Normal+).  Anybody having trouble with this at lower levels must be bad at tactical games.

Pros: 
Nice fluffy graphics
No randomness in combat actions.  You know exactly how much damage you'll do per atatck, and to whom.  Randomness instead based on initiative order each round and on distribution of dice rolled for each PC and major enemy.  You'll then know if your turn is going to be good or bad and prepare accordingly.  No 5 misses in a row at 95% chance XCom style.
Some nice customisation options for each character, be it weapons (AOE vs. single target armour piercing), armour (Heavy vs. faster), Amulet (Different active and passive abilities, including AOE party buffs within a small area), Misc (Extra HP?  Extra ARM?  Extra speed?  Auto enemy pushes?  Auto damage on nearby enemies?  Choose wisely - especially as some more powerful items are more likely to give you bad dice results.)

Cons:
A couple of missions I had to go to the forum as no idea what to do next.  I believe the mission text beign patched so you actually know how to find the missing villagers in one mission.
A couple of missions (Haunted House) dragged as had to loop back around a very mazey set of corridors. 
Some options and characters did seem plain superior to others, but I think that's true of almost every game out there.  And finding the dirty combos is part of the fun of these games, right?
Shallow story - not an issue for me personally as I just need a little bit of narrative garnish between massive killing sprees.  But, be warned, Baldurs Gate 2 this ain't...
Item and equipment list gets cluttered.  Would be nice if you could bin certain items so they are not selectable (Maybe with option to search the bin if required) as no need to select from tier 1 weapons when up to tier 3.

 while I am only a few days into it, is easily the most fun I have had in this genre for a long time. Time will tell if it is as special as my favs in hindsight but it looks promising. Either way I am having too much fun playing this wonderful gem.

Great games always have something you cannot quite define. They just make you feel good playing them. so thank you for that. Clearly you get what makes this genre fun, as many have tried and come up much shorter. This will happily sit comfortably with my favorite tactic games.

Upon several people's advice I gave Super Dungeon Tactics another shot the last week and I have to say I did enjoy it more than the first go round. Many of my complaints remain but there is a bit more depth to the gameplay as it progresses and knocking up the difficulty meter made it challenging enough to make advancement feel worthwhile. I'll leave my original review but I'm switcing this to a slight recommmend. It really helped this time that I found out I was able to speed up the ai turns and getting rid of that annoying double check move animation via a menu I didn't even see the first time I played the game.

It's still a little to on the shallow side for my tastes but it's not a terrible game and I am glad I was coaxed into giving it a second go around. I really wish they had done more with the dice rolling mechanic because it feels like they left alot on the table with that idea....or off the table? 

6/10

OG Review.....

The concept of letting die rolls determine what units can accomplish each turn is a nice twist on the srpg formula. However they failed miserably to build on that twist and it feels like they fired the game designer after the tutorial was finished and failed to develop the gameplay. Ultimately the game suffers from having a very limited set of options for each unit as it quickly becomes tiresome doing the same thing with each unit every turn. There really isn't much in the way of depth and it's unfortunate as I understand the boardgame was full of it. It seems like they attempted to streamline the experience for digital devices and inadvertenly ripped out the heart and soul of the experience.

Pros...

SRPG Tactical Combat still kick ass
The writing and dialogue between characters is very well done
Well balanced difficulty

AC/DC

Music....I can't recall anythign about it so i'll leave it here

Cons
Shallow shallow shallow gameplay
The graphically presentation is just not appealing and usually I would stick this in the middle but outside of the character drawings present for cutscenes (from the board game I think?) there was very little attention to detail in the design and presentation here.

RPG 요소라고 볼만한 것은 장비 파밍 정도. 경험치 개념은 없다. 좋은 장비를 착용하면 그만큼 능력치가 상승하는 식. 장비에 따라 같은 종류의 무기임에도 다른 효과를 갖는다. 또한 캐릭터마다 2종류의 무기를 쓸수 있다. 가령, 로그는 단검류와 활을 쓸수 있는 식.
무기 옵션은 같을지언정, 캐릭터에 따라 스페셜 옵션은 다르게 적용된다. 위자드에게 주면 광역데미지를 주는 스페셜 능력이, 아처에게 주면 버프 효과를 주는 스페셜로 바뀐다던가 하는 식. 이는 장착 무기에 따라 옵션이 바뀌기 때문에 조합하는 재미가 있는 편. 그리고 돈이나 상점 시스템도 없다. 오직 미션 클리어에 따른 템 획득만이 있을 뿐.

장비가 곧 캐릭터의 강력함과 연관되기 때문에 나름 파밍하는 요소도 있을 수 있다. 하지만 최고 난이도로 진행하면 왠만큼 좋은 장비들을 매번 얻을 수 있는데다 초반을 제외하면 크게 어렵지 않기 때문에 ... 그저 이런 요소도 있다는 것 정도만 알아두자.

게임의 재미는 초반엔 지루하다 못해 지른 돈이 아깝다 싶을 정도인데 동료가 늘어나고 사용가능한 장비가 늘어나기 시작하면서 슬슬 재미가 붙기 시작한다. 각 미션은 데려갈수 있는 영웅의 숫자가 정해져 있으며, 미션에 따라선 정비조차 하지 못하고 계속해서 이어지기 때문에 피통 관리 등의 어려움도 따른다.

AI는 단순하며 피해 계산식도 단순하지만, 매 라운드마다 주사위를 굴리고 그 주사위를 각 영웅들에게 배분하면서 해당 라운드에 한해 능력치 상승이나 하락을 주는 방식으로 변칙성을 구현했다. 즉 일반적인 게임들처럼 3~6 데미지 같은 식이 아닌, 언제나 3데미지 고정이지만 주사위를 어떻게 주느냐에 따라 1데미지가 되기도, 5 데미지가 되기도 하는 식. 적들도 주사위를 굴리고 이를 가져가기 때문에 상황에 따라선 능력치 하락만 있는 주사위만 주렁주렁 달아줘야 하는 경우도 있다.

게임성은 아무래도 직접 플레이해보는 편이 낫지만, 환불가능한 플레이 시간인 2시간 정도로는 이 게임의 참 재미를 느끼기 어렵다. 그렇다고 오래 한다고 해서 엄청나게 재밌어진다거나 하는 건 아님. DOS 시절이나 윈 98 정도 시절에 하던 RPG 게임을 좋아헀다면 이 게임은 꽤 괜찮은 선택이다. 2만원이나 되는 돈을 주고 사야하냐고 묻는다면 글쎄... 스팀은 갓 출시한 게임이 아닌 이상 정가 주고 사는게 아니라고 배웠다.",1493724810,1493724810,True,3,1,0.569752275943756104,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sometimes the GUI at the bottom of the screen pops up in your way. The biggest flaw, though, is that the deeper you get into the game, the cheaper it feels.The game also requires ridiculous amounts of clicking at times. 

Furthermore, the difficulty levels (of which there are 6) are very poorly designed. Once you get into the game a ways, you will come to realize Normal mode is what most games would call hard mode. In the game's late levels, the game is ridiculously difficult even on the lowest difficulty levels (easy and casual). This of course strongly implies that the developers don't understand basic English words like easy, normal, hard, and casual...

Because of all this, the game becomes more of a chore than something fun to play. This is particularly true when you enter the bounty missions and challenge levels. The first challenge level in the game is quite stupid, even on casual mode! It feels like they just spammed a ton of strong enemies and called it a level. Sounds like the kind of level you'd get from a kid playing Super Mario Maker with absolutely no knoweldge of game design, doesn't it?

The devs obviously need to read up on game design, especially on the psychology of video games. Difficulty for the sake of difficulty is not the secret to good games. The book ""Glued to Games - How Video Games Draw us in and Hold us Spellbound"" is a very good one on the subject.

Don't expect a carbon copy of the board game though. The mechanics are actually quite different which make it a solid tactics game. The equipment system allows you to use each character in a couple of different ways, although it does feel in some instances that a certain setup is strictly better than another one.

Lack of movement animations is my biggest gripe, but not a dealbreaker. Many people just turn off movement animations in games like this anyways to speed up the turns, but I prefer the immersion of it.

-Game play is fast while maintaing satisfying depth and variety (dice assignment has a lot to do with this)

-Pays homage to the 16 bit titles of yesteryear with its numerous nods JRPG tropes
-I'm left feeling excited about new content and DLC

This game is really gratifying. As many other reviewers have pointed out, there are some areas that really need polishing. That said, the devs seem quite responsive to user input, and they release patches on the regular. I've only played the board game on which this is based (Super Dungeon Explore, or SDE) in Arcade Mode. While this title is not a direct port of the board game, the game has captured the feel of SDE admirably. The story is lite, but compared to SDE - which has no story or character growth (SDE: Legends not withstanding) - anything is a welcome addition.

For my part, the quirks of interface and unpolished aspects are tolerable, and I remain confident that they will be addressed in time - i'd certainly not dissuade folks from getting this game on account of its issues if they are otherwise interested in it.

So - if you like tactics, JRPGs, cutesy anime, engaging game play, and fun in general - Super Dungeon Tactics is certainly worth it.",1488235874,1488235874,True,6,0,0.557415664196014404,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Instead, I was presented with clunky mechanics and an abundance of confirmations for, seemingly, every single move. Also, the cut scenes are fun, but it doesn't feel like I am in the world. Cut scenes are fine, but I would like to see my third person characters actually walk around, interact with stuff, include some funny animation, etc. The reading sequences are exhausting. My suggestions:  1.) keep it turn based, but speed up the game play 2.) Include animations of the characters actually running to their move positions in battles sequences. 3.) Don't make it an option:  make the enemies all move simultaneously to speed up the gameplay. 4.) Show the characters enter and exit scenes to make the narrative feel more cohesive. 5.) The dialogue has potential, but needs some more punchy lines, perhaps a note could be taken from ""Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars"" for SNES. 6.) Don't have people right click the characters and then have to select a move with a left click 7.) Immediately ground your players by showing the world and where the characters are beyond the map in the intitial intro scene 8.)

I have always wanted a SDE game, so naturally when I saw this pop up I got super excited! I'm a huge fan of SDE and own well.. all of it -.- I have a problem.. even the kickstarter stuff.. anywho!

They could have easily made super dungeon explore instead but I understand them wanting to make plot and adding more to the lore of the game BUT come on now.. 

Bottom line I am really disappointed, sadly I got this game with the Iron Golem mini-boss so I can't even return it. I can't recommend this at all. There are far better turned based strategy games. If the models, sounds or gameplay at least stood out I think  I could forgive most of it.. but it just feels like some sort of tablet game made by a few people.

Never heard of the game or the minis it is based on until the release date but I'm glad I stumbled on it. 

Developers background on Mobile and Webpage games shows with some design decisions and lack of options, but they have been quick with updates to fix the worst issues/oversights. Their communication and updates to this point show that more is coming to this game and that a pretty good game could realize its potential and become great.

Gameplay is good. Your heroes feel powerful as they destroy hordes of enemies -  attrition is your main problem. Spawners keep pressure on you in most missions to press forward and take chances, rather than arbitrary turn timers. Dice being rolled each turn and selected by both you and the enemy to activate abilites and buff units is a change from the traditional turn based formula I like. After the mid point of the game some missions do become slogs. This is especially true when enemies have high armor, which (like yours) regenerates every turn, and the large enemy forces make some missions play slowly. This required me to think more about optimizing weapon and hero choices rather than just picking who I liked at the moment to proceed.

Despite this the game isn't very difficult. Playing on Veteran difficulty gave some tense situations but only a few truly hard objectives. The game is definitely at its best with story missions that have multiple parts where you have to split and reform your teams between them without knowing what might be coming next.

Overall I enjoyed my time playing and will play through it again for sure. There are still a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out but as is it is worth your time. Especially at this price.",1484177444,1484177444,True,3,0,0.527528166770935059,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was really excited when I first saw this game even though I thought that the game would probably be a bit slow and boring after a while. But now when I have played it I am really stuck and love it. Yes it is slow cause to manage the higher quests and encounters you need to think and have a good strategy so you end up thinking what your next move should be for some time. But your own thinking is the only thing that makes it slow and you get really drawn in and the time flies by fast in real life.

I like that I recognize the heroes, enemies and some abilities with many nice surprises and the story is really great and the dialogs are funny (there is a skip button for those that hate dialogs). 

I love that the gameplay feels like a boardgame but the gameplay itself arent the same rules as the boardgame but it doesnt matter cause this is balanced very well to work as a PC game. 

The only con I can think of is that it has no multiplayer, which would have been awesome. Either to play against eachother or together against some encounters. I hope they add something like it in the future.

It would be really great if they continued developed this game like the boardgame do with other areas, bosses, heroes and enemies with DLC in the future.

As a big fan of the board game (I own every set) I was initially anxious about how this game would function. Thankfully, they didn't just port the game over rule for rule (this killed Space Hulk's port). Instead it has become a somewhat barebones tactics game. I won't say RPG, that would be lying, but all in all I've enjoyed it so far.

Features:

Dialog, Story, Characters:
      Several of the characters (notably the Fighter and Barbarian) have accents which look like spelling errors at first.
      The dialog is light-hearted and fun, much like the flavor texts in the board game, but do belay the seriousness of the situation.
      The Heroes are not particularly memorable for there personalities, but each looks very unique and easy to understand.
      The enemies are surprisingly varied, and all look right. (Bone Heads and Rattle Bones are mislabeled).
      Story seems a little sparse.

Graphics:
      It's a tactical game, they aren't gonna be great. They did capture each heroes appearance pretty well, though.
      All the enviroments are bright and alive (a welcome change from the prevelent doom and gloom pallettes of other games).
      I'd prefer running animations rather than the pick up and drop.

Sound:
      The true weakness of this game. All of the soundtracks have so far been utterly forgettable, not even the menu theme says epic adventure.
      SFX are simple, no problems.

Gameplay:
      Simple, but with a few add-ons that deliver a little more unique version of gameplay.
      Difficulty is punishing until you can figure out the game mechanics.
      Map's are themed to their areas, but differ greatly between them.
      The UI is very clunky to start with (learn the hotkeys), but they've already patched it, so I expect it'll get more fluid with time.

Verdict: 7/10
      I like it. The art appeals to me. I love the board game, I like the video game. I hope a lot of updates and content are on their way. Sure, it's a bit clunky and buggy, (the fps likes to plummet randomly?) but this is literally the only game I've found of theirs. So, since it is appearently their first game, I will give them a little slack. (Raven's Cry, War Z, and Garry's Incident are proof of how bad this can actually turn out, so be thankful this actually feels like something you would spend money on).
     While $20 might be a little high of a cost, the series is built on expansions, so here's hoping!

      There is a great amount of room for expansions and DLC (hopefully most are free) to really expand the game, as the board game does.

It's never a good sign when you start noticing multiple grammar mistakes in the opening introduction. I understand that not everyone is great with grammar, but couldn't they hire at least one editor? The characters themselves are pretty unlikeable... the village is under attack, and they treat it more like an unwanted interruption to their nap than with any sense of danger.

Anyways, the game didn't really redeem itself. The UI is awkward and cumbersome, the animation is jumpy, and it has a distinctly rushed look to it. The rolled dice that you assign each turn is a neat concept, but by the fourth fight you start to realize how awkward and cumbersome of a mechanic it is... a realization shared by the design team, as they added a ""skip this and let us do it for you"" button to bypass it. Why bother, then?

All in all, the light (barely nonexistent) tactics and ""widow-dressing"" art both scream ""this is a cheap mobile game"" at full volume.

Underbite games seeks to bring the fun and action of the tabletop to your PC with  Super Dungeon Tactics.

In Super Dungeon Tactics, Players are responsible for their own guild of heroes who band together to take out the Dark Consul’s forces in the land of Crystalia. Fear not, as there are plenty of side quests, loot to collect, and random encounters in 3D levels.


Super Dungeon Tactics is a turn-based strategy game in which players create a guild of Heroes to combat the Dark Consul’s forces throughout Crystalia. As the guild master you choose to take on bounties, answer the pleas of the public, or answer a noble call to adventure. Whether for altruistic reasons, just getting your cut, or a little of both, complete quests, gather loot, attract Heroes, and reveal the world of Crystalia by your own means.


Underbite games did a fantastic job of catching the feel and look of the Super Dungeon franchise with this game. The characters are colorful with personalities that right draw you in. Scenery, backgrounds and environments are varied and extremely colorful and very well done. I can’t speak of how much I did enjoy the “look” of the game. It’s takes the Chibi style and runs with it, which mind you is a very good thing. The music also get’s an big thumbs from me, it reminded me of playing some 8bit RPG’s back in the day.


If you are familiar Super Dungeon Explore, you will feel right at home here, note though, There are a few things from the board game missing from the video game title. The biggest thing is being able to play cooperatively with people, I do hope that Underbite games at some point will add some form of multiplayer.  You can play coop style on the same computer, but players will just be sharing the same mouse and keyboard which too me, is not much fun.

 
Even though multiplayer is missing, the single player experience that is fun and wonderful.  If you’re a fan/expert Hard core tactics RPG player you might find this to be a bit easy for you. I think Super Dungeon Tactics is great for new players to learn the genre.

 

Learning how to play is simple and the tutorial is well done, and makes it simple to learn the ropes, and get you jumped right into the fry fast. There is a hidden depth that you might miss, that being the items and loot picked up during battles. In between levels, heroes need to be equipped with gear that will bring out better abilities and tactics. The cast of heroes grows with each stage as well, learning how to play them all, and how they mix with each is something that you need to learn to maximum you best chances of winning. Bringing the right heroes to the job is important.


As I was playing I kept thinking about how fun this would be to play on tablet as well, it’s plays great on the pc mind you, but I think being able to “Touch” your way around would make for a fun time as well.
 

If you’ve never played the tabletop version, don’t fear! Your play or knowledge is not that important, this is a great game on it’s on. If you have played the tabletop version, then you will be right at home, the game’s cards and dice based mechanics.
 

I found myself laughing out loud many times, at the dialogue during the after battle parts of the game, the writing it whitey and funny. There is a skip feature if you want to just get to the monster killing, but trust me, do your shelf a favor and check it out.


Super Dungeon Tactics missions aren’t always about mauling Dark Consul forces, though there is a certain pleasure you get as your slaughtering wave after wave of kobold’s!  Early assignments have you putting out fires, or saving villagers, which when rescued, become part of your active party.

I did have a few nitpicks about the camera, and how you had to use your mouse to move it, when I first was starting my play of the game,  but thankful the Dev’s listened to the community and released patch that fixed this, you can know move the camera with WSAD/Arrow Keys. Thank You! Much better!

Overall, this is a rocking good time, character building is all about the gear, so if you enjoy min-maxing then you will smile, when you get that next great loot drop. Though it’s very RNG based, and we know how I feel about the RNG!  Combat is intense and draws you in.

Super Dungeon Tactics is an adorable adaptation of the board game ""Super Dungeon Explore"" and, for the most part, they nailed it. Staying true to the board game that it's adapted from, Super Dungeon Tactics shows the benefits of not holding to the traditional rock-paper-scissors elements that are sp widely prevalent in this day and age of turn based strategy games.

Unique gameplay with a simple, yet entertaining storyline, this game shows a huge amount of potential for future expansions or other titles.

It isn't a perfect game, however. There is no capability to upgrade or customize your Adventurer's Guild and no real way to dispose of no longer needed weapons and materials, leaving you with a bloated and ever-increasing inventory and no way to purchase additional items. I know that these mechanics weren't part of the board game the video game is adapted from, but it would have been a very welcome deviation. 

Despite it's minor flaws, the game is extremely solid and I have no qualms recommending it to others. See my full review on Youtube. Final Score: 8/10.",1482731912,1482731912,True,9,0,0.561568617820739746,0,False,True,False,False,,,

So I've played the board game a lot. I usually end up playing the Consul (i.e. the DM) so I don't get to experience it much from the players' side. This is that game for me. 

I cranked everything up to extreme difficulty and I'm having a blast and feel accomplished when I pull off combos, when my paladin is able to tank the ogre and when I dance around the waves of kobolds. 

Some missions are much tougher than others, but all can be beaten with sufficient application of ... tactics. It's right in the game title, people!

If you like tactical games like x-com and atlas reactor, you'll like this one too. If you hate cutesy graphics, kittens and America, this game is clearly not for you.

I was concerned with some negative reviews this game got, and I shouldn't have been.

The worst thing I can say about it is that the UI takes getting used to - I wasted some turns and had to replay battles when I turned off the confirmation dialog. Keep that thing on. Once you figure out how to select a specific hero and how to give commands and at what point these commands become final, you're all set.

The story is okay. It gets you from point A to point B. Point A being your bored self in a chair and point B being cracking Kobold skulls.

Dice are done differently than in the board game, but they are a very interesting addition to the game. You can stack them the way you like by wearing different gear and they have a significant effect on the battle - not a substitute for sound tactics, but an addition to them. They are the weather pattern, the way the wind blows. Ignore them and waste time and resources. Capitalize on them and win. It's a good balance between total determinism and RNJesus heaven.

Has random drops for loot. 
Seems to have all your typical classes you would expect in fantasy based tactical game.
The devs have been very active in the message board and are working on tweaks and improvements to the interface.
UPDATE: They have made some nice changes to the interface and it is much better now.

I would like to add the game is more light tactics casual fun style and doesn't overload you with to much information, but doesn't mean the game is easy, there are some hard battles. You can just set up your guys gear and play a battle without having to look at every little detail before you plan your attack. Not as deep as Final Fantasy Tactics with all the  characters and story. Yet still the dice rolls do add new a twist that FF Tactics doesn't have, nor others I have played.

This game is so cute it hurts.  Cute characters, cute personalities, cute ability names.  Automatic 7/10 just for the cute.

I would say strategy-wise this is a middle-ground difficulty for this genre.  Most of the strategy is not so much about moves on the battlefield as it is setting up your team's equipment for good synergy.  Defense and reactive abilities play a much larger role than most turn based strategies, as the frequent respawns and high volume of enemies mean you'll be getting far fewer hits in than them.  It focuses more on endurance than maneuvering.  There are some very challenging levels, and enough difficulty settings to make it way too hard on yourself if you like that kind of struggle, but overall I'd say this game is at it's core about chilling out and kapow crash smashing kobolds to a pleasantly relaxing soundtrack.

Cons:

There are quite a few small improvements that could be made, but nothing I've encountered so far is game-breakingly bad.

One thing I'd most like to see improvement in is the party management layout.  When equipping a character, I spend a lot of time flipping between it and the other characters to remember what I equipped, or what dice they're all contributing to the pool.  It would be beneficial to have a side-by-side roster-type comparison of the items and dice of each character, especially later in the game when you have almost a dozen characters, since equipping them to work together such a crucial part of your success on the battlefield.

It would benefit from some streamlining of the UI as others have mentioned.  But even in it's current state, the UI isn't so unweildly that it detracts from the gameplay, it just takes a few minutes to get used to.  I mean really, if you still can't figure out how to play after reading the tutorial popups and clicking around for half an hour, you might want to reconsider if you should be purchasing strategy games at all.

Verdict:

A little clunky, but totally worth getting.  It's a casual, fun, and way too cute adventuring experience.",1482113285,1482840659,True,4,1,0.56443023681640625,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Very Indie, UI could use some improvements and polish

They don't try to re-invent the wheel for the sake of re-inventing the wheel but still expand on the classic tactics rpg in simple and fun ways. Some loot grinding is there but not to the point it artificially attempts to lengthen the game by much, unlike other games as of late.

A grid based turn battle system?  Huh...I wonder if it's like Final Fantasy Tactics?""  Don't wonder any longer because it isn't.  I'm quite sure the game developers didn't spend any time looking over that game's shoulder or they would have got some pointers on how to get gamers more invested in the characters they played.  I could comment on how cartoony the charaters are, but Final Fantasy Tactics was the same (only their cartoony characters were capable of treachery and betrayal, making the overall mood of the game dark and oppressive).  However, this game is far more light-hearted and not nearly as deep but the playable characters  ... just show up ... they can be quirky but nothing draws you to them.  

I played the game with medium difficulty, shrugging off that it was nothing like FFT - yet I still had one major issue with it.
In a turn based game, having a large opposing force is not challenging - it is boring.  Waiting for twenty enemy units to complete their turns made me feel like I should be folding clothes in another room while the enemy did his thing.

And...the enemy also has spawners.  With a turn-based game, this is very bad.  While carefully chipping away at the enemies already on the map, the spawner can summon a sizeable army within six turns or so - giving them many attacks in succession that can easily kill a tanky character that was at full health while you still struggle to take down a heavily armored enemy with your small team.  Enemy spawners are not unheard of in tactical games but I would hope if the game sets you up to fight an army in turn based combat, you get to have an army too.   Unfortunately, just about the time where playable characters start arriving in twos and threes, the game starts to limit your access to them.  Meaning, your overall team chilling back at the guild hall could be sizable but you only get to utilize a scant few of them at a time depending on the mission.

Dull story, dull characters, extremely boring waits while swarms of enemies move in one at a time to slaughter your poor overwelmed heroes.  Yawn...delete.",1482044420,1482044420,False,4,0,0.422209978103637695,2,True,False,False,False,,,

-'Creating a Guild of Heroes' is a bit of an embellishment.
There's less of creating a guild, more of following mobile-esque story missions which add new characters to your pool. The bounty missions do a good job of providing loot, but they're limited. I don't see how there would be much replayability after you go through the story line once.

-It fails to adequately explain its mechanics.
Why are enemies getting buffed when I select dice? How does equipment affect my dice rolls? At what darkness level do spawners release spawns?

-The UI is tedious and woefully inefficient. 
Before the start of a mission, if I haven't selected any consumables, I need to leave the mission select screen, go back to the main guild screen, go to the item select screen, select consumables, then go back to the main guild screen and then back to the mission select screen. The same situation if I haven't selected heroes. Additionally, once I go through that menu dance, if I click on a new mission, or even the same mission, my item/hero selections disappear and I have to do it all over again. Simply saving the last item/hero loadout, with a button to change the loadout right on the mission select screen would save a lot of clicks and minimize some frustration.

During combat, the lack of hotkeys or even a hotbar is frustrating. Given the relatively few number of actions available per character, the actions I can take should simply just display near the bottom of the screen; I shouldn't have to keep clicking a character to click the end turn button.

-There is no feedback to the player after the completion of a mission.
In the event that you get loot during a battle, the excitement of discovering what, exactly, that loot was is left to the player to figure out--by going through the many guild hall menus. A relatively simple solution would be to show exactly what those items acquired are at the end of a successfully completed mission, and, even better, an opportunity to have that item immediately equipped.

Again, the most critical element, the tactical gameplay, is solid, however, everything leading up to and away from that gameplay is a headache.

These are not necessarily bad, but just makes the game not for me, not my style. This game has a lot of things that are different from what people might consider a ""normal"" Tactical RPG. It has the normal mechanics, and then it has some strange ones. Turn based fights, with squares, which is par for the course, but the weapons and armor decide your level, abilities and the dice that are rolled at the start of every round. The side of the die decies what each character gets as a buff or debuff for that round. This is an interesting mechanic, coupled with everything else.

 I had a bit of fun at first, but after I got out of the tutorial and into the game, doing a few missions, it struck me hard. Not getting experience or any type of money for completing the missions, just isnt for me. You get story or bounty missions, and what you earn in those bounty missions, is items such as gear or useable items like healing sodas. Some people will probably like this, as while it seems different and difficult, it is VERY simple and straight forward. You should not have a steep learning curve here, and after a few battles you will get how to play the battles to best survive.

 All this being said, I prefer a more typical RPG, where you gain experience to gan levels, and the levels increase your stats.

<UPDATE>
More hours in and still enjoying it VERY much. The new update has made for faster gameplay, easier camera control, and let me control the music level. These were my three biggest concerns with the game. 

Oddly enough top of that list was the music - it was a bit loud and repetitive for my taste. 

The next concern I had was the camera was difficult to contol with the mouse roller button, you could only do small incremental movements. Now with wasd contols I can roam around the battlefield much easier.

A big battle could take hours to play and much of that was caused by enemy movements. The developer has sped up the movements and it really helps pacing.

Thanks to the developers for listening to the community and making changes (and fast too).

The time I feel many people choose to keep or refund their games. Here are my personal impressions:

TL:DR

This is a nice little turn based rpg. You are builing up a guild, thus having a bunch of hero's to choose from. Each with their unique play style. These are you basic archetypes: barbarian, mage, rouge, ranger, etc. The graphics are not amazing, but the art sytle agrees with how it is implemented and its humor imo. As other have said, the music is repetitive. I have not found it annoying yet, but I have not played it for more than 1.5 hours at time of review.

My rant:

Gameplay: 
I really am enjoying the gameplay. The best thing i can relate the combat to is XCOM EU/XCOM2, only with reguards to actual combat. There is no meta strategy that I have come across yet. However, this is like xcom-light, since there is no percentage hit calculation. You will always hit your enemy. Many people will perfer this to xcom's rng demons ( i like them, but also enjoying this as well). 
From what I can tell, each hero gets an action and a movement, in any order. An action can be an attack, or an environment interaction. Consuming an item is a free action. Die are used, but only to give buffs/debuffs to your heros at the begining of each turn. This helps keep the combat a bit different every turn imo. Other reviews have said that the game does a good job of making your heros feel strong, by throwing waves of enemies at you and watching your guild mates crush them, which i fully agree with. This is not to say the game is a cake walk. Under harder difficulties, one wrong move will spell disaster for your heroes. 
Another positive point is that there is no lvling for your heros. Yes, I said that this is a GOOD thing, imo. You see them get stronger purely based on items/equipment. This means the heros you may not use often will not get left behind as you will aquire loot for them even if they are not in your party. This allows you to change party comp between missions at will without worrying about not lvling your favorites. 

So, it is obvious I like this game, but I will point out some flaws that I believe people should know before purchasing:

* Everything is done purely using the mouse. No key mapping at all. They have said they looking in to fixing this in a patch, but it shouldnt have been an issue. You are builing a pc game.... you should be able to use a keyboard. Unless it was initially intented to be a mobile game.... i digress.

* I can tell that the story will not be something that will pull you through the game. It is kinda interesting and a bit funny ish... The combat is enough for me to enjoy it for the price, but I know others may need a well written plot, which I do not see this as being anything other than building up a guild to accomplish harder and harder missions.

* Every hero is predesigned. You cannot change appearance, sex, hair, etc. The only thing you can change is their name. Not an issue for me, but I know some people hate this.

* My largerst complaint in this game, which I have seen this problem occur more frequently over time, is that new items and gear do not look any different! I hate this with a passion. So i finished the first non-into/tutorial mission. During the fight I saw that an enemy dropped an orange weapon! :) I went to my guild hall to look and it was a bad ass looking bow for my ranger. Much more intimidating than her current twig-bow. I equipped it and...... still looks like a twig bow. Same with armor. Come on devs! You have only 2 appearnce changing item slots! ( there is also accessory as well as some diamond type item, which seems to boost archetype stats, like my dwarf has the 8-bit guardian which increased defense die stuff) Let us see those bad ass items on our heros. Since we dont have lvling in the game, items are the only way to see growth, and I want to SEE it, not just look at stat increases. I know it is based off a board game, and you dont change the mini for every item, but use the video game medium to do things you couldnt do on the tabletop.

Rant over...

So, I will definitly be finishing the game over the next few months. I think it is worth the price and a really fun little tbsrpg. Small problems aside, if you really enjoy tbsrpg combat and the thoughts of building up a guild, then this is a good game for you. I will update review with info on more features as they present themselves.

If u r a fan of this genre, give it a try.

Dice assignment gives each character tweaks at the beginning of each turn. The rng motivates players to change focus and adopt more than one way of playing each role. Everyone this time gets some shine!!
All characters have potential to be OP, as long as you assign them the right dice at the right time, and follow up with proper tactics.  

Haven't gone through the entire campaign yet, but I can tell you that this game has high replay value.

5 different difficulty levels provide the right challenge/reward balance for all players. New to the world of turn-based tactic games? No problem, complete your quests under casual/easy difficulty. If u are an expert, then spice it up and try xtreme mode!! 

That being said, this game isn't perfect. Voice acting and character animations need some improvement.

Other flaws have already been metioned by previous reviews, no point to repeat them here. Hopefully major flaws can be addressed in your next patch.

21.99 CAD is a reasonable price for me. Keep up the good work; looking forward to ur next DLC.

-Gameplay is your standard grid based combat and has a good amount of depth to it
-Dialogue is full of pop culture references and pretty funny
-Difficulty is good. The game on normal is well balanced and fun
-Art style and character designs are nice
-Seeing more of the Super Dungeon Explore World is cool

The Bad
-Graphics are basic and the interface could have used some polishing
-A few bugs such as names not appearing and pressing the ready button at the wrong time
-No options within the game. (I had to kill the volume in my audio mixer)
-Maybe a bit pricey(I haven't played enough to see the full scope of the game yet)

So, is this game as good as those? No. Do I like it? Yes.

That being said, indulge me a moment to offer some constructive criticism to the developers. 

1. Story/writing. A big part of what made FFT and Disgaea so good was this. FFT was a great story told well. Disgaea really went the extra mile to create compelling characters and was legit funny. SDT is pretty flat in this department. I especially don't like the mage. The Shadowrun games would be a great example of making a weakness a strength and what to shoot for in the future.

2. Sound. No voice-over. The music does not coincide with what's happening. In the opening our little town is getting raided and the music just plods along. Some sound effects to puncuate the dialogue would help.

3. Gameplay. I like the gameplay. I thought I would not like the dice, but I like it a lot. The game could use a little polish (a little depth really), but pretty good.

So, I'm going to keep playing this game and enjoy it and maybe SDT2 will be even better",1481773764,1481773764,True,48,0,0.720795392990112305,7,True,False,False,False,,,

It's worth noting that in combat there is no chance of missing an attack. You always hit and do the damage listed. The challenge comes from making sure you're in possition to attack.

I wanted to get this review in quickly since there doesn't seem to be a whole lot said about the quality of the game in the current (all-positive) reviews:

First of all, there are notably low-quality aspects of the game right off the bat. Rough edges, if you will. There are interface oddities that make em think this was really meant to be a mobile game. There are some exceptionally ugly icons. The soundtrack, while cute in short bursts, becomes monotonous in minutes. Etcetera.

Second of all, if you're here because of the brand, please know that this is not a true recreation of Super Dungeon Explore. It has its own systems, it simplifies combat dramatically, and it's very quest-oriented in a way that the board game never could be. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the game plays very smoothly and quickly, but please don't go into this expecting a faithful recreation of a game you already love.

Finally, though, the game plays very well. Specifically it walks the fine line of making your character feel ""overpowered"" as they mow down anemies with weapons and magic, while also making the game challenging by throwing hordes of enemies at you. I'm enjoying it quite a lot.

-Mobile-style controls

Progress through chapters, each holding several quests with dialog between. During the early stages of the game you often meet strangers who become group members bringing new classes and skills. Combat is a turn based affair with both character and item stats having the ability to effect travel and move speeds, before mission starts you are given dice to distribute that boost them further. Completing missions grants re-entry to the guild hall where you sort new items and organize party members. Controls are all mouse driven so there was no need for button rebinding. No in-game options, visuals are configured through unity launcher. 4K was listed but I could only get 1440p to render correctly.

Would recommend Super Dungeon Tactics to SRPG fans or people looking for a turn based strategy with some thought involved. Lovely presentation outside of a few 'mobile port' UI oddities, one of the few games in the genre that I've not fought with silly camera controls. My biggest complaints are the lack of voice work which would have polished it off and the music becoming a little repetitive.
