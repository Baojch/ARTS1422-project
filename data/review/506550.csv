Yeah, that isn't what the old, dead, obsolete rail shooter genre needed to kick it back into life.   So basically you put your VR headset on and look at things and shoot them while you're on a roller coaster.  I have no idea why anyone thought that would be a good idea, let alone good enough to waste $100 self publishing it as a game on Steam, but here we are.

The game features lazy minimalist/untextured low-polygon ""retro"" assets and visuals, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the early 1990s.  The lack of textures is a method that lazy devs often use to disguise their lack of talent/interest in doing the graphics properly and trying to disguise it under the name of ""art"", or ""We made it look bad on purpose"", which really isn't something gamers should have to put up with.  It's unclear why the developers weren't willing to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets and high resolution textures for the game.  It looks bad as a result of their decisions, and that's just another reason to avoid it.

This seems to have been made a VR exclusive to prevent any comparison with non-VR 3D games, a comparison that this game would fail very badly at.  Developers must learn that while VR is great, if the only thing that makes the game great is the VR, then the game isn't great at all.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 9 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

RollerForce has the laughable, eye-watering price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.

It's not unplayable, but it gets old quickly.
It's a 360 degree roller coaster (at roller coaster speeds) where you attack and defend from all sides as you are riding this thing for 3 loops.

Loop 1: Here's the track, here's some enemies coming to attack, boom boom, shoot and survive.
Loop 2: Ok, you know the track, here's some more enemies and some hiding around certain geographic elements now.
Loop 3: I hope you're good at aiming, because they are! MORE ENEMIES FROM ALL SIDES!

There are health pickups along the way, but imagine shooting a cork gun from a roller coaster at a still from about 10-30 meters. You can also go into slow-mo:
- Slow Mo is required to survive, to play, to really progress in anyway. Perhaps the intention is to get so good that you can blind fire all the levels at max speed the whole time.

Git gud nub, cause if you don't slomo and mow them down, you will die on loop 3 and it's time to start from the top!

In slomo, it is an interesting experience, but again, it gets old rather fast. Not quite a rail shooter like Area 51 or Time Crisis, and it's not a roller coaster simulator either.

I'm honestly surprised by the Mostly Positive review status for this game. I got this game in a VR bundle and basically got it for less than .50 cents USD. I would be hard pressed to recommend this game at even that price. This game is definitely not worth $5 USD.

Several reviews mention the aim being broken. I didn't notice that issue. Some reviews mention motion sickness or nausea ... wow, maybe don't review VR games? This is an easy, comfortable VR roller coaster ride with shooting. The problem is that it's boring as hell.

The gameplay gets repetitive after 1/3 laps for a track is completed. There are really only 2 tracks. But there's 4 difficulties for each of those two tracks with a freeplay mode for each thrown in. However, those extra modes hardly matter. After playing 1 lap of each track, you'll feel like you have already played the game too long. There's no reason to do additional laps for more of the same, dull, uninspired gameplay.

Shooting on a roller coaster should feel like a wild, thrill ride ... not in this game. The biggest thrill is to your retinas as you get all kind of bright-colored explosions in front of your face / eyes. You may want to see an Optometrist after playing this game. The environments are bland and the shooting is just repetitive. Let me say it again, the whole game is repetitive.

But you don't need to take my word for it. I made a video review, showing off the gameplay. Watch it here:

You're basically combining a ""rail shooter"" with literal rails (in the form of a roller coaster track).  Unfortunately the execution of the concept isn't as good.

It boils down to this: the ""coaster"" is moving so fast and yet the game is lagged behind so it never seems like you're shooting where you're aiming. The game hints that you'll need to aim ahead, but to me it seems like you need to aim EARLY as well as ahead.  Maybe if I turn the graphics down somehow it'll work better.  Nothing in the game looks so intense that it would stress out the GTX 1080 SC I have though.  It's also not like the framerate is bad in game.  It's just that my shots seem lagged by about 100-120ms or so.

The weirdness of this effect is that I can fire a shot, and because I'm moving forward and the track is going downward, I'll see the shot fly from slightly behind me and above me even though my gun is by my waist.  I tried repositioning the controllers in several ways to see if it was some weirdness from the way it was being tracked but it didn't seem to matter.  Shots to the side didn't seem to be lagged as bad.  Only shooting directly in front.

Things I liked:
[list]
  [*] Rollercoasters and guns, sounds like a good time.
  [*] The main menu graphics look nice
  [*] There's an exit option that actually exits the game instead of having to hit the steam button and exit from there like a bunch of other games.
  [*] The scenery changes from day to night as you go through the various laps.
  [*] For the most part, the coasters are exciting enough to feel like a ride, and mild enough that you aren't horking up your intestines.
[/list]

Things I didn't like:
[list]
  [*] The apparent lag in the shots.  Your shots are all projectiles instead of beams or hitscan so aiming them is annoying.
  [*] The enemy is rather uninspired.  most of them are just jagged blobs of whatever.  Only one or two enemies struck me as cool.
  [*] Half the time you can't even tell what the hell hit you. 
  [*] Because of the lag, hitting the ""health"" pickups is made extra difficult though it seemed worse on later levels than the first level (maybe because there are fewer health pickups)
  [*] After you finish your 3rd lap and ""win"" it makes you take a victory lap around the track and really, 3 laps is plenty, thank you.  
  [*] The music isn't very memorable.  This is another game where immediately after quitting the game I can't even remember what the songs sounded like. 
[/list]

I love the concept of the game, I just don't like the execution.  Also the game store page says ""10 tracks"" but 2 of those tracks are marked ""Free ride"" so really there's only 8 levels.

I feel like this game needs a bit more polish on the enemies and some of the game mechanics to be more fun. Most people would probably say ""Eh, it's only $5, so who cares?"" but I'm not likely to get 5 hours of gameplay out of this (because it's not that much fun).  I'm not going to refund it, but I wouldn't recommend it either.

It makes it feel like you can't really aim at anything,  almost like you're pointing at stuff that someone else is shooting at.  That said,  it's still a thumbs up for being an excellent rollercoaster VR with a high level of polish and content for the price. 

It didn't make me sick and I giggled like a schoolgirl on a rollercoaster with guns.",1473925714,1475554053,True,6,0,0.602888107299804688,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Your player moves pretty fast along a rail as you shoot enemies out of the sky, like a roller coaster. Intense! Really like the music. The bullets lag behind the player a bit so sometimes it's hard to tell you are firing and where you are aiming, but the hit detections is pretty generous. Graphics and effects look really nice. Decent amount of content, 2 worlds with 5 tracks each.

Lots of fun, very much worth the low price.",1473917965,1473917965,True,5,0,0.550278723239898682,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Visuals are great.

Tracks are fun to ride.

Shooting is fun but could use a bit of work. It seems the projectiles do not inherit player velocity, which makes all the shots seem to be fired way behind they are actually being shot. Makes the visuals look weird and it seems harder to hit enemies. There also is no usable gun sights. 

7/10 as is, but with some tweaks it could be even better. In its current state the game is totally worth it.",1473896712,1473896712,True,8,0,0.648486196994781494,0,True,False,False,False,,,
