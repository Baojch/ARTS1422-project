>Heard about Monday Night Combat, a game that's part MOBA, part third-person shooter, and part ""What-the-heck-am-I-playing."" 🎮🤔

>Jump into the game, greeted by a mix of wonderfully designed character including some extremely hot ladies, always a boner I mean bonus!

>Decide to play as the Assassin, because who doesn't want to be a cloaked ninja with a freaking crossbow, right? 🗡️🕶️

>Game starts, and suddenly I'm in this crazy arena where the goal is to destroy each other's Moneyball. Yeah, a freaking Moneyball. Not kidding. 💰🏀
>Going all out, jumping, shooting, and getting wrecked by a hyperactive Support class with an infinite supply of healing drones. How is this fair, devs?! 😅

>Suddenly, a Blitz mode where hordes of robots come at you. And you gotta defend the Moneyball. It's like tower defense on steroids. And maybe some Red Bull too. 🤖🏰

>Teamwork is key, but also throwing your teammates under the bus when things go south. Hey, it's Monday Night Combat, not Friendship Night Combat, right? 🚌🤝

>Oh, did I mention the announcer? This dude's voice is the perfect mix of hype and sarcasm. He's like the hyperactive sports commentator that never sleeps. And you can't help but love him. 🎤😄

>And then, there was the sequel, Super Monday Night Combat. It was like Monday Night Combat on acid, with more characters, more absurdity, and more ""What in the world am I playing?"" 🌀🌈🚀

>But now, the sad part. Monday Night Combat and its sequel are like forgotten relics lost in the gaming abyss. The servers are as empty as my wallet after a Steam sale. RIP the good old days. 😢💻

>But hey, if you ever find a dusty old copy, or if some magical time-traveling game genie brings it back, give it a shot. It's like stepping into a time capsule of chaotic, absurd, and strangely addictive gameplay. Monday Night Combat, you were a wild ride. Farewell, old friend. 👋🕰️🎮 [/b]

🎶 [i]Go ahead and boot the game, that's what I need
Take a good look at this, it's quite a feed
'Cause Monday Night Combat is the place to be
I know you wanna play, it's pure gaming glee

Chasing bots, don't know why, but it's a blast
Better hurry, join in fast, or you'll be last
I can't tell anymore, but I'm having fun
You know what I mean, we've only just begun

Do you think it's looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
I'm just shooting and I'm aiming, give it a shot
Do you think it's looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
I'm just gaming and I'm claiming, I'm red-hot

Running on low health but I've got a plan
Shoot, blast, and I'll be the man
Uniformed avatars, running wild and free
In Monday Night Combat, there's no referee

Feeling so awesome, I'm a gaming maven
No more pretending, I'm the one who's raving
On the battlefield, no need for diversion
Go ahead and stare, I'm a gaming excursion

Do you think it's looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
I'm just playing and I'm saying, give it a shot
Do you think it's looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
I'm just fragging, and I'm bragging, you bet I'm hot

Go ahead and play, it's a gaming dream
In Monday Night Combat, things aren't what they seem
Do you think it's looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
I'm just gaming and I'm claiming, it's the gaming jackpot! [/i]🎮🔥

[b] Scene: Deep in the heart of the jungle, George, his faithful companion Ape, the lovely Ursula, and their friend Tookie the Toucan have set up a makeshift gaming console. They're all gathered around, ready to dive into a game of Monday Night Combat. George, with his lovable but sometimes clueless demeanor, is about to start the game.

George: (Excited) ""Okay, friends! George have something called 'Monday Night Combat'! It's like smashing things in the jungle, but on the tiny screen! 🎮""

Ape: (Intellectual, with a British accent) ""Ah, 'Monday Night Combat.' How intriguing. It appears to be a digital simulation of adversarial competition. Quite the modern pastime. 🤓""

Ursula: (Adventurous) ""I'm in, George! Let's see what this Monday Night Combat is all about. 💪""

Tookie: (Squawking) ""Tookie wants to play too! Tookie's ready for action! 🦜""

George: (Eager) ""Great! George press the start button... Now, we're fighting other people in the future, or something like that! 🚀""

Ape: (Analyzing) ""It seems we are engaging in a futuristic conflict. How fascinating. These weapons appear to be particularly advanced. 🔍""

Ursula: (Fighting) ""We'll have to work together and strategize to win, I suppose. 🤺""

Tookie: (Excited) ""Tookie's gonna choose the colorful character with the big hat! Look at me, I'm a star! 🌟""

George: (Puzzled) ""Why are these people shooting us with shiny balls? George thought we're supposed to be friends. 😕""

Ape: (Chuckles) ""George, it's a game! You're meant to oppose each other in friendly competition. 😄""

Ursula: (Competitive) ""Get ready, everyone! We're in for some action! 🏁""

Tookie: (Squawking) ""Tookie's shooting colorful balls at the enemy! Take that! 💥""

George: (Laughing) ""This is fun! George feels like a tree-swinging hero! 🌲""

Ape: (Focused) ""Ah, power-ups. They should provide a tactical advantage. I'll make good use of them. 💡""

Ursula: (Commanding) ""Stay together, team! We've got this! 🙌""

Tookie: (Cheering) ""Tookie got a double knockout! We're on fire! 🔥""

George: (Excited) ""Watch out, other team! George is a jungle combat master! 🤩""

Ape: (Proud) ""Well played, team. Our combined efforts have yielded success. 👏""

Ursula: (Grinning) ""That was surprisingly fun, George! 😁""

Tookie: (Celebrating) ""Tookie's a gaming champion! Who knew? 🎉""

George: (Excited) ""Monday Night Combat was the best game ever! Now, who's up for some swinging through trees? 🌴""

Ape: (Intellectual) ""Ah, George, as captivating as your proposal may be, I must return to my literary pursuits. A fine gaming experience, indeed. 📚"" [/b]",1699257348,1699294935,True,1,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False,True,

I sank so many hours into this game every day when I'd get home from High School and hop on my 360. I still think about how much I love this game ten years later. This game captures the strategy of Tower Defense style games with the unique combination of a class based shooter with the intensity of a great MOBA all combined into an extremely well put together game that's fun for a quick match or to play all day. Monday Night Combat shines in so many ways I couldn't possibly list all of them, but I'd still like to illustrate why this is one of the best online multiplayer games ever made, period.

The combination of Tower Defense, class based shooter and moba makes this game go beyond a lot of issues that these genres of games have on their own. With a good strategy you alone or your team can sneak straight through the lane into their base and quickly win, which in tower defense games normally you just are stuck with an insane amount of enemies that you can't really outsmart which becomes very boring. Also building defenses and different turrets can help fight the enemy teams strategy as well, which makes building turrets thought provoking but you don't have to devote yourself to that aspect either. The classes are very well made and there is no definitively better class (But a team of gunners really sucks to play against) and each plays uniquely and meshes well with others which I think a lot of games (tf2 included) don't do very well. Even if there is someone that just destroys with their class as long as you make sure they don't get bots to push you can still easily win despite the frustratingly good player, which is nice because in a lot of shooters tryhards can ruin a fun game and carry. This doesn't mean that the combat is lacking at all, characters all have small nuances like the snipers grapple that at full upgrades launches people a mile away and often knocks off the map which is an AMAZING feeling when someone rushes you. And lastly on the subject of unique abilities the MOBA qualities here are mostly just the skills you purchase in the match with the currency you get in match and the intensity of pushing bots through the two lanes. Despite the sound, this never felt like the never ending pushing and defending most MOBA's like LoL have. This game encourages you to take different approaches and most levels have multiple ways of reaching an area to flank or even come up behind enemies who are camping and defending. And if you never want to defend, invest all your money in the best turrets and you can focus on a straight  on assault. This game lets you play in so many different ways that you will come up with absolutely silly strategies. Resource management becomes an important factor when they are in your base and you are struggling to keep your last two turrets up and the intensity is at its peak at your desperate last stand. 

Even beyond this weird mashup of genres that works beautifully there are other unique gameplay features like Bullseye the mascot you literally kill for juice and money which becomes an intense king of the hill match in its own and can be game changing, JUICING which just puts you in godmode for about ten seconds which is also a game changer, and the annihilator which destroys all enemy bots and slightly damages everyone for a price. You can also buy unique bots that can kill enemy players and help you get down a lane and attack the enemy base. All these little quirks let you play in a way that is unique to you but also allows you to greatly change your strategy mid game if nothing else is working.

All these things make this game zany, wild and unpredictable. Nothing feels unfair or broken, matches can be extremely quick or about ten minutes with a sudden death of all out attacking each others base. The maps are incredibly designed and fun to play except spunky cola stage. This game will really doesn't feel like it has aged either to me. The gameplay is so tight and the concept is so fun its just timeless. Really a Masterpiece.",1612548450,1612548450,True,16,0,0.664500951766967773,0,True,False,False,False,

[u][b]TL,DR Review[/b][/u]

While many of us will miss the now shutdown Super Monday Night Combat, the original MNC lives on with a small but dedicated player base. Fun for returning players, a harder sell for new players who might be interested.

[u][b]Full Review[/b][/u]

Well it's only been 5 years since I last played, why not jump back in?

Monday Night Combat is a 6v6 or co-op class based shooter that came out originally on the Xbox 360 and eventually Steam when Flash Sales were still around and Steam Events were still cool. You have 6 classes available: Assault, Gunner, Assassin, Support, Tank & Sniper. They are pretty much exactly as they sound, with 3 available skills that can be upgraded as you collect money from destroyed bots and kills. They don't have much of a personality as characters but this was created as a $15 game. The goal is to defend your money ball while attacking the other teams money ball. You can also activate jump-pads, send additional waves of bots or even save your money for the annihilator. Don't forget to collect those juiceboxes and juice up, equating to an overdrive on your damage and rate of fire for a limited time.

The presentation is still great with an over-the-top major sports league\gameshow theme. You'll have the occasional mascot to empty your ammo clips on to get money & ammo, a manic-like announcer, & of course the Pit Girl. Map design also follow suit with a future-sports style and there is a decent amount of map variety to experience.

Player count is.....surprisingly high for a 10 year old game. It seems like you can find enough players to join on the weekends and a fair amount still on Steam Discussions to add and start a few matches with. I managed to play a few matches and as you would expect, get pretty much steam-rolled by players who are all at the highest level count. The option for running your own dedicated servers or LAN play probably helps, no P2P connections here.

I'd say at $5, it still might be worth picking up if you have a few friends who are interested in jumping back in. However, when the likes of Overwatch and Paladins are available, I'm not sure what kind of appeal there is beyond nostalgia. Sadly, the vastly superior Super Monday Night Combat has been shutdown for over a year when GDRP compliance came around and was really a ton of fun. Monday Night Combat is fun to revisit every few years to see those 2011 Steam Summer prizes that you unlocked and fill Chickey Cantor with lead.",1584752025,1654122037,True,6,0,0.558040201663970947,1,True,False,False,False,

It's a true shame because 'Monday Night Combat' has decent visuals, a great sense of humor, and some genuinely fun game modes.  

But, as I mentioned, it's essentially been a ""living dead"" game since it's release on Steam as it's only ever had an all-time player peak of 51.  As of this review the peak is 16.  Good game, but it was sadly born dead on Steam.  If you have a bunch of a friends to play with, I say organize together and pick it up if it goes on sale—otherwise you're wasting money.

If you ever see this game on sale, and try seeing if you can get some people to grab it. You've got a Coop shooter mode vs waves of Minion- Er... Bots, which you can also play solo, albeit slightly harder, and then you've got the meat and potatoes, the VS mode.

 The name of the game is to be as sporty as possible. Taunt after kills, Taunt after takedowns, Taunt after counters, Taunt after Taunts. Oh, and go smash a globe full of money. You get six unique classes, each comes with two weapons, three abilities, and four upgrades. Each one of these classes specializes in Something or other, with the assault being a 'play-maker', the Support doing his namesake, the Tank actually being a very terrifying class in close range, so on. Their playstyles are very straightforward, despite what it seems.

Maps are super easy to understand once you've gone through them once or twice. there's a lane of robots which you want to push to the enemy's globe, however, the enemy wants to do the same, all the while there's a second level that only players can get to, that is full of people shooting at each other. When the game was alive and well, you had constant combat and fighting for days at a time.

Now, the game's dead. I'm not sure who let it die, frankly, but as a ""Non-Couch Party Shooter / Fancy Moba-Esque but Not Quite"" game, it's amazing. And mainly because the ""MOBA"" gameplay in it is basically just pushing the robots and making money. That's it.

If enough people ever pick this game back up, and somehow manage to revive it, someone let me know.

Its a great game if there are 4, 6 or 8 of you wanting a bit of a laugh for a couple of hours every so often. 6 classes to play, different abilities to tweak if you want to and it can be quite tricky perfecting some of the shots you need to land. Team members juggle about every round and you can get quite different games with changing up a couple of players classes on a different map.

Negative is that you won't find randoms playing this very often, and if you do they are insanely good. So find some friends or play the vs bot game.

I was skeptical at first so I went on YouTube to find a game play video or something and low and behold, AngryJoe did a review on it. After seeing that he gave it a great review, I decided to buy it.

The first time I played for 20 minutes, I thought I regretted my purchase. After just playing for another 30 minutes, boy was I wrong. This may have been one of the best games I've ever gotten for fifty cents. It's worth the full $5.00 imo and that's before I've even hit my first hour in the game and not having even played the MP part of it yet.

I went in knowing the MP was dead but I totally wish I just had a few other people to play this with because there are two servers right there waiting to be filled. The single player mode is still fun as hell. I did get the game to run in 1440p and I love that the fps is already at a locked 144 right when you install and run the game. It plays like a combination of multiple games wrapped into one. Team Fortress 2, Paladins and Plants Vs Zombies to name a few. 

If you're wondering whether or not to buy this game, I say don't even hesitate. Especially if it's at a sale price and you have a few friends to get the full benefit out of it. Like I said, I personally am enjoying it solo. The devs really put some thought into the single player.

HIGHLY recommend this game. You will not regret your purchase. In fact, I just noticed you can get the four pack(4 copies of the game) for $1.49 TOTAL. That's perfect if you have 3 other friends that are into this type of game. If I did, I'd easily buy that pack right now and give some friends the perfect early Christmas present.",1561779895,1561789332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Тут будет про закрытие SMNC, почему его именно закрыли (1), мой обзор и про игру (2) и в конце идея для комьюнити игры (3). Я разрешил коментарии, можете дописывать то, что я не сказал или ещё что-то.
    (1) Условно-бесплатная MOBA Super Monday Night Combat прекратит своё существование в следующем месяце из-за новых законов о конфиденциальности ЕС. Что бы избежать штрафов, разработчикам пришлось закрыть SMNC, а на её переделывание уйдёт значительно больше денег, чем было потрачено на создание проекта и поскольку сервера давно не набивались битком они удалили её а оставили часть от этой игры. 
    (2) Игра классная, и вот TF я тут практически не вижу. Классы? - да есть сходство. Цвета команд? - да ну, в большой куче игр всегда красные против синих, но на месте разработчиков я бы задумался добавить больше цветов команд, поскольку в игре с такой тематикой это будет хорошо смотреться, а не так как в TF. Сначала я зашёл в игру только ради шапки, но потом я осознал насколько эта игра хороша, потом когда я её захотел установить вновь, её не оказалось, потом наткнулся на то что написал выше и очень сильно расстроился, но вот наткнулся  на скажем так огрызок от той игры и не задумываясь купил! В игре осталось всего 6 персонажей: ассасин, танк, пулемётчик, снайпер, солдат и механик-хиллер. 2 режима игры, в одном вам нужно сражаться с другими игроками и сопроводить роботов к денежному шару, в защите вам помогут турели, их 4 вида: пулемёт, мортира, ракетница и вроде замедлялка, каждую турель можно улучшить несколько раз. В игре есть также спонсоры, которые дают разные бафы. А второй режим это защита денежного шара, 4 игрока будут отбиваться от волн роботов, в защите так же помогут турели. Так же присутствует прокачка, прокачать можно 4 параметра например ловкость броня и т.д. Жаль только что нету русской локализации, но этот минус сущий пустяк! 
    (3) Ребят, если вам нравится эта игра, то заходите в группу (нас там всего 6 человек) и начинайте играть вместе! А то захожу, а онлайн 0! Да это не SMNC, да тут всего лишь частичка от той игры, но если мы - комьюнити, будем поддерживать онлайн, есть шанс что разработчики вернутся и начнут развивать эту игру, это зависит от нас и только от нас!

j'ai ce jeu depuis longtemp, je n'y ai que tres peu jouer. ( j'ai meme encore un ""cadeau"" steam dans mon inventaire pour ""super monday night"" ( on y viendra plus tard) que j'ai obtenu avec le pack )

a l'époque deja, ce jeu ne m'attirai pas beaucoup. Fun 10 minutes , puis franchement barbant ( comme les barbares).
le multi etait pété a l'extreme, aucun équilibrage. était, car tout est mort aujourdhui.
le solo ? ah ben parlons s'en tien... le solo est encore plus barbant que des barbares barbotant barbants.
je voi des éval qui parle de ""bots"" ... j'ai rater quelque chose ?
parce qu'il n'y a pas de bots içi, on joue solo, seul sur la piste a tuer les vague ennemis ( qui bien évidement finiront par vous tuer en difficile, ou seront franchement ennuyeux en mode facile ), y a pas de bots allié ou ennemi. on est 100% solo.
on tue des ennemis et on construit des tours pour défendre sa base ( yup, tower defense le truc, seul mode de jeu dispo solo)
 en gros, je récapitule le systeme pourav des devs..

sorti de monday night combat > 
payant... > 
peu de succes... > 
sorti de ""super"" monday night combat > 
ce dernier est gratuit F2P... > 
succes temporaire car jeu toujours pété a l'équilibrage... > 
fermerture des serveur et suppression de SMNC... >
retour a MNC, toujours aussi pété mais completement abandonné.

au final, on a un jeu, vendu sur steam.. mais completement mort. mais c'est pas le F2P .. nope nope.. c'est bel et bien celui qui est payant.


franchement, évité ce jeu, il etait déja pas fameux, mais aujourdhui il est mort. ne vous faite pas avoir.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1471649515
The game basically has the same gameplay as Orc Must Die and Sanctum but with much less content.
There are 6 heroes with different style of game. Every hero has 2 weapons and different parameters. There are 4 towers which can be upgraded 3 times. There are 10-15 types of enemies. 

There is no single campaign. You just start one of 6 missions and play. First 5 are incredibly boring (there is no difficulty settings). The last one is tough, but, come on, there is only 1 interesting map... tt

The main feature is co-op. I think it is much more fun to play it with 4 players, but.. servers was shut down, so you can play only local... and I don't think you will find teammates in your neighborhood.

I liked concept of the world and a lot of jokes. Characters are funny and remind me Team Fortress.
In total, i think the game was good in 2011, but it can be good in present

- Nice concept of the world with a lot of jokes

Cons

- Single game has 6 maps. First 5 are incredibly boring. The last one is not enough to make the game good
- Only 4 towers
- Small enemy bestiary

This game is one of the greatest games of all time. Still currently the best 3rd person action-MOBA, and it's a dead game.
The art style captured in this game, mixed with the humor completely inspired games like StarBlood Arena (mixed with Decent), and made other bigger games like SMITE and Paragon possible.

The only con is that the devlopers are convinced their RTS title somehow could ever top the masterpiece of Monday Night Combat.

Whatever you're doing Uber Entertainment, drop it for a MNC 3, or some big sister version.

Such a shame that a really entertaining game like this had to die out (kind of like Savage Resurrection).  Even though the MNC community is completely dead, there are still 2 dedicated servers that I know of that are still running.  So if you have 3 other friends, and those 3 friends don't mind spending 5 bucks, this is an amazing game to play, even just 2v2.  SMNC is free, but it feels and plays very different to MNC.  

MNC combat is more dependent on your third-person shooter skills than SMNC.  Althought there are lane minions and towers like a MOBA, you don't have to worry about an item shop or counter building your enemy.  You can even switch classes on the fly nbd.  Maps are pretty varied, but are stuck to one lane of minions per team (usually), which turns out fine if you're only playing 2v2 (game doesn't make bots to fill in players spots D:).  However, there's a ton of verticality and variances in lines of sight (except for the 2 gimmicky maps) in this game.  So if you're thinking that one lane per team feels small or limiting, you'd be happily surprised.

Though this is not marketed as a MOBA, this is an economy game.  You get $$$ for taking out towers and minions, and get a lot for taking out boss minions and players.  Character progression is linear, but the $$$ can be used to buy extra lane minions (specific to each class), repair/buy/upgrade towers, detonate knockout bombs on the map (you can get kills through ring-outs), and buy a type of minion nuke (that is always placed in the center of the map and is only available at certain times --> causes huge, frantic firefights).  MNC has a pretty distinct art direction and tone, too.  The game is a sort of spoof or parody on televised football, so there are sports casters and advertisements for sponsors throughout your matches.  There's enough dialogue variations that what he says doesn't get old or annoying, and what is said is pretty funny.

Back when it was released on Xbox 360 Arcade, so many people jumped into this game and it was a HUGE success. Sadly, Uber Ent went and forgot about the Xbox 360 community and gave more attention to the PC version. They gave us only the Spunky Cola special DLC but never gave us the Uncle Tully's map and other DLCs they said we'd get. Eventually, they abandoned MNC on both sides, PC and Xbox and decided to make Super MNC. Community responded by not supporting Super MNC like they were hoping us to. Instead we enjoyed MNC for a much as would could until it slowly withered away.

Currently, this game is dead. The game itself is fun if people decide to jump in again and play. If Uber Ent would just drop the price of $5 and make it Free to play and just add some skins to customize your appearance WHICH DOES NOT ADD ANY STATS BOOSTS AND IS SOLELY FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES! Then they can get some money and MAYBE the community will slowly begin to revive itself. If you and some friends would like to play this game together and against each other for fun and laughs, go for it. They do have a co-op mode called Blitz. Blitz is pretty much a survival mode where you survive wave after wave of bots and you need to protect the Money Ball from getting destroyed. Blitz can be played offline. Crossfire is the multiplayer mode, it can be played offline but splitscreen, no AIs are allowed in this game for either game mode.

Hope this information helps anyone decide whether they want to spend money and try the game with friends, or wait until if it ever goes Free to Play.

Pros:

Cons:
- The tutorial blows through, leaving what it taught forgettable
- Nobody playing multiplayer
- Feels very abandoned by both, players and devs
- Singleplayer doesn't feel very diverse, just different difficulties
- Upgrade system might be a little too simple (not major, but it felt bland after other games)

Overall, I want to recommend MNC because it really could be fun, but the singleplayer leaves a lot to be desired and the multiplayer is dead.

tl;dr: Amazing, funny, fun team based third person shooter with minor MOBA elements that's saddly very, very dead currently. If you have friends and they're all willing, it's a fantastic game though.

I'll say this now, the original Monday Night Combat is one of my favorite games of all time.
It's a class based, PVP/PVE, team centric third person shooter set in a hilariously dark (but never seen) dystopian future where you compete as a group of clones fighting in a lethal sport in specially made and company branded arenas. 
Got all that? 
Oh and there's also upgrading skills, bacon, a mascot you shoot to get money, dual miniguns, half of the classes have jetpacks, light tower defense mechanics, taunting is a way you earn money AND a sexy mascot who's also the one providing you turrets?

There's light twinges of MOBAs in Monday Night Combat, but if that makes you cringe from past experiences with MOBAs, set it aside because everything is easy enough to understand and nowhere near as punishing as your typical MOBA.

The game plays like this: There are two teams, with ""bases"" on each side of the symmetrical map, each base has several spots where you can place turrets and a ""money ball"" to defend with its own shield which has to be destroyed for the other team to win. Each base also spawns bots (which can be killed to get cash)Act, which meet at the middle of the map and clash, but without players helping them out, they won't get far. The trick is that each money ball has a shield, one that can only be broken if a friendly bot reaches the enemy money ball. 
There's also the hilarious narrator who gives details about the setting and comments on how well you are playing. He doesn't really ever get old.
There's also a lot more I could talk about, like custom boost loadouts to be unlocked, each class has its own spawn-able bot type, chickey cantor... I could go on forever but I'll try to make this review short-er.

The good: It's funny, it's REALLY fun to play, it has a fantastic visual style, and the balancing is very good for the most part. It's just... really, really good. Also Chickey Cantor... gotta add at least a whole point on the review score for having a giant robotic chicken.

The bad: (Mostly nitpicks) Parts of it haven't aged so well, such as parts of the gunplay. The balance isn't perfect as that a few clases in the right hands can almost steamroll such as The Support and The Sniper. Losing isn't very fun, and sometimes you can get stuck in a losing game without much way of getting back up due to some bad investments. 

It's overall a fantastic game.
[b]HOWEVER, WARNING[/b]
Here's where the sad part of the review comes in... right now the multiplayer community is, except for a few groups who meet occasionally, pretty much dead. If you're wondering about my hours played being something like 1.6 or 1.9, it's because most of this game I played on the Xbox LIVE version, which had fewer maps and costumes but was still the same damn game you can buy here, and feels great with and without a controller. 
There's also Super Monday Night Combat, the Free 2 play ""sequel"" is available, which more or less dumbed down the importance of the shooty bits and made it feel a bit more like a typical MOBA, but also added a whole new roster of characters and another announcer that makes it twice as funny as the original MNC. It's also dead, but you can unlock items for TF2 and vice-versa. 
As for this game... most of what you can do now is join groups like [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hotshotsforever] Hotshots Forever [/url]. Sad to see such a good game go.",1438732508,1438732783,True,20,1,0.72439277172088623,0,True,False,False,False,

Too bad there is exactly one (1) dedicated server still running.


This game was basically a third-person shooter/MOBA hybrid with tower defense elements. (The free-to-play, pay-to-win sequel Super Monday Night Combat - which is currently only slightly less abandoned and which suffered from technical issues - was even more MOBA-like.)

Players chose from one of six classes that each played different roles, and money collected on the battlefield or earned from kills could be used to build turrets and upgrade player abilities. The range of mechanics available to the player was a bit confusing for newcomers even if less complex than any actual MOBA, especially when veteran TPS/MOBA players found the game more intuitive.

The two main modes were Blitz, which saw you and your team defending your Moneyball against hordes of robots, and Crossfire, which pitted your team against another team in a 6v6 game to destroy the other team's Moneyball with the help of allied robots; more or less DotA as a shooter.

The tutorial was basic: it only taught the basics of gameplay and how to play one class. Players had to consult more in-depth guides in order to effectively learn about the game.


MNC's world was briefly glimpsed yet revealing: it painted a picture of a totalitarian, consumerist society akin to the Roman Empire that hinted at darker aspects of our own world, where the downtrodden lower classes watched Monday Night Combat for cheap thrills.

The game's cartoony graphics weren't so stellar even when maxed out, but they served their purpose, and you wouldn't really have played this for the graphics anyway. Player customization was pretty good though, letting players choose outfits for the classes and pick a title to display gained from completing in-game achievements, such as killing a certain number of enemies. And the characters - the Pros - had some nice diversity going on: a Hawaiian, an African-American, and a woman comprised three of the six characters.

Overall, despite some flaws, the game was fun enough to earn a decently sized playerbase back in the day.


Okay, you're probably curious about my use of past tense, not to mention my implication that the game is dead. Well...

Official servers were shut down in 2012. The playerbase relies on two [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hotshotsforever]Steam[/url] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/longlivemnc]groups[/url] to gather players for matches either on the lone public server or temporary private ones, and you can bet that most of their small number are skilled enough to utterly stomp newer players.

There's single-player Blitz available, but there is no single-player Crossfire with AI players, which means that the Crossfire-related achievements are pretty much extremely difficult to get - and are practically no longer attainable without farming. And that's terrible.


So what happened to Monday Night Combat?

Lack of support is the most obvious problem. Microsoft wouldn't let developers Uber Entertainment update the 360 version, and they ran out of money to keep updating the PC version. The small team of devs had to jump through a lot of hoops just to get the game released. This led to disengagement from the community and an inability to address their concerns.

Polygon ran [url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/3/19/4094472/uber-hail-mary-monday-night-combat]an article[/url] that illustrated these problems; it's worth reading if you're curious.

Tying into the inability to be engaged with and work on the game, MNC's balance wasn't all that good either from what I can tell. Skilled Snipers and Assaults were difficult to counter. Cheesy tactics abounded, such as excessive use of ricocheting weapons and sniping turrets from outside their range rendering them somewhat ineffective for point defense.

The ability for players to supercharge, and the use of what was basically a doomsday weapon located in the center of every arena, meant a losing team could effectively blunt the winning team's progress if they gained the upper hand. Hackers were a problem, the lack of community development tools/an SDK was a different problem; Tanks, Gunners and grapples were borderline overpowered off the bat, while the Assassin was apparently underpowered.


The only way you can [i]really[/i] play this game now is to gather a group of friends and host your own server. I suppose that since this game originally came out in 2010, it could only have lasted for so long. It's a shame the devs didn't include player AI for Crossfire mode - even with its flaws, that's the one thing that would have ultimately saved this game from its ignoble death.

At least Uber Entertainment survived, and would go on to create large-scale RTS [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/233250/]Planetary Annihilation[/url] - another flawed yet interesting game.

The little time I spent with Monday Night Combat was pretty fun, and it certainly had potential. The [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdVThYnVrpY]main menu song[/url] was pretty good, at any rate. But I really cannot recommend it.

What can i say? Don't bother. There's a good game in there but you can hardly play it. The first thing i noticed were input and settings related bugs. Then crashes. But worst of all, no servers and the inability to actually create a co-op room and invite you friends (remember, it was advertised to have this feature).

If you're lucky, you may still find a dedicated server, which most likely will be empty. If you create your own lobby, you will be unable to invite your friends and your friends won't be able to see it in the server browser (we tried it, multiple times and with multiple settings/solutions).

The only way to play this online, is to get into one of the two empty servers i have found and let your friend join them too. The downside is, you can't select the game mode or map and you most likely end up in opposing teams (1vs1 basically).

It's a shame, really, because the game itself promoses to be fun. I don't care if this was released on 2011. It's still sold and advertised on steam and i expect the advertised features to work. It may be ""just"" 10 bucks, but i want it back anyway.

I originally purchased it on Xbox 360 back in 2010 after I fell in love playing the trial version. (This was back when people actually played the game, and the servers weren't totally dead.) I think that was when the MOBA craze was just taking off, but this did something original with the formula that I hadn't seen anywhere before... It's a class-based shooter like TF2 but the game plays like League of Legends -- you protect your home base's ""crystal"" from the opposing team's minions (all different kinds of robots, in this case). What makes this formula even more interesting is that your ""towers"" (turrets) are selected and upgraded by YOU and your team using the ""gold"" you get from killing the enemy team and their minions. And to top this all off, it has a crazy, silly, cartoony atmosphere and art style, and it acts like it's a reality game show/sport (hence the title), complete with a witty announcer.

I picked up a 4-pack for super cheap a few months ago to share with friends, but... Sadly, since no one really plays it anymore, all you're really left with is the 1-4 player ""tower defense"" co-op mode -- you choose your turrets to defend against waves of the different kinds of robots and defend your crystal.

Eventually, they released a sequel in 2012 (Super MNC), but it was a free-to-play, microtransaction mess only available on PC. It was awkward and boring with none of the charm of the original (read: hat simulator), and I don't think anyone plays that anymore either.

Really, MNC is the predecessor to the likes of Smite, Gigantic (RIP), and MOBAs in general... If you can pick this game up for a buck or two, maybe you could get some friends together to play it, even if it's just the co-op mode. Sure, you didn't get to play it in its heyday, but you still get to play something different.",1418584799,1526270535,True,8,1,0.568502366542816162,2,False,False,False,False,

The graphics are appealing to look at especially if you're into the cartoony TF2 style, and the game plays very smoothly.  Overall a very fun experience and perfectly priced.

So why am I not recommending this?  For one simple reason; the company behind this game seriously fucked up everything that made it even playable.  

All servers are down, and to make it worse you can't even create your own without the game just crashing on you.  So the only way to play this game is to play it solo, which defeats the entire purpose of a fun multiplayer tower defense game.

А колорит, стиль этой игры, о нём ниже .

Вся игра предвстает пред игроком в виде гиганской арены на которой проводятся бои, 2 команды (Синие и Оранжевые) дружно вешают друг другу люлей подручными предметами, (а если точно - Пулеметами, ПП, базуками, плазменными резаками, и прочими огнестрельными прелестями) Арен естевственно несколько типов, на каждой присутствуют Т.Т (Турельные точки) из которых игрок может постоить приглянувшуюся ему турель которая будет отстреливать всё приближающееся что не покрашено в цвет вашей команды. А в частности ботов, которые есть у каждой команды, и которые одним маршрутом передвигаются к базе противника (и это не те боты которые втыкают на просторах локаций в игровых скинах, это линейные боты которые следуют определенному маршруту, и ресаются ""волнами"", уровень интелекта (ИИ) таких ботов колеблется между - уровнем ии Чайного пакетика и губной помады)

Естевственно на базе каждой команды есть что-то ""эдакое"" что команда противника должна заполучить или ликвидировать, и в случае этой игры это -Денежный шар- при ликвидации которого из него выпадает гиганское количество монет, символизируя о том что проигравшая команда теперь банкроты. 
Но конечно-же даже создатели столь необычной игры не могли обойтись без старого-доброго занюханого оборонительного режима, который есть в большинсве игр, он как... как Калаш, Вездесуш и Вечен.
В этом самом оборонительном режиме вам как всегда прийдется оборонятся от орды тупых как валянок ботов, с целью продержатся как можно дольше. Тут то и открывается вся уникальность этой игры, Вы появляетесь на арене и вроде-бы всё как всегда... Турели есть, Денежный шар есть, член на месте парик тоже, чего-же не хватает? Орды дибилковатых ботов? да нет вот она... И что же изменилось? а то что на ботах Рекламы похлеще чем на Маршрутках, (хорошо что бренды рекламы придуманы и созданы самими разработчиками) а то представьте себе ситуацию, минут 40 отстреливались от роботов, большой палец правой ноги сломан, под глазом фингал, бронежилет (в про100народье телогрейка) порван в баню! в ухе топор, патроны на исходе, и тут... выползает финальный босс, гиганский как косяк у Марадонны, и опасный как челябинский хомячок, а на ж_пе у него накатано -Прокладки Always сухо даже когда мокро!- ваша реакция на это похлеще чем у гопника на iphone. 

Ну и кончено просирать своё время в Оборонительном режиме, вы сможете со своими друзьями которые наверняка оценят творчество поддатых но изобретательных разработчиков - MnC.

Thanks to steam you don't really need to be serious about entertainment to put out a game. No need to design a box, set up distribution, invest in alternative forms of advertising or just put a solid effort into it. Now you can just take the initial influx of money that you received from all the rubes that thought a business had to stand behind their products, pull op anchor, sail around the island, drop anchor in the exact same place and sell the exact same crap again.

The first few weeks, even months at times, will be very frustrating & hard because the game's learning is curve is just way too steep to actually just get in & start owning back & forth.

Most people make the mistake of thinking that this game is totally like TF2, & thus if they were good at TF2 expect very similar results here. I being one of those people I found out the hard way that being a good TF2 player really has no science. TF2's learning curve is very low so that people will get used to it. On my own personal experience all of the people who have this game, & played right after coming out of TF2 has raged.

The Dota aspects are in the idea of defending a Moneyball while spewing out minions to attack it. Tower Defense comes in as turrets to shoot these robot minions. The class based teams of Team Fortress 2 are in the characters players use to control their class. Now, the game adds its own series of unique spins by putting it in 3rd person and having its own challenges. The single player mode is to defend the Moneyball while multiplayer is to attack the enemy and defend the objective. Unique gameshow type minigames are in each mode, where players have the opportunity to shoot a mascot for prizes. Together as a mix it is confusing for newcomers to adapt to the style, but mastering it turns it into a load of fun.

Monday Night Combat (better abbreviated as MNC) has been compared to the likes of Team Fortress 2 and Defense of the Ancients (DotA). The former, I don't really see, other than the fact that MNC uses classes. The latter seems like a more reasonable comparison.

MNC pits you in a tug-of-war-like battle where teams, supported by AI controlled minions, attempt to push into their opponent's base to destroy the central structure, the ""Moneyball"". The combat system is akin to an RPG-FPS in that you level up as you kill enemy minions, players, or turrets. Leveling up grants you the ability to upgrade any one of three skills unique to each of the six classes.

All the while this is going on, an announcer will be making snide and crude comments which not only adds character to the game, but hilarity. This is a colorful, competitive shooter one should definitely not miss out on!

One other thing I didn't really like were the controls for the 3 powers each character has. They aren't mapped in a way that you can press them quickly without confusing yourself. I've had countless times where I pressed the wrong key. It's a fast paced game, and the buttons are color coded with a number, that's it. Yes, you can map the keys yourself, but you're missing the point. The developers chose this specific control scheme. But it just doesn't make any sense. I had rather seen buttons with the correct keys on them, or icons that show exactly what the buttons do. It's a small, but important thing. Still, if you love (ok, ok... - or like - your choice) team based third person shooters this might just be the game for you. Definately worth a few tries.

Some people compare it to TF2 but other than some basic designs such as the class system I'd call that a lazy comparison. It plays and feels like an arena combat sports game where you are making a push towards the enemy money ball and with the help of your bots(creeps) you drop the shields and destroy it. The classes are a bit more hybridized that TF2. For instance there is a class that is like the medic and engy rolled together. You get to choose which stats to boost with money you earn through kills on bots and other players. You can also purchase and upgrade turret towers at fixed points in the map to slow the progress of the other team. It's a fun, cheap, sort of repatetive game that you can play when you want something a bit different.

The gameplay is frantic, strategical, and always a blast to play. But it's really the stylized characters and writing that help to make the experience so memorable. The gameplay is complimented by some hilarious dialogue that really brings the futuristc world of MNC to life. Think a parody of 1984 that's treated with just the right amount of humor and you'll get the picture.

Also, only one has played more than 50 hours.

I've yet to play more than two rounds of MNC myself, due to incompatibilities with my computer...I'd like to play, and if I could, I would play it occasionally, but that won't be happening anytime soon. :(",1303360766,1385763940,False,2,0,0.500244498252868652,3,False,False,False,False,

The game has a fairly large learning curve, in that you'll need to spend some time learning one particular class to get into it.

Monday Night Combat (""MNC"") muses over the savage events that once took place in the ancient Colosseum, notably gladiatorial combat and the slaying of exotic beasts. MNC draws parallels to these events now alien to modern humans tamed with the domesticated and subdued format of what we now call ""sports."" In MNC, the combatants are not only supposed to mutilate one another, but also unautonomous ""bots"" on their way to glory. 

In the background is the audience; in the most literal sense of what Guy Debord calls ""the spectacle,"" we see the audience of MNC as mere shadows, replaced and defined instead by their fetish for the merciless spectacle of the arena.

In practice, this game focuses less on racking up kills and soloing objectives (a near-impossible task), and requires teamwork and killing AI bots more than other players, which results in rewarding kills and less frustration for players who often have trouble staying alive.

All the classes have their niche, and it is actually quite difficult to be a liability to your team.

It's set in a gameshow in the future where you play as a contestent (one of 6 classes --> Sniper, Support, Tank, Gunner, Assault, Assassin).  There are 2 modes crossfire (PvP) and Blitz (Co-op).  Crossfire is the mode that I play the most.  Basically it's a 6 on 6 arena where your goal is to get your team's bots past the enemy's turrets in order to take down their moneyball.  Once the moneyball's shields are down, you can attack it.  Lots of strategy is involved though due to the varying skills that each of the classes come armed with.  You'll need to take out enemy players, enemy bots and enemy turrets before you can get your bots in.  There are environmental hazards you can use to your advantage, you can upgrade yourself in-game, you can buy/upgrade turrets, and you can even purchase additional bots to come help you out.

I highly recommend this game, but do be forewarned that the player-base is currently pretty small.
