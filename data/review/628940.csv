- Currently have completed what the game currently has to offer; roughly two levels.  More will be on the way, according to information on the Store Page.
- For the 1st 2 levels, I had to get help from the developer on how to solve the clues to progress.  All the information you need is there, I was just having some difficulty in filtering through relevant versus non-relevant information.  I don't know if I would consider the 1st 2 levels as training levels or not, but a training level probably would've helped me out.
- I've been in contact with the developers on their Discord page, and they have been very responsive and friendly.
- I've got no regrets about purchasing the game; I just wish I was a little smarter to solve this without looking for help.

An 'Initial Impressions' Review
Using: Valve Index, i7-8700, 16GB RAM, 1070Ti

Make sure to read the game description carefully before purchasing.  For what I've played so far, I would best describe this as a VR-based point and click adventure. Witthin the game, you do not get to walk around, you get to observe everything from a fixed position, using some detective gear Batman would be proud of, to figure out what is going on around you. (I'm still in the building lobby).
At the Main Menu, you will need the designated play area required to navigate and make selections (again, no movement options).

Pros:
- More than serviceable graphics to get the job done.  The atmosphere is currently somewhere between the Die Hard (movie) building, and a slight touch of Blade Runner.  The environment feels both contemporary and slightly futuristic).
- Although you can't move around in-game (so far), you do have a VR body to look at. Liz seems to be the default body, so being a guy, you can guess what I was staring at for the first 45 seconds.
The Arm length seems a bit off from reality (the game's elbows were in my physical forearm), and my VR knees stick out further than my chest, so when I bend down I should be falling backwards.
- This is a slow-burn game, so don't expect guns-a-blazing early on.  It seems very procedural in building up the world around you, so try to take the time to learn about the world around you.
 
Cons: 
- While the game is designed from a fixed position, being able to move around in-game would add much to the immersion factor of the game (smooth locomotion and turning is my preference).
- Your default hand position feels almost 90 degress to your actual position in real life. To fire the gun in the firing range, I almost had to point down physically to fire straight in-game.  This area needs a manual adjustment badly.
- Your detective gear interface is serviceable but clunky (sometimes what I was trying to choose was one off from what I wanted).
- The Valve Index controller used the sensor bar as the 'back' button essentially (grip hard to go back to the previous sub-menu).  Not a bad implementation, but having the 'B' button to do the same thing would be so much easier.
- Some areas of the main menu (VR Training) do not seem accessible yet.
- The Scroll Wheel for inputting a code is way too sensitive.

For myself, the term 'diamond in the rough' applies here.  The game design slightly disappoints, but they did state it clearly in the description. The potential for some level of detective work is present, but I haven't gotten far enough to render a verdict.  My first hour of the game was split between playing the game and figuring out how to play the game.

I don't plan to refund the game, as I am intrigued by the concept of the game.  Hopefully the integration of the concept and execution will be a positive experience.",1572786793,1573516990,True,7,0,0.63158947229385376,2,True,False,True,False,,,
