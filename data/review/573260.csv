I gave it two tries and then I was finished with it. Here is why: 

When the game begins you start with a pistol, and a wave of aliens insects attack you from the front. You are stationary. There is limited movement but you are essentially a turret. It took me a few tries to get past the first wave. With the pistol these insect aliens take many shots. They move slowly but because they take so many hits to kill every shot counts, so you need to score dozens of hits and hope to kill them before they reach you. It is all very monotonous and boring. 

Once they reach you they stand around the crate thing that represents your body, and your life starts slowly draining. You will eventually die from this obviously. After figuring this out getting to wave 2 wasn't difficult, just boring. I could not find many options as far as switching weapons or finding power ups. Just the one weak pistol. If someone explains how to choose different weapons a la Space Pirate Simulator I will revisit the game, but this is effectively space pilot simulator minus the ability to move and dodge, ability to choose multiple weapons and shields, enemies that are a challenge to hit, ranged attacks, and cool backgrounjd atmosphere.

The best I can say about this game is that the graphics are pretty good, although the levels I played were cramped and bland. I always feel bad giving a game a negative review, and always trie to find something good to say about a game because I buy games based on positive reviews and I understand that games that don't appeal to me aren't necessarily bad, but this game has no saving graces.",1521919333,1521919363,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Small aliens approach you, but you have only one weapon in your right hand.

Visuals were ok. but you can go get some better wave shooter than this.

It is basically a wave shooter and not even a good one. Didn't have to play more in order to see this. Actually the first second you hold the plastic toy weapon in your hand you will exactly know that this game was not even worth the sale price of 2,79 EUR. Just publish games like this for free. And use the lessons learned to make an even better game. But no reason to make people pay for this.

Not recommended.

I wouldn't know I killed em if it wasn't for the sound.  I want dramatic deaths.  Maybe smaller ones coming out of them or some curling up animation like when you actually squish one.  You got that big ole sky on survival mode.  Bring the enemies in with some cool ships.  I feel like I'm just shooting at the ground the whole time. I wanna see some games in vr that manipulate the ground around you.  It's a great scare to feel like there's an edge to be causious of.  Maybe an alien or spider that removes the floor around you by using some sort of acid.  Use your room space a bit more.  Good work though guys.

　　游戏打击感极弱，击打目标的过程中，目标不会有丝毫僵直反应，只会在最后死亡的时候，非常浮夸地表演一个即将断气的挣扎。
　　游戏过程中，玩家眼前会戴着一个有着蓝色荧光的面罩，上面会显示玩家当前的血量等等，但是具有边框限制的面罩十分影响玩家的视线范围，体验中会挡住四周，只给玩家留下中央视线区域。
　　游戏在Steam商店中售价为31元人民币，就目前的体验以及游戏制作来看，性价比偏低，建议想要体验简单射击的玩家们，在其进行大约50%的折扣活动时，再考虑进行购买。
