Nowhere near a simulation. You just start and head over to your enemy shooting anything that moves. Not tactics involved. The enemy AI is stupid is hell, the gameplay is dump and repetitive. No missions, no campaign, no explanation, no manual no help. the Main menu has one option ""Start Game"" and then you are imediatly thrown into action.
You can switch between MG, main gun and auto aiming Rockets capable of destroying multiple enemys at once (why you want to use any of the other two weapons is beyond me), ammo is unlimited, etc.. 
The enemy isn't firing back at you and he seems to refuse to do anything usefull.

The worst game I played since Bitch Train. If this rings a bell to you, then you know what I'm talking about. Don't buy it, honestly.",1475260467,1475260467,False,58,2,0.808233559131622314,0,True,False,False,False,,,
