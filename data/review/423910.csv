That is about what I would recommend anyone spend on Mangavania. Anything more is overpriced.

The game itself isn't bad...but it is just pretty much average. The black and white look didn't bother me, except for the spikes (that even still being red) were sometimes hard to see. There are a lot of cheap hits..especially the bat tossers. (I think they are bats.) Nothing in this game is going to wow you. And i really don't see playing for more than like 30 mins at a time before wanting a break.

The game is poorly named though. It sounds like an adventure, and starts off designed like one....but then turns out to be a speed running game with 20 levels.

The weird thing about it is, unlike others, I actually enjoyed the music. It just fits the mood in such a cheesy way.

I wouldn't go out of my way if I were you to get it and pay full price. But for $1 it is possible to squeeze enough out of it to get your money's worth. If it started at $1, I'd actually change my thumb.",1704616151,1704616151,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This game is tiny speedrun levels that are brought down by controls that decide when to work.

- You collect a certain number of Navi looking things to open the door to leave
- You can find a hidden character in each level
- the level grades you on your performance

This is the entire game. There's 20 levels that you can finish in less than a minute each. You do have a boss fight happen a few times as well, but it's bogged down by a fight that requires responsive controls. Then, while rushing through levels, you add your character not attacking or jumping half the time when you clearly pressed the button into the mix, and reset because an enemy hit you that you either killed or jumped over on your end of the controls. It's worse than I can explain because it works more than it doesn't, so it just happens unsuspectingly randomly when you're playing and it ruins the entire feeling of rushing through levels.

This game is not a Metroidvania; it's more like a 2D platformer with progression elements.
This game is not hard; the controls are not completely responsive. 
This game is not fun; it's bland and incredibly repetitive. 
I didn't give up halfway through; I got so bored that I just didn't care about getting the achievements anymore.

I could see this art style doing well in an ACTUAL Metroidvania game, but this clearly isn't what I expected when I was looking into this game.",1703918022,1703918022,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Game runs fine, Experienced no screen tearing or any performance issues at all,  I did get some shrooms that popped up underground in the roof when i attacked, but that just seems to be a graphical glitch and nothing serious gives me nostalgia from back in the day ^.^

The game is pretty casual with maybe 5 levels that are challenging to the point you may need to do them more than once.
The art style is awesome.
There's 4 upgrades but you don't start needing them until mission 11 and up
There's only 2 bosses 1 on 10 and 20.
There's a time limit that grades you on your performance.
Can 100% just by completing all the levels.
Trading Cards!!

Cons
Too short: Game can be ran through pretty quick if you're not looking for the spirits(the levels collectible)
Fairly easy: Doesn't require a lot of effort to complete
Time Trials: As I mentioned before There's a time limit,(not to finish, just for a rank) but no achievement for getting an A rank so there's no real reason to do it besides to challenge yourself, Me personally, if there's no achievement for doing it I'm not doing it, I have too many games to waste time for no reward.(I still attempted them LMAO)
Spirits: There's one in each level, Some are hidden nicely some in the path to the exit, Also no achievement for getting them all, but I didn't realize that until I'd found all of them, but again without an achievement there's not point in looking for them besides to extend your playtime.

All in all I'd liked it to be a little harder and have a little more game, but I do believe that it was a solo developer so for 1 guy they did a great job, I got the 4.99 it costed out of the game so I'm happy with my experience.
Maybe an update will add achievements for A ranks and finding all the spirits and hopefully more levels.
Looking forward to another Title from this dev, The game was well made and a solid experience.

Disclosure aside, I felt compelled to write a review simply because I read the negative one that is currently on the very top of the review section, and I completely disagree with all of it.

This game is a retro-style platformer. Truth be told, I didn't even find it to be that difficult. I completed the game and got an 'S' rank on probably half of the levels in about 90 minutes. I had no issues with the ""blind drops"" or ""projectiles fired off screen"" as the other review reports. Mangavania really isn't any different than any other platformer in that regard. If you find those things to be game-breaking or overly difficult, you either aren't familiar with platforming games or maybe just aren't that skilled at them. This is okay, of course, but I wouldn't dare to suggest that it is the game's fault. The game is not ""unfair"" and it didn't take ""luck to beat it"" when I played it.

I also did not have a single issue with the screen tearing or with the visual graphics. The game ran smooth and looked fine.

The only potential ""hitbox issue"" that I encountered was during the first boss fight, and even then I think I was just trying to go too fast and wasn't fighting the boss as intended. Once I slowed down and just fought the boss carefully, I got it on the first attempt.

That being said, the game isn't perfect by any means. My main complaint with the game was the fact that you couldn't remap the controller buttons. I played on a PS4 controller and the default mapping just doesn't feel right. Instead of what seems to be the typical mapping in other games of say, X to jump and square to attack, square is jump and circle is attack, with the other two buttons being used as well. Even when you get used to it after playing for a while, it still feels awkward and you occasionally hit the wrong button when you are in the heat of the moment, which usually damages or kills you. Additionally, the home menu can also be hard to navigate. I ended up using the mouse and keyboard to choose levels and buy powerups, while I used the controller to actually play the game. Not ideal, but doable.

The monochrome black and white graphics were fine with me, but I could see them being a potential problem with certain people. Someone in my stream chat mentioned in the past that these types of graphics give them headaches, and I could also see issues for people with epilepsy. 

Lastly, the story is pretty underwhelming. The about section states ""Join the adventure as Yuhiko, a young ninja who has gone to the underworld to find a cure for his brother. Free the lost souls to advance to the next level. Find Spirits in secret places – they will tell you a story or give you advice. Explore dungeons, fight monsters and meet new friends!"" It is never stated (or perhaps I missed) what is wrong with your brother or how you got into the underworld, or why you need to free these random lost souls to progress through the stages. Characters met along the way don't really give you any interesting or helpful information, and it just seems like filler text for the most part. Lastly, the final boss fight didn't really feel like a big boss fight, and then the game just kind of...ended. No story text or even a basic ""YOU WIN"" message appeared. I just sat there wondering, ""Is that really it?""

TL;DR For the price, this game is worth it. It isn't groundbreaking and there isn't much of a story to it, but it's a tight little platformer that feels good to play and will take you a few hours to complete. If you like platformers and the game aesthetic doesn't bother you, pick it up and give it a shot.",1678372490,1678372523,True,7,0,0.609942257404327393,0,False,True,False,True,,,

Literally manga-style metroidvania(?) 2D side-view action platformer. 20 stages to beat. Get faster and get better in-game evaluation. Simple, permanent passive upgrades, and fair price.

マンガ調の見た目をウリとする、20面クリア型のドット絵プラットフォーマー。良くも悪くも価格相応という感じではあった。軽快に操作して先に進むことができる（後半は高難易度）。

操作方法、オプションなどは一切なく説明もありません。
操作方法はASWD、矢印キーのどちらでも移動。スペースでジャンプ。Rキーで攻撃 E,Fキーで各種アビリティ発動。なぜかクリア後やマップ選択はマウスでの操作になります。特にクリア後はマウス以外受け付けていない模様？（パッドは未使用なので不明）
ゲーム内での目的は、各エリア内で飛んでる白い鳥を右上の数だけ攻撃して集めます。するとゴールのドアが開くのでそこを超えればクリア。エリアによっては鍵やすり抜け壁なども。
クリアすると評価値でポイントが貰え、それぞれ30Pでアビリティの購入が可能。同じ面を何度クリアしても貰える様子。
それぞれエリア選択時にグレーのキャラが存在し、発見すると+10P入手できる。
表に出てるマップ数は20個。
基本的には評価Sを目指し最短ルートを探す。各キャラを探す。クリアスピードでC～Sランクに振られる。敵を倒す、総被ダメ等は評価に加算されない様子。

総感想
敵や被ダメを無視してひたすら走り、最短コースを詰め、意味深な壁がすり抜けれないかを探すゲームでした。
購入できるダッシュが回避能力はないものの、微加速+攻撃なのでひたすら移動中はこちらを押すだけ。(接触＝ダメージの敵だとワンパンできない限り被弾するが)
さらに敵がいるものの特に意味はない箇所などもあるが、そもそも初見でS狙いは厳しいので初回はほぼお散歩になる為必要だったのか。
[strike] また購入用ポイントは無制限に手に入るが、探索等で何度も周回すると序盤で全購入できてしまった為、恐らく2段ジャンプ以外は縛り用と思われる。 [/strike]
短時間で遊べるのでTA系が好きな方にはおすすめ。

[b] Summary: [/b]  

Look, every game has gameplay elements that are matched for it: not every feature doesn't have merit in the right circumstances. For example, some people don't like slow deliberate combat, but that doesn't make it bad if it's complemented with the right enemy design, level design, and tone. But there are certain things that every game cannot do: or the game will end up frustrating the player. After 30 minutes of playing Mangavania, I found myself turning it off in not only frustration, but wondering how a game got so many things wrong in a short period.

For example, when you have blind drops in a platformer and can immediately be hit by a bullet that was firing during that time off screen, and it ends up killing you: that's a game halter. The player shouldn't feel like it's just luck they got through things and that the game is blatently unfair, but Mangavania manches to do that. It doesn't help that even though the tags seem to be right, using the vania name when you're not a metroidvania is a little bit frustrating. The presentation is fine for mobile, but if you're going to bring your game to PCs: Vsync. The game tore more then the Doomslayer in the bowels of hell: and you should have realized that 5 seconds into testing on the release. Yes, there's other solutions to that, but it's also a game....that really feels like a demo. Like, there's nothing unique, the gameplay is straight forward and not that challenging yet frustrating at the same time, and even seems to have hitbox issues.

Just a straight up pass.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
[list]
[*] Game Design will frustrate you left and right, with leaps of faith into death and just bad level design.
[*] Dull. 
[*] Feels like there's hitbox/collision problems.
[*] It shows its mobile roots in the presentation in a bad way. Sound design in particular just sorta feels very unrefined. 
[*] I'm not sure why it's monochrome. Like, it doesn't add a lot to the experience.
[*] No options/VSync made it frustrating to experiene.
