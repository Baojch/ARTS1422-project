It has some options. It is super cheap and I got it myself in a bundle. So it was even cheaper. Unfortunately the gameplay is a bit confusing and chaotic. Yeah, this might be a party game for 1 EUR. That's all. 

Buy it if you love VR tacos. If you leave it aside, you won't miss anything. It's a game for some minutes of fun. That's all.

There's nothing here. You can get a good score by simply standing in one spot and allowing the tacos the smack you in the face in time trial mode. In survival mode it's bit harder, but that's mainly to do with crappy Minecraft like graphics. Another review noted this is a good party game. It's not. If you use this game to show others a VR experience, they more than likely will never try VR again. Not recommended.",1488137855,1488137855,False,4,0,0.559118211269378662,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game runs fine but eating tacos is not as easy as it looks. I am giving it a thumbs up because it is very cheap and some people will have fun with it. It has leaderboards as well. 

Here is a short video to get a view of the game.

　　作为一款休闲游戏，像素的画风也不是那么难以接受。但是玩家的游玩空间只有小小的一个范围，飞来的三明治全都往脸上砸去，也不需要多大的体感动作就能将它们全部接住。
　　在生存模式下，玩家需要利用手中的炮筒将飞向玩家的炸弹全部击落，否则砸在脸上的就不止是三明治这样无害的东西了。
　　总的来说，游戏的玩法比较特别，也比较有趣，算是普通游戏的水准，要是喜欢这个类型游戏的玩家可以尝试体验。
