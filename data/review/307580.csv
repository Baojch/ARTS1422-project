Blackwell serisi haricinde oynadığım belli başlı oyunları Primordia (çok iyi) ve Strangeland (başyapıt). Technobabylon'u fazla bir beklentim olmadan oynamaya başladım ve açıkçası çok memnun kaldım. Karşımızda harika bir point & click var.
Öncelikle hikayeden başlayayım. Technobabylon tahmin edeceğiniz üzere bir cyberpunk thriller. Evet, çok kez yapıldı ve tarzın klişelerinin büyük kısmı (sanal gerçeklik, zihin kontrolü, ajanlar, gizli güçler, politik komplolar) bu oyunda da var. Ancak hikaye o kadar iyi kurgulanmış ve vurucu ayrıntılar ile desteklenmiş ki bu klişeler gözünüze hiç batmıyor. Karakterler iyi işlenmiş ve birbirleriyle ilişkileri son derece gerçekçi.
Oyun tıpkı bir roman gibi bölüm bölüm ilerliyor. Her bölümde farklı bir karakteri yönetiyoruz. Bölümler çok güzel tasarlanmış, zaman atlamaları ve flashback'ler yerinde. Oyun aslen bir çeşit interaktif roman tecrübesi sunuyor. Bu da bence iyi Point & Click oyunlarını güçlü kılan en önemli özellik. Asla boş boş deneme yanılma yöntemi ile bulmaca çözmeye çalışmıyorsunuz.
Oyun dedektiflik / bulmaca çözme dengesini çok iyi kurmuş. Hikayeyi diyaloglar üzerinden çözüyorsunuz ancak bulmacalar da çok yerinde ve bir kısmı o kadar akıllıca tasarlanmış ki şapka çıkarmamak elde değil (bkz. vücut sıcaklığı bilmecesi). Bilmeceler asla kendini tekrarlamıyor, öyle ki bir bölümde ilerlemek için 3 karakteri birden ayrı ayrı yönetiyorsunuz. Kısacası platformun olanaklarını yapımcılar sonuna dek kullanmış. Oyunun belirli yerlerinde yapacağınız seçimlerin finali etkiliyor olması da hoş ayrıntı.
Oyunun görselliği bana özellikle Beneath A Steel Sky ve Fate Of Atlantis'i anımsattı. Seslendirmeler güzel. Müzikler de fena sayılmaz.
Oyunla ilgili söyleyeceğim olumsuz bir şey yok. Baştan sona tamamlamam 11 saat sürdü ve bu gayet iyi bir süre. Neticede türü sevenlere şiddetle tavsiye ederim. Son 10 yılın en iyi birkaç Point & Click oyunundan biri.",1704112840,1704112840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The positive: the puzzles are really good. Other than at the very end when the game gets buggy and the objectives unclear, they are solid retro puzzles like the best of the Lucasarts era. Despite my distaste for the rest of the game I finished it because the puzzles were that satisfying.

The negatives:
- For me, the story is not compelling. It's self-consciously bleak and the characters are boring cliches. I had trouble keeping some of the minor characters' motivations and origins straight in my head. 

- The game has odd pacing. Some of the chapters are flashbacks where there is no meaningful gameplay, just clicking on characters to reveal some backstory. The chapters didn't feel balanced in length or difficulty.

- Probably the largest negative: the humor in old school moon logic puzzles is, to me, fundamentally incompatible with the gratuitous gruesomeness of the game. The game requires you to kill or maim many NPCs. There's pointless gore, shocking deaths, even gross sound effects. I'm not a fan of that kind of ambiance in and of itself, but juxtaposed with the (wonderful) silliness of the puzzles it felt really crude and disturbing.

It started off cool but then suffered from the same pitfall as some other point and click games, where the thing you're supposed to find is so obscure I promise you won't ever find it unless you look it up.
Not great puzzle design toward the end.
3 out of 5 because some of it was cool and the ambiance was good as well.

The puzzles usually make quite a bit of sense unlike many other games in the genre. However, puzzle quality can be a bit inconsistent from chapter to chapter. Especially the stealth puzzles are a bit silly with blind and deaf NPC's, but overall, they are logical and fun to solve. I only had to look for solutions in a few occasions when I was really stuck. A hint system could have been helpful, as well as a note taking system for useful information. 

The story is quite captivating, but towards the end some of it turns into a noodle. 

The VO is mostly top notch with the exception of a few mediocre sounding side characters.

For me, Technobabylon is somewhere in between. But since I cannot fully recommend the game, I've decided to give it a thumbs down, since there are so many other options out there. But if you love dystopian, retro Point & Click Adventures like Gemini Rue, Whispers of a Machine or Primordia, then you probably won't regret playing Technobabylon.

First of all, I love Point & Click adventures and I love the 1990s (S)VGA optics. Overall, Technobabylon does do a good job capturing the look & feel. There are a few inconsistencies with some of the models which are more detailed than others, too detailed compared to the rest, which does feel out of place. 

The world this game takes place in is intriguing and relatively well fleshed out without spending too much time on exposition. The story starts out interesting enough and one can tell that some thought went into the different factions and their motivations. However, in the end, it just doesn't seem to come together and the story somewhat peters out. Particularly the motivation of what turns out to be the main villain is unclear and possibly a bit contrived. 

The puzzles are adequate, sometimes also a bit contrived, but mostly fine. Towards the very end, it became a bit tricky and unclear. Especially one puzzle was totally uncleear to me and I had to consult a walkthrough, which I hate to do.

A significant part of the game takes place in the ""Trance"", a ""Matrix"" style virtual reality where people can plug in to. It's a neat idea, though the execution feels a bit off. The appeal of the ""Trans"" which turns many of the inhabitants of the world into addicts just does not translate onto the screen. It feels boring and mundane and one wonders why it's so popular within the universe of Technobabylon.

All in all a okay game with an adequate length, not as short as many other smaller Point & Click adventures. For fans of the genre it's worth giving a try. For everyone else, I'd recommend to give it a pass.",1685186959,1685186959,False,0,0,0.483870983123779297,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Technobabylon is one of those game that technically has no right to be as good as it is. What you have is essentially a one person developer, albeit with an excellent publisher and two extremely talented artists. And yet out of this Technocrat Games have created one of the most concise, gripping and well-crafted worlds I have ever encountered in a video game. No dialogue, no item description is wasted. Everything tells you something new - and out of all these pieces of information the game's world begins to form, a somehow utopian and simultanously dystopian vision of the future. But even if you decide to focus mainly on progression, the game has a gripping detective adventure story in store, which twists and turns at every corner.
Visually the game drop dead gorgeous. The limitations of pixel graphics are transformed into quite the opposite: Here we have screen after screen where every spot of colour is deliberately chosen, from the gentle blue glow of technology, the pulsing orange of expanding neural network to the concrete brutalism of an abandoned robot factory.
The voice acting is - as is now the norm for Wadjet Eye Productions - stellar. The actors seem to have an excellent read on their characters, which gives the game world an additional layer of credibility.
I could talk ad nauseam about the story, but I feel that anything I could say here would detract from first plunge into the game. All I will say is that here is a staggeringly diverse cast of characters, perfectly integrated so that it feels completely natural. See if you can figure out where on earth the game actually takes place and you will know what I am talking about.

Despite being developed by an independent (initially one-man, later slightly extended) studio, Technobabylon shares a lot with other games published by Wadjet Eye Games. The low-res, but very tastefully done visuals go a long way establishing the atmosphere for the futuristic, can't-quite-decide-how-dystopian story. The writing is great, the characters are interesting, and the eventual story is quite compelling, although a lot remains shrouded quite close to the end. Special commendations must go to the excellent soundtrack, and another strength of Technobabylon's are its puzzles, which are refreshingly unique at places, often make you work hard but to achieve some difficult ends, and they distinctly lack the oh-so-often-seen trap of adventure game puzzles where the game makes you work for 30 mins to open a cupboard - which then hides a 2 dollar screwdriver.
So if everything's so great, then what is the big issue? I did say the puzzles are great, but the way the game presents them are often not. In general, it took a little getting used to how the game expects you to click everything both left and right, including your inventory. Then, given the difficulty of some of the puzzles, there could have been more hints / clues, because at some times, the game acts very poker-faced. And finally, and most intriguingly, there are situations where the game carefully guides you towards a solution - which in the end isn't feasible. This last thing was played a couple of times early game, and nearly made me abandon Tecnobabylon in Chapter 100 (which is in binary, so #4). Luckily, I persisted.

All in all, Technobabylon is a brillant adventure game and a memorable experience. And its one weird quirk described above makes it even more unique :)",1681591598,1681626269,True,4,0,0.570330202579498291,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Technobabylon is cyberpunk adventure game that is 'almost' a detective thriller. I say 'almost' because there are three playable characters in the game but only two of them are detectives. The game takes place in the year of 2087 in the fictional locale of Newton City which is governed and partially policed by an experimental AI known simply as Central. The primary character of the playable trio is Dr. Charles Regis, a former bio engineer turned detective working for the city's police organization, CEL.  He is joined by fellow detective and networking specialist, Dr. Max Lao, and together they must hunt down a dangerous serial killer known only as the Mindjacker for his tendency to rip the information out of the heads of his victims and overloading their brains. Unrelated to the other two for most of the game is Latha Sesame, our third playable character and a destitute internet-addict living in government housing. Her part of the adventure has to do with being hunted down by a criminal organization with nebulous goals.

One thing I have to say right off the bat is that this game is really well-written. The big twist in this game is something that would be extremely obvious in any other game, but the story does a good enough job aiming your attention elsewhere and not giving you more obvious clues until later on in the game, almost until right before the reveal. Similarly, the characters are also quite good. Regis makes for a good protagonist as a cynical older man  with a troubled, bitter past, and Lao as a younger, more level-headed, and more technologically-inclined woman acts as a great foil for him even if there's not much personally going on with her. Despite being separated from the duo for most of the game, Latha is a pretty great character in her own right, being a younger person who is part of a younger generation that has a greater understanding of the VR-inclined internet generation of the future. Typically characters like that are written by older folk with an air of derision, but this game handles the younger generation better than most. Most of the people you meet on the internet are not written entirely as jokes but people running away from their problems or hyper-obsessed with one particular topic or hobby, and the community that comes with it, which is kind of how it can be in real life. Latha herself can come off a little hip at times but her dialogue never takes away from the seriousness of her situation and most of the time her attitude is more relaxed and inquisitive.

I really like the world in this game. Cause it's technically cyberpunk but it's not so far in the future to feel like a complete displacement. After all, it's only 60 years into the future and stuff like limited corporate AI running our machines, 3D printers for food, and cargo transported by airship aren't exactly completely out of left field. Regis, as a man who looks to be in his forties, being somewhat awkward around gay and trans characters also makes it clear that old ideas and prejudices haven't died off completely even if the world has made a lot of progress. The most far out concepts are probably neurologically linking your brain to the internet and robots who are able to completely mimic humans, but even those feel as if advancements made in science and robotics that would make these creations possible are right around the corner these days and the technology isn't portrayed as being necessarily perfect in game.

The game design was refreshingly good as well. The game is very segmented, being split into a number of chapters, each with its own self-contained puzzles. Thankfully the majority of these puzzles are designed well right up until near the end of the game when a couple of them felt rushed and unclear. The majority were designed to actually give you the information needed to solve them instead of just trying everything on everything as usual.

The only couple complaints I would have are the aformentioned rushed puzzles towards the end, specifically the cargo puzzle, which was extremely unclear about how to do it, and the final puzzle with the wrench which doesn't have any hints that I could see and is not something that is obvious to think to do. I feel like it was just a bit unnecessary obfuscation right at the end. The VO, while fairly good for the most part, as felt a little flat and awkward for much of the game. It never got in the way of the story's emotional moments and the budget and manpower this game was developed on make it perfectly understandable.

I really enjoyed Technobabylon. It was a great adventure game that did a good job of balancing having a serious and narratively satisfying story with joking around and having fun with itself. It was also set in the future, but never forgot it as tends to happen, introducing new science fiction concepts and extrapolating on them often without ever taking away from our characters' personal stories. Between this and Primordia, Wadjet Eye are looking to be my favorite new adventure game developers.

Technobabylon is a fantastic tale, though its gameplay mechanics are a little clunky. 

[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]

Brooding, thought provoking, and, at times, dark. Technobabylon (Henceforth TB) is everything you could want from a morally grey, dense story. Set in the distant future, TB is a point and click adventure that follows a small ensemble of characters as they find themselves caught up in a story much larger than themselves, as stakes grow and right and wrong begin to blur. 

Being the story lover that I am, TB really scratched that itch. The gamer in me, however was often frustrated, and I even had to resort to a walkthrough on several occasions, often discovering I needed to do something that wasn’t telegraphed well at all.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
[list][*] The story is extremely well written, tight, and interesting. I didn’t find it predictable while playing, but it was very obvious in hindsight, which is something I appreciate. There was, however, a gaping plot-hole that I will address in the con’s. 
[*] The world building, atmosphere, and lore is lovingly sprinkled throughout, giving a vibrant feel to the game that gives the story a depth and setting that makes it extremely engrossing. 
[*] There is a variety of solutions for many puzzles. While linear and not affecting the outcome of events, beyond achievements, it was nice to see multiple solutions to many puzzles, as well as the minor, but very different, responses you can get from doing things in a different way. 
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list][*] The game is [i]terrible[/i] at both teaching you how to play, and telegraphing what has changed. For example, I needed to resort to a walkthrough [i]in the tutorial[/i] because it never occurred to me to try and download attachments. I also had multiple points where I didn’t know what I was meant to be doing, and sort of wandered about aimlessly, hoping the plot would progress or I’d work out what I needed to do next by finding things I could interact with. 
[*] The game has a massive plot hole. I spent almost 2 hours trying to beat a stupid minigame (and ended up resorting to spamming mouse clicks as quickly as possible and hoping) because I didn’t think of any other solutions, and the game hadn’t told me that things had changed, I therefore did not discover a new npc needed to progress the game in the way you’re meant to (by cheating at the minigame, because HOLY FUCK ITS HARD.) and therefore did not buy a specific item from him used to cheat… But in the next scene with the character, the game assumed I had cheated, and had altered my inventory accordingly.  
[*] The game has quite a few QoL issues. No pause means when I needed to do stuff for the kids, I missed out on dialogue, the menu isn’t great, with no aspect alterations, and the game needs a double click move to next screen.  
[/list]

[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]
 [list][*] Solve QoL issues.
[*] I’d like to see the dialogue choices throughout have an impact on the ending, more than it did. 
[*] A god damn sequel, please.
[/list]


[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]

TB is a good point and click. It’s almost a rare “worth it at full price” game, but its slightly more expensive than I’d be willing to recommend it at. Even 10% off would make it viable. My only real complaint regarding the game as a whole is I don’t see the reference to Babylon, historically, or mythologically. No tower of babel, no men becoming gods, and I don’t see any relation to the mythos of the Babylonians either. 
TB is for dense sci-fi story lovers (which I am), it is for point and click enjoyers (though I say that hesitantly, the pnc mechanics are not tight), and it is for people who enjoy a morally ambiguous story. 

TB is NOT for newcomers to sci-fi, as it contains huge volumes of technobabble, it is not for people who want tight mechanics, and is categorically not for people who skip the dialogue… given that a good 5 hours of the 8 it took to play through the first time were solid dialogue reading and listening. 

Overall, I think this is a healthy addition to a games library.

However, there are 2 big negatives I think might cause players to be dismayed: the story and a few very hard puzzles.

On the positive side, the characters and voice acting are great. Lots of dialogue that helps with the world building and character backgrounds. Most puzzles make logical sense once you understand the futuristic environment. The graphics are bad even for pixelated standards, but luckily it doesn’t affect the gameplay.

Now the problems: 1.) This is a classic point and click game with no new mechanics. That being the case, the storyline is going to be a big motivator to progress. Unfortunately, the story has HUGE plot holes. We’re talking Kaiju-sized, gaping wide plot holes. It’s approached from 3 different perspectives, and I thought by the end they would come together to a resolution. It did not. In fact, I would say most of the story makes no sense at all, and that left me so unsatisfied that I have no desire to replay it.

2.) There are a couple of “impossible” puzzles, at the very beginning and very end of the game. There is 0% chance I would have finished the game without looking up a guide. Maybe I’m just dumb, so it might not be a problem for you.

After giving it a second go with the commentary in 2021, I change my mind as you can see. 

I think the main issue I had connecting with this game the first time around was there was a disconnect between me and the advanced sci-fi language which I wasn't used to at the time, being a learning curve to get used to figuring out what characters are explaining as well as understanding what to do to solve some puzzles. It didn't help that I wasn't much of a sci-fi wizard back then, well that's not much of an issue now as I became more familiar with the terminology. 

For others who aren't used to this type of genre, I consider you lot to not start this one yet before playing Whispers of Machine produced by the same company. It's more friendly with the sci-fi language making it easier to understand the plot without getting too lost. 

Other than that, Technobabylon is what you would want in a point-and-click adventure game, complex puzzles with a creative solution, beautiful realistic character portraits, and good convincing voice acting. And finally, as always the soundtrack is a banger as it has subtle mystery, technical jiggle beat to it that set the mood of the environment. 

Oh, and before I forget, not only is this game lore-heavy but also takes the sci-fi establishment to a whole level. Presenting a lot of interesting ideas, like terrorists implanting bombs in their bones undetectable, or someone giving themselves a temporary aphasia symptom because it's hip and retros funny enough. Quirky in that regard, and there are a whole lot of questions you may come out thinking about after finishing this game, like the morality of virtual reality (trance) vs reality, worldwide security supervision, AI, etc. Definitely worth the experience to explore if you're into these types of debates and theory crafting.",1670625447,1682368006,True,13,1,0.642663657665252686,0,True,False,False,True,,,

You play as 3 characters, veteran cop Charlie Regis, his partner Max Lao, and Latha Sesame, a young woman addicted to Trance (basically this world's version of VR) but strangely more proficient in that field compared to most people. They find themselves entangled in a conspiracy involving the Mindjacker, a man stealing the minds of genius people. 

I played many P&C games, and honestly this one is the best so far. I love the cyberpunk setting, the mystery conspiracy story, the levels, characters, and soundtrack. Combine them all, it creates one amazing cyberpunk experience. I like how you can talk with characters, or read the news, for more background lore of the world. Be sure to try to talk to characters every chance you get for a bit more info. As expected, the voice acting is really good as well, with many familiar names and voices in the cast if you play these type of games.

The gameplay is the usual, gathering info and using items to solve puzzles. Some of these can be not kinda obvious, like you have to find the interactable spot, with no highlights. But an interesting thing is that several of these puzzles can be solved using alternate solutions, as you can see if you look up an achievement guide. Whether its a dialogue choice, using items, or whatever, these alternate methods can add some variation to the usually linear, fixed-solution nature of these games. Be sure to try them, especially if you're achievement-hunting.

Length-wise, its also a bit longer than your usual P&C game, but it's a good thing since sometimes, maybe almost all the time, I wished these games were longer. The only flaw of Technobabylon, for me, is that you cannot pause. The usual menu is always on the top left of the screen, but you cannot pause properly. Not really a big deal since there is no time-sensitive events, save for one minigame, but its annoying if you have to go in the middle of a dialogue scene, or when you open the Steam Overlay, as clicks you made in the web page still moves your character in-game.

But aside from that one flaw, Technobabylon is an almost perfect, point-and-click game with a thrilling story, cyberpunk setting, and memorable characters. Definitely give it a try if you're a fan of the P&C genre, be it the ones from Wadjet Eye, others done in similar style like Clifftop Games, or even different ones entirely.

- I've done 8 out of 10 chapters of the game, and frankly speaking, I wanted to finish the game before judging it. But it doesn't please me to do so. On the other hand, you could say I've seen a fair bit of the game to be able to publish an opinion about it.
- When to choose about good or bad about the game, I thought: would I recommand it, and would I recommand it to the point people do? Because there is no ""neutral"" option on Steam, sadly. I came to the conclusion I wouldn't, partly because I didn't enjoyed it that much AND because it was clearly not as positive as others review. But it was clearly not a bad experience.

Now about the pro:
- The art is cool, the ambiance, the music, thoses parts are really well made, nothing to say about that.
- The puzzle are USUALLY well made, maybe a little too easy in my humble opinion, but in that genre I would say it's more a positive point, because it's not USUALLY illogical as some others game. Also, to have from time to time multiple way to solve a problem is cool.
- As a DM of Shadowrun & CyberPunk 2022 (no, not RED or 2077, you young lass, I'm talking about the 1990 tabletop RPG), I can say the cyberpunk dystopia is overall 'well done', there is nothing new under the sun here, a few cool ideas, but don't expect something really innovative on that field either.
- The possibility to have the commentary of the devs during the different scene is really something I found cool.

Cons:
- The characters: you know, there is some games where the characters are so plain you can't identify to them, right? Well, this game go for the total opposite. There is basically 3 playable characters over the game and they are so specific that I can't identify nor feel sympathy for any of them... Except maybe Max Lao... That I've played for 1 chapter only out of 8... And said chapter was mostly about another character than her... Yeah.
Charles is a poor excuse of a cops tormented by his past and who can't let go of something that happened 20 years ago to the point he get BLACKMAILED about it and comply...
And Latha is... urg... yeah, no. I prefer not to talk about Latha. Sorry.
The characters would, to me, make for really good NPCs, but they will totally do a hit or miss on players. And for me it was a utterly total miss.
- Remember when I said most puzzle where well made? Yeah. Most. The ones who aren't are either ""Hey, I hope you clicked that precise pixel to get this indispensable item to continue"" or fall in the level of esoteric magic knowledge. I'm looking at you, Elysium tower, with your 2 pixels hanger, and your FUCKING PASSWORD to find. If you wonder to why I'm fucking pissed of by a password, imagine you're in a game, you have a password to enter, and the game show you a visual numpad you can CLICK in game. You're good? Well, that numpad don't work (and is of no use, it's just here to misguide you), and the password is made of LETTERS not NUMBERS. Yeah, you had to use your keyboard to enter keys that aren't proposed by the visual in-game without ANY hint you'd have to do that.
Oh, and if you're doing the game and remember this post, the password is [spoiler]PARIS[/spoiler].
As for Latha, her puzzles are usually easily resolved if you remember to use your wetware on everything you'll see.
- I'd say it as a cons, because for me it's one but... this game doesn't take a pecularly critic point on the world, which I would expect from a cyberpunk game. Plus there is nothing that would make me go ""wow, that's something I didn't expect"". So yeah, the game is overall good, but it doesn't make me want to know more of it, in one way or another. It's like a really good looking steak, but kinda bland.

I started and finished this over a weekend, as I found myself pausing (for the sake of real-world living) - but then restarting the story over and over until I reached an end. 
Though this pixel-game is (severely) pixelated and most of the time you'll listen to text while you read it, it felt immersive, due to the plot and the characters. 
This game does have some recognisable cyberpunk genre elements, like darkness and shabbiness, ethical question marks, and hightech, but also feels rather retro in ""tone"", and this not only due to the pixels or the game's age.
There was only one thing I didn't like, which is, when you start the game, you can chose ""start"" or ""restore"", and because I expected a ""load"" button (instead of ""restore""), I ""started"" the game by mistake too often. Conventional naming of buttons for users before they start a game? I'm in favour.
Other than that, the complex story was nice, and I although I know these games, I occasionally did need a walkthrough guide to solve a few things that I really didn't see on screen.

Classic pixel art point-and-click, but the puzzles aren't so ridiculous that you end up just randomly using everything on everything to get ahead. Instead, you can usually come up with a logical path of what to do next. Still, I wouldn't say this is an ""easy"" game. For me, it felt just right, but I had to look up the spoiler-free tips in the ""guides"" section of steam a handful of times. 

The story is intriguing and it tackles interesting aspects of a cyberpunk future without feeling stale. Voice acting was also done well, although I didn't like the male protagonist very much. He does grow on you over time, but even in the end, I was not really rooting for him. He tries to pull of the grumpy-but-likeable routine but often falls flat into self-absorbed-stick-in-the-mud territory. The other two main protagonists were fine, though.

One other thing that struck me is that different elements have different pixel resolutions. In the old games, everything was the same resolution, but in this, if the figures are standing further away, they are just scaled down and have finer pixels. Might be nitpicking, but it constantly reminded me of the artificial pixelation that is happening throughout the game. It makes some elements stick out so that the whole scene doesn't gel as one, but sometimes feels like a collage of random images collected from different sources.

And there is a scene where Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is very prominently featured, and you can't turn it down even if you set the music volume to 0. I like this piece of music, but having it start over every time you change rooms becomes annoying. There is another scene at a biolab where you have a relatively relaxed conversation with a scientist, but the music in the background is quite hectic and loud.

The initial character is quaint, but you're in this scenario that screams ""tutorial puzzle"". The goal is to unlock a door.

Then the action changes to other two people. The puzzle in this screen is the elevator door is locked. You unlock it and enter an office where -surprise- you have to unlock a door. *sigh* Your game doesn't need the same puzzle in every screen.

Then you get an anonymous call threatening your frozen embryos you made with your dead wife, whom you've learned everything about just a second before because your partner popped up and asked you about her. This is so clumsy. Again all you can think of is ""right, the game is telling me this man had a wife who died and they made embryos, which are now being used for blackmail"". There's no involvement at all. When is this 50-odd years old widower planning to have those children anyway?

I advanced a couple more screens (and another locked door), till I had to fish a gun out of a jacuzzi using the convenient fishing rod I found on a shelf in the bedroom. Because of course there's a fishing rod in the bedroom. At this point I said ""yeah ok, I'm not feeling it"".",1656377380,1657534423,False,1,1,0.454142332077026367,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Besides that, the presentation is good enough to prevent pixel hunting and most puzzles are straightforward, so Technobabylon manages to avoid some of the most common shortcomings of point n' click adventure games. Some puzzles even have alternative solutions so that's neat.
What I didn't enjoy about the game is how depressing it can get. I guess that's an inevitable part of the experience since it's a cyberpunk setting, but it's just demoralizing how almost every character in the game is some sort of degenerate.

As the most prolific publisher of old school pixelated adventures, Wadjet Eye became kind of a digital place of recluse for me. Where I'm guaranteed to relive good ol' past times and chill with some light cerebral point & click puzzles. Not sure exactly what is it about the pixels that does it for me. Reckon the blanks get filled by my brain better than hyper realism is able to. Anyway WEG did good to assist a highly skilled solo developer in enriching his gem as only it knows how because it turned out just as I hoped although the journey was not without trials and tribulations.

Story unfolds in city of Newton somewhere in Horn of Africa few decades into the future. If it weren't said one would think it's in the US. This world is highly globalized, technologically developed (duh), and in geo-political turmoil. Wars have been fought, cities destroyed (nuked), old alliances crumbled while new formed. Somehow our planet is still livable and thriving even, given numerous scientific breakthroughs. Only our morals had not the time to improve so the wealth is still distributed in all too familiar way. Surprisingly world is not dystopian as I've seen it described, at least not when compared to our present day. All of this is subtly revealed via optional news bulletins, e-mails, conversations, secondary or tertiary puzzle solutions. Pretty smart, cost-effective and believable way of doing it. Newton is also the first city to be completely governed by new experimental hybrid organic/silicon AI which of course becomes a major plot actor.

As with other WEG works, TB is a sight for sore eyes, with polished well developed aesthetic, audio and UI. Special mention goes to phenomenal voice acting which has to be the most abundant in any adventure game. Main character (Regis) is a joy to listen and reminds me of Robert Patrick from The Dig if anyone remembers. Not only everyone is great but quantity of it is absolutely baffling, oh my yes. Little was spared in leaving questions players may have go unanswered. Over half of the size of the game is speech and good chunk of it is developer commentary bonus which I recommend turning ON if you can spare a 2nd playthrough. It offers valuable lessons in game design among other interesting bits and great examples of executive meddling with which I all agreed with.
Highly detailed closeup character dialogues profiles also stood out in portraying personalities. Most have several emotional states (normal, happy, sad, surprised, angry) and it meshes pretty well with spoken lines. Impressive were the scenes with younger past versions of old characters where both the profiles and voices were remarkably faithfully de-aged. Certainly better than in The 'big kahuna' Irishman, lol. Huge props to Ivan.

Gameplay largely revolves around detective work and is roughly equally split between conversations and classic clickaroo. Goal quickly becomes solving a murder case which becomes more complicated as bodies start pilling up. Over the course you'll be controlling 3 different characters and not everything will have a chronological flow. There are 10 thematic chapters (aptly denoted in binary) that take an hour or two to solve on average.
I also very much fancied several moral choices sprinkled throughout. They don't carry much plot weight besides occasional reference later on but it only made them resonate more. Probably due to absence of familiar penalties or rewards to rely on, only your conscience as consultant and ever-present judge.
Puzzles are reasonably logical, not to hard not too easy, contrary to complaints I've seen. No trial & error click-fests either. Once an object fulfilled its purpose it is deleted from inventory so there's no clutter.

In contrast, presentation and pacing of the story as well as engagement with most characters is kind of messy (as it would be at the beginning of a very good book) but it pays off by the end, providing you have the patience and are good at adapting at new jargon. Conclusion is one of those rare fully satisfactory ones where every loose end gets properly tied.

Technically game is near flawless but to remove unfortunate mouse acceleration a [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Technobabylon#Mouse_acceleration]visit to PCGW[/url] is recommended.
In full-screen system cursor bleeds in from pillar-boxed edges while the game comically tries to push it back in.
Savegame management is tiresome if you are an orderly fellow. Renaming existing saves is not possible unless you delete and re-save under a new name (in effort to preserve file naming increment within folder). Separate ""New Save"" option should have become a norm long ago and clicking existing saves should allow saving under a different in-game name (overwriting the same file).
Of course expecting perfection is ungrateful but it's interesting to see how modern AGS (Adventure Game Studio) gets personally tweaked from developer to developer for their distinct design and purpose. Early AGS games had but a simple UI variation of old Sierra adventures for example so we've come a long way.

With my nitpicking out of the way here are some gameplay issues that bothered me:
Starting puzzle already comes with a steep learning curve by poorly introducing a novel concept and unfamiliar slang, with little guide besides basic UI usage. Thought maybe there was a manual I missed. Didn't help the starting character came off as highly dislikable metaverse zealot at first.
What did help were small chapters consisting of 1 to 4 rooms. Eased managing puzzles by not overloading the player with possibilities but consequently made the world feel smaller and bit sterile even. Then the final counterweight to claustrophobia is richness and quality of dialogues as evident by complete absence of shallow black/white personalities in the entire game.

Increasing complexity of the case mixed with future jargon made it hard to follow. If you somehow pull that off it may become hard to maintain long-term attention because of warm/cold nature of tension building where most interesting bit ends along with the chapter, followed by starting over from scratch immediately after and in another character shoes.
It became difficult to return after starting a new chapter because I simply lost interest. WEG or not, I kept losing faith something good will come out of it. Longest break was 5 days at the start of Chapter 5 (Germination) and I'm certain I'd give up if game wasn't on Steam and I wasn't a completionist. Once I forced myself back it took 10 or so minutes before I was captivated again though.

Dialogue choices are often presented without logical order that would naturally expand information. There would be a non-related inquiry between two related topics or the follow up line would appear at random place on the list. Most topics being forever erased only to exist in player's memory also contributed to confusion overload.

Immediate ways to proceed and character motivations when the chapter starts are not always clear. You may find yourself fumbling about until a clue is given or found and even solve a puzzle or two in advance without having an understanding toward what goal you are working to.

* * *

With the power of hindsight I can say that with enough patience it will eventually deliver you to the promise land. After all it started as one-man freeware project before WEG took it under its wing so any leftover rough edges were only noticed because I'm a dinosaur gamer. In the end I'm happy to have stuck around since it all ties together in last two chapters far better than I could have anticipated.

Uzun süre önce The Time Machine adında bir kitap okumuştum. O kitap da, Victoria döneminde yaşayan bir bilim insanının icat ettiği zaman makinesine binerek kendini bir anda 800000 yılların da bulmasını ve orada gördüklerini ve yaşadıklarını anlatıyordu. The Time Machine konu olarak oldukça ilgi çekici bir romandı, ancak benim için onu ilginç kılan diğer bir özelliği ise yazarın zaman yolculuğu aracılığıyla geleceğe dair yaptığı tahminler.


Bu tahminler onun gelecek algısını, gelecekte dünyayı ve insanları bekleyen sona yönelik öngörülerini içeriyordu. Kitap da anlatılan öngörüler, o zamanlar beni oldukça şaşırtmıştı. Bu öngörülerde medeniyetlerin sürekli bilim, sanayi ve teknoloji alanında ilerlerken aynı zamanda yavaş yavaş mutluluğu yitireceklerinden, kapitalist düzenin insanları daha sert sınıflara böleceğinden ve sınıflar arası farkın giderek açılacağından, rekabetin ve mutlak ilerlemenin medeniyetin sonunu getiren unsurlar olacağından bahsediyordu.


Kitap o kadar ufkumuzu açacak türden bir kitapdı ki, insan ister istemez kendi içinde sorgulamalar yapmaya başlıyordu. Gerçekten tüm bu hızlı gidişat ile aydınlanıyor muyuz yoksa daha karanlık bir zamana doğru mu gidiyoruz ! Gelişiyor muyuz yoksa uygarlıkla birlikte zehirleniyor muyuz !  Acaba yazar haklı mı ?  Böyle şeyler mi olacak gelecekte ?  Bilim kurgu eserlerinin en sevdiğim yanı bu olmuştur zaten. Farklı metaforlarla üstü kapalı mükemmel toplum eleştirisi yaparlar ve hayal gücünüzü inanılmaz zorlarlar.


Technobabylon tıpkı The Time Machine kitabı gibi gelecek tasviri yapan bir oyun. Ama bu sefer yüz binlerce yıl ileriye değil çok daha yakın bir tarihe 2087 ye gidiyoruz. Oyunu oynarken ilk fark edeceğiniz şey,  Oyunun yapan kişilerin çok ayrıntılı ve gerçekçi bir gelecek dünyası inşa etmeleri, yani ortaya koydukları kavramlar ve olgular sadece farazi ya da fantezi unsurları olmaktan ziyade hepsi oldukça inandırıcı ve olma olasılığı yüksek öngörüler.


Bu da açıkça gösteriyor ki, bu oyunu yapan adamlar sadece bilimi seven ve merak duyan insanlar değil, gerçekten bilimi bilen ve anlayan insanlardan tarafından yapıldığı. Bilim konularına aşına iseniz ve bilginiz varsa bu oyunu ayrı bir seveceksiniz, eğer yoksa bilimsel içerikler ve konuşmalar biraz bunaltıcı gelebilir.


Dediğim gibi yıl 2087 teknoloji almış başını yürümüş. Hologramlar, robotlar, şehirleri bile yöneten gelişmiş yapay zeka,  genetik mühendisliği ve İnternetin geleceği Trance, ( yani her şeyin mümkün olduğu bir sanal gerçeklik dünyası ), ama tüm bunlara rağmen dünya iyi bir yer olmaktan çok uzakta. Bir tarafta mega zenginler, diğer tarafta ultra fakirlerden oluşan bölünmüş bir toplum. Yolsuzluk, fiziksel ve ahlaki bozulma, eşcinsellik ve cinsiyet değiştirme herkes tarafından kabul görmüş normal bir durum Technobabylon dünyasında....Bu arada en yakın çalışma arkadaşınızın bir zamanlar erkek olduğunu öğrenmeniz hiç şaşılası bir durum değil buralarda...Hanı olur ya, niyeti bozar aklınızdan bir şeyler geçerse diye, uyarmak istedim.


Oyunu oynamayı düşünenler için bir kaç tavsiyede bulunmak istiyorum.Oyunda ziyaret ettiğiniz her alan oyunun geçtiği şehir olan Newton hakkında size bilgiler veriyor. Çevredeki hemen hemen her şeye tıklayarak bu bilgilere ulaşabilirsiniz. Karakterlerle yaptığınız konuşmalarda bütün konuşma seçeneklerini kullanarak bu dünya hakkında daha fazla bilgi sahibi olabilirsiniz. Ama baştan söyleyeyim bu yaptığınız konuşmalar, eğer muhabbeti uzatırsanız 10, 15 dakikayı bulabiliyor. 


Bir de belli aralıklarla telefonunuza düşen haber bültenleri var. Bu haberlerde politik, kültürel bilgilerin yanı sıra büyük şirketler ve güç odakları hakkında da detaylı bilgi sahibi olabilirsiniz. Bu dünya ilgili ne kadar çok şey öğrenirseniz oyundan alacağınız keyif de kat ve kat artacaktır. Bu yüzden hiç bir detayı atlamamak önemli. Diğer şey ise oyundaki bulmacaları yardım almadan kendiniz çözmeniz. Yalan yok, yer yer zorlanabilirsiniz ama yılmayın.  Sizden istenilen şeyi, elde edeceğiniz bilgilerle doğru ilişkilendirerek bunları çözebilirsiniz. Yapmış olduğunuz bu beyin fırtınası ve ardından gelen başarı ile inanılmaz bir tatmin yaşayabilirsiniz.


Oyunun oynama süresi de oldukça tatminkar, ama tabi ki de oynayan kişiye göre değişebilir. Eğer yukarıda söylemiş olduğun tavsiyeler doğrultusunda oynarsanız 30 saati devirirsiniz. Ama yok, uzun muhabbetler beni sıkar, çevredeki detaylar, bilgiler benim için önemli değil, bulmacaları da çözmekle uğraşamam derseniz 10 saat gibi bir sürede rahatlıkla bitirirsiniz oyunu. He o zamanda bu oyunun oynamanın bir anlamı olur mu ? Size bir şeyler katar ve hissettirir mi ? Hiç sanmıyorum. Sadece oyna'mış' gibi yaparsınız.


Oyun için eksi diyebileceğim tek bir yönü var. İyi bir ingilizce gerektiriyor. Aslında iyiden kastım, geniş bir ingilizce kelime ve deyim bilgisi istiyor. Günlük ingilizce de pek kullanılmayan  heuristic, chromatograph, aphasia, angiosperm, germination, euphemistic, botulism, extrapolate gibi  bilimsel ve tıbbi kelimeler içermesi. Anlayacağınız bazen sözlük karıştırmanız gerekebiliyor. Bu benim açımdan pek sorun değil aksine yukarıda saydığım  kelimeleri öğrenmemde faydası olduğu için olumlu bir şey. 


Allahım yeni çenem düştü ve yine uzun bir yazı oldu. Son cümle olarak şunu söyleyip bitiriyorum. Technobabylon, Wadjet Eye Games diğer oyunları gibi point-and-click adventure oyunu. Bu türe ilginiz varsa, hani derler ya taş gibi hatun diye... Alın size türünün en iyi  örneklerinden biri olan taş gibi bir adventure oyunu... Sizde, benle aynı hataya düşüp bu oyunu oynamak için fazla vakit kaybetmeyin derim.

To me it seems to have a lot of inspiration or similar elements from things like 'The Matrix', 'Ready Player One', 'Minority Report' and VR/AR in general.  It's a Cyberpunk dystopian future setting which isn't a genre I really like, but it has a good enough story that's well written and I found it interesting enough to keep playing through.  The gameplay and even parts of the story remind me a lot of their other game 'Gemini Rue'.  They have a very similar vibe at times.  The alternating main character and eventual switching between characters is also a very similar design.

This game was longer and more complex than I had expected and it does have some of the pitfalls that some people hate in a point & click.  First off there is a fair share of pixel hunting.  While many modern point and click games utilize a hotspot option (usually one you can turn on and off or access by pressing something like spacebar), but this one unfortunately does not.  This leads to quite a bit of pixel hunting in the game to try and find all interactive spots.  Another one that many people may dislike is that some of the puzzles do not have enough clues to figure out or aren't intuitive to solve.  There's a lot of utilizing a communication device (traveler or wetware) in the game in addition to utilizing inventory items and dialogue to progress.  I don't know if I'd say the puzzles involved the dreaded ""Moon Logic"" of some 90's games, but there are definitely some parts that will either require a walkthrough or at least patience with exhausting every dialogue option as well trying everything in your inventory on every other item and hotspot.  This can be frustrating, but it can be worked through with a little patience.

This game does have Trans and Homosexual (possibly Bi-sexual) characters in it.  If you don't like that in your games I would say the amount of representation in the game is minimal and for those who do want and enjoy it, it's small but probably meaningful for them.  While in someways this game has a lot positive representations showing several Black and Asian characters as high powered and successful, or for example by actually making the setting of the game someplace in the Horn of Africa and showing Texas, USA as a warlord driven  backwards place.  However, for every positive representation there are also some that feel a little offensive.   For example, the Chinese character Ran Shou Man who embodies many negative stereotypes about Asians.  The character Jinsil is someones avatar but they choose to use a covered woman who uses Arabic words and belongs to a group called Jahiliyah (the term used for the pre-Islamic era in Arabic meaning ignorance).  Her character appears to be for all intents and purposes another portrayal of a Muslim Terrorist of sorts.  The character is a cover for someone who isn't Arab or Muslim but the representation still comes across as portraying that stereotype.  I'm a little torn since I really enjoyed hearing and seeing some Arabic/Arab/Muslim representation at all, but I didn't like the implications and stereotypes it played on.

There are 40 achievements in this game which is a decent amount.  The achievements also cover a nice array of story unlocked to specific action unlocked.  This game often gives you choices how to handle a situation and there can be 2-3 choices.  16 of the achievements are choice based from 7 different scenarios so the maximum you can collect of those on a single playthrough without using strategic saving methods would be 7 but you will unlock one of the option no matter what as they are part of the story progression.  10 of these are story progression unlocked by completing a chapter so 17 total are guaranteed if you finish the game.  I unlocked 26 through natural gameplay without a walkthrough.  Most are easy to pick up, but I did need to refer to a guide for 2 of them.  A single playthrough probably averages 10-12 hours.  My first time was around 12 my second time I was trying to pick up missed achievements.  I used strategic saves and still explored thoroughly and depleted all dialogue options.  That came close to 8 hours.  If you skip through all the dialogues you could probably complete it much quicker.  Though there are different approaches to problems and different dialogue choices available nothing really changes in the story other than a few minor details in the characters dialogues.  It's really more the illusion of choice but some choices will have a slightly different cut scene afterwards like how you deal with the bomber at the train.  Everything else proceeds the same.

Overall, if you like Point & Clicks you'll probably enjoy this game.  If you are easily frustrated by pixel hunting or puzzles... probably best to avoid.  If you enjoyed other Wadjet Eye games like Gemini Rue, you'll probably enjoy this as well.",1652945016,1652945034,True,11,0,0.647680997848510742,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My favorite Wadjet-Eye published adventure game. The artwork is gorgeous, the writing is good and the story well-constructed.

In Technobabylon, you get to control three characters whose stories are intertwined: the police officers Regis and Lao, and trance-addicted bum Latha. The game's plot it kicked off when Regis is blackmailed into bombing Latha's apartment building. He only went along with the blackmailer because he thought the building was empty. Latha thinks the police wants her dead. And so you control Regis, his partner Lao, and the fugitive Latha in alternating chapters, trying to find out what's going on.

It's a well-told story with many plot threads that slowly unravel as you uncover more and more info with each chapter. There are plenty of interesting and beautifully illustrated locations in the game, both real and virtual: the Trance is the futuristic cyberpunk replacement of the internet, which you can enter through a wetware interface implanted in your brain. It's like descending into a shared dreamworld, and a lot of people are addicted to it, letting their bodies wither away while their minds roam the Trance. Very cool concept.

Puzzles are decently challenging but not too hard. Most of them are logical, and several allow for alternate solutions. An early puzzle that requires you to unlock a door has three different solutions, for example. It's very cool to see this in an adventure game because it adds a bit of replayability and makes you less likely to get stuck.

All in all, the mix of amazing visuals, interesting cyberpunk story, compelling characters and decent puzzles makes this my favorite of the Wadjet Eye adventure games. Highly recommended to any point & click fan.",1648314524,1651779603,True,5,0,0.558211803436279297,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The world building in particular was superb -- I read many of the ""news stories"" in the game which are there (mostly) just for atmosphere, and this world feels well-realized, full of things which are wonderful and scary at the same time.

Ben Chandler's art is fantastic as always, the dialogue and interactions are extremely funny but also well written and interesting.  The voice acting set a new high watermark for Wadjet Eye and the characters, even minor ones, were always interesting and fun, with one notable exception.

I find the Mandala character to be underdevoloped, not particularly intesting and unfortunately probably the least well acted of all the characters in the game.  Not that she was really that bad (character or actor) but just compared to Regis and Lao (and their actors) she fell flat for me.

Die junge Arbeitslose Latha Sesame hingegen nutzt die Grundversorgung durch ""Central"", um sich meist in einer Virtual Reality namens ""Trance"" aufzuhalten. Das findet ein plötzliches Ende, als ihr Zimmer in die Luft fliegt. Charlie Regis und sein Partner Max Lao sind unterdessen dabei, einen ""Mindjacker"" zu verfolgen, jemanden, der die Geistesinhalte Anderer stiehlt. Diese beiden Erzählstränge wachsen zu einer Story über eine Verschwörung zusammen. Und noch ein bisschen mehr.

This gives the game a really good flow, that kept me engaged in the story and what was going on. There was very little running around in an area that is too large, and losing track of what is going on. The only thing I wished for, was to follow each character for a bit longer at the time.

As someone who loves both cyberpunk and has played point and click adventures for 30+ years, this is an easy recommandation. I would like to say that the sum is greater than the parts, but that would be a bit harsh. Because this is a really good package, made by people who obviously have put a lot of tought and effort into all aspects of the game. They have taken some of the best aspects of the genere, and even made some of the worst aspects of the genere work in this game (I'm looking at you Sierra) without them being too punishing or feel like padding.

The sci-fi dystopian setting often feels like the fever-dream of Progressive activists from present day NYC, with one of the MCs being a hard-done-by orphan refugee immigrant and another being a trans individual who has transitioned PERFECTLY and SEAMLESSLY; one case focuses on the murder of an interracial gay couple, and another on an attempted terrorist from theocratic Texas (blonde? check! white? check! imaginary villainous version of Christianity? check!) where apparently life begins at conception (the HORROR! the horror...) but children are modified in the womb to become living bombs...for...some reason? It's flat-out ludicrous. You can just feel the frothing ignorance-born hatred the game-makers have for America's ""fly-over"" country, as well as the flagrant condescension towards those they see as ""disadvantaged"" (women, non-whites, homosexuals, trans folks, etc.). Despite this game NOT being set in the USA, everywhere outside the USA is painted in broad strokes if at all -- and the portrait is rarely ever flattering, though apparently in this game's setting racial harmony has finally taken root in South Africa! It'd be hilarious if you couldn't feel the genuine HATE this team had for the people they depicted thusly.

That said, the game itself is the usual excellence we expect from Wadjet Eye. The mechanics are solid, the puzzles are usually challenging but intuitive (with one or two exceptions that required insane leaps of logic), the characters are generally interesting, the voicework is great, the mysteries are engaging (and in two cases legitimately surprised me -- a hard thing to do nowadays!), and if not for those weird ""Current Year-isms"" I mentioned previously, this would be an easy recommendation. Unfortunately, I just played ""Whispers of a Machine"" and that one did a lot of the same things, only with more subtlety, less bombast, and none of the hate.

The writers built a detailed and realistic future world. And while a lot of games are made by science fans - this game was clearly made by people who actually know science. The concepts that are brought up aren't just speculative fantasy - they're grounded in hard science which, impressively, gets implemented in the game mechanics - like reprogramming robotic personalities or decoding messages hidden inside the DNA of bioengineered plants. It's a detailed look at a potential future for technology - and the societal consequences. It's cyberpunk - but updated to match what technology might actually be capable of a hundred years from now.

In terms of the game mechanics, I liked them - well-implemented. The puzzles weren't easy, but they also didn't follow any sort of weird dream logic that you sometimes see in point-and-click games. Dialogue options between characters is well-written and plentiful. And despite the seriousness of the story and setting, there's plenty of humor in there as well.

If you really, really have no head for science - you might feel a bit overwhelmed, because the game doesn't hold back on its science and tech. But I don't think it leaves people behind, either.

One of the best 2D pixel art point and clicks I've played. It honestly feels a bit empty and foreign when you start since it doesn't exactly conform to the control set one might be used to. There are only two interactions, left click: use and right click: inspect. As you get into it you'll find it's surprisingly rich however.
There are also many environments and one can tell that a lot of love and hard work went into it.

Most importantly, as always, is the story. It takes you on a very immersive and beautiful ride through its futuristic setting. Every character is well thought out and believable and you find yourself empathising with each one's situation. The voice acting is also impeccable. The twists in the plot are also surprising and keeps the player engaged as they wonder what will happen next.

In terms of the puzzles, they are all pretty intuitive. Of course, you're in the future though, so sometimes you might have to think a bit out of the box to solve that puzzle that might not always be in your every day frame of reference.

The game is also very good value for money. If, like me, you inspect everything and try listen to every dialogue sequence you'll find the content is well worth the price.

If there's one thing that could have been better it's the programming of the dialogue tree. There are some instances where you might feel like characters are just saying the same thing they said before but in a different way or where dialogue options that you've already covered will remain until you run through them again. That's a minor issue though.

И вот только в этом году я смог пройти её. Получил ли удовольствие от прохождения? Честно говоря, не совсем. На мой взгляд, данной игре больше присуща средняя оценка, но т.к. в Steam этого до сих пор нельзя сделать, то я решил написать положительный обзор.

Из явных плюсов могу выделить дизайн локаций (понимаю, что не всем нравится пиксель-арт, но мне зашло) и квестовую составляющую: загадки не прям лёгкие, но решить самому возможно, хотя всё же бывали моменты, когда мне не было понятно решение, но благо, есть прохождения.

Из явных минусов:
[olist]
[*][b]Техническая сторона.[/b] Я уже привык к проблемам, которые возникают в играх, сделанных на движке «Adventure Game Studio» (или просто AGS), но это не отменяет того факта, что их надо отметить: нет нормальной поддержки широкоформатного разрешения (точнее, технически она есть, но по факту, изображение в 800*600 просто растягивается на ваш экран и никак не адаптируется), странные настройки лаунчера; ну и самое бесячее: часто бывают случаи, когда окна с текстом проигрываются на миллисекунду, и ты попросту не успеваешь прочитать их. Единственное решение – перезапустить игру (даже повторные загрузки сохранений не помогают). И в играх на этом движке есть костыль: просто в меню добавляется кнопка «Перезагрузить» (в «Primordia» точно такое было), которая позволяет сразу перезагрузить игру и продолжить с того момента, где остановился, а не постоянно выходить из игры и заходить в неё вновь множество раз. Вот только почему-то в «Technobabylon» такого нет, из-за чего приходится проделывать те последние действия, не забыв сохраниться перед этим.

[*][b]Отсутствие интерактивности.[/b] Да, технически она есть, но по факту, только в самом конце от того, [spoiler]выбрали вы «Central» или Нину[/spoiler], будет зависеть концовка; всё, что было до этого, влияет только на некоторые реплики и достижения.
[/olist]

На мой взгляд, главная загвоздка – в сюжете (он и вызвал смешанные эмоции). Многие в обзорах хвалят его, но честно, история тут хоть и неплоха, но назвать её интересной я никак не могу. Вот мои претензии:
[list]
[*][spoiler]Реджи с Лао в какой-то момент предполагают, что Кризел СЛУЧАЙНЫМ образом оставил себе часть воспоминаний Бакстера, из-за чего тот начал мстить Реджи. И вроде бы это звучит логично (и объясняет, откуда он знал многое про Реджи), вот только потом Кризел говорит, что ему настолько понравилась жизни Бакстера, что он решил оставить эту самую месть себе… Чем ему так понравился Бакстер (нам в игре дают минимум инфы про него)? Зачем ему эта вообще месть? Честно, этот момент вообще не понятен мне.[/spoiler]

[*][spoiler]Нина нам сообщает, что благодаря её значимым связям ИИ «Central» не замечает того, что происходит в ресторане. Конечно, нам потом говорят, что Нина стояла за разработкой «Central», и можно предположить, какие у неё связи… Вот только всё равно непонятно, как можно было обойти ИИ, у которого под контролем весь город находится и есть доступ к информации на всех людей?[/spoiler]

[*][spoiler]В самом конце «Central» рассказывает Лате, что он ничего не знал ни про неё, ни про её сродство с ИИ, и вообще, ей подменили данные… КАК?! Как у ИИ, который контролирует ВСЁ, могли подменять данные? В это верится с большим трудом.[/spoiler]

Sem dúvida, algo que fez muita diferença na produção foram as vozes dos personagens que são extremamente bem feitas, com diálogos interessantes e até bem humorados. As vozes das personagens Dr. Lao e Latha realmente são um destaque, transmitindo muita naturalidade e emoção.

Apesar de ser uma produção mais modesta e contando com um time de desenvolvedores bem enxuto, Technobabylon é uma ótima aventura point-and-click para quem gosta de uma história inteligente e cheia de reviravoltas.

+ Riddles
I really like it when the riddles are logical, when don't have to connect weird things and do weird things to solve it. In some of these games you just have to try everything with everything, but I did not have that feeling here. Sure, some things were unprobable, like the laser thing, but it was still within the limits.

+ Story
The story was just amazing. Really, really amazing. A bit dark, a bit gritty, but well thought out. And it was also touching several interesting topics, like artificial intelligence and morality.

+ Art & music/sound
I really like pixel art, what's more to say? The music/sound fits to the theme and some sounds (like squishy noise the elevator makes when he hits the body on the floor again) are pretty amazing. 

+ Speed setting
Being able to set the speed of the game is pretty nice. Awesome idea.

- Usability/Controls
That's the only thing I didn't like that much. I really like it when I have keyboard shortcuts to save/load, use items, move with cursor keys, ... Well, it isn't bad, but I think, they could do better here.

Technobabylon ist mein erstes Spiel vom Publisher Wadjet Eye Games und eventuell bleibt es auch dabei...
Als Fan von Science-Fiction Settings / Stories und als aufmerksamer Beobachter unseres vorherrschenden und im Werden begriffenen Zeitgeists, war mein Interesse an dem technokratisierten Babel geweckt und ich schlug im Sale schließlich zu.
Mein erster Ärger mit dem Spiel stellte sich schnell ein: Die Bildschirmauflösung.
Ich hatte schon lange keine größeren technischen Probleme mit Spielen, selbst die letzten DOS-BOX Abstecher verliefen immer ziemlich reibungslos. Aber bei diesem Spiel hatte ich echte Startschwierigkeiten. Nach entsprechenden Einstellungen beim Start-Up konnte ich das Spiel im Vollbild-Modus starten, aber der Mauszeiger wies unerträglich stockende Bewegungsmuster auf, so habe ich dann schließlich auf ein Vollbild verzichtet und mit dem Fenstermodus vorliebgenommen. Im Hintergrund konnte ich so immerhin einen Übersetzer offen halten (den ich aber während des Spielens, wie es sich heraustellen sollte, nicht benötigte), das Englisch war problemlos verständlich - was die Sprache betrifft bereitet mir die Extensitivität des Vokabulars von Sunless Sea mehr Kummer.
Nun gut, die Immersion war durch den Fenstermodus jedenfalls etwas in Mitleidenschaft gezogen.

Der erste Eindruck vom Spiel war dennoch ganz ordentlich, ich tobte mich im ersten Level erstmal an der Umgebung aus, klickte alles was sich fand mit beiden Maustasten an (erzeugt unterschiedliche Reaktionen) und bekam recht unterhaltsame Kommentare dazu (was schon mal ein großer Pluspunkt war, darauf achte ich immer bei Adventures!). Außerdem versuchte ich mich an absurden Item-Kombinationen (die Kombinationsmöglichkeiten im Laufe des Spiels sind allerdings im Vergleich zu anderen Titeln eher unterdurchschnittlich, das Inventar ist selten mal richtig prall gefüllt), auch hier gab es erfreulicherweise meistens einen individuellen Kommentar.
Zügig wurde ich vom Spiel mit der Trance-Funktion vertraut gemacht, die mir zunächst richtig toll und stimmig erschien.
Es sollte sich herausstellen, dass die Trance-Nutzung im weiteren Verlauf zwar noch recht oft von Bedeutung sein sollte, aber sie wurde dann doch nicht so spannend genutzt, wie ich es mir am Anfang bei Einführung des Features erhoffte.
Nach kürzerem Hängenbleiben im ersten Level durch Verwirrtheit im Dialogfenster erlebte ich schließlich den ersten Szenen-Wechsel und Rollentausch. Ich steuerte nun ganz anderen Charaktere (Charakter-Wechsel sind ja nicht unüblich in Adventures und tragen meistens zur Abwechslung bei), und wurde in den ersten Ermittlungsfall geworfen. Auf den beiden Protagonisten im Einsatz, Charlie Regis und Max Lao, sollte der Fokus erstmal ein Weilchen bleiben. In der folgenden Handlung durfte ich anfallende Aufgaben teilweise unterschiedlich lösen, das gefiel mir sehr, aber man muss dazu sagen, dass es nicht so oft möglich war Rätsel auf verschiedene Art und Weisen zu lösen wie z.B. bei Quest for Glory. 
Das fand ich etwas schade, da hatte ich doch Hoffnung, dass es öfter zu entsprechenden Situationen mit Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten käme; die meisten Entscheidungen kommen im Diaologfenster zu Stande und man kann ziemlich genau erahnen, welche Antwort zu welchem Ergebnis führen wird. Aber einen Pluspunkt für das Einbauen von solchen Möglichkeiten gibt es auf jeden Fall, da gibt es weitaus linearere Adventures... Ein paar Verzweigungen mehr bei der Rätsellösung bzw. dem Handlungsstrang haben noch keinem Point & Click geschadet.
Die Steuerung der Charaktere wechselte noch ein paar mal, man brachte den Handlungsablauf von unterschiedlichen Perspektiven aus voran und erwartete schon gespannt, wie die Handlungsstränge zusammen laufen werden.
Es war auch schön, wie die Eigenheiten der unterschiedlichen Protagonisten durch Kommentare und in Dialogen deutlich heraus stachen. Einen besonderen Sympathieträger gab es für mich unter den Charakteren leider eher weniger, aber die Kontraste zwischen den Persönlichkeiten waren gut portraitiert. Der eher reaktionäre, altmodische Regis', die technikaffine Max Lao und die Trance-süchtige, eskapistisch veranlagte Latha reagierten sehr individuell auf Situationen und auf die Umgebung, wodurch sich unterschiedliche Sichtweisen auf den Zeitgeist herauskristallisierten, die zum Interesse am Setting beitrugen.
Die verschiedenen Handlungsstränge und die spätere Auflösung des Plots empfand ich persönlich als sehr gut in Szene gesetzt und clever verknüpft. Einige Tendenzen konnte man erahnen, aber es gab durchaus Überraschungen - was einer Geschichte eigentlich fast immer sehr zuträglich ist.

Insgesamt war das Artwork und die Story gut gewählt, die Pixel-Grafik ist nach wie vor optimal für das Point & Click Genre, hier gibt es zwar auch hübschere Darstellungen, aber alles in allem zeugte die Levelgestaltung schon von einer gewissen Genre-Versiertheit. Der Plot weist sehr viele Parallelen zu anderen Science-Fiction Geschichten/Prognosen auf, und man hat das Gefühl, so manch einer weiß, wo uns die Reise hinführen wird... Der Aufbruch in eine für manche utopisch, für andere dystopisch erscheinende Technokratie, in der die virtuellen Welten und die Kontrollinstanzen uns irgendwann über den Kopf wachsen und das Mensch-Sein in Frage stellen werden, ist ein gerne gewähltes Thema. In dieser Geschichte werden ganz besonders viele Zukunftstrends thematisiert - ob es um verblüffend menschlich wirkende Androiden geht, um das Klonen, um das Simulieren von 'ausgestorbenen' Krankheiten, verschwommene Geschlechtergrenzen, um ethische und humanistische Fragen im Wandel der Zeit „unter welchen (Labor-)Bedingungen ist Menschenfleisch eine Option?“ oder „Ist die Überwachung von vernetzten menschlichen Individuen durch eine 'allwissende' zentrale, künstliche Intelligenz erstrebenswert?“ - all diese 'Zukunftsmusik' ist nahtlos in die Spielwelt integriert. Und obschon es mich stets hin zum Science-Fiction Genre zieht, bin ich doch gleichzeitig immer wieder beunruhigt über die erschreckend prognostischen Anwandlungen von Genrewerken. Bewusst eingesetzter Symbolismus zeigt - die Agenda läuft im Hintergrund wie sie es soll. Aber das ist meine persönliche Wahrnehmung der Thematik, einen anderen mag es nicht verstören, bei mir hinterlässt es einen faden Beigeschmack.
Und trotz des Lobes in vielen Bereichen, muss ich in meinem Resümee auch noch erwähnen, dass alle (zum Teil auch gelungenen) Bemühungen ein abgerundetes, packendes Spielerlebnis zu kreieren nicht verhindern konnten, dass mein Enthusiasmus irgendwann in der Mitte des Spiels gewaltig auf der Strecke blieb und ich mich zum Weitermachen eher aufrappeln musste...also ich musste mich definitiv nicht vom Bildschirm reißen... Irgendwie stellte sich bei mir nie wirklich ein vollwertiger Spielspaß ein, alles wirkte auf eine seltsame Art 'limitiert' (kein Wunder, dass auch der Entwicklungsverlauf von ""Technobabylon"" wohl eher stockender Natur gewesen sein soll, was ich so gelesen habe), das Spiel verharrt in seinen Grenzen, das Potential war da aber es wurde gefühlt nie vollkommen ausgeschöpft. 
Von mir würde das Spiel daher auch in etwa 6 von 10 Punkten bekommen. Man kann es mal gespielt haben, aber hätte ich es nicht gespielt, hätte ich auch nicht viel verpasst - die Zeit, die ich darin verbracht habe war 'ganz okay'.
Ich persönlich würde Genre-Fans bevorzugt ""I have no Mouth and I Must Scream"" und ""Beneath a Steel Sky"" ans Herz legen! Vor allem Ersteres punktet mit einer viel angenehmeren, ungezwungeneren Charakter-Palette, einem sehr interessanten, innovativen 'Karmasystem' und einer beklemmenden Atmosphäre, die mich noch lange nach dem Spielen in ihren Bann zog und mich ermunterte, im Anschluss die Kurzgeschichte zu lesen.",1616433194,1616433194,True,1,0,0.49916529655456543,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Turns I liked it quite a bit more this time around. So much so that I played through it in one sitting, despite the fact that I was actually supposed to be working. Time well spent, eh.

Anyway, don't have many negative things to say about this one. The story was very good, and I was even surprised by some of the twists, which doesn't happen often. The aesthetic was great, in all it's grim dystopia-ness. I don't usually go for cyberpunk-esque stuff, but here I didn't mind it at all. The comparisons between trance and the real life equivalents were laid on quite thick, but that's a minor gripe towards writing at best. The puzzles were very satisfying, fair, and mostly very logical, to a point where the few times I had to take a peek at a walkthrough, I instantly felt like I should've figured it out myself. The only part I really, truly hated was the arcade bit with the whatever-the-hell-ball it was called. I actually didn't even realize that you were supposed to do something to help yourself gain an edge, and powered through dry, and it was pretty horrible.

To be clear, I liked Technobabylon; it has quite good gameplay, with smart puzzle design (even though it sometimes falls in the ""I just can't find the McGuffin I need"" camp) and a very interesting world. It even successfully comments on a multitude of real-life problems and technological advancements in a thoughtful way, which is difficult to get right and is something I appreciate. As such, there is no doubt that this game is a good one, and definitely worth playing for cyberpunk fans (the genre, not the game).

However, when I remember Technobabylon, I can't help but think of it as a big waste of potential. For all the things I like about it, it misses the mark completely in the execution of its storytelling, despite the forementioned quality of its philosophies.

Let's talk about the biggest problem first, which is pacing. Structurally, Technobabylon is quite simple: You get to a new area, you solve a lengthy series of puzzles, you then watch a cutscene. Rinse and repeat. The problem is that it doesn't make sense with the story beats - you have an intense situation where the narrative is telling you that time is of the essence, but instead you have the same amount of puzzles that needs solving which completely shatters the illusion of urgency. You might think that would be the worst of it, but no! Because there are also situations that are supposed to be mundane or quick (like having a meeting and talking to someone) which stretches into a huge, pointless tree of puzzles for no real reason outside of filling out a gameplay quota. And that's not even mentioning the redundant dialogue sections that repeats the same exposition several times throughout.

Because of the poor pacing, we get our second problem: a lack of emotional investment. When you spend an hour clearing out a virtual bar (yes, that happens), there is simply no space for dramatic interactions and confrontations between characters, scenes that actually matter. We get to know what drives our characters (or at least a couple of them), but we never see [i]why[/i]. As a result, they become flat and stereotypical, with little to no development and stakes that are difficult to care about. What happens might be cool, even topical, but it's never devastating or even tense.

And then there is the plot. I don't mention plots very often since I'm not very interested in them, but in this case, I can't help but to. Things simply happen in this game. While there are explanations to why, they are often near nonsensical, with conveniences building on conveniences in order to make it all work. There is a severe lack of reasons that would make sense outside of this game, reasons that one could actually relate to. And the endings... not only are they poorly set up (the ending that seems to be bad actually ends up being the good one, and vice versa), there is also a lack of character consistency between them, with the same characters being benevolent in one ending only to be menacing in the other. It's just poor craftmanship overall, only really saved by good performances and, frankly, a lot of bells and whistles.

I did like Technobabylon. But when I think about the game it could have been, I can't help feeling pessimistic about the whole experience. I don't think anyone is going to be displeased with playing this game, and mechanically, I think it might even be one of the best Point & Click games out there. But while there is a lot to like here, there is little to love; and I [i]really[/i] wanted to fall for this game.

Technobabylon - приклад добре оформленого кіберпанк-квесту. Приємні фони та ОСТ, різноманітність локацій: від класичних для жанру брудних вулиць до багатоповерхових офісів корпорацій. Помірний неон ""Того, хто біжить по лезу"" з геометрією старого ""Трону"" і, відповідно, колірні гами Сіда Міда (наскільки це можливо в простакуватій піксельній стилістиці). Ставші ""обов'язковими"" для сеттингів про похмуре майбутнє всеосяжний кіберпростір, андроїди та масивний АІ, у якого (на думку деяких) занадто багато влади. Мені сподобалася наявність кількох керованих головних героїв, як вписані теми клонування та синт-людського м'яса, іронія над підлітковою модою на штучні хвороби та катастрофи минулого. Ця гра багато робить добре, але найважливіше - історія та геймплей - на жаль, залишили мене байдужою у кращому випадку.

Сюжет - най буде, це на любов і смак, але чому більшість головоломок руйнують логіку розповіді? Наприклад: ми на розслідуванні вбивства і маємо взяти зразок у лабораторії. Начальниця лабораторії про цей зразок [i]розповідає сама[/i] і зазначає, що [i]він може допомогти у справі[/i]. Але в лабораторію пускає лише після того, як гравець показує їй старе фото і тисне на почуття, а сам зразок її навіть попросити винести на час розслідування не можна. Її інтерн теж допомагати не хоче - мовляв, його вже й так підозрюють у крадіжці. Тому ми маємо вкрасти зразок самі. І повернутися до начальниці лабораторії, щоби обробити його. На її очах. ВТФ? Якби таких рішень було всього пара-трійка за гру, гаразд, але коли буквально половину ігрового часу сидиш і задаєшся питаннями в дусі якого біса це взагалі працює, або якого біса серйозні по лору агенти обмундировані гірше копів минулого століття і їм доводиться на місці вигадувати щось з г|вна і палиць, або якого біса герой не зарядив зброю під час таймскіпу (очевидно, все це - щоб трапилися головоломки, але сюжет не виправдовує), etc. задоволення мало. До самої історії теж питання є, про деяких персонажів просто забувають, другорядні сюжети залишають без розвитку... Але забагато виходить вимог до квесту, тож чорт із ними, з питаннями.

Напевно, об'єктивно - 7/10, тому що гра добре зроблена і ретро-піксельний стиль будить у серці ностальгію, але, на жаль, це і кіберпанк-тематика - єдине, що мотивувало мене закінчити її. Technobabylon чудово виглядав би у форматі мультсеріалу і напевно сприйнявся б мною набагато краще, тому що вимушений квестовий геймплей не доводив би те, що відбувається, до абсурду, oh my, yes.

Я впевнена, що комусь ця гра дуже сподобається, вона точно не погана - просто не знайшла емоційного відгуку особисто в мене, тому рекомендувати не можу.",1611075826,1673212930,False,9,0,0.63171994686126709,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Тут вам и ИИ, управляющий городом, и биохакеры, и импланты, и китайские мозговые трояны, и ресторан, подающий искуственно выращенное человеческое мясо, и много того, что мы представляем себе, когда слышим слово ""киберпанк"". Сюжет так же хорош. Затрагивает различные вопросы этики, показывает высокотехнологичный мир с разных порой неожиданных сторон, о которых нечасто задумываешься.

О минусах, но это субъективно, конечно:
Играть рекомендую в оконном режиме (тут к сожалению надо будет залезть в файл настроек, из самой игры сделать это не получится), потому что в полноэкранном это выглядит как кошмар, глаза от растянутых пикселей начнут вытекать уже через пару минут. Шрифты ужасные. Буквы толщиной в 1 пиксель смотрятся ужасно, хотя и понятно, что ребята старались втискивать массивы текста в ограниченное пространство.
Не очень понравились некоторые моменты, требующие от игрока активных действий на время (проход вдоль конвейера или игра в мяч), не люблю такое в квестах, но тут оно не очень сложно.

В целом игра очень понравилась, сразу же побежал покупать Unavowed от того же издателя.",1611056240,1611056240,True,2,0,0.546410501003265381,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Świetna gra przygodowa. Grałem w nią po skończeniu Whipers of a Machine, która zresztą też mi się bardzo podobała. W zasadzie tematyka obu jest dosyć podobna, a historia jest interesująca i ""na poważnie"" bez udawania głupkowatego/nachalnego humoru. Jednak jakbym miał ocenić to jednak przygoda w Technobabylon jest bardziej złożona, a gra sprawia wrażenie dłuższej (i pewnie jest dłuższa). W Technobabylon łatwiej się za to zaciąć i kilka razy mnie to spotkało, choć w końcu udało się to przezwyciężyć po dłuższym kombinowaniu. Raz tez wystąpił przed finalną cena błąd (zostały otwarte drzwi i nie zamknęły się za mną, a w efekcie nie mogłem przez nie przejść spowrotem, co zmusiło mnie do doczytania wcześniejszej sytuacji i powtórzenia partii gry), ale to szczegół.

Za to Technobabylon sprawia trochę gorsze wrażenie jeśli chodzi o techniczne aspekty związane z rozdzielczością gry (nie można ustawić natywnej rozdzielczości, tylko niższa i albo ją rozciągnąć na cały ekran (wtedy miałem wrażenie że wszystko jest duże) albo grać w oknie (co na końcu zrobiłem). Tak samo konfiguracje grafiki trzeba robić poza grą co jest dość dziwnym rozwiązaniem w obecnych czasach. Więc pierwsze wrażenie było trochę zniechęcające, ale szybko poprawiło się przez ciekawą fabułę i fajnie podłożone głosy :).

Ogólnie rzecz biorąc mocno polecam. Przy okazji odkryłem, że ten wydawca ma bardzo dużo dobrych przygodówek (m.in pamiętam świetne Gemini Rue, które kiedyś grałem poza Steam).

Technobabylon doesn't make this mistake and neatly contains the solution to puzzles within the reach of one's own logic. Also, I was positively surprised by the game giving the player limited agency over the outcome of some puzzles, conversations and even the ending. In order to respect my own time, I have consulted a guide a few times during my play-through, when I got stuck in a chapter not knowing on how to progress. This isn't to say, that the game was too hard, much rather, sometimes I failed to understand my objective to solve a puzzle. In moments like these I wished for the main characters to mumble a potential hint, that would bring me back on track towards my objective.
Speaking of main characters, you will mostly be in control of three main characters; Trance-addict Latha, CEL agent Charles Regis and his subordinate Max Lao. While all characters of Technobabylon are interesting, with their own motifs and backstory, I grew particularly fond of the subtly humorous Max Lao and enjoyed the comedic relief of subservient Chantelle. Still, the game isn't a comedy and will explore some surprisingly dark and gruesome story-beats, that albeit rendered in pixels were sufficiently graphic to spur my imagination. 
Technobabylon's graphics may be its weakest link, charming yet inconsistent in quality. This isn't to say the graphics are outright bad, they just aren't up to the same standard as voice-acting, story and puzzles. Most notably, while the character portraits are looking great, the character-animations and resizing weren't as refined, and some backdrops were rendered much more crudely than others.
Apart from graphics, I had a minor issue with last chapter's story, in particular [spoiler]Galathea's origin story was resolved anticlimactically and without much reaction from the involved parties[/spoiler] in my play-through. Nonetheless, I think my criticisms are about minor issues, and do not hamper the experience of Technobabylon.",1607236028,1607236122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I also really appreciated the world building! I just wish the Trance would have been a more interesting world. It's established as this place you can get addicted to and you'd rather spent you life there instead of in the real world but when you travel there, it's just... meh.

The only real problem I personally had was the story. I had trouble getting sucked into it and it was hard to relate to the main characters, two out of three weren't particularly sympathetic.
While I knew what I had to do, I was often unsure of what was at stake, what the consequences would entail on a global level. Also neither ending seemed to be happy. Maybe because they're meant to establish the conflict in the sequel but they still left me scratching my head, wondering if my choices were the right ones. But as I said, that's just me.

Some puzzles made me hit the wall and I had to pull out the walkthrough in a few cases, but browsing through different strategies was really eye opening. Some puzzles have a lot of breadth as to their solutions.  To mildly spoil one encounter, you can resolve a situation where an opponent is dug in with a pistol by arming a drone with a grenade.  This drone can then be simply piloted to the opponent and detonated, killing them, or for the more merciful, you can solve a sort of Towers of Hanoi puzzle to have the drone detonate a power system instead, knocking out the lights so that the opponent can be subdued and arrested.

With one notable exception, there aren't any choice and consequence situations like that which effect the ending of the game, but it does effect the story as you go.  That said, this was a great Cyberpunk noir detective story, and I highly recommend it to anyone who grew up with the LucasArts classic adventure games.

mon avis général : Wadjet Eye Games est désormais une valeur sûre en jeux d'aventures et ce jeu ne fait pas exception.

I REALLY wanted to like this game.  I'm into the cyberpunk/pessimistic future where corporations act like government and true power is determined by how well you navigate through the webspace, and this game looked straight up my alley.  And let me say that it has all of those things I came to expect: a net-runner doing some IRL running to stay one step ahead of a cunning villain, two futuristic cops that explore both the pros and the cons of living augmented to keep up with an ever-evolving society, and a dark city that hosts even darker conspiracies amidst the glow of technology and progress.

Too bad the puzzles fucking suck.


[h1]Absolutely Techno World[/h1]
Let's start off by saying that the world-building for the game is very well done.  Things are just familiar enough that anyone who's never really checked out a cyberpunk story can get up to speed on the ""rules and guidelines"" of what makes this word tick, while other players more familiar with their Snow Crashes and Neuromancers can pick things up as they go.  You can easily believe how hard it is for Latha to live in the real world because of how difficult it is for anyone without a clear advantage to even have stability, let alone success, which makes her dependence on the Trance all the more understandable.  Old school Charlie Regis has his charm with how he gets the job done by channeling his inner John McClane as a hammer stuck in a world of laser pistols.  Everything feels like it comes together so well and I wished that I could learn more about this world.  Beyond what the game allows you to learn from going off the beaten path, I mean.


[h1]Tragically Babylonian Puzzles[/h1]
Unfortunately, this world is only as accessible as your patience with puzzles.  And these puzzles aren't necessarily hard.  They're just... [b]obtuse[/b].  Part of this is based around how much you have to interact with all the clickables in the world: what's meant to be moved, picked up, interacted with, only looked at, etc.  And while there are a couple points where you can find another way to solve a puzzle, those moments are a bit too far in between.  When you're stuck, you find yourself forced into the usual ""take every item and rub it against the background in hopes it will go [b]DING[/b] instead of [i]phhbt[/i]"".  What's especially irksome are the moments where you'll be stuck for about half an hour trying to progress, only to realize that you didn't click on something that works differently than what you were expecting it to be.  

And can I just touch on Latha's sections for a moment?  Because her sections absolutely do NOT have the same quality as the other characters.  Her puzzles can be summarized as ""Rubbing Wetware On Everything 101"", cause if you're stuck, you probably didn't rub enough wetware on EVERY.  FUCKING.  THING.  Once I had finished a particularly frustrating chapter with her (about the halfway point of the game), I realized that my desire to finish the game paled in comparison to my desire to avoid having to look up what pixel Latha needed to lube up with wetware every 20 mintues.


[h1]So:[/h1]
Overall, as much as I enjoy cyberpunk subjects and adventure games, I can't really recommend this particular union.  The fascinating world is held back by questionable puzzle design and a gimmick that's only as effective as your puzzle-solving intuition.  If you feel you have a keen mind and some extra patience, then good on you.

! Un patch FR existe !


Dans la ville futuriste de Newton, une IA omniprésente nommée [i]Central[/i] gère entièrement la ville, dirige le CEL (une agence qui regroupe tous les services publics de la ville, dont la police) et intervient à tout moment dans la vie de citoyens hyper-connectés. Une série d'assassinats est attribuée à celui qu'on appelle le [i]Mindjacker[/i] car il extrait des infos du cerveau de ses victimes.


On contrôle alternativement trois personnages dans [i]Technobabylon[/i] : un vieux flic du CEL réfractaire à la technologie, sa collègue davantage soucieuse de procédures et une jeune addict à la Trance (une forme d'Internet en réalité virtuelle). Chacun d'eux apporte de la diversité dans le gameplay en fonction de leurs capacités en cyber-technologie.

Le scénario reprend des thèmes classiques de la SF notamment sur l'évolution des sociétés humaines, la définition de l'humanité, les perspectives et limites de l'IA, le monde virtuel, les avantages et les risque de l'ultra connectivité ou encore les addictions. Deux conclusions sont possibles selon un choix crucial effectué vers la fin de l'aventure.

Les dialogues sont particulièrement riches et très nombreux avec beaucoup de pnj qui ont chacun leur personnalité et une existence crédible.
Il y a souvent beaucoup à lire ou à réfléchir et le risque est parfois de perdre le fil de tous les aspects du scénario après une longue conversation ou pendant qu'on tente de surmonter les obstacles qui se dressent devant nous mais les dialogues offrent toujours la possibilité de récapituler la situation avec nos interlocuteurs (et c'est bien plus agréable qu'une banale liste d'objectifs).

La progression n'est pas si facile même si tous les problèmes ont des solutions logiques et cohérentes : manipulations correctes d'appareils, combinaisons adéquates d'objets, récolte consciencieuse d'indices, observation attentive de l'environnement seront notamment nécessaires. Les amateurs du genre vont adorer mais les joueurs moins familiers des point&click vont peut-être galérer un peu ici ou là.

L'exploration est récompensée par le découverte de davantage d'éléments sur l'univers et de détails de l'histoire. De nombreuses petites variantes permettent d'obtenir de nombreux succès (perso, j'en ai eu 25/40 en ayant pourtant terminés les 2 fins).

Si la mort est possible, elle reste absolument sans conséquence car notre progression reprend simplement après annulation de l'action fatale.


Le jeu est très agréable visuellement malgré les gros pixels à l'ancienne, l'ambiance cyberpunk est réussie, les environnements sont plaisants et bien animés, la musique est soignée et toujours adéquate et les doublages (en anglais) sont convaincants.
Une bonne traduction FR est disponible grâce au patch FR de [i]planete-aventure.net[/i].

Il y a enfin une possibilité d'activer les commentaires des développeurs qui apportent des éléments très intéressants sur l'élaboration du jeu et ses modifications par rapport à sa première version. Cette fonctionnalité n'est jamais envahissante dans le jeu.



Vraiment recommandé aux fans de point&click et de science-fiction.

J'ai bien aimé.

Technobabylon. What can you say. Certainly one of the best Point & Click Adventure Games i have ever played. A game where everything comes together to  be the perfect Point & Click experience. No fancy stuff needed, just good old fashioned development by a very simple formula. Focus on the core elements of a well made adventure game, take the bits and pieces from some of those great games, mix them together and enjoy the delightful outcome.

- Amazing Cyperpunk/SciFi Setting.
- Some great Science-Fiction ideas and some great references to books, movies and other games.
- Well-written story and dialogues. Just for the story alone it's worth playing.
- Well-implemented Main and Side Charackters.
- Fantastic atmosphere in which you get sucked right into from the start, until the very end.
- Wonderful Art and Soundtrack.
- Terrific Voice Acting. Really one of the best i have seen in a long time.
- Challenging Puzzles, but never unfair and they never really disturb the game flow. Except for one part of the last puzzle, which is just a mess.

I played with commentary on and it was absolutely worth it. Getting the explanation for every scene, like what they where thinking at that moment and what references the used, what kind of people the devs are. That background really was the icing on the cake for me. 
So if you like that kind of games don't think twice, you wont find anything better out there. If it is'nt your type of game normally ,it just might be the kickstarter you need to get into this beautiful genre. Highly recommended and well worth the money. Ok, i think i've run out of superlatives here. ^^

Ps.: Keep up the good work at Wadjet Eye and Technocrat. Thanks!

Pozornie ten producent/wydawca przygodówek spełnia wszystkie wytyczne dobrych point’n’clicków: ładne pixelartowe grafiki, porządne udźwiękowienia (muzyka + dialogi), ciekawe światy przedstawione… A jednak nie umiem wymienić ani jednego tytułu sygnowanego nazwą Wadjet Eye, który zrobiłby na mnie pozytywne wrażenie. 

Nie zmienił tego Technobabylon, który w moim mniemaniu jest mierną grą przygodową, powielającą błędy narracyjne i najgorsze grzechy gameplay’owe gier z lat dziewięćdziesiątych. 

Zaczynając od początku – gry jako medium artystyczne w zakresie kontaktu z widzem osadziłbym blisko filmów. Tym samym moim zdaniem gry i filmy nie mają tego komfortu, jaki mają książki, czyli możliwości spokojnego, czasem żmudnego wprowadzania do świata, osadzania nas w nim poprzez ekspozycję. Oczywiście nie znaczy to, że nie ma książek, które by wrzucały nas w wir akcji od razu – ale jeśli tego nie czynią, albo robią to nieumiejętnie, nie jest to wielką zadrą. Tymczasem wstępy do gier spod stajni Wadjet Eye… są po prostu nudne. Nie ma niczego, co by nas naprawdę zainteresowało i zmotywowało do poznania reszty historii. Postaci zdają się bardzo płytkie, bo gra stara się je nam przedstawiać przez całą długość rozgrywki.  Świat przedstawiony skumulowany jest do jednej, maksymalnie dwóch lokacji naszpikowanej zagadkami. Wydaje mi się, że początkowe poziomy, swego rodzaju prologi, stanowić mają samouczek dla graczy. I może ma to sens dla początkujących, ale osadzenie takiego samego rozwiązania w każdym tytule jest po prostu… męczące, żmudne i niekreatywne. Autorzy traktują nas jak dzieci, chcąc wytłumaczyć banały, którymi w grach operujemy od trzydziestu lat – a jednocześnie nie mówiąc przy tym niczego, co faktycznie przydałoby się w rozwiązywaniu zagadek.

Tymczasem zagadki – clou gier przygodowych – naprawdę kuleją w Technobabylon. Większość, jeśli nie 100% zagadek wykorzystuje logikę z pogranicza „księżycowej”, odwołując się do „moon logic” znanego z gier lat dziewięćdziesiątych. Ponadto wszystkie rozwiązania są bardzo tendencyjne – mam na myśli to, że twórcy upatrzyli sobie jedną, jedyną solucję dla określonego problemu i nie tolerują żadnych odstępstw od przewidzianej drogi. To gra przygodowa, ale nie czułem się, że wczuwam w protagonistów, a próbowałem domyślić się, co miał autor na myśli – nie, co zrobiłby mój bohater, a co takiego oczekuje ode mnie deweloper. Poza tym, iż część zagadek jest żmudna, to okazują się one często dziecinnymi – ich poziom skomplikowania nie jest wygórowany, jest niemal trywialny, ale oczekuje od nas łowów na określony pixel lub mozolnego powtarzania sekwencji celem odkrycia tej prawidłowej, którą upatrzyli sobie autorzy.  Nie ma tutaj satysfakcjonującej dedukcji tylko absurdalne klikanie wszystkiego na wszystkim, będące niekreatywnym zabiegiem w przygodówkach służącym sztucznemu wydłużaniu rozgrywki, którego po prostu nie znoszę.

Powracając do tematu świata przedstawionego i fabuły – bo moim zdaniem to, obok zagadek, siła przygodówek i aspekt, który może uratować nawet okraszoną beznadziejnymi puzzlami rozgrywkę. Technobabylon ma słaby scenariusz. Znaczna część gry to dialogi – które nie okazują się niczym innym, jak wypluwaniem na nasze ekrany masy ekspozycji, przeważnie w rozmowie między postaciami, które już to wiedzą. Wiedza więc w formie ekspozycji ma trafić do nas, do odbiorców. Jest to zrobione nieudolnie, nierzadko żenuje, przeważnie irytuje.
Ponadto gra stara się zmusić nas do przejmowania się wydarzeniami, które tak naprawdę nas nie obchodzą – głównie dlatego, że zostały nam przedstawione w sposób nijaki, w zalewie masy informacji, którą przeklikaliśmy, lub bez żadnego build-upu. Jeśli opowiadasz nam o czymś po raz pierwszy, przedstawiasz to jako „bardzo ważne” (bez żadnego kontekstu lub zrozumienia odbiorcy), i na tej podstawie starasz się zbudować emocje… to po prostu nie zadziała, wszystko okaże się płytkie, a widz będzie co najwyżej zdenerwowany. Zwłaszcza, jeśli dzieje się w to grze – w której chcielibyśmy mieć wybór lub wpływ na decyzję bohatera. Tymczasem nie rozumiejąc wyborów naszych protagonistów mamy się przejmować ich losami.
Powyższe doprawione jest nijakimi dialogami – ach, nijakie to przynajmniej obojętne… nie, większość rozmów w grze, zwłaszcza w pierwszej połowie, jest po prostu głupia i wymuszona. Zdaje się, iż oglądamy przedstawienie teatralne dla dzieci, a nie rozmowę pomiędzy niby rzeczywistymi postaciami. Co chwilę łapiemy się za głowę dziwiąc się tępocie bohaterów lub sensowności wypowiedzianych właśnie słów. W drugiej części gry ulega to nieznacznej poprawie, ale niemiłe uczucie pozostaje do samego końca. Nie pomaga w tym wszystkim wpychany gdzieniegdzie na siłę, a więc nieśmieszny, humor.
Niestety świat poznajemy nie przez interakcję z nim – tylko przez przydługawe ekspozycje, niemalże jak w programów dla dzieci, w których Podróżniczka Dora próbuje nam wszystko dobrze wytłumaczyć. Albo zabrakło inwencji u autorów, albo mają oni graczy za bandę d…zieci.
W trakcie rozgrywki fabuła coraz bardziej rozjeżdża się w szwach, wszystko zdaje się bezsensowne: motywacje postaci, ich wybory, ciągi przyczynowo-skutkowe… Mamy raczej wrażenie oglądania gorączkowego koszmaru, a nie rozsądnie poprowadzonej narracji. I to nie jest nawet nieszablonowy, odkrywczny koszmar – lecz pełznący po ziemi truposz dobrej fabuły. Pod koniec zdaje się, że wiele rzeczy było wciskanych na siłę, aby tylko jako tako się zgadzało – przez co jedynym odczuciem, jakie faktycznie się przebija, jest niezręczność sprawców Technobabylon.
Nieciekawy jest również sam świat, a sposób w jaki go odkrywamy na pewno nie pomaga. Każdy kolejny oklepany do bólu cyberpunk z wieczną nocą poruszający znowu te same problemy (ale w gorszy sposób) musi rozczarowywać.

Szwankuje również zrównoważenie między dialogami a zagadkami – niemal każda lokacja składa się z długich dialogów, po których następuje sekwencja wielu łamigłówek. W rezultacie nudzimy się jednym i drugim, przestajemy skupiać się na wydarzeniach, marzymy już o przejściu do kolejnej części rozgrywki – i tak w koło Macieju. Zabrakło wyczucia rytmu.
We wszystkim nie pomaga grafika – chociaż porządnie wykonana technicznie, zdawała się po prostu… niepasująca? Nie umiem znaleźć odpowiednio wyrażenia, ale czułem się wyalienowany przez samą oprawę graficzną – a nie przez to, co ona miała symbolizować. Na plus zaliczyłbym mimo wszystko udźwiękowienie dialogów, to zawsze miły dodatek, jeśli jest to wykonane na dobrym poziomie, i tutaj akurat Technobabylon nie zawiodło. Ale to za mało. Definitywnie nie polecam.

Développé par Technocrat Games (2015)

Technobabylon est un jeu d’aventure cyberpunk qui fait honneur aux grands titres de l’âge d’or du point-and-click. Les mécaniques et le style du jeu rappellent de grands classiques comme King’s Quest ou Gabriel Knight, tandis que l’univers évoque tout de suite Blade Runner ou Beneath a Steel Sky. Le récit regorge de tournures surprenantes, parfois tortueuses, et le jeu propose dans l’ensemble une expérience mémorable et passionnante.

+ Mécaniques simples et fluides
+ Superbes ambiances visuelles et sonores
+ Univers, récit et personnages bien développés
+ Puzzles exigeants mais logiques
+ Gameplay changeant et multiples protagonistes
– Récit un peu tortueux

EXCELLENT si vous cherchez:
+ Une dystopie cyberpunk brutale
+ Des personnages de science-fiction attachants

À ÉVITER si vous cherchez:
– Un récit réaliste
– Une aventure humoristique

[b]Technobabylon[/b] is a gaming experience that, like most Cyberpunk themes, offers up the ideal escapist environment where you can swim deeply in the waves of futuristic possibilities yet never once feel the illusion dissolve into rational disbelief.  I was able to be carried along by the plot's varying themes of: an AI-controlled society complete with hackers striving to break down the barriers, a world of terrorism, an environment where virtual escapism into the [u]Trance[/u] is an essential way of living all intermixed with scientific research aimed at breaking beyond the next evolving stages.  

Does the story's appeal stem from the human desire to always strive toward the next historical achievements that makes it so attractive? 
Is it the realisation that no matter what the pivotal strides in technology there is always going to be a human element that is affected? 
Or is it all of this alongside the refreshing humour that is the secret ingredient keeping the player attracted like a magnet to filings? 
I know with complete certainty that players will take an immediate liking to [i]Cheffie/Chantelle[/i] who is just one of the unforgettable AI's and I cannot dismiss the 3 central characters either as each of them hold an appeal that never waivers throughout the whole experience. Whether it be [b]Charlie[/b] the mature bio-engineer turned CEL agent whose past haunts his every decision, or his CEL partner [b]Max[/b] with the street-wise crime laden history - there is no denying they make a formidable team each with their own strengths and strong personalities.  
But... it would be unjust to not talk of the young, [i]Trance[/i] addict [b]Latha[/b] who we meet at the very start of the game within a puzzle escape room chapter that will test the patience of anyone. Believe me, this first chapter is easily one of the toughest of the whole game and is a true test of what to expect going forward in how you will think logically and of the need to explore every single option available no matter how far-reaching. It is that solution that will be a template for the remainder of the puzzle solving going forward.

The story interlinks in a slow burning way yet, as you gradually build towards the twisting finale, it all slots into place; for me it felt like reaching a concluding season's end to an addicting sci-fi show where you develop such a bond with the characters, the world, the plot twists and the engaging puzzles interspersed with multi-choice branching for two opposing possibilities for an ending.

The artwork is exceptional in its simplicity where a 2D world is made to feel like a 3D one, the music is a blend of styles all aimed at the chapter themes, the point&click environment not too ridiculous in its options and an unforgettable VA experience that magnificently completes this in such a way that deserves recognition for what it delivers to the game.
There is a variety of settings to choose from, including a commentary option that is as equally entertaining as the story itself. 
There are over 40 achievements that, much like the chapters, vary from unlocking multi choice actions to a very challenging 'Gravball' game that really tests reaction and timing skills. There are save options available anytime in-game and it features an autosave that allows you to return back to the start of that chapter (if no autosave is made at the time) which is invaluable for those wanting to unlock all multi-choices in one sitting. 

The themes do vary from virtual game addiction, hacking, AI vs corrupt society and some themes that unexpectedly relate to embryos and much more so expect a wide ranging journey all tackled with a wonderful tongue in cheek humour to diffuse the heaviness of the subject matter.
The only possible downside to this for players could be that it is heavily filled with cut-scenes in each chapter so if you are not a fan of 'listening' to plots being fleshed out and, instead, prefer your games to be all action with yourself in the driving seat consistently then you may quickly lose attention span here. But hey, that's what the skip button is for right?
On the other hand, if you are a huge fan of Cyberpunk and thrive in this environment then trust me when I say there is satisfaction guaranteed with this title even if the price seems high, I assure you this is one gaming experience that you won't forget.

I definitely had a good time with Technobabylon. The story was pretty solid (although you'll probably figure out mostly what's going on fairly early) and the characters are likeable. The puzzle set pieces are fairly self contained within a few screens so no hunting all over the map to find an item or solution.

Good points:
[list]
  [*]Good story and writing
  [*]Sensible puzzles that (mostly!) make logical sense - much less ""try everything with everything"" than other games!
  [*]Retro art - very reminiscent of old Sierra adventures - you get used to the pixelly look pretty quickly!
  [*]Creative solutions to problems involving several mediums - and more than one way to solve some puzzles!
  [*]You can die - but unlike old Sierra games it's not fatal! Intelligent autosaves mean no silly ""didn't save for 3 hours? haha you've lost your progress"" moments.
[/list]

Bad bits:
[list]
  [*]Dialogue, though well written is somewhat verbose in places and I found myself skim reading and skipping through
  [*]Controls (though mostly straight forward) aren't explained
  [*]Sometimes a bit *too* much narrative and not enough puzzle
  [*]No ""show interactive objects"" command so some screens are a bit of a pixel hunt (though not too bad)

I do not like all those new adventure games not bothering with the graphics design and settling for this pixelated mess, which seems to be a panacea for all indie games and latest adventure games. Still you have to know this game is a masterpiece.

Firstly it appeals to all who are into the science fiction genre, kind of neuromancer style in an advanced cyberpunk world. This cyberpunk theme is not just the setting, but also utilized in a clever way and embedded into the gameplay itself, which means you will affect the physical world through your actions in cyberspace. The music score is right and the sound design is right too. The core of this game's brilliance ofcourse is the writing. The script is magnificent and thankfully renditioned masterfully by voice actors. Your choices matter and there is some flexibility on your approach on the game's riddles. The plot is fantastic with enough twists as well as not overcomplicating itself making clear towards the end what is really going on and what your goal is.

Technobabylon scratches a lot of market itches; it hearkens back to many hallmark cyberpunk aesthetic details to build a universe that feels lived-in, accessible, familiar, and philosophically intriguing while also populating said world with realized, nuanced characters that drive the narrative. And what an engrossing narrative it is! Technobabylon's mystery-thriller story is easily its strongest selling point and I cannot overstate that. There are plot twists, tense reveals, a few heart-breaking moments, and even some stomach-turns thrown in. It's an experience brought to life beautifully by high-quality vocal performances, decent if underutilized synth and techno music, solid character and background artwork, and butter-smooth animations. The effort in the audio-visual aspects of this game leave next to nothing to be desired.

But for all the writing and artistic prowess on display, Technobabylon has a devastating Achilles' heel: abysmal gameplay.

This isn't my first time playing a point-and-click adventure game. I had the chance to play (and replay multiple times) the more recent Whispers of a Machine not long ago, and it set a very high bar for what a point-and-click detective game can do. Choices the player makes genuinely matter, and I don't just mean in the context of the narrative (which is known to be limited), but rather in the actual [b]ways[/b] the user plays the game; depending on your style of play, your character will receive different upgrades, essentially forcing you to find alternative solutions to certain puzzles. THIS is how you add replay-ability to a puzzle game, not just by having cheap alternate endings (or else it would have been supremely cruel to have no manual saving). Whispers of a Machine uses alternate endings to entice the player to play in different styles. That is absolutely genius, and I want to see that more often.

Suffice it to say, Technobabylon has absolutely no play-style variety. It's just straight linear gameplay with frustrating pixel-hunt puzzles that only very rarely have more than one solution, and these few puzzles never have any impact on the narrative at large. More infuriating than the pixel-hunting, however, is that these puzzles are obnoxiously NOT intuitive. They're difficult to solve not because they pose a significant cognitive challenge, but because the user almost always ends up saying, ""Oh, come the heck on...! How could I have known to do THAT?!?!"". Even worse is the total lack of any kind of helpful tutorial; the player is just thrown in the deep end with a bunch of sci-fi gizmos and just expected to know how to use them (you better have read the complete works of William Gibson and Shirow Masamune...). Proper explanation of what you could do with certain items is also missing; how the heck should I know that the tissue paper I took is supposed to collect blood from a surface I can't even tell HAS blood on it? In what way is it intuitive that a police detective would use non-sterilized tissue paper from a TOILET to gather evidence in a HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION? Forgive me if I don't want to spend 15 hours clicking away in random combinations of items, objects, and locations trying to advance the awesome story which has stopped dead because I don't know what to do. I argue, then, that the best way to play this game is to just have windowed mode enabled and a walkthrough open in your Internet browser that you reference frequently. I never needed a walkthrough in Whispers of a Machine because its puzzles aren't based solely on how wild your sci-fi imagination is, but instead on how good a detective you are. For Technobabylon, I needed a walkthrough within the first 10 minutes of gameplay, which is utterly ridiculous.

It's disappointing that Technobabylon shackles itself to the medium of video games when it clearly would have been more functional as a novel or television series (I mean, if Altered Carbon could get made, that's proof enough people will eat up just about any cyberpunk material). As it stands, Technobabylon needs a complete and total overhaul because nothing about its game design works, and that is such an absolute shame. I was genuinely excited when I bought Technobabylon, and I 100% wanted to love it, but while I have praised and will continue to praise its ambitious and nuanced story, great voice work, and impressive visuals, I'm left with a horrible taste in my mouth from how poor of a point-and-click adventure game it is. As such, I can't give it a good recommendation.

Happy gaming!

The worst puzzle was at the end of the game where I had no idea how to use a certain inventory item, because you don't access it a ""normal"" way.

Also, I had the speed cranked up for most of the game, but had to tone it down to beat a few areas.  My best advice is to not get too caught up in dialogue options and scrolling through computer text unless you're stuck, or you'll be listening/reading for HOURS.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]
Technobabylon is a must-play for fans of point-and-click adventure games, especially if they also like the science fiction or cyberpunk genres.

What stands out the most is the great writing in this game. The story pulls the player in, as it's interesting and unpredictable. Furthermore, the game's fictional world and future is presented to the player in a way that is not overburdening or boring, as the game provides small pieces of information over the course of the entire game, so that the player slowly completes the whole picture. A lot of this information is actually optional and to be discovered by curious players by exhausting all dialog options or by reading the latest in-game news.

Most of the characters are interesting, but sadly the playable characters miss for the most part a deeper and personal dimension. As a result, the game misses the opportunity to make them more relatable and likable. I did not dislike the characters, but the game did not make me care enough about them that I was ever worried if they would die or not. This could maybe have been solved by highlighting the characters' personal lives and quirks in a less serious and slightly more humorous way, which would also have shaken up the overall serious tone of the game once in a while. Having said that, I do appreciate the game's serious approach to science fiction/cyberpunk and its story, and better have less humour than a lot of the bad kind.

The soundtrack is well-composed and an integral part of the game's cyberpunk atmosphere. It's not the kind of soundtrack that is focussing too heavily on specific themes for characters or locations, but rather prefers to stay in the background most of the time to enhance the current situation's mood in a subtle and non-distracting way. As a result, the tracks work very well while playing the game, but it's not the kind of soundtrack I come back to for listening outside of the game (with the exception of one track, that indeed stuck in my head for a while after I finishing the game).

The puzzles are fair, I was never completely stuck nor had to look up a solution, but sometimes it took me a moment to progress in some sitatuations. I would rate the difficulty as ""medium"" to ""advanced"" for seasoned point-and-click adventure players. I also liked that Technobabylon sometimes offered more than one way to solve a puzzle.

The game is targeted at an adult audience, as following the story requires paying close attention and there are some depicted acts of violence in the game. On that note, if the player’s character dies as a result of a poor decision during a puzzle situation, the game immediately resets the situation, so there are no annoying loading times.

What also deserves to be positively mentioned is that the game has a generally progressive undertone towards equality in terms of cultures, sexual orientation and gender identity. I specifically call it ""undertone"", as the game's statements here are not constantly made, nor are they highlighted in an unnatural way that sticks out and feels preachy or shoved into the player's face -- instead, the game just implements them into the game's world in a natural given way.

I'm a fan of the point-and-click adventure game genre and can wholeheartedly say that Technobabylon is one of the best games I ever played in this genre.

The environments are rich and the story is engaging; you can tell that a lot of thought has gone into world-building. The puzzles are mostly excellent, only occasionally erring on the side of being unintuitive (e.g., requiring you to find the one right thing to click on in order to pair it with the one item that will make it work). 

Among the other small bones I have to pick are: the consistent mispronunciation of the military term 'corpsman' as 'corpse-man' instead of 'core-man'; the slightly racist portrayal of Ran Shou-Man; and the tired use of a protagonist that is yet another middle-aged white loner cop with a tragic past, a luddite streak, and a disregard for authority. Finally, the story is slightly overcomplicated, and the narrative makes the (human) cops out to be good guys.

Still, overall this a fun, creative work of art that is worth your time if you like point-and-click adventures and don't mind a little difficulty. 9/10 would get nuked again!

In the early 2000s I'd played through all the classic point and click games and was feeling sad when I realised there would probably never be any more games of such calibre made.  Boy was I wrong! who would have thought there was more superb stuff on the way 15 years on from Wadjeteye games?

This game simply sucked me in. The atmosphere, story and characters are all great. I love the aesthetic, witch conforms to established common Cyberpunk/film noir/Blade Runner-standards, but keeps itself sufficiently original. 

The voide acting is top notch, and the characters are believable, being rough around the edges and each having their own problems and agendas. The game is fairly linear, with minimal going between places looking for clues, since usually you'll only have a few rooms/areas active at any time until you clear the current set of puzzles.

Speaking of puzzles, the ones in Technobabylon are logical, and well thought out. That also meant that there was minimal getting stuck on puzzles. There could have been some more challenging ones but this is a matter of taste, since as is you can really concentrate on watching the story unfold. it took me about 15 hours to complete the game, and I enjoyed every minute. 

The soundtrack is really good, setting up the mood nicely, but never drawing too much attention to itself. I stopped to listen a couple of times and really liked what I heard.

This was the third Wadjet Eye Game I finished, the others being Gemini Rue and Shardlight. I recommend both of those games highly as well, though Technobabylon might just be my favorite of the three.

If you enjoy classic Lucasarts-style point and click gaming with a gritty mature edge (the plot does resolve around catching a serial killer) you owe it to yourself to play this game.

За исключением буквально двух-трёх очень небольших моментов, связанных с особой «любовью» Adventure Game Studio  к пиксельхантингу, эта игра совершенна во всех своих ипостасях. И как приключение, и как отдельно взятая история в мире победившего киберпанка. Три персонажа, за которых нам приходится играть (довольно обычная история для игр издателя Wadjet Eye Games), оказываются в середине какого-то заговора, в который вовлечен и местный уже-почти-Скайнет, и влиятельные круги города, и таинственный душегуб, потрошащий сознание, казалось бы, случайных жертв. Большинству местных вещей даётся нормальное научное обоснование, что позволяет игре не отрываться далеко от твердой научной фантастики, но при этом и пользоваться всеми козырями, которые даёт киберпанк. Получается очень любопытная смесь, которая одновременно и пробудит внутри игрока какие-то отдалённые нотки Бегущего по лезвию, например, оставаясь при этом уникальным продуктом. История проработана от первой до последней строки, ни на секунду не возникает ощущения какой-то расслабленности у сценариста, отступления от выбранной главной линии сюжета; персонажи, окружение, даже самые незначительные вещи, выписаны настолько тщательно и красиво, что возникает ощущение, будто ты читаешь хорошую книгу.

Что касается внутриигровой части, то тут, за исключением всё тех же нескольких моментов, о которых я писал в начале, всё ощущается невероятно. Да, нужно признать, три раза вас заставят искать иголку в стогу иголок, которые, благодаря ретро-графике, еще и выглядят очень своеобразно. Но таких мест мало, и они не успевают утомить. Головоломки в игре идеально вписываются в логику происходящего, постоянно кидая вызов игроку, но в тоже время оставаясь в границах доступного понимания. Забавно, что игра одновременно и постоянно умудряется держать игрока внутри глобального сюжета, и, благодаря умелой режиссуре, фокусироваться на мелких деталях, которые делают всё происходящее куда более человечным. Героев здесь чувствуешь, а потому и драму ощущаешь куда более тонко.

«Technobabylon» - это блестящая игра. Она изначально берёт правильное направление и идёт к финалу твердым шагом, ставя точку уверенно и жестко. Или это многоточие... Хотелось бы верить в сиквел, такая история явно заслуживает продолжения.

Also getting stuck due to pixel hunting which made things take that much longer was not helpful to that aspect of making me want to keep going. To me the game needed some trimming on the story side of things as it felt like i was more bloated than it needed to be. It didn't add enough depth for the amount of added time. 

The puzzles also felt like they took longer than needed to advance the story. More often than not when i was stuck was because simply overlooking a pixel hotspot, because at this resolution combined with the pixel graphics it made things hard to see. I would get to the point of just slowly moving my mouse over the screen hoping something would light up.   The game is pretty solid, but those issues would make me look elsewhere.

It just isn't one I particularly enjoyed.

It doesn't help that ""Technobabylon"" - an Indie-developed old-school adventure-game - utilizes (no, boasts!) old-school graphics. The excuse used by developers is that their limited budgets don't allow them to create games with high-end graphics, but more often than not  indie games like this create high-res art that is then downscaled to ""old-school"" levels, which defeats the whole purpose. The pixelated graphics are more a marketing gimmick, banking on a player's nostalgia, than a budgetary necessity and this sort of manipulation irks me. It's not a good start for a game. More, I appreciated the classic games more when they /surpassed/ the limitations of their technology, not because of it. If I raved about the art in Monkey Island, it wasn't because it used 256 colors and a 320x200 resolution, but because it didn't look like it did. Moving backwards, purposefully limiting yourself for the sake of marketable nostalgia, does nothing to attract me to a game.

The gameplay doesn't fare much better. The game is very linear and limited, lacking in options and interactivity. Half the fun of classic Sierra and LucasArts games was using various items or set-pieces just to see the wacky hijincks (and, usually in Sierra games, unexpected deaths) that resulted. There's little such opportunity in ""Technobabylon""; each room has only a handful of interactive points, too few items to manipulate and fewer characters to with which to interact. The end result is a very linear, almost ""walking game"" type experience, with little opportunity to explore or experiment.

I can't say the setting appeals that much to me either. I am only a casual fan of cyberpunk to begin with, and ""Technobabylon"" added little to the genre. True to the setting, the game is exceptionally pessimistic, even finishing on a downer ending. None of the characters were particularly attractive either, giving me little impetus to keep playing.

""Technobabylon"" isn't a bad game. If you enjoy extremely streamlined point-n-click adventures with old-school graphics set in a cyberpunk universe, you'll probably like this game. Unfortunately, the above description is a trifecta of features that isn't something I really enjoy.

Akcja gry toczy się w futurystycznym mieście Newton, w którym grasuje tak zwany Mindjacker, wykradający dane z umysłów swoich ofiar, czego skutkiem ubocznych jest ich brutalna śmierć. Wcielamy się w dwójkę detektywów badających sprawę tych zabójstw. Więcej zdradzać nie będę, gdyż naprawdę warto poznać całą historię samemu. Tempo gry jest niemal idealne - gra stopniowo dozuje nam kolejne elementy układanki. Cała intryga jest całkiem złożona, ale każda postać jest tutaj dobrze umotywowana oraz interesująca, a zarówno dialogi, jak i gra aktorska stoją na wysokim poziomie. Nie ma tu mowy o żadnych dziurach fabularnych.

Kolejną mocną stroną gry jest klimat, który wręcz wylewa się z ekranu. W czasie naszej przygody zwiedzimy przeróżne części miasta Newton - zarówno slumsy, laboratorium genetyczne, starą fabrykę jak i ekskluzywną restaurację. Gra porusza wiele ważnych kwestii związanych z rozwojem technologicznym, zarówno tych bardziej oklepanych, jak rolę maszyn w społeczeństwie, problemy etyczne inżynierii genetycznej, czy terroryzm, po te bardziej niszowe, jak jedzenie wyhodowanego ludzkiego mięsa czy choroby psychiczne. Wszystkie te tematy są poruszane w nienachalny sposób, podczas dialogów z postaciami pobocznymi oraz eksploracji lokacji. Daje to do myślenia, i pozwala uwierzyć w prawdziwość wykreowanego przez twórców świata. W połączeniu z ciekawymi lokacjami oraz genialną muzyką, daje to naprawdę klimatyczną produkcję.

Jako że jest to przygodówka ,,point and click'', przyjdzie nam rozwiązywać zagadki, odpowiednio łącząc ze sobą elementy otoczenia oraz posiadane przedmioty. Zagadki są nawet pomysłowe i umiarkowanie trudne - zdarzało mi się od czasu do czasu nie mieć pomysłu na rozwiązanie, ale zawsze okazywało się ono sensowne i nie było wcale przekombinowane. Wydaje mi się, że kilka pierwszych łamigłówek jest trochę trudniejszych niż te późniejsze, ale być może jest to kwestia wprawy. Jak dla mnie, pierwsza zagadka w grze jest zdecydowanie zbyt skomplikowana.

Gra posiada drobne problemy techniczne, takie jak niewielki limit liczby zapisanych stanów gry czy problemy z kursorem myszy. Bywają one trochę irytujące, ale da się je łatwo rozwiązać, patrz tutaj: https://steamcommunity.com/app/307580/discussions/0/620712999986875720/

Podsumowując, jest to zaskakująco udana produkcja. Po pierwszym rozdziale omal nie odbiłem się od tej gry, jednak bardzo cieszę się, że zaufałem pozytywnym opiniom i nie przestałem w nią grać.

Плюсы: 
- Мне очень нравится киберпанковый мир, созданный автором, все эти устройства, соединение техники и органики, этические вопросы, мрачное будущее и т.д. Всё это сделано здесь на пятёрочку.
- Разнообразие локаций и ситуаций. Тут и допрос служанки-андроида, и побег из камеры, и путешествие по виртуальным мирам, и разборки в зассаных заброшках. Короче, тут действительно много всего.

Минусы:
- Один общий минус почти для всех игр Wadjet eye - это загадки с ""лунной"" логикой. До определённого момента проблем у вас не будет, но настанет минута, когда вы перестанете понимать логику созданного автором мира. Даже правила, с которыми вас познакомили в начале игры - в процессе прохождения будут меняться. Я так и не смог понять, почему жижа (wetware), которая способна подключать героиню к различным ""умным"" устройствам в какой-то момент игры должна быть применена к живому человеку?! (парень в камере). То есть сначала героиня постоянно говорит вам, что эту жижу можно применить только на устройства, а потом внезапно её можно начать применять и на что-то другое. Другой пример: чтобы сбежать из той же камеры вам надо пообщаться с чуваком, зайдя в транс, он расскажет, что ему надо вколоть некое вещество и нарисует в воздухе молекулу этого вещества. Окей, откуда брать это вещество, если мы  в камере? А надо взять нарисованную в воздухе молекулу, вернуться в реальный мир и произвести с ней манипуляции. WTF?!
- Очень и очень легко пропустить что-то реально важное, но на что вы 100% не обратите внимание и будете блуждать по локациям в поисках решения. Пример: когда надо сбегать из зассанной заброшки, где вас окружили солдаты, надо одного из них поджарить лазером. Как это сделать, если при малейшем шорохе он даёт по вам очередь? А вот надо было на первом экране зайти в терминал, врубить все три тумблера, значение которых вам непонятно, соединить терминал с вашим устройством и потом уже как следует #бануть по солдату. И таких микроэлементов, которые стопорят прохождение в дальнейшем встретится очень много. 
- Интересно начавшаяся история к середине и концу скатывается в банальщину. Это тоже относится почти ко всем играм Wadjet Eye, их слабое место - это слабые сценарии. Автора хватает на то, чтобы заинтриговать вас, удержать ваше внимание, но развязка, как правило, донельзя банальна. 
- Не хватает быстрого перемещения по двойному щелчку, это подбешивает.
- Очень затянутые, словообильные и утомляющие диалоги, в которых на вас вываливают кучу информации обо всём, используя всякие термины, внутренние реалии, имена. Это плохо, это очень плохо. 

Поэтому не могу рекомендовать к покупке эту игру, если хотите глубокой истории и прохождения ""на одном дыхании"". Однако замечу, что в последнем проекте Unvowed автор ВНЕЗАПНО учёл все эти моменты и вырезал их на ##й. Всё, что здесь у меня значится в минусах - там отсутствует.

I had a hard time caring about the plot. It was 'cyberpunkish' but in the end I did not care one way or another. There are some 'progressive' elements that hit you pretty hard and outta nowhere [spoiler]  In five minutes you find out your partner is a transgender and a french maid robot was having a threesome with an interracial gay couple. Also religious people are treated as dangerous zealots [/spoiler] . But once you get past this odd section the game goes back to having you solve puzzles in search of a murderer.

A throwback to the old LucasArts adventure games. Nice pixelated art (although there’s a lot of text, and less pixelated fonts would make reading less annoying). It’s long, and interesting, and just challenging enough to not have to go looking for a hint on line. There’s clear love behind it, 
But the tech upon which it’s built makes it playing very annoying. It runs on AGS 3, with is a twenty-year-old engine!  
It runs on 320x200 resolution, which would be fine except most modern monitors can’t display that. touch display doesn’t work, and wide and ultrawide screens generate a lot of problems.  
It’s supposed to look and feel like a 90s adventure game, but it’s clearly not. The game’s size is 1.28 GB. I’m sure a 90s computer would not be able to run it. 
In an effort to make it feel retro, it’s built for a hardware that doesn’t exist. Maybe never existed. So it’s really easy, for this 2015 game to give you technical problems. 
I see no reason for this game to have to run with such restrictive settings, other than the fact that the developer are comfortable with the workflow and don’t want to get outside their zone of comfort.  
Most modern retro-looking games are resolution independent and get their pixilated look in more consumer-friendly ways.  
I like the look. The feel is a bit dated (it feels slugish, but that’s what old 90s games feel, so I can’t blame them for that — although why iterate on the dated formula if not to continue improving it?). And I like the game.

- Uninteresting/unengaging dialogue that drones on and on. (There's literally a scene where you don't do anything except talk to 5 people). Half the game is basically a reading simulator. Show, don't tell!
- Unlikeable characters
- Puzzles often involve pixel peeping which are 0% thought, 100% waste of time.

Story on the other hand left me with number of questions, like lacking of ""arch"" of Dr. Baxter, as main villian he'd need more exposition. Even Nina got more. 
Adam motivation to literally choke Ms. Reagis is quite quastoning... 
And few other flaws that I have to leave unfold in a sake of ""spoiler alert"". 
BUT! 
It's not make a game worse ""en masse"" - play it, it worth every penny!)

It now stands side by side with AAA+ titles with much more impressive technology and graphical capabilities, which demands much more acting and much less thinking of the player.
Part of the challenge is that nowadays we players are much less patient than in the past.
That required of modern games of the genre to be able to create that delicate balance between being interesting and new, yet with an old-school classic mechanics, and also being challanging just enough so that one can still feel a sense of progression during the game - not being stuck for TOO long on the same obstacle, yet on the other hand not feeing that it all comes way too easily..

Unlike many modern Point-n-clickers, Technobabylon manages to strike that delicate balance just fine.
I felt it has all the good qualities of the all-times-classics of the genre: Neat 2D cyberpunk landscapes & graphics, intriguing story, top-notch voice overs, good sound design.
It also manages to make it relevant to those ""impatient modern players"" I've mentioned (uhm uhm like me), by not giving away the solution TOO easilyt, yet not taking TOO much of your time to figure out what's going on next.
Sure, I did use a walkthrough from time to time, but mostly, I felt I'm making progress on my own.  And that's the most important key point in this kind of games in my opinion.

As much as I love the genre and the story-rich stuff, now when I don't have so much time to invest in video games in my life I'm losing patience myself many times and don't grab games of this type so often anymore,

Luckily I felt Technobabylon made the puzzles relatively versatile (there's some additional mechanics you'll discover besides just collecting items and using them on other items), with the difficulty being just right, and along all other aspects I've mentioned beforehand this was a very nice experience and definitely worth your time if you're into Cyuberpunk AND point & click.

The story starts strong but gets rather longwinded through the middle of the game, and the dialogue during the last major puzzle was incredibly clumsy, lacking any emotional consistency from one dialogue option to the next, at a time when two of the main characters really needed to establish their relationship. The ending cutscene (one of them, anyway, as I've not tried the others) did quite a bit to salvage it, but on the whole the writing didn't quite round out its exploration of its major themes, in the way e.g. Primordia did.

Some very clever puzzles that offer some great mechanical world building, but also some duds. Three times I got stuck wandering around, trying all possible item/environment interactions, etc. In all three cases the solutions required... not exactly pixel hunting but finding things that were very hard to notice. And where a lot of games give you amusing diversions when they present you with hard puzzles, this one had a lot of very sparse environments in terms of interaction. Might have been a budget limitation; all those extra snide comments about the scenery rack up a lot of voice actor hours.

Some LBGT inclusivity that came across as hamfisted. And it's unfortunate, because with a few changes of pacing it could have actually contributed to the world-building. Spoiler about this aspect, but not the main plot: [spoiler]One of the two CEL agents reveals she is trans, although as far as I can tell she is voiced by a cis woman, and certainly looks like one. After a moment's thought I realized that that was quite natural, since the high-tech genetic engineering of Technobabylon's world would certainly get used for sophisticated techniques of sex reassignment. Unfortunately, that revelation was cheapened by the fact that it came roughly two minutes after introducing the game's first gay characters.[/spoiler]

Some rather serious bugs... after awhile the automatic savegame name generation system stopped working, and as far as I can tell some of my saves have disappeared (never the most recent save, fortunately, but several immediately before it, which will make it irritating to play the other endings). Broken animations in a couple places; a contentious relationship with Windows 10's screen resolution manager that makes it aggravating to launch in fullscreen; mouse acceleration that can't be turned off; an interaction system that seems more committed to preserving the ""use/observe"" distinction between left and right clicks than it is to making the play experience more fluid.

I was lucky to find it when I went on a detective/point & click spree search and I bought a couple of them.
In short, this game checks a lot of boxes, so here they are:

[h1]Writing/Story/World:[/h1]
The main reason you'd buy a game like this. It is really well planned, great pacing.

Trying to predict how things would develop with the information given was very rewarding.
The characters have well distinguishable and developed personalities, with good voice acting. Their stories are not forced onto the player, they appear naturally, as they should. Same thing happens with the world, once in a while giving us a bit how society works. Those little details gave the extra flavour that makes it a living world, not just a random setting.
It also picks on some of our own world's topics and puts it into its own's version of them.

Had some good laughs with the occasional humor too. Loved the different AIs, every time.

[h1]The puzzles:[/h1]
The second reason, I'm assuming, you'd get this kind of game. They are simple. Not a dead giveaway, just enough to make you think a bit on how to proceed, but not as much as to make you frustrated and wish for a guide. There's a good balance there.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
I like pixel art. It's not for everyone, but it fits just right. I usually connect Point & Click games with it, but maybe that's just because I grew up with them.
In terms of composition, the sceneries are well put together and feel rich. Simple and easy to read.

[h1]Sound:[/h1]
It either fits or doesn't fit. In this game, it fits just fine. Never felt odd or misplaced. It went along well with the story and each setting felt immersive.

[h1]Summing it up[/h1]
It's a really good experience. You'll finish it in one sitting or two, well worth the time and money.

It's going for old school point and click which is okay, but you don't have to include the aspects that made those game so annoying at times. The puzzles on this game aren't the worst I've ever seen, but some of them are sufficiently onerous that I needed to consult a walkthrough several times because I had no idea what to do and I don't have them patience to use everything on everything else. At one point there is a puzzle that requires you to set something to a very specific number which I think you're supposed to just know? That's pretty annoying. And some of the puzzles are typical adventure game puzzles where you have to just guess what creators were thinking. It gets better towards the end though, and a handful were actually pretty fun to figure out.

Aside from that, the interface is not great and the cursor moves really slow and then hyper fast so clicking what you want is a chore, especially on a game like this where you have to run the mouse over basically every pixel to figure out if it's supposed to be something. Some dialog is easy to accidentally skip. Also, there's no explanation of the controls which is fine at first, but I didn't realize right click was technically ""look at"" because for the most part right and left click have the same outcome. There is at least one point in the game where you can't progress without ""looking"" at something, so that would have been nice to know beforehand.

It's an okay game with a good story and it runs well on integrated graphics. It's dripping in cyberpunk, so I enjoyed that. All in all not bad. Worth a couple of bucks.",1562470041,1563753328,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Seeing as I recently played through all the Blackwell games as well as The Shivah and Primordia, I figured playing another Wadjet Eye Games game would fit both of my recent trends. I found Technobabylon to be an extremely satisfying experiences.

The plot revolves around the exploits of two police officers as they attempt to discover the identity of a ""mindjacker"" (stealing someone's personality through the wired connection in their head). The game is dripping with atmosphere and has the dingy cyberpunk feeling of something like Bladerunner. The story is the primary high point of the game. I found myself more engrossed in this story than any of the other Wadjet Eye Games games. 

The one deterrent I always have when it comes to point-and-click games is the occasional puzzle which seems to defy logic. It has been a problem for every single Wadjet Eye Games game I have played so far. Luckily, there are not too many points which made me consult a walkthrough. If you have persistence, you probably won't need a walkthrough. 

The only bug I encountered has to do with the engine I believe as it has occurred in other Wadjet Eye Games games. Whenever I tab out or bring up the Steam overlay, I have to quit out of the game because all the dialogue options are rapidly skipped. Overall, this isn't a huge deal since it can be fixed by simply restarting the game.

But when they do come together it's really something special.

The Good:  An amazing cyberpunk story told with nuance and subtlety. The setting is both interesting and amazingly creative, it dodges a lot of cyberpunk cliches while creating it's own world, one you will want to see more of.  

Amazing art that is pixel-esque without being part of the pixel game trend that's getting played out.  It feels retro in all the right ways, this game could have come out as part of the 90s cyberpunk boom, it would have felt right at home on the CD-I next to Burn:Cycle or on the Sega next to Snatcher (in fact the art is very snatcher-esque) but it retains some modern conveniences like right and left click for use and view and pop-up interfaces that leave the screen uncluttered and without a frame taking up valuable real estate.  Did I mention the storytelling? the characters are interesting, nuanced and have depth, they feel realistic.  The characters' emotional arcs feel realistic and don't suffer from ""because the plot says I can't be mad you tried to kill me, I'm fine now"" type issues.  

The puzzles have some real clever ones, which involve the ""trance"" net mechanic in clever ways, hopping in and out of the net to affect the real world and vice versa.  When using these mechanics the game really, really shines in a way few adventure games do.  They also, for the most part, limit inventory and number of things in a scene to avoid the typical ""rub every thing against every other thing"" brute force problem solving, or at least make it easier if you do have to resort to that.  Anything that can get you killed resets quickly so you can try again without a lengthy wait. 

The music is great, and very evocative of the mood of the game.  It never rains, either.  Which is a refreshing change from the dripping wet noir worlds of most cyberpunk games.

The Bad:  Some of the puzzles are a real ""guide dang it"" moment, though they never fall into total moon logic (they don't get Monkey Island on you, but some answers are obscure or require going back and re-using items).  Items are re-used frequently which adds combinatorial complexity (though when you're DONE with an item it does disappear, making it so you won't waste time on items that are no longer needed).

the ugly: nothing I can think of, honestly.

Buy if you like:  Classic adventure games, great cyberpunk stories, detective mysteries, great art.

So I could not progress. I know I did everything correctly because I consulted walkthrough guides on each occasion to check if I had missed something, which I had not.  Each bug would have set me back several hours, since I would've had to re-load an old save and start the chapter over. I did use a console cheat instead (ctrl+c) to skip to the next chapter, since I was technically already done with the chapter. Another irritating issue - which I learned the hard way - is that the game does not allow you to move your save files around: if you move them from the install location, to another folder or drive for example, say to do a back-up save, the game won't recognize your save files afterwards.

Z tego właśnie powodu nie mogę uważać się za eksperta, czy też znawcę tego gatunku gier, ale jeżeli jest coś co przyciąga mnie do tego rodzaju rozgrywki to jest to warstwa fabularna i sposób jej opowiedzenia.

Dystopijna wizja świata - ✓ ,

Ciężkie, niejednoznaczne moralnie wybory - ✓ 
Implanty wzmacniające możliwości ludzkiego ciała -  ✓
(no i cała lista zerżniętą żywcem z Wikipedii)

Wszystkie te elementy budują naprawdę wiarygodną wizje świata przedstawionego. Szczerze? Mogłem się lekko zapędzić z dystopią, bo o ile można napotkać tu pewne jej elementy to klimat nie jest tak mroczny jak przykładowo w Deus Exie czy Blade Runnerze. Sam 'setting' nie jest  tak futurystyczny, jak można by się tego spodziewać - przypomina mi on nieco wspomniane wcześniej The Longest Journey, które świetnie łączyło znany nam świat z jedynie szczątkowymi elementami science-fiction.

Historia opowiadana jest z perspektywy trzech bohaterów, diametralnie różniących się miedzy sobą charakterem. Poznamy tutaj Charlesa Regis, członka organizacji CEL (odpowiednika dzisiejszej policji, czy też innej służby bezpieczeństwa,) który nie jest w stanie poradzić sobie z przytłaczającą go przeszłością i ma duży problem z adaptacją do nowego środowiska. Jest to zdecydowanie niepokorny typ z mocno ukształtowanym kompasem moralnym i awersją do wszechobencnej mody na modyfikacje ciała poprzez elektroniczne wszczepy. 
Towarzyszy mu Max Lao - partnerka z pracy, która w przeciwieństwie do Charlesa nie stroni od używania Trance'u (tj. technologii łączącej elementy VR ze znanym nam internetem) w celu odnajdywania poszlak i rozwiązywania zagadek związanych ze sprawami, którymi wraz z Regisem się zajmują. Młoda pani detektyw jest pewną siebie służbistką, doskonale obeznaną z technologią, jednak szanującą metody postępowania funkcjonariusza. Towarzyszy mu ona na każdym kroku, wspierając go tam gdzie ogranicza go jego 'nieulepszone' ciało. 
Ostatnią osobą z trójki bohaterów jest Latha Sesame - bezrobotna, aspołeczna, uzależniona od Trance'u dziewczyna, spędzająca większość czasu w wirtualnej rzeczywistości, gardząca wszystkim co realne. 
Sama fabuła skupia się na zamachach przeprowadzonych przez seryjnego zabójcę. Jego śladem podążają Regis i Lao. Brzmi jak typowy kryminał... i tym ta gra tak właściwie jest - świetnie wykonaną grą detektywistyczną z ciekawą, wciągającą narracją i kilkoma zaskakującymi plot-twistami. Plus cała garść dobrze napisanych dialogów i przyjemna dla ucha, klimatyczna ścieżka dźwiękowa.

Oczywiście żeby nie było zbyt różowo gra ma kilka problemów, które mogą przeszkadzać w jej odbiorze. Pixelartowa grafika może być urocza i przywoływać klimat lat 90-tych, ale jednocześnie bywa momentami mało czytelna. Zdarzyło mi się utknąć w kilku lokacjach tylko z tego powodu, że nie zauważyłem jakiegoś przedmiotu, a gra niestety nie posiada możliwości podświetlenia wszystkich znajdujących się w danym pomieszczeniu obiektów. Zdarzyło mi się również uciekać kilkukrotnie do solucji (zwłaszcza w ostatnich rozdziałach gry) i robić to co gracze point&click uwielbiają najbardziej - używanie każdego przedmiotu na wszystkim z czym można wejść w interakcje w nadziei, że uruchomi to jakiś skrypt, który popchnie akcje dalej.

Dobra, kończąc te moje wypociny...

Вот и всё, что нужно понимать для себя, принимая решение о покупке Technobabylon.


В очередной раз переключаясь со значительно более ""простых"" игр на квест, поначалу чувствуешь себя полным идиoтoм. Цель: расследовать убийство аристократа по просьбе хозяйки ресторана. Обстоятельство: подозрительное подсобное помещение без освящения. Как быть? Ну... попробую поискать фонарик, а еще лучше элементарно попрошу его у кого-нибудь из персонала. Вроде несложно? Хе-хе, конечно нет, в квестах так быстро не бывает, они живут в мире своих уникальных условностей. Поэтому сначала нужно найти банку, положить в неё приманку (не спрашивайте, где её взять), а потом поймать на это всё светящуюся рыбку из аквариума - получите переносной светильник. Логично?

Нет, порой и вовсе абсурдно, зато интересно! Я для себя это интерпретировал так: в этом далёком киберпанковском будущем высшие слои общества и подумать не могут, что у них где-то внезапно может отключиться свет. Странно, но это как-то даже слишком похоже на реальность.

А что, это может быть правильно, ведь киберпанк уже давно превратился из мрачного предостережения о ""high tech, low life"" во ""всего лишь"" кривое отражение настоящего. Кстати об отражениях - в этой игре есть одно зеркало, но оно не работает... нет, не шутка. Причина? Какая разница! Нелепость? Опять нет! Лишь небольшой пример искусственного переусложнения простых вещей и решений. Нам ведь тоже раньше не приходило в голову, что для запуска игр обязательно нужны будут лаунчеры. Более того, люди будут яростно спорить о том, для какого лаунчера им интереснее иконки коллекционировать. А ведь лет десять назад было бы смешно.

Еще пересечений с реальностью? Как насчет идеи ""транса"": виртуального места сотканного из мыслей, стремлений и мечтаний людей, куда каждый желающий может загрузить своё сознание, выбрать образ себе по душе и отправится в свободное и бескрайнее путешествие. Или наоборот огородиться ото всех цифровыми стенами у себя на выделенном сервере. Вот подумайте сами: серая, грязная, трудная жизнь или выдуманный, но почти осязаемый (может и осязаемый - о передаче тактильных ощущений ничего в игре не говорится) рай. Параноики скажут - матрица! А по мне обычный интернет, разве что самую малость гипертрофированный.

Иногда, впрочем, игра забегает достаточно далеко: как насчет искусственного мяса, товарищи вегетарианцы - отведаете? Нет, а почему? Его  теперь просто выращивают - нет больше вреда экологии, никаких пастбищ, болезней. Ну, подумаешь, иногда оно человеческое, но никто ведь ради него на самом деле не умер. Достаточная ли это с этичной точки зрения причина, чтобы оправдать синтетическое людоедство? Каждый сам для себя решит, но идея любопытная.


Пусть у Technobabylon есть привычные для многих квестов проблемы. Например, она иногда предлагает решать еще не возникшие затруднения. Я вот перебирая предметы у себя в инвентаре и тыкая ими во всё подряд случайно начал взламывать дверь еще до того, как мне дали понять, что она заперта. Плюс некоторые механики работают, что уж тут говорить, криво. Но почти на каждой большой сцене хочется ненадолго остановиться и поподробнее её разобрать. Какие-то небольшие внутриигровые новости, детали окружения, диалоги заставляют, так или иначе, достраивать у себя в голове картину мира. Противоречивого, иногда чужеродного, а иногда наоборот вполне родного.

但是作為一個滑鼠點點點型的遊戲
最大的缺點
就是最基本的""點擊""沒有做好

無法hilight物件就算了
問題是這像素粗到這種程度
東西都快糊成一片了 物件還不做得清楚一點
謎題雖然不難 但是卻因為物件太難被看到 而卡了老半天
我最後只好去看攻略 才知道在一堆屍塊中有一根衣架
即使我有把所有資訊都看過 我知道地板下的機關被卡住才打不開
但是我本來以為是屍塊搞得 在那段卡了快一整晚

第二大缺點
是其中一個成就的設計很爛
那個打虛擬壁球的遊戲
對方球都到身後了還打得回來
相對我方只要求超過手臂就沒救了
把速度調到最低 影響的只有我方的速度
對面的擊球動畫都只剩一條光線了還是照打
不覺得自己是被對手打敗 而是被智障設計打敗的

再來一些小缺點
沒有章節選擇
不是所有已互動過並且不再繼續被需要的物品都會被拿掉或不再能互動
設定中沒有無邊框視窗的選項

劇情其實不算長 有很大一部份在看腳色對話
也就是說解謎要素偏少

優點的部分

除了對話中不行之外
其餘時間基本上可以隨時存檔

對話可以按左鍵快速掠過

劇情還可以 雖然分支不多
除了結局之外 也沒有重大差異
但是在某些對話中有做出差異
像是在處理自爆炸彈客的時候有三種解決方式可以走
我為了解成就把前段到中段玩了兩次
(因為太晚察覺到沒有章節選擇
而我又沒有一直存新檔的習慣)
採取不同的方式 後期遇到夥伴時 她對主角的心理解釋也會不一樣

幽默感也還算可以

老實說
這款的優點 與其說是優點
不如說是一個好的滑鼠點點點遊戲本來就應該要做到的

但缺點卻不是""有比較好 沒有也沒關係""的缺點
而是""根本不應該做成這樣""的缺點
至少兩大缺點要是能改掉 我覺得至少能再多拿個一兩分

There’s a distance to travel between idea and finished creation, and the transformative process that bridges those points is crucial in achieving the designer’s goal. Can the greater idea be broken down into its component parts and reproduced into exactly what was originally intended? Consider a simple sentence that can be understood in two different ways (It was the least I could do to give a small example). The writer immediately knows how to interpret that sentence, but if additional texture is added by stressing a word with italicisation, the meaning is clearer to all. In a game where detail and atmosphere is critical, does Technobablyon match its ideal form?

Technobabylon is a point and click adventure in the cyberpunk mould, occupying a dystopian future in which an electronic overseer known as Central shepherds the populace of the city of Newton. With the help of a human police force (CEL) and technology that allows direct interface with machines in a virtual environment (the Trance), life should be relatively easy for the people. Unfortunately for Central, a spate of killings by a Mindjacker (a murderer who literally steals a person’s mind killing the in the process), a rise in the number of biological terrorists (humans genetically engineered to explode) and a potential CEL agent gone rogue, indicate that there’s a bigger picture to be revealed. Plot wise it’s an interesting mix and certainly encourages the player’s curiosity.

The game plays out through the viewpoint of multiple characters – Latha Sesame, a young woman seemingly addicted to the virtual world of Trance space, Dr Charles Regis, an experienced CEL agent with a background in genetic engineering and an extreme dislike of technology and Dr Max Lao, a young newly promoted CEL case officer with no such prejudices. Control is handed to each as the story dictates, with only a very brief section that permits hotswapping between the three, and this division roughly splits the plot into two converging tales. The characters are generally likeable, with Max far and away the most endearing of the trio, but with only snippets of background information on Max and Latha, and with Regis seemingly disconnected from his past, it becomes very hard to care for any of them. This drains the story of dramatic tension, which is a shame given the course of the narrative...it’s hard to care for these people we barely know.

There are echoes of Blade Runner in the mix of shabby run down environs and gleaming high tech labs, with a soundtrack that delivers on the premise of each location, be it industrial ambience or electronic bounce. The pixel art is also neat and expressive, although on occasion certain hotspots don’t seem as obvious as they could be. The music also serves as a suitable complement to the game, but sadly is not memorable beyond those confines. 

However in terms of world building, we see very little of the Technobabylon’s city, and only a tiny cluster of people; Newton feels unpopulated with the omnipresent Central markedly absent unless called upon. The assumption would be that the world is supposed to feel dreary and oppressive, dystopian in a cyberpunk way, but it doesn’t because we never really see enough of it working outside of the confines of the story. As a result the environment never feels alive, never captures the essence of the tech-noir it strives to emulate.

The voice acting is admirable though, each voice different and effectively reflecting the personality of the character speaking. Once again Max’s VA is a highlight, but across the board it’s solid with generally believable scripting and despite not being overtly humorous, at times there’s a dark satire bubbling under the surface. It’s also a nice touch that whenever a character is talking a lovely pixel art style portrait is displayed, giving a more detailed representation of that person, complete with a range of different expressions. There’s also an excellent developer commentary feature which provides a lot of interesting insights about the development process, although there are some small spoilers in those tracks so beware listening to these before a full first run.

But a game like this lives or dies on the strength of its puzzles, and thankfully on the whole they’re good, bordering on excellent. Technobabylon boasts a standard inventory system allowing item combination and examination, and generally most of the obstacles that the player will face on their journey are logical and frustration free. There are a couple of irritants however, where important items are not readily visible against the background or when the player is assumed to have knowledge that the characters who inhabit the world may have (the rules of Wetware hacking still seem muddled to me…). This is worse towards the end of the game, but whilst it’s unsatisfying that there are a couple of choke points, as a complete work the point and click logic is generally good. Less satisfying are the more action oriented tasks, such as evading a guard by hiding behind moving crates or a version of future pong (although admittedly the game intends for you to cheat).  Perhaps the most egregious sin that Technobabylon commits is occasionally abandoning a player to stumble upon the next story beat, which once or twice left me wandering around in circles with no idea what I was supposed to be doing next.

So, let’s get back to where we started. Technobabylon is an enjoyable experience and certainly a fun point and click adventure. It’s got an interesting story, good puzzles and looks and sounds nice. But frustratingly it lacks a certain something, some atmospheric punch that would bring the world to life and elevate the game to something really special. It’s apparent what the developer was aiming for, and it’s almost tangible given any past exposure to dystopian scifi or cyberpunk adventures, but Technobabylon just falls short of providing a glimpse of the living, breathing world that something like Primorida succeeds in describing. Next time maybe use more italics…",1551571698,1551572015,True,5,0,0.601061105728149414,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I have not had a point and click experience like that since playing some LucasArts and Sierra games back in the day.  All I can say is just. buy. it!!!!

Pros
--------------------------------------------------------------
-Fantastic Sci-fi story.  This is where the game shines most of all and is probably the most crucial piece of any good game/movie/tv-show or any kind of media.  Probably one of the most immersive Cyberpunk adventures I've ever played (think Beneath a Steel Sky meets Neuromancer) I always like a game that introduces sci-fi concepts that are original and creative and there are several in this game
-Beautiful graphics.  Wadjet Eye Games most visually engrossing game that I've played so far.  
-Top quality voice acting.  Combined with well written characters, it adds up to some really enjoyable roleplaying 
-Puzzles are a near perfect balance between challenging and non-interrupted by absurd esoteric problem solving.  A very difficult thing to achieve in any point-and-click adventure, the puzzles in this game have been described by another review as ""organic"" and I definitely agree
-Atmospheric soundtrack
-Forgiving of screw-ups with auto rewind feature and autosaves
-Stable, had zero issues or crashes (unlike other Adventure Game Studios games I've played in the past
-Good value in terms of dollars per hour played.  Came in at over 9 hours for me and I picked it up on sale.  But even if I didn't its still a good value at full price not even considering the fact its an amazing game.


Cons
--------------------------------------------------------------
-I ended up saving way more than I typically do and it ran out of space at approximately 50 saves.  Not really a huge complaint as its just my playing style....buttttt it is the 21st century shouldn't we have unlimited saves by now? I attribute this to an AGS programming limitation (but maybe I'm slightly biased against AGS....)
-Puzzles were a NEAR perfect balance....two or three puzzles I absolutely never would have figured out with out a check in to a walkthrough.  Again a minor complaint as it is typical to have a few hang ups like this in any adventure game but overall I stick to my Pros comment,  holistically its practically a perfect balance.
-One or two visual bugs (pipe in den, game play during pong game in VR)

This is probably one of my favorite point and clicks I've ever played and I've played ALOT of adventure games.  This will be one of my go to examples when I talk about the ""point and click Renaissance"" as I like to call these modern takes on the  classic adventure game style of the 90's.

- the Setup-Window (outside the game) has no ""Ok"" or ""Save Settings"" Button. You need to press enter to save your settings, which is a bit irritating.

この昔ながらのスタイルが好きな人は楽しめると思います。
章仕立てで、その都度、操作するキャラが変わります。
場面によってはキャラを切り替えなが進むところもあります。
ストーリーは、中々よく出来ていて、
主人公の過去にも何かありそうな感じを出しており、次が気になります。
近未来で、人工知能による管理に身を任せている管理社会での話で、
80－90年代のSFのテーマっぽい感じの世界観です。
大きな欠点もないけど、このゲームならではの売りもないですね。
一応、解決方法が複数あるものがあり、実績に関わったりしてきます。
実際に80点くらいの出来で、無難にまとまっています。
世界観とアドベンチャーが好きな人なら買いですね。
英語は、やや理系的な単語とスラングがありましたが、
基本的な話を追うのには問題なかったです。

クリアまで12時間くらい掛かりましたが、
初見でも早ければ8時間でも行けると思います。
あまりに理不尽な謎はなかったですが、
どうしてもアイテムとポイントの総当たりになってしましました。
普通からやや難の難易度で、よく考える必要はあります。
雰囲気も出ていて、ドット絵が好きな方にもオススメです。
しかし、基の解像度が低いのは残念ですね、
FHDでプレイしましたが最初はドットの粗さが気になりました。
しばらくすると慣れましたが、もう少し解像度を上げて欲しいです。
あとはドット絵なので、グロな場面はないですが、
倫理的に厳しい場面はありました。未来感を出したかったのだと思いますが、
自分はあまり気持ち良くはなかったです。

実績も一度のプレイで6割くらい取れましたが、
全部取るには、2-3週必要ですね。
セーブしていれば章ごとのやり直しで取れるものもあります。
実績名から取り方もわかり易いのが多いですが、
全部取るのは少し面倒なタイプです。
基本的に一本道ですが、解決方法が複数あったりして、
細かな分岐はいくつもあります。
エンディングも選択肢を変えたところ少しだけ変化しました。
コメンタリー付きでプレイできるのは、ドラマや映画ではみたことありましたが、
ゲームでは珍しいですね。

Which opens up the chance to talk about some very interesting topics, a lot of which game handles very well. Some… well, some feel forced, inconsistent or put in just for shock value.

Which is, really, the only big downside of the game. It’s story is solid, if predictable after the introductory chapters. The characters are interesting, if sometimes saying completely out of the blue lines. And puzzles are mostly well done and feel “natural” to the world they are in.

The art is nice enough, the setting, the atmosphere, all fine and dandy.
Gameplay wise, the puzzles are easy enough to not get stuck.

There are a fair number of cool characters and interesting puzzles along the way, which make this game very fun at times.

But of course, like so many adventure games, the main attraction is the story.
It's ok. Not terribly generic, but not terribly original either. Not super confusing, (which is a BIG problem for many games, especially sci-fi games) but also very predictable. You can pretty much guess all the plot twists and endings about halfway through.
Thankfully, the game doesn't take it's plot twists too seriously, so it doesn't make you cringe or anything, it's just pretty lame. The endings are a bit lacking as well. They're ok, but still some things don't seem to make sense, and the endings are basically cliffhangers. So you don't get a lot of closure.

There are 1 or 2 moral choices in the game, but none of them affect the ending. I like that personally. The endings themselves are also just a choice between switch A or B in the final level, like in deus ex:HR for example.

[b]IN CONCLUSION[/b], you have a game with an ok story, ok atmosphere, great gameplay as far as point and clicks go, and some decent humor along the way. A game in which you don't have to worry about anything you do, because it is very linear, and you simply decide what ending you want at the end. Overall it's a very smooth and pleasant experience, with no real amazement, but no disappointments either.

The game also offers a commentary mode.


TL:DR it's a good game, worth the price.


ONE LAST THING,
this game has some problems with the mouse acceleration, causing the mouse pointer to move too fast. To fix this,

1) Create a file called ""allegro.cfg"" in the games folder (create a .txt file and change it to .cfg)
2) add the following lines within the file:
[mouse]
mouse_accel_factor=0

Technobabylon is a classic-style point-and-click adventure game taking place in a standard Cyberpunk dystopian city of Newton. It takes time to build its world up without being hamfisted or burdensome, and has a few novel, in-your-face elements. For what it is, it's very pretty, sounds great, and had my interest the entire time.

Despite feeling standard in many ways and feeling thematically spread thin, This has to be one of the better adventure games I've played. There were only two sections where I got stuck and needed to consult a FAQ, but all of the other sections were set up reasonably well to be solved. 

Story wise, I have a major nitpick with once detail in the story, but while it was very distracting, it wasn't critical to how the story unfolded. It's hard to explain what exactly Technobaylon is about in total, but at the main character level it's about coming to terms. I think this was done well enough, but the amount of interrelation between everyone and everything feels  juuust a bit too much. This is small potatos.

Technobabylon поведает нам интересную детективную историю, которая будет удерживать внимание игрока на протяжении всего повествования, постепенно распутывая клубок загадок. История поделена на главы, в каждой из которых мы будем играть за того или иного персонажа, а иногда сразу за 2 или 3. Все действующие лица игры очень колоритны, между ними есть живое взаимодействие, а геймплей за каждого персонажа имеет отличия в определенных деталях.

[h1]Скучно не будет.[/h1]

Здесь присутствуют логичные загадки и головоломки, некоторые из которых можно решить очень просто, а над другими надо будет подумать. Technobabylon постоянно кидает игрока в разные ситуации: нужно выяснить кто из 4 подозреваемых сообщник террориста, провести допрос синтетика, уговорить террориста не взрывать бомбу или замочить гада на месте, убежать от отряда вооруженных бойцов и тд. А еще в игре есть 2 мини-игры: понг и камень-ножницы-бумага. 

Также есть возможность пройти игру с комментариями разработчиков. И у игры отличная продолжительность: 8-10 часов минимум.

[h1]Выбор за тобой.[/h1]

В этой игре 2 концовки. Выбор в конце игры влияет на получаемую концовку. А также у нас будет возможность делать выборы, которые влияют на разрешение тех или иных ситуаций, но не на глобальные события.

[h1]Ачивки.[/h1]

Абсолютно все ачивки в игре легкие.

[h1]Музыка и озвучка.[/h1]

Музыка в игре хорошая, а озвучка подходит для каждого персонажа и очень радует слух.

[h1]Маленькое неудобство.[/h1]

К неудобству могу отнести только то, что придется играть в окне 1280 x 800 или же в полном экране с большими черными полосками со всех 4-х сторон.

Some of the time you are put in control of a character who is forced to make an action that you might not want to do.

Puzzle-wise, Technobabylon is on the easy side. Only [i]one[/i] thing, at the end of the game, was hard to figure out... or, rather, to spot. Great idea on this one, though.

There are a good number of optional achievements to be done, and some of your choices will have an impact on the long-term story, or at least in the current scene's development. You won't always see it coming, so save more often than you usually would -- because you'll most likely have to reload a few minutes back more than once.

One of the strong points is the game’s pacing. Ten episodes that take about 30 minutes each is a perfect length for adventure games. The world is nicely built, and you can immerse in it reading the news in each chapter. The main character arc is surprising enough, and I appreciate it not being too dark.

I've generally enjoyed Wadjet Eye games' work but this is my absolute favourite.  It has no weakness for a point and click game; the writing is on point, the puzzles are smart, the story is gripping and the world is built really well.  The puzzles are small-ish in scope but I think that is a good thing in realistic adventure games because it makes sense people are using 'what they've got to hand', while 'carrying an empty baked beans tin to a different city to saw a frayed rope to get the cat toy you need' always takes me out of the experience.  I almost wish they had done more with the interfacing with different software type puzzle that features as it is really nice gameplay and story integration; it is a cyberpunk world, so hacking virtual and phyiscal systems at the same time is very characterisitic and really helps get me in the 'sky is the colour of television' zone.  Did I mention the story and characters?  Top flight!  I am sympathetic for the characters' plights, I understand (all but one and she is pretty key) of their motivations and some of them are deeply flawed or/and likeable in the best way.  Max and Latha are the best.  Lots of fun to be had with synthetics, too.  The story and world pull lots of classic mystery/cyberpunk tropes out of retirement for one last job, but puts just enough of a new spin on them to make them really exciting as they play out and relevant again.

The plot is engaging and the story is constantly progressing. At no point did the plot lose momentum and got you in a ""what the hell am I doing here"" situation. You always feel like you're on a mission with a clear goal.

Defiitely a good adventure game and interactive narrative experience. It depicts a near future (it's set in 2087) not so far from what the world could really look like. Megacities, extreme individualism, loose of indentity, internet addiction, decay of moral barriers, powerful AIs, synths, neural connections, conspiracies, etc. etc.There is some Philip K. Dick and some Ghost in the Shell, but the game focuses more on the struggles of the characters than on the philosofical problems. The setting is really well made, and the characters too, i immediately sticked to them. Good puzzles, diversified and with various ways to solve them. Difficulty is perfectly balanced imo, only once i had to use a walktrought but only because i didn't pay too much attention to the environement...nothing that a (not so) sharp eye couldn't notice. As i said, puzzles are neither too easy neither too difficult, sometimes you feel you're stuck but with a couple of minutes of reasoning and a couple of tries you will succeed, there is nothing abstruse like old adventure games (yes monkey island, yes grim fandango, i'm looking at you) and the the possibility of messing around with electronic devices adds some interesting and funny mechanics. 
The story is well paced with space for funny moments and comments by the characters (btw, there are 3 main usable characters). 
I've heard of people finishing it in 7 hours, i explored avery line of dialogue possibile in one playtrought and tried to interact with everything possible and it took me around 13 hours (maybe i'm just stoopid?). 
In the end, i totally reccomend this game if you're into sci-fi, cyberpunk and point-and-click adventures. Develpoers really deserve it, if you would buy a book novel for the same price then buy this, it's the same but it's interactive!

I'd love to give some thrilling account of the plot to draw you in, but to be honest - despite being reasonably written, it doesn't cover any new ground. And whilst I'd recommend the game, I can't be bothered to muster up the energy bigging up something that is pretty standard by now.

Murder mystery? check! 
Artificial Intelligences? Check! 
Robots? Check! 
Twists? Check! 
Turns? Check! 
Mind blowing new stuff?...uh, no.

Other than a few nifty additions, these are things I've seen / read soooooo many times before. Having said that, It's engaging, well done and for the most part has good voice acting. It also is moderately amusing in places, though the ""kooky"" banter sometimes gets a bit wearisome and deflates the drama. I'd say 10% of it is cringeworthy, which isn't bad considering its not a super short experience. 

Where the game truly stands out, is as a...game. Shocking, I know....But this has logical puzzles, that for the most part are sensible and not overly convoluted. I only had to look up two solutions, and one of those was simply missing an object that wasn't quite visible enough. 

Most are satisfying to solve, and don't just rely on clicking everything before doing something stupid. Like: how do I open this bottle of coke? oh I'll use this bottle opener..nope!  Okay - maybe if I add this alarm clock to this blow up sex doll, then smear it with jelly...? Yeah - they turned into a lazer gun, and now I can blast the lid off. Cool..so, uh, what's the bottle opener for? Thats to throw at the guard in the next room, and render them unconscious...oookay then.

I'm sure we've all played this type of game that had puzzles that made as much sense as that. Well, there's none of that here, and in that regard - it's great. One final note: the artistic design is great, but the graphics are somewhat naff for a three year old game and should have been much better. 

They're blocky, and fuzzy, which is a pity. Though thats great news for people with low resolution monitors, and cpu's / gpu's that can't handle 20 year old looking sprites...Seriously, it actually says as much in the options screen, where it has a plethora of aliasing choices to cover up that this still only renders  at something like 640 x 380 resolution...and they all make it look even uglier.

Technically this game is a joke.

Wadjet Eye has a special place in my heart. It’s a niche developer/publisher that serves one market and serves it very well - traditional pixel point-n-clicks made in different permutations of Adventure Game Studio. They are always polished, feature many of the same voice actors, and all come with delightful developer commentary tracks that net you an achievement for listening to them all the way through. My usual M.O. for this is to play the game through once, get all the other achievements, and then shelve it for some later date to get the developer’s commentary one. For Technobabylon, that time is now.

It’s one of my two favorite Wadjet Eye games and probably one of my favorite cyberpunk narratives period (yes, better than Dex). Cyberpunk isn’t just an aesthetic - it’s a social commentary, set of themes to explore, and way to look at the world on a macro (universal) and micro (individual person) scale. This game is great about doing all of it - wrestling with themes of megacorps and genetic engineering as well as themes of how far do you go for family and how much privacy should each person get.

Also: women!!! There are so many women in this game who are important. Two of the three player characters and (most) of the Big Bads of the game are intelligent, nuanced women who move and shake the plot. It’s great and awesome and see you guys it’s not that hard you just literally have to put them in there.

I strongly recommend this for people anywhere remotely interested in cyberpunk and/or point and click adventure games.",1516587860,1516587860,True,6,0,0.611460983753204346,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You control different characters (2 ""cops"" & a character addicted to a virtual reality), usually only one at a time. But in some parts it involves up to three of them.

With the character addicted to a virtual reality, i found it was a pretty good idea to use both the real world & the virtual world during the gameplay.

I found the difficulty well balanced : not too hard, not to easy either : count 20-25 hours for the first playthrough. (well in my case, you may take less /  more time to finish the game.). Note : game finished without any help.

Voice acting is pretty good . Music feats very well :  one only small regret  there's no Deluxe Edition on Steam  (like on GOG for example).

I liked a lot some funny situations.  (especially with the french maid :P, well i won't spoil the game)

There are differents endings. Many choices are mostly morals & ethics.

Negative point ; Only avaible in english.

You can turn on / off devs commentary, personnaly i found those annoying.... i would have prefered a separate video.

There's an option in the setup to get a better rendering (since the game was created for using a low resolution : anyway the game scales properly for your screen resolution), but it needs more processing so watch out if your computer isn't powerfull enough.

GAMEPLAY: Classico punta e clicca con un comando per osservare ed uno per interagire. Enigmi sempre ben contestualizzati, mai banali ma nemmeno troppo difficili. L'ambientazione cyberpunk ha permesso agli sviluppatori di creare fasi di gameplay ben riuscite che danno freschezza al tipo di gioco, come ad esempio le fasi giocate nel trancenet, una piattaforma internet dove il personaggio entra virtualmente. Menù e opzioni ridotte al minimo sindacale.
STORIA: Sicuramente un punto forte del gioco, la narrazione si sviluppa tra indagini poliziesche, intrecci di più personaggi e un contesto cyberpunk molto ben rappresentato. Le tematiche trattate sono fortemente riservate ad un pubblico adulto e non mancano risvolti interessanti. La caratterizzazione dei personaggi è costruita bene ed è anch'essa pilastro di questo gioco. Longevità che si attesta su buoni livelli, una decina di ore, anche qualcosa in più se si spulcia per bene il gioco con la sua enorme mole di dialoghi.
GRAFICA: Pixel art ispirata, bella per gli appassionati di questo stile e del genere cyberpunk. Tecnicamente però non raggiunge produzioni moderne, sempre in pixel art, come ad esempio Thimbleweed Park. Interfaccia in-game non delle più intuitive.
AUDIO: Colonna sonora adeguata al genere, fa il suo lavoro senza però rimanere impressa. Doppiaggio in inglese ottimamente recitato che fa la parte da leone e sopperisce a molte delle mancanze grafiche/tecniche. Gioco purtroppo non localizzato in italiano.

Technobabylon is a very entertaining cyberpunk themed adventure game that follows 3 unique characters. The first character you’re introduced to is named Latha Sesame and happens to be a Trance-addict and winds up just narrowly escaping with her life at the start of the game. The second and third character you’re introduced to are highly trained CEL agents named Charlie Regis and Max Lao. Both characters are partners and they spend most of the game investigating crime scenes and helping each other out.

The game takes place in a fictional and highly advanced city named Newton. The city is a bastion of technology but it’s also home to some rather lax laws. There’s even a restaurant that cooks people (Albeit cloned people but still). The city is dark and you’ll get to travel to quite a few locations over the course of the game.

Newton is also controlled by the world’s most advanced AI ever conceived named Central. CEL agents report to Central and everyone’s movements are tracked by the AI. There’s no true way to escape its gaze and some of the criminal underworld doesn’t like that and they come up with a scheme to take control of the city.

The game’s story has a lot of twists and turns and all of its characters were very well written and acted. The game covers some pretty dark material so it might not be the best game to let children play. It also features some impressive pixel art graphics and its backdrops are colorful and pretty to look at. Also, it’s soundtrack is superb throughout too. Be sure to check out my playthrough of the entire game below to see if it’s something that you’d enjoy.

If you’re a fan of adventure games, or even cyberpunk themed games, then I highly recommend picking this game up, it’s great.

Dark and gritty cyberpunk dystopia adventure with excellent pixel art design!

Although I have not been a fan of Wadjet Eye Games themselves, I do appreciate many that they discover and publish, this being one of the better.

There are lots of great settings and characters throughout and the story keeps you engaged along the way.  It is also a great use of multiple character and timeline story telling.

The puzzles are pretty decent, if a little silly at times. They’re not hard by adventure game standards. I think there were only one or two that got me really stuck. Many puzzles have multiple solutions, which is always nice.

Es un policial ambientado en un mundo ciberpunk en el que tendremos que investigar una serie de asesinatos perpetuados por un asesino conocido como “Mind Jaker” (Roba mentes) y para ello iremos alternando entre Latha una desempleada quien malgasta sus días en el ciberespacio al que llaman “Trance”, Regis un poli de la vieja escuela y a Max su joven compañera quien si bien utiliza “Trance” respeta los métodos de la vieja escuela.

Es recomendable jugar a esta aventura en “Español” al menos que se tenga un muy buen nivel de ingles ya que la historia es algo complicada y hay mucha terminología técnica. Si bien no hay una traducción oficial se puede encontrar sin mucha dificultad (explico mas abajo).

El aspecto gráfico nos hace recordar a las aventuras clásicas de la época dorada. La ambientación esta muy bien lograda, con carteles de neón parpadeantes, pantallas brillantes, grandes edificios, terminales que debemos hackear, personas con implantes cibernéticos, etc. 
De hecho creo que la ambientación es uno de los puntos fuertes de esta aventura, hasta tal punto que a mi forma de ver han sacrificado profundidad en los personajes principales para dar mas “vida” al entorno o personajes secundarios así como también para centrarse en cuestiones técnicas de la historia.

El aspecto sonoro es muy bueno, con música agradable de fondo y con voces muy bien actuadas (en ingles) de absolutamente todos los diálogos.

La jugabilidad es mas que correcta, los puzzles son bastante simples o mejor dicho “lógicos”, salvo una par de cosas algo absurdas al final del juego y solo una “puerta” que a mi ojos era invisible que me hizo recordar como odiaba cuando era mas joven quedar trabado en una aventura por cuestiones de diseño visual mas que por la complejidad de la aventura.

Como contra, que la verdad es bastante subjetivo, podría decir:
- Falta de carisma en los personajes, digamos como que no llegas a encariñarte si lo comparamos con otras aventuras, incluso de la misma desarrolladora, pero por otro lado han enriquecido la ambientación y personajes secundarios.
- La historia un poco desconcertante al principio, mas concretamente en el prologo, pero luego se hace bastante fácil de entender. Da la misma sensación cuando lees esos libros de ciencia ficción que te bombardean con tecnicismos en los primeros capítulos. 
Por otro lado podemos decir nos encontramos con una historia compleja que toca temas que van desde la informática, clonación, inteligencia artificial, ciberespacio, manipulación genética, etc.
- Puede que tengas que ver algún video o guía para resolver algo muy puntual (en mi caso para ver una puerta). A favor tiene que en varias ocasiones tienes distintas formas para resolver una misma cosa y que tiene viarios finales diferentes.
- El logro de rejugarlo con los comentarios de los desarrolladores es molesto, pero por otro lado es menos invasivo que en otras entregas de la misma desarrolladora.... parece que se están dando cuenta.

En resumen, si eres un amante del genero es una aventura debes probar, sobre todo si puedes pillarla en descuento.

Nota:
Hay una traducción que pueden encontrarla perfectamente en Google (Guías Pat & asperet ) para disfrutar del juego en un completo español (las voces seguirán en ingles). 
Deben registrarse en su foro y en la parte de “Traducciones Guías Pat & asperet “, descargar el archivo y descomprimirlo en la carpeta de instalación del juego (C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Technobabylon)

Es recomendable al jugar activar la opción de ""Mantener diálogo"" en el menú de configuración del juego ya que la historia es complicada y hay mucha terminología técnica, ademas que en algunos momentos los diálogos desaparecen casi de forma instantánea. No se si es por la traducción, pero si les pasa, tan solo darle una vez al espaciador y desaparece el problema.

Well, by satisfying i mean GREAT!

Pros:
- Great story, told/played from different perspectives
- Interesting characters, mostly relatable or at least entertaining
- Okay/not too hard puzzles/tasks - most of them are somewhat intuitive/logical
- Great atmosphere, music and setting (including own slang)
- A lot of references to our actual contemporary society and how it may develop in this not too far future (AIs, surveillance/inner security, internet addiction, GMOs, warfare, nutrition, pollution...)
- Nice artwork, oldschool graphics
- Good voice acting
- References to other post-apocalyptic and Cyberpunk games/universes (like Shadowrun, Fallout etc, also reminiscent of a certain Portal character)
- Often times real funny and macabre/dark humor and cynicism
- Confronts the player with interesting choices, including questions of ethics (or ""philosophy"" in general)
- At least two slightly different endings dependent on your choices

Cons:
- Setting up the  graphics is not necessarily intuitive, may even start with black screen (but the web helps!)
- Minor sound glitches, though it sometimes adds to the atmosphere in the ""Trance""( i.e. matrix,cyberspace or whatever you call it in other franchises)
- The graphics (especially in a small window) sometimes lead to overlooking objects (so sometimes it´s better to check the web after being stuck for too long)

All in all absolutely recommendable, especially on sale.

Playing this will invoke memories from such franchises as the Matrix, Blade Runner, and Shadowrun.
While technically a point-and-click puzzle game, if you have any interest in the aforementioned culture, you'll quickly find yourself sucked into this resource-light, lore-heavy game.
With a little ingenuity, players will find this to be a challenge but not overwhelming by any means.

Because it is a suspenseful mystery that you must solve, I won't give too much away.

Early on, we meet some key players in the story. A Trance-addict who's unemployed and living in assigned housing and used to spending most of her time in Technobabylon's version of the Matrix. Two detectives whose personalities compliment each other well - an old-fashioned male and a jack-of-all-trades female, old and young respectively. These two quickly find themselves investigating a murder commited by a suspect who's known only as the Mindjacker.

Admittedly, this is where I saved and took my first break, so I don't know which direction my story will go from here, only that I want to pick this up again very soon and inject myself back into the gritty cyber noir that is Technobabylon.

Cyberpunks or those interested in the culture will find that it reads much like a book that you don't much care to put down. A real page-turner, as it were.

I haven't written a review in quite awhile but felt that this game deserved one. I'm an old gamer (in my mid-30s) and I've played a lot of games in my lifetime. Over the years, I've moved away from the Adventure genre but I started my decades long addiction when LucasArts was in its heyday so I've experienced more than my fair share of these type of games.

Despite the strong recommendations online, I was honestly very surprised with how quickly I became hooked on this game after I finally got around to loading it up. 

Technobabylon is hands down one of the best storylines I've come across in a video game (a scifi plot as grandiose as any William Gibson or Neil Stephenson novel) and as a storytelling device, the adventure style of gameplay is masterfully implemented to deliver a truly compelling narrative. The graphics are by no means cutting edge but do have a sort of retro-style charm that reminds me strongly of the 90s game ""The Dig"". The puzzles are at times challenging but also masterfully intuitive. Never was i forced to consult a walkthrough but a few times I did have to walk away to clear my brain so I could reassess the task at hand. Perhaps even more telling is how amazingly the game pulls you into its world. Technobabylon incorporates a number of advanced sci-fi concepts which are very much incorporated into the puzzles but it delivers these concepts naturally so at no point did I feel like the game broke the 4th wall in order to explain some info necessary to move forward. Lastly worth noting were the multiple ""choose your own adventure"" elements which allowed for divergent paths within storyline. These elements were nothing extraordinary but it did lend the feeling that you were tailoring your own experience based on the subtle choices you made; just another example of the little subtleties that took this game from good to great.

In summary, this game is one of those gems that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let you go until you have completed it at which point your drive to find out what happens is replaced by a sadness that the story has come to an end. It is quite rare that I experience this feeling with a video game.. as it is more common with a good book that you just can't put down. If you like science fiction storylines, adventure games or just good stories in general, do yourself a favor and pick up this game. 10/10

Pros:
+ One of the best storylines I've come across in 25+ years of gaming
+ Playable characters are compelling and offer different playing styles which maintains the game tempo
+ Interface and Inventory interaction are a joy to use (very well implemented)
+ Puzzles are challenging but logically intuitive
+ Scifi concepts are naturally delivered in a way that never breaks the immersion
+ Voice and music audio are very well done
+ Choose your own adventure elements give you a feeling of control without overdoing it to a point where you feel like you are missing a part of the storyline
+ Graphics give the game a retro feel that lovers of the old LucasArts games will appreciate
+ Multiple Endings

Cons:
- Graphics could be fairly classified as outdated and will turn off some gamers
- Upon completion, will create a vacuum in your life which you will need to fill with more sci-fi storylines",1499439421,1499440310,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The game features a rich story in a dystopian future that may feel convoluted in some areas, though any intelligent individual will appreciate the way the plot is carried out. Without spoiling too much, it deals with murder mysteries and a serial killer who can literally steal the minds of his victims - hence his name, the Mindjacker.

It's full of well-developed characters, intriguing plot twists, and original concepts. The gameplay deals with dialogue-heavy conversations and some challenging puzzles that are incredibly well-designed. In Technobabylon, any items you receive to solve a puzzle make sense in the way they're used. It really plays with your intellect and keeps you sharp the whole way through.

Soweit ich es beurteilen kann, ist es das erste ""umfangreiche"" Spiel des Entwicklers, welches mich dann auch noch derart gepackt und umgehauen hat, aufgrund der genialen Geschichte, der super ausgearbeiten Charaktere, der durchaus originellen Rätsel und nicht zuletzt des Cyperpunk Settings. Beim ersten Wurf ein Volltreffer - Respekt, Technocrat, Respekt! Was macht ihr als nächstes? :)

Die Geschichte spielt in der Stadt Newton im Jahre 2087. Die Stadt wird Schauplatz mehrerer Verbrechen eines so genannten ""Mindjacker"", der wie der Name schon fast verät, den Verstand und dessen verbunden Erinnerungen seiner Opfer extrahieren und speichern kann.

Der Gesetzesapparat der Stadt wird durch eine adaptive und ständig lernende künstliche Intelligenz namens ""Central"" gesteuert und überwacht. Central setzt, infolge der Ereignisse, zwei der Protagonisten, die Ermittler Charlie Regis und Max Lao auf den Fall an und beauftragt sie den Verbrecher dingfest zu machen. Welches Motiv der Mindjacker hat bleibt zunächst unklar, es stellt sich allerdings ziemlich schnell heraus, dass auch der dritte spielbare Charakter, die von der Realität in die virtuelle Welt flüchtende Jugendliche Latha Sesame, eine größer Rolle in dem Ganzen spielt.

Fazit: Wenn ihr einen bis ins Detail ausgetüftelten Cyberpunk Krimi sucht, der intelligent, spannend und auch humorvoll ist, dann könnt ihr hier bedenkenlos zugreifen. Einige echt coole Plottwists und Szenarien, die auch ethische Fragen aufwerfen, erwarten euch zusätzlich.

Minimale, technische Schwachpunkte, wie eine etwas zu geringe Auflösung und die sehr rudimentären grafischen Einstellungsmöglichkeiten, hat das Spiel leider ebenfalls, mit denen man aber leben kann - hey, es ist auch ein Adventure Spiel eines Indie Entwicklers und kein Triple-A-Shooter ;). Ich hab es letzendlich im Fenstermodus gezockt, das fand ich persönlich angenehmer. Dieses Manko kann bei mir persönlich nicht über das exzellente Spielerlebnis hinwegtäuschen.

After all, it's easy to envision a blasted wasteland or an ocean of shimmering glass towers but not so easy to envision how to get there. Technobabylon has no problem clearing both of these hurdles, establishing a thoroughly wired world of networked decadence built on the ashes of the old order. But what makes this title truly remarkable is how that is the very least of its narrative accomplishments.

Set in the advanced, AI-directed city of Newton, Technobabylon follows the stories of Latha Sesame, a Trance-addicted (think super VR internet) young girl from the slums and Charlie Regis, an investigator for the previously-mentioned AI's management bureau. Their tales dig deep from the introductory scenes of poverty and squalor on Latha's side and cold authority on Charlie's. Both are brought together in a very clever way as the plots involving them expand to encompass Charlie's tragic past and hand in what the city has become, eventually touching on the underlying conflict between the rigid governance of the present and the chaos that preceded it.

I know I'm talking about the plot in terribly vague terms but for a game that's around six hours long, there is an incredible amount of narrative twists and turns crammed in there. From humble beginnings trying to puzzle a way out of a locked room and investigating a murder scene, you'll be taken on a whirlwind tour through the wars of the old world, the AI dominance of the city, heartbreaking personal tragedy, blackmail plots, conspiratorial uprisings, and terrorist attacks. There's so much going on here that you're sure to get sucked into the story by something, and once you do it all starts to fit together in a masterful puzzle that may have more relevance to our present society than we'd like to admit. The dystopian themes are strong here and surface everywhere you look, from the gruesome extents that gene engineering reaches to the differences in food machines throughout the game.

What really sells the narrative here though are the characters that you share it with. Technobabylon features some of the best writing and voice acting to be found on the indie end of the spectrum, forming connections between you and people having to deal with organic computers in their brains and explosives in their bones. The natural, flowing dialogue keeps the game grounded even when the plot takes off, and I don't think the game would have worked half as well if not for the excellent deliveries of the entire cast. Charlie and his partner Lao in particular have a wonderful interplay that speaks volumes about their personalities and relationship from even the smallest conversations. And it deserves recognition that similar attention is paid to every character in the game, no matter how minor.

As an adventure game, Technobabylon limits your movements more than most but makes up for it with the aforementioned dialogue and equally clever puzzles. Interaction is simply left-click for use or pick up and right-click for examine, and there are never more than five or six items to juggle at a time. Figuring out how they work together is the challenge, especially with the introduction of some surprisingly deep side mechanics. Latha, for example, can enter the Trance which is a VR network interface. Using organic computing material she can connect to everything from vending machines to door locks and interact with them in cyberspace as you would any other character. Charlie also gets some neat gadgets like a future cellphone that can manage data and network connections, and a gadget called an AI splitter that I won't describe but is used in one of the most clever puzzles I have ever seen.

Still, each chapter is comprised of only a few scenes and usually revolves around a single central goal. It's not a bad way to handle the gameplay in light of the complex story it supports but it should be noted if you're more a fan of wide-open adventures. This one has also made me appreciate LucasArts-style deathless adventures all the more because in the few scenes where death is a possibility, it's not handled all that well. There's one scene where almost everyone playing is going to die at least once, because literally the most conspicuous object in the room is a crate and it will get you killed instantly if you try to interact with it at all. The art style honestly doesn't help this or the matter of finding items, as the chunky pixel style isn't a great match for the slick, detailed world around you. Still, these end up being minor gripes when viewed against the towering success of the story and puzzles. Technobabylon was a pleasant surprise, one that grew more and more impressive the further I delved into its secrets.

Ein bemerkenswert gutes Point & Click Adventure.
Es sieht aus und spielt sich wie ein 25 Jahre altes Retro-Adventure.
Dabei ist der Spielfluss jedoch längst nicht so stocksteif, sondern spielt sich sehr flüssig, da man die Items sehr leicht findet und auch einfach benutzen und kombinieren kann.
Besonders gut ist die Einteilung in mehrere Kapitel, wodurch sich die Laufwege meistens auf einzelne Bildschirme begrenzen und man auch nicht zu viel Items dabei hat.
Die Rätsel sind zumeist sehr logisch aufgebaut und für normale Spieler durchaus zu schaffen.
Es gibt eine großartige Hintergrundgeschichte, die bis zum Schluss spannend bleibt, und sich eindeutig an ein erwachsenes Publikum richtet.
Leider gibt es nur englische Sprachausgabe und Texte, zumindest kann man es so einstellen, dass man die Texte weiterklicken muss und sich in Ruhe alles durchlesen kann, um es zu verstehen.
Freunde der Steam Abzeichen werden sicherlich dutzende Spielstände anlegen, um alle Errungenschaften in einem Rutsch zu meistern. Dann entfällt ein erneuter Durchlauf.
Die Spielzeit ist entsprechend der Story großzügig bemessen.
Abstürze hatte ich keine, ich habe jedoch das Tool Borderless Gaming benutzt, damit ich ohne Probleme bei Vollbildansicht auf den Windows-Desktop wechseln konnte.

Alles in allem ist das Spiel sein Geld absolut Wert und gehört in jede Spielesammlung.

Set in the future you start playing as an unemployed character who just wants to be in ""the Trance"" (what the 'net has become). Sadly she's booted out as someone locks her in her apartment. So you work to break out.

Following this opening you're introduced to the other main characters of the game: Regis and Lao who work for CEL which is the game's version of the police. You're tasked with investigating a building where a murder might take place in a little while, as predicted by the central AI of the city.

The controls are intuitive with left-click being action and right-click being ""look at"". You do have an inventory, accessed from the bottom right of the screen, though you never end up carrying too many items. I will say for me that MOST of the puzzles in this game were fairly logical, with the game providing enough context and ideas for you to work out solutions for yourself. It also helped that, on a few occasions, I couldn't leave the scene I was in without solving all the problems so that narrows down where the solutions must be. 

The main puzzled I struggled with involved me having to leave the building i was in to talk to a man who had appeared outside with no indication. The character was not there when I went in the building. Once I had done that, the rest of the puzzles dropped into place.

I enjoyed exploring the world these characters exist in and seeing this particular interpretation of the future. It's not an interpretation I would care to live in however.  Although I would like to explore ""the trance"".

Une sorte d'évolution hardcore des bases établies au début du XXIéme siècle. Vous êtes un agent du CELL, la police locale et vous devrez enquêter sur une série de meurtres qui semblent avoir un lien eux de par le faite que les victimes se font tuer par une sorte de piratage de leur implant cérébrale que tout être humain qui se respecte possède.

Je n'ai pas envi d'aller plus loin dans l'explication de l'histoire pour ne pas vous spoiler. Niveau gameplay, on reste dans le classique : Dialogues, ramassage d'objets, combinaisons d'objets avec en plus la possibilité d'aller dans la ""Trance"", la réalité virtuelle remplaçant internet dont je parlais plus haut.

The puzzles aren't too intense, had to look up two things while playing. At first, I just failed to understand how the terminal I was using in-game was supposed to work, but as soon as I looked it up it made sense.

Otherwise, the graphic is retro but full of color and detail. The voice acting is superb throughout the game. Characters talk and act believably.

The story, game design, art, voice acting, dialogue are all top notch and easily exceeded my expectations. And the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Surprisingly, Technobabylon kind of seems to have flown under the radar. It deserves more attention and love from discerning gamers of the unhurried variety.

Highly recommended, a 9.5/ 10 for me in this genre and style. After completing, will edit this review to revise and add to these impressions.

Update after completing Technobabylon:
-----------------------------------------------------
The game is as good, solid and well thought out as in my initial impression above. If not more. Game design is particularly good, there is coherency and no dead ends. The puzzles are excellent and satisfying- I never had to consult a guide. The writing is first class and thought provoking, with many science and technology themes explored.

On an ending note, Technobabylon gives many opportunities to interact with characters, and they should be seized to appreciate the story that much more. As before, a splendid 9.5/ 10.",1490479465,1490984122,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The best part of this game was easily the characters. A wide variety of characters with distinct personalities, and each with actually pretty good voice acting! To top it off, this game does something many others fail to do. This game actually had diversity in its characters. Characters ranging in age, sexuality, gender and nationality, and all of them well written. You even get to play as two characters that ARE NOT an old white guy (and hey I loved Dr Regis despite that).

The story was really gripping and interesting, the gameplay was simple but it worked better than many other adventure games, and the all the visuals were wonderful. The music wasn't too great but it wasn't annoying at anypoint.

The only real issues I had with the game was some simple bugs, that were more an issue of the AGS engine than anything else. Characters clipping through walls during animations, elevators getting stuck, that sort of thing.

The puzzles were, up until one bit in the very last section, sensible and fun. At no other point did I hate a puzzle for making no sense or give in to looking it up.

+The game is broken up into ten chapters and each chapter takes place in a relatively small area with a limited inventory so things never become overwhelming.

The story presents you with authentic moral choices which actually matter insofar as you care about what's happening because the characters are very well drawn. If you are confused about someone's motivations, then it's because the writers meant it, not due to poor design.

Me he quedado con ganas de más, pero no porque el juego sea corto, tiene una buena duración para su género y dos finales bastante diferentes, ninguno claramente mejor que el otro.

Se trata de una historia Cyberpunk ambientada en una ciudad-estado del futuro, y vamos controlando a tres personajes: dos detectives y una joven adicta a la red. La relación que los une entre sí y a una serie de crímenes se va desvelando al avanzar la historia. El juego trata bajo una óptica de ciencia-ficción temas como la bioingeniería y sus posibles usos, tanto constructivos como destructivos, la conexión directa entre cerebros humanos, máquinas y la red, o el desarrollo de la inteligencia artificial.

Los personajes son complejos, interesantes, y a veces encantadores o incluso graciosos, a pesar de la siniestra trama en la que se ven envueltos. Además entre ellos hay representación de distintos orígenes étnicos y sexualidades, y uno de los personajes principales es, entre muchas otras cosas, una mujer trans, sin que este rasgo la defina. Estas cosas no tienen un peso especial en la trama, simplemente están ahí.

Los puzles son satisfactorios, que es de lo mejor que se puede decir, tanto por su diseño y su, por lo general, equilibrada relación dificultad/lógica, como por el entorno argumental en el que se desarrollan. Hay casos en que tienes distintas opciones para resolver un mismo problema, y a veces lo que elijas repercute en diálogos o detalles secundarios de capítulos posteriores, pero en nada demasiado importante hasta el área del final, en la que una acción decide entre los dos desenlaces.

  * solide Rätsel
  * Rätsel sind selten unfair, bieten öfter auch mehrere Lösungswege
  * guter Soundtrack
  * spannende Geschichte
  * alle Dialoge mit Sprache
  * Rücksetzpunkte äußerst fair gewählt
  
Negativ fällt auf:
  * das Spiel gibt es nur in Englisch (für diejenigen die lieber in dt. spielen also nix)
  * Der Pixellook verträgt sich nicht unbedingt mit den Menü / Inventar
  * Computerdialoge wie Email oder Frachtverwaltungs-system sind sperrig

[b]Zum Gameplay/Story:[/b]  

Nach einer kurzen Einstiegssequenz, fängt die Geschichte, welche im Jahr 2087 spielt, relativ harmlos mit einer ""Internet""abhängigen an. Jene sieht sich, wegen einem ""Internet""ausfall, genötigt ihre Arbeitslosenunterkunft zu verlassen um woanders Online zu gehen. Problem ist nur das sie eingesperrt ist und sich durch das Türschloß hacken muss.

Im ersten Kapitel kriegt man schon einige schräge, aber vorstellbare Zukunftsvisionen vermittelt, ohne ein kitschiges Verschiebepuzzle als Hackingersatz vorgesetzt zu bekommen. Stattdessen muß man sich der wenigen Hilfsmittel bedienen, genau aufpassen wie man Geräte im Raum, lokale Netzwerkverbindung und elektronisches Türschloß in richtiger Reihe kombiniert, um damit in die Freiheit zu gelangen. Kurzum ich sass 40 Minuten an diesem ersten Rätsel. :)

Gleich darauf, Szenenwechsel Kapitel 2. Man schlüpft hier in die Rolle eines Polizisten, der mit seiner Partnerin ein noch nicht stattgefundenes Verbrechen verhindern soll. Der Zentralrechner der Stadt orderte ihren Einsatz und wie es so kommt, ein Vorfall findet statt welches gleich den Spieler die Ermittlungen starten lässt. Dieser Part ist eine sehr schöne Anlehnung an Geschichten wie Minority Report oder Blade Runner und bringt zugleich sehr schön geschriebene und überzeugende Dialoge zw. den Polizisten.

Internetjunkie und Polizeiermittlung. Am Anfang scheinen die 2 Szenen total unabhängig, doch sind damit erstmal die drei Hauptcharaktäre eingeführt. Die leicht verschachtelte Erzählweise bringt Kapitel für Kapitel mehr Verständnis für die Vorgänge in der Zukunftsmetropole. 

Themen wie Gentechnik, Sozialstaat, Internet of Things, Verschmelzung von Mensch und Technik, und vieles mehr ist zu finden. Dabei werden die Themen oft wie selbstverständlich behandelt und nur äußerst selten dem Spieler direkt vor Augen gehalten. Das ist sehr angenehm, da die eigentliche Geschichte ein Thriller ist der sich um die Ermittlungen in einer Mordserie dreht. Man bekommt nie das Gefühl das der Autor versucht irgendwelche Sci-Fi Visionen vorzustellen oder zu bewerben.
Wer sich ein wenig im Setting Cyberpunk / Sci-Fi / Technikentwicklungen auskennt bekommt bekannte Kost appetitlich serviert und wird von der eigentlichen Geschichte nur wenig abgelenkt.

Insgesammt bietet das Spiel 10 Kapitel in denen so einige unvermittelte Storywendungen auftauchen, welche einen schönen welterschütternden Höhepunkt und Finale liefert. Man bekommt sogar ein alternatives Ende sodass rechtzeitiges Abspeichern oder erneutes Durchspielen - mit Entwicklerkommentaren(!) - sehr zu empfehlen ist. 
Anders als bei vielen anderen Spielen, welche eins ihrer alternativen Ende bevorzugen, sind Technobabylons Enden beide gut geschrieben und jeweils befriedigende, wenn auch leicht beklemmende Abschlüsse der Story.",1489000104,1511379720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

La historia está muy bien, tiene personajes que te enganchan para saber su relación y su pasado, y los giros de la historia te mantienen entretenido y queriendo saber como acaba.

One of the best (possibly the best actually) point-and-click I've ever played.
Story starts out kinda confusing but it doesn't take too long to start getting good. 88% of the voice acting is really great (Only a couple actors I thought were a bit sub-par) And the pixel art, oh my goodness the artwork in this game is incredible. One of the best looking cyberpunk worlds I've ever seen, absolutely loved it. Also the soundtrack is just *perfect* for setting the mood in any scene/area of the game, it compliments it flawlessly.
I'd very well say this may be one of my favorite games of all time. It really is THAT good.
Definitely the kinda game that should be played at a slower pace though, take your time to talk to everyone, read everything, and just get invested/immersed in it. Cause if ya do it makes the whole thing a whole lot more enjoyable (And the story a lot more understandable)
Also I almost forgot to mention how great *most* of the puzzles are (only 2 or 3 I thought had some weird solutions) But the amount of items you can interact with in an area is usually limited to only things you NEED to interact with, so that helps a lot with solving puzzles, but also almost every puzzle actually makes sense, which isn't something that can be said for a LOT of point-and-click games.

This was clearly someone's passion project. Either that or someone's first stab at making something so cohesive and interesting. It was a valiant effort on the creator's part. And I want to stress my appreciation for the talent and effort put into this. Even if I can't really sink my teeth into it personally. From the art to the lore to the voice talent, you can tell that people really labored over this; that much is evident. However, there are some parts missing here. There are some ingredients missing from the soup,

Technobabylon is a story about a futuristic world that couldn't care less. Cloned babies, overbearing artificial intelligence, zero privacy, escapism, nuclear war, and the ever present looming threat of scarcity masked as abundance. Everything is here and accounted for. What I can give Technobabylon credit for is how it presents its setting. It doesn't bother to bombard you. It gives you clues about this world you're experiencing. And aside from a set of very specific situations, it isn't required that you care at all about this setting. The characters themselves clearly don't. That's a little more believable in my opinion. If we all lived in the dystopia, I'd doubt that anyone would care after so long. That's natural for these characters, and this is shown in game. Kudos.

Now, I'm going to have to take those kudos right back, because for these steps forward, Technobabylon makes some very curious design choices. I know it's the future in all, but this game has a bizarre fixation on fitting in some heavyweight rhetoric in the wrong places. What do I mean? Well, early in the game we learn that one of the major characters underwent a sex change. Wowee. And this is just mentioned in passing. Never comes up. Never adds much to the character other than a moment of, ""uhh.. ok?"" If anything this soured my vision of one of the characters right off the bat. Why would I care about a character's gender? Or past gender? Especially if this point was treated with none of the tact and meaning that a subject like this usually requires.

Later in the game we're introduced to a homosexual couple who have a synthetic housemaid who's strongly implied to be assisting them in the bedroom. Did I say strongly implied? I mean outright stated. Now, that's fantastic and all, but this is just dropped and left to sit there. The most we know about them is they like Paris. That's about it... Again, no investment. No meaning whatsoever. Strike two. The last straw came late in the game when I witnessed the fastest devolution of what could've been mildly entertaining dialogue into what was essentially akin to ""mind your pronouns."" Apparently the distinction between gynoid and android is very important? Also, points for me reacting almost exactly like the villain did.

Contrast this with the only straight relationship in the game: Regis and his wife. This relationship isn't impactful because its straight, its impactful because it plays a significant role in these character's motivations. It plays into the plot a lot more. It actually contributes. In fact, this point would've remained entirely unchanged if it were a homosexual relationship anyway. I feel like the game tried to make it a point to include these things but ended up making them completely insubstantial as a result.

As far as the rest of the game goes, I can say everything blends together more or less. It does the setting well, like I said, but failure to utilize this and make something meaningful just leads to more disappointment. The characters are serviceable. So is the plot. It really comes down to how predictable you like your point and click games. I could guess the big twist about two hours before I actually completed the game. And while I'm throwing stones, the last area and the ending are so horribly contrived that it ruins anything the game was trying to set up. Some special thread of voodoo magic is tying these character's fates together. It's up to Regis Philbin and two other people to save the world I guess.

For what it's worth, this is an alright experience. I wouldn't recommend it for a few reasons. The later half of the game suffers from lack of direction, and it all trails into the worst parts of the game. Puzzles fall into two categories: immediately obvious and impossible. Out of the entire cast, Regis was the only one I was vaguely interested in. The entire rest of the cast was more or less forgettable or boring. And the big top off is the ending. For the asking price, this is an alright game to put some hours into. But honestly, I just don't regard it as exceptional.",1485592331,1485592331,False,13,1,0.444613903760910034,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Point & click + cyberpunk is a rather common combination, these days. For example, see Read Only Memories, Void & Meddler, Gemini Rue... All these games are good, but Technobabylon is definitely the best I've ever played.

All characters are very interesting, full of surprises.

The scenario is clever, unexpected, easily believable, easily understandable, and full of interesting moral dilemmas.

There are two great endings. It's very hard to say which one is the best.

Musics and graphics are both beautiful. Voice actors are great.

As in most cyberpunk games, there is a queer side, but it is not too invasive, unlike in many others (see Read Only Memories and Void & Meddler, for example, that can be annoying here). This aspect of the game is balanced correctly.

因為控制輿論的自稱「知識」，追求自由的就自稱「無知」以為反諷

再例如
這個時代基因科技非常發達，各種疾病都已經絕種
然後就出現了一群反社會的「疾病主義」年輕人
他們在腦部網路安裝各種疾病軟體讓自己出現各種病徵
理念是「這個社會無法剝奪我生病的自由」或是「疾病形塑社會文化就像黑死病形塑歐洲」之類的

These kinds of games rely on the story. The game takes place in the future, where the city of Newton is controlled by a central computer and the internet is now multiple virtual worlds that you can access with your brain. Most of the time you control two characters, Latha, an internet adict, and Charlie, a police detective. That's pretty much the introduction to avoid spoilers.

I found the story interesting but as always it is often hard to figure out what to do. However if you're not fond of searching or figuring out random puzzles like myself, you can just check a walkthrough on the internet. Still, the puzzles aren't hard to figure out and I did not get stuck that much.

Technobabylon has an amazing narrative setting and will impress you with its very down-to-earth take on cyberpunk philosophy, technology and social themes. On the other hand, the game itself is only average for a point-and-click adventure. Fortunately, it lets its narrative parts shine through it.

[b]Full version[/b]

Being a cyberpunk fan, I bought Technobabylon hoping to experience a good cyberpunk story, and in that regard, I was more than satisfied. The game's strongest point is definitely how clever, well thought out and realistic its narrative setting is. Throughout my experience, I kept thinking that if I was transported 50-100 years in the future, I'd be hearing about exactly these issues on the news. I particularly enjoyed how social issues and ethical decisions in technology are at the forefront of this story, in a way that is completely believable. This game is definitely a love letter to the cyberpunk genre by someone who has reflected a lot on it, and that person has my warm thanks for it.

As a game however, Technobabylon has its share of drawbacks.

In terms of atmosphere, the art is not so appealing, although the portraits during conversations are really nice. The overall art direction is functional and supports the theme. Voice acting is ok. Music fits, but is not inspiring.

The story is really great, but would be more appropriate for a book/movie. I find it loses some of its luster here because it's really convoluted. It showcases multiple protagonists, antagonists and secondary characters, goes back and forth between past and present, and jumps from one character's perspective to the next all the time. This could have worked very well if it had been delivered more gradually, but because this story only coalesces at the very end, you spend 80% of the game quite confused by it.

And this is made especially a problem because of the difficulty of the puzzles. They are not difficult in the sense of requiring great intellectual feats to solve, but rather in the sense of ""how on earth did they want me to guess I should do this sequence of things to reach this scene's not-even clearly stated objective"". Granted, I consider myself a casual in terms of point-and-click adventures, in the sense that I want the story to unfold with a good flow and the puzzles to be easy and intuitive. This is how I generally felt with Gemini Rue for example, another cyberpunk point-and-click published by Wadjet Eye. But here, in every single scene, I found myself stuck, not knowing how to advance to the next part. I had to make generous use of a walkthrough to move through the game. After reading the solutions, I often found that there was no way I could have thought about doing that, and so it reduced greatly my enjoyment and desire to even try in the next scene. The other downside of this difficulty was that all of my brainpower went into trying to solve puzzles, which made it much harder to focus on the strengths of this game: it's atmosphere and story.

To conclude, if you are a fan of cyberpunk stories, you should definitely try this game; you'll be greatly rewarded narratively for it, especially if you don't mind using a walkthrough. If you don't care for cyberpunk and are primarily a point-and-click adventure fan, there are definitely better games out there for you. I guess hardcore point-and-click fans who love difficult puzzles might enjoy it.

Technobabylon is one of these games that I bought on sales and let in my library for weeks, asking myself if I will ever play it. I finally did, and it was one of my greatest experience in point-and-click.

The one thing that makes this game GREAT is the vision of future it embraces. It isn't yet another utopia/distopia, it's a blending of plausible, mature extrapolations of nowaday's tendencies in technology and social life. You will find many things to think about, dream or fear about, in this game's vision of our future. News and secondary characters strongly participate in creating this wonderful atmosphere. 

This game acted on me like a wonderful book, when you appropriate the author's universe and make it your own, thinking about it for the rest of the day, talking about it with collegues, friends and family. If you like science fiction, you'll LOVE Technobabylon.

I'm someone who doesn't do well with games that require reaction times, coordination, or patience, so basically I don't really expect any games to be totally fulfilling to me. But shit, I guess I didn't see Technobabylon coming. I'll admit I had to refer to walkthroughs for a lot of the second half of this game, but honestly I wish I hadn't because all the puzzles are actually completely achievable if you think about them long enough (again, patience isn't a strong point for me).
All of the gameplay aspects totally hooked me right off the bat - I started this game right on the cusp of Christmas and the New Year, and I spent a lot of moments that probably should have been spent celebrating playing this game instead. I have no regrets. Awesome start to 2017. This game gave me clear skin, cured my depression and inspired me to achieve more. 

Anyway, that's before we even get to the characters. Honestly the characters in any game always make or break it for me, and in this case they totally made it. Charlie is incredibly sweet and easy to relate with, Latha is simulateously adorable and the coolest protagonist ever, and Lao is a fucking boss. This is the point where my stupidly in-depth review that noone is gonna read gets more spoilery and much more contentious, but it had a massive impact on my experience so I'm just gonna have to go there...
A large problem people seem to perceive with minority characters is this idea that they only exist for the creator to show off how 'socially aware' they are. I mostly see people who aren't part of the minority groups at hand talking about this, and honestly, the only way you could make any kind of insightful critisism of a minority character is if you ARE that minority. I know we all like to think that we can think through every puzzle in the world whether it's race or gender, but I've had to learn over a long time that it's definitely not as simple as just thinking objectively. 
As a white person in New Zealand, I do all I can to advocate against racial violence, because I'm never going to experience having my rights as a white person being subtly exploited on a grand scale, via laws implemented by other white people back when you could sell human beings. 
Any opinion I have on Lao's writing or characterisation as an East Asian character are never going to be as good or in depth as those of any given Asian person, because I just don't know what it's like to be Asian. Even just under the general title of 'transgender' I'm sure you can hear a million different feelings and interpretations on Max Lao, from people with massively different experiences and perspectives. With this in mind, that's why I roll my eyes when I see people who aren't transgender talking smack about the presence of trans characters in media. If you want to help keep damaging or stupid characterisations out of games, any of the people writing those reviews will probably give you lots of stuff to look out for (see: the trope of being outed against one's will).

WITH THAT BEING SAID. I loved Lao. I love how her backstory is revealed, I love how she is the one who CHOOSES to reveal it to Charlie on her own terms, and I love how for once I got to play a game that doesn't decide to have a protagonist who can probe the trans character with invasive or demeaning questions *cough Dragon Age Inquisition cough*. Obviously those interactions have their place, but Jesus, we get it already. There are more interesting conversations to see about a character being trans than just that. The world will not suffer for having one less game where a character gets interrogated on why she chose to be a girl. 
As anyone who's still reading has probably guessed at this point, I'm transgender myself, but I don't know what it's like to be raised as a boy and then try and carve my way from there. It's a hugely different experience and there is a lot to Lao that I honestly can't really say whether it's done right or not, I just wouldn't know. 
And I mean even aside from all this, it's really a pretty miniscule plot point, so I don't know if I missed anything but there's not really a whole lot of room FOR a problem. This makes it seem like it was a humungous part of the game and it really wasn't, as with a lot of other minority appearances, re: the interracial gay couples I've seen someone get massively upset over. As well as a robot that they claimed to be gay, with no supporting evidence. But that's none of my business. 
There's not really much I can say about the other minority appearances in this game, other than 'they were there'. It would've been a really cool opportunity to have a disabled character that wasn't a villain, but again, I don't really know much more about that - maybe we'll see that in the next installment from these guys! 

I LOVE this game. It wasn't perfect, but I definitely didn't see this review coming when I bought this game and had I known I would've happily paid more. I'm definitely going to be recommending this to people in the future, and keeping tabs on the team behind it because they were the ones who DECIDED for make such bold claims for this game, and it paid off.

The visuals are the first thing that draws my eye. It's futuristic landscape and location both in the physical world and virtual are incredibly eye catching. In this adventure you play a detective on the trail of a serial killer and a net junky who has been suffering a series of unfortunate events if you will. 

Starting off you aren't exactly sure how these two character's stories seem to connect and that's an underlying mystery as they both have missions of their own, crossing but for the most part independent of one another. The story itself while is not hard to follow does have a lot of science and a bit of technical jargon mixed in but nothing too hard to follow. Each chapter is great at giving you a piece of the bigger picture without completely confusing the player and I appreciated when I got to experience past events that helped explain our main detective's state of mind. This all leads to a natural progressions of things and events that come together so smoothly. When you have that ""aha"" moment it just fits and everything makes sense. 

As with most adventure games you have your fair share of puzzles. The beginning is where I was most frustrated because it confused me how I would take a physical object into the internet realm but after that initial segment puzzles were a bit easier. They required a bit of thinking. A lot of moving my mouse over random stuff to see if I could click it and a lot of paying attention to my surroundings and conversations. There's various puzzles in each chapter and usually you're putting your detective skills to good use. I found the final set of puzzles particularly clever and fun to figure out because you had to utilize all 3 characters to solve it. 

This game by far has the best representation of online interactions, even a torturous little mini-game by the name of Gravball, which happens to be human Pong. I must have spent the better part of half an hour trying to beat the computer legit. Even with the game being linear I never felt like I was stuck in an area for too long. Things never got stale or boring. It's rare that an adventure can keep my interests straight through. And I didn't think it suffered any of the pitfalls that other games seem to possess. 

So in short you've got a beautiful, fast paced game with intelligent varied puzzles. Decent voice acting and music which never gets stale.

[list]
[*]Has a good story, explained from various points of view that inevitably cross paths, of course :)
[*]The game throws a fair challenge at you and doesn't give too many hints. I felt that it was balanced just right.
[*]Great cyberpunk theme, being slightly ahead of us but not thousands of years.
[*]Great voice acting by various characters. 
[*]Branching choices, and multiple endings

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]The graphics. Don't get me wrong, I love nostalgic pixel graphics, but the game initially ran at a 640x800 resolution and after bumping that up the sprites became so awful I decided to scale back down, but that didnt look so great either. Not acceptable for a game of this day and age.
[*]The whole game's universe doesn't explain itself well enough sometimes. With various technical jargon thrown in between it just gets a little confusing sometimes. This also goes for the mainstoryline - Though it was good, I sometimes had the idea that I was missing things.

... immersing you in a big universe, 
... telling an interesting, twisting story,
... offering a lot of riddle and storytelling gameplay.

What was the best for me: This world is full of things to discover. Basically in every scene you get hints about bigger things going on outside of the actual story. This universe is full, complex, seducive.

As in ""Germini Rue"", the story is serious, grown-up and complex ... with separate storylines getting entagled. The concern then is (and it is not fully ruled out) that not all details of the storylines add up or are fully covered. But this times, in the last chapter, they do a lot to add one and one together and to explain the big plot governing all the separate stories. 

And here, in this last chapter, is my single point of critic about the storytelling: They do too much! If you want you can get expansive explanations by three or more characters. For one, if you really go through all the dialouges then, the final loses its pacing (so much time for talk when danger is imminent?). And secondly, not all of the dialouge options then add up in a sensible order.
But that is a bit ""splitting hairs"". The story is good! I enjoyed my hours in the city of Newton, in the year 2087.",1481833318,1481833347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A game that many people call one of the best new adventure games.  It's really not.  It's very nostalgic and a great call back to the adventure games of the past, but that's where it belongs in the past and not now.  First off, this horrendous pixel style needs to stop.  It's bad, real bad.  It looks ugly, trying to copy the pixel graphic style of games older than Kings Quest 5 is just not something I want to see.  I assume some people do, but I have no idea why.  At worst it should have the clean visual style of the Moneky Island remasters games.  I know this studio loves their pixel graphics, but harenking back to the terrible graphics of the past is not the way to go. 

You play the game as 3 different characters.  A senior detective on the police force, who is kind of this old curmudgen who hates technology and dislikes the direction the future has taken (also he is from Texas...apparently in the future Texans have no accents).  His partner, a young female detective who is a computer expert and is very much on board with the direction the future has taken and all set to accept her AI overlords.  Finally, a young female hacker, who is addicted to the internet and spends her entire life in the internet...hacking?  Of these three i liked the female detective the most and really just wanted to play the game as her the whole time, which is unfortunate because she probably has the least amount of time in the game. 

On the up side this game is far better than Gemini Rue.  The voice acting is better, the puzzles are better, the environments are better.  I really thought the voice actors did a fine job, certainly not the best job, but a fine job.  The puzzles are a lot less pixel hunty than Gemini Rue which is great.  However, the puzzles also aren't very good. They certainly don't take a lot to figure out.  I only found myself stuck on the very last puzzle in the game which involved a wrench and I had to eventually just give up.  I'm pretty confident i would never have figured it out as it required me to do something that I didn't even think was possible.  The rest of the puzzles are mainly easy, because their are very few items in the environment to click on, so most of the time i was just stumbling into solutions without even thinking.

Really, though I can forgive basically anything so long as the story is good, which is also where this game fails the most.[spoiler] I certainly like the world the game created.  This idea that after countless wars cities start to use AI to govern and administer is intriquing.  A wonderful cyberpunk setting.  Sadly, i thought i was getting a detective story in this setting, what I got was kind of a mishmash government conspiracy story and although you are a detective the story really just flows without you doing much detecting.  Oh sure the plot makes your main character out to be one of the best detectives...which is nonsensical considering you are also the greatest scientist...who i guess felt a career change to detective was a better choice?  It doesn't make any sense.  The plot moves along with your detecting mainly being stumbling into situation after situation without ever really figuring out or discovering anything.  I figured out who was behind the murders in the first hour of the game, but not due to any clues, simply because they came off as super evil and there were no other characters in the game.  The motive is revealed in an info dump near the end of the game...but you never had any clues to figure it out beforehand.  I find these types of mysteries maddening.  It shows a great lack of ability in the writing, they don't understand how to lay out a trail of clues or introduce nuance.  They just tell you the story as you go introducing one rediculous reveal after another.  

The final reveal that the AI is basically your child, and the person behind the murders is also your child, and the internet addict is also your child is just obnoxious.  Although I did enjoy my ending that the AI wants to govern the world to be a very fun cyberpunk ending.  Also because i found the AI the most likeable character in the game, i think the writers wanted the AI to come off as worrisome if not evil, but the whole game i was like man people should just do what this AI tells them it's master plan is clearly the best.  [/spoiler]

So yea, that's Technobabylon, another mediocre adventure game from the studio dedicated to making classic nostalgia adventure games.  Sigh, I feel if they just embraced the modern developments and story telling techniques games like Life is Strange have made they might be able to accomplish something very special, but instead they like to just lie back and copy what has already been done and like the main character in this game they shall always be stuck in the past.  Still, I enjoyed my time with it, just get it on massive sale, or you know just buy Life is Strange the best adventure game ever made.

The story is tight and paced well, the characters are engaging and well written and the puzzles blend into the plot with general seemlessness.

Not everyone will be on board with the pixel art style and AGS engine (which is frankly starting to show its age even in 'faux-retro' titles like this) but it's hard to complain about stuff like that when it suits the storytelling style so well and there's obviously so much love put into these environments and characters; it's really remarkable what the developers have done within the constraints of the tools they're working with.

I found the difficulty of the puzzles somewhat on the easy side and there was never a point where I had to reach for a walkthrough, but then I'm a genre-veteran. The game pretty sucessfully (and organically) limits inventory and number of spaces to explore, and the characters around you are usually dropping subtle hints in dialouge as to how to proceed which keeps things moving. There's more than one way to solve a number of the challenges too which is a nice touch.

So, if you're looking for something that'll keep you busy for 10-15 hours and maybe spark off a few neurons as you wonder where technology is taking us as a species then you could do a lot worse than take a trip to Newtown in 2087. I feel there's a lot more exploring to be done in this world and I'd love to spend more time with these characters too... sequel? Please? 

On a side note, I'd like to give this game extra-special props for being one of the few games (or pieces of media period) to do representation of minorities in a really great way; two of the PCs are female non-caucasians and a major character is trans. The game and dialouge never hammer any of these points or use them as cheap ways to stir controversy and all come across as individuals.

My old review:
I love adventure games, but sadly I found this particular title to be extremely slow, hampered by a clunky UI and full of unintuitive, frustrating puzzles. I had to give up after a few hours because of the number of times I needed to consult a walkthrough for puzzle solutions that were essentially just trial and error. The concept is strong and the writing is largely very good, I just found the gameplay itself to be lacking.",1480436149,1487117289,True,0,0,0.499826788902282715,4,True,False,False,False,,,

All of the puzzles are SMART. Not just ""click random thing on random other things until stuff happens"". You can actually THINK about the puzzles, think about what could actually solve them, then work towards those solutions, making for satisfying gameplay!

The characters are also smart! They're different, wrong sometimes, make mistakes, but they actually try to think and understand what is going on. I enjoyed all of the protagonists.

I'm happy to say that every time I got stumped on a puzzle (with one minor exception, mentioned below), it wasn't because the solution was bizarre or counter-intuitive, it was just that I hadn't thought about the actual facts of puzzle the right way.

The major downside is the ending (spoilers).

A minor flaw is it sloppily scripted (lots of weird bugs that you can cause, nothing game-breaking but obviously not been through thorough QA, like the door lock lights disappearing (not turning off - literally disappearing) after you go through the door and return, or Lao being able to hand her wetware to Regis but not get it back).

It's also unclear that there is an entire third floor in the Trance, making the final part of the puzzle a matter of luck or blind guesswork.

But the big part is the endings are unsatisfying. Either you force a person into slavery, or you force them into being someone else's agenda and to go through an invasive mind-altering procedure without their input. I would have been much happier if there was a third option, where you can actually respect the autonomy of the AGI and let it free without compulsion.

Le meilleur du cyberpunk et du pixel art, les panoramas les plus dingues et quelques tableaux esthétiquement très ambitieux réussiraient presque à nous faire oublier les autres décors ratés, le banal et le cradingue. Un bon quart du jeu se passe d'ailleurs dans une simulation informatique qui nous est décrite comme un deuxième monde fascinant, un Eden de gigaoctets, un univers parallèle fantastique dans lequel des millions d'utilisateurs gâchent leur vie. Un paradis virtuel auquel on a du mal à croire : desservi par des idées vusuelles datées, ce [i]web 3.0[/i] fait peine à voir avec son interface désespérément vide et ses allures de Minitel sous VR.

Le scénario n'est pas si emballant que ça non plus. Le stylo est un peu trop lourd, l'écriture un poil trop facile pour nous surprendre. Technobabylon exagère des rebondissements glauques pour avoir l'air cool ; ses théories correspondent si bien aux peurs dictées par les meilleurs romans d'anticipation qu'il n'a rien trouvé de mieux que de les dépasser dans l'excès pour s'en distinguer ; Technobabylon oublie d'être autre chose qu'un Game of Thrones du futur, une oeuvre qui, à force de vouloir nous montrer à quel point elle peut être sombre, donne l'impression de n'être qu'un adolescent un peu intelligent qui montre à tout-va des captures d'écran du [i]deep web[/i] pour impressionner ses camarades de classe, un récit immature qui ne cherche à choquer que pour choquer. C'est pourtant au milieu de cette débauche souvent inutile que Technobabylon est paradoxalement le plus intéressant : cette vision [i]forcément![/i] dystopique du lendemain a le mérite de confronter les élans d'aujourd'hui aux chutes qui les attendent, met le doigt sinon sur les excès, sur la dynamique de notre société qui ne cherche à violer ses tabous que pour le simple plaisir de se féliciter d'avoir pu le faire. Les justifications morales qui nous encombraient disparaissent, la bêtise et l'égoïsme peuvent briller de tout leur éclat. Comme dans un concours de pipi télévisé où on jubile jaune d'être regardé par le monde entier, la seule satisfaction est d'être allé plus loin que les autres.

Technobabylon n'est pas un bon thriller ; il raconte une enquête dont on comprend les aboutissants trop vite. Mais il est un bon point & click aux énigmes logiques quoi qu'un brin inattendues. Divisée en dix actes, l'aventure claque et verrouille chacune des portes que l'on vient de traverser ; impossible de revenir sur les tableaux des chapitres précédents. L'aire de jeu (et donc des puzzles) est limitée et évite ainsi les écueils d'une progression labyrinthique. Les rares énigmes farfelues sont compensées par cette progression parfaitement délimitée. Parce qu'il nous pousse toujours en avant, Technobabylon est un chemin sans impasses.

Technobabylon est parfois maladroit, souvent trop absolu. Mais il n'est avare de rien ; le background est documenté, le gameplay tire profit des trois héros à incarner, tous les dialogues sont doublés et le sont très bien - si on accepte d'oublier un personnage français qui ne sait pas parler français. C'est une histoire aux grosses ficelles qui arrive quand même à être touchante ; c'est un récit bavard qui dit tout ce qui lui passe par la tête, une aventure qui a beaucoup de choses à montrer et à suggérer. Les conséquences d'un monde où les enfants ne s'amusent qu'à dépasser les lignes rouges tracées par leurs parents. L'une des destinations potentielles d'une logique qui veut aller toujours plus loin, toujours plus haut, toujours plus vite. L'accident possible d'une civilisation, comme ce train sur le point de dérailler ou cet atlhlète aveugle qui fonce à toute allure dans une vierge de fer. Un jeu qui fait déjà passer les végétaliens et les [i]genderfluids[/i] pour des vieux réactionnaires.

The mechanics were good enough, though, so I figured I'd give Technobabylon a go since it had a similar ""look"" to it in terms of having the appearance of a '90s adventure game. When the game loaded, I saw that the same publisher made the game, and I immediately felt my heart sink, because Kathy Rain put me out so badly, and when Technobabylon started, its gameplay mechanics were obviously not as streamlined as Kathy Rain's, having less interaction options, less stuff to interact with on each screen, less mandatory dialog, and interactive stuff did not show on the screen when pushing a button like in Kathy Rain (spacebar). Technobabylon was going to be a techno-turd...or so I thought.

Instead, I found a game with far more relevant characters, likable characters (for me, at least), legitimate antagonists (screw you, Crimson Man from Kathy Rain!), and a story and world that were quite intriguing. It's a cyberpunk setting where a large city has had an AI put in charge of all of its civil services, and a couple of your characters you control are officers of the law, who report to the AI, dealing with manhunts, homicide, etc. The guy has a nice character arc, the gal is just plain likable, and another female you play as gives you the impression in her first 30 seconds of self-narrated introduction that she's going to be one thing, then you really see what's going on right after and realize her opinion of herself and the reality are quite different, and makes for an interesting character.

As a cop of the world, you will be mostly dealing with physical things in the world, with a stun gun and standard adventure game puzzle-solving. However, as the one girl, you enter the ""TRANCE,"" which is basically The Matrix/TRON. Users have digital avatars and can interact online with one another. Due to the plot, you'll do very little of interacting with other users, except at one point in the game. Most of the time, however, you will be rubbing blue gel on machines to establish a connection between them and you, letting you interact with comical artificial intelligences to try to resolve problems that would otherwise be impossible for her to overcome in the real world. It's a nice spin to have the game change things up in this fashion.

The introductions of characters are informative and there are a fair number of surprises in terms of certain characters showing up again who seemed like a one-time thing, much to my delight. My favorite character was practically a gag character, but was in the game sporadically until the end. No amazing villains, but they're pretty decent; one's a bit of an eye-roll-inducer (for me, anyway). This world is just pretty cool. It ""borrows"" a lot from stuff like TRON/The Matrix/Shadowrun (a character even calls the real world the ""meatspace,"" but it still felt like an original story, with plenty of dressing of things that weren't crucial to the main plot but did wonders for world-building. 

The puzzles made me think much of the time, though there were times I was clicking on things at random if I got stuck. I managed to avoid using a walkthrough except ONE time. It was literally the final puzzle I had left to solve in the game (involved some glowing lights on a wall that I couldn't find). The difficulty of the game was nice and had less rage-inducing puzzles than Kathy Rain did, and it didn't feel so ""anal"" as Kathy rain in regard to having to go through every piece of dialog to proceed (though I did because the world, story, and characters interested me).

I would love to see more games in this world, but in different cities and with new and returning characeters. Heck, I'll just admit it: I loved Cheffie. I think we're suppose to hate her or be annoyed by her, but man was she fun for me. Anywho, I think sequels or prequels set in different parts of the world not strongly connected to each storyline could be excellent, and I would love to see them get made.

On pourrait résumer ainsi ce qu'est Technobabylon mais on passerait alors à côté de cette perle vidéoludique méconnue d'une grande majorité de gamers ! Je dois avouer que j'ai été bluffé par ce jeu indépendant qui est tout bonnement magnifique ! :D

Tout d'abord, l'histoire du jeu est très soignée et le background des personnages permet une immersion en tout points dans l'univers de Technobabylon ! Vous incarnez successivement Latha, une enfant des rues devenue accro à la réalité virtuelle que l'on peut qualifier de ""Thrall"" c'est-à-dire qui passe toute sa vie connectée (elle ne se déconnecte que pour s'alimenter ou lorsque le réseau, le ""Trance"" est en panne), le Dr Regis qui est un agent du CEL (une police criminelle de pointe si vous préférez) ainsi que Max Lao, hackeuse de génie / ancienne criminelle repentie, désormais elle est la partenaire du Dr Régis.

Il faut noter que le jeu est en anglais, il faut donc maîtriser la langue de Shakespeare si vous désirez vivre pleinement l'expérience humaine et philosophique que vous propose Technobabylon ! ;-)

Les graphismes ainsi que la direction artistique sont très soignées et nous font vite oublier que nous avons affaire à du pixel-art, les dialogues favorisent également le sentiment d'immersion que j'évoquais tout à l'heure avec un scénario riche en rebondissements !

Point très important : le gameplay ; celui-ci est très fourni et suffisamment varié pour que l'on ne s'ennuie pas !
Vous pourrez ainsi mener une investigation sur une scène de crime toute fraîche qui s'enchaîne avec une course poursuite parsemée d'obstacles qui sont autant de puzzles à résoudre ! Vous pourrez aussi participer à une sorte de cluedo grandeur nature bref je n'en dis pas plus par peur de vous spoiler ! :-)
Cependant, je dois reconnaître que parfois certains passages sont plus ardus que d'autres et nécessitent soit un sens de l'observation très développé soit l'utilisation d'un guide pour se débloquer d'un petit casse-tête où l'on reste plusieurs minutes bloqué alors qu'une simple succession de quelques actions suffit à avancer dans le chapitre !
Encore une fois, je ne trouve pas que c'est un problème puisque les puzzles restent très cohérents et logiques contrairement à d'autres jeux point and click et qu'un excellent guide existe à ce sujet qui vous permettra d'avancer sans craintes de vous faire spoiler ! :D

Enfin, le rapport qualité prix est excellent étant donné que le jeu est souvent en soldes et qu'il possède cartes à échanger et succès steam !

Je le recommande donc vivement à tous !

It *gets* cyberpunk and develops it with an understanding of existing technology, developments on the cusp of existence, and the way states and capital shape how that technology affects our lives. Rather than trying to spin virtual reality as some barely imagined new concept like William Gibson never existed, Technobabylon looks at biotech, AI development, and automation to flesh out a world that feels incredibly plausible and compelling.

Puzzle systems are never insanely ""out there,"" but there are fun applications of some mechanics. The AI Splitter that lets you dismantle and rebuild AI minds with different pieces of each other really stands out as one of the more fun ones.

O trabalho de dublagem do jogo é uma obra-prima e as vozes e atuações dos dubladores não sairão da minha cabeça tão cedo.

The puzzle part of the game was good, but not all too good, sometimes very unintuitive and obviously ""scripted"". Of course that is my personal opinion, if you view it from a game design perspective, then they are what they have to be, I guess. Still pretty funny at times.

Buy this game if you enjoy the following:

-Sci-fi action drama stories
-Deductive shows/games/movies
-Wonderfully well done 16bit style art.
-A challenge

This game will have you stuck sometimes for a while which I found surprising. A lot of point and click puzzle games are very straight forward or use some cheap tactics to try and throw you off. This game is very genuine. You have to think and I found myself having to take breaks instead of binging on a game because I found myself stuck on a chapter that I just couldn't piece together.

It is not bad, and the pixelated graphics give nice retro feel to the whole experience, while telling a futuristic cyberpunk story. Some of the characters were nice to follow. Some puzzles could be solved in a few ways, unlocking different achievements. Overall I kept playing this game, which is enough of a reason to say it can be enjoyable.

There always will be a 'but' at some point that changes the whole statement, right?

Well, as I said, some characters are interesting to follow. However, the story switches between three main ones, with short flashbacks where we follow side ones. The voiceover on some of them is bad, and one of the main characters sounds so awfully unnatural I was at some point considering quitting the otherwise interesting plot.

The switching between MCs points of view is probably intended to show variety of classic cyberpunk landscapes. Expensive apartments, rundown basements, abandoned factories, sprinkly-clean laboratories, neon skyscrapers etc etc., all the while mentioning stuff that cyberpunk is most known for. Global corporations, cloning, gen. engineering, all-powerful AI, androids, cyborgs, virtual reality, loss of identity, background brutal warfare etc. Nothing of that sounds particularly new. There are some new, sometimes amusing ideas, but they are wasted with overwhelming majority of the usual.

The animation. oh boy. Pixelated graphics have their appeal, which i personally enjoy, yet they are so badly animated for some characters, you'd think this game is not really retro, but 20 years old. Maybe that's the idea. I wouldn't mind, but while all character's close-up portraits are nice, as are most sceneries and animations, some fail horribly. Two of the MCs look like they were made with MS Paint. Graphics range from eye-catching to blocky gibberish pixelgore.


Okay, I am proud of you if you managed to read it up to this point. So I'll just make my opinion short: don't buy this game for full price, it's not worth if you're into indie retro ones.

Patrząc na listę ukończonych przez mnie gier, muszę powiedzieć, że obok Dzikiego Gonu jest to najlepsza gra w jaką grałem w 2016 i udało się jej pobić kilka tytułów klasy AAA.

Złożyło się na to kilka czynników. Jest to gra ze zdecydowanie najlepszym scenariuszem (tak, lepszym niż Wiedźmin), który jest wprost fenomenalny. Writing dorównuje najlepszym powieściom sci-fi, a setting to esencja cyberpunku z zakręconymi, szokującymi, ale i w całkiem realnymi pomysłami - jeśli ekstrapolujemy obecny stan nauki i wyobrazimy sobie co mogłoby być za ponad dwieście lat. Nie chcę niczego spoilować, najlepiej samemu zagrać. Świat przedstawiony jest spójny i interesujący, przez całą grę dowiadujemy się czegoś nowego i poznajemy kolejne smaczki. Miłym dodatkiem są newsy, które zmieniają się podczas gry.

Zagadki są logiczne, nie ma łączenia małpy z batyskafem, wszystko ma sens i działa tak jak się tego spodziewamy. Zaciąłem się trzy razy na chwilę, ale nigdy na tyle, żeby sięgnąć po solucję. Gameplayowo jest to również jedna z lepszych przygodówek w jakie grałem. Zdecydowanie najwyższa półka. Co ciekawe, gra posiada po kilka rozwiązań do niektórych zagadek, przez co zawiera pewną dozę nieliniowości - rzecz raczej niespotykana w przygodówkach point & click.

Na uwagę zasługuje świetne udźwiękowienie - zarówno muzyka jak i odgłosy - ale przede wszystkim - rewelacyjny voice acting, w niczym nie ustępujący największym produkcjom, a niektóre wręcz przebijający o kilka długości. W całej grze nie ma ani jednego niepasującego głosu, czy aktora czytającego z kartki. Takich bajerów się nie spodziewałem po grze stworzonej w Adventure Game Studio.

Grafika, mimo wszechobecnej pikselozy i niskiej rozdzielczości, jest ładna.

I haven't played a point-and-click adventure game in quite a while, but this was a good foray back into that territory.  The setting and writing was very enjoyable, the art excellent, and the music immersive.  But the main point of this kind of adventure is exploring the story, which requires a good story to be a good game.  Technobabylon doesn't disappoint me here.

As someone interested in the virtual, metaverses, etc, I was on board immediately with the concept that the Trance provided, and other sci-fi concepts (such as gengineering) had enough grounding in modern science to give a bit of a ""This could be the future"" edge.  But it's not all dark, gritty, and brooding.  There is a LOT of dialog to explore, and there were quite a few moments I laughed out loud, mostly due to AI personalities (Turret + Cheffie = absolutely hilarious)

The puzzles were largely simple for me to figure out, and the only places I got stuck and had to look online for help were when I was missing something entirely -- it's not so bad you could call it pixel-hunting, but you still need to be thorough if you find yourself getting stuck.  Death is handled in a forgiving manner, simply rewinding back to a state just before you died if you did something foolish.

I ended up playing through this twice -- the second time with commentary and to pick up 100% achievements -- and I bought a copy for my sister and recommended it to a friend.  I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys point-and-click adventure types, cyberpunk settings, and have a taste for automeals served by an AI so cheerful it should be criminal.

Overall play time for both runs was ~20 hours for me. Given my second run was much faster, I'd say you're probably looking at a 10 to 15 hour experience. That may not seem like much, but it was a very enjoyable time, and I've put more hours into games and got less out of them in the past, so I'd say it was worth it.

My all time favorite genre is Cyberpunk, and there aren't that many Cyberpunk games out there. I have played most of them and some of them stuck in my mind, others disappeared quickly. Technobabylon is one of those games who have stuck in my mind.
The setting of the game is perfect, a dystopian large city controlled by some big force, and lots of high tech (hence the perfect quote ""High Tech, Low Life""). The characters are very likeable and interesting, and the story is great as well.

It took me around 9 hours to finish the game, and I took my time interacting with everything and getting stuck on difficult puzzles.

[b]Publisher:[/b]  Wadjet Eye Games
[b]Genre:[/b]  2D adventure

[h1]General Impression[/h1]
While I’m no self proclaimed fan of pixel graphics in modern video games, there was something that drew me towards Technobablylon. Perhaps it was the fusion between cyberpunk and neo-noir genres and the similarities I could observe between this game and one of my favorite movies of all time, Blade Runner. Technobabylon has an intriguing plot of its own, which I won’t spoil but I can assure it that it is quite original and this time, you’re actually getting your money’s worth. There were a few instances which required that you return to a previously “swept” area and use the newly acquired itmes in your inventory. I’m not a fan of backtracking in general but at least there weren’t many such situations. The point & click interface runs smoothly but it took some tinkering with the game’s graphical settings before I was satisfied with the result and the dialogue font is a bit pixeated for my taste but it wasn’t that much of a strain. On the other hand, the  soundtrack truly stands out and the many commentaries (on each scene and on some interactions) from the developer and publisher, reveled just how important this project has been to them. I respect that. All in all, you’re in for a decently lengthy adventure, should you choose to give Technobabylon a try. It really has few flaws and I hope we may see a sequel to it one day.

[h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Excellent storyline.
+ Beautiful art style and tech-noir setting.
+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.
+ In-game commentaries from the dev team.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- Some puzzles involve backtracking to a previous scene.

Дух киберпанка передан  блестяще, но к сожалению ближе к развязке сюжет начинает плыть: если вы знакомы «Нейромантом» Гибсона, то во второй половине игры вас начинает преследовать чувство, что вы  это уже где-то видели. В итоге, вместо заимствований у Гибсона, игра начинает  бесстыдно копировать целые куски и сюжетные повороты из книги, что не является преступлением, но на оригинальность не тянет. 

При этом, игра умудряется сохранить индивидуальность во многом благодаря атмосфере и персонажам. Герои получились сложными и интересными. Один из них на протяжении большей части игры не вызывал у меня ничего кроме отвращения и раздражения, пока я не понял, что наркоман в ломке и не может быть обаятельным и интересным. Другой оказался... не совсем тем, чем казался (ох, без спойлеров не просто) и это привело... к интересной динамике в отношениях между главными героями. 

Графика, как это и свойственно проектам от Wadjet Eye выполнена крупным пикселем и выглядит здорово, хотя текст читается с трудом. С художественной точки зрения дизайн выдержан бесподобно- высокие, холодные небоскребы, яркие неоновые вывески, вечная ночь, все на месте. 

Загадки тоже принадлежат к старой школе и не отличаются логичностью и простотой. В этом, пожалуй, заключается одна из главных проблем игры: головоломки не работают на сюжет и не продвигают историю, а скорее служат препятствием, лишь преодолев которое, удаётся вернуться к повествованию.

Con:
- Keine Hotspotanzeige
- Technisch etwas zickig, Steamoverlay und Alt+Tab machen gern mal Probleme
- Keine deutschen Texte

Pro:
- Mir gefallen die Sprecher
- Story interessant von Anfang bis Ende mit mindestens zwei möglichen Enden
- An manchen Stellen alternative Lösungswege
- Interessante Rätsel, die aber nicht allzu schwierig sind

Fazit:
Ich hatte sieben schöne Stunden mit dem Spiel. Da ich zu Ungeduld neige, klicke ich die Dialoge ganz gern mal durch, weil ich schneller lese, als die Charaktere reden. Wenn man das komplett auf sich wirken lässt, wird das Spiel nochmal ein Weilchen länger dauern.
Außerdem muss ich dazu sagen, dass ich ab und zu mal in einen Walkthrough geguckt habe, weil ich aufm Schlauch stehe und ich dann oft nicht das Bedürfnis habe wahllos Dinge zu kombinieren und ohne die Hotspotanzeige alles pixelweise abzusuchen. Das hat meinem Spaß aber keinen Abbruch getan.

The main pros: 
• The story is great. An immense amount of thought went into background details about the universe. I feel like I know things about the place that these characters live.
• The voice acting is well done.
• The characters are likeable, but flawed. They're human-like.
• Most of the puzzles are intuitive and well-considered. They often offer multiple approaches.
• The sci-fi science is believable-- and chilling.

The main cons:
• The game often tries to put the characters in urgent situations that would demand immediate action, then asks you to solve a multi-room puzzle that involves backtracking across the map. Pacing is entierly thrown out the window.
• The art style of the characters is dramatically different from the enviornments. And a lot rougher. The result is a disconnect between the actors and the scene.
• A fair few of the puzzles rely on obscure 'find the hidden object' solutions. Not all of them-- but more than enough to distinctly annoy you.",1477618548,1477770867,True,6,1,0.589066863059997559,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's really fun. I'm really bad at point and clicks but even I had fun with the puzzle even though I had to look up a walkthrough for one part. But the thing that strikes me most is the humour and how it uses the most of this cyberpunk setting with overly emotional robots that seem human at one point but in a second make you remember that they are controlled by a company. Well really everything is owned by a country, and that's why right now it feels so dystopian. And I hope it keeps with this ambience and setting; because while these types of game has been done millions of time before, this feels different as it has real details in the world - details that you notice and recognise.

Pros:
-Great voice acting

-Puzzle difficulty seems balanced

I don't much care for puzzles in point and click games – some people call them illogical, some absurd, some charmingly crazy. For me they're fun, although, in this particular case, I had to peek into a walkthrough a couple of times because I've missed some almost-pixel-size items. The point is – gameplay contains everything you would expect from this genre. And it's OK.

My reservation concern the most important element of the game – the story. There are no good characters in „Technobabylon”. By good I mean morally good, not well written. There is a struggle at the top of the food chain between overly controlling cyberpunky-antiutopian AI and a bunch of plutocrats/oligarchs. We see debauchery, hypocrisy, hubris and greed all around. Even our protagonists aren't really characters to root for. One of them is an internet junkie (or, to be precise, trance junkie, futuristic VR version of the internet), who's addicted to information stream, bright colour-flickering images bombarding senses, for whom real world is too slow and too demanding; other one being an ex-bioengineer who used to make suicide bombers, a pro-eugenics scientist, shady (at best) in bioethics field, now a good ol' grumpy cop.

I was getting further and further into the story, yet getting more and more impatient that there is no person in the game's world who I wanted to succeed. And then it hit me. It's exactly how it supposed to be. After all the title of the game is „TechnoBABYLON” – it's supposed to be a moral depravity feast. But the plot missed something, something crucial for this type of story. It missed it's „idiot”, it's good guy, it's Shatov (Comparing „Technobabylon” to Dostoyevsky is unfair, but his works, in this case especially „Demons”, are a good example of stories exploring demoralized circles).

I understand that the creators' vision is a depressing one. But do I need to spend a few hours watching multitude of ways in which humans can be bad? I know they can be evil, I'm one of them. The game shows a world filled with decadence, but I may as well look out the window. And may even be surprised what I'll found. Even if you think that goodness can't prevail or is naive – show it. Create a character like Simon from „Lord of the Flies” and show him fail. You can argue that our main heroes are trying to do some good, but actually they're just trying to get out of trouble they got in during the course of the plot (still, Regis is getting „redemption arc” at the very end).

If you just want to relax after a day of hard work, you'll be satisfied. Characters are likeable, pacing is all right and pixel-arty environments are quite pretty. My problem is, that beyond that the game touches an interesting topic –  bioethics – but doesn't have anything clever to say about it.",1468530247,1468530247,False,15,0,0.47706139087677002,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Zum Spiel.
Man spielt 2 Polizisten und eine Süchtige in einer hochtenologischen Welt, in der Genmaipulation zum Standard gehört. Als neue Droge gibt es Trance, eine virtuelle Welt in der man jemand ist.
Die Stadt wird von einer KI überwacht die alles und jeden kontrolliert. Zuviel verraten wäre blöd, aber es geht um Mord und Verschwörungen.

Rätsel:
Wirklich ein angenehmer Schwierigkeitsgrad, hat mir gut gefallen. es gab teilweise mehre Wege zum Ziel. Wobei die Rätsel nie unfair waren. Wie bei jedem Adventure einfach rumprobieren.

Grafik:
Wadjet Eye Stil, kein Unterschied zu anderen Spiele des Publishers. Wobei mir das Zukunftsszenario wirklich gut gefällt.
Ähnlich wie Gemini Rue oder Blade Runner.

Sound:
Sehr gute Sprachausgabe und gute Sound- sowie Musikeffekte. Man erkennt mitlerweile die üblichen Sprecher die Wadjet Eye einsetzt, z.B. Abe Goldfarb. Leider hat das Spiel keine deutsche Sprachausgabe oder Untertitel. Der Hintergrund ist einfach der Markt für Adventures, die Kosten einer Synchronisation sowie der Kosten/Nutzen-Faktor.

The multi-plot narration - done with very competent voice-acting for all dialogue- keeps players engaged with interesting, deep characters and some nicely staged twists (though admittedly some are not as twisty as the writers obviously thought them to be).
The puzzles are exceptionally well done, notwithstanding one or two lesser specimen. No spoilers here, but should you get stuck in a kitchen, you'll know what I mean.

This part of this game that sets it apart from others is a VERY well realized semi-near futuristic setting, similar to Ghost in the Shell in its focus on the internet (and opting to go the route of nanomachines rather than cybernetics).  A lot of its dystopian themes seem very plausibly real and dont stray too much into the realm of science fantasy to break my suspension of disbelief.  Add on top of that some very well acted characters (Charlie and Max specifically) and villains, a heavy plot that balances itself very well without overdoing it, and you have a great game.  

There is also a nuanced influence of dialogue choices that impact the game's responses and dialogue without going the route of being an aparrent and forced good-neutral-bad ending choice factor, while still feeling relevant to the story.  I liked it.  If there's anything I disliked, its that Latha's character felt too one dimensional and tangential to the rest of the story, and that her specific sections involving using the web were lacking a robust realization like the rest of the setting.  I forgive them though, since most all other stories in the near-future scifi genre haven't come up with a really robust way to depict a brain-to-machine immersive version of the internet.

Puzzles and mechanics-wise, the game is solid.  As always there is 'that one puzzle' that necessitates a guide, but that is always true of the genre and is not something I look down upon.  There are failstates, but only in a few specific points of the game.  Be warned, some of the scenes in the game can be particularly gruesome and unpleasant to watch (namely the flashback scene with [spoiler]the maidservant gynoid violently disembowling its hallucinating owner after he kills his spouse[/spoiler]), but they are treated with severity and not present to glorify the gruesomeness of the act.

I've also often found that people are easily impressed by mediocre fare in just about anything, so me saying something is ""passable"" could mean it's the best thing you've ever seen in your life. That really depends on what you're used to more than anything. Having said that:

The episodic format shows.The game kind-sort-of felt as if it wasn't made as a cohesive whole, and that individual ""episodes""  were too ""tight"" to really let you soak in the atmosphere. Which is a shame, as there was plenty of atmosphere, and the individual epizodes were rather good overall.

However, it did feet like it was going out of it's way to put the player in one ""room escape"" scenario after another. The overall plot was a bit too grand which made various things feel a bit too drastic. It seems to have elements in place, so to speak, for large multi-plot games like, say, Discworld: Noir, but it turns out to not really be that kind of game. I guess the plot feels strangely linear, because the game has the old style grapics groove going on, but lacks a central semi-non-linear ""open world"" item chase chapter that's a staple of the old non-episodic classics. Making one of those is a nightmare, and it would've made the game twice as long, but the game felt like it needed more time to develop it's various characters, and more space to disperse it's dialogue, world-building and commentary in. For a game which makes dialogue so fun and easy to perform and enjoy, it doesn't really do enough with the dialogue because secondary characters are either villains or only there for one scene.

For example, I feel the ""comm"" feature was an incredible idea, one that's probably been kicking around many point-and-click and detective game enthusiasts heads. Except it's hardly ever used in the most obvious way it would be used in most games - to cut the time it takes to walk around various locations when you just want to talk to a character. I can think of dozens of games which  that feature would've made much better than they were (many of them are classics). In this game it's usability is severely limited because the game lacks that central faux open-world part. Big props to to the person who went and put that into their game, finally, as it might influence someone else to put it in a game that makes more use out of it. Heck, you could take all the shooty / RPG bits out of Fallout 2, rewrite it as a straight point-and-click / dialogue thing, add that feature to the radio so that you can contact folks over distance, and you'd be rolling in money.

Which is to say there's some really good stuff here. The android related puzzles were impossibly cool, the actual ""investigation"" episode was also very cool, there's great stuff all over the place. But there are also a few too many instances of characters being able to perform certain actions without the actions making sense at the time. I think I just stumbled onto the solutions to many puzzles, and at times I was stuck because I didn't realize certain actions could even be performed, so I would be lacking a step in an otherwise logical sequence of moves. This might mean that a few things had a step-or-two too many, and for this, I blame the episodic format again - if actions required to accomplish something didn't have to all involve so discreet scenations the flow would be much better.

I've heard complaints about the graphics from folks who can't appreciate symbolic art over ""realism"". I've mixed feelings about it. I'm not necessarily in love with the pixels, as I found the recent remasterings of Lucas Arts stuff quite fine, and I did at times feel like this game could've benefited from a bit more resolution. I'm not sure it would have benefitted from more ""realism"" which that would end up creating - the gory bits, and there ARE gory bits, would've stood out more, and the naive bits, and there ARE naive bits, would have stood out more, too. Since pacing makes certain plot related things a bit jarring, more detailed graphics wouldn't have necessarily helped there. Plus, quite a bunch of the art is gorgeous as is.

Now, most of this soounds like criticism, but when you get down to it, I've not really played a more ambitious point-and-clicker that actually delivered as much as Technobabylon did in quite a while. It did more for me on the cyberpunk front than the Shadowrun games, too. I feel like the folks who made it deserve their money, and that the game isn't really dissapointing as much as it stimulates the player afterwards to think about how they would have done it better. Which is a great thing.

由于当初通关是急着写指南，测评方面就隔着，今天突然想起来才特地补上，我就简单摘要点写写吧。

[h1]优：[/h1]
+ 宏大的科幻世界观
+ 语言十分有特色，比如wetware、trance等，还有女主常说的""doom it""
+ 剧情悬念设置到位
+ 谜题难度大体适中，而且可以有不同的解法
+ 许多剧情都有可选分支，但实际上不会对结局造成太大变动
+ 对话全程语音
+ 游戏对话或场景时不时地加入中文要素使华人玩家觉得会有亲切感

[h1]劣：[/h1]
- 没有中文，部分谜题要求英文水平过硬才能解开
- 启动游戏时，有时候鼠标会悬停在画面中间，无法移动，只能关掉重开
- 在游戏进行中，切回桌面再回到游戏，Esc键会无限抽风，此时剧情对话会狂跳，要随便按个英文键才能解决这问题

总的来说，作为一款科幻解谜冒险游戏，Technobabylon在游戏性及解谜上并没有太大的瑕疵，而在剧情上，我觉得还有待提高，悬念的设置不如Gemini Rue给我带来的震撼要大。
只可惜因为语言问题，可能大部分中国玩家都与[url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Wadjet%20Eye%20Games]Wadjet Eye Games[/url]的解谜游戏无缘。

另外这个厂的节操很硬，这游戏去年上架，但史低折扣也就五折，其他游戏入包都比较久远，不过有几个游戏上个月倒是进过豆团的慈善包。等夏促对这游戏感兴趣的可以尝试一下（有个Demo也可以试玩一下）。

I did have a few gripes with the game: in particular, some of the lines recorded for Max sounded very differently from the rest and the pixel-art style is less than perfect on a few occasions - seeing ""half pixel"" lines was kind of jarring, and there's a loose plot thread - unfortunately, one rather relevant to the plot (we never really find out why [spoiler]both clones[/spoiler] were created). The game includes an autosave on the start of each chapter, which turned out quite handy in when I ended up in what's probably the only dead-end situation in the game (no way to progress without interacting with an item you can't backtrack to [spoiler]when you climb outside the airship[/spoiler]).

The limited amount of objects you can interact with in the game's locations has both upsides and downsides - in the 90's adventure games, they often provided a lot of colorful, sometimes humorous, exposition on the game's plot and setting, but from a design perspective, less items for the player to work with means less red herrings (there are a few, such as [spoiler]the toilet cleaner[/spoiler])

In a nice touch, not all of Technobabylon's puzzles are linear: in several chapters there's more than one solution, and the game rewards you with achievements for discovering each.

They are either interactive works of fiction that don’t offer much in the way of traditional challenge, or they are traditionally difficult point-and-click games with traditionally broken logic. Games that combine a rich story and world building without feeling like a DVR simulator are somewhat rare. Being one of those rare titles is what makes Technocrat Games’s Technobabylon a remarkable experience. First began life as a freeware title, Technobabylon benefits from better production values (evident in the voice acting), revamped and stylistic pixel visuals, and a well assembled adventure experience thanks to the involvement of Wadjet Eye. 

[h1] A bit of background [/h1]
Technobabylon takes place in a sci-fi setting that is not to dissimilar to what what we’ve seen in adventure video games and other forms of media and entertainment. As you sink into the premise, setting and characters of Technobabylon, its influences become apparent in its nuances. Technobabylon will remind you of classic movies Blade Runner, cult classic games like Policenauts, iconic anime/manga like Ghost in the Shell and even newer anime like Psycho Pass. 

In a city called Newton, a place where science has risen above ethics and morals, and everyone plays god with free-form genetic engineering. Advances in computing power have led to massive advancements in AI, that mostly put to use for monitoring and controlling citizens. Social media and inter-web interaction has gone up a few notches, with the virtual-reality medium called Trance giving people a platform to interact in a virtual world and not deal with the real world responsibilities. Genetic engineering has made stunning advances as well – when an organic nanomachines called ""wetware"" are invented for many different purposes. Such freedoms and technological progress come at a price, however, when it created a generation of addicts (known as “thralls”) who have no jobs and spend most of their time in ""trance"", or when a genetically engineered children with explosive bones can be made as a suicide bomber. 

[h1] The protagonists [/h1]
Meet Regis, He’s the typical “too-old-for-this"" cop, and boy is he too old for this. If Regis could wear a Rage Against the Machine shirt to work, he would. Assuming people remember Rage Against the Machine in post-nuclear 2087. Surveillance cameras, computers, phones, cyborg-style implants—Regis hates the whole lot, and most of all he hates the city’s overzealous artificial intelligence, Central. 
Then there's Lao, an ordinary girl with her cheerfulness and spark keeps her partner Regis’ cynical doom-and-gloom attitude at bay for most of the game and brightens up the atmosphere considerably. In a game that has such a dark plot with so many terrible things happening, Max’s character provides the perfect balance to the mix, adding the sense of hope the story so desperately needs.
And finally Latha. She brings the game its biggest breath of fresh air, as she is able to enter the Trance. From here, she can interact with other users and even AI systems she encounters, displaying them through humanistic avatars complete with unique personalities. Here, the game flexes its creative muscles at not only providing unique gameplay, but also at delivering dialogue with wit and humor as well.

The way it shuttles you between these three viewpoints is probably one of my favorite aspect of the game. It feels like we learn a lot about the world, thanks to our split perspective. 

[h1] Puzzles n' stuff [/h1]
Speaking of puzzles, we can agree that the most important part of any puzzle-based games is the presentation of the puzzles themselves, and this is where Technobabylon really delivers. Not every puzzle has the same wealth of approaches, but in general things adhere to each character’s skills—low-fi investigation from Regis, high-tech hacking from Latha, and a bit of both from Lao. It’s a clever conceit that helps make each character feel functionally distinct even within the limited mechanics of a point-and-click adventure game. Whether its remotely piloting drones, manipulating AI personalities, or even solving how to enter through a locked doorway, Technobabylon makes figuring out how to get to the next destination an enjoyable experience. Visually, Tecnobabylon carries a style akin to the DOS adventure game classics from yesteryear, and the pixelated graphics are put to good use to create some detailed environments and character sprites. Neon colors/lighting mixes nicely with the darker contrast and undertones to create an artistically charged setting. Except for the character portraits that pop up in conversations, the game looks like an early 1990s LucasArts adventure game.

[h1] Some minor complaints [/h1]
Despite the overall positive experience, the playthrough wasn’t without its own set of problems. There are moments when I got confused about what the objects are or how they function, as it is often unclear without clicking on them to get a text description. The low fidelity visuals also contribute to the problem of not always knowing what you can grab from the environment and what you can manipulate. It is easy to miss out on a drawer or a wrench since so many useable items blend into the background. In addition to that, some of the voice acting – in particular that of Regis – was a little too monotone, which made even the more dramatic scenes a little less moving. Not to mention that Trance is somewhat underutilized too. We get glimpses of Trance’s potential, especially the part where Latha is constantly swapping between the virtual and physical worlds to solve puzzles. But in general the game doesn’t do enough with a world that has literally zero rules. 

[h1] Bottom line [/h1]
Honestly, I feel like I can write an essay or two about this game. Like drawing some comparison between Central (Newton's overzealous artificial intelligence) and The Sibyl system from Psycho Pass, whether the escapism provided by Trance a blessing in a world gone to hell, or is it merely enabling people to give up on the real world and many other topics to cover. But surely if you managed to make it this far, you want to see my thought about it. While there is no shortage of choice when it comes to adventure games — especially on Steam — Technobabylon is not just another face in the crowd. It doesn’t make you feel you are just a passenger along for the ride, nor does it make you feel like you need to be a mind reader to figure out how the developers want you to solve a puzzle. A little fix might have made game more enjoyable in a couple of ways, but the game is still a very easy one to recommend, especially since it's only 15 bucks.",1462674367,1462706680,True,35,0,0.799951434135437012,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What Technobabylon has; A bright, neon lit futuristic city, cool devices called travellers that you can use to phone people browse the web etc, people who live in cyberspace and are very much integrated with tech and a mystery that threatens to bring the entire city to collapse.

I loved every minute I played of Technobabylon, it is a very welcome step back to the adventure games of old, in the vein of Beneath a Steel Sky or Broken Sword. The world and characters are layers deep, as mentioned above, you can browse the net in game, play games, read the news, even check your mail. The characters have multiple dimensions that give them (and by extension the player) motivation to make questionable decisions. Also something I find quite novel for a point n' click, there are often multiple ways to resolve a given situation instead of having to find the right items to be used in the right way to advance. It has a fantastic story and typical of any SCI-FI piece, throws loads of nouns at you to wrestle with bringing you deeper into it's world.

I've been searching and playing different games from different studio's and the way
 I see this is a studio always have a recipe for making games that they will maintain 
and use for new games they release.

So to give you an example i've bought a pack of 5 games from Deadalic games and....
well it is just not my cookie. There is no logic in their puzzels is plain frustrating and
 the graphics won't make up for this but that's my view and it is subjective..

I had no experience with Wadjet eye games before Technobabylon and i'm playing 
through my first game how ever i feel that i have gained enough experience to give 
a review of this game and maybe about theirways of proceding in creating these stunning adventure games.

I must be a nerdy guy but i like pixelate games, given they are innovative like 
Void & meddler or.. in this case like Technobabylon, the ui is working like a 
charm and better the story is really good! 
The fact they don't charge huge amounts for their games says they are down to earth 
and realistic that's also a major.

I just bought the Shivah a second ago and the other games will be in my library too soon, because i think they well deserve it for keeping the Point & Click genre alive and putting their hart and soul into their games. 

I say big KUDOS for Wadjet eye games! can't wait for future games and i hope they will make more Cyberpunk genre games because i think this will be the favorite genre for the upcoming years! 

So first off the Soundtrack is a-w-e-s-o-m-e  it's been like never since i've heard such a great soundtrack the music is high quality and fits the game like man and wife.
The graphics are what you would expect and they added faces that expres how they think and feel, this is what you will be looking at while playing and they are of higher quality then main scene. 

I've had no problems what so ever finding items and completing the story, it's all very pleasant to
do, eg, like the puzzels are logic and linear thinking. again a Major.

You play with multiple protagonists and this enhances the story in a positive way, like the story is comming together. 

all in all i think you should buy and try this game, you could also try the demo and keep the save game i you decided to buy it after playing the demo.

The most striking thing about the game is that it does a far better job at building a fascinating science fiction world than most AAA productions; in this aspect it more closely approaches a good novel than a game, bringing to mind great cyberpunk authors like Rudy Rucker or William Gibson, while at the same time maintaining its own creative identity.  Food, sports, cyberspace and IRL addictions, crime, criminal justice, politics -- it's all handled in an unobtrusive and intriguing way that draws the player deeply in.  The puzzles, which are all of about medium difficulty, all make sense in the context of this world and its tech, coming across more as outgrowth than obligatory tack-on.  It would be a shame for Technocrat's painstakingly crafted milieu to go to waste, and fortunately, there are indications, both in [i]Technobabylon[/i]'s narrative and in the developer commentary, that a sequel may be in the works.  
   
There are a few questions that I would like answered about the mostly *very* impressive story (especially the import of a certain apartment bombing) but these gaps don't trip up the plot for me in the least; some of these can be left for the sequel I suppose, while the remainder can be left to player interpretation without strain on narrative continuity.  The voice acting, as in all Wadjet Eye productions, varies from actor to actor.  It is never bad, but never perfectly professional; it puts me in the mind of an obviously talented community theater troupe rather than a stable of career voice actors, and actually intensifies the hip ""indie"" vibe of the whole production.  I did encounter one minor bug in the game -- a wrench that I could not yank out of a gear because a partition blocked its hotspot -- but it only set me back about about a minute of playtime.

(There were many awesomely odd little incidents that really helped me suspend my disbelief.  For example:  in a scummy VR-hosting dive, the player character must pry off a layer of crusted old wetware -- signal-broadcasting, nanomachine-rich goop that people smear on devices to interface their own internal wiring to those systems -- before she can apply her own and access a machine.

The game pulls you into a great story through strong and relatable characters with clear motivations that you can get behind.  It dangles the mystery like a carrot on a stick, but gives you enough payoffs to keep you going.  The real star, however, is the amazing sense of world-building and atmosphere.  Technobabylon builds an incredibly believable world that builds off of our current technological and societal trajectory and takes it in some very scary directions.  Its atmosphere and soundtrack are also wonderful, creating a completely cohesive and immersive world.

The interactions between the characters are well done, and there are some standout supporting characters that are a real hoot.  The dialogue can get VERY expositional at times, especially when the plot twists start cropping up near the end, but overall the dialogue is very snappy and well done.

The gameplay is solid, using great puzzles and exploration that make sense but are still challenging.  It doesn't fall into the normal nonsensical adventure game puzzle tropes, which I'm very thankful for.  You can usually piece together what you need to do from your surroundings and resources, but you still feel smart for figuring it out.  There are a couple of times when what you're supposed to be doing isn't made clear (as in, what your objective is or why you're somewhere in the first place), but these points were few and far between.

I find a lot of point and click adventures to be a little tiresome these days, some are a little too rooted in conventions set by their predecessors, while others find themselves wrapped up in overly convoluted and obtuse puzzles. Technobabylon manages to find some fresh perspective on these puzzles, keeping most of their components within reasonable grasp and still manage to deliver a fantastic plot with engaging characters at the end of it all.

Presentation is beautifully executed, as i have come to expect with Wadjet Eye games, thus enables the player give in and throw themselves into the experience completely. There were some really cool and interesting puzzles involving the ""Trance"", along with a lot of humour stitched effortlessly next to some gruesome and possibly even barbaric scenes. I did find that one or two puzzles that involved the dreaded pixel hunt, and one puzzle in particular involved a reflex mini-game...which i hate with a passion in these types of games.

Co potěší je citlivá práce s přesahovými tématy „budoucnosti nastavující zrcadlo naší současné společnosti"", která nejsou lámána přes koleno a cpána za každou cenu do popředí. Co potěší ještě více jsou dospělé dialogy, u kterých nevzniká pocit, že takto se vyjadřují videoherní postavičky a ne skuteční lidé. A úplně nejvíce potěší, že v každé z deseti kapitol jde o něco jiného; jednou budete vylučovací metodou zjišťovat pachatele atentátu, jindy se snažit nepozorovaně uniknout ze zdánlivě opuštěné továrny a poté třeba ve virtuální realitě „vylidňovat server"".

 Tvůrci si vystačí v průměru s třemi až čtyřmi obrazovkami na kapitolu a ani nezahltí hráče předměty či aktivními body, přesto umí vytvořit nelehké, nápadité a komplexní „mnohaúrovňové"" puzzly, které ani zdaleka nejsou jen o správném používání předmětů a rozhodně vám nepomůže zběsilé zkoušení všeho na všechno; zapojení mozku se prostě nevyhnete. Hlavní puzzly ve většině kapitol mají více než jedno možné řešení; zpravidla tři v nejlepším možném odkazu žánrové klasiky [i]Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis[/i].

 Tolik ke kladům. Nyní však ta ale. Předně dějové vyústění v posledních dvou kapitolách je velkým krokem zpět oproti nadějnému rozjezdu. A vyloženě naštvou občasné adventurní excesy. Je jich sice minimum, ale do takto vyspělé a vnitřní elementární logiku vyznávající hry sedí asi jako Santa Claus k tradičním českým Vánocům. Jeden příklad za všechny: místo vraždy, hledání vražedné zbraně skrze podomácku vyrobený prut, zmagnetizované ramínko a bazének s vodou zakalenou krví, grrr! Takovéto řešení by sedlo do odlehčené adventury ve stylu Monkey Islandu, nikoli do vážné a řádně temné adventury.

 Každopádně celkově sympatická, nikterak krátká a středně těžká adventura s vyspělými charaktery i tématy. Takových je pomálu a je tedy dobré si zdařilých pokusů na tomto poli náležitě vážit. Zvlášť když je taková zábava je hrát.

Technobabylon is a breath of fresh air! The storyline is amazing & well executed! No annoying plotholes! Every relevant piece of information was sufficiently developed & clarified throughout the whole game.

Even though there were quite a bit of technical terms implemented in this game (which sometimes felt like I was learning a new language) I most definitely enjoyed the game! I found it very interesting & exciting!

The puzzles were of a satisfying difficulty. There was a good balance of ""flow"" & ""resistance"" in regard to game progression (for me, personally).

What I mean by this is that puzzle difficulty allowed for smoother progression at some times, and at other times I felt I was required to think a bit harder before I could proceed (without doing my head in  though).

So I was very pleasantly surprised by how the developer team pulled this off! 

I figured out most on my own, but did need to cheat about 2 times (hey!, that's not too bad!).

This game contains different fun elements:
- beautiful character design & environment + fitting music
- natural voice acting (although the way it was scripted made some reactions seem over-the-top)
- well written dialogue (made sense)
- multiple & meaningful character introductions
- intuitive & original puzzles (with some exceptions, but definitely doable)
- flashbacks
- choice & consequence
- virtual reality & AI theme
- ethnical diversity
- taboo & shocking details

There's a total of 3 main characters (which are each playable at some point, and even interchangeably so near the end, so as to have them act as a team - very fun!).

Just wished they had implemented that possibility sooner!

I pretty much loved everything about this game :). I could see myself replaying it over & over again in a couple of years from now!

This game gave me the chills (in a good way), the way Blade Runner did back in the day! It's so refreshing & different!

I'm hoping there will be a sequel to this! There has to be! The ending (as is) is acceptable, though I'd love to see more :)!

Pluspunkte:
+ Sehr stimmungsvolle Inszenierung sowohl was den konsequent durchgezogenen Grafikstil als auch die passende Musik betrifft.
+ Ein MUSS für jeden Fan von ""Beneath A Steel Sky""!
+ Man erfährt nebenher viel über die Stadt und den Zustand der Welt sodass man sich als Spieler gut in die Charaktere hineinversetzen kann.
+ Es gibt zu vielen Rätseln mehrere gültige Lösungsansätze. Der Spieler hat somit oft das Gefühl, dass eine logische Idee auch funktioniert, statt die einzige richtige Lösung zu jagen.
+ Die Perspektivwechsel sind nicht aufgesetzt sondern kaschieren Zeitsprünge perfekt und unterstützen die Story gut.

Kritik:
- In manchen Szenen passiert es, dass Teile der Grafik viel hochauflösender sind als in den zugrundeliegenden Pixelgrafik Stil passt. Dadurch sind manche Szenen leider optisch nicht so stimmig wie sie sein könnten.
- Ein kleinerer Hänger des Spiels, konnte durch einen Neustart leicht behoben werden.

There are a bunch of high level sci fi concepts put into the characters and set pieces. To mention any of them would take that discovery away from you so I won't really say too much, just suffice that it exists and it's fun to see what Technocrat came up with.

The actual writing is passable, but not super strong. The star here is really the sci fi ideas, not the characters themselves. I don't even want to criticise too much because it would require spoilers.

The actual puzzles are a mix of a bunch of different ideas too, and sometimes there are some minor UI issues as a result. Often it feels more like trying to understand how the game functions more than solving actual puzzles. But they work more often than not.

It's good timing as I have been reading 1984, A Brave New World and just watched Blade Runner. I think that Technobabylon creates an excellent futuristic dystopian world. If that is something of interest to you I would highly recommend this game. There are some really good concepts which are unlike anything I have really seen before. I especially like the ""Trance"" which is a form of internet which adds an extra element to problem solving.  

From my progression so far, 3.2 hrs in, does a really good job of drawing you into the characters and building a genuine reason to progress them through the story. Not only are they likeable but the background which is organically brought up gives them depth. The little splatters of dark humor is a really nice touch.

The gameplay is similar to a solid classic point and click adventure. Personally I think the graphics are perfect for the style and I found myself enjoying the slightly pixilated images and animation overalyed with the detailed facial expressions for dialogue that work so well to bring the world to life.

Overall, I think this game has a compelling story and ultimately is really fun to play, as a game should be. Definitely worth a my hard earned cash.

It is almost a crime how little this game sold on Steam, and it clearly needs more publicity. (So I feel I should at least write this review, dammit)

First things first, it catches what it takes something to be cyberpunk pretty well.
It also abides the number one cyberpunk rule - every character is involved for their own reasons and is trying to resolve their own problems. Their actions overlap, interests conflict, and thus, the story is born.

Moreover, dialogues are also put together very well, it really shows. 
When talking / describing a situation, characters are trying to cover all possible critique coming from player and explain their reasoning, so there will be no (or very little) unanswered ""Why didn't you do %that% instead?"" questions on your behalf.

Characters also have distinct personalities, and they are not in a hurry to just dump all information from character sheet on you, you need to ask questions (or not, just like with people around in ""meatspace"")

The pacing of game also matches a pace you expect from events of the story, so there is no dissonances on this part.

Plot twists: KOJIMA / 10

That's good writing for you.

As for gameplay aspects, like in every good point'n'click game, you are not so much ""solving puzzles"", as ""managing situations"", and there is often more than one way to resolve your problems (It is mirrored by achievements, which is nice)

Overall, it's a must have.
Technocrat Games clearly should be more proud of their creation and make better publicity for Technobabylon and future games.

Three viewpoint characters you swap between at plot points (two cops with biosci PHD's, and a jobless net addict), one of whom happens to be trans -- an interesting throw-away detail that doesn't define the character.

[b]PROS:[/b]

-nice pixel art, the spech portraits are also done well

-great soundtrack

-sports a great setting with a dystopian future where technology makes cyberspace, geoengineering and AI possible and exploitable 

-very engaging plot mixes a murder investigation, secret plots to subvert the city, blackmailing and trying to discover one's past: it has great momentum for all characters involved 

-satisfying endings

-while not extremely deep the characters involved are interesting and all have their goals and motivations, reacting credibly to what happens to them

-fully voice acted, almost all actors do a very good job

-puzzles are generally straightforward if you use your mind and satisfying to tackle/ solve

-good length at 10 hours

[b]CONS:[/b]

-a few dialogue lines are delivered awkwardly

-few cases of interactive objects being hard to see

-a couple of puzzles could be slightly hard to solve due to the fact they assume an understanding of how the future technology works

Technobabylon is an example of point and click done right with its great story, engaging narrative, well designed puzzles and meticulously crafted sci-fi world: it's hard to not be taken by its plot since it soon starts affecting the characters involved, oftentimes deeply, and has a good amount of mysteries to be solved, with more than a few twists along the way. The gameplay is also quite good with puzzles that are, for the most part, logical and that make sense in the context of the area you're in.

The few things that can be criticized are a few dialogues where voice actors seemed to lack the appropriate emtion while delivering their line and some puzzles that require you to make sense of how some technologies work in the game world like what can be linked to/ hacked. It generally can be solved with some trial and error using the items/ software available though.

I can absolutely recommend Technobabylon to anyone interested in the genre, anyone wanting a deep story and/ or anyone who loves cyberpunk settings: it's truly a gem and everyone from the aforementioned audiences should play through it.

No offence meant to Wadjet Eye, but I'd played several of their games previously, including the Blackwell series and The Shivah, and found them kind-of-sort-of-OK - my main criticism being that they were *far* too short; as soon as the story even starts to get going, the game is suddenly over. Point and clicks are such a story driven genre that getting immersed in a great, involved story is, I feel, a vital factor.

On this, Technobabylon delivers in spades. There's probably a good 15 hours of epic adventuring (if you even have the vaguest interest in talking to characters and exploring the world) and they're a great 15 hours.

[b] Pros [/b]
+ Far better sound quality than previous Wadjet Eye games (Curious NB: In the commentary, Dave Gilbert - the company's 'big cheese' - says that this was the first time they used a professional voice recording studio rather than his house, and that the difference was palpable, although this was in the quality of the voice acting and that you'd probably only notice the difference in sound if you were an 'audiophile' - gotta say, I am nowhere near an 'audiophile', but the difference in sound quality of the dialogue in this is leaps and bounds ahead of the quality in the Blackwell games.)
+ Decent voice acting (and lots of it - great if you like lots of opportunity to explore characters and their reactions to the world)
+ As I have mentioned, great length, allowing you to get lost in the story, and also providing great value for the price. If you want to 100% the achievements, you'll be playing even longer
+ Elements of choice - not a lot, but they were there, and that's relatively rare for a P&C
+ Interesting concepts and setting
+ Despite it being pixel art, it was quite beautiful in places
+ Fantastic, logical puzzles - you're unlikely to need a walkthrough if you persevere just a little
+ You get to play as several different characters which kept it interesting from chapter to chapter
+ Almost no backtracking as your set of locations changes each chapter (pretty much), meaning solving even the toughest puzzles is more do-able because you do not have to wander round 50 different screens trying to combine items with 100s of things
+ Interactive items are highlighted on screen so no pixel hunting.

[b] Cons [/b]
- Why, oh why, must the characters waaaaalllllllk soooooo sloooooooowlllllly? This gets pretty tedious, particularly when you're a little stuck so you're wandering around trying a few different things.
- Would be interesting in future to see them branch out into something other than pixel/retro art (this isn't necessarily a 'con' but the style may put some players off, and that's a shame, as everyone that likes point and clicks should try this!).

TL:DR - If you liked previous Wadjet Eye games, you'll love this one; if you weren't keen on previous Wadjet Eye games I'd still recommend picking this up as it's their best by far (of the ones I've played); if you've never played a Wadjet Eye game but have even a passing interest in point and clicks, get this game, it's worth every penny.
10/10 Would trance again.

Divided among several characters, you play a series of chapters eventually converging on a shared central plot where everyone is inevitably intertwined. You will love the first half hour or even the first hour depending on how long the initial puzzle takes you however any sense of this being a game for adults swiftly flies out the window by the second chapter. 

*Potential spoiler*

In the comments below reviewers are making claims such as the ""good voice acting"" or ""impressive story line with interesting characters"" and....for the life of me I cannot comprehend how. In the three hours that I played I was introduced to three archetypes that were neither interesting or unique in any fashion. I lost faith in the ""fleshed out characters"" when a man fell from the sky and landed on a nearby car outside to which my characters calmly looked at the body made a few offhand remarks about how odd that was and proceeded to discuss the next objective. It could be argued that since the ""Omnipresent"" AI controls so much of the city that even sudden murder is viewed with an almost apathetic reaction but the game does little to give the player any sense of immersion or backstory for this to be believed. The dialogue is poorly spoken and the characters are bland cardboard cliches.

This being said, I will admit that the interactions with some of the computer programs was genuinely fascinating and fulfilling. It is a sad state when the only enjoyable moments in the game come from the various AI interactions with panels and programs then with the actual human characters. 

Rereading the description I feel I should have known better.

A cyberpunk adventure game from the studio that brought you Gemini Rue and Blackwell! The year is 2087. Genetic engineering is the norm, and an omnipresent AI powers the city. Take control of three citizens of this world as they struggle to understand a deadly conspiracy.

An exclamation point and the phrase ""generic engineering is the norm."" 

I was not going into this game expecting novel trilogy building depth but if you are going to make a puzzle adventure game (and I am using the phrase puzzle lightly here) then you must make people care about what is happening and build a sense of interest in the characters. 

TL;DR 
Retro graphics cover up bland story with horrible voice acting and cliche story. Would recommend to people with more simplistic tastes.",1443611104,1443611104,False,20,2,0.523732364177703857,3,True,False,False,False,,,

In order to get through a scene you will have to interact with everyone, gather everything, and combine these two mechanics many levels deep to solve a situation.  This is both enormously fun and mind-numbingly frustrating at the same time.  The game is not linear in its interactions, but the scene's progression has a very defined route.  You KNOW you missed something when you get stuck, but your problem solving path may be tripped up by a trivial interation you missed a long time ago and a few screens back.  The game can become frustrating with those  unguided regressions, but not to the point where you want to rage quit...although sometimes it's close.  

I wish there were more ways to solve trivial problem steps, but that's not within the scope of games like this and the overall ride is well worth the few bumps it will give you along the way.

Voice acting is good, I would say slightly better than in Gemini Rue and Resonance.

Some things that bother me are the short length of the game, the rushed final act and the fact that one of the three playable characters gets very little screen time and feels a little underdeveloped.

Easily amongst the best modern point-and-clicks I've played, and good enough to hold its own with the classics too. Its engaging story is bolstered by stellar worldbuilding that strikes the perfect balance between drowning the player in backstory vs giving them nothing outisde the main narrative. You get to delve deep into many aspects of the dystopian cyberpunk future that the game weaves around you, but there are plenty of things that are only mentioned or implied. This dichotomy makes the game/world feel much larger than it actually is, which is a rare trick in this age of exposition heavy Wiki-oriented games. The end result of the narrative and worldbuilding is a game that you won't want to stop playing, and I was a little sad when I completed it just because I knew that was all I'd get to see of this world.

That said, it does have the same flaws as many other games of its type. Sometimes you won't be able to parse what the designer expects you to do next. Other times you'll overlook an interactable object and spend a good 15 minutes furiously trying everything in your inventory on all the interactable points until you realize you missed something. You'll be able to get hints from NPCs to help you past some of these issues, but they're still present and can be annoying when trying to complete the game without a walkthrough. I think it's worth noting that the hints were never immersion-breaking; the NPCs' advice always seemed to fit their characters and the situation at hand, rather than breaking the fourth wall and condescending to the player by practically telling them the solution.

All in all, this is a must-have for anyone who loves point-and-click or cyberpunk. If you like both then scroll up, click ""Add to Cart,"" and free up the next 8-10 hours to be swept away by this masterpiece.

Plot holes are sparse, the kind where I only noticed them when reading a review afterward.

With each new title, Wadjet Eye Games continues to raise the bar for the point-and-click genre. 
Technobabylon is a great blend of dystopian science fiction and detective story. With its 
thought-provoking story and themes, engaging characters, and its incredible use of pixelated graphics, Technobabylon proves that the point-and-click genre is alive, well, and growing artistically.

The story of Technobabylon is intriguing, and also told out of order from different points of view. This keeps the player engaged and shows the incredible depth of the world that the game takes place in. While it falls in the realm of science fiction, I feel that the game takes place in the not so distant future, considering how quickly technology is advancing. Not only is there a great story, but there are a variety of themes and ideas that could provoke thoughtful discussion. As society advances, the importance of family, the increase in scientific power and how much license mankind should take, and the dangers of embracing a virtual world while forsaking the responsibilities of the real world are all examined. This is a game that tackles a number of social issues that are relevant today, as well as what could possibly be achieved in the future. 

The characters of this game are well fleshed out and acted. In Technobabylon, we follow three main protagonists, Dr. Charles Regis, a genetic engineer with a past; Max Lao, his tech savvy partner;  and Latha Sesame, a young woman who would rather live in a virtual world than face the harshness of reality. All the performances in this game are top notch, with great writing throughout. 

Finally, the star of the game is how beautiful it is. Pixelated art never looked so good. The stunning backgrounds and gritty atmosphere really give the game depth. The techno music is a 
perfect fit for the gorgeous and gritty city. 

Point-and-click games have come a long way from the obtuse puzzles and nonsensical solutions that they are known for. Technobabylon's puzzles feel more like continuing an investigation. While puzzles may take more thought, they are not difficult. There are also instances where there are multiple solutions to a puzzle or situation. This game should be replayed in order to see all the different outcomes. There is also the ability to hack into different electronics, which almost feels like breaking the fourth wall, as one is able to effortlessly phase in and out of the virtual world.

Technobabylon is a great and creative game that should not be missed by those who love science fiction and a great story. This game educates as well as entertains. I look forward to more from Technocrat Games, and can understand fully why Wadjet Eye would want to publish this game. Its great story, memorable characters, and stunning sights and sounds prove that the point-and-click 
genre is still worthy of attention and excitement.",1436861123,1436861366,True,34,0,0.671994209289550781,3,False,False,False,False,,,

In fact, some aspects of it are superb, but I just -can't- recommend it. If Steam had a neutral option, I would've picked that. For now, I have to regretfully give a thumbs down.

The cyberpunk setting the game has is amazing. I could really connect with the characters. Their motivations were clear, and the decisions they faced were well-executed. The whole story was put together well and kept the intrigue going, apart from maybe the big plot twist, which I saw coming from a mile away, and when it was revealed, it only left me disappointed that there wasn't more to it than what I already figured out.

I also really like the old-school pixelated art style. The art is beautiful. Most notable were the character portraits. Brilliant artwork. The voice acting was also really well done. 

So, a great story, beautiful art, and solid voice acting. Why the thumbs down? Well, just like most point and click games, this game suffers from convoluted puzzles that often make no logical sense, and at times even require you to have the knowledge of how things in the game's fictional setting work, like wetware or trance. Don't get me wrong - some of the puzzles were fun and executed well, but many others require you to have a walkthrough on hand, especially in the last two chapters. It just horribly breaks the pace of the story.

The game also offers some choices. It was a great touch, though many don't seem to make much of a difference to the story. I was especially annoyed by the ending, which I shall outline in the spoiler below (read at your own risk!):
[spoiler] The ending had me choose to either side with the A.I. or side with the power-hungry woman (Nina Jeung). I chose to side with the A.I. and to give it full control of the city, and yet, the A.I ended up somehow getting under Nina's control, even though I specifically chose not to side with her. These kind of false choices really ruin potentially good stories. What was the point of giving me this choice when the outcome is almost the same? [/spoiler]

So to conclude, although I enjoyed a lot of parts of the game, it left me feeling disappointed, and hence I can't with all honesty recommend the game. If you don't mind the outlandish puzzles that will force you to consult a walkthrough, then by all means, get the game. Otherwise, eh, just watch the story on Youtube or something.",1436829508,1436829508,False,70,1,0.654765129089355469,13,False,False,False,False,,,

From the atmospheric opening credits to the tumultuous ending, this game is packed full of originality and atmosphere. In Technobabylon, you play the role of two disenfranchised citizens in the sprawling metropolis of Newton. The year is 2087 and the entire city is controlled by an all-seeing, all-knowing artificial intelligence known as ‘Central.’

Charlie Regis, an old-school detective with a background in human engineering and a poverty-stricken young woman named Latha Sesame with an addiction to the ‘trance’ (a kind of futuristic, full-sensory internet) serve as our protagonists. Charlie does not trust Central to the point that he regularly covers up the camera in his office under the pretence that it is malfunctioning. His appreciation for privacy and his belief in the human side of police work make him something of an odd-ball in a city which simply accepts the convenience of rule by AI. He serves as the plot’s moral compass, especially when compared to his partner, Max Lao, who embraces the complexity of technology in all of its forms. Similarly, Latha Sesame is an expert at the use of the trance, a kind of state of meditation which allows humans to physically interact with computers and technology through the use of an organic material known as ‘wetware.’

If I’m making the plot of Technobabylon sound complex that’s because it is, but the game presents it in such a way that it becomes easy to digest. Take, for example, the concept of the ‘trance.’ The opening puzzle shows the player exactly how this works when Latha is unable to leave her apartment due to a power cut. She must then utilize her abilities to trance with the various AIs which control the objects in her room. One of them is a security obsessed anti-virus program, designed with the personality of a medieval knight. The other is an annoyingly chirpy, anime-inspired computer chef named ‘Cheffie’, responsible for cooking and preparing meals for the inhabitants of all apartments in the city. These AIs become some of the most entertaining and ultimately compelling characters in the game and in truth, I was left feeling that Technobabylon could have explored this idea further. There are other AIs in the game but not nearly as many as I had hoped for and that early promise was, to a certain extent, never delivered upon. But in truth, I’m nit-picking.

Despite suffering from the often convoluted style of puzzle-design that seems to have dogged the point-and-click genre forever, Technobabylon’s puzzles are usually tough but fair. However, where the game really shines is in its presentation of the city of Newton and its inhabitants. The colossal sky-line flanking the highway as Charlie’s patrol car speeds to its next destination, the incorporeal cyber-bar where trance-addicted techno-junkies meet to anonymously dance and play computer games, the dilapidated, graffiti-ridden factories of an abandoned district of the city. All these locations come together to create the impression of a living, breathing city, a city that you believe could really exist sixty years from now. This is aided in no small part by the excellent, ambient soundtrack which, for me, was very reminiscent of the original Deus Ex’s score.

The plot is brilliantly original, especially in the already bloated cyberpunk genre, a genre which Wadjet Eye have already explored in 2011’s ‘Gemini Rue.’ But where Gemini Rue’s World felt oppressive, claustrophobic and ultimately constrictive, the city of Newton feels open and is presented as a bastion of liberal thinking and left-wing acceptance, all the while giving you the impression that this image might just be merely another tool for control of the populace. Valtaire’s famous statement that “it is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere” springs instantly to mind and this subversion of the old cyberpunk cliché of a right-wing government being obviously evil and brutally oppressive is a real breathe of fresh air.

Technobabylon is definitely a game for fans of the genre. If you’re looking for non-stop action and intense gameplay then you won’t find it here. But chances are, unless you’re a Victorian time traveller who has never played a computer game before, you already knew that. Solid puzzles, beautiful level design, decent voice acting and a constantly intriguing plot make Technobabylon an adventure well worth embarking on and at just $14.99/£10.99 it is also an adventure which won’t break your wallet.

These issues were blotted out by the mysteries, the music, the audio design, and puzzles with multiple solutions. I just loved “being in the world”, to whatever extent that’s possible in a point-and-click. It was a nice place to be in, even before the first line of the game was spoken. I saw it, I heard it, and I knew I liked it. That propelled me through the opening of the game until the story kicked off in proper and hooked me completely.

Compared to Primordia, Technobabylon’s story lacks depth. It goes for a less subtle and more action heavy approach. More thrills, more instant gratification, and no confusion. This approach works, as it succeeds in actually being thrilling, and makes it hard to put down. Because of this, I find Technobabylon easy to recommend.

It's very detailed and all the additional info is very interesting to read. 
In terms of gameplay this game has some variety of choices to make and a bunch of different ways to achieve something you need. None of them left me saying ""that's irrational/illogical"", so everything can be done without looking into the walkthrough, which is a feature of a nicely elaborated quest.
I would totally recomend buying it.

Ya tenemos aquí la nueva aventura gráfica de Wadjet Eye Games, que en los tiempos que corren casi es como decir la nueva aventura de Lucas Arts o Sierra, porque el testigo de aquellas empresas lo recogieron una serie de estudios independientes, entre los que destaca especialmente éste por llevar ya unos cuantos videojuegos publicados y por ser todos de una notable factura. Evidentemente no son los presupuestos actuales de las pequeñas empresas los mismos que tenían las grandes compañías que he nombrado, ni está el género tan de moda como lo estuvo en la década de los 90, pero salvando algunos detalles técnicos uno diría que no han pasado los años, sensación acrecentada en parte por el aspecto tradicional de los gráficos en baja resolución, tan parecidos a los de Simon The Sorcerer, Legend of Kyrandia o cualquier otro título de los que asentaron el género aventurero.

Wadjet Eye Games producen sus propios juegos, como los de la serie Blackwell, pero también se dedican a poner el dinero para publicar los de otras pequeñas compañías. Este es el caso de Technobabylon, que originalmente era un juego gratuito por capítulos, obra de los independientes Technocrat. El trabajo de los responsables de Wadjet Eye Games, como en las ocasiones anteriores, ha consistido en un remozado gráfico y el doblaje de los protagonistas, en lineas generales. El resultado, para que nos entiendan las personas familiarizadas con estos juegos, le da a la aventura un aspecto similar al de las anteriores publicaciones de la casa.

Aunque cuenta con alguna excepción, a estas alturas podemos decir que Wadjet Eyes Games se ha especializado en el tema fantástico, tocando varias vertientes. Mientras la serie Blackwell mezcla el género detectivesco con el espiritismo, hay varios juegos de la compañía que entran en la definición de ciencia ficción. En Gemini Rue, por ejemplo, el género negro se funde con el punk y en Primordia nos encontramos con un space opera, mientras que en Resonance el thriller tiene vahos tecnológicos. Technobabylon nos devuelve al cyberpunk de una forma más concreta, pues cuenta con una variedad de ingredientes que podríamos encontrar perfectamente en una novela de William Gibson o Bruce Sterling, considerados exponentes del género. Pongámonos en situación. Un argumento criminal, un guión enrevesado con diversos protagonistas que se acaban relacionando, un escenario distópico en el que los ciudadanos de una megalópolis futurista y decadente mantienen una lucha de clases, y lo más importante de todo: La gente se conecta al ciberespacio mediante una red neuronal, lo que nos remite y refiere inmediatamente a las novelas Count Zero o Neuromancer, del citado Gibson. Añada todo esto a la coctelera de las aventuras gráficas y con un poquito de imaginación tendrá una idea de qué es Technobabylon.

 

Supongo que hasta ahora a algunos lectores les puede sonar estupendo este breve resumen de Technobabylon, pero analicemos el juego con detenimiento. Por lo que se refiere al cyberpunk, los acontecimientos transcurren por el derrotero que un aficionado al género esperaría, incluyendo una cantidad de diálogos más bien extensa para lo que las aventuras gráficas nos suelen ofrecer. Esto no significa que todas las conversaciones nos encaminen a diversas consecuencias o incluso a un callejón sin salida, según las respuestas escogidas, como podría ser el caso de un Monkey Island.

En Technobabylon la mayoría de los textos son expositivos y sirven para dar consistencia al argumento. La selección de una opción u otra solamente nos lleva, en la mayoría de las ocasiones, a conocer más detalles de los protagonistas o del universo antiutópico que se pretende retratar, pudiendo escoger a continuación otras respuestas para seguir avanzando con los distintos diálogos, ahondando en el conocimiento de los personajes, en ciertos detalles de su pasado, sus relaciones afectivas o de trabajo y la visión que tienen de la sociedad en la que viven.


Sí que existen en determinadas ocasiones algunas alternativas que nos permiten resolver los problemas de modos distintos, aunque inmediatamente nos vuelven a conducir a la trama principal, que es básicamente lineal. Mi crítica, en cambio, no se refiere a la rigidez del argumento, cuestión sobre la que no tengo nada que objetar siempre que éste sea suficientemente sólido e interesante, sino al poco provecho que se saca del aspecto audiovisual del juego para sumergirnos en la historia y narrarnos los acontecimientos. Tenemos los decorados habituales del cyberpunk, ciertamente, con sus ciudadanos babeantes adictos a la red, los cuchitriles de la clase obrera y un poco de violencia explícita, pero es que en Technobabylon nos enteramos de casi todo lo que ocurre a través de los diálogos y explicaciones de los protagonistas, muchos de ellos excesivamente largos y algunos impostados, añadidos a la fuerza para explicar las circunstancias de la escena y las motivaciones de los personajes. Pienso que se ha perdido una buena ocasión de narrar los acontecimientos usando una estética visual y sonora más vanguardista, con el objetivo de maridar lo que se cuenta con la forma de hacerlo.

Independientemente del recurso de la saturación de los textos, la trama recurre a los clichés del cyberpunk que enumeraba anteriormente, llevados con un ritmo desigual y con más acierto en algunos casos que en otros. En ciertas ocasiones el guión hace agua por su simpleza, casi de novela adolescente, con un protagonista principal que da lecciones de moralina en vez de dejar que el propio jugador extraiga sus conclusiones, aunque se compensa con otros momentos acertados que nos devuelven la tensión y el interés. En su conjunto Technobabylon consiste en una repetición de situaciones e ideas ya conocidas por cualquier aficionado del cine o la literatura cyberpunk, al que pueden satisfacer o arrancar una sonrisa cómplice por el homenaje que suponen al género, pero a las que veo faltas de atrevimiento e innovación, sobre todo tratándose de un estilo al que se le supone rompedor y subversivo. Todo acaba transcurriendo según lo previsto. Demasiado, cuando lo que uno demanda de la subversión es que sorprenda y escandalice, no solamente por lo que se refiere al argumento, sino también a la comunicación sonora y visual.

En cuanto a los puzles, que suelen ser el recurso de mayor peso en las aventuras tradicionales, los autores han optado por el clasicismo con todo lo que eso implica, sin aportar nada realmente novedoso y que hubiera estado en consonancia con una aventura futurista. Lo único que podemos destacar es la inclusión del ciberespacio, en el que también se han de resolver algunos acertijos, pero por lo demás todo funciona con el tradicional método de recoger objetos para usarlos directamente en el escenario o combinados entre sí. Esto no es un defecto en sí mismo, pues no lo puede ser una mecánica que nos ha dado tantos buenos juegos, pero como los puzles no son excepcionales o maquiavélicos, amén que los objetos se usan siempre en las inmediaciones de donde los descubrimos, nos encontramos ante un videojuego que reparte sus virtudes entre el argumento y la resolución de enigmas a partes iguales, aunque distando de la excelencia en ambos casos.

Dicho esto, no quiero decir que Technobabylon sea un juego ramplón, ni por asomo. En realidad me ha parecido una aventura digna, con un buen arranque y una parte final meritoria, bastante divertida en general y destacable, que recomiendo sin dudarlo a cualquier aficionado del cyberpunk.

Конец двадцать первого века. США расколоты на два государства гражданской войной, большая часть Азии страдает от еще даже не закончившейся ядерной войны, Европа давно объединилась в одну большую страну, чтобы спасти себя. 
Прогресс тоже не стоял на месте. Люди смогли создать наномашины, которые позволяют мозгу напрямую интегрироваться с электронными системами. Так был создан Транс, виртуальное пространство, в котором огромное количество пользователей может быть тем, кем/чем хочет. Там нет законов и правил. 
Добро пожаловать в мир будущего. В [i]Техновавилон[/i].

Эта игра - история трех персонажей, которые оказались в (не)нужном месте в (не)нужное время.  Место действий - город Ньютон, которым управляет ИИ нового поколения Цэнтрал. 

Доктор Чарльз Риджис и доктор Макс Лао работают в Центре Экстренной Логистики - CEL -, по сути являющимся полицией города Ньютон. Вооруженные своей смекалкой, тазерами и помощью Цэнтрал они должны расследовать череду странных преступлений, совершенных Майндджэкером, человеком, который крадет разумы людей. 
Лата Сезам - безработный аддикт Транса; она не может и пары дней протянуть без виртуального пространства. В один момент она, будучи в собственной социальной квартире, теряет соединение с Трансом и влипает в такую историю, что техподдержка ей точно не поможет.

Каждый из них - действительно личность, и за них действительно сложно не переживать. Эмоции героев чувствуются, реакции закономерны и логичны. Несмотря на то, что многие придираются к голосовой озвучке, мне она по нраву, хотя местами чувствуется несколько любительский подход. 

Музыкальное оформление совершенно безупречно. Над ним работал тот же композитор, что и в небезызвестном [i]Gemini Rue[/i]. По его же заверению, ОСТ игры можно будет купить в Steam в ближайшее время.

Графическая составляющая достаточно неплоха для подобной игры: демонстрирует интересные анимации, персонажи делают какие-то свои дела. Но, если по справедливости, какой-то невероятной графики Вы тут точно не увидите. 

Геймплей схож с тем, что можно встретить в любом другом квесте: классический наведи@щелкни. Охотой за пикселями, впрочем, вас заставлять заниматься не будут. 
Паззлы достаточно сложны, в нескольких местах, скорее всего, придется действительно крепко призадуматься, но нигде не нужно догадываться, чего же от Вас хотел разработчик, все решения логичны, хоть пусть эта логика и работает в рамках самой игры.

Если Вы сомневаетесь, стоит ли покупать [i]Техновавилон[/i], и Вы не играли в [i]Gemini Rue[/i], могу посоветовать начать с последнего. Он стоит дешевле, но по стилю и духу эти игры очень похожи. 

К сожалению, у игры есть один серьезный ""минус"" - полное отсутствие поддержки русского языка. Мне трудно сказать, будет ли когда-либо сделаны русские субтитры или даже озвучка, но пока их не предвидится. 

В любом случае, игра потрясает глубиной своего мира и сюжета. Искренний Вам совет: не торопитесь. Читайте каждое письмо, проведите каждый диалог и обязательно прочтите свежие новости. 
Да, даже спортивные.

From the awesome score, to the witty dialogue, creative and complex puzzles and engaging cyber dystopian atmosphere, Technobabylon opened on a high note, and up until the credits, damn well held out on a strong stellar beat.

It's the type of game that if you're not a long term follower of Wadjet Eye Games (like me), you'd be like ""how did I not know of this?"" and then seek them out for more.

But on Technobablyon, lets discuss the pros.

On gameplay, the simple style of ""one room but a hell of a lot to do"" is fun, yet brain taxing. It must be me and my diet of modern hold-your-hand grade 5 logic puzzles, and shoot-pointblank-don't-think FPS's, but it took me a while to figure out a few of the challenges. That's not really a bad thing, as the puzzles are (mostly fun) and very creative in thought and execution (the CI program on the synths ensures hilarity), and overall, it's a refreshing experience for cerebral activity in their gaming. Just be prepared to use the noggin! ;)

Characters are mostly cliche-free ridden, with talented but vulnerable Latha, transgender protagonist Max (a minor but still notable detail), and ""old-man"" technophobe Charlie, a Texan who finds himself caught in a situation he doesn't want involving his deceased Sri-Lankan wife. In fact, very noticeable are the diverse and different ethnicities and characters; again it's something new and different in media. (Heck, the setting of fiction Newton city is India, not ""New York,"" or even LA!!)

The music sets the world mood excellently. From the calming sooth and placid feel of escapist Trance lobbys, to dour, gritty feel of investigate megacity murder, the audio matches the setting, tone, and pace mirroring the on screen action.

The writing is wry and writty; sardonic Max makes one sarcastic quip after the next, and Charlie has his own way of handling things, as does Latha, but really, so do all characters, major and minor alike, with a writing humorous style in  constant flow. On note of the characters, the voice acting is quite impressive, with characters carrying the wit and humor far, and giving some mostly convincing dramatics. The narrative engages, and the plot catches, though listen and pay careful attention to the narrative earlier than later, otherwise you'll miss a few things, as well as some ""oh wow!"" story revelations. 

I can tell that it was a small studio (probably very small actually) that made TB, but there was a lot of love and care put into it and it shows. The game is very charming, and in the days of 4K res, 60fps, blah, blah, it at least gathers an unhealthy, grimy ambience to the entire cyberpunk setting. One other thing to appreciate, despite the small studio size, Technobabylon retains from feeling like a tiny indie game with peesy commercial value. Give or take a few noticable modern things, if this was back in the day and you'd said a big studio made it, I'd have swallowed it in one go.

Some minor gripes: one puzzle involving a crime scene you stumble into is particularly hard to solve because of a particular items lack of visibility. I quite stumbled onto it by accident, but this could have been spelt out a little better. Another thing, at times the narrative and plot convolutions are hard to follow. Truthfully though, since when was cyberpunk known for ease of rite, accessibility, clarity and understanding? TB's narrative clunks are all intentional right? XD

So where does that leave us?

If you're a cyberpunk aficionado, love classic pointers, and like engaging logic puzzles (relative to the brain drizzle on today's market), you'd be a nob to ignore Technobablyon.

This was my first Wadjet Eye Games game, and I'm definitely checking out the rest of their catalogue. 

Final verdict? For general gamers, 9/10, but for point click adventurers/cyberpunk fans, a definite 10/10.

The conspiracy-driven narrative follows the story of three playable characters;- Charlie Regis a CEL agent and his case officer partner Max Lao along with Latha Sesame; a jobless Trance addict who spends her time fixed in a fantasy online world as opposed to the heavily controlled Newton. After a spate of bombings in the city and a criminal on the run who steals people's memories - the 'Mindjacker'; the game flourishes into a sublime and depth-ridden tale of corruption and intrigue. Elaborating any further would be a huge spoiler but it is simply an incredibly well crafted narrative that is extremely thought-provoking and powerful. 

The general gameplay is similar to that of classics in the genre and modern titles alike such as Blade Runner and Gemini Rue. It's a puzzle-oriented point and click adventure with some very difficult and well-designed puzzles. Some have been very smartly implemented and can often leave you feeling confused and hapless. The satisfaction when you solve a problem and progress a wonderful feeling though as well as earning achievements. Voice acting is also present and is supported by some very appropriate music that adds to the amazing atmosphere. The writing is also very impressive with many clever fictional futuristic aspects being added that brings intrigue and understanding what happened in the past. Some of the script terminologies are very complex though and users sometimes have to decipher and guess what the game is talking about as some things aren't explained clearly. You will gradually understand everything as your progress though, as the narrative begins to fall into place and terms are elaborated in greater detail. 

Overall; Technobabylon is one of the best games I've played this year and another massive success for WadgetEye Games and Steam debut developer Technocrat. The game is complex, challenging, engaging and a remarkable experience throughout. It will take 12-15 hours to finish and with plenty of achievements on offer; there is certainly replay value here also. A must buy!",1432669309,1432722758,True,3,0,0.453915774822235107,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I can't be alone in say ""what the fuck, how does this make sense!?""

I speak of the keycard door, you don't need the code despite all indications pointing to the fact that you do, the girl you're with just shoots the lock if you mention the lock to her, which negates the reason for trying to find out the code to begin with.

The design stretches beyond the main story to fill out a fascinating version of the future. The switching between characters, reminiscent of Wadjet Eye's equally impressive Resonance, gives you multiple perspectives on the city of Newton, which comes alive through implicit storytelling - filling in history and culture without dense exposition. Well-written dialogue develops naturally from the characters and is often very inventive, with no opportunity for embellishing the world squandered. 

The puzzles are well integrated into the story and fun, sometimes offering multiple paths to the solution - and eventually multiple endings. Artwork is more exceptional pixel-mastery from Wadjet Eye regular Ben Chandler, coherent and consistent design with great use of teal/orange colour scheme. Sound is a weaker aspect, with the music being competent but not memorable, and the quality of voice acting dipping significantly for some side characters.

All-in-all, another reason to give Wadjet Eye your money: 9/10

The sheer number of ideas running through game is amazing, and the fact that everything gets pulled back together to give a satisfying conclusion with no loose ends is nothing short of a masterstroke from Technocrat Games. Characters are deep, with real personalities, secrets, desires and resentments. Even the ‘synthetic’ characters are better written than many supposedly human characters in other games. The forces of good in the game have dark sides to them, and the antagonists are not simply evil for the sake of it; there’s no moustache twirling and maniacal laughter here. Everything happens for a reason, and the reasons are damn good ones!

The art is really nice (it's Ben Chandler), and the voice acting is better than average too, with some great personalities in there. Definitely worth it if you're a point and click enthusiast!

So I preordered it like other games from Wadjet Eye Games.
Then I waited for the release, so as soon as I saw that it's released, I started playing it.
The story instantly got me hooked, because I like stories, where you have to chase a target. 
Also the setting in the future is a great plus for me, because the future is one of these things we can not predict, so it's a really interesting setting to do things in it.
So you are playing different character through out the game.
There is Lao and Regis, who try to hunt a mindjacker down, and there is Latha, who was trapped in her home and was nearly killed and now tries to find out who and why he wanted to kill her.
So the story follows these paths and it's obvious that their ways will cross some time through out the game, but I won't tell more about it, because it would spoil of the game. :)
All in all the story was very thrilling and I wanted to find out what will happen next and how it will end. Also there were some points in the story that was really unexpected for me, but if you will play the game you will see what I meant. :)

The game is obvious a point'n'click adventure, so it has puzzle to progress and overall they aren't that hard, but sometimes you probably will get stuck, because you overlook some thing like I did.
Also at some points of the game you have more than one option to accomplish your goal, which also results in a point, where your decision will change the end of the game. 

So if you like point'n'click adventures with a good story, you won't make a mistake for buying this game. So buy it and play it, there is no reason not to !

I really recommend this game to any cyberpunk or simply SF fan. I couldn't wait for Technobabylon because Resonance and Primordia are part of my favorite point & click adventures. I am aware that all of these games are made by different teams within Wadjet Eye, but it's still tempting to compare them. 

The conspiracy that gets untangled slowly hooked me up very quick. I also loved how the characters, when you play with each of them, don't really know each other, so you get to see quite different sides of the story, even different ways of mentality. I expected mature themes and I wasn't disappointed. Political corruption, criminality, blunt violence. Yet, all of these are depicted in a serious manner and they are not gratuitous. It's hard to achieve that.

For those who wonder about difficulty, I say that it's not hard for veteran adventure players, but the creativity of the puzzles ideas will keep you going.

Overall, even though the soundtrack isn't as amazing as i expected but still good, there is no real minus for this game. It would worth every cent for such a strong storyline-gameplay bond. It's also replaylable because of the achievements that are only unlocked by taking different choices in the plot or solve a few situations in another way.

The only Wadjet Eye game that's longer is Resonance.

When it comes to character chemistry, your mileage may vary. The voice acting direction feels pretty loose - as if the majority of it was intended for a Blackwell game. The intensity and focus of character from Gemini Rue is not present here, unfortunately.

The future isn’t quite as progressive as it should be. People can’t find jobs because most services are automated by a singular computer system named, Central. Humans are raised by the city and molded by it, they can either become successful or sponges trapped in the thrall of the internet.  There are some high notes in there like acceptable gene manipulation from man to woman, and racial hatred seems to be a thing of the past. However zealotry, hacking, government spying, war, and terrorism have all gotten worse than we can ever imagine.

Technobabylon bounces between many distinct characters similar to the film “Crash.” The story revolves around the actions of a shady group of criminals who manipulate a police officer into making some questionable choices, and the attempted termination of an otherwise uninteresting woman living in the slums. The mystery goes beyond those two and slips into the lives of other citizens in the city, as each layer is peeled from this clandestine group.

High points

Deep and engrossing – Technobabylon is a well-written cyberpunk adventure game with a knack for fleshing out its world via descriptive storytelling. For a game that looks like it was made in the early 90’s, it comes to life with witty dialogue, interesting characters, and believable explanations of technology that would impress William Gibson. It easily articulates the impact of humans allowing technological advances to get out of control and effectively rule them.

It paints a picture of a future full of genetic-manipulation, synthetic love, curable diseases, news outlets corrupted by corporations, and wars that are waged not just on the ground but also in the mind. If this were a novel, it could easily be a best seller among the Science-Fiction crowd.

Fun characters and puzzles – Charlie and the gang, will interact with some interesting programs and synthetics in the city. I thought I had accidently turned on Discworld or Monkey Island after interacting with the various wacky programs in and out of the Trance. Most of the characters can be outright hilarious amongst an otherwise grim world. The interactions are only highlighted by intelligent puzzle design that refuses to force us into spamming random objects. The title gives plenty of hints to allow us to look at a situation logically, understand it, and complete the puzzle.

Latha can interact with terminals and drift into the Trance to use programs and manipulation to hack the internet. Charlie and Max will find reasonable ways to discover clues, and hack into the brains of synthetics to twist their personalities to something more helpful. As much as I love The Walking Dead, I think this game properly demonstrates how to create meaningful gameplay, while also providing us with a stimulating tale.

Hard Choices & Cold Outcomes – While it’s nothing like Mass Effect in terms of sheer volume of decision making, each of the available choices are not to be selected on a whim. No matter how well intentioned a choice may be, it is always countered by a consequence. You may not feel the immediate sting of what you’ve done, but eventually the game will let you understand the weight of it. This game doesn’t mind making you feel like a terrible person after your judgment calls.

Visual Discrepancy – In the early build that I’ve played, I’ve noticed that the visuals take a jarring leap between clean 16-bit graphics in the trance, and grimy looking pixels in the “real” world. I’m sure this is a stylistic choice by the development team, and I respect them for it, but it comes off as a bit jarring. I also noticed that characters are always speaking in the Trance, but in the real world their lips will only move in special sequences. It’s a small issue that dilutes the atmosphere of this otherwise immersive world.

Low Points

Technical Issues – There are a few bugs in the build I played but nothing that negatively affected gameplay. I did notice that the game crashes trying to Alt-Tab, or refuses to even start if you have a multi-monitor setup. I did notice that the game stopped Auto-saving on some levels, so be sure to manually save when you can. Hopefully all these issues will be ironed out by the time the game releases.

Conclusion

Technobabylon may not be a visual and technical marvel, but the story and immersive dialogue creates a believable Science Fiction world. If you’re a fan of cyberpunk books or the classic Blade Runner film, you’ll absolutely adore the detailed and brutal storyline of Technobabylon. I recommend that you buy this game at full price if you’re an adventure fan, or even if you’re a person that just loves great storytelling. Technocrat and Wadjet Eye Games did a fantastic job, and I still can’t believe these are the same people that made a game called “Nancy: The Happy Whore.”

It is completely true and unmanipulated, yet highly subjective from someone who loves adventure games in general and the WEG adventures so far in particular.

Technobabylon is, depending on your preferred taste in setting, the best Point & Click adventure Wadjet Eye Games ever put on the market. It can only be surpassed by the complete Blackwell experience if you like the ghost story more than Cyberpunk. Technobabylon easily snatches the summit of adventure games away from even the highly praised Gemini Rue, and a welcome release for everyone disappointed by Broken Ages final release.

With this out of the way, I’ll try to get into the positive points without destroying the experience trough spoilers. Technobabylon takes place in Newton, a cliché Cyberpunk City in the 21th century. It’s controlled by a sentient AI called Central who not only manages electricity and water but also the police. In this town, a between-jobs internet addict and two high-ranking police officers get sucked into a mass murderer case that seems to rip the information out of their victims brains. In the end, one might find that the whole cliché Newton presents is not quite what it seemed, and Technobabylon might have played with your expectations all along…

The graphics are superb – if you like the characteristic artstyle of Ben Chandlers, who’s responsible for all of Wadjet Eyes graphics. The game, while not being developed but only published by WEG received much help from Ben in terms of style, that is for certain. The animations are a little stiff while walking, but the gestures and animations of characters in dialogues are great and really set the mood. The music is alright – nothing fancy, but fitting for the black-and-neon world Newton provides.

Gameplay is very classic, but in a very refreshing way, especially for Wadjet Eye. While most of their earlier adventures have a focus on dialogues and riddles to progress the story, Technobabylon has a huge amount of item and inventory puzzles.This depends on the character you are currently controlling – the old techophobe police officer depends more on the good old use-fishing rod-with-magnet style of play than the internet addict who just hacks all systems she can get her hands on. This really helps differentiate the characters and is, plainly, really fun. The puzzles are very intuitive, though – no Grim Fandango “How the f’ would I have guessed that moments” in here. 

Overall, if you have the slightest interest in adventure games, go get Technobabylon. It’s one of the best out there developed in modern times.

While its gameplay is classic point and click, Technobabylon’s writing, characters, and story are presented with a 21st century focus. The cyberpunk city of Newton is well-fleshed out and does an excellent job of providing coloration even on the parts you don’t see. There are some relatively unique ideas, as well as some good implementations that help make it stand out in different ways.

When it comes together, Technobablyon is a very nice adventure game with only a few flaws – the graphics sometimes don’t quite work, the puzzles on a few occasions get away from logic, and the story has only a few points that make you frown on minor bits. However, it bears the trappings of its genre in many ways and that makes it a difficult game to score because if you aren’t interested in adventure games, if you don’t have patience, and you don’t want to experience a well-written narrative where you solve puzzles on the go, it isn’t something that will interest you.

I will say though, if you like Adventure games, this is something you definitely want to check out!

Technobabylon brings the experience of the old LucasArts games to the new day with updated themes and more modern social issues. The game hits themes of the Internet and the social stigma behind it, governmental control, and the human condition. The writing is pretty well done with strong work done in terms of the dialogue between characters, as you have reasons to actually listen to everyone and talk to them. The games puzzles are hit and miss. Some puzzles will make you feel like a real detective in how you solved the problem, and rewarded paying attention. Some puzzles on the other hands suffer from the old point + click adventures basic problem of not knowing exactly what it wants from you, and contextual item use. In the end, those who like sci-fi+control plots will really enjoy the experience that's here.

+:
[list]
[*] Great dialogue work done here as the writing isn't forced, and flows naturally. Dialogue between characters plays to their personality strengths, and makes you want to find out what they have to say.
[*] In addition, secondary dialogue and repeated dialogue options in particular were pretty fun to listen to, especially with the elements of the Trance in there. 
[*]Good variety of environments and made me appreciate the art style even more. Despite being set in the future, there was a great sense of difference within the world controlled by the AI.
[*] The strongest puzzles in the game give a reasonable sense of accomplishment and a feeling of a real detective when completing them. 
[*] Some heavy themes are hit here, and some character depth really is brought to the forefront in terms of those themes. Emotional connections were strong in this game, especially if you have someone IRL you can relate to. 
[*] Solid voice acting all around (with an occassional misstep).
[/list]

-:
[list]
[*] Some puzzles are really suffering from the old school point and click adventure syndrome. You will get stuck if you don't pay attention specifically to the contextual clicks. 
[*] Too many subplots at time really muddy the water in terms of the overall story, and could have maybe eliminated one or two to focus on the bigger plots.
[*] Felt like hint system in terms of dialogue sometimes sent you in the wrong direction. 
[*] A personal point in terms of games that crash when you alt+tab.
[/list]

Completely unrelated to overall review list but is worth a mention:
[list]
[*] For some reason, Nvidia shadowplay's recording icon decided to show up for some reason, maybe with the weird way that the resolution is put on the screen.
