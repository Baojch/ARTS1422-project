Il est clair qu'Higschool Romance n'est pas vraiment mon style de jeu... Comment ce fait-il donc qu'il soit dans ma biblioth√®que....? M√™me moi je me pose encore la question en vrais... Lorsque j'ai voulu am√©liorer mon badge Subnautica en fusionnant les cartes steam, j'ai remarqu√© que l'on obtenait des bons de r√©duction de 66%. Parmi les quelques bons de ce type que j'ai obtenus, il n'y avait que Higschool Romance de ""potable"" on va dire... Et comme je voulais tester cette m√©canique, que je n'avais jamais essay√© auparavant, j'ai pris celui l√†. Bien sur ensuite, √©tant perfectionniste et ayant pay√© mon jeu, malgr√© la forte r√©duction, je l'ai tout de m√™me test√© et fini.

Verdict :
Alors... Hmmm... Que dire XD... Je crois que c'est assez compliqu√© pour moi de juger de ce genre de jeu, n'y √©tant pas tr√®s habitu√©. Je crois que le plus simple serait de r√©sumer mes quelques impression par ceci : Pour six moments ""Haha"" (que je qualifierait √©galement de moment agr√©ablement dr√¥les voir humoristiques), j'ai relev√© vingt quatre moments ""Oskour"" (que je qualifierait √©galement de moments cringes et malaisants)... Les moments malaisants relevaient d'une certaine situation de crosdressing du personnage principal, de r√©flexions sur le genre (heureusement jamais pouss√©es trop dans ce que je n'aime pas, cela aurait √©t√© red flag sinon...) et d'une certaine inclinaison de la principale du coll√®ge √† √™tre totalement d√©rang√©e XD (notamment vu son statut et celui de son √©l√®ve, ainsi que la diff√©rence d'age, de m√™me que pour son inclinaison prononc√©e pour les jeunes gar√ßons qui s'habillent en filles). Ironiquement et √ßa me fais bizarre de devoir l'admettre, c'est probablement la romance avec la principale qui est, il faut le reconna√Ætre, la plus... excitante des trois... Le jeu, dans son style, fait donc ce que l'on attend de lui en v√©rit√© et ce serait malhonn√™te de ma part d'en attendre plus, mais je pense que je m'abstiendrais de tester les recomandations de steams avec ces coupons hasardeux √† l'avenir XD.

A brief slice of life, cross-dressing romance story with a sprinkle of comedy.

An initially forced cross-dressing at an all-girl school and some consequences of it serve as the main theme of this title. It's mainly a light slice of life romance within a typical school setting feeling similar to other stories of that type. Nothing unusual or surprising happens here. Writing is pretty straightforward but decent and I enjoyed it for the most part. This VN is short so there is little chance it will get boring before you finish it. Three different endings provide some replayability. 

The character art is hit or miss, I think. It has a distinct western character with a hint of anime style. I'm not a big fan of it but it has an ok quality. There are only a few charcter sprites and variations but it's reasonable considering the budget. Simple backgrounds and interface match the overall style.

Music is pretty standard and mostly fits the events. There were a few moments when I found the accompanying track a bit weird. I felt it was not matching the mood of a scene. No songs or voice acting here. Nothing really memorable either, just ok.

No issues encountered.

To summarize, a short, decently written slice of life at school story with some western style art and average music. It might be worth reading if that is your type. Can recommend: 5.5/10",1612026935,1612026935,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Overall I liked the characters, the setting and basically all of the actual like story based stuff. Even if the premise is a bit weird, as a person in the Trans community it was really interesting playing a Shoji in their situation. My favourite has just gotta be Selina though, no questions asked.

a couple notes?
- all the characters are cute! i love the art and character design. im pretty sure i actually watched a lets play of this years ago, and the art and design have always stuck out to me. its very soft and pleasing to the eye.
- the ui, however, is more than a little tacky. i mean, the title screen looks like something out of a generic flash game... this isnt necessarily a bad thing, but its one of those things that makes the game feel a lot ""cheaper"" so to speak.
- i cannot for the life of me tell where this vn takes place. i mean, a lot of the scenery, the uniforms, the festival, ""shoji"" and ""hoshi"", make me think japan, but then weve got ""selina"" and the principal ""lea rowen"" and the fact that high school is four years long instead of three.
- i found the writing to be mostly progressive in terms of understanding things like gender identity, selina thinking shoji may be trans, etc., but having this as well as the semi-frequent ""boys are innately stronger than girls"", ""it would be weird for a girl to like video games"", etc. line of thinking felt kind of contradictory and off. i dunno, maybe i was reading too much into it, but it was very distracting to me.
- i think selina is the cutest girl! hoshi is cute, too! (shoji is the cutest boy!) the principal route felt awkward to me? idk

The protagonist gets sent to all girls school by accident.  He decides the best option is to fit in by cross-dressing his way throughout the school year.   There are 3 love interests that each have their own ending.  This game has many awkward and funny moments in it which is why I enjoyed it.  I recommend following the walkthrough in the guides section because that seemed to be the best way to get all 4 achievements going by how each ending turned out.

The most basic story isn't anything that hasn't been done before (A boy going to an all girls school and pretending to be a girl) but it does execute it very well.  One of the reviews I read had said that there were possible transgender components to the story but I wouldn't really go that far.  There is one discussion at one point about if the main character is trans* but their answer is no.  That's not a bad thing per say but I do feel like that review was misleading and since that factor had played a role in me deciding to purchase this game I felt it deserved to be mentioned.

Pros:
    -Quality graphics with well written text.  There are a few typos and grammatical errors but a lot fewer then normal visual novels.
    -Interesting and likable characters.  Most Visual Novels I've played have had at least one main character that I've had very little interest in interacting with but all of the characters in this one were ones that I wanted to interact with.
    -Mostly logical choices.  Yeah, I'll admit I had to check a completion guide occasionally especially in the beginning but I'd say that most of the choices you make actually made sense in context of the story.

Cons:
    -Only three characters to interact with.
    -Fairly short play through.  The first time through took me about 2 to 3 hours.  The second and third time through took significantly less, probably more like 30 minutes due to how much content is shared between the three different story lines.

I only have 2 complaints - one is that the player character looks awful in most expression images but keeps getting complimented on his looks. The other is that the story's set up so that the player is one of the girls' only friend, and has to abandon her to pursue either of the others. Makes me feel guilty when I play the other routes.

Still, I frequently found myself with a big dumb smile on my face while playing, so I can overlook the faults and heartily give it a recommendation.

Personalmente, el √∫nico inconveniente, es el hecho de que casi todo el juego est√° desarrollado en un ambiente muy brillante, lo cual, la verdad, no lo recomiendo para aquellas personas que, como yo suele jugar en las noches, ya que, cansa demasiado la vista y puede llegar a deslumbrar bastante. Para poder obtener una mejor experiencia de juego, tuve que reducir los niveles de brillo y contraste a mi monitor, y para ser sincero, no fue suficiente.

Game is C+ level at best.  No nudity/sex, and no ""banging the principle"", just a text implication at one point that you spend the night with her.  Multiple lazy scenes art-wise: characters say they will change, then simply re-appear with the same clothes.  Short game overall, with maybe 10 choices per playthrough (and some of the choices don't even make a difference, you are forced into situation A whether you chose A or B).  Story can be cute, but overall not much going on, and one of the 3 endings highly disappointed me.

[b] A Promising VN That Takes No Risks, Goes Nowhere, And Ends Up Feeling Empty [/b]

This game was pretty disappointing. The premise sounded ridiculous, yet at least gave some potential for an interesting storyline filled with drama and secrecy. Instead, it ends up being a forgettable two hour story that play like many other visual novels. The whole game revolves around the premise of cross dressing in order to be able to attend an all-girls boarding school, and yet there is barely anything explored within the game. All that is discussed are stereotypes of girls, and the traditional anime-style schticks are shoved in for full effect: you have your older, authority-driven love interest; your nerdy bookworm love interest; and your athletic yet immature love interest. None of these characters are fleshed out, and the game serves as a cookie cutter visual novel masquerading as a more interesting, dramatic look at a wacky scenario. It left me pretty dissatisfied, and I would [b] Not Recommend [/b] many people to pick this this title up.

The game is really short and easy to beat. You can finish it in about 2 to 3 hours, if you were to read everything (excluding repeats). The characters are cute and it's your typical dating sim game. Honestly, this dating sim could be a lot better if there were more routes or if there were voices. The CGs were banging and I did grow to like the characters ;) (even if they were all annoying in their own way).

CONS.
Although the graphics and story line were decent, I felt like the price for this game is not worth it. Also, the story seemed a bit too rushed. I wished there was a gift giving mechanism incorporated or a bad end/normal end. It seemed too easy with how quickly you can get the girl and see them half-naked.

Actually [b] High School Romance [/b].
Basically Its a graphic novel.
The story tells about a guy named Shogi ,who by misleading gets attended into a All-Girl Boarding School. (Yes the game plot touches Transsexual thematic to MY greatest surprize. I didnt know about it till I played it.) And while in there and pretending to be a girl she meets three, able to romance girls. [b] SELINA [/b] (All into sports blondie, always cheery and pokey) [b] HOSHI [/b] (The class rep. Brunette, glasses , modest and humble) and [b] LEA [/b] (a.k.a Mrs. Rowen, The Principal and most ''playful'' of all three.) It takes you through the story and to make the decision to which one you (Shoji) are going to end up with. Now that we've made the setting lemme tell you the [b] Pros [/b] and [b] Cons	[/b] of it.

[b] +PROS+[/b]
+)The setting is nice. The images and art of the game are pleasant to the eye.
+)The conversations and the characters arent boring, It really intrigued me to play further and find out whats gonna happen next
+)The pr0n element is minimal (This might be a con for you If youre a Hentai lova) and It all goes down to simple dress ups and making out. Tops.
+) (PERSONAL) As a transsexual myself, I really found the game... Cute. I enjoyed it.

[b]-CONS-[/b].
-) The plot is too ''naive''. The setting and the first act is waaay too similar to the plots from very ''famous genre''. This game definetly has it's targeted auditon. No competition between the ''dates'' for the main character. There is one between Selina and Hoshi... but its too light.
-) Plot is also very Linear. There might be totally 10 dialogue options within the whole game. and except the 3 different endings... the 2 of them (Selina and Hoshi) are almost identical, being like the opposites of each other. Lea is exclusive in this point.
-) Its too short for such price. I bought it with a coupon discount.. but still... Its too much.

Overall. 
Im happy with the purchase (feel a bit robbed) but still... I enjoyed this little story, the SETTING mostly and the characters. Never gonna forget them, and that 7 hours that Ive spent in this game. Happy with the purchase thats all.

and remember...
Always Bet On Blue.

Overall the Game is enjoyable and I do recommend it, however it is too expensive for only around 3 hours playtime and the Game really is missing H-Content. At least in my opinion the Game could be a lot better with some nice tasteful H-Scenes and a little bit of a longer Afterstory for all the Girls.

I will still rate it a 7/10 overall, as it is decent and wont be boring or anything.
For sure only buy it if you get it for a cheaper price though.

PROS: Where the story is something that's been told multiple times before, they try not to go the traditional routes with this type of idea.  They do take some time to focus on the characters, and it is welcome, as it fleshes them out a fair bit to give them some personality.  The art style definitely won't be for everyone, but it is something different.

CONS: The game moves at a bit too fast of a pace, diving through the entire semester a little quickly.  There isn't any voice acting as well.  And even though the character's name and portrait comes up, the only way to tell the difference between internal thoughts and speech is to make sure the text isn't in italics.  The soundtrack is rather hit or miss, some charming stuff, but mostly forgettable.

ACHIEVEMENTS: A quick 4 that are gotten by going for the good endings.  You'll get them all just playing for them with relative ease.

FINAL: For a relatively worn idea in VN's, I actually enjoyed playing through this, mainly due to the characters.  Though it was a nice take on it, and I would recommend at least one playthrough if one is looking for a simple VN, I still don't see myself dropping back in for another playthrough.

It's not a bad game overall, but there are so many small issues that didn't sit right with me and I can't suggest anyone try this game who actually wants something of decent value.

The plot itself sounds like a cheesy anime story, and does fairly well on that front. Due to an enrollment mistake by his busy parents, Shoji accidentally gets enrolled in an all-girls school and is forced to keep his identity a secret in order to finish his final year of high school. While not a bad plot, even if a slightly cliched one, the biggest issue here is that it doesn't really matter. When I say this, I mean that in the different endings the different characters (minor spoiler)[spoiler]make it clear they knew all along and just don't care[/spoiler]. To me, even for a cheesy comedy, that's beyond unrealistic, and decreases the story value immediately.

When it comes down to it, Highschool Romance is not a $13 visual novel, so if you do have a curiousity to sate with this game at least get it on a very good sale. The run time comes to a couple hours, with the choices barely changing the plot up until the endings. Events still happen much the same way, no matter who you pick. There's an illusion of choice through a linear story, with branching paths only splitting off at the ends. I've read free visual novels who have multiple different endings with uniquely varied content, as well as doing more with similar run times.

By far the biggest sore point is one of the routes themselves, that of the high school student and the principal. Sure, you can swing it that someone in their last year of high school is probably 18, but the route itself comes off as cringy at best. While the other routes have some sort of ""equal"" interaction between the main character and the interests mutually getting to know each other, the principal route comes off as predatory [spoiler]as they're seen in dressing rooms together without Shoji's prior knowledge and agreement, and the principal taking Shoji over to her house during break[/spoiler]. It stood out to me by far as the worst route of the game, and soured my view of the rest of the story.

I'll admit I liked the more rounded and cozy art style, fresh as it was to see a visual novel not distinctly ""anime"" in looks. However, it all feels very bland with the characters looking much of the same, except for minor changes like outfits, hair and eyes. The backgrounds felt very flat in tone and blended together in a weird sort of way, almost as if there were no light and shadow. It's visually nice to look at, but there's room for some improvements in the future.

When it comes to games like this, sometimes too much is just too much. A few low points don't make or break a game until they stack on so heavily it's hard to look past. If you can see past the poor choice in the way the story was told, maybe there's something here for you to enjoy. It's not something I can see myself recommending, just for the way the content was handled.",1546366527,1546366527,False,6,0,0.544813811779022217,0,False,False,False,False,,,

He never had enough time to create real friendships, but this year, it‚Äôs the very final year of high school, and as always, Shoji is sent to a school while his parents are away. Nothing out of the ordinary, except‚Ä¶ The school his mother sent him, is a girl-only institution. One of the best nonetheless, but still, an issue considering Shoji is a perfectly normal and healthy young man.

Lea, the school‚Äôs principal, comes up with the idea of maintaining Shoji in the school, by making him pass as a girl throughout the year. Won‚Äôt be easy, but with a few tips, a new hairstyle and some light makeup, Shoji can pass as a girl, and the plan is in motion. Can Shoji make friends even though he is secretly a boy? Or will his shy personality stop him from getting close to any of the girls in his class?

[b]Highschool Romance[/b] is the fourth game developed and published by [i]Dharker Studio[/i], with an interesting plot that we rarely get to see in a Visual Novel. Most fans either expect this to be a romantic comedy, or a dating game tagged with Trap, Crossdressing or even Futanari all over it, but worry not, as this is a simple and funny romantic comedy.

Plot moves around Shoji trying to deal with his new temporary identity, clothing and behavior near other female students. Players interact with three different girls, as possible dates. Lea is one of them, a somehow older woman who fantasises with Shoji in several cosplay items.¬†Students Selina and Hoshi, are also romantic dates, each very different from the other. Selina is a popular athlete, while Hoshi is a bookworm at heart, and both represent different paths for Shoji to romantically get involved through friendship and trust. There are several events where one must choose who to be with, lunch, school activities and special weekends with that special girl are some of the choices that will result in the inevitable ending.

As gameplay goes, players can expect a traditional Visual Novel with key decisions that determine the ending routes, along this three hour adventure. With humour and light emotions attached to characters, [b]Highschool Romance[/b] does not have an adult patch, and it‚Äôs not sexualized entirely, however, it‚Äôs extremely erotic when comes to flirting and fantasies such as Cosplay, in which are heavily present.

Technically the game is presented with great quality, even if upscaled to 1920x1080 or higher. Renders don‚Äôt lose significant quality, and as usual for [i]Dharker Studio[/i] games, the visual quality holds up. [b]Highschool Romance[/b] it‚Äôs only available in English and contrary to the game prior to this one, we don‚Äôt get to have voice-acting, but the dialogues and literacy remain as good as ever.

Each character has its own personality, and its deep rooted in their behavior towards our protagonist. Some, such as Lea or Selina, are more flirty and it is reflected in the choices players can adopt. In some specific moments, scenes end periodically to soon, and advance towards another very different scene, pushing forward particular moments too soon.¬†This only happens a handful of times, and even if doesn‚Äôt leave lacunas in the storyline, it‚Äôs still rare to see this behavior in previous Visual Novels by the studio. Nonetheless the game is well directed and is presented with a distinct order of events, never compromising the experience or plot. Dialogues are extremely smart, engaging and captivating, which is rare to see!

[b]Highschool Romance[/b] follows an optimistic and positive artwork, with pleasant backgrounds that although are simplistic and basic, set well within the game‚Äôs plot and momentum. Every situation, location and event have its own space, maintaining the artwork atmosphere intact.¬†Characters are designed as it‚Äôs already common among [i]Dharker Studios[/i] releases, through a more western style. Every character style has a very distinct look, and although they have some emphasized body shapes, they still have a very cartoonish outlook, that somehow fit perfectly with the humoristic characteristics of the game.

Cutscenes are displayed with special drawing pictures representing a special key moment in the game. They improve in the details, but at the same time preserving their style, which is the most important thing. Overall appeals are nice, such as the menus and text colors, especially because each different character has a unique text color, making it fun to read.

As soundtrack goes, [b]Highschool Romance[/b] is one of the weakest releases by [i]Dharker Studios[/i]. The soundtrack is not available for purchase, but in-game music tracks are simple and serve the only purpose of creating the necessary ambience, to avoid the uncomfortable background silence of not having a soundtrack at all. Compared to other games such as [b]Beach Bounce[/b] or [b]Divine Slice of Life[/b], the soundtrack in this title is uninspiring. The handful of tracks seems to keep on a loop depending on the scenes, ranging from neo-classic tunes in a modern approach, with still the typical upbeat and nice atmosphere regardless.

In a less sexualized context, and with no nudity, [b]Highschool Romance[/b] still manages to become sexy and interesting for those looking for a naughty escapade. Yet, it‚Äôs the romantic element that brings this game to the spotlight, with its comicality events, and the overall mess that our protagonist got himself into. A fantastic game with a very unique storyline and artwork that will definitely please anyone looking for a casual and funny Visual Novel.",1535586005,1535586005,True,5,0,0.540134549140930176,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The story was told through the eyes of a guy in an all girls school who has no past experience with being personal with one. So the writing played up the stereotypes for some of the jokes and while it could be seen as a little tasteless it shows character's background of inexperience. It shouldn't be a deal breaker as the stereotypes appear and dissapear pretty quickly and aren't played up to much. The three love interests are written in a way that makes sense and has heavy characteristics showing through that are pretty common for a high school style thing. Selina the athletic type, Hoshi the study, and Lea the motherly type. Again the stereotypes aren't played up to the point of annoyance just to the point to where you don't forget you are in a high school. Before I get to the art style, I have to say that Selina had a progressive moment with the main character and I enjoyed the inclusion of it. The art is nice all the way through and I never got tired of it. Eventually I found the button that hides the text and I got to see one of the characters (Lea I belive) whole and I laughed a little bit. I checked the other two characters and I found that it wasn't a simple character trait but an epidemic.

Highschool (sic) Romance is a visual novel set at a private school.  The main character is a boy sent to the school by his parents, only to find out the admission policy changed, and that the school is now an all-female institution of learning.  For reasons unknown, the principal of the school decides to admit the main character, but transvestize him to fit in for whatever reason.  Along the way, the main character encounters two other girls in addition to the principal.  Expecting more people to be encountered?  I know I was.

Graphics and sound:

Highschool Romance cuts so many corners, the programmers would be better suited for making globes.  The main thing that really stood out to me, was that gym class was being held outdoors, and yet the graphic on screen was the stock picture of the gymnasium:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137937624

I should have taken a closer look at the graphics when I got Highschool Romance, but for some odd reason, it wasn't until I got in game, that I noticed that every female in the game looks like they have a Hapsburg jaw.  In fact, the jaws are even more pronounced on the females than the male character, which may explain why the principal thought the main character could pass for female.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137933234

I was also disappointed by a scene in which another character attempts to put makeup on the main character, yet all you're treated to, is the same stock picture of the main character and his Plain Jane face.  Not even the tiny picture of the main character features him wearing makeup, yet you would think that such a scene was big enough to warrant a full sized screenshot.

The sound is nothing special.  The music isn't my style, but it's a letdown in the sense that it doesn't help set the mood of the game, which should be the be all, end all for a game's soundtrack.  There's very little sound effects to speak of, and none that stand out.

Positives:

Although the idea of transvestized (and sex changed) anime boys is nothing new, I did have a lot of fun with the concept of this game earlier on.  I was really humored in the beginning when the principal takes the main character shopping for girl's clothes.  It's obvious that shopping trip was designed by a man, because there was a lengthy trip for lingerie shopping.  (My personal favorite part of the game.)  But absolutely no mention was made of buying shoes.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137933725

Negatives:

The main character is in a school full of girls, and yet only three other people seem to exist.  The only interesting thing about the trio, is that they have Hapsburg jaws.  They're merely just stock characters masquerading as major characters with no interesting details or personality quirks about them.  The athletic girl in the game has the same physical attributes as every other athletic girl in Anime (including warrior women):  Her arms and legs are just as lacking in muscle as every other female in the game (or movie), and her breasts have the same amount of fat as every other non-athletic girl.

I'll admit to being suckered into those tags on Steam that infer Highschool Romance has nudity and mature content.  Both of these were lacking.  I was thinking that maybe I should play through the game again and see if there's any other path that offers nude scenes, but I lost interest in the game soon afterwards.  Just as well, because I noticed that all of the ""interesting"" pictures from the game are online outside of Steam, anyway, and I saw none that contained nudity.

Adult content aside, when a game has the word ""Romance"" in the title, I don't expect anything less.  The kissing I saw in the one path I took was just that; kissing without substance.  I felt no sort of attachment to the girl that the main character was kissing, and I'm sure the rest of the girls would have been equally disappointing.  No dialogue to infer how much in love both characters were with one another, zero passion in the pictures involving ""love,"" and really, absolutely no sense of beauty in intimacy.

Conclusion:

The game would have been more aptly labeled ""High School Transvestism,"" since it's an even bigger point of the game than the romance.  But I've learned my lesson:  Don't pay more than a dollar for a game that has only four achievements!",1505787284,1505803609,False,10,1,0.502872467041015625,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Backing out now would be a costly process that would delay him from graduating on time with his class, fortunately, the principal has a solution to this strange crisis...pretend to be a girl in order to attend. You soon discover that what would have been a ""dream-come-true"" to many a male student is actually a lot more complicated. In this unusual situation, can you survive, make friends, or even find love? Highschool Romance is a light hearted V.N. full of teen angst and hilarious situations.

Graphically, this visual novel is a wonderful delight to the eyes and has a top notch presentation just as all of Dharker Studios V.N.'s do. It has a manga-inspired artstyle that is extremely gorgeous and filled with bright colors as well as beautiful effects. Also of note is the fantastic audio quality and a quite memorable soundtrack which is delightful and fits the story perfectly. In summary, the excellent visuals and terrific aurals do a great job of complimenting the outrageous yet intriguing plot of Highschool Romance.

This novel was a great read with endearing art and a very well written if not whimsical story. There are many decisions to make and multiple endings so the replayability is fairly high. Also, this V.N. offers a few options such as an image gallery to unlock as the narrative progresses, there are also Steam Achievements and Steam Trading cards to collect.

Highschool Romance √® una Visual Novel incentrata sul crossdressing, tema piuttosto raro. Il nostro protagonista, Shoji, infatti viene trasferito in una nuova scuola... peccato che sia solo per ragazze. Consigliato dalla preside e facendo di necessit√† virt√π, decide di travestirsi da ragazza potendo cos√¨ frequentare la scuola per non perdere troppo tempo e rischiare di restare indietro con l'istruzione. 

La storia si focalizza poi sulla vita quotidiana dello studente- pardon, della studentessa e delle sue amiche, Selina e Hoshi, cercando di non far trapelare nulla sulla sua reale identit√†.

E purtroppo questo era l'unico aspetto positivo del gioco, ovvero il tema del crossdressing, un tema raramente usato. Ma per il resto, la storia si presenta molto leggera e spensierata, si finisce tranquillamente nel giro di un'ora/un'ora e mezza e presenta 3 finali differenti.

Inoltre ho trovato lo stile grafico un po'... meh. Non l'ho apprezzato molto, forse perch√© sono troppo abituato allo stile giapponese delle visual novel mentre questo qua mi sembra un pasticcio tra lo stile occidentale e giapponese.

Ora magari direte ""eh ma c'√® il contenuto erotico!"". 

No. Steam adotta una politica un po' severa sui contenuti sessuali e anche se i dev e i modders aggirano ci√≤ grazie all'utilizzo di patch e mods, questo gioco non presenta nessuna patch 18+. Per cui la componente erotica √®...minima. Le ragazze (si, incluso anche il nostro caro travestito) potremo ammirarle solo in biancheria intima al massimo. Tuttavia considerando che non ho apprezzato lo stile grafico...

In conclusione, mi ha deluso. L'ho preso in un bundle, ma personalmente, considerato il prezzo, anche in saldo, non lo comprerei singolarmente.

‚òë You play as a boy who pretends to be a boy because ""he has no choice"" (there is explenation in story, but for me it makes no sens and is just... so dumb)
‚òë Through the entire game you are able to talk ONLY to 3 girls (which one of them is only avaiable via picking very specific options) but technically it's JUST 2
‚òë These woman are crazy over you, they act like they alredy know that you have the one and only penis at the campus couse they are so... Sticky. I mean like they want your attencion, spend with you a lot of time and so on. This is unnatural. Well, it seems like it in this game (not because I know MCH is boy)
‚òë AND one of them is even SCHOOL PRINCIPAL (Lea, the sercret avaiable one) with whom you can END UP GETTING MARRIED
‚òë Not a lot of arts as for game that swivel mostly around 3 (with main character) people

[b]Final verdict:[/b] ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 
6/10 - Above Average 
The art style of the game isn't pleasing to me personally but I suppose it isn't entirely unsightly. The backgrounds are decent even if occasionally it's obvious they didn't pay that much attention to what they were using with dialogue (for example, main character talks about being exercising outside while they are clearly inside the gym). Music is simple and repetitive, but not distracting. The game is short and relatively easy to 100% if you care about that, and the plot isn't complicated while managing to stay interesting. 

First of all, this game doesn't come with any restoration patches because the game itself doesn't have any H-content. If this is what you are looking for in your visual novel then you can skip this title, the most you are going to get is few shots of undergarments and even then the situations never go anywhere lewd. This can be disappointing since the game would offer some nice fetish fodder if it was willing to go there, but I digress. 

For those who'd want to pick this up because of girl-on-girl romance, that's not something that is present. As the description for the game states, this visual novel is about a male protagonist in an all-girls school. He is forced to crossdress and even if you are one who'd think you could play it while imagining that he's a girl, that's unlikely as the main character keeps reminding the player about his gender through the entire VN. If you want girl love, then you can't find (or pretend to find) it here.

As stated, the plot revolves around Shoji, a boy who is mistakenly admitted into an all-girls school and at the encouragement of the principal he agrees to dress up as a girl in order to be able to stay at the school. As a protagonist Shoji is a decent and unsure person, his main worry is being found out and he never comes across as a creep. The story revolves around Shoji's relationship with two girls his age, as well as the principal if you make the right choices that will include her in the story line. His relationship with the two main girls, Selina and Hoshi, is based on friendship for the majority of the game and his romantic interest seems to rise only when the girls themselves bring it to the table.

There is definitely a pacing issue in this game and the end of the game comes really suddenly, making it feel like the devs rushed it or simply gave up on the project. This comes from the fact that majority of the beginning was spent building Shoji's friendship with the girls, and once the romantic advances were introduced the game just takes a beeline to the epilogue, which can make the entire experience unsatisfactory. Before getting to a couple words on each girl's route, I wanted to make a note that you can get bad endings in this. In my first playthrough I ended up getting turned down when I thought I was keeping a friendly relationship to Hoshi while obviously going for Selina. 

Now couple words about the girls themselves, in the order that I cleared them.
[b]Selina[/b] ‚Äì Admittedly I knew I was going for her immediately, just based on her looks. Her personality can either be endearing or downright irritating, and even though I generally liked her, the bad ending with her did make me resent her just a tiny bit. She's definitely an interesting character, and her banter with Shoji is fun. 
[b]Hoshi[/b] ‚Äì  She was definitely less consistent in personality than Selina was, but I have to say I was surprised that I found her to be sweet toward the end. However she never stroke me personally as anything other than the best friend type, so I didn't like having Shoji end up with her but that's probably because I'm not partial to meganekko types.
[b]Lea[/b] ‚Äì I wasn't going to do her route at all because I don't see the appeal in the set up, but I decided to do it for the sake of this review. She was definitely the trickiest ending to get, and I just didn't see it as worth it. 

Now, all three girls were nice but nothing groundbreaking so why did I enjoy this game as much as I did? In addition to the protagonist, I liked that the girls were friendly with each other even when competing. There was very minimal drama involved in this game, which I found to be refreshing. This was also one of the very rare occasions when I wish there had been an option for harem ending, because I enjoyed the chemistry Selina and Hoshi had with each other, so I would've welcomed the chance to have them be together.",1490489601,1490489601,True,18,0,0.680222153663635254,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The 3 girls are interesting, and the writing is pretty self-aware and funny. Then there's also the lovely art style.

If you were looking for a game with GxG pairings (like I was), then you're outta luck. But the protagonist's gender identity is examined and there are some (respectful) lgbt+ mentions and aspects. I can't say much without spoiling anything, but an example would be the girls' sexualities. There's no ""I'd be really into you if you were a boy..."" or ""I think I have feelings for you... b-but we're both girls!"" None of that. These girls don't play around.

Highschool Romance is another high-school-themed anime visual novel from Dharker Studio. 

You play Shoji, an 'effete-looking' boy who is incorrectly sent by his always-travelling parents to a prestigious boarding school, which happens to be girls only. After discovering the error Lea Rowen, the young principal of the school, suggests that you will be able to attend the school only under one condition: that you pretend to be a girl. The game covers Shoji's year at school, and the goal, you'll not be surprised to learn if you've played any similar games, is to succeed with one of the game's three possible love interests.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The characters are nicely drawn and the artist has done a good job of making Shoji androgynous; it's easy to believe he could be accepted at a girls' school. The backgrounds, too, are well drawn, but there aren't very many of them.

Unfortunately Highschool Romance suffers from the same sort of 'ghost-school' feel as Club Life; there are only four characters drawn at all, and even though some of the prose mentions other students and teachers interacting with Shoji, the graphics don't show it at all.

There are no graphics options to speak of, but the game should run fine even on a laptop with integrated graphics.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
I can't recall hearing any sound effects. The music is typical of the genre: fairly repetitive and unassuming.

There are also no voices, which seems to be a trait common to many (all?) of Dharker Studio's games. It's unfortunate; even though I don't understand spoken Japanese well, the spoken words in some other developers' visual novels do serve to enhance the experience significantly.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Highschool Romance plays like any other anime visual novel. You read the story, look at the scenes, and choose between one of two or three choices at set points in the story. Some choices are unimportant, but provide different flavour text for the story, while others determine which of the game's endings you will see. Will you end up with one of the game's love interests, or by yourself?

The game features three characters other than Shoji: Lea, the very young school principal who wears clothes that look remarkably like a school uniform; Hoshi, the nerdy, but lovable, class representative; and Selina, the enthusiastic blonde with a strong tendency to be flirty. The goal of the game is to survive without the general school population discovering your secret identity, and perhaps create a life-long relationship with one of these three women. Unlike many other games in the genre, both from Dharker Studio and others, Highschool Romance doesn't include any explicit adult content (hentai), and there's no patch available to enable it.

The writing in Highschool Romance is generally very good quality, although there are a few grammar errors and typos here and there.

[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]
Pros:
+ Interesting, if unbelievable, setting
+ Nice character art
+ Likeable characters
+ Steam achievements and trading cards

Cons:
- Deserted, 'ghost-school' feel again
- No voices
- Fairly short, even with multiple endings

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
Highschool Romance is a fun, short visual novel that doesn't resort to a gratuitous hentai gallery to draw in players. It has a nice story and likeable love interests, but could do with a bit more life in terms of background characters.

However, I think there's enough negatives to Highschool Romance that I will unfortunately have to lean towards not recommending the game.

The positives I'll state outright: it has an interesting concept, good music, and art that is different in an odd way but still more than competent.  The characters are also nicely done... somewhat.

That leads into the negatives, and unfortunately they started to pile up the more I played the game.

The first and most obvious problem is the minimal art, which seems strange that this would happen in a game where its more unique artstyle would be a possible pull.  This encompasses the backgrounds, special scene CG, and even character expressions - the last being probably the biggest problem.  A lot of times characters' expressions won't change even with the situation demanding it, which can result in some very awkward scenes.  Only the protagonist seems to have a good handful of different expressions to match the various situations.  Other characters have very minimal expression changes, usually none at all.

Not many backgrounds were done, and so you will have conversations that indicate moving to another place and yet the background would remain the same, again making the scene feel awkward.

With that, is special scene CG.  There is a really limited amount.  Three times more would've really liven up the game.  Instead, it's another way the game feels empty.  This along with only the four characters (including the protagonist) being the only people drawn, and the world feels very, very empty.

The writing is okay sometimes, but often if feels too forced.  Game just doesn't give itself room to breathe, as though it's rushing to the ""meat"" of the game.  Usually that's a good thing, but in a VN, it can easily work against it.  This feeling also comes across in conversations with characters.  While they got some good aspects to them, their manner of speech is most the time too blunt, and thus not allowing the characters to develop themselves.  They often feel unreal in how direct they are.

Other issues I have are things like time placement.  Scenes will jump from one to the next at times with little-to-no connection.  It can be difficult figuring out if an hour, a day, a week, or even months have passed by in-game time.

Along with that is the story feeling overall railroaded.  The branches only effect who you end up with (if anyone at all), and have no consequence to any other aspects of the story.  You'll still end up making friends with a character who you earlier chose to not even interact with, you'll still join a club when you directly avoid the activity for it, and you'll still have a romantic encounter with a specific character no matter what.

The last complaint I can think of almost sounds like a bug, and it may very well be one.  In one instance, a character wears risque nightwear, and your character has no special reaction.  Later, she wears the same nightwear, and your character reacts flustered.  Yet another time the game feels off.

There's good stuff forming as a basis for this game, but it feels like the work was rushed.  What is there has decent polish, but it's just not nearly enough to recommend as a VN, even with the relatively low price.",1484671351,1484671351,False,9,0,0.603202700614929199,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its price tag and pleasing presentation do, however, offset its faults making it a short but cute experience. 


[b]The Good:[/b]

Highschool Romance offers a different perspective into the visual novel x school life genre: that of a boy dressed up as a girl. While it may remind some of a famous asian drama, the cotton candy of an art style used to design the four main characters keeps the premise somewhat fresh. I recall launching the game for the first time and seeing the pastel like UI take over my screen, leaving me to gawk at the fonts used to set the tone of the visual novel. Then I saw the character design which immediately elicited fond memories of some of my favorite artists growing up. The art direction is certainly the game's selling point, and is in full display in every key scene. 

The plot in Highschool Romance is simple. A desperate boy in need of graduating takes on an all girl school donning a shirt and skirt, because it's the only school that apparently accepted him. Beating this in one hour and getting one of the handful of possible endings is reasonable. I received my first ending just shy of one hour, but I am a fast reader. Choices are present so there is a risk of missing out on achievements which is a welcome element in visual novels. 

I found the sound quality to be decent for the most part with a few melodies proving exceptionally catchy: the menu screen for one. One of them even made me smirk as it sounded more like a tune fit for a timer warning in a nintendo platformer. 

[b]The Not So Sood:[/b]

The choices weren't always clear or did it hint of their their implications with respect to the few story paths available. While I did appreciate the myriad of choices presented, upon clearing the game, I was not sure whether some choices truly had an effect on the plot. I think some were included to merely pad the experience rather than provide a means of steering the protagonist to a potential ending. Furthermore, the characters even in their climactic moments seemed to still lack development, especially given the divergent nature of the choices which left some characters in the shadow.

I saw the potential in the story the moment the protagonist agreed to change his outfit, but then I realized that the characters advertised on Steam were going to be the only characters in the entire game. Not a single NPC or the generic I'm-here-to-guide-you friend are present to counter the flow. Simply put, not enough variety. The same goes for the songs. It could have used more variety, because no matter how soothing the tunes may have been, they wore me out by the midway point. 

Lastly, the still images shown by the Steam previews account for a significant portion of the total stills present in the whole game. That shocks me now that I look back at it, and it further exemplifies the need for more variety, especially in a visual novel with characters so well designed.",1483152784,1483153276,True,2,0,0.538461565971374512,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It's okay I guess, but not really good enough to recommend. Let's break it down:

First Major Complaint: I literally bought it for the art style and the game seems to go out of it's way to not provide art. It is incredibly stingy with new art and most of the fun poses seen in the previews account for a decent amount of the special art shots you unlock. It doesn't even provide a picture of fireworks when such a thing would be appropriate. 

Pros:
* Decent art style when art is provided
* Cute characters
* Main character isn't insufferable
* Story has potential for decent humor

Cons:
* Literally only four characters including you. No one else appears to exist at the school
* Romance is very shallow
* No real landmark moments to make the game memorable. Pretty much just a meeting, a couple ""fun"" activities, a kiss, and a game over
* Talking about lack of time spent with characters, all of three romance options are extremely one-dimensional and typically only have a couple traits that define their entire character


It should be noted that I don't typically play Dating Sims (I've really only played a couple and the only two I can remember the name of is Katawa Shoujo and Magical Diary) so my expectations probably aren't in line with most since I didn't even realize this was a dating sim when I got it.

Side Question: Is there any reason this game is set in Japan beyond genre convention?

EDIT: Figured I may as well expand my review a bit.

First and foremost, I didn't dislike this game. I don't even think it's a bad game really. 10$ for around 3 hours of content is fine with me. However, I also don't think it's good enough to actually recommend.

Criticisms:

* The game doesn't really build your relationship up with any of the characters very well. The principal is probably the most fleshed out in this context, though there are quite a few unanswered questions with that path. You might think that you would get some time to learn about the characters and understand what they need in a relationship (which is something I have noticed occurs commonly in other romance titles that I have played). This doesn't happen. In fact, only one of the three characters do I know for a fact has a living family.

* The humor of the premise isn't used very well. To be frank I feel that it would pretty much be the same if you were just a non-straight girl in the academy. There are a lot of opportunities for misadventures that don't come to fruition.

* There isn't really a lot of actual choice in the game. Using a guide (to 100%) revealed to me that many of few choices that there are tend to be completely cosmetic and not really affect the story at all.

* The academy isn't fleshed out at all and you have no freedom to see it. While it might be interesting to meet some of the teachers and other girls going about, you don't really get to do any of that.

Whereas Negligee is the sexy game and Possession is high in drama and catharsis, this is the one where you're in it for the laughs. In other words, exactly what I wanted.

As a VN, it's good - your choices matter (for the most part), and even the ones that don't necessarily affect the final result can still get you some different CGs. Furthermore, while there is merit to playing through a few times to get different endings and deciding which waifu is best, it isn't a huge investment of time to do that so it doesn't feel like a chore.

Finally, it's big on the ""You are you, your clothing doesn't matter."" and how sometimes you don't even need to care about your gender identity. Honestly I'd like to see more things push this message, and as someone who had identity troubles in her teen years and early adulthood, things like this might have been able to help me be more comfortable with me. It sends a positive message there, to coincide with the fun characters and silly moments.

This game is great, albeit short and with only a few endings to achieve. I think two particular things make is worth the time and money: the art and the premise behind it. 

The art is extremely attractive and has a sort of pleasantly colorful cartoony vibe that is slightly anime but slightly western in appearance - all the characters are cute in their own way and the exaggerated expressions really give it a friendly, sweet-hearted feel. The unlockable scenes are all gorgeous and for the most part unique from another and not just the character posed on a static background that you see sometimes, I am particular fond of one scene where the protagonist and one of the girls are playing tennis for a reason I can't quite put my fingers on, I just really like it. Of course there are some sexy ones too, particularly of girls in underwear!

The concept is, as far as I know, fairly unique to Steam and so for a fan of cute boys in skirts, like myself, it is one of the few things that can scratch that particular itch. The only other somewhat similar game I can think of, which I will not mention, is extremely cringe inducing even to my incredibly deviant mind. So I more or less have to give this game gets even more props in the concept department for simply not going totally foot in mouth with it. Such is the state of the genre of cute boys in skirts.

The story is unfortunately far from exceptional. Two of the primary romantic interests are flat and contrived respectively, but the third was a pleasant surprise. I had gone in presuming I'd have more fun and interest in pursuing the more quiet, introverted character, as I often do, but unfortunately found her to be kind of flat and dull. The extroverted athletic girl on the other hand surprised me completely with both her slightly aggressive pursuit of you and how she interacts with the initial premise of the game. The third and final romantic option is a little crazy but I guess why make a hidden route normal? I liked it second best, after the athletic girl.

However, my main criticism of the story is the fact that it is a story about a boy who is crossdressing but at the same time it definitely isn't a story about crossdressing. Relatively little time is spent on the sort of difficulties such a situation would really have. It feels a lot like that in girl's clothes Shoji is immune to all suspicion. Voice, shaving, feminine behavoirs - all these things are more or less shrugged aside with only showers being the weak spot in his disguise. However, I don't think the cute, happy art style was really suited to a more serious examination of the subject matter.

My secondary criticism is that fact that a single very early choice seems to lock off two of the four endings. It's always a shame to go in and not being sure who to pursue and to find out by the end that one or more of the options will result in failure due to an early choice. I could be wrong about this, but in my first play through I pursued one of the girl's and didn't manage to get the good ending despite taking prettying much all her options in the mid and late game.

Also, one last thing. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing there was no m/m route, given the trope of crossdressing being linked to gay men is tired, I still would have appreciated the option if it were available.

Since I like Anime it looked like a good deal and it would allow me to experience these type of games (visual, interactive novels) for the first time.
To start, I picked a game that had a good score and did not focus on nudity, this one seemed to be popular, get many positive reviews and there is even a sequel in the works as I write this.
The premise is simple enough; boy dresses up as a girl and must avoid detection. Many great movies have been made on this topic, such as the classics; 'Some like it hot', 'Tootsie' and 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. Not for nothing all these are comedies providing great laughs for all ages. Needless to say, i was expecting something along these lines from this game. Sadly, none of the thrills that the before mentioned movies provide are witnessed here. The story is rather bland, missing a lot of opportunities to make it more interesting or funny. A lot of times I was thinking things could get interesting, but the plot was not further developed at that point. Ofcourse at some points you get to make choices in the game, but the outcome is rather predictable, so there is not much to it. At certain times i was expecting the ability to have a choice, but it didn't happen and the game already made the choice for me, as it was a set plot. A lot of missed opportunities throughout the game, which is very short as well.
What's left are the graphics and music, and they are nice. certainly the music is fitting the game very well. The graphics are also very well done, but there are not a lot of them, only a handful of locations and characters, so you might end up being tired of seeing them again and again after an hour.
Did I like my first encounter with a visual novel? Not very much, at the end I was wishing there be tits in it to at least get some excitement or something to giggle about.
Game works flawless on SteamOS/Linux, it probably works very well on lower end hardware since it's basically just showing pictures and text.

 But  with a few  warnings there is  no nudity   or sex scenes in this very short visual novel .    Unless you count  a picture of soji 

getting kissed as a sex scene   . This vn feels like it has been edited for steam but there does not seem to be   an  unedited 

vershon with nudity  . It takes your basic  story of your socially  awkward virgin male . Arriving at  an institution filled with girls 

where he ends up  being romanced by each of the girls depending on which choices you make .There are 3 girls in the vn and 3 

endings  the twist being that he dresses as a girl  because he has been accepted as a student at an all girls school .  
The animation  character type that would describe the main character soji would be Dandere (see link below for varous animation 

charachter types.). All 3 girls are  character types we have seen many times before . However  the question I have to ask is did i 

like playing this and the answer is yes .  It is very short  and easy to play does not have very much variation in the bacground 

music but does have a  function to turn off the background music  off  .
 I would wait for it to go on sale  .  As  once you  unlock all the achievements  and pictures it does not have much replay value    
  
However on a personal level I like  how this  vn  breaks down    social stereotypes of   what  boys and girls are supposed to do.  


I especially like some of the lines in it where the  female character's . who know soji is a boy  pretty much tell him that his sexual 

identity does not make a difference as to who he is as a person .  
 
 
but  I especially like one line in this vn spoiler alert  
 
when  soji confesses to one girl that he is a male. She  says she knew that but she treated him like a girl becase she thought he 

""identified as a girl""

So this is a romantic no homo trap VN, you are the trap here. For particular reasons, (mostly lazyness) you accept crossdressing for a entire year. This is about the game. 
Now, about its content. Before I start, I must say I had another expectations for this game, that didnt change the way I percieve the game tho. 
For whatever the reason is , you might find true love during this last year of school, like in real life, you could be finding good friends right now, working on yourself for a brighter future, even better, finding the love of your life now, or reading this review. Independent of the time-set however, the story development deploys naturally and makes sense.
This situation you got into might not make something you will easily pull out, but it happens. Now the whole story deveploment makes the most natural sense ever, I think that just one option didnt go as expected, every other desicion you make brings reasonable consecuences (good and bad).
I have a freind who is working in a project similar to this one, I dont want to got into details, but has a comedy turn, most than a romantic turn. Still, I have a good alike for romantic stories, when they are well written.

TLDR Most decisions make sense. It's a nice ride if you are into VNs, or romantic stuff.",1472487963,1472487963,True,2,0,0.466552108526229858,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Sei un ragazzo obblgato a frequentare un college femminile... quindi dovrai vestirti e comportarti come una ragazza... e, ovviamente, incontrerai un paio di ragazze interessanti... ;)

Le scelte che farai condurranno a finali diversi, e anche quelli negativi non sono terribili. Mi √® piaciuto come il gioco sia in qualche modo verosimile anche se √® praticamente impossibile che qualcosa del genere possa mai capitare. 

Comunque la storia √® ben raccontata, ci sono alcuni dialoghi interessanti e i personaggi, bench√© stereotipizzati, non sono solo un clich√©. 

Non √® difficile ottenere tutti i finali positivi, ma √® stato piacevole leggere la storia un paio di volte per ottenerli tutti e tre. Non saprei dire qual √® il mio preferito perch√© sono tutti buoni.

Direi che √® un gioco per ragazze, ma questo significherebbe che non ho imparato nulla da questo gioco riguardo la rottura degli stereotipi sessuali.

I wanted to be fair in my review of the game so I made sure to play it to every ending. When I first started playing one thing that really annoyed me was the skip mode and I couldn't for the life of me understand why it didn't work.

It was only after my second play did I notice it only lets you use the skip function if you have already seen that text before. At first this was going to be a bad mark against the game for me when I started however after getting use to it I can understand how it was handy and enjoyed it around the third run.

While I have both good and bad things to say about this game. I am torn on if I would recommend the game. One thing I did enjoy about the game was the stroy line it was very interesting and not something I have seen in a visual novel before however at the same time its a rather generic idea. The backgrounds and bodies are drawn very well and the game has no bugs that I could find.

Now for some of the bad things the faces were all drawn just awful the game has zero voice acting and no real change in music as far as I could tell. The brackgrounds didn't always fit the sence they were ment to be and the stroy was VERY short.

So now the real question would I recommend this game... Yes I would but only if the price is right while I can understand the amount of time and effort the devs would have put into this game do I think its worth ten bucks? No not really the game feels closer to three or five dollars at the most and even five feels like a bit of a reach. The game itself doesnt offer enough for the price mark they have it in. While the art and story are nice it can only carry the price so far before you need some content. The one thing I did enjoy at the very end of this is no matter your ending they wrapped up the story line so you were not left wondering what happens.",1471897793,1471897793,True,3,0,0.544412016868591309,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I don't like this game much but for what I spent on it (5 dollars) I didn't fee too bad about playing it beyond the ablity to return it since I was interested till the end of the game.

Now maybe the appeal of this game outside of steam is sex scenes or something that are missing for obvious reasons.  But that just leave the actual part of the game that should make you buy it since getting it just for fap material is stupid as you'd easily just find free stuff online.

Now on to the review...

My main issue with the game is text.  With no voice overs you will be reading a lot, and many times there will be internal monologues by the main character in italics.  The problem is the italics are so small a change I couldn't tell when what was what till I paid attention more or just assumed from what makes sense the most with what was said.  This means it was a choir to read and that's before getting into one of the paths being so simplified and wish granting that I can't handle caring about it.

It's a cheap game that can't be bothered to have more than the 4 characters with designs in the game.  And the fact outside the main character the other three are his partner options just makes it hard to engage.  No generic NPC even in the script really makes the story feel small and doesn't help with the tone at all.

If you can get it on sale and want a cheap Visual Novel to get an idea of what the genre is or are out of other options I say this is a good get.  Just realize that it's one of the worst examples in the genre since even if it did have sex scene they would have to be written has the hottest things known to the genre to even compete with have the other things on steam.",1468973275,1468973275,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Initial impressions:
The game/novel appears to be colorful and vibrant, and the text style choice has an appealing design to it.  The UI seems spot on.  I start reading and I'm in the character's head, but then as soon as we get to the principal's office, I'm suddenly surprised at the Principal's response.  There was no indication of items being said vs being thought.  It was jarring to need to spend that extra moment to pay the closer attention to tell what can be taken intuitively by a little more setup or preparation.
The art was has a very unique style, and it has its own lull appeal to it, though at times it had me slightly repelled.  My preferences in what I'd want to see could be overlooked, because it's so different, but there became a few other issues with the art so far.  One is just how little the characters differ in form/posture.  Maybe I'm not far enough in yet, but as an example, the main character we're following says the principal says something 'so brightly' yet there's not a single change in the smile, eyes, or posture to indicate that it was remotely true.  It'd be demeaning to say that the artists or the designers are not aware of how humans behave, but based on the work done, it doesn't appear that the knowledge has been applied to the game.

overall first impression rating: 3/5

Pros: 
+Decent enough start, if a bit typical.  One can only expect so many possibilities for how a scenario could occur.
+Unique art style.  I'm on the fence on the pro vs con of it, but it is what led me to get the game anyway

Cons:
-Poses, or lack thereof. All 2 of the poses seen (I know, so fair right?) are basically just a moved arm and a change to the face in the eyes and mouth.  Very statuesque, and the poses themselves are uninteresting for the character and the principal. Full front pose with unnatural/unlikely arm held to the side of the body needs some fixing.  (I'll lump the offputting eyes close to the bridge of the nose in with this as well as the rather large boobs in this, as it's all character related)
- Difficulty in separating thought from speech.

Recommendations to devs:
1) Fix the thought-speech separation.  Perhaps leaving the name off of the top of the box to indicate speech vs thought.  It's likely going to be automagically interpreted as thought if text is proceeding without the name, as so far, we're following the perspective of the main character.
2) This fix requires more effort, and may need to just wait until HR2, but research or act on the knowledge about poses.  Create subtle differences in stance for the characters, move more than just an arm or change an expression.  Look into a relatively recent (from the perspective of this review) video from Extra Frames (video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmLkVtqjf1A ) regarding pose design, or look into Katawa Shoujo.  I don't expect this, or its sequel, to be KS, but from a design standpoint, notice how frequently the characters shift, even though nothing's particularly active, you get a sense of movement and involvement from all the characters, even Rin (the no armed one).

I hope that this helps the devs, or anyone else who may be designing or working on similar projects, to progress.  It's a lot more work, but it's worthwhile because it helps bring the characters to life, and this initial impression, while I'm reading into some things a bit much for only 5 minutes, is leading me to expectations about what will happen, and that's critical to getting anyone's attention, reader or gamer.",1463749753,1463749753,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

TL;DR  : BUY THIS GAME ONLY IF IT HAS A DISCOUNT AND IF YOU ARE INTO VNs. CHARMING YET SIMPLE STORY, BUSTY BABES, NO NUDITY, LITTLE TO NO REPLAY VALUE 

Highschool Romance is a VN...and from there I don't know what can stand out when you compare it to other VN's. The story unfolds, you watch, you get to do some decisions which won't impact the plot at all, just the ending, but then again, when the title says what's this about, this is what you get.

While I find the main plot as something done a thousand times before, it manages to engage you with enough charm on it's simplicity and waifu material. Characters have some good traits to them, but, aside from one, I never felt that any of them were anything beyond stereotypes. 

My only real problem with this game is that I find little to no replay value, I can only see a comitted completionist finishing this game with all endings, and after that, I don't see him picking it up again. A real shame because the visuals give the game a personality of its own.

BUT my main complain is why didn't the devs make any freaky fakkin' nudity content/patch?!

His review was 10/10 IGN... Unfortunately, that was the best part about this game. I got HS Romance during a sale for 5 bucks - granted I played for almost 5 hours, I feel like I was slightly jipped. Why? Because the reviews made me think I was in for a crazy adventure that was just insane in every aspect. What I ended up getting was actually a relatively tame visual novel that told a relatively average quality story with little artwork and a short completion time. This makes it sound like I'm ragging on the game, but really, I think it was worth the $5 I payed for it. Just allow me to explain WHY this game was enjoyable - actually and truly.
1.) The art that's there is really pretty and has a unique style. The girls are cute and the environments colorful (even if both are repetitive)
2.) You actually do have some choices to make that effect the endgame. None of the choices are groundbreaking, but they DO make a difference
3.)Because the content isn't as risqu√© as some reviews would have you believe, I played this for a stream with a couple of friends. We had plenty of laughs and were able to stay entertained for most of the title.

I would never have gotten this achievement if not for reading how to get it.  It just would not work for me.

Lea True Love:  the woman who is the principal and gym teacher: looks more like a model than a principal. Lea is an older woman who sneaks around flirting with Shoji trying on sexy bras and panties in front of him asking for his opion.  Then she kisses him.  In the end they get married and live happily ever after.  In both Selina and Lea True Love scenarios they both like to see Shoji in womans clothing and continue to dress Shoji up as a female.

Backgrounds that change based on time and location.  A pacing which lets you take your time and enjoy the experience before it's suddenly over.  A readable text background that doesn't make your eyes hurt after a few minutes (seriously, that bright red is enough to blind someone...)

This game lacks all of those things.  It's a breakneck adventure with sudden jolts between scenes that is difficult to keep up with at times.  Whenever I started to feel myself enjoying the experience, I was jolted into another scene and the immersion was broken again.

As a first attempt at a game like this, it's not terrible.  A $10 price point for this 2 hour romp through a fairly token story is a little steep.  You wouldn't regret paying a buck or two for it if you're tired of trips to feels town and just want a light-hearted romp with a few girls.

I can't give a full recommendation in this state, but I'm still curious for the sequel.

It is short for the money, but as you'll see, it's worth it in the long run. 

Now the good. The storyline itself is formulaic, but the plot is AMAZING. I went in to this game optimistic that it wasn't going to be one of those sketchy harem games where the ""boy"" is just trying to get his wick dipped. The developers did not disappoint; the protag has definite dimension and‚Ä¶ personality. I'm actually not sure if this was actually a surreptitious way to introduce a transgender protag or not; Shoji certainly seemed to take on the feminine role very quickly‚Ä¶ and almost too well. I love that the developers actually reference this in one of the potential endings, though it isn't as strong as it could be (which is all I'm going to say, as I can't divulge any more without actually spoiling it).

All in all, I have to say that this was a pretty epic win. I have taken some chances on other otome games, and some have been good (such as Michaela Laws' [i]Seduce Me[/i]), and others that weren't so great (and I'll not make mention of them here). I'm pleased to say that this one is in the former category. I find myself actually looking forward to the sequel. I spoke with the developers (who are very responsive in the forums), and I like some of the ideas they have for it. We need more trans characters placed in a good light, and I think they get that.

Its a visual novel about a androgynous boy that is mistakenly transferred to a once co-ed boarding school that is now an all girl school. So naturally the best course of action is to just go with and pretend to be a girl with the full consent and help of the principal. We've all been there once or twice right? By the way it is of course a visual novel, that means really its just a picture book that will have you spneding all your time reading and clicking your mouse just to turn the page. Ocassionaly you will have to choose what your character decides to do for what situation hes in, which is just to determine which girl you want to end up with

The 4 main characters--including you--are basically the common cliche, cookie cutter anime stereotypes found in alot of anime: Youre the androgynous ""male"" character that ALREADY looks like a female, yet somehow doesn't realize it and thinks he's a man's man, there's the softspoken shy over-academic glasses girl--with big boobs, the outspoken sporty competitive girl--with big boobs, and your hot-blooded principal/teacher that's actually SUPPOSED to be an older woman but looks and dresses like a teenager and has a thing for barely legal young men--of course with big boobs. But i still felt they were nicely designed characters.

The story as well is just as cliche but tells itself well enough, its a shame its not just a full flegded animation. You fall ontop of girls in awkward intimate ways, you spill things on their big boobs, youre forced to make decisions between them, etc. Your character, while supposed to be heterosexual and cisgendered, somewhat discovers he can ""enjoy"" transvestite activites at least during 2 of your interests' paths (alot of people dont know a transvestite actually has nothing to do with homosexuality or transexuality) but thats really all the ""character"" developement that happens. However i cant in good faith advocate this as a truly lesbian or transgender novel because its not supposed to be despite it giving that impression.

Pros: 
-It has a great bright vibrant artstyle that i absolutely love (perhaps even a bit too bright enough to hurt your eyes). 
-The girls have nice designs--especially Lea (omfg i want her clothes... ;_;)
-Is a sweet romance anime novel
-I personally rather enjoyed the girls personalities. Selina specifically i feel is the best and strongest character that probably makes the story as interesting as it can be, with Lea being the second.
-If you look nicely drawn boobs, then the story has nicely drawn boobs on sexy ladies
-Silly and humorous


Cons:
-The whole grounds the story is based on is stupid i have to say. Thats not me necessarily saying its bad, but it is something that would ONLY happen in anime. 
-Notice how i kept saying the girls are nice characters with the exception of the character the story is taking perspective of right? Thats because the guy is not a great character at all that doesnt really have any terribly interesting qualities or talents that the other characters have to read about whether that was intentional or not. Not much is learned about him besides what you begin the game knowing about him in otherwords and thats how each story ends
-The music while it is sweet and cute, is too few in variation and gets a little annoying after how long they go on and how often theyre used. It was especially annoying when youre reading something really intimate and mature happening between the main character and one of his interests and theres this really cheery upbeat tune playing to it that sounds like you should be reading about a little girl having a tea party.
-No sex in case thats something you were expecting. It's strictly romance with some saucy moments, but nothing involving intercourse.
-This visual novel was made to particularly interest anime enthusiasts that like romance, underlying LGBT stories and characters. If thpse things don't interest you this game novel most assuredly will not

Final verdict: 5.7/10. I genuinely did enjoy it for the story so i give it a thumbs up based on *my* interests. Lea and and Selina are great vibrant characters that are most of the interest to be found here while you are not in my opinion. There could have been more done with the story and the main character i feel. With that said i will certainly look forward to what the publisher is working on next.",1456183931,1456184382,True,3,0,0.518439233303070068,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Overall, the game has 4 achievements (one for each ending and a 'secret' achievement) and 18 unlockable CGs. The gameplay is typical to all VNs I have played though they were missing one of the more important features to a VN. I was unable to scroll up to view previous text, which is generally a hallmark of VNs. 

For grabbing the game at around ~$6.75, I spent 6 hours 100%ing it. I found that a price of $5-7 range is the best for this game since it isn't particularly long and somewhat repetitive. There are about 4 background tracks tops and sometimes they do not fit the scene they play in which can convey the wrong kind of atmosphere to the reader imo. Another aspect that fit in the okay, not exceptional category is that I think there are... 6? background CGs tops. Not to mention that the character's writing  would have benefit way more from a longer game.


Basically it boils down to:
* Not many background CGs
* 3-4 music tracks tops
* Music did not fit some scenes
* Characters were a little shallow, leading into
* Game should have been longer for better character depth


Despite the flaws, I did enjoy the art style and the story was certainly alright, though reactions to certain things were a bit disappointing. Get it if you are new to the visual novels genre and would like to give it a try for cheap

Rating would be about 3.5 out of 5

I have a lot to say, both in terms of the Pros and Cons, so I'll list them out for the sake of convenience.

Pros:
*The artwork is very nice and detailed.

*All the characters are somewhat likeable.

*Offers dialogue options.

*Girls are cute.

Cons:
*Although the artwork is very well done, there is not enough of it. Most if it is just the same artwork with a clothing change, like a sports bra instead of a normal bra, and it's disappointing overall.

*The dialogue is honestly awful. The way the plot progresses and is paced is poor, and there are many grammatical mistakes in the text that make some sentences hard to understand.

*There are only 3 girls, and I found all of them boring and honestly too perfect to believe. It actually makes me harder to like characters if they have literally no flaws to them whatsoever.

*The endings are disappointing/terrible based on which one you get. The amount of boring text I had to get through to reach the crappy end was definitely not worth it.

*Even though there are dialogue choices, I've noticed most of them don't change the story much and are just there to make you THINK you are making an important decision.

*Price is too high for the production value of the game.

Conclusion:

Overall, this game has a lot more negatives than positives, and I feel that this game is not deserving of its price tag. Compared to Huniepop, which has voice acting, animations, engaging dialogue, more characters, and doubles as a super addicting puzzle game, this game definitely disappoints.

However, while I do heartily recommend this, I feel I need to mention one thing that bothered me: the pacing--or rather, the utter lack thereof. Everything seems to come straight on the heels of the thing before, even if there was a significant time jump between. I really understand this, being an amateur writer myself. Often you have a string of moments you've fleshed out that you want to get into in a story--the meat and potatoes of the ""meal"", so to speak--and it can be hard to string them together. However, this game eschews that for simply placing them one after the other, lightning fast, with very little in the way of segue. As much as I liked the story and all of the characters in it, this constantly pierced my willing suspension of disbelief. I felt like I was being shown a slideshow-in-text rather than someone's, y'know, *life*. 

All in all, though, I really did enjoy it. I just wanted to chime in with some constructive criticism in case writer-senpai notices me. I hear there's talk of a sequel, and I'll definitely buy it when it's on sale.

At the time of writing this I only have 3.7 hours logged for this game. Despite that, I have completed all three of the story arcs including both good and ‚Äúbad‚Äù endings.

It's a nice little visual novel. However, it left me wanting several things, especially if you compare it to something like Katawa Shoujo. Overall I would rate it 6/10 but I would not recommend the game to a friend in the current state that it‚Äôs in.

However, if it‚Äôs on sale then for it.


*Long Version*

*Cons*

-There are several lines of dialogue that should have been used as choices. I don't know if it's just me, but I would prefer a choice of telling someone if I'm a lesbian. Instead I'm given choices like ""tennis"" or ""running.""

-There is a severe lack of endings. There's only three routes and five endings in the game. Either add more characters or truly devastating bad endings instead of the neutral like ""bad"" endings. Also with the addition of more characters, it would allow other endings to close off easier and make the choices in game more meaningful.

-More character flaws would be nice too. Everyone was a ""Mary Sue"" and gave me no real reason to become attached to a character. What's worse is that there's a lot of opportunities in the plot that would allow for the development of flaws, which brings me to my next point...

-The plot seemed rushed. There are so many good events or problems that could have been expanded upon, like when Hoshi is doing other people's homework. This subplot gets dropped within the same scene and never brought up again. There are countless more examples of this and makes a game that could have been 4-6 hours long take only 2.

-The art doesn't always match what's going on in the background. If dialogue says that it's dark, I don't want to see bright blue skies in the background! Also the only still pictures used are for either kisses or underwear scenes. It would be nice to actually see the board games that you're playing with Hoshi or the fireworks that are in the sky during the festival. In addition, there's not a lot of character models with different expressions. It‚Äôs hard to take the scenes seriously when Selina or Hoshi is supposed to be mad but their faces are smiling.

-The music is annoying after hearing it over and over again. It's too simple and short to hear constantly.

-The transition of time is awful. Several times the game moved on to the next day. But because there are no visual cues or even change of lighting, it‚Äôs hard to follow when that happens. Just the screen fading to black for a second would be better.

-There should be an interface to recall previous dialogue. If you skip something you have to either revert to an old save or start over from the beginning.


*Pros*

-This game has a lot of potential. It has an interesting concept and a decent story. I really enjoyed Lea's path.

-The art is actually really nice. I just wish I was able to see more of it. I really wanted to see Shoji and Hoshi sing karaoke.

-It takes a delicate and controversial idea and doesn‚Äôt butcher it.

You play as Shoji and you can follow along and become romantic with the sporty, straight forward, blonde Selina, the polite, cute, raven-haired Hoshi or the busty principal ms. Rowen. The game is tagged with nudity, but there is none of that in the game. Luckily I think, otherwise it would have lost its charm with me.

===

I really like the artwork of this game, the characters all look amazing. Sometimes you get a little piece of extra artwork of a scene in the story.
Sadly, there were many times while reading the story I wanted to actually see that scene drawn on the screen rather than just the character sprite explaining it to me in just text. The backgrounds are all devoid of any life, maybe not to distract you from the main characters, but this school just looked empty to me.

Basically make the choices toward the girl you like between Selina and Hoshi. With ms. Rowen you will have to be a bit more daunting. To make another playthrough easier, a handy skip button allows you to quickly pass all the text you already have read.

Highschool. Someone hate it, someone love, but its part of our life and we cant ignore it.
So... Whats, if accident happens and your new school is girls-only? 
Some pervys can imagine it as harem, but this story isnt about it. Its about guy, who needs to crossdress into girl cuz of this situation. Sounds mad? Maybe, but if it wont scare you - just grab this. Or if you like 2D traps, like I d...nevermind :I

So, in short. 
Pros:
+ [b]Few routes[/b]. Yep, its not katawa shoujo, but here are 3 full endings (full = not when you ends with your hands only). Also few choises - not as much as could be, but also not like in sakura series :/
+ [b]Pretty graphics[/b]. Rlly - not another copy-paste, where every character looks same as other one in different title
+ [b]Fanservice[/b]. I know, lewds, you are here for it ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) There is, actually, no nudity, but, atlest, no pg13 erotic too, like in sakura series (Im used this again, cuz its very popular in steam)
+ [b]Cards[/b]. Cuz this game is a bit niche, they have a bit higher price than they could be. Thats cool if you dont wanna to craft badge. 3 of 5 drops in game.

Mehs:
~ [b]A bit short[/b]. Im not fast reader, cuz english isnt my native language, so - I did 100% (all routes, all choises, all stuff in gallery) in like 4.5 hours (and one more hour farmed cards). Its not worst result for vn, but not best too.
~ [b]Plot[/b]. Im not fan of slices, so - it wasnt my coup of tea. But, for someone else its may be in pros, so - placed it here

Cons:
- [b]Not much sprites[/b]. Rlly. Not all action scenes have custom backgrounds actually, like if its censored (but it isnt). For not free vn, its not best thing.

Overall: its little, but [b]fun[/b] (rlly fun - some scenes made me laugh) [b]slice vn[/b], a bit cliched, but it looks different anyways, cuz of situation. 
In my opinion, its [b]must have for every trap-lovers and recommended for fans of slices[/b]. Also, as I said, its may be awesome to gift it to your male friends with stereotypes :^)

This fact is better, though, as players can focus less on mindless sex appeal and perhaps enjoy the story a bit more. Is it worth $10? Probably not. Is it worth playing, however? Absolutely.

+Realistic dialogues and nice plot. Can't stop playing. Lots of funny jokes
+Lea. I'm so into that kind of relationship! Best ending, and takes more than one try to figure it out. 

+-Because of small amount of characters game isn't long. 6 hours, 4 tries, 3 good endings

-Lack of cg's and soul put into them. That's my opinion
-I thought 'bout some erotics. Maybe Steam doesn't allow smth like that but I expected lots of spice :)

Highschool Romance is a dating sim where you play as the only boy in an all girls boarding school, all thanks to a mix up in the admission process. Because of this the main character Shoji has to pretend to be a girl. Now, when I first heard about this game, I was excited to find a game with a crossdressing protagonist as it's so rarely handled nowadays. But I was also very worried since whenever it is handled... well it's not usually handled particularly well.

High School Romance is actually very mature about the concept though and talks about it in a somewhat respectful manner. It presents you with a main character who, while obviously a touch hesitant about crossdressing at first, grows to accept it and learns something about himself. Occasionally it does delve into dressing up as a 'kink', but it treats it very equally, painting it not as humiliating but as 'sexy' on both sides.

Speaking of 'sexy', the artwork is lovely and the characters all look superb. This is a style I really love and the CGs are all really great. The presentation elsewhere however is lacking and feels a touch sloppy. There aren't enough expressions for each of the characters, there are typos, music doesn't always fit the scene and sometimes scene transitions are there, sometimes they aren't which can be a little jarring.

It's also exceptionally short, which makes the asking price somewhat hard to sell. It took me just less than 4 hours to fully complete it, which was in one sitting I might add. However, thanks to it's brevity and the sheer lightness of it's plot it's perfect for a quick fluffy time if you're ever feeling a little down.

And that's what this mostly is, a fluffy cute Dating Sim with crossdressing in it. And while it's not as developed as other VNs it is at least entertaining for what it is.",1451949849,1451949849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That is consequently forgotten and followed up by exceedingly boring slice of life of the blandest kind. Seriously. You don't advertise ""You're a boy crossdressing at a female school!!"" and then do literally nothing with that. Your target audience isn't normals. It's weebs. You get three routes, two of which are nearly identical, railroaded, and filled with so many lame timeskips and things like the game telling you this character you've seen twice is suddenly your best friend. It even offers a Mass Effect-style ending decision node. Really?

Story aside, this game has next to no art assets. There are 18 event CG in the entire game, and several of that number are literally the same scene, just with different underwear on. The main character is drawn as a girl and called a guy (No, seriously, he has childbearing hips and wears eyeliner in your first look at him). There are three characters that have sprites, three expressions for each, and three sets of clothes: School, Casual, and Underwear. Oh, I guess the Principle has a yukata too. The game frequently forgets that the characters actually have multiple expressions to choose from; past the halfway point no one will react to anything visually again. 

The background CG is horribly limited too. For instance, in one scene everyone starts commenting how it's night time and the fireworks going off are beautiful. There's no firework CG, no firework effects, no firework sounds, and the background is still bright with a blue sky like it's 1 PM. In another scene, you're supposedly in the gym showers getting mud and sweat off of yourself....and the background shows you in the school's entrance, by the shoe lockers. What?

Art isn't the only type of asset lacking in this game. There's no audio. The only sound you get is the repetitive soundtrack, which seems as limited as the Art in variety as well. Inappropriate music plays several times, setting a mood that doesn't reflect the text in the slightest. 

And then just like that, the game's over. After nothing happens for an hour, you suddenly choose one of the girls and, if you chose to hang out with them a lot, you end up marrying her. It's bad. It's literally ""Which do I choose?"" [Hoshi] [Selina]. Oh, and [Lea] is only an option if you answered the first decision in the game correctly. Yes, the best route (with most of the CG and noteworthy scenes) is completely locked out if you express dismay at the idea of crossdressing to stay in the school. If you go full weeaboo and express some interest in crossdressing, Lea hops all over you. her route is the only one that's got any entertainment value in it, and I only enjoyed it because I could skip all the scenes without her, as I'd already completed most of the game at that point.

I unlocked all 18 event CG and had seen all scenes in this game, while streaming, in 2:41:00. This game is short, shallow, and unimaginative. It doesn't even play with its premise. By all means, send it as a gag gift to people. That's how I got it. But for your own sake, don't buy it and expect even a passable time. I'm surprised that the developers canceled their kickstarter to develop this privately; it really feels like they'd put something out just to say they did it.

The story itself is fine as far as typical highschool dating game stories go, but it's not particularly long, and with the skip function you probably won't break 3 or 4 hours between the game's 3 routes. The art style is what will probably make or break it for you; I personally liked it, but I've also seen a lot of people who hate the style due to its more western appearance. Overall it's a decent game for fans of the trap genre, but I was kind of expecting more from it.",1449208559,1449262733,True,8,1,0.518161296844482422,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Sometimes is better to go for something contained than strive for something convoluted. I think the length was fitting considering the story was simple. 

As for some pointers to improve if by any chance there's another. 

- More expressions.
- Diversity in the soundtrack.
- More event artwork.
- More than two options. Since even in the case of three it mainly triggered two different outcomes.

I think I found ""unique"" for a game like this. Is how each route led to a different type of relationship with a different degree of kinkyness. That's something that'll be nice to consider for people that both like getting kinky with this kind of game and those who want a cute relationship outcome and those who want the funny ending. 

The biggest point of contention do to price and length, is mainly the lack of struggle between the romantic interests. I mean it doesn't need to get to School Days levels of consequences, but a discussion or fight could add to the story.

IDK. I guess I need to play it more... I will update my review after I do so.

But initial impression is that it's kind of a boring game. OMG! Male character thrust into clutches of horny principal of all girl school.... two girls interested in him, I mean, her... (why only two?!?!) and both are annoying and boring asf. 

If it weren't for the artwork, I would probably stop playing this. I am hoping it picks up a bit though. It bums me out that there are only three options to choose from, AFAIK... Busty Principal Woman, Overlystudious yet Boring Asf Glasses Chick, or Annoyingly Dull Sporty Girl. Yawn. The main character is really submissive and seems to get bossed around a lot. His/her gender does not matter, it's the personality. And yet I find MC most likeable character in entire game which is ironic b/c in dating sims/VNs/otome games, I tend to find the MC really fvcking boring/annoying/submissive/whine-y....still not saying I love him/her, but at least makes the game semi tolerable.

Everything else seems horribly formulaic and droll. Sorry. I feel bad saying this b/c the art is terrific and I really enjoy the visual/audio aspects of this game.

Yes it's about a guy going to all girl's High school and end up living his High school life as a cross dress. BUT I do like the drawing. Feels kind of unique in it's own way. 

I wish they put more girl's though. Since I believe this game has a short story, I do wish they put more girl's or characters for more options. I feel less likely to encounter any event flags if there's less character in a short story. Also, I do have hard times reading the text. The text color and the back around seems hard for me read. It might be better if they used black outline instead of white on the text. (This might be only me, but just saying.)

Overall, I'll come back again to re-write the review after I finish it. I say It's a pretty decent game. I've seen people say it's shit game, but compare with other Kuso-ge I played that sells over 5000 yen (cough...Cough! JapancouGH!), the game is really decent and unique on it's own way (the drawing).

  It's rather short and the backgroungs art is ratherlimited and a bit to realistic in comparison to the bright characters and sometines doesn't match the scene (says it's getting late and the sun is shining full force through a window), lastly the choices you make don' make that much diference besides a few very important questions that you don't know until you try them all or just choose them coincidentaly.

  Now on to the stuff I love about it.

 While it is short the dialogue is quite a large amount making a full story, the dialogue meshes well at key points making those moments more powerful, the three girls you can choose to go after are all good but stereotyped, but not in a bad way (nerdy shy girl, sporty friendly girl, and the somewhat refined but knows how to have fun girl), and the protagonist is male but is forced to crossdress making it a lot funnier and less serious most of the time.",1448160587,1448160587,True,0,0,0.497669786214828491,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is a bit short and can be played through in about an hour (although I spent some time getting different endings and making different choices by making a new save for every choice that I got).

The ""nudity"" in the game is very light which I find appropriate for any game you would buy on steam for all your friends to see. If you want something ""else"" then there are surely other services for that, or you could always patch the games you buy here if that's what you want *hint hint* ; p

If you are used to playing visual novels then this might be a bit light for you (because of the rather light and short story). I found the story to be pretty cute, even though they could have developed it a bit more.
I would also have liked more scenes throughout the story as some dialogues would really deserve/need it, and I even found a few dialogues to not really fit with the current scene showing.

Either way, for the price of this game I'd say it's worth it.
It's a good game :)",1448153431,1448190732,True,36,6,0.681710243225097656,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I bought it in spite of fact I rather dislike all these novel-story-games seen around lately. I love anime on TV, but this kind of thing doesn't please me in a game.

Why I bought it then? For one and only reason - because it reminded me of these funny sim-date flash games that were popular when I was in middle school (yeah, and games were mostly 18+ ;)) 
I don't know why, but this specific game title has recalled me all that, and so, despite my worries, I finally purchased it.

At this moment I've played it 3 times, each for about 1,5 hour. Need to mention, in my first attempt, I have kinda lost... hard to say if I should call it like that, but yeah, I didn't get ""the goal"". So, take it into consideration while playing it - this possibility also exists.
 
I must say, after playing it for longer while I've pretty got liked this game. I still need to try one more ending, and I want to check the importance of each decision for the final result. 
But for it's price, the game had a potential to be ""more"", with even better dialogues, much more art with different poses of characters, and of course - enhanced variety of choices.

Advantages:
- Quite entertaining story, good dialogues, lovely art... and pretty girls, obviously!

Disadvantages:
- Short game (with this, it could be much longer), small variability of choices, not enough art (more pictures! more different poses of characters!)

Would I recommend buying it then? 
Maybe not for the standard price. If you are not really into this genre, then you'd rather think twice before purchasing. But if you enjoy such games - go ahead! Nevertheless I advice you to wait for better offer.",1448121241,1448654921,True,3,1,0.493701696395874023,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Minimal amount of choices, no CGs where there should have been.

Music was repetetive

Plot was barebones and better suited to an OVA or online short then a game on steam.

Protagonist was boring

The romantic leads; Hoshi and (Forgot her name already and I just finished playing) are basically betty and veronica ala Archie Comics. 

The reason why I purchased this game; CGs with gratuitous nudity (because non educational VNs should have fanservice IMO) sadly did not come to fruition. There was some fanservice here and there but nothing substantial or even good.

Things I liked:
[list]
    [*]Characters had lots of charm to them
    [*]Music was catchy
    [*]Cool environments, solid art
    [*]I got way more invested than I was expecting LOL
[/list]

Things I didn't like:
[list]
    [*]I wish there were more drawings (poses? idk what to call it). Each character had only a few different animations and they shared a very similar model so there wasn't much variety.
    [*]Needs to show more 3rd party characters! Even if just for a couple scenes. I'd like to see more than just the 3
    [*]It was a little short for $8. I don't know if I can fault the game for that. I took my time, went back and repeated stuff, and it was just under 3 hours of gameplay. I think if they added another character or two it would have helped.
[/list]

My advice:
[list]
    [*]For the love of god tell ""Miss Rowan"" to try the clothes on herself
    [*]I feel bad for Hoshi cus Selina is a douche to her, but go with Selina. She is a wayy more entertaining girl
[/list]

Good foray into this kind of ""game"" for me. I probably give a superficially high rating of 8/10 because I wish Selina existed IRL.

Glad they added the 'maid' route because otherwise the game surely would have been short - took me about 2.5 hours to get the good and bad ending of Hoshi and Selina. In total it took me about 5 hours to see all CGs except one.
IMHO it's a fair deal for the discounted price.

I did not find any bugs but just a few minor typos and in some cases the written text wasn't matched to the correct girl. Nothing gamebreaking as you clearly can associate it to the right person.

Completing the game once to unlock the whole gallery is a bust as you dont get rewarded from playing it a second time, you only get new dialogue.

Also the pacing was a bit too Sanic. A lot of new things were just slapped on your face and it was
really hard to keep up. Shows that the writer had so much to tell but so little time and space.
With slower pacing, would've easily stretched the game to at least 4 hours.

Most of the story is simply told through text with static backgrounds and non-animated big character sprites, but there are also several bigger events with full-screen animated scenes that advance the story.

There is no voiced dialogue, everything is done through text. The game has a very relaxing musical score throughout instead.

The story strays away from most of the clich√©s this scenario brings and while still somewhat implausible over the whole situation, I felt everyone reacted pretty naturally to everything. Definitely no cringeworthy illogic in here.
