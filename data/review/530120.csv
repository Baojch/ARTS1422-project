One of the best VR multiplayer experience. If you want to show how great VR is to your non VR friends, this is one of the best choices, especially because of the price. 

There are multiple ways to modify your VR play area, which is awesome, because every person can play as comfortably as possible. Only downsides of this game are that it don't have the greatest Index Controllers support (however you can simply modify your input) and that there is limited ammount of work to do - you just make burgers. But the gameplay is really physically and mentally engaging, which is great.

[list]
[*] Asymmetric multiplayer on single PC makes this game really special
[*] Simple core gameplay, VR person makes burgers, PC person takes and delivers orders
[*] First levels are pretty simple and fast, but difficulty is rising to almost impossible to complete
[*] Simple graphics, pretty art style
[*] Good sound design, pretty cool music
[*] Game time varies per level, first ones are pretty short, but when you progress further, you'll need to restart levels multiple times, and time per level will rise
[*] You need pretty simple VR ready PC, but you may experience some occasional stutters
[*] Very well worth the price!

No other VR game has provided me with more entertainment than Diner Duo. The asynchronous multiplayer works beautifully and, played with friends or family, provides endless fun.

Flipping burgers may sound like hard work and, well, it is. However, you'll enjoy every stressful minute of it. The mechanics of cooking and constructing burgers works very well and feels perfectly natural after just a couple of minutes. The waiter plays on the computer and also has plenty to do: taking and remembering orders, delivering food, pouring drinks and serving free pie to disgruntled customers.

The progression of difficulty through the levels is just right, with more, increasingly complicated burgers and more diners being added as you go, but slowly enough that you don't feel overwhelmed too soon. The later levels become (hilariously) stressful and you'll frequently find phrases being yelled at each other such as ""WHAT ELSE DID THEY WANT??"" and ""HURRY, HE'S ABOUT TO LEAVE!"", ""*&$!£ I BURNT ANOTHER ONE"", ""THAT'S NOT A NUMBER 9!!""

The cupcake cafe is also good and refreshingly different to the main diner. One of the biggest challenges is the necessity to come up with your own naming system for each cupcake.

The settings allow you to adjust the hight and scale of the kitchen, however it would be useful if you could also move it back/forward a bit as well. With my setup, the waiter (playing on the computer) ends up sitting pretty much with their head inside the serving counter. The result? When the chef thrusts a pair of completed ""star"" burgers onto the counter yelling ""ready!"" they are likely to punch you in the back of the head.",1573212283,1573212283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is what it looks like. If you like cooking games or games like Diner Dash you will like this game.

Other then the skills needed in normal time management games you will need to have good communication skills to succeed in this game.

Now the negatives. No bars/pie chart/countdown counters to let you know when the customer is getting impatient(blue>yellow>red>leave). Slicing is a little finicky especially when holding the ingredient.

Now yes there could have been more features like in other time management games (some of which Dannyo mentions).

this game is one of those games in the vr medium that sets a standard of what we can expect from the future of vr and how creative you can be with assymetrical vr games.

The atmosphere and the fact that you both exist in the diner together naturally leads to some very easy roleplay, where we'll greet the regulars, nickname order #, and make-up local gossip.

Finally, with the asymetrics gameplay (one person serves tables, the other Cooks in VR), you get 2 unique experiences both of which are very polished and a blast to play. Finally, as you progress, you'll unlock wearables, more burger combinations, and more responsibilities for the waiter.

Absolutely love the game! This will be our go to when friends come over! I have never had local coop done better in VR. I will buy any DLC (which I never do) or spin offs this team makes. What a game!

Joking aside, I think that's what sets the game appart. You have your little work station at the grill and what not, but you get to prep like you would in an actual burger joint. Precook some burgers, stack em up. chop your mushrooms and put them in the bin. Set up your plates with the buns and be ready to go.

This is my favorite VR game, along with AudioShield, and I have tried quite a lot of the ""experiences"" available out there. The graphics are cartoonish but the immersion is fantastic! 
The game is fun playing solo but the asymmetric co op is what makes the game my favorite. It is a wonderful game to play with a friend or spouse; one plays as the waiter and the other one, with the headset, is the chef.  The waiter must scream orders to the chef who cooks them with only the instructions given from the waiter. If an order is incorrect, panic (and fun) will ensue. It becomes very stressful at higher levels which makes cooperation and strategy extremely important. I highly recommend it to those who like to play in pairs!

One uses the VR headset to make the food (or just grab it, in the case of cupcakes - good for children) and the other uses the controller to serve the food and drinks - 5 year old did great at this. And we both learned to create a useful verbal communication system. The controls are easy on both sides- one button and movement is all it takes for server, and 2 buttons plus movement for VR cook.

The game has enough levels and variety to keep it interesting after the first few plays. So far this has been our goto Vr game for family fun. It's also quite polished and bug free. One complaint noted below....

FEATURE REQUEST: While there are in game controls to center and adjust the play area for the VR user, we need a hotkey on the keyboard or controller to allow the view to be centered and reset. This would save alot of trouble, especially when an inexperienced user is trying VR! They can often not even reach the adjustment levers, if they can even find them.

I absolutely adore VR the Diner Duo. I love assymetrical multiplayer and this game has a great assymetrical co-op experience. 

The player with the VR headset plays as the short order cook. Burgers must be assembled with the proper ingredients and in the proper order. Daily specials throw another wrench in the machine as they are different each day. The food you assemble gets increasingly complicated as the levels go on. Also, the customers feel like they never stop!

The player at the keyboard/controller is the waiter, taking orders and relaying them to the cook as well as dispensing those orders once they're done. Eventually you will have to also get drinks, and make sure the customers stay happy if your cook can't keep up with the pace. It gets hectic.

Great game to play with a friend if you only have one VR headset (which, realistically, is most people who have VR). It can get a little CRAZY though, so practicing the earlier levels as both the cook and the waiter helps.

Next bug: the dinner tray is falling trough the table sometimes. 
Thats all for now, i believe.

As a unity developer, i was smart enough (lol) to watch the output.log. 
There are many of collider problems: ""NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
  at VRTK.VRTK_InteractTouch.OnTriggerStay (UnityEngine.Collider collider) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 ""

And a adress access problem is there too.  Sometimes he is trying to access an invalid adress.
 
All these bugs, i never had before.
Dear developer, i hope, i could help you.

Anyway for the people: it's an nice game, and don't had bugs before. This is why i think, in the near future, that game will be bugfree again. With the last update, comes a new funny gamemode and the lightning is noticeable better.

+ Local coop - friend on PC is a waiter - he yells orders at you and deliver your burgers to guests - great fun.
+ Easy to understand - great starter game for VR novices; also for some reason women love this game.
+ Difficulty variety - a wide range of difficulty from really basic to absolutely insane levels. Everyone can find a relaxed gameplay or challenge here.

- Nothing major - sometimes it takes few attempts to hit the right spot with a knife to cut fish or mushroom; there were performance issues, but I don't experience them lately so I suppose it was fixed.

[b]Movement[/b]: 		None (room-scale only)
[b]Controls[/b]: 		Motion controllers (+ keyboard and mouse for PC player in local coop mode)

Bei VRTDD geht es darum, dass man in einem gleinen Bistro hinter der Theke steht und Burger für die Gäste zubereitet. Kommt ein Gast an, rennt einer vor zwei Roboter-Bedienungen hin um die Bestellung aufzunehmen und stellt sich dann vor die Theke um diese anzuzeigen. Die Burger haben zwar auch Nummern, die man lernen kann (was aber doch etwas nervig sein kann) aber so kann man schnell sehen, welche Zutaten in welche Reihenfolge drauf müssen.
Man kann auch verschiedene Sachen vorbereiten, darf sie jedoch nicht zu lange liegen lassen.
Das Spiel hat verschiedene Level mit steigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad und einen Endlos Modus.

Grafisch ist es eher zweckdienlich, die Musik dudelt belanglos im Hintergrund (kann mittels dreier Tapes auch gewechselt werden). Der Arbeitsberiech kann vor Start auf Höhe und Größe angepasst werden (Vorbildlich!) und benötigt einen Spielbereich von etwa 1-5*2m.

Das Spiel ist extrem spaßig und wer auf dem Smartphone oder Tablet gerne solche Zubereitungsspiele spielt (oder auf dem PC Cook, Serve, Delicious), der wird begeistert sein.

Die echte Krönung ist allerdings der lokale Koop Modus. Ein Spieler sitzt am PC und steuert dann die Bedienung (dann nur eine). Man steuert mittels WASD, der Maus und der Leertaste. Der andere bereitet wie gewohnt zu. Der PC Spieler rennt also zu den Gästen, ruft dem anderen den Burger zu, muss sich aber auch für sich merken, was die Gäste noch an Getränken haben wollen und holt und bringt dann entspechend alle Sachen. Das erfordert genaue Kommunikation und man hat schnell Codewörter für die einzelnen Burger ""Ich brauche einen Doppelkäse, einen Big Mac und einen Cheeseburger Ketchup""! Beide Spieler sind gleichermaßen gefordert. Einziges Manko, der PC ist entsprechend auch gefordert, da er beides berechnen muss, bei mir hat es manchmal etwas geruckelt. Aber verschmerzbar.

VRTDD ist ein absoluter Top Titel, der zeigt, was VR neben Shootern zu bieten hat und wie spaßig das ganze ist (meine Freundin, die VR nicht mag, hat mir die Brille aus der Hand gerissen, um selbst zuzubereiten und war begeistert). Es sollte definitiv mehr davon geben.

Love how they implemented 30 levels, a randomization towards certain orders with daily specials, along with an endless mode.

I would pay for this game again and again if they would add additional content, like different style restaurants, and more options for the server.

I played for several hours by myself, then one of my kids joined in as the waiter. Just... wow. If Job Simulator actually had anything challenging to do, it would have turned into this game. Wonderful!

POSITIVES:
- Decently challenging. There are 30 levels (and an endless mode I don't think I've unlocked), and while I feel I'm pretty good at the game it's going to take me a while to beat them all.
- Great price! $14.99 is the perfect price for this title. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth out of my purchase.
- Simple, addictive fun. It's like Diner Dash in that way. While many people are clammoring for deeper, longer VR experiences, I'm not sure they fully understand that the format doesn't lend itself all that well to a super deep, epic adventure. Do you really WANT to walk miles and miles and miles in VR like we do in our adventure games? I didn't think so. These types of games are great for hop-in, hop-out experiences.
- Excellent performance. It doesn't have fancy graphics, but my bare-minimum VR PC handles it excellently even with another player going.

CONS:
- Devs said elsewhere they're not really looking to add more to the game. The whole time I was playing I was thinking about how it was just CRYING OUT for more features, but I'm never going to get them, apparently.
- Pacing can be a little weird. I know they wanted to make a frantic game, but it seems like things burn too fast.
- Upgradeables are only cosmetic. I really want to upgrade my counter space, or get a bigger grill... or... well anything besides a new hat, really. Which sort of makes the money you earn seem worthless - other than keeping track of how well you did on a level, what's the point?

Best played with a friend in the same room in the ""duo"" mode (hence the title). One person waits tables at the PC, while the other makes the food in VR. Everything that goes into prepping the food, from cutting the stems off mushrooms, to squirting the ketchup, must be done manually. The difficulty ramps up with more difficult orders, leading to much cursing, arguing, and a lot of frantic fun. 

The controls for both players are intuitive, as is pretty much the whole game. I started some of my friends on level 5 or so, skipping the tutorial, and they had no problems picking it up. This isn't to say it's a breeze - it's gets pretty damn hard, and there's a very handy ""too easy"" button, for skipping ahead a few levels.

Really fun and has so much room for growth. Most VR games get stale quickly. Even with the early state this is in right now, it is still more entertaining than many others. It doesn't do much (yet), but what it does, it does well, and it is fun while doing it. So many cool things that can be done and would make it even better, one of the few VR games I am looking forward to seeing more content released.

My wishlist:
1. Money: Being fast shouldn't just get you points, I want tips that I can use to fund things. 
2. Unlockables: Can I buy that soda machine? Or upgrade it? Maybe buy a deep fryer and make fries or onion rings, to then make more money? Maybe buy a larger grill to cook more at a time? Maybe buy a new restraunt that looks different? Decorations for my restraunt?
3. More players: This one may be hard, and may not be possible. The formula now is good now with two players, and adding more may disrupt that. This would require more things for non-VR players to do though. Unless perhaps you bought a larger restraunt, but that may end up putting more strain on the chef in the end.
4. More locations: Maybe a higher level that is a nice, expensive restraunt? Or maybe a single player level that is a noodle stand? Maybe a food truck? So many possibilities to add a new spin to gameplay.
5. Food quality: Maybe buy your ingredients for each day/week. Better ingredients means happier customers. But also quality in cooking. Maybe there is an optimal time to remove food from the grill, rather than just raw/cooked/burned, which could correlate to tips.
6. Food cost: What about that burger you have to throw away? That stuff isn't free, that is lost income. Same with those ""free"" pies, they cost somebody something.


(The only thing I could criticize is that burgers cook then burn just a little too fast, but maybe that is just the chef in me. I want to put the patties on the grill first, then prepare plates and buns, but by then they are burned. Might slow down the gameplay, but could allow for preparing more meals at once and being able to deal with more customers more easily).",1484289812,1484289812,True,33,1,0.803338944911956787,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Part of me wishes the game wasn't so short and could've expanded the jobs a bit more.

This is a large part of the reason why I absolutely love Diner Duo, which not only takes the ideas from Job Simulator, but expands them into brave new territories for VR multiplayer games.

---

The game is fairly simple in concept. You're a chef making burgers for customers, and there's a bunch of different burgers you can make. But this makes way to a very challenging game of dexterity, coordination, and memory as you quickly try to make several different types of burgers for a whole diner full of impatient customers. There's plenty of fun screwing around and even some customization to go with your burger flipping goodness, and the art style is akin to Job Simulator with the robot waiters and customers who go about your diner.

But the real magic to Diner Duo is in the asymmetric co-op multiplayer, which is sadly local only. But while it may be local, it is more than worth finding a friend to try the game with.

In singleplayer, you play as a chef while the waiters show you easy-to-follow icons of the recipes you need to make as they patiently wait for you to make them. But in co-op, the second player controls the waiter. So instead of getting handy-dandy icons to look up and read, the waiter will call out orders from customers while you try and make them. This requires the chef player to start committing recipes to memory as a #1 hamburger is followed up by a #16 double-stacker cheeseburger with zuchini and mushrooms, ketchup, and mustard stacked in exactly the right order.

While the chef has to handle the cooking and recipe memorization process, the waiter meanwhile has to relay the information to the chef as they avoid customers bumping into them while carrying drinks to serve to the customers, and serve pie when they're getting particularly impatient. This in some ways can raise stress levels pretty high, but for a very well coordinated couple of players with a great sense of communication, it makes for an undeniably rewarding experience of comradarie and teamwork.

Something else that's relatively minor, but deserves some seriously special mention is the manual customization of the play space. Far few games try to contain you to a single region of your room that may end up being incredibly inconvenient, too tall or too short for your height or hard to interact with because of the scale. Plus you could hit your friend trying to cook a mean cheeseburger in co-op. But thank goodness Diner Duo came with some incredibly handy levers in the main menu to adjust height, scale, shelf height, and position of the play area. Now if we could just find a way to rotate the play area too, then it'd make it perfect.

Couple this with making the game fun to pass around to change roles or have friends try and beat your score, it becomes a very fun social experience on top of a solidly designed game. In fact, the concept is such a great and well-executed idea that it's a shame how minimal the game is in terms of actual content.

The game is something of an arcade experience, having only a decent handful of levels that last about 2-3 minutes a-piece that gradually ramp the challenge up as new recipes are thrown into the mix. But it's all over before you know it and there's not a whole lot to keep you coming back for more. For example, there's no leaderboard support. The levels show a high score but it doesn't show who got it or who was playing as what role, so it doesn't give that extra incentive to beat your couch buddies unlike something like Space Pirate Trainer. It's also a shame not to have some type of option to play online. There's customization in the way of hats for your human chef character (that are done via unlockables for completing levels) as well as customizing the waiters, but there aren't a great deal many to choose from and you can't customize your diner. Plus the only menu item in Diner Duo are burgers, so no expansive meals to rotate between just yet.

There's also a lot of tools that could add more content to the game, like workshop support, custom recipes, custom stages, customization options for the layout of the food on the table, or a way to have random players place orders to challenge the chef. There's no endless mode, options to customize your chef outside of hats, no ways to earn bonus points for timely/perfect orders, no sort of ""team vs team score attack"" mode where one team tries to shoot for a high score, trades to another team, and they try to beat it. It's things like these that could add more depth and versatility to expand such a strong concept of a game, but we're left with an extremely well-put-together tech demo that lasts far shorter than I wish it does.

---

All in all, I absolutely love Diner Duo's relatively simple but engaging gameplay, and it's an even more incredible experience when bringing a friend along. I'd definitely love to see more content added to the game or a potential sequel in the future to explore more gameplay with the waiter, more types of food to make, a more streamlined and visually-complimentary UI, and more ways to expand the arcade experience that Diner Duo excels at. Maybe if it takes only a couple more cues from the clear inspiration of Job Simulator in regards to the polish and UI, then we'll no doubt have a very special multiplayer game VR multiplayer fan should have.

That said, grab an apron, grab a friend, and open your new restaurant to serve some juicy burgers!",1482366423,1482366423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

These 2 player games, 1 in vr, 1 on the computer, have proved to be an incredibly fun mechanic in games such as 'black hat oculus' and 'Keep talking and nobody explodes'. The diner duo is another great example of this, with 1 player frantically cooking and making incrasingly complex burgers, and the other serving drinks, telling the chef what to cook, and keeping diners happy. 

The game pushes you to go faster and faster, and it makes for a quick learning experience. In no time, you'll be pre-cooking your fish, building towers of slowly rotting beef and chopping cucumber fast enough to chop fingers, all to make sure your customers get their food before they decide to leave.

The 30 levels give a decent amount of content. A level typically lasts a few minutes, but I found the final ~5 levels to require multiple attempts to complete. The endless mode gives you the oppurtunity to slowly descent into frantic cooking madness forever, with a scoreboard so you can attempt to beat your previous highscores. 

I played this game with the oculus rift and touch, and had no issues. I did have noticable fps drops with an R9 290, but I still found it comfortable enough to play without reducing the graphics. The game does require you to look behind, to see the 'star' burger that is randomly generated every round, which may be an issue for some camera setups. When looking behind with 2 front-facing cameras, I sometimes lost hand tracking, but never lost headset tracking.

　　单人模式会比较无趣一些，玩家只能一个人与系统预设的顾客进行互动，满足顾客提出的需求。而这种在游戏里还需要进行服务业工作的身份设定，于玩家而言，趣味性并不是太高，因为玩家来体验游戏的目的是放松与娱乐，而不是继续忙碌地工作。
　　而单人模式则是让玩家不停地重复繁琐的工作内容，所以玩家们在一番尝鲜之后，感受一下厨师的工作流程，就会对这样无趣的工作内容失去兴趣。
　　本地多人模式，是我们最为推荐的玩法。虽然玩家的身份依然是餐厅厨师，但有了扮演服务员的小伙伴加入，整体游戏性质将会从工作体验转换为互动。该模式下，游戏操作也非常简单，带头盔的玩家使用HTC Vive手柄，而不带头盔的玩家使用键盘来操作。
　　游戏最大的难点在于对菜品的描述。因为制作方非常巧妙地在视觉画面上做了处理，让两个进行同一款游戏的玩家，看到不一样的画面，从而让两位玩家之间需要一定量的言语交流，以弥补自己看不见的那个部分。
　　带头盔的玩家无法直接勘界餐厅内顾客的需求，必须通过扮演服务员的玩家转述才能知晓，但是游戏中汉堡种类极多，而汉堡与汉堡之间的差距，不过是酱料、肉饼数、芝士量等等细微区别。而要将这些细微的区别清楚地用言语表达，除了需要两人之间有一定默契程度，还需要两人有充足的交流量，而沟通多了，往往就会因为沟通产生一些小趣事。
　　所以沟通是游戏中最为重要的环节，尤其是扮演服务员的玩家，必须像是老妈子一样，叨念着厨师做什么样的汉堡，并且催促他，让他保持进度，才能在汉堡变质之前送出去。
　　相信很多厨师在游戏过程中，都会像我们一样，被发霉机制虐得死去活来。大多数人为了加快自己的进程，都会尝试将牛肉饼多煎一些放在一边备用。但是有了发霉设定，让牛肉饼的保存时间非常有限，看到囤积的牛肉饼接二连三地发霉，就该明白制作方希望玩家们，老老实实地一个个按照剧本做，不要妄想投机取巧。
　　《VR餐厅二人组》(VR The Diner Duo)是一款非常有意思的角色扮演游戏，非常适合在几人小聚的时候拿出来体验，尤其是扮演服务员的玩家，可以借机掌控全局，将""得罪""了你的厨师，辛苦做出来的汉堡，全数丢进垃圾桶里，气他一番。
　　游戏在Steam商店售价为48元人民币，价格比唱K、去游乐场、看电影等等聚会娱乐项都低得多，却能获得更多更特别的乐趣，推荐给所有玩家。

A fun game solo for sure but this shines in local multiplayer! Thankfully the dishes are virtual in this one guys!  ;)

Simple intuitive controls, perfect artstyle for this type of game (similar to job sim), challenging levels, endless mode for highscore chasers and a wicked catchy soundtrack. Plus the scale and height of the kitchen is fully adjustable for all sizes.

首先，这绝对是一个好游戏，价钱也不贵，买了绝对不亏。我玩的是双人联机模式。客人要什么全是靠嘴巴沟通。
单人模式由于传菜员是电脑，所以客人要什么会展示在你面前。双人客人一多,那一个叫狼狈啊!

一开始我还以为什么嘛,客人来的这么慢,so easy,还跟客人搞笑娱乐.到后面真的不行,每次都一群人来,特别是三个人.我说你们3个人,2男1女是什么鬼嘛.强行电灯泡.特别是每次不会重复的星星菜谱.我的天,这是什么组合汉堡!
你还不能提前做太多,那会滋生霉变！你也许烤好的牛排或者蘑菇就那么浪费了。
这个就类似pc里的OVERCOOKED。你需要切菜，烤肉，切蘑菇，烤蘑菇，番茄酱，咖喱酱，起司，切鱼，上下2片汉堡包
一道汉堡的工序很多很多。什么都要你自己来！后期汉堡越来越高，你一定忙的手忙脚乱！

客人是有耐心的，你上菜时间越短，他给的钱越多，如果他怒的不行。就会离开餐厅，你就会被扣一星
多人的服务员还要送饮料，不开心的还要送蛋糕安抚！绝对是一个考验你头脑和记忆力的游戏
这么好的一个休闲游戏，还能和电脑前的他她它一起互动一起娱乐一起搞基。大家轮流配合
还有什么理由不买呢？

一开始，觉得这游戏光做汉堡太容易了，一下子就玩到了20关，信心满满地准备第一次玩就全部通关，结果，没想到，21关才是挑战的开始！

客人越来越多，生意越来越好，我赚钱却越来越少！因为不够人手啊，就我一个汉堡师傅，服务员倒是有两个，客人口味也越来越刁钻，做慢了点，客人又不满意，钱给得少，超过时间就Game Over了，还不如生意不好时赚得多！

汉堡层数越来越高，馅越来越多，真是考验手脚协调和记忆力，节奏乱了就手忙脚乱，做多了还有点耗体力。煎牛排、蘑菇、鱼肉，要注意别煎太久，久了会焦；还要注意拿原材料时别碰到桌面等东西，拿起来后放久了也不行，不然会生细菌，会弄脏汉堡，客人就会很不满意了。

我暂时只玩了单人游戏模式，多人游戏模式是一个人在电脑上做服务员接客递菜递饮料等，你就用VIVE做汉堡，两个模式一忙不过来就都会手忙脚乱，所以这种多人模式应该会很欢乐。蛮好玩的一个游戏，只不过光做汉堡还是比较单调了点，希望以后有更丰富的菜和餐厅。",1478238050,1478238050,True,2,1,0.546218514442443848,0,True,False,False,False,,,
