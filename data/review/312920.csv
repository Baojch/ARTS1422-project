A big issue is the difficulty settings. At amature level you'll win 60-0 (10 minute halves which is the default setting I believe. Yes, you can play 40 minute real time halves, but c'mon, how many people play that way? Especially if you're playing career mode). Next level up, at Pro level, you may win the odd game 12-6. You'll loose a bunch at the same score...and those will be your 'barn burner' type games...the 'exciting' games. Get ready for a bunch of 6-4 games. The higher levels are an absolute defensive grind the whole game. 
As it's described within the game, the difficulty levels are based on how effective your offense will be against the AI. The AI's offence doesn't nearly improve as much as the defence does at Pro level and above. There definately needed to be a difficulty setting between amature and pro or a way to adjust the AI's offesive ability. I can't imagine what playing on Veteran and Legend are like.
Teleporting tackles. Sometimes it looks like a magnet was turned on between the two players. There will be so many times when you have run your players into great 'gaps' only to watch one of the defenders 'superman' to your ball carrier. And unless you hit a button, the tackle will be made %100 of the time regardless of: which direction the defender was facing before the jump to light speed, or what lines your attacker is running, or the size of the attacker vs defender, the players 'tackling' stat, etc. None of that will matter unless you make a move to avoid it, which is just very poor mechanics. You'll think you're by the defender and then, in a flash, you're not. The teleporting tackle is also the main reason you'll be a defensive god almost right from the start.
There's no tutorial.
Passing from dummy half is a nightmare. Passing in general is finicky. Offloads are almost impossible.
The 'Career' mode is pffff.
I think if you solely plan on playing this with your mates, then it'll be ok. If you're looking to play against the computer/career mode etc. Then save your money.

I write this review as a massive RL fan and RLL fan, having put hundreds of hours into RLL 1 and 2. 
RLL 1 and 2 were not perfect games and had a lot of bugs which were very frustrating. The biggest in my opinion, being the inevitable intercept if you attempted a cut out ball in RLL2 (I'm sure fans of the series know of what I speak). However they were very playable and very fun. The career mode in RLL2 was clearly modelled of FIFA and that is a good thing. The graphics weren't groundbreaking, but for the most part you could recognise the faces of the players.

Now, to RLL3. It is essentially a reskinned version of RLL2, with the intercept bug fixed. Unfortunately, a series of new, increasingly frustrating bugs emerged. All of the players have the same, unrecognisable beat up looking face (I think they resemble Sam Burgess), and the game is either frustratingly difficult or way too easy, depending on difficulty setting. 

Defending: If you play it on pro or veteran, a high ball is undefendable, Your opponent will score almost every time. It has the illusion of you being able to compete for the ball, but you will almost never win. 
If you are engaged in a one on one strip. You will lose. Nothing stops it. 
You can not select your fullback to stop a line break. It will stick with the winger or whoever was initially in pursuit, despite your best button mashing efforts and yelling at the screen. If you do manage to use your fullback as a last resort, it's 50/50 as to whether he will make the tackle, or be stepped or run over the top of. There is no combatting this, despite attempting new strategies. 
Your markers will appear to be on an onside position, however will occasionally suddenly become offside when you attempt a tackle, giving away a penalty. This happens too often.

Attacking: Rarely will you be able to produce a decent linebreak, and even rarer will you have anyone in support if you do.
The forwards do not go forward and are tackled imiediately when contact is made. 
There is no longer an option to run with the dummy half as he is immediately tackled, so it's pointless.
Offloads? Negative. You'll pull one off as often as a rocking horse takes a dump. The controls are unresponsive. You can attempt a pass just before taking a hit up, but nothing will happen and you will be tackled with the ball. This allows almost no second phase play.
If you attempt to pass from the ground after winning the scrum, you will either throw it on the ground or it will be a forward pass to someone in the scrum. You have to physically carry the ball away from the scrum before risking a pass. By then, any chance of a decent backline play is gone.
The only way I can get field position is to attempt 40/20s. They are only possible during one half of the game when the wind is on your side, or don't try it. Even then, you will often over kick it and it will go out on the full, because the controls are very hit and miss.

Player management: You cannot select a goal kicker! It will choose one for you. Usually the playmaker, even if their kick stats are poor.
Career mode: Coaching. The FIFA model used so fluidly by RLL2 is gone. There's little in the way of choice and it seems way too ""locked in"" with your choices. 
Career mode. Rookie superstar.  You can only control one player in this mode. His stats will only improve if he has his hands on the ball. So, you either spend the whole game trying to get into a position to receive the ball (and then get tackled immediately as I already described), or your player just won't improve. He also gets subbed real quick if he doesn't touch the ball. That is out of your control.

Rookie/Novie mode etc. Give the ball to any player and they will run the length of the field and score everytime. It becomes a borefest. There's no satisfying middle ground between too easy and impossibly hard. 

In summary, I could put on RLL 2 and play all day (spent many a hungover Saturday doing just that). This game, I struggle to finish more than 2 games, and that's after several rage quits. I keep coming back to it every month or so hoping for a different experience, but I get frustrated and bored just as quickly.

Give this game a try simply because there's no other Rugby League video game franchises, but prepare to be frustrated.",1491186398,1491186686,False,14,2,0.593279123306274414,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I know alot of people seem to hate on this game (for whatever reason) -- but I've never found the difficulty hard -- even on Veteran/Legend difficulty. It's all about using the tools the game provides like setting your defensive line and selecting the right players.

This game deserves much more credit than it is given --- it's an EA quality game by a much smaller studio. The graphics are amazing (that grass never fails to impress me in game), and the mechanics work well mostly.

There are some things that needed fixing of course, like accidental off-side (on the opponent's team) -- and things like accidental knock-on if a pass is thrown into an opponent etc --- but for the most part I actually enjoy making the ""AI"" errors -- it adds authenticity.

How many times have you seen your team make a stupid pass that goes to noone? Every damn week (well, if you're a Knights fan at least).

Anyway --- top game, been a year and still loving it -- 61 hours now. If anyone still reads this hit me up and let's get some online going.

Main criticisms:

- Glitches like how players are locked into running in the direction they are facing when the hooker passes the ball and this sometimes leads to a forward pass being given

The biggest problem with the game for me is the pacing which feels like it affects eveything else. A slow game speed option would probably go a long way to improving things along with a rework of how ratings affect outcomes. 

Too often, a knock on will lead to the opponents prop picking up the ball and running the distance for a try. Fullback positioning is terrible. Offloads have to be well timed and feel like too much of a lottery in comparison to reality. The passing game is stifled by a flat backline and the occurance of errors. What the game rewards you for is playing simple footy and trying to beat your opponent one on one with a side step or a fend - which is fine, but the lack of other options makes it a little boring. I think the problem stems from the lack of ability to establish a realistic and entertaining offensive game without it being overpowered against the AI programming, which is a shame.

The most important aspect of this game is how it feels and plays. Overall they got it right, tackles have weight to them, you can produce fantastic and interesting plays to score an amazing try.  Some minor problems with the defence, the AI can sometime cut through your defence like a knife through butter, but im sure with additional patches this will improve. The career mode is fantastic and versitile. The difficulty levels are very challenging, not like fifa where you can have it on the hardest difficulty after 2 weeks. After amateur you will be at pro level for quite a while.  

You can pick your favourite super league or nfl team and win all the trophies or you can pick teams from 2 leagues below and work your way up... plenty to do.

The inclusion to add community created teams and players is excellent.

I love the indepth player a team customisation as well as the facilities to create custom leagues and tournaments.

However the gameplay in matches is not all that great, bodering on awful. The passing is a massive hit or miss experience, usually ignoring the button press entirely especially when a quick pass is needed. You'll find your player just carry on running rather than pass or pass many times in quick succsession until he thrwos it out of bounds.

Alternativly when you are on a break the opposing AI can grab you at any angle from seemingly any distance, going from facing the wrong way to an instant 180 and bringing you down. The few feet between players is ignored allowing the opposing team to morph the gap and grab you, allowing no real pacing breaks or runs. Because this isn't Union there is only 5 attempts per passge to try and get a run going. Another dead option is the drop ball, if you manage to catch the high ball your player is instantly barraged and the sloppy pass system means you lose a passage of play.

There needs to be an auto player switch on tackles or at very least an overhaul. It takes a lot of learning to get the right player in the right place and make the tackle, a little automated help would go a long way as it really interupts the flow of the game. The manual switching especially at harder difficulties is pretty shambolic, finding a lot of times a breaking run will occur because the switching has skipped the last player in play, frantically watching your player marker skip through the entire team. There is an option to skip to player closest to the ball but i find myself wondering what ball the computer thinks is in play, most of the time i'm running at the ball boy.

The 'tutorial' section is more like a challenge section with not enough of the games basics covered, a practice zone would of been better suited. With a game featuring this many rules and possible plays, a tutorial is a must, especially how to change the tactics which are scarcely mentioned. Look in the options for gameplay controls and find all the buttons and what kicks you can perform in there, this does a better job teaching you the game than the tutorial section.

There is a humungous leap in difficulty from Rookie to Amateur, it feels like beginner to pro in one quick leap, offering no subtle difficulty change meaning you will jump from dominating with no retaliation to instantly held and losing. 

I'd barely recommend it, it can be fun but the issues with gameplay are just game destroying at times. Everything but the rugby is done well.",1446390030,1467237183,True,2,0,0.500126242637634277,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Good character customisation in Career mode

AI is mostly very good (except on the lowest difficulty, where everyone has the IQ of a beanbag) and lacks the sheer stupidity of the AI players in other sports games (Still looking at DBC)
AI players don't warp around the field breaking the sound barrier to get into a position to mess with the human player (My eyes have not yet left DBC)
Overall, the best Rugby League game on the market today.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
Fierce difficulty curve, the game is absolutely brutal to pick up. The difference between Rookie (the lowest) and Amateur (the next one up) is like the difference between fighting a baby cat and a full grown tiger, and there's like four more difficulties on top of that. I only tried playing on Legend (the highest) for about twenty minutes. If you can play and win on Legend regularly, try to contact either Mal Meninga or Laurie Daley as you are probably qualified to play in the next State of Origin (Please be advised that you must be from NSW to apply for the NSW Origin team. State restrictions do not apply in QLD.)

Tutorials are horrendously poor. If you aren't already very familiar with the rules, field positions and basic strategy of Rugby League, this game will make no effort to teach you. The 'drills' are presented as training, but in actual fact they are more like particularly difficult challenges no new player in their right mind will be able to accomplish. They are quite fun to go back and attempt after a bit of experience, though. 

Very minor occasional graphical glitches, like the player's foot sometimes getting stuck in the pitch and shaking as the game tries to decide whether you should be in the ground or on it. This so far has not affected gameplay and is a purely cosmetic issue.",1446127842,1446127861,True,3,1,0.501381337642669678,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros
+ Easy to pick up
+ Vast array of teams and stadiums
+ Can create your own teams and rosters. Loads of options for team kits.
+ On harder levels the game feels more like RL i.e. battling for field position, territory.  The realism is getting better with each patch
+ Good developers who listen and support the product. They've already made positive changes to the game e.g. the AI doesn't fling the ball around as much as they first did.

Neither good nor bad
* Career mode is solid although not much depth to it
* Playing a season is good but game doesn't have the depth of ageing, youth development etc. that you get with the multi-million pound projects like FIFA, but that's a minor issue considering how desperate I was for a decent rugby game)

Cons
- Occasional squad and roster disruptions when you download teams (this can be remedied by deleting official clubs which returns the squad back to its default state)
- Some player look-a-likes aren't that great (this is more of an issue with the UK teams, which I'm more familiar)
- Player ratings in the Super League a bit out of date e.g. Alex Walmsley rated 79 (minor quibble though that)
- Custom players seems to be an issue as I can't create new ones

However as there is NO decent RU games out there I gave this a try and was So So happy I did.

Positives:
1.Graphics are great comparable to any AAA sports title. I have had no drop in FPS or any issues with a 3 year old rig on higher settings.

2.Gameplay is smooth and as far as I am aware pretty accurate to RL play style. tackles are fun and you haev a lot of options of set plays and tactical calls re defence alignment etc. 

3.Content - the create a player most games have these days its as detailed as I would want without being over the top. Carrer mode can swap between manager, existing ""superstar"" or your created player which gives it a fresh take. 

Cons: 

Very few. However if I was being picky. 

1. Key mapping/bindings I am happy playing with a controller but I would have thought its not challenging to allow me to alter my controls. I usually play with Keyboard but without key mapping its impossible. Key mapping on controller perhaps not as important but would be preferred. 

2. Attacking set plays: such as Switch, loop moves and miss moves. You can elect to throw a pass 1, 2,or 3 players out but thats it really. Considering there is defensive tactical alignment and altering defensive lines etc I would have hoped for a slightly more detailed attacking system. currently the attacking ""set play"" consists of two types of backline set up for kicking options Thats it. The rest is free for all.  

Overall though its a really fun game with a lot of content, completely meets my needs for a rugby fix. Would recommend.",1444328177,1444328177,True,2,1,0.527476727962493896,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Tutorial\Practice mode is great and more helpfull (yet a bit confusiing at first, wait for visual comand prompts before acting) than the previous released game.

I had a terrible issue where the frame rate would just tank all the time, wasn't because of my rig as it is good enough for this game.

Posted on the forums, had a terrible feeling we were getting another shoddy pc port of a game, dev replied within minutes of me bringing up the issue and told me how to fix it for the mean time and that there would be a patch in the next day that would fix the issue completely.

So the quick fix worked and true to the devs word a patch was released the next day that took care of the glitch and there were no more frame drops.

Now to the review itself. Big Ant and Tru Blu really do have to be commended for the product that they've released. As a small time dev and publisher they've released a game that can be held in the same regard as fifa and the 2k series, despite the modest budget that they had to work with.

Everything about the game of rugby league is captured in this digital rendition. Players behave like they should, they move like they should, and they mostly look like their real life counter parts.

The game has all of the official players and teams for the southern hemisphere but not for the North, depending on where you live this is either going to be a problem or not one at all, and even in saying that, there is the awesome fan hub which allows you to download created players that other people have made, some of them are truley awesome and look like the real people they are based off of, so getting the right players for the northen hemisphere should be no trouble at all.

The game has all the usual content you'd expect from a sports game. Quick match, online, career and so on, but it's the options like being able to take control of your favourite superstar and guide him through his career or take a rookie from the age grades on up to representative footy that make this game even more fun than it already is.

During your season you will be faced with optional challenges to raise your clubs finances, like completing so many tackles or fends in a match, these finances help when you're trying to lure the next super star to your club for the next season as you have players coming off contract, but these optional challenges are not actually required for you to be able to recruit and don't break the game in anyway.

You'll also have the a few judiciary hearings along the way as no doubt your players are going to get pinged for wreckless tackles and face suspension, another facet of the game that just adds to the realism, being able to decide how you plead is icing on the cake

The graphics for this game are really good, the game has amazing IQ and is capable of supporting 4k resolution should you have the machine capable of running it.

The commentary is sadly mostly the same as the Rugby League Live 2 with Andrew Voss and Gus calling the plays, It's not too bad and is actually a lot better than other games that you'll play

The sound is great at capturing the atmosphere of a real life footy game. What with the sound of the excited fans the explosions of fire works when someone goes over for a try or when a forward crunches into a would be tackler, and it's even better with a good pair of headphones.

If there was one negative that really needs to brought to attention it'd be the fact that the game has to be online to be played. I can understand why the dev and publisher took this route though, League is niche game and piracy eating into already small sales would cripple this franchise and bring about the end of future pc releases.

All in all this is a fantastic sports game and shouldn't be avoided if you're a fan of League. Even comparing this game to the rugby union games that have been released in recent months and years just shows that you don't need a ""AAA"" budget to accuratley capture the heart and soul of  a game, just a dev that wants to please the fans and put out something that they're proud off.

I have no doubt that Big Ant and Tru Blu are very proud of this, and they have every right to be.",1443757461,1443757461,True,86,5,0.868902027606964111,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Not to much of a learning curve (still don't know how to drag tackle) but i'm a winger.

Over all feel and look of ground's is Magic all i need now is up up cronulla yelling in background would be sick!!!
The ground's themself's the pitch condition is somethink special THE GRASS looks so sick.

-Menus are easy simple look good.
-Gameplay if you have played RLL1 & RLL2 clear your brain of them this is LIGHT YEARS AHEAD
-Forward's do there job and sometimes they don't,But they are important it's a team game.
-Online don't know yet havent tryed but will update when i do it's beer day today so will update.

-Remember this is no EA/FIFA/PES.But in this Game you can feel the love in every detail which makes this stand out.
- Be a pro - WOW just WOW this mode so rule's and the perk system is just amazing i tend to use it in last couple match's before final's so that the Sharkie's win final's.
You can create your player edit him at anytime hair/bread/Tattoo's etc which is cool not locked behind same oops made a mistake cannot change or have to start a new career.
No 1 tip in be a pro But you fitness up because you could play 2 game's maybe one and get knocked out for rest of season lol.
- Fanhub has great community updates on player's,Ref's,Team's.
- If you have played Rugby or League and understand running line's looking for gap's this give you the control to be Stacey Jone's it's epic

I remember watching gameplay on ps4 and was like mm it's alright but after buying it and playing myself WOW just WOW.
Cannot more than Recommend this game this blew ARL 96 of my top list :D
10/10

Also would like to Thank the PS4 and Xbox One players for testing everythink out for us so us the Master race could have a great game at Launch 
Thank you to Ross 'The Boss"" and his team at BigAnt for putting up with us and beeing pretty freakn awsome Dev listening to input and output.
Cannot be more happier with this :D


Quick update if your wanting to go Online and play had great weekend playing BUT!!!
My biggest concern is the Ai and the passing forward and reset's or running away into sideline when  you clearly have the stick facing the other way then the ball gets passed willy nilly.

Top Tip No1 for Online Go the Warrior's look at the guy at the top of Leader Boards.
Shaun Johnson off kick off 100% he'll score.
It's like Shaun Johnson is Jonah Lomu fend's everyone even the biggest forward's

Don't Rage quit make you look dumb keep playing learn from losses took me about Million game's it felt like to get me on my feet then Win's started coming.

Over all Online is alright easy Spam try's Gaps the AI leave are soo bad or they walk off to the pub let other team score.Or even better chuck the ball when you havent even pressed the pass button.

Gotta say this Online mode tested my rage and glad i'm not going to be playing any of it any more.

The game on PC really puts the console versions to shame. The visuals are absolutely stunning, esp with Sweetfx enabled. The grass in particular is the best I have seen of any sports game, and the created players really come to life. In terms of eye candy, you simply could not ask for any more. The gameplay is extremely smooth and responsive, and it runs perfectly all settings maxed out on my fairly moderate system. 
This game has real depth and the more you play it, the more you realise just how much of a simulation it is. The ball physics in partcular are first class. I feel that the compeition options and customisation could be a bit more expansive like DBC, but hopefully this will be added down the line in patches etc. The fanhub is again the best player creator I have seen to date, and with enough time and patience, it is possible to create players who really look authentic, visually. BUT.......I personally do not like everything about the way the stats system is done. I realise they did it this way to prevent cheating and having super players, but as it stands you are not able to create players with their unique and specific skill set. Many people have voiced their concern about this on the forums, and seeing as Big Ant are great listeners to the public, I hope that this will be changed in a patch, so that we can alter the stats individually, so that each player has a true to life representation of their skill set. 
Another area where the PC version shines is in the modding department. Already we can load custom Jerseys and Logos, but hopefully this will be greatly expanded down the line, to include Balls, Referee Kits, Field Markings, Adboards, Crowd Clothing etc. The mere possibility is extremely mouthwatering and adds such great authenticty, especially for the retro/classic content.
So is it worth getting the PC version.....ABSOLUTELY!!!!! Why? The visuals are far more stunning, it runs alot smoother, the mods will be epic AND it will see alot more patches and support (ala DBC).
The lads at Big Ant deserve a medal for this masterpiece and I know with a little fine tuning and expanded options and mods it will be the ultimate Rugby League gaming experience.

I'm playing career mode on pro difficulty as a fullback and my team keep making stupid mistakes which is frustrating. I'm hoping it's because i'm on a noob team and nothing to do with the AI. Tackles feel really good, overall it's good value for money,  NRL fans should definately pick this up.

I should advise you need a controller to play the game.",1443694256,1443766172,True,1,0,0.501088559627532959,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I personally played Union rather than League, and so have a very limited knowledge of this code, however I've been looking for a really well made NFL, RFU or RFL game on the PC for.. well... years.

Firstly this feels like an AAA studio game. The menus and presentation are slick and apart from a couple of very minor UI issues (like why would I want to play as any other team during career mode? Why do I have to keep rechoosing my team each week?) but these are all minor and the devs seem to be patching already (day one).

The graphics are stunning, and it all runs very smoothly (over 100fps on my GTX970)

I'd go as far as to say this looks and feels like a FIFA or 2K title.

The gameplay is tough and whilst there are Drills which help improve the basics you'll have to figure out the rules and tactics of the game as you go along.

It has all the key elements of a modern sports sim, with a My Player career mode, coach career mode, exhibitions, leagues and multiplayer etc.

The sound is pretty realistic and on the whole very authentic, with some great bone crunching tackles. The commentators aren't quite as varied as their FIFA/2K counterparts but they are a million times better than Blood Bowl 2...

If you follow Rugby League I'm guessing you aren't reading this because you're too busy playing this game, if you like sports games but aren't sure about League or this game you should jump in!

ive been playing rll2 on 360 and couldnt wait for rll3 last night i was just going through the store and saw it bought it straight away downloaded it and then played it, first thoughts everything rll2 was plus more. looks better, gameplay is smoother and doesnt feel so blocky it just have that nice feel kinda like fifa. spent about 5 hours straight on be a pro mode didnt realise the sun came up. so yeah its kinda good.

Excellent representation and when the prop bulldozes in to your scrum half, the controller tells you that hurt. Great work in fluidity, and graphically it is a pleasure.
The career mode is fun, although lack of moves in offence takes some reading of the game, which new to RL players may find frustrating, especially if they play in the cold yorkshire rain.
