As a sequel to the first game, it is clear that this title has taken great care in building upon its predecessor's strengths while also bringing new innovations to the table.

From the very beginning, players are drawn into the rich and complex narrative, which weaves together themes of love, loyalty, and betrayal with intricate detail. The storyline follows the epic journey of a hero who must navigate a dangerous and ever-changing world while simultaneously building and maintaining relationships with a diverse cast of allies.

What sets Agarest Generations of War 2 apart from other RPGs is the depth of its character development. Each hero and heroine boasts their unique personalities, motivations, and backstories that evolve throughout the game. The ability to build romantic relationships between characters also adds a unique and compelling layer of gameplay, as players must navigate tricky dialogue trees and make strategic decisions that affect their romantic partners' affections.

The game's mechanics are equally impressive. Battles are turn-based and tactical, with players positioning their characters strategically on the battlefield to maximize their attacks and defensive capabilities. The game's progression is also skillfully crafted, with a wide range of upgrades and enhancements available to players that allow them to customize their heroes and heroines' abilities.

Graphically, the game is a visual masterpiece. The character designs are striking and detailed, and the landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful. The game's music and sound effects also add an extra layer of immersion, with epic orchestral scores that underscore the game's dramatic moments.

Overall, Agarest Generations of War 2 is a must-play title for any fan of strategic RPGs.

The graphics and music are very good considering the game's age. The sprites in particular are excellent, and convey the characters well.

From a story perspective, Agarest 2 brings some interesting ideas to the table; it wants to explore topics that most JRPGs breeze past, such as fate and the relationship between gods and humans. Unfortunately, it didn't accomplish the level of depth that these topics deserve. Even the elusive true ending wraps up with a lot of platitudes about working together in spite of uncertainty and suffering.

Mechanically, Agarest 2 is a bit difficult to get ahold of. The tutorials do not explain its many systems well. Fortunately, once you begin to understand its systems, they aren't actually as complicated as they look. The game isn't very well balanced, but if you understand the mechanics, it's generally too easy rather than too hard. In turn-based combat, it still strikes me as bizarre that there's very little importance to whose turn is currently occurring.
The game also wants you to do an excessive amount of grinding. They guide you to it using dungeons and quests, but by the time I arrived in the late-game, I was bored.

Finally, the elephant in the room. In addition to a JRPG, this is also an ecchi game. I'm no prude, but I found the vast majority of the ""erotic"" scenes and mechanics to be intrusive, immersion-breaking, and cringe-worthy. I didn't mind the two cases that were directly related to plot and character development, but those were the exception rather than the rule.

On the whole, Agarest 2 is ok. It's fine to try it out if you're out of good JRPGs to play, or just want to try something different. It's also fine to skip it.",1660410133,1660410133,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cons:

-O sistema de batalha é um downgrade bizarro em comparação aos jogos anteriores da franquia tornando-o extremamente esquisito e maçante.
-Missões secundarias da guild passaram a ser obrigatórias para progressão da historia, o que tira completamente o sentido de ""secundarias"".
-Encontros aleatórios no mapa que agora é aberto, coisa que no primeiro titulo da franquia so havia dentro das dungeons, quebrando completamente a imersão do jogo.
-O jogo não te da direções de onde ir ou o que fazer parecendo um jogo dos anos 80 e 90 algo que ao meu ver é um retrocesso para os dias de hoje ainda mais levando em conta que jogo JRPG desde os anos 90.
-Retiraram a opção de cancelar os efeitos das skills durante o combate, agora tem que segurar ""start"" pra cancelar as animações.
-Por causa de todos os motivos anteriores o jogo ficou extremamente lento de se jogar, joguei ele inteiro usando speed hack do C.E pra passar rapido as batalhas.
-O sistema de ""affection"" com aquele bath game é a coisa mais terrivel e não jogavel que existe.

Pros:

-A arte é bonita e ainda tem belas ""waifus"" nota-se que investiram mais nisso.
-A trilha sonora é razoavelmente boa, nenhuma ""masterpiece"" mas é boa.
-Quanto a historia não vou falar que é a mais incrível mas quem jogou os titulos anteriores da franquia ja sabiam o que esperar nesse game, portanto, mais do mesmo.

Just like the first two games in that regard.  The combat system is entirely different, and many people feel for the better.  Here's the thing:  I loved the combat system in the first two games.  It is no longer a turn-based tactical system.  No more moving characters on a grid for advantage, no more extended areas for chained attacks.  The things I liked most about the game series were removed, which supposedly ""improved"" the system.

[u]Info[/u]
•	Intricate battle system. Some have complained that it’s complicated. I don’t find it to be complicated; it’s easy to learn. You don’t have to use all the various skills the game puts out there, if it’s overwhelming to you. The game wants you to strategize despite it no longer being a true strategy RPG like the first game. If you don’t like thinking out your moves in battle, then this game isn’t for you.
•	Three generations. Three marriages. Two offspring. 
o	Three women to choose from in 1st and 2nd generation, then five to choose from for the 3rd. 
o	Who the protagonist marries affects stats, weapon use, and appearance of the offspring. Going to the alchemy shop in the game shows the player a preview of what the next gen protagonist will be like. 
•	Is it “grindy”? Yes, very. In fact, there is an achievement for doing 1,000 battles. Even if you play on easy mode, the bosses can be challenging, so leveling your party members is required.
•	Is it difficult to get the true ending? There are a lot of missable events, so it’s easy to f*ck up the true ending if you’re not closely following a walkthrough. There are many walkthroughs for this game by this point, as the game is several years old. 
•	Extremely frustrating mini-game. Most of the people who’ve played this game hate the mini-game that can be used to boost the affection levels of the romanceable characters. [b]The mini-game is not required to achieve the true ending.[/b] If you follow a good walkthrough, the mini-game is completely avoidable and you can max out the affection levels of the women entirely through dialogue choices and triggering events. 
•	Yes, the western version of the game is altered. … Because pedophilia is f*cking gross. In the original Japanese version, Fiona is sexualized while she’s still a little girl. Like, an actual little girl. A child. It isn’t until the 3rd generation that she becomes fully an adult (because that’s how high elves age, apparently). Instead of being glad that the ESRB didn’t allow that sh*t, there are actually people complaining about it. Wow, I dunno about you all, but complaining that you can’t sexualize a little girl seems an awful lot like you’re a damn pedophile. If you’re a pedo and need gross hentai to keep you from actually harming real-life children, wtfe, but keep that sh*t out of mainstream games. 

[u]Complaints[/u]
•	No way to check progress on those 1,000 battles. At the time I wrote this review, I was at the end of the game and completely finished with it other than the Kill-o-Battle achievement. Battle after battle after battle … where does it end? Am I close? Should I just say “f*ck it” and not perfect the game? Ugh!
•	A few typos here and there. That’s inexcusable when you’re a AAA company with plenty of resources to hire people to proofread. 
•	Gross CGs. I know that’s more of a personal taste, but like … there’s also such a thing as bad taste. Like the other games, the CGs are catered to the most basic cis/hetero men.
•	Heavily overused Japanese clichés. 
•	Plot holes and convoluted story. 
•	Extremely dislikeable 2nd gen protagonist who, at one point, makes r@pe threats. He’s all talk, but still, that’s uncalled for. 
•	No dark-skinned characters whatsoever. This game has [i]a lot[/i] of characters too. Dark elves? Not dark. Other unique races to Agarest’s world? Not dark. At this point, it’s blatantly obvious that it was a conscious choice to not put in any dark-skinned characters. Laziness at best, racism at worst. 
•	The game crashes for absolutely no reason occasionally.

[u]Good Stuff[/u]
•	While I did say that the story is convoluted, it is still interesting. Far more interesting than the story in Mariage. For the most part, it has a very serious tone with occasional humor (or attempted humor). Which makes the ecchi stuff all the more contrasting when it occurs. 
•	Beautiful CGs. Most of them are good, despite the few gross ones. 
•	Methodical, addictive gameplay … for those who like this sort of gameplay. 
•	Side romances between Jainus & Chloe, then Ignis & Cynthia. (Required for the true ending, btw.)
•	Decent plot twist. It genuinely surprised me. 
•	Despite not keeping track of how many battles you’ve done, it at least tells you how many of each enemy you’ve fought. This is useful for commissions at the Hunter’s Guild, as many of them ask for certain amounts of enemies slain. 
•	Fun weapon, armor, and accessory crafting.

1) Очень медленные анимации открытия меню и в битвах. К счастью, лечится использованием того же спидхака в Cheat Engine на четырёхкратной скорости. Анимации едут крышей немного, но хотя бы  сражения, загрузки и беготня становятся быстрее. Это ускоряет прохождение минимум в два раза.
2) Гринд. Вся игра (если не читерить и не платить за DLC)  - это тотальный гриндфест. Качаться, качаться, выбивать деньги, вещи и просто офигевать.
3) Карта мира большая, но довольно пустая. Нельзя посмотреть отдельно, чтобы понять, где какая локация. Проблема для первой трети игры. Дальше уже всё запоминается (т.к. новые локации появляются очень редко). Некоторые местности затираются до дыр, в то время как остальные используются от силы раз-два (да, первый город и первый лес, я смотрю на вас).
4) Отсутствует дневник или возможность напомнить самому себе, куда же дальше идти. В некоторые моменты особенно выбешивает, т.к. непонятно, на какой из пяти островов, мать вашу, идти.
5) Сюжет банален. Второстепенные персонажи прописаны лучше, чем основные. Если выполнять квесты (заказы в местной гильдии) героев второго плана, разумеется.
6) Отсутствие возможности повторить обучение в игре. Особенно феерично это в плане спец. приёмов, про которые указывают в прологе, а появляются они через часов 10-15 игры. К счастью, есть мануал, там разъяснения даны относительно нормально.
7) Перевод без японских ""хонорификов"" а-ля -сан, -тян, -кун, -сама. Местами переписали текст едва ли не целиком для упрощения понимания. В принципе, ничего в этом плохого для меня нет. Чай, фэнтезийный мир Агареста, а не Японии. Так что это по сути вкусовщина.
8) Боевая система, в которой интуитивно фиг разберёшься, нужно читать мануал, чтобы понять важные нюансы.
9) Куча ненужного фансервиса. К счастью, в стиме зацензуренная версия, так что самый спорный контент отсутствует.
10) Ужасающее управление в мини-играх, связанное с плохой поддержкой мыши. Она есть, но на фиговом уровне. Если будете играть в мини-игру в бане на клавиатуре, то проклянёте всё и вся. А зачем эта мини-игра? Способ избежать гринда, чтобы получить ""тру"" концовку.
11) Легко запороть прохождение в самом начале, получив флаги плохой концовки сразу же в первом поколении из трёх. Узнаете об этом, правда, вы лишь из гайда или в самом конце игры. Концовка эта бессмысленна и беспощадна.

《阿加雷斯特战记2》是由IF社研发的一款角色扮演类游戏，游戏最初版本发售于2010年。为SRPG游戏系列作品,PC由Ghostlight LTD发行，游戏讲述了一股炫目的光给世界带来了破坏，从那之后恶魔像瘟疫一样在整个大陆蔓延开来。一个名叫Weiss的年轻人失去了记忆，从神秘的女子那里他知道自己居然犯下了弑神的重罪，为了赎罪他必须使用这股弑神的力量去拯救那些逝去的生命。

作为一款12年便已发售的游戏，游戏画面还是比较不错的，虽然人物在游戏中采用了四头身的轻Q版形象，但是人物的动作表现却相对比较丰富。环境画面与怪物的模型不够精细，却也还过得去。反正就如同游戏的内容一样，玩家最关心的还是游戏中可以攻略的美少女，而这一部分，还是花费了相当多的心思的。撇开别的部分先不提，在画面方面，如果是没有移植的版本，虽然瑕疵较多，但是尚可接受。

本作最大的魅力就是，和各世代所登场的三位女主角结婚后生下的孩子能力和容貌都会有变化，根据血之魂系统，如果和女主角好感度较低就结婚的话，虽然说也能顺利的生下孩子，但是由于女主角的好感度较低，孩子的能力上面就有可能发生很大的变化，一些日常的男主角、女主角们的剧情交流都和好感度有关连，少女才是本作的核心。不但数量多，而且质量高，并且还能生孩子，其中当然还有大量擦边球的CG，宅男们有福了。

一款中规中矩的SRPG游戏，评分6.5/10

《Agarest Generations of War 2（阿加雷斯特战记2）》是一款由地雷社开发Ghostlight LTD发行的日系角色扮演策略类游戏。游戏讲述了由于男主的弑神举动，于是导致魔物泛滥，世界出现了大危机，为了能够赎罪并且阻止魔物，男主决定再次踏上旅途，去弥补他所犯下的罪过，游戏也将于此拉开了帷幕。

[h1] 游戏的画面感	[/h1]
此游戏原先是psp平台上的，现在移植到了pc上，在画面上有着一定的重制，比以前更加的清晰了，而且游戏还秉承了系列的一贯的作风，也就是充满福利的CG（比如洗澡CG，浴巾CG，衣服破裂CG等等），数量上还是很多的，总是可以满足你的需要，人物的立绘也很不错的，男的英俊女的美丽，十分的养眼，微微的抖动感觉更加充满魅力，动感十足，就是表情上稍有欠缺，感觉有点僵硬。

[h1] 游戏的音乐与CV	[/h1]
游戏的音乐搭配还是很不错的，很配合游戏的剧情的推进，渲染出很不错的气氛，让剧情有着很不错的感染力，游戏的CV的实力也是非常的强劲，是每一个人物都充满着自己独有的魅力，塑造了人物的性格。

[h1] 游戏的玩法	[/h1]
游戏的战斗节奏还是挺慢的，打一把需要很长的时间。而且游戏的机制变得更加复杂，难度上升了好多，游戏是可以上阵四人的，然后可以控制他们依次行动，可以根据敌人类型来使用不同的方式攻击，在将装备啥的进行强化并学习新的技能，这些都可以提高你的战斗力，然后就是技能协同攻击有时也可以造成不错的效果。

[h1] 游戏的优点	[/h1]
+相对精致的CG和人物立绘
+还行的背景音乐与CV
+相对较复杂的战斗系统

[h1] 游戏总评	[/h1]
总而言之，这款游戏还是挺需要耐心的，主要推荐给喜爱策略并有耐心的爱好者。

《阿加雷斯特战记2》是一款PS3时代的充满了特色机制的回合制RPG，讲述男主弑神而使得魔物泛滥，男主及其子嗣需要成为复活神的容器，于是这场斩妖除魔、谈情说爱的旅途便这样开始了。游戏的画面表现较为落后，战斗系统相当复杂，立绘的RY、福利的CG以及极为创意的诞下子嗣开始下一轮剧情的设定都令人想入非非，虽然根据个人喜好可能不是很好玩，但是着实好看。

[h1]画面：落后的战斗，福利的CG[/h1]

由于是PS3时代的老游戏，画面的表现可想而知，世界地图和战斗场面的古旧感扑面而来，粗糙的场景建模，糊到不行的敌人和我方小人，有些敌人虽然是3D建模，却依然粗糙得不忍直视，闹着玩儿一样的战斗特效都让游戏画面停留在了老早之前的掌机水平，毫无讨喜的点。
然而显然开发者深知如何讨阿宅欢心，对于俊男（可省略）靓女的绘制就极为上心，妹子人设个个亮眼，动态立绘（虽然可动程度极为有限）算是意外之喜，尤其是当那对NZ开始晃的时候，套路啊套路。至于游戏中的各个CG，简单形容便是福利满满但全是擦边球，虽然没有实质性福利，但仍然是人民群众喜闻乐见。
顺便在这一段吐槽下音效，音效的设置过分不上心，脚步声的数量、频率都与实际画面表现严重不符，使得代入感下降严重。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1857190166

[h1]战斗：令人头皮发麻的机制[/h1]

游戏的战斗机制算是包含了半即时、走格子的回合制RPG，其机制之丰富以然到了让人脑壳疼的程度，上手难度之高令人惊叹，加上游戏没有官中，民间汉化组并未汉化系统相关内容（3DM汉化是这样，游侠未尝试），进一步加大了上手难度。简单来说，游戏可上场四人，依次行动，角色的阵型由玩家安排，战斗中可交换，且队中有一名Leader，根据Leader不同会有不同的阵型加成效果；攻击分为上中下段共计四种，根据敌人的不同需使用不同攻击手段；队友可协同攻击（消耗SP），另外还有AP大招、OVERKILL计算、WT值等神奇难懂的机制。此外，在角色养成上，大体为装备强化和学习技能两方面，本身算是比较简单，但技能的组合和协同是需要细细研究的内容。
玩家的遇敌分三种，一种是大地图主动开战，一种是固定地点必须清怪，还有一种是大地图暗雷。这就使得游戏的战斗频次极高，尤其是大地图暗雷这种设定极为讨厌，非常拖节奏，且对于搞不清楚机制的玩家，战斗环节极为痛苦，还很墨迹，使得游戏流程相当拖沓。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1857190149

[h1]剧情：槽点太多不知道从哪里开始[/h1]

（以下来自未玩过前作的玩家，可能有失偏颇）开局男主无能狂怒对着混沌神咆哮：我们死了这么多人你为什么没给我奇迹，给我力量啊，让我老婆复活啊！神：mdzz，你要啥我给啥还叫个JB的奇迹。然后男主弑神（真实无能狂怒啊）。随后的镜头男主被妹子捡回家治疗，得知男主失忆，男主执意要冒险，妹子便跟着去了，路上遇到神使妹子，告诉男主这个世界现在这么乱就是因为你弑神了，所以你要作为神的容器，你儿子你孙子都要作为神的容器（这设定真的是闹着玩一样）。
过程中伴随着各种事件的选择，男主会和不同的妹子发生不同好感度变化，最终选择一位妹子诞下后代，跟妹子的好感度决定了后代的属性。然后便是二周目儿子剧情，三周目孙子剧情，emmmmmm，你开心就好吧……
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1857190188

[h1]总结[/h1]

福利性较为不错，妹子很养眼，战斗适合愿意细细研究的玩家，剧情看着玩就好。在现在这个优质RPG比比皆是的时代，这款略显古老的游戏似乎不是一个非常好的选择。

I tend to be very interested in immersion and working in the tutorial(s) with the story with lots of benefit of doubt to the game/characters/story/world.  I WANT to suspend my disbelief as much as I can...

The first section managed to make me feel equal measures confused and amused as a tutorial was ""incorporated into the story"" in a very heavy-handed way... it was hilarious because it was so inappropriate to have a tutorial of any kind given the story context and yet they did it anyway.

But just a bit later, this game actually managed to make me cry out in dismay and start spamming my mouse button, trying to skip a tutorial as fast as possible as it continued to information-dump page after page of more and more ""stuff you will eventually be able to do, so I'm telling you about ALL of it right now in this cutscene"".  I vaguely wondered, ""Will this information be available again later when I actually want it?  And will I have to go through this entire thing again when it comes to that?""

At any rate, in the meantime, I had been somewhat excited about the promise of exciting more combat stuff compared with the first game, but it turned out that the very interesting combo/unique character synergy elements from the previous game had been removed, and what was added seemed to amount to spamming a button?  I'm not quite sure that was all there was to it, since I didn't really get very far.
It seemed as though they MIGHT have some interesting story choices in that you were limited in the amount of stuff you could do, so you'd cut yourself off from more choices relatively quickly... but I found myself feeling as though that limit was quite artificial, and given my lack of enjoyment that was already happening, I doubted I'd make it back through the game again to see the missed options.  (Of course, that seems even more likely given that I didn't even make it through the first large story arc/generation.)

Once again, if you would like a really great example of bad tutorial choices, I do actually recommend taking a look at this game (quite seriously).

It's ruined by the same old mistakes other Japanese developers have made.

PROS:
Live2D animated character art
Technically solid. No bugs or controller issues
Good English translation
Interesting ideas (you can breed the next generation's hero)

CONS:
Ugly environments with PS1-era graphics
Most of the game is grinding your level-ups
VERY high learning curve
Boring, repetitive combat system
Painfully awkward ""flirting"" between characters
Way too long. Easily 100 hours per playthrough
Using a guide is mandatory to win

SUMMARY:
This game is a total slog. I'd only recommend it to the hardest of jrpg fans, who don't mind the mind-numbing grind with a combat system that often feels tedious, confusing, and unfair. The romance elements are clumsy, and the characters are uncomfortably childish. Non-combat systems (like crafting) are poorly explained, leaving players who don't use a guide scratching their heads and wondering what all those numbers mean. Worst of all, the game's ""true"" ending is kept secret... with no hint of how to achieve it unless you spoil the story by, again, using a guide.

TL;DR:
A boring, ugly, overly-complicated game that doesn't measure up to better franchises. It isn't sexy, it isn't cute, and you'll hate playing it unless you use a guide.",1547352128,1547352128,False,4,1,0.575414478778839111,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Neutro :[/b]
- História e não por ser ruim, é aquela história arroz com feijão bife e fritas clichê mas é gostosinha :P

[b]Cons :[/b]
- Censura , a versão do jogo da [b]STEAM[/b] é a Européia e justamente nessa versão contém censura , certos diálogos e eventos do game acabam sofrendo com isso :C
- Falta do Auto-Battle que continha nos Agarest Zero & Agarest 1
- E o maior problema do game , sistema de skills & batalha vulgo Jogabilidade ! O jogo no começo me [b]DEU[/b] uma sensação de liberdade por causa dos slots de skills, ao contrário dos outros dois jogos, não é atrelado com a arma/personagem [b]MAS[/b]...É atrelado com às especializações de cada personagem que no máximo é [b](6)![/b] 
[b]Exemplo : Aina têm 6 Water ela pode equipar qualquer skill do tipo Water até esse tier, outro personagem que têm Water 4 por exemplo não pode, tirando o building up do teu grupo! Nos outros dois jogos da franquia essa diferença só contava com o Dano que a skill em si daria se eu não me engano.[/b] 
E claro não termina aí, e agora vêm os [b]LIVROS DE SKILL[/b], ao contrário dos outros jogos que conforme você fazia missões da Guilda você ia habilitando as skills pra comprar na mesma, no Agarest 2 é conforme tu vai progredindo no game, só pro meio da [b]2º GEN[/b] tu consegue uma ""liberdade"" melhor de combar durante a batalha isso é claro [b]SE VOCÊ ESCOLHEU OS LIVROS CERTOS[/b], ao escolher um Livro que são dividos em Verde/Azul/Vermelho você não pode [b]USAR OUTRO[/b] da mesma cor & rank [b]têm certos ranks que tu pode escolher outro livro da mesma cor![/b]
[b]Exemplo : Personagem X escolheu o Livro Rank 2 Media Arts 1, ao aprender todas às skills contidas no livro o mesmo personagem não pode aprender às skills do Rank 2 Media Arts 2 porque ambas são AZUL, você vai ter que continuar jogando e quando habilitar os Livros Vermelhos do Rank 2 você vai lá e aprende às skills! [/b]
Fazendo isso, tu perde totalmente a liberdade que continha nos outros jogos, por mais que têm suas limitações, ainda era mais livre digamos assim! E claro às skills de Combinação, que nos jogos anteriores você selecionava duas skills e saia a combinação delas, no Agarest 2 eles complicaram pra caramba D: !
[b]Exemplo : Pra usar a Geo Jagger precisa de [i]9/10/11/12[/i] em Thunder, 2 personagems com 9/10 ou superior a isso já podem largar a skill MAS, se você tiver os outros 2 com [i]11/12[/i] a skill vai sair com dano máximo além de que se ela causar efeitos de status é aumentada a chance e, como chegamos nessa valor? Equipando às skills de Thunder! E aí entra a especialização de cada personagem, se um personagem têm 5 de Thunder fica mais complicado ele preencher os requisitos pra entrar no grupo para usar essa skill em específico, além disso você teria que aprender o Livro de Skill que contenha às skills de Thunder & Geo Jagger restringindo você de aprender outras skills ou seja uma coisa acaba puxando a outra :P[/b]
E por fim a Batalha em si, o que foi digitado até aqui foi somente o [b]SISTEMA[/b], agora durante a batalha o local de cada personagem é [b]FIXO[/b] perdendo o lado [b]TÁTICO[/b] do game de certa forma, só muda o lugar dependendo de quem seja Líder durante a Batalha e cada personagem ao ser Líder dá um bônus pro grupo durante essa fase! E ao por lugar [b]FIXO[/b] durante a batalha implementaram um sistema de apertar botões para soltar às skills & combinações, o jogo acabou virando uma festa de ficar apertando botão igual doido em vez de se posicionar em campo como nos outros jogos pra não tomar HK rs!
[b]Pra mim às únicas coisas que foi uma bola dentro dessa loucura foi o Ultimate Attack & Ex Finisher são às skills que só podem ser utilizada no final do Ultimate Attack  seria a combinação das skills assinaturas dos personagens, pra utilizar a Ex Finisher você consome Break Points ganha ela ao ZERAR o Break Value do inimigo nos jogos anteriores ao quebrar o Break Value a skill de combinação dava o seu dano máximo já no Agarest 2 funciona no exemplo citado acima :P[/b]

[b]Considerações Finais :[/b] O jogo em si é bom, o que pesa é o sistema de skills em si que remove e muito a liberdade do jogador de montar uma build legal para um grupo de personagens, restringindo muito o grupo que você vai levar pro end-game e a censura é chatinha também mas é relevável de certa forma! Ao entender o sistema de skills & batalha fica menos complicado [b]MAS/[b], se errar nas escolhas de livros de skills não é possível resetar tendo a chance de por causa de burrada nem usar mais o personagem :/ 

[b]Nota : 7[/b] apesar dos pesares, quando tu pega o jeito da jogabilidade a coisa engata, recomendo o Agarest 2 pra quem é fã hardcore de J-RPG, pra quem curte mais o estilo Ocidental pode acabar não gostando do game que têm seus Prós mas o sistema pesado dele pode ser muito complicado pra quem tá entrando nessa loucura de mundo agora :P !

 Герои - те же самые пустые картонные трафаретки.

Боёвка - максимум красоты, максимум....неудобной камеры, невнятной пародии на экшен, кривой системы ходов и перемещения героев. Словно, разработчик статист, на планерке, выдал - я фанат серии, я прошел все JRPG в истории, я знаю как сделать боёвку совершенной - Ему дали свободу действий, а что он сделал не проверили, и сделал он совершенное, историческое  гуано!

Для себя, хороню всю серию Агарест. Для себя, считаю её худшей серией ЖРПГ. Так просто нельзя:  серия стартует. и с первой игры, не показав ничего интересного, стагнирует, стагнирует и ещё раз стагнирует. 
Могу описать каждую часть этой серии как: Страшную жирную цыганку с отвратительным характером , которая ищет себе мужика. Каждый раз, выходя на улицу, она надевает лучшие платья, красится по новому, но это не меняет её сути .

 I love this type of game, the story-line is conventional, epic Japanese Role Player Game, save the planet by restoring Divine Power. The dialog is transliterated from spoken Japanese to English subtitle which I feel makes it artistically enjoyably. Characters are likable and cute, as per usual the protagonist has amnesia and is solemn and serious as a hero. The battle tactics seem less strategic than generations of war zero. It seems to be: break guard, attack to get ultimate and special points, overkill with special/ultimate. I'll have to see how repetitious it is throughout the game and comment, how well new skill unlocks play out, if at all. I look forward to playing this to the end, enjoying the story and dialog.

Ghostlight has this really bad habit of designing cool looking characters to draw me in, then making said characters be in a game that is just awful. 

Everything about playing this game is a chore and just not fun. You give me a cool main character that has to go on a quest with a fairly interesting plot, and just shit all over it with the most boring and tedious gameplay. Battles aren't satisfying, and are overly complicated. How do you take a simple and enjoyable formula of take turn style rpgs and just make it absolutely awful to play? Also the million little tutiorials it throws at you one after another when it comes to skills, how to learn them, how to improve them, etc. As if they expect you to remember all of it always. What if you take a break and come back? You aren't going to remember half of this shit. And it only explains it once (no idea if theres an in game menu for re reading how to do some of this overly complicated junk). There is just too much this game is trying to do at once.

As for exploration/progression, it is very easy to get lost. There are no markers on your mini map, so you have to look for them yourself, which normally isn't so bad, but they are sometimes VERY vague on where you need to go or what you need to do.

Also the free DLC makes the fights easy, which is what you want I guess since they are so boring I can't imagine sitting through them for longer than they already are. 

If only Weiss was in a cool action RPG or something. He looks the part perfect. Very cool and likeable protagonist. too bad his game is trash. It's a shame because the story seems genuinely interesting.

Of course it will be repetitive to some extent!"". But I was being too optimistic. This game is incredibly repetitive BECAUSE every single battle feels the exact same. You obviously don't but it honestly feels like you're fighting the same character(s) in the same location. Now one thing that I can say honestly is every battle plays out the exact same way. Whether I'm fighting a random encounter or a boss, I have not needed to change my strategy even once and I get the same results. None of my characters get KO'd or run out of mana or anything. What makes it even worse is that I doubt I'm fully using all of the special moves and abilities. Because all of them are nearly the same and do nearly the same thing, I never felt a need to actually try. It truly is just a VERY VERY VERY repetitive game. Repetitive like saying VERY three times.

Visual Novel aspect: The character you play as is very boring in my opinion. He has a very flat and cardboard-like personality. I think he's supposed to be a ""silent jerk"" type of character but anything he says is just so boring and uninteresting. The girls themselves are fine, just completely average girls you would find in any visual novel. But with a boring main character, you can't help but to be uninterested.

In the end, it's a boring and bland game. You can probably find better alternatives. Although it doesn't have any dating options, you should try out Disgaea. It's kind of comparable to this, but switch the ""romance"" that this game has to offer and replace it with comedy.",1489538983,1502483789,False,22,2,0.676733195781707764,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a tough RPG with many different elements from another ones of its type, and it's really tough to learn to play. And it has dating sim elements, which are the main feature of the Agarest series.

[h1] Graphics[/h1] 
The graphics are ok, the characters animations are simple, like almost 16-bit animations, but when the characters speak with each other, their animations are a lot better, with good quality anime animations featuring their facial expressions while their dialogues are shown at the lower screen. Also, the CG pictures you earn through the game are really well done, showing the girls at sexy situations (but without any full or partial nude).

[h1] Gameplay[/h1] 
The gameplay scares away some people new to the Agarest series, because the battles are really unique compared to any RPG ever created. However, this specific Agarest game is way too different from the previous editions. Your characters are positioned at the right side of the screen and the enemies at the left and the position of you and your enemies will be important to plan your attacks, because the different skills (and there's A LOT of different skills) have different area effects and dimensions. Also, the skills have different types and elements and this affects the damage you'll do and the probability to hit the target. Don't forget the status changes of the atributes, like strenght and defense, for example, and status ailments, like poison or sleep, for example.

You can use up to 4 characters to each battle and you can change one of them for another one during the battle, but if the exchanged character is down (he/she ""died""), you can't bring him/her back and need to win the fight and revive him/her at a city. Yes, you can't revive a character at the map, and this is annoying as hell.

The game has so many elements that I'll need to be concise about it. Anyway, you'll control a party of adventurers, always with a lead protagonist, which will marry one of 3 girls, generate a son and the son will be the new lead protagonist and he will have 3 new girls to marry and you got the spirit. Each lead character is one generation and this game have a total of 3 generations, so you'll generate two sons until you get to the end of the game. You can choose any girl you like, but you'll need to have high love from her so you can generate a good son and a good event (with CGs and sexy animations, of course). You build love through events at the map, where you make choices and, depending of the choices, you'll increase or decrease one or many of the affection that your team characters have towards you. And, no, the male characters has affection, but it's not love, you can't go gay here (sorry, lgbt).

How I said before, this game have so many elements, I needed to resume them. There are plenty of items, weapons, which you can unlock, craft and buy and sell. Just explore and try to get the hang of things. Once you learn the game, you'll like it better.

[h1] Audio & Soundtrack[/h1] 
One of the stronger appeals of the Agarest games are its soundtrack. All characters has different voices and all of them are in japanese (but the subs are in english). And the music is amazing, specially the battle musics. You can't go wrong here.

[h1]Storyline[/h1] 
The story is complex and you only learn the truth at the end of the game. Your lead protagonist, Weiss, is approached by a girl name Eva, which accuses him of killing a god (yes, a god can be killed here). In order to revive this god, he need to do a couple of tasks for her and the task is extended to his descendents, so his son and the son of his son will need to do the same. And she barely explain to him what's going on.

[h1]The veredict[/h1]
It's a new approach at the Agarest franchise and it's good, but really hard to master and learn. The dating sim elements don't please everyone, but are a nice touch at this franchise. I would recommend for any RPG fan which wants a game to spend hours trying to understand and master. But I advise you that it's not all of you which will like this game. This game you can only love or hate. But I hope you love it, because I love.

I must be getting old, because I can't stand the slow, drawn out dialog, after dialog, after dialog. I only made it 3 hours into this game, before becoming utterly bored. The characters feel so disconnected from the gameplay, I lost interest in the story within minutes of starting. I tried, but could not handle the disconnect. heck they even have a difficulty to make every fight ridiculously easy, so you can focus on the story only. I wish they focused on the story.

I spent 2 out of my 3 measly hours failing to skip through the dialog and completely skipping the cutscenes all together, as the narration was incredibly dry and drawn out. The last hour had little progression, as I was triggering random fights, in attempt to learn the combat mechanics. The game provided ""helpful"" character hints, which turns into several long minutes trying to provide a tutorial, that could not be skipped and unfortunately incomplete. It kinda tells you how it works. It's like reading an owner's manual, without all the details. The information is there, but not in  an easy to understand/relatable manor

I can tell a lot of thought went into the complex combat system and graphics, and the story was on an epic level, but felt more like a chore, than a thrilling adventure.

BLUF: (Bottom line up front) The first game was the hight of this series, even zero was a pale comparison to it

It is!  In its defence it would have been better if it was a spin off.  
-The continents are so strange you can't place what one is what unless you memorized the names.
-The Cast is so bad that you won't even be mad anymore that you have 2 less people in your party
-The spell lists and books seem like a cool way to specialize your party, but both the skills given and the powers you recieve are worthless once you get the power of Arc-An-Ciel (AAC)
-The main story is so pathedic that you mainly just use skip in order to get to the next crapy battle

The good parts of the game are very few
-All party members get exp now, so no longer will you have a party member under leveled at a special battle that only they are in (which is also gone)
-Battles are faster (if you didn't use auto battle for easy fights in the first two)
-You can change your party mid battle (This one was actualy amazing)

Neutral parts of the game (good/bad depending on player)
- No longer are your weapons key points of skills you can have, now it is only better stats.  making end game items no longer character specific
- Flashy combos are replaced with finnishing moves (no AP required, just tokens you get for break gage) allowing for quicker flow, and the ability to use multiple times in combat (even more then once on one foe)
- Mini game added to agument relationships (good for those that want to experience a different story options but still want to keep brides happy to pick them at end of generations)

Worst part of battles in this game, is that you had to specialize your characters so much in atks (one char had only holy atks ect) in order to take advantage of weaknesses cause of the crapy rotation skills.  But with the low skill count in thsi game for a large portion of it made it worthless once you started to get enough for specializing (See AAC)

I did drop this game due to lack of interest, and just watched a speed up 'lets play' in order to see what I missed (which was my time and money)

WORST PART OF THE GAME IS THE DEMAND FOR MINI GAMES!
and it was made for a controler or motion control.  so the port to the computer was bad for adjusting for true ends.

I believe that games like this, that abandon all the qualities that makes a game great and unique, end up killing otherwise worthly franchises.

Final review: Only get this game if you
A)Didn't enjoy the battle system of the prior ones
B)Didn't enjoy the fact that wrong decitions in the story could prevent you from choosing a bride at end of generations
C)you REALLY want to see a sequil (oh wait japan companies dont care about us, so I guess a port when/if they make one?)",1481696147,1481696147,False,1,0,0.463320463895797729,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Definitely not a game for people who just want a nice, short, and simple jrpg.

TL/NGTR: If you're a fan of the series, have a lot of time to kill, like rewarding planning, or like games with high learning curves, get this game.

Pros:
+ A lot (LOT) less grindy than the previous games.
+ Every important character has a gracious amount of screentime along with character interactions.
+ Characters that look cool usually join your party.
+ Each character has a different backstory and personality.
+ High level of customization.
+ Multiple endings. Offers replayability, which is always nice, but there is a negative side to this that'll be explained in the cons section.
+ Highly enjoyable fighting system. After you finish the first generation, you gain access to tons more flashy combos. Some people might see this as a con, but to me, it's surprisingly fun to watch sprites slowly hit enemies airborne and then proceed to smash them into the ground.
+ Tons of side quests and optional bosses to kill.
+ (For me at least) Never felt overpowered or underpowered at any point.

Cons:
- Slow start. You get the basic magic and physical attacks to start and combos are scarely executed at all throughout most of the first generation.
- Quest tracker? Yeah, this is pretty annoying. Most of the time, you're told where to go, but you have to remember where said area is. I'd suggest to download a true end guide and just marking down where you are in the story so you won't get lost. Don't neccessarily need to follow the choices for getting the true end unless that's the ending you want.
- ***Big one for me***Multiple endings... It's extremely easy to get locked in to the bad ending if you don't do specific side missions. Mildy easy to get the normal ending. Hard as hell to get the true end. You'll HAVE to follow a guide (basically) step for step which takes away your freedom with choices.
- Complex fighting system. It's really hard to learn what everything is and what does what in combat. I learned through just playing the game and eventually figured out everything though.

Overall: If you're not sure about buying Agarest 2 at this point, wait for a sale and then pick it up. Invest some time and finish out the first generation before you decide if you want to drop it or keep playing. The game really picked up for me around the end of generation 1.
I don't like the fact that the overall reviews right now are ""mixed"" because it isn't nearly as bad as other games I've seen with a ""mixed"" rating.

Написанное ниже основано на пройденном первом поколении. И играть бы дальше, но…

Можно было бы простить то, что графика стала мыльной. ГК, кат-сцены, бои - всё замыленное. Кат-сцены - это вообще тихий ужас. Всё жутко картонное. В прошлых частях тоже не сахар, конечно, но намного лучше, чем тут.

Можно было бы простить то, что выборы перестали ВООБЩЕ на что-либо влиять (не считая привязанности). Дают выбор идти или не идти куда-то? Всё равно пойдёте. Даже если выбрать не идти. Это особенно грустно выглядит после 1-й части, где от выбора иногда зависели обстоятельства встречи с персонажами.

Можно было бы простить то, что открытый мир в виде ГК сделан убого. Бегаешь по пустой карте от точки к точке. И горе тому, кто забыл/пропустил название локации, куда нужно идти - придётся рыскать по всем континентам, чтобы найти нужное место. Почему на мини-карте не отмечено куда идти? Лично я дурачок и мне нужны подсказки. Да сделали хотя бы дневник, где бы отмечалось основное задание.

Можно было бы простить то, что выпилили часть контента из игры и из ДЛС. Ладно CGшки и мини-игры с некоторыми персонажами убрали, но Эллис-то за что выкинули из ДЛС?

Можно было бы простить то, что фансервис стал преобладать в этой игре. Я посчитал - да, я ненормальный - сколько раз за всё 1-е поколении женские персонажи трясут [strike]сиськами[/strike] грудью в диалогах: 67 раз. И это ещё были посещены не все ивенты.

Можно было бы простить то, что английские субтитры корявые. Именные суффиксы попросту игнорируются, а перевод иногда втирает дичь. И это только в простых фразах, которые получилось понять на слух.

Можно было бы простить то, что сделали с прокачкой персонажей. 2 очка характеристик за уровень - это первое, что довелось мне увидеть после получения уровня у мейна. И тут подумалось, что дела совсем плохи, но дальше ждало ещё большее потрясение: сила больше не повышает точность, нет, теперь за это отвечает отдельная характеристика. Ох…

Всё вышеперечисленное можно было бы простить, но бои… Бои - никогда, ни за что и ни при каких условиях. Это то, что меня бесит больше всего. Из неплохих тактических боёв сделали какой-то чумной экшн. Свободная расстановка бойцов? Пфф, забудьте - отныне бойцы сами прыгают по заранее заготовленным позициям. Хотите двинуть бойца на пару клеток? Что за глупости, так нельзя - используйте автоматическую расстановку. Магов убивают в задних рядах? Ну да, теперь можно атаковать всех и отовсюду. Враг слишком силён? Идите качайтесь - отныне нельзя победить врага за счёт тактических манёвров. 
Всё настолько плохо с боями, что эта игра вынудила меня сделать то, чего я никогда не делал: пришлось включить ДЛС со шмотками. Ближе к концу 1-го поколения меня настолько достал кач и гринд, что ДЛС попросту сами собой включились.

It was pretty good, not great, until I got to the True Ending. It was all down hill from there. There were so many steps to get this ending that I had to follow a very specific guide. Of course, that alone doesn't bother me, but after all that, there are 8 more bosses you have to beat that are so much stronger than anything you have faced before. Suddenly, grinding for hours is a must.

Unless the battle system is amazing, I really hate grinding. Agarest War 2's battle system is certainly different, but not especially interesing and in some cases, not especially fun. On top of that, the frame rate of this game just kept getting worse and worse. Battles became painful moments I had to slog through. I still could barely scratch the first boss. 

Something tells me that beating these bosses is possible in New Game +, which is complete nonsense. This game is not good enough to warrant a second playthrough. 

I do not recommend this game unless you are really into massaging anime girls to raise their stats and get them to like you. Oh, that's a thing by the way. The three bath house minigames star you and your many hot, female party members in various states of undress. I did not find them enjoyable. They are not required, unless you want the True Ending, which I did.

Игра потеряла свою основную фишку, тк перестала быть тактической и такой хардкорной( однако на некоторые бои даже на нормале без должной раскачки ""жира"" и скиллов можно даже не соваться) как были 1 и 0 часть. И игру стали засирать. Однако вот я прошел игру 2 раза и она все равно неплоха. Если у вас не пригорает от изменения боевой системы и вы не играете только в triple A-проекты в жанре jrpg,то играть вполне приятно. 

Музончик в игре так себе. Понравилось и запомнилось только 2 композиции, и то одна только в конце тру энда. Поэтому бои приятнее проводить под свою музыку. Гайд для тру энда можно найти в стиме. Гайды с JPN/NA версией работают и на эту версию с парой уточнений авторов гайдов.

Вот несколько моментов для сравнения с предыдущими частями.

[u]Моя оценка второго агареста[/u] [b]6 с половником из 10[/b]. Было бы почти 10 из 10, но из игры напрочь выкинули ее основную фишку, полностью закопав эту некогда хардкорную тактическую jrpg серию в могилу.

Une petite liste de problèmes :

- Le système de navigation en combat à changer, il n'y a plus de déplacement case par case sur une grille au lieu de ça nous avons deux grilles ; celui de votre équipe à droite et celui des monstres à gauche (pas de navigation directe, de l'une à l'autre). Donc c'est devenu complètement statique. Pourquoi enlever une feature qui coûte pas cher et ajoute un intérêt de placement stratégique pour la remplacer par un truc nobrain et sans saveur ? De plus ça enlève beaucoup de dynamisme au combat, déjà qu'ils sont très répétitifs depuis le 1er opus, si en plus il perd en dynamisme, ça devient inintéressant.

- Ils ont aussi ajouté un système de limit point, en gros chaque action que vous aller faire va augmenter ces points. Vous devez finir la génération en cours avant que cette limite ne soit atteinte. En gros ils viennent de vomir sur la possibilité de farm, et pourquoi ? Je n'en ai aucune idée... Un tactical où tu ne peux pas farm autant que tu veux ? et pour peu que tu ai lancé le jeu en mode hard, je peux assurer que ce ne sera pas fun.

- Le controller XBOX One semble être instable, j'ai testés toutes mes manettes XBOX One. Il arrive que la navigation dans les menus ne se comporte pas de façon voulu (impossible de sauvegarde avec une manette par exemple).

- Ce qui a achevé mon désir de descendre ce jeu ? C'est le fait de pouvoir être bloqué juste parce qu'on a changé de stuff. Pour faire simple. On place des compétences dans des emplacements vides présents sur chaque pièce d'équipement, donc si vous changer de stuff vos compétences seront enlevées (logique jusque là). 
Le problème vient lorsque vous oubliez d'ajouter des compétences. Il arrive de manière plus ou moins random, que si vous cliquer sur l'action Attaquer et que le personnage n'a pas de compétence le jeu se bloque. Ce n'est pas un freeze, le jeu tourne, c'est juste que rien ne se passe. 
Comment les développeurs ont pu rater un bug bloquant aussi gros sur un truc que vous risquer de faire à chacune de vos sessions de jeu ?????

Le pire dans tout ça ? C'est qu'il n'y a rien de bien dans les nouvelles choses ! Je préfère un jeu qui peine à se renouveler mais garde la même ""âme"" plutôt qu'un jeu qui tente faussement de se renouveler en faisant tout de travers.

J'ai seulement joué 2h, donc oui j'ai peut-être raté de belles choses, mais cette première approche était tellement atroce que j'ai préféré arrêter là.",1465851675,1614109402,False,11,1,0.62654721736907959,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The only thing that I don't like with some of the JRPG games are the ""true endings"" route wherein if you make a false move, even for just one decision, you'll never be able to get a good ending. This made me become reliant on walkthroughs for the game since I always want to finish RPGs without walkthroughs in my first run.

That is the only CON that I can think of. The graphics are great and very anime styled. The characters profiles and stories are in-depth. The game mechanics are unique and very interactive since it has this combo feature. Overall, this is a good buy in the Steam store (you can always wait for a sale and its even better...

Instead of actually planning the places on where to cast the skill instead you ""plan"" during the skill menu then just spam click when you are fighting. Seriously just pick the skills that has an AOE for normal fights.

The problem is that its missing everything that made the first two games so great and it falls short of being an enjoyable experience and more tedious than anything else. Lots of times I find myself backtracking just to get the True Ending by making sure I killed a certain amount of monsters. The issue is that some areas are just so far and tedious to get to that you will run from several battles just trying to get their. Honestly the change to an open world rather than an interactive Maps ruins the game because it doesn't give it a clear objective of where to go. In previous game there was always a red dot saying event and that was great because I knew where to go and red dots means places unexplored. In this game you are told in dialogue and thats it, a lot of times they will just reference that the team should go to a new cave or mountain without much detail where the mountain or cave even is making it a goose chase. 

All in all I think I will finish the game to get my money's worth but I cannot recommned this game with confidence. If you are a big Agarest fan just go in with the mentality that this is nothing like the first 2 then that should give you an idea to not get your hopes up. If you want to get into the series play 1 or Zero because those are amazing and have an amazing story.

[h1]Full thoughts[/h1]
Ok so this is a weird one. 

The game has a fun combat system that can take a little time to get your head around. The flashy attacks, and fluid sprite animations are a joy on the eyes. Despite the fact some attacks can take a silly amount of time to complete, you may just end up never skipping them because they are so over the top, they're fantastic. Japanese anime like attacks at their finest. 

However everything else is just... meh. The characters are typical japanese anime tropes for the most part. There isn't anything wrong with this if they are done well, but I thought that only a few of them were entertaining to watch. The writing isn't too bad though and the japanese voice acting is above average. There is no english dub for the voices so if you don't care for reading subtitles this might irk you. 

The story is also sort of nonsensical. Nobody ever questions some of the stuff going on. For example you proceed through generations of characters where the child of the previous protaginist will continue on 18 or 20 years in the future (I think its around that long...). So some characters pass away yet another character who should be dead somehow manages to stay alive and, no one seems to bat an eyelid about it, despite him being human. The reason why is given later but you'll have probably worked it out yourself way before this happens. And generally the plot towards the end gets so little explanation that the objective for their quest begins to become questionable. I won't spoil anything but I've read better stories out of a childrens book. 

Also [b]FANSERVICE. FANSERVICE EVERYWHERE.[/b] Seriously there are minigames where you have to massage your female companions in order to improve affection, their stats, or technique points. And if you are going for a paticular ending this may be seen as mandatory, unless you want to spend hours grinding. The fanservice was toned down in this version though as it seems to be censored during some scenes and images/dialogue was removed or altered. 

And you will grind in this game. Not for levels however, more for the comissions and materials to make better weapons. If you do purchase the game I'll give you a hint and say that the strength of your equipment if far more important than your levels, especially when you start reinforcing them. 

So despite the fact I've put around 143 hours into the game I can't recommend it. I like it despite the negativity you might be seeing from this review but honestly you could put those hours into a game that is far better than just anm average game. Proceed with caution if you do decide to play it, and [b]PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE[/b] for your own sake! Go for the true ending path (Might need a guide for this one.)

My exposure to the Agarest series has been quite long. In fact from the very first Generations of War, up until ZERO and now this. This installment was supposed to be the defining chapter for the series and to me, it fell quite short in very many ways. For every positive outlined below, there will almost certainly be an overbearing glaring negative.

To begin with the new animated character portraits during spoken dialogue mark a fascinating turn for the series going forward. This simple addition to the [b]visuals[/b] provides some flair to the tedium of still having to read through text ""visual-novel"" style. Did I mention that despite the voice acting present, all voices are in the native Japanese? While not inherently bad as the voice actors are competent, expect a lengthy script with PLENTY of reading. As for the environments, well there's some variety and even change when it comes to battle transitions. Sadly there's still no environmental interaction to be had within battles

[b]Gameplay[/b] revolves around traversing a world map, transitioning to a battle screen, then taking part in grid-based turn-based combat featuring members of your party. In a marked departure from the earlier games, you don't position all your characters on the grid with a Move phase then Attack phase. Instead you can now determine formations prior to fights, obtain stat bonuses per formation then switch leaders around to change the formations (hence bonus) mid-fight. Since there is no separate move phase you get into formation and then press one of 4 Face buttons onscreen to perform attack types such as Launch and Stun etc. Since this system has become combo based in order to maintain high damage strings it's become a case of button-mashing with minimal strategy involved. And since the battles are RANDOM in nature......... Now, levelling up. This title has THREE separate level up variants consisting of ""Technical Points"" (for moves), ""Party Points"" (ability points shared out within the party) and ""Control Points"" (enabling you to SET moves in your character's repertoire including combinations). As you can imagine, juggling all these is complicated and tedious at best.

The [b]story[/b]...... is quite atrocious really. On top of the usual kill the demon and marry one heroine per generation (max out at 3), motives for doing what is needed are pretty much non-existent. Add to this the lack of any sort of intrigue (the light political intrigue of the earlier Agarest wasn't bad) and you end up with an unnecessarily lengthy tale whose characters fit set cliched molds.... At least the music especially in special boss dungeons is great. Don't let me even get started on how long it will take before you start fighting the heavy hitters with their loads of three-tier experience points.

So, should you buy this game? Proceed with caution if you must, but if you are prepared for a LARGE chunk of your time being eaten up by a mediocre tale, then be my guest. Get it on a sale. A significant sale..... Ahhh yes. There's plenty of DLC offering weaponry, add-on dungeons, smithing loot and experience points for the spikes in difficulty. Which brings me to another demerit. Every single piece of DLC for this game is just pricey... Why would I have to PAY for stuff that should be ingame and unlocked especially if you meet special battle conditions/story conditions?

Infact when I saw it release at about 4am on steam finally, I could not have clicked the ""Buy"" button any harder. And for sure a lot has changed in the third game. Now that I found time to actively play through it thoroughly, figured a review wouldn't hurt.

Overall, it's very fun. There are many, mostly positive changes to the series compared to the previous game, Agarest Zero.

Story: 
     If you're able to immerse into a game's plot or story, you'll enjoy Agarest 2 or any Agarest game. But whether you're a returning fan or new to the series, be warned that Agarest 2's story is far darker, cuder, and more of a ""grim reality"" compared to previous games. However, just like in-game, there's always light in the dark. You'll end up appreciating the happy moments all the more. Just don't go into it expecting child-friendly content. Just like in a good anime, there will be swearing, inneundos, and action a-plenty. Not for the easily-offended or too-uptight. 
(Personally, I loved Gen2. The character developement and characters overall were by far my favorite by the end.)

Combat & In-game features: 
      As opposed to previous entries where you would move your party around a board, then initiate attacks in turn order, Agarest 2 tried, and very well succeeds in changing the combat pace of the Agarest series. You no longer move around a board, rather you sit on ""your side"" and launchs attacks at enemies, which can move you out of formation or into enemy territory. And rather than picking a bunch of commands, you now input the attacks as they happen. While it will seem basic at first, eventually with practice you'll be chaining many different combo and group attacks in one long chain (and as a bonus, the bigger you combo chain, the more damage per-hit you deal for that chain).

     A few things were blundered with though. Firstly, navigation and finding events or even the main quest can be extremely irritating. You have no markers on the minimap, no arrow, no way to re-read the last event to see where you're meant to go, so if you stop playing the game for awhile and can't remember or did not write it down, you may spend a lot of time searching for it. And in the same suit, the game will often unlock 'optional' event fights or mini-bosses you can find around the maps when you complete Commissions, but it tends to be cryptic in that fact. I was nearly done with Gen1 before I even realized some of these events were actually spawning event-monsters.

Balance: 
      I remember one fight in Agarest Zero's 2nd Gen, that I shamefully admit was a brick wall, I could not beat it until I caved in and purchased the best weapon DLC pack they had. However, I've yet to encounter such a ""great wall of china"" difficulty spike in Agarest 2 (I tribute this partially to the new combat system, when learned it can be heavily abused in your favor). 
      The temptation of DLC will always exist, and there are times when it does seem like it'd be a good idea to spend $5~$10 on a pack, purely for the sake of breezing through. I haven't needed to do so, but if you really like the game and are having trouble or don't want to spend a fair amount of time farming/upgrading, pick up any of the packs when they go on sale, even just 1 can make all the difference. But unlike previous games, some insanely powerful gear can be obtained early on with some time investment. But whichever is your personal preference, either route is enjoyable.

Customizing & Chars:
     As usual in an Agarest game, there's a healthy and entertaining cast of chars you'll have throughout the game. And while they all come leaned towards one playstyle or another, the amount of customizing in terms of skills and stats you can do with them is rather interesting. Which is nice considering Agarest: Zero was rather restrictive in that sense. 
(I do miss the dynamic changing outfits based on their affections from Zero though).

Overall it's a great addition to the series, as well as a good game for anyone new to the series, great game series overall, you'll spend a good amount of enjoyable time in any Agarest game really. But I will re-iterate that of the series, 2 is the darker of the games (not a bad thing, if you're more of a fan of the more serious stories. If you're more into light-hearted, I recommend Agarest Zero as your starting point)",1434076576,1434076576,True,0,0,0.497962892055511475,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a difficult game to write about.  What it does, it does very well for the most part.  It's just that ""what it does"" may not appeal to a broad audience.  This Agarest game has the sort of epic, sweeping plot we expect from JRPGs, complete with deicide, ancient mysteries, untapped powers, and (of course) amnesia.  The amnesia on the part of the rather unlikable protagonist makes it easy for a player to jump in even if they have not played Agarest 1 or Zero.  The characters are much more central to the movement of the game than the epic plot tropes are.  There are many characters, each with distinct, well-written and fleshed-out personalities and motives.  Each has a role to play and the player has some minor control over the direction that role takes.

So what is the actual gameplay like?  There are two basic types of gameplay in Agarest 2: tactical battle and visual novel.  The visual novel portions, though very well-written, are long and unavoidable.  The choices you make in these sections affect the love characters feel for the protagonist- because like any good visual novel, these sections ultimately amount to a dating sim, in this case spanning three generations of characters.  The tactical battles are curious.  If you are expecting something in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics look elsewhere.  The grids on which the battles take place determine the viability of your various combos and is not a field you can manually move around.  What's more, the combos in question are executed arcade style- I found myself mashing buttons maniacally to maximize damage.

If these types of battles don't appeal to you, be wary.  Agarest is a grind, a very serious grind.   The vast majority of game time is spent fighting battles again and again and again.  I find them to be pretty fun battles, but after a while I find myself throwing on Netflix while I absently mash through battles to fulfill my goals.  The battles become more fun once you unlock all the various character customization options, but just getting there takes a good five hours of grinding.

Which brings me to the last point I want to be sure to mention.  I found the text-based in-menu tutorials on how to use the various systems so confusing that I actually understood less after reading them.  I learned how the systems worked through trial and error.  I'm not sure how much of this is due to obtuse writing and how much is due to ADD.  The menu pages are ornately decorated to the point of gaudy opulence.  These decorations add nothing to the information and for me, someone who struggles with ADD, I found them incredibly disruptive.  I know others out there have the same struggle, so prepare yourself if you do.  For those who don't struggle in this manner, enjoy the gorgeous menus.

Story

To keep it short: There is probalbly not much in here, you haven´t seen somewhere else allready. The story is nice but ovarall pretty predictable. You have to become a vessel for a new god while fighting of demons. These two things are what keeps the story going. To be absolutly honest, I found myself skipping through the story in the later parts. It just didn´t catch me. Regardless, I can see that the developers really tried and at time I liked what they presented. So I give a 6.5 for the story.

Characters

Maybe I will receive alot of hate for saying this, but the characters where the main point which almost made me drop this game. Firstly I want to make a general statement in terms to character presentation. I found it really hard to take any of them serious. Why? Because of the *breast bouncing* thing.
Conversations with the heroins normally go as follows:

""We have a very serious discussion about the future of this world"" *breast bouncing*
""Your deeds where a terrible mistake"" *breast bouncing*
""You have to make up for your errors"" *breast bouncing*
""..."" *breast bouncing*

While I do like breasts, this was totally ridiculous. I was irritated by it the whole time and can only assume the developers did this to make the heroins appear more attraktiv. Which in my oppinion absolutely failed.

As this section is allready pretty big, I will keep things a little bit shorter as I originally had planed. There where a few characters I liked but the main problem is that there where to many that ranged from ""I don´t care about you"" to ""Please shut up...seriously just shut up"". The Fiona-girl got especially on my nerves and the third generation MC made me start the whole game all over again to get a second-generation MC I could use further in battles, as I my first thought after a battle with the third gen MC was...ugh nope...
Some people mentioned that they didn´t like the sec gen MC. In my opinion he was the most human of the three MCs and the one I liked the most too. To keep things fair I also have to say that I really liked the more mature Fiona of the third gen. Nonetheless, I can only give a 5.0 for the characters in this game.

Gameplay

This is where the game really shines. I have to admit, it almost took me 20 hours of gameplay-time to understand the battle and character system. The tutorial really doesn´t help much and I really had to google many things. If you are into these kind of complex things (as I am), you are rewarded with some of the best combat and character system I have seen in a long time. The system is complex without giving the impression of anything in it to be unnecessary. You have to micro-manage many things to build a powerfull party. I really liked that. I give a 9.0 for the system while reducing a point for the fact that you have to google even the tiniest bit of information. That includes the lack of quest markers and others things that would really had made your life so much easier.

Sound/Voices

The soundtrack of agarest 2 is decent. There are some tracks, especially the battlethemes, that are really nice. The voicecast is done nicely too, but then again I have to admit that I had to turn it of because some characters drove my blood pressure into higher grounds (Oh just shut up Fiona!! I don´t care if you got a level up). I give this section a 6.0 while reducing a point for the need to turn the voices of.

Conclusion

Agarest 2 is a nice game in which you really can sink your time into. Sadly the Story and Characters aren´t as strong as the gameplay. I would still recomend this game as something you can enjoy while ignoring the story, as it offers lots of challenging fights with the possibility to customise your character alot.

If you are looking for something that has a strong story and good characters try ""G-senjou no Maou"" (Yeah, it has sex in it, but as I said, I like breasts).
If you are looking for something that is easy to get into, try Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn.",1429551869,1429556135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As the third entry (or so) in the series, the game's battle system has been much improved.

The problem that prevents me from recommending the game is the high price of the DLC and the altered/removed content.  When I play a game, I like to know that I have a chance at least to see all of the content that the game has to offer.  I probably won't have the opportunity to play through more than once, so it is important for me to feel like I am getting the full experience.   As you can find detailed elsewhere, certain content from the original game is not in this steam PC version.  

Additionally, the absurdly high price of the DLC is a problem. The DLC items help reduce the highly grindy nature of the game and make it a more bearable experience for people whose available gaming time may not be what it once was.

这个游戏已经出了几年了，现在从PSP平台移植到了PC上， 在画面上确实进行了重制，也把e-mote立绘的清晰度变高了，可以说达到了ZERO和一代的移植水准。

然而，我很难说推荐这款游戏。《因为阿加雷斯特战记》是一个非常考验耐心的游戏系列，每一做的剧本都很棒，但是节奏很慢，全要素的收集也颇费功夫。如果想要独立地完成剧情的话，你需要很注意地去看每一段对话，来发现下一步怎么走的线索，否则很可能会不知道怎么办，游戏里也没有相应的提示机制。首先要有心，其次要能够读懂对话，值得庆幸的是配音团队还是比较出色的，看剧情也可以是一种享受呀。

注意，半即时制，非战棋。这一作的系统比之前的复杂很多，主要是[b]技能系统[/b]大大地复杂化了，人物之间的搭配，团队的平衡，包括如何转换敌人位置，都需要慎重地思考，尤其是在高难度之下。结果就是，虽然半即时制大大加快了战斗节奏（相对以前），但是在配置技能的时候会花很长时间……

[b]每代都可以选一个妹子结婚，很重要，有没有Gal的感觉，对，就是这种感觉！[/b]另外，游戏中有很多可能吸引广大绅士的元素，比如Loli跳舞、给妹子做马萨基、邪恶CG等……总归继承了阿加雷系列一贯的杀必死传统。只要你觉得画风能够接受，那么就会有奇妙的动力驱使你玩下去。

官方依然没有日文字幕，具体为什么请自行理解吧。

请尽量不要看攻略，前两世代的选择支大部分只不过影响好感，可以在小游戏里刷~真结局条件也很简单，建议盲推一周目！毕竟结局有三个。

如果遭遇物品找不到、怪物找不到的问题，推荐日文wiki（虽然是psp时代的，但是适用），英文wiki的翻译和游戏中有很多差别，恕不推荐。

Of course it's not without its cons (every game has them), but something to keep in mind is that it's extremely good and easily appreciated for a 3 year old niche game.

Favourite part of the game:
• As always in the Agarest series, it has the incredible aspect of ""you will naturally end up with the one you like more if you choose options you normally would"".
--> A lot of people make a claim that this is deterred by the desire to reach the ""true ending"".  If you truly want to enjoy this game, don't look up a guide for it.  Turn it into your own experience.  The developers have also learned from the other Agarest games and added a ""normal ending"", which doesn't restrict access to things the ""true ending"" gives you.

Other stuff:
• The combat is extremely entertaining once you get the hang of it and look up a tutorial video or two online.
--> I was originally deterred by the apparent complexity and that it's unlike Agarest Zero and the first, but this was quickly overcome and this combat system is definitely more enjoyable (at least for me), because it's faster-paced without compromising strategy too much.
• The characters are absolutely lovable, and for reasons other than their 'sexiness' and which waifu you like more.
• The story always has you interested and plays out almost like a visual novel, which is fantastic since a lot of the cut-scenes can take up more than 10 minutes.

Cons:
• It's not obvious where you should go next.  Easily the biggest problem with this game, but it's not too much of a problem if you know how to navigate everywhere and don't mind being lost for a few minutes every once in a while.  The important thing is that it still says that a location has an event if it has an event.
• Strict ""true end"" path.  I repeat though, for maximum enjoyment it's best to not look up a guide and odds are you'll get the normal ending if you actively try to visit most events and finish most commissions (small objectives) anyway.",1426319563,1426389967,True,16,2,0.605473995208740234,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As a total layman of JRPG games (yes, I've never played this type of production before) I got interested in it mainly because I was able to get this production for free in addition it was in manga style, which of course as a die-hard fan of manga, tentacles and such, I had to check out.

I played the first two hours and got sucked in for another 30, which is probably the best recommendation.
Of course, if you're not a fan of this style, where drawn busts attack you every now and then and women's underwear pours out of the screen, accompanied by pink-haired, boobed elves, you might be a little irritated, but the gameplay itself offers so much that even anti-fans of manga and anime can enjoy it.
Pluses:
- Characters
- Story with intrigue
- Animations (of the boobs)
- Backpack,items etc.
- Boss fights  
- Bath time(・∀・).

""-Dyshana, a mysterious stranger who offers Leonhardt survival in exchange for the souls of him and his descendants. Suspended between life and death, Leo, having little choice, accepts the offer, then begins a lonely crusade against evil. So much for the big picture. The plot is typical of Japanese RPGs - a tad naive, clearly lined with Far Eastern occultism, and at times a little too contrived. Overall, fans of the genre may like the story.

The strongest point of Agarest: Generations of War. The salt of the game is the battles, which are played on small maps divided into square fields. The skirmishes are turn-based. Each character has a certain number of action points allowing movement and action. Attacks and spells are plentiful (more than 300), including special abilities of individual characters, as well as blows and combination spells, which require at least two heroes to perform.

The same is true of the ability to modify equipment. Here, crafting facilities come to our aid, where items of equipment can be upgraded in exchange for points earned in battles, or turned into other items using alchemy. Then there's the Adventurer's Guild, awarding titles in exchange for meeting certain conditions, and the Monster Guild, where monsters we capture can be exchanged for rewards or combined to get even more powerful creatures. Players who love optimizing their teams in terms of skills and settings on the battlefield will be in seventh heaven, as the program offers a wealth of possibilities in this aspect."" #technopolis",1425739879,1666725717,True,11,7,0.506261289119720459,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I played a good number of JRPG's in high school and college, but it's been a couple years. Take this all with a grain of salt.

Pros:
-Extensive character customization
      -From assigning points to stats, choosing what skills to train and deciding the formation of your characters. Min-maxing this is a challenge in and of itself, and will feel rewarding for those willing to dive into it.
-100's of hours of gameplay for those devoted to completing this game and getting the best ending (and for only $20 or less on sale)
-Combat is showy and has big numbers (again for those into that)
-Music is honestly great.

Cons:
-You need to know going into this game that when a character says ""hey, go here!"" you aren't going to get any more direction than that. Objectives aren't marked on the greater map, and you will actually have to go where the objective is to find it. (Once you get to the sub map it will show up as something being there.) Basically if you don't know where you are supposed to go you are going to end up searching the whole of the world for your objective.

- I honestly found many of the characters to be [b] extremely [/b] abrasive. [spoiler] Once getting to the second generation, I kid you not, the first lines of the new main character is him saying (and I paraphrase here) ""I'm only doing this because I was promised whores"". He then turns to the female lead and tells her he would really like raping her. O,o  The character treats women as property and they all seem to just go along with it and accept their fate to be sex slaves. [/spoiler]

-As far as equipping and improving your characters, there seems to be a lack of availability of improved weapons outside of the DLC that is offered. If you look at the other agarest games you can see that the dev's generally release a 20$ game and then 40$ of DLC which makes the game easy beyond belief. They give you a taste of what the DLC is like by including a small pack with the game itself. Can you beat the game without the DLC? Yes. Is it a complete grind? Pretty much.

-When it comes to endings there are two: the bad ending and the ""one true ending"". (This is apparently a commonality between this game and its predecessors. ) Know that if you want the good ending you are going to have to make all the ""right"" choices, complete all hunters’ guild quests and complete every event available. It's a lot of work, and if you miss one thing you get the bad ending. If you don't care about what kind of ending you get then this isn't a big deal, just something to know before diving in.


For people who are diehard fans of games like this, you'll enjoy it. There's a lot here to enjoy. If you are someone who like RPG's but are used to a more guided approach, this game can be very frustrating. For people who don't necessarily understand Japanese approaches to sexuality and duty, the motivation of Agarest's characters can be really confusing. If you are just looking to see anime boobs, go play another game or use google. There is some fan service, as to be expected, but it is actually a pretty small part of this game (thankfully). 


Personally, will I play this game more: Maybe? It's hard to say. This game is easy to lose time to, frustrating and ultimately decently rewarding. If you are iffy on getting this game, just wait for a steam sale, and consider picking up the DLC with it. It will make the game a lot easier and if you change your mind about using it you can toggle it off and grind the game like everyone else. 


I can confidently say I've played much better JRPG's. I'd give this game 5/10.

Definitiv das bessere Agarest, wenn man mal das Original nimmt. Sei es von der Story oder vom Gameplay her. Es ist einfach besser. Die unnötigen beiden Generationen aus dem Original wurden hier zurecht wegrationalisiert.

Was negatives geblieben ist: Ohne Guide kriegt man im Leben nicht das True Ending zu sehen. Das normale Ende.. fühlt sich einfach falsch an.
Aber eins muss man dem Spiel lassen. Entscheidet man sich nach dem Standard Ende zum New Game+ und folgt dann einem True Ending Guide, kriegt man wirklich zu 50-60% eine andere Story geboten. Und das Ende ist einfach mal 100% anders.
Hätte man auch einfach so einbauen können, ohne grinden und exakt Guides befolgen, aber die Entwickler wollten einem ja auch was bieten.

Wer auf Grindfeste, kryptische Japanostories und J-Music steht, der muss sich das umbedingt holen. 

Die Bosstracks bleiben definitiv auch nach dem durchspielen im Gedächtnis.

I wish I had waited to purchase the game rather than pick it up on sale.

Things disliked.

1. Odd purple tint to all the characters and backgrounds.  It gives the backgrounds a washed out feel and the makes the characters' skin tones take on a  ghoulish cast.  No idea what the  intent was - a faux retro feel, a throw back nod to the days of CGA monitors.  Whatever the reason,  looks awful.  As I can't think of any reason someone would do this on purpose, perhaps it is some odd graphical glitch that only shows up when running this game.

2. New combat system.   Needlessly complicated and tedious.   If you prefer turn-based, strategic combat, and are not a fan of button mashing then turn back or abandon all hope of avoiding carpal tunnel syndrome.

3.Character design.   Bland.  This may not be a fair assessment, as I didn't get far into the game due to the purple haze and button mashing combat.

4. Story.  Can only judge from the short time played, but it started out bland and generic.  Whiny guy jacking up the world over a lost lover.

I suppose he will have to make amends by getting it on with one of his three lovely travel companions.  "" Oh !  The inhumanity of it all ! """,1424488762,1424488826,False,19,6,0.30994945764541626,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game uses the same ""Universe"" but has a totally new story and battle system. 

The battle system (to me) feels something like Tales of Graces mixed with turn based combat. At first, it is confusing and I must admit it is just button mashing whichever you think does the most damage or fastest to end battles faster (down/A is the fastest btw). During the first generation of the game you will gain new combat abilities and skills which you can then use as combos so the battles should be less button mashing and more strategical (although the tutorial I admit doesn't really explain it that well). I learnt by playing it mainly and watching some vids on youtube. When you do slowly understand bits and pieces of the battle system, it gets way more fun to do combos and also you will need to use them to beat bosses in later generations (mostly if you are playing in Hard). Later generations the battles get harder but you should have at least a vague idea of doing combos and stuff by then.

The Universe/world is now somewhat open world with random battles popping up every now and then. There is still the ""move from this spot to next"" like the previous Agarest series as ""dungeons/caves etc""

The game is still has its dating sim/VN effect. There is a new ""mini game"" where you can play to get affection/stats for your waifu's but is totally optional if you don't want to play. This is just massaging waifu's which is weird-ish and hard to do but it's a good new part of the game.

Overall, with the new storyline, the game is very interesting and fun to play. There is no lag for me when I play. If you are looking for a J-SRPG that is way worth your money (easily 80+ hours to complete) I would recommend the Agarest series.

One extra thing I will add is the censorship of this game. It is missing 4 CG's one playable massage character for the first two generations (because she is considered a child) and a DLC character that you had to pay for and could ONLY use in fights(I believe? Also because she is considered a child). But if this is what it takes for this game to get onto Steam it is well worth.

The game is set in a parallel universe to the other two games but with a very similar story so you will instantly know what is going to happen. The battle system has been changed quite a bit, there is less strategy elements involved but they have focused on making it quite a bit faster by tying your characters skills to 4 keys: 

(L) for ranged attacks.
(K) for down attacks.
(J) For stun attack. 
(I) for Burst attacks.

This allows you to pull off smooth combos with the addition of allowing you to use the arrow keys to switch between characters on the fly, but unfortunately, can't move your characters around the battlefield and you can only control 4 characters now instead of 6. Despite the combat being toned down on the strategy elements, you feel more involved with the combat instead of giving instructions and watching your characters do the moves.

You can now freely move around the world map instead of following set's of lines laid out for you, which has lead to a lot less of ""You must do this battle to proceed"" stuff (even though they are still present at certain loactions) and more of you will engage in combat at random times, but they have added the ability for you to manually engage in battle by pressing the page up key.

Skills are laid out differently and are no longer tied to weapon slots, you must gain new abilities by collecting books and equiping them on a character, to which you spend TP you get them. Once a character has got the skill, it is tied to one of the 4 move sets and some have special conditions that you must meet with that character before you can equip it on said character. It also teaches you to give specific characters certain skills as they can use them more effectively then others.

The art design is very similar to Agarest Zero and follows in it's foot steps when it comes to the cutscenes but Generations 2 now includes proper animated cutscenes and even delivers in the whole opening that animes usually do.

At the end of it, I personally enjoyed my time with it. The combat for me feel's more interactive and a lot faster then it's predecessors but it is unfortunate that you can't move the characters anymore. The story is pretty much the same just told a little bit differently which I don't really mind as much, as they seem to know what they're doing and would rather stick with what they know how to do rather then mixing it up. It can be a bit daunting at first glance with the leveling up system, skills etc, but you will come to understand all of it as the tutorial explains the mechanics pretty well. All in all, I would recommend it, you will have a blast with it as it's RPG elements are quite indepth and it will provide you with hours and hours of content for it's asking price.",1424397482,1424397798,True,30,3,0.507265448570251465,4,False,False,False,False,,,

Всего за неделю до выхода, листая новостную ленту я увидел у одного из друзей предзаказанную копию новой части. До этого момента я даже понятия не имел что они планируют её выпустить - и как в случае с ""Agarest/Zero"" я незамедлительно её приобрёл.

Я не особый фанат этой серии, но tRPG вроде ""Disgaea"" или сеговской ""Shining Force"" мне очень доставляют. И каково же было моё удивление, когда ожидая увидеть очередную тактическую стратежку (с прикрученным симулятором Альфача-пикапера) - я увидел боёвку из ""Ar Tonelico 2"" (с прикрученным симулятором Альфача-пикапера). Боевка теперь не напоминает шахматы - тут теперь что-то уровня Xenogears: персонажи во время боя стоят в одном углу экрана, враги в другом. Когда одни атакуют других - то потом возвращаются в свой угол на свое место. Бой как в финалке разделен по ходам и вариантам действий - но главное отличие в том, что персонажи при атаке могут использовать несколько вариантов ударов - причем использовать их будете ВЫ и с помощью разных кнопок. Эдакий пошаговый файтинг, который отдалённо похож на боёвку из финалки. До шедевральной боёвки из Ксеногирса ей конечно далеко, а вот к боёвке сиквела Ар Тонелики прям рукой подать. Так что она теперь совсем не утомляет - бои стали в 10 раз короче и быстрее, динамичнее и веселее!.. Но так же они стали как в финалке абсолютно случайными - бегаете вы по локациям - и хоп! Бой! Для любителей фарминга завезли даже ""быстрый бой"" на отдельную клавишу! Беганье по карте и хороводы по 2-3 минуты остались в прошлом! ЭТОЖ НЕКСТДЖЕН!!!11

По мировой карте теперь дают свободно побегать. Нехватает там только оста ""Emotions"" из Ксеногирса чтоб прям вообще 10 из 10 было. Саундтрек тут стал в разы депрессивней, что добавляет эпичности и брутальности происходящему. Особенно понравился трек который играет в диалогах между персонажами. В команде теперь кстати всего 4 человека, формация и расположение их на поле боя теперь не играют такого огромного значения как это было в первом Агаресте или шедевральном зеро. В остальном механика осталась такая же точно: идем куда говорят, тыкаем на карте в точки эвентов и смотрим сюжетные вставки. Иногда неумело пикапим тянок или поддакиваем им во время диалога чтобы у тех повышалась шкала вашего авторитета.

Ну а теперь о сюжете. Он... есть. Он вроде бы эпичен, главный герой вместе с каким-то ботаном прибывают в какие-то руины за загадочным артефактом. Им оказывается крутой двуручный меч - но когда он его забирает - он ломает печать и высвобождает двух богов. Те начинают выпендриваться - гг этим самым мечем берёт и выносит их как простых мобов, за что тут же получает ярлык ""Убийцы богов"". А потом ВНЕЗАПНО он валяется в каком-то лесу с полностью отшибленной памятью без каких-либо зацепок. Вроде бы неплохая завязка и даже интригует - а вот отношения между персонажами очень клешированны и бросаются в глаза. ГГ мегасерьезен и пафосен, хоть ему и отбило память. Его подбирает няша-стесняша лекарь после чего: ""ОЙ ТЫ ПОТЕРЯЛ ПАМЯТЬ! МНЕ НЕЧЕГО ДЕЛАТЬ И Я ПОЙДУ ТЕБЯ СОПРОВОЖДАТЬ!"" *ПАМ-ПАМ!* ""Я другая убер-сексуальная магичка! ПЭМ! Я тебя помню - а ты меня нет! ПЭМ-ПЭМ! Я иду с тобой!"" *ТУСА-ТУСА-ТУСА!* ""О! Чуваки куда идёте? Вы сами не знаете? Круто же! Я неумелый пикапер-стрелок и я короче с вами! Я вас только что увидел - но я УЖЕ полноценный член команды! Пошлите короче монстра в лесу грохнем!"" 
И это собственно не шутка - за 25 минут я уже собрал команду для спасения мира, в которой все готовы друг за друга порвать. Вообще, в Агаресте сюжет никогда небыл сильной стороной игры - тут скорее основной упор делается на фишку ""смены поколений"" и ПИКАПЕ МЕСТНЫХ БОГИНЬ для этой самой смены поколений. Чтож, прошли времена Ксеногирса, Хроно Кроса, Дизгеи и Фентази Старов - ПРИШЛО ВРЕМЯ 10 ИЗ 10 НЕКСТДЖЕНОВ!!!! ГОСПОДИ 10 ИЗ 10 ГОСПОДИ!!!!!111

Если вы фанат серии, вас отпугнет новая боёвка и странное перемещение по 3D карте. Если же вам всеравно на НЕКСТДЖЕН-нововедения и вы хотите поугорать над сюжетом, вспомнить старые деньки проведенные за предыдущими частями и послушать знакомые системные звуки - то наверное проще заново установить одну из старых частей.

For people new to the series, it has rather heavy focus on storyline and character events so you can expect to go through a lot of dialogue. On the other side you also get increasingly challenging fights and multitude of 
ways to strengthen your party members as the game goes on.

From the previous games it retains the datingsim/marriage system where the player ends up controlling and developing not just the main character, but later his son and even grandson.
As a welcome change though this game has revamped game mechanics, which make the turn based combat a lot more fast-paced and fluid.
This time the active party size is limited to 4 people and there's no need to move characters on the battlefield as they will be in a formation set by the leader.


Pros:
-Ridiculous story!?
-Unique main characters
-Fast-paced fights
-Overkilling bosses
-Dozen of different ways to power up your characters
-Soundtrack
-Dungeon maps
-Character designs

Cons:
-Worldmap with random battles
-Budget assets
-Mid game puts the main story in the backburner
-Combat gets spammy towards the end..
-Over the top fanservice and minigames


Recommended for anyone who likes rpg games and don't mind going through lots of dialogue.
If you tried the previous games but found their game mechanics too cumbersome, then Agarest: Generations of War 2 has that fixed for you.",1424372183,1424372183,True,117,8,0.781843602657318115,8,False,False,False,False,,,

If you enjoyed gameplay in titles such as Xenogears this game is for you. The story leaves some to be desired but the addicting gameplay in terms of control layout makes for a type of JRPG that hasn't been seen in a while. Turn based with button designated moves like Y for upwards attacks, A for downwards, X for Paralyze and B for ranged it keeps the turned based mechanic feeling fluent and fun through a somewhat recognizable outing. I give it a 8.5 based on the re-introduction of what made old-school niche RPG's fun and the fearless attempt at completely changing a gameplay layout from its prior successor. Although a lot different from Agarest 1 and Zero in terms of gameplay it makes for my personal most enjoyable entry into the series and could see this adaptation of mechanics extending its lifespan of the Record of Agarest War series to become one of the most favored in the genre in a long time in the niche market to come, Also Runs in 1080p/60fps.
