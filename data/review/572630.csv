Positives: 
schon jetzt nach rund 2h kann ich sagen das es sich lohnt 
einfaches Handling 
gutes überschaubares Menü 
guter Sound keine Verzögerungen bemerkt 
keine Bugs bemerkt 
es macht auf jeden fall Spaß  

Negatives:
derzeit nicht so viele Effekte auch die Sound Auswahl ist überschaubar 
Tutorial ist derzeit wohl mehr Platzhalter als wirklich Tutorial ich hab noch nie so wenig aus einem Tutorial lernen können 
Import von eigenen Sound geht nicht innerhalb von LyraVR ( Seperat die WAV. Datein in den StreamingAssets/LyraFilesToCopyToUserDocuments kopieren 

(natürlich nicht zu vergleichen mit bekannten Programmen wie Fruity Loop Qbase oder ähnlichem )

was ich mir wünschen würde :

direckteres steuern der Grundfunktionen wie Lautstärke Balance usw (wegen mir ein seperates fester )
mehr Effekte u Sounds
bessere tutorials
Import und Sortierungsmöglichkeit innerhalb von LyraVR von Sounds (alle im selben Ordner ist irgendwann unübersichtlich bei mir zbsp 36gb wav Sounds  )

Very nice sound software
positive:
After about 2 hours I can say that it's worth it
Easy to use
good manageable menu
Good sound, no delays
No bugs noticed
It's definitely fun

Negative:
currently not so many effects and the sound selection is manageable
Tutorial is currently probably more wildcard than really tutorial I have never been able to learn so little from a tutorial
Importing your own sound is not possible in LyraVR (separate the WAV files in the StreamingAssets/LyraFilesToCopyToUserDocuments 
(Of course, not comparable to known programs like Fruity Loop Qbase or similar)

what I would wish for:

more direct control of the basic functions like volume balance etc. (because of me a separate solid)
more effects and sounds
better tutorials
Importing and sorting sounds in LyraVR (all in the same folder are sometimes confusing to me, eg 36 GB WAV sounds)

[b][u] Positives [/u][/b]
+ easy to create music right away
+ mostly nice sounds
+ lots of options, especially for this price point
+ ability to save,  import sounds
+ some nice instrument sounds and drums

[b][u] Negatives [/u][/b]
- you're limited to single notes or dyads (two-note chords)
- clunky controls when trying to create anything but the simplest compositions, especially on Touch controllers
- tutorial not really helpful
- needs more instruments

I think for $14.99 you'd be hard pressed to get a better music making app.  I'm just not sure if it's really easier to create something professional sounding with this app versus a real dedicated 2D app ...  At least not yet, but I hope it gets there.  But it is easy and fun to experiment within this app.

You can create music in several ways.  One is in the from a building a connected graph of notes which can be triggered as a sequence or a sequence triggered by a loop.  each node in the graph pcan be played individually as well.  You can edit Pitch and Volume.   

It is priced fairly and seems likely to improve.

To the developer:   Features I would love.

1.  The ability to set up a default pallet for pitch colors ( I use modified scribian color scheme to sight read by color)
    a.  this would allow me to arrange a graph in circle of fifths pattern
2.  The ability to set up a default pallet of mesh nodes shapes to show - position in scale. 

3.  ability to control triggers and possibly input using midi controllers.

If you've ever played Electroplankton for NDS it has a similar vibe. However, unlike Electroplankton, beneath the surface there's a depth to Lyra's capabilities that excites me.

I'm very excited to see where the devs take this. 

Currently there's a few CONS that stuck out immedietly:

- Clunky Controls
- Tutorial barely covers whats possible - It took some fumbling around to figure out that it has some powerful tools
- Can't explore from in game my own sound libraries? (or couldn't figure out how)

However the PROS outweight cons:

- Polished and pretty
- Little/no latency when triggering audio/samples
- Visuals are crisp and clear (1080Ti, no supersampling)
- As is powerful enough to make interesting and enjoyable music.
- Fun
