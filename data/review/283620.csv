The C stock and the Circle Line are both beautifully recreated, this sim is a classic case of quality over quantity. The programmable announcements add to the immersion, and the signals and speed boards are all correctly placed, which means HUD-less driving is very doable, and is extremely enjoyable. The passenger AI is the best I have seen in a train sim, they are not static and will board, ride and depart the train without ever despawning or teleporting. They will also react to announcements, when you announce your departure, those still on the platform will run to the train before the doors close.

The game takes place at an interesting time on the London Underground, this game came out in 2011 (Steam says 2014 but that is when Aerosoft re-published it, not when it originally released) and at the time the Circle Line was still using the C stock and the District Line was still using the D stock (which feature in game as AI traffic), Hammersmith was being extended in anticipation of the S stock and the construction works are visible, and Blackfriers was closed for renovation (you actually have to remember to announce it's closed on the DVA every time you drive past). It's a fun snapshot, and feels a bit like a time machine, reminds me of the last time I was in London back in 2012, I spent that day riding the tube, haven't been back since then, but this game feels exactly like I remember it!

The scoring in the timetable mode can seem a bit strict, but I have managed to get 95% during a run, with the only deduction being for not keeping to the departure schedule. For those struggling with the game penalising them for ""incorrect announcements"" and/or ""destination board set incorrectly"" you only use the programmable announcements for the full Inner or Outer loop, if you are doing a shorter point to point run, you only use the manual announcements. There are a lot of destination boards to choose from, but only ""Circle Line via Aldgate"" is the correct one, you must have it set at both the front and back, and with the back light on. The other destination boards are just for immersions sake I guess, although you can still use them, but the game will deduct 5% of your score if you use a different one.",1667362811,1667362811,True,2,0,0.53125,0,True,False,False,True,,,

After patching I had no problems whatsoever.

The game is amazing. The graphics must have been great back in 2014 and it still is great today. We have the full Circle line with Hammersmith branch. There is a whole day timetable we can use. We will meet a lot of other trains and they will often held us on red light for a moment. The feel of the underground is amazing.

Every stations is modelled to real life and they look good. Judging by some modern products (Metropolitan and District lines for TS) the parts between stations are probably not looking as in real life but tha't not really a problem.

We have spoken announcements, we have passengers entering and exiting the train so we need to be careful when closing the doors. It's just amazing how well it works. The physics seems ok although the train brakes pretty good.

There are some functioning switches in the cab as for the cab and passenger lights, heating, ventilation. We need to setup both cabs before we go as we need to put on the tail lights in the second cab. At the end of the ride there is a summary.

Highly recommended. This game really gives us a feel of the underground and high traffic in the rush hours. I think this is the best of WOS series even better than WOS4 which is pretty good itself.",1644692790,1644694615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Die Geschichte der Circle Line reicht weit zurück. Der Beschluss zur Ringstrecke stammt aus dem Jahre 1863, just in dem Jahre wurde die erste U-Bahn Strecke der Welt zwischen Paddington und Farringdon eröffnet, die auch Teil der Circle Line wurde. Es dauerte allerdings noch einige Jahre, nämlich bis 1884, bis der Ring wirklich geschlossen werden konnte. 

Die heutige Circle Line, die im Lauf der Zeit noch erweitert wurde, umfaßt 35 Stationen auf einer Streckenlänge von 27 Kilometern. Der Simulator stellt diesen heutigen Zustand der Circle Line nach. 

Und das macht er gar nicht mal schlecht. Man findet einen Simulator, dessen Umfang zwar überschaubar, dessen Atmosphäre und Fahrgefühl aber überzeugend ist. Denn wenn die Serie ""World of Subways"" eines kann, dann ist es, eine Stimmung zu treffen. Das liegt unter anderem an der richtig guten Ausleuchtung, an den scheppernden Sounds und an dem sich ständig ruckelnd bewegenden Rollmaterial. 

Wir müssen unsere U-Bahn erstmal aufrüsten. Dafür müssen wir in einer First-Person-Ansicht zum Zugende laufen und da das Zugschlussignal anschalten. Dann geht es nach vorne, wo wir den Motor starten müssen, das Zugspitzensignal anschalten, Licht im Führerstand und Fahrgastraum anschalten, die Heizung anmachen und natürlich den vorgeschriebenen Bremsentest (im Stand) durchführen. Dann noch das Ansagensystem programmieren und den Zug schildern und schon kann die Fahrt losgehen. Das ist insgesamt komplexer und realistischer als so manches Add-On im Train Simulator. Auch an den Stationen sollten wir die richtigen Durchsagen wählen und natürlich vor dem Türenschließen einen Betriebsblick machen. Kurz gesagt: wenn man will, kann man den Simulator sehr realistisch spielen. Es gibt allerdings auch keine Strafen, wenn wir etwa Betriebsblick und Durchsagen nicht bedienen. Allerdings merkt man auch am Fahrplan, daß man durchaus alle Aktionen machen sollte, denn ansonsten ist man immer wieder viel zu früh an der nächsten Haltestelle. 

In den engen Gängen der U-Bahn, denen man das Alter durchaus anmerkt, tuckern wir meist relativ gemächlich durch die Gegend. An einigen Stellen sind zwar 40 mp/h erlaubt, oft herrschen aber auch Geschwindigkeitsbeschränkungen von 25  oder 30 mph. Mehr würde man aber oft auch gar nicht fahren wollen.

Die Fahrbarkeit ist gut und realistisch. Die U-Bahn hat mehrere Beschleunigungs- und Bremsstufen. Damit kann man durchaus sanft durch die Röhren gleiten, man kann aber auch realistisch ruppig die Fahrgäste ärgern. 

Die Grafik ist uneinheitlich. Einiges, insbesondere die Ausleuchtung unter Tage, ist richtig gut gelungen. Auch die Röhren an sich sind überraschend detailreich gestaltet. Daß die dargestellten Personen in ihren Animationen nicht wirklich überzeugen können, läßt sich bei einem Simulator verschmerzen, denn das ist bei den meisten Vertretern des Genres der Fall. Auf einigen Streckenabschnitten fahren wir auch an der Oberfläche und da bemerkt man doch die Schwächen der Engine. Insbesondere in der Weitsicht ist der Titel schwach. Große Gebäude bauen sich sichtbar auf. Insgesamt ist das optische Erscheinungsbild aber für einen Simulator von 2014 in Ordnung.

Überraschend gut sind die Soundeffekte, die realistisch und satt klingen. Insbeondere das Rattern und Quietschen kann überzeugen. Auch die Ansagen wirken authentisch.

Der Simulator hat auch einige andere kleine Schwächen. So läßt sich unser Fahrer in der First-Person Ansicht nur widerwillig steuern. Da man aber meist im Führerstand sitzt, kommt das nur wenig zum Tragen. Auch das Umschalten zwischen den einzelnen Bedienfeldern im Führerstand ist etwas umständlich geraten. Schade auch, daß man die Fahransicht nicht im Zoom ändern kann. Für Leute mit Wide-Screen Monitor ergibt sich dadurch das Problem, daß man kaum das Bedienfeld noch sehen kann, wenn man im Fahrstand gerade nach vorne schaut.

Viele Kleinigkeiten, die allerdings nicht schwer ins Gewicht fallen, denn der Titel kann insgesamt überzeugen. Auch wenn der Umfang überschaubar ist, ist der dritte Teil der ""World of Subways"" doch ein solider und gelungener Simulator.

You've one training lesson, and then you're on your own - everything from turning on the train, programming announcements, and turning on ventilation for passengers, to judging for yourself where to stop, looking out for red lights and speed limits. There's absolutely no hand-holding, and if you pass a red or go too fast, that's it - no try again from the last station - you have to start from the beginning again.

The recreation of the Circle Line seems perfect - I'm not a tube driver so can't comment from that perspective, but can find my way around the stations from real life memory, so it's done with care and attention on that front for sure.

The only criticism I can make, and bearing in mind this is a decade after release, is that there is no option to map controls. Being able to operate the direction selector or brake handle with an axis would improve things massively, but that isn't possible here. 

Despite that, this does a much better job of immersing the player in driving an LU train than more reecent releases. The physics aren't perfect, and the program has a tendency to crash on occasion, but beyond that it's a solid sim, worth picking up on sale (which it almost always is).",1606443810,1606443810,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It also would've been nice if they included perhaps the H&C and/or District lines too, just so there's something else to do.
It penalises me for not setting announcements up correctly (despite doing so) and not putting the heating on (even when it was), which is slightly annoying but I just ignore it - I don't care for scoring systems in simulators anyway.
Also, in the adverts for holidays (and possibly other stuff) at stations, you put the £ sign BEFORE the price, not after (so £350, not 350£) ;) - very nit-picky I know but just something I picked up.

Aún así lo recomiendo pero cómpralo por menos de 5 sino creo yo que te arrepentirás. 
Mis razones:

LO MALO:
- Es un juego de TML-Studios (Aerosoft)(y del 2014!) => Eso implica un nefasto y pobre tutorial. Un desprecio absoluto por el modo en que el usuario tiene que interactuar con todo y pocas opciones jugables.

- Es un juego del 2014. Su apartado gráfico como es lógico deja que desear. Tiene de vez en cuando algún lag (juego con SSD y 16Gb de RAM). La iluminación es antigua y brusca con algún bug. La distancia de visión dentro de los túneles hace que veas a veces como luz al final del túnel (distancia de visión) cuando no tenía que haberla). Etc. etc.

- El control del personaje fuera del tren es prehistórico e injusto para un gamer con un poco de dignidad.

LO BUENO: 
- Es un juego de TML-Studios (Aerosoft) => Eso implica que a nivel de simulación el juego cumple y muy bien. Es ahí donde esta gente sabe hacer las cosas. No esperes en este juego una profundidad abismal por que todo es bastante simple pero bien hecho. Sobre todo destaco el sonido: todo! el chirriar de las ruedas, la gente en el metro, el movimiento del tren, cómo responde al frenar o acelerar, la puertas al abrirse, etc. 

- La ambientación de las estaciones, el interior de la cabina donde conducimos y el interior de los túneles. Todo muy logrado.

- Tiene muchos tramos exteriores (Circle Line del  London Underground real) por lo que no estarás todo el rato dentro de un monótono túnel.

En serio, me gustaría un remaster o actualización de este juego.
Lo recomiendo, eso sí ni loco pagues el precio normal. No lo vale.

I will list the PROS, the NEUTRAL and the CONS, based on my experience with the game.

For the PROS, I enlist the following:
- Graphics - for a 2014 game, the graphics are pretty well designed. With a good computer, the whole experience is enhanced because of it;
- Simulation - the fact that you're given pre-service tasks, like turn on your train from cold/dark, up until the strict and challenging timetable, gets you fully immersed on it;
- Environment - the environment on all stations, even though it sounds on a loop, is what you'd expect from a LU's station. With all those ""Mind the gap, please"" warnings and overall sounds, once again, gets you immersed on the game.

For NEUTRAL factors, I state that the physics are generally good (you have a pretty good inertia simulation - whenever you accelerate or brake the train, depending on how soft or hard you do both), but when you get to some kind of descent or climbing, you don't gain or lose speed, respectively. This is somewhat crucial for a simulation game.

For the CONS, here's the following:
- Bugs - there are some massive bugs on this (dated?) game. Sometimes, when I'm on FPV (first-person view), I get stuck while walking - this is only solvable if I walk in TPV (third-person view);
- DVA/Destination board bug - even if you set those two things up correctly, at the end of the journey you'll get the opposite, on the trip's briefing;
- Random crashes - sometimes, the game gets really laggish and, out of a sudden, it crashes. It happened to me twice.

The fact that all these problems happen is a huge bummer for me, since I was looking forward to play this game for years.
I even tried to run the Windows 10 compatibility tool and checked if all my stuff (GPU, system and other drives) were updated (they are).

Unfortunately, at least for me, the cons overcome the pros, making me wishing for an optimization patch from TML/Aerosoft.",1585423629,1653589152,False,25,2,0.70810931921005249,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Then perhaps with a deadline looming, they've thrown together the actual game over the top.

But actually the problem is the tutorial more than the simulator itself. And once you see the excellent youtube videos of how to play the game, you can just ignore the fussy tutorial, and jump straight in.

A lot is wrong, spelling mistakes and poor mistranslated English are everywhere. Change the key bindings, and the prompts that tell you what to do remain with the original and now wrong keys.  Controls are poor, and inconsistent. I've still to work out how I can look around the right hand door at a station without physically going outside. The walking speed is about three times too slow. Why can't I move left and right when I run?  Why is the physics of this game so intolerably awful, walking through walls, or through closed train doors? 

I've edited my original review and changed to recommend, as there is some fun to be had. But there could have been a real game here: why not count passenger numbers, give a score on how near the schedule you are, these kind of thing would be trivial to add and would give something to aim for.",1585404295,1585547255,True,5,0,0.542797505855560303,0,True,False,False,False,,,

В начале 2000-ых выход 1-ой части World of Subways натурально встряхнул рынок железнодорожных симуляторов и заставил всех без исключения ""корифеев жанра"" срочно подтягиваться до того же уровня. Судите сами - впервые в жанре:
- симуляция раскачивания камеры на ходу и при ходьбе
- возможность перемещаться на ногах и играть за аватар с видом из глаз.
- динамическое освещение и вменяемые тени
- дождевые капли на стеклах
- эффекты постобработки картинки, HDR и размытие.

Отрадно видеть, что с тех пор не сделано ровным счетом ничего для повышения стабильности работы движка, особенно на 64-битных системах. Игра по прежнему постоянно вылетает, причем в полноэкранном режиме не даст даже выгрузить себя из памяти без перезагрузки системы. Творение TML Studios так и не доросло до полноценного симулятора, а с выходом Train Simulator World можете и подавно смело отложить WoS на полку - благо, обе одноразовые, редактора не дождетесь и от Dovetail Games, метро они - рано или поздно - либо сделают сами, либо купят у наиболее пряморуких сторонних разработчиков. Но Train Simulator World хотя бы написан на современном Unreal Engine 4 и не доставит вам проблем с совместимостью.

Резюме:
Учитывая пластмассовую физику поездов, устаревшую графику и крайне нестабильный самописный движок, не связывайтесь, благо все практически то же самое можно делать в Train Simulator World.",1575149029,1575149029,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

2. zu viele Spielabstürze (fünf in ca. 120 Minuten)

First attempt at ""Briefing"" (the tutorial) had me following ""Danny""`s instructions, all well and good until I had to exit the rear cabin, (after turning on the brake lights...), ....and follow `Danny`....

""Danny"" immediately walked straight up to the young female (pictured) 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1868110160

and started dry-humping her back repeatedly.. and despite me trying my best, this is where he remained...

(There may have been a little drool running out of his mouth and a lot of heavy breathing, but I suppose that could just have been my imagination...).

So I pressed escape to try again, and the game crashed.

The next attempt had Danny doing exactly the same to a MALE passenger, (takes all sorts I guess), I might have excused this but the gent concerned was the single solitary passenger standing ANYWHERE on the platform.

""Danny"" was clearly a pervert.

Attempt no 3 had me racing through the rear cab procedure in order to get old perv-boy up front and into the drivers cab before anybody else with 2 legs and a pulse sent him into another dry humping frenzy.  I managed to achieve this and quickly shut the door... I was shown the controls and attempted to leave the station slowly...

At which point the controls ceased responding & my subway train flew through a red light like a bat out of hell. This triggered a stern message and a single control ""End Game""

I obeyed the message but pressing the button induced its second game crash, I briefly saw a windows error message & then the screen flickered, the game reset itself, and it loaded itself up again.

At this point I gave up.

As enjoyable as this somewhat janky simulator is, it falls short due to much technical incompetence. The game runs very poorly when graphics options are enabled, but nicely when they are disabled, so it seems the mirrors and shadows options are not optimized (I'm talking about an 90 FPS difference between on and off here...) 

Then there's the crashing. I had it crash on me a total of four times in an hour. Most of these were when I would return to the main menu and attempt to edit Graphics options, which would result in either a runtime error (which requires task manager to kill) or a CTD crash.  There were also instances in which the game hitched and froze for a few seconds. Mind you that this PC can run games like BeamNG drive and Grand Theft Auto V at over 100 FPS, but it can't keep this game above 50 with options enabled. This game is quite old now and the game hasn't been updated in ages, so don't expect these issues to ever get resolved.

The game has many strong points, though. Sound design is one of them. I've never been on a London Underground train since I'm a dumb American, but I can tell the sound effects were thought through and elegantly designed. The game doesn't look awful, but when you turn down the settings it most certainly does, with noticeable pop-in and some bad texture work on character models. 

But despite all this, the game still gets a thumbs up from me [b]at its reduced sale price[/b] because it's leagues ahead of Train Simulator. In Train Simulator you can sit for over a half an hour bored out of your mind between stations or speed limit changes, but as you would expect from a subway line, stations are frequent which keeps you engaged and attentive, listening to the heartfelt clatters of the train cars and praying you won't go past a red signal.

FINAL SCORE: 6/10
IN A NUTSHELL: FUN, BUT EXPECT THE GAME TO CRASH MORE THAN THE TRAINS THEMSELVES DO.

I run this of a I9-9900k with 16GB DDR4 3200mhz RAM paired with a GTX 1080ti and i like some other people cannot finish certain parts of the game, due to crashes.

For example when playing the ""Briefing"" mission, sometimes it will crash unexpectadely.

Also, if i choose to play a scheduled route instead, say, the first route: Edgware Road to Hammersmith, it will crash between Farringdon & Barbican. This is regular.

Otherwise I really enjoy the sim, at least in part due to the fact I have always had a fascination with the tube network since it was built in the 19th century. The sounds and lighting in this game really capture the true feel of travelling on the tube. When going over rail track changes for example, there is a noticeable cabin vibration, accompanied by realistic sounds of this happening (that typical clunk of metal sound). Having used the tube for 10 or so years of my life, this was as realistic as I could get in a sim, that wasnt sitting in it myself. Also, if you have ever visited the National Transport Museum in London, you will note how similar this is to the simulator they have there inside an actual stock car cutout. So many memories of playing that on our visits as a child! Not sure if it is still there today, but for those of us who were children in the 90's i'm sure you can remember it, if you did visit!

To the devs, please fix the crashes, i would be happy to provide any debug info if needed to help myself and others.

[i] It's not that bad. [/i]

Pretty much 70% of these reviews are positive, 15% are complaining about how it's 'too difficult', 10% on poor performance / crashes, and the odd 5% with tiny issues that apparently affect the entire game.
The game isn't hard and it's easy to get started with it (the main controls that is, not the DVA and stuff). Performance is fine and I've never had a crash.


[h1] Pros [/h1]
+ Detailed track and trains
+ Graphics are pretty good, certainly when it's raining and you see the fog clearing out when you turn on the AC
+ Pretty realistic, in regards to braking distance
+ Great sounds, makes it feel like you're actually in a Tube train
+ Easy (for me at least)
+ Native RailDriver support
+ Comprehensive manual


[h1] Cons [/h1]
- Repetitive and may get boring quickly
- Lags when it rains
- Some weird distance and lighting glitches
- It's difficult to know which setting the TBC is on if you're not paying close attention, which is the only issue in regards to controls
- Small but irritating: the whistle audio doesn't end smoothly
- I know why it's a thing, but passing signals at danger game endings are a bit annoying
- [b] BIGGEST ISSUE OF ALL [/b] (in my opinion): in all of my routes I just can't get the hang of the DVA and the Automatic Announcements. Kind of the same with the destination board. However, I am getting better at it, so just practice and it (sometimes) works


[u] In conclusion, [/u] if you're looking for a semi-realistic and somewhat repetitive driving experience and if you have any knowledge of common sense, then this is the game for you.

Pour être allé à Londres récemment, les stations de la Circle sont très bien réalisés ( le matériel sur la Circle à changé entre temps )
Niveau prise en main, celle-ci est assez facile grâce au petit tutoriel au début du jeu.
Le fait de pouvoir contrôler son personnage est un bon point on configure notre rame tout de A à Z, les vues sont assez limités en revanche.
Un conseil pour ceux qui ont ou qui vont avoir le jeu : Pensez à activer l'alimentation du tunnel qui est parfois pas activé, cela s'active par un boitier avec un logo eclair en bout de quai. Pensez en revenant dans la cabine de confirmer le Dead Man.
Un autre bon point : le Français est disponible dans le jeu sauf que les accents n'apparaissent pas, a vous d'en déduire certains mots.

Un mauvais point : beaucoup de ""glitches"", en effet il y a pas mal de problème de collision ( parfois il y en a pas là ou il doit en avoir comme sur les rails et aussi parfois la ou il doit pas en avoir comme sur les quais, on est obligé de passer par la rame parfois. )
C'est dommage que les heures de pointe avec les quais ""bondés"" n'ont pas été pris en compte dans ce jeu qui aurait apporté plus de réalisme.


[b] Conclusion : [/b] Un avis mitigé sur ce jeu, graphiquement ce jeu est bien fait et est très réaliste ( surtout le fait d'être dans la peau d'un conducteur et de tout ""configuerer"" ) mais les bugs peuvent ruiner l'immersion de jeu.
Pour ne pas ruiner l'immersion de ce jeu essayez :
- De ne pas sauter sur les voies
- De ne pas sauter sur les voies depuis votre train
- De ne pas vous promener sur les murs des quais de train, certains n'ont pas de collision.
- De ne pas sortir du métro par les portes qui sont fermées quand vous êtes un passager car les vitres des portes ont pas de collision.
- De ne pas griller un feu ou de dépasser les limitations. Ces derniers font fermer le jeu.
Si vous respectez ces derniers, votre immersion dans le jeu sera totale !

As a simulator it does a few things well but unfortunately the experience is tainted by bugs and a bad UI.
Here are some gripes I have with it:

1. The game allows you to walk around the platforms and within the trains. However this is horribly implemented with (""Tank-like"") controls that wont allow you to even walk backwards. When boarding a train I get contantly stuck on things which makes it almost impossible to navigate the passenger compartments (required to do in several missions).

2. The game is quite difficult to run smoothly (stutters every 20 seconds or so unless graphics are turned down quite a bit (GTX770).

3. The passengers that board and leave your train are animated clunkily and walk like zombies. Often they will get stuck on doors or on each other or just fall from the sky or fall through the floor before boarding your train (purely visual).

4. The manual is very lackluster, especially in explaining how the voice announcer programming works. I have tried all manner of combinations following the manual and yet I always get the ""wrong announcements"" warning at the end.

5. Saving is not possible during scenario missions.  This means that you are forced to play through 45+ minute missions in one go.

6. The scoring system is unintuitive and feels bugged (I always get the ""too hard braking"" message even when the hardest braking I used was the 1st setting...)

My biggest gripe however, is that the simulator feels very static. Once you have understood the routine of setting up a train and driving it your experience will never change. 
For example: 
The doors will always close no matter what. There is never any reason to open the driver door and check that they are safely closed (although this is implemented via hotkey).
The train will never fail a brake test. 
The signals always seem very predictable. A setting to make the signals more aggressive or passive would have been nice.
There are things like tunnel lighting (switch is on the platform), a horn and passenger heating, but as far as i can tell there is never any reason to use them (the game does not seem to register these). 
The only thing that changes are the lighting and weather effects. 
The only gauge that actually works in the cab view is the speedometer. Essential information (like timetable, and clock) must be accessed via an ugly overlay that totally breaks immersion.

Overall I can only recommend this game to hardcore fans of the London Underground. The circle line is modeled quite nicely after all. However if you expect a good subway simulator or rail simulator in general, look elsewhere.

There are a lot of interesting mechanics in this game that make this game very unique and enjoyable. However, although this game is superb it does come with its issues and some of which require immediate attention. [b]Don't be fooled by my play time. I currently own a hard copy of the game which I have played much more.[/b]

Firstly, this game really does stand out compared to other simulators such as Train simulator generally because of the idea of you being an actual person doing their job rather than just sitting in a train and off you go. I love the concept of the missions which also make the game extremely unique. However, being able to wonder around the stations is one of the best side features for this game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants something different than just driving.

Secondly, the detail is extraordinarily high. One thing that I look for in games is detail and boy, this game definitely checks all the boxes. When I bought this game, it was on an older computer therefore, I was unable to run it properly. However, recently, I receieved a new computer which I can play this on and therefore realise how much detail and effort was put into this game. All the stations have their own unique style to them which *should* (I say should because I have never been on the underground before) be nearly identical to their real life counterparts. I can definitely see with the detail shown in the stations that there was a lot of research that went into this game - much more than World of Subways 4 anyway. The detail is just amazing.

There are much more incredible things that are in this game which make is so amazing. But because I am quite a critial person I am going to move onto the ""bad stuff."" In this game there are numerous bugs that seriously need repairing. One of the ones that require that most amount of attention is a bug I noticed when you change a certain graphics option.

In the hard copy of the game Version 1.5 did not exist. I bought the game a while ago while it was on Version 1.3 (the hard copy that is) and I have to say that there is near to no game threatening bugs in that version. However, when buying this steam version (with Version 1.5 in it) I have noticed a massive bug that really requires attention from the developers end; although my PC is good, it is not the best of PCs therefore (like most people) you would change the graphics so that people would be able to get the most out of the game. Unfortunately, for me I have an issue with shadows in this game and cannot have them on without my framerate dropping from 60 FPS to around 40 FPS. Now I am not sinning that specific graphic option. I have noticed that if you turn that option off, when you are in first person or you get pushed into first person, you cannot move at all. You can move the camera but not the character. This really does require attention because every time you walk into the cab you get pushed into first person and get stuck which isn't the best and it ruins the game.

I have only noticed this issue with the steam version and not the hard copy on version 1.3 so I think there is a software issue with that. Furthermore, the text is a little off when you hover over things in this steam version however that isn't a game changing bug it is just a visual annoyance.

Overall, this game is exceptional. I think it really is an interesting game to play and I really love to play the hard copy of the game. However, if your computer isn't powerful enough to run the shadows then I would recommend buying the hard copy from amazon.

However, this game really is extraordinary and I really love playing it. It is just a couple of bugs with 1.5 that really require a bit of attention before this game is at it absolute best. I would really love to see some more lines put in (like being able to drive D stocks around the underground in the district line or implementing some S stocks as well to keep up with the times).

Generally, the choice is yours. I would reccomend buying this game. However, I would buy the hard copy of the game until this bug is fixed (who knows it might just be my PC messing up hehe).

I recommend the steam version for anyone who has a good enough PC to run the shadows. However, I would buy the hard copy off of amazon or Aerosoft if you have a PC like mine which can't run shadows. But I would recommend this game either way to anyone who is in to train simulators.

Mit WORLD OF SUBWAYS 3 werden sie zum U-Bahnfahrer.

Spiel ist dafür, dass es schon im Jahr 2013 erschienen ist schon relativ umfangreich.
Die Grafik ist gut(1-).
 Der Sound ist akzepttabel (2-).
 Der Realismusfaktor hält sich in Grenzen, da zum Beispiel die Größe der U-Bahn nicht real seien kann. Außerdem fällt man beim Betreten des Gleisbettes durch die Karte, das heist, dass alle Objekte keine Gravitation besitzen.(3-)
Die Performance ist gut(2). 
Leider gibt es noch viele Bugs.
Der Spielspaß ist noch akzeptablel, da wenn man zum Beispiel eine längere Strecke fährt, die Fahrt auf Dauer ziemlich langweilig(3)
Der Preis-Leistungs Faktor ist katastrophal. Für ein 2013 erschienenes Spiel mit leicht überdurchscnittlichen Qualität immer noch über 20 € zu verlangen ist nicht akzeptabel (4-).

FAZIT:
Das Spiel läuft flüssig und in einer Guten Grafik. Der Sound ist OK. Leider gibt es immer noch einige Bugs. Aber das Spiel ist überteuert. Es ist nur für U-Bahn Fans zu empfehlen. 
Trozdem empfehle ich dieses Spiel jedem der gerne einaml U-Bahn fahren möchte. Wer nicht allzu viel Geld in der Tasche hat, sollte dann vieleicht doch zum Vorgänger WORLD OF SUBWAYS 2-Berlin Line 7 greifen.

ERROR: Could not load VisionEnginePlugin.vPlugin(D)

이는 유니코드 에러 때문에 생기는문제로 이 문제를 해결하는 방법을 밑에 적어두도록 하겠습니다.


1) steam을 일단 종료합니다.

2) 이 게임이 설치되어있는 폴더 이름 ""World of Subways 3 – London Underground Circle Line""에 포함되어있는 문자 "" – ""*1 을 "" - ""*2 로 바꿔주세요.

* 1 "" – ""(Unicode U + 2013) en 대시
* 2 "" - ""(Unicode U + 002D) 하이픈 <- 북붙해서 이걸로 바꿔줍니다.

3) steamapps 폴더에 있는 파일 ""appmanifest_283620.acf""을 찾아서 메모장에서 연 다음 ""name""과 ""InstallDir""의 값도 폴더 이름과 똑같이 교체 해주시면 됩니다.

4) steam을 시작하고 게임을 시작합니다.

Overall, it's a pretty good sim. Graphics are fine, the route is done pretty well, and the ability to walk around your train and the stations is pretty cool. I can recommend it, but be prepared for something that will not work perfectly 100% of the time, but is done much better than other TML games like Fernbus Simulator or the following part of the World of Subways, WoS 4. 

[h1]What works[/h1]
1. Graphics are pretty decent.
2. The train is pretty well-detailed and most of the switches work, including the automatic announcer which is a very nice touch. I really hate those supposedly realistic trains from other games where most of the switches don't work at all. 
3. I don't share complains about controls. Those pretty fine for me and easy to use.
4. Route is pretty fun and varied.
5. It's pretty simple to learn and not that hard to master. Ideal for a casual game to play in the evening, and it's really fun to do everything you can to keep on schedule.

[h1]What doesn't work[/h1]
1. Stability. The game crashes way too often, and so far I was only able to finish full schedule once. Before that, the game crashed sometime after 30-40 mins. That's definitely not acceptable, especially that long after the game was released.
2. Controls outside the train. They're extremely clunky, and you can easily get stuck inside the cabin and have to wait until you're unstuck. 
3. Character models. You created a game where you encounter other characters, make them at least passable. 
4. A bug prevented me from completing the tutorial. It didn't want to go through after going inside the front driver's cabin.",1487404876,1487404876,True,41,3,0.815938234329223633,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I have to admit that I have always been a train buff, and when I was a kid I used to be allowed to drive the tube train between Epping Ongar (those were the days – you will never be allowed to do that now).  I remember once being the London Transport Museum in London, and hogging the train simulator which consisted of a laserdisc controlled with authentic tube train controls rather than the players remote-controller.  So this game has the potential to scratch this particular itch of mine.  So does it?

Yes it does is the answer.  If I have an hour free, I'll drive a train from Edgeware Road to Hammersmith watching as the passengers fall through the ceiling, land on the platform and board my train, just as I'm ready to shut the doors.  I'll get frustrated in a good way when I get stuck at a red light at Aldgate, and have to follow a slow district line train all the way to Edgeware Road knowing that scheduling has gone completely to pot.

Less entertaining though is the fact that even if I leave every station exactly on time, it still seems to tell me that I didn't teach a schedule.  It seems to randomly complain that I braked too hard.  It inconsistently whinges about the setting of the destination board.  So I seldom ever get above 83% approval.  So that could do with patching.

So this sounds pretty negative right?  Yes, but I would still recommend this game.  If you're 100% completion nut, the buggy rating system will get on your plums.  Luckily for me I'm really not that bothered – I could not give an airborne act of copulation if those wingey digital passengers went shooting down the carriage and brained themselves on an old ladies walking frame when I nearly overshot the station at Farringdon.  I just find the whole experience extremely relaxing.

I'm running a GTX 690, 16 GB and a Sandy Bridge Core I7, and I'm running the game on what passes for the ultra settings.  There does seem to be quite a bit of frame dropping, particularly in tunnels but it's not a dealbreaker.  I have not had any hard crashes or game breaking bugs.  Yes, when you walk off the platform you fall into the void and respawn and as I have said the passengers do some pretty spectacular acrobatics – including throwing themselves in front of a train.  So although you can walk about it's not the most polished aspect of the game – but to worry about that will be missing the point.

In summary, for me this game is great.  More please.  Preferably the Central Line.  With the long closed Epping – Ongar branch included.

My only concern is the longevity of the game. No mods, no extra ""missions"", so it's just a case of passing half an hour or so driving a train through a few stops. Also, the game-breaker (a bit like Train Simulator, but a lot worse) is that if you break the rules (TS, you pass through a red light, the game ends), if you speed here excessively, the game ends. Disappointing. Especially when you can see the next tube ahead, just a few yards, and the game is a bit boring, so you just want to crash, and you can't. I dunno. So much promise, but it's lacking in something. I have to ""recommend"", but I wish there was a button in the middle. A caveat. I'll say this. Bear in mind that gameplay is limited. You will get bored very quickly. And you will look at your list of Steam games and you'll think, ""Meh, not sure I can be arsed to drive a few passengers from this stop to the next.""

However, after rebooting the PC, I have had no such issues. (However, with RadeonPro active I had to CTRL-ALT-DEL then Cancel to get the missions to start. Removing RadeonPro, all was well. That's an old third-party app anyway; I thought I'd give it a try.)

I had to assign the ""Interact"" control to a different key and use that in place of the instruction to click on a door with the mouse, as there is no mouse pointer when you're in walk mode. Without doing that, I couldn't get more than two minutes into the training mission, as it was impossible to close the cabin door from the outside.

I also found the automatic announcement system to be off by one station (I think I failed to use the ""next station is closed"" announcement when passing through a closed station), but when I tried to reprogram it at South Kensington, it still kept announcing ""This is Gloucester Road"" even though I'd just told it to start from South Kensington. Minor issue, since you should know to hit the ""station closed"" button before you reach the closed Blackfriars station.

Also, one of the early missions has some incorrect text, as it tells you to take over a train on Platform 4, when actually the train is on Platform 3. In general the English text is rather clunky; the developers are native German speakers and they didn't hire any native English speakers to work on their English translations.

It didn't seem to mind that I had forgotten to set the destination sign on the train in the first non-training mission. I've now finished a few missions. While there appears to be no scoring system whatsoever -- you either complete the mission or you don't -- in fact there is something happening in the background. In a mission where you have to make up time, at the end I was told I had achieved ""59 of 60"" and therefore failed, but nothing that explained what those numbers represent. When completing missions, it doesn't appear take all the details into account like the destination sign.

However, I just tried to do a non-mission ""Drive to Schedule"" run, and at the end, it did point out that I hadn't set the destination sign correctly (I had set it to the ending station, but apparently that's not right -- maybe it wants the basic ""Circle Line""), and did in fact present a score of 72%. It mentioned braking too hard, going over the speed limit, and having the announcement system set wrong (which I did on the first station). So maybe that ""59 of 60"" in my failed mission means a score of 60% was necessary, even though mission completion screens don't give you any such score.

If you're not intimately familiar with the stations it can be difficult to know which way is east and which way is west sometimes. So when you have to take a train from High Street Kensington to Edgware end, you might take off and find the next station to be Gloucester instead of Notting Hill. I guess that's part of the challenge!

EDIT: In so doing the above mistake, I discovered that you can't actually collide with AI trains. When I found myself at the Gloucester Road station and realized I was going the wrong way, I reset the train to drive the opposite way and found myself head-on with another train that was stopped waiting for me. I figured the mission was over and decided slowly to bump into the AI train head-on... but I ended up driving straight through it and actually was able to complete the mission despite my detour.

Anyway, I am quite enjoying it. The detail is really nice. You have to (or rather, can) switch everything -- right down to the heating and ventilation systems for the passengers. (The windows even fog up if you don't turn the ventilation on, during certain times of night and weather conditions.) It doesn't have any complaint system from passengers like Bus Simulator 16 for example, though, at first glance or when doing missions, but in Drive to Schedule mode it does point out if you were braking too hard, so that counts as a passenger complaint.

If you want to slack off from your mission you can just hop onto any of the AI trains and take a ride as a passenger! That's pretty cool.

The riding of AI trains is part of the normal gameplay too. Some of your missions require you to hop onto a train to a particular station in order to take over control of another train at that station. Really nice feature! (As long as you know which way is east and which way is west so you get on a train in the correct direction!) The map included with the game is the entire Underground system; downloading a specific Circle Line map from the internet is highly recommended -- just make sure you get one from the 2009 expansion of the line, and make a note on it to yourself about Blackfriars being closed (for it was when this game was made), so you know when to hit the ""next station is closed"" button on the announcement computer in order to keep your announcements in synch (not that the game really cares if your announcements are correct, or even used at all; this game is very much a self-policing sim except in cases of speeding, running red lights or derailment (if derailment is turned on in options)).

So, as a simulation game, I do recommend it, despite all the crashes and the system lockup I experienced initially. Maybe my CPU or GPU was starting to overheat or something. I know many people have no such worries so I can't fault it too much -- just be aware that it may not be particularly stable for you, but try rebooting after installation, as that seems to have cured it for me. (It's using some sort of nVidia-branded engine, so it could be that it doesn't play nicely with ATI graphics cards.)

In terms of graphics settings, it has no anti-aliasing, so you might want to force your graphics card to provide that if you can handle the frame rate. The ""Glow"" option is HDR glow which is really horrible -- causing complete whiteout on a lot of signs. I found it looks much better with the Glow turned off. It does provide an anisotropic filtering slider, a selection of shadow qualities, the ability to turn off bump mapping, reflections, a simpler lighting system, etc., so there's a fair bit of optimization you can do if your frame rates suffer. I keep most things on max (shadows to Medium, Depth-of-Field Blur off and Motion Blur off), and manage 30 to 45 fps on average with my ATI R9 270, which is all right since you're never going over 40 mph.",1471586002,1472091335,True,2,1,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've always thought the idea of being stuck on a train with nothing to do in between stops a rather boring idea. However, this is not the case with WOS3. There is always something to do, always something to look out for, be it a speed limit, red light or station. 

The recreations of the stations are very realistic, as are the announcements and trains.

PROS:
-Realistic representation of the full circle line (bar one station that's closed)
-Interesting missions
-Freeroam, drive to/from most major stations as you please
-Ride as a passenger and walk around the stations
-Runs on a potato
-Amazingly realistic controls, almost every control is clickable
-Programmable announcements

CONS:
-Mind the gap.
-Buggy as hell (listed below)
-Drop through the floor sometimes (not game breaking as you respawn where you were before)
-GFX can be amazing, and also ""meh"" at the same time. They can be a real pain to setup at first.
-Holding SHIFT to click anything is a real pain in the *rse
-Spend 30 minutes on a mission, accidentally run a red light, game instantly over. No checkpoints. No saves. You have to start again.
-Train derails pretty easily, but derailing can be turned off in options, so again, not game breaking.

Overall, I love this game and I think it is well worth the £20 I paid for it.

In Train Simulator 2015, you are in a Train, but only a few stations, and you are like, ""Welp, this is it."" In World Of Subways Vol. 3, that is not the case. You have lots of stations, and because of this, you are always paying attention. It makes you really feel like a Train Driver.

Trundling around it is good fun. The graphics are generally good and the driving aspect seems realistic. 

That said, it is still a simulation game by a company who clearly don't have English as a first language, making the missions dull, the tutorial a bit awkward and some of the in-game information a bit odd. I'm not sure if the stats actually work because I seem to get the same score every time.

Setting up the train is an annoyance in the early stages, but it soon becomes second nature. Once you're rolling it's fairly straightforward and the HUD's provide useful info that without them, it'd be a much harder sim. 

It does have a bit of an ""early access"" vibe to it, so I would recommend waiting for it on discount. I'm glad I didn't pay the 18.99 asking fee for it, I would have felt ripped off. There are some quirks which just make it seem a bit unpolished. But the driving and track detail is very polished, everything else is average. The menu screen doesn't even make sense, it's a bunch of Matrix numbers floating around, absolutely nothing to do with the London Underground, or trains, or anything really.

I just wanted to drive some trains around the Circle Line, I was able to do that, so can only recommend it. Just because the graphics can be raised or lowered, doesn't affect me, I always play on low cos I prefer frame-rate over ambient occlusion, so no extra nor removed points there. But there are some reservations still and so would say at full price you might feel a bit cheated.

+ Lovely representation of the Circle Line
+ Fun to drive your train, fairly simple driving mechanics after steep introductory learning curve
+ You ultimately know what you're in for if you're looking at this type of game, and it delivers that well enough

- Only 2 basic modes of play, and with bugged stats that effectively makes it just 1 mode of play - drive a train from A to B because you want to drive a train from A to B.
- Price doesn't reflect the quality of the game, the budget went into the track mapping, everything else suffered
- It's a simulation only, there is no ""game"", the missions are lackluster and they could have easily created twice as many (and had some English proof-read it)

Another point is knocked off because they've purposefully disabled their Steam forum here, so if you have any tech questions and are looking for quick answers which Steam forums generally always provide, well you've pretty much been told to go fuck yourself. No Steam forum for your Steam game is a big no-no in this day and age, especially when your game could do with an update or two!

This game is brilliant, i remember when i first got this game, i was so excited, i love simulators!

PROS:
- When graphics turnt up, its really pretty
- Realistic sounds and Announcements
- Easy to control (IN THE CAB)
- Being a passenger, i love this feature, i have no idea why.
- Signalling System is realistic
- All stations! (Other than blackfriars)

CONS:
- Horrible control scheme when moving
- Quite laggy at first start.
- Very glitchy at times, falling through the train ETC.
- I like having an even amount of cons.

Pros....

. Circle line has been very well recreated for all I know
. Realistic DVA announcements for all stations
. The London Underground C-Stock trains have been very well recreated
. Sounds...though not all that realistic such as the track rumble but awesome!
. The simulation is very smooth and not choppy at any point in the game
. Great graphics
. Cab sway effects are available, Raindrops show on the interior as well as exterior of the train bit only on the glass, not the entire body. Windows reflect the actual thing! Be it the tunnel lighting, station platforms, railings or whatever! All of it is very accurately reflected!
. Game does not crash

Cons.....

. Some platforms are way too cloae to the tracks. The train drives through them at some stations
. When driving from Hammersmith to Edgeware Road, at Edgeware road...the announcement does not say ""Where this train terminates"" like it does at Hammersmith
. Not too many weather options
. No shifts you can choose
. The Debriefing of the gameplay is bound to have an error listed on it that was never made...so you never get a perfect score even after doing everything perfectly!
. Sometimes...passengers fall from the footbridges onto the platform
. Signalling is not very good because the AI is given preference over your train every zingle time especially at Edgeware Road
. Restriction in views. Unlike the previous games...you don't have a passenger and trackside camera. The only external view of the train is the Head-out from cab view

It does everything right, World of Subways 3 allows you to experience driving a train in the London Underground. This experience, including the setting up of the trains, is modelled in detail and a lot of fun. You are limited to the London Circle Line, however the full line is a lot of fun to drive. You can also explore each station in first person or third person mode. Minor gripe: avoid using the first person mode, as it can be highly disorienting.

The Pros:
- Detailed simulation
- Explore stations
- Beautiful visuals
- Above and below ground
- Challenging missions

The Cons:
- First person view outside of the train's cab
- Takes a while to figure out the game's logic

What to remember:
- Set up the tail lights at the end of your train.
- You can figure out which way your train is heading by the lights. Look for the traffic management lights at the start of the platform. That is the direction your train is heading.
- Don't forget to hit TAB to hit the deadman's switch.

Who is this game for:
- Fans of train simulators, like Train Simulator 2016. Just think about this as a piece of standalone DLC for Train Simulator.
- Fans of simulation games.

Well worth the money. The graphics are superb and it replicates the London Underground very well. I think that it is great that they included the new Hammersmith line extension. Not only can you drive trains, but you can also walk around and explore the world of the Circle Line. You can get on other trains to go to different stations. This is a brilliant simulation game for anyone interested in the Underground. There are even dynamic passengers on the platforms and the automated announcement system is included with the game. It does require quite a meaty graphics card though. I have 12GB RAM, Intel Core i7 processor and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 850M graphics card. It runs well on my system, with a solid 40fps on average.
It's a shame they didn't include the S Stock to drive, as that would have made it fantastic, but at least we still get to drive the good old C Stock! The D stock for the District line is also in the game, but you can't board it.
There's only a couple of issues I have spotted with the game so far. The penalising is quite harsh. If you go just about 5mph over the speed limit, it says 'game over'! You don't even get a warning! This can be very frustrating, especially if you have been driving in a mission for about an hour! Also, if you pass a red light, the same applies, but I suppose that is fairer.
Also, it would have been nice if you could sit down on the passenger seats, because when you are riding as a passenger, you are forced to stand, even though there are dozens of availaible seats.

The ""game"", first off, really isn't much of a game. If it was, you would call driving a subway IRL is a game. That is how amazing the realism, physics, and controls are. You find that if anything, this is a true simulator, just with game quality graphics, (go look at the training simulators for heavy macheinery.)

I'm still in awe about the quality of the physics. The train (if you'll call it that) responds like the ones I remember from my trips to London. You even get full functionality of the switches, panels, you name it. If you see it, odds are it does something. You really need to do the tutorial to know how to do stuff, as I've said, it's got every part. You need to do stuff in both ends of the train before it will move.

The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, as from my experience so far the weather seems ""Stuck"", like it's about to rain, but there is still some lighting like a sunny day on certain scenery objects. The graphics do put all of the parts on the dash and train into account. You just have to see that for yourself. I really can't say much on the performance, as I built my computer with flagship parts, I don't know what it'll run like for you.

There are a few things that seem to take away from the simulator. Example: ""Game Over"" when you pass a red light even by a micron split in half. I just wish it didn't show the game over, because it's frustrating, and people pass red lights by up to ten feet, and they aren't shot on sight for it. The menu also seems a little bland and unintuitive, not a big issue, but leaves a bad first impression. Then the controls can be finicky, as it can be hard to know where a ""rotating"" type switch, and sometimes ""spins cluelessly"" if you don't know what way to move the mouse for that control.

Anyone looking at this game has a love for the subject matter, and the package/presentation seem promising... 

...But less than thirty seconds in, you begin to miss basic 1st-person functionality, such as walking backwards (edit: and sideways). The collision fields are not very generous (for example, it's easy to get stuck by the cabin seat). Falling onto the tracks sends you to the abyss, and I experienced a system-crippling crash within the first five minutes of trying to operate the train (without the knowledge bestowed by the tedious tutorial).

If you really just want the experience of The Tube, this simulator simply isn't ready for prime time just yet. However, my fingers are crossed; not many developers seem so passionate about such a particular subject matter. Check back after a couple of patches (and I'll update this review at that point).

EDIT:

Almost nine years later, I gave this another whirl, and unfortunately my original concerns still hold true... Just getting the train to move is arduous, even though I admit the train's controls eventually made sense, despite the tutorial and the interface actively working against me. I then missed a red light ~3m (meters, not minutes) into the journey and was abruptly exited from the tutorial, and punished with another hard crash.

My next attempt was more successful - I was able to conduct the train through several stations, careful to observe signals and speed limits, but then apparently missed the station I needed to stop at (as usual, my tutorial ""guide"" wasn't much help). I tried reversing, but was unsuccessful... Upon exiting the train to walk to the rear cabin, I once more fell into the abyss...

Again, I'm positive there's a gem of an experience here - the gravity of the subject matter is highly compelling to some of us - which adds to my frustration. All said, given the passion required to overcome the enormous investment of time and patience, you may be better off simply moving to London, entering an apprenticeship with the TfL, and actually getting paid for the work...

The sounds are really good and include announcement voices on-board the train and at stations. Train sounds are also very nice, I can't find a fault with them.  

Graphics are great, although there is some blurring in the distance, but this doesn't matter so much considering you're usually in a tunnel, or watching the track and signals in front of you anyway. 

Simulation is top notch and very realistic. You can actually get out of the train and walk about the stations.

If you do, you'll find this title surprisingly immersive. Although the physics aren't the best (train doesn't appear to be affected by grades at all), and I get some minor clipping issues during rainy weather (to do with not being able to walk/run properly), this is by far probably the best offering from WOS yet and puts you in the seat of driving a subway train in the London Underground. 

The fact that most of the cockpit/cab is clickable is a big plus too and setting up a train and running to a tight schedule is very fun indeed. You get a choice of some pre-defined missions with various challenges/situations (you can actually 'see' some of the rail maintenance works going on!!), but you can also drive to your own custom schedule with selectable routes, weather and time. In some of the missions you have to couple trains and switch them around from one end to the other, this involves getting up from your seat in the cab and running around as you frantically set the train(s) up for the next leg of the journey, flipping switches, doing brake tests and ensuring passengers get a smooth, timely journey.

Even with the minor issues, I've found this to be quite addictive, and the experience of the train shuddering and vibrating about on the tracks - not to mention the sound package, makes this a worthwhile sim for the money. The only thing that's missing is some nice DLCs/add-ons/3rd party mods, but even without these, it's a solid offering.

I love how there are other AI trains running in the network which you can (and sometimes need to) board. I love how passengers board and disembark trains, and how station announcements call just like in real life. 

And I also love how well it runs on my computer. Other TML games (particularly Bus and Cable Car) run pretty poorly. The engine has clearly been optimized.

However - it does need a good polish. Some negative points:

• You cannot move if the camera cuts into your avatar
• 'THAT' stepping/walking sound
• Depth-of-field, even when turned off
• The missions need to be better explained - careful consultation of a tube map sometimes isn't enough. A few times I've set off in the wrong direction

But most importantly: Gameplay will be instantly cut for failing to set up your train correctly, for running red lights, for going even a LITTLE over the limit, for accidently opening doors on a service run, etc. Having to go through the mission ALL OVER AGAIN cause you accidently pressed F5 is a ballache.

However, these are small points, and so long as you drive to the book on missions, they will certainly not spoil your experience.

Odmala jsem velký fanoušek metra, a proto mi tahle série přirozeně nemohla ujít. A právě třetí díl z úžasné Londýnské podzemky se mi ze všech líbí nejvíce a hraji ho dle chuti prakticky dodnes. Pěkná grafika, zajímavé detailní prostředí, skvěle vymyšlené ovládání a pohyb v kabině vlaku (nebo mimo ni). Fajn je, že kabina je částečně interaktivní a vše se dá ovládat jen myší. Líbí se mi i možnost volného pohybu po stanicích či využívání ostatních vlaků na trati jako pasažér, kdy si můžete projet celé metro a každou stanici si v klidu projít po svých.

Samotné ovládání vlaku (k dispozici máte pro Londýn typickou soupravu C-Stock, která na Circle Line skutečně jezdí) je pohodové a nikterak složité. Zní to i vypadá to skvěle. Scénářů bohužel moc není, je jich jen pár, ale víceméně to stačí. Hlavní je stejně ježdění podle jízdního řádu. Trať sice není nijak extra dlouhá, ale má víc jak 30 stanic a přejetí z jednoho konce na druhý, respektive její objetí dokola (je to okružní linka) trvá více jak hodinu. A to už je vcelku slušné. Fajn je také to, že se nejezdí jen v tunelech, protože velká část trasy vede i po povrchu nebo v otevřených koridorech. Takže si užijete nejen sluníčka, ale rovněž ostatních rozmarů počasí, včetně deště a pěkně udělaného opocování oken.

Co se týče prostředí, jak jsem již uvedl, je detailní a dobře se na něj kouká, což u vlakových simulátorů zrovna nebývá zvykem. Hra navíc na rozdíl od svých předchůdců působí živě a ne tak sterilně, jak tomu bylo u podobných her dříve. Tudíž tolik nenudí. Na trati je fungující systém dopravy, kdy ve špičce není problém se courat za jiným vlakem, který vás brzdí a často musíte čekat před stanicí, než z ní odjede. Stejně tak potkáváte vlaky z jiných linek. Ve stanicích zase čekají cestující, kteří hned po otevření dveří nastupují či vystupují. A to nejen do vašeho vlaku, ale i do vlaků ostatních. Všude se zkrátka pořád něco děje a vy máte pocit, že to kolem vás žije, což nesmírně oceňuji.

Abych to tedy nějak shrnul, WoS3 je vcelku povedená hra. Sice rozhodně není dokonalá a popravdě má spoustu chybiček (kterých není zrovna málo). Přesto je to asi nejlépe vypadající a celkově nejvydařenější simulátor metra, který si můžete v současné době zahrát. I přes své nedostatky umí opravdové nadšence zabavit a navodit tu správnou atmosféru skutečné podzemky. Jsem zvědav na další díl, který bude opět z New Yorku a měl by vyjít už letos. I když u mě to zkrátka asi tenhle třetí díl z Londýna nepřekoná, protože přece jen mám raději evropské prostředí. A zrovna Londýnské metro má své osobité a nezaměnitelné kouzlo, které prostě jinde nenajdete.",1404599458,1404599458,True,11,1,0.677419364452362061,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It's definitely a true simulator in every sense of the word. You are responsible for running a subway train in London's Underground on the Circle Line. You will need to set up your train before setting off, including going to the rear of the train to turn on your tail lights, then walking to the front of the train to start the train, turn on any additional lighting (headlights, cab light, passenger compartment lights) as well as turning on the heat for the passenger compartment. You will then need to change the train's sign to indicate the route you're running, and set up the automated voice messages to correspond to the route you're running, so that station arrivals are properly announced. You can also manually trigger announcements through the same control panel used for the automated messaging system.

This is not a 'lite' simulator, you are responsible for performing your duties as if you were actually driving the subway train. Failure to follow speed limits will cause you to fail (at least in missions), and you want to maintain the schedule to the best of your ability. There are also signal lights that you will need to follow in order to be successful.

The missions aren't so much missions as they are tutorials. They work well in this regard, however it would have been nice if they included a mission editor and workshop support so that more varied missions could be created by the community. The missions can be fun, though a bit challenging at first as you're learning the ropes of driving the train, and while you're learning the route, you can find yourself accidentally speeding, which can cause you to fail the mission requiring you to restart the mission from the beginning (if you wish to complete the mission at all, as the missions are optional.) Once you're done with the mission (if you choose to do them), you're then free to select a route and drive it, just as if you were scheduled to drive that route for your shift that day. While saving your progress is not possible during missions, you can save your progress when just driving a route. This affords you the ability to stop at a station, save the game, and return later to finish your 'shift'.

Graphically, the game looks fantastic as there's lots of detail in and out of the tunnels, that give you the feel of really being on a subway line. Things like new pieces of rail sitting along the side of the tracks, that are waiting to be put in place are common, as are things like shipping pallettes. Each station seems unique and it seems quite a bit of attention to detail has been put into each station, so that the more you drive, the more easily you start to recognize a station as you pull in. I've never been to London, so I can't say whether the stations are accurate to their real-world counterparts, but I can say that each station definitely maintains a uniqueness, so you never feel like each station is just a cookie cutter copy and paste job of any other station. The models for the driver (your character) and the passengers could use some polish however.

In the audio department, they've done a decent job using believable sound effects that you would expect to hear while riding on a subway train. I'd say they're a notch above utilitarian, but they're not bad by any stretch of the imagination. Simply, they do the job of conveying the sounds you would expect to hear in a believable manner.

As for the controls, they work well, though I'm now using a Rail Driver unit with it instead of just the mouse and keyboard, which has helped me in terms of overall immersion. Despite using the Rail Driver controller, I still need to use the SHIFT + Mouse combination to interact with some things like the automated station announcement system. The Rail Driver unit is natively supported, but the levers and switches used do not line up with the default control stickers, so it takes a bit of getting used to. For example, the Auto Brake lever is actually the throttle control, while the Independant Brake lever is the gear selector. It feels a tad awkward at first since those aren't the way the controls are set up for other train simulators, but once you get used to it, it really does become second nature.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys passenger-orientated train operations simulations. The challenge is getting to each station on time without speeding or running any red lights. I'm running it quite well on my laptop (an HP DV6-6135dx) which has an AMD A-8 3500 APU, though I did have to turn a few graphics options down to smooth it out. I still get an occasional stutter here and there, but with the slightly lower graphical settings I'm using, it remains mostly a smooth experience.

I would not recommend this for someone that just wants to drive a train as if they were driving a HO-Scale or N-Scale model railroad, as it's a bit more complex than that, but if you enjoy passenger operations in other simulators, and don't mind a bit of a learning curve in order to properly drive the train, then there's quite a bit of enjoyment to be had here.",1400274111,1400285550,True,34,0,0.671838045120239258,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're into these kind of games then you'll enjoy it, if you're expecting an exciting game with heart pounding adventure then you'll be instantly bored.

The game does feel like it needs a lot of polish - the interface is clunky - you have to hold the 'shift' button whenever you want to interact with any controls in the cabin - although there are keyboard shortcuts for some controls. 

Once you get used to the controls though driving the train is pretty easy and it's pretty cool seeing the different parts of London as you drive through - except of course when you're in a tunnel (which is a lot of the time) and that's the main problem with this game really, although the detailed and accurately modelled train stations are nice to see (which you can explore on foot as well).

There are 2 modes you can play - missions and 'drive to schedule' which is basically free mode where you get to choose your route, time of day and weather. The missions are pretty much similar to train simulator - drive so and so route and keep to schedule - with emergencies and whatever else thrown in to challenge you. 

The game is very harsh when you do something wrong during a mission (like speeding) - it will instantly end the mission, instead of giving you penalty points like train simulator.

I also had issues when first playing - the framerate was VERY low, as in 10-15 FPS. My PC can run Skyrim on ultra settings with a smooth framerate, so it was a bit surprising. 

I checked the graphics settings and turned the anti-aliasing and bump mapping sliders all the way down which made the game smooth and playable (I kept draw distance to 'very high' though which you'll want to do unless you don't mind having buildings pop out almost in front of you). After doing this the graphics still look impressive enough for me.

I recommend it if you're really, REALLY into your sim games, if not you might want to save your money - you'll likely get bored after a while.",1400024023,1400024573,True,124,5,0.900429368019104004,2,True,False,False,False,,,
