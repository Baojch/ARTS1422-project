There' s a real feeling of scale - it's like the Destinations scenes but on a larger scale. I found the movement system a bit disconcerting at first - it's possible to just go zooming off into infinity or jump huge distances and it's not the thing you'd demo to someone new to VR at the moment.
   Maybe the suggestion of a space suit/helmet and thruster controls/backpack for a more comfortable movement system. Some improved modelling on the Lunar Module.
I'm sure this is stuff the devs are considering - if it were just a worlds simulator with differing gravity to suit environments i'd still be happy.
  If you like space, want to imagine what it would be like to be on the surface of another planet or moon then give this a go.
PS: Can't exit the game and have to take off the HMD and shut down steamvr to exit.",1470558577,1470827579,True,28,1,0.730840981006622314,5,True,False,True,False,,,
