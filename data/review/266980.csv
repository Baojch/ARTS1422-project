The visuals are the big plus of this game as the plot is rather thin. Most of the puzzles are engaging and fun but mostly I just loved watching what visuals the game gave to me.

It used to run on DOS / windows95 with CD support on a 100Mhz pentium machine.


It Works on Linux, have some quick saves options build in, music plays properly, you can skip the intro.
Movement arround the mazes can be done with arrow keys, fullscreen view toggle is available with F1.

The cons :
The ending scene is kinda disapointing after the atmospheric build up.
The items are wreidly placed and many things are unexplained, it is part of its charm however, I've spend so many hours trying to figure out the logic of the puzzles however for some there is none.
Some interresting items you grab are pointless while others more mundane are key to the success of the your run.

Keep in mind that you operate in a frozen time continuum, changes you engage in a past keyframe can affect future keyframes.
- There is one hidden key in the music box at the bar (silver color).
- Before stealing the last artefact in the lunar base be sure to have the brass key
- To avoid running out of coins make sure to insert one in the phone booth, coins are needed to enter the garden maze from the phonebooth side.

The fact it unfortunately came out a few months before Myst does not take out the fact it is in itself not a good game. It has good ideas, and wants to tell a nice story, but ultimately it is quite academic, boring, and repetitive. So much wandering in labyrinths without anything to do, and with totally unjustified and random environments. The art also is quite messy, and often doesn't fit. It is not an awful game, just mediocre/bad. So many text adventures are better than this, and to be fair, if you need to play fantasy 3D puzzle games from the 90s, Myst is the masterpiece.

TLDR: Abandonware Grade. Works fine. Finnicky and features adventure game concepts that are universally regarded as poor game design such as dead end scripting and moon logic. 

This is a linear point&click adventure game with scripting that can leave you stuck in dead ends. The navigation is confusing due to the disconnected nature of the still shots. The control scheme is non standard and uses an odd point&click adventure interface. Most icons will usually fail working on most scenery objects making the trial and error a little bit frustrating. Narratively the game is interesting and pits you as an everyday joe getting contacted by some kind of atlantis parallel dimension kind of person, so that gives an excuse for mismatched assets and rather fantasy-ish looking stills. However the obscure nature of the puzzles, the reliance on mazes, lack of ability to fullscreen correctly on widescreen monitors, odd control scheme, and dated audiovisual quality really detracts from the immersiveness and even I would say just flat out usability.",1507347226,1509875917,False,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I like it, let's be clear on that, but I love this type of game in general, so that is certainly affecting my judgement.  But many other games do this better, and this game engages in some prime sins of bad point and click adventures.

Pros:

Gorgeous artwork
Nicely varied locations
Decent puzzles
Good music

Cons:

Counter intuitive control scheme
Repetitive Mazes
No settings access

Sins:

1.  Looking at an object should never result in the message ""Nothing Happens.""  Everything you look at should have a description, and if you're looking at something that was never programmed to be looked at, the message should at least say something more like ""This isn't anything important.""
2.  You can work yourself to points where you are stuck, but not dead.  This shouldn't happen in this type of game.  You should always be able to progress, or, if you can't, see that the game has ended.
3.  There are many items which you can pick up which serve no purpose in the game.  If they do, and I just don't see it, then I apologize, ignore this complaint, and in small doses this is okay, but during the course of the game there were more items in my inventory which I did not use than those that I did.  
4.  There is not much to do compared to the amount of area you can cover.  I've gone through huge mazes that had nothing important inside them (for example, the hedge maze) and may as well have been one room.  it doesn't encourage the type of exploration a player will want to take part in.

Verdict:  If you're REALLY jonesing for a stroll through the adventure games of the 90s, get it.  it's cheap.  I got it on sale, when it was REALLY cheap, and for the price, it was worth it.  If you want a good point and click game from the 90s though, I could better recommend:

Myst
Lighthouse
Shivers
The Journeyman Project Series

The world of the Labyrinth is a patchwork of surrealism, Art Deco, and classical architecture. The art direction is mesmerizing. There is simply nothing else like it in any game. Every room is with worth seeing, every useless inventory item worth examining, every dead-end worth the trek. The dark, horror-influnced soundtrack reinforces the idea that the Labyrinth is a truly alien place, and the light-sci-fi archaeological time travel story is also entertaining.
