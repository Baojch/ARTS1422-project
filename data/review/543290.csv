[I] Void and Nothingness [/i] aroused in me rather conflicting emotions xD I'll leave it to you to decide if you'd like to experience that. 

Praises:
+The greatest feature in my opinion is art (♥ω♥*) The style feels quite unique, plus it's so dynamic, visuals change so often, sometimes it's almost like watching a video. I mean how it often happens in typical visual novels--you may read for dozens of hours looking at the same sprites (rarely reflecting their emotions in their facial expressions), backgrounds are changed occasionally, still we have to look at the same image again and again. If you are lucky, you'll stumble upon a breathtaking CG and it feels like an amazing achievement. In this very short game I saw so many exciting images, several times I clicked hoping to see a more suitable for ss text but...it was gone, artist has made such an awesome job just to present their art for a second to change it with something equally beautiful. That was truly enjoyable! <3

+The story is quite thought-provoking. There were totally unexpected plot-twists. Horror and sexual content tags are presented in an unusual way. In general, that was quite an atmospheric read. Some things felt familiar. I was born in a Siberian village but several years ago I moved to the capital. And the contrast is huuuuge. I don't share MC's negative thoughts and revelations but many things she mentions are close to me too in this regard.

Complaints:
--short. You can finish it for less than an hour.
--I think the price is too high. If I remember it right I bought it during the summer sale, I'd recommend the same, to purchase it only with a good discount.
--I wish the text was bigger :( The beginning and the end is just tiny white text somewhere lost in the huge black background. In contrast to bright and vivid main story that felt like such a flaw/loss really. I mean maybe it was something contributing to the name of the game. But anyway the text could be presented in a more convenient way :(
--My greatest complaint is SETTINGS! T_T The game lauches immediately, no main menu. That's how I start any game—I go to the settings section first and set everything the way I prefer. Nothing like that here. :( I couldn't save. Dunno I was playing somewhere at 5am, sleep deprived greatly, maybe my brain was lagging but there was only quicksave but clicking it nothing happened. So I finished the game in one go xD Though I initially planned just to check it before going to bed :D I couldn't hide the text, H didn't work. F12 didn't work for screenshots. I think I used special programs for such games years ago, that was a serious exercise for my barely staying conscience brain to recollect where that program was on my computer XD and how it worked. It took me several attempts to upload my screenshots. 
--typos and several times there was text in brackets with (/) as if they forgot to delete some author's/editor's remarks, I dunno even what it was but it shouldn't be there for sure. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834063127 
--The ending felt kinda...weird. O_O I mean, those final lines would be fine and all but then there was that annoying button to Restart and clicking it the game just started again, the way the button claimed xD No changes, no skipping key. I was furious. Then I kinda found out pressing randomly different keys on my keyboard that 'Space' forced the story to skip, I don't even know if the text was absolutely (un)read. Perhaps it was planned as a constant loop, that never-ending wheel of life. No idea. Because at one point without any warning the game just closed on its own xD For some second I was looking absentmindedly, half asleep/half awaken at the screen, questioning what's just happened—was it smth intentional, some devs' genius feature or...just a bug xD But finally decided it was the perfect finale and went to bed. XD

Perhaps, I should choose a neutral review with a thumb down considering the number of '–' here xD But story-wise and visually the game is enjoyable enough. I want to believe the story may be fixed in all other aspects.

Conoceremos a una chica de compañía que vive sola en Manhattan, contenta con su vida, con su profesión y con el chulo que le consigue trabajos con clientes importantes. Hasta que un día entra en la habitación de un hotel y presencia algo para lo que no estaba preparada.

La introducción está muy bien narrada, y nos permite entender a su protagonista. Una chica que ha sufrido pero que ha superado las adversidades, que siente que está en un momento de su vida en el que tiene todo lo que necesita, y aunque el resto de la gente la mire con deseo o con desprecio, a ella no le importa.

La escena siguiente en el hotel comienza siendo una situación normal en un caso así: allí espera una chica más joven, confusa e insegura, y saben que pronto entrará su cliente y empezará su trabajo. 

Pero entonces… sucede algo que cambiará su vida para siempre. Un giro inesperado que de repente convierte una historia mundana en algo especial. 

Y tan pronto como empiezas a interesarte por su situación y las consecuencias que sabes que no tardarán en llegar… se acaba.

Sí, menos de media hora después de comenzar a leer esta novela todo ha terminado. Y comienzas a pensar que esa introducción que tan buenos momentos presagiaba no estaba ahí más que para alargar un poco más la historia y que podría haber durado la mitad. Una historia muy bien ilustrada pero que en realidad no era más que una pequeña idea, un relato corto que no se podía alargar más bajo pena de forzar la paciencia y la inteligencia del lector.

Es una lástima que media hora sea todo lo que ofrece el juego, pero parece que es el formato que le gusta a sus autores así que tendremos que conformarnos con este tipo de experiencias cortas. Es un juego muy difícil de recomendar, la historia me ha gustado pero la duración y el precio (4,99 euros) no.",1488308652,1488308652,False,4,0,0.586864471435546875,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The art is beautiful, and the music really builds up the atmosphere.

I was all set to give this a positive review, and then a twist ending abruptly sucked everything interesting and ambiguous out of the story, leaving only a husk of tired cliche, and I just felt cheated.
