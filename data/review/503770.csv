Ich schreibe alles was aktuell ist, in Doppelklammern zwischen die ursprüngliche Rezi. (( ... ))


Witziges Game. Man steht auf Türmen und schießt mit Pfeil und Bogen auf Orks und Drachen. Wenn man die lahmen ersten Runden hinter sich gebracht hat, wird es anstrengend und witzig. Denn die Orks können einem auch etwas entgegen schleudern (eine Axt? - ((ja, es sind Äxte)) ), und die Drachen mit Feuer töten - man muss also ausweichen (sich ducken oder auf einen anderen Turm beamen - Letzteres habe ich noch nicht getestet, scheint aber die einzige Möglichkeit zu sein, den Feuerdrachen zu entkommen ((- der Feuerdrache muss abgeschossen werden. Da ich ihn anfangs scheinbar nie getroffen habe, habe ich auch nie den Schadensbalken gesehen. Darum dachte ich, man muss ihm ausweichen und kann ihn nicht töten. Das war ein Irrtum. Schießt man ihn nicht ab, wird er einen töten und ins Haus eindringen)) - ((anstrengend wird das Spiel irgendwann nicht mehr so sehr. Trifft man schneller und besser, muss man auch Äxten weniger ausweichen. Man kann natürlich dennoch eine Art Workout aus dem Spiel machen, indem man seine Schießmechanik entsprechend anwendet, und absichtlich so spielt, das die Orks einen bewerfen. Und ins Schwitzen kommt man ab einem gewissen Level dann auf jeden Fall doch)) ). Mit jeder Runde werden es mehr und sie werden schneller ((bzw. braucht man mehrere Treffer, um sie zu besiegen)). Wie in anderen TD-Spielen auch. 

Pfeil und Bogen können aufgerüstet werden, man kann auch Heiltränke oder sowas kaufen. Der Standardbogen ist aber auch schon ziemlich cool und nützlich. Bin gespannt, inwieweit sich die power  verbessert ((Scheinbar gar nicht. Was sich ändert, ist allerdings die Chance auf mehr kritische Treffer, die Orks zu vereisen, mehr XP oder Gold oder ähnliches. Der Pfeil an sich wird aber nicht stärker oder schneller, was aber nicht tragisch ist. Denn er funktioniert ausreichend gut und es gibt ja die erwähnten anderen Boni.)) 

Möglich sind Einzelspielerrunden ((Mit Ranking-System)) und online Spiele (man kann einfach in ein schon stattfindendes Spiel beitreten und spart sich so mitunter auch die ersten Runden - oder selbst eins erstellen ((co-op und pvp sind möglich)) ). Habe mehrere  Gruppen finden können, das Spiel wird also auch gespielt. Und macht mit anderen mehr Spaß.

((Es wäre schön, wenn man mit späteren Runden beginnen könnte und nicht immer bei Runde 1 beginnen muss. Einfach weil ich persönlich nicht immer die Zeit und Lust habe, mich durch den ""langweiligen"" Part zu kämpfen. 

Der Mix der Feinde ist an sich okay. Es könnten aber ein paar spaßige Orks mit eingebaut werden. Zum Beispiel welche, die (irrsinnig schnell) springen oder Purzelbäume machen, oder sich in der Luft drehen/durch die Erde bohren - irgendwas, was es schwerer macht sie zu treffen. Aber eben auch lustiger. Vielleicht müssen sie ja nicht zwingend großen Schaden anrichten, aber es gibt dann eine besondere Belohnung, wenn man sie trifft. Zum Beispiel der Heilungsbalken des Hauses geht wieder nach oben - oder sowas.  Und Bonuspunkte für denjenigen, der getroffen hat.  Das würde mehr Abwechslung in das Spiel bringen. 

Die Plattform auf der man steht, könnte sich bewegen, was die Schwierigkeit des Spieles erhöht. 

In anderen Rezensionen wurde vorgeschlagen, verschiedene Zeiten/Wetter einzubauen. Das wäre in der Tat sehr spannend, vor allem wenn es sich innerhalb einer Runde ändern würde. Es wird dunkel, die Orks leuchten an gewissen Stellen - es wird schwieriger, aber auch spannender, sie zu treffen. Oder die Orks tragen irgendwas mit sich rum, und wenn man das ausversehen trifft, wird Nebel ausgelöst. Oder ein kurzer Sturm - die Pfeile fliegen also ins ""Unsichtbare"" oder werden vom Wind woanders hin getragen. Oder ein plötzlicher, unvorbereiteter Stellungswechsel. Da gäbe es wahnsinnig viele Möglichkeiten, um den doch eher gleichbleibenden Ablauf etwas ins Chaotische und Ungewisse zu bringen. Andererseits hat man in höheren Wellen dann genug zu tun :) . )) 

(Was die Community betrifft, habe ich oft das Gefühl, dass es eher ein Gegeneinander, statt Miteinander ist ((ganz anders als im Spiel ""After The Fall"", wo man zu viert Horden von Zombies bekämpft und es immer sehr kooperativ zugeht)). An sich ist das Ziel möglichst hohe Wellen zu erreichen in dem man zusammen arbeitet. Es springen aber sehr oft Leute ab, wenn jemand besser spielt als sie oder mehr Punkte erreichen ((das kann man im Verlauf des Spieles schon sehen, ist aber auch vom Turm abhängig, auf welchem man steht. Es gibt manche Türme, die anderen überlegen sind)). Oder sie legen ihre Headsets nieder und ""streiken"".  Selbst wenn man ganz langsam und angepasst spielt ((man sieht im Spiel, welche Stufe die Mitspieler im Spiel erreicht haben und weiß dann auch, wie viel Zeit sie mit diesem verbrachten)), absichtlich daneben trifft, die anderen machen lässt und erst eingreift, wenn die Orks das Tor stürmen wollen. Ich verstehe es nicht. Zumal es die Möglichkeit des privaten Spieles gibt, wo kein Fremder dann stört. 
Wie auch immer, von den Spielern die besser sind, als man selbst, kann man eine Menge lernen. Auch wenn es ärgerlich sein kann, wenn sie mehr und schneller treffen. Mit höheren Wellen werden auch sie genug zu tun haben und es bleiben auch Orks für einen selbst übrig. Also einfach weiter machen und man wird sich sehr schnell verbessern und mithalten können... Und dann macht es extrem viel Spaß und wird ein schönes Workout.) 

Wenn man alleine spielt, kann man gut Musik dabei hören. Meine Favoriten, die sehr gut passen, wie ich finde:

Feuerschwanz - Warriors of the world (alternativ das Original von Manowar)
Wind Rose - Diggy, Diggy Hole
Blackbriar - I'd Rather Burn, Snow White And Rose Red 
Ruelle - War Of Hearts
Bring Me The Horizon - Kingslayer
Halestorm - I Miss The Misery
usw. 
Metall/Rock mit Krieger- und Elfenstimmen, passt. :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seitdem Update, welches ein Zusammenspiel zwischen Quest und Steam ermöglicht, ist das Spiel nur noch bedingt zu empfehlen. Jetzt gibt es zwar jede Menge Spieler, aber sehr, sehr viele die das Gameplay missbrauchen. Durch falsche Anwendung der Controller, können sie extrem schnell schießen - über das gewöhnliche Maß hinaus. Ein Boss ist damit innerhalb von Sekunden erledigt, wo man gewöhnlich schon ein wenig Anstrengung braucht, um ihn zu besiegen. Mit anderen Worten, auf diese Weise ist das Spiel extrem langweilig. Mit fester Gruppe - okay. Mit etwas Glück, niemanden in einer öffentlichen Gruppe zu haben, der so spielt - auch okay. Muss man also selbst wissen, ob man nur in festen Gruppen spielen mag, oder sich ewig auf die Suche nach einer Partie begibt, in welcher sogenannter ""Maschinengewehrmissbrauch"" nicht stattfindet.

Además las hitbox de los personajes es cualquier cosa, jugando pvp hay varias flechas que tendrían que matar al enemigo pero lo atraviesan como si estuviese hecho de aire.

El juego ni siquiera tiene modo historia!

Mil veces mejor el juego de arco y flecha de ""The Lab"" que es gratuito, la única ventaja de éste es que se puede jugar coop.

Thank you for your feedback.
We apologize for the late response.

Due to the fact that Oculus Quest does not have as much power as PC, creating a consistent crossplatform between these versions has become quite a challenge.
Our team is still working on this subject and trying to find a good solution.
Nevertheless, as of today, I can't promise if such a crossplatform will be developed and if so, what form it will take.

Moreover, multiplayer also offers a more dynamic deathmatch PvP mode in which you can compete with other players instead of cooperating with them.

Quite honestly, I don't think it would have met my expectations even back when the HTC Vive first launched, much less in 2021. It feels very thrown together and ""tech demo-y"" rather than a full fledged, thought out game. The biggest problem is that is is incredibly repetitive. Each level is 1 or more ships arriving full of enemies, who then exit on the beach and make their way to your gate. Later levels may have more ships and more enemies, but they're the same enemies level after level after level. Other than an axe throwing Orc thrown in every now and then, none of the enemies pose any threat at all other than their ability to reach your gate. They don't attack you, they don't move in different ways, they don't take cover or randomize their paths, they don't change their behavior at all. Once you've seen one level, you've seen them all because virtually nothing changes after 40 minutes of play. It's just more and more of the same. It feels like a very early tower defense mobile game, just ported to VR. Then, there is the problem of the bow mechanics. The bow ""feels"" fine, but the game mechanics reward poor play and punish realistic archery. You can quickly pull the string back a few inches and let go and it works just as well as if you held the bow and drew back as you would in real life. Sure, the game gives you a bonus for headshots, but the reward is so little that it's not worth bothering, because you're much better spamming dozens of arrows as quickly as possible instead. So the entire thing devolves into trying to quickly shoot a barrage of arrows, rather than spending the time to shoot skillfully. Also, somehow wooden arrows can destroy the wooden ships that enemies arrive on. Not sure how that makes any sense, but it's how the game works. Other than shooting the enemies, there is literally nothing else to do in the levels. Even Valve's tech demo of Longbow had options of shooting oil cauldrons and exploding barrels, but I found nothing like that here. Eventually you earn points and/or gold that you can use to buy spells to make your attacks stronger or new bows and helms to change your appearance. However, this system is implemented poorly. You don't get to actually spend any of your earned points/gold until after you fail a level or quit. So you can easily play for 45 minutes doing the exact same thing over and over with zero reward. The game should have implemented a system every 5 levels to allow you to change your abilities. Additionally, the different helms do nothing at all. They are purely for appearance and nothing more.

The gaming of the shooting system combined with repetitive and uninteresting enemies, boring levels, and nonsensical mechanics make this game not worth the time spent to download it. It could be good, but needs a lot of improvements to even reach the level of free tech demos created 5 years ago.",1629064565,1629064565,False,12,0,0.652277112007141113,0,True,False,True,False,,1629204692.0,"Hi!

Otherwise, continue to read my script down below. https://youtu.be/Gsnk-NtU458 [/b]

[b] The Good Stuff [/b]

This archery tower defense-style game has you shooting arrows into various enemy types who approach your main castle gates.

The objective is simple, and you're role is to kill the enemy before they reach the gate. If they go through the gate, your castles health goes down, and once it reaches zero it is game over. Elven Assassin has a single player mode, or you can group with up to 3 other players to help you survive each wave of enemies. Waves become progressively more difficult, and later waves start to introduce more difficult enemy types.

[b] Mechanics [/b]

If we talk about the mechanics, the shooting feels great. Drawing your bow felt much better than a game like Holopoint, because you don't have to reach back as far to grab your arrow. Outside of shooting, you have access to your spell menu when you draw your bow and point your thumb-stick in the direction of the spell you wish to select.

[b] Game Aspects [/b]

You level up as you play, and unlock spell abilities as you progress. The abilities are pretty neat, and they work well. But I personally wish they felt more epic, because most of them have weak animations and felt a bit lackluster due to this.
In the map, there are blue zones which you can shoot to teleport you to that location, to get a different perspective when shooting. As you kill enemies, some will drop gold, which you can use to purchase cosmetic items. The only chocies are helmets and bows. There are a few enemy types, and some enemies will throw axes at you. You can dodge the axe by moving physically, or you can use an ice barrier ability to bring up a dome, to shield you from incoming axes.

Outside of the tower defense game mode, there's also PVP. PVP is ok... The biggest flaw I saw in PVP is that you can see your opponents names above their heads, which makes them easy to spot and shoot. PVP doesn't add anything new or interesting, but it's nice to have, I guess..

[b] The Bad Stuff [/b]

Okay, so some of the flaws I found in Elven Assassin is that you get barely any gold when killing enemies. I understand they want to keep you coming back to play the game longer, but I've become bored with the game long before I was able to unlock any appealing cosmetic items.

Speaking of boredom, the waves of enemies progress very, very slowly, and things don't get difficult until wave 30 when you play with others. By the time wave 30 hits, you've already been playing for 30-45 minutes and are exhausted from shooting. This game desperately needs to speed things up. Most people only play 30 minutes to an hour, and when the first 30 minutes of Elven Assassin is so boring, it doesn't make me want to play it at all.
There are many ways to fix this, and the simplist solution that I can think of without changing too much, is to add an option to start the game at later waves, so you can skip the boring stuff.

I also think more robust spell abilities would help the game drastically. What is limiting the developers from creating massive fireballs raining down from the sky, or giant tornadoes sweeping the enemies away... This is a video game, and in VR there are so many amazing possibilities in a fantasy game such as Elven Assassin... but instead, we are left with boring animations and spells which look and feel weak.

Even if they added something as simple as exploding barrels you can shoot at strategic points would be a nice addition. A free game like The Lab offers these aspects, but for some reason, things like this were left out in Elven Assassin.

Gaming is about having fun, and VR is about being in awe... and unfortunately, Elven Assassin doesn't bring either of these to the table.

[b] Is It Worth It? [/b]

Elven Assassin is an older VR title, and it shows. This doesn't mean it's bad, but the devs could have done a lot more over the years to keep the game interesting and more engaging.

Overall, Elven Assassin just needs more.. More enemy types, more cosmetic items, more spells and abilities, more game types, and more things to keep me interested in playing. Once you've played for 30 minutes to an hour, you've experienced everything there is to do, which isn't much.

I'm glad they recently introduced a new map and a PvP game mode, but it's too little too late. This is definitely a game I'd recommend you pick up on sale, because there just wasn't enough to keep me interested for the price.

It also offers a PvP deathmatch mode, which is a bit more dynamic than the classic game.

We hope you will give Elven Assassin a second chance.

But read the rest before making a decision.

Playing this with a friend, partner, or any other group is fun. The gameplay is simple and the progression is exciting earlier on. Getting kills feels pretty satisfying. Wave mode is unfortunately the only co-op gamemode so don't expect any sort of long-term content, but that's ok in my opinion (for a VR game).

Now let's talk about the rest...

The graphics are a bit of a let down. You'll notice in the screenshots that there is ""light bloom"", ""depth of field"", and ""radial blur"" used. None of these shaders are in the game. The ingame graphics are as close to default Unity as you can get. I don't know if this is necessarily false advertising but it is a disappointment to not see these sorts of shaders as at least optional ingame features. The actual 3D models you see seem like they were all bought off the asset store or done by someone who's perhaps a bit inexperienced with 3D art. It's not *bad* but it's not *good*. Compared to other VR games, well at least they AREN'T floating rectangles. There are parts of the visuals that feel almost insulting. You might notice the orcs look like they've all come from a twin factory and sprayed with different colors (red, green, and pale green). On the winter level it looks like the orcs have been sprayed with white paint.

The music is more or less non-existent. The music you can hear is uninspired and sounds generic. Not *bad* but again, not *good*.

The sound effects aren't bad actually! You may be surprised to see that they polished the sound effects quite a bit. Arrows hitting water make an actual water sound. Hitting wood makes a different sound. You can shoot a bell in the ""human town"". It feels like they put a lot of attention on sound effects in this game. Drawing the bow back further increases the pitch of the arrow release sound to make it feel a bit more polished. It's nice to see some attention to detail sprinkled in.

Finally let's talk about gameplay. I want to open up with a clear understanding that this was made by someone/someones who maybe lacks some game design experience. An example of this is that you can shoot lamps and they fall in one level, but in another level they remain static when shot. Just a lot of these strange inconsistencies throughout. Bowls/Pots are placed around that explode when shot on one level but then the next level is absolutely barren. The core of it is ""wave starts"", you ""shoot orcs"", sometimes there are moments where you ""shoot big enemies"", and you just do this until you run out of health which is deducted when enemies enter whatever you're defending. It seems like the developers caught onto the fact that this alone would be very boring so luckily we've been blessed with a RPG-ish skill system. You get 4 skills (pick from 10 of them) which you can put up to 10 points into each. Upgrading skills reduces cooldown and about half the abilities are totally useless. On top of all this you get gold for killing enemies which you can spend to buy new gear! But wait...

The progress isn't what you would expect. 10,000 gold for an armor set? I wonder what it does? More damage? Maybe my bow shoots straight over a longer distance? I mean it took me 15 hours of gameplay, surely I am to be rewarded. None of it. It's purely cosmetic. This means the only progression you get is the skill system. Level 100 and forward, you've already finished the game. There is no motivation for you as a player to continue playing besides achievements (I ran into a level 300+ player who password spammed his way into my lobby and I asked him why he still played, he said achievements).

Lastly let's talk about updates to this very long-winded early access game. I bought this game in early 2020 and didn't see an update for an entire year. Not a big deal of course but if you are hoping to get lost in what ""appears"" to be a really rich gaming experience, this is not that and won't ever be as long as the games core progression remains the same. The updates addressed some QoL issues and added 2 maps that are intended (or really are only fun/playable) for parties of 4.

So should you buy this?
If you want another fun VR game for you and friends, then yes absolutely. If you are hoping to get lost in a deep diving game experience, no. There are very few VR games that have actual depth and this is no exception.

I've forgot to mention that the one thing this game really does have going for it... Relative to all the other archery games on Steam? This one is certainly the best.",1612666945,1614070891,True,7,0,0.603914260864257813,10,True,False,True,False,,1612783359.0,"Hi. 

We realize that it has been a long time since we had a major update to our game. However, we want to assure you that we have not abandoned our game and we are still working hard on new updates. One of them is almost ready and should be released in the next few days/weeks. 

I know it's not much of a consolation since you're already waiting a long time, but I assure you there's plenty to look forward to. I hope that when the update is released, you will come back to our game and change your mind about it.

There are some game genres that have really shown themselves to be natural fits for VR, and archery is one of them. Elven Assassin gets it right.

This isn't a fancy game. It's independently produced, and there aren't a lot of bells and whistles. There are a handful of stages and two ways to play - Arcade, which is just regular archery; and RPG, which adds some tactical spells to the mix. The hub can be a bit irritating, especially if your space is small. These are nit-picks, though, and should not keep you from trying Elven Archer.

This is a tower defense experience where you are the tower. You can teleport between set points on the map for better views, but you don't move freely. Orcs come in waves. You shoot them. Sometimes they throw axes back at you and you have to duck. Sometimes there's an ogre. Sometimes there are flying drakes. Sometimes there is a huge dragon and if you're not paying attention he will mess you up.

Elven Archer shines in multiplayer, where you can team up to cover all your angles. My wife and I have spent a lot of time in there, and we come back to it often.

It didn't take me long to refund this game. It felt very bland and outdated with quality comparable to a free Engine demo/showcase. Looks so alpha-like you would think everything is just a placeholder (models, animations, effects, text) but they're not. The level of quality and polish I was given is not something I would expect in a game already four years in Early Access.

Animations are very monotonous. Only one death/hit animation for monsters as far as I noticed, and little variety in everything (models, animations, sounds, effects). The first few rounds were enough for me and I felt repetitiveness from the get go, which is a bad sign. The game didn't offer anything to counteract the repetitiveness like other seemingly repetitive games, commonly seen in tower defenses, rogue-likes, and dungeon crawlers.

Finally, the bow mechanics isn't really intuitive, you don't get the feeling that you're an elven archer. Something feels off that I can't quite pinpoint. Kills aren't satisfying and hits have no weight to them.

One thing's for sure, Even Valve's The Lab's tower defense mini-game (a free game nonetheless), and NVIDIA Funhouse's archer mini-game (a free game too) both felt better to play.",1609410530,1609505773,False,8,1,0.577409744262695313,1,True,False,True,False,,1609769122.0,"Hi! 
Thank you for the time you took to write your review. 
We are sorry that you did not like Elven Assassin. 

The game may seem repetitive at first sight, but this is not entirely true. There are various spells to unlock, skins to buy with in game gold and multiplayer with Coop PvE and more dynamic PvP modes. With the successive waves, the game becomes quite a challenge. 

As far as archery is concerned, it is possible to switch on ""Arrow hand offset"" which changes the way the bow behaves in the player's hand. Besides that, we are going to add even more maps, new mechanics, and interesting enemies to the game.

We recommend you to try out the multiplayer mode which has more to offer. There you can participate in Coop up to 4 players or compete in PvP deathmatch mode.

In addition, in the upcoming updates, we plan to expand our game with additional content such as new maps.

[b]Not recommended[/b]
Since the developers responded to my review I tried the game once more but my opinion has not changed. While I'm happy to hear the game is still being worked on, I would say the direction should be towards polishing what is already there instead of adding new maps and enemies.

[h3]The good[/h3]
[list]
[*]It's a tower defense with archery after all and the shooting mechanics have been done nicely enough. But that's all there is to it really.
[/list]

[h3]The bad[/h3]
[list]
[*]From the get-go, there is no option to move freely in the menu room. You have to manually rotate and point the trigger to predetermined locations to get there. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341801978]Screenshot[/url]
[*]There is some little interaction with the objects implemented but the fingers do not move. I have vive wands and usually the trigger moves the index finger and the grip moves the rest. But here the hand just snaps to the objects directly. Even then, the hand animations glitch into each other and sometimes I could see my wand model with the hand, and sometimes both open and close hand at the same time. This is the polish that is still needed for this game. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341802085]Screenshot[/url]
[*]The game has 3 maps. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341801863]This[/url] is a screenshot of the first map. First thing that bothered me was that the waterfall did not have a high fps animation which kinda stands out. Nothing changes in the maps. At least some daytime, weather changes could add more variation. Imagine if the game had the option to change lighting based on time of the day. That would have been cool.
[*] The enemy types use very similar models with some added assets. A limit bit of color variation would be welcome. The running animation does not quite match the walking speed. It's stiff and unnatural.
[*] I felt like the waves for single player are actually designed to be played with multiple people. Before reaching wave 10 there was already running, flying enemies with a big one at the same time which was very difficult to handle for one player. So separate wave scaling for single player and multiplayer would make solo playing feel much better.
[*] While the archery mechanics are good enough, there is still room to improve. There could be the option to actually get each arrow out of a holster. Atm, for the big enemies you can just spam shots mindlessly. If the arrows did not regenerate in the hands, trying to get critical on their head would have beeen much more pleasant.
[*]I got 14 coins for clearing up to wave 9. The cheapest bow upgrade costs 200 and the most expensive one is 10'000 ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341801661]Screenshot[/url]). So do I have to play 700 rounds to unlock the best bow and helmet?! The grinds seems to have been miscalculated. Besides, the expensive upgrades are just recolorings of the same model which is just lazy.
[*] Honorary mention to the same font that is used in menus, announcements, kills, etc. without any kind of background and framing which feels like a placeholder.
[/list]

[h3]Verdict[/h3]
I could go on how cool ideas could make this a really fun tower defense game, but for a game that has been in early access for 4 years with little improvement I do not have much hope.
For the buyers, I would recommend looking elsewhere for a more polished and modern VR game unless they really wanna try that archery tower defense game with friends.
For the developer, I suggest rethinking what they could do with this game and spending more time on polishing what they have.

P.S. I managed to run the game without problems so thumbs up for that 👍

We are sorry that you did not like Elven Assassin.

I would like to assure you that the game is still being developed by our team. With the next updates we are going to add new maps and then new mechanics and interesting enemies. 

Besides, we recommend trying out the multiplayer mode. It offers Coop mode and a more dynamic PvP deathmatch.

As for game crashes, please contact us at support@wenklystudio.com. 
Send us your computer specification and version of your graphics card drivers. You can also describe exactly how the crash you are writing about looks. We would like to know at what point the game is crashing. Whether you are loading into the menu or maybe in the middle of the game. 
The more details you give us, the more efficiently we can solve the problem.

Thank you for your opinion. 
We are sorry that you did not like Elven Assassin. 

As for the bow, you might like the ""Arrow hand offset"" option. 
Thanks to it, the bow behaves a little differently. 

We also highly recommend trying out the multiplayer mode. 
It offers a coop and PvP deathmatch mode. 
Thanks to these modes the game gains more depth and gives a lot of fun. 

Also, I want to assure you that our game is constantly being developed and updated. We plan to expand the game with new content such as new maps and enemies. 

I would also like to ask you about the bugs you mentioned.

Also, nochmal gegooglet(schreibt man das so?) aber nichts gefunden. Naja, schreib ich ne Email, hab ich mir gedacht. Gedacht, getan. Danach wurde ich aber etwas ungeduldig und hab's Spiel nochmal angemacht. Hab mir die Spells-Seite nochmal angeguckt und siehe da, da steht auch irgendwo beschrieben wie man die Spells benutzen kann. Hab dann nochmal ein singleplayer Spiel gestartet und es funktionierte.

Thank you for your feedback. 

When it comes to controlling Elven Assassin with Valve Index, spells are assigned to the stick of the left controller. If you want to use spells with a trackpad, you can try to assign keys on SteamVR. Unfortunately, this is currently the only solution I can suggest.

We also recommend trying out the multiplayer mode. It offers co-op and dynamic PvP deathmatch. 

We hope, that you will give our game a second chance.

4- The feel of the aiming/shooting mechanics feels very unsatisfying. ""Quest and Index"". I prefer Valve's longbow game and even Rec Room feels better.

Thank you for that opinion. 
We are sorry that you are not happy with Elven Assassin. 

Cross-platform between PC and Oculus Quest is not yet supported due to the hardware limitations of Oculus Quest. We are working on a solution to this problem, but I can't say when we will be able to solve it. Elven Assassin supports crossplay between Oculus Rift S and Steam for the time being. 

As for the variety of gameplay, Elven Assassin also offers PvP deathmatch mode which is much more dynamic than classic wave shooter. We recommend trying it because it is a completely different kind of gameplay. 

As far as the difficulty of the game is concerned, you can unlock better and better spells with the level up, which definitely makes the game easier to play. 

As for the handling of the bow, the ""arrow hand offset"" changes the way the bow behaves. Changing this setting often helps players in the gameplay. 

We hope you will give Elven Assassin a second chance and change your mind about it.

I had been eyeing it for a while, but had kind of put it towards the bottom of my ""to get"" list.  I wish I had bought this sooner.  I am having such fun with this game that I can actually lose myself and suddenly six or seven hours have gone by...

The things I like about this game:

1.) The graphics and models are really great
2.) The levels are very cool and very detailed.
3.) The bow mechanics are really well done.
4.) Co-op multiplayer is a lot of fun if you can find an unlocked game (more on that later).
(EDIT): 5.) This is fantastic exercise.  I have actually started playing this with weights on my wrists.  

My complaints or things that I wish would improve (hopefully some of these will be addressed as development continues):

1.) I wish there were more playable levels other than the 3-4 that are already there.
2.) The equipment upgrades are neat, but pointless other than for cosmetics.  It would be nice if the equipment and bow upgrades actually did something to improve your character in some way --- let you take an extra axe before you die, decrease spell recharge time, increase arrow damage, give you additional skills, etc.  
3.) Leveling doesn't seem to do much other than give you an additional spell point and specify to other players how long you have been playing the game (I played a co-op with someone who was level 204 the other day).  
4.) As already mentioned, co-op is a blast provided you can find a game to play in.  Most people lock their games and I understand the reason for allowing people to lock games, so this may just be more of a complaint about the general anti-socialness of the community playing this game.  But, it's really annoying when all you see on co-op is a bunch of locked game when they all have room for 1-2 more people to join.  If you can find an open game, though, all the people playing are really fantastic, really nice, and this game is a great way to meet people.  
5.) When a multiplayer game ends, it takes FOREVER for the game to give you the option to restart the game, so if you do find a good group of people to play with, you immediately lose them at the end of the game as they go in search of other open games because it is faster to quit and rejoin multiplayer than it is to wait for someone to restart the game.  Be nice if this could be sped up A LOT.
6.) I have a problem getting my mic to work with this game.  I could easily see this one being on me and my computer, but I will mention it here since I am complaining. (EDIT): This was a HMD issue unrelated to the game that was fixed.
7.)  I wish there was an option to rotate the camera.  As I move to different towers, some of the towers are oriented such that they make me face in directions that are not as well covered by my VR sensors.  Did my best to re-setup my environment to fix this issue, but sometimes there is only so much you can do.  This would not have been an issue if there was an option to rotate the camera in the game.    
(EDIT): 8.) The devs on this game are terrible.  They are more interested in putting new features in the newer Quest version of this game than they are in actually finishing this game which has been around WAY longer.  That says these guys are more interested in a quick buck than doing a good job on what would be a solid game.  Game is great, devs not so much.  
(EDIT): 9). There is an un-godly long wait between waves, especially at the higher ones.  This has been an issue for months now (since the last ""recent"" update) with zero response or fixes from the devs.  Expect to be standing around for a bit once you get good at this game.  

Overall, great game!  Very fun, and very good exercise.  I would like to see some of the issues I mentioned be addressed/improved, but despite my complaints I think this game is solid and worth getting, even at full price.

We are sorry to hear that you are not completely satisfied with Elven Assassin.

For now, cross-play only works between Steam and the Oculus Rift version. Oculus Quest has a separate version of Elven Assassin due to its hardware limitations. We plan to enable cross-play between all platforms in the future, but we can't say when this will happen. 

If you want to play together right now, the person who uses the Oculus Quest must connect it via Oculus Link to his/her computer and buy Elven Assassin on Steam or Oculus Rift. 

In addition, on future Sunday at 9 AM PST, there will be PvP deathmatch training tournaments with cross-play enabled, so maybe then you will try to play together. The actual tournament with $1000 prize pool will take place on September 12th and 13th.

Valve should partner with these guys directly because they got the right idea for an addictive VR game! The possibilities of ""what could be"" are quite endless. 

A few notes:
Magic: Makes a world of difference. A cool idea would be to have poison or bio magic. Something like a standard poison arrow, a AOE poison, a slow arrow, multi-poison arrow, etc. 

Equipment: Equipment with actually elements embedded into them would be neat. For instance, the Ice set gives ice elements. 

A quick start at a higher level once you achieve past a certain rank/level would be cool addition.

A lot of fun and I'm excited to see what maps they create and new enemies: maybe little goblins that run extremely fast or enemies that heal other enemies. I feel this is the closest thing to a 4-player tower defense game!

Thank you for your feedback. 
Sorry to hear you had an unpleasant experience with our game. 

The problem you described looks like you were killed by an orc axe or a dragon. It seems like you were playing multiplayer mode where you have to wait until the next wave or until the player uses a revive spell on you after you die. In order not to die from the axe you have to dodge it or block it with the Ice Shield spell. If you were so kind as to describe exactly what it looked like, we would appreciate it. 

Also, you've mentioned some difficulties with the bow aiming - have you tried the ""Arrow offset"" option from in-game settings? Moreover, since then the game has got some changes and we plan to add a lot of new content in the future so maybe you should give a try to our game once again!

Хотите почувствовать себя лесным эльфом? Кстати вы знали, что средняя продолжительность жизни лесных эльфов 700 лет. А самые старшие из них доживают до 1200 лет. Так вот, в этой реальности вы будете, например, девятьсот летним эльфом! И будете защищать свой замок и свой народ от нашествия орков и летающих драконов! А если тебе сложно справиться одному, то ты можешь собрать совет лесных эльфов и выбрать себе соратников для борьбы с превосходящим вас противником! В общем играй один или с друзьями! А весь смысл игры — это отбить волну наступающего на вас противника стреляя из лука. На первой волне сложности вы не почувствуете, а проходя всё дальше и дальше, вы столкнётесь с полчищами орков, и некоторые из них будут бросать в вас оружие, от которых вам нужно будет уворачиваться. Так же вы столкнетесь с гигантскими боссами, которые могут вас убить, и вам придется перемещаться от одного укрытия к другому! Так что, скучать вам точно не придется! Игра очень лёгкая в управлении, поэтому даже ребёнок с 7 лет может спокойно разобраться и встать с вами плечом к плечу в борьбе против агрессора! Во время игры вы можете зарабатывать деньги, которые вы можете потратить на новый набор доспехов или оружие. И опыт, который вы можете потратить на различного рада магического улучшения, например замораживающая, огненная стрела или взрывающая стрела!
А если вы истребите всех орков, то сможете устрить турнир против друг друга!
Сюжета в игре нет, здесь вы будете просто получать море удовольствия от геймплея! Графика и звуковое сопровождение радуют глаз и слух!

Wave-based, bow-shooter combat. Stop the orcs, trolls, and more from breaching the walls and stealing your women! It's a tower defense style game, where you're a tower!

[*]Loads of fun as a bow-and-arrow fanatic
[*]Multiplayer
[*]Unlockables to increase power and style
[*]Great arm workout![/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1][list]
[*]Can really hurt if your arms aren't used to it
[*]Can get repetitive after you play a bit

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
[code]8/10 - Out of all the bow and arrow games, I think this one takes the cake for me. I enjoyed the wave-based combat with a friend and always trying to top our last record.

Thank you for that comment.
Sorry to hear you didn't quite like our game. 

To avoid being stunned you have to squat, lean to the side, or block it with an Ice Shield spell by using it on the floor. It creates a protective ice shield that destroys any axe that comes in contact.

If you feel bored playing the single player mode, you should try the multiplayer which offers co-op and PvP deathmatch. Besides, in the future, we are going to add more content such as catapults and new maps. 

If you want to know more, check out Elven Assassin on Facebook or Discord!

The content of the game is extremely limited. but it is kind of fun in its own way. The game feels like a mini game in a normal game. Lots of improvements needed.

 I would like to give you just a few examples out of many of the basic mechanics that the game is missing.

 You cannot report or vote a player out and the private rooms have only two digit passwords. So basically anyone can enter your game with trial and error and stay there if they like to. Imagine you are at a very high wave and someone comes  in and blocks your vision on purpose the whole game (This actually happened)

No sense of achievement. The whole point of the game  is to clear waves and reach to a wave as high as you can. But you cannot even unlock any achievements or get any rewards  for the waves you reached. The game gives you no motivation to progress further. All you do is to get in kill a few orcs and get out.

All the waves are basically the same. 4 types of enemies, Orc, wywern, giant and a dragon . As you progress, only the number of creatures and the their health go up.

No friendlist or any other way to keep contact with the players you played on public. No statistics at all, so you essentially have no idea what other players are up to. I mean nothing promotos you to do more than shooting a few arrows and leaving the game anyway. So that is not a suprise.


Imagine a very basic java game you played on browser. This game is at the same exact level but on vr. I cannot argue base of the game is fun but as I said. let alone any complicated or any advanced mechanics, this game is lacking the most basics.",1579513310,1579537574,False,3,0,0.546776533126831055,0,True,False,True,False,,1598519895.0,"Hi!

Thank you for your feedback. 
We are sorry, you're not quite happy with Elven Assassin. 

Please note that our game is still in early access and we are making every effort to develop it. In the future, we want to add more maps and with them more content. There’ll be more mechanics like new catapults, challenging enemies, and maps for up to eight players! 

Also you have mentioned problems with two digit passwords. We will discuss this issue with the team. 

Achievements, for now, are more about shooting than reaching a certain point in the game, but we will also discuss this. 

Please consider checking back the game one day and share with us your current opinion.

If you could provide us with more information on what you feel was wrong with the bow/aiming mechanic we would be happy. That way we can improve in the future.

Yes, you can play a beta branch for Index but

2) you can't open your spell menu to cast skills!

Thank you for that comment. 
We apologize for the late response. 

We feel sorry that you are not completely satisfied with our game, but I have good news for you. Since you wrote this comment a bit has changed. Valve index is already supported and the spell menu is working properly. Moreover, we changed visuals, improved performance, and made networking more stable.

Also, we plan to add more maps, enemies and mechanics in the future. 
If you want to see a little preview of what will get into the game, check out the Elven Assassin profile on Facebook.

Maybe you can give Elven Assassin a second chance?

Thank you for your opinion! 

Since you published the comment, we have improved visuals, performance, and network stability. 

When it comes to using the bow, maybe you should try to adjust the ""arrow hand offset"" option.

As for the content, we have good news for you! New maps will be added to the game, which can accommodate up to eight players. Along with them, new interesting mechanics will be added to refresh the game. Stay tuned!

Thank you for your feedback. 

We are currently working on making the gameplay more interesting. We are planning to add new maps and unique mechanics related to them. 
Is there anything you would like to see in the game? We would be very grateful if you would share your ideas! 

Also, we recommend trying the multiplayer mode, where you can choose between co-op and more dynamic PvP deathmatch.

For you gals, some of the best players are the ladies.

This is the VR game I play for multiple reasons:  Terror; Immersion; Exercise; and, fun with other people.  
I scream with agony when killed by an axe from an Orc---the immersion is so real.  In the co-op game, you really feel a part of a team effort.  Others rely on you and I count on others as they revive me when I become the dead “Axe Collector” or the ashen “Dragon’s Toast.”

We own 25 VR games.  This is always the one we turn to first. It is a workout and is flat out addictive.  Additionally, besting my husband is great fun.

The bow mechanics are great and practice makes perfect. If you see bad reviews by players who invested an hour or two---ignore them—they died quickly and soured because they did not have the needed skills.  Go read reviews by EagleEye, Gusphan, Lunalove, and Permanoob; and, hope to get to play with those magnificent Orc killers. 

I was never a gamer until now. When first introduced to this game, I died a great deal; it was enormous fun, but death was just around the corner. After 3 elven Assassin games, I requested my own computer, headset, and Steam account. Now, I play for 2 to 3 hours at time and keep coming back for more fun.  

Besides the exciting game play, I have great conversations with guys and gals from around the world, in the early rounds.  The game gets pretty intense as you progress past round 50. Past round 81, strap on your “big gal” pants because terror, sweat, and arm weariness rule each round---the Dragons, Giants, and Orcs seem endless.

My hat is tipped to the developers. The visuals and sound effects are tremendous. Additionally, these developers answer comments and suggestions provided by the players and continue to improve the game. Thank you Wenkly Studios.

The game is your basic tower defense with several different settings to choose from. Defeat wave after wave after wave of Orcs, the occasional Ogre and Dragon by shooting them with arrows. Shoot enough, get some gold, get a better bow, add some spells to your arrows, shoot some more.

Everything is done competently enough. But there is just not much there and not much reason to invest time in it beyond beating your own high score.
It’s a typical tower defense archery game. The graphics are on the realistic side but there are only a few types of enemy and the animations are all the same and less then inspiring in that you feel like you a shooting a tiny arrow into a large orc because of the weak hit animation. Yes, animation singular. Doesn’t matter where you hit them they are going to react the exactly the same way every time. Makes it feel very shallow and not exactly visceral. And that shallowness extends to the sound too. Just the same thing every time ad nauseum.
The only character progression is the unlocking of spells for your arrows. Your character does rank up with play but it doesn’t appear to have any affect on the power of your shots. You also earn gold that you can use to buy better looking equipment but again it’s just cosmetic. You can upgrade the spells but all that does is lower the cooldown time. Still it’s the only character progress you have so better than nothing I guess.
The bow handling is okay. The trajectory seems too flat and doesn’t seem to change enough with angle and range which makes it feel a bit unrealistic but it’s still fun. I don’t like how the arrows magically appear in your hand with the push of a button. I prefer the QuiVR scheme where you at least have to reach to your shoulder like you pulling an arrow from a quiver. But the ‘instant’ arrows are not unique to this game.
I’ve played the single player quite a bit and can reach the low 20’s by myself but the lack of progression has kept me from investing too much time or even checking out the multiplayer. If I want a one off experience I find Longbow to be more fun and frantic and the leaderboards work. And if I want to feel like I’m investing the time in my character I’ll play QuiVR as at least there is better equipment to unlock and the gameplay itself has more variety and depth. 
Bottom line is that’s it's too shallow to reccomend when there are better options out there.

- Make some of the Orcs come out to a certain spot and just KEEP throwing Axes at you  until they die.  Right now they feel like drones the way they walk and then stop for one second to throw an axe and then keep right on going.  Make a few of them out for blood and have them just attack and not be so concerned with getting to the gate.

- Maybe give some of the Orcs a Shield?  Would be easy art-wise... and maybe these guys either have to be killed with a headshot only.. OR hit from behind.

Areas for improvement:
1. Seems like the multiplayer community is really small - I've only ever seen maybe 10-20 players online at once before. Sometimes not even enough for one game server. 
2. It's really repetitive - you need to grind a lot. It could take hours in one game to beat your old record of number of waves passed. It's just the nature of the game I guess
3. Bow mechanics are a bit clunky. They aren't bad, but I find it hard to shoot fast. Aiming is ok. 
4. There are much better bow games. I haven't played all of them. I can recommend In Death, and I especially like Rec Room for the quests like Golden Trophy and Crimson Cauldron - the bow action in those is amazing and it's free!

Positives:
1. I do feel like playing this once in a while. 
2. If you like tower defense, you might like this
3. If you like grinding through wave after wave of enemies, shooting them with bow and arrow you might like this. 
4. There are definitely people who are serious about this game and have spent hundreds of hours

Thanks for the honest opinion. We really appreciate it. So to let you know - VR player base is still small although as for now Elven Assassin is having a solid player base comparing to other multiplayer games.

As the game has Tower Defense style the main core is to defend upcoming waves - we understand that for some of the players it may be not interesting that much. 
About the shooting speed - we saw players spraying arrows so maybe it depends on the headset which you are using or the shooting technique.

Besides that, it's good to hear some good words from you about the game. Opinions like this help us a lot.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is mediocre at best. The oculus support is poor unless you have a 360 set up (DEVS: Add 1/4 turning!!) as most towers you can stand in will have you facing a wall. Towers where you face the right way however are ok.

The game is poor. The enemies are boring, the single player is boring and not catered for 1 person. The graphics are average, the progression is boring. However it is fun in multiplayer even with randoms.

The fact that after 2 years of development this is where it is at leaves little to be desired. Get it on sale, I got it for £8 on sale and feel like I overpayed.

The reason this is a recommended review is because despite it's many and obvious flaws, it is still fun for a small blast at times.
----------------------------------

Now, almost a year later. OCULUS SUPPORT!

BUT NO QUARTER TURNING AND THEY SOMEHOW FUCKED UP CONTROLLER ALIGNMENT.

But hey, at least we have tournaments and colourful armour.

Editing after getting buddy that's also into real life archery into game. This is our new favorite CO-OP VR game to play! With at least 2 people it's now possible to defend areas where eventually becomes impossible due to growing swarms in Single Player. There are a few glitches (ie arrows passing thru enemies but not killing them occasionally, dancing ballerina Trolls, etc) but none of these are game ending. In game COMM's is horrible and honestly they should just let that part go. But if you get on with TS / Discord easily worked around! Hard to believe this is still EA with how good game is now!
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This should be called Elven Archery Exercise because I was sweating after few rounds! This is pretty much what you wished ""The LAB"" Archery mode was all about. Same basic concept but much, much better graphics and you can teleport around to change your shooting position. THIS GAME iS DESIGNED FOR VR ROOM SET UP WITH MINIMUM DIMENSIONS AND STORE PAGE REALLY SHOULD SAY THIS!! This is so you can duck and weave from attacks. 

This is begging to be multi-player as single player it's almost impossible to cover all the paths the invading Orcs take to get to your village. I have not tried it in Multi-player yet...but it's challenging in single player. There are Boss monsters (Giant Troll, dragon, etc) that change up the mix. Unlike most VR Archery games, this 1 also fights back (ie  Orcs that throw axes at your sniping positions, fire breathing dragos, etc) so there are level ending threats to your archer as well as the invasion of your village / city. 

The bow and arrow controls are MUCH better than most games that are already out of Early Access. For the folks I've seen in the Games forums having trouble...try looking at the game's setting option? There are ways to modify how your bow works. Most important to me was the draw is MUCH better than many games were you end up smacking controllers together in frustration to get dam arrow notched and drawn before you die. Simple notch and draw basically as fast as you can do it.

There are some game hanging bugs. Literally the 1st time tried to boot the game it hung up forever loading. Most of the bugs I've encountered you can fix by exiting back to SteamVR and then exiting the game. Then reload. There has only been 1 that caused me to exit VR and completely reload my Vive system.

Thank you for that comment! 

We are still developing the game and a lot has changed since then. We are currently working on new content that will definitely add variety to the game. We are planning new maps and interesting mechanics. 

Our player base is active and still growing, make sure to check all the regions (US/EU/Asia) while you are playing multiplayer games.

敵人會對玩家反擊，要一直閃躲+射箭

畫面可圈可點，飛龍和食人魔會跑到面前毆人，有點震撼感

這款遊戲可以連線合作，也能連線PVP，對戰的手感做得非常好，不管是射到人還是被射到
然後很奇妙的是：亞服非常多韓國人，不管進哪房都是聽到韓語，我到現在還沒聽過其他語言(包括中文英文)
而且極高比率妹子，是韓國妹子，有興趣還不快買來射一波？
連線相當穩定，到現在還沒有斷線的問題，語音也非常清晰流暢

當然也有缺點
我是使用Vive，弓箭右手指勾弦的部分有偏差，箭會搭在類似手把上方的位置，而不是手的位置
對於現實中有練習弓箭的人而言，卡暗卡點會導致射線偏下
這點請注意

除此之外沒什麼問題，也不會有甚麼空間限制問題
所以空間夠大，可以搬張椅子直接站出平台掌握至高點來射

This game just keeps getting better.  Buy this now. Join and enjoy playing co-op with an awesome set of fellow VR Orc slayers.  The new Ice Spells and Revive Arrow add cool features and novel attack strategies.  These developers really listen to the players and have done a great job.


UPDATE:  No one has the right to have this much fun. The multi-player mode is truly a gem.  Unbelievable fun and a workout---my Fitbit groans after ten minutes. You better be prepared to duck axes from every corner of the map. You need teamwork to get to the higher waves but it is such an enjoyable and addictive experience. OPT out of Betas to reliably find server games; but, Asia, Europe, or US---someone is always there or will join you shortly. You will need help if you want to live to fight the Orcs, defeat that fire breathing Mother of Dragons, the armored Giant, and the hordes of axe throwing Orcs.

Wow!!! What a game.  Buy it now, you will be pleased.
This is why I bought a WMR headset.---you are immersed and need to defend your castle---and yourself.
I move for better shots, I duck to save my life, and I sweat because it is hours of great exercise.
.......and my wife loves it.  She asks to play. And what an immersive experience for her—she never wants to lose at anything and truly panics in the face of death. Yesterday, she ducked an axe, lost her balance, felt like she was falling out of the tower---I barely caught her before she hit the floor.  Her only statement, ""get me up, I need to shoot, the dragon is coming.""
But it is about a bow and arrow challenge. And it is fun.  My other PC game addictions with bows and arrows are lonely.
Once the Orcs start coming, you fear being overrun: you fear the flying axe: you fear the giant; and, you absolutely fear that fire breathing dragon. He burns me every time; I will get him soon!!
As the challenge levels rise, you cannot waste arrows, so you need to prioritize your targets or be overwhelmed.  Each time my castle is burned to the ground by the hordes, I swear to do better, and start again.
I tried multi-player when I was just starting. I apologize to the team I joined but they were amazing at guarding me and annihilating the attackers.  I have not found active US servers in the last 2 days so it miss that a bit but this game is fun just for single player action and the exercise value.
To the development team:  Thanks so much for your efforts, I have not had this much gaming fun in years.  And imagine, you have my wife playing and telling me what a good investment this WMR system is—I usually only hear that about purses or shoes.  As a minor comment, I think the arrow needs to line up on the other side of the bow BUT who cares, I have Orcs to kill!",1515424912,1537814677,True,5,1,0.566666662693023682,0,True,False,True,False,,,

For Oculus users, there are two versions: the Steam version and the Oculus store version. I own both, they both run with Oculus, and they are different. I've tried the game with both two sensors and four sensors. The Steam version is always more up-to-date and has more features. In order to describe the other differences, first we need to describe some game details.

In this game you play an elven archer represented by gloves, a bow and arrow, and a helmet, who mans several guardposts in front of a village. You defend the village from waves of Orcs and other creatures; it's tower defence. Every creature who breaks through (makes it to the village) counts against the village's HP, and you lose when the village has zero HP. Orcs and creatures spawn from various entry points, usually doorways or caves. Depending on where the Orcs are, how many are coming from each door, etc, different guardposts are better than others to defend the village.

In Elven Assassin, unlike in SteamVR Home, you can't teleport to just any spot in the navigable playspace, you have to physically walk there. There are multiple navigable playspaces (aka different platforms and towers) which you can teleport to, but your position in your real playspace determines your position in the virtual playspace. This game becomes way way easier if you can expand your real playspace, because a lot more firing angles become available. If your playspace is too small, you won't be able to fire around a wall, or shoot point blank straight down at enemies. This is true in both Oculus and Steam versions.

I found that the room I initially had my Oculus set up in was too small to get full enjoyment from this game. I moved my setup into the largest room in my house. When setting up your playspace boundaries, you may be tempted to ""fudge"" the edges, or try to get the largest possible area even though the Oculus software doesn't recommend your setup. When you get to the edges of this area, where the playspace is only covered by one sensor, you will lose tracking, especially if you are facing away from the sensor. I found out by accident that most games work fine when your sensors are not placed in the recommended configuration: you can put one sensor to the front and one sensor to the right for example. You still lose tracking sometimes, but you get a bigger area to play in, which means better angles; and you may lose tracking at different spots.

The direction you face is different. When you teleport to a different platform, you automatically face some direction. In the Steam version, this appears to be whatever direction you were previously facing (usually the wrong way). In the Oculus version, you are automatically re-pointed in the direction(s) the tower was intended to provide coverage over. So you can stay facing the Oculus sensors, which you want.

Additionally, in the Oculus version, you can use the Oculus menu ""Reset View in VR"" button to adjust both which direction is forward and where the center of the platform is located. ""Reset View in VR"" has no effect in the Steam version: I really miss the ability to recenter the platform: I can walk through a wall into a useless room, but I can't walk over to the edge of the roof and fire down at the Orcs as they march through the gate. Nor do I fully understand the particular playspace angles chosen in the Steam version. To summarize, in the Oculus version, you can change how the virtual playspace and the real playspace align; in the Steam version you can't.

One of the biggest differences between the two: the Steam version has more content and more updates. You can play both ""Elven Village"" and ""Human Village"" in Steam, but only ""Elven Village"" in Oculus. And the graphics seem respectably nicer in the Steam version. And the arrow mechanics are different (""improved"").

Available playspaces are highlighted with blue cylinders. You teleport to a playspace by firing an arrow at its blue cylinder. In the Oculus version, a well-aimed shot through the blue cylinder does not teleport me about 5-15% of the time. This is tolerable and I expect it now, but it does cost you a number of Orcs when the teleport is time critical.

In the Elven Village scenario, there are four platforms. The ""forward tower"", the ""high tower"", the center pagoda ""guardpost"", and the rear ""auxiliary"" tower. In the Steam version, the guardpost is a small ~5x5' platform in the center of everything, with a low fence around it (good for ducking behind, and firing shots through), and four corner pillars supporting a roof (the pillars are good for dodging behind to avoid axes). You have a clear view in every direction, at every spawning point, and also the only straight shot at the door (last ditch). In the Oculus version, the guardpost has a wooden wall on the ""forward"" side, and you are automatically oriented to face the gate (the ""rear""). You don't have a good shot in the forward direction, and if you step out around the edge of the guardpost wall to get one, you lose tracking. While the wall is nice because Orcs can't attack you through it, I prefer not having the wall. The other guardposts are largely unchanged.

Another minor difference is the Steam version ""laser pointer"" finger guides point at a really weird angle that probably makes sense for the Vive controller. This isn't a big deal for me though, things seems to work correctly in the game. And you have to click the thumbstick while choosing a spell, instead of just moving the thumbstick. And ""B"" is pause instead of ""Left Menu"". On the Oculus version (I didn't really check on the Steam version), the item descriptions contains some bad English.

All in all (hey devs!), I really wish I could recenter the playspace in the Steam version; And there are all these windows and rooms I wish I could go in (especially that one next to the ""auxiliary"" tower), but can't.

The devs do say that the Steam version doesn't officially support Oculus, and the game does only get the ""Vive"" badge from Steam, so I guess it isn't guaranteed the Steam version will work with Oculus, but it does work for me.

Using four sensors (and really, three, probably) makes rear tracking (360/room scale) reliable on the Oculus, although you always run into reduced tracking at the playspace boundaries (which I find myself hugging).

Despite the Steam version being better in almost every other way, I will recommend the Oculus version for two-sensor Oculus setups, and as something worth considering for setups with more than two sensors: don't underestimate the power of re-aligning your playspace!",1508309370,1508309370,True,2,0,0.530487775802612305,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Awesome work out
Realistic Feel
Graphics are really good
Multiplayer is awesome... if you find a game
Singleplayer is also great, you can see your body strength progress and skill progress each time you hop in.
You can purchase spells and level them up to decrease cooldowns which each bit helps as you progress.

Cons: 
It would be nice if the equipment you buy actually had stats instead of being just for looks. For example, orcs throw axes that you have to physically duck or avoid, it would be nice that if you were wearing the expensive gear maybe you only get disoriented for 3 seconds or something.

I came to tell you that since 2017 the game has undergone major changes. 

We have added more interesting content to the game and improved the graphics.  Moreover, the performance of the game is better and the multiplayer mode is much more fun! 
In the near future, we are going to add more maps and new enemies to the game.
 
We hope that you would like to try our game again.

Grundlegend:
Die Bedienung von Pfeil und Bogen geht sehr gut von der Hand, das Zielen ist einfach aber realistisch. Die Pfeile müssen nicht vom Rücken gezogen werden (was ich persönlich als positiv empfinde) sondern erscheinen automatisch in der Hand. Die Flugbahn ist schnell verinnerlicht.

Es gibt zwei spielbare Karten. Bei der ersten verteidigt man ein Elfendorf. Es gibt vier Punkte an denen man stehen kann und man wechselt durch einen Schuss auf den jeweiligen Punkt den Standort. Bei der zweiten Karte unterstützt man die Menschen in der Verteidigung einer Feste (erinnert ein wenig an Helms Klamm). Hier gibt es mehr Möglichkeiten bei der Verteidigung, denn es stehen auch Katapulte und Kanonen zur Verfügung. Diese Karte ist aber (noch) nicht so ausgewogen wie die erste.

Die Gegner bestehen aus Fantasy Wesen, die sich auch mal wehren (so werfen bspw. einige Orks nach einem Treffer eine Axt nach dem Schützen vor denen man sich ducken muss).

Während der Gefechte sammelt man Gold, das man in Ausrüstung stecken kann (nur kosmetischer Natur) und steigt Level auf, für die man wiederum Magie kaufen kann um so besondere Pfeile einsetzen zu können.

Der Einzelspieler ist recht schwierig, da man nach einigen Wellen schnell die Position wechseln und dazu noch sehr schnelle Folgen von Pfeilen los lassen muss um zu bestehen. Der Multiplayer spielt sich da ein gutes Stück einfacher und funktioniert ganz hervorragend. Selbst mit Random Mitspielern hält man einige Wellen lang durch. Wirklich gut funktioniert es, wenn man sich mit den Mitspielern absprechen kann. Leider ist auf den Europäischen Servern relativ wenig los (aber es sind eigentlich immer 1-2 Spiele gerade aktiv, wo man einsteigen kann). Auch während der Wellen ist das Spiel immer motivierend, da man sich jederzeit den Punktestand der 4 Spieler im Vergleich ansehen kann.

Das wohl direkteste Konkurrenzprodukt dürfte Quivr sein, das meines Erachtens im Moment etwas das Nachsehen hat, denn Elven Assassin bietet durch die zwei Karten, die Ausrüstung und das Magiesystem bereits einen hohen Wiederspielwert.

Man benötigt im Übrigen etwas Platz, denn es ist immer mal nötig sich zu bewegen (um auszuweichen oder einen besseren Winkel zu bekommen). 1,5x2m reichen aus.

Negativ bis jetzt:
- die ersten Wellen sind bei vier Spielern sehr langweilig, weil es zu wenige Gegner von zu wenigen Spawnpoints sind. Da prügelt man sich Anfangs quasi um die Abschüsse.
- Während ein Orc eine Axt wirft, ist er unverwundbar.

Für mich ist das Spiele eine ganz klare Kaufempfehlung und eines der Besten VR Spiele im Moment, vor allem für 10€. Mich bringt es gehörig ins schwitzen und es ist gerade mit seinen kurzen Runden ein ideales VR Spiel ohne anstrengend zu werden. Und wenn jemand einen Mitspieler für den Multiplayer sucht: einfach hinzufügen.",1495796218,1498301292,True,8,0,0.538775980472564697,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- extremely precise phisically based dragon-got-hit and (not only) falls to ground animations which are not repetetive
- Supersamling per advanced settings open VR without problerms (so far no in-game graph slider) - with my i6700K 980ti I reach 1.5
- additional scene in multiplayer mode is also accescible if there is no other player; this can also be played with rain added and includes heavy middleage wheapons
- Axes thrown at you and you must duck or step aside or do a quick estimation whether the axe would miss anyway/thrown at an obstacle ; all this with 3 D spatial audio of the rotating axe approaching ! very intense
- some moments of rest inbetween the waves because playing may become exhausting with some workout side effect

Dear developers, thank you a lot for this fine piece of work ! Maybe, sooner or later,  you could consider letting potential customers know of the beauty of the night level by providing a good video at the shopsite

For me 9/10 - the final point would come after some (randomy chosen ?) animation variety for the orcs

UPDATE: The dev are very savvy about updating accordingly to the thoughts and impressions of the customers.
And they are constantly delivering new beautiful maps, more dragons flying awesome nearby and much more.

The graphics look nice but the way the guys move and die just seems... off... Maybe they just don't move enough as they walk, or their animations are too slow for the distance, or the animations are meant for faster speeds or something. I really don't know. 

Apart from that clunkiness that I can't properly express, dodging the axes takes too much time. They move too slow and take import time away that I could be shooting. I have to dodge all too far out of the way to dodge them as well. Maybe make them throw vertical rather than horizontal and perhaps a bit faster with sound so we know it's coming? 

It's also just ""another wave shooter"" without a unique dynamic to set it apart. QuiVR has us chasing down gates to close and healing them with skill-based shooting. I felt no rewards from killing guys apart from making it to another round and saying ""yeah, I got to wave XX."" And then if I want to beat my score, I have to sit through another 30 minutes of waves 1 through XX. QuiVR has dynamic difficulty so it increases with your skill so you don't have to wait forever to get your challenge on.

I also didn't feel the need to move from place to place. The center seemed like the best spot with no great advantage in other locations yet it still had blind places where I couldn't shoot at the guys and had to simply wait. 

I also could not hear the guys coming from behind me. So while I'm busy shooting guys, I have no idea there's like 10 behind me. Unless, after every shoot, I look back. Perhaps I'd get used to it, but I want to involve more senses.

The uniqueness, mainly, is in the graphics of orcs and locale. Make it something more than a wave shooter and it could be great. I like elves, I like elven-looking territories, I like shooting a bow, but it's not enough to make me feel the presence.

Lastly, I just didn't feel like the aiming was right. It always seemed to shoot far more to the right than where I was aiming. Again, this could be just that I'm used to QuiVR, but from The Lab to QuiVR I didn't get that same feeling. I have shot a bow in real life and I imagine that there should be a ""correct"" way to shoot in VR that matches exactly to real-life shooting. I didn't get that strange ""not where I aimed"" feeling with the other two games, and I really didn't want to retrain my brain with another bow in fear that it might mess up my aiming in QuiVR :-).",1487208872,1487289384,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,3,True,False,True,False,,1542716393.0,"Hello,

There was some time since your last visit. We just want to let you know that there are things we improved.

From what you have mentioned back then: 

-We improved the animations (like orc/troll death and more).
-Dodging the axe now is more dynamic (there is also a throwing sound so you can be aware of it). You can avoid the axe using one of the new ice spells.
-There are new maps and new game mode which is PVP Deathmatch.
-There are Tournaments on the way to the game.

We also applied many improvements to the bow mechanics and shooting in our game. We know it wasn't perfect back then but we would love to know if the changes we have made make the game better for you.

Comparing it to Quivr........

.......When I first played it I was going say its a better Value for the amount of content.......Then I Saw the Large Flying Fking Dragon Attacking the Castle (That you can shoot) I was defending and thought to myself.......""Yeah this is way better than Quivr"". The upgrade system is very simple and straight forward......something that is not explained very well in quivr. The bow mechanics are very similar to quivr except you don't have to reach over your shoulder to grab another arrow.....Which I like. I havent played a multiplayer game with other people yet so I really cant say it works or not but the way you move around is exactly like quivr. 

Architecture of the levels is great but the textures seem a little on the bland side.....not bad by any means.....they just don't pop out at me like i think they should......animations of the characters seems a little stiff like they were animated manually and not through motion capture.......None of this stuff is a deal breaker especially at this price point.

Looking through the games history the game devs are releasing regular updates......This is a very positive sign to me and makes me feel like I didn't waste my money on a cash grab.

With all the Garbage and shovelware for VR being dumped onto steam these days this is one of the few I put in the STRONGLY urge you to BUY category.....

We would like to inform you that the game has changed a lot since your review was published.

Elven Assassin has been expanded in almost every aspect. The game has received new content, performance has been improved and the multiplayer mode is much more interesting.

Maybe you would give Elven Assasin a second chance?

This game has come a LONG way in a short time!

Have not had a problem finding a multiplayer game, the spells and equipment add a lot to the game, and the community that I have met here of late have been superb to play with!

The dev team is still the greatest selling point of this game. VR is new ground, with many challenges to pioneer.  Tweaks bother major and minor have gone into this game, and it shows.  

The community is getitng some experience now, and some of us that don't move as fast as we used to are starting to be able to last more than 30 rounds without collapsing.

Easily my overall favorite VR title.

Reviewed Dec 2016

I'll admit, straight away, that I am biased when it comes to donning elven armor and killing orcs with a bow.  Sign me up, no more questions asked.

Because this is a VR room-scale game, don't let the 6 hours played fool you... it would be far longer, but I get so intensely into this game that I wear myself out pretty quickly.  It's not just the drawing of the bow, but leaning out to get that last ditch long-shot on an orc rounding the corner, or dropping to a knee to duck an axe thrown by an orc who seems upset that you stuck an arrow in his buddy's braincase.

The graphics are good, the sound is fine, but the fact that the world around you disappears and you *become* an elven archer, defending a settlement or castle from onrushing hordes of orcs supplemented by ogres and dragons is really all that matters when it comes right down to it.

Full disclosure:  There are some rough edges, but in the grand scheme of early access titles they are very minor indeed.  You can jump in, right now, start slaughtering orcs alone or with up to 4 friends in co-op, and begin leveling up and learning magic skills such as flaming arrows, multi-arrows, short-lived traps that damage everything that passes, etc.   

This dev team is active, and since purchasing the game in July we've seen many fixes, and a great deal of content from a new and much different map, weather, mannable siege weapons, and the new level system that brings with it the aforementioned magic skills that supplement rather than over-power your character.  In the end, it still comes down to your personal accuracy and agility.

Stay hydrated, and prepare to wake up sore, because this game is intense.",1482944363,1492478833,True,2,0,0.522471904754638672,0,True,False,True,False,,,

When I first purchased my Vive I was immediately drawn into the longbow mini game included in the 'The Lab'. I searched Steam for similar content and stumbled into this gem. In the Elven Assassin you play as an archer trying to protect a fortress from orcs invaders. It's a wave based shooter, with the aim to to survive as long as possible. The game also includes a co-op multiplayer option, which I have  found the most enjoyable part of the game.

The bow mechanics are similar to those in 'The Lab', but a lot more refined. That being said it still needs some work, in particular with making aiming feel more natural. The game also gives you the ability to defend different areas of the fortress using a cleverly implemented teleport function, which requires the player to shoot the bow in the direction of the desired location.

In future updates I would love to see improved animations and audio. All the orcs seem to have the same unnatural 'plop' to the ground as they die. A little variation would go a long way. Also, the 'They're breaking in!' voice over could do with some nice voice acting, and perhaps some dramatic music.

All-in-all this game was a great experience, and definitely worth the cost compared to other Vive games. I look forward to seeing how this game develops with time.",1482322921,1482322921,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,False,,,

'더 랩'에 있는 롱보우 게임보다 훨씬 세밀한 컨트롤을 요합니다.
왼팔에 컨트롤러를 쥔 각도. 
오른팔이 화살을 쥔 각도에 따라 화살의 경로가 영향을 받습니다.
덕분에 약간이라도 지쳐서 팔이 내려가기 시작하면 명중률이 확 떨어집니다.
그래도 그 부분은 리얼리티에 관한 몰입감을 줌으로 넘어갑시다.
멀티플레이도 재미있습니다.
지금까지 3명과 멀티를 해봤는데 서로 제스쳐를 보낼 수 있고 
음성으로 대화를 할 수 있다는 점이 재미를 더합니다.
아시아 서버에서 서로 잘 못하는 영어로 제스쳐로 의사소통한다는 점이 
또 다른 재미라고 볼 수 있습니다.

그러나 문제점도 있습니다.
첫째,
게임에 대해서 제대로된 설명이 게임 내부에 부재합니다.
어떻게 다른 포인트로 이동하는지
스킬은 어떻게 쓰는지
게임 내에서 찾을 수 없고 업데이트 내용을 통해 들어야 합니다.

둘째,
난이도 조절이 시급합니다.
아직까지는 화살과 스킬 구현에 치중이 되어 있는지 난이도가 고르지 못합니다.
중간부터 몬스터가 갑자기 파도처럼 밀려들어오는 경우가 있습니다.
그때는 단순한 ctrl + c , v  같은 몬스터 구성과 쏟아지는 물량은 
위급함보다는 단조로움, 지루함을 자극합니다.
 
셋째,
컨텐츠가 더 필요합니다.
한정된 몬스터, 그리고 몬스터를 단순히 스킬과 화살로만 막는다기 보다는
지형지물이나 이벤트를 통해 해치울 수 있게 만든다면 더 재미가 있겠죠.

그래도...
이 게임은 1만원 미만의 가격이고 
미리 해보는 게임이므로 앞으로 가능성이 무한히 많습니다.
그러나 지금 당장 이 게임을 하시게 될 분들은 2일에서 3일 이내에 
위와 같은 답답함을 느낄 것이라 생각합니다.
가능성에 대해서 투자하고 싶으시고 변해가는 모습을 흥미진진하게 지켜볼 수 있으시다면

https://youtu.be/Pjd228yIBnY

There are tons of bow and arrow games available in VR. And in my opinion, Elven Assassin is among the very best.

This was the first game that both my Dad and I purchased after we each bought our Vive’s over a year ago. Mostly for the multiplayer co-op play. And after all that time this is still the game we come back to over and over to play together.

The gameplay is fundamentally simple. Waves of Orcs, Trolls, and Dragons try to infiltrate the gate you're defending. 
Some orcs throw axes which you need to duck and dodge, and the giant Dragon will breath fire on your team if you don't kill it in time. 

The arrow mechanics are second to none. Any subtle way that you hold the bow or the arrow will influence the trajectory of where you shoot. You don't feel inhibited by the shooting mechanics at all.

There’s currently three maps to play in: Elven Town, Human Village, and Human Castle.
The castle is multiplayer only, but it features unique weapons like a catapult.

As you play more you will rank up and earn experience points which you can use to buy magical spells. After you buy spells you can summon them whenever you draw an arrow and use your bow hand thumb pad to select to spell you want (for me it’s the left hand), then the arrow you fire will create the spell. The spells are really handy for taking out large groups of orcs. 

I find this game enjoyable in both single player and multiplayer. And like I said before this is one of those games my Dad and I keep playing together over and over again. I highly recommend it.",1478486380,1505162220,True,0,0,0.454661726951599121,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Thank you for that comment. 

The game has changed a lot since your comment was published. We have improved the look of the game, implemented an extensive multiplayer mode that offers co-op, deathmatch, and tournaments, added new spells, improved the performance and fixed a lot of bugs. 

We have even more interesting content planned, such as new maps, opponents and new mechanics. 

Maybe try Elven Assassin again and let us know what you think. We would appreciate your feedback about the current state of the game!

Thing is, when it comes to archery games - and ""defend the gate""-types in particular;
the [b]free[/b] one in ""[i]The Lab[/i]"" is already very good.
That means that any derivative games need to be at least *as* good, while also offering something more.
[i]Elven Assassin[/i] does neither.

First of all, aiming the bow feels very 'off'.
In trying to lining up a shot I found that I almost had to hold my hands right in front of my face - which doesn't work well at all given that neither the VIVE or the VIVE Controller is particularly small, so I ended up bumping myself in the face a couple of times.

There's also a huge lack of enemy variety and I couldn't see any alternative interactions ([i]like barrels you can shoot to blow up large groups, torches to set your arrows on fire, etc[/i]).
That just leaves a very basic archery game where, like I already mentioned, I didn't like the actual archery.

What [i]Elven Assassin[/i] has that [i]The Lab[/i] didn't is multiplayer.

You can teleport to other towers in multiplayer but i couldn't find a game. Ping rates for closest servers are shown - nice idea.
   The biggest issue i had with was with the bow dynamics - it just didn't feel right and was hard to aim. That improved with practice but maybe the people of Elf town should do a deal with Quivr village and buy their bows from them. Don't trade the elven helmets for them tho' cos those things are useless. Maybe it's optimistic to think they'd stop an axe thrown by a 400lb Orc but perhaps they could do a deal with the fairies so you could get health hits every time you're whacked in the back of the head. One hit to the head and you're out of the game and it's hard to watch every sneaky Orc bastard.
  
   The American accented alert 'Theyre breaking in' was handy but maybe a European accent with helpful stuff like 'They are making rear entry'or 'Orcs coming down the back passage' would be better.

I can't recommend this game for the singleplayer experience, because you can die by one axe to the face, instead of just your outpost being destroyed (which kills the fun for me personally).

Multiplayer however, is a blast and I highly recommend it! (especially for the price)

Pros:
easily pick up and play
bow mechanics similar to ""The Lab""
online play (4 player co-op!)
pretty good graphics
fast paced & challenging
teleport between posts
points scoring system, get points based on different variables (distance, headshot, etc.)
good workout

Cons:
getting hit by an axe in single player completely ends the game.
animations are clunky (i had an axe thrown at me while the orc wasnt facing me)
online play can be variously laggy (me: california, guy in minnesota: fine, me and guy in california: unplayable lag)
teleporting (there needs to be a different way to teleport, i kept shooting my arrows to cover someone and ended up teleporting to them.)


What i'd like to see:
respawn after getting hit with an axe instead of just ending the entire game.
more levels
more enemy types
addition of magic/special abilites
addition of traps
maybe an addition of a mage character that throws ice to slow down and fire to damage",1473709635,1473709724,True,8,1,0.566587865352630615,0,True,False,True,False,,,

由于玩家人数不多，合作模式也匹配不到人。

小怪会从4，5条路进攻，但是没有脚步声，很容易漏怪。

弓箭是唯一武器，射箭弹道和Longbow有点不一样，需要习惯

小怪在几波之后会攻击玩家，两飞刀就能打死，死了以后游戏结束。很难，真的很难！

多人模式也可以一个人玩，有几个点可以传送，传送方式是用箭射击传送点，有点别扭。。。

I personally like this game more than QuiVR and dodging incoming attacks is not a part of QuiVR, however both games are great - there doesn't have to be just one archery fantasy game. Also, it seems a tad unfair to me that half of these reviews are from players with 5-8 minutes or less played.

Original review:
I don't often write reviews but I felt compelled to write one tonight after playing this game because I'm glad to support it!

This game is a pure bow game, with excellent pullback mechanics. The bow responds well, aims well, and just feels nice. Less like Holopoint and more like the tower defense from The Lab (both great games).

It's also worth mentioning it can be a bit of a workout when you have to start dodging axes, luckily it didn't take me too long to learn and somehow I squeezed out the number three spot on the leaderboards (for now) haha.

If you're on the fence, pick it up, it's easily as fun as Holopoint and right now on this sale it's almost just a third of the price. You won't be disappointed!

I did not receive this game for free, it was just a random pickup when searching for games via the ""release date"" option on the steam store.",1473590112,1473994024,True,50,1,0.743108987808227539,10,True,False,True,False,,,

☆把QuiVr的射箭傳送系統完全複製了過來
☆把QuiVr的大廳、字體完全複製了過來
☆這游戲中唯一的原創：怪物會向你丟斧頭，你會死


缺點(還是吐槽點)：
▼這款作品90%抄襲了QuiVr
▼這種品質還敢拿出來賣錢給QuiVr的作者看
▼連綫優化極差，怪物與投射物斧頭會瞬移根本沒辦法打
▼怎麽沒有把QuiVr原創的的升級系統也一起抄過來啊？


整體評分：

這款游戲應該要壓倒性負評，我個人是絕對無法容忍這種抄襲的行爲，建議各位買下來給負評後退費。


不敢相信居然有人可以這麽無恥地把別人辛苦開發的游戲完全抄過來，然後大剌剌的賣錢！
去玩具店偷玩具還吧偷來的玩具放在門口賣？
真的是夠了，吃我的退費吧！這種行爲完全證明了你們沒有絲毫創意與開發能力！玩得我一肚子氣！
