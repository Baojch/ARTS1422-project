I really wanted to recommend this game, I really really did.
If you've played through twII, potff, cot and still want more, shattered embrace should be a no-brainer. Yes there are bugs, no it isn't polished, yes the story is cheesy, these are the things we can expect from a TW game. 
When the game boots you are greeted by a bad Morgan Freeman impersonator that now plays Orias. Many of the voice actors from previous installments, even as recent as CoT, are absent in SE and very poorly replaced. The protagonist only seems to have voice files for cutscenes, and while conversing you are often prompted to click on what he would be saying next- as if conversational choices were going to be implemented at some point but the mechanic was never removed. I found CoT to be refreshingly funny, but SE tries to force humor seemingly nonstop. Much of the writing, as well as some artwork in the game, really seems like a rough draft that was made quickly but never revised.
The first section of the game is kill-happy but it ties the story and gameplay together nicely and the danger element was fun imo. Ive heard many times how the game's main city is big and empty but I found it very different from the other citys of TWII and thought it was well made and with plenty of teleports. There is much more loot to be found in SE than CoT, and maybe even PotFF. Many sidequests can be undertaken and alot of the questgivers are marked on the map so they can be easily found. 
SE's World maps are okay but kind of dull which is very disappointing as TW has always had great variation in the levels. Even worse is how many of the game's enemies are recycled, and poorly. Don't tell me that an elemental cloud and a rock monster are robots. And only ONE enemy type in the ENTIRE game gives experience points! Combat is entirely worthless unless an enemy is actively preventing you from progressing or you want some loot. Soundtrack is okay, could be better could be worse. 
Heres the thing, I would still recommend Shattered Embrace if not for a game-breaking glitch. There is some neat stuff in this expansion, even with the bogus lack of combat xp and terrible/missing voices. If you absolutely must scratch your curiosity about this game just remember you are rolling dice as to whether you can complete it or not.",1629956444,1629956444,False,7,0,0.600144028663635254,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+ Storyline is fantastic. Full of twists and actually quite complex.
+ Tons of content, dozens and dozens of quests and areas to explore.
+ Most of the stuff have better textures than previous expansions.
+ A whole new soundtrack which is very beautiful and epic. It's one of my favourite soundtracks ever.
+ They added autolooting for the bodies with weightless items. Extremely useful and time saving.
+ Tons of characters from base game and previous expansions make an appearance here.
+ Tons of references to quests from previous expansions and even consiquences of your choices if you play with the same character loaded from save files.

- First hour is terrible. If you go off the main track, you get intstantly killed. Exploration is non existent. It's full of cheap death traps. After that terrible first hour the game gets much better, so obviously this game got such a bad reputation, not many bothered continuing playing.
- Received a free bonus code for activating my license. Key was already used... I guess they game me the same code I got for base game.
- There is no sound for the lines of protagonist in dialogues. That includes every dialogue in this game... Protagonist is fully voiced in cutscenes, so... I have no words to comment, it's a terrible glitch I guess.
- Worst optimization ever. Fps range from 5fps in city and 60-100fps everythere else. That graphics upgrade truly paid off.
- There are places there you can go through the wall and fall out of map.
- Main storyline ends with a cliffhanger. I have a feeling it will never get a continuation.
- Very sadly, I could not beat all side quests. 1. Abe's questline was left with him telling me speak to Bernard first, I have beated all bernard's quests, but Abe still tells me to speak with Bernard first and only later he will speak to me. I've beaten the whole game but Abe is still saying the same stuff. 2. The elf shop would possibly give me more quests but the owner is forever waiting for the classification from the king which again, I've beaten the whole game and he still is waiting for the classification. 3. Chancellor was ready to give me a special mission if I got enough reputation but the only possible way to do so was to play the main quests and by the time I got enough reputation the chancellor forgot about the mission he was supposed to give me and only talked about the main quest instead, after finnishing the whole game the chancellor is gone, I've no idea where he is now. So I could not finnish 3 questlines which is really sad since it's maybe 2 hours of content lost. There are no walkthroughs of these quests anythere to watch so I guess I'll never know what I've missed.

I can definitely recommend this, but keep in mind that the first hour is terrible and there's tons of glitches which some make some quests unbeatable.

UPDATE: 2.0.7.3 Most of the missing Voice Over Sounds now there. Some stutters during some dialog scenes still occur.

Well, at the moment I can recommend it only for real hard core fans of the Two Worlds series.
The Intro/Beginning is the first impression of a game. Why fails SE here so badly...?  If I watch a movie and the first 10 minutes are disappointing (here technical issues anf game design) I switch of TV. I am a big fan of the Two Worlds series and even the last DLC Call of the Tenebrae I enjoyed very much although there were some issues and bugs.
But you cannot launch this game with this kind of horrible first 15 minutes where I as a Two Worlds veteran player feel like a complete newbie - with a Level 80 hero! The game design of the first minutes feels much too confused and hectic. Why the timer...? (make it longer at least...) Yes, after this crash landing on the beach it gets better (elven town) in the next hours.
In my opinion the decision not to voice over the hero completley will push away the last remaining Two Worlds fans - as I am. But far more disappoiting is the bad state of the release version of Shattered Embrace. Why releasing it after the delays in that state? An unfinished and faulty product is always a bad idea - no matter what...

Now it is up to the devs to change my opnion....
Review will updated then ....

Issues:
> Please, please enable the full XBox-controller support (preset) as in the past titles of Two Worlds !!! Why takes SE t a step back in user friendly way of playing?
> Hero vs. Monster Balancing needs rework
> In general most monsters feel too strong! hey, we play a veteran level 80 hero and even a common panther in the jungle can be a problem.. feels strange...

############ GERMAN ##########
UPDATE: 2.0.7.3 Die meisten fehlenden Voice-Over-Sounds sind jetzt da. Während einiger Dialogszenen treten noch einige Stotterer auf.
Nun, im Moment empfehle iches nur für echte Hardcore-Fans der Two Worlds-Serie.
Das Intro / Beginning ist der erste Eindruck eines Spiels. Warum scheitert SE hier so schlimm ...? Wenn ich einen Film schaue und die ersten 10 Minuten enttäuschend sind (hier technische Probleme und game design), schalte ich den Fernseher aus. Ich bin ein großer Fan der Two Worlds-Reihe und selbst der letzte DLC-Call of the Tenebrae hat mir sehr gut gefallen, obwohl es einige Probleme und Fehler gab.
Sie können dieses Spiel jedoch nicht mit diesen trashigen ersten 15 Minuten starten (technische Aspekte).
Auch das Spieldesign der ersten Minuten wirkt sehr verwirrend und hektisch. Warum der Timer ...? (mach es wenigstens länger ...)
Ja, nach dieser Bruchlandung wird es in den nächsten Stunden besser (Elfenstadt).
Jetzt liegt es a den Entwicklern, ob ich meine Meinung ändere...
Diese Bewertung wird evtl. aktualisiert ....

Probleme:

Reality Pump, you really, really dropped the ball with this game. I was willing to stand behind it even in spite of the technical issues, countless bugs, horrendous voice acting, terrible animation and everything, because it still managed to make me feel entertained, and I was actually really interested in the story. However, I will have to say that right now, the game is BORING ME TO FUCKING DEATH.

I am still curious about the ending, so I'm at a point where I just try to sprint through the main questline to get there, but BOY, the game just goes on for-feckin'-ever. And on top of that, a bug is preventing me from continuing, so, I guess I'll just wait it out. 

But the game is a right mess. The quests are atrociously boring and lackluster, and they're ALWAYS just a mindless back-and-forth from one NPC to another. Case in point, I went from Shadinar to Freehaven, only to be sent back to Shadinar and back to Freehaven and back again for so many times it was just painful. I have a questlog that is cluttered with side quests which I just don't want to do anymore, and I am a huge completionist at heart. Never missed a quest in Two Worlds II or in Pirates of the Flying Fortress. 

Outside of that, the world is big, but it's EMPTY. There is really nothing to it. Shadinar is a huge city, as promised, but the districts are just all the same, and they have nothing worthwhile. It's the same with Freehaven. 

And even worse is that the missions you're sent to have you need to just run through huge clusters of enemies, all packed together along the way, which makes it damn near impossible to get there without cheating. Worst case of it is in Gromshar, where you are literally sent to fight an army of rats by yourself. 

Don't even get me started on the story. In the beginning, it seemed interesting, but right now, it's all just a big ""what the fuck"" filled with moments that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.

What I mean is do not buy this yet as the game has a lot of potential but sadly, after playing less than 2 hours of it, I have found numerous bugs or potential bugs:

1. For some reason the game did not register my previous save file to import. Not sure if this is because I've bought the HD dlc and the core game series I have is not part of the renewed HD remasters. I cannot see why that would be an issue but for now I'll put that down to ""Not a bug"" status just an annoyance.
2. Some dialogue is voiced and others not, which I believe is a bug, and one that is very annoying. My reason for this is when the game crashed and I reloaded a save the previous unvoiced line suddenly had voiced dialogue. Either have all dialogue voiced or have none of it voiced in my opinion. The developers deffinitly need to get right on that ASAP.
3. When lockpicking the MANY MANY chest in the starting area some of the lock picking would focus the camera away from the chest lockpicking mini-game and either zoom away to some cliff side or into Dar Pha's breasts (not entirely complaining about that one ;) ) but it is annoying when you try again and the mini-game for lockpicking doesn't appear. Again the development team need to fix that. 
4. When I decided to fight a certain series of ""construct creatures"" at the start sometimes when I was fighting I would suddenly zip under the map and fall endlessly to my death. No idea whats up with that, but again I assume its a bug.
5. When I decided to use the stealth option to go under the rocks the function wouldn't work. Tried re-loading and again it wouldn't work which forced me to fight the constructs. Annoying and not entirely a problem but thought I would report this.
6. Also the game's tutorial reminders seem confused as to what you are using. For example; I use keyboard and mouse when playing this game and its previous games. The help windows were telling me to use Left trigger and Right bumper for certain actions which is just plain silly... 

These are the 6 I encountered and then I just stopped playing as currently the game needs sorted. I would also ask the developers to play test the game and bug fix before they release further content as its really put a downer on such a cool franchise and it just pisses the fans off. I honestly love Two Worlds 2, the characters, the lore everything and I loved the £5 cheeky buy years ago at a steam christmas sale which I had purchased the entire collection. I never knew it had a HD collection until I saw this dlc release.

I find myself in a sad position of, right now, being unable to rate it positive in the recommend choice so for now I have to mark it negative BUT if the bugs and kinks are worked out I'll switch my review to a positive instead.",1575769048,1575772463,False,17,0,0.633719861507415771,0,True,False,False,False,,,
