This game is a stellar example of how insanely fun platformer shooters can be, and it amazes me that there aren't any huge popular ones. It has the most clippable, insane moments out of any game I have ever played consistently. If it were released standalone without seeming like a sequel or DLC to the original, and marketed a bit, I wouldn't be surprised if this game was insanely popular.
Despite that, this game's community is so small that you can only really get games with other people through the game's discord server and weekend events hosted by community members. The only reason I can think of as to why this game never blew up is because of the insane learning curve. It takes a lot of time and skill to get good at the game, and there are so many different playstyles that can throw people off guard if they've either never seen it before or aren't expecting it.

The main playstyles are:
Tanky - Stationary unkillable turret, shield almighty
Melee - *teleports behind you* (no but literally you can do that)
Bullet Hell - Slow down time and spam walls of bullets
Stealth - Like cloakers in payday but invisible when stationary
Rushdown - Go zoom brr brr
... the list goes on.

Even more, you can combine playstyles as well with all of the different guns and utility that you can buy. This is a shooter, definitely, but there's no need to learn utility lineups and perfectly thrown nades can win rounds easily (or blow yourself up =P).

The gunplay is even crazier, and takes a while to get really good at. There are lots of little details you can optimize with insane results.

How to shoot dem fools and not get shot
1. Face the bullets (they do like triple damage to ur back)
2. Prefire everything since everyone has wallhacks basically
3. BULLETS MOVE SLOWLY so place shots accordingly
4. Bots go zoom and spinny and everything else so landing a tiny pellet size bullet needs to be placed pretty perfectly.
5. Shoot dem eyes to kill.
6. Get smacked by Whey running towards you with a sword anyway.

There's still great movement, timing and skill that could go along with this game and it can be a fast paced shooter, but with the added mouse controls it'll limit some players and be better preferred for others, and may not provide the same feeling and playstyle one might get from the original.

This is still a fun game, even if the public servers are inactive (and so are the original Cobalt's servers, comparing the two isn't worth it) but you'll eventually run into some one or you can find friends to play this cheap, cartoon-y shooter and have fun with what could be compared to games like CS:GO.

Cobalt WASD can be modded by players and could be more expansive if players put in the time, but Cobalt WASD seems to only have one gamemode that could be easily compared to Bomb Defusal in CS:S and CS:GO.

Well... fine, maybe there is:

Cobalt WASD is a high-octane 2D shooter where 2 teams fight to either plant or defuse a bomb. While the gamemode isn't exactly innovative, the considerable range of weapons and classes at your disposal make for very interesting combos, so the game doesn't ever feel boring or tedious.

Now, you may have already seen the trailer and thought ""Wow. I have NO idea what's happening"" and while I do agree that at first it may be tough to aware of everything that's going on, once you learn the ropes and play a few rounds, the chaos becomes a beautiful dance of bullets, grenades and rockets with you weaving through them gracefully and landing the perfect sword strike on an enemy's head as they foolishly try to reload.

Okay, that MAY take more than a couple of rounds to pull off, but the point is, when you get the grasp of things, you start to exploit the chaos, to take advantage of it to do something amazing or to completely outsmart the enemy. It's... great.

WASD is relatively easy to get into since 2D aiming isn't too hard to control, but a big part of this game has to do with player awareness and quick thinking. You'll find that the skilled players out there are better not because of their aim necessarily, but because of their reaction times and game sense. You'll be shooting at someone and suddenly they throw a grenade that ricochets twice and lands square on your head and you can't help but to open your mouth in awe and think to yourself ""I can't believe that just happened."".

The problem with making a game that relies on a multiplayer community, is that as soon as people stop playing it, it basically becomes redundant. Unfortunately, that seems to be the case with the otherwise fun Cobalt WASD, developed by Oxeye Game Studio and published by Mojang of Minecraft fame.

If the name sounds familiar, it’s because Cobalt, also developed by Oxeye, was released about 18 months earlier.

Cobalt WASD starts off promisingly enough, with two teams of cute little avatars rushing around a multitude of arena maps trying to plant bombs in each other’s territory. If you’re imagining a hybrid of Counter-Strike and Worms, you’re not far from reality.

There are a few different items on sale; ranged and melee weapons, and different suits of armour that endow different abilities, like a stealth suit that allows your avatar to turn invisible. You start off with an initial amount of currency, and after victorious rounds, you earn more cash (and less after defeats) to change your arsenal.

After a few rounds playing with bots, it slowly dawns on you that it’s such a shame that the online community for Cobalt WASD doesn’t seem to have taken off. It’s like wandering alone around a deserted amusement park; lots of the rides look like great fun, but the total lack of people makes it a bit of a soulless experience.

The other strange thing about Cobalt WASD is the decision to release it as a separate game. It would seem like a much better idea to introduce it as a game mode to its parent game, Cobalt, rather than fragmenting the player base into two different games.

Admittedly the game mechanics for each are totally different, and this perhaps has led to the introduction of the separate title; there was feedback about Cobalt that players missed the “mouse+WASD” method of other titles.

That said, there is some mileage playing with the bots in single player, which have a satisfying amount of range in difficulty settings. And there are a variety of different maps to play on, each of which looks stunning in the retro, pixelated graphics style.

I especially enjoyed how each of them tells a story about why each side is trying to blow it up; for example, “Boulevard”, which depicts a feud between rival hipster bars; and “Hotel”, where both sides are disgruntled guests leaving pseudo-Trip Adviser reviews about their poor stay.

It’s a good title to have a quick blast of, put down and then come back to later; there’s enough variety to engage for a few rounds and provide a bit of diversion. But unfortunately, it does all come back around to the fact that, at its core, Cobalt WASD is a multiplayer game that apparently doesn’t have any players.

Of course, you can host private matches and play with friends. But as of writing, I waited for over 10 minutes to find a public match with no joy; browsing the hosted servers reveal player counts of zero. Silence has fallen on what could be a fun title, if only there was a community there to support it.

Why bother rolling when you can just generate an entire barrier in front of you that deflects all the shots you want, or slow down time at will?

Plus, a lot of new items and fresh visuals really add a new atmosphere, complete with crate generators, sentry guns, shiny new hulls, and a lot more. Plus, new tilesets! Lots of new tilesets! Like, even a Minecraft one (because people wouldn't shut up about it being from Mojang, apparently.)

The gameplay is far more simple and linear than the original Cobalt, too, so it's great if the first game didn't tickle your fancy. It's all just one single gamemode here, folks. It may be a bit on the experimental side, but I do beleive this addition to the little franchise that can is a much needed one.

As someone who's been (through some better and some worse) with the Cobalt community since that open alpha years ago, I can really vouch for this game.

The maps are great and have different layouts and playstyles. You can bum rush by using tunnels underneath or side paths, or you can build tanky and just push through the middle, eating damage and claiming your territory.

Another great part of this game is how they dealt with the overload of information in games like CSGO. You can do very interesting plays, while the game still remaining simple. The interesting plays rely on you as a player more than your weapons or suit (though they can definitely help.)

Oyunu 1 saat oynamama rağmen inceleme yapmak için çok erken olduğunu düşünmüyorum .
    
    Oyunumuz Counter-Strike altyapısında sadece 2D olan ve daha gelişmiş silahlara , jetpacklere , bombalara sahip olan bir oyun . Counter-Strike'ta olduğu gibi 2 takım kapışıyor . Mavi taraf ; Metalface , Kırmızı Taraf ;  Protobots . Bu takımlarda tahmin edebilceğiniz gibi kırmızı taraf terörist mavi taraf ise anti-terörist oluyor . Oyunun amacı Counter-Strike ile aynı bir taraf bomba kurup savunmaya çalışırken diğer taraf bombayı imha etmeye çalışıyor . Oyunun en sevdiğim yani beyni çıkmış bir takım arkadaşınızı canlandırmanız :D Bu da oyuna ayrı bir hava katmış . Oyunun kontrollerine gelince , mouse ile aim alıyoruz . Silahın sekme gibi bir durumu yok onu da söyleyelim . WASD tuşlarıyle ileri geri sağa sola , SPACE tuşuyla zıplama oluyor . Shift tuşu ile ise jetpack çalışıyor . Kontroller bu kadar basit ama alışması zor .

    Arkadaşlarla oynanırsa çok eğlenceli bir hal alıyor . Kesinlikle almanızı tavsiye ediyorum . Fiyatı da oldukça uygun . Eğer oynayacak arkadaş bulamadıysanız beni arkadaş olarak ekleyebilirsiniz . :)
 
    Artıları : 
*Klasik savaş oyunlarından farklı bir atmosferi olması
*Sade bir arayüz
*Atölye haritalarının olması kendi haritanızı yapabilme olanağı
*Savaş ortamının eğlenceli olması
*Ölen takım arkadaşınızı canlandırabilme
 
    Eksileri :
*Bana göre kötü bir müziğe sahip olması
*Oyunun bazen saçmalaması . ( Atılan mızrağın sizi ölene kadar takip etmesi )

    Son olarakta oyunu puanlamaya geldi sıra .

    Grafikler = 9/10
    Oynanış = 8/10
    Oyun içi sesler = 8/10
    Yaratıcılık = 10/10
    Eğlence = 10/10 

    Ortalama = 9/10

This game has all you want:
- Balanced items and armors for each team
- No ""reach level X to unlock gameplay stuff"" b*llsh*t
- Cute robots
- A big variety of items and weapons that allow very different playstyles (even support!)
- Fun and tense bomb-defusal gamemode
- Cute robots!!

The way I would describe this game shortly is a combination of high action quake-y combat and careful strategy.
Just running into a fight without a plan will get you killed and even with a plan things will not go favorably for you so you have to improvise quite a bit, and with all of the games loudout options, team composition, positioning and playstyles assures that no fight is the same. 
The game requires some learning but its basics should be easy to pickup if you've ever played 3d shooters or platformers.
If you lack aiming skill and such you still can be useful to the team (extremely) if you choose to play a healer loudout that is not as boring as in other games, you have to keep some aim on your heal target and still manage your movement but its a fairly good way to see all of the insane combinations of weapons and suits.
The community is friendly and generally nice to new players.

Cobalt WASD - это полностью переделанный оригинальный, и не скажу что прямо удачный, Cobalt из которого убрали сюжет, сделали отличное управление для ПК и добавили соревновательную составляющую. Надеюсь в этот раз у Mojang получится распиарить игру. Я играл и в оригинальный Cobalt, и в ЗБТ Cobalt WASD, а я знаю о чём говорю.

Плюсы:
1. Нереально крутой слоумоушен во время дикой перестрелки.
2. Динамичный геймплей которые затягивает с первой минуты
3. Большое разнообразие оружия, карт, стилей игры
4. Тут есть транспортные средства. [spoiler] Я правда не знаю зачем, ведь вы его потеряете почти сразу, но почему бы и нет [/spoiler]
5. Моддинг и Мастерская Steam

Минусы:
1. Полное отсутсвие русской локализации, а так же отсуствие возможности сделать кастомный русик
2. Онлайн. Пока что очень он маленький, но я надеюсь, что вскоре всё изменится.

Моя оценка: 9.5/10. Это. Просто. Нечто.

However, Cobalt WASD is really user friendly. The game is similar in concept to CS:GO. The blue team has to to try to prevent the red team from planting the bomb. Another great feature is the armour types. There are currently 6 amour types which have different strengths. There is 

chrono- move 3x faster than others. 
Heavy- much more health
Stealth- Invisibility *heavy breathing*
Scouter- make an invicible shield around yourself and others
light armour- better than nothing!
metal face chrono- slow time... like neo

and other stuff... cba to write it all down.

Its really easy to jump into a game in a break for a few minutes and jump straight out again.

PROS: 
currency based on ingame performance (eg killing an ememy)
employable tactics
easier to play than original Cobalt
Radiculously fun
Great community
regular content updates
a balanced class system
devs really open to feedback
you can make maps and play them in game
customisation

CONS:
all online content (is this a con tho)

Ive been a part of the beta testers community for a long time before the game was released and its not like classic cobalt or any multiplayer game really, WASD is quite unique. The game itself is a 2d platformer, wich was created to play in multiplayer. The PvP aspect of the game is just perfect: alot of weapons and equipement to mess around with and as a result many interesting strats to invent and use. And all of the content is available right from the very beginning! This might seem confusing but you will figure it out very soon, because there are ingame discriptions and stats of all the stuff you can use. Hope WASD will get more popularity than classic cobalt. 
 
To sum up: a very fun and action packed game with a strategy aspect, will buy a copy for every friend in steam!",1512129229,1535498343,True,29,3,0.712968349456787109,2,False,True,False,False,,,
