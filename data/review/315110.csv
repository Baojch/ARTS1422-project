Look at a game like the original Mario Bros, or Ms. Pac Man, or Centipede or Tetris. Sit there and tell me with a straight face that those are ""simple"" or that they ""lack depth"". It is possible to find brilliance and depth within elegant simplicity; we see that in modern titles like Minecraft and Downwell and Molemen Must Die! just to name a few. And you will find that elegant simplicity here as well.

In the swamp of games that is available in today's market it could be very easy to dismiss this game quickly as a turd, after seeing it's admittedly crude graphics. And I could even see a person becoming disenchanted due to the lack of obvious game instructions - it's left to the player and yet it's all there to be taken-in and easily deduced if you are observant.

I've read grievances that it's a single-screen game, but if you play for a short time you can see that the playfield and enemy behavior dramatically change as the game unfolds ... I feel that's a narrow criticism. I've also read complaints that the graphics are blocky and chintzy... but the thing about speedy arcade games like this is that they demand simplified graphics so the player is not overloaded - and in this game the graphics are done exceptionally well and thoughtfully, and the color palette is well-designed and gives great visibility to all of the screen elements.

I rarely complain about others preferences in games, but it feels like most negative reviews about this game are incorrectly stating that it has no depth, or are grieving that it is less than what they expect it to be, which irritates me because nowhere have I been misled as to what this game is all about.

And nothing could have prepared me for how addictive and satisfying it is to achieve play outcomes and combos and nice moves. I feel like if this game came out in the early 80s it would be a legendary classic today.

TLDR: Split screen is were the meat of the gameplay is at but after testing alone, and seeing how limited it was, I could not cope with myself if I forcing someone to play this with me.

Single player is underwhelming. You toss eggs and exploding skulls and little critters that came out of the eggs and collect coins for highscore. You are trapped in one screen.

Now here is the review :

GRAPHICS:
The visuals are some sort of ""arcade style"" graphics, very colorful and minimalist, why not. But here they are just empty, almost no textures for the background, just a color gradient for the platforms, and our caracters... oh my god, even the enemies look better than you. The menu look like an arcade menu, its cool but I'm not a huge fan.

SOUNDS:
Songs in general are nice. The sound design is minimalist but once again I'm not fan.

GAMEPLAY:
Here it become interesting. Basically the gameplay look like this game named Super Crate Box or the first Super Mario. Basically you have a 2D arena and you have to kill the enemies before they arrived at the bottom of the map. Eggs spawn and you have to break them with skulls. When an enemies come out of his egg he move and try to go at the bottom of the map and you to kill it with a skull or another egg. When he fall in the lava at the bottom he return at the top stronger than before.
The big probleme is that you can't throw thing correctly because this game is so minimalist that you can throw this with just one intensity, you will get better with training but it make the firsts games just frustrating.
Last thing to say about gameplay, the music begin to be good at  certain score, so you can't even have the pleasure to enjoy the music when you are a noob.
And why the freaking hell to enemies become human when you die ??? It look like a freaking bug or something.

CONTENT:
Even if you like the visuals, the sound design and the gameplay, this game is empty. Really, really empty. Just look at my playtime you will understand.
The goal of this game is to collect coins. What is the point ? Nothing but make an highscore. Wow great now you can show of with your friends, they will be so pround. No seriously there is absolutly no replayability, I don't even think there is something to unlock in this game. You can just play it again, and again, and again, and after 10 minutes you just realise that this game is repetitive and boring and you just uninstall it.

""Ho no wait there is much more that this ! There is 3 maps !!!""
Maps are basically just the same, the gameplay and the enemies don't change
""But there is a lot of caracters !!!""
Don't be tricked, they are all the same, it changes nothing
""But there is a classic mode !!!""
The classic mode is the first level with the first caracter, what a unfunny joke

CONCLUSION:
The worst with Woah Dave! is not that it has a bad gameplay, bad design ect... (It is just a question of opinion). The worst is that this game brings nothing at all. You can collect money but you can do nothing with it, no unlocks, no upgrades. The gameplay is not diversified, it's always the same. 
Woah Dave! is not horrible, but it one of the least interristing game I ever played in my entier life

The gameplay feels -extremely- shallow, to the point of it feeling like an incomplete game.  Thing is, the game is centered around only that - throwing one of three things at other things.  It doesn't feel dynamic, engaging,  or interesting in the slightest.

The retro aesthetic doesn't come off as charming at all.  It feels forced rather than stylized, almost as if they couldn't be bothered to make real art for the game.  To me it seems nothing but lazy, cheeky, and tacky.  The music is a single looping track across the entire game (that I know of) and there's like a total of 8 sound effects.  All muffled and retro of course.

I associate this game to Joust in the closest possible ways.  It feels outdated, simple to the point of being shallow, and rather unappealing by many modern standards.

basically, this game is for you if you like twitchy score-oriented arcade games at all. my favorite other games are pacman ce/ce2+, pix the cat, super hexagon, velocibox - games for which individual plays take less than 10 minutes, sometimes less than 1, and for which the main reason you want to play again is to outdo your old best (or those of your friends).

despite the retro look (that a lot of studios use for making bad games appear to have a niche appeal), this game feels really tightly designed. a lot of attention has been paid to subtle mechanics that you will only notice as you play more and more, working on beating your old best. examples? 

- the way you can start a jump after falling to keep from jumping high enough to reach the next ledge (where an enemy would have hit you). 
- the way when you get a game over, any coins you left uncollected stay on the screen - creating a mechanic where even a bad run can make your next run great if you die with lots of coins left on the screen. 
- the way certain things have slightly different throw physics (the distance/height they travel, how much they bounce off the walls) that mean every motion has a different skill you have to work on getting better at. (you'll definitely know what i mean after you've thrown your WOAH block into the lava by accident more than once.) 

all this adds up to that you haven't really mastered the game, hours in, even though structurally you understand all the concepts within a minute or two tops. there are emergent concepts and skills that you will only appreciate after sinking time and energy into this title.

so many retro-arcade styled games are all style, no substance. woah dave has both in spades, and for 5 usd it'll be a favorite for a while. it's the kind of game you'll always keep in arms reach, especially if you're not usually available for a endless full day civ/4x session but have a few minutes to kill before you need to be out the door.

This is an entry in the “elimination platformer” genre, a genre that has been dead for over a decade. Back in the days of the arcade and early home console, this type of game was one of the supreme rulers,  including classics like Bubble Bobble, Balloon Fight, TumblePop, Joust, and Mario Bros., just to name a few.

However, when you think about all those classic games, they always had “waves” or “levels”, but Woah Dave! Just throws you into one long level that progressively gets harder. Eggs and Skulls drop randomly from the sky, and you can throw skulls at eggs to produce coins, or you can let the eggs hatch into monsters. If you leave the monsters alive, they will turn into three progressively harder enemies the longer they are left alive, each which yields more coins when killed. Sometimes a UFO will appear to mess with platforms if it’s not killed fast enough, and sometimes a “Woah block” will appear that can clear the screen of all enemies. And that’s all there is to the game. No special items, no multipliers, no different levels with different platform structures, no surprising new bosses or enemies. Just survive for as long as possible and collect coins for a high score. I feel like a lot of people are going to play this for ten minutes and then forget about it.

To the game’s credit, the gameplay is surprisingly deep and skill-based. There’s a mindblow moment when you begin to realize all the trick shots you can make just by throwing things at different moments in your jump or bouncing them off the walls to hit stuff on lower platforms. And if you find the game too slow and monotonous, unlock the Bonkers difficulty and you should be quite satisfied.

It’s a solid and awesomely frantic arcade game with great physics, but it just screams for more variety, enemies, levels, and game mechanics. I would have downvoted this game if it wasn’t for the upcoming DLC that seems to be adding some.

Skulls can be thrown at eggs and monsters to kill them, or used as a timed bomb since they blow up after a few seconds. Woah blocks destroy everything in the level. The object is to collect coins and get as high of a score as possible.

I picked it up on sale for 99¢ and it's definitely worth it for that price. It's one level that goes as long as you can stay alive. It's a genuine arcade style game.

Woah Dave! tries to be a ""arcade Classic game""-styled game to hit the highest score only - only thing: there is NO score. Insteed of score, the game counts how much ""coins"" you collected, which is pretty hard as longer you play. 

The game is easy placed, it self says you chould best play it with a PSone or Xbox controller but if it should be a ""classic arcade game"" i was about to use my old joySTICK which sadly didnt work...

Also, the game feels anyhow as whould it try to be a bunch of old REAL classic games mixed
To the game play self: You play Dave (so i guess) who pic up skull bombs or eggs to smash the alien(eggs). You collect the coins they drops and sometimes a ""WOAH!"" block appiers and you can use it to smash all on screen.
Also it gives only ONE screen, nothing more - it maybe changes collors but thats it.

Having that all in mind i thought about follow games:
Eggs destroying = Joust
Coins and WOAH block (which looks a lot like the POW block) = Mario Bros.
Level Style = feels like Super Creat Box

But anyhow, Woah Dave feels really boring after time, there is nothing new, just throwing and thats done. The most thing i hate is that you just need to touch the things and dave picks them up, mostly the things you dont want to pick up. there should be a button to take things and throw them. I often died coz i picked up a bomb i dont want.

Also, ""only"" for hunting coins, the game gets pretty quick boring and there is not much to play for, ones you played over or reach ""1.50$"" you can play in a kind of ""hard"" mode which doesnt makes more ""fun"" than the normal mode.

Honestly, its not worth the 5$ and looks more like a poor rip-off from the real good classic games like Mario Bros or like. There is no ""80s"" in this game...",1419246408,1488715484,False,0,0,0.459770113229751587,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Basically, I would say that if you have a strong fondness for early-to-mid-80s arcade games but wish they were a lot more difficult, you might like Woah Dave. Even then though, I think $5 is too much for what you are getting here.

The music is still the best part of the game, by a wide margin.

My original review is below, though it's mostly obsolete now:


[i]Even at $5, this is one of the biggest ripoffs on Steam. There is only one stage and one game mode. After 5 minutes of playtime, you have seen virtually everything the game has to offer. I paid $1 for it on sale, and I still feel like it was a waste of money. I can't remember the last time I played a [i]freeware[/i] game that was so limited in scope.

People say it's an arcade game, so it's supposed to be simple, but even arcade games have multiple stages, particularly games like Joust or Mario Bros., which are Woah Dave's closest relatives, gameplay-wise. Those two games are 30-plus years old now, and they both have far greater ambition and longevity than this one. I would be seriously astonished if the total development time was more than 4 hours, including art and music.

(Incidentally, the music is the best aspect by far. I wish they had included a full-length mix that we could listen to outside of the game.)

Even a basic level editor would've helped a lot, or some other kind of customization options, but there's nothing.[/i]",1419053038,1426253493,False,7,0,0.484915047883987427,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It is just Dave vs aliens. The game randomly drops one of two things from the top of the screen. Either an egg or a skull 'block.' You can pick up either one just by running into them and then throwing them with the throw button. There's a catch though. Both objects have timers. When the skull block flashes, that means it'll explode soon. When the egg flashes, that means it will hatch. Both mean death for Dave if he's holding either one.

You can throw the skull blocks into the eggs to smash them revealing a coin for you to collect. You can throw eggs into aliens to defeat them and leave a coin. While you're combating these aliens, the bottom platform is melting away with lava. Once the floor is gone, the lava slowly rises! If a green hatchling alien falls into the lava, it gets wooshed up to the top of the screen and turns red. Making it a fast alien. When the red aliens hit the lava they get thrown back to the top of the screen again. Then they are blue and can jump from platform to platform. If the blue aliens hit the lava again, they turn into Dave seeking eyeballs that can float through platforms. In a way it feels like Super Crate Box, without the guns, extra levels or extra characters.

Every once in a while a POW block will drop from the sky. When you smash it against anything but lava, it destroys everything, leaving a coin behind. What are these coins for? A high score of course! Its an arcade game! No points, just coins, which seems like a wasted opportunity. If you get $1.50 in coins, you unlock the bonkers difficulty level. Once you gather a certain amount of coins, the UFO will appear for you to defeat.

The controls are simple, jump and throw. The weird thing with this game is its gravity. It just feels like there is super gravity or something odd with how fast things fall back down. It doesn't play as well as other 80s arcade games.

There are no phases, its just one long level. You're in it until you use up all 3 of your lives. The real downside to the game is once you've played it for three lives, you've seen all there is to see. Except maybe the UFO. The level changes color, but there's nothing to unlock like new classic arcade games. It feels one dimensional. Mario Bros had bonus levels and a variety of different enemies instead of an evolution of one enemy.

If you can keep killing eggs as they spawn from the sky, it makes for a slow, tedious game. If you have a lot of enemies on screen, then it can make for some frantic fun. Then cap it off with a POW block to clear them out and go back to spawn killing them. There is only one song in Woah Dave, and its a great new wave sort of 80s clappy sort of beat.

There is a local two player mode where two of you on a single screen fight for to collect the most coins before time runs out. There are online leader boards showing the top 10 globally and your friends. For such fierce competition, the scores are far apart. Not just that, but some people have the 10,000 coin achievement, but no one on the global leader board to back it up.

I grew up in the arcade days where every three lives cost you a quarter, so the $5 seems about right. I can't imagine this fitting in shoulder to shoulder with the old classics or even the new ones. It feels like a hastily made cash in that needs some depth and extras.

The premise: You're Dave. As a child, Dave had no friends due to his quirky behavior, and so videogames became his only company. They filled his imagination and made every day an adventure. The floor was lava. Adults were alien creatures.

One day, Dave's parents realized he was no longer pretending. Touching the floor resulted in shrieking anxiety attacks and catatonia shortly thereafter. His tendency to pelt adults with breakfast food went from cute to terrifying once he developed the strength to put a classmate in the hospital with a hard-boiled egg.

Dave was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mental illness proved unresponsive to standard medication. He had to be involuntarily committed.

But captivity did not suit Dave.

Venture forth from the confines of the psych ward and take your vengeance on the aliens who seek to deprive you of your freedom and self-determination. But beware, getting too close allows them a chance to dose you with their sedatives. Three doses and you're once again at their mercy, your ears filled with the wailing siren of your oppressors.

Good concept
Now with fix, excellent execution 
8/10 Two thumbs up (I LOVE retro games)

Music is just OK vs the devs other rhythm style games but it does the job (my last review said the music sucked but I was comparing that to their other stuff)

The devs are super nice, and can take the bad with the good, and that my friends takes heart.

The game even starts saying ""dave recommends controller"" 

NO controller is needed, although I do somehow wish I could get an arcade pad on my pc for these type of games

be sure to tip your waitress, And get this game and all the devs games, If you love retro style arcade games you wont regret it

I’ve been a longtime fan of Choice’s BIT.TRIP series, and seeing how this is their first non-BIT.TRIP game since lilt line back on WiiWare, I was really interested in checking it out.

The gameplay is super-simple: eggs and skulls fall from the sky. The eggs eventually hatch into aliens, and the skulls eventually explode. Throw skulls and eggs at aliens to collect coins. Don’t touch aliens or explosions. Collect as many coins as possible.

With really simple, elegant gameplay like that, it’s perfect to play just for a few minutes. I tend to find myself playing for a lot longer, though… I dig it a lot.

Don't go in expecting a ton of modes--there's only one mode and then a harder version of it called “Bonkers Mode.” That might not sound like much, but what's there is really, really fun. Bonkers is the perfect word to describe the game. Managing everything going on all at once is really challenging and rewarding to pull off.

This being a one-screen indie arcade game, it’s pretty natural to want to compare it to Super Crate Box, but aside from the level layout, the two games play very differently. Woah Dave! is more like a crazy-fast version of Mario Bros. than anything—and any of you who have played the later stages in Mario Bros. know how much fun a faster version would be.

So yeah, very simple, very elegant, very crazy game—definitely worth checking out if you’re into the genre.
