Игнорировать их не выйдет - когда они видят игрока они подтягивают его к себе, но это нифига не значит что подобраться к нему будет проще - это значит что у игрока меньше шансов уйти от него, потому что два таких демона будут тягать игрока друг к другу расстреливая из гранатомета.

It's a procedurally generated ""RPG"" that has far too few variables to make that procedural generation meaningful. But let's step back for a moment. 3079 takes place on a planet consumed by war. Two factions have been fighting endlessly for seemingly no reason and it is your mission to figure out why and stop it. Who you are is never explained, nor is it explained why some galactic entity would care to intervene in a terrestrial war or why they would do so by sending in a single poorly equipped soldier. 

Once you arrive on the planet you realize that you have been cut off from communicating with HQ due to the actions of an army of demons that seemingly are the root cause of the planet's issues. So your mission is to destroy these demons. I'll admit to never actually destroying said demons so I can't tell you if that is the entire game or if more happens afterwards. 

On the planet you join with the humanoid faction and take on quests for their leaders. These quests are technically procedurally generated but they are so basic and pull from such a small pool of variables that it would be more accurate to say that there are about 5 quests that you simply repeat the entire game. The larger problem here is that the rewards are also random as are limitations like being unable to kill anyone. If you don't happen to like any of the variables you simply have to wait for a new quest to pop up or find another quest giver. This is infuriating as all quest givers (and all characters for that matter) look identical and have no names. So finding a quest that gives you whatever item it is you need to progress can be a nightmare. 

Of the 7 hours I played this game, five of them were spent trying to get a quest giver to reward me with the demon slaying sword you need to beat the demons. You cannot beat the game without it and there is no indication which of the randomly spawning (and unspawning) quest givers will give you the sword. After 5 hours of making no progress I eventually restarted the game and in 15 minutes had the sword I needed. So to summarize, the random elements this game is so proud of lead to boring, samey quests that can take hours to give you the items you need. 

Some of these items can also be purchased at shops but shopkeeper spawns are also random. Sometimes the only shopkeepers are fighting on the frontline of the war and combat does not stop while you are in a shop. Plus, again, all shopkeepers look identical and are not named, so good luck figuring out which shopkeepers you have checked in with and which you haven't. And of course their random inventories could mean that none of the shopkeepers have the item you need and so you just have to walk around killing enemies waiting for the current group of shopkeepers to be killed so a new batch can spawn that might have the items you want. 

3079 also allows you to build and destroy blocks like in Minecraft but there is no crafting system and I could not for the life of me find any real benefit to mining or building, especially considering your efforts would be quickly demolished by the ever ongoing war. 

Lastly, you have your stats and skills, which are improved through use, The Elder Scrolls style. You do not gain new skills as the game progresses, only level up the skills you have. So just play the game and level up while your enemies do the same. Pointless. I am moving on now to try 3089. Let's hope the developers used their experience making this proof of concept to allow them to actually make a fully featured game.",1639438615,1639438615,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I didn't check any guide or tutorial beforehand.

For the price, I liked it. The closest thing I played to this is Minecraft + Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel

However, the are some cons. Weapons like ETUs, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and shotguns feel useless and expendable. Maybe I didn't play the game the right way...

Increasing skills like stealing and camouflage are secondary in order to beat the game, and you can skip mining almost completely. However, at high level areas (over 20 in my case) advancing by digging a trench will be helpful. I've never used the grappling hook or the antigravity pack because my inventory was always too heavy. I intentionally cleared my inv in order to use the AV pack at the end of the game to beat the final boss.

For long range, you can switch between multiple precision rifles to attack targets (including imperial ships) from a safe distance and build up your energy. At mid/short range, a good blaster and an assault rifle will do the job, and at short range a high damage sword. Quests are OK given how long the game lasts.

First off id like to say that ive had this review hidden away in my head for ages because i had to fully formulate my upmost anger for this soggy sack of garbage you see before you. 

after reading the reviews and noticing that SOME of you continued to buy this digital filth. im going to sum up this cancerous waste of data.

DO NOT BUY THIS! do not even get this if it goes on sale or becomes free. this game was made at the behest of its Frankenstein like creator to cash in on the ""voxel"" hype after Minecraft started to kick off. it features a randomly generated limitless world where you mine resources and use those resources. to build things. while this type of game is a wonderful genre and has spurred many great ideas, this charred idea is not. it features a boring lack luster universe where you are dropped in, now i admit these types of games drop you in without objective other than survive, BUT this one, oh this one had to add more. they add in a ""expose"" story idea where you're sent here for peacekeeping purposes. until you are shot down by not one, not two, but three devil things that awkwardly fly in the air.

Once you reach the bottom  and stand up to view your horrific multicolored tie dye world. you are met with AWFUL samey styled enemies who instead of making different styled or variety mobs, the creator has just slapped in 3 different designs and stretched them over the 3d blocky lazy models. besides this the guns,weapons, and even your ""fist"" yep your fist is a selectable item, is in 2 dimensional which doesnt make sense since your character model is in 3d! so the developer cut another set of corners making all the weapons on the lower end of the scale. YES i admit voxel games often use 2d rendered weapons instead of 3d, but the designs are just cardboard cutouts of PNGS the creator made on MS PAINT??

Okay so the graphics, we've established are terrible, okay not all games are graphics i admit, now lets see if this rough turd of a game has some hidden gems hmmm? NOPE we move on to the gameplay side of it, besides mining and collecting resources, we have an attempt at a mission styled system, settlements are placed around the planet which house the worlds horrid little reptile? humanoid? FISH? beings who all have the same cookie cuttered skins where the colors are off just a bit. they speak to you, in text boxes which describe the mission data, okay so you do missions and get money cool cool cool, EXCEPT theyre the same missions, id say i saw maybe 10 missions? all with the same go here shoot this, go here get this go here protect this, the same damn missions. if you HAVE a mission system, one the world must have some unique areas to do them in, two the missions must be UNIQUE TO THE AREA IM SORRY BUT NOT EVERY TOWN IS GOING TO HAVE SHOOT THIS MISSION OBJECTIVE. 

IT just feels like the developer made this game after he saw voxels getting popular, said ""i can do that"" and made this. there is no uniqueness no change in anything in the game, the areas are all the same, each town has the same 4 to 5 buildings, interfaces and buttons are plastered on like pictures while stairs are a concept that this planet never invented instead using elevator blocks with big freaking arrows on them. it insults the user who buys this game. a planet sized area to play in should feel unique, if i walk in a certain direction i should see more and different things. you should have just made the one area instead of copying and pasting it ALL OVER THE PLACE.

to this day. the developer has released more sacks of garbage, including 3089.4089 which are the same game, with more 3d rendering which looks like a 90's reboot of the show reboot. 

In my Honest opinion do not buy this game, go buy something else, its just a waste of library space. they would not let me return it so now im stuck with this sack of old napkins in my library cackling like a mad old man because i bought it.

As well as its too easy to fail quests in the beginning if you don't know what your doing, once you do get to a certain level you can head out farther into the world and the creatures will get harder but it's only necessary to finish later main quests that require certain levels. But once you finish them you can go back to the easy parts with all decked out gear from those parts and beat the rest quite easy. There is s o m e  type of story but it doesn't go far with it.

To this day its still my favorite game in phr00t's lineup, its a real gem of a game, a mix between Borderlands and Terraria (some will say Minecraft instead of Terraria but i never played Minecraft so i cant argue either way).
Surprisingly the game is still as addictive today as it was several years ago.

Its an open world game. 
Its a first person shooter/melee (you can use melee weapons and tools too).
It has decent rpg elements, you can level stealth, stealing, charisma, mining, engineering (crafting), strenth and energy.
The itemisation is really great, and the fact you can expand it with an interesting upgrade system (engineering/crafting), makes it even more satisfying than Borderlands or Diablo.

You can mine for resources (and a lot of the environment is destructible), you can build a decent amount of stuff (bases, storage, home teleports, elevators).
Can get plenty of quests and information from the npcs, can get followers who will help in combat, can get on friendly or hostile terms with factions.

It has various elements of a fun game, but if you're planning on playing it alone, just don't. It's best to grab a friend and laugh at how terrible it is.

The gun spread is nearly intolerable at times, the controls are difficult to figure out, the NPCs are quick to hate you because your spread hit one of them that one time and now they think you've changed sides, you lose 1 item on death and if you haven't gotten a few backups of everything, it will make your game unplayable (such as a weapon, battery, generator, and a jetpack).

Oh, and sometimes the red demons will spawn on the ground, killing entire swathes of NPCs and you if you don't get out soon enough. You can't kill them until you get a Demon Slayer, which is only given to you from certain quests (or when you complete 5 quests). So basically, you're going to lose your main quest givers and shops really early.

If you plan on sticking around, get a mining drill. You'll sometimes find gems to sell. After you get half-decent equipment, ditch the drill. It'll be too slow.

Your easiest quests will be to 'defend' an informant for 3 minutes, because they will never be attacked. It will give you a moment to just chill and take stock of your situation. Your hardest quests will be either covert assassination or getting a Holocube undetected.

The flying vehicles are fun enough. I like to hijack them. Nine points out of eleven, would fly again.

Your crosshair is very reliable... if you put it a bit to the LEFT of your target. Seriously, that's where your aim is centred.

Building is a joke. Just don't even try.


Overall, you can only enjoy this game ironically. Don't even try to enjoy it legitimately.

Крафт отсутствует.

Но зато - весьма приятный шутер с элементами RPG. Случайно генерируемый мир, задания (всего несколько типов, но награды - всегда разные и зависят от уровня локации) и проблемы на вашу шею. А также: возможность прокачки различных характеристик и навыков игрока, поиск более мощного оружия и надёжной экипировки (путём торговли, воровства или убийства), захват шустрых вооружённых истребителей.
Сюжет. Да, он есть. С завязкой, развитием и завершением. После конца сюжета игра закончится.

As much as I love 3089 and 5089, nothing quite captures the surrealist atmosphere and intricate cities like 3079.
When I first played 3079, I was dropped straight into a dystopian Scifi world, literally! You fall from the sky and get attacked by demons who have taken over the heavens! You can either die and wake up inside someone's house nursed to health (which is what happened to me) or you can evade the demonic forces and use your wits and your jetpack to land safely on the ground, while the face of the world is being altered by constant faction warfare.
Call me nostalgic, but 3089 and 5089 just don't capture the same vibe for me, and as much as I enjoy 3089 and 5089, they are very ""Arcade"" in comparison to 3079, which has cities that light up at night, giants that patrol the streets, with giant walls preventing anything from getting in or out, which of course you overcome with your trusty grappling hook.

3079 also features bases in the sky you can raid and take control of, and you can also change faction relations depending on who you are attacking! Want to switch sides? Shoot humanoid Humoids and start working for the arachnid Neanders.

Bases are distincted by the colors used on specific lights, which gets the job done, but a lot more could have been done. Buildings overall have much more interesting layout than in 3089 or 5089 which are based more around outdoor combat with hoverboards and attack ships.
While there are Attack Ships in 3079, the controls are not as polished as in 3089 or 5089 from what I've experienced, though I don't fly much, because I usually crash.

While the visuals for 3079 aren't much to look at, they really drive home the rather alienating and surreal atmosphere, and the voxel-based environments allow for destructible environments and terrain, akin to Minecraft and the like.
I have yet to blow holes in buildings, but I've certainly dug a few holes with high-powered explosives, something I have not done in 3089 or 5089.

There's a few notable differences in gameplay and theme, but the guts of what's going on here is still deep in minecraft territory.

While Minecraft is a notable success in part because of it being part of the now flooded survival genre, 3079 eschews survival for a more traditional RPG which, if it was any other game, might have worked out well.

Gameplay: You generally have to figure out the game yourself or watch youtube videos/walkthroughs to get started on questing.  The plot is hammy and slapped together and none of it really makes a lot of sense.  Thematically it just misses every mark and fails to hook you into the RPG side of things.  You do collect a bunch of different items and instead of wandering around in procedurally generated hell, you run around in half finished lazy developer hell. 

Graphics: Terrible... the game does run in 4K but it's still very amateur.   Minecraft mods show that voxel based games don't have to look ugly, so the ugliness here is because the developer was lazy, unskilled, or deliberately wanted to make the game look bad.  What sticks out even if you want to humor the developer being ""artsy"" is poor design language - some textures are great (so probably stolen from someone) and others are hideous.   Fonts and interface styling is all over the place.

Technical - controls are clunky, but it does work okay with mouse and keyboard.  Graphics options are limited, which is a shame because that would have been some easy marks for the developer to try hide his lazy effort on the quality of the artwork.

Just buy Minecraft and mod it if you want a voxel game.  Play Ark if you want a survival game.  Play Skyrim if you want an RPG.   Those are just examples - there's so many games better than this.",1468945815,1468945815,False,2,1,0.423624724149703979,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm an old gamer that has been around before PCs used DOS, and I still can't get over this game.  I got this game on sale this week at $0.49 and it is worth a whole lot more than that.

I've been strafed by two planes at a time.  I've been fired upon by a Flying Fortress in the heat of multi-squad battles, exploded the Fortress with my AI buddies while it was doing a bombing run over us and it crashed into us with a huge explosion, forming a real time crater beneath us while doing so ... and lived.  Now, I don't know about you, but that's about as good as it gets.  Who needs a combat MMO when you can play this with AI and no internet connection?

Do the game's graphics look a bit like something out of the Stone Age?  Sure.  But this game takes Combined Arms to the limit.  You were told there was a violent war going on, well they weren't kidding.   The whole terrain is littered with pits, craters, used by some as fox holes and others seem to be having moments of extreme war fatigue in them, and you'll join them soon enough.

The first couple of hours you'll be wondering what the heck is this thing called 3079.  You'll feel like a poor rube who somehow got caught up with the resistance, but you don't even know what a war is.   When you land, night and day changeover quickly.  The nights even from the starting town, have not only the sounds of flak and gunfire in the distance, but you can actually see the tracers and explosions of vehicles and men out there beyond the town's fortified walls and above the tree tops.  And those tracers and explosions are the real deal, that's actually happening out there.  They are not canned ambience tracks or graphics for effect, it's the news come to life. Yep, this is one wild ride.  It may sometimes look like a throwback, but few games give you an experience like this of war.  You'll be confused, out-flanked, cowering in fear -- and then slowly but surely you'll get your bearings, start looking for battle and heading out to the action, using buildings and terrain as best you can.

The game has things which annoy.  The lifts are easy to get momentarily stuck on, just back into them and adjust so your back is fully to the lift blocks and away from the edges and you'll be fine.  You'll be bumping into the roof on the highest level, but you'll figure that out.  The ""Demons"" in the game are a pain to deal with, pulling you towards them with some unknown telekinetic power and attacking everyone, friend or foe.  But once you get some Demon Smiting Swords via Quests, you will have a solution.  There are a few too many buttons and nothing is that well explained, but that's why I wrote a basic tips guide for newbies in the forums, in case the videos on the game, which are really terrible, don't get you over the hump.  You can also talk to npcs that aren't giving quests or aren't merchants for a random tip or two. 

Ever wanted to be an astronaut/soldier/special forces guy sent to investigate war on a planet and try and stop the war and bring peace?  Neither have I?  But that's what you are up to here, but good luck getting there in one piece. Do yourself a favor, on the launcher menus, choose Easy Mode, it's still exciting as heck, and you'll still die enough to learn to respect the game.  Also, up the FOV to 115 or so, in this game the camera positioning really needs it and you still we be caught broadside from your flanks easily enough.

For those of you looking into this game, I've posted a basic starting guide to help on the forums.  I'll probably move it into the 3079 Guide section later on.

All I can tell you is that most of the YouTube videos are made by people who have no idea of how to play a game and on early beta versions.  You can catch some of the early excitement, but good luck getting any tips on playing the game.  For example the following things said in some videos are wrong.  The game can't kill steal, you up your stats by overloading any action of that stat.  Test your limits to improve, it's not that confusing. So overload and empty your energy in your batteries, you may up your total energy.   Overload your inventory so that the weight is too high, barely walk that way and soon you get extra strength, and by soon I mean in a matter of 10s of seconds.  Think of overloading a skill as leveling and improving by necessity. The game is cool like that as it wants to promote the way you decide to play.  

I actually enjoy this game more, so far, that 3089, even though 3089 has more polish and a lot less seemingly irritating things in its GUI.  They are similar.  But the gravity of the situation in 3079 is a lot more tense, you are a lot more confused from the start, and combat is almost visceral in that weird alien way.  Just forget the graphics and experience what is going on, and you'll probably end up enjoying it as much as I do.  3079 is more raw and brutal than 3089 and on sale for $0.49 it's worth taking for a test drive.  Learn to survive, because if you think simple graphics makes for an easy game, you don't know Phroot.  To get past the initial confusion, however, is going to take at least 2 hours.  So, if you wish to be protected by the Steam Refund Policy, I suggest you read a basic guide and maybe look at a couple of videos before you play.  Or just buy it on sale next time and stomach the two bits you paid. If you can get past the graphics, you are in for one hell of a ride.

On top of that, the game has night vision goggles, allows you to build fortifications, you can use a grappling gun to climb buildings, ride and jack into airplanes.  It has suspended flying cities in the atmosphere.  You can teleport, you can cast effects on your enemies or yourself using Transfer Effect guns.  You can capture towers via hacking the enemy computer in enemy towers if on a quest.  That's just what I've learned and experienced so far.  It has a ton of different weaponry, heavy guns, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, explosives, grenade launchers, jeez.  All of them have the potential to have additional modifiers on them to stats.  A lot of them don't really make sense, since when you equip your weapon you can't mine for example, you need the mining tool on you, but still it's like Diablo 2 met Battlefield on a crucial Hill 49.

Highly recommended, if you can get past the graphics and first 2 hours. If you can't get past the graphics, I recommend you take a look at 3089 and 5089.  Those games have a better user interface, much fewer irritating issues, and look better.  They are easier to get into since more info is available in game as tips and help.

Surprisingly, the only similarties are the blocks, and the building system, which you rarely ever use. I'd compare it to games like Strife instead.

The game isn't very friendly to newcomers. You start out in this giant space with lots of broken, chipped astroids. Only after watching a video, do I realize you have to float downwards in order to get to the planet. The game still isn't easy after that. Enemies take a lot of hits, and guns don't seem to be accurate. And waiting for guns to recharge after shooting takes a long time. [spoiler] Buy the grappling hook early on. It will help a ton. [/spoiler]

One of the complaints I have with this game is that you move way too damn slow. Thankfully, this can be fixed by purchasing speed generators and speed upgraders with in-game credits you earn by either selling loot found from carcasses of your enemies, or completing quests. This is thankfully, improved in the later games where you can now sprint at the cost of not being able to shoot your weapon.

This game is also surprisingly well balanced. Hell, even the difficulties are balanced. Easy mode makes you dish out more damage, at the cost of your energy replenishing slower than normal mode. A quip I had with most AAA games (Looking at you, Halo.) is that if they have some sort of cloaking device, you can only use it for around 30 seconds before you're uncloaked, which is annoying. Stealth is about patience, waiting for the enemies to move in a certain spot so you can take them out without alerting others. When you're forced to panic kill an enemy because your cloak ran out, it's not fun, and just feels tedious. In this game, however, the cloaking is balanced well; Cloaking makes you move slower, and you cannot regenerate energy while cloaked. However, you can cloak for as long as you want. This is what cloaking in games should be.

The graphics are pretty bad, but it IS an indie game made in 2011, so you do have to give it some rest. Graphics don't make a great game, evidently, shown by here. I have had a few graphical glitches (invisible textures) but they rarely occured, and didn't ruin the game experience much.

The steam run does not start up the game itself, but rather a bat file that loads up the options menu. This means that the game cannot use steam overlay. I suppose it's easier to run the game this way, I guess.

Pros:
+Fun gameplay
+Randomly generated; It's different each time you start.
+Game is quite challenging.
+Grappling hook is great.
+Trading cards
+It's cheaper than beer.
+Can run on a toaster.

Neutral:
*The game is not forgiving to newcomers. This may make it more challenging to others, but it's not exactly for the casual players.

Cons:
-Guns are incredibly inaccurate. I believe this depends on the gun itself you pick up.
-Graphics are poor, but it is an indie developer making this.
-Graphical glitches.
-No steam overlay.
-Only a few songs in the game. One of them sounds pretty good, but the others are royalty free songs.

Would recommend? Yes.

That couldn't have been further from the truth.

3079 is a procedurally-generated voxel-based world, much like Minecraft, but aside from occasionally breaking down blocks, that's where the similarities end. Everything else is just as the title says -- ""Block Action RPG."" 

The majority of the game is spent acquiring new quests, obtaining and equipping/selling items, fighting enemies, and retrieving objects -- all of which are fully randomly generated. Everything in the game (and I mean EVERYTHING) is generated procedurally, and while this never creates any particularly memorable characters or items, it does mean that on occasion you might stumble upon some pretty great rewards, interesting landscapes, or intense quests completely by accident.

I'll just come out and say it.... Graphically, this game is ugly, and by that I mean most other games I've played suddenly become eye candy. That being said, something about the horrible ugliness is genuinely charming. These two-legged ""humoids,"" four-legged ""neanders"" and bright red demons are all wonderfully childlike in their portrayal, with simple dollar signs and stars on the bellies of vendors and commanders, respectively. I thought the simplicity of the graphics would put me off, but after about fifteen minutes of gameplay I fell in love with the world.

And gameplay is really the redeeming factor here. No, the stat system doesn't make sense (and is mostly based on failures rather than successes), the leveling system doesn't make sense (your level is determined by the highest-level creature you've killed), and the vehicles are merely a switch from walking to flying with the image of a ship HUD plastered across the screen. But damn, is it fun; I had more outright fun with this game than a lot of the AAA games I've played in the past year. In one particularly exciting moment I was charging into the skies after a demon ship, blasting away (weakly) with the ship guns, when a nearby demon annihilated my ship. I started falling through the sky and in a state of panic pulled out my grappling hook, aiming at the nearest thing -- the demon ship. As I flew forward I let go of the grapple and switched to a rifle, sending the ship into an explosive oblivion as I soared through the debris, curving downward toward the planet. ""This,"" I thought, ""is fun."" Just pure and simple fun; it doesn't take a 1000-person team and a $60 million budget to create fun.... Just a developer named phr00t and the patience to give his game a chance.

This is one of those rare games where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. On the surface it looks like what you might expect from a one-man indie game (an ambitious one, at that), but if you give it a serious chance and try to beat the game at least one time (a two or three hour venture at most), you'll find yourself enthralled with this creative rendition of the future.",1468295344,1468295344,True,2,0,0.502334237098693848,0,True,False,False,False,,,

At least that's what you’re told to do but upon landing you instantly pick a side of the conflict and work as a mercenary for hire. The species friendly to you at the beginning are the humanoid looking aliens but you can switch sides by killing enough of them to please the other side. It may seem like a good idea to immediately head out of the city and hunt some aliens but as you will soon find out they are soldiers that only know war while you on the other hand are the space equivalent of some random dude running off to the battlefield with a Nerf gun. You will immediately realize how useless you are at fighting at the beginning and it is an important lesson to learn since dying means losing a random item. I say random but most of the times they seem to take away your grappling hook or your most used weapon. 
 
It is a really rough introduction to the game and even if you manage to knick a weapon off of an enemy killed by someone else you will not be able to use it. There is no ammo in this game, instead everything relies on your energy meter and the more powerful a weapon is, the more it uses. At first you may as well be carrying a broken gun as you will not be able to fire off a single round without it overdrawing your energy and harming your health. This game features skills like stealth, energy and charisma to name a few, which get more effective as you use them in a certain manner. Unfortunately the way to improve them are usually insanely tedious. You'd think that by using energy its stat will go up but the way it works in this game is that by using more energy than you have and harming your own health it will eventually increase. Since in the beginning you can barely fire off any rounds at all that means you will spend most of your early adventures staring at a wall and repeatedly firing just to get your energy up. Enemies regenerate health so by the time you have enough to fire again they will be mostly healed meaning you must use the better weapons with heavy energy usage. 
 
Honestly, this energy thing is what harms the game the most and will be a problem for the entire game as you need more and more energy. Stealing is pure RNG and requires you to get caught in order to increase its stats while being hit when you are camouflaged makes you better at Stealth. The progression system is a complete, nonsensical mess sadly and by that logic I'll become a mathematician by failing my math tests. Seems like a petty thing to complain about it but it is honestly no fun and means you only get better by either doing tedious things or getting shot in the face. The only thing you really get for killing enemies is their weapons to sell to a vendor later on. Vendors are the same as any other alien but with a ”$” symbol on their shirt. You could buy useful objects from them like grappling hooks, armor or generators that increase your stats while active. These generators can have some rather cool effects such as increasing your jump height enough to be able to jump houses and walls which makes you feel pretty awesome as you take down several enemies midair. 
 
You can tell any none busy ally to follow you around and gather up your own posse to hunt down the enemy if you so please. It is a really handy feature, especially early in the game when you are pathetically weak. The AI is not all that great so they are only useful in open fields, don't expect to be rescued while in buildings. AI is embarrassingly bad for the spacecraft that fight like if you had a giant magnet to your face and will stick right on you until one of you is dead. You can attempt to hijack which is a pretty cool feature and lets you zoom around the skies though it is rather weak and likely to get you killed if used in a fight. It's also a bad idea to go too far out as the further you go the stronger the enemies are. Along with the two species at war there are also demons that look like red gummy bears out to kill everything. These are a very annoying as they will pull you in near them no matter the distance between you two. They are not rare and it is not unusual that you have to fight with the controls just to escape their gravitational pull any time you want to go somewhere. 
 
Demons can only be killed by a very specific kind of sword which brings me with another issue. You can only equip 4 weapons or items to the hot-keys at any one time. The rest of your number keys are useless and you will always want to have the demon sword and grappling hook equipped so you only have two hotkeys to work with. This adds completely unnecessary micromanagement whenever you need something else like a satchel charge, your drill or your construction tool. You can mine the randomly generated world for gems though they offer very little money compared to simply scavenging guns from a battlefield. This game does feature destructible environments but only with the satchel charge unfortunately. Building your own base is possible but ultimately pointless as the point of the game is to move further and further out into the map while staying in a low level area is useless. 
 
Grappling hooks in this game are a ton of fun to use and have a pretty long range making you feel like a mix of Spider Man and Rambo as you quickly navigate the environments. There is an anti-gravity device that allows you to float around at the cost of not being able to recharge your energy. It is really useful for reaching the floating buildings and did lead to an insanely awesome moment where I was near death & surrounded at the edge of a cliff, jumped off and managed to activate it a few feet from the ground. 3079 does have its moments and incredible potential but seems to sabotage itself at every turn. Like the previously mentioned grappling hooks an anti-gravity device can only support a certain amount of weight from your inventory. It sounds reasonable enough but as you head to a higher level area which happens quite often, everything starts weighing more and more. That's not anything unusual in video games but it feels so artificial here where even the health packs start weight over 30 pounds. One area will have a grappling being sold with up to 400lbs usability and the next one will have one with 440lbs. You don't think “Wow, I can carry more now!” instead you're feel the need to facepalm as everything suddenly gets heavier in order to make your gear obsolete  time and time again. 
 
 You receive missions from allies with stars on their chest but they are rarely worth the price. There are main missions that revolve around the fight against demons and you will need to do at least one of those to get yourself a demon slaying sword. At the end of the day 3079 implements a ton of ideas into one package but fails to make the overall product fun. As an example you turn on your night vision and grapple onto the top of a tall tree with a sniper rifle to take down some enemies. Multiple things keep this from being fun. For one your night vision goggles only pick up enemies of a certain level so you will have to keep buying new ones every time you enter another area until you can't be bothered. Second your sniper uses up a ton more energy while using the scope yet has no added damage, so you may as well use it without the scope which defeats the purpose of a sniper. And finally, it is not unlikely there will be a demon in sight that will cause you to fight with the controls just to keep your footing in the tree even if it is far away and unaware of you. 3079 has a ton of ideas and a ton of heart no doubt but I'm afraid its progression system, annoying mechanics and combat heavily hampered by energy make this a game I simply can't recommend.",1461624240,1461624249,False,19,2,0.710095763206481934,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a somewhat difficult first person shooter with a bunch of RPG elements. Procedural generation and randomized aspects, such as algorithmic quests and unscripted faction battles that will certainly change the topography of the map, give the game a majestic feeling and some replay value. At that appraisal, I should have nothing but love for this game, but unfortunately it frequently dips into the realm of taking otherwise good ideas and implementing them in the most extreme, unenjoyable ways.

	For example, simply starting a new game is a matter of chance, as the starting equipment you receive may not match your play style, and it is very easy to die in the beginning of the game even with desirable inventory, often due to low-damage, low-accuracy weapons. Meanwhile, enemies get very accurate weapons that are often scaled far better than your own. 99% of better weapons can be found on dead enemies.

	If you survive your first several hours, you will discover that the difficulty and shop scaling is based on how far away you go from the initial spawn point. This makes some sense, to keep the player from constantly being bombarded by overpowered baddies, but it also turns the beaten paths into a tedious slog with little reason to ever backtrack, except maybe for a quest.

	The difficulty is the most noticeable problem, however. Apart from inaccurate guns, there is also the constant issue of rules that just don't apply to enemies, but do apply to the player. Enemies don't get hurt by their own explosions. Their ships never crash. Friendly fire is off for them.
	The biggest problem is the punishment for dying. Upon death, the player loses one random item, and this can absolutely cripple a character build if the item in question is particularly useful. For example, if I die and lose a powerful antigrav pack, which allows the player to fly, then replacing it with an equally strong pack requires a trip back to the intense enemy territory where can be found the only stores which sell items that useful. In the worst case I had, it was a 20 minute round trip. Long story short, the punishment for dying is really just that, punishment, not really fun or interesting at all. I did find a bit of a way to circumvent this, by filling my inventory with crap that I don't mind using, but, surprise surprise, I can't fly like that either.

	As much as I've complained about it here, this game is actually quite worth the money. It's addicting, and it provides a decent level of depth. There are the parts that make me want to tear my hair out, but that's balanced out by fun.",1459579945,1459579945,True,1,0,0.501553595066070557,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I gave up on the story after it asked me to take down a borg cube-lookalike demon ship with a flying vehicle that explodes after just one hit and me trying that for an hour. The demon ship requires like I-don't-know-how-many hits as it keeps healing back up and I can't avoid not get hit long enough while I evade enemy fire from multiple sources at the same time. I assume this is likely me doing it just wrong.

I kept walking West instead as I noticed earlier enemies become stronger if you keep walking, hoping to find a vessel that lasts more than one hit, but nope. I bought armor instead, did some of the neverending skirmishes around town, sold all loot I didn't need, walked West again, more skirmishes, shiny new weapon... and so on and so on, until... till after everything was around level 80 and capable of killing me in like two hits - that's because of the way your character improves: it gets better as stats and abilities are frequented. So, if you don't take damage from enemies as you move up in levels your max life won't increase. This requires you to stay in an area, work on your skills (as in take damage on purpose, for example) and only then move on.

It doesn't help when you think, you could just travel far for a shopping tour, come back and enjoy the game that way. Yes, you can do that but the progress remaining is the progress itself. If you can make it far and survive somehow in higher areas there's no point in going back as everything from back there is also right where you are - always. Except the little Minecraft-ish things you can build, like /home, chests, lamps and a few blocks. THAT does not move with you.

Then it came to me: This isn't going to stop, it keeps on rising, so yeah, 3079 is incremental!? I bet, someone already made a Youtube video of how far he could make it and end up in like level 3400 with 12400 stamina, or something. It wouldn't surprise me. If not, it should be made but I won't be the one doing it.

What I do love though is the grappling hook that turns you into Spiderman, tons of fun to use and the soundtrack is b!tching too. This kept me playing for a few more hours (as I was looking for plot) than just the two it takes to see it all.

If you decide to build... something, you have to find or buy a special item. Even if you don't want to build a house, it can be useful, because you have healing blocks, and turrets in the building section.
Missions have a small bit of variation, some you have to pick up an item, others you have to kill a thing, others you have to protect a guy, and they give various rewards, usualy money or weapons. Some you also don't want to be seen, and/or kill anything.
On the subject of stealth, you mainly use an invisibility... thing, and... ok, it's been a while since I played this. I never used this much tbh.

After restarting the save I finally figured out what to do, and it was honestly painful to keep playing.

To start, this game has graphical design of some really old game, like the original DOOM. It's 2011, why was it released like that? For a retro feeling? All it did was make everything look ugly! THe people look freakishly deformed, as the human generator just changes the design of the charaters by adjusting their BODY PART SIZES!

You can die in so many ways, it's impossible to play. The Enemies bigger than you, logically, can step on you. But there's no warning of that, you just GET CLOSE AND THEY DAMAGE YOU! YOu can Hijack the incredibly OP fighters, only to find they're made of paper and explode if you GRAZE the ground. Enemy Fighter, though, are made out of Hardened Titanium, because they can ram into you, and never blow up! Capital ships can wreck you with one hit, Demons suck you in and you need a special sword to kill them, ect.

Your guns? They use the incredibly stupid function of an ENERGY BAR in order to fire. This is absolutely the worst ammo Idea in history. You CANNOT CHANNEL YOUR SUIT BATTERY INTO A SEPARATE GUN THE MOMENT YOU PICK IT UP! This is one of the things that annoys me in Starbound, but at least THAT'S playable!

Quests are annoying as well, there can only be ONE active quest at a time, and if you die ONCE, no matter what killed you, you lose the quest. Terrific. What tops it off is that you lose a random Item every time you die.

The game's AI is terrible. If they're not swarming eachother, they are aimbotting their way to killing you. Diplomacy is out of the question, too, I haven't even figured out that!

Building is useless, you won't play this game long enough to build a longterm building.

Please keep in mind that this game is made by one person and is only a few dollars. So let's get to the pros and cons:

[b] Pros: [/b]
1. Nice difficulty curve - the farther you get away from the starting town that harder the enemies get, and the greater the loot gets. After you get some pretty good gear you upgrade yourself to fighting demons instead of Neanders (I think that's how you spell it).
2. Cards - They don't typically sell for much, but hey; buy a cheap game, get a few hours of gameplay and some free cards.

[b] Cons: [/b]
1. Lack of random encounters - sometimes you may see a spaceship. You can damage them, but I have never been strong enough to destroy it before it kills me. Other than that, it's just more of the same old enemies over and over.
2. Uninteresting quests - There are only like, 4 quests possible to take; Protect this herp, destroy that derp, kill that guy, hack this computer. That's literally all the quests I have ever seen, and with as many hours as I have on record, you would expect a bit more.

[b] Other comparisons: [/b]
1. Weapon types - if you want variety, you will be disappointed as there are very few weapon types. Sniper rifle, Pistol, Grenade launcher, Shotgun, Sword, and Demon sword (which is only for demons) are the only ones I can think of. Although you can install upgrade circuits into your weapons and armor to upgrade characteristics that apply to you character, which is actually kind of cool.
2. You better not ever accidentally shoot one of your own people, 'cuz if you do they all gunna keel you (It's pretty unforgiving). This can be fun though If you ever get bored you can always turn on your own kind and start stealing from people and become a nomad, so there's that (PS if you do this, there's no going back).

That's about it. Not a very big game, but if you buy it on sale, it's not too much and you'll have some fun. SO, expect that, a few hours of entertainment and some cards.",1419388800,1419388800,True,55,4,0.798861026763916016,1,False,False,False,False,,,

 When first starting this game you are a level 1 in every sense.

After killing more demons and completing more quests you will become even stronger and able to explore now. At this point the game is beyond amazing but you are not invincible.

3d modells look cheap and ugly. How can you take the game serious when they look like this.
Houses is as empty as a hollowed box.

A good game Interface is important. And this game uses a interface i would think would be ok on a alpha release but for a full release no no. For me it was clumpsy and ugly.

You start the game falling from the sky and die and reboot? You do missions delivered by a dude with a star? And its not really clear wich ones who give you a mission or wich who are enemies. Same modell but different colour yikes lazy.

If you enjoy open ended games with tons of replayability you have found a great game. 
First off I just want to preface this review with saying that I am fascinated with procedural generation in games. The univerese is a unpredictable place with random chance occurrences happening everywhere. It is unpredictability which makes life so diverse and interesing. 
In this game all chatacters, weapons and the world itself are randomly or procedurally generated. This creates a unique experience everytime you play. It also creates hilarious moments where unexpected things happen. 
Procedural or random generation is a two sided sword. Because of the random generation, the game experience is not always balanced. Sometimes you will get your *ss handed to you by powerful enemies, sometimes you will find a item which gives you an enormous advantage. The random god giveth and the random god taketh away. 
I think a good way to judge a game is similar to judging good music. Does it make you experience emotion? In 3079 you will experience every emotion in the spectrum. Happiness when you take out a huge enemy capital ship or find a very good unique weapon. Anger when you see a demon hacking up your fellow humoids, Fear when a demon is pulling you in and you don't have a demon smiter sword and you are over your weight limit on your grappling hook, Exiliration as you fly from mountaintop to mountaintop with a combination of grappling hook and antigravity pack. Pride when you build a inpenetrable underground fortress or capture an enemy building and see your fellow humoids come to inhabit it. 
My suggestion is to not rush through the game and see how fast you can beat it but to take the time to learn the different styles of gameplay and explore the emmense world created for you.
This game is very underated. Most of the bad reviews are from people don't have the patience to learn how to play. You have to be selective in choosing your gear in this game by paying attention to the stats as they vary dramatically. If you just run out into the world with out a strategy you will be slaughtered just like the people who give up after 20 minutes of playing on many of the let's play videos on youtube.",1410896432,1410896585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'll go in depth a bit:

Pros:
-Fun gameplay, and interesting leveling system. The farther you go from the center, the stronger enemies get, and the more powerful drops become. You can level up skills by using them, and add mods to weapons. There aren't a crazy variety of weapons, but there are enough to feel like a full arsenal.
-The world generation makes for interesting designs. Nothing mind-blowing, but I did enjoy the flying bases.
-NPCs come in varieties, can be different sizes, can fly, can be big or small, can be friendly or hostile, and can be traded with or recruited.
-Airships in the game are balanced, even when going against one on foot. They can fly fast and shoot fast and hard, but are slower to turn and aim and are fragile.
-The demons and capital ships are annoying, but add a good amount of challenge to the game.
-The final boss was good. No spoilers.
-The music and sound are appropriate. They're nothing too special, but they match the game and are clean.

Cons:
-My biggest complaint is the death system. On dying, you lose one random item (forever), all NPCs are cleared from the area, and you're revived. The item could be something valuable like a jetpack or a demon sword, making it feel like all the work to get the item was for nothing. Also, if you're in a hostile base, enemies may still spawn nearby, meaning if you charge into a base over your level, it is possible to get blocked in for a bit.
-There's a building system, but it's not too important, especially since improvement means travelling to far away lands, so it's easier to carry all your stuff with you.
-Speaking of carrying stuff, the weight mechanic is pretty tight, so a full equipment set will likely take up most of your jetpack (or sometimes player) carrying capacity, meaning looting trips usually end early.
-Melee is a bit wonky and it's hard to hit enemies sometimes, which especially sucks for demons since they can only be killed by melee. Luckily, they tend to get swarmed and stand still a lot.
-The penultimate boss kinda sucks. I won't spoil it, but I will say that flying a ship while surrounded by demons that can't be killed by ships doesn't make for fun combat.
-The graphics are...not the greatest. You can see for yourself.

My final score is a recommend, especially since at under $10 it's a pretty good bargain.",1409132769,1637227972,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Unfortunately, my experience has not been very good. Initially, the game would not run, and required 2-3 reinstallations from Steam to ensure it would open as expected. Once in the game, there is not a lot in the ways of a fluid or organic flow to the game. You sort of just walk around, hoping to figure out things as you go before you die.

The first time I played this game, it seemed interesting and quirky. I got some gear and a quest to bring an item to another NPC. To do so I had to shoot the NPC just so he'd come low enough for me to give him the item, as he was a flying guard. I should have known that this would be one of the less aggrivating parts of this game.

I started a new game and played for about half an hour. During this time I died five times. I never completed a single quest, and so I made no progress whatsoever. I would explore the different buildings, breaking wooden crates to sell the material right back to the vendors in the same buildings. I would finally have enough to buy an item or two, or sometimes found items while exploring, but none of them seemed to make a difference.

The quests I tried to complete are as follows.
""Destroy the capital ship."" The small pistol I had bought seemed to have no effect until I got close enough for the ship to open fire on me and reduce me to a fine red paste.
""Protect this Humoid for X seconds."" I made it over to the target fine, and things seemed to be all right. Until a hostile flying ship flew over and hammered him into the ground before I could even pull my weapon out. And then it killed me.
""Kill X Neanders in X seconds."" This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't standing in the middle of the Humoid city, and there's no sprint mechanic. With a little abuse of the grapling hook, I was able to quickly hop the nearest wall and went to fight a Neander. This one, the only one in the area, happened to be considered a 'giant' and so was doing ridiculous damage to me. I had previously lost my pistol to a death, so all I had on me was my melee sword.

The only time I maybe killed an enemy? When I was on one of the floating buildings, apparently owned by Neanders, and used stealth to hit a guy. The knockback tossing him off the edge of the platform; I have no idea if he actually died or not, because a shopkeeper in the same building quickly killed me again.

I'm sure the game might be worth $6.99 to some people, but it's just too tough for me, and I played on the 'normal' difficulty. After the time spent to make zero progress today, though, I don't really see myself playing it again. All in all this game seems like an interesting idea, but it feels like the ideas they put forth - RPG elements, material harvesting and crafting, science fiction storyline - are all handled much better in other games.",1406564976,1406813042,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 초라한 그래픽과는 달리 꽤 재미난 게임인데, 육성하는 재미와 루팅하는 재미 때문이다. 여러 종류의 무기가 있고 각각 다른 성능을 발휘하는데, 그런 특징이 무기 이름의 수식어로 나타난다. 이런 점은 [Borderlands] 시리즈에서 착안을 한 것 같다. 여러 무기 중에 성능에 따라, 취향에 따라 골라 사용하면 되는데, 원거리 무기의 탄환은 ""에너지""를 이용한다. 이 에너지는 공중부양에도 쓰이고, 은신에도 쓰이기 때문에 잘 관리를 해야한다. 그렇기 때문에 자연히 에너지 소모가 큰 무기는 사용하기에 답답해서 잘 안 쓰게 된다. 

 업그레이드 부품도 있어 장비들을 강화할 수도 있고, 건설 아이템을 이용해 건물을 지을 수도 있고, 터렛을 짓는 등의 활동을 할 수도 있다. 채굴 장비를 이용해서 지형을 파고들 수도 있고, 광물을 캘 수도 있는데 지형을 파고드는 데에는 한계가 있다. 주로 '전투'에 초점이 맞춰져있기 때문에 [Minecraft]와는 분리해 생각해야할 것이다. 

 보기보다 꽤 재미있고, 오래할만한 요소가 구석구석 있다. 하는 방법을 알게 되면 재미있게 할 수 있다. Demon을 소탕하는 주요 미션을 제외한 대부분의 미션, 전투 진행 등은 다소 반복적이고 비슷비슷해서 지루해질 수 있다. 에너지를 이용한 탄환 구조 상 속시원한 슈팅을 하기가 곤란하고, 이동 속도도 넓은 지형에 비해 느린 편이라 진행이 답답하게 느껴질 수가 있어 이런 부분도 아쉽게 느껴진다. 몇몇 아쉬운 점들이 있지만 그래도 보기보다는 재미있는 게임이라 플레이를 한 번 권하고 싶다.",1406474324,1406474324,True,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,False,False,False,False,,,

First off, I don't know if I would call it a role-playing game at all, it's more of an adventure FPS that has quests, equipable items, and skill increases...well, maybe that's enough to be an RPG.  Either way, the engine and music in this game are very good.  It's a very fun, sandboxy experience; however, as far as it being a game goes, it needs some work.  The game is in desperate need of a tutorial, and it takes quite a lot of trial and error to figure out what you're supposed to do.  Even after reading all the help menus and tips it took me three new game instances before I figured out to go into my inventory and turn of my jetpack to land instead of flying around aimlessly until I got killed by demons.  The quests are also recycled a lot and it's pretty difficult to get anything done without dying.

That said, if we don't look at this title as a game and instead look at it as a sandbox engine and tech demo I'm pretty impressed.  As stated above the music is *really* nice, and it's fun to play around in the engine for an hour or so (the grappling hook is my favorite).  There's also a boatload of settings to go through (anti-aliasing, field of view, completely customizable controls - always a big bonus!) and a pretty simple multiplayer feature that hosts a local server with the basic game client.

Although I'd pass on recommending this game (unless you're looking for a well put-together sandbox game engine) I'm impressed with what the developer has created so far and am looking forward to future, more gameplay polished releases.",1404668439,1404668792,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In the 90s, if you were a FPS, you were a Doom-clone. If you were a 1vs1 fighter, you were a Street Fighter-clone. Tetris-clones were everywhere. But then there was Dr. Mario, and Tetris Attack, and the block-puzzle genre was born.

Now that we got that out of the way, let's review 3079. It's a big open world with a randomly generated properties. There's a lot of the same. Once you've seen one building, you've seen them all. You're exploring and doing quests that surrmount to basic fetch quests. This is a game where you get out there, and shoot stuff and watch your numbers get bigger.

Good things:
-Lots of equipment options allow you to pick your stats and play the way you want.
-A fair difficulty. You'll probably die 1 or 2 times at level 1 but once you figured out how to get gear you can take on enemies that are 2 levels higher without to much of a problem.
-Many playstyles available. You want to be a thief? No problem. You want to fight with guns? No problem. You want to rush to enemies that are 100m away in 2 seconds and kill them with your sword? Good luck but no problem.
-The ability to place your own blocks. You can build your own house, storage and place several blocks that are both helpful in your home and on the field as long as you have the ingame money to afford that playstye.

Bad things:
-Horrible ai pathing. Don't expect the ai to be any good. You can yell at an ai when there is a straight path to you and they will still have difficulty reaching you. The movement of the ai is pretty much random making it difficult to aim. In general the enemy's make for easy targets while friendly's are mostly useless.
-Boring graphics. Even when it comes to block based games the graphics are not impressive. They are not bad enough to ruin the immersion but they definetely don't help it a lot.
-Very few options to customize your house. You have 2 types of building blocks, 1 type of door block and the only options other than that are home blocks and storage blocks. The only reason to actually build a house is to get protection from the demons but you might as well set up in an existing building.
-Many types of humanoids and neanders should just not be in the game. Many of them are way to big to do anything other than be a target or shoot a target. While there also are clearly jetpacks for sale there are only 2 types of neanders and humanoids when it comes to movement. The floating ones and the ones that never leave the ground.
-The map is pretty much useless. You can only set 1 waypoint at a time which gets removed when you reach it. Meaning that you basically have to write down coordinates if you're building more than 1 house or find something interesting. And even with the coordinates you're looking for a while because they only indicate a big area and not a single location.

My conclussion: It's a nice game to spend a few hours on every now and then but don't expect to play it for many days in a row. There are plenty of better games that you can buy for this price. Only buy this game when you have a few hours to waste and can't find a more interesting game to buy.",1395320816,1395322199,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There is not much to tell about the story, you were dropped on this planet to investigate life, and wound up left there to fight for your life.
I strongly recommend you go through a guide first because the game doesn't explain much at the start, nor throughout the game.

There are two 'races' in this game called the Humoids and Neanders, you start friendly with Humoids, but can become an ally with the Neander race if you start killing Humoids. There is also a third race aka the Demons, which are enemies to both races and can only be beaten using a demon smiters, which can be obtained by doing quests for leaders (they have stars on their body). So at the start of the game you might wanna avoid those guys, because you will die...a lot.

Enemies drop loot which you can sell for money (to merchants, they have $ sign on them) and buy better weapons for yourself. Best features of this game are a grappling hook, which is used the same way as in Just Cause, and an Antigrav pack, which lets you float around so you can avoid terrain obstacles. But both of those have weight limits and cannot be used after you pass the said limit.

Weapons are plentiful and everyone will find something they will stick to, from quick blasters, to shotguns and rocket launchers. There are also mini fighters in the game that you will use to bring down the big ships, but I found them a bit too slow for my taste.
As you fight you level up and increase your stats: Strength - carrying more items, Stamina - health, Firearms - weapon damage and Energy - used up for shooting, represents ammo capacity in the game). Skills you can develop include: Mining - getting gems to sell, Charisma - more likely for NPC's to follow you around, Engineering - efficiency of upgrading armor or waepons, Stealing - pretty obvious).

And one thing that annoyed me a lot is that every time you die you lose 1 random item from your inventory (so you can lose that awesome gun you just bought in a split second)
So to sum it all up:

+ satisfying shooting
+ grappling hook and antigrav pack
+ lots of fun

- takes a while to get familiar with the game mechanics
- losing an item when dying is annoying (you will die a lot)
- repetitive quests

[b]3079[/b]
主人公はある惑星に送られる。そこでは対立するHumoidとNeander、そしてそのどちらとも敵対する謎の勢力Demonの、３つの種による終わりのない闘いが繰り広げられていた。Humoid側として戦闘に参加する事になった主人公は、この戦争を終わらせる為に東奔西走する事になるが...


[b]3079を購入する意義[/b]
まずこのアクションRPGを説明するにあたって欠かせないのが、Minecraftを彷彿とさせる「ブロック」「ボクセル」の世界です。無限生成の世界はプレイヤーに飽きさせない驚きを与えてくれるものですが、このゲームにそれは当てはまりません。一応は荒野、雪山、緑地などのバイオームは存在しますが、似たような地形ばかりで新鮮味がなく、また点在する敵・味方の拠点は多くとも６階層程度の狭いもので、似たような色・形で変わり映えしません。アップデートによってGPS・MAP機能が実装されましたが、それがなければ確実に迷うほどです。さらにMAPは拡大・縮小などの基本的な要素すらないただの俯瞰で、空中要塞があると地上が隠れて見えないといういい加減さです。画面を戻すと高確率でロードが追いつかず地形がバグります。洞窟や遺跡など、RPGに欠かせない建造物群も存在しません。

プログラミングの甘さはこのゲームの評価を大きく下げます。NPCがブロック間に挟まって振動し、ブブブブという耳障りな音(連続ジャンプ音)を発しているのを見るのは日常茶飯事で、ひどい時には自分が敵と戦闘中に、敵と地形ブロックとの間に挟まれるとその状態に陥り、碌な抵抗を出来ないままに「ハメ殺し」されてしまいます。javaの使用という特殊なゲーム環境のせいでしょうか。BGMはよく途切れて無音になり、装備しているレーダの表示が消えたり、画面中央にある銃のポインタが突然なくなったりします。そして、必ず数時間に一回は落ちる不安定さです(自分は6回経験しました)。
[b]最悪なのはマルチプレイヤーがほとんど機能しないことでしょう。[/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/259620/discussions/0/648811852511022919/][u]フォーラムによれば回線やルータの種類の不一致によってエラーが発生するようで、開始することさえも出来なかったので仕方なくマルチプレイ中はHamachiを使用しました。[/u][/url]もちろんマルチプレイ時にも上記の落ち・音の不具合が起こるので、常時数重苦のなかでプレイする事になります。

リスポーンのシステムにも欠陥があると言わざるを得ません。特に序盤、非常に高火力な砲弾を雨あられのように降らすCapital Shipや、自分の操作キャラクターを吸い寄せる[spoiler]上にある武器を手に入れなければダメージを与えることさえもかなわない[/spoiler]Demonに遭遇し、死んでしまう事がよくあります。その際のペナルティーとして装備が一つ消滅しますが、リスポーンする場所があまりに死亡した場所に近いため、再び砲撃によって、あるいは吸い寄せられてリスキルされることが多いです。Demonの場合、吸い寄せられた先の地形によっては前述の「ハメ殺し」に遭うことも多く、当然貴重な装備を何個も喪失することになるため、イライラは募るばかりです。

他にも、短く淡白なストーリー展開、何処に行ってもコピペばかりのNPCの外見と発言、町の半分が水没しているような適当な自動マップ生成など、不満な点は数え上げていたらきりがありません。


グラップリングフックや戦闘機による三次元方向への高速移動、仲間からの盗難・味方の殺戮を繰り返すとNeander側と認識され、彼らの商人やリーダーと会話が出来るようになる斬新なシステム、スキルポイント制の成長要素、そして買い物や敵のドロップによって強い装備を入手し強くなっていく感覚。他にも武器の強化や砦の建設など、確かに”Block Action RPG”を形づくる意欲的な要素が詰め込まれているのですが、出来は非常に残念です。パスすることをおすすめします。",1394779635,1394779935,False,25,0,0.677413702011108398,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Partially because players are tasked with either killing an enemy without being detected (which is next to impossible in both the killing or being undetected portions), or being sent to acquire an item in the battlefield without killing anything (where ships seem to have a perfect knowledge of the players whereabouts, and drop immediately down to shoot them into a fine dust). Demons are also scattered about while trying to complete quests which allow you to actually harm them, killing you in the progress. Dying in the game results in automatically failing a quest, and losing a sometimes vital item from the inventory.

Minecraft with guns and a grappling hook! Like Just Cause 2 in Minecraft. What's not to love?

It is like Minecraft with guns made in Java. Before the developer was done with this game, he was already hyping up the sequil. This is great for a first time developer. It is a simple Minecraft with guns. The guns work well enough, the enemies are giant and easy to hit. When you die, that's it. You crash back to the launcher. Speaking of the launcher, that's the only way to adjust the settings. Including controls. This is probably the 2nd worst button configuration I've ever seen. You select what the key does, then you find the key from a drop down list. When you set a key, chances are it unsets another key that has nothing to do with the key you just set. Such as if I set something to use the 'Right Key' then I set something to the 'Enter Key' it will set the previous 'Right Key' to the 'F2 Key.' Huh? Again, this is clearly someone's first game.

With all that being said, the game generates a random world and yet always starts you suspended high above the ground in orbit, suspended. When you find out the gravity button to drop you from the sky you might die on impact. It is quite unforgiving. If you survive the fall through the use of the gravity button, you're immediately in hostile territory. Sometimes the floating red monsters will murder you before you even land. From the start, the guns are underpowered. When you run out of ammo, you start losing health when you shoot. An understanding of enemy levels would have been nice, such as a beginner enemy should take one or two bullets. Then as you progress they take more bullets and then you find better guns or upgrade so they take less bullets.

The only redeeming factor about this game is multi-player, but really, if you're playing with friends any game will be fun, because you and your friends will always have fun. That's why they're your friends.

There are far better FPS games, which this is a FPS. I can't even call it Minecraft, since there's not much crafting or world craftability as there is with Minecraft. I just can't recommend this game. It is also very telling when a game took so long to be Greenlit.",1392702250,1392702250,False,29,0,0.653490245342254639,1,False,False,False,False,,1393127028.0,"Thank you for taking the time to write a review, even though it is critical. However, I do want to fill in some readers:

1) When you die, you shouldn't ""crash back to the launcher"". I'm not sure if something is crashing on your end, but when you die, you should see a ""Press any key to respawn"" message. You'll respawn close to where you died with most of your character intact and not be brought back to the launcher.

2) You start in the air because you were approaching the planet & this is where the story starts. You can fall to your death if you disable your jetpack, but you can also turn your jetpack back on right before you hit the ground to survive. Keep in mind this is a ""trick"" to bypass the Demons (which is the ""standard"" start of the game). The ""trick"" is explained in the guide video.

3) 3079 isn't easy & I admit it has a learning curve. The starting enemies were not designed to only take one or two bullets. However, you start in a friendly zone (once you reach the ground), so you should have time to improve your character before meeting you first enemies.

4) When you ""run out of ammo"", you are running out of energy which powers your life support systems. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing since your Energy stat will increase to accommodate.

I'm also glad you can't call it Minecraft, because 3079 wasn't designed to be a ""Minecraft"" clone, although it does have some building features. Saying 3079 is a ""simple Minecraft with guns"" game is selling it a bit short, since 3079 was designed to be an action RPG with randomly generated items, quests, stats, story & skills to improve on. Guncraft is much better described as a ""Minecraft with guns"" game than 3079 is, in my opinion.

Anyway, good luck finding a game you enjoy!"

This game is definitely unique, when I first saw it I was really tempted to buy it, so it came on steam a year or two later and I had to give it a go. I'm sad to say unfortunately i wasn't particularly blown away, I got through to the end of the story, and I really wasn't interested in the game anymore. I didn't like the graphics, i felt they were just patchy and weird. I found the combat, maybe a little different because of the gun variety, but still to be a bit floaty and not so riveting.

Don't get me wrong, i never really cared about negative things, since they aren't as bad in this game, i felt it just didn't have anything really positive. Its a mediocore game that was slightly dull and a few strange decisions within the art style and gameplay. I felt everything was very clunky and nothing was exciting to see or do. I found the building capture missions quite clever and the stealth system doesn't exactly suck, just as said before, not to exciting.

I hope in the future the developers learn from their mistakes and make something more fun. I felt they tried to keep everyone happy and doing so dulling out their game. As a famous quote is said ""You can please all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time.""

But that's okay because it still didn't matter. It didn't matter which quest I took, I inevitately failed miserably, each death resulted in one less item and soon I was essentially defenseless. The final straw was a mission to sneek out and retrieve something without being seen. So I turned on my camoflauge (slow movement) and crept to the area. As far as I could tell there was nothing nearby it should be a cakewalk. I ended being blown up by ??? I don't know there was nothing there! I wasn't spotted (which would have ended the mission) before hand, I was just dead. But of course death ended the mission. This follows a series of equally inane and frustrating mishaps where I found myself slaughtered and useless over and over and over again.

А также: возможность прокачки различных характеристик и навыков игрока, поиск более мощного оружия и надёжной экипировки (путём торговли, воровства или убийства), захват шустрых вооружённых истребителей.
Сюжет. Да, он есть. С завязкой, развитием и завершением. После конца сюжета игра закончится.

Ultimately, there is enough of a cool game here for me to keep putting time into it.

The games name is strange, don't worry about it.  Here's what jumps out:  Action RPG.  The game is an FPS action rpg.  It looks like an ASCII Minecraft, but has all the ARPG symptoms.

XP grind?  GODDAMN RIGHT SON.  Your skills increase as you use them.  Pick some pockets dawg, raise that stat.

Loot? Yo, the big guy over there wielding a sword with fangs that one shotted the NPC from your faction?  You take his life, you take his blade.

""... But clizzy, this dudes sword SUCKS BALLS dewd!""  Yeah, it happens.  But you can sell that piece in almost any area.  Items scale with the enemies, who scale with the zone.  You're in a level 9 zone, the level 9 enemies drop level 9 shit that usually be sellin' for a pretty penny even when they are booty butter.  This is awesome because....

There's mad cool shit to loot in this game!  This is my favorite part:  your character can equip jet packs and grappling hooks that give you crazzzzzzzzy mobility.  You can fly into sky fortresses, or zip around the landscape with non-stop grapple shots.  Thing is, though, these bitches also scale.  Level 1 hooks/packs can be used when holding 40 weight, no more.  Every level adds an additional 40 lbs.   It's cool zipping into a high level zone, on a mad hunt for the shopkeeper or drop zone with the clutch twink grappling hook/jet pack.  You have to get out alive too, because when you die you lose an item.  The game is sadistic, it will eliminate the item you hold most dear.

I suppose I wish the game felt more complete.  I've put some goodly time into it and I'm not sure if there is anything else to do but loot grind.  The building mechanic?  No idea what's going on there.  Completely arbitrary, in my experience.

However, I have to say that I haven't got many quests done in the *main* story line.  There's a little bit of RNG involved with quest givers having to give you a specific reward to advance - it can get a little frustrating.   Hunting for the right people always devolved into loot grinding and murdering things.  This was really fun for a bit, and I'll probably sit down a few more times to see just deep the game goes, but it becomes nothing more than pure carrot-sticking.   Still hours of fun.

And you'd be right. This is the worst thing you've ever SEEN; but once you get to PLAYING this mess, you'll notice that it's actually really really fun.

Think borderlands guns in minecraft's world with quests and a storyline.

It's an infinite and destructible world like minecraft, with randomized loot like borderlands, and joinable factions like mount and blade (granted there are only 2 factions)

The reason I say that is because I feel that you’re either going to love this game or hate it.  Personally, I could not get into it.  I restarted the game about 12 different times, each time seeing if I had ‘missed’ something or simply didn’t understand the concept.  However, even after 12 times, I continued to scratch my head – wondering about the many facets of this game.

I really loved the music, it does a great job driving-home the ‘futuristic’ vibe of the game.  I also love the ‘mechanics’ to the game.  You progressively get better at skills in the game by doing them – don’t like your terrible aim with that rifle, then keep shooting at things (all the things!).  I also noticed that the game included skills such as ‘mining’ and ‘stealing,’ which is awesome!

Though, I believe what ruined this game for me was the story and setting; I think that’s what made me restart the game so times, too.  The, seemingly, inconsistent size of the NPCs, the strange location of buildings (yes, I realize it’s a randomly generated world, but there needs to be some consistency for an RPG), and the way items are distributed to the player (randomly generated on the ground, just sitting there or sold by a vendor – very inconsistent).  I tried to discover the reason, but it didn’t appear to be laid out anywhere obvious to the player, no in-game ‘books’ to discover with clues, no conversation with NPCs to help get answers.  The world needs to be 'plausible,' (not to be confused with possible) and the developer has not achieved that.

I feel that a video game has the same mark that books, movies, and television bear – these outlets have a very small window of opportunity to grab their audience, if they miss that window it’s gone.  For me, ‘3079 – Block Action RPG’ missed that opportunity, and I really wish it hadn’t.",1385602110,1385604202,False,299,7,0.753036379814147949,13,True,False,False,False,,1388087169.0,"Thank you for the review, even if it is critical. However, I do want to make a few points:

If you restarted the game 12 times & only played a little over an hour, that is only ~5 minutes a run, which will make it hard to get into. I recommend players allow more time to grow.

Also, a strong story usually isn't a staple of games heavily inspired by roguelikes -- I didn't want to be bogged down in having to find a plausible explanation for things that just made the game work a little better. For example, scavengers or players that are having trouble getting items will be very happy to find items randomly dropped in buildings (they shouldn't be found outside).

Finally, you'll find in the screenshots section, many people enjoy the variety in characters, which is admittedly at times a bit silly & more importantly, fun.

Anyway, feel free to check out the sequel, 3089, which you may enjoy more."

So it looks like Minecraft in space, spawning a whole lot of U RIPD OFF MINECRAFT posts in the forums. It does look like minecraft. But it is nowhere near a rip off. Its not even remotely the same game. Now dont get me wrong, I love Minecraft and have owned it since late alpha. So another similar-looking game isnt bad in my book.
Now for the review.

As I said, it looks like Minecraft. Its a procedurally generated 3d block game, where the world/items are different every single time. So big 3d blocks with texures, prodecurally generated huge maps.

But thats where the similarities end. Its a space-RPG for starters. And all the quests and stuff are randomly generated, as far as the quest structure, it runs more like Daggerfall (without the horrid bugs). You meet a group of aliens, who give you random quests and rewards thereof. Enemies are ""demons"", really tought things that fly through the clouds. They are the main focus and plot of the game. There are also other alien races. You run around getting quests and items, fighting bad guys, and trying to stop the demon incursion. Simple, really. 

Its fun and totally worth 6-7$, especially if you like that style of graphics.

Der Spieler strandet auf einem hart umkämpften Planeten, wo er den freundlichen Humoids in ihrem Krieg gegen die Neanders und böse Dämonen zur Seite steht, sowohl zu Lande, als auch in der Luft. Die auf Voxel basierende Grafik ist stark von Minecraft inspiriert und dementsprechend besteht die Landschaft aus Blöcken und ist extrem verpixelt. Ebenso können manche Blöcke zerstört und neue Blöcke oder auch Fahrstühle und bewaffnete Türme mit dem entsprechenden Werkzeug gesetzt werden, allerdings nur in begrenztem Maß, ist das Werkzeug aufgebraucht muss ein neues her. Das Spielprinzip erinnert stark an Titel wie Borderlands: Es gilt dutzende Items zu sammeln, darunter verschiedene Arten von Schilden, Medikits und Radars sowie diverse Arten von Waffen, wobei manche wie bei Borderlands durch zusätzliche Effekte entweder mehr Schaden austeilen oder dem Spieler z.B. durch schnellere Energieaufladung helfen. Auch das Levelsystem erinnert an Borderlands. Die Waffen verbrauchen keine Munition, sondern Energie. Je stärker die Waffe, desto mehr Energie wird pro Schuss verbraucht. Ist der Energiebalken leer, muss einen Moment gewartet werden, bis er sich ausreichend aufgeladen hat. Dem kann der Spieler durch das Sammeln und Aktivieren von Generatoren und Batterien entgegenkommen. Seine Aufträge erhält der Spieler von den sogenannten ""Leaders"" der Humoids, welche mit einem Stern markiert sind. Überschüssige Items können bei den mit einem Dollar-Zeichen markierten ""Merchants"" gegen Credits, die Spielwährung, verkauft werden. So findet man sich ratzfatz in einem absoluten Sammelwahn wieder, immer auf der Jagd nach noch besseren und schlagkräftigeren Items.

FAZIT: Man erhält hier viel Spaß für wenig Geld und Festplattenplatz. Für Fans von Minecraft und (vorallem!) Borderlands ist dieser Titel definitiv einen Blick wert! Vorallem aber auch, weil es durch sein Oldschool-Spielprinzip und die verpixelte Grafik an die guten alten Zeiten erinnert, als ein Spieler nicht nur kurz in Deckung gehen musste, um sich zu erholen.",1384631122,1384631122,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,False,,,
