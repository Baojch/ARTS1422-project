I praise art direction with a touch of gigeresque horror and 19th century freak show, all made of stunning pixel art. I must be fair and note that I didn´t finish it for the following reasons.

While I liked author´s previous game, Primordia (I even loved it), I got stuck playing Strangeland multiple times. I don´t know if it´s just me, but solutions feel extremely unintuitive. Story is vague from the beginning, and I never found an interest in it.

Wormwood first game Primordia was one of my favorite games the year it came out, and I´m a big fan of all Wadjet Eye Games selfdeveloped proyects and published ones, so I just launch myself into it knowing I could trust the devs and the publisher, and I couldn´t be more satisfy with the result.

Strangeland is the perfect name for this game about lost, self-harm, mental damage and depression, and I rather not discuss setting or story, ´cause this one of those you need to experience by yourself. It´s a PnC adventure that merges Wormwood style with what I can only describe as a ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream"" thematical successor where you are your own crazy IA. The writting, the voice acting, the art, the ambiance... it´s all astonishing and creates a completely unique experience. There´s a few obscure puzzles, but nothing too bad, I was mostly advancing the entire time, which sadly makes the game a little shorter (Around 3-5 hours depending on player), but I think it works well for the title.

There are some fantastic long discussions on the forums about interpretations of what everything meant in the game, and that alone should give you a clue about what you are getting into, like all good stories, it won´t leave you after completing it and you may even return to it like a good movie over time. Specially if you are experiencing some of the feelings the main character is suphering, despite the pictures and the impression it may be a deranged and tortuous scary game, it actually has a very positive outlook in the end and a very hopeful message if you get the good ending out of the 4 it has.

If you have ever enjoyed the works of Wormwood or/and Wadjet, I´ld say you need this one, cause it´s def in the top 5 and makes more excited about Wormwood future proyects (which I hope comes sooner than later).",1708178436,1708178436,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,True,,1708190018,"What a beautiful review!

- Pretty much the entire game your just listening to dialog about how sad the main character is, and how bad of a person he is. I love depressing stuff but this was too much to be enjoyable.

Да, сама игра выглядит стильно и вдохновлена творчеством Здзислава Бексиньского (даже есть прямые отсылки к картинам).  Да, всё это сопровождается неплохой атмосферной музыкой.

It has an Alice in Wonderland type feel and sometimes the story seems a bit generic (and sometimes the hint system gives too easy hints) but this is top notch stuff. There are some wonderful things that make it stand out like fortune telling, a clown with bad jokes (because I can't understand them), spirits, and a broken roller coaster ride.

У меня опыт в это жанре конечно скромный, но сравнивая с другими, уже пройденными играми от издателя Wadjet Eye Games (Primordia, Shardlight, Technobabylon), понимаю, что эта игра уступает им.

Мало загадок и мне они показались слишком простыми, мало запоминающихся персонажей (хотя, казалось бы, «сумасшедший» сеттинг располагает), мало локаций, даже с учётом того, что это сюжетом обосновано. Мало как-то всего: если другие квесты меня в целые миры погружали (и здесь не о количестве лора идёт речь), то путешествие в подсознание со Strangeland показалось относительно скромным.

Свои положительные моменты есть: отличный, стильный пиксель-арт и, как всегда, для Wadjet Eye очень приятно подобранные голоса – кстати, отдельное спасибо за «ворон» (воронов!). К тому же сама тематика игры позволяет оправдать любые и видеоигровые и даже жанровые условности своеобразной логикой сна. 

Но, понимаете, есть разница, когда ты действительно хвалишь игру, а когда пытаешься её оправдать. У меня нет отрицательных эмоций после прохождения и да, эта игра точно лучше какой-нибудь совсем уж простой и прямолинейной Tormentum. Однако, именно в плане рекомендаций Strangeland явно ближе к концу списка. Если только это самокопание (сюжет по-другому без спойлеров не опишешь) очень попадёт вам в настроение.

I would strongly recommend Strangeland, with the caveat that it will likely not appeal to those with a strong aversion to heavy symbolism or frequent literary allusions.

However, going into the details, it's much more... interesting.
It feels (and kind of confirmed in the developer commentary, too) that the creators wanted to evolve forward from what they had in Primordia, with the visual design, with the atmosphere, with the puzzles, and even with the game engine, which is mostly, but not quite, the veritable Adventure Game Studio. It also feels they went into overdrive in several aspects - the visuals of the game are nothing short of astonishing in places, there's practically no music but underpinning soundscapes, and the resulting ""baseline"" atmosphere is haunting, scary and rather oppressive. Combined with the dark, introspective story and the often desperate character interactions, the game draws you into its superbly immersive, and also heavily depressive world.
The only issue I have with the game are the puzzles - and with a point and click adventure, it's quite a big issue. I appreciate that the creators were trying to do something different from your usual adventure game fare, and some of the puzzles I quite liked, but the rest just didn't click with me. As a result, I was kind of stumbling through the game, did some progress for 10-15 minutes, then got stumped with nothing left to do (and bored with the continuous d-events), and was eventually frustrated enough to quit and do something else - only to return some time later and toil on. Strangeland is not a particularly long game, but this start-stop method of playing made if feel like an ardous experience. Which, to play the devil's advocate to myself, is quite in line with the protagonist's plight...
Despite my frustration with the gameplay (which, according to other reviews, is far from universal), Strangeland is not a game to be missed. The heavily veiled, yet richly detailed chronicle of our journey in... well, you'll find out, is worth the price of admission alone, and complete with the excellent visuals, it's one of the best told stories in recent video gaming memory.

Our character, whose name we don't know, finds himself in Strangeland - a place that lives up to its name due to everything in it being different and bizarre in some way. Even dying is not permanent and our character just returns back to the entrance to continue what he was doing, and that is to try and rescue a woman that is special to him.

Those who are into standard point and click games will find themselves at home here. Strangeland has all the common features of the genre - interactions with parts of the environment on every screen, multitude of puzzles, inventory for objects that can be used later and combined, and dialogue with NPCs in order to progress the plot. Most puzzles here have a logical progression, although at times it can be tricky to know what to do next as a few tasks might require some logic leaps. Thankfully, the game has a dial phone, where our character occasionally listens to someone who simultaneously guides us and badmouths us at the same time. This dial phone has a function to get a hint from said individual that can point us in the right direction, so it's a very nice addition that's much appreciated. Most of the game happens pretty much within the same few locations, and so backtracking here or getting lost is pretty minimal.

Perhaps one of the sections that was a tad annoying was a fight with a certain creature that I won't go into detail explaining. It requires usage of items with specific parts of the creature's body in order to hurt it, but you only have about 5 seconds to use the right item after each one, which means if you fail, you die and are brought back to the start of the area and need to walk to the place of the fight again and keep doing the trial and error. For a game like this where you have to scroll through items you have and where it's not immediately obvious where on the creature you can click, having this section be under a small time limit felt a bit irritating and didn't really add anything other than making us walk to the fight again and again.

As far as story, setting and characters, the game shines with creativity. And as can be expected, a place and plot as strange as this isn't going to explain everything, so you'll still be left with many questions even after completing the story. In that regard, I do wish the ending would've explained a bit more, as it feels a bit as though the game just said goodbye to me before I was ready to let it go. But, at least there are still enough small details in the game to make you think - little hints and signs here and there that you have to pay attention to and might miss the first time round. Perhaps this whole world is in the dark pits of the main character's mind and it's his subconscious way of coping with trauma, or perhaps it's some form of hell or purgatory or some other parallel dimension. Nevertheless, even in a dark and grotesque setting such as this, there are light-hearted moments and jokes full of dark humour.

The breathtaking visual style of environments and character designs and animation fits this unusual setting perfectly, which is full of surrealism and resembles the works of art by surrealist style artists. We really need more games done in this style! The music is generally ambient and not very noticeable. The voice acting is great and every line of dialogue appears to be voice-acted.

The game is kind of on the shorter side (a single playthrough should take around 5 hours or so), so you might want to get it on a discount if you prefer the length of the game to justify the price. But if you are a fan of point and click games or games set in very unusual worlds, then it's certainly worth getting.
And a big bonus is that the dev is very active on the forums and seems to be helping people when they have any questions or need help.",1700093017,1700093017,True,11,0,0.642015695571899414,1,True,False,False,True,,1700170764,"What a beautiful review, particularly your remarks about the story and writing.

I'm not going to write much about the story since almost everything could be a spoiler, but it's a psychological horror with an interesting look into the mind of someone who has suffered great personal loss. Presented in a twisted extradimensional horror carnival setting.

This was probably the greatest PnC I've ever played, which includes many Wadjet titles and Wormwood Studios' previous game (Primordia). It's very impressive how they managed to truly modernize the genre and other PnC devs really have been put on notice with this one. It's fluid, intelligently designed, has excellent pacing, a pretty gripping story, outstanding voice acting, amazing and evocative artwork, requires no work on the player's end to get it running, and has intuitive controls that work perfectly with both k/m and gamepads. It is also perfectly Steam Deck compatible.

If you enjoy Point & Click adventures, cost vs value is there and this should be considered a must play. Highly recommended. 

I will add a disclaimer though. If you are sensitive to graphic and disturbing imagery, this might not be a game to play.

He saw a mysterious woman jumping into a well, and tries to save her. He must seek help from the inhabitants of this surreal carnival. I love the artstyle of the game, it's like a H. R. Giger artwork. Although the game may be a bit colorless (mostly only brown and purple) it actually makes the game look unique, and fits the vibe. And while it has pixel graphics, it also has higher resolution than most so the characters don't look too pixelated, and makes the world clearer.

Length-wise, it may be kind of short, but due to the nature of the levels, which are small areas we travel back and forth (as well as being variations of it) it's probably for the better, since if it's too long it could get boring. The characters might be weird and creepy, like a blind scribe, a dried husk resembling a mermaid, etc but it's not really a horror game, since instead of feeling scared, you'll probably feel more sad and sorry for them.

Gameplay is as usual, finding items, combining them if needed, and use them. The puzzles aren't that difficult, and there's an in-universe hint system that (sarcastically) helps you. Death is also handled pretty unique in this game, instead of forcing to reload a save, you respawn at the start of the carnival. Sometimes, dying is in fact unavoidable, needed to progress, and also for some achievements.

I think Strangeland's a great game, since it can be, well, strange, and a bit creepy, but not really scary. It has memorable characters, who speaks like in poems and riddles, as well as having a unique artstyle.

In the past year I lost my father, and already struggled with mental health issues beforehand. Suffice to say, the story struck a chord with me. Very slight early game/thematic spoilers below.

I think one of the main criticisms I've seen of the story is that it's too steeped in metaphor... but that's kind of the point. The game takes the ""this is a self constructed metaphor for trauma"" trope and makes it a plot point. Everything is so steeped in metaphor because that's the character is doing to cope with his trauma. It's actually pretty meta even - stories/games/movies/narratives in general have been a coping mechanism for creatives for the longest time. It's why so often you read that a writer wrote something in tribute, in response to, or (esp metaphorically) about some kind of trauma or loss. This is a story about someone doing just that. Also, great bit of writing here, it contains endless allusions/metaphors based on preexisting stories, further pushing the theme of burying trauma under layers of fiction and metaphors... the metaphors have metaphors and if that sounds confusing or convoluted, that's exactly the point.

And again, this is just a slight spoiler because the game at no point pretends that this isn't what is going on. I was actually surprised that they stated it so explicitly early on - usually this is last act big twist stuff. But, in my opinion, it's played perfectly as more of an overarching theme. 

Although, to be fair to those other reviewers, I think this story will hit differently with you depending on your personal life. Maybe someone who hasn't had the same experiences I have won't feel the same sort of connection to the themes and story, they won't be able to self insert as the MC, like I was able to.

Onto why I cried. Other than the ending. I'll try to be vague, but slight spoilers for mid game below.

There's this point of the game where you're at your lowest. Your quest has failed, there's no clear path forward, all the options you've tried don't work or lead nowhere. You finally find where to go, and it almost feels like a joke ending. Like the game took everything away from you, and is now laughing at you about it. And then a previous character comes along in a new form, and guides you. And on its own that is impactful enough, albeit a little on the nose, but it's what the character says to you that really got me. It's hard for me to say more without being detailed, but it's honestly a beautiful moment and sentiment.

Also, the artstyle is awesome.",1698494522,1698494522,True,8,0,0.602768599987030029,0,True,False,False,True,,1698535421,"I'm so sorry to hear about your father and your struggles; it means so much to hear that the story connected with you in that way.

* Artwork, sounds, and voice acting is awesome just like in Primordia,

* The dialogues guide you a lot to focus on self exploration rather than the actual story itself. There were no plot twists or something to undercover about story for me, in the early game you understand the pilot, it was more like self discovery experience you have along with the character. 
* I'd prefer ending to be a lot deeper, it ended to soon for me.

“You’d had two wishes already,” the hag said, “but your second wish was for me to return everything to the way it was before you had made your first wish. That is why you remember nothing; because everything is the way it was before you made any wishes.” She cackled at the poor berk. “So it is that you have one wish left.”

Well in any event, my original review is below. 

------------------

I hate being the guy who gives this a thumbs down. It really was a truly breathtaking at times. But... just too short. (I think I let the game idle for about an hour once, so we're probably talking ~ 4 hours playtime.) There were a few pieces that were a bit average, but the majority of this game was just masterpiece level. The writing for the dialog especially was brilliant. If anyone is on the fence... there isn't alot of it, but it's hard to find stuff like this.

Devs (cuz it appears you're reading all these), I did like this game and I hope you will keep making more like this. Just... Idk, 
if you could come up with more at this quality, that'd be amazing. But even just a few more puzzles, or maybe a bit less obvious ones so the player needs to spend more time solving them? Just a smidge of filler maybe? Idk... I don't want you guys to get discouraged because this really was great and in such a niche market... but maybe just a little bit of stretching would help?

Regardless, I'll be watching for your next title.",1685085941,1698527264,True,0,0,0.427184492349624634,0,True,False,False,True,,1685108441,"Thanks for the review, and for the kind words about the writing even in a negative overall take. I've always appreciated all player feedback, and always feel bad when we disappoint a player, especially one who clearly liked our work in many ways.

Four to five hours for a single run is about what most players seem to take. I agree that if that's too short for a player, they shouldn't play the game. It's not unreasonable for players to want more playtime.

That said, when you find an indie game that you think is ""breathtaking,"" often ""masterpiece level,"" and ""brilliant,"" that is a reflection of developer work that went into things other than extending the game time.  There are trade-offs for everything, and if you leave a negative review because of the game's length, I think there is a good chance other developers will make different trade-offs -- you won't get a game that's ""brilliant"" and long, but a game that's long but less engaging.

To the extent you're interested in how the sausage gets made on these things, a few thoughts:

- We could have made Strangeland's playing time longer by using a variety of traditional adventure game shenanigans like: (1) always putting ""locks"" and ""keys"" as far from each other as possible, to require maximum walking distance; (2) adding large, empty rooms for the same purpose; (3) reducing walking speed; (4) not letting you double click to instantly leave rooms; (5) padding dialogue with filler; (6) padding puzzles by breaking one-step actions into multiple steps, even though those steps are totally obviously; etc. Personally, I have never liked that kind of padding, and so we strove to take it out of Strangeland. 

- Rather than extend the game's length, we focused on things like multiple puzzle solutions, lots of ""flavor"" interactions (i.e., when you try using items in ways that are not necessary to advance the game, you don't just get ""that won't work""), and polish. That may not have been the right choice, but ultimately, the resources have to go to one place or the other.

- The game has some limited replayability. FWIW, I'd recommend replaying with commentary and annotations on, and try solving things in a different order or a different way. It's not like an RPG where there is radical plot branching and optional dungeons or something, but it is a different experience. 

- Ultimately, we spent 2.5 years developing the game. Dev time isn't linear, so perhaps we could've added another hour of content without adding another six months of development, but it would've added dev time. As a project drags on, maintaining the focus needed to complete the project gets harder -- that's why many ambitious indie games never get finished at all.

That said, I'm really grateful for the kind words, and really sorry you came away unhappy despite the things you loved about the game. All three of the core teammembers are now working on non-adventure games that will have much longer playing times, so there's that: Fallen Gods (a rogue-lite), Hibernaculum (an RPG from Vic); Carbonflesh (a hard-to-define game from James)!"

I won't spoil anything (and I recommend you try not to spoil yourself either), but it is a truly dark and interesting tale that lives up to its name. 

It is made by the developers of Primordia, which is easily one of my favorite games of all time. This is another hit by Wormwood in my opinion. Comparing the two is a bit hard as they have very different settings and themes, so I'd be weary of anyone that tries. Both games are phenomenal. 

Strangeland is definitely quite abstract, and many of the references and quotes require a bit of knowledge to understand fully. That's not a flaw, as you're not missing anything if you don't catch them, since even at face value it's generally quite understandable (and I'm sure I missed more references and quotes than I understood). I don't think it's for everyone, certainly some people might find it a bit pretentious (I don't, but I've seen some reviews state this). In my opinion, calling it that is a disservice to the developers and their own feelings and emotions they poured into this veritable masterpiece. 

As far as the actual gameplay goes, it's generally very intuitive. I don't recall more than one or two times I was stuck on something. Wormwood is quite good at making point-and-click games without the usual twisted logic that some of them have (you know, the kind of logic where you scratch your head and wonder how you were ever supposed to figure that out without googling). I'm happy to say the game is entirely beatable without looking up any guides or walk throughs. In order to 100% it, you may need one though (or the patience of a saint), but that's most games in fairness. 

All in all, I love strangeland. It's beautifully abstract, introspective, deep, twisted, and intriguing. I look forward to any future projects Wormwood may make. 

It is a bit short, my ~5 hours playtime beat the game and then ran through a couple of the different endings (not from start to finish, from various end game save points). If you rush through it you can probably finish it in 3 hours or less, but you'd also miss a lot of the game and not have enough time to really let some of the deeper moments stew and process. 

Playtime might be the only potential drawback to some that aren't as invested into games like this. I 100% believe the game is worth its asking price. The labor of love and passion that went into this is on display in each scene. However, if you are not a fan of point-and-clicks (why are you here?), or are not sure you'll like the subject matter and abstractness, I might wait for a sale. 

Seriously though, this game is great. Check out primordia if you haven't, though I also suspect many of you will have already. 

TL;DR; If this even slightly seems to interest you, I highly recommend it.",1682636646,1682636646,True,3,0,0.528985500335693359,3,True,False,False,True,,1682639807,"What a beautiful, generous review!

It's one of those games that has a story whose interpretation is mostly up to the player, so I can't exactly examine it by way of the conventions of traditional story-telling. The quality of the narrative will be determined differently by whoever plays it based on how they do or don't interpret the events that occur, so I really can't give you anything more than my general impressions as a basis along with just how the game functions as a game.

Strangeland is one of the latest games published by Wadjet Eye and the second game developed by Wormwood Studios after the excellent Primordia from nearly a decade before this game came out. It is the story of a man whose name we aren't given, but is referred to in the credits as 'The Stranger,' and he wakes up in a mysterious carnival, on a bunch of islands floating in an endless sky, that looks straight out of a metal album cover. Upon entering the Big Top, which is sentient and voiced by Mike Pollock doing what sounds like hilariously terrible stand-up routines, he encounters a woman committing suicide by throwing herself down a well and then reviving to repeat the action in an endless cycle shortly after. From there, he makes it his mission to find a way to stop her from doing this while attempting to figure out where he is and what's going on from the denizens of this place.

First of all, like Primordia being a huge shoutout to Beneath a Steel Sky, Strangeland very clearly has a lot of influence taken from Sanitarium, which is even directly referenced in a certain conversation. I mean, that was extremely clear to me just hearing lead VO, Abe Goldfarb, do his best impression of Frank Schurter, the lead VO of Sanitarium, and it was even further cemented the first time you get a phone call from yourself. Though, unlike Primordia, it doesn't feel like the entire plot was ripped from Sanitarium as that game only had a brief section in a carnival, which is where all of Strangeland takes place, and its main plot was about a corporation trying to hide the cure to a deadly virus with a subplot about the main character absolving himself of past trauma whereas Stangeland kind of hones in on the latter. As a result, Strangeland feels a lot more original and has its potential influences worked far better into the narrative. The story itself is more difficult to judge, so I'll just say that I enjoyed the tone and the atmosphere right up until the very end where it kind of got extremely corny in a way where it felt like the last paragraph was written by a teenager. Didn't ruin the whole game for me, and I'm not sure how I would have ended a story written like this, but it just felt extremely jarring given everything that had happened up to that point. I was also a little disappointed that there's only two ending choices where Primordia gave you like 6 or 7 different ending variations.

The presentation of Strangeland is definitely top notch. The background are some of the most beautifully drawn I've seen in an adventure game and the characters sprites are very crisp and highly detailed to the point where you can spot the minutia of facial expressions without the need for closeup, though there are still closeups in certain parts which are similarly stunning to look at. The VO, for the most part, is honestly a cut above the rest of Wadjet Eye's games. In the years they've been in operation, they've really nailed how to record and direct voice actors: everyone's audio sounds extremely clean even when there's vocal filters put over it and all of the voice actors embody their roles very well with many absolutely selling you on the drama of the situation.

For a world without a clear sense of logic, I was actually surprised by how much the puzzles seemed to make sense. When doing a game like this which has different rules from our reality, there's a fine line between maintaining the sense of surrealism and designing puzzles that a human brain could still reasonably interpret, and Strangeland absolutely rides that line. Now, that's not to say you'll never get stuck, but there is thankfully a really effective hint system in the form of calling yourself on the phone. If you ever don't know what to do, the you on the other end will nudge you in the right direction. It's extremely useful if you ever happen to accidentally miss an item or if you know what you need to do but aren't necessarily sure of where to star going about it. The environments and interactibles are thankfully very clear and readable so missing something is ultimately unlikely. I really don't have anything bad to say about the game design; the most I could is that a later area had an exit to the environment that wasn't made clear by the background art, but even then I think context clues will lead most players to find that exit and I was being a little too hasty.

I really did enjoy Strangeland, despite me not thinking the most of the story. It has gorgeous presentation, a great atmosphere, and enjoyable puzzles. I really couldn't ask for much more from an adventure game when so many can be unclear and/or frustrating. I know Wormwood are breaking from adventure games for their next release, but if they ever do decide to develop another, I would be excited to see what they have in store.",1682531044,1682531044,True,1,0,0.508771896362304688,4,True,False,False,True,,1682533673,"Thanks so much for the lovely, detailed review!

The quick answer is that Strangeland was basically as deep as I can mine that particular vein of sorrow and hope in my own life. If the specific themes and exposition interest you, there is something I made *before* Strangeland: a section for the RPG Torment Tides of Numenera featuring a character named Inifere. He is a darker, less hopeful image of the same despair-paralysis, with similar elements of body-horror, disassociation, and personality fragmentation.

If you more just enjoyed *any* personal/philosophical/classical/humanist content in a point-and-click, you should try Primordia, which I wrote before Strangeland.

사실 Wormwood의 전작인 프리모디아를 보면 게임진행과 퍼즐부분은 딱 기대한만큼입니다. 흠잡을데 없다는거죠.
근데 이게 첫 한글 번역이라는게 참 미묘합니다. 프리모디아도 가볍게 할만한 게임이라고 할수는 없었고 배급사인 Wadjeteye의 라인업을 보면 이런게 하나쯤은 나와도 이상할건 없었지만 아무리 그래도 이건 좀... 너무... 인디스럽잖아요.
어떤 남자의 절망과 극복을 상징과 비유로 나타내는 심상은 엄청나게 창의적이라고 하긴 힘들지만 다른 사람들에게 입문작으로 추천할만한 이야기도 아닙니다. 그점에서 프리모디아가 먼저 번역되었어야 하는데...
아무튼 게임에 대해서 이야기하자면 트레일러에 나온걸 보면서 생각했을 그대로입니다. 주인공이 어떤 사건으로 절망해서 마음속에 기괴하고 비틀린 환상을 통해서 주변사람들과 자신을 특정한 형태로 투영한다는 내용입니다. 말하자면 2D이고 조금 더 잔인하고 징그럽고 우물로 추락하려는 여자의 엉덩이가 많이 나오는 사이코너츠죠.
이정도만 설명했지만 벌써 할 사람들이 많이 줄어드는게 보이는거 같지만 솔직히 만약 당신이 이 게임의 이미지와 트레일러를 보고 내용을 대충 예상하지 못했으면 문제가 있는겁니다.
전개는 제 취향이 아니었습니다. 게임에서 뭔가를 하면 계속 저를 까는데 물론 작중인물에게 한 말이고 이 행동은 현실에서 그가 택한 선택을 상징하는건 알지만 진행하려면 다른 선택지도 없는데 그걸 했다고 까니 불쾌하죠. 그래도 계속 할 정도로 기본적으로 게임이 재미있습니다.

I've aimed for depth with all of our games, but in different ways -- Primordia, I wanted the depth of a world that feels very expansive in time and space (even if you only explore a sliver of it); Fallen Gods, the depth comes from replayability, with every event offering so many paths through (with many options available only if you have certain items, followers, skills, etc.) that *mechanically* it feels like you're only scratching the surface in a given encounter; Strangeland, the depth is meant to come from the densely packed web of allusions and imagery, with elements that seem ""random"" fitting into place upon reflection, replaying, or checking out the commentary/annotations.

That said, the depth of Primordia and Strangeland is much more accessible. Strangeland began as a very small game inspired by the death of my grandparents, and over time all three of us made it grow and grow, but perhaps it is a little ""ingrown"" if that makes sense. :D"

Essentially, most of those I've played range from being at least decent to amazing in their rights telling some interesting stories between them that doesn't feel like a copy. But, before I get ahead of myself in crediting the developer of Wormwood Studios for their reimagining of the game, let's talk about Strangleland.

Being a carnival horror theme, Strangeland is a great addition to the genre we don't see plenty of in the gaming industry, and this is coming from who is a sucker for anything based around the circus, funfair and performing arts. The phases I would use to simplify Strangeland, is it being a grim version of Alice in Wonderland, down to the mucky colour palette, creepy characters design who talk in 'gibberish' with a purpose, and the whole atmosphere being out of this world like I'm in another dimension. 

I love the expansion of cinematic wallpaper cutscenes that add gruesome and unsettling of certain scenes. The sound effects are spot on and the dialogue was the right amount of ominous and question marks moments without getting out of hand.

The storytelling on the other hand wasn't as much of a roller coaster ride. For me at least it wasn't too special, probably due to not relating to the main character's struggles with their[spoiler]dark depression after losing someone important to them.[/spoiler]

Anyone who cares more about the narrative in general than the visual should probably purchase this game for £6.00 or whenever it is on a discount as you probably won't gain much from it.

But this isn't me recommending this game largely on the storytelling, but more so on the creative imagery and presentation that it could be their own art museum.",1674843117,1690367427,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False,True,,1674844345,So glad you liked it!

TLDR: Meant to be dark and brooding, but comes off a little desperate. Still an interesting, if short, game. 

Strangeland is a simple if emo point and click. Built in the ‘golden age’ 90’s style it makes use of quite a few of the modern improvements to pnc’s but still suffers from a few of the pitfalls of the genre. It seems heavily inspired by I have no mouth yet I must scream and the darker elements of beneath a steel sky. 
You play as the stranger… in a dark carnival named Strangeland… I, of course, decided he’d be called Heinlein or Valentine or even Smith, and was immensely disappointed there were no references to this… Or if they were they were too subtle for me. Our stranger here is chasing a woman down a well… Literally in my case. In what seems to be a cycle of self destruction.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
[list][*] The game sticks to its theme quite well. It shoots for dark and broody, and even if it seems a bit desperate at times, it pulls it off nicely. 
[*] The puzzles are simple enough to keep flowing, while esoteric enough that if you’re relatively new to point and click adventures they might pose a little challenge.
[*] The voice acting and dialogue is done tastefully, and add depth to the scenes and characters. These little extras build the world nicely. 
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list][*] I don’t think this is a very tasteful take on mental illness, grief, or loss. It misses the mark often by moving into the dramatic over the hard truths we have inside, which I found eyerolling over engaging. 
[*] There are a few pixel hunting moments that are a staple downfall of the genre. Didn’t spot the hole in the tent? That’ll be one frustration please! Luckily the double click move, condensed scenes, and ability to skip most cutscenes make hopping around quick, so you can jump about and hunt… There’s also always hints, which the game doesn’t punish you for using. (I assume, I didn’t get an achievement for ‘no hints used’ so I’m guessing its ok.)
[*] The game boasts there is no way to fail etcetcetc, there are also no alternative routes, that I could find at least. It’s all good and well not having dead ends, but that only matters if you can solve problems in a multitude of ways. You can’t. So if you’re stuck it’ll end up as a rub things on other things fest until you find the right doodad to rub against the right thingyamjiggy. 
[/list]

[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]

 [list][*] I’d have loved to see more dialogue options, more red herrings, more paths, more places, more solutions, and just more of everything, I guess. What we had felt good, adding some places and people to flesh the world out would really help grow the complexity of the world. Let 83 make more items, let them have effects in places, let us [i]explore[/i]. 
[*] Lean into the tight writing and characters to produce more organic moments. There was huge opportunity for some very interesting revelations here and it all seemed a bit… underwhelming. 
[*] Develop the ambiance. Strangeland has moments where it does unsettling exceptionally well, but it doesn’t do mundane well at all. A lot of animations are reused giving it a stock image feel. A few more motions would really help it. The odd shuffle in the strait jacket, varied wind, a few more motions from the characters around, all of these would give this world an even more unique and real feel. 
[/list]


[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]

This was a close one for me. The big problem I see is the pricing. Strangeland is well worth picking up, but I don’t think it’s worth half the money they’re asking for it. I have a little over 5 hours played, for 2 run through’s and a whole bunch of AFK eating time… That really isn’t value for money for something so short… But it is unique, interesting, and lovingly crafted.
Not for people with suicide triggers, carnival phobias, or who are easily disturbed.
For people with limited experience in point and clicks, people after a story heavy game, and people who like the grotesque. 
Overall I give this a thumbs up, but I recommend buying it when it’s heavily discounted. At half the price it is, Strangeland would be an absolute steal.",1672595166,1672595222,True,5,0,0.583820104598999023,0,True,False,False,True,,1672621245,"Glad you liked it overall, and I appreciate the detailed feedback.

Oyunu çok beğendiğim için, önce normal sonra da geliştiricilerin yorumlarını içeren haliyle olmak üzere, iki defa oynadım. Nelerden ilham aldıklarını, nelerden alıntı yapıp nelere referans verdiklerini görmek istedim. Bilmediğim pek çok şey öğrendim, bu da oyun deneyiminin yanında ekstradan mutlu etti.


Strangeland, çok katmanlı bir oyun. Bu yönüyle ilk bakışta İlahi Komedya'yı andırdığını söyleyebilirim. Nasıl ki orada ilerledikçe Cehennem, Araf ve Cennet ile karşılaşılıyorsa, Strangeland'de de ona benzer bir mantık var. Aynı şekilde sembollerin de çok önemli bir yer tuttuğunu söylemek yanlış olmaz.

Ve tabii ki, o görür görmez insanı çarpan ismi düşününce... Yapımcılar doğrudan doğruya [i]""yabancılaşmayı vurguluyoruz""[/i] diye bağırmak istemişler, şeklinde algıladım. Elbette ki ""yeni bir şey değil bu"" diyebilirsiniz, ne de olsa modern ve post-modern birçok eserin ana teması olan bir konu. Ama bu kadar etkileyici örneğine rastlamak zor. Bitirdikten sonra ""Keşke bu oyunu ben yapmış olsaydım"" dedim. 


Strangeland, felsefik bir oyun. Karakterimiz neden orada olduğunu ve etrafta ne olup bittiğini de anlamaya çalışıyor tabii ki, ama esas meselesi kendini araması. Ama aynı zamanda da ""kendini görmeye bile"" tahammülü yok... Bu mükemmel bir çelişki örneği. Biz de bu arayış yolunda ilerlerken attığımız her adımda, altından anlamlar fışkıran pek çok şeyle karşılaşıyoruz. Bir şey size tuhaf, saçma veya anlamsız mı geliyor? Onu bir kenara itmeyin, aksine anlamaya çalışın, çünkü o aslında sizin ilerleyebilmeniz için bilinçli olarak konulmuş bir engel. Oyunun bulmacalarına bu yönden yaklaşınca, bana tıpkı mükemmel bir kitabın içinde kaybolmuşum hissini verdi.


Strangeland, sembolik bir oyun. Bir yerlere gitmek için sürekli ağzının içinden yürüyerek geçtiğimiz o palyaço, etraftaki kuzgunlar, yaşlı ve bilge bir adam diye tanımlayabileceğim başka bir karakter, size tarot kartları seçtirip falınıza bakan kişi, roller-coaster yolculuğu, ve elbette ki [i]maskeler[/i] ... Bunların her birinin kendince anlamları var, bazılarının iç içe geçmiş birden fazla anlamı var ve hepsi sizin tarafınızdan keşfedilip anlaşılmayı bekliyor. Yapımcılar ilk başta oyunu normal bitirip bütün bu alt anlamları ve alt metinleri 2. oynayışta keşfetmemizi önermişler, açıkçası onlarla aynı fikirdeyim. Hem ikincisinde ortama ve atmosfere alışmış olacağınızdan iyice bir sindirmiş olursunuz, hem de ilk başta çok fazla bilgiye maruz kalmak oyunun ""oyun"" olmasından alacağınız zevki öldürebilir.


Son olarak... Strangeland, maalesef ki özensiz bir çevirinin kurbanı olmuş bir oyun. Gördüğüm hataları burada tek tek ekran görüntüsü alıp bir albüm halinde paylaşmayı da bilirdim, ama o çok hedef göstermek gibi olacağından ayıp olur ve yakışık almazdı diye düşündüm, vazgeçtim. Bunun yerine sadece oynamak isteyen kişilere İngilizce oynamalarını tavsiye etmekle yetiniyorum. Yani Türkçe çeviri var diye mutlu bir şekilde indirerek hemen oyuna dalayım diye heves etmeyin, o heves kursağınızda kalır ve üzülürsünüz. Sıkıntı ne derseniz, inanın hangi birini sayacağımı bilemiyorum. Bazı cümleler küçük harfle başlıyor. Bazı cümlelerde hiçbir neden yokken büyük harf başlanarak yazılmış kelimeler bulunuyor. Özne yüklem uyumsuzlukları, anlatım bozuklukları... Yanından 45976298350 kere geçtiğimiz kuyunun ""pekâlâ"" diye çevrilmesi... İyi niyetlerle yola çıkılmış olabilir, ama kötü bir çeviri okuyan kişinin oyuna olan ilgisini bir anda sıfıra indirebilir. Yapımcılar eğer yazılan incelemeleri okuyorlarsa, öneri olarak bir proof reader bulmalarını ya da en başta çeviri işlerini tek bir kişi yerine bir ekibe emanet etmelerinin daha doğru olacağını söylemek isterim. Sonuçta ekip işinde insanlar birbirlerinin yanlışlarını görüp düzeltirler ve ortaya çıkan işin kalitesi artar.


Aşağıdaki paragraf bir miktar hafif spoiler içeriyor, bakıp bakmamak sizin bileceğiniz iş, sadece biraz fikir vermesi açısından ekleyeceğim.


Pastanın üzerindeki çilek niyetine, oyunda ciddi manada beğendiğim ve ilgimi çeken bazı ufak tefek detayları paylaşmak istiyorum:

[list]
[*] Lacan'dan bahseden bir ağustos böceğinin varlığı :)
[*] Atıcılıkla ilgili bulmacanın alternatif çözüme sahip olması (herkesin hız ve isabet yeteneği mükemmel olacak diye bir şey yok, akıl yürütme ile farklı çözüm bulunabiliyor olması çok iyi)
[*] Çeşitli din ve mitoloji referansları + bazı oyunlardan esinlenmeler :)
[*] [spoiler]Geçmiş, şimdiki zaman ve gelecek hallerimizi simgeleyen[/spoiler] 3 kişinin, Ali Poyrazoğlu'nun Davet şiirini anımsatması :)
[*] Ve nispeten dikkat çekmeyen bir noktada yer aldığı için birçok oyuncunun gözden kaçırdığını düşündüğüm şu şahane sözler beni benden aldı:

[spoiler][b][i]""The world is a masquerade. 
Faces, costumes, voices - - all pretend.
We all wish to appear as we are not,
We deceive ourselves,
And in the end, we do not even recognize ourselves.""[/i][/b][/spoiler]
[/list]

Yazıyı fazla uzatmamaya çalıştığım halde bunu pek de başaramadığımı üzülerek görüyorum. Ama aslında anlatmak istediklerimin belki %40'ını ancak anlatabildim. :) Paragrafları mümkün olduğunca yalın tutarak heyecanımdan ve sevgimden bahsetmek yerine nesnel şekilde incelemeye çalıştım. Fakat bundan ileri gitmek de bu yazıyı inceleme olmaktan çıkarıp simgeler, semboller, alıntılar, mitolojik referanslar ... üzerine aşırı spoiler içeren bir metne dönüştürürdü ki, o da hiç hoş olmazdı. O tür şeyleri herkesin, daha doğrusu merak edenlerin kendi kendilerine keşfetmesi daha doğru olur.

Not by a long run. Still, the art direction is great (that's what drew me in), it is extremely well written (and the french translation is pretty good) and I found the puzzles enjoyable, not too easy, not too hard either (except that ""wanton one""... I had to ""call for help"" ;). The game could have used more environments and interactions though.

The reason this game does not come close to my favourite Wadjet Eye games (My top 3 being Blackwell Unbound, then Gemini Rue, then The Shivah) is the fact that in a way it feels a bit too... ""cliché"", for lack of a better word. It is clear from the beginning that the ""hero"" is inside his psyche, and all the classical symbolisms are present : mirrors, black dogs, light vs dark... Even the ending (the ""best"" one, which I consider as the true ending) is cliché as hell.

Also, while the writing is exceptional, I felt that sometimes the best lines were forced. I was like ""Ok, that's quite a thought provoking line there, but could it have been drought with a little more subtlity ?"". It's like having an exceptional sauce with your dish, but all over the plate. It's good so it's okay, but it's meant to be used with just the right amount and at the right moment.

But overall, I recommend this game. I spent a full evening playing it (almost) from start to finish and I don't regret a single euro spent. While I still wait for a game that will move me as much as Blackwell Unbound, I can't deny that Wadjet Eye is still making the best point and clicks nowadays.

Теперь об игре: простая бродилка в жанре point-and-click, где загадки играют не самую первую роль, да и в целом они довольно просты. Главное достоинство игры - арт дизайн и саундтрек. Дизайн меня привлёк ещё на моменте анонса игры в 2018 году, тогда я про неё и впервые узнал. Саундтрек мне отдавал вайбом Silent Hill 2, что было заметно во многих ключевых моментах игры, да и сама концепция сюжета чем-то похожа. Так что в итоге? Думаю, я получил то что и ожидал - непродолжительную интересную историю с хорошей визуальной составляющей и отличной музыкой, в принципе, как и в другой игре от этих разработчиков под названием Primordia (тоже довольно занимательная игра!)

We tried to achieve replayability with multiple puzzle solutions and a somewhat non-linear path (by finding new solutions, it is kind of interesting, maybe, to see how far you can get down certain puzzle chains without doing things that seemed ""required"" in your first run).  There are also some decision points that mildly affect the plot and gameplay throughout (e.g., the tarot reading and how it affects later dialogue and puzzles).

But I think the biggest thing you can do on a second run is turn on commentary and annotation mode. Obviously that depends on being someone who enjoys commentary, but if you do, there is *a lot* of it that you can choose to listen to, and the annotation mode has on-screen text explaining the references in the dialogues and imagery. Most players who have tried it said it made for a different experience and overall a richer one because you can compare your own interpretation to the original goals."

Like arranging syllables creates a conversation and bridges the gaps between us. This is a careful arrangement of cliches and references which tells a story you know.

I think me 15 years ago would have adored this game.

So there is a hell of a lot to like here. The art is striking and at times very disturbing to look at. The in-game age-warning before entering the carnival is very appropriate, as this one is definitely not for kids. 

Puzzle-design was good, but the smaller number of locations and inventory made it relatively easy. Although it felt short, it was priced appropriately so I don't count a short duration as a negative. One puzzle was a bit of a struggle for me due to my hearing difficulties, but luckily the designers included a helpful 'hint-line' within the game itself, which is thematic and helps keep you in the game rather than looking up external walkthroughs (which always spoil too much and ruin the immersion). 

The story really digs into allegory and symbolism. If you're the kind of person who reads Jung and obsesses over the hidden meanings of Neo's apartment number, then you'll probably enjoy poring over the oblique references in this game. You'll stroke your beard and whisper, yes, this is very deep. 

I'm being harsh. This is a very well-executed adventure game of this genre. It delivered exactly what was advertised, and I was compelled to keep playing to the end.

As a point and click game it's good. You can never get yourself properly stuck, and the answer can usually be deduced. It is possible to miss some achievements since some parts of the game permanently change, which is why I needed to play through a second time.

I played with the annotations on the second time, which basically tells you what all the references are in the dialogue. I basically hadn't understood the story at all, although it dropped some hints, it was never clear to me. Almost all of the dialogue is allegorical and referencing Norse mythology, Biblical mythology, Hebrew mythology, ancient poems or plays, Greek and Roman works, Edgar Allen Poe, plus all manner of obscure references.

Nothing is ever said to you in plain English, so from the point of view of the player it's like every character spews random words for no reason. A lot of the allusions and references are very indirect and made in a way that you basically would have to be told what is being referenced, even if you knew the source material. The author seems to think the more references the better, as every line in this game is a reference to something.

[h1]Notes:[/h1]
[olist]
[*] So first and foremost - I don't play adventure games. I've watched enough episodes of [i]Ross's Game Dungeon[/i] to be largely turned off on the entire genre. I don't think I've played one all the way through since I was in fifth grade when adventure games were big before computers got good. So, please keep in mind my thoughts are from someone who isn't familiar with the genre and was going into it somewhat skeptically. However, [i]Strangeland[/i] was chosen as one of October's games for the [i]Watch Out for Fireballs![/i] podcast, and I figured ""hey, their games are always interesting regardless of appeal, so let's try this"".
[*] From what I remember as a kid in elementary school through the 90s, this game does fantastically at capturing the style of 90s adventure games without the moon logical puzzles or frustration of locking yourself out of the ending. This made me willing to experiment way more, as I knew I could try whatever nonsense I came up. This rewards the leaps that lots of adventure games need.
[*] Inject this style of HR Giger/Zdzisław Beksiński artwork directly into my veins (and boy do some of the cutscenes of the woman really nail that). Visuals are the power of adventure games, and every scene in [i]Strangeland[/i] is itself a painting. [spoiler]Darkland and the decayed husks of the dead people(?) after the Dark Thing is let out[/spoiler] deserve particular mention.
[*] Awesome voice acting. I felt that The Stranger in particular hit the perfect blend of believable and ""clueless adventure game protagonist"". Murmur's voice actor deserves a BIG shout-out; I want him to narrate an audiobook.
[*] The soundtrack is a sublime 80s-ish horror movie type of synth.
[*] The highly allegorical nature of this game is pretty well-trod through media like [i]Jacob's Ladder[/i]. While I'm not burnt out on psychological horror that takes place [spoiler]in the protagonist's mind[/spoiler], I think some of [i]Strangeland[/i]'s puzzles and topics are heavy-handed. The Chorus's self-awareness of being the Chorus was hilarious, whereas Eitri and Fimbul Fambi were rote. I think I'd love Wormwood's next game (and I do hope they have a ""next game"") to have more of the Chorus's style of self-parody but still being creepy about it - there's a lot of mystery there. The style of humor where you're laughing at jokes that are mean to you is something that could work perfectly in this kind of game (which the Clown Head also hit).
[*] At $15 USD, I think the price is a little steep, but I like being put out of my gaming comfort zone - so for me, it was worth it. I can't really say how it compares to other games of the genre, but I saw it as going to see a long movie. And it was worth it!

It deserves high praise and ranking within its genre.
The art stands on its own (extremely detailed, gross, and beautiful). The writing, and gameplay are woven together perfectly. The voice acting adds so much, and is good. 

The themes of suicide, death, self-loathing, loss are portrayed in a way that I did not think possible. Heavy moments are given levity with clever humor. That's how well written the game is. It never felt like TOO much for me to handle. It is paced very well and does not overstay its welcome.

I tend to click anything and everything multiple times when playing p&c games, I believe the devs knew players would do this. Within the 1st 10min or so I ending up pissing off a giant cauldron. I asked it to make me something repeatedly, trying to exhaust all dialogue options. He made me something alright, dead. So I embraced the darkness, and began finding
various ways to end my life. Apparently there is an achievement for this LOL

We tell ourselves comforting lies while knowing the brutal darkness of the truth makes our lies necessary. The cicada(?) was a neat addition the idea of evolving/understanding the horror inside us.

(I'll just start what's probably going to be a rambling gathering of my thoughts more than anything else with my summary that it's a great game and I fully recommend it to anyone looking for a darker adventure game to play. Beyond here lies my rambling.)

Strangeland is one of the most thought provoking, well written point and click adventures I've played. It's filled with symbolism and woven throughout with various literary references, yet it manages to walk the line of making a coherent and enjoyable experience if lacking familiarity with much of the source material it calls upon while enriching that experience if you identify it. Several of the references went over my head until I played the annotation mode (which is a great addition) and while some of the dialogue related to those moments felt cryptic on my first playthrough, it wasn't detrimental to my enjoyment or understanding of the game. The major themes which are more crucial to understanding the stranger's past are more overt and repeated multiple times, yet still it manages to avoid feeling repetitive. It doesn't feel like the game is beating you over the head with these references in so much as it's reminding you of their importance to what's going on with the stranger, which often feels like a gut punch even if it's something you already picked up on. I'm trying to avoid spoilers but I thought it was masterfully written.

The presentation is great. Voice acting is stellar, as it always is with Wadjet adjacent games to the point where I think it's expected now and something I often take for granted. The artwork and overall atmosphere is something else. Like something Giger could have dreamt up at the height of a fever after staying up too late playing Amiga games. The game is *extremely* dark and all of the elements come together to punctuate that so well.

If I do have a criticism it would be that the game world feels rather small. It being a fairly short game doesn't bother me as much, but this was more the feeling of the scale of physical space in the world, not so much the number of locations but the feeling of proximity I think. I feel like this is something a lot of adventure games avoid with maps or other navigation aids to provide the illusion of scale, and maybe it was compounded with the QoL of how fast it is to get around; it's extremely fast to move from one side of the game world to the other. Perhaps the smaller scale is by design but it was one of the things which I found off-putting.

Really I'm nitpicking though because overall I loved the game. Primordia was something special and Wormwood Studios proved themselves again with this offering, I really look forward to anything else they put out in future.",1664743193,1664743193,True,6,0,0.536854565143585205,0,True,False,False,True,,1664749907,"Thank you so much for this lovely review.

Essa frase resume o que [i]Strangeland[/i] é, tanto na sua experiência de jogo como a experiência de seu desenvolvimento, como os designers revelam quando ativa o ""Modo Comentário."" Uma experiência surreal que serve símbolos e mais símbolos para retratar o mundo mais complexo e inexplorado da humanidade, o templo interno que abriga nossas mentes.
 
Com uma arte que casa o frio industrial com o calor orgânico, [i]Strangeland[/i] provoca o arrepio sensorial, transportando o tato do jogador para esse mundo híbrido, o convidado a se sujar também dessa união matrimonial entre a carne e o ferro. Mas a arte divide seu lugar de destaque com a excelente trilha sonora e incrível dublagem das personagens que se apresentam nesse circo de horrores dessa terra estranha.

Entretanto, não se pode aclamar tanto para a narrativa e os quebra-cabeças. De início, os obstáculos em [i]Strangeland[/i] são mais satisfatórios devido a sua natureza aberta, mas acabam se tornando mais lineares e simples durante o progresso do jogador.
A narrativa por si não é mal, mas também não arrisca em inovar. A coletânea de símbolos oferecem grande descarga emocional, mas tal leitura pode se igualar a experiência de ler um dicionário em busca do significado e poder de uma palavra, outro símbolo que exerce poder sobre nossas experiências humanas, especialmente quando se reconhece os símbolos antes da história os convocar para invocar emoções. Portanto, a narrativa pode-se tornar uma soma simples de matemática, onde se vê 2 + 2 e se espera 4, e o jogo não subverte essa lógica, gerando nenhuma surpresa.
Porém, isso não significa que [i]Strangeland[/i] conte uma história ruim, não. Personagens e, principalmente, frases irão ficar com jogador após completar o jogo. Esses símbolos comunicados, novamente, por uma excelente dublagem poderão até mesmo encontrar espaço nas paredes do palácio mental dos jogadores, sendo referenciados futuramente quando a vida apresentar novos problemas para eles.

Em resumo, [i]Strangeland[/i] é uma experiência surrealista espetacularmente apresentada e bem construída, mesmo que não fuja dos moldes fundamentados do gênero. Moldes esses que fazem um coral fenomenal com as vozes dos incríveis dubladores somadas com as nossas próprias vozes mirabolantes, habitantes de nossas próprias terras estranhas internas.

It’s fascinating how WEG has published games by so many developers (Primordia and Strangeland are ours, Resonance was Vince, Gemini Rue was Josh, Shardlight was Francisco) and yet maintain a very strong shared “brand.” Part of that is the shared voice cast, part of it is the nature of the engine (AGS) and genre.

There's a lot that I liked, and some things that I think could be improved upon. I'll mention some quick points first before getting into the story (the big one).

[b]Graphics[/b]: The graphics are quite souped-up and impressive relative to your typical PnC. It uses this sort of purple and gold color palette, which I thought was an interesting choice. It's not a style you see very often, but it works really well here due to Strangeland being a dreamlike, nightmarish construct. There is an unsettling sense of dread throughout the game -- you'll encounter lots of odd characters and disturbing visual sequences that are quite visceral and macabre in nature. They really nail the atmosphere on this one.

[b]Music/Sound[/b]: I wish the music stood out a little more, but it's very fitting nonetheless. Ambient, creepy, and foreboding. I liked the sound design, and thought the voice acting was very good, too. They did a great job on all those fronts. Even as I type this, I can still hear all those crazy sounds from the Dark Thing ringing in my head, haha. 

[b]Puzzles[/b]: In general, the puzzles are mostly fair. There isn't too much of the crazy try-everything-everywhere logic that you may associate with certain games in the PnC genre. Things have a reasonably logical flow to them. If you get stuck, you can walk over to the in-game telephone booth, dial 0, and get a hint for what to do next. Great idea! That being said, there are a couple lateral-thinking style puzzles that I thought were cool, but felt out of place in a game like this. One puzzle in particular (the missing telephone number) might be very frustrating for people who don't speak English natively.

There are a number of old PnC games where certain puzzles had multiple solutions, which is always fun -- and I was excited to find a shooting gallery puzzle early on that had multiple ways to tackle it. However, it seemed like a one-time deal, as there weren't any more multi-solution puzzles after that, as far as I could recall (either that or I simply missed the alternative solutions to certain things). There is a Tarot card puzzle that sorta-kinda introduces an element of choice, but it's not really a puzzle and there's no real penalty for ""getting it wrong"", nor any reason to get it right either (though there is a Steam achievement for it). 

Edit: As per the developer response below, I was incorrect about there not being more multi-solution puzzles. I simply missed the other solutions!

[b]Game Mechanics[/b]: I found the base game mechanics very fluid and easy. In addition to the usual inventory screen, you can use your mouse's scroll wheel to cycle through inventory items for quick use, which is super convenient. You can also double-click to fast travel, press escape to bypass cutscenes, etc - I like that the devs respect the player's time by giving them the option to speed things up if they want. Too many games force unskippable cutscenes and dialogue (which drives me up the wall), so I greatly appreciate that they get it right here.

[b]Story[/b]: This game is jam-packed with references - it's absolutely bursting at the seams. Some aspects are quite on-the-nose, while others are so subtle and esoteric that I was surprised to find them in a video game. It's sort of like trying to read Shakespeare for the first time in high school, where you'll either blitz right through and overlook 95% of the details, or slow down and get overwhelmed by everything that's actually going on. There's probably plenty that I missed - but even still, I noticed tons of easter eggs and shoutouts to famous works of literature, books, stories, movies, poems, plays, quotes, religious texts, mythologies, and even other video games. To elaborate here would take up several paragraphs - maybe pages - to get into it all, simply due to sheer volume. I cannot believe how many references and throwbacks were tucked away in here. I wouldn't say it's all necessary in order to understand the game, but the associated context can be useful.

In most PnCs, the dialogue tends to be a little more expository, so you can move through it quickly without missing much - but that's definitely not the case here. The game may alienate some players who go through a dialogue sequence or cutscene too briskly, not knowing what the hell just happened. That sort of thing can lead to detachment from the story if the confusion lingers on for too long. While I enjoyed all these details for the most part, it's a bit heavy-handed, and might benefit from a little more coherence and focus in order to better keep the player grounded. Hard to do in a surreal setting for sure, but I think it's needed from time to time so people don't lose their way.

Plot-wise, everything is one giant metaphor for the struggles of processing grief and learning how to find yourself. Various characters seem to represent different aspects of this process -- whether it's throwing oneself into work as a means of robotic dehumanization and trying not to feel, or using dark gallows humor as a coping mechanism, or invoking willful self-delusion and avoidance to forget painful memories altogether. The game does a good job of conveying the accompanying trauma, the total sense of aimlessness and helplessness, the ever-present threat of darkness, the pressure of maintaining memory and how it can evolve into nightmare, the horror of seeing someone you love reduced to something unrecognizable, the constant interjections of self-doubt, the ongoing feelings of guilt and regret, the difficulty of acceptance, and the maddening futility of trying to solve the unsolvable. As someone who has dealt with great loss myself, I found a lot of this game sadly relatable. 

Despite all this attention to detail, the protagonist (""The Stranger"") is a bland bowl of oatmeal, comparatively speaking. This poor dude is caught in a whirlwind of shit, and yet we never get much sense that he's actually suffering or frustrated with anything that's happening. Not a knock on the voice acting, but rather his characterization. My ability to relate to this game largely stemmed from my own experiences as a sort of stand-in for what was happening on-screen - but if I didn't have those experiences, I would probably have a hard time empathizing because The Stranger doesn't give you much to latch onto. Most of the interesting bits come from all the wacky and zany creatures you encounter. 

[b]Endings[/b]: I do think the game drops the ball somewhat when it comes to its four endings. Three endings are (depressingly) bleak albeit realistic, and one ending is feel-good Hollywood stuff. Oddly enough, the good ending is the most unrealistic part of this surrealistic game and completely lost me. I think the writer wanted to offer some kind of hopeful outcome to a dismal situation, but for me (and most others I know who've dealt with similar traumas), it doesn't usually work out like that. You learn how to live with the darkness instead -- it never goes away fully. Trying to beat it is what ends up causing the most pain, since it's actually an unstoppable juggernaut, and all you can do is grapple with it, wrestle it, rechannel it, integrate it, draw power from it, etc -- that sort of thing. Games like Celeste deal with this notion so perfectly that it left me teary-eyed, and it's a good example of how to put a positive and realistic spin on a depressing subject -- and I wish Strangeland offered something similar here because there was a ripe opportunity for it.

[b]Overall[/b]: Strangeland is a very well-polished point-and-click adventure game with lots to chew on. I don't think it's for everyone, since some people will be turned off by the endless stream of metaphors, but I think if you're looking for something surreal and abstract, this is a good game to check out.",1657928747,1658001216,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,,1657930462,"Thanks so much for the detailed and thoughtful review!

> multi-solution puzzles

Essentially all of the ""UI puzzles"" have multiple solutions (e.g., teratoma, Feejee Mermaid), and some of the inventory puzzles do, too.

> endings

Fair enough. Certainly my intention was not to suggest that anyone leaves the darkness behind entirely, nor has that been my own experience with tragedy or self-doubt. The game is more about the capacity to go back to living, rather than drifting lifelessly through life because of a cloud of despair. I do think (based on my own experiences) that it is possible for such changes to happen, not through force of will or strength of character but through the intervention of love in its many forms. But it is a very hopeful ending, to be sure."

Hala bilmeceler çözmeniz, tercihler yapmanız, mantığınızı ve zaman zaman da duygularınızı kullanmanız gerekiyor. Ancak bunları üzerinden size görsel, işitsel ve duygusal bir ""tecrübe"" sunuyor. 
Fazla spoiler vermeden hikayeye değinmem gerekirse, kimliği belirsiz, deli gömleği giydirilmiş bir adam kendini uzay boşluğunun ortasında, bir karnavalın girişinde buluyor, kapıdan içeri giriyor ve kendini bir olaylar zincirinin parçası olarak buluyor. 
Bir adventure klasiği olan Sanitarium'u oynamış olanlar az çok neler olduğunu tahmin edebilirler, bir kişinin geçmişi, üzüntüleri, kayıpları ve suçluluk duygusu ile yüzleşmeye çalışması söz konusu. Ancak Sanitarum'da ana karakterin anılarından beslenen rüyalarda çıkış aramamızın aksine, burada rüyalarda değil, metafizik bir ortamda, tabiri caizse ana karakterin ""ruhunda"" dolanıyoruz. Bu bakımdan David Lynch'in Eraserhead, Inland Empire ya da asla gerçekleştiremediği Ronnie Rockett filmleri ile benzer olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Oyundaki tüm karakterler ve tüm mekanlar tek bir ""ruhun"" farklı dışavurumlarından ibaret. Gördüğümüz görüntüler de Max Ernst'in ""içsel manzara"" tablolarına benziyor. 
Oyun daha en başında sizi bilmeceler konusunda uyarıyor, oyunda istediğiniz zaman girişteki telefonu kullanarak ipucu alabileceğinizi ve bilmeceleri asla deneme-yanılma yöntemiyle çözmeye uğraşmamanız gerektiğini söylüyor. Bence bu yapımcıların derdinin basit bir adventure oyunu yapmak olmadığını gösteren en önemli kanıt. Oyun herhangi bir yerde takılmanızı, ne yapmanız gerektiğini bilmeden boş boş dolanmanızı değil, hikayeden kopmadan oyunu sürdürmenizi, ana karakterin tecrübesinin bir parçası olmaya devam etmenizi istiyor. 
Yukarıda karakterlerin tümünün aslında tek bir kişinin içsel dünyasının yansımaları olduğundan bahsetmiştim. Karakterler ve mekanların altında haliyle semboller yatıyor, bu sembollerin bir kısmı bariz iken bir kısmı ise daha muğlak ve derin. Böylece oyun Sanitarium gibi ""aa meğer gerçek hayatta bu olmuş"" şeklinde bir çözümleme ile asla banal hale gelmiyor. Bize sadece ipuçları sunuluyor. 
Oyunun bir yerinde karşımıza David Cronenberg tarafından yaratılmışa benzeyen şekilsiz et yığını bir yaratık çıkıyor. Bu yaratık karnavalda absürd biçimde adeta bir revü kızı olarak sergileniyor. Gövdesindeki kadın cinsel organını andıran ağızları ovalayarak bize ilerlememiz için gerekli olan bir nesneyi veriyor. Açıkçası bunu gördükten sonra oyun için kanaat notum zaten 10 üzerinden 10 oldu. 
Harika görselliği, nefis müzikleri, ürkünç atmosferi bir kenara, sadece böyle cesur bir denemede bulunabildikleri için bile Wormwood Studios'u kutlamak gerekir. Evet Strangeland herkese göre değil, evet Primordia 2'yi bekleyenleri şoke edecek ama bu oyun ""bilgisayar oyunu formatı sanatsal bir düzlem olarak nasıl kullanılabilir?"" sorusunun yanıtını veren benzersiz ve hafızalardan kolay kolay silinmeyecek bir başyapıt.

This time around, they deliver a much more personal narrative that feels rather introspective and intimate in comparison to Primordia’s overarching parable of the human condition that, in true sci-fi fashion, seemed to transcend the experiences of an individual and extrapolate them to the whole mankind, or what was left of it in that particular post-apocalyptic setting. Instead, Strangeland is asking you to try and empathize with a plight of a lone and lost husk of a man, driven to his wits' end by a series of tragic events in his life, which I won’t spoil here because deciphering the oft-vague clues and putting  the pieces of this nebulous puzzle together is part of the fun and games at the nightmarish carnival that the protagonist navigates through. It’s very commendable, in fact, that the devs are trusting YOU, the player, to figure things out (mostly) on your own, without spoon-feeding you the RIGHT interpretation, but leaving just enough bits and pieces for you to pick up and come to your own conclusions.

The story, tho far removed from my own life experiences (so far and thankfully so, I'd say), feels very... real is not the right word, perhaps, given the – well… strangeness of the overall premise. But definitely vivid, thought-provoking and evocative. Mark Yohalem’s writing is as eloquent here as it was in Primordia, chock-full of metaphors, literary allusions and references, and while some may find it too vague, high-brow and/or wordy, perhaps, I, for one, think it's very powerful.

Victor Pflug returns with his unmistakable brand of peculiar aesthetics in both art and sound direction. The visuals are distorted, gritty and visceral, whereas the soundscape feels suitably tortured and tormented with a lot of droning tracks and reverb, both very unsettling and effective in burrowing their way into your psyche, even without resorting to any gore and jump-scary cues. 
 
And last but not least, James Spanos’ code and visual effects are a masterclass of what you can squeeze from the limited capabilities of the AGS engine, giving both the writing and the audiovisuals a stable scaffolding to rely on without any noticeable frame drops, which is an impressive feat, given how much is happening on the screen (and no doubt, behind the scenes) at any given time.

Although shorter than Primordia (my initial blind playthrough took me about 6 hours), Strangeland doesn’t lack for content, what with the extensive annotations and dev commentary tracks that give you not only a reason to replay the game with those features enabled, but a lot of insight into the creative process of the aforementioned trio. It’s so substantial, in fact, that my second run lasted for about 9 hours, most of which was spent reading and listening to the various bits of trivia from the devs themselves. Now, that’s what I call bang for my buck.

What about puzzles, the crux of any point and click adventure game, you ask? Well, they’re here, of course, and quite varied at that, both in their mechanics and difficulty. They’re quite logical, even if not immediately obvious; some even offer multiple solutions. The somewhat open-ended layout of the world lends itself to exploration, experimentation and discovery, and if you’re stuck on one particular puzzle, you can usually go elsewhere and tackle a different challenge. And if you’re REALLY stuck, you can always use the in-game hint system seamlessly integrated into the world itself populated by many a twisted version of carnival attractions and a cast of memorable characters, professionally voice-acted by the likes of Abe Goldfarb (whom you may remember as the lovable Crispin from Primordia) and Miranda Gauvin, the staples of Wadjet Eye Games’ VO talent.

All in all, Strangeland is not your typical adventure game but one with a unique vision and voice, asking a lot of the players but also giving them an abundance in return. If you’re up to the task, give it a try and don’t be a stranger.

[h1][b][u]Intro:[/u][/b][/h1] 
So I bought this when it came out about a year ago, better late than never right!?  I've picked up this habit lately where I buy a certain game I pre-judge as being something I'm probably gonna like and then save it, like purchasing a fine wine, (or usually in my case boxed wine) for a special occasion.  These pandemic years have been a nightmare so not exactly a lot of special occasions floating around.  Instead I've found myself just opening up bottles (...boxes) randomly to pass the time.  Long story short I wish I opened this one sooner as it was an absolutely phenomenal P&C gaming experience. 

-------------------------------------
[h1][b][u]Pros:[/u][/b][/h1]
-------------------------------------
-Hard to pick a first pro here, but I'm going to go with the voice acting.  Super pro all the way, featuring many of the classic Wadjet Eye Games VA's.  This game really solidified my personal belief that having competent and passionate voice acting can really make a good game into a great one. 
-Next up would be the artwork.  Backgrounds, sprite animations, and overall design is concurrently grotesque and beautiful and fits the ambiance of the story perfectly.
-Speaking of ambiance, the music is excellent.
-Next up is the story and writing (which is finding itself in the fourth position here but make no mistake dear reader, the ordering of these pros is simply a limitation of the laws of numbers in this shared delusion we call reality, each one of these could be in the top position.)  In Maslow’s Hierarchy of good P&C games, this is the foundational layer really.  I think all of my enjoyment of this game stems first and foremost from its bizarre set & setting which is fleshed out by some, in my (correct) opinion, great writing.  
-This game also features something that I plan on pointing out every time I see in a P&C game.  Namely, animating an interaction which does not achieve the goal.  The lever to turn off the electrified gate is on the other side of said gate.  ""Well perhaps these tiny pebbles will move the lever"" said no one in real life but in P&C logic, might work out?  A game with a lazier developer would rely on the old standby: ""I can't do that."" or ""That doesn't make sense""  or ""Your desperate Pyro, maybe try thinking of an actual solution"".  But this game? nope.  It's going to animate tossing that pebble and THEN mock your dumb choice.  I respect that amount of effort.  Follow it up with using the rat skin you saved after tearing it open to get quarters (this is oddly already not the strangest sentence I've ever written, I've reviewed many P&C games so this is par for the course at this point for me) on the electrified gate, thinking ""maybe it might work as an insulator of some kind, even though if I suggested this to myself as a solution in real life I would immediately have myself admitted to the looney bin"".  Before that fateful click of the rat skin on the gate, I steel myself for the seemingly inevitable generic ""you’re an idiot"" response.  But no! Instead, it’s something like ""Rat skins would make a poor insulator"".  A strange validation for man whose brain has been warped from 30+ years of P&C games.....  
-Wrapping up the pros, we have some general ""quality of life"" features (double click fast room exit, autosaves, lots of save slots, optional click to advance dialogue box in the settings).  These should really be givens for a P&C game made in the 2020's (any decade really) but you'd be surprised how often these things are still absent from modern P&C's.  
 
-------------------------------------
[h1][b][u]Meh...:[/u][/b][/h1]
-------------------------------------
-No object highlight function.  This actually was a stylistic choice made for the game play.  And there was no real pixel hunting to speak of.  But the backgrounds are so intricate that you end up having this feeling that you’re missing something when you’re really not.  

-------------------------------------
[h1][b][u]Cons:[/u][/b][/h1]
-------------------------------------
-I accidently hit the ""X"" key while playing and apparently this causes ""Abort Mode"" in Adventure Game Studio titles which exits the game.  I had a mini heart attack when steam said that it suddenly had some problems connecting to my cloud saves, making me think I lost them all.  Luckily it was not the case.  I blame this on Steam (along with many, many other things in general as we all should) so it should actually be in the ""Meh..."" category but I actually don't have any real cons for this game, so I put it here for symmetry or something idk.

[h1][b][u]Final Thoughts:[/u][/b][/h1] 
I have many games in my backlog and I picked this one semi-randomly and then proceeded to play it for 4.3 hours straight thru.  This is also going to be my 120th posted game review here on Steam, I enjoy writing them and some of you weirdos enjoy reading them (for which I am [i]extremely [/i] grateful).  As such I try to put some effort into the process which means I actually take notes when playing these games.  Going thru this process 120 times I've noticed some patterns.  Namely, If I don't take a lot of notes, it means that I am so immersed in the game I'm playing that I don’t have time.  For some games I end up taking pages of notes.  I actually counted the number of words I wrote in my notes for this game, and it came to 35.  35 words.  Which I somehow successfully translated into all the eloquent nonsense above ^^^.  When I finish a game and ask myself ""is this good"" and I say yes, I can think of no better proof of my own opinion’s correctness than my incredibly sparce notes.  All of this is to say that I found this game to have a mastery of immersion.  I wanted to know who this Stranger is. I NEEDED to understand why he was in this Strangeland.  The vagueness of the main character, which even extents to the question of what his name even is, was a subtle but incredibly effective way of increasing this immersion.  Because when your put in the shoes of a mysterious character, you end up filling in the blanks with...well, yourself.  And also, as a person who has lived his entire life facing the challenges of living with my own shadows following me everywhere I go it would be very disingenuous of me to say that I did not identify with the main character.  I know that I am most definitely not the only one who deep down feels that way, and if you dear reader feel the same, I strongly encourage you to try out this game for yourself. 

So, in conclusion, this game is up to the standard I have come to identify with Wadjet Eye Games and Wormwood Studios.  They rightfully, in my mind at least, keep their position as one of if not the best modern P&C gaming developers out there.  They are up there right alongside Sierra Online and LucasArts, and that is not a statement I'd make if I didn't whole heartedly believe it.  

TL;DR : Buy it.

And that's because of its strong identity that makes it stand out from the others both visually and as a structure. Its deformed, surreal world is gorgeous with immersive peculiar atmosphere. Its sound design and music are great. Its multi layer dialogues are exceptionally written offering some deep thoughts and some unforgettable characters. On the other hand it gets too abstract or personal and the main character is a bit dull, so you may find it difficult to attach emotionally to it or find a motivation for your actions. Nevertheless, ""Strangeland"" is mostly a poetic experience, a philosophical research so unique that you have to try it.


Manometer: 7/10[/b]


The good
- Gorgeous visually with artistic pixel graphics and a unique brown - purple color palette.
- Unforgettable, weird, deformed world seen mostly through fish eye lenses. It's like you're inside a strange dream or at the darkest parts of someone's subconscious. A surreal experience with peculiar dark atmosphere. 
- Great sound design. All these distant mystical sounds enhance even more the atmosphere. Music is also cool and integrates perfectly the background sounds.
- Deep, poetic writing. Although it gets too abstract for my taste and sometimes the story lacks flow you will finally find yourself immersed in an esoteric, cryptic multi layered world full of metaphors and thoughts that manages to reflect fragments of each players' personality. Most of the dialogues are really strong with philosophical values that will often make you pause the game in order to think of them more. Plot's structure has flaws but a weird inner strength too.
- Well crafted characters both visually and as personalities.  Some of them are unforgettable.
- Great voice acting performances. They are not exactly natural but try to enhance more the surreal element.
- Nice, responsive control mechanics. You can click somewhere else to cancel your previous command. There is a double click to instantly jump to the next screen and you can skip dialogues if you have seen them before. Using mouse scroll to choose items from your inventory is a good addition too. A lot of pn'c adventures suffer from slow, unresponsive controls but that's not the case.
- It's well balanced. It has some challenging parts but it usually gives you a good amount of clues in order to figure out the puzzles' solutions. Almost all of them make sense.
- Instead of a dull button on a menu, the hints' system is fantastically integrated into the game and the help comes in multiple stages instead of revealing the whole solution right away.
- Clear cut design to avoid the most irritating thing in pn'c adventure games, pixel hunting.
- Death - resurrection mechanic is an interesting idea as both a punishment and a second chance. It also takes some of the game's linearity away. The reactions after each resurrection are hilarious.
- It offers some hours of unique, indie, surreal point and click adventure experience in a very good price.

The bad
- It's so personal and abstract that you are never sure what's your purpose inside its world. You don't know what you're playing for or what you wish to happen after you solve a puzzle. Yeah, there is that girl but without knowing her you cannot bother much. With no motivation powering your actions it is difficult to get affected emotionally or get passionate so you end up just wandering and admiring the peculiar world and the well written dialogues. Also the turn of events seem to have no particular coherence. It's more like a collection of scattered strong images and thoughts than a single, whole experience with flow, beginning and ending.
- Don't get me wrong. Puzzles are good and well balanced but I feel they are a little bit one-dimensional. They just lack the spark, creativity and variety that Primordia's puzzles had.
- I found the main character a little bit flat. He has no backstory, his personality is nothing unique and he rarely says anything inspiring (unlike most of the npcs). Probably the main character had to perform as a mirror where the players would reflect their own personalities and affairs. Probably he had to be neutral, yet it's difficult to attach emotionally to him.
- Animations are a little bit clunky and at some points they remind me those flash's bone tool days.
- Murmur's puzzle (with the phone number) can be confusing especially if you are not a native English speaker and you 're more focused to the subtitles than the actual voices.",1654206082,1654206082,True,5,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,False,,1654207868,"Thanks for this beautiful, and thoughtful, review."

I don't know if this particular game could've been stretched longer, but I agree that it is on the shorter side for an adventure.  Partly that is because we tried to quality of life features (like fast travel) that remove ""filler,"" and we also tried to minimize design padding like putting puzzles and their solutions as far apart as possible (as some adventure games do).  But it's also just a fairly short game.  It has some replayabilty, though, since there are different paths through, different endings, and a very extensive commentary/annotation mode.

Graphics: The art style was excellent. Perfect for the game. Spooky, many memorable images and whilst there is the temptation, in a game like this, to go too surreal or even disturbing and shocking, I think they got the balance just right. 

Sound: As with anything attached to Wadjet Eye Games, the voice acting is top notch. The music helped create a good atmosphere, without being too memorable. I didn't notice it or remember it, which is just as you want with such games. Sound effects were also just right - punchy, created an atmosphere, not jarring or too noticeable. 

Puzzles: Very tricky for a modern point n click given the different types of fans in 2022. If, like me, you grew up on 90s point n clicks - Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Gabriel Knight, Simon the Sorceror - I think you'll find the puzzles easy. There are limited numbers of scenes, objects and hotspots which makes it fairly obvious what to do next. There are also two acts and after act one, all objects disappear and there is a fair amount of repetition in act two. I'm not complaining. As a 40 year old with a busy job and family, I don't have the time or energy for those 90s point n clicks anymore. The puzzles were just right for me - all fair and logical and they pushed the story along - but if you are looking for Ron Gilbert puzzles, look elsewhere. 

Story: It seems that the game was very personal to the author. It was full of metaphors and riddles with a fairly ambiguous ending, although it is obviously about mental health of some kind. Probably depression and dealing with trauma. But despite dealing with sensitive themes well, I think it fell down here. And I hate to say it given the love and care that went into it. I don't mind metaphor and ambiguity. But there was too much and too little of the real world. The whole story was about the main character and his struggles. But I didn't know anything about him by the end. Not even anything about the main story - the woman. Who was she? How did they meet? The ending was well done, but how could I really care about this character? Take Fran Bow and Sanitarium. Two games that dealt with mental health and similar themes. They left you wondering (at least Fran Bow did and Sanitarium until the last scene). They were ambiguous and had metaphors. But they were still heavily grounded in the real world too. I suppose it was a design choice - even some flashbacks so you felt connected to the real world might have made a difference. 

Value: Terrific. At the sale price of two cups of Starbucks coffee, this was a steal. 

I wanted to give it a higher score, but in an adventure game, where the puzzles aren't the star (unlike say Thimbleweed Park) story is king. And it just fell short I'm afraid.",1654159965,1654159965,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1654183778,Glad you enjoyed the game—and thank you for leaving a review!

I recently started playing though Wadjet Eye games. This is my the second one I've completed, the other being Primordia.

The writing and voice acting are stellar, especially the oracle head. The visuals are crisp and quite disturbing virtually constantly.

The story was good, particularly if you're fans of things like Silent Hill or Jacob's ladder. Themes of guilt, depression, suicide, etc..

My criticisms are that I felt the game was a little sparse and actual explore-able screens. Not sure how many off hand but it seems to be fewer than Primordia (although since its newer the quality is also better).
It was also a bit easier than Primordia for me. I used the ingame hint system a few times (mainly in between sessions to see where i left off) but didn't need to search online at all, and got though every puzzle withing a few minuted of trying.
Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to your personal preference. Some of the puzzles in Primorida were a little senseless in that was..

If one expects to be successful in their creation of a surreal story, the final product must be, at once and at equilibrium, dissonant and lucid; unbound and uncontrived; lobotomized and thought-provoking. And, if that 'one' is you, then my word of grace to you is to take notes from Strangeland. 

This game might be the most consistently satisfying storytelling fever dream I've ever witnessed. Probably the only one, at that. Nonsensical as it may seem, paradoxical as it may gloat itself to be, it is truly a masterfully-crafted work of art, from beginning to end. Characters skew themselves, assign themselves unearthly or downright demented proclivities; places are scattered, nonsensical and repeating, traipsing back and forth, never anchored in time, never feeling quite true, never granting the audience a hint of resolve. And yet, still, no matter how deep you delve, how much dirt on your hands, how grim it all gets, there is always a way forward. Always a way to right your wrongs, wrong your rights, blight the scourge, and brave the maelstrom, no matter the agonies; for her. While the world of Strangeland is entropic and chronically plagued, YOU are the only constant amidst the variables, the only one who can undo the shackles beneath your feet, or seal them.

The overall pressure on the adventure-game genre is to eschew puzzles, or reduce them to ""click to advance.""  We've tried to strike a good balance in Primordia and Strangeland, but we probably err on the puzzle-light side.

If you haven't played Resonance, I'd recommend it.  IMO it's the only indie adventure game from the ""adventure game renaissance"" that really focuses on puzzles.  And then Thimbleweed Park for the only big-budget adventure with a focus on puzzles."

This game is OUTSTANDING!  It has many themes of meaning in life, loss, self-denigration, grief! Many of us are chased by a dark thing or ""black dog"". When experiencing loss we sometimes lose our way. I love that in the game it says: ""Dead but not gone"". From a Buddhist perspective in many ways this is true. There are ways to honour the passing of those who are gone but have also gone on. We can give to charities in their names, make offerings to them and wish them well. 

I love the successive shedding of masks until they are too heavy, like the stones in the end, we can no longer pick them up or put them on. We need to face ourselves. This game did a beautiful job of this journey until the breathtaking end moments of redemption, acceptance of grief and final flight to the light!

This is after 3.3 hours of play, my early review:
It is quite extraordinary. I love the ""carnival"" trope which links to horror so comfortably. I am taken back to childhood times, exploring halls of mirrors, going on visceral, seedy ""scary"" rides in the dark, hearing, feeling, experiencing simultaneously the horror and the knowing that its ""just"" a ride, a kind of thrilling trick of the senses. The smells and sounds somehow uncomfortable, the way things tug at your unconscious, you know something and this makes the experience all the more thrilling. What is unique, and what I am really enjoying is the developer input you can choose in the settings. I love the elucidation of the sources of quotes and imagery, to personal experiences of loss and grief. In life we do have the possibility of ""dying"" to an old life through perhaps ""a dark night of the soul"" and finding redemption in a new, even if only in the form of possibility. This really resonates with me and speaks to my own loss and grief. Also, you can click on a SuperEgo button for more insights. In some ways we are strangers, not only to our own lives, but to the inter-connectedness of life itself.  I will find out if the stranger 'wakes up"" and finds some kind of redemption or some kind of acceptance. Yes, indeed he does!",1650529346,1652629151,True,8,0,0.557522118091583252,2,True,False,False,False,,1650550722,Thanks so much for this beautiful (and kind) review!

I personally don't like it as much as this studio's previous game: Primordia. But if the screenshots and trailer interests you then I definitely think it's worth a shot. On a technical and presentation standpoint, this game is phenomenal. And quite honestly the highest quality to have come out of Wadjet Eye's publishing efforts so far. Visuals, music, voice acting, sound design, all of it is absolutely incredible. It's honestly worth a playthrough just to see the sights and hear the sounds.

While I do enjoy the dialogue and the voice acting that delivers it, I feel the part where this kind of lost me a bit was the story. The twist that[spoiler]it's all in the protagonists head. And a sort of twisted escape he's created for himself to avoid facing reality,[/spoiler] is all pretty obvious after not-too long. It just feels like there's never much added to it as time goes on.

But I just wish it did a little more to shed some light on things at times. The world and characters here are all so interesting, I'd love to understand them just a bit better. (That scribe under the tree being my personal favorite) But unfortunately the only way you're gonna be able to do that is with the optional captions and dev commentary modes. I understand that the idea is mostly to have things left up to interpretation. But sometimes being too vague or obtuse can make it hard for a player to start forming their own theories and ideas. Or at least, it was for me in this case. It's a subjective thing.

Overall I still recommend it. It's definitely not for everyone, but I found it to still be a very enjoyable journey despite my criticisms.

Strangeland
Review
It seems as if Strangeland, a game released recently by Wormwood Studios is going to give a unique experience to gamers. This psychologic and exhilarating game will launch you into a one-of-a-kind experience. Let us take a brief look into the game.
A strange man, a foreign land!
As the name indicates, “Strangeland” is indeed a strange game, at the very beginning of the game, we observe a woman drop herself into a well.
Who are we? Who is that woman that threw herself into a well?
When we start the game, a dark atmosphere draws us in. The thematic music and voiceovers allows us to immerse ourselves into the game. We start the game by encountering a clown head with a dark sense of humor. It is worth seeing the reactions we gave while we were writing every word said by a Clerk Crow (Raven) we encountered under a tree, who had lost both its eyes. Speaking of dark humor, we can communicate with everyone, from the Raven, to the clown head in the game. We will need to establish a lot of dialogue to find our way in this land, where we are lost. We even have a payphone in the game. When we need help, we can call our infuriated self and ask for help to find our way. (For this, we need to dial #0 from the phone.)
Never Give Up!
Sometimes we will lose our way, and just when we think we are stuck, we can free ourselves from all our misery by stabbing ourselves with a knife. In actuality, this is a necessity for us to progress. In short, “Death”, is a key to progress in the game. Strangeland exposes us to our fears, our guilt, our shame, in their entirety. The graphics of the game perfectly achieves the requirements of a point-and-click game in an artistic manner. Wormwood Studios which you will remember from Primordia has hit the bullseye with Strangeland.
To put it briefly, Strangeland has a loaded dialogue system which contains novels, books, Norse Mythology, human psychology, religions and many more. Strangeland has roughly 5 hours of gameplay, and if we include all the dialogues and the comments made by the developers of the game, you can extend the game for a little longer. Strangeland is a game that will provide you more than the price you paid with its world, dialogue structure and artistic design.
Finally, while dying over and over again, how can we save each other?
Now, back to the beginning, and we will wait and see who plays the game, whether it’s you, me, or us both.
See you at Strangeland…",1644222378,1646182738,True,21,0,0.718386948108673096,2,False,False,False,False,,1644255681,"""Wormwood Studios insanın ruhuna dokunan nadir stüdyolardan biri.""

Hiçbir geliştirici bir incelemede daha nazik sözler bulmayı umamaz. Çeviriniz ve her şeyden önce cesaretlendirmeniz ve dostluğunuz için minnettarız. Umarım artık daha fazla Türk oyuncuya ulaşabiliriz!

Yıllar önce, Primordia'yı ilk çıkardığımızda, dergilerden ve büyük web sitelerinden çok sayıda düşmanca eleştiri aldık. Ama Türkiye'deki Level Magazine'den ve artık aktif olmayan iki web sitesinden (neooyun.com ve oyunefendi.com) güzel yorumlar aldık ve o zamandan beri Wormwood Studios ülkenizde destek buldu. İncelemede dediğiniz gibi, benim de aklımda, kalbimde ve hatta midemde (özellikle gözleme ve pide) Türkiye'de geçirdiğim çok güzel anılar var.

Ekipten çok teşekkürler ve sevgiler.

It's a philosophy that has only failed me once, and that isn't that time.

The other game by Wormwood, Primordia, is an excellent game - it's only flaw is that there isn't more of it, and that's not really a flaw - to create a world that the player desperately wants to know more about is a triumph in itself. Primordia is grim, but it's not dark. 

Shadowlands is dark. You've got your classic dark topics such as suicide, regret, remorse, sacrifice, death, 19th century poetry, entomology, even 1960's sci-fi, that sort of thing. It's well done. Some of it is straight up nightmare fuel. It's definitely more in line with Tormentum: Dark Sorrow in tone, but it is done well. 

I took about 4.5 hours to get through the game - normally that would be too short for the price, but with Wadjet Eye Games published games you get a tight narrative experience, and it is well worth it. 

The puzzles are not too obscure as to be punishing, there is help if need be (albeit mockingly condescending) and I never stopped in frustration. 

If you like class point and click puzzle adventure with pixel graphics, this is a no-brainer. Enjoyed is the wrong word, but I found it a thoroughly appreciated experience.",1643602937,1643602937,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1643605554,"Thank you so much -- it means a lot (psychologically as well as from a business-standpoint) for an indie developer to get player reviews, and you've found time for kind words about not just our game but also many others.

For me, first was Primordia until I played Strangeland. If you think this is another retro Point n' click adventure game, think it twice.

The plot was simply incredible... You don't know a thing at first, but the more you advance more you understand what's going on and what to do to make your way to one of the finals. The sensation that you start the game in the middle of the story is something that upsets me first, but when I finished the game my upset go away quickly.

If you played Primordia, this game will feel somewhat familiar in style, mechanics, need to think about what and how you are doing things, and many other similarities.
Very different story content, darker, more introspective, more personal, and often challenging to deal with- some of the visceral responses and emotions that it may trigger for different people based on their own life stories will be different.

I enjoyed this game, though not in a ""funny hahaha"" sort of way.
The subject matter is dark, and may not be something everyone can relate to or deal with.
Loss.
Loss of a loved one.
Loss of self and self-identity.
Loss of control.
Recovery.
Recovery of control.
Recovery of self and self-identity.
Those were my main take-aways.
Yours may differ.
Our real life experiences differ, and so will the experiences we have while playing this game.

Make lots of saves. I did not think to do so until about halfway through the game, so there are alternate endings I can get to by loading saves, but there are missed achievements I will need to restart from the beginning to unlock.
I did play without commentary and annotations. I will replay with both enabled. The commentary is always interesting, to get insight into what inspired the game, and what lies behind some of the scenes. Annotations as well- there is a good bit of mythology and lore, as well as references to scripture, literature, and cultures that may not be obvious. some I understood immediately, some I did not. 

This is a ""big words"" game. Meaning- there are a good number of words and concepts that are not going to make sense to everyone. It's not a game you can play without thinking- turn your brain on before launching the game. And be aware that doing so may lead to some uncomfortable or even emotionally painful moments. This isn't a game for everyone, and that is okay.

The whole experience is brought together by a wonderful performance from the inimitable Abe Goldfarb.

It's worth noting that the game is relatively short, and its elegant puzzle design is unlikely to stall your progress enough to pad out the runtime.

If you're a fan of them you'll probably enjoy this one, too. It has many of the qualities you can expect from their games like top notch voice acting (incl. Abe Goldfarb, probably the only voice actor I know by name) and absolutely solid puzzle design with some very unique ideas.

Having said all that, Strangeland is, well, strange (and bleak and surreal). It's hard to explain why and how it is strange without spoiling too much and this is best experienced blind. So, I'll just say that the core game requires you to go through the (almost) same scenarios many times. The storyline is very opaque and open to interpretation. The latter is not a bad thing per se but it means (and this might very well be intended because it fits the story) that you feel a bit lost because you don't know what you're actually trying to accomplish, although the genius of the game design is that you still kinda know what you have to do right at that moment (and if you get stuck there's a brilliant in-game and in-character help line, quite literally: There's a phone booth where you can call the operator who'll give you hints).

Strangeland is definitely a memorable experience, well worth playing but it is certainly not everybody's cup of tea. I recommend it to more experienced adventure game fans who are willing to embrace a bit of strangeness.",1642355332,1642355685,True,15,0,0.67085719108581543,1,True,False,False,False,,1642357077,Thanks for the kind words and thoughtful assessment—and for what sounds like a long history of supporting the P&C genre!

In which it seems to be woven together with interesting puzzle mechanics in which players can really interact with from different perspectives that really make the game a memorable experience. In addition to this, the voice acting is simply top notch thanks to Wadjet Eye Games! Honestly, the game feels like it could be an episode of the twilight zone and that's why this game is brilliant!  

Here are some of the reason's I bought Strangeland and why I'd recommend it even if your new to the adventure game genre!

First and foremost, Strangeland initially appealed to me because It had a very dark carnival style atmosphere that I really did enjoy. Simply, put the artist for Strangeland Victor Pflug was spot on for this game's atmosphere as far as the art goes as the art is very unsettling and it does actually send chills down your spine. The carnival atmosphere as mentioned above is also very creepy and it does actually make you question everything around you even including how you navigate puzzles. James Spanos, who programmed this game really did an exceptional job as the atmosphere around you that you interact with is very on edge and different from your own reality! Also, the characters that you come across in this carnival atmosphere are very strange and unsettling figures that really make you question not only the characters reality. but your own reality as your playing the game.  

However, what's very interesting to me is the actual story! The story is a very tragic tale and the way it develops is simply marvelous yet weird. It's worth noting here that during my first play through I found the story to be very confusing as the atmosphere around me really set me on edge and had me constantly question everything within the game including if this carnival was even real. I also constantly wondered if the carnival was actually all the manifestations of the tragedy that I was experiencing and thus it was manifested as a carnival of emotions inside of mind, instead of me physically being at a carnival. I did not pick up on any of the major hints or references during my first play through as the atmosphere was just very creepy! 

Regardless, I found the writing to be top notch and even though I was confused on my first play through of the game. I was still happy with the ending that I received at the end of the game partly due to how flexible I could be with my choices when solving puzzles. Then upon curiosity of knowing this game had multiple endings. I decided to replay the game a second time with both the commentary and annotation mode on. This was simply a brilliant idea! The reason why it was so brilliant is because it allowed me as a player to really understand and grasp the story that was being told in Strangeland. In addition to this, it also allowed me to see how the programmer, artist and writer really formed this world. I absolutely had a blast the second time around playing Strangeland because I loved listening to all the commentary by Mark Yohalem the writer as it was deeply profound what he had to say about his inspirations for everything within the game. In regard to listening to him, I absolutely had a different perspective in regards to the choices I made in the game a second time around in which definitely made me choose a different option, which significantly had the game end differently.

Overall, my experience of Strangeland has been really positive! I would totally recommended this adventure game to anyone! The artist and the programmer for this game really made the atmosphere super spine tingling in which you will experience will you play the game. In addition to that the writer also did an excellent job in which he crafted a story that was both terrifying in it's overall narrative but also beautiful at the same time depending on the choices you made. 

Interesting enough, upon doing more research about the writer. I found out that he graduated from Harvard Law and is a lawyer within Los Angeles, which honestly makes a lot of sense here as the writing is very detailed and indepth. Which is very refreshing as this game does not have a cookie cutter story and thus the story is very deep and meaningful in which all players will see when they experience the game for the first time or even the second time as I did. 

Overall, I give this game an 8/10! It's simply a good story that is being told! A story that is a tragedy but also doesn't have to be which is cool because you as the player can decide how the story ultimately enfolds. Great Job with everything Wormwood Studios!

So obviously I'm going to like this one.

Ya know, I knew of the whole ""stranger in strangeland"" quote, but I never realized this game is about twisted amusement park so I love that take on the quote :p I also like what feels like inspiration from Sanitarium in this one.

Honestly though, I am kinda tired of allegorical/symbolic inside your mind stories about man being unable to let go their dead wife(sometimes its kids or childhood trauma, but like 90% its dead wife), I feel like that is most common type of version of these kind of stories. Heck I personally almost always feel that games talking about mental health problems more often than not are kind of repetitive when compared to each other in that ""yes I have depression I know what its like, but I don't have deep scary voice telling me how much I suck, I think it myself"" if that makes sense? Like I dunno, I just don't get much catharsis from the concept itself, like maybe I'm supposed to be like ""this is relatable"" or maybe I'm supposed to be healthy person who is like ""oh so that is what it is like""? But I digress, I don't think that is actually problem here.

Despite that rant, this is extremely well executed take on that type of story, it doesn't hide its true nature at all, its very clear early on that what is happening isn't real and that really helps with it since its not used as plot twist. Heck game also avoids revealing at all what is happening ""really"" so that helps with allegorical nature of the game that it isn't about ""specific events with specific people"" so to speak. I think I got plenty of catharsis from good execution itself even if I'm tired of this type of stories in itself :D",1641886570,1641886570,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1641917774,Glad the game gave you catharsis!

Version courte : Strangeland est dans mon top 3 des jeux de 2021. Et pourtant je l'attendais au tournant, puisqu'il est l'oeuvre de Wormwood, qui a développé Primordia, un de mes jeux d'aventure préféré.

Si on devine les contours du scénario avant notre personnage, on reste impliqué par les détails et la symbolique de chaque élément. Les twists sont bien amenés, chaque personnage a une vraie profondeur et trop en dire serait gâcher le plaisir de la découverte ; c’est en partie sur ce point que je l’attendais et je n’ai pas été déçu par l’écriture.

Les énigmes sont également très réussies, ne tombant pas dans les pièges évoqués plus haut, gardant l’attention du joueur et récompensant la réflexion plus que les combinaisons hasardeuses. On dispose de tous les éléments pour progresser via les dialogues et les environnements, il nous laisse connecter les points. 

De cette forêt de qualités, il me reste en bouche une expérience marquante. Le travail est de très bonne facture, intelligent, dégueulant la folie par tous les pores de la direction artistique. Soyez conscient que les thèmes abordés ne sont pas faciles d’accès.

I want to say that the last 10 minutes of the game redeemed it - again, since it seems to be based on a personal experience, who am I to deny people their coping mechanisms and their own impression of what it feels like? But as a game, I cannot recommend it.

The ""adventure game"" of the game is solid. Good, even. You pick objects, use them, combine them, try different timing, etc. But it's hard to motivate yourself to do that when every character runs their mouth and says, in 400 different ways, wow, life is suffering. I am you. Everything has happened before. Here's a reference to mythology. Here's a quote from Bible. But only the sad parts. Because, you see, life is suffering. Here's something more about suffering. You are already dead. You are me. Ad nauseum.

I'm not saying you should hate the game, but before buying, please just watch 5 minutes of dialogue from this game on youtube and see it will be too grating for you or not.

So oder so ähnlich wird man indirekt vom Spiel selbst nach einer Weile Spielzeit gefragt, denn sterben könnt ihr in Strangeland recht schnell. Aber keine Sorge: Das gehört dazu und ist auch keine Bestrafung ala Dark Souls. Immerhin spielen wir hier ein waschechtes P&C-Adventure - und da stehen nun mal das Rätseln und die Dialoge im Vordergrund.

Als ""Unbekannter"" aka ""Stranger"" wachen wir weiß Gott wo auf (nennen wir es ""das Ende des Seins"") und treffen allerlei merkwürdige Gestalten auf einem Jahrmarkt des Wahnsinns. Ein augenloser alter Narr auf einer Bank, ein sprechender Rabe, ein gefräßiges 1000-Münder-besitzendes Etwas oder eine anmutig schöne Lady, die sich immer wieder in den unendlichen Brunnen zu ""Tode?!"" stürzt - die Welt von ""Strangeland"" hat genau das zu bieten was der Titel verspricht. Ist aber auch kein Wunder: Entwickler ""Wormwood Studios"", die schon das geniale Primordia erschaffen haben, übertreffen sich mit ihrem einzigartigen Stil und ihrer wunderschönen Welt tatsächlich noch einmal selbst.

Publisher ""Wadjet Eye Games"" ist zumindest für mich noch einer der Überlebenden alter P&C-Schule - unter deren Hut kommen so einige Pixel-Perlen raus: Gemini Rue, Shardlight oder die Blackwell Reihe - inklusive eben auch Primordia.

Die Rätsel in Strangeland sind meistens recht bodenständig und einfach zu eruieren (leichtes Kombinieren gibt sich die Hand mit ein paar Exklusiv-Mini-Games), doch an der Spielzeit von ca. 4h hätten die Entwickler definitiv noch schrauben können - zumal der Schauplatz insgesamt recht übersichtlich ist (dieselben 10 Panels nochmal in einer Alternativ-Version - und das war's im Grunde genommen schon).

[b][u]Bottom Line:[/u][/b]
Wem die kurze Spielzeit und die ausschließlich englische Sprachausgabe (nicht einmal deutsche Untertitel gibt's) nicht stört, bekommt ein bizarr abstraktes P&C mit wunderschönen Panels, unverbrauchtem Szenario und einem insgesamt sehr guten Pacing. Manchmal schwanke ich zwischen ""lieber kürzer und dadurch knackiger"" und ""lieber länger in dieser wunderschönen Welt verweilen"" - aber hier gewinnt für mich ganz klar die kreative Gesamtleistung unterm Strich. Ich hab jede Sekunde verschlungen und wollte immer wieder wissen wie die Geschichte nun weiter geht - auch wenn man keine ausführliche Erklärung bekommt was das nun alles bedeutet, da vieles nur angedeutet wird. Dazu tragen leider auch die sehr abrupten 4 Enden bei. Aber gerade für die, die eine rätselhafte Geschichte mit doppeltem Boden suchen, sind hier goldrichtig.

It's obviously a different genre and style of storytelling than Primordia, but continues to draw on influences from other games I loved (Planescape: Torment again especially, though different aspects of it than Primordia did, but this one feels like a wonderful Sanitarium love letter at times too) and I definitely plan to play it again once my brain's had time to rest and think it over.

It IS shorter than Primordia, and doesn't have the same vast store of random and semi-hidden dialogue to support as many playthroughs either. But I think it's definitely got at least two or three playthroughs in it (including a commentary mode like Primordia had) before you're likely to have ""seen everything"" and then just be going back to it like you'd re-read a good book. 

A more significant difference from Primordia is that Strangeland has a higher and more constant level of ""heaviness"" - what comic relief there is is infrequent and itself often pretty gloomy or dark. Hearing about that was one of the things that prompted me to wait until now to play it, as I wasn't really in the mood for that when it released. I'm glad I picked this game up at the right time, such that I was able to have a great experience with it, so I hope anyone out there thinking of getting it will give careful consideration to the same!

Beautifully written and powerfully atmospheric. I could feel just how much grief went into the creation of this deeply-personal game. I can't imagine many would make it through without feeling a strong resonance with at least a scene or two.

I love how unflinchingly bizarre the world of Strangeland is. Many scenes reminded me in the best way possible of the less-gratuitous (in terms of shock-value, at the least) David Firth animations, albeit far more heady; particularly the cicada and teratoma interactions. Every corner of Strangeland is dripping with Giger and Poe and various mythological and biblical allusions. These references thankfully serve to strengthen the unique narrative of Strangeland -- it never feels like a hollow vessel for previous works. In fact, there's a great comment or two in the game about leaning heavily on quotation.

The puzzles and interactive gameplay elements serve their purpose well in creating a connection to the narrative. I never felt too stuck or frustrated, and a simple call to the operator could point me in the right direction if I'd overlooked a cue.

I'm not particularly keen on replaying this one any time too soon, however. It was just a lot to take in!

The mix of dark and surreal fantasy blending cohesively with its rather nihilistic yet still twistedly hopeful story has left an impression on me that I certainly don't think I'll be forgetting any time soon. 

If I were to levy some criticism towards this one though it would certainly be the phone number puzzle, which felt a bit obtuse, but at the very least the game has a safety net feature via the payphone that is a lot more gracious at saving the player than Primordia's far more purist design. 
And also the other endings besides the true ending do feel like they lack a bit of substance when they're essentially punch lines for a joke, which is definitely in keeping with the story tonally but I guess my gripe there is I wish at least one of them carried perhaps as much thematic weight and taken as seriously. Not to say of course that they aren't properly set up, but if you somehow found yourself getting any of those endings before the true one then you might feel a bit disappointed and think ""is that it?""

A few times. A Stranger (if we choose to call him that) waking up on a tiny island in the middle of a black, brown and purple VOID next to a nightmarish circus, with a path illuminated inviting you right in adds it's own flavor though. Then you get eaten by a clown head, witness a woman in white jump down a well as you reach her, right after that you receive a phone call from the nearby booth in which the voice blames it all on you, only for you to turn around and see the same woman jump down the well AGAIN. Oh, and most of the things here will try to kill you in the first few minutes. Multiple times. Serves as a pretty fitting intro of how this game is going to play out. And of our protags self-preservation insinct. 
Which is surprisingly relevant this time.

[u]A warning about non-specific spoilers bellow!![/u]

Finally, another one from Wormwood Studios. First things first: It's not Primordia. Both are puzzle filled point'n'clicks with almost similar gameplay and sharing similar art style of decay, but Strangeland is different in themes and execution, though PERHAPS they share a few concepts, since both have protagonists that are quite philosophical, in a sense. I've seen some of the other comments and honestly, if you ONLY expect another Primordia, you'll most likely be disappointed. Now, with that out of the way, what about Strangeland? Admittedly, I haven't been digging too much info about the game before playing, just the general stuff that was available, as that was how I wanted it. So I was a little surprised that it turned to be, in my eyes, a much more personal tale than I was expecting. Although wrapped neatly in a surreal, creepy, depressed package. Psychological horror doesn't exactly have much to offer these days, but Strangeland takes a different approach which, in my opinion, is much more fitting for the genre. The horror part is more in the aesthetic than the story, the enviroment is inhabited by several quirky characters, both helpful and spiteful. I did enjoy annoying the voice from the phone booth on purpose, who actually ends up serving as your hint system should you get stuck. Whether you do or do not get all the narrative references you will feel the atmosphere it chooses and breathes. It also did play a bit on my own nostalgia, since I did recall several older adventure games with similar narrative style. =)
The voice acting is great and the art very beautiful, as usual, but it grew more detailed and refined. Anyone who played a few games from Wadjet Eye will probably recognize several of the voices and I wished there were more fullscreen illustrations than the few location intro pages we've gotten. Most of the puzzles aren't too difficult but present an adequate challenge. I felt that they take a little bit of a backseat this time to benefit the narrative. Several mostly depend on you listening to the dialogues well. The most frustrating thing that can happen is if the very rare pixel hunt prevents you from progressing or, as has happened to me a few times, you speak to an NPC before you've had the necessary conversation/object from a different NPC/enviroment. The Stranger is more of a mouth piece than a character. I did feel empathy towards him, but since his (understandable) fixation on specific events in his life is integral to the shaping of his character and the story as a whole, there isn't much room to learn more, though we do get some hints. How important that is however, depends on how you view the story the game is telling. Once you see past the creepy atmosphere you'll realize that the background and message has been done before and with less words, but as I've mentioned, I do get a personal point of view vibe from it here, so I welcomed it.
I do think the game gets a little lost in its own philosophying a bit. But perhaps that is because I was coming freshly from a similarly flavored debate before I played this and admittedly, most of the ones used in Strangeland share main themes. There's a mishmash of several philosophy theories, but also various mythological concepts. Mostly Norse and Greek, but a few others as well, even if just for one or two references. So if you're a fan of either or have read some of the works I THINK it's alluding to, you'll probably have a blast. If themes of the psyche, knowledge, surrealism, madness, fate, guilt, death and the helplessness to prevent that loss speak to you, you will find your mark here. If the Norse myths in a deeper sense than just ""VIKINGS!!"" are your jam, you'll probably find a kindred soul in this game. If not, well... depends on how much you don't mind getting a bit lost in all the metaphors. As you can see, it's trying to cover quite a few ones in one package. I'll have to replay with the dev commentary one day, as I'm sure it will bring light on much of the choices, because whether you like it or not, the one thing you can feel amidst all of that, is the developers passion for these subjects. 

In the end, I would prefer to be able to give a ""mixed"" review, but since it would be a positive mixed I'll stick with what I have available. Strangeland is unique in the genre of the slowly resurrected pixel style adventure games, perhaps BECAUSE it uses this genre to tell its message. It hides well behind macabre horror stuff that makes you think of old ""Freak Show"" carnivals and a surrealist story at first, but is actually about grief and self-reflection. And ultimately acceptance. To be able to accept losses and ourselves. And have the strength to move forward. It's heavy and bittersweet. I believe everyone can benefit by reflecting on that at least once in our lives, through any form of media we choose from.

Uh...I'd rather prefer Layers of Fear. though.

Long long version:
Uh...I can't decide whether I like or dislike this game. To me, it feels like eavesreading a personal diary which is filled with deep grief of loss and self destructive narcissism. I think...the worst part of grievance is when your heart is broken, your body also feels hurt - like headache or chest pain. And this Strangeland is like, the gamification of that symptom. It made me physically hurt - not because of its disturbing images, but because of its abyssal sadness. And though it must be dedicated to the lost one, this extreme sadness is a bit...self-immersive. Even narcissistic. That also made me physically sick. Well, I know it's eventually about the healing and the light, but why this should be this painful? 

H.R. Gigeresque artworks are not very appealing(but maybe that's just because I'm not a fan of Giger), and the overall game is a bit overstuffed with homages and metaphors. The commentaries and citations are interesting and enlightening, but make Strangeland like a kinda philosophy textbook. I still don't understand some references...oh, and the credit is unskippable. Well if the genre 'psychological horror' means 'the game which is filled with grotesque self images', Strangeland is the one...but I expected some more...or less...I don't know, but not Gigeresque thing. I can't explain. Sorry!

Anyway, I can't recommend this in a light mood, but it is still recommendable. Puzzles are logical, items are adequately located, and writing reminds me some Greek tragedies and Jewish poems. Abe Goldfarb's voice acting is somewhat exaggerated, but still brilliant. If you've experienced the loss of loved one, I could recommend this, but also I couldn't recommend this. Because it's like the healing process through self-harm. This path to the light in the sky is only reachable through many falls.

Almost by definition, if something heals you, it isn't harmful. The game does take the position that we have to face and accept the painful things that happen to us, but always with the understanding that there is a light that lies past that darkness. If we let pain paralyze us with fear, then we wind up trapped in the darkness of that pain. The only way out is through. 

You ask ""why this should be so painful,"" and I suppose my only answer is that our capacity to feel the pain of another is empathy, and empathy is the root of humanism. The hardest part of despair for me is the sense of isolation, that we are alone in a sorrow that no one else could possibly understand. When you play Strangeland, you aren't ""eavesdropping""; you're there by invitation, with the goal that if you recognize the Stranger's pain in yourself, you will feel less alone in that pain.

So, to the extent Strangeland causes pain, it's meant to be cathartic -- not the kind of lingering unpleasantness that I associate with depressing works (e.g., the movies Kids or Requiem for a Dream). If Strangeland caused you that kind of lingering unpleasantness, then I'm very sorry. The intention is entirely the opposite.

Anyway, that doesn't answer the question where the line should be drawn between a positive and negative review. To me, it sounds like you had an extremely strong experience with Strangeland, not entirely pleasant, but very real. And you seemed generally to engage with the game's mechanics and design. If you came away nevertheless with a negative view of the game, that's too bad. But this isn't a negative review to which my response is, ""I'm sorry,"" because much of what you describe as your reaction is the intended reaction. I feel worse if someone plays the game glibly and comes away with a superficially positive reaction.

Anyway, thank you again for your thoughtful take. I read your Primordia reviews years ago, and have checked out your other reviews from time to time. I appreciate your support of the genre."

but the story sucks, metaphors suck, the entire ride sucks, and the excessive amount of time padding almost made me not come back to this game. 

the ""puzzles"" are lazy
the stupid word play is lazy
the ""story"" is so painfully phoned in
and maybe it was part of the process but the repetition, false leads, and pixel hunting definitely don't add some metaphorical edge to the game. if it wasn't trying so hard to be weird, i'd just brush it off as classic AGBS

it has an option to have foreshadowing and references made pointed out to you, recommended for a second playthrough, and an apparent choice system, but honestly it fell so flat I'm not close to considering playing it again.

oh and the tutorial saying that all the information will be present, and given to you at any time so you don't have to remember anything? big fat lie.

tldr it's dark and edgy in a boring, phoned in, almost smug/masturbatory way, like a teenager wearing tight jeans writing song lyrics and that analogy spreads to the story, subject matter, written dialogue.
to quote the scribe; ""there is nothing new under the sun""

post-script edit;

I appreciate the dev response, and I want to be transparent in that I'm really not trying to be harsh, but I will concede that this was written soon after the first playthrough, and came from a place of disappointment having loved all of the wadjet eye games I've played. I thought it would be better if I added some more refined thoughts:

There are plenty of positives to this game, as i mentioned the art, but the sound design, the voice acting, etc. also. it's a very aesthetic game, and it shows. Even looking past the aesthetic and metaphoric tropes, the game part falls down hard imo. It's hard to give specifics without directly giving spoilers, and I'm not down for that, even marked up. Lets just say pacing and timing need work. some of the uncontrollable delays just felt tedious. along with some more thought to ag stuff, puzzles etc. For such an esoteric and abstract setting, the old combining inventory things and using items was surprisingly common garden and mundane in a lot of ways. Even some of the more imaginative sections are squandered by the game immediately spoonfeeding you the solution or making itself very apparent. 

Without trying to go too far onto a tangent, i may also be biased by a personal gripe i have with some of the themes and ideas approached by not just this game, in that as someone who suffers with such an antagonist, there's always some disconnect and discomfort when it comes to handling the parallels and differences expressed and abstracted by someone else. It can make going through games like this more effort than it should be.

Finally, I don't want anyone to be sorry or ashamed for what they've made here, there are plenty of great, positive reviews, and a lot of people are happy with the game as a whole. There's good work in there, honest. But personally I just can't recommend it.",1636747648,1636773073,False,5,0,0.522895276546478271,4,True,False,False,False,,1636749645,"At least it elicited a strong reaction!

The setting is just so nightmarish and bleak, and although it kind of disturbed me and brought up bad memories, I found it compelling enough to finish in one sitting.

Everyone in the Wormwood Studios team really knocked it out of the park. Compared to their previous game (Primordia), Strangeland shows an obvious improvement in visuals, sound, technical ability, and game design in form of reduced player friction. In many ways it's Primordia's opposite, with a small universe, a very personal, emotional story, and horror setting, so it may not be enjoyed by fans of that game. Likewise, you might like it if you didn't like Primordia.

Edit: If I had known the developer was going to respond I would have put more effort into this lol. I got so engrossed in the story that I played straight through without stopping. I love classic point and click games and one of the best improvements they've made is the ""operator"" who can give you hints if you're stuck. So many point and clicks of the past would just let you... wander aimlessly, I guess. 

It was certainly difficult in some places, and I do wish there had been a journal with key events, like another reviewer had mentioned. Sometimes I felt as though if I'd had a log of what I'd done, I wouldn't have had to call the operator so many times haha. 

The aesthetic reminds me of the old game ""Sanitarium"", which was pretty tough but hit on some heavy topics. This studio has another game so I'll probably check that out as well.

A+ game, music is great, art is incredible, the themes are dark and very ""human"". Gameplay is awesome, and 100% an improvement on point and clicks of the past.

I recall the only flaw in that game being the ridiculous amount of things to keep track of by the end, all of it piling up into a bit of vagueness. That applies 100x here.
This game is just filled with so many vagueries and metaphors that it's really easy to get lost (not in an enjoyable way). The set pieces by themselves are great but nothing in this game connects or provides a real sense of its vast world, more just a pile of ideas randomly sprung together - which i guess was partially the point, but it doesn't make for an enjoyable experience. There is no sense of adventure and progressing towards something like in Primordia, just a gradual descent into more and more nonsense. There is not a single real character to talk to that provides any understandable dialogue or a role besides plot-necessary info or mocking the protagonist. I recall a robot waiting to be saved in Primordia that didn't serve any narrative purpose and wasn't related to any puzzle, it was solely there to add to the atmosphere. This game lacks things like that. Some puzzles offer multiple solutions, but the larger ones mostly depend on a signular absurd solution.
With so little that is understandable or clear, it's impossible to really care about anything going on. Everything feels purposeful, yet so vague. I just spent most of the game scratching my head about what is going on. The story is a generic 'you have to save her' plot with abstract elements that come with exploring the main character's psyche, but the guy himself is so uncharacteristic and has absolutely nothing interesting to say, it's impossible to care for them aswell. Combine this with a vague dud of an ending where nothing feels resolved in any way and nothing is explained in the slightest.
The puzzles also, in comparison to the story, feel extremely 'adventure-gamey'. I was half expecting there to be the classic key-stuck-in-lock puzzle. In this completely alien bizzare mysterious metaphoric world i was expecting to do the same puzzle I had to do in the most common room escape games - that's how much the puzzles undermine the real game. There is even a hint system, which seems like it had a tremendous amount of effort put in it, yet comes across as lazy in execution and i think shows a lack of confidence in the puzzles actually making sense.

Don't get me wrong, by no stretch is this game bad, but I couldn't help but feel that the overall experience was lacking. In retrospect, I can not say that I was afforded a coherent experience, or any resolution to the many dark themes encountered along the way.

The game is very short and quite easy, I would regard it more as an interactive story as an actual puzzle game as it is mostly obvious exactly how to progress (and when I did get stuck, it is because I missed a particular line of dialogue). At no point was there a sense of problem solving or accomplishment. This is not a criticism but rather an observation, it is not etched into any stone that an adventure game must be puzzle driven. My criticism is that if the developers choose to forgo puzzle solving, they should offer some other form of substance.

[spoiler]The set up of the story is very intriguing, and throws the player into a cloud of mystery which they become excited to unravel. But by the time the player reaches the untimely conclusion to the game, it does not feel like any mystery has been unraveled at all. The game makes it very explicit that it is an allegory, but never reveals the subject of the allegory (and if it does, I am too dumb to have picked it up). The writing constantly builds up to a catharsis that never arrives, no sense of relive, conclusion or closure. It is made painfully obvious in pretty much every major turn of event that the protagonists grasp of reality is shrouded in some incredible agony of the soul (be it grief, despair, shame, guilt, insanity), and it is our task to guide him on his quest towards clarity. It is hence incredibly anticlimactic when the game pretty much says ""okay, clarity reached"" and ends with a borderline laconic sequence (on all possible endings). One could argue that the metaphor itself is the story, but I do not think they were nearly developed enough to carry the narrative on their own. It pains me to say, but by the end I felt like I was slapped in the face with a sequence of tropes which did not form a cohesive story. I found it a bit cheap, as if I am expected to find the game profound simply because it touches difficult subjects through clever imagery.[\spoiler]

I adore the atmosphere, the music, the grotesque graphics and the themes. I love how motifs of death are borrowed from a variety of cultures. The designers have no qualms with drowning the player with verbose bleak dialogue which makes the edge of insanity almost relatable. There are many moments in this game which are thought provoking and downright chilling. The only character which I found unbearable at times was the protagonist itself, which afforded much unneeded witticisms and stoicism which felt simply out of place.

So my bottom line is: it is a game, it is interesting, it has a lot of character and atmosphere, it is thought provoking at times. However, it is pretty short, pretty unsatisfying both puzzle wise and narrative wise, and it did not leave me with a sense of accomplishment or adventure. I am very partial about this game, but when all is said and done, it justified its price in time and money.",1633535981,1633535981,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1633536963,"Thanks for the thoughtful review.

Gauging puzzle difficulty is tricky.  We seem to get roughly equal reviews saying the puzzles were impossibly hard and the puzzles were trivially easy.  I tend to like challenging puzzles myself, and I thought we included a few of them, but ""challenging"" depends on one's puzzle-solving skill, so for people who cruise through Myst or Savoir Faire, Strangeland will seem like a joke."

There are metaphors to biblical texts, heavy use of symbolism, also the game does not shy from quoting various pieces of literature. It will take me multiple playthroughs to decipher most of what the game is trying to say.

I do like these type of games and was not dissapointed by Strangeland. Easily on the top 10 of memorable point'n clicks I've ever played.

Puzzles, while indeed strange, are reasonably logical considering where the story plays out. There weren't any long stretches of aimlessly trying everything on anything just to solve a puzzle. And I think that making the puzzles any harder wouldn't have done justice to the story. Difficulty is fine where it is. There's also an in-game hint system which is very well incorporated into the story itself. Very unique.

While being a relatively short game, it's was fascinating from start to finish. Lots of symbolism in dialogs, which might not be everyones cup of tea. Personally, I enjoyed every second of it. Loved the art style, the story it was telling and most importantly, *how* it was telling the story. Voice acting was great for the most part. Murmur was exceptional.

The themes of grief, loss, struggle, acceptance and transcendence are all explored in the powerful writing in this game. While the voice cast were familiar from the last game, their performances carried the game well, and I never felt pulled out of the story by them. The art is fantastic, evoking surrealist works from Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and H.R. Giger, but with a pixel art style. The game play is light, with a few puzzles, and some dialogue choices, but nothing that requires moon-logic to complete, and the narrative has a lot of tolerance of error, in fact in some parts, dying is actually required to progress! You can finish this game in a single setting if you have a few hours to spend, but that seems like just the right length to me, given the heavy nature of the subject matter. 

The obvious comparison point for Strangeland would be 1998's Sanitarium, another fine game that mixes horror with the adventure game format and I would say Strangeland holds its own there. For my part, Strangeland reminds me more of the film Eraserhead or the comic Sandman in that I find myself pondering the themes long after finishing the game.  Strangeland reminds me of playing  Wraith the Oblivion, where ghosts wander the shadowlands, bound to the world by fetters from their former life and fighting for control of their soul with their shadow, which represents everything they fear, hate or suppress about themselves. It nearly felt like a licensed game in that World of Darkness setting, which I loved about it.

Had this game released in the time before COVID it might not have the impact on me that it does. The real world tragedy very much lent pathos and connection to the story that Strangeland is telling. In a way the game is a welcome catharsis that helps make sense of the victims of the pandemic. Strangeland proves that it is possible for lightning to strike twice, and I look forward to the next project from this talented team.",1630468809,1630468809,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,1630470106,What a beautiful review.

I have only played one of their previous releases, Primordia, which was insanely good. I was actually notified by the developer after I reviewed it of Strangeland's close release, and had high hopes. And those hopes were met incredibly well, and makes me want to try their other games as well.
Strangeland takes a hit at what seems to be a man's mental downfall into his own mind, and even dying can't bring him out. Cryptic riddles and dialogue are all over this game, which would be much more annoying if the game was longer. However, since the average time seems to be 5-7 hours, I got used to it and began to pick up on exactly what was happening without being totally clueless. The biggest aspect I absolutely LOVE from this game is the art style. As a lover of pixel art, Strangeland knocks the ball out of the park with the art. From complicated backgrounds and even surprisingly detailed faces to even just weird hallucinogenic-like pieces, I always just found myself stopping in awe with how beautiful the game looks. The detail and art style honestly rivals Blasphemous, another insanely beautiful pixel game.
Puzzles were not too difficult and I liked the hint aspect people can use if they get too lost. Every time I solved a puzzle, continuation felt rewarding. The voice acting was also excellent. I immediately recognized Abe Goldfarb's voice (he voiced Crispin in Primordia), and he and everyone else involved really gave the game it's own charm. The characters, messaging, music, and dialogue are all there.
All in all Strangeland delivers a standout and memorable point and click adventure with gorgeous art, interesting dialogue, and satisfying puzzles.

- Navigation from screen to screen is fast, they're almost always framed to be immediately able to double-click the other end, making for fast and fluid traversal / gathering / experimentation.
- A repetitive action (of grabbing something 6 times at the same place) is automated once you proved to the game you understood it had to be done 6 times, by doing it 2 times

And finally, ambiance / story / visuals / voice acting / music are all excellent. But I finish with them (even though they are the ""meat"") because it's rare these days for me to enjoy a point&click, given how much they still generally suck with regard to QoL / help / respecting the player, and how much they repeat bad recipes from the past.

Sharing many strengths with their previous entry, Primordia, Strangeland features superb visuals, writing and voice acting. It also feels like a deeply personal game, filled with a lot of sadness and grief.

The Writing & Performance

With an adventure game, you want a strong story. With Strangeland, you get a dreamlike, contemplative narrative of one man's journey through his own trauma related to his dead partner. The actor who plays the protagonist (Abe Goldfarb) does a lot of heavy lifting here, and I appreciate the range and passion he put into each performance. When it comes to a dreamlike setting like this, it's difficult to keep a story thread that is still coherent, and while I don't think it completely overcomes this limitation it wields it very well. (Shout out also goes to the clown (who I believe was Mike Pollock) who created a really distinctive laugh with the bizarre clown character.)

The Art

There have been comparisons to other artists such as H.R. Giger or Beksinski, but I don't think it's quite right. It's gothic and has body horror, but I feel it's distinct enough that it doesn't feel derivative like The Medium felt at times with Beksinski. That said, it does a great job getting that epic, despairing aesthetic that the previously mentioned artists evoke. There are multiple sequences (some featured in the trailer) that I really enjoyed as morbid art. The music and sound design also fit perfectly. The ambient sound was on point.

The Puzzles

Adventure games often hinge on the quality of its puzzle design. Strangeland opens with an interesting but welcome message that you will have access to all the information you need in any puzzle, and that there would be no information you need to memorize. This was true, and it also helped me solve a certain puzzle. If you get stuck otherwise, there is an in-game method to get hints that I found were always the right balance between being helpful without giving it away.

Conclusion

If you're a fan of point & click adventure games, I would get this without hesitation. It's really great to see the devs of these games grow and flourish, and I hope to see more.

P.S. Dear Mark Y --

You responded to my review of Primordia in 2016, and I had never had a dev respond to my review before. It was awesome. I also see you're responding to reviews here, so I just wanted to say something to you directly. Both this game and Primordia are some of my favorite games, and I love to see these sorts of story-driven adventure games still being made in 2021. Thank you so much for you and your team's effort in making these cool experiences. Please keep making more, as any game from Wormwood Studios is an automatic buy from me. I didn't realize it had been so long since you had released this one -- I guess Steam has room for improvement in surfacing games from developers I really like (though better late than never). Cheers to you and the team -- thanks for the great experiences!!

P.P.S.

Although I enjoyed the puzzles and the weirdness of the setting/characters, the actual substance behind the writing feels a little weak.

And although it sounds cool in the moment, upon reflection it doesn't particularly tie together that well to an overall narrative. A large part of the supposedly profound and insightful dialogue is just rambling without any strong connection to a central narrative.

Maybe that's what the writer wanted to preserve a more dream-like feeling to the experience and project a wandering mind just like in a dream, but I found myself speed-reading some dialogue and clicking through it faster than the voice could deliver it as it wore on me and started to feel a little pretentious.

I mean I'm glad that they're obviously talented enough to make a point and click with very little frames, BUT THAT'S JUST FUCKING BORING!!! The WHOLE POINT of a good Point & Click is that it's long as fucking shit, and there are LOTS of frames to go through!!! Wormwood's are even MORE SO HELD BACK SOMEHOW by the Point & Click genre's most important and prominent lesson, FUNDAMENTAL to a good Point & Click! Coming across a frame in the game with one or multiple puzzles that require items from other frames, and backtracking to it later on!!! Because you have to STILL do that in Strangeland AND Primordia, it makes the environments eventually get too fucking old for your liking AND BORING!!! Because by following basic point and click game logic when it comes to backtracking, which is probably the ONLY thing Wormwood is good at, it takes AWAY EVEN MORE re-playability AWAY from their games!!! You've GOTTEN bored of the same environments over and fucking over again, you KNOW the solution to every puzzle or atleast most of them by memory, until you can basically solve ALL of them when you replay the game, because you'll remember EVERYTHING!!! You've TALKED to the surmount of NPC's the developers at Wormwood even bothered to put in the game! AND YOU HAVE LISTENED TO A VERY SHORT STORY!!! POINT AND CLICK IS ABOUT AS LINEAR AS IT  FUCKING GETS!!! WHILE STRANGELAND AND PRIMORDIA ARE AT THE MOST, INEXPENSIVE, REALLY CHEAP GAMES, IT STILL FEELS LIKE I COMPLETELY WASTED MY FUCKING MONEY!!! ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SOME STUPID ASSHOLE CHARACTER LIKE CRISPIN OR EVEN YOU ON A RETARDED TELEPHONE THAT BABY THROUGH ALL THE PUZZLES IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT!!! IF WORMWOOD JUST DIDN'T INCLUDE THESE STUPID USELESS CHARACTERS, THEN MAYBE I'D ACTUALLY CONSIDER THEIR GAMES ""GAMES"", FUCK NO!!! THESE INCONCEIVABLE RETARDS LITERALLY TOOK AWAY ALL PLAYER CONTROL IN ALL OF THEIR  ONLY TWO GAMES, YOU CAN LITERALLY BEAT FUCKING BOTH OF THEM ON FUCKING AUTOPILOT!!! I HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY NOT USE AN IN-GAME FUCKING CHEAT INCLUDED BY THE DEVELOPERS THEMSELVES TO ATLEAST PLAY SOME SEMBLANCE OF A VIDEO GAME!!!

The last things I have to say is that: Strangeland's story is borderline retarded when we don't even learn who the stranger and some copy and paste blonde bitch I don't even care about ARE, even though the developers at Wormwood could've just gotten off their lazy incompetent asses and just given them ANY KIND OF BACKSTORY!!! I don't care about the people in this world!
Primordia's story is actually good, but again, all of that is completely fucking ruined, because the game's too FUCKING SHORT YOU RETARDS!!! Why couldn't we have just stretched out the adventure, you idiot's literally chose THE VIDEO GAME GENRE THAT HAS NEXT TO KNOW FUCKING RE-PLAYABILITY!!! Unless you want to re-scramble the letters or numbers or symbols or what the fuck ever for a stupid numbers puzzle somewhere in the game, THAT'S FUCKING IT!!!

For the people who are not a WormWood employee reading this review, your money is either spent on a MUCH LONGER point & click game or a COMPLETELY different fucking genre entirely, that actually has some goddamn re-playability for fucks sake. Buy an action game, or a strategy game like Civilization 6 and all its DLC, because I know I could've done way better than all this crap. 0/10 for both.",1627985630,1627985630,False,0,4,0.220399126410484314,2,True,False,False,False,,1628009917,"It's one thing finding the game disappointing, which I understand and we apologize for it, we always want to satisfy all our players. At the same time, I think bashing us intellectually for wanting to make the game more accessible to people and not forcing people to alt-tab to find out the solution, is not a good take. Both in-game systems are integrated and not mandatory, nothing forced you to talk to Crispin in the case of Primordia and nothing forced you to hit 0 on the phone.

Point and click games in their majority do not have much replayability, minus different endings. At the end of the day, we're making the games we want to make, it's hard to read a review that's very insulting and actually take it seriously.

If you want, i'll gladly pay you back the money. Even offer to buy you a different game. Please edit your review and blank out the r words tho.

Adding a backstory to a game that works as a vessel for the player would be too cheesy and too done to death. The game works as a mirror, if you don't have much to say, neither will the game."

Too bad I cannot rate it as high as the other games published by Wadjet Eye Games, because for me there were too many external references. There's almost not a single line not referencing some book, or Scandinavian mythology, or psychoanalysis, or being a direct quote. I would like to get to know the story itself, the characters, their backgrounds, their past. Instead, sometimes I felt like I was reading through somewhat obscure lecture notes. Discovering hidden allusions and references is fun, but not when you're doing that constantly.
 
That aside, the game raises fairly serious topics, pixel art is decent, puzzles are good, and Abe Goldfarb's voice acting is great as always. It's probably worth playing just to hear him again.

I would love to see an extended version someday. If we could get more mundane stuff about MC's life, that would both make us sympathize with him more and create a great background for all those allusions to shine against.

The style of art will not be for everyone true but if you can look past the retro look and focus on the story it has substance.  The game is full of puzzles, finding items to use on other items, combining items to make new ones and solving riddles to progress.

Primordia was a brilliant game that I devoured from start to finish because of its atmosphere, characters, music and voice acting. Strangeland is different, but shares all the same qualities and is brilliant just as well. I will not pretend to publicly interpret its meaning and I feel there is no need to do so: the story had meaning for myself and that is all that matters.

Some notes gameplay-wise: The recently released Linux version started fine but had some problems with a choppy mouse cursor, so I played the Windows version via Proton. Worked just fine as well. I finished the game in basically one sitting and never had a technical problem. Used the in-game hint system (btw, brilliant way to implement this) twice when I was stuck, but otherwise the puzzles fit right into my line of thinking and I could concentrate on the story.

Best part of the game and following Primordia one could think that this is a Wormwood staple: the combination of atmospheric music and voice acting.

[i][b]Strangeland[/b][/i] is a surreal, nightmarish point'n'click adventure game, deeply allegorical, set in a twisted, creepy carnival. With symbols, metaphors, archetypes and associations galore, this game is all about workings of the subconscious, the unraveling of the mind, the underside of working through grief and guilt.  

It's a long-awaited title from the creators of [i]Primordia[/i] (and this should already be enough to get you interested), but instead of its decaying mechanical world amidst desolate post-apocalyptic landscapes, here we have something more organic, curvy, wavy, meandering, almost Gigeresque, even if still a bit monochrome... and decaying. The game is a visual delight, even with rather disturbing imagery or precisely because of it. Art is pixelated like its predecessor, but more smooth with subtle animations from details in the fantastical scenery to full blown CGs. Every creature, every weird thing you encounter is there to reflect the inner.

By setting it in a surreal carnival, Strangeland immediately calls to mind another nightmarish horror game, a great macabre classic [i]Sanitarium[/i]. There's something inherently creepy about carnivals, a place where anything could happen, like a dream, wondrous  and pleasant, turning into a nightmare. The dark side of what's supposed to be fun and shiny and colourful, the underbelly, the unconscious (id). A Purgatory of sorts, it's a fitting stage for the Danse Macabre. *1

[h3][i]You never know till the end whether something's a comedy or a tragedy[/i][/h3] 

I heard this line a few times in the game, and besides it expressing the tragicomical nature of one's life/fate/story, it got me thinking how unlike [i]Cat Lady[/i] which was relentlessly bleak and depressing, I actually had... fun here, even a few laughs, but there wasn't any real doubt how this would turn out. Still, with all the cryptic lines and wordplay, references, associations and symbolism, witty quips, I had great fun. Hey, I rode a giant cicada after all~

You're a [i]Stranger in a Strange Land[/i] and whether your first thought is Moses or Heinlein, feeling a disconnect (from self) is a big theme. Well, you are thrust into this weird, twisted carnival in a straitjacket, totally confused and after going through this giant clown's mouth (a real comedian telling you grim jokes every time you pass through it - the joke's on you), you witness a woman jump into the well. Immediately you get a phone call telling you ""It's all your fault"". This part reminded me of Lynch's [i]Lost Highway[/i] a bit, with a mystery man acting as the accuser, the adversary (Satan, eh), your nemesis, alter-ego, or The Dark Thing as it's called here. It was clear this would be an introspective game (literally) that deals with coping with loss, learning acceptance and finding peace with yourself. In that sense, I wouldn't call it a mystery, even though it is for Stranger while he explores this strange world, trying to kill The Shadow and save The Woman, all the while falling deeper into himself until he's ready to confront the truth.

[h3][i]A masquerade of metaphors[/i][/h3]

The game is very rich thematically and going through it all and peeling all the layers of meaning is beyond the scope of this review (some deeper analysis would be fun), but I will mention some that jumped at me. 

There are clear inspirations from Biblical and Norse mythology, myths in general. The image of the blind old scribe under a tree with a raven spitting words at him clearly points to Odin under the Tree of Life. But later it gets a poisonous snake on it making it also into the Tree of Knowledge. The idea of a poisonous knowledge is tightly connected to another prevailing theme: comfortable darkness. One character says: ""Better to be in the darkness, I can't see or be seen"", expressing a subconscious desire to repress, to forget. ""You took my shadows!"" ""At last I was truly in the dark.""  Darkness takes away sight, but also gives it. 

Masks/masquerades is a reoccurring motive and comes in threes. Three Valkyries, Fates, Weird Sisters - The Triple Goddess, act as Greek Chorus of sorts. And then mirrored, we have the triple me, Past, Present and Future self. They all wear masks, masquerading as men ('cause there's place for only one Woman here' - heh) or you. A mask is a cover, worn by an actor in a tragedy, but also a weight, a burden. Beneath one mask there is another, like a matryoshka. 'Can you truly take off your mask? Set down your burden?' What is beneath it all, at the bottom? What bottom?

This game likes words, words to forget, words to remember, wordplay (tarot, rota, Inside-Rotta, Nein-Eve, Nineveh, 83, Eitri), different meanings of words (imago, masca), word puzzles etc. I loved it! Lots of interesting insights can be gleaned from 'machine-men', dead rats and all the mirror symbolism, but alas, no space for that here. 

Overall, the symbolism isn't too obscure to leave you scratching your head, but just right to tickle your imagination and get your inner wheels spinning. Nor is it too obvious but when it is, the game is aware and comments on it: ""You walked through your mouth to get here"" of course it's in your head; ""Only a fool thinks he needs a broken mirror to reflect a broken man""; golden-haired Woman, his shining light, indicating idealisation and pedestaling etc. Also, there's a commentary and annotations mode that explains the intentions and meaning behind some symbols, but while interesting, I wouldn't rely on it for interpretation...*2

[h2][i]What bottom?[/i][/h2]

Underneath it all (at the bottom?) Strangeland is a classic point'n'click game, but like all Wadjet Eye Games I played, one that doesn't have all those annoying gameplay elements the genre is famous for. There's no pixel hunting, only a few hotspots per screen, small inventory isn't full of useless junk (well depends on how you see a dead rat skin). There's a nice feature: you can browse your inventory by just scrolling your mouse wheel and not actually opening it. And despite the crazy, bizarre setting there's no bizarre logic involved when it comes to solving tasks... mostly. Only one puzzle (phone number) felt a bit out of the left field, but I wouldn't call it bizarre, just obscure. In hindsight, it makes perfect sense and utilizes wordplay this game likes so much. But hints are strewn across the environment, so you can always solve things in different ways. In the end, if nothing works, there's phone hint system where all you need to do is dial 0 to be pointed in the right direction. Not to mention, listen to the crow-raven! Actually listen to every cryptic line for they may not be so cryptic, but actual hints for puzzles, along with having deeper symbolic meaning. I really like how the writing is seamlessly incorporated into the gameplay. *3  

You can die here. You should die. Die a lot in every possible way (there's a prize). Sometimes dying is a part of puzzle solving. But since this is a dreamlike world, you don't lose anything, you just respawn at the start screen. Backtracking isn't actually daunting (and there's a fast travel at exits) cause the gameworld isn't that big. There are a few locations and while very creative visually and even with different versions (Deadland), the world still feels small, for better or worse.  

At bottom, with excellent writing and voice acting, creative visuals and dark ambient music, Strangeland is a must play for adventure fans. Even though it's on the shorter side and while feeling small in width, it seems bottomless in depth. You bet I recommend it!

[b]One.
Adventure game design[/b]

Context: I've never been a point-and-click adventure game player. I can understand the appeal of FPS, RTS, blobbers and RPGs of old, but the solution-finding process in classical adventure has always frustrated me. I could never get the feel for consistency of puzzle logic in any of the games in this genre that I played - with probably the sole exception of [i]Loom[/i].

Now that I've said it, at no point did [i]Strangeland[/i] frustrate me. All the threads that your mind should pick up are clearly communicated, you are never left without at least some sort of direction, never forced to just roam around clicking everything or trying all of your inventory on every object in the world. Does it mean [i]Strangeland[/i] is the best point-and-click adventure I've ever played? Well... Yes. I'm not a connoisseur, but yes.

There's also an ambiguous matter of a phone booth. At literally every moment and every step of every puzzle you can pick up the phone, dial up 0 and the voice on the other end will just blatantly spill out what you have to do. I understand why the author would want it in the game: to give the soft modern player an option to simply skip the puzzle. But... I found myself using it a bit too often in the second half of the game. And I know why. Because of blunt laziness. I know for a fact that if I'd put in a tiny bit more effort to remember my options (or in a few cases any effort at all), I would have solved the puzzle without help. Not calling for help requires a certain degree of adventure game ethic which I know I lack. It would probably be a good idea to limit access to it with... Something. I don't neccessarily mean objects like coins to be found in the world, but maybe a negative aesthetic change in the player model? Or a phone booth entourage? A rude mockery  of the protagonist who calls way too often - by every character in the game? Something to psychologically discourage the player from abusing the hint system would be needed.



[b]Two.
Everything else[/b]

I didn't like the objective narrative behind the allegories.
There's way too much unneccessary talk in this game in my opinion.
The protagonist voiceover is mixed: sometimes he sounds half-hysterical and out of breath which is good, but sometimes he's confident and even witty which is just out of place.

That being said, let me describe the feeling I got from playing this game. It's as if I'm lying down on my back and my abdomen is open, and it's a filthy ocean without bottom - with unidentifiable chunks of something sporadically floating up to the surface. And somebody is stirring it all with a huge wooden paddle-like ladle and occasionally feeding me with it.
Logocentrism be damned, this is a game to live through. It's loathsome crippling self-consumption made into an interactive experience. Perhaps, it lacks true XXth century-style inhumanity to go all the way, but other than that it's as far as it can go.
And also Jungian tradition is strong with this one.

Although narratively I would like it to be even less polished, even less consistent, even less streamlined, even more spasmodic, even more guttural, but atmospherically it is all of those things and then some.
And also the best point-and-click adventure game I've ever played, whatever that means.",1626006131,1626006131,True,20,0,0.630690634250640869,10,True,False,False,False,,1626027041,"Quite a review! :)  I really enjoyed reading it.

""The best point-and-click adventure game I've ever played"" -- especially coming from a Loom fan -- means a lot. I liked the description of the feeling you got from the game, as morbid as it is.

Re: the hint system, your reaction is reasonable, but I disagree. It's a tricky thing to calibrate, but players actually get quite mad when soliciting hints results in the game insulting them too much. Even as it is, some players have felt the ""operator"" is too insulting. The reason is that most players who get stuck are ALREADY frustrated, and they tend to feel the fault is with the game for not clearly signaling what they should do, rather than with themselves for missing the signals. (This is a fair reaction, and a natural one.) When the game then attacks them for needing help, the result is a counter-attack from the player at the game -- ""You think I'm stupid? *You're* stupid!"" So the goal is to have at least a little resistance built in (e.g., the hint system isn't available in every room, it requires a couple steps to get a hint, the hint dispenser mocks you for needing them), but no too much resistance.

And, above all, the reality is that if you make in-game hints too much of a hassle, players will just alt-tab to a guide. This is an all around worse situation. It breaks immersion, it creates a considerable risk that the player will see solutions to other puzzles that he could've solved on his own, and even setting those issues aside, it means that the first hint the player gets is an outright solution (whereas we often give the player a nudge the first time, then a solution).

I don't disagree with the sentiment that easy hints tend to take away some of the fun of adventure games, but since easy hints are going to be there no matter, you have to mitigate the issue rather than trying to solve it outright.

Anyway, thanks again for giving the game a go and for leaving your review!"

Overall, a solid adventure game. Art is great, puzzles are largely intuitive, the world itself is well-realized and internally consistent, and there are nice little touches (try drinking the acid) that are much appreciated. The script is clever and well-written, voice acting is great too. This is from the same studio that put together Primordia, and I managed a recent replay of that as well. You can clearly see how they've improved since Primordia, making the interface more lightweight, eschewing tedious puzzles (the second ""bread"" puzzle plays with this in a great way), and cleaner, faster-to-traverse levels.

Definite buy, get Primordia as well (I'd say Primordia is actually the superior game due to its setting/universe)
While you're at it, Wadjet Eye's back catalogue is full of winners, and download Yahtzee's Chzo mythos if you're into some creepy adventure games. 
Looking forward to the studio's next game 

[spoiler]which hopefully won't be another fever dream. It means the events are insignificant in the game's own universe, and even the denouement is unsatisfying. One minute in: We are in a dream sequence, and the ending will feature the main character letting go of whatever trauma is behind his self-inflicted torture, and you can't save the girl, because that is what always happens in dream sequences. So formulaic. And you don't discover enough about the events underlying the trauma to make that interesting either.

--- A sorter version in english ---
If you want to feel the glorious age of adventure games from the 90s, then without any second thought you must play Strangeland. The atmosphere and the theme might not be everyones cup of tea, but that does not exclude that it is a very good game. From the sound and the audio, to the story, that might be simple to some, it is great. The biggest flaw, for me, might be the exclusion of cancelling an interaction, which might cause more deaths than normally. Overall, this project makes you excited for the future of Wormwood Studios and their next announcement.

It's astonishingly hopeful, with a resolute protagonist who inches his way forward to a deeper understanding of a difficult truth. I was quite pleased to learn that the game refused to wallow in a morose tone, rather it peppers its macabre imagery and horror in doses, balanced by a sober sense of humor. It makes me wonder how many iterations there were in regard to the overall tone of the game. Was there a version that leaned too heavily on self-punishment and woe? I've yet to place the numerous metaphors the game presents, but I very much look forward to replaying it with the commentary to get a better grasp of some of the more minute details (the 3 men, the mermaid). Upon reflection, I was surprised by how little fat and filler there is. It's a very economical title that makes great use of its maps, the voice acting was very well done and the art is a delight. I was reminded a lot of Twin Peaks: The Return, particularly the black & white segment toward the end with the more frequent macabre imagery. I do wish there was more music as there were particular moments/rooms that had standout pieces. 

Puzzles: I only got stuck with the phone number puzzle. I had thought I had it, but I was underthinking it. I appreciate the in-game hint system, and chuckled when the operator called me an idiot. I smiled when I heard the solution and commend the devs for the solution.

Edit: thoughts after 2nd playthrough with commentary/annotations 

Strangeland is a wonderful little point-and-click adventure title that succeeds through its great writing, art, and world design. I'd say the puzzles were on the easy side, with the game offering sufficient tips through its NPCs, or built in phone-line. Thematically, withing the medium of games, Strangeland is reminiscent of Silent Hill 2, but with a much more literary pedigree. That's not to say it doesn't deliver visually, as the game progresses you will be subject to grotesque images that rival anything in the medium (my particular favorite was the close-up of the Dark thing).

In sum, Strangeland is a compact experience that does a great job of ushering you through its puzzles and maps at a brisk pace.",1625107269,1625466962,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1625109708,"We iterated a *lot* -- but the tone never changed.

I don't say it as a comparison, but just that they're of similar flavors while maintaining its own identity, which is a hard thing to pull off.

PROS:
- A beautiful game. It's exceptionally designed and perfect for someone who has an appreciation for the strange and the dark. Things get twisted and weird in this game, and it's delightful.
- The voice acting is VERY good, and I rather enjoyed the dialogue as a whole. It can lean into philosophical one moment, then be frank and cruel the other. 
- The puzzles are just like the rest of the game: unusual. Fortunately, if you get stuck anywhere, you can easily find your way in-game. 
- There are alternate endings naturally!
- The music is uncomfortable in just the right way that suits the aesthetic of the entire game.

CONS
- My biggest issue with the game is probably the lack of content for the endings. I understand you're never going to completely satisfy everyone, but I feel like even the majority of the endings for one of their previous games, Primordia, felt like it was fulfilling and needed little additional fluff. Here, I feel like we barely get much in return, about 20 seconds for each ""choice"". I will argue that most of the endings in Strangeland do work well for the game's general tone, but I would have liked a little more out of the theoretical best ending. However, I recognize that this is just a personal take, and I otherwise loved the experience of the game, which is really the most important part. 

Overall, I do recommend Strangeland!

Without veering too far into spoiler territory (which I think is risky even behind a spoiler tag in responding to a useful review that I hope other players read!), I tend to view the ending as actually starting during interactive portions of the game (i.e., it's not a cutscene ending, it's an ending sequence).

That said, I remember years ago being extremely annoyed at truncated ending cutscenes in a number of games I had played -- feeling that they were more like a semi-colon or an ellipsis than a period or exclamation point, if that makes sense. I can see that criticism here, though, as you say, I think the endings fit with the general tone of the game."

After playing that, I knew that these devs were serious about their craft, and consider them to be artisans now more than ever in the point and click adventure genre.  Strangeland took everything that Primordia was, and ran with it, creating a dark, poetic, introspective metaphorical world within the protagonist's head. You are immediately dropped off alongside the protagonist as he wakes up in this bizarre nightmare world. The art is crisp and fresh while still being reminiscently familiar, and beautifully dark. Shades of brown, black, and grey are emphasized with perverted yellows and oranges, and fluorescent neon purples giving an ambiance of sickness and putrescence. the color palette with the maddening landscape perspective is packaged into a back alley carnival freak-show with twists and breaks, representing the shattered memories of a broken man. Throughout the game, plot points are revealed in conversation that is fully voice acted - and well done at that. All in all, the moody soundtrack, beautifully horrifying art work, and puzzle / conversation centered game play give a beautifully little packaged story, and a very fun ride that keeps you clicking through the world hoping to discover what new monstrosities lay in wait at the next sideshow tent.

As a great fan of Wormwood studios earlier endeavor Primordia, I was just about ready for another point-n-click epic. However, comparisons will not fill up much of this review, as Strangeland remains a story set in an entirely different universe. It is a change almost literally like night and day, where Primordia seemed to be set in a perpetual dusk, where the morning sun almost but never manages to rise over the horizon. The realm of Strangeland, on the other hand, is eternally bathed in the cold gleam of twilight, enchanting this carnival of the macabre with an ominous glow.

The rusty art-nouveau architecture of a steampunk city have been replaced by a nightmarish H.R. Gigeresque carnival, where monsters and poets stand side by side to unravel the tormented mind of a lone traveler. Though the story is not in its entirety simple, it is best summarized in its core content. You play as a nameless wanderer, though sometimes referred to as “the stranger”, who have to navigate a surreal circus of the grotesque, trying to save a nameless woman and fight the dark thing which plagues this world. When playing this game you might come to experience puzzles of the classical adventure game variety and harrowing psychological symbolism.

If you’re a fan of adventure games, Strangeland is certainly an experience that should be savored. From the sprites of tar and flesh to the stanzas of death and despair, it heralds a journey of sober self-reflection, and while I’m not personally a veteran from the LucasArt and Sierra On-Line era, Strangeland bears the mark of a mad savant standing on the shoulders of giants.

Everything from backgrounds to set pieces to all the things that go bump in the night all work so well together to build this Lovecraftian type world that I just wanted to explore it all. The art style and surreal atmosphere definitely drew me in immediately. 

The story is pretty good too (no spoilers!) and I loved all the interactions with the other strange denizens that populate the carnival and enrich the plot. I do want to mention that the story is not spoon fed to you. It's often told with symbolism and metaphors which you have to look out for. One thing is for sure, there's a lot to go back and reflect on once you've finished the game. Some things that didn't make sense prior will make more sense after the story's conclusion, but there's still a lot of mystery and things left to be debated and guessed at. I foresee many fan theories in the future about what's really going on at this devilish carnival. 

Puzzles are balanced and some even have multiple solutions. Not too hard, not too easy. There's also an in-game hint feature if you get stuck which I admittedly used once or twice. How to progress made me think and ponder at times, but I never felt stuck for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. I was always able to figure things out eventually by using my brain and that is a sign of great puzzle design.

I adored Primordia and therefore was very excited for this entry. 

With all honesty, Strangeland is a mixed bag. The visuals are incredible. Easily some of the most gorgeous I've seen in a pixel game. The musical score is likewise breathtaking, adding a great sense of foreboding and dread to the already fantastic background art. In that same vein, the voice acting is stellar. As a sucker for Abe Goldfarb going all the way back to the Blackwell Series, it is a treat to the ears to hear him as the main character. Lastly, the overall story is nothing short of excellent (as someone who has had close family members suffer conditions in ways similar to Strangeland's main character's, it struck a uniquely personal tone for me.)

However, where this game comes up short is the gameplay itself. Far too much of the experience in Strangeland feels like a forced narrative, always taking away player freedom in favor of furthering the story. There are no consequences for failure in the game. There are many ways you can die, and every time you do, you simply respawn at the start point with a cheeky message. If you cannot solve a puzzle at first glance, just keep clicking on the phone and it will eventually give you the solution. Challenge is not an issue and this is without a doubt the easiest games from Wadjeteye yet. It's also one of the shortest: compared to Primordia, this entire game could be completed in the time it takes Horatio to reach Metropol. 

Long gone are the in depth cerebral challenges of games like Primordia, Resonance, or Technobabylon. Player choice seems almost completely removed from the experience. In this way, Strangeland succeeds as a narrative, but fails as a game. Gameplay is about player choice and consequence. Here, there simply feels like there is no consequence for your actions. Of course there are slight changes of dialogue if you chose one option over another, and a critic of this review may point out how other games from this publisher have likewise had linear narratives, but this game far more than others seemed to be limited in what it allowes you to do. Your actions do hardly feel like your own. Choice is merely the nouns used in specific dialogue. This makes the world of Strangeland unfortunately shallow. 

Therefore my final thoughts on Strangeland are that it is a beautifully crafted piece of art, reinforced by fantastic sound and acting. But I feel that it lacks meaningful gameplay. It is a quick, one-and-done that I am unlikely to return to in the future. Once completed, I felt no drive to replay the game. Even the accompanying audio commentary--often a favorite extra of mine for these games--did little to engender further interest in the game, as it is mostly a prolonged monologue of obscure literary references used to inspire the game. These references might interest a B.A. in literature, but if you have one of those you probably picked on the references during your first playthrough. 

Final thoughts on Strangeland: 
Pro) This is a great game for digital art lovers and fans of the macabre. 
Con) This is a play novel, not a fully fleshed out adventure game.",1624749567,1624749567,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1624752077,"Fantastic review.  And a fascinating one because essentially all of the criticisms you have of the game* are exactly aligned with the way I've articulated my own views about game design (e.g., ""The Power of Puzzles"" dev diary) -- which is to say, the criticisms would point not merely to a weakness in the game, but also a failure of principle. Given that that the review is extraordinary generous in its praise, the criticisms feel particularly credible, and warrant an answer.

The short answer, of course, is ""Deepest thanks for the kind words and thoughtful assessment, and sorry for the ways we fell short."" But I want to give a long answer in this case because you and I seem so aligned philosophically.

I'd first push back a bit on the choice and consequences point.  I place a high value of C&C (as I wrote in my long review of The Age of Decadence and in the dev diaries about ""Fallen Gods,"" my slow-developing RPG), but it has never been a particular big part of adventure games and is essentially wholly absent from the Lucas Arts catalogue. With adventure games, more important than choice and consequence is maximizing the amount of the game spent actively figuring things out, rather than passive watching or grinding (e.g., through ""puzzles"" that consist of walking back and forth between distant points on a map). Adventure games that emphasize C&C through dialogues at the expense of the traditional puzzle-based gameplay are, IMO, selling the genre's gameplay short, not improving upon it.

While you describe Strangeland as linear, it is actually not very linear until near the end of the game. We spent quite a lot of time designing the puzzles to permit them to be solved in different ways, and in different order. And we made a point of not reducing (relative to Primordia) the number of puzzles that act as ""locked doors,"" so that early on you can move freely through a relatively larger area than in Primordia, one that is continuous rather than broken into contained segments.

Thus, for instance:
[spoiler]To ascend the park in the first ""act,"" you need to do two things: (1) get to the Valkyrie ride and (2) call the coaster car.  One player might get there by letting the dog kill him, getting the rocks, going back to the dog and picking up the spike, getting the ""Beak"" work order, making the spike into a knife, cutting open the rat to get the quarters, talking to Murmur, calling the car, getting the meat from the Scribe, using the knife to jimmy open the shooting gallery drawer, drugging the meat, and bypassing the dog.

Another player might go to the scribe, get the meat, and give the meat to the dog to get it to drop the spike. Use the spike to jimmy open the shooting gallery *controls* (it's not sharp enough for the drawer), slow down the shooting gallery by changing the settings, win the game, get the nepenthe, get another piece of meat, drug the dog, meet the Masquettes, and only then start down the route of making the dagger, getting the coins, etc. [/spoiler]

To me, having that kind of openness, parallel puzzles, and multiple solutions matters more than narrative consequences for you choices -- which are fine (we had them in Primordia) but are ultimately tangential to what I consider to be the core gameplay.

That said, if the puzzle difficulty is too low (as it sounds like it was for you -- though I hope at least the prophecy and starfish gave you a little pause!), then the multipath structure basically becomes invisible, since the lack of any apparent obstacles makes it all just feel like a straight path forward, rather than a variety of winding paths through the park.

I think Strangeland is easier than Primordia, but at least some of that increase in easiness flows from making it quite a bit easier to locate items and hotspots -- we generally wanted the player to be able to size up the situation quickly, and then focus on figuring out a resolution.  Still, it's kind of staggering to hear Strangeland described as the easiest WEG title.  Easier than Unavowed?  Oof!

Anyway, all of this is a roundabout way of saying that the criticisms you raise hit me particularly hard; it's one thing to fail to engage a player because you and the player have different philosophies, but it's much worse that you and the player agree, but you just don't execute well enough.  So it goes!

Well, let me just end with the short version again: grateful for your review, for your kind words, and perhaps most of all for the fact that you are fighting the same battle that I want to be fighting, and fighting it better. :)

(* The one criticism that I think is slightly off is the one about the commentary tracks. The *annotations* are very heavy on literary references, but the commentary tracks are a mix of anecdotes about making the game and, from me and Vic, autobiography about life experiences that led to the game's content. Mine have a few discussions of stories that inspired the game, but I would say that's probably less than a fifth of the commentary tracks.)"

With that said, I keep an open mind when it comes to new games from a creative team that’s already produced a beloved game of mine, and Itry not to have preconceived expectations that a new game will have the same feel to it as a past one. Going in with this view helped me to get the most out of Strangeland, a hypnotic, tense, dark story that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Strangeland has a dark, heavy atmosphere that isn’t just from the landscape and surroundings. The visual stylings are often reminiscent of Primordia, with the scenes of bleak, broken-looking areas interspersed with shining, glinting features and glowing lights; it’s absolutely beautiful to look at and many scenes had me stopping for several minutes just to admire the art. But while Primordia’s post-apocalyptic look and situation were paired with a busy world full of energetic characters to meet and interact with, Strangeland is the story of a lonely wandererer. There is no saracastically chipper buddy to brighten the mood on this journey, and while the mood is very apt for what the main character is going through, I occasionally found myself wishing it wasn’t quite such an isolated journey. 

The other characters we meet along the way are both fascinating and horrifying, some so mesmerizing you can hardly look away and some so deformed that you shudder to imagine being in the same room with them. Whether glorious or hideous, I fully enjoyed the interactions with these strange creatures and wished that atleast one of them had a longer-term presence throughout the game.

Strangeland also feels somewhat shorter than its contemporaries in the genre, but this actually fits the game well. I’m the type of player that wants to hear all the descriptions the character will give me, to the extent of clicking on a chair to see what they’ll say about it. Descriptions can give insight into a character and they often really make the environment come alive for me. Here, there were very few extraneous things to click on, and descriptions were limited to things that were relevant to the plot. 

That wasn’t as much of a downside for me with Strangeland, though, because the main character is already very fleshed out through essential dialogue, and the story has such a well-crafted urgency to it. There is an ongoing tension that is kept up throughout the entire game, and it’s one of the most impressive things about Strangeland that it manages to do this and do it well. The playtime ended up feeling just right for me, and while I did still have the craving to explore the world further, I felt the story concluded at the ideal time.

Overall, I would recommend Strangeland both for its stunning visuals and for its story. It is a dark and cerebral experience, but for anyone who is open to a game with those elements, this is likely to be an intriguing and enjoyable one.",1624534574,1624534574,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1624545458,"This is a really wonderful review to wake up to -- obviously it's always nice to hear kind words about our game, and to hear them so well expressed is all the more so.

Another wonderful game by Wormwood. I thoroughly enjoyed Primordia when I first played it some years ago and was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that Strangeland was released last month! Just like Primordia, I enjoyed this game very much. 

While the game is overall shorter, there are multiple endings (which I still have to discover as I've only done a first playthrough and I intend to play through them all). The puzzles weren't too confusing but not extremely straightforward either so I enjoyed my time solving them.

The story itself was a bit confusing as I was experiencing it and I was left wondering ""What did I just see?"" when the credits rolled. After digging through some Steam discussion posts, the story clicked and I could see the pieces falling into place to put the full picture together. One of the few cons I had with the story/the game itself was it felt a little harder to connect with the characters in a meaningful way; It was a little rough to continue the motivations of the Stranger when I didn't connect with him as much as I did with Horatio in Primordia.

I also didn't understand what the big white bar was at the top of the inventory screen. I have some ideas but for the most part I ignored it while playing.

Overall, I loved this game and cant wait to dive into it again to learn more. Wormwood makes really inspiring games and actually had me wanting to make something similar to their games in the future.

Visuals are interesting but honestly I thought Primordia was more striking in that regard with the mechanical themes benefiting from the retro graphics in a way this more organic based art direction doesn't.

I also thought Horatio was much better characterised than The Stranger, which considering both games are about amnesiacs whose lost memories are pretty much core to the plot.... yeah.

Graphics are not good, it is hard to spot crucial elements. The style You like it or not - You can see most interesting screenshots in game store preview.

Game is short(up to 4hrs top) there are only several interesting and nice levels and several more not interesting corridors/filler backgrounds.

I don't even remember the music.

Atmosphere is even more dark than You see on the screenshots, story is confusing, very metaphory, psychological. In the beginning i was sure it was some kind of purgatory, but then it seems more like fight withing his own head and coping with loss. Just couldn't resonate with it.


For the finish: puzzles. As in a game that is played inside Your head - there are some stretches. There are only few kinds of interesting puzzles, but most of the time You just push forward with obvious choices (use knife to cut sth, etc),  or because inventory and map is so limited You use everything on everything. There are few puzzles that felt totally out of place and illogical even for this world.
So i can't recommend buying this game just for puzzles.

Strangeland was quite a beautiful and emotional game to play. Fully-voiced, it tells a dark story about grief and the process of coping with the death of a loved one.

The player, named the ""Stranger"" in the game, enters a nightmarish carnival where no one can really die. With no memories of who he is or his past, he then witnesses a woman who keeps jumping to her death and feels determined to find and save her.

While exploring this strange land and meeting its very peculiar inhabitants, we learn more about ourself and will try to find answers about the reason we are here.

Visually and plotwise, the game is extremely rich. The writing is excellent and at times very poetic. Full of symbols, metaphors and cultural references, it might take several playthroughs to understand everything. I also recommend playing with commentaries on at least once to get more info about some  details that we might not have noticed on our own. It also tells some very personal stories that inspired the game.

Some players might wonder how similar this game is to the devs previous game. Strangeland is a very different game than Primordia. Different story, different universe, different everything. But as its predecessor, it is another gem that will touch us by its very moving tale. And now I am just curious to discover what the next work of the devs will be about...",1624198410,1624198410,True,5,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,False,,1624204895,Thank you so much for this kind and beautiful review.

For me, it sets it a bit above in the theme and message the writer wants to convey here. The atmosphere of Primordia and this game are different and incomparable, so they are both amazing. This game felt very very personal to me, and I felt certain elements in the game held special meaning to me with some symbols and the way the story goes. I also like the choice of the writer to include the characters in hospital garments, felt like an allusion to the entire mental health care system in America and how it feels like the carnival. The recurring jokes with the clown reminds me of doctors and how they actually talk sometimes. You guys could really do well if you wrote for Futurama, the game has so much meaning in the real world and also makes emotional feeling for the characters. 

One day I hope to be this talented as a writer, and maybe produce something on this level with meaningful messages and especially the social commentary. You guys also did an excellent job with the monomyth aspects and character/situational archetypes. It was so well done, as if I was reading Homer but in the modern iteration. You guys raised so many questions and used the best quotes from mythology and writing with the Fimbul Fambi character and then with Gershom.

The game did feel short, and I would love more, but there was so much included in the small details and the dialogue that I didn't mind the short game. Really felt like the level of writing in Futurama. It wasn't as challenging as Primordia either, but I did not mind becuase the game held personal meaning to me. I absolutely loved it, I can't wait for the next installment in the Wormwood saga. No pressure XD I hope it is something to do in space like human lust for exploration goes too far (I just came up with a cool idea I wanna share with Wormwood), or maybe something like District 9, or a Mayan temple?

I want to respond to one thing in particular: your mention about wanting to write something like it yourself. T.H. White has Merlin say, ""Every word written is a blow against the devil."" (This is apparently taken from a statement found by Jean Victor Duruy in the writings of a medieval abbot who supervised copyist monks in a scriptorium.)

You never know whose life will be changed by it. For instance, your review moved me and brought a joyous end to a tough day.

In short: keep writing, and keep bringing that light into the world."

Graphics wise - it's alright. The backgrounds and setting seem to be inspired by HR Giger and/or Dark Seed. Though the colors are all pretty brown/gray/black and 640x360 seems like a pretty stingy resolution in 2021, even for a point-and-click adventure game.

The game isn't long or hard - my first blind playthrough took around 3.5 hours. The puzzles make sense for the most part. It's a lot easier than Primordia - there's plenty of hints and a built-in helpling (dial 0). I never got stuck at any section for more than a few minutes.

The game provides a built-in hint system for when players get stuck; the fact that the voice on the other end is caustic isn't meant to be the *game* mocking you, but rather the antagonist doing so.

I eagerly snapped it up for a slight discount as soon as it was released.  Overall I did enjoy playing it but felt strangely unsatisfied by the end.

PROS:
-  It looks gorgeous.  The design of Strangeland mixes a creepy, surreal carnival with elements from Norse mythology and uses a careful palette of yellows and purples to create an uneasy atmosphere.  The pixel-art animations are also top-notch.
-  The music / sound design compliments the atmosphere and the voice acting is also high-quality, featuring a few Wadjet Eye regulars.
-  The controls are slick and intuitive, and even the aesthetics of the UI add to the game's atmosphere
-  The vast majority of puzzles are well-implemented and feel like they make sense within the game's surreal setting without being too 'moon logic' for the player to work out.  And if you really get stuck then there's an in-built hint system.

CONS:
-  The main letdown is the writing.  As other reviewers have noted, Strangeland is built around a central, intriguing conceit which becomes apparent at the beginning of the game.  I kept hoping for the story to expand, to flesh out the characters or to give more detailed meaning to its metaphors, but it never did.  It ends up telling a rather generalised story about grief and guilt which never quite moved me because the characters still felt like ciphers rather than real people.  It might have been the designers' intentions to keep things vague / metaphorical so that the player can project their own experiences, but the very nature of the game's setting doesn't mesh well with that approach.
-  One or two frustrating puzzles (one in particular which I wouldn't have guessed without the in-built hint system; even when I retroactively realised the clues they'd laid out for me, I still felt a little cheated)

You keep hoping they're going to throw in a twist or expand upon this already done to death idea, but, nope. 

Puzzles: Puzzles were about on par with their first game. A couple of more difficult ones that you need to pay close attention to get, and a lot of fun not to hard, not to easy, ones to fill out the game. 

Art: Although I didn't enjoy the setting as much this time around, the art was well done and interesting to look at. 

Length: I finished this in about half the time I spent in Primordia, yet paid an extra 5 bucks to play it.

Check out, pay attention to, maybe get it if you’re in the mood, sure. But not drop everything and get it. With Strangeland I was hoping to have a more definite “heck yeah, get it” recommendation. Yet, while I did have a more enjoyable experience with the title overall, and did really like it, I still didn’t like it quite enough.

Strangeland is a 2D point and click adventure game made on Adventure Game Studio, just like with all the titles Wadjet Eye Games tends to publish and just like the previous Wormwood Studios’ game Primordia. Also just like Primordia, this title is incredibly gorgeous – the visuals and how they animate and transition is unlike anything I’ve seen with these AGS games. The voice acting is terrific, music is great – less outside the game, but phenomenal inside the game, – and the gameplay is stripped down to the most fun basics, with some really nice quality of life features and ideas.

It’s not without flaws, one of the very early puzzles was absolutely horrible in concept and execution and I bet if the game ever gets localized, the localization teams will woe the day they decided to take this task. Yet it was also probably the only spot in the game that felt rough, the rest of the game following surreal, yet understandable logic. A few moments here and there felt a bit “eh, this actually makes sense as a solution, but it doesn’t work”. And there were a few moments where you could fail (there’s no Game Over in this game) and get punished by waiting through animations and walking until you can try again. But otherwise, the experience of playing Strangeland was really tight and considerably better paced than Primordia.

Where the game will or won’t click with you, though, is with its story, the themes and how those are handled. Without going into spoilers, this game has the main character go through dark psychological issues and a lot of imagery, text and scenes borders on feeling E D G Y just for the sake of it. It’s always a problem with any type of storytelling dealing with depression or related issues, be it a song, a story, a game or whatever else, where unless it clicks with you on a more than “I get what it’s about” level, you can almost get giggly about how silly it seems. Now, Strangeland in particular, in my opinion, balanced on that line really well, unlike something far more “edgy” like The Cat Lady, or something disgustingly style and drama over substance like Distraint. This game feels sincere in what it’s going for (not that the other titles mentioned weren’t, but they don’t come across as sincere in comparison). But despite that, you might not really care about what it’s going for, for the characters, for the allegories, for the story. Which isn’t helped by the fact, that there isn’t really that much of a journey through the darkness happening, rather a “weird stroll through a, well, Strange Land”.

So, I would definitely suggest being aware of Strangeland and consider getting it when you’re in the mood to play this kind of title. Because if you’re not in the mood, it might completely ruin your experience. I liked it. Not as much as I hoped I would. Not without thinking about Planescape: Torment a bit more often than I’ve expected. But still, liked it.

Новая, долгожданная игра от студии, подарившей нам Primordia. В отличие от неё, Strangeland несколько короче, но всё ещё демонстрирует высокий уровень внимания к деталям и любви разработчиков к своему творению. Не стоит, однако, ожидать тех же эмоций и впечатлений – в этот раз нам представлена трагедия лишь одного человека в чужом краю, не целого футуристического общества на пороге гибели. Весёлого спутника тоже не завезли. Тем не менее, это приятная адвенчура с полностью озвученными (очень качественно, должен сказать) диалогами, вариативностью в решении загадок и классическим артстайлом студии. Моей единственной жалобой будет именно продолжительность игры – понимаемо, что большая часть ресурсов пошла на создание высококачественного продукта, но лично меня не покидает ощущение, что игре можно было бы добавить ещё один-два слоя. Ставлю игре семь с половиной примордий из десяти.

A brand new, long-awaited game from the studio that gifted us Primordia. Unlike it, Strangeland is somewhat shorter, but still displays a high level of attention to details and developer’s love for their creation. However, this time we are presented with the tragedy of only one man in a strange land, not a whole futuristic society on the verge of destruction, so don’t expect same experience and emotions. No quirky loveable sidekick this time, too. Nevertheless, this is a pleasant point’n’click adventure game with fully voiced dialogues (and VA’s did a great job, i must say), several ways of solving puzzles and the classic Wormwood studios art style. My only complaint is with the length of the game – i understand that the majority of the resources went to creating a high-quality product, but personally I have a feeling that the game could’ve used one or two additional layers. Overall i rate Strangeland seven and a half primordias out of ten.

You’re awaken in a straitjacket in what seems to be abandoned, neon-lit carnival in hell. It’s a great start already, but let’s not stop there – you also realize that you have no idea who are you, why are you there, and who is this mysterious woman that keeps jumping in the well as you helplessly watch her for the umpteenth time. Increasingly bleak atmosphere and the universe full of bizarre creatures and odd, chill-inducing rides makes you think that straitjacket just might be a smaller part of your problems…

The narration of “Strangeland” is as surrealistic as the overall plot. It’s expressed through cryptic writing full of aphorisms, riddle-like statements, allegories, metaphors upon metaphors, and while it’s almost poetic, it also can be quite dense at times. There are references to religious writings, Norse mythology, historical places and many literary works abound to make you ponder and overwhelm a bit.  All the dialogues, including internal, appropriately support dream-like plot and are intelligent and thought-provoking but might not quite be as easily digestible, layered on top of the already odd story. The core of which, by the way, will always be partially dipped in confusion. You’re going… somewhere, saving (or are you?) … someone and talking to … some creatures to move on to another bizarre level of the Strangeland. There’s a thread that makes you keep going forward (and things somewhat coherent), though, so you never entirely lost in the grand scheme of things, but still, be prepared to float in a weird dimension where some things are so strange that there’s no point of trying to make sense of them, but rather marvel at them and experience everything as a part of the dark journey which will be extremely personal, yet open to many interpretations.

Puzzle element is nicely balanced, although a seasoned adventurer might yearn for a bit more challenge from developers of “Primordia”. There are classic inventory and environment manipulations, a few logic-based ones, and some fun (although out of place in some instances) puzzles based on wordplay. All of them combined provide for a smooth uninterrupted flow of the gameplay – not too difficult to stump for long, not too easy to just breeze through already rather short adventure, but just right. A few tasks will be of the same disturbing nature as the surrounding universe, so be prepared to do quite grotesque and unsettling things to move forward.

Grotesque and unsettling are the words that could describe pretty much 90% of “Strangeland”, starting from plot down to actions of the Stranger and visuals. And these visuals are fantastic and dark and horrifying and beautiful, pushing AGS to its very limits and, quite probably, taking it beyond. Despite the game's largely muted colors fitting to a gloomy atmosphere full of despair, bright purples and yellows in neon-lit lights bring an interesting element to awe-inspiring pixel art, and even intense macabre creations have an underlying beauty to them.  Smooth animations and overall dream-like liquidity of the picture make it a homerun for Wormwood Studios in a graphics department.

There’s  quite splendid, high-quality voice-over work present, and every actor did great job with their part. The nature of dialogues (dream-like, highly allegorical base that underlines them), however, might make certain statements from a main hero seem a bit too dramatically mechanical (or maybe mechanically dramatical) as the Stranger traverses this bizarre land, full of peculiar beings, but it is easily offset by phenomenal voice-work behind the character of clown head and all the supporting cast. Soundscape in “Strangeland” is quite minimal, but whatever is there works wonderfully. Slow, ominous electro-synthesized tracks and sounds underline heavy atmosphere yet keep it stylish, just like the lit-up signs strewn around this dark carnival do. It’s a moody, disquieting musical component that can equally disturb or plunge you into a melancholy. More of it would seem like an obvious request, but the nature of the game might actually be complete precisely with this minimal level of the top-notch sound.

“Strangeland” is beautiful, well-made by a talented team point’n’click that nonetheless won’t be for everyone.  Disturbing atmosphere calls for many actions that would be fitting only to that nightmarish world, and the overall darkness of the themes explored (nothing is explicitly stated unless you’ll be playing with commentary and annotations) could be too heavy for some. There’s intelligent writing chock-full of metaphors and allegories that might either prompt research and deep discussions or seem quite burdensome to get through, depending on your preference and even mood. “Strangeland” is a gorgeous work of oppressive art, polished and wholesome, but in this case, such is the world of the game that recommendations are largely secondary to the way you feel reading about it or looking at the screenshots. If you do decide to take up this surrealistic, chilling journey alongside the Stranger – remember, you also have his fate in your hands, and it’s a responsibility even he himself shunned for a long time, so proceed at your own risk.",1623487717,1694539745,True,8,0,0.538461565971374512,1,True,False,False,False,,1623557290,"This is a really beautiful review.

Nearby, a raven (a raven, not a crow!) is perched on a branch. It is said of Odin, he who sacrificed an eye in pursuit of knowledge, that he hang himself on the great tree Yggdrasil - sacrificing ""himself to himself"" - which ordeal granted him the knowledge of runes. Of Writing.
This man, he says how he ""writes to forget"". In Plato's dialogue ""Phaedrus"" there is briefly recounted Egyptian legend in which the god Toth presents the gift of writing to king Thamus. Writing is supposed to enhance men's memory by allowing them to record it. Thamus, however, recognizes the ambiguity of the gift: men's memory and wisdom will decrease for they shall rely on this external crutch, this Supplement, rather than having to remember by themselves. Here we've got the logic of the supplement. Banal example: consider how in Dark Souls you can grind and seek superior equipment rather than, and forgive me for this, ""gitting gud"". The supplement that both extends and weakens, makes dependant on. Ambiguous, like the Greek word ""pharmakon"", a cure and a poison. (Related word: pharmakos. Scapegoat, exile, impure, excised.) 
And the raven? Do we not see them as the feeders on the dead, on the energy of others. They who disperse others. 
To write to forget. To lose oneself in the endless surface-play of signs. Signs, by themselves, leading only to signs. Signified becoming signifier, depth becoming surface. Text pointing to another text. Could one not hide in this endless play, drown therein? (Can one not quote and regurgitate the words of others rather than think oneself?) But what if the story is really very simple, if the Real is so very simple. But one would rather disperse, for the real is painful.

Strangeland is a dark, creepy and interesting place to explore and offered no significant barriers (lots of polish, puzzles aren't too hard, nothing unfair), so it was easy to just keep playing until it was over. Toward the end I was into the game hook, line and sinker.

The story and setting is interesting, the voice acting is great and the puzzles are light to medium in difficulty and there's a built in hint system. I used the hint system 3 times or so (and wish I'd held off longer and not cheated myself).

I finished the game in about 4.5 hours but if I'd had more discipline and held off on the in game hints it would have been at least a couple longer.

The puzzles aren't arbitrary, and are perfectly woven into the story-line it tries to tell. I am not too big into point-and-click, or puzzle aspects of the games, but dying to know more about the what's happening kept me going, which I guess how this genre is supposed to feel.

[h2]Story of Strangeland?[/h2]
Our protagonist spawns at the end of a dead-end road, with a big directional sign 'Strangeland' next to him. Next to the road is nothing... a void. He has no idea who he is, so some people call him 'The Stranger'. He walks down the path, where he encounters a gate, which is also a giant mouth of a clown, who tells him a joke? You know, those gates that can be found in amusement parks or a carnival. The stranger sees no other way than directly into the mouth, with a plethora of signs to convince him that that is indeed the correct way! He walks over the clowns tongue into a room with in the centre a well, and a woman. The Stranger feels he has to save her, but the woman throws herself down the well! A crow tells that the woman keeps on returning, in order to to throw herself in the well, over and over, to save him?? Our Stranger is determined to save the woman, and the rest of this story filled with mindgames and metaphors I'll leave for you to find out! 

[h2]Very player minded [/h2]
The game is very smooth, almost all of time it's clear what needs to be done, and if you're unsure what to do, you can dial 0 on a payphone to receive a hint. Basically a walkthrough inside the game. Your inventory is kept pretty small, so there is not a lot to combine. Everything that can be carried has a function. 
The game has a standard P&C structure: at first you can choose or find several objectives that can be done in any order, and after that the story becomes linear. You never have to travel far, and even then you still have the option to skip the walking animation by clicking two times on the next zone. Pretty neat feature! 

[h2]Audial and visual design [/h2]
The voice acting is wonderful! It's of a very solid quality! It makes it so much easier to follow and enjoy the story! The sound effects are good, and the music is pure atmospherical I think, I can't remember any melody, except a maddening organ tune. Everything fits really well. 
The pixelart is good, but many parts are obscure, which is absolutely fine. The cinematics are not fully animated, but that's not needed either. 

[h2]Involved developers [/h2]
The devs respond alot to discussion topics, but I have also seen them in a stream I always watch that covered the game briefly. And I have played this with a group of players, with them reading our reactions and providing help where requested. 

[h2]Conclusions [/h2]
I love this game, even though I had some problems with acquiring the achievements. Some demand being done in one playthrough for example, while not stated in the achievement, and one requires reflexes of a competitive FPS game. I am certain they will finetune this in the upcoming weeks. 
This game is carefully polished, and knowing that Wormwood Studios consists of only three people, chapeau! 
Some people might find it a bit short with an average playthrough of 5-6 hours, but I personally like that. The price reflects that, I think. You could also criticise that the story is slightly generic. For me this game is an instant classic, especially because of the voice acting!

And I have to say that, since 2017, when I played the first, I have never been disappointed, not for a single instant. All these 4 games are true masterpieces, not less. Every single one of them is a 10/10 for me, and I am not even exaggerating. Primordia is virtually perfect both in visuals and storytelling, Shardlight has a great and unique atmosphere, Unavowed is even better than Primordia, it is full of characters so well characterized that they almost seem alive, and finally... Strangeland is the Gigerian nightmare I was anxiously looking for. The visuals of this game are so beautiful, creepy, alien, dark, gothic, surreal and nightmarish that, while playing, I had the sensation to be looking at one of H. R. Giger's artbooks. The ambience STRONGLY resembles the alien wrecked ship you can see in the first ""Alien"" movie, and also the gloomy atmosphere is VERY similar, to the point that you almost expect to suddenly see a xenomorph jump at you from nowhere! But of course the plot is fully original, and very clever in my opinion. It is somewhat different from the usual stories from these devs, which are usually very intricate and based on carismatic characters whom you slowly learn to love as they were alive. In this game, both the plot and the characters are cryptic and mysteryous to say the least. You won't understand a thing until you finish the game, no kidding. But when you reach the end... oh, the blast! The blast! You fully understand the real purpose of all that mystery. And your mind blows! I'll say no more, I'd ruin your experience. Let's just say that this game is... a true nightmare. Literally. In a nightmare, you feel helpless, even hopeless sometimes, in the worst cases you feel scared, but in general you simply don't understand where you are and what you are supposed to do. And everything looks threatening and horrific to you. That's why you start feeling panick and sweating in real life! This game is all that. And much more. And the puzzles? This game is a classic point and click adventure (right from the 90's!), so it is obviously full of puzzles. Like in the other games from Wadjet Eye, they are a bit difficult, but nothing exaggerated. I'd say they are intelligently balanced. AND, if you find yourself stuck (as I did many many times!), don't worry at all: there's a hint system which literally tells you what to do if you insist questioning it for a while. So you don't even need a guide, you can fully and freely enjoy the plot and the art of the game without pausing every minute to go look for a solution on Steam or the internet. And some of the puzzles are really really clever, I was truly impressed in some occasions. To summarize, let's say that I liked this game as much as Primordia and Unavowed, unforgettable masterpieces of modern graphic adventures. That's the best thing about these games. You'll never forget them. They will always be in your heart for the time to come, either for their astonishing artwork, or for their incredibly human characters (even if they're actually robots, like in Primordia!). So, well... do yourself a precious gift: play these four games I told you about. Play them, and get ready to feel something unique you will always remember with great affection. Thank you Wadjet Eye, I mean it.

But most important of all, I really wish the game actually told you an intriguing, fleshed-out story with characters you learned to love and care about – instead, it tosses you the cliff notes edition of their tragedy before abruptly rolling the credits.

While I only spent 3 hours or so I did beat the game but I tend to read far ahead of the voice acting and I rarely hit any roadblocks which I often do in this genre.

The subject matter was definitely on the heavy side and hit me on a personal level for multiple reasons which I won't dig into because this is a Steam review, not a dissertation on my personal life, and also because divulging any details could absolutely spoil the story.

If I didn't burn through the game at an rapid pace I'd say this game is a solid 5 hours, and for the $15 price point I'd say that's more than reasonable. I know there are multiple paths you can take to explore more of the game as well which could extend that playtime a bit if that's your concern. It's not for me, however, since I approach games like this like I would a good book; if it's a solid read, I don't really care how many pages it has.

For those of you that might have reservations about playing this because it suggests it's a horror game; it's really not. There are no jump scares -- audio or visual -- and any of the grotesque creepiness is less about monsters or HP Lovecraft and more about the tragedy of the human condition/mortality. Other than a few moments of ""damn, gross"" you're not going to be frightened.

Now that I've got all of that out of the way, the art direction, sound design, writing, and intuitiveness (I'll elaborate in a moment) are excellent. My critiques were few and far between but in order to give this a fair analysis I'll include them (really, your team did a fantastic job). The first minor issue I had was with the level of obscurity in the writing, then a ""boss fight"" that was so on the nose it was hard to take seriously. It was a strange contrast; from abstract storytelling to a symbolic sledgehammer in minutes (edit: this statement was a little too harsh so I toned it down a bit).

Lastly, regardless of what the How to Play might suggest, definitely write things down if they seem important; it skipped some steps in a process of elimination puzzle and kept things a lot easier to track in other places. If you want to revisit the same dialogue multiple times in different areas because you refused to write it down, that's all you. You also will have at least one moment where you just start randomly combining things in your inventory (despite the How to Play suggestion that you shouldn't) because there are easily 2 combinations that I would have never intuitively figured out. But this is subjective; your results may vary!

As far as intuitiveness, across the board I rarely got stuck outside of the random combo moments, and I had a pretty clear direction where to go even if I had a few minutes of hesitation. For me that's kind of a big deal because I started point and clicks in the old school days of King's Quest where you'd combine the Owl Scrotum with the Purple Feather to make a concoction for the Alchemist but only at night or some such ridiculous bullshit that always infuriated me. This game did not go the obscure approach and kept it almost exclusively logical while still providing some rewarding ""ah-ha"" moments.

If you're looking for a good modern adventure game with a very dark theme; seriously it's pretty dark and not in a spooky way, this is a great game to pick up. In fact, I'll probably double down and pick up their earlier release, Primordia because I was so impressed with this one.",1623062997,1623129907,True,4,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1623114443,"So glad it had that personal meaning for you.

Review written after completing game.

[b] This is a Point and Click game - done right![/b]
[hr]										[/hr]
[list]
[*] Beautiful graphics
[*] Complimentary music that sets the scenes tone and atmosphere
[*] Story, story, story. There is a lot of it here. My emotions ran the gamut whilst playing this.
[*] Mechanics. No wheels were reinvented
[*] Manual and an autosave spot! You have unlimited saves.

Step into a surreal carnival and test your emotional mettle. Oh, and get ready to die, a lot. That is intended. 

The devs game summary on the sales page is accurate so I will not reiterate here.

The writing is superb. It would be easy to blast through the game, do take some time to enjoy and decipher the writing.

Voice overs include the always fabulous Abe Goldfarb and Ivy Dupler.

No walk-through needed! Puzzles are fair to the player and spaced well; if you missed a clue, you can always call your friendly telephone operator for a nudge in the right direction.

There are a lot of life’s truths in this game; I quite enjoyed it but cringed a few times :-), crying at the end. Crying at the credits of all things :)-))

I play a lot of games. Few make me feel satisfied; this game did.

Although the game is definitely not for me, mostly because of the ideas it carries, I must say that, as far as I can tell, it took a step forward from a game design perspective. The subjective shortcomings I noticed are perfectly described in other reviews and I will not expand on them much:
[list]
[*] The convoluted presentation does not help the narrative, in my humble opinion.
[*] The character is somehow disconnected from the apparent surroundings: for a person living a nightmare he is being too distant and underreacting a lot.
[*] The character's behavior occasionally looks inadequate. Almost all adventure characters I like (April Ryan, Victoria McPherson, Azriel Odin, to name a few) are or, I would say, have to be a little cynical and humorous to naturally blurt out, ""No way I want to burn this,"" when trying to use a gas-burner on a random TV. Unfortunately, these kinds of remarks feel stilted in ""Strangeland"".
[/list]
What really ruined the experience for me, is the focus on the concept of loss and finding a way of living through with it. The developer got a bit cheesy in the in-game comments, and I would allow myself to do the same. I personally perceive loss in all its glorious irreversibility as a great monument to life's naturalness, absurdity, and also humans' transience, which does not help with understanding the character who is struggling against it for almost all of the story. This, in turn, brings me to the main pain point — the endings. Spoilers ahead. [spoiler]In the end you have an option to escape (to jump), to escape efficiently (to kill yourself), to escape inefficiently (to try fighting), and to escape by evolving (to use wings).[/spoiler]
Where is the option to do literally nothing? The authors that influenced my current self the most are Kafka, Camus, Kawabata, and, maybe, Bates, so it comes as no surprise that I ask again, ""Where is the option to do absolutely nothing? (Because the boundary between depression and melancholy is an ephemeral one, there is no significant difference between dying on your knees or fighting, because there is no significant difference among the absurdities of life in the first place.)
Do not mind me though, ""Strangeland"" is a great game overall.",1622918479,1622990588,False,8,2,0.550850033760070801,13,True,False,False,False,,1622940906,"Ha! You know you're in for something special when a negative review concludes with ""'Strangeland' is a great game overall."" What you wrote is nuanced and erudite, and it's too bad that the great algorithm in the sky will simply reduce this to a downvote on the game. Such is life in the zone.

It's always interesting to find oneself the Bizarro to a Superman, and that is what strikes me most about this review. Obviously we have a shared fondness for adventures (like me, you comfortably rattle off adventure game protagonists -- but the ones you list are all among my least favorite!), similar literary tastes (Kafka in particular), and a similar interest in the thematic content of games. Yet I see the world in the opposite terms that you do. As you know from the commentary, to me the line between melancholy and depression (at least as I think we're both using those terms) is fundamental. I refuse to believe that the proper reaction to the world's outrages and absurdities is to give in; this is not to say I've never given in, only that I don't view life as one in which there are ""no significant differences"" in whether one acts with love, dignity, restraint, compassion, etc. or not.

However, I do think you have misperceived the endings -- which is to say, I did not convey the ending options clearly enough, since the fault is always with the designer and not the player.

[spoiler]Jumping back into the park is absolutely not escape. It is surrender to inertia. Hence the clown's joke at the end indicating that you're exactly back where you started, unchanged. Of course jumping is not ""doing nothing""; I suppose a player who truly wants to ""do nothing"" can just quit the game or leave it running without interacting with it. But from a gameplay standpoint, you need to offer an action to represent even inaction. The two knife options also strike me as categorically different. One is reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how to overcome your problem, but it is an effort to overcome it. The other is just an effort to end it all.[/spoiler]

Anyway, there is no doubt you gave the game every opportunity to make you like it, and it failed (which is to say, I failed, since the code, art, music have nothing to do with your dislike). I still find myself rolling around the contrast of the review's ending, but let me end this comment unambiguously: your review is great, and I liked it. I'm glad there are gamers like you. Some day Bizarro and Superman may come to grips, but today I'd rather just grab a coffee and trade thoughts."

Strangeland is a trippy, creepy, and chuckle worthy point and click adventure game that has some neat abstract and surreal elements to keep it interesting. Although at times it seems to either get lost in itself (or I'm just too dumb to get it) but it's still a good experience and scratches the itch for point and click nostalgia. 

Pros: 
- The art style is creepy and really cool. It kind of gives the whole atmosphere a very surreal feeling that just has you tilting your head going ""whaaa?"" 
- The puzzles are decently balanced. There weren't too many times I thought ""ooookay how was I supposed to know/think that?"" 
- Voice acting is pretty solid. I think there might be a couple of audio clipping issues here and there, but ultimately it's not bad. Initially the main character's intonation felt weird, but I realized it's because the character was reading a sign and not just speaking. Pretty neat! 

Cons - 
- Level design. While the art is amazing, I find the world to be a bit cramped. There's only a small handful of screens and it adopts almost this looping hallway mechanic which I'm beyond tired of. It's not really bad here, but it feels a bit claustrophobic. 
- Story. As I said, it could be me being too dumb to get it, BUT there's sections of the beginning that feel....pretentious? Like my eyes just glazed over as I'm hearing some characters drone on and it's all just noise to me at a certain point. But (no spoilers) the end comes around and it REALLY hammers on a very simple story ending. It's almost like the game knew I wasn't getting it and then it attacked me with a ""This story for dummies"" manual. Fair enough I suppose. 

TLDR; Great art design, atmosphere, voice acting. Story/dialogue in the beginning seems a bit convoluted and then real dumbed down by the end and it could do with a bit more variety in the world. Not my favorite point and click, but definitely better than some others out there.",1622861368,1622861368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1622865308,"Thanks for the balanced, thorough review.

Genius!), soooo many references that I had no idea about, parallelisms, homophones, contrasts - is just a delight to absorb. Like having a good time hearing a friend who's so passionate about a theme that wakes my curiosity up, makes me appreciate the game way more. And of course, all these intimate comments of melancholic feelings and thoughts, that makes me feel lucky to be a confidant of. It requires a lot of bravery, I'm not sure I would be able to do it. I guess I'm one of these ppl who don't have a sibilant super-ego whispering to my ear, so it's totally insightful to see through the *eyes* of others. And in this case, it just enriches the whole experience of playing a great game. 

So many thanks for this game!

You my friends are absolute genious and i much enjoyed this game as did i also enjoy all of your previous released games. primordia was the first game i played and since then i have played thru almost all other games you have produced and i truly loved them all.

I love the underlying sometimes almost poetic narration , depth and wonderful artstyle in this particular game. The surreal surroundings and quite intuitive controls and logical proggresion rate is spot on and fenomenaly executed. I have played a LOT of games in this genre and i must say that you absolutely nailed everything about it with the music, gameplay, character creation and i could go on and on. but suffice to say in my book this game is a pure masterpieces.

if someone reads this i can gladly recommend anyone who like point and cklick adventure games to buy this game and i can promise that you will like it.

Keep doing what you do best and the sky is the limit for all of you and the exellent games you make. 

The only drawback i feel now after completing the game is that its over but i liked every moment.

i very much look forward to your next games with excitemnet and for me  this is a 20 out of 10.

My review will be more of a post-play discussion so if you want an absolutely no spoiler review then I will say buy this game if you liked Primordia but be prepared for a very different type of story and I think this game is kind of dark. So if you play games for happiness you may not wish to play this game.

Also in the commentary I believe I heard several times they refer to it as a horror game, but I would disagree. Depends how you interpret that word horror, but for me, if I am not afraid, it wasn't really a horror game. This game has dark themes but I wouldn't consider it horrifying or scary. Games like Alien Isolation, Dead Space - those are what I class as horror games. So if you're worried you'll be too scared to play it - don't be worried and buy!

[spoiler]By ""these sorts of stories"" I mean allegorical stories where there is no real story, it's ""all in your head"". Double-fake as the lead writer puts it in the dev commentary. Speaking of the commentary, I found I understood the allegories a lot more from the commentary than from the game itself. Maybe that's because I'm an uncultured swine though. And culture is another important point - unless you are well-read in multiple forms of classic literature ranging from T.S. Eliot to the Holy Bible and Norse mythology (aka ""stuff that was written long before you were born"" most of the allegories will fly write over your head like they did mine, until explained in the dev commentary.

In terms of puzzles I definitely enjoyed the ""logic box"" approach and the only time I ever got stuck and called the phone line for a hint was because I didn't actually realise there was a hole in the tent that could be peeked through to get the dead rat and the coins. The puzzle that I think gave me the most satisfaction to solve was probably the 1 wanton 1 puzzle. 

My fav room was the one with the mecha-mermaid and the telepathic starfish, which also made me long for a literal storyline where we explore some creepy ocean-realm inhabited by such creatures. Alas, it's allegory all the way down in this tale.

The mirror finale section I know was said in the commentary that it was worked on last, and underwent several revisions until it felt right. I'm of the opinion it still doesn't feel right. I think this is mainly because of what was said in another commentary though, because the logic box concept was ditched for the final section and a more linear approach used.

I was surprised to learn AGS has so many flaws and the programmer had to implement so many strategies to work around them, causing people to express amazement that it is even on the AGS engine - which must be very satisfying to hear. I'm surprised with this very old-style games that things such as lag and memory are still an issue! It makes me wonder if there are other engines out there that could be considered for future projects to take the next adventure game to even new heights of modern tech in the retro style? (But please never abandon the 2D pixelart! I was quite dismayed to hear that Technobabylon 2 was opting to ditch it for 3D - it just doesn't stoke the same fires of nostalgia!)

Speaking of art and music, I can't say much because I all I know is how little I know in these fields. The distinct artstyle from Primordia is very apparent to my untrained eye, however, and I look forward to seeing more of it in future projects. It was interesting to hear in the commentary how the music is made, but no track made any particular imprint into my brain. But neither did any music stand out to me as being out of place. And maybe that is the best type of music a game like this needs? Working unnoticed behind the scenes of your mind to put you into the same mental state as the Stranger.

The Stranger, you poor soul. I myself have experienced grief very rarely and in circumstances where grief is perhaps not even the right word. Should one grieve for the loss of their grandmother after she had lived a full life and died in her sleep? Is that not the best ending we all should hope for? Yet despite the inevitability of death, all but the machine-men among us are affected by it in an upsetting way. And as we all shuffle down the mortal coil, we are assaulted with its inevitability again and again until at last our own turn comes.

And in those twilight years you are asking yourself absurd questions, like is it better to be the first one to die, so you don't have to witness the death of your loved ones one by one? Or is it better to be the last, and thus spare them from that pain, taking the burden on yourself? Fortunately for most of us, we do not have to make that choice. Death comes when it comes. Though as euthanasia becomes more commonplace among 1st world countries, perhaps we will have to face that tough choice after all.

Yet what has happened to the Stranger, and to many of those less fortunate than us, such as the coach in the commentary, is death or disease comes far earlier than feels fair. Suddenly, that dreadful thing we knew we'd have to deal with SOMEday becomes TOday. This is when grief can evolve into depression as you rage against a world that has already taken so much is taking even more, and far sooner than was promised. This is the fate of the Stranger, dealing with his wife's death from cancer after unsuccessful attempts at treatment (at which I heard the late Christopher Hitchens once say - the cure is worse than the disease).

To deal with this tragedy, the Stranger goes into some elaborate carnival mind-palace like Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes, going deeper and deeper into his mind like Christopher Nolan's Inception, but does this ever actually happen in real life? I think that's why I find these sort of ""it was all in his head"" stories unappealing, because has any human in the history of forever ACTUALLY done this? Yes, artists have been inspired by tragedy to create some incredible things, but are homo sapiens actually capable of creating mind palaces this intricate to shield themselves from harsh truths of reality? I think it's just something that exists in fiction, and not something humans can actually do. But I'd be interested to read research that says otherwise!

As for the endings, I will say what I wish there was was one more ending. Because let's break the endings down here. We've got basically one good 'canon' ending and a bunch of bad endings. We have fly away and escape your mind palace and embrace the harsh reality of your wife's death (good ending) (as an aside, i wish we'd gotten just ONE more scene of him waking up at the hospital or something, just so we could have got one tiny glimpse at the REAL world of Strangeland). We have stab yourself with a knife (what exactly is going on here, does this mean I'm willing my heart to stop beating in actuality or something?) We have jump off the cliff and return to Strangeland (presumably the worst of the endings, as this is the only one where your spouse objects to you doing so), where you presumably will just be stuck in the endless loop of being stuck in your mind palace. And then we have attack the Dark Thing in a doomed attempt to kill him, but he just kills you (again, like with the stabbing of the knife, I'm not sure what this means literally to the Stranger's physical body and allegorically what it means, that you were defeated by your depression? Isn't that kind of like the stab-yourself ending?)

Now break these endings down what have you really got? (1) good ending (2) suicide by knife (3) suicide by falling, (4) suicide by doomed charge at your foe. So really it's just 2 endings, one of which has 3 flavours of suicide. I would have one more ending, just for a bit more variety...[/spoiler]

I'm grateful for it, and for the time you spent in Strangeland, despite your aversion to allegorical / inward-looking stories. A few spoiler reactions!

[spoiler]The ending you mention was actually one that I contemplated, but ultimately I decided that it didn't really make any sense. Perhaps an interaction where you try to bargain with the DT to take the orb in exchange for leaving you alone; but that bargain doesn't work. You can hand over your last hope to despair and expect the despair to go away as a result!

Regarding whether anyone ever actually inhabits a space like this, I would say: (1) to some extent in dreams but (2) generally, no. But the only way to merge adventure gameplay with introspection is to externalize the internal -- otherwise, you just end up with a lot of dialogues, cutscenes, etc. in which your character explains his self-doubts, griefs, traumas, etc. You then wind up with a disconnect between the ostensibly inward-looking narrative and the gameplay. None of the ""verbs"" by which you play the game would relate to the ""action"" of the internal narrative. So, this seemed like a solution to bridge the gameplay and narrative. It seems to have worked for some, not for others.

But, ultimately, I was driven by two imperatives: I needed to tell a story about these themes, and I am committed to adventure games in which the gameplay drives the narrative, rather than being detached from it. So even knowing that it would be a hit-or-miss product, it's the one I had to make. :P[/spoiler]"

The main thing that made me buy it was the developer's previous title, Primordia, which I have very much enjoyed and recommended thoroughly. It is not an easy sell this time, but I still think there's enough to like to tilt my vote towards ""recommend"".

[h1]Gameplay and performance[/h1]

The gameplay hasn't changed much. It's still a very standard point-and-click adventure puzzle game. It's not especially difficult, but unlike Primordia the world sometimes works on crazy logic, so don't expect it to be straightforward all the time. This is justified narratively of course, but still don't be afraid to use the game's nice narrative hint system if you need it. Whatever engine the devs are using must have gotten an update since Primordia because it works much better with modern resolutions now and doesn't panic when you dare to minimize the window. The only issue I encountered was that once the game refused to close. So overall: runs well, plays well.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

This is easily the game's strongest point. The artist(s) did a fantastic job adapting their already striking style to the nightmarish imagery of the world. The art is full of detail, meaning, and character. This only gets more intense in the second part of the game where they pull out all the stops and embrace the amped up insanity of their setting. The sound manages to not disappoint either. Strangeland has some fantastic music that fits the tone of the game. This time around the standout track was The Yew. It's a shame it's so short. I'd love to hear an extended version. I will criticise some of the voice acting. There are absolutely great performances like Eight-Three, but some were lacking, like [spoiler]the Woman[/spoiler]. (As a side note, I don't necessarily blame the actors here. There is a lot that goes into how their voice comes out in the context of the game. It could be any number of things.) Most fall somewhere in the middle with more on the good side than bad.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Well, this is going to be difficult to do without spoilers, but it's also where most of my issues with the game are. Strangeland doesn't have a bad story, but it doesn't have a great one either. Where Primordia took inspiration from classical sci-fi, Strangeland seems (at least to this uninformed observer) inspired by psychological horror. Unfortunately, this makes it fall into some traps of the genre. Because so much of the world is surreal, it's hard to get attached to anyone or anything. Character development or growth is not really present. Half the characters are walking metaphors and the other half spout the same riddles over and over. The answers you will likely figure out far before the protagonist does. It all does tie together into a simple yet emotional story with a powerful message in the end. There is still enough there for a good plot. It's just that it's built on a bare-bones foundation.

On a technical level, I can praise the clever use of metaphors, especially when they are supported by the art. The use of different mythologies was also intriguing, and I have to give props to the effectiveness of the occasional dose of twisted dark humour. However, I can't ignore just how wordy the game can get at times. There are several points where the characters just keep repeating the same thing over and over again in different elaborate ways, as if the writer couldn't choose between four different metaphors and decided to write them all out in a row. Also, the irony of saying this in such a long-winded review that most people will probably never fully read it doesn't escape me, but that's just because I'm bad at this. Still, I will do a full-spoiler addedndum at the end that goes more in depth on my feelings about specifics of the plot and how they shaped the experience.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Strangeland is a good game, if you like what you see on the tin. It will supply a good amount of excellently-crafted horror art, which may be its main sell. It's competent at being a point-and-click puzzle game. And the story follows the themes you'd expect here. The writing has issues in terms of characterization and a lack of brevity, but the plot still holds together and delivers a satisfying conclusion. In my opinion it doesn't live up to the legacy of Primordia, but it doesn't have to. Probably worth the asking price, but if you're not sure about how much you would enjoy a psychological horror point-and-click in a nightmarish world, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for a sale.

[h1]SPOILER CRITIQUE[/h1]

[spoiler]This is mainly for the devloper and anyone else who—for some reason—wants to hear my take on the story. So the issue I danced around in my Story section is that everything that's going on is in the protagonist's head. This isn't a bad trope by itself, but it creates some challenges that Strangeland, in my opinion, failed to overcome. The main one being: you essentially have one character, two if you count the Woman. And when you fail to develop that one character, and write off your setting as just the protagonist's head, you are left with nothing but the motions of the plot. The problem is we learn very little about the Stranger beyond his self-loathing and his love for the Woman. We don't even get to see how their love came to be or what it was that held them together. There are plenty of metaphors but like the clever giant Cancer Crab, most of them are striking metaphors of events, not insights into who these people are.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]The game reminds me of Jacob's Ladder and Silent Hill 2, but with all the side characters taken out and with way less insight into the main character's past. I wanted to be intrigued by this world. I enjoyed talking to Nineveh and Eight-Three. I loved untangling the convoluted ball of Norse symbolism. I liked applying my (limited) knowledge of tarot to answer Murmur's questions in the way I thought fit best. I don't want this critique to sound like I'm ripping the game's story to shreds. It's just that once you see the main message, once you realize that every single character and every single conversation without exception is tied into death and loss, those characters that intrigued you become hollow shells that you feel silly for expecting more from. They're not just made up, which would have been fine. They're all reduced to a single metaphor. This story had strong emotion. It had a personal message. It had a beautiful depiction of internal struggle. The problem is that it had essentially nothing else.[/spoiler]",1622756721,1622757929,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,1622759138,"This is a thoughtful take on the game, and I very much appreciate you having played and spoken kindly of both our games. 

In terms of the spoiler text, I suppose I would say that the intention is actually to address two related themes:
[spoiler]An underlying lifelong despair and sense of inadequacy, which was held back to some degree by the light that love brought to the widower's life--and then the consequences of losing that light, and having the darkness come crashing back (with amplification) after the widower was unable to find a way to stop the cancer that killed his wife. Some of the symbols (like masks, mirrors, blindness, flying, etc.), are really more directed toward the former theme, while others (like crabs, poison, the woman falling into the well) are more directed at the latter. I'm not sure this changes your critique, but I figured I'd share it.[/spoiler]

Bir kere senaryosu cidden çok iyiydi, hikayeyi anlatım biçimi harikaydı, göndermeleri dört dörtlüktü, karakterleri oyuncuda yer ediyordu. Üstelik tam 7 farklı sonu vardı ve bu sonların hiçbirisi de öyle laf olsun diye hazırlanmış sonlar değildi.

Hal böyle olunca da Wormwood'un yeni oyunu Strangeland'i duyduğum andan beri büyük bir beklenti içine girmiştim. Paylaşılan ilk ekran görüntüleri ve hikaye detaylarından bizi oldukça tuhaf bir oyunun beklediği belliydi. Strangeland oldukça karanlık ve tuhaf bir hikaye anlatacaktı ki sırf bu bile oyunu sevmem için yeterli bir sebepti aslında. 

Son zamanlarda bir çok kaliteli adventure oyunu çıkıyor ama sürüden farklı temalara değinen oyun sayısı bir elin parmağını geçmez. Gönül istiyor ki Dark Seed gibi, Sanitarium gibi, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream gibi uç hikayeler anlatan daha fazla oyun görelim. Strangeland'e başlayıp da kendimi deli ceketi giymiş halde o ışıklı Strangeland tabelasının önünde görür görmez ""aha"" dedim, ""işte o oyun, bu oyun"".

Strangeland bir karnaval dünyası, ama çarpık bir karnaval dünyası diyelim. Bu dünyada sirk çadırının girişini oluşturan dev palyaço kafası size karanlık espriler yapıyor, kuzgunlar konuşuyor, kör bir adam duyduğu kelimeleri kağıtlara karalıyor, telefonda sizin başka bir versiyonunuz size bolca kızıyor... Ve bir kadın çadırın ortasındaki kuyudan aşağı atıyor kendini. Hem de defalarca. Ve biz o kadını durduramıyoruz. Oyunun hikayesi de zaten buradan çıkıyor. O kadın kim, biz kimiz, ölmesini nasıl engelleyebiliriz? 

Strangeland baştan sona kadar metaforlar ve grotesk görüntülerle dolu bir oyun. Spoiler olabilecek hiçbir şey söylemeyeceğim, ama oyundaki neredeyse karşılaştığınız her karakter, her tuhaf yaratık aslında hayatınızdan bir parçayı temsil ediyor. Belki delirmiş, kafayı sıyırmış birinin beyninin içindeyizdir, kim bilir? Bu oyunda hata yapmak diye bir şey yok, ama ölmek var. Hani eski Sierra adventure oyunlarında hiç beklenmedik anda ölürdük ve oyuna sona ererdi ya (hey gidi günler), Strangeland'de ise ölmek bazen ilerlemek anlamına geliyor. Her öldüğümüzde kendimizi o ilk tabelanın altında buluyor ve bazen de bu sayede bulmacanın bir parçasını kafamızda çözmüş oluyoruz.

Tüm bu karanlık tema, oldukça başarılı bir grafik tarzıyla, buram buram H.R.Giger kokan görsellerle sunuluyor bize. Bu dünyada organik ile inorganik, canlılarla makineler, ölüler ve yaşayanlar, hayvanlar ve yaratıklar iç içe geçmiş durumda. Yakın çekim karakter görselleri de son derece detaylı ve animasyonlu. Buraya kadar her şey dört dörtlük.

Ancak oyun işin 'oynanış' kısmına geldiğinde Primordia'daki başarıyı sergileyemiyor bence. Bir kere kullanılan renk paletinden dolayı işimize yarayacak bazı eşyaları tespit etmek biraz zorlaşmış. Buna örnek olarak bir metal çubuğu ve bir cam parçasını verebilirim. Oyunda benzeri diğer oyunlardaki gibi bir ""hotspot"" tuşu yok, yani eski usül 'piksel avı' yapmanız gerekiyor çok takıldığınız durumlarda. 

Bu kadar orijinal bir tarzı ve hikayesi olan bir oyunun bulmaca konusunda sınıfta kalmış olmasıysa üzücü. Yani hala daha ""iple kancayı birleştir, al sana tutma kancası"" bulmacasının bir zorluğu olduğunu mu düşünüyor yapımcılar? Kapının altına kağıt koyup anahtarı üzerine düşürme bulmacası yok neyse ki. Gönül isterdi ki bulmacaları daha fazla ve daha zor olsun, ama baştan sona kadar takıldığım tek bir nokta bile olmadı. Mekaniksel bulmacalar ise (mesela bir ışığa basınca etrafındakiler söner, hepsini yakmaya çalışırsınız) atmosfere pek de uygun düşmemiş. Daha orijinal bir şeyler beklerdim. Takıldığınız bir yer olduğu takdirde de telefondan 0 numarasını çeviriyor ve o an sıradaki yapmanız gereken şeye dair ipucu alıyorsunuz. Yani oyun aslında sizin pek de bir yere takılıp zaman kaybetmenizi istemiyor, derdi hikayesini anlatmak.

Hikaye demişken... Strangeland ölümle, intiharla, yasla, kendine zarar vermekle, suçluluk duygusuyla ve benzer temalarla dolu. Zaten oyunun Steam sayfasında da bu uyarı yapılmış. Yeri geliyor bir bıçağı kendinize saplıyor, yeri geliyor kendinizi boşluğa bırakıveriyorsunuz. Yani bu tür temalardan etkilenen biriyseniz bunun pek de size göre bir oyun olmadığını söyleyebilirim.

Oyunun başında kafanızda kurduğunuz hikaye ile sonlara doğru kavradığınız hikaye birbirinden farklı olacak. Bu da oyunun anlatımdaki başarılarından biri aslında. Ancak oyunun süresinin kısa oluşu (yaklaşık 4 saat), bu farklı adventure oyunu deneyiminin tadının damakta kalmasına neden oluyor.

Aynı Primordia'da olduğu gibi Strangeland'de de birden fazla son var. Bunların üçü için kötü demek mümkün, ama tüm sonları görmek için oyunu baştan oynamanızı gerektirmiyor oyun. Tüm sonlar, oyunun finalinde vereceğiniz kararla belirleniyor ve bu sayede de önceki kaydınızı yükleyip tümünü görebiliyorsunuz. Bu farklı son olayının Primordia'nın bir adım gerisinde kaldığını söylemem lazım.

Eksiklerine veya 'daha iyi olabilecek' kısımlarına rağmen Strangeland kesinlikle oynanması gereken bir adventure oyunu bence. Özellikle de farklı türde, rahatsız edici içeriğe sahip, karanlık bir macera oyunu arıyorsanız Strangeland çok doğru bir seçim. Hele bu fiyata, Wormwood Studios gibi hevesli ve yaratıcı bir ekibe destek olmamak ayıp olur. Umuyorum ki Wormwood bir sonraki oyununda bundan da edindiği deneyimlerin üstüne koyacak ve Primordia'yı da geçecek bir oyunla karşımıza çıkacak.

One of the wonderful things I remember is being huddled around the family computer that took a week to boot, with my 2 sisters playing many amazing point-and-click adventure games.

Throughout the game I had to pause and simply admire the world and environment, as I was taken back with the fantastic art style with the little modern twists of newer technology which blended into the world so well. It brought back so much nostalgia for a game that was released only last month by its classic art, environment, story and unnerving music and characters.

So fast-forward to present time, it was now my partner and I huddled around the computer theorising on the main characters and woman's attire, personality traits and mental state and wondering if really we missed a much deeper and darker meaning to this game, it characters and it's ending.

So thank you so much bringing that nostalgia back with this brilliant point-and click adventure game, I would certainly recommend this to anyone who are fans of this genre!

2. Primordia is the best point and click adventure in recent history, if not the best one ever made. 

This game, it's good. Characters are crazy, art is dark and tragic (but really well done) and the voice acting is better then most of the movies. The story, I don't see too much attachment to it or any point in it, but that's just me. Probably because Primordia had all of it, so I'm just complaining without no reason.

Having done so, I *really* wish that there was an option to give something other than a binary ""Yes"" or ""No"" recommendation for a game review but since there isn't I'm going to have to give this game a ""No.""

Now to explain:  I'm a longtime fan of all things adventure game and absolutely loved ""Primordia"" so this was a day one buy for me.  All the more so when I saw that Wadjet Eye was the publisher.

I was even more excited when I started up the game and started to get into the world of Strangeland. One of my favorite adventure games of last century was ""Sanitarium"" and the world of Strangeland reminded me immensely of that game.  As time went on, I was even more impressed by the voice acting and the dense references to multiple subjects (the Tarot, Norse Mythology, etc.) that kept me guessing as to what the ultimate 'twist' of the story of the game was going to be, especially in light of the interesting story twists of ""Primordia"".  That said... The twist never materialized.  At least, not as far as I could tell.  Perhaps if I had played the game with the commentary and/or annotations on it would've been different? 

In my opinion, the strength of adventure games has always been the story.  Some of the most well-beloved point and click adventure games of yesteryear had compelling stories that had people coming back to play them again and again and beautiful graphics, high-quality music and voice acting (where present) are bonuses that enhance the games, but ultimately story is king.

Sadly, story is where this game seems to be weakest.  Don't get me wrong, it's entirely possible that the story of this game might be amazingly thought-provoking and deep, but none of that really seems to have come through without (I'm assuming) having commentary and annotations on.  Honestly, I'm not about to replay the game to find out because the *last* thing I want to do is risk playing the game with those on and find out that the narrative isn't any better even with those additional resources.

tl;dr for those looking for a more concise review of ""Strangeland"" - The graphics and sound design is a worthy successor to ""Primordia"", but the plot left me feeling a big 'meh' of apathy.  Am I glad to have played it?  Yes, but I feel could've saved myself a few hours of my life and gotten just as much enjoyment by listening to the DLC OST.



EDIT 06/18/2021:  So after reading the responses to my initial review I sat down and replayed through the game again with the Annotations and Commentary on.  After completing the game again I feel that the game is *far* better and the story is much more comprehensible and stronger with the view behind the proverbial curtain that those offer.

Ultimately my feelings on the game after my second playthrough boils down to this:  

Do I think the game is as good as Primordia was?  No, but the gap in quality between the two isn't as vast as I thought initially.  

Do I feel that I was a bit harsh in my initial reactions to the game?  Possibly.  

I'm still not super-enthused that I was left feeling kind of ambivalent without the added tracks, but on the whole I have to say that I'm changing my review to a ""Recommend"" because of the Annotations and Commentary that help bridge the gulf.",1622584065,1624052683,True,0,0,0.54003828763961792,3,True,False,False,False,,1622586761,"Thank you for taking the time to write such a thoughtful review, and for playing both Strangeland and Primordia.  I'm very sorry you didn't have a better experience with the game.

I guess I would start by saying there is not a twist.  I do think there is understanding to be gained over the course of the game, but it's not meant to be a reversal story where some apparent premise of the story proves false in a surprising way at the end.  (Notwithstanding your praise of Primordia as having twists, I don't think of it as a ""twist"" story, either.)  It's unfortunate that the game suggests to players that there will be a twist because, inevitably, that expectation will be disappointed given the story's structure.

As to the commentary tracks, it would be silly for me to say, ""You didn't enjoy the game, but you should spend several more hours playing it.""  But I would push back a little on the reason you gave for not replaying -- wanting the game to remain in a state of Schrödingerian uncertainty as to whether it would be saved by the commentary and annotations.  I certainly don't want you to think better of our game for not having played it; if the commentary tracks make things worse, or don't make things better, it would be valuable for us to know that.  Conversely, if the annotations and commentary make your experience much better, that, too, would be important to know.

That seems especially so for a ""wobbler"" review like this one.  I actually think it's good that Steam requires an up or down vote, because it imposes a certain cruel rigor on reviewers, and makes the data easier for other players to read.  But I would be lying if I said that negative reviews don't hurt.  They hurt a lot -- it's personally very hard to read them, they harm the game's marketability, and they discourage other players from playing.  Despite this, I think it is important for players who genuinely dislike a game to leave negative reviews -- truth in advertising is important, and it is better for players to make informed decisions, rather than being drawn into games that they wind up disliking.

Here, when it seems like your reaction to the game was more equivocal, and when your review was very thoughtful and considered, I think it would be worth your resolving your doubts one way or another.

Anyway, let me close where I started: with thanks and an apology!"

I am very pleased to report that Strangeland does a great job, most of the time, of avoiding completely illogical puzzle solutions despite the game's nightmarish setting. Even if you do find yourself stuck, there is a very functional, if not somewhat overly abrasive, in-game hint system to help guide you through. The art is hauntingly beautiful, and probably the main draw. The voice-acting is hit or miss, but mostly hit.

Strangeland is a decidedly compact experience. I know it's probably unfair to compare it to the rich and sprawling Unavowed, which is arguably the best point-and-click made in the past decade, but it is a significantly shorter game here. We're talking no more than dozen screens, some of which are later recycled, which all adds up to probably around 3 to 4 hours for a first-play. Some of that play time is also taken up by things people wouldn't be faulted for finding tedious, like unskippable death animation bumpers and the occasional long-walk. It's probably better than a fail-state and a game over, but I did find myself getting annoyed when trying to experiment later in the game. All these things together means that Strangeland may not necessarily come up with a favorable value proposition to you if that proposition is based solely on playtime. I'll also say that, for a game that deals with the themes of death, suicide, self-harm, guilt, and regret; and has so many references to Greek mythology, the story feels a bit.... shallow. There isn't actually a whole lot going on. Despite no doubt being personal, there isn't anything new or revelatory.

A princípio, sim. Porém, através de uma aterradora - e incrivelmente interessante - jornada, [i]Strangeland[/i] vai se revelando algo mais do que familiar em seus fantásticos detalhes, e o nosso protagonista torna-se tão íntimo para aquele terrível mundo quanto para nós, meros espectadores daquele carnaval de bizarrices.

Sem nome, sem passado, e sem dignidade alguma, o tal protagonista segue através de cenários pixelados de altíssima qualidade e psicodelia, nos atirando muitas vezes em diálogos e sequências que parecem ter sido inspiradas diretamente em retratações infernais e, claro, no mais puro horror cósmico. Mas não é ""apenas"" para isso que o jogo existe, afinal todo o lúgubre contexto e enredo será explicado (ou não, mas prometo que pelo menos fará certo sentido) em seus momentos finais. Em muitos momentos parece que estamos a presenciar desconexas mensagens filosóficas que são vomitadas aleatoriamente pelos estranhos personagens do jogo, mas temos que lembrar que a mente do protagonista é o real terreno dessa trama, e o absurdo é o novo normal em Strangeland.

Para quem já conhece o Wormwood Studios vai, logo de cara, remeter esse jogo ao clássico [i]Primordia[/i], afinal - mesmo pertencendo a diferentes gêneros - temos um contexto parecido e uma arte bem peculiar. Acredito que, por isso, alguns esperavam um tipo de sequência da excelente jornada robótica pós-apocalíptica, mas o que temos aqui é algo bem diferente. Eu diria que temos algo muito mais pessoal nessa ""estranha"" terra, uma história extremamente íntima, que permeia através da autodescoberta e enfrentamento dos seus medos mais profundos. Há um link muito maior entre o jogador e o protagonista, e não é porque ele é humano, mas simplesmente porque a trama evoca filosofias, passagens, estigmas, conflitos e mais uma série de coisas que nos fazem envolver-se muito mais com tudo aquilo.

O jogo possui cenas pesadas, e - eu diria- cruas, em vários sentidos da palavra, mas o contexto demanda isso e, como já mencionei, tudo fará sentido e realmente precisa ser retratado desta forma - pelo menos neste mundo medonho no qual os variados personagens estão inseridos. Mas o que vem a ser esse mundo? Quem são estes personagens tão estranhos e, por vezes, aterrorizantes? Bem, realmente só jogando para tentar entender todo esse contexto no qual somos lançados e o motivo de certas atitudes e situações corriqueiras que iremos presenciar. Mas logo adianto que nem tudo são flores no que diz respeito ao total entendimento da trama, certo? Realmente acredito que isso foi colocado de maneira proposital, e muita coisa aqui não precisa ser realmente compreendida para ser aproveitada. Uma dica: só siga os trilhos e entre pela boca do palhaço quantas vezes forem necessárias.

A jornada aqui é meio curta. Registrei 7 horas de jogatina, porém eu vasculhei praticamente tudo, interagi com todos os personagens, li todos os diálogos e cacei todas as principais conquistas. Então, certamente, daria para finalizar tudo entre 5 e 6 horas se a trama for seguida da forma mais linear possível, ou até menos. Isso é ruim? Claro que não. O jogo nos apresenta muito bem todo o seu contexto e personagens e, principalmente, consegue transmitir a sua mensagem da melhor maneira possível, nos possibilitando até inúmeras interpretações - e, na verdade, é exatamente aqui que o jogo brilha. Então, não desanime pelo fato do jogo ser relativamente curto, pois o conjunto da obra vale cada centavo investido.

Um adventure que nos apresenta uma lúdica jornada da alma travestida de brutais horrores cósmicos. Estranho? Claro, afinal essa é a real intenção de [i]Strangeland[/i].",1622544660,1637810696,True,7,0,0.617298126220703125,0,True,False,False,False,,1622560563,"""Sem nome, sem passado, e sem dignidade alguma"" - poesia.

The game fails to make me sympathize with the main character; he is merely to be used as a device to solve puzzles and drive the narrative forward. He never feels human enough; he undergoes an allegorical journey but his personality rarely shows, let along develops.

As for the narrative, everything is either too on-the-nose or too irrelevant for me to care about. 30 minutes in and I already knew what this Strangeland was all about, who the woman was and why she kept jumping into the well. On the other hand, there's an NPC in game who keeps quoting and referencing poems and novels and scripts, but little did these references matter; thus all the richness hidden among those texts was reduced to a harmless quirk.",1622534895,1622534895,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,1622561262,"Sorry for your disappointing experience; it's very kind of you to recommend the game all the same.

I don't know that I would recommend this for any seeking a reprieve from gloom, but at the same time...It might be just what one in that situation needs, as Strangeland feels like it understands that and sometimes, when you're down, that kind of understanding can help.

On the surface, Strangeland is a game about a man with a straitjacket and amnesia who wakes up in the fragmented nightmarescape of a defunct carnival floating in the sky.  The carnival is populated by feral dogs and poisonous creatures, features crumbling floors and rusting rides, and at the center of it all is a wishing well where a beautiful woman plunges to her death again and again.  Our protagionist will also die many times while progressing through the carnival - dying is just another way to solve puzzles, and death is fleeting in Strangeland - at least, until it's not.  Our primary goal is to save the woman, and to defeat the mysterious ""dark thing"" that appears to be the corruption at the heart of the location.  

Below the surface, Strangeland is a game about grief and loss.  In some ways, this game is extremely heavy-handed with its use of metaphor to convey its messages.  In fact, the third act takes some of the main metaphors to the point of being absolutely literal.  But in other ways, the game is very subtle - or, if not subtle, the main story is sufficiently obfuscated by other details that it's not totally knocking you over the head.  I didn't connect what the game was actually [i]about[/i] until very near the end of the game, and I suspect a number of players might miss it altogether despite the hints along the way.

This is a point and click adventure developed by Wormwood Studios, of Primordia fame.  Wormwood is such an intriguing team because of what each of the three members bring to the table.  Victor Pflug, the game's artist and sound designer, has created a grotesque and beautiful darkseed-esque world of beige and purple that I had been itching to explore since some of the concept art dropped a few years ago.  Sound geeks will appreciate some of the funky, crunchy stuff going on with the audio in this game.  Programmer James Spanos further brings this vision to life by pushing the AGS engine in unexpected ways, from adding visual goodies like crackling electricity, reflections, and dust effects, to also designing what appears to be a custom-made save system.  Finally, writer and designer Mark Yohalem brings his trademark hyper-literary approach to dialogue and worldbuilding, with references that are sure to delight English professors or scholars of Norse mythology but enough dry humor to prevent things from becoming too bleak.

Publisher Wadjet Eye Games also contributed to the casting and direction of the voiceovers, and Strangeland is a treat here as well.  Abe Goldfarb is powerful in the leading role; many other familiar voices populate the supporting cast, and there's not one weak performance in the bunch.  

Puzzle-wise, Strangeland has a modern design with puzzles that are for the most part simple and logical, accessible by the majority of gamers, and takes roughly five or six hours to complete.  There are also several minigames sprinkled in, though most of them offer workarounds or alternate solutions if those aren't your thing.  If you get stuck, a built-in hint system will point you in the right direction.  The game features four endings, though clearly one of them is the intended canonical ending.  One of the game's absolute best bits, involving a tarot reading, also has multiple outcomes.  There is replay value, no one could possibly get all of the nuance out of the game with just one playthrough.  If you're really keen to hear more, you can enable a dev commentary mode as well as an ""annotation"" mode that explains all of the literary references, etc. 

This review ended up being pretty long, but the final verdict is that you should absolutely give this game a shot - unless you have absolutely no stomach for artistic mumbo jumbo or any kind of point and click adventure.  It's an oddball, but it's an extremely well-made one, with lots of care and attention given to each detail, and it's a personal journey that will resonate with many.",1622513209,1622513766,True,10,0,0.609236240386962891,0,True,False,False,False,,1622519005,"This is a truly beautiful review.

本作はポイントアンドクリック型のアドベンチャーゲームです。
システムとしては主人公を操作してアイテムを集め、活用して進んでいくというスタンダードなもの。
本作は、そういったアドベンチャーゲームの要となる世界観、キャラクタービルディング、展開、いずれも良く練り込まれています。

ビジュアルデザインはスクリーンショットでご覧になればわかる通り、グロテスクさも感じるかなり不穏なものです。
ギーガー調の悪夢のような世界に、記憶喪失の主人公。ワンクリックで死に至るお手軽さ。妄執を糧に、罵られながらもがくように道を開いていく主人公。
これだけの紹介では、非常に暗いゲームプレイを想起されるかもしれませんが、内容は奇妙に明るいものです。

というのも、登場人物がかなり多彩でユーモラスなのです。会う度にジョークをかましてくる門ピエロや、意味深で軽快な漫談をかましてくる3人娘、盲目の物書きとカラスの奇妙な関係。果ては1人ツッコミの上手い主人公まで、重苦しい世界観とテーマを彩ります。

そのため、筆者の感覚としては「この状況をどうにかしなければ」というよりも、「このアイテムはどんな反応が帰ってくるだろう？」「こうしたら主人公はなんて言うだろう？」という好奇心に突き動かされてプレイしていた感覚でした。

途中のパズル要素なども、物語を邪魔せず、ちょっとしたスパイスになるよう調整されていたように思います。

とにかく全体的に小気味よく、そして奇妙に愛着が湧く作品でした。
見た目の印象が気に入った方、不穏でおかしなキャラクターが好きな方はぜひ、手に取ってみてください。

It's a surreal point and click adventure that clearly takes place  inside someone's mind. There is a lot of heavy symbolism in the characters and environments. After finishing it, I can't exactly tell you what the point of the story was. It's some kind of Jungian story. The antagonist is the shadow self of the protagonist who despite a surly attitude, is actually quite helpful. 

The actual game play was decent. The puzzles weren't that tough. Usually when I'd get stuck it was because I missed a screen that I didn't realize existed. The phone number puzzle was the only that really had me stuck. There's a pay phone in the game where if you dial the operator you'll get a hint as to what to do next. The guy on the line yelled at me how to figure it out. There was one part I full-on needed to look at the solution to. As it turns out, there was glitch with the game that wasn't letting me progress. Playing this game right at launch does come with some hazards. 

The graphics is completely pixel art and the aesthetic is surreal nightmare. I really like the pixel art style. It works well for Wadjet Eye games. The cut scenes are all really high-res pixel art that always looks fantastic and visually interesting. 

The game is really short. There are some achievements that somewhat encourage multiple play throughs. There is also developer commentary that may have me dipping back in to hear it. However, a single play through took me under 4 hours.

I would prefer something more nuanced because some of the individual pieces are very good. The art, as with Primordia, is stunning. Most of the puzzles are clever but reasonable. All together, however, the game is systematically dragged down by the sophomoric delivery of the story.

The protagonist's voice acting is technically fine, but the writing lacks nuance for the actor to work with. His bland reactions give the player very little to work with in understanding the protagonist's plight. His lack of identity makes what is ultimately a very personal story about savage and deep emotional pain fall completely flat. This isn't a complaint that the protagonist's history isn't fleshed out. There's simply no indication that the character on screen is suffering, confused, or even annoyed by the reality he finds himself in.

The flaw bleeds into the plot. There's simply not much to work with. It's not the simplicity of the plot, so much as it is how each moment is sped through as quickly as possible. There's no time given to chew on any particular emotion or allow the protagonist to process the deeper meaning of his journey. The protagonist is never allowed to think or feel deeply. The ending falls flat not because the themes are too nuanced or the visuals don't communicate enough. It fails because without context it's a shallow and obvious resolution.

The story is simple and the themes universal to the human condition. This isn't the first time anyone has ruminated on them. To make it interesting, to make it really hit home, you've got to bring something specific to the table. If I'd learned anything about the protagonist, I might have been able to both judge and empathise. This isn't a demand for some sort of prologue or melodramatic scene in a hospital. However, without a compelling protagonist it falls to the setting to do the communication.

The setting suffers from the same issues. Despite the truly well done art, the content doesn't communicate enough to compensate for the plot. The set pieces are often almost generic in how little they mean to the plot. Since the writing falls back on the visuals to elaborate, and they elaborate on very little, it makes things feel more shallow than they otherwise would be.

In many ways, Strangeland feels like a demo. It's a short game, but there's no shortage of interesting screens and puzzles. What's lacking is context. A real reason for the player to relate to and want to explore with the protagonist. Some questions asked of the audience and the opinions of the creators reflected in their creation. Strangeland has a less interesting take on loss and guilt than the average sulky teenager's diary. The writing isn't even bad, it's just not there. Given such a short and mechanically simple game, there's just not much of anything at all.

There's many games and creative teams that aren't worthy of this much critique and that's what makes this difficult. If they hadn't already made Primordia, I wouldn't have written this review. If Strangeland had been filled with crude humour or the casual sociopathy of many other adventure games, I wouldn't have written this review. Unfortunately, this game demands to be taken seriously and fails as a result.",1622411702,1622411702,False,26,1,0.686843156814575195,4,True,False,False,False,,1622425124,"Sorry you had such a disappointing experience with the game, especially given the overall goodwill you've shown toward both it and us. It's the job of the story and the game to find the player, not vice versa, so when things don't pan out, there isn't really any explanation or argument to be offered in response, just an apology that the game was enticing enough to get you to invest yourself in it, and then unsatisfying once you did. Obviously, it's tricky to tell a story that lands with everyone, and perhaps even trickier when the story and its imagery is personal to the team (which may lend a certain inflexibility or idiosyncrasy), but that doesn't change the outcome.

I appreciate your giving Strangeland a chance, and sharing your thoughts. Sorry again for the disappointment."

The story never clicked, and while I will try to play it again with commentary and such on, because I want to give it a chance and see what everyone likes so much, I found it obvious and somewhat heavy handed. After talking to one or two characters you'll likely know how the story will play out, twists included, and while there is some interesting and fun visuals there aren't enough of them to carry the game alone. While some people will probably call it concise, I felt like the game really suffered for it's 2-3 hour story, as I feel like it really could have done some more, and developed or given me a little more to latch onto with the protagonist, as he comes across as gormless rather than in denial for a lot of it. The mystery and confusion really does seem what the devs were going for, but I think it was a big miss here. The gist of what was going on was obvious enough to me (characters literally tell you) that it really just left me uninterested in the protagonist. 

Honestly at the end of the day, the price is right, and you might love it, but just be aware that I'd say it's somewhat overrated.

I think it's important that negative as well as positive reactions are shared, since the last thing I ever want is someone to feel ""tricked"" into buying the game. I always want our games to be a value proposition for players -- they put their hope, time, and money into it, and we need to give them something substantial in return.

I do hope you try it with the commentary on. As I said to someone else, it's a bit of an outrageous suggestion -- ""You don't like the food? Well, here's a second helping, on the house."" But it is at least possible the commentary will shift your view. I would not say that mystery was what we were shooting for; uncertainty, yet, but not mystery per se. As you note, the game tells you the basic scenario right away. I would say it is more a matter of dramatic irony:  the player knows what's going on, but the protagonist doesn't. Obviously, that doesn't work for everyone and didn't work for you. But the commentary might at least illuminate what we were trying to do, and provide some additional thematic fodder. (The annotations, too, elaborate on the various references throughout.)

Anyway, this is a longwinded way of saying that I'm bummed you didn't enjoy the game more, but grateful that you gave it a shot and took the time to share your thoughts. Much love."

I *loved* Primordia, being a solid callback to the feel and style of the classics. As a veteran of these titles and more, I have to say….
Strangeland is incredible.
Couple trigger warnings in the game. Themes of suicide, death, loss, depression, etc. If you’re susceptible to these things, this may not be the game for you. And, fair warning to those with coulrophobia, like any good carnival, there are clowns….or things that look like them.
Surreal, psychological, and bleak beyond belief, intriguing, well written, a nightmare from the start, this game is a journey like no other I’ve experienced.
 You wake on a floating mass that is best called a carnival from hell. I’m saying Zdunich would be proud, here. You’re this confused, lost soul of a man, memory lost, and your first sight is a woman falling/jumping to her death, beyond your control. Spoilers? Nah, we’re a minute in, here.
Everywhere has details, characters, creatures, little nuggets to unearth, interact with, and learn about. And everything, I mean EVERYTHING, is connected. You’ll learn through play exactly how, and how much.
This world oozes Escher, Geiger, Lovecraft, and a pinch of the surreal called to mind with some of King’s work. All rendered in gorgeous 360p pixel art created with immaculate skill, and dedicated love to the classic looks of its predecessors. Improving on the steps of its forebears, the animation is flawless, no jerkiness, and some small animations, like hair movement, or cloth rustling add a beautiful touch of the modern to this classic style.
Again, fair warning, this game is mature themed, full of things that may scare, disturb, or otherwise jar the unwary.
The only flaw I can offer is this: with the bleak colours, some interactive objects are a little difficult to locate, or even know they exist. The game does ABSOLUTELY improve on some classic tropes, where death doesn’t set you back terribly far, the lack of moon logic is wondrous to behold, and everything (eventually) makes perfect sense. Even dying is a mechanic, not a setback.
Puzzles are difficult, but all completely available with in-game information, and you can always dial the operator for help, if you need it. The voice acting is phenomenal (at least in the English translation). And while not for everyone, and likely actively bad for some, the bleak, dark, oppressive tone holds through the entire game without becoming tiresome, cumbersome, or overwhelming. And the story makes PERFECT sense.
And, as a bonus, at least one of the creators, one of the writers, (I can only vouch for the one), is very friendly, responsive, and a delight to talk to, even in the limited way I was able to do so.
All in all, I give this a solid (and surprising) 9.5/10.

I don't normally leave reviews for games but I felt that this game deserved more from me than to be just another silent player. On that note I apologize if this review feels scattered or lacking. My friend told me about Primordia around 6 months ago and when he told mid-April that Strangeland would be released this month I immediately wishlisted it. 

Regarding gameplay I think that Strangeland did an excellent job of removing the typical obstacles I find dissuade me from adventure games. I truly appreciate being able to double click screen edges to travel immediately to the next room without having to wait and watch my slow ass walk across the room. The puzzles never felt obtuse or frustrating in a sense that I never felt like I had to try every conceivable item combination on every object with my favourite being the ""Wanton One"".

The voice acting and superb writing fleshed out the characters beautifully. Going through the game a second time with the annotations enabled is a must for any player, as the breadth and depth of its literary and cultural references is truly astonishing and admirable in its scope. 

The soundscape and visuals throughout are awesome. It truly helped evoke a sense of horror in some scenes to hear things like the almost purring sound during the interaction with the Teratoma, which created particularly memorable moments in the game. 

I am probably going to play this game off and on again for a long time because it's so dense with references, allusions, and metaphors that there will likely be something that has thus far gone unnoticed to take away and appreciate even after several playthroughs.

①なんといってもこのビジュアルスタイル/アートが好みの方は『買い』です。

②ウィットに富んだパズルや台詞＝現状では英語が理解できることが必須
(古い文献からの引用も多いため、英語の難易度は高めです。また、ダジャレや韻文なども多いです)

③『聖書』から『北欧神話』まで、『デカルト』から『サルトル』、『ニーチェ』まで、『ウォッチメン』から『ナイトメア・ビフォア・クリスマス』まで...メインカルチャーからサブカルまで、開発者への影響をバチバチと感じる引用やパロディが含まれています。これがハマる人にはガッツリ楽しめる。

有名どころで言うと、LucasArtsのアドベンチャーゲームや、ホラーゲームの名作『Sanitarium』、『I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream』のような雰囲気です。

My message to Victor: Thank you. I would love to go back to primordia again, I loved the lore, and I miss Nathaniel Chambers' music too! But Strangeland is now a proud part of my collection, and for about 5 hours, I and many others shared in your pain. Wishing you well for future projects.

I've only recently become familiar with Wadjet Eye Games and their illustrious pedigree of adventure titles, playing both The Shivah and Gemini Rue in the last year. Strangeland has to be another golden (sometimes literally) highlight in that lineup. Unfortunately, I've never played Primordia, the developer's last title, but I'll be picking that up shortly after posting this review.

At first glance, Strangeland offers a scorched blend of Lynchian/Jungian/Giger-esque aesthetic and philosophical archetypes, beautifully crafted and placed, but they betray a game with a very human and existential heart. Rich with symbolism through and through, there's heaps of referential meat to gnaw at here, and I can imagine that analysis of the very many motifs to be found in Strangeland will make at least one enthusiastic YouTube creator very popular within this niche. That said, I'm not sure if carefully sifting through every theme this game tries to represent would be a good approach, as the narrative strikes me as more poetic than a point-by-point plot to be perfectly mapped. Writing like that is always at danger of disappearing into its own behind, but Strangeland never tries to make its themes or conversations inaccessible for the sake of it, rather, with a little thinking, the deceptive polemics flying in all directions are relatively easy to decipher from a tired, emotive point of view.

Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't always as enjoyable, as its puzzle solutions are regularly quite obvious and only sometimes require memorization, or creative and lateral thinking. The 'How to Play' section explains that it's never the developer's intention to gate access to content via artificial difficulty or embarrassing leaps of logic, and that's great, but I wish the game made me work for my progress a little more. You can call a guide via the payphone in the game and sometimes they'll give you direct instructions if you're stuck. I might be a tired boomer, but I miss when adventure games wouldn't hold your hand so readily, especially in a setting that does all it can to present itself as toxic, nullifying, nihilistic, and always laughing at your ignorance. It feels like there's a disconnect there. Nothing you do feels like busywork however, and I applaud the fact that there are sometimes multiple ways in which to solve a problem.

That said, the game's narrative is expertly done, paced well (despite my gripes above), and features another standout performance by Abe Goldfarb, bringing that forlorn-gravel-greatness in every game I hear him in. What looks like a tremendously hollow and painful adventure game reveals itself as a mature response to the trauma of life, affirmative without being afraid to look reality in the eye.

This attitude is also embodied in Wormwood's approach to the relationship between [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1369520/view/3042722832284843123]developers and players.[/url] I don't feel overly assumptive when I say - this is the kind of studio you want to be creating games.

But this review in particular made me especially happy. It's goofy to say that a review praising your game is ""fair,"" but this does strike me as fairness lovingly expressed. The critique in the third paragraph is thoughtful, and it certainly resonates with me. I also like challenging puzzles, and share some of the concerns you have -- the question is how to craft puzzles that are challenging and complicated, but fair and well signaled. The game starts with a call from an antagonist who tells the player-character -- in different terms -- that he's bad at the three pillars of adventure gameplay (finding hotspots, collecting items, and solving puzzles), so you're right that there's a disconnect if the player then cruises through the puzzles. :)

That said, I do think we did a good job of having the puzzles/solutions thematically integrated, plausible to the setting and protagonist, and reasonably well cued (though there are a couple places some players seem to get stuck), and there are two or three that still demand lateral thinking. :D

Anyway, this is a long-winded way, via engaging with your thoughtful points, of saying thank you. I loved your review, and I'm grateful for players like you and others who take the time to share their thoughts with us."

Tuhaflık, henüz ilk dakikadan itibaren oyuncuyu karşılıyor ve oyunun sonuna kadar da kendisinden ödün vermeden devam ediyor. Buna örnek vermesi açısından (merak etmeyin major bir spoiler değil) **mesela oyuna ilk başladığımızda koskoca bir palyaço kafasından içeri giriyoruz, sonrasında ölüyoruz sonra bi daha giriyoruz bi bakıyoruz ki kafamız yok, kendi kafamızla konuşuyoruz**. Bunun gibi durumlar karşısında ''Lan noluyo'' diye sürekli bir Sedat Peker tepkisi vererek devam etmek oldukça ilginç bir deneyim yaşatıyor. Kaldı ki Source Code tarzı bu türden deneyimler yaşamanın, bizleri oyuna daha da perçinlediği kanaatindeyim. 

Şimdiiii, kaybettiğimiz eşimizin imgeleriyle başlayan görüntüler, ana karakterimizin içsel çatışmalarının birtakım somut nesnelere aktarılmasıyla harmanlanarak bizi oyun boyunca kendi dünyasına çekmeye devam ediyor (ulan ne cümle kurdum kendim bile anlamadım he). Bu durum size de bir şey çağrıştırıyor mu ? Evet, oyunumuz Silent Hill 2'den birçok etmeni bünyesinde barındırıyor, buradan da tahmin edeceğiniz üzere oyunumuz psikolojik gerilim türünde. Bu ögeler arasında göze çarpan başlıca konular ise kesinlikle atmosfer ve müzikler. Sürekli tedirgin eden, rahatsız eden bir ortam ve ambiyans var. Yine benzer bir konu olarak ise; kayıplar, trajedi ve içsel çöküşlerin oluşturduğu melankoliyi söyleyebilirim. Nasıl ki Primordia cıvıl cıvıl sevimli bir oyun ise Strangeland onun tam aksine çok daha depresif ve melankolik bir yapım olmuş. İkisi de ele aldığı konuları oldukça güzel işlemiş yapımlar, yani bu türe ilginiz varsa Primordia'yı da denemenizi tavsiye ederim. Benim ayrıca değinmek istediğim iki konu var biri sanat tasarımı diğeri ise metinlerin doluluğu. Muhteşem yani diyecek başka bir söz bulamıyorum, bir tane dahi boş bir diyaloğa rastlamadım. Psikolojiden mitolojiye dek uzanan ve sürekli oyuncuyu düşündürüp, beyin fırtınası yapmaya teşvik eden repliklere sahip. İçerisinde barındırdığı bu repliklerde karşılaştığım bilmediğim bazı terimleri de araştırarak onlarca yeni bilgi öğrenmiş oldum. Bu da benim açımdan çok olumlu bir durum. Yani oyunumuz kısa, öz ve adeta her bir sahnesi ilmek ilmek işlenmiş. 

Son olarak ben yaşamış olduğum bu güzel tecrübeden oldukça tatmin olmuş şekilde ayrılıyorum. İndirim beklemenizi gerektirecek bir durum yok, sadece sanatsal tasarım yani bir ''artbook'' olarak bile sunulsa bu paraya fazlasıyla değecek bir eser olmuş. Wormwood Studios'un oyun sektöründe hak ettiği yerlere gelmesi ve daha çok içerik üretmesi gerektiğini düşünüyorum. Bu sebeple türü seviyorsanız ve hikayesi üzerine de kafa yorarım diyorsanız oyunu satın alarak bu küçük geliştirici ekibe destek olabilirsiniz.

edit (since the developer was kind enough to read through reviews, its only fair i give the game a serious one) :
The game worked great as a nostalgia trip for someone who loved the retro point and click games such as the Monkey Island series, which is my standard for the genre since its what i grew up with. It also resonates with the different surreal/horror(esque) p&c games i played more recently such as The Cat Lady, where the setting is in a strange and unfriendly enviroment, despite it being mostly a part of your head. I loved the world where the game was set, it always felt so enveloping, and so did the story.
The world creation was amazing, and the attention to detail was great, forcing me to speak to everybody and try everything everywhere, just to get to hear every single interaction, one line joke or complaint about me making stupid combinations that the developers were keen to add.

I am a fan of Wadjet Eye's releases but I feel like this game was one of their weaker ones. Wormwood did an amazing job on Primordia (My first introduction to Wadjet Eye's releases) but Strangeland left a lot to be desired. Not saying it was bad, but compared to other titles Wadjet Eye have released and Primordia it wasn't as enjoyable. There are two reasons why I say this:
1. The story is too subjective. This isn't inherently a bad thing when it comes to games but I think it suits other genres better. I like point and click games that are conclusive, a tiny narrative that you can track the start and the end of. In Strangeland it feels as if the game starts halfway through the story and then ends at the climax. You spend a lot of the game learning about his past in a very indirect manner. [spoiler] After finishing the game all I know for certain is that he lost his wife and is now struggling with the aftermath [/spoiler]. I was disappointed when I reached the end of the game and it offered little to no explanation of the circumstances that led to this occurring. The only thing keeping my interest throughout the game was figuring out the aforementioned circumstances but- that never happened. It just left me unsatisfied. I plan to replay the game though, maybe I will pick up on things I missed on my first playthrough. 
2. Because of the nature of the story, traditional logic doesn't apply well. There were a lot of puzzles which did not feel very intuitive. Combine this with the esoteric nature of the game (When I replay this I'm going to have an encyclopedia handy) and you end up feeling a little lost from time to time. It wasn't that the puzzles were difficult, some of them just felt very absurd (But I guess that matches the story). I managed to get through the game without using the hint payphone too much though, so it isn't too bad ( [spoiler] Used it when collecting the last spirit, prior to attaining the torch I wasn't able to interact with the shooting gallery so I just wrote that area off. Also used it to start the spirit hunt in the first place because I was too fixated on bringing the bare torch to the engine to ignite it [/spoiler] ).

The visuals are mesmerising and the soundtrack is haunting.
Those things I cherish the most to fully immerse myself into the game.
And I also was fully into the story. Digging into every detail that I could: the characters, dialogue and all the interactions that were available to me.

I was a bit disappointed that there were not much of different choices that I could take. For every decision I thought to myself: ""Could I have done something else? Did I just do a good thing?""
But it was not that kind of game, which I started to appreciate more as I kept playing.
I loved the path that the main character went through, but I didn't really connect with him that much to enjoy the ending. That'd be the hardest thing to explain without spoilers, so be warned, but I'll try to keep them vague anyway.
So [spoiler] I understood the whole gist of the Strangeland, the place, but I still couldn't stop thinking that by doing all the questionable deeds I missed all the good choices I could take to help other characters, and so I went more and more deep into the abyss, on the way to the worst ending. But all those actions turned out good for the main character and pushed him through to the end. And the thing is: I didn't feel like it was deserved. There was a catharsis, but I didn't feel it.

If you've played Primordia and are expecting more of the same story-wise you may be a little disappointed, as this is a less literal world that has been created with more abstract mysteries to uncover,  characters speak in riddles and a lot is left to interpretation (I found similarities in terms of the narrative to that of Fran Bow). There are literary and mythological references that I got (and probably others that I didn't) which add to the texture, but I don't think are necessary to understand to enjoy the story as a whole.

The puzzles, whilst often involving strange applications of physical objects are consistent in their approach and make sense in the world they inhabit, so feel logical and never frustrating. There are a couple of more simplistic ""click to make shapes"" puzzles, that don't quite fit the aesthetic of the world, but this is a minor quibble.

My expectations for Strangeland were sky-high, not just because of my affection for Primordia but because a) the artwork/aesthetics from Victor PFlug that were teased before release were obviously fantastic, and b) the writing in Primordia demonstrated unusually strong worldbuilding and structure, along with the sense of taking part of a broader discourse/tradition in literature, poetry, etc. Developer Mark Yohalem (who comes across as a cool guy and very accessible and generous with players) clearly knows his Shakespeare, Bible, Greeks, etc. Not to mention that Wadjet Eye is apparently allergic to publishing bad games.

So were expectations reached? In terms of quality I'd say yes for the most part, but with the caveat that I don't think this game will have quite as broad an appeal as Primordia did. Partly because Primordia probably just about hit the ceiling of a niche market for an old-school indie P&C adventure, but also because of the unrelenting ""inwardness"" of the game. There are a lot of games with themes about the human psyche, depression, loss, etc., but even knowing somewhat what to expect I was surprised by the abrupt opening that landed us immediately inside a mindscape with an intensely singular focus. Most players should understand pretty quickly what's generally going on, making later revelations unsurprising. To be honest, I wasn't able to invest in most of the characters in the same way as the characters in Primordia because of the understanding that they were all figments or fragments. In a certain sense, there's not really a plot- the character development and exploration of a character's psychology *is* the story, and it's plumbed at depth (but again, not with much specificity). It is quality in its presentation, but may not be to everyone's tastes in the way that post-apocalyptic robots might be.

The game also openly invites a boatload of easy comparisons to Edgar Allen Poe (to me the most striking influence), H.P. Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury, Kafka, H.R. Giger, the video game version of Harlan Ellison's ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream"" (both visually and in story tone), Greek tragedy, and likely a host of other influences I'm unfamiliar with. You might think that this would open up the game to criticisms about lack of originality- a carnival of horrors is hardly new ground. Given how well mined some of these themes have been, however, I was surprised at how original the game feels. You get the palpable sense that the developers pored their hearts and personalities into the game, and that really goes a long way toward making the whole project work.

Finally, it should be noted how smooth and professional the game as a production. I'm loathe to even implicitly criticize my favorite old Sierra games, but the interface, difficulty, and ease of use are simply much more accessible than most of the old classics. In general the difficulty and puzzles hit the right spot I think, although I wouldn't say most puzzles stand out particularly one way or another.

TLDR- It's a well-made game that the devs clearly poured their hearts into.  It will likely have a narrower appeal than Primordia, but in my book that's perfectly fine. Those looking for a personalized psychological horror will love it.

EDIT- Playing through the endings I noticed that I misattributed the artwork to Spanos (who is responsible for the impressive job done in coding, VFX, and more) rather than Victor Pflug.

[b]strangeland[/b] is yet another great point & click adventure by wormwood studios, also responsible for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/227000/]primordia[/url], one the best adventures in recent years (or ever, really).

it's a similarly dark and thought-provoking tale, largely taking place in a creepy amusement park. lots of symbolism, wordplay, disturbing imagery, sprinkled with a bit of humor. puzzles include typical inventory-based things to figure out, some of my pet hates (lights out and rotating stuff), and more obscure riddles, but there's a [b]hint system[/b] if you ever get stuck.

don't want to talk much about the story, as that's the primary pull of this genre, plus I knew nothing about it either, didn't even skim the store page for the premise. I knew that after [b]primordia[/b] I was going to play it immediately anyway, the few screenshots I saw were enough to convince me it's gonna be a deliciously grim ride.

[b]the artwork is fantastic, voiceovers are a mixed bag though[/b], which was a surprise, even the protagonist wasn't a good fit, I don't think. the clown was definitely the high point, but most of the others sounded more like friends and family doing the devs a favor instead of (I'm guessing) semi-professionals doing their job well (though the devs themselves also voiced a few characters).

another thing of import is that [b]you can and will die, a lot[/b]. it fits the theme and is often necessary to progress, plus it's kinda fun to find new ways to off yourself (one word-based occurence was especially satisfying) or hear a new joke from the clown. also, there's [b]no progress loss, just a bit of backtracking in a relatively small game world[/b], the death cutscene can be skipped with esc, and imminent perishment is usually signposted, but I still found it frustrating after a while. the middle section of the game was especially bad in this respect, as you're constantly in danger of dying and have to leave the current screen to avoid it. added nothing but stress, couldn't think in peace, had to keep moving just in case.

controls and settings are as expected, separate volume settings, windowed mode, brightness, subtitles, click to advance dialog toggle, the usual commentary, and manual saving anywhere, on top of autosaves. there are [b]multiple endings[/b], so it's obviously a good idea to save before making the final decision to check all of them out.

I had no idea what to expect, maybe a bigger world to explore, if anything (and better voiceovers), but [b]I really enjoyed my time with it[/b] (took [b]about 5 hours[/b]), and I hope we won't have to wait another 8.5 years for wormwood's next game.",1622149400,1622149400,True,22,1,0.694061398506164551,0,True,False,False,False,,1622150450,"Thanks -- always enjoy your reviews, especially when they are saying such generous things about our games.

Primordia is one of the best adventure games ever made if you ask me.

I didn't find Strangeland quite as good but it's still an extremely enjoyable game. It still sits quite far above most ""modern"" point and click games that I've played.

Now, this is a very strange game. A strange setting. Psychological horror for sure, and a lack of... well, real elements. Very allegorical. But, where I think most games stumble in this regard is that they tend to feel pretentious. And maybe Strangeland is that, but I felt like it kind of was very self-aware of what it is. Perhaps due to the humor that also shows up in the game. It really kind of deflates the game of feeling too self-important.

And yet, the story ends up to be really effective in my opinion, surprisingly so. It's a very well written game, just like Primordia was.

The aesthetics and audio are great and feel very unique, especially in the adventure game genre.

My main complaint would be that the game is a bit too easy when it comes to the puzzles. However, this is, as always, a double-edged sword in the case of adventure games. It does keep the game pace up, which is nice in itself.

I’ve discovered Wormwood Studios and Primordia in 2016, 4 years after its initial release and never forgot about the game after all these years, only regretting not getting it sooner. Everything about the game left me in awe: the art, the story, puzzle designs, characters, the list is too long. It was a wonderful point and click adventure that I enjoyed thoroughly even though I never was a fan of the genre, ever playing a few games, and finishing even less.
To say that I was excited about the new game, Strangeland, is to say nothing. I didn’t follow every little piece of information about the game, leaving everything to be a nice surprise once the game is released and I try it out myself, and was patiently waiting for its release.
The story never clicked with me. I feel like I never had a reason to care about the protagonist and his  struggles, the woman he’s desperately trying to save, and pretty much any other character in the game. It also doesn’t help that “everything” is a metaphor for something, to the point you just stop trying to decipher the messages game’s sending you because there’s 10 more on the way and your brain can only process so much trauma deciphering at once. It does unravel at the end but still leaves some things unanswered/unexplained/left for interpretation, which is fine given how personal the theme can be. I also felt like the whole experience the protagonist is going through in the game is, well, meaningless, as in it feels like there’s no character development, no growth, no fighting your internal struggles and overcoming them, learning from mistakes and doing better; everything feels like “a thing to do”, or just another whatever metaphor. “I’ve done this and now I get to continue” – not because the character learned something about himself or ended up victorious in a fight with his own demons (after all, that’s what the game seems to be about: learning to accept tragedy, dealing with your internal insecurities and struggles, and, in the end, moving on), but simply because you did X and Y and solved the puzzle, and the metaphors for the sake of metaphors aren’t helping to associate yourself and sympathize with the character. There are developer commentaries and annotations that can help you understand intricacies better, bringing more insight into the story, but after finishing the game with an understanding of general outlines of the story I felt no urge to engage in them to learn more.
Other important thing to talk about is the music, as it sets up the mood and atmosphere, which I feel is especially important in a game that relies on surreal, fantastic and disturbing imagery, and, to be honest, I don’t remember a single track or melody from the game. I never at any point in the game stopped and listened to its tunes, not paying attention to tracks that play at all. Nothing really clicked or hit, same as the story. I don’t have much to say about it since it almost didn’t exist in my mind during the playthrough.
Puzzles are fine. They lean towards illogical a bit, but that’s because the setting and circumstances demand it, not because “we need to come up with some absolute nonsense to stop the player from continuing”, and the game never turns into “guess what developer had in mind with this one!”. One particular “puzzle” that required writing your name was fun, but felt out of place. Game also features generous tips on puzzles that are woven into it, which is always nice. Only time I used them out of desperation was deciphering Murmurs future prediction.
And even with all this negativity I can’t say I disliked or hated the game, just like I can’t say that it’s a bad game, that it’s haphazardly/carelessly slapped together, that there was no effort/thought put to it, because it is clearly a lovechild of the dev team, with a lot of craft and thought put into all of its many aspects, and the themes developers chose to tackle being challenging to represent or even work with. 
It breaks my heart to say this, but I was disappointed in Strangeland and the experience it offered and can't recommend it.",1622141034,1622141034,False,69,4,0.738192975521087646,9,True,False,False,False,,1622148994,"Breaks my heart to hear it, but I'm glad you said it.

There's really no response to offer but to say sorry. It's bad enough for a game to disappoint; it's worse within that disappointment is mingled with the kinds of hope and generosity you've shown toward us as developers.

Even if in this particular instance I might prefer for you to be able to leave a ""mixed"" rating, there is a sort of cruel honesty that Steam compels by forcing the big red thumbs down. I mean, for selfish reasons it's a shame because obviously some number of players will just see the icon and not buy the game, rather than reading your thoughtful criticisms of it.

Плюсы:
- Высокое качество текста, стилистически он похож скорее на пьесу, чем на сценарий видеоигры.
- Выразительная визуальная составляющая.
- Насыщенность и темп повествования.
-  Почти нет бэктрекинга.
- Головоломки решаются интуитивно, но есть пара исключений.

Минусы:
- Банальный сюжет без неожиданных поворотов.

The puzzles are a bit on the easier side, which I don't see as a failure - compared to the dev's previous game, Primordia, there's much less of ""try everything on everything else"" and ""search for the hard to see object"". The game took me less than 6 hours to complete - there are multiple endings, but the paths don't seem to diverge much.

When it comes to the story, it's hard to talk about without spoilers - it's a grim tale helped by the creepy, unsettling art (but not scary - the horror here is more psychological). The game draws explicitly on some psychoanalytical theory (and implicitly on philosophical ones), and it leaves a lot of the plot up to the player's interpretation - which might annoy some people, but it didn't annoy me.

I saw this on the store page and couldn't believe that Wormwood Studios has made another game, so I excitedly bought it thinking I'll have another amazing experience like Primordia, which is the best point & click game I've played. But this was such a let down.

I was bored throughout most of the game, it started out well enough and had me curious about things. But as I kept playing, I felt like everything I was doing was pointless and I barely had any of my questions answered, it was just random puzzles. I kind of stopped caring around the end, but I kept playing because I wanted to see the game through. 

Everything I'll write from here on out is a spoiler.


[spoiler] The endings of the game still don't answer much.
Who the hell am I?
Where am I?
How did I get here?
Am I dead? Am I insane?
What is ""the dark thing""? Or the crab. I don't even know at this point. And what did it do to me? I was sent to a dead version of the carnival, then I did some more pointless puzzles that sent me to a mirror room that opened a portal back to the ""normal"" carnival. What exactly, was the point of that whole section?
Who is my shadow? And why was it relentlessly killing me at the end?
Who is the blonde lady? And why was she jumping into the well over and over, but when I reached her at the top of the carnival it was like nothing happened?

 
The game essentially ends either with you dying, or flying into the sun. whatever that means. Was I just not paying attention? Or is the game really that vague? I really hope it's the former, but even still, I don't really like that kind of conclusion, I feel like the player or the reader shouldn't have to make up an ending that satisfies their logic. The author should end the story for me.

While I think the questions you raise are answered in the game, that doesn't change the fact that the answers didn't come through to you or, more importantly, that the drama and themes of the game didn't come through to you.  That is our fault (more precisely, my fault as the designer, it has nothing to do with the art, music, voice acting, or code).

And I'm glad they didn't explain everything from the start, really makes you wanna explore. The writing in this game is very engaging. When I started the game I just played it through till the end. I was too curious to take a break. That being said, the game took me around 4-5 hours to finish.

The puzzles were fairly straightforward. Managed to solve all of them without using the ingame help system. One puzzle made me wonder if there were other outcomes, but I didn't manage to find anything else so moved on... [spoiler]The puzzle where you have to write down your name..

It is a very personal tale, a bit too simple for my taste, but also touching, warm and fundamentally uplifting and wise in its simplicity seen out from the protagonists view of being in a very dark place, having lost his way.
The games ambience took me on a beautiful and joyous journey and I was especially pleasantly surprised by its use of humor, treading a fine line of still being serious but on the other giving it a comic feel, don't think I'd finished it here and now otherwise, unless perhaps it'd been a longer and more complex game.
Speaking of which, the protagonist seemed a bit simpleminded on the one hand, though on  the other hand his mind could just have been broken? I mean had he read, grappled with and understood something of the psychoanalyst  Lacan himself and various mythologies? Had he just faced a too impactful trauma and hard life, or was it in a Jungian vein, just the collective unconscious that tried to bring him back to the world of the living giving him a hand? (the developers have kindly added a dev commentary you an toggle on, but not sure I have the patience to walk through the game again with it in hand - though I am somewhat tempted! :D). 
  
The in-game build hint system in the narrative structure was lovely touch, even if I'd prefer more complex puzzles (or none at all; adventure games are not really my genre) like we find them--or some of them been ages--in games like Riven. though if you like puzzles like those in Primorida and its ilk, then they seem to be as beautifully and skillfully made or more so.

I think which a person prefers is entirely up to their preferred genres. In any case, it's a worthy addition and worth playing.

The graphics are appropriately detailed for a point and click adventure game, and the art direction is on point. Visual effects are the match of anything in the genre, and the soundscape is immersive and thematic to the point where I don't remember it as anything but an integral part of the game.

Point and Click gameplay is always its own special beast. While there's no insane jump of logic at any time, some things are less clear than others. However, the game has a built-in hint system for anyone, like me, who sometimes just gets frustrated at a puzzle and wants to move on. 

The storytelling and plot are the kinds of things that can really speak to someone's experiences, but can tell a solid story regardless of life history. Of course if you ever laid awake at night wishing your love of Greek play structure or Norse mythology led to a deeper understanding of a work, this is a game for you.

Which brings me to what made me go from luke-warm to hot on the game: it contains both a developer commentary, discussing things from home-built audio equipment to executing the will of a family member, and an annotation mode that carefully explains the truly heroic amount of allusion in the game. My enjoyment increased ten-fold with a second playthrough going through the commentary and reading about all the references I simply failed to notice.

My first run was about four hours, and I was reasonably thorough, but I expect detail-orinted players, and those who refuse to use the help system, may take a bit longer.

I recommend the game, it's technically excellent and is a solid point and click aventure, but it does take some settling in to really feel comfortable.

At first I had my worries. Sure, the art looks great and it's from the people who delivered before, but how long can a company stay in business and not get complacent? And why do I keep remembering other games while playing? Didn't I see that feature in Dead Synchronicity and this one in Whispered World? And I could swear I saw that in Samaritan Paradox. Didn't I see that design decision in Sanitarium? Didn't I see that style of storytelling in Tormentum and art style in Dark Seed? Is this supposed to be a love letter to those who came before or a postmodernist take on some sort of meta point and click adventuring? Or have I been playing these for way too long at this point?
Whatever the answer is, they still managed to come up with a fresh and polished feel that keeps you riveted long enough to play through in a single sitting. The use of mythology is the most inventive and clever I have seen in a very long while. The psycho-philosophical musings and rants of madness are written so well you never get dropped out of the experience in spite of the obviously alien feel they are supposed to evoke. Dark themes intertwine with very subtle humour. And that is helped by voice acting that is incredible even by Wadjet's own standards.
AdventureGamers is probably going to say that this is the Dark Souls of point and clicks, I am going to say that you should play it because it is great and will be on everyone's 2d adventure top list this year and boy have the last couple of years been dry in that regard.

I don't mind that Wormwood are doing a Planescape: Torment thing again (at least there's no floating head this time — but hey, we got a giant blacksmith!). I don't mind the on-the-nose references (geez Louise, is that a one-eyed old wisdom-seeker under a tree, I wonder if it's referring to mythology in any way). I think the imagery is there — some overused (circus, crows, mirrors, golden light), some original (the whole imago thing with its layers on meaning and more), some brilliant (the Dark Thing turning into a [spoiler]crab[/spoiler] seems odd and even ridiculous at first, until you realize it represents [spoiler]the character's depression due to his wife dying of cancer — so, literally of ""crab""[/spoiler]). The art is beautiful and the voice acting is serviceable.

So why does the whole thing feel less than the sum of its parts?

[b]WHY IT FALLS FLAT[/b]
The answer is simple: because the core story is so impossibly overused and trite.

Like, seriously. It seems like 90% of dark surreal plot-driven games are about how:
[list]
[*] you're actually already dead;
[*] or your wife is and you're coping with the loss;
[*] or you've actually MURDERED your wife;
[*] or you've actually MURDERED your wife and then killed yourself so you're now DEAD TOO;
[*] (optionally: it's about writer's block).
[/list]

I'll let you guess which category this game belongs to. And sure, it's possible to tell an old story so brilliantly it will feel fresh — but representing a broken character with broken mirrors and writing ""don't we all wear masks every day?"" with a straight face is not the way to go about it.

I think I see what it tried to do writing-wise. Instead of spelling out the obvious or burying the player under unnecessary detail (kudos for that!), [i]Strangeland[/i] went for a sort of [i]Dear Esther[/i]-like poetic writing, full of wordplay and emotion. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work. There wasn't enough detail in the writing (I mean granular, specific imagery, not biographical detail), weren't enough interesting and insightful metaphors, the long-winded speeches felt empty, often regurgitating the same idea many times without adding new facets to it. 

(There were exceptions, like the aforementioned imago moment, or the mention of [spoiler]an onkos mask[/spoiler] that was a nicely subtle way to communicate the main plot point without being too in-your-face.)

[b]UNEXPECTED BRILLIANCE[/b]
The strangest thing (heh) is that there are glimpses of interesting worldbuilding. A character's surreal mental scape is a free-for-all — it doesn't really [i]need[/i] original imaginary creatures and a wider context of a setting. Yet [i]Strangeland[/i] has them! A trio of characters who'd done something terrible to a streammaid have an odd and curious idea of what life is, odd patterns of speech. I want to know more about them, not the protagonist's trite drama!

The dialogue with the starfish in particular was the highlight of the game for me. It was a good attempt to represent an inhuman mind, and I laid off finishing the puzzle for a while to read all conversations. They did indeed feel like I was talking to a fundamentally alien being.

I'd much rather play a game about the hunter who interacted with it and caugth it, and I hope in the future the developer would rather explore that side of their creativity.

[b]OVERALL[/b]
There's clearly a lot of passion and talent behind the game. And good cultural education, too. Judging by the ""Im memoriam"" at the end, the core story might be personal for the developer — and it has been pointed out before that it's the most personal stories that sometimes come across as the most banal when we try to share them.

It's not an entirely ""thumbs down"" game too, I'm more on the fence. Giving it a thumbs down for now to balance out the perfect review score — I don't think it deserves that either. More like a 6/10.

It's not a very long game, about 4 to 5 hours, granted it would be a bit longer if it didn't have a hint system. There is an object you can use to get hints, most of the time it's a spoiler so be careful if you want to figure out the puzzle yourself. Technically it has multiple endings, but you can get them by saving at the end, they are not tied to the progression as far as I can tell. On that note, I assumed that the choices I made throughout the game would have more impact, it feels like the game implies more possibilities than it has. I won't elaborate on the narrative too much, I am sure you can tell it has some kind of psychological twist on the internal struggle. I have to say the whole mind exploration is not very unique, and frankly, the outcome is somewhat predictable, but as far as the dialogue and characters go, I enjoyed the writing. You will meet all kinds of strange individuals that will poke you and make fun of you, the game is actually funny, despite being somewhat serious - love that bird by the phone, best character.

At first, I didn't like the inventory system because you have to open a separate panel, that said, you can just use the mouse scroll which solves the problem. As far as the puzzle design, I like that you incorporated the theme of the world - there is context to what you doing, and that is what I am looking for in a narrative game. I didn't struggle too much despite the obscurity of the environment, if you paying attention most of the puzzles are not too difficult. I can never find the words to express how I feel about beautiful artwork, but I will add that it feels like you planned the visuals very well, there is a lot of variety and changes in scenery that I didn't expect, especially the second half of the game, it was pretty cool. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) [b] The Narrative & Optional context [/b] - I don't think that you picked the most original idea to work with, but I did enjoy the conversation between the characters and the context it adds to the experience, the game is not wasteful with the words and always provides something interesting. On that note, I like that game has optional responses if you doing something that is not intended to progress. There is a good mixture of humor and philosophical views, it's a strange tone overall I must admit, but at least I was engaged the entire time. 

(+) [b] The Visuals [/b] - what can I say it's a good looking game, and it was fun to explore. There are many additional animation cycles and backgrounds that most devs would not care to animate, so nice attention to detail there as well. I also enjoyed the atmosphere while I was playing the game, but now that I think about it, I can't remember the music. Not that I didn't like the soundtrack, it only worked for me within the context of the game. Like I said in the forum, it feels like a $20 premium indie game based on the effort, but thank you for the lower price.

(+) [b] Creative Puzzles & Optional Hint system[/b] - my stance on the puzzle design is that they should be a part of the narrative, and for the most part you did a really good job with it. In some games the puzzle might not have a reason to exist, but here they are used to add more context for the characters. I only found one puzzle a little confusing, you already know which one.

(+) [b] UI [/b] - I don't mind the lack of highlights as long as the game is visually clear, and I don't recall having any issues. I see that you streamlined the interactions a bit, for example, the puzzle with feeding and dialogue skip in general. Also, the mouse scroll is very helpful. 

(+) [b] Optional Achievements, Optional responses, Optional triggers [/b]

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Random Nitpicks [/u] - so that visual effect the character gets every so often got pretty annoying, I get why it's there, but I don't think it needed to happen as often as it did (reminds me of that Castlevania cutscene lol). Come to think of it, you probably don't need to see the death cutscene the second time, unless it loads the game maybe. On a side note, some people that play adventure games might struggle with a speed-based puzzle due to accessibility issues (not sure if you can skip it).

[u] Voice acting [/u] - overall the voice acting was decent, the only reason I bring it up is because some characters were voiced extremely flat, and it took me out of the experience. Look, I get it, you work with what you got, but if I had to nitpick one thing, I wish all characters were a bit more immersive. The fortune teller was done very well, feels professional, I wish everyone was like that. 

[u] The endings [/u] - I don't like that you can just save at the end and choose whatever you want, if you used those as part of the choices during the game, it would be more interesting to figure out, in my opinion. I thought the tarot cards and the ladies had something to do with it, but I guess not - would have been a good way to do it. I don't want you to change anything now, unless maybe you want to add more secret endings.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]

I have to say it was a little difficult for me to enjoy the game because I came with high expectations, I wish I could experience it not knowing the dev's previous work, but it did not disappoint by any means. I see that a lot of thought went into making every aspect of the game, and sometimes that is all I can ask for as a fan of the genre. I was not completely in love with the story and that is where I feel I get a disconnect, I think it was too predictable, but it's just my opinion. Again, the dialogue was fine, I enjoyed the characters, but the actual plot overall, feels like I went there like 50 times before. Don't have much criticism for the actual gameplay though, clearly, it was planned very well.

If you are in the unlikely position of being here and having no idea what this means, it means you should buy this game immediately if you like point-and-click adventures.

Why will it be a select favourite? Because certain aspects of Strangeland are exceptional. Beneath a bizarre horror aesthetic lies the most ""human"" game in the entirety of the Wadjet Eye catalogue. Barring what I feel to be some story missteps near the close, the starkly personal tale is refreshing in its originality. Within such a context the game understands that the player has no reason to care for the woman, but very deftly eases you in and makes you care. The empathy, with the duality that implies, is strong with this one; rare stuff for any point-and-click.

Tightly coupled with this is the presence of an almost possessed design vision. You can almost detect the way Mark Yohalem was gripped by the impetus to make this game and absolutely nothing else until it was completed, even knocking Fallen Gods, another Wormwood game in progress, by the wayside in his fervor. This intensity makes the game what it is and cannot be described piecemeal; you will simply have to play this game to understand, and it will not take long.

Puzzles are on the easy side, but this is partly faciliated by the thoughtful ergonomics seen in other Wadjet Eye titles such as the aforementioned Technobabylon and Unavowed. The game simply does not waste the player's time and provides conveniences where possible, making the game look and feel easier than it is. 

This is the best looking game in the Wadjet Eye catalogue. That should be all there is to say about the graphics.

Voice acting is good, typical Wadjet Eye fare. Due to the game's aesthetics there are occasional situations where the main character sounds rather out-of-place, or the characterization is not as confident as it could be. In short it is the dissonance of having jokes or glib, cosmopolitan remarks in an abstract, largely humorless setting. But these are rare and and in any event not immersion breaking.

The music occasionally threatens to be memorable; it never is. You could remove it and it's not clear if the game would be less for it. This is certainly the game's weakest aspect. I will nevertheless give the soundtrack a separate listen but it should augment the game first and foremost.

So you see, the things that make Strangeland unique really are unique and can't be found anywhere else in this space. The meh stuff you can live without, anyway. That's why you buy it, and keep supporting Wormwood.",1621992385,1621992889,True,3,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False,False,,1621993685,"What a beautiful review.

That's a rare enough occasion, and it's even rarer to see me write a review about it. 
I simply haven't had this much fun playing a point and click in ages, and P&C is my favourite type of game, which is to say that I'm used to having *tons* of fun while playing them. 

Of course, if you're not an amateur of horror, then you won't find the same attachment to this game as I did. 
The horror elements are kept soft and ambient, with no jumpscares in the entire game at all, which is very refreshing. Yet, there were still moments I tensed up from the visuals, which didn't need to be brought up suddenly to provoke a feeling of unease. Psychological horror has always been a sweet spot for me, and this hits it just right. 

The game makes you laugh and wonder, as well as it makes you wince and apprehend. Despite a plot and narration-device that has been seen before, it makes for a unique experience that doesn't feel like a copy of anything. You can definitely feel the inspiration of works like Sanitarium (Which was brought up as an example by the creators themselves, and which is a very fitting comparison indeed!) but the game retains a very personal identity, whether it be through the artistic direction or through dialogues and storytelling. I'll add, if you liked Sanitarium I think it very very likely you will enjoy Strangeland. It definitely feels like a successor in spirit!

I want to point out two things that make the Strangeland adventure worthwhile, apart from it's good writing and mysterious storyline, and that would be the visuals and voice acting. 

Firstly, this game is gorgeous. Though very desaturated compared to my usual tastes, the artists just make it work. The painting style used for the illustrations is beautiful, and I think it really sends the point across as to how the writers envisionned their story. That is to say, it fully does everything you could ask from it. It has a strong visual identity, an attention to details, it fits the theme. I'm a hobbyist artist myself, and I feel like I will learn a lot by just looking at Strangeland's illustrations and analyzing them. 

Then, the voice acting. The protagonist has exactly the kind of voice that fits for such a role: He has something monotone to it, as many point and click protagonists do, which immediately put me in that mood of settling down in front of a good P&C like I did when I was younger. But it also has a lot of depht to it, and the actor's performance is admirable. The emotions are just subtle enough to not be an obstacle to the script, but present enough that you get a clear feeling of what the character is feeling. Thus, our protagonist rarely has to state out his emotions ; You just feel them through the voice work. Annoyance, despair, tiredness or victory. 
Apart from the main character, everyone else has interesting voices that fit their characters surprisingly well. The world is brought to life through them, and every character is recognizable from their voice alone. Point and click voice acting is often good, but not so often as good as this in my opinion. 

Strangeland feels, to me, a step above the usual quality I find in point and click games. Some may find this  glowing praise to be maybe a little much, but it is how I feel, sincerely. 

Now, bear in mind that I  am exactly the target audience of this game, being a fan of indie games, horror *and* point and clicks. If you are not all of the above, this is a good game. If you are, then Strangeland is made for you.",1621991441,1621991441,True,4,0,0.51742631196975708,0,True,False,False,False,,1621993410,"This was a really special and gratifying review to read, in particular this bit: ""The game makes you laugh and wonder, as well as it makes you wince and apprehend.""

[b]Pros / Cons:[/b]

+ The story is a very human one and there were some characters and moments that really shined. 
+ Spooky little point-and-click adventure game with some interesting puzzles
+ Genuinely unsettling experience at times; great horror atmosphere when it leaned fully dark
~ I mean this with love but the amount of literary metaphor and reference felt like it was aspiring to greater revelations than this story was actually able to tell. It fell short, which had the retroactive experience of making all of that... all seem pretentious? I could see other people enjoying it but it didn't do it for me. 
- Was left just wishing there had been more puzzle-y meat to the game but I felt I got my money's worth.
- The nu metal WYCKYD CARNIVAL aesthetic / metaphor of the early game is... honestly bizarre as hell and kind of pulled me out of the horror at times. (The Beksiński/Geiger-esque horror elements are much better executed, just wish there had been more of it.) I am still wondering if it's intentionally trying to capture an early 00's sensibility or something.",1621988529,1621988845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1621988733,"Thanks for this detailed, balanced, and ultimately generous review!

Compared to their previous game, it is shorter, the tone is more serious(no more robot sidekick telling bad jokes, although there's still some funny lines here and there, so it's not completely devoid of humor), the writing is more ""abstract""(which was to be expected since the whole game goes on within one's mind) but just as good - as are the puzzles and characters.

The subject matter is 100% meta-narrative; choosing instead to tell a story within the protagonist's psyche, and making reference to real world events that it chooses not to elaborate upon. It's an interesting approach, and a breath of fresh air for adventure game enthusiasts.

I have played Primordia a few times and I loved the humorous tone of that game. This game is more serious but it kept me just as engaged throughout albeit for different reasons.
It covers a very hard topic for a game beautifully and in a way that keeps you engaged. With the many options you get throughout the game it seems there is some good replayability and I even wanted to restart right after the credits screen.

The writing grabs the player and the puzzles where not hard at all. I got the feeling that the player truely has influence on the outcome of the story that is being told. The ending of the game resonated well with me and hopefully the game can also deliver this with other players.

In my opinion a masterpiece of a game that any adult should play and it is definitely worth it's money!

If you stuck, there's an in game hint system, calling the payphone.

I only stuck once for maybe 20 minutes at a puzzle that I knew what I had to do but I couldn't understand the solution. I just had to LISTEN instead of READ :D

This is not a carefree adventure though, nor a fairytale. This deals with heavy themes, the writing is also vague at times and I think you need to be in the right mindset to appreciate it.

First of all, don’t expect another Primordia. This game is very different because it was made from grieve, it was made not only from the heart but the very soul itself (if you want to know the inspirations for the game, just google Strangeland inspirations). It is complicated to talk about the game without spoilers, but I will try.
The game is strange, yes, bizarre, disconcerting until you keep putting all the pieces together. Puzzles are logical, you have a helping hot line so it is difficult to get stuck. Visuals are superb, the sound is outstanding and the characters… well, it is better you discover them yourself.
It’s a game that Goya would have painted if he could. It’s a game that Borges would had written if he could. It’s a game that touches you, that makes you suffer with the main character, but hey, there is no gain without pain. Don’t expect a Disney story here. 
To nitpick, I would say there are too many quotes in the game, but that’s how the author wanted to write it, so who am I to judge?
Is it a game for everybody? Probably not, as The Cat Lady or Fran Bow. But if you are not afraid of darkness, madness, you like H. R. Giger work, or just want to get on board on a trip through a strange Carnival or Theme Park, you will enjoy it as much as I did.
I strongly recommend to replay the game with annotations. You will learn a lot from a lot of things, and you will find out why the game is like it is.

The puzzles are quite simple and straight-forward and come with a comprehensive ingame hint system. They're just there for the flow basically, so if you are a die-hard puzzler, you might be disappointed, but if you're here to embrace a well-told and well-presented story, you'll like it.
What I'm not sure about are the multiple endings. In Primordia every ending brought its own ambivalence which made you question yourself whether you did the right thing. In opposite, ""good"" and ""bad"" endings are easy to identify here and they feel like they have less impact. But still, the endings aren't pure letdown, don't get me wrong - they do a good job in tying all metaphors, allusions and story bits together, which might be even more important for the kind of story we have here.

Not just that I read the beautiful Dev commentaries (a thing you should do as well, they are amazing), but also because I dove into the inspirations. I read Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury, looked at Goya's art and researched the american carnival. But nothing could prepare me for the ride to come.

No spoilers here, but when I entered Strangeland, I was blown away. Not by the graphics, because that's the only ""normal"" thing about Strangeland. You could say the look is retro-classic or something. But it is unique in it's way of combining pixelart with a black-orange-violet color palette. Still, this is not the point that makes this point-and-click so fantastic. No, I was blown away by the music, the weird organic-mechanic look of everything, the voice-over that is truly outstanding. And of course I was intrigued to find out about this strange woman falling down the well.

So I entered this weird carnival and never really left again. The story captivated me, sucked me in and threw so many mysteries at me I couldn't help but be overwhelmed. At first, some of the puzzles seemed off to me, but then I got a hold on the game's way of thinking. To a point that I stopped playing and started being the stranger in a strange land. I love every single character that I encountered. I made my way through the realms of my own consciousness and what i found was even darker than expected. Let me tell you: The more you peel off this game, the deeper you look into your own soul.

I can only recommend to play Strangeland on a summer's evening, when the sun starts to vanish behind the trees and the shades grow larger. Then you will feel as uneasy as I did when you enter the clowns mouth, and you will shiver when the phone rings. This is a masterpiece of game development, and the devs fully understood how to get to a player's mind.

A nagyszerű képi megvalósítás mellé egy metaforákkal teli, allegorikus történetet kapunk, nagyon komoly témával. Ez viszont senkit se riasszon vissza. A melankolikus cselekmény ezúttal is tanító jellegű lett, miszerint a sötétség, illetve sötét dolgok mellett mindig ott lakozik valahol a fény is, amelybe tanulva a hibáinkból, bármikor kiléphetünk. A Strangeland pontosan erre próbál megtanítani bennünket, és teszi mindezt a lehető leggördülékenyebb módon. Ha tehetitek, mindenképp adjatok neki egy esélyt.

I was honored to play it to test it with fresh eyes for bugs and ease-of-use checks in certain later sections, and I can't find the words to say how charmed and moved the game made me.
