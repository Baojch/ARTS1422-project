It was like 2010, and seven year old me was hella impatient as my dad was downloading a game for me. I've gone to arcades and played so many amazing games like Daytona USA, Street Fighter, Some really old suzuki motogp game and so on, but never in my life have I seen the possibility of playing a video game on PC (except for the already existing ones like 2D Pinball). 

That's right, this was my first step into the world of PC video games. Even though it was a demo version, I played the first level so many times. It's genuinely nostalgic for me, and I was surprised that it still exists in the steam store. 

From there on, I found out about NFS, Call of Duty, Halo and so on, and over time I've forgotten about this game. About a month ago, I was talking to my mom and she was getting rid of some tech stuff in our house, and she bought something up about my old Toshiba laptop, and that's when I remembered this game.

Platypus was the [b]first[/b] game I've played on my home computer. Let alone, it was the first run-and-gun side-scroller game I've ever played. Yeah, I had a NES back then, but I didn't meet similar games, like Life Force or Gradius. Also, if I happened to play Zero Wing on Sega Genesis, I would though Platypus was its sequel.

In my childhood, I also played it with my friends. The game has a 2-player mode. Typically, one player uses a mouse and another one uses a keyboard.

-- [b]Main description[/b] --

Platypus is a regular game when you fly over the screen and shoot enemies. You have a good variety of [u]weapons[/u] to increase your firepower. Enemies are different by appearance, scale, movement pattern, weapon and health points. After each level area, you get a score bonus by your efficiency. You can also find bonus crates, like score multiplier and extra guns.

It may not even concern you, but the game actually has a [u]story[/u]. Even though it's mentioned in its manual only (readme.rtf in the game's folder), it somewhat explains the level order. 

-- [b]Music and Sound effects[/b] --

This aspect deserves its own paragraph. Music sounds great, drivy and beautiful. Most important, it was carefully selected for each level or level sequence. If you play non-stop, it even emphasizes several moments, like a special crowd of enemies comes at you. Maybe, it's a coincidence that music bits match the condition on the screen, who knows.
The only [u]downside[/u] is, the music continues playing after you pause the game and the action goes out of tact.

Sound effects are simple yet matching the action, appealing to your ears. Sure, some of them are taken from other games, like the explosion of small enemies is a pistol gunfire sound from Doom, but to me it doesn't spoil anything. Even modern games sometimes do that.

-- [b]Background and Graphics[/b] --

Another creative aspect of the game. Not only does it look beautiful, it also tries to interact with the player, give him/her useful information of what to be ready for. There's a blimp with big screen that shows messages to you. Sometimes, background shows the enemies you will face soon.
I like Volcano area!

It's hard to believe all these graphical assets were made of clay, digitized and put into the game. I used to work with clay myself and let me tell you, Antony has made a giant work! The appearance is unique here!

-- [b]Flaws[/b] --

Every game has flaws and failures. Let's observe them here.

1. [b]Difficulty[/b]. The game has 3 difficulties. Easy matches the altitude for sure. The game even provides additional supplies for you. 
On the other hand, [b]Normal[/b] creates a giant gap in gameplay by a creative decision to [u]withdraw your weapon upon death[/u], which makes you feel increased enemy speed, intensity and shooting probabilities even harder.
Amid this, Hard doesn't feel much harder. Only enemies shoot more often and bosses have extended attack patterns.

2. [b]Mouse sensitivity[/b]. The game has only mandatory settings - difficulty and control schemes for 2 players. When you play the game, you don't have much room to control the speed of your aircraft to move across the screen. In fact, it moves slower if you move your mouse fast. 

-- [b]Anyway[/b] --

My final grade is [b]7,5/10[/b]. Good game, I enjoyed it.

Platypus 1 cos'è? Un fottuto capolavoro in clay animation (animato a plastilina).
I livelli sono ben realizzati, le astronavi nemiche sono bellissime i poteri sono gli stessi e i boss anche.
Cosa cambia? Cambia che sul primo abbiamo una colonna sonora da salagiochi che spinge così tanto che la canticchi pure la notte mentre dormi. Una grafica così perfetta che sembra veramente di giocare col pongo. Musiche in fase boss. 
Ma soprattutto, la parte più eccitante.
Ogni livello è arduo già in difficoltà normale. Distruggere tutte le navi in ogni sezione è tosta, ma nulla dà più soddisfazione nel veder montare il punteggio con bonus del 100% che si modella in plastilina punti. La ricerca del perfect score restituisce sensazioni da bagnarsi le mutande. Toccare quella soglia e veder scoppiare la vita extra è meglio del sesso.
Così come lo è riuscire a mantenere il potenziamento senza morire. Sommandolo con altri potenziamenti si avrà il potere degli dei, e le armi giuste per uccidere tutti quei nemici che per il cannone normale sono palesemente troppi.
Non è un errore. E' la ricerca della perfezione. Perdere 60 secondi di Stella equivale a 1 minuto di bestemmie con conseguente perdita del 100% e riavvio istantaneo. Accumulare secondi è tutto. Arrivare al prossimo livello con ancora la stella attiva. Goduria. Livello di difficoltà folle proseguendo, ancor peggio senza stella eppure è una divinità questo gioco. Una vera perla nerd arcade da duri e puri.
BENE, ORA IN PLATYPUS 2 TUTTO QUESTO NON SI PROVA.
Platypus 2 è Platypus 1 capovolto e rifatto coi piedi.
Il controllo col mouse prima reattivo e scattante ora è lento come il culo.
I palloncini, prima RARISSIMI da far venire il sudore per ottenere i cannoni laterali e il x2, ora ti vengono buttati in faccia ogni 3 secondi già dal primo livello.
Se muori non perdi la stella e il cannone va via dopo 2 morti. Cosa che ti fa dire. Eccheccazzomefrega allora.
Animazioni, grafica e stile peggiorati. Se arrivate dal primo, con il 2 vi sembrerà di essere tornati indietro al capitolo 0 che non esiste. 
Non paragonate il 2 al primo, non compratelo proprio.

Also if you want to have fun and relax a little bit there's cheat codes for super auto fire etc look them up in the community forum guides.

So when it comes down to it, it's cheap, you'll probably be able to get it to work using the above info and it's a fun quirky oddball game. Recommended.

ในวัยเด็กผมก็ผ่านเกมอินดี้มาเยอะมากเนื่องจากเป็นสายเล่นเกมแนวเล็กๆแบบนี้อยู่แล้ว Platypus เกมยิงยานอวกาศที่เกิดตั้งแต่ปี 2002 และผมได้เล่นตอนกี่ขวบก็จำไม่ได้ด้วยซ้ำ จำได้แค่ว่าเกมนี้มันเคยมาแบบรวมแพ็คเกมอะไรซักอย่าง แถมเมื่อก่อนก็ติดนิสัยโหลดเถื่อนซะด้วย ณ ปัจจุบัน ก็พยายามจะไถ่บาปในวัยเด็กให้หมด ขณะที่ลองหาเกมอินดี้ๆเล่น ก็พึ่งเห็นว่า ""เห้ย เกมนี้มีขายบน Steam ด้วยอ่อวะ"" ราคาแค่ 85 บาท เลยต้องจัดซักหน่อยเพื่อรำลึกความมันส์ในวัยเด็กอีกครั้ง ก็อยากระบายเรื่องเกมนี้ซักหน่อยและกัน

[h1]รูปแบบการเล่น : ก็ใช้เม้าส์ขยับไปมากับกดยิงอะแหละ ออ เล่นสองคนในเครื่องเดียวได้นะ[/h1]
เกมเกือบ 20 ปีแล้วแถมก็ไม่ใช่ค่ายยักษ์อะไร เกมมันก็ไม่มีอะไรมากหรอก ใช้เม้าส์ขยับเพื่อหลบยานที่ยิงทั้งกระสุน จรวด หรือเลเซอร์ และก็คลิกยิงให้มันร่วงให้หมด เพื่อความสนุก เกมก็มีพลังพิเศษที่จะติดมากับยานฝูงชนิดพิเศษถึง 4 อัน - ยิงแฉก 4, ยิงเร็วปานฟ้าแลบ , พลังคลื่นเขียวโค้งและจรวดแดงชวนหูระเบิด (แม่งดังชิบหาย) จริงๆมันมีอันที่ 5 เป็นเลเซอร์ทะลุแถวที่อยู่ด่านสุดท้ายอีก ศัตรูก็มากหน้าหลายตาพร้อมการโจมตีที่ขยันใส่กูซะเหลือเกิน ยิ่งถ้าโหมดยากนี่กะให้กูหลบไม่ได้เลยรึไง ออ มันเล่นสองคนได้ด้วย คนนึงใช้เม้าส์ อีกคนใช้ปุ่มลูกศรกะ enter ยิง รับรอง..ทะเลาะกันคาหน้าจอแน่

[h1]การนำเสนอ : เป็นเกมที่ถ้าเล่นทีเดียว 1 ชั่วโมงก็จบและโคตรเร็ว[/h1]
ทั้งเกมมีทั้งหมด 4 ด่าน, 1 ด่าน จะมี 5 wave โดยช่วงที่ 5 ของทุกด่านจะเป็นการตบ Boss ของด่านนั้นแต่บาง wave ของบางด่านก็มีลูกเล่นแพรวพราว เอาง่ายๆก็ [b]กวนตีน[/b] เช่น ระเบิดลูกตุ้มระเบิดติดลูกโป่งลอยทั้งฉากหรือภูเขาไฟที่ระเบิดแถมเป็นหินที่หล่นใส่ แต่ทั้งด่านจะไม่ยาวมากเฉลี่ย 12-15 นาทีก็จบได้เพราะงั้นจบเกมภายในชั่วโมงเดียวได้เลย แอบอยากให้มีอีกซักด่านนึงเพิ่มหน่อยรู้สึกว่ามันน้อยไปนิด

[h1]ชอบเป็นพิเศษ : งานด้านภาพและเพลงประกอบ แหม่ เกมนี้ทำโคตรดี[/h1]
เอกลักษณ์อย่างนึงที่กลายเป็นที่จดจำของเกมนี้โดยเฉพาะ คือ ภาพที่ใช้เป็นแบบดินน้ำมันมี่ใช้มันทั้งเกมซึ่งมันดูเก๋มากเลยในยุคนั้นและน่าจะเป็นสิ่งที่หลายคนจำเกมนี้ก็เพราะภาพเนี่ยแหละ อีกอย่างเพลงประกอบเกมนี้โคตรดี ส่วนตัวชอบหลายเพลงมาก ทุกด่านใช้เพลงไม่ซ้ำแม้กระทั่งตอนสู้กะบอสก็มีเพลงประจำตัวอีก ซึ่งโทนของเพลงมันเข้ากะตัวเกมมาก ทำให้เวลายิงรู้สึกมันส์ขึ้นไปอีก

[h1]ข้อเสีย : ตั้งค่า? หึ เกมนี้ไม่มี[/h1]
ก็สงสัยตั้งแต่เด็กว่าเกมนี้ทำไมไม่มีการตั้งค่ารึไง เพราะเพลงเกมนี้โคตรดังที่มันตั้งปกติไว้ให้ แล้วเราก็ปรับอะไรไม่ได้เลยเพราะไม่มี Option ซักอย่าง เออ ก็แปลกดีเว้ย มีแต่ปรับยากง่าย กะวิธีการเล่นสองคน

[h1]ถ้ามองข้อเท็จจริง ให้ 8/10 แต่เพราะมันคือเกมในความทรงจำของผมเพราะงั้นกูลำเอียงให้มึง 10/10 ไปเลย![/h1]
เกมเก่ามันก็มีจุดด้อยจุดแปลกๆกันบ้างแถมเล่นแปปเดียวก็จบ แต่มันคือเกมวัยเด็กอะ ความทรงจำและคิดถึงมากลบข้อเสียได้หมดเลย 85 บาทคุ้มเสมอสำหรับเกมนี้เผื่อเบื่ออาจจะแวะมายิงขำๆบ้างและกัน ยังไงมันก็ 1 ในเกมดวงใจของผมตั้งแต่เด็ก ดีใจที่มันยังมีตัวตนและได้ขายบนสตีม เยี่ยมจริงๆ...",1635867763,1635867919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Graphics
- Audio
- 5 temporary weapons
- Good'ol highscores!
- Second player can steal credits like lifes in Contra

De son trailer, il a tout d'un très bon jeu MAIS, car il y'a un mais, le reste laisse clairement à désirer.

La maniabilité du vaisseau est d'une lenteur et quelque peu hasardeux et les vagues d'ennemis sont bien trop nombreuses ce qui est par moment compliqué pour les esquiver. On ne distingue pas les tires de nos ennemis et je me suis même parfois demandé pourquoi je suis mort ce qui donne, du coup, de grosse session de frustration. 

Heureusement, des pouvoirs sont disponibles et seront d'une aide pour avancer mais ayez le malheur de les perdre et la mort vous attend au loin. Heureusement que le jeu est généreux en vies et en crédits ! j'ai eu également, durant toute ma session, des freezes incessant comme s'il chargeait la suite des niveaux au fur et a mesure ce qui n'aide VRAIMENT PAS et quand à la musique, je me suis cru revenir dans les années ""Dance Machine"".

As someone who really likes shoot 'em ups, this isn't one of the best horizontal shoot 'em up I've ever played, and there are others I'd rather be playing. But it's good. The speed is fast, it's mostly fair, there's a good amount of variety, and although it leans easy, it's still challenging. 

On the downside I would've liked more enemey and weapon variety, and although the game is mostly fair, it's not devoid of cheapness. Enemies frequently come from behind, so you have to leave space at the left edge of the screen. It also falls into the trap of making the game more challenging to deal with overpowered powerups, and then punishing the player when they die at the wrong time and come back with just the base gun. Dying at the worst times can not only lose you the powerups you've already accumulated, but also make you miss out on all the powerups the game expects you to be picking up just then to get through the level.

All in all for a shoot 'em up developed by a single person, it's very well done, and better than a lot of shoot 'em ups that have been developed by companies known for developing shoot 'em ups. Even if you don't take into account this is a one man effort, this is still an above average shoot 'em up.

Wir müssen die Einwohner von Mungola vor den Collosatropolianern beschützen...
Es gibt Geschichten, die - wie schon bei ""Nux"" vom selben Entwickler - nicht hätten erzählt werden müssen.

Denn es geht nur ums plattballern und das sogar potentiell im lokalen Multiplayer. Wir fliegen die F27 ""Platypus"", einen fiktiven Gleiter, der so gar nicht aussieht wie ein Schnabeltier. Anscheinend heißt das Fluggerät und damit das Spiel nur so, weil es irgendwie lustig klingt. 

Die Gegner kommen genretypisch meist in Wellenmustern. Hin und wieder gibt es temporäre Power-Ups wie Raketen oder schnelles Feuer. Einige zerschrotete Feinde lassen Obst fallen, das unserem Score zugute kommt.

Die Welten sind in Abschnitten eingeteilt. Diese sind optisch zwar leicht verschieden, gameplaytechnisch allerdings recht ähnlich, auch wenn hin und wieder ganz witzig designte Bossgegner auf Einen warten. Der Umfang bleibt aber ebenso wie die Abwechslung recht überschaubar.

Das Handling ist in Ordnung, könnte aber noch direkter sein. Gut nur, daß das Tempo des Spiels für das Genre insgesamt recht gemächlich ist, so daß man recht souverän zu agieren vermag.

Über Geschmack läßt sich bekanntlich nicht streiten. Die Knet-Optik ist sicherlich nicht jedermanns Sache, meine auch nicht, dennoch kann man dem Welten- und Gegnerdesign eine gewisse Kreativität nicht absprechen. Immerhin ist die Auflösung (im Gegensatz zu ""Nux"") trotz des Alters des Spieles recht angenehm hoch. Die Musik wechselt zwar von Welt zu Welt, bleibt aber stets anstrengend. Die sehr simplen Soundeffekte passen zum Setting.

Ein Shooter mit besonderer Optik also, unter dessen Haube sich allerdings ein reichlich generischer Vertreter des Genres findet. Eigentlich könnte man da durchaus sagen, es reicht gerade so zu einer Empfehlung. Das Problem ist nur, das Game ist kaum bis gar nicht zum Laufen zu kriegen. Das mag auf meinem Rechner ein besonderes Problem sein, wobei ich es allerdings auf einer anderen Maschine auch nicht zum Laufen gebracht habe. Ein ganz netter Shooter, der kaum startet und ständig abstürzt ist vor allem ein Shooter, der ständig abstürzt. Insofern kann ich keine Empfehlung geben.

Nux is fantastically quirky, and Platypus does not disappoint. Although there is only one method of play in this one (side-scrolling shooter,) it's varied enough that it does not lose its appeal as you play. The bonus items for weapon upgrades are nicely varied, the game tracks your score percentages per section, and some of the bigger ships that you destroy will drop bonus points... in the form of FRUIT that you need to collect before they fall off of the screen. lol~

You start off with four lives, and two credits. When you lose your four lives, you can continue by using one of your credits, which gives you four lives again... Of course your score resets when you continue, but the game will save the highest score you gain for the leaderboard.

It also looks like a second person can join in and play with you, as there was something on the screen that said to press a button to join.

Platypus doesn't seem to be controller-compatible, but using the mouse to play gives you plenty of maneuverability. There's no click-click-click, either; just hold down the left mouse button to shoot continuously.

There are weather balloons that float across the background giving you hints such as, ""Shoot the stars to change weapons,"" and ""Special bonus for passive resistance!"" Hah! Try not shooting anything and live through it, I dare you! If you die even once, it ruins your ""passive resistance"" because you'll usually take something out with you, and you'll get NO bonus. ;D

There is a pretty good amount of enemy variations.  There are five types of weapons which are acquired through collecting coloured stars: Yellow, blue, green, red and the turquoise.  Yellow is wide fire allows you to shoot diagonally; blue one fires quicker; green one spreads sonic waves; red one throws rockets; and the turquoise one which I believe appears only in the last chapter electrocutes. The key to success is of course power-ups. Most important one is the circular fire power-up which is obtained through blowing up baloons and collecting the boxes they carry.

At least most of the time. Nothing can give you a relaxing time like a sidescrolling shooter, and at the same time offer you some suspense. Platypus with it's claymation artsy style is no difference to this, simple game mechanics, and some minutes later you forget about the bad game that rusts in your library...

Scramble, and to some extend Defender were some of the games I played in the arcade, or - if I had to look for my father in his favorite hangout... Well, anyway, this game is nice to play, and highscores are easily achievable. This game is around for such a long time, and yet hasn't lost anything of it's vibe and freshness.

It has a 4:3 aspect ratio and an old school vibe to it and it's pretty normal because it was launched back in 2002. 

The gameplay is solid and it's very enjoyable. If you enjoyed playing Raptor: Call of the Shadows (1994) you'll have a blast with this one (pun intended). 

The game is addictive and you'll want to best yourself with each run. There are sections where the game is quite hard even on Easy difficulty and it requires skill to go through with it. You have plenty of things to enjoy like various aricrafts to shoot, boss fights, power-ups, multiple credits (aka retries) and if you gather enough points you can get bonus lives or even credits. You also get a ""Hall of fame"" where you can add your score when the game is over.

Even if you fail a mission and it's game over, you can restart the level and you won't have to replay the whole game again, just the missions from the same level. You cannot save the game but once you unlock a level you can start from it and skip the previous levels.

The style is wonderful and there are many subtleties that are implemented in such an old game. The gameplay is smooth and I strongly recommend playing with the mouse for a smoother experience.

You can play the same game in co-op by having another player help you defeat the hordes of enemies. Yes, they managed to implement co-op while some modern games failed to do so, which is pretty remarkable. 

It's a pretty complete experience and the game is highly worth its price.

All in all this is a strongly recommended game for anyone regardless of their age.",1541728169,1541745862,True,2,0,0.550172984600067139,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I only really have 2 complaints:

1) Would it have killed the devs to put a ""settings"" option when you start the game? I had to mess about for ages to do simple stuff like make the game windowed or change the resolution. Seems senseless to not include it.

2) The game is pretty short for the price honestly. It's basically only a few levels and that's it. I get that this is an arcade game so the point is to replay it for a highscore, but regardless, a little more content would have been nice. 

I would give it an A+ if both those things were different, cause the game is cute and fun otherwise.

This charming shmup from 2002 is definitely a recommendation from me.

Pros:
- Addictive beyond belief.
- Challenging (except for one part which will be bought up later) but not too hard.
- Presentation is through the roof with this one! The claymation graphics really give this game character.
- Fun weapons, from a spread weapon like Contra to rockets, the list may be short, but the variety makes it good enough.
- The music is stellar, especially in ""Level 1"" and ""Baddie Tune 2""

Cons:
- It's a little short (I really don't mind this but for people who do crave for a long-winded experience will not find it here)
- Bosses are a little underwhelming (except for the third one)
- The mines in level 2 are very annoying, especially in a part where there are a lot of them are on screen. To me it's a huge difficulty spike after an otherwise easy level, the rest of the game doesn't get that hard though albeit a few difficult parts. But it could be my low skill level.

Overall:
Despite a few flaws and one very annoying part of the game, it's still a great game that anyone should play, you can buy a demo online if you want to try it out.

This is what I called as arcade games gone right.

I remember back those days when this game had been launched (in my country). Zuma and Plants vs Zombies are real big titles (my favorite too), but I couldn't ignore the attractiveness of this simple game. The clay design is so cute and refreshing. Also the difficulty is very enjoyable and addictive.
Can't say no more, just grab it fast! Very recommended!

Overall very satisfied by purchased this game. No regret at all.
But deeply regret(s), because I bought Platypus Mega Pack Bundle. I don't wanna spam the beautiful review above with this trash information, so better You check my review about Platypus II and Nux through my profile.

Горизонтальный скролл шутер в пластилиновом мире. Нам предстоит отправиться в путешествия на пяти длинных уровнях в конце каждого из которых нас будет ожидать коварный босс.

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
¥ Пластилиновый мир (особенно красиво выглядит постоянно меняющийся задний фон).
¥ Есть возможность играть одновременно втроем на одном компьютере.
¥ Длинные уровни состоящие разделенные на несколько этапов.
¥ Есть возможность начинать игру с уже пройденных уровней.
¥ Нет никакого текста (кроме меню), что значит игра очень дружелюбна для русскоязычных пользователей.

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
¥ Маленькое разрешение экрана, которое невозможно поменять.
¥ Унылая музыка, которую нет возможности отключить.
¥ Выбор сложности отличается только количеством необходимых попаданий по нашему кораблю для смерти.
¥ Нет достижений.
¥ Доска с количеством очков не интегрирована к стиму.
¥ Не работает оверлей стима (скриншоты не поснимаешь).

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Так получилось, что данную часть я прошел последней и мне пришлось просто скопировать обзор со второй части и вставить сюда, удалив одно предложение... Обе части почти одинаковы, только тут имхо немного сложнее и боссы поопаснее. Все также не рекомендую и из тройки пластелинновых проектов разработчика понравилась только ""Nux"".

I scrounge through the plastic bags only to find a ""100 games in a one"" disc in that generic plastic sleeve that looks to be designed with word 2008. God knows from what cyberpunk pirating underground she gets these dodgy discs which are probably chinese botnet builders but I neverthless reluctantly try it.

  And on my mum's excuse of a laptop, amidst the plebian trash of bejeweled and diner dash, I find this gem of a game. My steam playtime does not do this game justice. This game was one of the basic tenants of my childhood.

[h1] Pros	[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Fun arcade like shooter with varied game play such as the passive resistance bonus (not shooting anything for a whole level)
    [*]Cheap
    [*]Catchy Soundtrack
    [*]Nice claymation graphics
    [*]Can play 2 player on the same computer
    [*]Has Steam Trading Cards
    [*]Has a sequel (Called Platypus 2)
[/list]

[h1] Cons	[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Controller compatibility is not guaranteed. It works with my xbox 360 controller but I've heard thats not the case with others.
    [*]Minefields. Although I consider them a fun obstacle, some consider them to be broken.
    [*]This game is not really for serious gamers. The high score is grindable and replayability in terms of score can be a bit tedious since the leaderboard is useless. But if you've scrolled this far thinking otherwise, I don't know what you were expecting.
[/list]

[h1] All in All	[/h1]
  The game is a classic side scrolling ship shooter that's fun to play with a friend. It's not too simple that it is repetitive but it's easy enough that anyone can just pick it up and play. Most people have it for the nostalgic value of this old game so I suggest you make some memories of your own!",1502111670,1505883819,True,6,0,0.583997786045074463,1,False,False,False,False,,,

(I'm guessing that they are alien spaceships, but they could just be from a futuristic Earth civilisation. Who knows? Not me, that's for sure.)

The game mechanics are not very much different from a wide range of similar games, but the claymation style gives it a sort of cuteness which is easy on the eye, being somewhat visually amusing.

Whilst the game is simple in its concept, it gets harder as you level up.
When you blow up some bigger enemy vessels you can collect the large stars they leave behind, which will give you better weapons.
Or they might drop fruit (bananas, cherries, etc.), which you can collect for bonus points.

In the higher levels you have to fight harder enemies: huge motherships, fixed gun emplacements, train-mounted guns, and more.
Whilst you can fly right down to the ground and take no damage by doing so, you might be in for a surprise in a later level when you crash into a ground-level fuel tank.
So, be careful with what you're doing.

Platypus is not a spectacular game, but it's a bit of fun.
With its claymation style, I imagine that it could be quite a good game for children.

1.共有4个Level，每个Level又有5个area，共20关

2.难度绝对不低，判定范围非常大，基本上就是整机的面积，包括高度和长度
虽然第一关看上去敌人很少，也没啥弹幕
但你玩着玩着就发现，后面的敌人越来越多，血厚的敌人也是，而且还会一下子出来好几个
而且敌人的攻击大多数都是瞄着你发出去的，所以只要敌人射击了你就一定需要移动
3.你的攻击伤害随着游戏进度完全没有变化
虽然你能依靠一些掉落道具增强飞机，但只要死了就会恢复最初的状态
掉落物有2种，一种是消灭敌人后的星星，攻击它会变换颜色，对应好几种攻击武器样式
另一种是中期才会出现的、帮着气球的箱子，你需要先把箱子打碎而不打破气球，然后会掉落奖励
4.游戏支持本地双人，可以设置用键盘、鼠标、手柄控制
但只用了鼠标和键盘，感觉鼠标控制很坑，向上向下移动会有一种很卡的感觉，尤其向下

4 Stages, 5 areas each. Gain score for a life, pass a stage for a credit (continue).
There is no screen sweeper, and you cannot touch enemies. Co-op shares credit, btw.

My rating: roughly 4/10

[b]Reasons of playing:[/b]
-    Seeing that I used to play this and it is now lost, bought this on sale.

[b]My experience:[/b]
-    Cleared the whole game on hard, continued a few times but I'm done with the game.
-    Reminds me how Shooter and Bullet hell are different genres.
-    I like Autogun. Bullet hell games influence.

[b]What I like:[/b]
-    Art: musics, graphics, sounds, atmosphere.
-    Increase point item value by shooting it.
-    Special weapons can be kept on screen when there's no need to collect right away.

[b]What I don't like:[/b]
-    Manual firing is much stronger than auto firing. Imagine rockets fired at machinegun rate.
-    Difficulty. This is not about the game being too hard or easy, but somehow stage 2 seems to be the hardest and stage 3 the second, With all the blending background and hard-to-detect mini bullets.
-    Enemies come from behind without sign. No problem for me, but this is a casual game.
-    Stages don't end with just last enemy or boss defeated, but also a set amount of time passed. Such a waste of special weapons.
-    You can select any stage to start after you've beaten it once. Meaning you can skip harder stages and still finish the game.
-    Final score is affected by current score, credits left and not lives left.
-    Past stages are replayable. -> Credits are grindable. -> Score are grindable
-    Leaderboard. There is no need for it, seriously. Difficulty gives no bonus and they all share one leaderboard and score is grindable. The game is not that competitive, so this board is just a decoration.

Review by: [url=steamcommunity.com/id/dehu92]DEHU[/url]

[h1]Pros :[/h1]
- pretty simple
- controller support
- good amount of powerups

[h1]Cons :[/h1]
- a bit too short

[h1]Review :[/h1]
Platypus is a horizontal shooter.

There is no real story, but it's pretty good.

You have powerups like; Machine gun, Rockets, Spread fire, ect.

The art style is pretty simple and good, reminds me of a old Windows 95 game, and the game is pretty fluent.

There is not much to say, but it's a pretty good game and i will recommend it

Only good things are the claylike visuals and the soundtrack consisting of remixes of old chiptunes.

The gameplay choises made in this game are just baffling, for example. 

- Enemy bullets blend in with your own, the background and objects in the foreground just hide them and enemies altogether.
- Enemy patterns are awful and can even blindside you without any indication.
- Powerups are timed and can only be gotten from shooting down special groups of enemies that are sometimes placed so that you need to know where and when they will emerge to have the slightest chance of getting them. Without the powerups many places in the game are almost impossible to get through. 
- Using same sprites for enemies in the background, foreground and the playarea is just a horrible idea and this will come apparent on the minefield on the second world.

Nux is fantastically quirky, and Platypus does not disappoint.  Although there is only one method of play in this one (side-scrolling shooter,) it's varied enough that it does not lose its appeal as you play.  The bonus items for weapon upgrades are nicely varied, the game tracks your score percentages per section, and some of the bigger ships that you destroy will drop bonus points... in the form of FRUIT that you need to collect before they fall off of the screen. lol~

You start off with four lives, and two credits.  When you lose your four lives, you can continue by using one of your credits, which gives you four lives again... Of course your score resets when you continue, but the game will save the highest score you gain for the leaderboard.

It also looks like a second person can join in and play with you, as there was something on the screen that said to press a button to join.

Platypus doesn't seem to be controller-compatible, but using the mouse to play gives you plenty of maneuverability.  There's no click-click-click, either; just hold down the left mouse button to shoot continuously.

There are weather balloons that float across the background giving you hints such as, ""Shoot the stars to change weapons,"" and ""Special bonus for passive resistance!""  Hah!  Try not shooting anything and live through it, I dare you!  If you die even once, it ruins your ""passive resistance"" because you'll usually take something out with you, and you'll get NO bonus. ;D

This game has some nostalgia for me. Played this game as a kid and thoroughly enjoyed it.

   Options: Nothing much to do with this. Sound and music have an on and off button, no scroll bar or something to make it better. The game itself is really loud, so I have to turn it down in the windows sound panel to play this game at comfortable levels of hearing. There is a 2 player option! Either player can use a keyboard, mouse, or joystick. All you have to do it click through it to find your preference. Game pad is not an option, sorry peasants.

   Gameplay: You pilot an easily destructible aerial vehicle in a horizontal scrolling game filled with bad guys of various types that you need to destroy. You actually get freedom of choice, if you choose a ""non-violent resistance"" as the game hints at you in the first level in the back ground, you will get a bonus. But, I've found this to be somewhat difficult, so I don't do it.

   You can die very easily in this game, if you are hit once, you are dead. And you respawn with however many lives you have left. So, if you're into that sort of thing. There you go. You also get rewarded with lives as you earn a certain amount of points.

   There are 4 different types of weapons. These will be dropped from the orange colored enemy's. you have to kill all of them for them to drop a star. There's the default weapon which fires slowly, but works fine and you can defend yourself easily with it, at least in the first levels. As you advance on, the enemy's get more difficult. The second is a 4 shot spread. The third is a very fast rapid fire of your default weapon. My I highly recommend using this whenever possible. It's fast, and it kills fast. Which is what you need. The fourth is this weird wave type weapon. It's like your shooting a right bracket at the enemy that goes only the length of Justin Bieber's dick in front of your craft before it magically disappears. I do not recommend using this. The fourth and final weapon is... red rockets. These are cool, but I don't use them. They take their sweet time to exit your craft and launch off into the enemy's direction. And these aren't heat seeking or anything amazing like that. They just fly straight.

   Graphics: Everything is in clay-mation. And I got to say, they did a darn good job. I really like the art style. Mainly because I was raised with it. Movies like Wallace and Gromit really helped with that. Other than that, there is a rolling background as you continue flying to your destination, which as it shows in the world selection screen is a big boss at the very end.

I've never beat the game unfortunately, but it is a lot of fun if you want something for fun just to play.",1433235978,1433235978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It really reminds me of the neverhood in that there's abstract shapes and everything is not super smooth. 5 weapon icons, including a 4 way shot. (Weak but can hit multiple enemies at once), rapid fire shot (my favorite. Doesn't have a scatter effect but does take down enemies quick), a wave (can hit multiple enemies at once but kinda weak.) a rocket (much better if you have the sidearms too. They scatter and it can be tough to hit enemies), and a laser. (Also passes through enemies. Pretty strong, but rare.) You can pick up two sidearms to triple your firing power of whatever weapon you have active, and there's a 2x score multiplier. You get additional ships fairly easily in game, but it's one hit and you're destroyed. This is not a bullethell shooter, and even if you've played games like tyrian 2000, you'll probably find this one on the fairly easy side. 

Pros:
1: Very cool artstyle.
2: I like some of the effects. Level 1 has a long train boss for you to destroy. Level 3 has a volcano that rains rocks and coins. Level 4 is a polluted city.
3: The music. I can identify the level 1 music as a commodore 64 remix of Comic Bakery with a splash of Jurassic Park NES level 1 music.
4: Picking up same colored powerup icons extends the time you can use the weapon.

Cons:
1: When you die if you have anything special like the sidearms, you lose them. This can make things like the bosses challenging when you're given sidearms and rockets to shoot the boss with.
2: No real upgrade system to speak of, or even a in game shop of any kind. Once the time runs out, you lose your special weapon

Pro:
Cheap
Easy to learn

Con:
Power ups seem very limited and last very short durations
There is no leveling up, weapon changes or any progression of your ship other then the 30 second powerups
Playing single player it is very likely impossible to get 100% kill count (Maybe someone better then I can), but it will score you based on that goal.
Even only playing through level two, the enemies already were being recycled and just different colors and sizes.
The game isn't smooth.  There is no reason for a game from 2002 not to run perfectly smooth on a modern PC.

特筆すべきは、キャラクター・背景が粘土細工で作られていること。・・・だけ。

ゲーム自体は単調でメリハリが無い。爽快感も無い。
ステージは５つ。最後にはボスキャラが登場する。またステージはいくつかのエリアに分かれおり、エリア終了時に撃墜率が算出され、ボーナス点が得られる（が、固い敵が多いので、１００点は小学１年生のとき取った以来で年々成績が下がっていくようなものである）
特定の敵を倒すと、パワーアップ（ウエポンチェンジ）、ボーナス得点アイテムが出る。
パワーアップは、ワイドショット、連射、ホーミング等が時間制限で使えるようになる。同じアイテムを重ねて取ると使用時間が延びるだけで、どんどんパワーアップしていくというわけではない。カプコンの19シリーズみたいな感じ。
得点アイテムはそのまま取っても良いが、撃つと分裂しさらに高得点を得ることが出来る。（が、そこまでして点数稼ぎをしてもショウガナイという気持ちの方が大きく働く）

せめて実績に対応していればやり込めるのだが、デモ版（出てないけど）だけでお腹がいっぱいになる内容。

[h1]How I Found Out About ""Platypus""[/h1]
Oh...this goes way back! Years and years ago. When I was very young, didn't know about things like Steam, or retail PC games, I was always playing Flash games online. One site that I would play on all the time, had a little game called ""Platypus"". This was one of those games you came across that you had to download a free trial that only lasted an hour or so. Of course, I did. I believe the free trial only contained the first level of the game.

I loved the game so much. Over about four or five years later, I went on a search to see if I could find the game's main website (Because Steam didn't have the game at the time). I found something similar to it, the game was around $2-$5. I didn't trust the site, so I did not purchase the game. Now, just last night, I noticed ""Platypus"" in my recommended on Steam, so I HAD to buy it. Boy, was it a blast to the past, and a nice thing to see Level 2-5, levels I have never seen before.

[h1]Unfair First Impressions[/h1] 
I tend to see a lot of hate for [b]score attack[/b] & [b]shoot 'em up[/b] games. I don't mind these kind of games as long as they are fun for me. ""Platypus"" takes both these genre'. I also see hate for [b]side scrolling shooters[/b] which ""Platypus"" is also. 

Therefor, you may here people say bad things about these genre' or about ""Platypus"" itself. Some people will say that about the genre and not even try the game itself. This can rub off on other people, causing them to do the same thing. Then that can rub off, and keep going like a virus. 

[h1]Review Of ""Platypus""[/h1]
""Platypus"" is a [b]side scrolling[/b] [b]shoot 'em up/score attack[/b] game. It uses a rare unique graphic style. It uses [b]claymation[/b] which means everything you see in-game is made of modeling clay to add a unique design. 

There are five total levels with about four or five areas in each. In each of these levels you will find a wide variety of enemy types & power ups. 

Though the game itself isn't really the 'best' as it is quite old, and it seems that the dev. is no longer supporting it, the game still runs smooth. There are no resolution options, nor is there any audio options other than ""Turn Music On/Off"". The Steam overlay also does not work while the game is running. 

However, the challenge in the game is there. It will get harder as you go along. Anything can destroy your ship, enemy fire, coliding with enemies, etc. When the screen gets really full, you'll find it harder to survive. The challenge isn't to much, that I feel over whelmed. It's a really nice fit. 

The game also includes a 2-player option. Player 1 (Yellow ship) plays default with the ""mouse"", but a second player (Red ship) can join in under the controls of a ""joy"" or ""keys"" (Arrows to move, control to shoot). Player 1 can also use the different control settings, but both players can not use the same control setup. What's also neat is if you don't have anyone to play the game with, you can spawn in Player 2 and use it yourself, along with your main ship. This is difficult to master, but will help out along the way. Still better to have someone to play with though.

[h1]Content (Enemies & Power Ups)[/h1]
""Platypus"" contains loads of enemy types, some generic, some unique. The game also includes a few different [b]power ups[/b] to defend yourself. 

In ""Platypus"" you can come across enemy ships that fly in an ""up and down"" maneuver, fly straight from left to right, right to left, pull up or go down, etc. Not only that, as the levels go on, you'll notice a lot of the ships to start shooting at you. Now the weapons fired at you could consist of, a single shot in your direction, a fast shot that moves one direction, or other things like ""rockets"" that follow you. 

To defend youself, you have a few different weapon types. I'll only name a few to avoid spoiling too much. You have your main [b]cannons[/b] which are default, and have a slow fire rate. Then you have things like the traditional [b]cannon spread[/b] and [b]cannon fire rate increased[/b] upgrades. 

Along with weapon types, you also have sort of.....pick ups. That can be dropped from enemies, or crates. These consist of fruit, like grapes, and bananas, which give you score points when picked up. Inside things like crates, you can find items like [b]x2 score[/b] which will double your score income, and [b]coins[/b] which give off a lot of score. 

[h1]Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)[/h1]
""Platypus"" is a very fun side scrolling score attack shooter. That is easy to play, and very addictive. Despite it's problems, this game is a cheap purchase that anyone can enjoy for hours. Especially with a friend. 

Pro's:
+Unique claymation graphic style.
+Fun & challenging five level experience.
+2-player available.
+Catchy soundtrack that is full of nostalgia.

Con's:
-No resolution option.
-No custom sound options.
-Steam overlay currently does not work (Though this does not degrade the final rating of the game).

Overall rating: About a 13/15 (Fun Experience For The Whole Family)

Verdikt: Platypus je veselá a zábavná old school arkáda. Najlepšie je hrať túto hru v dvojici, pretože vtedy má tú najlepšiu atmosféru, ktorú dopĺňa podarený soundtrack. Pozitívom hry je jej dizajn a výtvarnosť. Jednotlivé lokácie pôsobia sviežo a doslova sú vymodelované z plastelíny. Na druhú stranu mohlo byť technické spracovanie lepšie. Miestami je hra nepriehľadná s čím súvisí obtiažnosť, pre ktorú je dobré mať v hre druhého hráča. Multiplayer sa hrá na jednom stroji. Jedna loď sa ovláda na klávesnici a druhá prostredníctvom myšky. Kto si chce zaspomínať na staré časy arkádovej zábavy, nech vyskúša Platypus.
