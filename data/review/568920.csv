В связи с этим, можно спокойно заявить, что игра короткая, постижимая в плане прохождения, и имеет завышенную цену
Плюсы:
1) Несколько уровней сложностей, персонажи
2) Игра развивается - вышло бесплатное обновление
3) Приятная графика, персонажи, анимация - эдакий легкий мультик, сделанный на старом языке программирования
4) Управление - 3 кнопки, не считая движения
5) Есть демо версия на сайте разработчика
6) Музыка - под обстановку)
Минусы:
1) Дорого - даже со скидкой.
2) Коротко - 8 уровней, 2 персонажа на 2 уровня сложности
3) Практически все, что есть в игре - вы можете увидеть в видео.
Вывод, можно взять по скидке, если вам нравится графика, юмор как на видео и платформеры как игровой жанр

However, on further looks, I decided to give this game a chance. I started playing the game and loved its story, soundtrack, mechanics and envoirment (ironicly). The only thing I didn't like was the default controls, which I had to change at the beginning of the game. The Final Speciaman Arrival had 2 goals and did both of them very well. The first was to be comedic, and boy oh boy people don't seem to get this. The reason the game is made with the MS paint graphics is to be comedic! People would usually just use the graphics as source material for criticism. If you could just read the game description! The second goal this game had was to imitate platform games from the 90's they didn't do this to well but it does have the nostalgatic feeling of games like Super Mario Brothers. This was probably my favourite part of the game where you got to fight enemies and bosses with unique patterns in a unique world. Fun fact: When I was first playing through this game I caught staying, ""Beautiful background!"" When in reality this was draw in MS paint. Now, if I could describe this game in one word it would be ""underrated"" and I'll tel you why. I had a lot of fun playing this game and I went to Youtube to see what others think. When I searched up the game I was very suprised to find very few videos about this game. Even though gaming is overwhelming popular on Youtube. I felt very sad for this game. I thought that how could a game this good be ignored? That must be reality for most game developers, and now I feel sorry for them. I didn't really expect the game to be, that popular but I still thought it deserved some regonination.

The story is engaging, the snappy fully-voiced dialogue reminding me of Family Guy/South Park and providing a welcome interlude between levels. 

The overall design is exceptionally well built out. You can tell the developers spent a lot of time playing platformers, as even the opening level sends you on a trip through a series of tubes that could have come straight out of an old Sonic game.

As a kid, nothing matched the feeling of excitement when discovering a 1-Up in a secret area -- it was my first brush with an endorphin rush, and it’s where my love for gaming began. Though over time, the extra-life has slowly become somewhat of an antiquated notion; a relic of the gaming past. I never realized the nostalgic weight behind that feeling until I played The Final Specimen: Arrival, and when I found that glowing “T” in the suburban bushes of Doofusville. It’s a feeling I didn’t realize how much I had missed as a gamer, and it also made me convinced as to why TFS is a truly special entry in contemporary gaming.

Modernity never graces itself anywhere throughout TFS in all avenues, allowing the player to resign themselves to an earlier time in gaming, and without compromise. The result: the player sinks into their seat, and a familiar feeling settles in and the player embarks on an uncontaminated, and highly sentimental experience. TFS isolates a core gaming era, where Super Mario Bros. set the table for the side-scroller onslaught and players’ insatiable desire for more challenging gameplay within familiar mechanics. TFS is cemented in that time, consumed by the same preoccupations of those early developers: two games per one of their competitors.

These feelings are seldom found in nostalgia-trip games of the past few years. Many have mistakenly assumed that pixilation and 8-bit soundtracks are sufficient to encapsulate the essence of the floppy-disk game -- but few have matched TFS in its almost stubborn effort to remain true to its comrades. It is a staunch vestige of a lost era; an artifact that increases in value along the way.

The game wants you to fail; you never feel safe. But at the same time, it wants you to learn; to develop a very specific mindset. Your controllers become an extension of your body, and you slowly become a veteran as you play. When the sting of a missed opportunity to an extra life hangs above your character’s head, a motivation burns to never miss a similar opportunity – you begin to think a step ahead each move. It is a sting seemingly forgotten in modern gaming -- possibly for the best -- though TFS does not offer that debate, and frankly it doesn’t have to.

There is a romanticism to The Final Specimen: Arrival; a love letter to the days of the floppy-disked side-scrollers you once incessantly searched your childhood basements to find on a rainy Saturday. It calls to the early 90’s player, and demands your entire return to that time. But what makes TFS so special is its refusal to offer a refined nostalgia, and it instead doubles down on both its imperfections and camp value -- the player could have found this game in a cereal box, and that’s where its genius lies.

I highly recommend The Final Specimen: Arrival -- it is a welcome and enjoyable jaunt down a precious memory, and you will not want to put it down.",1488850436,1488850436,True,10,0,0.584421455860137939,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros: 
-Funny.  It made me laugh out loud a few times.  Even the backgrounds are ridiculous!  How many other places do see an advertisement for the ""Butthead beach and resort""? Not enough :P  
-Music/soundtrack - the tunes are really catchy and it sounds professionally recorded. 
-Cutscenes!  

Cons: 
-Can't save progress/ it's all one speedrun.  I play games a bit at a time, so not being able to save doesn't fit my needs.",1488746950,1488746950,True,7,0,0.452205181121826172,0,False,True,False,False,,,

this game broke me completely on level 3 where you encounter a bunch of pipes with arrows byut when you push the smae way as those arrows nothing happens and you still  get thrown in to acid, every single time.

due to this level and the price I dont reccomend buying this game

Fun play, haven't beat it yet, but so far it has had a good learning curve.
