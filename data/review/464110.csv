In that, you controlled three droids with different abilities, each of which could be controlled directly or programmed to execute a series of commands simultaneously to solve various puzzles. Factotum 90 has a much simpler conceit, only two droids, neither of which can be programmed only controlled alternately, both with the same abilities. Otherwise it's about using them cooperatively to navigate across a level, solving various small puzzles along the way. You might get one to stand on a button that activates a moving platform on which you've positioned the other, who can then activate a switch to turn off a force-field so the first droid can get through, that kind of thing.

It's a pretty gentle puzzle game, not particularly challenging - you will probably not get stumped, it's mostly a case of seeing what you need to do, and then executing it. This is pretty satisfying for the most part, although some of the tasks seem like busywork (take box here, run back there, take second box here etc) but never to the point of tedium. Each level is short and sweet. You've guided by a British guy who does a good job with the script, he'll introduce each level and interject every now and then, although the story isn't going to surprise you at all. Annoyances? The elevator music can't be turned off, there's no ""always run"" button (and you will want to always run, as walking speed is quite slow), you collect data packets with... no apparent benefit, and there's a vague air of clunkiness to the whole thing.

There's no pixel perfect nonsense or split-second time constraints here. If anything, I'd say the game errs slightly on the easy side, but that's preferable IMO to getting frustrated. Oh, and achievement hunters will be happy to know it's a simple one to complete 100%. There's an achievement for finishing the last level, and 12 for pressing buttons, pulling levers and exploding bombs x number of times. One thing I would like to have seen is an option to toggle off the music, but that's the only real negative I have. Maybe couch coop and even online coop would have given it broader appeal.

If there was ever a hidden gem, I think this is it.  Terrific game, fun puzzles, fun atmosphere, good production qualities.  I'm about 2 hours in now and have had a great time with this so far.  

I'm really diggin' the two screens, and ability to control two different robots.  The human scientist crewmember that you're working with is also well done,   It's like you have a pal working with you to help along the way with the puzzles.  The story is there's been some type of damage in deep space on the ship, and you're using these robots to investigate and navigate to and get the ship running again.   Mechanics are introduced gradually, and design of puzzles does a good job teaching you what you need to learn from each mechanic.  I'm really impressed with the design elements so far.  

Overall, this game runs smoothly and has been done with polish.  I've encountered no bugs whatsoever.  I'm impressed.  It's certainly fun for anybody looking for a 3d puzzler.

In Factotum 90, you solve puzzles with two little robots in an attempt to repair your damaged space ship.

1)неудачное оформление интерфейса, с эстетической точки зрения
2)большая часть уровней очень легкая
3)между качеством графики и скриншотами в магазине, к сожалению, есть разница.
4)кошмарная музыка
5)не очень понятно, зачем в игру встроили столько помех (в буквальном смысле: через весь экран периодически сверху вниз проносятся горизонтальные линии) - довольно неудачное решение. Играть не мешает, но мне кажется лишним.
6)довольно долго грузится главное меню. но в то же время сами уровни грузятся быстро.
7)иногда лагает, но на короткое время (не знаю с чем связано) играть это почти не мешает.

8)Если вы хотите купить эту игру ради карточек, то лучше не стоит.
