You may look at the trailers and think you already know what to expect, but you'd be wrong. There are some good moments when conventional 'gamers intuition' will let you down.

The ultimate goal is to get to the end of each level, and don't die. How you do that is up to you. Don't be limited by simplicity, jumping is your friend ;)

There are some really funny & frustrating moments to be had with this game. If you like quirky platformers, this is a nice way to kill a few hours!",1481995080,1481995080,True,5,1,0.558919966220855713,0,False,False,True,False,,,
