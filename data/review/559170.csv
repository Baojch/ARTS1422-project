Not a terrible title but pretty forgettable wave game. As a game it's pretty well made, good cartoon visuals and plenty of level maps. The levels are painfully dull until around the 5 wave at which point you actually get a challenge going. Until then it's not very interesting. I discovered a bug where a final zombie must have got stuck as I wasn't able to progress during a game. Only occured once so can't tell if how common this bug could crop up.

 I got this in a cheap VR bundle which is fair enough for a throw away sum but not really worth paying full whack.",1512843049,1512843049,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,False,False,False,False,,,

YouTube Gameplay: https://youtu.be/8BkzCs4NkYg

Let's see... Did you ever dream of being about as skilled as Tom Sawyer or Link with a slingshot? Search no more, this game is where you will hone your skills.

This game covers the basics very very well:
-Increasing challenge
-Fun and working mechanics
-Replay value
-Nice soundtrack
-Fair price

This stationary wave shooter is fully functional for both HTC and Oculus. There are quite a bunch of those on VR but just like Space Pirate Trainer, this one manages to stand out from the many ones that I've played so far. With a slingshot, the core mechanics feel somewhat similar to ""bow type"" games. One thing interesting is that you will aim with both hands, the one holding the slingshot but also the one that draws, something I haven't seen much of so far. It makes the whole process very intuitive and fun, every shot you take, you make.

The other thing is, that game as a lot of unlockables, if you are a VR dev reading this, PUT UNLOCKABLES IN YOUR GAMES. VR is so new, so fresh, great experiences are drowned in a plethora of sub-par ones so when a game manages to do something great (like this one), unlockables, at least in my opinion, is one if not the best reason to keep playing.

This game quickly makes you think it will be a walk in the park... With it's visual, it's quirky comedic presentation, it will have you fooled but know this, by the 4th or 5th wave, you'll quickly notice that this game becomes very serious when it comes to challenge.

So own your reflexes and let your teenagers do so as well, this game is non-intrusive, not scary and fairly ""family friendly"" when it comes to it's presentation.

There is nonetheless room for improvement, I do hope for more modes and a well deserved leaderboard (local and global) . I would like more stages and the ability to chose which ones to play in or which ones to be in the rotation. Some more skins could definitely be welcome and maybe some boss types. I do hope the developer will keep building this title because it is definitely off to a great start to make it so much more, but I do believe it is already a great offering.

Good job Blue Volcano!",1484757292,1484760129,True,2,1,0.515559971332550049,3,False,True,False,False,,,
