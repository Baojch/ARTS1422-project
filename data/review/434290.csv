My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707492775,1707492775,True,1,0,0.461165040731430054,0,True,False,False,True,,,

My one major gripe is that you can't 'backspace' if you accidentally start the wrong word you have to finish it out, which depending on the mode can be really frustrating.

Typefighters is another one of those minmalistic puzzle games on Steam, at least in presentation. In a nutshell, it is a competitive typing game, where you can type against the AI. The AI is usually, though not always pefectly accurate. instead it is fairly slow unless you turn up its speed before a match for a challenge. There's a nice variety of modes, but it all boils down to typing against black letters on a white screen. While it might be neat or fun to challenge yourself a bit, it will become boring quick.

The game is meant to be played with other people. There is a multiplayer screen to play online, but at the time of writing is ultimately pointless - there was one player online when i first looked into it (it shows the player count at the bottom left of the main menu) and I thought it was counting me. I relaunched the game at a later time and it shown zero players. Whoops. You can either host an open or private server and then players can either join by a server browser or join directly by IP address. I don't think most PCs can use multiple keyboards by default, so its seems like the only way to play locally is to have multiple PCs each with their own Steam copy of this game and connect to each other with direct Ip addresses.

[h1]Typefighters is a mostly multiplayer would be a pointless purchase due to a dead player base and a sllightly arduous way to play the game locally. Singleplayer is a fun distraction for a couple minutes, but quickly turns out too boring or too hard.

With just a few changes, I think I'd recommend this game:

[list]
[*] Allow custom dictionaries to be added by players via some method like the Steam Workshop (American English seems to contain words that aren't even in some dictionaries?)
[*] Add a 'debris' gamemode, where a large field of words is placed onto the screen (important: words NOT MOVING) and players get points for clearing the words off the screen.
[*] If I am in the middle of typing a word and the other player beats me, I don't want my momentum from continuing to type that word select a new one that I didn't intend to. Allow some kind of configurable timeout to occur, or just multi-match for the some 0.4 seconds after getting beaten to allow the player's hands to stop moving.
[*] Many of the gamemodes with moving words or random positioning are more disorienting than they should be, and are less about the typing as they are re-focusing on the newly spawned text in order to read it.
[/list]

With those few changes, I feel my review will then be a positive one.

There are some additional features I would wish to see from a more completed game though:

[list]
[*] An accuracy/endurance mode: less about ""quick draw"" mechanics and more about finishing complete sentences or paragraphs. (With or without punctuation as an option.)
[*] More than two players in some gamemodes: there's a lot of potential for something like 8 player asteroids mode or similar ideas
[*] Multi-word and symbol options: allow custom dictionaries to include full lines of text, so that people could train on terminal commands, common sentences, or text involving numbers and symbols like LaTeX or mathematica languages.

I played this game a year ago and I took it again now just for fun xD
Well, I won only one thing in my entire life - European championships for typing speed or something like this. I mean, various titles in the same ""competition"" type XD
One can probably argue that this is one of the many causes that forced me to undergo surgery three times on my right hand, but this is another story.. xD
Well, I have always typed like at 700-800 characters per minute (NOT WPM, that means WORDS per minute! 800 words per minute I think not even an octopus). So this game was one of my very first choices on Steam.
And in single player AND in local co-op it works greatly.
It lacks on its probably funniest part - the multiplayer one. Basically, no one plays it (and no one played it back in 2016 - I played it at the beginning of 2017, 0 players online ever). So you'll never play with an online adversary, but just with a local one if you manage to get one xD
The game supports LAN playing and so on.
And it offers you tons of different modes which of course all revolve around typing!
There's no great tutorial, but you'll likely learn everything by playing and it's really a small time-killer.
You'll be able to choose, apart from the almost 10 different playing modes, the time limit, the dictionary, the length of the words you'll have to type, the speed of the AI if you're in single player mode and such.
You'll also have the chance to change the colors and so on.
The various modes are quite challenging and funny, and I found no problems at all to understand how they worked even without a tutorial.
And the game also serves as a typing checker, since you'll always be provided after each level with a sheet telling you your speed, the perfect words you typed, the letters missed and everything else. Quite educational!
The different modes - namely stream, attention, creativity, tug, lines, reflect, projectiles and guess - all provide different challenges, like, ""attention"" will require you to type words appearing in different parts of the screen (while of course you'll always, in single player, have control of the AI's speed and other options before every game, since it'll try to type the words before you xD), ""creativity"" will scramble words through the screen in different colors, or ""tug"" will be a real tug-of-war: you and the AI (or the opponent if you're playing with someone else) will battle with a horizontal line going up and down depending on your speed and the words typed in the correct way.
In the end, this game has lots of bugs (but they never affect the gameplay itself, just the graphics in the menus) and, most of all, it has NO multiplayer activity and it's been like this for ages, almost since it came out here.
So, you've got to take into account that this IS incomplete and will always be as it is, for no other players will play this game and you'll be unable to enjoy a real multiplayer battle, unless you've got a friend connected both in LAN or on Steam, but yeah you've got to put each other in contact before and it's not easy for such a small and casual game xD
All in all, and having always been a lover of typing (I've been European champion for real in the early '00s! XD), I'd recommend this small game for its price (it has also trading cards!) - just be aware that you're going for a mostly single-player typing game, casual and filled with nice playing modes and such, but all against the AI.
In my view, not only it's ok and it has got lots of customization available, but it can also be educational - way funnier than the plain 1-minute typing standard exercise things you can find on the Internet.
But this is not a game, in the end. It's a typing exercise and challenge, funny and casual, entertaining, but it's always a game revolving around typing random words and sentences with your keyboard.
If you think that it can be educative and interesting (for the dictionary options too), I'd recommend it. If you wanna something funny and casual like a small game, this isn't probably the one for you but probably if you're searching for platformers and casual shooters you're not looking here xD",1524001467,1524001575,True,21,1,0.719567656517028809,1,True,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: Hardcore challenge, cutomizable. However bland, simplistic Unity Engine shell. Easy to lose track of which word the engine wants you to type. Lacks flavor.

Epistory, Typing of the Dead Overkill, Typer Shark Deluxe, Grimm's Quest: Remastered and God of Word are five different games in this very specific subgenre that ultimately outclass this.

I like that you can customize the time limit, the level of impact of the computer AI stealing words from you and the like. However it is just not enough. The white background is quickly fatiguing on the eyes and the sound effects quickly become grating.

The multiplayer is completely dead, but it could be a bit of fun with friends. However, this game has some huuuuuuge balancing problems. 

There are a few game modes where typing speed isn't sooo important, but if one player can type at 100wpm and one player types at a max of 55wpm, there's no question who is going to win - even if the 55wpm player is, say, better at coming up with words in 'Creativity' mode or has faster instincts. There is one mode where typing speed isn't a significant factor but can still decide matches - Reflection. It's variant, Tug, is still largely decided by typing speed. I just don't see any way this can be much fun with the lack of balance. 

Competition against the AI falls into two categories: way too slow, or impossibly quick, to the point where it is impossible to do things earlier than the AI. It isn't all that much fun even when the AI does match you because the match feels empty.

Typeracer is, unfortunately, way more fun.

I played it for about an hour and I don't think I'll ever touch it again. It definitely isn't worth the $2, and I'll go into exactly why with some more brutal comments as this review draws to an end.

TypeFighters is a poor realisation of a great - but largely impractical - idea. A game that uses typing as its main game mechanic? That's so cool! Typeracer is great and all, but it's not that much fun when the only game element is competing for the top 20 scores of the hour. It's just a singleplayer typing test where the results are compared against other people, and the closest it comes is to 5 people doing the same typing test at the same time. That's *almost* like competitive gameplay, but it's still way too separate. Typeracer is an ego trip - I've wanted a multiplayer typing game where there is both skill and speed involved for a long time. TypeFighters is the exact kind of game I wanted to love, but it's just gets boring too fast.

There are a bunch of modes, but once you've played them a few times, you've played them to death. There's some definite creativity here - I particularly like Tug & Reflection.

Speaking of competition, there are SOOO many different game modes, from connect 5, tug of war, to even just who can make the most words. There's always variety and you can always swap game modes in between matches. You can customize your matches to crank up the difficulty so it's fair. 

You can even CREATE YOUR OWN LIST OF WORDS. I know, it's crazy, but say you wanted to just play a full game with nothing but curse words, you can do that. Albeit you have to type those words in by hand or find some website to rip the words from, but there's always some way to customize your experience.

Basically, it seems worth warning people off from this.

I wanted to, erm, not hate this game, shall we say... but...

It really is quite terrible. Despite being a very fast typer, I have trouble mustering the typing energy to even elucidate why.

Perhaps that's because I am afraid of spending more effort writing a review than it takes to make a game as simplistic and terribly flawed as this.

In that sense, I speak as a programmer and a connoisseur of typing games.

So, I'll just quickly list out a bunch of the problems here:

There's (almost) nothing here for fast typers like myself. The game just doesn't scale. Doesn't show enough words on the screen at once (except the stream mode, which, due to its lateral movement, is too hard to visually follow; Lines mode is ok, and maybe projectiles mode in multiplayer, but that's about it).

The whole concept of multiplayer as executed here is fatally flawed. The only way this would ever be remotely fun is if the two players were almost exactly matched, and how likely is that? Not very, considering the huge range of typing ability that exists. The game tries to inject other elements besides just typing speed, but doesn't really succeed, imo. It's just awkward.

The ""matchmaking"" doesn't even exist as far as I can tell in the modern sense of the word. I think what the dev meant by this is... a server list. Yeah, a server list. But, even on launch day when steam stats say ~70 people are playing, I couldn't find any open games. It also supports direct IP, but then you'd have to fiddle with ports. From what I read on the forums, it sounds like you have to fiddle with ports to even get the non-direct ""matchmaking"" to work. There's no instructions on that, and maybe I'm wrong, but, whatever.

You can play against AI, but the AI just types words randomly at an EXACT speed. That kind of makes sense, but it's just not fun, especially since, at least for faster typers, their performance against AI especially will be down mostly due their ability to recognize words quickly after they appear (the AI starts typing immediately with no delay), and to not get tripped up by ""weird"" words that the game throws at you.

Similarly to ""matchmaking"", yes, the game has steam leaderboards, but they're, erm, silly, shall we say. Mostly they just track number of games won, which isn't well correlated with skill or anything. Then there's other stuff like a leaderboard for the highest difficulty AI opponent won, but that's just a multiplication of the two variables you can set for the AI, and there's pretty cheesy ways for even inexperienced typers to win against the hardest setting, so that, too, is awfully silly and pointless.

There's a variety of other more specific flaws like not being able to cancel out of typing a word you accidentally started - sometimes it's even hard to quickly figure out which word that is since you weren't already looking at it. The lines mode, one of the more interesting ones, has screwy graphics that make words hard to see quickly, which is again, a must for fast typers, if nothing else.

The word list is... bizarre. You are given a lot of very weird, obscure words, and lots of random proper nouns, and... roman numerals. It seems to randomly choose between categories of words, so a large proportion end up being proper nouns, and a surprisingly large percentage seem to be roman numerals... how did that ever seem to be a good idea?

There are, of course, no real graphics to speak of.

On the positive side, it's cool that the menus can also be operated via typing (though not entirely original), and the overall feel of the typing is slick and responsive. The general concept is interesting, but interesting ultimately doesn't matter if the execution is inadequate.

So, sure, this is kind of an original idea (at least, I'm not aware of another game that has this kind of direct, mano a mano typing gameplay), but who would this appeal to?

Well, I guess it just might be sort of fun for two friends that don't type very fast and happen to type at very similar rates - so I guess if you fall into that narrow category, then go for it, but otherwise steer clear.

Or, you can try it for less than 2 hours and see for yourself and then just grab a refund like I'm about to. EDIT: or, you can find the free version around elsewhere (I think it's the same except for the server list feature).

There plenty of better/good/decent alternatives for typing games out there. Even if you've played them all and are desperate for variety, this is unlikely to satisfy you in any way. For example, choose Epistory for a generally nice, well rounded typing game on Steam, or Typer Shark for a more simplistic yet challenging typing experience. For a real time competitive game, try Serpentine online (basically a Tangleword/boggle clone), or hi-games for pure, real time typing speed matchups.",1461047386,1461087120,False,280,12,0.779888927936553955,21,True,False,False,False,,1461221315.0,"Hi,

thanks for your hones opinion, it is greatly appreciated! However I need to point out a few things:
- You can in fact cancel out words you started, just press ESC.
- The AI has been improved since release and, among other things, has now a delay when starting to type.
- And you can add your own wordlists if you don't like the default ones. Lot's of free ones out there, but most not be used in this game due to their licence.

Textual summary:
I recommend watching the video for the most complete impression of the title.

Now, this is a 2 dollar game, so while i do make some allowances in regards to it's ""minimal"" graphics, i still find the game to be a barren landscape of...words. But thankfully, the game has words and typing aplenty in a pretty decent multiplayer as well as a surprisingly good Ai with a reasonable set of customization options considering it's price.

The various game modes work to lesser or greater extents, but all of them do full fill a different take on the whole ""type words faster than your opponent"" thing. 

It's fully a niche title and it's full game play is visible from the get to, and while it does have some strategic components to it, it still boils down to ""type faster than player 2""... which is fine.

for the price, it's hard not to recommend the title if you, in any way, are interested in some scrabble on steroids.
