Settled is a short narrative experience, in a similar vein to a walking sim, that last about 40 minutes of playtime. It's story and visuals are unsettling as it follows a father trying to cope with the death of his daughter. You move through the house and interact with objects as subtle changes are made with each 'day'. 

Settled 2D pixel visuals remind me much of The Last Door and they work pretty well with how the story is shown and presented.

The story itself is told mainly through its use of visuals with minimal dialogue through flashbacks. You are left with piecing the mystery together as you look through the home and the twist reveal at the end was not one I had predicted. I will not be spoiling it here as it's much better to play the game blind.

Story:

I'll keep this section super short, since I really don't want to spoil it. You play as a father who is suffering the loss of a loved one, as his sanity is slowly dwindling. The story is actually quite surprising and I definitely didn't expect the places it went to and I definitely was creeped out.

Graphics:

I have a massive soft spot for pixel type graphics and while not the most detailed game I've played, it does look really decent and does portray it's creepy imagery well, especially during cutscenes which are really well done. The cutscenes are pretty impressive, but the main game could have definitely been better, although what's here is really well done. 

Audio:

The audio design is really decent, albeit it's kept to absolute minimum. The music is creepy droning noises I'm usually not a fan of, but I feel like the ones in Settled are really well done and really help build an incredibly tense atmosphere, often making you think that something is going to be waiting for you in the next screen. There's not much other sound effects, but what's here is decent. 

Gameplay:

There's not much gameplay in Settled to speak of. You're mostly going to be just doing walking and exploring the environments you're in, looking for items that will help you get to different locations. It's mostly walking, but it's fine since the game has a heavier focus on the story than the gameplay and since the story is really good, I didn't mind that there wasn't really anything puzzle-esque for you to do. 

I will say however, the main character has a really slow walking speed and sometimes it gets really tedious to walk back and forth, thinking you missed something in the previous area and then having to walk all the way back, which is incredibly annoying. 

Verdict:

Settled was a pleasant surprise for me since I had no idea what to expect going into it and what I found was a creepy 30 minute adventure that I had a blast going through. Considering the cheap price and the short length, if you want something creepy for a single sitting, check out Settled. 

Final Rating:
7.5/10

Pros:
+ Story is really decent
+ Pretty creepy 

Cons:
- Not much gameplay
- Slow walking speed could get tedious

There's only about a half hour of gameplay here with none too complex objectives set to accomplish in order to advance the game.  So those looking for a deep, technical n' classic VIDEO GAME experience might want to skip it.  Horror fans on the other hand...I think you should give it a try.  It's cheap and if you end up hating it, well, you've got nothing to lose.  

You're put in the mind of a paranoid protagonist that is starting to deal with some strange phenomena in his home.  Even from the beginning things are simply not quite right...  You'll do some segments of meandering around the humble abode which acts as cool interludes between pieces of a nightmare story that play out in flashbacks.  There are cool teeny mechanic touches like nervously peering out your front door's peephole and finding new parts of the house unlocked the deeper our ""MC (or main character if you will)"" falls into the past recesses of his brain...as well as wondering why your face never appears quite normal in the mirror...

To reveal too much much of the story would kill the whole point of even playing Settled, so count me out.  I'll simply say that the story (even if you figure out what's happening) is definitely some dark, mind-bending stuff.  Every layer you play through is sicker and more diseased-ridden than the last; backed by a killer artistic aesthetic with range that goes from subtle to gruesome.  The sound perfectly follows the visual presentation's lead.  

As stated above, the limited objectives are something I'd like to see fleshed out in a longer game by the dev because with this storytelling piled ontop, you really could ramp up every quality that Settled firmly hints at.  Then again, perhaps the experience would thus overstay its welcome and not give you the short, visceral intensity that is what I'll always remember Settled for.

And so here we have a very short, well-put 2D horror with a compelling narrative and a strong sense of foreboding. Even though [u]Settled[/u]'s selling point is its storyline, it also features fleshed out pixel art and good sound effects.

Settled's story line introduces itself as a retroactive examination of a grieving father's relationship with his daughter. Not an uncommon narrative. The father walks around the house and we revisit a lot of their old memories as we interact with certain objects in the house. About midway through however, Settled begins to drop subtle satanic undertones throughout all of this that slowly begin to creep under your skin. At first, they just seem to be a manifestation of the father's trauma, but as the story unfolds, the satanic themes become clearer and more apparent until they reveal the story's plot twist ending. 

Using only Construct 2, developer Allen Dayan was able to execute a solid concept for a game. Similarly, using mechanics limited to HTML-5 code, like walking and interacting with objects, Settled features playable traumatic experiences that linger once you finish. In part, because of good writing, fleshed out pixel art, and eerie sound design. I took a few seconds in the credits to see that www.freesfix.co.uk was the source for the audio samples. These sound effects were crisp and the score became increasingly eerie in tone. [u]Settled[/u] is very short, affordable, and a truly creepy experience.

Минималистичная графика оказывается не просто стилистическим решением, но еще и единственным способом рассказать эту историю правильно; минималистичный саундтрек соответствует ей на сто процентов, и в первую очередь на нем держится тревожная атмосфера игры. Любое раскрытие деталей сюжета ""Settled"" можно считать спойлером - отметим лишь, что он выдержан в традициях авторов хорроров из 90-х (чем-то напоминая рассказы одновременно Клайва Баркера и Стивена Кинга), и что он рассказывает о человеке, который хотел украсть чужое счастье вместо того, чтобы заработать собственное.

Отдельно отметим грамотное использование скримеров - автор не прибегает к дешевым ""страшным рожам под звуки крика"", которые на корню убили бы весь саспенс, находя более изящные, но не менее эффективные решения в плане создания ощущения бесконечной тревожной паранойи - и все это в 2D-игре, суть которой сводится к блужданию по локациям и взаимодействию с предметами.

Вывод: крепкий представитель жанра современных хоррорных инди-игр, который использует примитивный на первый взгляд геймплей для нагнетания напряжения, за что и рекомендуется всем поклонникам психологических триллеров. Автор ""Settled"" понимает, что лишь от игрока зависит, когда тот заглянет в окно или дверной глазок, откроет дверь или спустится по лестнице, и каждый раз он находит отличные способы убедить игрока в том, что по ту сторону главного героя ждет нечто ужасающее.

Settled is  a very short narrative exploration and its good at its execution. A tense atsmosphere is build with the changing surroundings in game and the eerie sounds accompanying you through the whole experience. I ""beat"" the game under an hour and enjoyed the game greatly for its presentation and story (though it becomes obvious what the end will be if you combine all the clues correctly). 99 Cents for the game is a nice price tag and I would recommend to get it if you cannot wait for a sale. Should it be on sale at some point I would highly recoomend it as a horror fan!

Nice to know: While I was streaming the game, the eeriness of the game made one of my Followers leave the stream, because he was not able to handle the atmosphere anymore

I put off playing it for so long because alot of reviews said ""Its messed up"" and it had a little girl in it. Needless to say, certain combinations of ""Messed up"" and ""Little girl"" can make me quite furious and disgusted, and I was afraid this game went there for the sake of being sick. 

Turns out, it doesn't go quite that far.. thankfully, but yes, it is ""Messed up""

Settled uses conflicting imagery, foreshadowing, and a narrative that is revealed from the beginning, but its so ""Messed up"" you'd never think of how to connect the clues until the end. The game mixes pixel art and then a simple pixel sidescroller play style, with the scenes often peering into the art, or the art flashing on the screen for mere moments before vanishing for the sake of creeping you out. This game, quite the opposite of the name, will never have you feel ""settled"" only incredibly ""Unsettled"" its one of those games that has you waiting for a horrifying life altering jumpscare the whole time. The audio is incredibly good at encouraging this, with music that will have your spine shivering through the whole playthrough.

The game does have flashing creepy imagery at some points, so I would avoid it if ""Jumpscares"" are too much for you. As for reccommending it, I can, if you know what you are getting. Less than an hour of walking around in a house, with objects triggering flashbacks and nightmares, then walking around more until the ending.

It's a game that still stands as one of the more unique horror experiences, despite not having the fancy frills of high end graphics, immersive dialogue, or even modern gaming conveniences. Settled can very much be compared to Home in the way that it's presented, played, and the short-but-thrilling adventure that it houses.

No parent should outlive their children... this chilling adage is repeated numerous times throughout the gameplay; from the beginning, right through until the bitter end. The story has a simple enough concept, you play as a father who has lost his daughter. As the game winds on, it becomes apparent that his kid was either murdered, or died in some preventable attrocity, and the guilt of the man follows him. Players are deliberately led through various conclusions to what happened, but it's within the last 3-5 minutes of the game where the whole picture really becomes clear, and the horrifying, unpredictable, plot twist becomes a sick reality.

The gameplay itself is extremely simple; you use the left and right arrow keys to move, spacebar to examine objects, and the down arrow key to back out of an examination scene. No, there is no save option because Settled only lasts about half an hour even if you explore everything. There's also nothing in the way of a menu, as it's an unnecessary concept. There's little in the way of sound, save for footsteps and some very low atmospheric ambiance. That being said, where the game is lacking in audio appeal, it makes up for with amazing pixel visuals, haunting scenes of gore, and numerous mini-cutscenes.

Just as with Home, you really need to play Settled in order to fully understand it. It's difficult to create a review for it since so much of the event can be spoiled by talking about all of the better parts of the game. Fans of Home, and even Uncanny Valley to a certain extent, will find Settled an excellent addition to this overlooked niche horror sub-genre. Sadly, it doesn't have branching endings, so after the initial 30 minute playthrough it will just sit in your virtual library, collecting virtual dust. With that said, snagging it at a 50% discount is a huge bargain, but the standard price is still worth the quick experience.

30분 정도의 짧막한 스토리 게임입니다. 총 플레이타임이 30분이라 스팀 환불을 방지하기 위해 찌꺼기가 남습니다 :O

스토리를 보는 게임이라 게임의 내용은 말할 수 없습니다만 서양 공포소설들을 보면 가끔씩 나오는 이야기입니다. 픽셀 아트로 무난하게 이야기를 풀어내는 과정이 자연스러워 좋았습니다.

다만 서양 공포물에 익숙하신 분들은 재미없을 수도 있으며 연출도 픽셀 아트 호러물들의 정통적인 연출들이 사용되어 이쪽 게임을 좀 즐기신 분은 식상하실 수 있습니다. 어드벤처적인 요소 하나없이 그냥 이리저리 돌아다니는 식이라 게임플레이하는 재미도 없어서 차라리 노블식으로 만들거나 아니면 퍼즐이라도 있었으면 하는 바램도 있습니다.

딱히 큰 장점도 없고 큰 단점도 없는 게임으로 킬링타임용 공포소설이 필요하신 분정도면 볼만한 게임이라고 봅니다. 그러나 공포소설을 킬링타임용으로 읽을만한 정도라면 책을 어느정도 보신 분이라 생각되며 요새 디지털은 e북으로 저렴하게 나오는데 굳이 이 게임을 구매할 필요는 없어보입니다.",1471663199,1471663298,False,23,2,0.737764120101928711,2,False,False,False,False,,,

[B]Full Review:[/b]

 Settled is a Retro-style, Pixel graphics Adventure game, similar in style to Point-&-Click titles in that you wander around interacting with objects as they appear. The story is the most compelling aspect of Settled; you begin as a father who has lost his only daughter, and as the plot unfolds, there are some satisfying twists and turns that leave you guessing as to what exactly has happened. I don’t want to give away the ending, but the story resolution was intriguing and well worth the play-through. 

The trouble is that Settled is an extremely short game -- although my hours played shows 18+ hours, I was able to defeat it easily within an hour of actual playtime. One aspect of the game that frustrated me is that, upon exiting through the in-game menu, the actual game program remained running in the background on my PC unbeknownst to me. When I finally realized that Steam had me flagged as in-game still, I was unable to find the Settled program even in task manager (despite other reviewers saying that worked for them) and I had to actually restart my entire ‘rig to get past this. The developer has stated that this should be fixed in the future.

[b]In Conclusion: 5/10 [/b]
 
The price point for Settled isn’t bad at all, even with the short duration. There’s little to no replay value here, unfortunately, but it’s still a ride I’m glad I took. If you’re on the fence, maybe wait until a sale pops up, but honestly, even at current price, it’s not a bad way to spend 60-80 minutes.

There's no option to exit from or skip through text so everytime any appears on the screen (CONSISTENTLY only one or two sentences at most) you have to wait 5-10+ seconds. 

The game would definitely benefit from ALL of the interactable items having flavor-text, not just the coat. It's not the only thing that changes so it doesn't make sense for it to be treated as such.


(SPOILERS)
You play as a regular old dad who's very upset his daughter died and has resorted to killing people and collecting cow heads to bring her back! Except, not really. The story is very unclear and the 'twist ending' where it turns out you're some random dude that killed the father because he wanted to have his daughter for himself did not clear anything up at all.
There's a motif of cow skulls and and sacrifice for what seems to be no real reason. There's a specific instance in the game (and in one of the preview screens) where the Star of David / Seal of Solomon is used in place of where a pentagram would be in a spooky game like this, but I couldn't find any correspondence between either symbol and cow heads so it doesn't make any sense. Literally the only thing that's cleared up by the """"""BIG TWIST"""""" are the scenes where you approach 'yourself' from behind all spooky-like (you as the killer are approaching the father from behind). Everything that isn't extremely obvious to piece together by just playing the game doesn't make sense at all.
If the twist was instead that the daughter got murdered and the father is sacrificing people to bring her back the game would make a LOT more sense (especially the scene where the wall says 'DAD LET ME DIE'?? like that doesn't make any sense in the context that you're playing the random killer).

Settled is a pretty little game (that is if disemboweled people hanging from the ceiling fit your definition of „pretty”) that I have great many mixed feelings reserved for. Firstly, the gameplay is very limited even for the standards of an indie adventure game. Namely:walk left, walk right, interact. That's all there is to this game. 
  
Furthermore, I can not really make up my mind whether I like the art style or not. True, that it is a brown-greyish (and ocassionally profound red), low-res, pixelated and rather fugly for the most part. And then there is the „devil” who looks surprisingly awesome for all his classic, horned, red – eyed image. Oh, and he is,but of course, symbolic, like it should be in a modern, ambitious, indie horror. 

Then there is this rather frugal use of sound. Still, I'd rather argue that the player hears exactly as much (or, more specifically, as little) as needs to be heard and precisely in the right moment. Furthermore, the game never stoops so low as to employ the jump scares. The atmosphere is built by … oh, let me have it in a separate paragraph, k? Trust me, the aura that Settled manages to create deserves a paragraph of its own.

Well, the tension that Settled manages to build up and maintain is, unquestionably, the game's selling point. Although short, Settled manages to preserve that fragile balance between tension and gore without feeling cheap or incongruous for a moment. And in my opinion, that is enough to carry  a horror game through. Truth be told, I think that it would be prudent of Frictional Games (you know, these dudes behind Penumbra, Amnesia and lately Soma) to consider employing Allen Dayan (Settled's author). 

Whether you sway towards psychological or gore, there are plenty horror games on Steam. Truth be told, the only reason for this review's existence is the fact that Corpse Party hasn't downloaded yet. Still, I believe this game is worth attention. Sure it is a half-an-hour experience, but that's more or less a price of a hamburger. And for the most part, there is more meat in Settled.  

Wersja polska. 

Settled to taka mała, urocza gierka ( jeżeli wypatroszeni ludzie przybici do ścian mieszczą się w twojej definicji słowa „uroczy” ) która wywołała we mnie sporo mieszanych uczuć. Po pierwsze, rozgrywka jest tu bardzo ograniczona nawet jak na standardy przygodowych indyków: idź w lewo, idź w prawo, użyj czegoś na czymś. Tyle.

Dalej; grafika. Nie mogę się zdecydować co o niej myślę. Przez większość czasu utrzymuje tonację szaro-burą ( z okazjonalną domieszką głębokiej czerwieni), atakuje oczy pikselami na pół ekranu i jest, co tu dużo gadać, zwyczajnie paskudna. I wtedy pojawia się „diabeł”, który to w całej swojej klasycznej, rogatej, czerwono okiej okazałości jest całkiem za*ebisty. I jest, oczywiście, symboliczny, jak przystało na ambitny, niezależny, współczesny horror.

Dźwięk jest zdecydowanie oszczędny. Powiedziałbym: słychać dokładnie tyle ile trzeba i we właściwym momencie. Dodatkowo gra nigdy nie zniża się do straszenia jump scare'ami i chwała jej za to. Settled buduje atmosferę w … pozwólcie że opowiem o tym w oddzielnym paragrafie. Nastrój jaki panuje w tej grze zasługuje na swój własny akapit, k?

Do rzeczy: napięcie jakie Settled buduje i jest w stanie utrzymać aż do samego końca jest głównym powodem żeby zapoznać się z grą. Settled nie wystarcza na długo, niemniej jednak jest w stanie osiągnąć ten niesamowity balans pomiędzy napiętą do granic wytrzymałości atmosferą a wiadrami krwi bryzgającymi z ekranu bez uciekania się do tanich chwytów czy wywoływania uczucia niespójności. Prawdę powiedziawszy, w mojej opinii Frictional Games ( czyli goście od Penumbry, Amnesii czy ostatnio Somy) powinni rozważyć zatrudnienie Allena  Dayana (czyli gościa od Settled) do projektowania cut-scenek. Serio, dokładnie takie miałem wrażenie grając w Settled. 

Niezależnie od tego czy wolicie psychologiczny horror czy juchę lejącą się z ekranu, na brak gier na Steamie narzekać nie możecie. Tak właściwie, ta recka powstała głównie z powodu przeciągającego się downloadu Corpse Party z którym planuję się za chwilę bliżej poznać.Ale wracając do Settled, niby starcza na pół godziny ale kosztuje mniej więcej tyle co buła w Maku.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
Wir spielen einen Mann der in einem Haus aufwacht und es wirkt, als  wird dieser  von irgend etwas geplagt.
Mit der Zeit bekommen wir Errinnerungen zu  sehen und erleben diese neu.
Was beschäftigt dieser Mann und  was ist hier passiert? Dies finden wir in diesem kurzen Spiel heraus.

[h1][b]Grafik[/b][/h1]
Wir haben hier ein typisches 2D Adventure Spiel und im Zusammenhang  damit ist die Grafik auch ausreichend und bringt perfekt die düstere Stimmung auf die wir von diesem Spiel erwarten. Durch dieses 2D bleibt auch viel raum für Fantasy, die  uns aber durch Bilder und Szenen die  detailierter sind wieder genommen wird.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
Die Steuerung ist recht einfach mit der Tastatur und wird am Anfang erklärt. Man wird durch  das Spiel geführt und es wird hervorgehoben womit man interagieren kann, wodurch man schneller in der Geschichte voran kommt. Für so ein Spiel braucht man auch nicht mehr dafür.

[h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1]
Die Geräusche  werden gut in Szene gesetzt, genau wie die Musik. Beides zusammen schafft einen richtigen Nervenkitzel, wodurch wir in manchen Situationen wirklich gespannt sind aber auch teilweise vermuten das irgendwas passiert.

[h1][b]Wiederspielwert[/b][/h1]
Da die Geschicht relativ kurz gehalten ist, wird man Sie wahrscheinlich kein zweites  mal spielen. Ebenso gibt es keine Erfolge die ein erneutes Spielen erfordern. Aber dazu ist dieses Spiel auch nicht gedacht. Es soll einen einmal fesseln und in  seinen Bann  ziehen.

[h1][b]Herausforderung[/b][/h1]
In diesem  Adventure  Spiel, kann man nicht viel erforschen und auch muss man nichts  erraten bzw. herausfinden. Die Gegenstände und Pfade werden hervorgehoben wodurch wir sehr einfach durch das Spiel geführt werden. Für dieses Spiel wünscht man sich aber auch keine Herausforderung da  man die Geschichte auf sich wirken lassen möchte.

[h1][b]Fazit[/b][/h1]

Wer sich einmal fesseln lassen möchte bzw. einen kleinen Nervenkitzel oder eine düstere Geschichte mit einem Geheimnis sucht, dem kann ich dieses Spiel nur Empfehlen. Man könnte vielleicht für so einen Preis ein bisschen mehr erwarten aber nachdem ich dieses Spiel durchgespielt habe, war es mir der Preis Wert.",1461017546,1461017546,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- nice use of symbolism
- great art work/graphics
Cons:
- very straight-forward, so it's very easy to play
- more story-based than actual game play (then again, it does say in the description that it's some sort of a story-based game)
- a bit of back-and-forthing
- very short (about 25-30 minutes)
Overall, I would recommend it if you're bored enough to want to pass the time for an interestingly twisted story (if you're into that kind of stuff). However, I would not recommend it due to how short it is, and how easy it is to play it.",1460141099,1460141099,False,1,2,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i]Settled[/i] lacks in length as a laid back 40-minute experience which isn't interactive enough as a game to be called much more than what people call a walking simulator. What excels is the execution of the narrative and the strange, eerie tale itself which would have all been marvellous to build upon as a point and click like the aforementioned horror series.

Using the arrow keys to move and back out from interactions and spacebar to interact with highlighted objects, you are introduced to the story much the way you would reading a picture book. You move your character mainly through a house among other locations whilst looking at objects and a variety of scenes to easily grasp a timeline to put together your own version of the events that seem to have unfolded. Excruciatingly tempting as it is to unveil a little bit of the story, it is the core of this game and as someone who went in without an ounce of knowledge about [i]Settled[/i] I am glad I went in blindfolded and came out with a sense of uneasiness as I doubt I would have felt as intensely had I known any of the story beforehand. 

This is what I yearn for badly written narrative reliant games to turn into, namely poorly penned visual novels or bland exploration games that lack any literal composition. [i]Settled[/i] uses an elegant method of telling stories with minimal text yet still emphasising a narrative rich experience. You are presented with flashbacks or self reflection and these snippets of thoughts and scenes are accompanied by a bare minimum of text. Many indie developers have a wealth of creativity in them but don't possess the skills crucial to relay it effectively by utilising written word to the extent of a novella or even an anecdote. This leads to winning plots quickly morphing into indecipherable and wasted gobbledygook within an otherwise well made game and a mistake so many incompetently written games make. Even though it plays like a 2D version of [i]Gone Home[/i] where you move through rooms and open doors to interact with objects that tell you a story, [i]Settled[/i] is the better version since it refuses to use traditional narration and walls of text instead substituting it with visuals much more meritoriously. This game proves once again that even without intricate game mechanics, you needn't be so reliant on words to tell a worthy story and create a solid narrative experience. 

Having played [i]Sharf[/i] a day earlier (basically a mini-me version of [i]Settled[/i]) and it being half an hour shorter, with absolutely no world-building and yet pulling off making my heart heavier than this game did, I am optimistic that the developer could easily build a much more comprehensive game with an even creepier universe for a more satisfactory experience. An outstanding example of gameplay and mood is [i][b]Reveal the Deep[/b][/i] (also a first time for these developers) which is a surreal pixellated adventure horror game set in the dark depths of the ocean, which keeps your hair on end all throughout and is a true hidden gem. If you are a fan of the horror game genre and have played a good number of similar games, it is unlikely that [i]Settled[/i] will scratch that horror itch or scare you much even with the eventuality of it being a psychological thriller. Even so, the ending does make most of it worthwhile and though up until that point you'd have wondered when the game would end, you'll be saddened that it is so short despite it managing not to feel abrupt, and just want more. Hence, as an indie game made by someone inexperienced in such endeavours, it is well done and makes me look forward to future work from them.


[h1]TL;DR[/h1] 
Just over half an hour is much too short even for this price ($1.99), better similar games cheaper. Bright side, definitely worthwhile story to it, will want to play till end.

'cause that's gonna determine how much you'll enjoy this game. If it's high, you'll enjoy this little story. If it's low, give it a pass.

The gameplay in this game is just a process of moving from one checkpoint that moves the story along to another. There's enough minor things changing along the way that looking at objects multiple times is worthwhile, though if you're only interested in getting through the story you'll find that searching for whatever object gets you back to the story is annoying. Fortunately, there isn't a large swath of objects to interact with so searching is decently short. It's a plus that the gameplay caters to both the person who will click on every interactable object just to see what's there and the person who just wants to get through the game, but the latter type of player will find the gameplay unpleasant.

It's clear that Settled is more focused on its story and setting, because both are quite well-done (if a bit thin at times). There are a few semi-traditional jumpscares, but they don't come out of nowhere - they're built up to using the environments you go through and the sounds you'll hear. Things moving out of the corner of your eye, minor graphical changes in an object you think you've seen over and over - it's the little touches that really give the game an eerie atmosphere. It's good, but nothing in this game is going to seem revolutionary. Without spoiling, blood and guts get thrown around pretty liberally but I sometimes wondered why it was even needed. This is where your tolerance of weirdness is really going to come in handy. The designer clearly has a good understanding of how to build atmosphere and move a story along in a way that feels genuinely strange and uncanny. The somewhat gratuitous blood doesn't always seem in line with that. People with a high tolerance for weird will probably enjoy the story and be able to forgive some of the weaker points in the narrative. You just want some well-made weirdness? You'll get a decent dose of it from this game.

Personally, I had a great time with the game. I like a good short experience and I always enjoy seeing a game with a good horror foundation. If that's what you want, give it a try.",1457471857,1457471857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i]Genre:[/i] Short Story-Driven Horror
[i]Developer:[/i] Allen Dayan
[i]Publisher:[/i] Allen Dayan
[i][u]Copy supplied by developer[/u][/i]

[b]Settled[/b] is a short story-driven horror game developed and published by Allen Dayan.

[h1]STORY[/h1]
To avoid spoling the plot, I'll just say that you play as a father whose daughter died some time ago, and he explores his house after hearing some strange noises.
While at first I wasn't all that into the story, after a while a constant state of dredd started creeping up on me, until I was fully invested on the f*cked up things that started happening in this game, till you get to the unsettling (albeit predictable) ending.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
Developed in Construct 2, the game's pixelated art style is very simplistic, while the hand-drawn look of the cutscenes delivers a more creepy vibe.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
Pretty simple: you walk around the house and you interact with highlighted objects. Again, the focus is on the story, and its gameplay is the best and easiest way to tell it.

[h1]SOUND[/h1]
Pretty weak: not that much of a soundtrack, and the sound effects are royalty-free. The game relies more on actual creepiness rather than jump scares.

[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]
Unfortunately, there are no achievements or hidden secrets: after 30 minutes, you are done playing this game.

If you are going to play this game, you are in for the story. If you like story-driven horror games that will unsettle you for a cheap price, then buy this game right now.

Only $2 but it's not 2spooky, just the regular amounts of spooky.

I'd suggest not reading all of these spoiler-laden reviews and just jumping right in. You can do worse with $2. 
It's not perfect (the plot is a bit thin) but it's not terrible and is pretty decent at buidling a spooky atmosphere.",1456857013,1456857013,True,6,0,0.601167857646942139,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you notice it's still running after you quit you need to CRTL+ALT+DEL > Task Manager > Close NSIC.exe or something along those lines. My playtime is really only 30 minutes despite the 25.9 hours being displayed.

This is probably a safety feature added by the developer to make sure people don't just beat the game in 30 minutes and Steam refund it afterwards.",1456809694,1457455277,True,14,7,0.599617958068847656,1,True,False,False,False,,,
