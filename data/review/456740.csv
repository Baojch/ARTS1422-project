So this is a puzzle platformer meant for VR. I don't think I would recommend this outside of the VR experience. The VR controls could use some refinement. You have to point your character to the location you want your contestant to go but often times you'll be pointing right at them as they get within line of sight and they will stop moving. However, I enjoyed the 3rd person views for the most part. You can easily adjust your viewpoint so that you always get a good view of the action and I recommend you do that often. I also liked how you can change the look of the contestant as you find items along the way. The game ran smoothly and the visuals were nice, although the environments (corridor after corridor) did get bland after a certain point.

I liked the puzzles. They start easy, but not too easy. And they slowly start to get more difficult. I liked the voices even if they were silly. I enjoyed the game show format, kept things light-hearted. Some reviewer mentioned how it didn't matter. Well, duh. It's a silly story meant to not be taken seriously. It's about the puzzles/platforming. And yeah they can be too easy if you're into difficult puzzle platformers. This isn't that. It's a casual game which will give casuals a challenge.

My main complaint are the controls and the repetitive corridor design. I don't think this game is worth $20. I got it for $6 and if you can find at that price or less and enjoy a light-heared puzzle platformer with enough difficulty, then I do recommend this. 

Rate 6/10. 

[i] Rant about the controls of this game from an Oculus user perspective (applies to other games as well):

I don't like how you have to press down on the joystick to jump on the right hand controller and it's another action on the left hand controller. I wish they had chosen A or X for jump and then Y or B for the ""use"" action. Instead, the current control scheme is clunky and cumbersome and I can tell it was designed with the HTC vive wands. I think the HTC Vive is a great VR system, but their motion controllers are not well-designed and I hope they go away from those controls in the near future and it messes up VR for the majority of users because devs till cater to the HTC vive wands. Also, Menu button for menu button instead of Y or B on Oculus. [/i]

Doctor Kvorak's Obliteration Game is the debut title from indie developers, Freekstorm. It's a three-dimensional puzzle platformer with a unique setting and a crazy sense of humour.

You begin the game taking control of Greeboo, a little blue guy who looks like he's made of plasticene. Doctor Kvorak introduces himself and dumps Greeboo in the game's hub. With only one avenue of exploration open to you, you take Greeboo through a portal and find yourself on a platform that's part of a game-show set floating in space. Orbiting around the set is a large yellowish planet.

Through a series of short (and not-so-short) monologues, which later turn into dialogues with a space chicken, you learn more about the ""Doctor"" and the rules of his strange game show. He's a god with a mischevious sense of humour, you see, and he's a bit bored, but still all powerful. So he's put together this game show with his collection of weirdly inhabited planets up for destruction.

Each stage in the show has a different planet that orbits about it. Depending on how well you complete the stage, you rescue or destroy the planet and all of its inhabitants.

[h1]==========================================================
----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Graphics - Doctor Kvorak's Obliteration Game supports VR hardware, but I don't have any, so I'm only able to review the non-VR version.

The character graphics are quite nice in an 'old-skool' raytracing sort of way, with plasticene-type models for the characters and shiny textures. Animations are quite nice, but I notice that the player character models have clipping issues where they intersect with level geometry, particularly when falling over.

The level graphics look less sophisticated, with each stage made out of repeated tiles of various sorts, with relatively simple textures and effects. Static and dynamic lighting is good, but the dynamic shadows for the characters are very pixelated, to the point where they're actually distracting in some situations.

There's a collection of graphics detail settings, together with full-screen/windowed mode toggle and resolution setting, but no vsync! I can hear my video card fan trying to levitate the PC.

Sound - The game features multiple music styles, all of them are electronic. The title track and some of the in-game music reminds me very much of a 1980s synthesiser tune, while the next track I heard sounded like a modern progressive house tune. The music suits the game well, though can get a bit repetitive after a while.

Sound effects are a bit weak, but do their job. Volume normalisation is pretty good, though the ""thump"" and ""ow"" sounds when you fall and hit the floor are a bit loud, as well as being slightly unsynchronised with the animations.

The game features speech. This is mostly monologues from Doctor Kvorak, who sounds professionally acted, albeit with a hilarious accent. There's a space chicken who pops in frequently, too, who is rather more annoying to listen to.

Gameplay - Doctor Kvorak is a physics-based 3D puzzle platformer. You walk along various platforms, standing on switches or moving blocks to change components of the level: open doors, or raise or lower stairs or platforms, for example. Your options for controlling Greebo (and later, Mikmak and Tiktok) are fairly limited: move, jump, or interact with various objects in the stage. There's no tutorial provided at all, and the control help is strangely only available from the main menu, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of the basics.

The game comprises 15 stages, each with a different planet to destroy or save. The first level has you collecting cheese and rescuing (or melting) the cheesey inhabitants of a big yellowish planet. The second progresses to a green slime planet, and so on. Each of the early stages, at least, introduces a new platform puzzle type or two, but they're mostly variants of the same thing: moving boxes onto floor switches.

Within each stage are 10 'saviour stones'. These fit together to cover a little 3D replica of the stage's planet. Collect them all and finish the stage and the planet is saved. Finish the stage without collecting them all and the planet is doomed. It doesn't actually matter which you do in order to progress, but I felt rather bad when I burned the poor little slime creatures to a crisp on my first try. You can always go back and replay a stage, but bear in mind that there is no intra-stage saving available, so make sure you have the time available to play through the whole thing.

Each stage also has 50 other collectibles that represent the inhabitants of the stage's planet: cheese in the first level, slime in the second, and so on. I'm not sure of the relevance of these, since you advance to the next level regardless of whether you've managed to collect them all.

The final type of collectible is completely irrelevant to progression, but there are some achievements related to it: wardrobe items. Each alien can be decked out with hats, accessory items, and clothes or skin changes. My favourite so far, though I collected it quite early on, is the see-through skin!

The game has some niggly issues. In a physics-based platform puzzler you ideally want the physics to be spot on. This game does't quite nail it; I've seen a few weird collisions between physics objects that don't react like they should and I've managed to get boxes that I'm pushing stuck or colliding with sections of floor that should be flat. Being unable to jump against level geometry is a bit weird, too -- I've found that sometimes a step back is required to actually get into the air.

The other issues I encountered are related to the game's controls. The store page claims full controller support, but it appears that you need a mouse to be able to navigate some of the menus properly. The controls are quite odd to use, too, with a controller definitely being recommended for better control of your character in the game, but the mouse being FAR better to use for camera controls. I ended up playing mostly with a controller, but not bothering to try to position the camera unless I couldn't see anything of what was going on.

The ""ow"" animation is a bit slow and annoying, too. It should be much faster, or interruptible.

-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Pros:
+ Doctor Kvorak is great
+ Good music
+ Excellent grammar!
+ Steam Achievements
+ VR support, but not required

Cons:
- The physics can be a bit wonky
- No mid-level saves
- Repetitive puzzles
- Control issues
- No vsync

[h1]==========================================================
--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Doctor Kvorak's Obliteration Game is a reasonably solid entry in the puzzle-platform genre, but the puzzles are quite repetitive and, in non-VR mode, camera control is not fun. It has a few niggly issues that prevent it from being a true classic, but anyone with a sense of humour who's in the mood for some basic platforming puzzles should find quite a few hours' enjoyment here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Come on lads, it’s almost time . . . you don’t want to miss the start of the most popular gameshow in the galaxy! This new contestant, a blueish creature that wobbles around looking strange, I reckon is going to obliterate everything. Shhhhh, here comes Doctor Kvorak - I am so excited! “Welcome to Kvorak’s Oblitaration Game and let me introduce you to our latest participant . . . YOU!” 

Doctor Kvorak’s Obliteration Game is a puzzle / platformer game where you control one or several contestants (depending how far along you are in the game) who will decide the fate of the planets. You’ll either save or destroy them.

This game can be played on VR and none VR systems. Personally, I played three hours on a VR setup and three hours on a non-VR, to get a good feel of what the game has to offer on both options. 

Your host, Doctor Kvorak is an interesting character, to say the least. He thoroughly enjoys talking about himself (don’t we all) and how smart he is. He also has a thick German accent, which made me laugh the first time I heard him.  When you launch the game, your character will spawn on these suspended rocks and only a few of them will be connected to each other via a see-through blue bridge. Move your character to one of the connected rocks and start your level or zone. As you progress, you’ll unlock new paths to the next suspended rock.

The gameplay is really fun whichever way you play it, VR or not. Essentially, you have to pick ten pieces of the planet and reach the big red teleporting platform at the end of the stage to save it. If you don’t, the planet will be destroyed. They are fifty other collectable items to pick up per zone and several artefacts as well to unlock skins for your characters. The zones (levels) are well-designed, and it will take you between twenty to forty minutes to finish the first few. Then it will become slightly longer and harder.  Manoeuvre blocks on tiles with symbols and flick switches to activate stairs or doors. Some of the blocks self-destruct when you touch them, so be careful not to stand too close or you’ll die. The other ways of dying are if your characters drop off the platform and fall into space, or if they are touched by lightning bolts, cannons or others obstacles. If you’re going to play the game in VR, what I really enjoy is the spacy atmosphere when you look around. It’s very easy to control your aliens, and they’ll occasionally look at you when passing by, which is funny and cute. Top down view setup and the camera movements are fine. Non-VR, you see your character in third person. I find the camera control not as good as the VR experience but fine. Apart from that, I really enjoy the game either way.

The graphics are fine and the soundtrack is fun. Plenty of contents and it will take you a while to save all the planets. I personally think that the puzzles should have been slightly harder.

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

-	Nice graphics
-	Can be played on VR and none VR setup
-	Three characters to control
-	Over fifteen planets (zones) to beat or save
-	Fun puzzles
-	Egocentric host with a heavy German accent ;)
-	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~
 
-	No trading cards
-	Should have been slightly harder in regards to the puzzles

Overall, I really enjoy this game either on a VR and none VR setup. Itz Timez for you to playz the gamez!

Much appreciated!

Despite the free key I would like to be as objective and honest as possible in my review.

This game is a puzzler where you play the role of an alien, tasked with either obliterating or saving a series of planets that have been earmarked for destruction by an ever-living thick-Euro-accented demigod: Dr. Kvorak. You do this by completing a series of increasingly difficult levels which involve collecting, platforming, tributes to the great Valve title 'Portal', and a fair share of thinking outside of the box. To save a planet you must collect all of the representative pieces of a globe of that planet throughout the level. To destroy it, you can safely ignore these globe pieces. Suffice it to say the difficulty in saving each planet is part of the challenge in my opinion, though I'd like to go back and be a ruthless destroyer of worlds!

Throughout the experience of playing you will be talked-at by Dr. Kvorak (and a giant chicken, but I'll leave that for you to find for yourself) - who does rather like to talk about himself, and how oh-so-well you are doing - for an alien - and how he's a generally all-round great guy. Kind of reminds me of Zaphod Beeblebrox from Douglas Adams' Hitch-Hikers Guide series... 

The immediate thing several people picked-up on while I was streaming this is the relatively aged-looking graphics. And I would be a fool to try and argue otherwise. That said - this game was developed entirely by a single person over the course of several years, and the graphical quality does not itself deter one from enjoying the game. But if you are entirely dependent on having a modern-looking game, then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere, though I'd still encourage folks to try this!

Looking beyond graphics, the gameplay is surprisingly tight, you will curse at yourself for the occasional blip where you struggle to jump or fall off of something without hurting yourself, but when you get an idea of what is and isn't allowed, you'll begin to think in the way the game expects you to, and you'll quickly get into puzzle-solving mode. 

During my 6-hour stream of this game, I imagine I got about a third of the way through the game, though the difficulty level was certainly mounting up, and I had only just unlocked a new character, so will have to see what he's all about..!

This will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is fun, wholesome entertainment that I feel folks ought to have a stab at.

+ Catchy soundtrack
+ Visually the game looks very nice
+ Seemingly has a lot of content / levels

- The gameplay was not fun for me.  Each level you essentially solve a bunch of very basic puzzles which involve pushing blocks onto switches, activating pressure pads, moving stuff, and finding ways to jump on platforms. After a very short while it gets to be reptitive and very mundane.
- Your character walks very slowly making the entire game overly drawn-out.
- Poor voice acting. I believe there is supposed to be humor in the dialogue, but it's hard to follow behind the characters heavy accents.
- The concept or story behind the game is simply weird and poorly setup. Basically, you are a contestant in game show, and you must collect these fragments (like puzzle pieces) while you are going through each maze of puzzles. At the end if you collect them all the ""planet"" is saved, if you don't it's destroyed... but there's literally no reward or penalty for doing either one so I really didn't understand the point of the game.",1501148488,1501148581,False,10,0,0.516747415065765381,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Doctor Kvoraks Obliteration Game is a fairly well done puzzle/platformer and while it's not my favorite genre, the little green cheese god left me entertained.

I had seen a bit of DKOG a while ago and was worried about the motion controls and how they would be handled. To my surprise they were very natural. The only issues coming when I wanted precise movement.

Some of the camera controls may be a bit iffy but I did set the VR comfort level to high which might have had some impact on that.

There was some lag during certain interactions, mostly with menus. Other than that everything was pretty smooth.

The devs have stated that the campaign should take more than 10 hours. With the time it took me to burn through the first level and seeing how many other levels there are I'd say that's a pretty fair estimate.

We all love VR but lets face it the games are all very similar, you have cockpit shooters, you have wave based shooters, or you have your adventure down dark corridors. That is not to say that such experiences are not good, some of my favorite games fit into those categories, but it is nice to play something different. Doctor Kvorak’s Obliteration Game (man that is a long title) is a 3d platform / puzzle game in first person but controlling a character in third person….yeah i tried wording that a few ways and could not really find the right words lol. Basically you are controlling a small alien around an arena while in a view i often refer to as “god eye” think populus, black and white or even command and conquer and you will know what i mean. The game itself is really good, and the interaction you see with Doctor Kvorak (and a rhyming chicken) made me smile a lot, the devs have put some good character into the Doctor (well good may not be the right word ...he did want to use an entire planet of cheese people to make toasted cheese sandwiches) 


[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICS[/b]
 
The presentation of the arenas are done very well, you can see around it pretty easy and at no point did i feel like things were too hidden up. 
You have complete movement around the map so those with more forward thinking ability than I can plot out what is needed to do between each checkpoint in advance, talking of checkpoints, they are VERY well placed and at no time did i feel like i had lost too much progress on death (Doctor Kvorak will not let your little guy stay dead for long anyway :) ) 
The puzzles themselves are well done and can be bypassed via interactive mode should you get stuck (i actually held back a bouncing electrical ball of death to let the little guy i was controlling get based unscathed, but the developer has also said you could theoretically cheat ( errr i mean creatively bend the rules) and lift the little fella over the barriers :) so you should never get truly stuck! (If you believe that temptation would be too great you can play it non interactively) 
Movement for you is handled in two ways, the primary movement is to teleport, but you can also grab the world and move it around you, the latter takes a bit of getting used to and personally i only used it to realign my view with how i wanted and mainly teleported.
Movement for your little vr friend (you are gonna want to pet him, trust me on this) is done cursor style, you point your laser where you want him to go, and you can make him jump and press buttons all with the controller. 
The actual graphics are perfect for the game and the detail on the little guy is very cool (a little too detailed if you switch his skin for fur...oh did i not mention? You can unlock new skins and accessories for him as you progress :) ) 
To add to the arena atmosphere when the host (captor?) Doctor Kvorak appears he also appears on a big screen complete with subtitles as does Eggloot the bird.


[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] 

Make sure to turn some of the settings down, and avoid using the fur unless you have a REALLY good pc, however it should be noted that i was playing an unreleased version (which was also being recorded in HD) and as such the performance will improve, it also, when configured, had less problems than some of the longer released games i played, at no point did i really feel the performance issues were affecting the game too much to play.

[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] 

Well it is a puzzle game so in that sense you will have to do some thinking but the main controls are intuitive (though i confess i had no idea how to pick up the little fella until the devs told me, that is something that is easily fixed with a tutorial image though)

[b]PROS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] Excellent character development/personality.
[*] Lovable creature to help through the levels.
[*] Well made arenas.
[*] Unique game for VR.
[*] Shows how well “God view” works in VR, hope to see more games utilising this view.
[*] There is a rhyming chicken...ok so this is really part of the first pro, but i really liked how it was done.
[*] Developers that care about the game and want it to entertain players (this is not a shovelware title, i really get the feeling the devs are not in it for the money) 
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] Performance on high detail (or fur) is not the greatest *again note though this is from an unreleased build.
[/list]

[b]VIdeo[/b]

This is actually a placeholder video as i wanted to get the review ready for the game’s release date expect a better video (or at least a less rushed one) in the next couple of weeks.

[b]VERDICT[/b] 

If you are looking to take a break from the usual type of VR games, or a fan of puzzle games then this is an instant purchase. This may be a development team to keep an eye out for too, there are a few Indie devs who are really committed to making good games and these guys certainly fall into that category.

Сами разработчики называют своё творение ядрёной смесью фильма ""Бегущий человек"" (The Running Man) и игры Portal, и с ними сложно поспорить, пускай сперва сходство малозаметно. От первого источника вдохновения позаимствовали идею безжалостной телепередачи, в которой ставки настолько высоки, что проигрыш неизменно приводит к гибели людей (в данном случае - разумных существ), а от второго - замороченные и комплексные паззлы с ворохом головоломок, завязанные на логике и законах физики.

Поначалу меня выбила из колеи графика - она мне показалась попросту вырвиглазной и хаотичной. Но, как оказалось, к ней очень быстро привыкаешь, а потом яркая цветовая гамма и вовсе начинает казаться удобной: активные объекты и подконтрольные персонажи резко выделяются на общем фоне при любом ракурсе камеры, поэтому ориентироваться довольно просто. Да и странно надеяться на выдающийся вкус космического тирана.

Но самое крутое в Doctor Kvorak's Obliteration Game - это, конечно же, абсурдистский юмор. Сам титульный доктор Кворак разговаривает с чудовищным акцентом, а ещё у него есть помощница - огромная курица в белом скафандре. Ну а самая моя любимая часть - это комментарии пришельца-разрушителя по поводу особых призов (дорогу к ним искать и прокладывать вроде бы необязательно, но неизменно интересно и порой ""челленджево""). Например, когда я случайно разблокировал эксклюзивный телевизор планетарных габаритов, Кворак поздравил меня в характерной манере, и рассказал, что теперь я могу до бесконечности любоваться его авторским фильмом про разрушение миров на самом большом экране в галактике. Снова, снова и снова... и снова.

Сами головоломки кажутся элементарными, но впоследствии приобретают в глубине и сложности. А когда вам дают под управление несколько персонажей, то игра резко становится сложнее. В том смысле, что вам приходится держать в памяти кучу различных процессов и событий. Да и с каждым новым уровнем всё труднее становится собирать коллекционные ""артефакты"" и ""осколки"" планет. Первые нужны в основном для того, чтобы потешить своё самолюбие и разблокировать какие-нибудь дикие предметы гардероба для главных героев, а от вторых зависит итог прохождения этапа и то, выживет ли мир со всем его население или Кворак спалит его дотла.

Паззлы всегда решаются при помощи стандартных логики и смекалки, на простой перебор вариантов и чистое везение рассчитывать не стоит. И это здорово! Нет ничего хуже, когда разработчики признаются в собственной неспособности придумать интересную и комплексную, но интуитивную механику, и оставляют решение на откуп счастливому случаю.
Первый конфликт

Но если вы решили, что картина вырисовывается слишком радужная, то добавлю-ка ложку дёгтя. Например, игра готова похвастаться не самым удобным управлением. Персонажи ощущаются довольно неповоротливыми и отзываются на команды с небольшой, но заметной задержкой (речь о геймпаде) - это неизбежно приводит к ошибкам, когда необходимо чётко и последовательно выполнить цепочку заданных действий.

Ещё забавные инопланетяне обожают падать с платформ и мостиков в открытый космос, но, к счастью, за подобное никакими штрафами не наказывают. Стоит упомянуть и не самую удобную камеру: её можно самостоятельно приближать и удалять, но угол обзора она порой выдаёт странный, да и на манипуляции с ней уходит приличное количество времени. Плюс минималистичный интерфейс следует поругать за неинформативность: после пары-тройки неудач и последующих телепортаций на контрольную точку вы легко можете запутаться в инвентаре, который никак не отображается. Возникает закономерный вопрос: остались ли в запасе энергетические блоки и батарейки, или за ними снова нужно чесать через половину карты?

Ваше восприятие происходящего в Doctor Kvorak's Obliteration Game целиком и полностью зависит всего от двух вещей: желания не только поломать голову, но и от отношения к мрачным шуткам и от желания вникать в пространную болтовню обаятельного злодея, обожающего подробно рассказывать о планетах. Если оба условия соблюдены, а вы способны отвлекаться от выполнения насущных задач ради того, чтобы послушать искромётные монологи и диалоги, то смело покупайте игру.",1501087535,1501087741,True,15,0,0.631055772304534912,3,False,True,False,False,,,
