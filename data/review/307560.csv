Now, there are some games from 2014 that still look very respectable today (Assassin's Creed: Unity, Dragon Age: Inquisition etc), and then there's this.  This was never a great game.  It wasn't then, it isn't now. 

Gameplay consists of turn based tactical unit moving on a small grid (the grid is small enough that I believe this was intended for the primitive emerging tablet and smartphone market, yet is on PC today for some reason).  The developers somewhat misleadingly advertise this as ""chess like"", that's probably too ambitious.  You move units around and each unit has different attack ranges and viable attack targets (like 3 squares in a row in front of the unit etc), so careful placement of units is a factor, but it's the RPG elements that are pivotal (hit points, attack damage, the usual).  

The presense of RPG like attributes to the units doesn't make this a deep or rich game, however, the gameplay is fairly shallow as far as turn based strategy games go.  I could mention there's a comedy/pirate theme but that's just a lazy veneer on a lazy game. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game features somewhat lazy, simplistic ""retro"" looking 2D graphics, and it's hard to say if this is due to the age of the assets used, if it's a deliberate attempt for the game to look bad/retro on purpose, or if the assets are just, well, terrible looking.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game in 2024, such poor quality 2D graphics in the 3D era just aren't good enough, whether it's a deliberate design fault on behalf of the developer or they just couldn't manage to do any better, this is a compromise gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The game only displays in 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio.  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes Run For Rum might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

So, should you buy this game?

Run For Rum has the comically over-optimistic price of around $4 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

TLDR: Tabletported quality. Recycled pirate sprites get battered on with your fists, turn based. HOMM style mini arenas with random obtacles. Inept UI.

This is a mobile optimized style tactics game in which you pummel the same pirates over and over with your fist, there is no options menu, and it does not have profiles and no way to wipe the data. All hallmarks of mobile origins. The game takes a long time to cycle through the various phases of every turn. The arenas are always small and with one or two pieces of junk thrown in the scenery as lame obstacles. Because the UI is inept you must click a bunch of times to do the most basic actions, the landscapes in tactics mode are featureless and empty. The characters look like cheap flat outdated 2D comic book type sprites. The game is full of silly references to naruto, pokemon and other kiddish things.",1494316320,1509676851,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I figure, it's got to be better than what the other guys wrote who spent 30 minutes in the game, right?

[i]Last things first, this is a decent casual turn-based strategy game with break-sized battles, and I don't regret getting this on the current ""75% off"" sale.[/i]

First off, this game has language settings for english, spanish, brazilian portugese and [b]pirate[/b] - the latter is workable and fits the theme of the game well. Also, it's not lying when it boasts low minimum specs. To test it out, I dusted off my 8-year-old machine, and it works without a hitch; it's only a 141 MB download, so it is really quick to set up.

I mentioned you get 20 levels (plus random encounters) of small-arena turn-based strategic combat. At first you only get your brawlers (and a 5x5 playing field), but level 6 opens up archers, and wizards and healers come into the game at level 9 (you're up to 10x10 by level 10). The difficulty's pretty forgiving, and so far I've had no opportunity to set the difficulty level (I guess I could just select weaker units, or try to beat the game from start to finish without replaying levels), but for people who are newer to this genre the size of the battles and the difficulty will be just right. 

As a ""seasoned pro"" in this genre, what attracts me is the silliness in the characters I'm playing; the battle system is decent, and the interface is slightly clunky, but workable once you have figured out that the fighter portraits have a) the damage display integrated as dark shadows, and b) tell you about everyone's special moves once you click on the portrait. So, yes, casual, I wasn't agonizing over strategy and don't expect I will be: I get to select up to 5 units, have a slightly wacky battle (for example, one enemy brawler *is* armed with a fish) (and you do get to select one of the enemy team for your side after each battle) that last a few minutes, and that's that.

For a bargain game, that's all I need. Recommended.

------

Notes:

The HP of your team can be qickly assessed by looking at the unit portraits in the bottom corners (click on them to see details and special moves) - a good solution since the status effect are already above the units' heads.

You can do two actions per unit per turn, but some of them have cooldowns (standard attack has 1 turn, so you get 1 attack per turn). Having to budget one action point for changing the direction a unit is facing is a tactical challenge -- you can move sideways and avoid it, and you can use the fact that the enemy has to turn as well to creep up on him from two sides. This is good!

AI was 10-15 seconds per turn at most on my slow machine, and it is slowed down mostly so you can see what is happening on the battlefield.

Combat maps are mostly square grids with some obstacles.

The visuals aren't much to look at, but I like the character designs. Story is neglible, but I wasn't buying this game for that - get Scott  Lynch's novels if you want to read excellent pirate fiction!",1413854308,1413910498,True,33,0,0.756319701671600342,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I will preface this review by stating that I could not get more than 30 minutes into it.  But what I did see in my time with this game is horrible enough to make me want to willingly walk away from this $5 purchase so as to not also waste more time than I already have.

Gameplay -  Clunky and unresponsive, you have to fight the UI.  There is no confirmation on your target if the enemies are bunched together, and the game provides no above head HP bar to your enemies for quick assessment of unit vitality.  Also the game play and movement are a chore, you get two actions per turn, one being a move and one an action, or two movements if you do not feel like taking an action.  the problem comes with the fact that turning your character is not included in movement and you must spend a second movement (thus ending your chance to attack) just to turn your character towards your enemy.   This is frustrating because it makes positioning and strategy not intuitive at all.

Game speed - REDICULOUSLY SLOW.  This further compounds your problems of the UI and Movement because every action takes a long time and AI decisions take a long time. (10-15 seconds per unit).

Combat Maps - Bland and very claustrophobic. I guess the claustrophobic aspect is a good thing considering how moving your character is such a pain in the ass.  

Story - Seems to be written by a child who enjoys Adventure Time since they try to reference it at least twice in the first 10 minutes.   I couldnt stomach this game for more than 30min.  At $5 a little more effort should be put in.


Visuals - The art itself is ok, but there is little movement in the sprites, it makes the whole game feel wooden and unalive.

Conclusion -  I cannot see anyone truly liking this game unless they are hard up for a Turn-based RPG and have no other choice.  I cannot recommend this game.",1404325582,1404326189,False,87,0,0.718863964080810547,4,True,False,False,False,,,
