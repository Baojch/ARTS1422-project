Play these games as an adult, you'll wonder what kind of brain damaged monkey was behind the games and the best thing you'll say is that it's a poor man's Sonic.

Yet… I have fond memories of coming home from school, and finding my dad intoxicated cursing in frustration at this game.

I played this a lot as a kid, and I'm going to be honest, I loved it, I'm actually amazed at how much others hated it. Sure everything that’s said about it, is true, it’s generic, it has a stack of cheap deaths, it moves way too fast if you let it, the camera isn't perfect. but when I was a kid, I couldn't perceive any of this, I just saw the character and the world, and was drawn to it, and as I was playing it, I learned and grew as a player so none of these things bothered me, heck I didn't even notice them as 'problems'. 

Thing is, sure I died a lot, but then so did I in other games, I learned strategies to deal with all of this and I really enjoyed playing it. The annoyance at dying to everything in Bubsy, reminds me of people complaining that Dark Souls didn't have an easy mode. It didn't matter it was generic because it was one of an actual dozen games I had. They were the epitome of what we used to call ""rental games,"" as their limited charms could be digested in a few hours.

These games are totally ragged on and almost universally agreed to be bad examples of games from their era. Yet those people always overlook the positive aspects of this game and only focus on the bad things. Me and my dad always loved playing this game. The sense of speed was unparalleled (even by sonic) and actually made the momentum and speed a fun, if risky strategy. It was a cute, fun game with catchy music, but it was frustrating at times.

TBH most of the people crapping on Bubsy, are people that didn't grow up on the SNES; games like Super Mario RPG, Donkey Kong, etc were rare oddities... finding Bubsy for the SNES back then was like my first time finding Demon Souls; death was inevitable.

In conclusion, poor Bubsy… He played around with some controlled substances and got hooked to a life of sadness while his friends Mario and Sonic got ahead in life.

Sonic, however, has been on his way down the food chain and is on his way to join Bubsy. Meanwhile Mario is trying to help out Sonic with his troubles by giving him some good jobs in his latest Smash Brothers experience, but he keeps falling
back down from grace.

Mario never offered the same help to Bubsy and Bubsy sufffured for it. C’mon Bubsy let’s see you get back on your paws again!

If you enjoy platformers, souls like difficulty and fiendish traps that would be right at home in Dark Souls or any rogue like then this is the game for you. If you enjoy speedrunning then this game has everything you could ask for: momentum based gameplay that allows you to run faster than sonic, tight platforming controls to rival Mario and new paths and shortcuts that loop around in ways that give that satisfying souls feel.

This is literally the first game I ever played. 
Back then there was no easy way to find the level codes online so I never managed to beat the first 3 levels to get the first checkpoint, instead I just played those levels over and over for the small number of times I was able to play it at a friends house... and I loved it. It was my one long standing memory of something so difficult but also so captivating. I wanted to explore the game, every part of it was different, houses going up giant hills with cars, waterfalls with caves and tunnels that would teleport you around, water slides and SUPER fast paced (to you own peril). 

Now, 22 years later I'm back to finish the job with a new perspective, experiences and wisdom.......
is what I would say if I hadn't just played for an hour, died 50+ times with 4 game overs but my god the feeling of finally beating those first 3 levels was so worth the wait.....

Wait... THERES 16 LEVELS!?

-No replay value

Сами игры напоминают что-то среднее между Соником и Марио - с разгоном бежим направо, собираем предметы, прыгаем на голову врагам, через природно-техногенные преграды добираемся до финиша. На определенных этапах пути предусмотрено автосохранение.

[u]Техническая реализация Steam-версии[/u]
Эмулятор SNES, развертывающийся в прямоугольнике и умеющий в ALT+TAB (но с обрезками по бокам).
Доступно 9 слотов сохранения в любых точках, можно самоназначать клавиши управления.
Параметр сглаживания картинки ""Smoothing"" сажает зрение!

[u]Описание игр[/u]

[b]BUBSY in: CLAWS ENCOUNTERS OF THE FURRED KIND[/b] (1992 о.-р.г.)
Сюжета для затравки нет.
16 уровней, 5 миров, 7 музыкальных композиций.
Бежим на время с 9 дополнительными жизнями, собираем по дороге клубки ниток, давим каких-то шоколадных зайцев, шарахаемcя от машин и автоматов по продаже конфет...

[b]BUBSY II[/b] (1993/1994 о.-р.г.)
Начинаем игру в какой-то лаборатории и через порталы путешествуем по разным эпохам из 30-ти уровней.
Теперь у нас всего 3 жизни, но Бабс гибнет гораздо дольше. К несчастью, игра бесповоротно заканчивается в момент самого последнего издыхания - и начинай всё по-новой!
Вместо клубков - какие-то то драже, а среди недругов - дерзкие и опасные пингвины, овцы, свиньи...
На определенных картах возможно путешествие на летательном аппарате. Дальше, возможно - больше...

От оценки откажусь - не фанат жанра, просто немного игранул во что-то из 90-х.

敵によっては上から踏んづけても殺されるのもあります。
ステージギミックも、「触れてもいい物」と「触れると死亡する物」の区別がきちんとできず、理不尽な感じです。

[*] Статус : висит...
[/list]
 Увидев в стиме эту игру естественно сразу купил, тем более по скидке. Игра родом с приставки Сега и в принципе является на ней довольно хорошим приключенческим платформером.
 Без преувеличения можно сказать что Bubsy является неким аналогом Сонику, хоть и проигрывает по графике и экшену(да и по музыке тоже), ведь все элементы игры идентичны: вместо колец - клубки(ведь мы играем котом), уровни тоже большие, так же идет время(9 мин), правда игра менее динамична, есть секреты(секретные места, где лежит майка, т.е. жизнь), чекпоинты, так же можно быстро перемещаться, только здесь такие перемещения очень опасны, и поэтому приходится останавливаться и так скажем ""прицеливаться"". 
 Игра довольно сложна(один удар и всё ужин готов, сушите вёсла сэр) и нужно знать механику иначе труба, присутствует много трамплинов, ""ловушек"", а так же живности, которая то прыгает,то сморкается в платочек, а иногда и в вас :-), периодически пролетает курица несушка и бомбардирует яйцом, вот мамаша...и Бог знает что ешо в Вас может шлёпнуться. К сожалению на Сеге я не смог её пройти, терпения не хватило...но лучше естественно проходить на эмуляторе, где есть сэйвы, и квадраты графики замылены спец фильтром. Музыка если честно ничем не запомнилась, хотя прикольно для Сеги звучат оцыфрованные высказывания котейки ))).
 Однако игра наполнена особой атмосферой и достойна внимания, как тогда в далёкие 90е, так и сейчас поклонники олдскулла думаю не оставят её без внимания...

The best way to explain Bubsy is if you placed Sonic on constant ice physics, made him go 0 to 60 in 0.5 seconds, and made him the most annoying, nasalie Melvin in existence.

These games didn't age well.  It doesn't look great, it's rough to control, and unforgiving in difficulty.  Unless you want to relive the magic of playing these on the SNES, there's no great reason to buy these.

[h1]Playing as a cat - 20/20[/h1]
You play as an anthropomorphic cat named Bubsy.

[h1]Acting like a cat - 5/20[/h1]
You do collect yarn, and some of the animations resemble something you might see in a Tom & Jerry cartoon.  Other than that, this is a pretty generic platformer that happens to use a cat sprite.

The developers were too focused on making Bubsy ""cool"" (or whatever passed for cool in 1993 and really didn't make him cute at all.  

[h1]Polish - 5/20[/h1]
This is pretty much a direct port from SNES, and it didn't age well.  You can see so little of the level around you for how fast you move and how many things can kill you.  The controls and movement feel sloppy, frustrating, and not forgiving enough.

I hate to give a thumbs down, this is my childhood, but game is unplayable for ME PERSONALLY for some reason :( .

SOMEBODY PLEASE HALP; add a comment here if you know a fix, or atleast what the problem might be. I would love to properly relive bubsy.

Game runs at like 25-33% speed with major choppyness and audio distortions (audio cutting/tearing to compensate the 25-33%ish game speed).  Game intro sequence runs normally but as soon as I get into the game its unplayable.

* I am running windows 10.
* I have the latest DirectX version.
* AMD Ryzen 5 1500x quad-core processor.
* Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Graphics card.
* 16GB RAM
* SSD

My machine should be more than capable x'D.

Bubsy wasn't always the much hated mascot he is now, entirely the fault of Bubsy 3D. In fact, the first game in this collection, Claws Encounters Of The Furred Kind, was highly anticipated in the video gaming community before release, and received some decent reviews at the time. It was one of the only games in the series based under the stewardship of Bubsy's creator, Michael Berlyn, and is generally considered the bobcat's finest hour, in that it's a fully playable game that, though definitely challenging, is at least fair and decently easy to comprehend.

Bubsy 2, on the other hand, was created without Michael Berlyn, and done by a team that apparently hated Bubsy with a passion. The resulting game, whilst featuring some improvements on the first game, such as a lifebar and a level select system, is almost incomprehensible in places. Though I have not yet consulted a walkthrough, I have been unable to finish a single level of the sequel, which I was able to do in the first one with minimal help. Also, the level select system is a double edged sword, as it means that you're left uncertain about which order (if any) you should do each level in. Perhaps I may get more enjoyment if I were able to figure this out, but at the moment I am perplexed by Bubsy 2.

This review is a recommendation for Bubsy 1, with Bubsy 2 as an extra that you'll probably have more luck with than I did. It's something of an underrated game for the SNES, and I personally get a kick out of some of the creative animations and ideas that were shown here. One piece of advice, though: Use the save state function a lot if you're not good at dodging stuff. The one-hit death is the game's one detriment, which can thankfully be overturned by making save states to go back to when you die. Some would call that cheating, but eh, this is Bubsy we're talking about.",1593472815,1593472815,True,3,0,0.523481249809265137,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The package here on Steam seems to be the SNES ports when really they should have given us the PC version of the games (or, at least, the first) with all of the extras that came along with it, such as the soundtrack album and pilot episode of the TV show.

Playing the games with the keyboard is just awkward and clumsy, especially as the first game was badly programmed with some of the worst collision detection I've ever seen. You'll constantly be losing lives in the cheapest way possible and I understand now how so many gamers got frustrated with this back in the day. Bubsy 1 punishes you for enjoying high speed with millions of one-hit deaths while the bobcat himself is floaty and sluggish. Bubsy 2 fixes this somewhat - the weird inertia that pulls him in directions you don't want to go is gone and Bubsy can take some hits before dying, but the level design is confusing and not fun to navigate through.

There's no achievements (you won't stick with the games long enough to earn them) but there are trading cards, though I can't help think of this package as a cynical cash-grab from the licence holders.

В первой игре рысь Бабзи останавливает инопланетян от похищения с Земли шариков ткани.
Во второй части вы можете сами выбирать уровни, куда пойдёте, но пройти их надо все.
Чем же отличается Бабзи от других похожих платформеров? Адская сложность. Ваш герой бегает быстрее Соника, но всё, что на вашем пути, собирается убить вас. Да, одно повреждение и вы мертвы. Даже падение с высоты убивает. Во второй части к этому ещё добавляется запутанный дизайн уровней.
Эмулятор поддерживает Квик-сейвы, но довольно коряво, не всегда работает. Без квик-сейвов ИГРА НЕПРОХОДИМА!!!
Я прошёл обе игры и матерился довольно долго на куче моментов. Один из самых сложных платформеров на моей памяти.

Well, Bubsy, the fact that your first two games are unfair, barely playable garbage. Never before in my life have I wished I had never touched a 2D platformer...

Where to start... 

I'll start with Bubsy 1 and how just unfair it is. Bubsy moves like he's on ice, and I can NEVER get control of him when he's airborne. I don't know if this is the emulator or if the controls are just this horrible. The game gives you almost NO warning that something is a stage hazard. I got killed by what... I think was a sewer pipe, thinking it was a platform like you'd see in Mario and Sonic. I literally thought I died because I had jumped into something above me. And DO NOT get me started on that bullshit fall damage mechanic... I can understand if it was put in an RPG or something to that extent... BUT NOT IN A 2D PLATFORMER.... Especially when you die in a single hit from anything. I literally ended up giving up by stage 5 and that was after reloading my save state multiple times. I'm not complaining because of difficulty. I love Ninja Gaiden and Contra, but the point is, unlike Bubsy, Contra and Ninja Gaiden are actually fun.

If I had to say one good thing about Bubsy 1... The music was pretty awesome. That's one thing I have to give Bubsy credit for. The 2D Bubsy games always had wonderful music.

Now for Bubsy 2... Take the same unfair gameplay of Bubsy 1 along with the awkward controls, but the devs at least had the courtesy to let you die if you took a few hits instead of just one. But... If it wasn't for that... I would write Bubsy 2 off as completely unplayable.

Buy this only if you have about $5 to blow and want to see how long it takes you to have to go to the psych ward from the nervous breakdown these games will give you.",1546580598,1546580598,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Первая часть игры самая замечательная на мой взгляд, только сейчас спустя много лет я ее прошел, разные майки которые дают плюсы Bubsy много разных врагов и конечно же Woolies, которые будут кривляться бросаться яйцами и прыгать в неподходящий момент.(Бесит)

Во второй части игры внимание было уделено персонажам, которые были показаны в мультфильме, соответственно племяннички, которые мешкают по экрану во время босса и друг броненосец, которым в мини игре вы управляете в двигателе тягача, по мультфильму он так боится его, что он ему даже снится. Во второй части даже музыкальные инструменты будут против вас не смотря на мумий, козлов, свиней, пингвинов, белок-летяг и (барабанная дробь) БАБОЧЕК, врагов здесь еще больше чем в первой части но про Woolies забудьте, они на несут визит в другой раз...

I had little choice but to play this game as a kid, as it was one of the only SNES games I owned as a kid. And even then, I only got it because it was a bargain bin game. To my parents, cheaper meant better. And I wasn't able to get very expensive games very often.

Even back then as a kid, I could tell it was a bargain bin game that my parents got me because they were cheap and couldn't tell a difference in quality. A game was a game.

And I definitely saved my money up for Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, and it was a stellar, cinematic, near flawless experience that kept me playing and enamored and immersed for months. And is still one of the best platformers of all time, possibly the best. It's certainly my favourite. And it achieves some things that I believe even Tropical Freeze doesn't, such as better character balance, more and better verticle level design, and more cinematic level design. Tropical Freeze is a masterpiece, and rightfully thought of as such. But Tropical Freeze is Super Mario Galaxy 2 to Diddy's Kong Quest Galaxy 1. 

But I am really digressing here. This is a review of Bubsy, not of the Donkey Kong Country franchise.
Safe to say, once I got Donkey Kong Country games, particularly 2, I rarely looked back upon Bubsy.

Bubsy, is not even near, in the same league of other great 16-Bit platformers. And certainly not greatest of all time games in the genre like Donkey Kong Country 2, 3, Tropical Freeze, Mega Man X, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3, and ect.

It plays a bit like Sonic the Hedgehog 1, but with even less forgiving level design. And of a generally lesser quality.
The game is fast, but it also leads to cheap losses. And unlike Sonic, there isn't the fallback of having rings, you can spam every single time you get hit in classic Sonic with a few exceptions if you don't know what to do to get them back before they fade.

Even with the improvements in Bubsy 2 to having more than 1 hit, Bubsy is a very unforgiving game. And the level design does not accomidate this.

However, that isn't to say Bubsy can't be fun and doesn't have any merit. And isn't a game that should be preserved. The mechanics of playing as Bubsy feel good. Environments are varied and fun to look at and explore. And there's a surprising amount of charm to be found in these games. And something to be said about the, ableit dated, arcade feel of the game. That is, Bubsy is a game of trial and error of learning the level design. But so were a lot of classic arcade games. And there is fun to be had in learning the levels. And merit to be had in playing memorization based platformers. And learning the levels of Bubsy is a rewarding experience. Particarly with the aesthetic presentation and multitude of secrets each level provides.

That is to say, Bubsy is a decent memorization based platformer game. Much more fun in my opinion than ones intentionally trying to be aggravating and unintuitive for the humor. And can be a lot of fun to play. Very hard, and not always fair. But exploring and mastering the levels over multiple playthroughs, can be a very rewarding experience. And it was to me as a child. With all of its problems, Bubsy wouldn't have anything to stand on if Bubsy wasn't any fun to control. But he does, it is fun to move and jump around as Bubsy and the glide mechanic leads to some interesting and enjoyable scenarios not found in other platformers at the time.

Unfortunately, this isn't quite the most ideal preservation of this game. Of all things, the PC wasn't not ported at all as an option. And as someone who played only the SNES version as a kid, that is by far the version I am most nostalgic for. However, it would have been nice to have. And would have been good for game preservation. Neither the PC, Genesis, or any other versions of Bubsy are available here.

Also, the emulator uses is very limited and not so great. It pales in comparison to any modern emulators. I would not recommend using this emulator to play any other SNES roms, sadly. It does not compare to playing with RetroArch, bsnes, higan, Snes9x, or even ZSNES. I would recommend even, [b]buying this game to [u]have a legitimate SNES rom of the game[/u][/b], and then using a better emulator to play the game itself with. This game is definitely one of the best ways I would say, to have a real, legitimate rom in your collection you can prove you own. This is the best way to buy Bubsy. Using the rom with an alternative emulator, with either better features, or higher accuracy, may be the better way to play the game, however.

Overall, I recommend this game and do think it is well worth the purchase. Bubsy as a game series is underrated, and doesn't quite deserve all of the notoriety that it has, largely gotten from Bubsy 3D. I greatly appreciate legitimized roms and emulators like that, and preserving the game like this. It's definitely worth the few bucks it is being charged on Steam, and has several hours worth of fun to be had at least.

Do pick up this game if you have a few extra dollars to spare. It's worth having this piece of gaming history in your library.",1531511834,1531511834,True,8,0,0.639153659343719482,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Bubsy games are actually fun, you may even end up laughing sometimes when he dies, he would be like a 2d Crash Bandicoot, but more humble and with a number  of playability problems, also counting the annoying voice Bubsy has, so avoid dying often, when I said playability problems is because the games itselves has a number of problems, being that a number of them I guess are from the emulator, I don't know because I didn't played the console version of the games, so I can't say 100% for sure.

Bubsy I, the only flaws I found in the game are that the game has a weird physics system, let's say you are running to the right and jumps, moves your character to the left, releases the button, while in the air, the char moves slowly to the right, that often leads to mistake, like falling off cliffs or hitting an enemy, but also can be exploited, once I did a key play (pressing left and right alternativelly) while in the air, and ended up causing Bubsy to rocket through part of the stage when I activated the glide, I guess they tried to implement a by of physics in the game to make the game be more about speed, but by the fact Bubsy dies by being hit once, aswell as easily turning the direction when holding the oposite direction joystick frustrates that.

Bubsy II, the only flaw I'll list here is the most troublesome, you wont be able to play the game as it should be due to it, when Bubsy is running, for some reason, the game speeds up, the music goes faster, aswell as the frame rate in the game, so you end up losing control of the movement, If weren't by that, this game would be fine, It not only made Bubsy has a 3 hits tolerance when hurt by enemies, but also added new things to use in the game, like items, beside I had one problem to find out how to glide on it.

Now, is the game good to be played or not? Well, If you be able to deal with the physics problem with Bubsy I, then yes, the game is good to be played, now, If you expect enjoying Bubsy II, I guess you would had a better luck buying the console It was released for, aswell as the cartridge from a site of auction, or in case you don't want to spend much, buy this instead and deal with the problems, your choice.",1529563870,1529563870,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Beh, col senno del poi, tutto!

Bubsy è un franchise che nacque subito sotto una cattiva stella e morì, anche se immeritatamente, da str**** con l'atroce titolo per Playstation 1. Bubsy nacque dall'idea di Michael Berlyn e fu pompato massicciamente dalla Accolade nei primi anni '90 nel tentativo di sfondare quella allora redditizia fetta di mercato dominata da Sonic e da Mario: la lince antropomorfa dalla spiccata vena ironica, che nel progetto di Accolade doveva essere una mascotte multimediale, con merchandasing, un cartone animato a puntate e dei videogames, non riuscì mai a conquistare il mercato e dal suo fallimento dipese quello di Accolade stessa. Oggi i titoli di Bubsy vengono ingiustamente ricordati tutti come atroci: ciò è vero appunto per Bubsy 3D, rilasciato in fretta e furia, palesemente incompleto, per ""salvare il salvabile"" prima dell'uscita di Super Mario 64 e di Crash Bandicoot. Ma non per i precedenti per SNES e SMD, soprattutto il primo Bubsy non era poi così male come viene ricordato; tutt'altro, era un platform complicato già dai primi livelli e con un tasso di sfida elevato, con livelli sì dal design contorto ma molto lunghi e variegati, pieni di trappole e trabocchetti, ma anche di aree bonus ben nascoste. È vero, per i possessori di Mega Drive Bubsy era visto (non a torto) come un clone così così di Sonic, ma per i nintendari d'infanzia come me giocare ad un platform del genere, veloce e coloratissimo come i vari Sonic, con i vantaggi tecnologici dello SNES, era davvero una figata. Il secondo Bubsy invece era più lineare ma a mio avviso meno bello del precedente, anche perché il suo sviluppo non fu diretto da Berlyn ma da un dev team terzo che non aveva nessun interesse nel franchise se non economico.

Questo è un porting che emula le versioni per SNES, attraverso un emulatore SNES9x standalone con un filtro antialiasing molto semplice, ma non funziona a dovere: l'audio glitcha, di tanto in tanto ci sono cali di framerate massicci ed incomprensibili ed in generale si avverte un ritardo nei comandi. Alla fine, non vale il prezzo: è molto meglio un'emulazione come si deve con ad esempio zSNES con filtri addativi.",1515025139,1515025139,False,2,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My only major problems are that the audio has a mild issue, in which a cracking sound appears  every couple minutes or so and as for the gameplay itself; In the first game, it feels like Bubsy is running on ice 24/7, which gets really annoying at some points and you can get killed off-camera by certain obstacles since the camera is way too zoomed in on Bubsy. Speaking of things that can kill you, some seemingly innocent looking things can kill you as well, like a bubble gum machine or a brightly colored, round shaped innocent looking car, which is confusing as hell when you first play the game.

- Problems with the character stop moving

I had a cartridge of the first game on Sega Genesis as a kid, and it was honestly a fun game at the time. I had enjoyed all the unique animations Bubsy had for nearly any scenario, and he almost played like a Saturday Morning Cartoon character in the sense that he was very... animated, I guess is the word.

As one who grew up playing Sonic and Mario games, you could easily see why I was drawn to Bubsy then.

It's very important to not play the game expecting something exactly like Sonic or Mario. Bubsy is a platformer, but its not a series that is a carbon copy of the more well known ones. If you go in expecting a Sonic clone, then you'd be sadly mistaken. You simply cannot speed through these levels without consequence, and unlike other platformers, you only get one hit before you lose a life, so you need to take care and traverse the levels with caution if you want to proceed. There's traps of all kinds, and many of them are rather unexpected as you may find yourself back where you started, so it helps to remember where those are.

If you just want a challenging time waster that's eeking with 90s era attitude and dated one liners, then this two game collection is a good choice for the price. It's nothing spectacular or groundbreaking on the level of Mario or Sonic, but it offers a bit of a wacky experience if you allow it.

It was actually one of my favorite games to rent for my super nintendo.

I can definetly see how someone who was unfamiliar with the SNES era might find this game questionable at best but I can still make it to level 3 without dying and it's been almost 20 years since I last played this game. I find the key is to keep moving forward and care less about exploring, jump often (so that if where you are landing has an enemy you won't die) and enjoy the animated deaths.

Also this is emulated very well for use with an Xbox360 controller. I try to play super mario all-stars on SNES9x and it just doesnt feel right. This I only had to get halfway through the first level before I knew it was perfect. Handles like a dream never miss judge my landings.

Sure, let's go with that), and, honestly, much betfur ubiquitious one-lane, always-move-right standard we have today. 

So, think the level design is bad? Keep dying on the first stage? I can actually get to stage 7 with all nine lives, at this point, and I'll tell you how.

Think of every level as having 4+ ""planes"", none of which necessarily intfuract with one another well. There's sometimes a ""dungeon"" plane, there's the ground, there's the roof-plane, and there are usually 2-3 regions above the roofs. 

Jumping to a higher plane is dangfurous! The combination of the game's camera + Bubsy's ridiculously high jump (sorry, Bubsy, you can't jump out of your own game :( ) makes jumping an arduous endeavfur, but...

You have to be /extremefurly/ carefur about jumping UP to a higher plane, but, the game is immeownsely generous when heading downwards. So, stake out a place without enemies, jump upwards for a while, and then glide downwards. You can clear 20-40% of the level this way per leap, and, while gliding, the zoom and controls actually opfurate in a manfur that makes the game feel /fair/. Bubsy will almost never die while gliding (unless you get as unlucky as Bubsy's career), and, by staying either within your ""plane"" or only heading downwards at high speeds, the game suddenly turns into the Mario/Sonic fusion it's sometimes accused of trying to be. 

So, uh, yeah. I like puns, I love the way this game plays like an interactive cartoon, and, hopefully, by assuaging some of people's completely justified rage about the level design, more people can see the pawsitives inherent. Just climb to a meowntain and glide.

Bubsy Two-Fur is a combo set of two games for the SNES. The first game, ""Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind,"" sees you saving the world's yarn supply from a group of alien bandits, the ""Woolies."" The second game, simply titled ""Bubsy II,"" has you running through space and time.

On the surface, it's a good way to bring attention to a long-lost character. This is despite him being rather infamous for his poor resemblances to Sonic the Hedgehog. Within, of course, it's a bit of a struggle. Gameplay is pretty straight forward, as Bubsy will jump about, run fast, and glide through the many levels. The level design hardly seems to benefit the bobcat, however.

Further in, we note the legacy this particular rendition has. It was previously being attacked due to its use of an emulator to basically run two ROMs of the games. Where those results have gone, is a good question.

My somewhat dated analysis of Bubsy Two-Fur, from its launch, can be viewed [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBsnc4GgXes]here.[/url] The game appears to have had some consistent updates, so I suppose the developers are at least attempting to make sure it's up to snuff.

One thing i had hoped though that by bringing the game to Steam, the laggy controls of the original would've been fixed, but nope they haven't. I guess that is just one of the quirks from the original game - if you could beat the game with controls that felt like you had to jam your joystick from side to side constantly just to avoid hitting things, then you were a skilled player when it came to Bubsy. 

If you liked the Bubsy games on the old SNES then this game is the same. If you are new to Bubsy, be aware the controls with drive you insane.

[b]Bubsy Character[/b]

With so many mascot characters coming out back in the day, Bubsy tries to make himself stand out by using a wisecracking, smartass personality.  Unlike the similarly-styled Gex that appeared during the mid 1990s, Bubsy restricts himself to using his comments only at the start of each level.  This makes his attempts at humor more successful because they do not come out feeling as forced as Gex’s comments.

[b]Bubsy I[/b]

As for the gameplay, it comes off as a stripped-down version of [i]Sonic the Hedgehog[/i].  Bubsy can run quickly making it that the player can cover a lot of ground in a short time.  Additionally, when jumping, he can open his arms in order to glide across large gaps or dodge enemies.  This comes in handy when dealing with dangerous situation.  The problem with the game is that he dies after only one hit.  There is an item that will protects you for a few seconds, but nothing that will stay until needed.  Without anything to protect him, like Sonic with his speed, this will mean that you will get many cheap deaths.  This only way to make it past a stage safely is to tap forward to prevent his speed from kicking.  The one good thing about this is that the game is very generous with lives make it not so bad when dying.  The game is still fun when moving slowly, but it becomes a hassle having to keep his speed down.

[b]Bubsy II[/b]

Realizing that one-hit kills was a problem, they fix it by making that he needs three hits to die.  Additionally, he can carry items that let me navigate the stages with some safety.  On the surface, this sounds like a good thing.  However, by giving him a safety measure, it makes the game easier.  In fact, it is now too easy.  With so many ways to protect the player, building up lives is no longer a problem.  The game divides itself into two games, one labeled East Wing and one labeled West Wing.  In both cases, I was able to finish the game with over 20 lives on my first try.  Knowing that there are too many things on the player's favor make playing more of a snore than a joy.

[b]Overall[/b]

The first game has enough basic elements for platforming fans to get into, but the second it not worth the effort.  Just be grateful this collection stops before the disastrous 3D game.  There is a reason there was never a fourth game.  It is clear that the series is falling apart from the start.

I had to re-map my controller each time I wanted to play for both 1 &2.
I launc the first game die a few times but on my 3rd death game crashed. I had to restart so I did play a little more and it crashed on the second death.
Switched to Busby two, no crashes so far played into the middle of hamlet, found the first bonus level played it and upon returning to the level I was in CRASH! but not just any kind, the sound crashed with the game. It was awful.

THat brings another point, the game will hitch and hang when you play levels the music often stuttering my PC is able to run SNES games just fine so I don't see how the devs could fuck this one up so much.

Sadly I can't reccomend this and glad I boughht it at discounted price. I am honestly quite sad about this because I wanted this port to be good I really did want to re-live some of my childhood with Buby and his pawtastic puns.

Not amazing, but all right. The level design is built in such a way where each level has multiple ways to get from the beginning to the end, oftentimes with ways to avoid most enemies pretty easily (once you've found these alternate paths, that is. Some are hard to find). Its also pretty easy to speed through levels the way its made. You can find a lot of these alternate paths on accident just by running and jumping as fast as you can to get to the end of the level. You run at Sonic level speeds in this game, and I like that.

The music is catchy, but you hear too much of the same music for too long. Bubsy himself is a fun character though, from the poses he makes to the pop culture quotes and puns he makes at the beginning of each level. 

People like to complain about the game having falling damage, but the thing is is that to avoid falling damage all you have to do is glide. And gliding is encouraged since it slows down how quickly you fall, allowing you to get farther while in the air, which is extremely useful when you're trying to fly over levels from higher points in them.

Is it perfect? No. My biggest qualm with it is that getting touched kills you. Its unbelievably unforgiving, and considering  you don't have a whole  lot of screen to see enemies and obstacles as you move, this can be an issue. Thankfully, because this game runs in an emulator,  you have save states, so this helps alleviate said problems. 

As for Bubsy 2....Its terrible. It fixed Bubsy's biggest problem (the 1 touch death thing) since you can actually touch enemies in it without immediately dying, but the music and level design took a nosedive as a result.",1454839118,1454839118,True,1,0,0.385718464851379395,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game was finally patched so Bubsy 2 no longer constantly crashes but the update also completely broke controller  support for me. I used to be able to play the first game fine using either a PS3 or 360 controller, now none of them work even if I reinstall the game. Also, the function keys for quick loading do absolutely nothing.

As it is, the first Bubsy is a classic and the eponymous character really does stand out as a great character design. The game however is poorly balanced, unfair and at times completely  unwieldy. It tries real hard to be like the classic Sonic games, but what you get is a Sonic-wannabe who dies from fall damage and running into walls too fast. 

There are some very cool ideas for stages and gimmicks, such as the multi-part desert/train stages and the black shirt power-up - but no matter how good they are, the assets are recycled ad-nauseum and get repetitive real fast.

The sequel, Bubsy 2, fixes some of the problems from Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind - you no longer instantly die from taking any sort of hit and the enemy designs and stages are much better and much more varied with added gimmicks like shooter segments and mini games. You also have a choice in which order you want to tackle the stages which certainly makes the game less punishing in the long term. The game does suffer from inconsistent frame rates however can be really sluggish but I can't tell if it's due to poor emulation or if this was really what the original was like.

Either way, it’s Bubsy and if you’re here looking to buy, then you’re probably either getting it out of pure nostalgia - in which case this review won’t matter - or you’re a glutton for punishment like me.

That being said. I do have some negative points. Never a good thing I know. 

NO LIFE SYSTEM

Mario Bros. was challenging, but fair thanks to a life system, same for Sonic. But in Bubsy you don't get that. Everything kills you in one hit. This creates a strong sense of frustration that games shouldn't cause.

TOO MANY DEATH TRAPS

I know there are bound to be spikes, and pitfalls, but good god. They are all over the later levels. I can't take more than two steps with running into, or nearly running into some sort of death trap. Plus enemies are all over the place, and yep you die in one hit so that adds to the frustration.

A nice save system included in the emulation is nice, but the game would still be fun if I didn't die in one hit making me constantly use the quick load function.

I would certainly like to see Bubsy make a come back in some new games, and I hope you guys, Retroism, could provide that. And that is why I bought this to help support. It's only five dollars, not an arm and leg. :)",1452762069,1452762069,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you wanna know more about these two games, I would seriously want to call a psychiatric ward for your health. But in seriousness, if you want an indepth review I suggest watching Johnny Ortiz's review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKaPVMJ8Yck

If you want a TL;DR version of why you SHOULDN'T BUY THIS: here's some reasons why.

--The camera doesn't know where and how to focus on Bubsy. While running he can  be at the edge of the screen from the left or right and when in the air it almost always locks onto him.
--The gameplay is atrocious and unfair, and a big turn off is that the game has fall damage. A 2D platformer with Fall damage. This game was supposed to rival Mario and Sonic. Let that sink in for a second.
--Level design isn't confusing but instead misleading. What you may think is a shortcut is actually a 1 way ticket to the start of the level. Think of Super Mario Bros. 2 (Lost Levels JP) with the fake warp shortcuts that sent you back to world 1.
--You don't know what is an obstacle or a platform. This is the worst thing out of the bunch
--CHECK POINTS CAN SPAWN YOU INTO AN ENEMY CAUSING DEATH

[h1]0/10 Bubsy Two-Fur Review – Or why you should be wary of nostalgia[/h1]

I am a big fan of the very first [i]Bubsy[/i] game. It is a game that I grew up with and was excited to play as soon as I saw its announcement on Valve’s Steam service during December of 2015 – a good year for any retro gamer with other old franchises, such as [i]Super 3-D Noah’s Ark[/i] (orig. 1995), [i]Turok[/i] (orig. 1997), and [i]Mega Man Legacy Collection[/i] (2015, with games from 1985-1994) finding their way on to the popular online store as well. I was excited to write a review on [i]Bubsy Two-Fur[/i], but even now I just can’t. Sadly, I was not prepared for how bad the [i]Bubsy[/i] rerelease on PC would turn out to be. So, instead, I’ll write about why you should avoid this release at all cost.
 
[h1]About Bubsy[/h1]

Before talking about this particular release of [i]Bubsy[/i], it might help to know a thing or two about this series itself.

Even though [i]Bubsy[/i] is the poster child of a bad video game franchise, the very first game in the series, just titled [i]Bubsy[/i] (1993), is a lot of fun. It is a jump’n’run platformer similar to [i]Sonic the Hedgehog[/i] (1991), in which stages have multiple pathways to encourage players to experiment around. Levels are also filled to the brim with checkpoints and 1-Ups to almost nullify any punishment for failing. Even more so, Bubsy the Bobcat has an impressively large amount of [i]Looney Tunes[/i] like fail animations, quite uncommon for a game from that era, which, in a way, even reward players for running into enemies to see how he’ll react.

Unfortunately for [i]Bubsy[/i], the first game was a commercial success. So much so that the developer and publisher behind it, Accolade, pushed out a bunch of, let’s call them “adventurous” games of “courageous” quality that explored the limits of human tolerance. [i]Bubsy-2[/i] came out a mere 12 months after the first one and looked like it cobbled assets from various other projects together to become a Frankenstein-esque monstrosity with a headache inducing soundtrack, the sequel after that, [i]Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales[/i] (1994), was more of the same but in bland, and could only be topped off by the final nail in the coffin of the franchise: [i]Bubsy 3D[/i] (1996).

Like many series in the 1990s, [i]Bubsy[/i] tried to jump from the second to the third dimension, and just like many others, it failed. Presumably due to financial pressure on Accolade’s side, [i]Bubsy 3D[/i] was rushed out with not only horrid controls, a disorienting camera, and annoying sound design, no, its levels all look like unfinished test stages. Naturally, nobody wanted to play it and so, a few months after the game’s launch, the developer-publisher had to close its gates forever. The bobcat was then almost forgotten in the realms of obscurity had it not been for the advent of gaming channels on YouTube. [i]Bubsy 3D[/i] had finally gained notoriety among the gaming community, just not for what one would like to be known for. During the early 2010s, it was renowned to be one of the worst 3D games in existence and retroactively one of the most miserable video game franchises in Western history, which brings us to the 2015 rerelease of the first two Bubsy games.

[h1]The Steam Release Controversy[/h1]

After Accolade’s disappearance, another company, Retroism, acquired the rights to the [i]Bubsy[/i] IP. Since it was already a known franchise and because bad, old games, like [i]Super 3-D Noah’s Ark[/i] (which became infamous after the AVGN’s Bible Games episode (2006)), had a successful launch on Steam in 2015, Retroism’s subsidiary, Tommo Inc., decided to hop on the retro train as well and hired Piko Interactive to use the SNES ROMs of [i]Bubsy[/i] and [i]Bubsy-2[/i] for a Steam release titled [i]Bubsy Two-Fur[/i] (2015).

For this project, Piko used the SNES9X emulator after they had the permission to do so by two of its developers, Gary Henderson and Jeremy Koot. Sadly, the emulator also used code by other people who refused to have their work be used commercially, which sparked a moderately big controversy after [i]Bubsy Two-Fur[/i]’s release on Steam. Piko Interactive naturally apologized, but, to add crisis to a disaster, the second game in this bundle, Bubsy-2, didn’t even work and constantly crashed. Gamers overall were discontent, to say the least. The SNES9X emulator is freeware and if one had pirated the Bubsy games, one would have had a far superior experience over the official version.

Both Retroism and Piko went silent after the debacle with Piko showing back up on the Bubsy radar in May 2016, five months after the game’s Steam launch and just before a first updated version using a new emulator was released (cf. Emulator Questions / Feedback, Steam Discussion Board, (2016, May 13th), http://steamcommunity.com/app/426630/discussions/0/487877107141475138/?ctp=4#c357286119106888164 retrieved April 5th, 2017) After the update, the emulation for [i]Bubsy-2[/i] worked fine and both games even had Steam Overlay functionality, but now the controller support was missing. It was no use, as at this point, irreparable PR damage had killed Bubsy yet again and the sales numbers looked grim.

After I had complained, a Piko representative apologized personally to me in the Steam Community hub for any inconveniences caused and the company offered to send me a Super Nintendo reproduction model as compensation for the trouble. I initially rejected the offer as that would have been too much trouble, yet they insisted. So, in May 2016, they told me to send them my contact details, which I did and they replied with an e-mail promising that they would sent me an SNES as compensation at some point in the future. (cf. Add achievments! [sic!], Steam Discussion Board, (2016 May, 17th), http://steamcommunity.com/app/426630/discussions/0/487877107137486019/?ctp=2 retrieved April 5th, 2017) This was then followed by complete silence. It is now April 2017 and at this point, I do believe that it is unlikely for Piko Interactive to follow through on their word. They did, however, bring out a second update to the game in September 2016.

[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]
Despite being a big Bubsy fan who was initially filled with excitement for this rerelease and who hoped for new Bubsy adventures in the future, [i]Bubsy Two-Fur[/i] has left nothing but a sour taste in my mouth. Nobody wants to play games that don’t work and nobody should. I don’t believe that the people behind this release put a bad product out on purpose, but the way things went was anything but nice. There’s a lot that could be said on this, but there’s no point to it. My only suggestion to others is to not fall into the same trap and to play games that are enjoyable.

Allow me to give a brief history lesson of this game and the character in question. Bubsy was intended to act as a mascot for the development studio Accolade during the early - the late 90s. This was an era in gaming when platforming games were all the range and when Mario and Sonic became some of the most iconic and recognizable video game characters of all time. Essentially, Accolade wanted to attempt to compete with both Sega and Nintendo's mascots, by introducing their anthropomorphic bobcat, Bubsy. Bubsy, however, was never really well received per se, not just as a character, but so were his games. While the first game did receive mainly positive reviews, all the games that followed received a dip in reception, but Bubsy would finally receive the notoriety levels that Accolade wanted when it came to Bubsy's more infamous outing ""Bubsy 3D"" which has been called by many as one of the worst games of all time. The character himself has struggled to have been resurrected after this title, that is until we got Bubsy Two-Fur.

What occurred here is that a company called ""Retroism"", a company centered on gaining abandonware property, obtained the first two Bubsy games, ""Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind"" and ""Bubsy II"" and putting them together into ""Bubsy Two-Fur"" from Accolade, in an attempt to get interest back on the character once again. Retroism then stuck it onto Steam's Greenlight program and got onto Steam through community interest. And now, enough with the history lesson, what is the game like?

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay in Bubsy Two-Fur is essentially what you would expect from your everyday 90s platformer, there are enemies to defeat along your paths as you try and reach the end goal of the level, along with boss battles every three levels, while you also collect balls of yarn. Now, while it is mostly your generic idea of a platformer, Bubsy does suffer from a few issues. Bubsy Two-Fur actually runs in an emulation, and as a result of this, the game runs in a fixed aspect ratio, 4:3, with the rest of your screen being filled with a dull red background sith ""Bubsy Two-Fur"" plastered all over it. As a result of this aspect ratio, and the speed at which Bubsy moves, it's hard to see if there are any oncoming enemies if you 're running at a fast pace, meaning running into them and then dying will be almost unavoidable.

Another effect of this small aspect ratio is the gliding. Bubsy has a gliding ability in the game where after he has jumped, he can glide over obstacles. Usually, once you have jumped on an object, it's hard to notice where it is that Bubsy is going to land, this is particularly annoying in the platforming segments where you have to jump on platforms over water, where there may or may not be a platform underneath the one you're one that you need to use, which means leaps of faith are going to become a necessity at certain parts of the game..

Another flaw of the gameplay is the hit detection. For the most part, it's alright, but there are several instances where it can make no sense. It tends to follow the usual manner where if you run into an enemy, they kill you and you have to jump on their head, however some of these jumps you have to be very precise on as you can try and jump on top of enemies, but instead go through them and lose one of your 9 lives, but there are also times where if an enemy is on a higher platform than you are and you have to jump on them to reach said platform, you just need to take a risk and jump into them, with a random chance of them dying or you.

So in short, Bubsy Two-Fur's gameplay is essentially your average platformer that is let down in some areas. However, what I will say is that even though the flaws that Bubsy has just strike to me as forms of shoddy game design that make the game unnecessarily hard at time, I realise that this may also be a draw to some player that may appreciate an extra level of difficulty in their platformers, so take that information as you will, depending on what kind of player you are.

One thing that I'll say that I do like about Bubsy Two-Fur that I tend not to see too frequently done in other platforming games is its attempts at non-linearity. The levels within Bubsy Two-Fur are pretty big and have a lot of secret areas in it which can lead to additional wool, lives, and power-ups, which means it rewards players for not just following the screen to the right, and exploring the level by themselves. I'm not saying this is something incredibly unique, but I'm saying that Bubsy seems to do this in a better way than other platformers do, which tends to be just hiding away 1 area with 1 secret item.

[h1]Story[/h1]

The story of Bubsy is slightly different in both games:

In Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, the story is that an alien species known as Woolies have come to Earth to steal the world supply of yarn, and it's up to Bubsy to stop them.

In Bubsy II, Bubsy has to travel through time and defeat penguins, sheep and whatever other weird animals that are thrown in there for no reason.

Now, Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind has a good setup for the rest of the game and is solid. Bubsy II on the other hand, as I described earlier, has no setup at all, and it seems like it was just created as an excuse to get a bit more creative with everything else surrounding it. While I can respect Bubsy II going a bit more creative in terms of design, I still would have liked some form of setup created for it, as there is no form of motivation created in any way, and makes it feel like what it is you're doing is pointless.

[h1]Graphics/Sound[/h1]

Both of these Bubsy games have a sort of art style that still holds up to this day. The bright colorful art style in the first Bubsy game is pleasurable to look at and is overall good to look at.

Like I mentioned earlier, for Bubsy II, they went a bit further on the creativity part of the design. While it doesn't have colourful art that the first Bubsy game had, the design has reached a form of creative effort that it's still good to look at as you're wondering what will show up next as everything Bubsy II is thrown out at random and you never know what you'll be expecting to see.

As for sound, the first Bubsy game has a nice cheery soundtrack that goes along well with the rest of the game. Bubsy II on the other hand, has a weird soundtrack. It's hard to explain, it's a weird digitized sound playing that sounds like it doesn't really fit too well with the rest of the game. I wouldn't call it bad music, just not really fitting and representative of the rest of the game.

[h1]Play Time/Replayability[/h1]

As for play time, Bubsy Two-Fur has 16 and 30 levels respectively for each of the games, each one, lasting around maybe 5 minutes each, but this varies as there is a different amount of content in each level and in each game, which means I'm willing to bet there's at least a good 7 hours worth of content here for platforming fans, and for those that want to try and get better scores in each of the levels, you will definitely get more time out of the game.

[h1]Final Recommendation[/h1]

Bubsy Two-Fur is definitely flawed in a lot of ways, particularly surrounding its gameplay, however, I can respect Bubsy Two-Fur has a lot going for it in terms of content and does have a lot of things that players can get enjoyment out of, especially at a cheap price.

Pros
+ Rewards exploration
+ Good level design
+ Good graphics
+ Decent music
+ Good play time
+ Replayability factors
+ Challenging

Cons
- Fixed aspect ratio
- At times bad collision
- Bubsy II feels at times incomplete
- Sometimes the ""challenging"" aspects can lead to unfair territory on players

Final verdict: 6/10

And I do. I grew up with these two Bubsy gmes. Both are hard but fun time wasters and for their time, very ahead... I can't recommend it. There are two reasons to this. 

First, they didn't remaaster this or update it or HD it or whatever. You are paying for two emulated versions of the SNES games back in 97. If the want to revive these games and even the series, they will need to actually MAKE them and do something to make them hold up in today's market. Not just emulators. On Snes9x speifically.

If this is to be believed, despite what they said, this isn't even legally using SNES9x. You are paying for literally nothing. If you want these, go ask Nintendo to put them on Virtual Console or something. At least you get the neat Wii U menus to go with it. And you know it will have been legitimately put there.

As for any other reviews complaining its too hard and unfair, I managed up to level 7 in 20 minutes. Its not unfair, this is just how games were back in the 90s. If you wanted to win, you had to earn your victory. Don't let the difficulty deter you from a pretty solid gaming experience. Though I will admit it has its unfair parts in it.

Soooooo apparently someone decided to get the first two Bubsy games on Steam. An odd pick I'd say but it's happened, and they're here for those who want to try it.

After having dabbled into it a bit, I can safely say that anyone who's had any sort of ""good"" history with the 2D Bubsy titles will be pleased to know that the Steam Release is pretty much on par with the originals in terms of overall emulation. I only noticed 1 or 2 minor hiccups but they're nothing that really breaks the quality of these ports. So if anyone has nostalgia for these games, I can definitely recommend this ""Two-Fur"" for those people.

THAT BEING SAID, if you're fresh to this series at all then I'd say think hard about if you want to try it or not, and if so then proceed with caution. While these ports are faithful to the original games, said original games are filled to the brim with all sorts of Bad Gameplay & Level Design Decisions. Bubsy 1 in particular also has some very wonky momentum when Bubsy Jumps after running. And also be prepared to die, A LOT, from very cheap level design & enemy placement.

You've been warned. ;)",1450385909,1450427616,False,12,0,0.526231467723846436,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's not even any irony in that statement; if you're gonna spend money on a ""bad"" game you might as well spend five bucks on two games that are almost passable than ten+ on one that's completely irredeemable and intentionally awful.
