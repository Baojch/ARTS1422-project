I'v encountered a problem in several games, most recently THIS GAME..... The problem is that I am handicaped and confined to a chair. When I run this game I find myself in a non playable position with no way to move using the controllers.
  When I spent the money to move up to VR, I had hopes of experiencing things, like this game, even though I could not physically be present. 
 Most of the VR games I have used expext me to be able to move physically (I.E. HEAD. HANDS) instead of providing controller, or keyboard, interface for movement.
Hope this helps to make your product more successful,  
PS.. why not start a ""HANDICAP ACCESABLE"" label for your tours once they are fixed. I would be happy to serve as a product tester/representative for handicaped VR users.

I had two main gripes about it though: 1. I wish the female voice read the fact sheets out loud but she doesn't. 2. I wish we could have visited all the major moons and other objects up close. This was a good VR experience and what was done was done pretty well but it was skimpy on content and places to travel. I am going to give it a thumbs up because it is a nice quick tour and good for the kids to do and even teachers use for their class. But I will say this is not worth more than $5 tops. The price needs to come down in my opinion or add more places to travel: moons;asteroid belts;pluto and its known neighbors; a view from voyager of the solar system.

It is very informative and has some very nice views of the planets from space and a nice up close look at our moon.  A lot of the focus is on the terrain of each planet along with their moons.  Space satellites are also mentioned when applicable.  

I think it's strange they didn't include the Sun.  Also, the controls were clunky.  I get that they are going for immersion with holding the grips when launching off to another planet or opening the doors of the shuttle.  However, it gets annoying after a few space hops.  And you can't easily go where you want, you have to literally find the planet and then point towards it.  It took me a whlie to find Venus.  And you have to open the tabs on the machine and then open more tabs to get more information on the planet or moons.

Still, I enjoyed the VR tour of our galaxy.  It took me exactly 42 minutes with trying to make sure I looked at everything the tour had to offer (game doesn't tell you).

As the name states, it is an interactive space tour of our Solar System, and it is the user experience that gets a recommendation from me. I felt like a kid going to the planetarium for the first time, and it woke up a sense of wonder in me. The panel used to read the objects information is well thought off and adds a lot to the experience.

The only real distraction for me was the ""god rays"" with my Rift but that is more of a hardware problem that might not even bother Vive users. I noticed them most at first and from time to time again, there might be some tweaks the developer could try just for us people using the Rift, and it would make this app so much better.

For me, it was a good investment, just because of the set of emotions that brought back my younger self and me being a space geek. 

It's a great no frills app to lose yourself a bit and to show your VR gear to somene else. It's the first time I let my 7 year old daughter try the Rift and she was ten times more amazed at the sense of presence than me. She would almost yell at every planet she visited or nrely discovered interaction she tried. 

One more point to add, and this is all relative. I love Titans of Space, and yet this being a newer and maybe less mature app, I felt that the user experience and interactivity are better in Spacetours VR. Even my daughter asked me to let her in Spacetours after trying Titans of Space and that is as honest as it can get on the interactivity of this app.

I see some negative reviews. Everyone has a right to their own opinion, I would just ask them to reevaluate their recommendation after updating the app to the latest version. If it's still not their cup of tea, then to each their own.

Some ideas to make it better: Adding more content, allow more display settings customization like resolution, IQ and even being able to reduce the amount of stars visible. 

I see a lot of potential in this first rendition of Spacetours VR. I'm looking forward to seeing more conent in this app, along with other experiences from this developer. IMO, it will only get better.",1501049459,1501049459,True,4,0,0.542077600955963135,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Spacetours VR is not a game that you play. It is more of an experience that will be different for different people. 
Spacetours VR does exactly what it tells you, giving you the ability to hover around the planets of our solar system and look at them in awe. There is basically nothing else to tell you about for this. 

VR has had some hiccups since it has started and aside from some games, most of the games released for VR are essentially tech demos which provide a false sense of gameplay in their advertisements. Spacetours VR is also a tech demo for VR but it does its job.

Now, there is an argument to be had here that for the price tag of Spacetours VR, you essentially get half an hour of enjoyment and something to show your friends when they come around.

 For this price tag, you can get games on steam which will give you hours upon hours of gameplay but that is simply not the case here. It’s like watching a movie or spending a few bucks to go to an museum or something.

 The thing is, there is nothing that is going to convince you either way. If you have a VR and you want to look at some planets which look breathtaking at least for the first 15-20 minutes, then Spacetours VR might be your thing.

 If you want anything else, it is not going to do something to amaze you. It’s a game reserved for a niche audience and you should consider that before buying it.

What you do yourself in this VR experience is straightforward - you select a planet and travel to it in your pod.

Of course, the purpose of the program is to travel and view the planets and wow - superb! The imagery on the planets is awesome - IMO really high standard. To view the different planets of the Solar System involves pointing to a planet, sucking it in with the laser pointer and inserting the planet into a sort of capsule holder, hold the poles to activate hyperspace travel - and off you go in style!  If you like using Google Earth to view Earth zoomed out in Space then you'll really enjoy exploring the Solar System planets with this. It goes without saying you can't actually go into the atmosphere of the planets as the Google Street View cars haven't mapped them yet!

basically a visually driven experience with interactive events along the way. each planet is presented differently, some in really surprising perspectives. 
the probes around the levels were really cool the watch and interact with, made space less sterile.
amazing sound effects also, you can feel the warp jump in your stomach, make sure you wear headphones!!

game mechanics are very basic. you can play around with little versions of the planets and destroy one asteroid. would have loved to able to do more here (e.g. scaling), but what is there works.

ISS is like the action part, the 100 meter free fall nearly made my heart stop lol. Good thing it's optional.

visiting all planets took me around 40min, will be back to see what I missed!

runs great on my 1070, the other reviewer must have issues with his rig.

[list]
    	[*] Schön designte Weltraum-Tour
    	[*] Flüssige und ruckelfreie Grafik mit GTX 1080 und i7 6700K
	[*] NASA-Sonden der jeweiligen Planeten korrekt nachgebaut
	[*] Absolut coole weibliche Stimme, die Planeten ""ankündigt""
	[*] Das ""Größengefühl"" der Planeten kommt sehr gut rüber
	[*] ISS komplett nachgebaut

[u]Negative Merkmale:[/u]
[list]
	[*] Etwas kurz, aber dafür auch mit derzeit 9$ nicht teuer
[/list]

Man startet in einem kleinen Show-Room und kann sich als erstes die Erde anschauen.
Mir ist direkt die coole weibliche Stimme aufgefallen, die Planeten ankündigt, alleine deswegen hab ich die Erfahrung zweimal gespielt :-)
Mit den Controllern kann man verschiedene Aktionen auslösen, zB Planeten an sich ziehen und sich dann mit der Kapsel dorthin beamen, oder man löst Aktionen der Sonden aus bzw bewegt sich auf der ISS umher.
Das Größengefühl wenn man vor den Planeten auf der winzigen Kapsel steht, ist beeindruckend und der immer im Hintergrund ""grummelnde"" Sound lässt einen den Weltraum ""fühlen"".
Die Grafik ist absolut cool gemacht und es läuft jederzeit bei mir flüssig (das andere Review nachdem es mit einer GTX 1080 FPS-Drops gibt, kann ich absolut nicht bestätigen, da ich selber eine 1080 habe!).
Die Erfahrung ist natürlich etwas kurz, man kann sich aber durchaus länger mal im All umschauen, da die Atmosphäre toll gelungen ist. Zudem ist die Erfahrung mit unter 10$ auch nicht teuer.

And as another reviewer said, the planets don't have much detail and there aren't any info panels or anything.

At this phase of the VR game you're going to have to at least do better than Titans of Space if you want that kind of sticker price.

Die Grafik wirkt in etwa so wie auf den Screenshots (wie man das kennt = etwas verwaschener).
Läuft bei mir absolut flüssig (i5 6600k, gtx 980ti, 16gb ddr4, Win 10). 
Man befindet sich in einer Raumkapsel und kann verschiedene Planeten ansteuern. An der ISS wird es einem auch ermöglicht, die Kapsel zu verlassen und sich auf verschiedene Plattformen zu begeben (denke das könnte bei anfälligen Personen zu ""motion sickness"" führen). 
Wer den Weltraum mag wird mit diesem Erlebnis-Spiel zufrieden sein. Einfach schön entspannend. Wer Action sucht oder ein richtiges Spiel, der sollte sich Spacetours VR definitiv nicht kaufen. Punkte: 7,5/10",1489026718,1489154347,True,6,0,0.498145729303359985,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have a 1080 and the game lags even with no SS on. It also has no graphics settings which you can adjust. And the best part is it is not even that graphically good, the planets are washed out and not impressive at all.

I hope the devs see this and adress the issues.",1489021684,1489021684,False,7,2,0.59897923469543457,3,True,False,False,False,,,
