I've only played about an hour of the game but it's a cool little 2D beat-em-up with a nice story. I have some issues with the controls via keyboard, which seem like the inputs are delayed before the character strikes, but maybe if I connect my controller to it I'll have a better time with it. It is not bad, I do recommend the game if you love 2D fighting games & dig unique artwork.

6.5/10 for me!!!",1481075815,1481075815,True,0,0,0.41971394419670105,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hero Boy not only has some great gameplay, but has levels and enemies right out of a child's imagination, all while a real life apocalypse threatens said child's life.

Gameplay can get a bit difficult, but it's fun to mix and match the special abilities you get to see what can handle each type of enemy you come across. Some genuinely spooky moments in the game as well. 

Pros:
- Great story with a unique art style
- Fighting mechanics are solid, unique abilities add more flavor and strategy

Some cons:
- Some of the levels can feel a bit repetitive as you fight room after room of enemies.
- Elephant boss is painful
