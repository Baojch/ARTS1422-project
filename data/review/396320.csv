I don't mind the simplicity of the model if it weren't for the fact that it also seems to be broken - with ""combat analysis"" turned ON one can see shooting modifiers are all over the place. 

Effectiveness reductions and penalties do not match the barebones reference found in the ""help"" section and vary from one unit to the other for unknown or undocumented reasons: one piece of artillery will show a -5 penalty for ""indirect fire"" while shooting at an enemy unit in plain view and clear LOS, while retaining its full firepower if the target is behind a treeline. One tank will be penalized with -3 for moving one hex, another tank will move and suffer no penalty whatsoever. Thus tactical considerations are thrown off the window.

A shame as this could be a simple AND meaningful pastime. As it is, it's mostly good for mindlessly moving units around, shooting stuff and hope for the best.

Эдакая казуальная версия Panzer Generals - пошаговая стратегия про вторую мировую войну. Хексагонная карта, выдаются войска, выдаются задания и в бой.

Не понравилось, что рандом играет решающую роль, а не тактика. но все равно нужно порою думать... Попадаются очень сложные карты. Разработчик этой игрой дал старт довольно большой серии игр и я надеюсь они будут еще лучше.

While it was originally built for iOS devices, it feels like it could have been taken from a 1970s-era Avalon Hill catalog. The very few concessions to modern sensibilities (and the computer) include fog of war and diceless random number generation. It's a no-frills game that somehow kept me engaged for an evening without noticing the time fly by. 

Most of the eight campaigns have a dozen missions with (as far as I can tell) unique maps. It's pretty clear the maps are assembled from tiles with different terrain features. Even so, they look attractive and there are enough variations in tree tiles to prevent visual boredom. The units, especially tanks, are nicely modeled. As they wait to be moved, infantry looks around and tank turrets rotate from time to time. When you move them, tanks leave tread-marks that fade after a few seconds. It might be a simple game, but its developers put a lot of effort into the little details that can make a big difference.

A few holdovers from the mobile game exist. For instance, the menus are giant boxes with indistinct lettering. It's entirely playable with just the mouse, which has some advantages. One mode is hotseat multiplayer. Unfortunately, there's no screen between the end of one player's turn and the start of the next, so you get a quick look at the opponent's order of battle. On a smaller device, I suspect this is mitigated by handing over your phone while pressing the end of turn button. I don't intend to play multiplayer in any case, but it's awkward if you are thinking about it.

As befits the title, the battles involve German and American hardware from 1944. Since German tanks were more capable during that timeframe, the default game levels their abilities a bit to make more even matches. There's also an optional ""Historical Mode"" that restores the disparity and makes American missions harder. Another difficulty setting controls the behavior of the AI to make it less reckless. Reinforcements come at a fixed schedule and as you take victory points. Unfortunately, no units are carried over to the next mission so the only advantage to playing well is whether you get one, two or three medals.

Campaign progression is simple: complete a mission to unlock the next one. Battles don't seem particularly tied to real conflicts. The descriptions tend to be functional: take this victory point, reinforcements on turn 8, watch out for German Tiger tanks!, and so on. It's a little disappointing given the existence of the Panzer General series and the modernized Panzer Corps. Even so, Tank Battle: 1944 a no-overhead game with surprising staying power.",1530162154,1530162308,True,4,0,0.564964354038238525,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The idea works pretty well on mobiles and if you want to introduce a kid to the wargame genre, or if you have a few minutes during your lunch break, this game may be actually worth checking. The problem is - on [b]PC[/b] it feels laughably dull and boring. No, really, you'll probably get tired and uninstall it after just a few short missions. When you play it like a mission per day on mobile, it's not that bad. But when you're playing on [b]PC[/b] and want more than one short mission... it's [i]extremely[/i] boring. What's good for mobiles is bad for [b]PC[/b]s. Also, [b]HexWar Games[/b] really overdid it with such games. Long story short - they're releasing the same exact game again and again. And again. And again... The only thing they change is the name and the motif. Aside from that it's the same exact dull little something from mobiles. So... no. Just no.

I like this game as i have only played about 5 hours on the medium setting ,comes in 3 settings . they have a tutorial . a simple hex style move game . If you want compare it to a game try the Panzer core on a budget . w/o bells and whistles . I got it in a bundle for 3.00 with about 5 games all about the same style game play and one was civil war as well to break up the time frame so you can take a break from WWII . all the battles so far seem to end quick with in a hours time within a campign  you choose . no supply building just simply objectives  in amount of turns . a great lap top game if you are at work . or before going out for the night . or want relax a bit . 
They are not hard core heavey duty games have a feel of a tablet style game but since I do not play tablet games not sure if this is them but would be one if I played .
I like them to relax  the bundle for 3.00 was worth it I have played 3 of the games for a total of 20 hours already in about 4 days less 1 a day how can you go wrong . 
there is replay ability also since I do not plan on playing the games everyday but can be great stress releif games when you just want a game to sit back relax and not have all the 4x game details throne at you  a nice change 
so looking for a lunch hour fun simple but hard chalang play this is it

So I was hesitant to purchase this game as had its origins as an iOs game .  I chatted a bit with one of the devs online and wfound out this was not a straight port but a rework.  For 10 bucks, I figured what the heck.  I am very happy I gave it a shot.

What it has:  A very well done UI, quite easy to understand and friendly.  Nice graphics.  When I started in the tutorial I was reminded of the classic Panzer/Allied General games.  The tutorials are very well done and teach you everything you need to know to play well.  

A ton of content comes with the game.  Over 9 separate campaigns, each with multiple missions.  3 levels of AI make the challenge customizable for all player levels.  If you are a wargames expert and want a human opponent, there is a 2 player hotseat mode with 10+ scenarios as well.

The game play is fast, clean and easy to understand.  Your units can move and attack (think soldiers and tanks firing on the move) wuth a reduction in their combat effectivness.  Cover and terrain are very important for protection and line of sight as the map is shrouded (fog of war).

Overall impressions:  I really like this game!  I started it up and when I looked up, 2 hours had gone by and I was still having a great time.  One of the first games in a long time that I was disappointed when life interferred and I had to stop playing.

Do yourself a favor, get this gem of a game.  I know the devs are working on a American Civil War game as well and I am really looking forward to that one as well.
