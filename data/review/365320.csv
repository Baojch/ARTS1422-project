There are not so many indie horrors I know that are the same thrilling, atmospheric and interesting to dive into as Quadrant was like. [b]But there is a bad ending to a good start[/b].

[h1]Pros[/h1]
● [b]Great thrilling atmosphere[/b] which sometimes makes you feel goosebumps. Sound design and the darkness all around as well as the hallways with low ceilings make you feel uncomfortable. What makes you even more uncomfortable is that until a certain point in the game, you don't see the danger directly, but hear about it on the walkie-talkie from your comrades and see some evidence of it. One by one, you're left alone with the danger, and that's the moment you start feeling a real fear. 

● [b]Reading the notes in order to find out more about the situation happened in this laboratory is interesting[/b]. It's a bit odd to praise a game in which such things should be interesting a priori, but this is – in fact – a rare thing for indie horrors if not for horrors in general. 

● [b]Stealth mechanics and non-trivial puzzles[/b]. There are many office levels you which could make the player think twice before move. That fact makes the game feels more real and keeps the player in tension. Sometimes you need to be very attentive, and sometimes you need to make your way quickly but unnoticed.

● [b]It is always clear where to go next[/b], and that is just great. 

● It has surprisingly [b]good voice acting[/b]. 

[h1]Cons[/h1]
● In the first chapter, [b]there are some enemies ruining the tension the player is kept in[/b] as they appear. They run around the office and make you feel like a fool after you escaped the previous floor barely dead. You realize that they are not the enemies you should be afraid of, though you haven't seen any alternatives yet. 

● There are so many fuses in the game, and that's simply impossible not to collect enough, but [b]it's really easy to miss the places you need to use the fuses[/b]. So you go through the game, but sometimes you just cannot get the reason you need to collect and keep them still if there is not so much use of them.

● [b]The third chapter. It ruined everything[/b]. All the impression from the tension of entire two chapters was lost here. It seems like the developers made it for the sake of ending the game, as if for some reason they lost an excitement of developing the game or they just didn't know how to end it. Anyway, it seems like they didn't even tested its functionality since the third chapter is not only bad-plotted, but unforgiveably bugged. It has no sense and it just makes you feel confused as if you've wasted your time for nothing good. It's a pity that the third chapter – such an important thing since it's the final chapter of the game – [b]looks like a raw draft and an unworthy end to the first two chapters[/b]...

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I'd rather say [b]you should decide by your own if you want to buy Quadrant or not[/b]. The first chapters are brilliant, and it's a rare gem among indie-horrors. The third chapter, though, spits on anyone who dares to feel excited enough to go to the end, and believe me, it's easy to get excited. 
Perhaps if the developers had released it not in the episodes, between which there were such long intervals, everything would have ended differently. Neither the players nor the developers themselves would lose interest in the game. It might even have had a more polished ending. Perhaps things would have been different, but... [b]everything ended the way it ended, and I do not recommend you to waste your money[/b], unless, of course, you want to be disappointed.",1673632179,1677698852,False,5,0,0.590941071510314941,0,True,False,False,True,,,

In this horror-gem, there are some rare goodies to be found. The Alien-Invasion-World-Domination-setting and great sound-design. A handful of good ideas well placed over a couple of hours.

But there are some, ugly problems. It shows that this title is low budget. Assets like tables and chairs are copied numerous times with little else detail. Levels look pretty similiar. More detail, better models and better animations would have been nice, sometimes needed. The last levels have their own problems. But if you get immersed in this game, you can get past all that.

Why do I recommend this game, is it a guilty pleasure? I can definetely tell you this game has heart, I know a bad horror game when I see one, this is no asset-flip or cash-grab.

Quadrant succeeds in delivering a short but tense first-person horror adventure, provided you're not expecting a $5 game to measure up to the genre's AAA heavy-hitters.

[h1]What Rules:[/h1] 

[list]
 [*] Solid Horror Adventure gameplay sprinkled with small bits of action, stealth, puzzling, and (limited) exploration
 [*] Good level design with some effective use of light and shadow
 [*] Great music and overall decent sound design helps cement the atmosphere
 [*] Key customization and mouse y-axis invert options
 [*] Small list of easy achievements 
[/list]

[h1]What Stinks:[/h1]

[list]
 [*] No replay value. With its straightforward storyline (and seemingly inconsequential ""alternate"" ending), Quadrant won't inspire multiple playthroughs. 
 [*] Gotta love falling through the map. It only happened once, but it happened. 
 [*] Aether Research Facility is as well-lit as the inside of a bowling ball.
 [*] The ceiling monsters' animations. Oof.

even when coming way early
small spiders get in the way and climb on you and waste your time
enemies right from SCP Containment Breech
Portal 2 reference's
the game is very buggy, monster sounds only play to spook you
getting stuck by doors, walls and objects
puzzles with no hint to solve them, just you figure it out
very early computer hacking that needs four big passwords and its not even a puzzle
all that is based on luck, listen to the loud beeping and buzzling as you try the damn thing for another 50 times
achivements for noobs
and even gundam space colony for some reason and the washington monument in californa?

-FINAL-
THE END GAME IS A BITCH
The final part took me 10+ tries to beat, clearly they didnt test the game
it gives you no time to jump from each platform and flip levers and you end up dieing
and sinking to your death, then a final run for your life and just to fuck with you
SCP 096 chases you one last time to kill you in a long stretch of hallways and stairs
then one last chase on the alien ship. how the hell did we go from alien spiders to aliens? what just happend?",1506749810,1516921533,False,3,0,0.528381407260894775,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can only say that it is made up of 3 chapters and short, but what is going to happen in curiosity. It is a great science fiction-horror game where you play with ""VR"" which you can leave unarmed and cope with alien viruses creatures and the black-headed creatures who want to escape.


The character in the game makes the sounds of excitement and fear when you see the creature, and it looks like the image is getting darker and you are attracting that atmospheric with all the unreal.
A very different FPwS (First person without shooter)

Действие игры происходит в 1979 году в некой подземной лаборатории, в которой случилось нечто ужасное. Что бы узнать что именно произошло туда отправляют троих сотрудников некой кампании в защитных костюмах. За одного из них нам и предстоит играть.

Геймплей представляет из себя хоррор от первого лица механикой чем-то напоминащий Outlast. По ходу игры нам предстоит собирать записки и аудиозаписи чтобы узнать что случилось. Так же присутствуют головоломки как лёгкие так и более сложные.

Игра получилась мрачной, постоянная гнетущая атмосфера, а звук иногда просто шикарен и пугает больше чем здешние монстры которых от силы штук 5. Без скримеров конечно не обошлось, при первом прохождении они могут испугать своей неожиданостью.

Что не понравилось: Графически игра так себе, дизайн уровней унылый, а оптимизация могла быть и лучше.

Итог: хороший хоррор, который выделяется из кучи инди-мусора сделанного на движке Unity.

Holé chodby, prázdné zdi, stále stejné stoly, židle a skříně; přesto se vás tvůrci rozhodnou poslat na dlouhé cesty plné nudné šedi. A nezachrání to ani ten prvek hororu, kdy máte utíkat, ba naopak. Že už to horší nemohlo být? Kdybyste jen viděli zdejší strašidlo...
Té promarněné tématiky je tak škoda, ale možná když budete hledat, najdete něco podobného a lepšího jako modifikaci do Amnesie. Quadrant opravdu ne, pokud teda netoužíte po nudné šedi a špatné hratelnosti.

Это томление от ожидания нового эпизода. Я плохо знаю английский, поэтому понимал всё постольку поскольку. Первые эпизоды запомнились крутыми, а дальше игра скатилась в уг. Так мне казалось. Но я чувствовал, что в ней есть потенциал и...знаете что? Не так давно я решил записать видео, выложить на ютуб, перевести и запилить субтитры(просто на ютубе это удобнее в плане редактирования, если что). Самое скучное в игре - это начало. Сейчас я могу уверенно сказать, что эта игра шикарна…не идеальна, но мне ооочень понравилась. Сюжет её вытягивает. Но давайте я поподробнее расскажу о ней. 
[h1] Геймплей: [/h1]
Не стану скрывать, это не самое лучшее в этой игре. Играть в неё не так уж и интересно. Пугает она в основном скримерами. Однако, если вы проникнитесь атмосферой, то и она начнёт пугать. Временами нужно будет обходить монстров(назову их так). Сначала они кажутся страшными, но поскольку это инди, то некоторым могут показаться смешными. Лично мне сначала было страшновато, а потом уже приелось. Ещё тупейший момент, это дать вам в руки условно оружие. Я не знаю, кто-нибудь пробовал убить им монстров? Лично меня они валили только так. А необходимость эта обусловлена тем, что временами нужно будет разбить треснувшую стену.  Как-то вообще…уныло. В основном вы ходите, бегаете и крадётесь.

Выглядит игра довольно приятно. Не супер, может быть даже далеко не супер, но нормально. Хотя вот у меня частые просадки фпс до 20-25 кадров. В среднем что-то около 28-32. Особенно забавно, когда в коридоре 45 фпс, заходишь в комнату 20, затем в соседнюю комнату в которой 30, затем ещё чуть дальше в коридор и 70. Хотя окружение довольно однообразно. Но об этом далее. Может так же казаться, что коридоры копипастные, но меня лично всё устроило. Там штукатурка отвалилась, тут пол провалился. Хотя одни и те же столы напрягают.
 [h1] Сюжет: [/h1]
Он здесь очень хорош. Хотя перевести его мне было трудно. Сразу скажу, если вы не знаете англ и не хотите всё это переводить, то у вас проблемы. Игра покажется тупой и т.д. Пока без спойлеров. Во-первых, вы не ученые. Я не знаю, как называется эта профессия, но…ну эти люди устраняют разного рода утечки, будь то хлор или радиоактивное вещество. Просто с федерального объекта позвонили вашей компании. Вас выслали лишь потому, что вы оказались ближе всех, а дело срочное. Этот как если бы в здании фсб или кремле что-то прорвало и затопило пару этажей. Вот вы оказываетесь на этом объекте. Двери закрыты на электронные замки. Джейми, девушка и ваш напарник, говорит, что странно, ведь обычно для вас двери оставляют открытыми. И вот тут уже самая первая интересная мысль. Зачем кому-то блокировать их, если нужно устранить утечку? Ну мало ли, может коротнуло, да? Вы… бла-бла…оказываетесь внутри. Через некоторое время двери вновь кем-то блокируются, и вы не можете выйти. А затем вы слышите речь: «Извините, здесь какая-то ошибка…Вас вообще не должно было быть здесь. Мы уже хотели собрать команду и вызволить вас, но…я считаю, это неоправданно. Мы решили уничтожить этот объект вместе с вами. Нам очень жаль. Правда». Это очень интересно для инди. Очень хороший сюжет. Дальше вам расскажут, почему вас закрыли. Что вообще происходит и происходило. О каждом виде монстров…ну или вернее пришельцев. А концовка так вообще круть. Хотя подобное вы частично могли видеть в «масс эфекте». 
Дальше уже пойдут спойлеры, но хочу вам рассказать про супеер солдатов. [spoiler] По ходу сюжета вы найдете разные записки о пришельцах и их видах. Так вот, когда речь зайдёт о супер солдатах, там будет такой замут: пришелец затуманил разум ученого, чтобы тот начал менять людей, делая их как бы суперсолдатами. Пришелец убедил ученого, что наша армия это плохо, а его армия хорошо. Что мы неправильно развивались. Ученый заражал вирусом своих коллег и те становились монстрами, думая, что спасает мир. Ведь довольно интересно. А вообще эта идея с пришельцами. Привезли с луны грунт, а он оказался живым, начал расти и развиваться. Довольно занятно. [/spoiler]

Okay, so there is no getting away from the fact that this game is inspired by alien isolation. Its even set in 1979 - the year of the release of Alien. However in this case it adds enough of its own charm to stand on its own. 

Graphically its a mixed bag. The environments are nice, if a bit sparse and do a great job of feeling like 1979, the actual aliens are not up to the same standards sadly, with some lumpy animations. Audio is excellent overall with great atmospheric ambience and voice acting. 

I suppose my biggest criticism is the slow pacing and somewhat repetative nature of the game overall. There are puzzle and action elements, but they don't really happen often enough for my tastes. But for the low cost the overall package is I feel is worth it.

The location and sound effects in this game were definitely good although the same rooms and textures started to get a little mundane after a while. But it was just a minor issue.
Now over to the actual game, the enemies are very limited and in some areas there can be a little bit of frustration as you start to get past them only to be caught up at the very last. In my playthrough, I also encountered glitches in which enemies got stuck in a walking animation on the current path on which I had to go and was unable to progress forward. Through sheer dumb luck I succeeded which really broke my immersion level in the game. Also, I encountered low FPS in many areas of the game even though I meet the game's recommended requirements by a lot. On reading in the forums, I discovered that everyone is having a difference experience in terms of performance in this game. 
Aside from all that the game is definitely playable once if you are a fan of jump scares and indie horrors. There are also notably three good monster encounters in the game which will keep you on the edge of your seat and tensed. Aside from that its just walking and soaking in the atmosphere of the game.
For a startup game, the developers did a good job and I hope that in their next game, they are able to improve it by fixing the performance issues and lowering the predictability of enemy encounters.

If you judge it according to other indie horror games, this is most definitely a thumbs up.  If you play a lot of those, this game is for you.  If you judge it according to AAA or simply bigger studio non-indie horror games, this is mostly a thumbs down.  

Ultimately, to be fair, you have to look at its content for what it is and what it was trying to do and whether or not it succeeded.   The answer is:  sorta.  Not really.    

The production value is pretty decent.  The sound fits right in and the whole game is creepy as hell.  The atmosphere is done right - in the beginning.  

About a third of the way through the game you meet the second kind of ""specimen"", and..... that's it.  That's all there is.  There's a one-time encounter with a third that isn't hard to deal with, and you can SEE a fourth later on, but there are no real interactions with it, and it shows up only once.  The problem with this is that once you realize this is all you're getting, the tension is pretty much gone.  The primary two types of specimens in the game are rather badly animated, but again - would you rather compare this to other indie horror games, or ones from bigger studios?  

The writing starts off okay and descends to a kind of ""eh"" throughout.  There are film slides and written paper logs for you to read to fill out the rest of the incident in your mind, but very little of it actually matters.  You won't care about any of the characters, and many events feel tacked-on.  There's a HUGE lack of payoff for the end.  

I fell through the floor twice in the game, and I'm sure it would have been more often if I hadn't avoided certain spots, both related to ventilation shafts.  Invisible walls abound.  Collision detection is rather poor, not only from monsters but movement in general, and it definitely killed me on parkour parts more than once.  Sometimes you can see through wall edges to other rooms.  This lack of polish really breaks the shit out of the immersion every time it rears its indie head.  

The game often appears to be non-linear, but it isn't.  Many, many rooms and hallways exist simply as dead ends with nothing in them.  There are really no items, just fuses to open doors, and metallic fragments that I apparently never got enough of to find out what they do.  There were so many pointless areas and doors that were unopenable that it felt as though the devs intended to add a whole lot more, and just never got around to it.  

And then there's the length - five hours?  Really?  

If the game goes on sale for around five bucks, it's worth a play, no matter who you are or what scale of horror games you prefer.   But ten dollars?  No, absolutely not unless you are a hardcore fan of indie horror.  If the game had been longer, had more depth, more mechanics, more specimens, more craftsmanship, I would have been all over this thing, but it's just too short and mediocre in its overall impact.",1464858464,1464858619,False,6,1,0.581395328044891357,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Quadrant is an episodic first person horror game made by a very small team. Unlike many other horror games on the market, it doesn't rely on jumpscares and cash from screaming YouTube kids, instead it focuses on the adventure itself, story and atmosphere. It was supposed to be a 5-episode deal, but then the whole story was cut to just three episodes (the price has been lowered as well).
When I started to play it, the game reminded me a lot of the first F.E.A.R. game, by the Episode 2 it already was like Half-Life 1. Speaking of which, if you played They Hunger mod for Half-Life 1, this game and that mod has lots of things in common.

The graphics are like in the first Half-Life (low-poly models, primitive animations, old looking effects), but with the modern shaders and higher resolution textures (physics based shaders of Unity 5). The latter make the game look great and blood stains, for example, look REAL. 
Also, coherent style in everything all the way through the game. I never felt like some texture was out of place or had a lower resolution than the others (maybe there were such ones, but I didn't spot them and they weren't obvious), the same goes for models and sounds. 
It may be all low-poly and old-looking, but the game is pleasant to look at, which is much more important and certainly better than games with super-fancy shaders and effects thrown in without any thought.

The game has weapons and combat system, but the weapons were completely useless for me and I couldn't kill a single enemy with them, always running away. You have a delay for attack animation and enemies kill you with just 1-2 hits. It doesn't matter if you run forward and back while attacking, their attacks will still reach you. Combat system is useless for big enemies and only OK for killing those alien things on the walls which shoot with some goo or something. So run, run and run.
You can also break the walls with a pipe, but as you could guess, these are very specific walls which you need to destroy to proceed further in the game. Still, it looks cool.

I enjoyed playing Episode 1 and Episode 2, but forced myself to go through Episode 3. The last episode was pretty weak (aside from environments, they were great, as usual), just walking in the pure darkness with barely anything happening. Which would be OK, but these new action “trial and error” sequences made it worse. You need to learn every turn just to make it in time and total darkness and many enemies running after you don't help at all.
Also, those “jump down the cornices in the vent” parts get really old by the end of the game, they were used too much, in my opinion.
But the game definitely has some surprises under its sleeve. 
When I met the first spider, I was somewhat hoping it'll glitch in its way so it'd be easier to deal with while I was running around, but then it just started to throw tables around, going right at me. When I first met the creature which senses your movement, it was pretty terrifying to walk around it. And there are many other memorable moments like these ones.
The pace is about right and the game is never boring to play (even the last episode).

Quadrant has controller support and it works great. However, there are action parts in the game which I highly doubt you'd be able to complete with the controller. Right stick sensitivity is set to low, which is good (in my opinion), but in the fast action parts the sensitivity makes it impossible to turn as quickly as you need. Just be prepared to switch between controller and mouse+keyboard.

There were some bugs (like falling through the map, objects without physics colliders, a bug with animation of the doctor) and many slowdowns (especially in the Episode 2), but overall it's a well-polished product. 

It's a very low-budget game (the developer said it was “zero budget”), but it's a low-budget game done right and there was a lot of care put into it. It's an interesting, quality old school horror, which you don't want to drop until you complete it. 
It's three episodes now and Episode 3 is not as good as the 1 and 2, but for 10$ it's completely worth it (just the very first episode alone is worth 7$, in my opinion).

И я не обошел эту игру стороной! Но она меня не очень впечатлила...

Графика так себе. В начале нулевых такую развивали.

Звуковое сопровождение... Тут над звуком поработали хорошо, но есть много моментов, где ухо поймает некачественный звук. Самая лучшая вещь в игре - саундтрек! Вообще классные композиции! То что надо, чтобы создать атмосферу ужаса, одиночества и паники!

О геймплее говорить особо нечего - вид от первого лица, будем бегать-ходить-плавать, взаимодействовать с ключевыми предметами, решать загадки и иногда махать арматурой. Стандартный набор.

Ну теперь о главном - игровой контент. Знаете, это одна из тех игр, в которой полно пустых одинаковых коридоров и комнат. И да, тут так же полно дверей, и приходится тыкать каждую, чтобы узнать: ""Есть ли за ней что-нибудь полезное или интересное?"". Есть много моментов, где приоткрытая дверь как бы подсказывает, что идти надо в нее. Но, так же есть и ""пустышки"", за которыми просто ничего полезного и интересного. В игре есть парочка зачетных бабаек, но к сожалению они винрарно пугают только в первый раз, так как для первой встречи с ними разработчики винрарно все подготовили. Ну, а следующие встречи с ними уже не торт, так как не то, чтобы я на них насмотрелся и они меня уже не впечатляют, а изменилась игровая обстановка в худшую сторону. К примеру, в игре есть ситуация из разряда ""жертва заперта в клетке со львом, и надо из нее выбраться"". Мне эта ситуация понравилась, так как было ограниченное пространство, ""клетку"" нужно было сперва открыть, и не было права на ошибку. А теперь представте, что ситуация и обстоятельства изменились - пространства вам дали так много, что можно устроить футбольное поле, а ""лев"" буквально спит глубоким сном. И при этом вам даже ничего особого делать не надо. Просто пройди аккуратно. Не очень интересно мне было в данном случае. К чему я об этом говорю? Да потаму что в игре мало действительно хороших стычек с монстрами. Буквально еденицы.

Сюжет тоже так себе. Начало у игры довольно неплохое, но в середине игровые ситуации и сюжет уже не интересны. Самое разочаровывающее, что вы больше интересного узнаете из местных записей, чем увидете сами. А конец игры совсем разочаровал своим содержанием, он не стоил того, чтобы проходить игру.

Подвожу итог - могла выйте неплохая игра. В ней хороший контент! Историю, у которой хорошее начало, можно было хорошо раскрутить, добавить больше действительно пугающих игровых ситуаций. Я бы не стал рекомендовать эту игру людям, прошедшим, к примеру, серию игр Penumbra.

[i]Наконец-то на просторах стима появилась финальная версия отличного инди хоррора![/i] 

Самому не верится, но я уже отвык от нормальных хорров, они просто куда-то исчезли, а рынок (особенно в прошлом году) заполонили просто отвратительные подделки на 2-3 балла максимум. Достаточно вспомнить все мои обзоры на такие [i]""шедевры""[/i] как: [b]Rake, Kidnapped, Taken, Overcast Gridberd[/b] и другие. Причём популярность жанра всё ещё высокая, почему никто не старается сделать хоть что-то запоминающиеся один большой вопрос. Дошло до того, что у многих проектов хорошее начало, а потом они резки превращаются в дикий трэш. Так вот совсем маленькая команда [b]HKFiftyOne Games[/b] во главе с парнем у которого очень говорящее имя - [i]Seane Payne[/i] в кои то веки постарались сделать интересную игру.

[u][b]Главное[/b][/u] – этого старания хватает что бы сделать годный проект. Я никогда не требовал от хорроров, (да и вообще от любых жанров), каких-то инноваций. Сделали похожее, но по-своему? Окей, обязательно заценю. Проблема в том, что многие разработчики разучились делать даже это или просто не хотят. [b]Quadrant[/b] же с первого взгляда типичный, кривенький и большую часть посвящён беготне в темноте. Однако интригует и довольно разнообразный. Это целостная история, с нестандартным финалом и приятными (хоть и старыми) реализованными идеями. В принципе типичная бродилка по секретным постройкам с подбором записок, но очень захватывает. Плюс – есть загадки, довольно неплохие или даже лёгкие паззлы скорее. Да и место действие нравится, хотя по сути секретные лаборатории, но чувства: [i]""Ну что опять""?[/i] не возникает. Правда тут не самое лучшее начало, первые 20 минут дают совершенно не правильное представление о дальнейшем приключение. Поэтому советую их перетерпеть т.к. дальше игра очень сильно изменится! Понимаете, о чём я толкую? Можно сказать, игра из тех времён, когда разработчики не пытались запихнуть в первый уровень весь экшен и моментально свалить всё на игрока. Когда в середине мог открыться новый тип механики или приём. Причём всё раскрывается потихоньку и в той же середине, и в конце удивляет. 

Графически игра конечно не хватает звёзд с неба, типичный [b]Unity[/b], но смотрится нормально. К сожалению лагает немного даже на самом низком уровне графена. Ну и дизайн не блещет детальностью, оно и понятно жанр такой, да и бюджет не миллионик. Зато все центральные помещения сделаны добротно, для инди так вообще очень хороший уровень. Присутствует и атмосферность, слегка пустая и совсем не глубокая, но она есть. Особо впечатлительные могут и попугаться, монстрики есть, а от первой стычки лёгкую дрожь получил даже я. 

[u]Cамый жирный минус[/u]- отсутствие русского языка. С другой стороны, любителям хорров советую! Субтитры в основном лишь в начале, дальше только записки, которые смело можно и пропустить, даже не понимая на 100% вам будет интересно.

[u]Итог[/u] – настоящий глоток свежего воздуха среди ширпотрёба, самый настоящий инди хоррор! Оцениваю (естественно) по сравнению с другими похожими играми, а не ААА тайтлами!

I would have rated Chapter 1 negatively itself, in it's early stages. However, playing the full game all the way through really is the only way to experience it properly.

CONS:
I'll begin with the cons, which are as follows. The collision seems really buggy, I'm almost afraid to walk certain places for fear of falling through the floor or getting stuck, which only happened 2 or 3 times, but really it shouldn't have happened at all. The story and game design is all over the place, in the sense there's gameplay inconsistencies, where some areas you'll have puzzles that are difficult to understand, and other places you'll have platforming for no reason. Some of the creatures are creepy, some are just silly. Graphics and textures are alright for an indie game. From what I understand, this game was created by just a few people, so some of these issues are excusable. 

In general, I felt hardly any dread or horror from the creatures themselves. A few exploits of the AI are that some of them you're able to just run right past and it kind of negates any horror or suspense that comes from avoiding the creatures. Combat is pretty useless, I'm not sure why it's even an option, aside from using pipes to break through to other areas.
There are a few really long cutscenes and monologue exposition. To be completely honest I tabbed out and checked my email while one of them played in the background for something like 3 or 4 minutes.
These, along with a list of other smaller things (too many flickering lights, repetative environment/empty environments etc.) are my main gripe with this game. But to be fair this is an indie game and I did expect some of these issues. The price though, maybe a little high at $13.

PROS:
Although it does have it's fair share of cons, some parts of this game are actually really well done in my opinion. The sound design for the most part is incredible, and is responsible for most of the game's horror. The sound is what made this game hard to play at night, it's actually quite scary when you don't know what to expect. The story does have some things that are a little out of place, but as you learn more and go deeper it really does come together quite well in the end and touches on some very interesting concepts. The music is incredible, I know music is subjective but I personally loved the soundtrack and I'll be buying it when it's available. Some environments actually have some really cool storytelling going on and it's worth playing through a second time to see it all. I can tell a ton of work went into creating this. It's not the next Outlast by any means, but it is an indie horror worth playing at least once. 
You can tell the devs got better as they made this, you can see the environments and game design become better as you progress. Which, personally, is a good thing to me, since it ended the game at a high point for me.

Short Version:
Yeah, this game has bugs, and glitches, and some odd design and story choices at some points. Some monsters aren't that scary, it's got a lot of exposition sometimes. There's a lot of scavenging for fuses and notes, and some odd puzzles that are either too easy, or a little difficult. It's what you'd expect from an indie horror game. 
But, atmosphere is incredible, and the game itself is more story-oriented than puzzle-platformer. The horror comes from the implications of the events that take place in the facility, rather than relying on cheap jumpscares (although there are a couple). Quadrant is borderline Lovecraftian, and the story really opens up at the end and provides answers to things previously unanswered earlier in the game, which I was hoping for.

Like any indie horror, it has flaws. But, when it does something well, it does it very, very well. It's a solid effort by the few devs that worked on this and completed it.",1462149953,1462149953,True,23,0,0.620131969451904297,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The first chapter was good I liked it, it was a romp of picking up fuses and dodging rock creatures trying to eat your face.


The second chapter though......(I was looking so forward to this chapter)

Let's see

1.  New alien creature spiderman walking on ceiling looked as though he had applied grease/vaseline to his body and slid           around the ceiling.

2. The creatures are blind but crouching does nothing to keep them from hearing you, in fact you can run as long as your not within a certain distance of them. If you are within said distance crouching and walking slowly does nothing since they will ""hear"" you and then come charging in trying to give you a great big hug-o-die.

3. I have fallen through the floor at least 5 times due to a clipping bug.

4.  I have walked through walls and doors due to clipping bugs.

5. Swimming.....well let's see this man has the lungs of an olympian god at first when he was in his hazmat suite I thought ""well I bet he has supplied air in that thing.""  Then later you are taken out of your suite so I don't know maybe he evolved gills being around all those aliens.  Swim forward=fast,  swim up or down=his legs and arms are broken.  One time I was swimming towards the end of the game and my character got stuck swimming permanently but I did not realize it I just thought the swimming part was extremely long until I saw a monster dash by me really quick under the water and I got to a room that has a timer that counts down from 20 and was still swimming and could not figure out what to do....then I died in the countdown room and when the game reloaded all the water was gone.

6. I have loaded into the game and all the monsters have vanished.

7.  I wish I had taken a video of the alien monster walking on 2 legs it is hilariously bad.  He looks as though he is two stepping to the bathroom to have a nasty dump.

Now I realize that this is a indie game/early access, but this second chapter needed to be beta tested a whole lot more.  Like I said up top I really enjoyed the first chapter it was cheesy but good cheesy this new chapter though is bad cheesy.

Just finished Chapter 3, which I believe is the last chapter to be made in this series, though I could be wrong.  

The alien creature animation was still  bad so no change there.

It was or at least seemed a lot shorter than the previous 2 chapters.

The ending was left open for what seemed like a sequel but I do not know if they will do anything more with this story.

All in all this chapter really didn't do anything new for this game as said above it was short and you don't get any closure because they left it open ended for a sequel so I really fail to see the point.  Alien humanoids have terrible walking animations I am surprised they did nothing to make it look any better from the last chapter considering this one was the shortest.  

They did add more of the same jump down elevator shafts jumping puzzles that were in the last chapters and they decided to add some switch puzzles that were ok until the flooding electric water room switch puzzle of which I died the first time doing it and when I reloaded the level all the sound was muffled because it thought I was still underwater.  That puzzle can go to hell considering the jumping in this game is clunky feeling.  Oh they also brought back the must find fuses to get through door puzzles, yep got 2 of those.  There is also no final boss type monster that you battle with you end up with 2 back to back run out of this area before 2 minutes are up or you die.  

You can tell that this last chapter was rushed to get out by how short it is and how they recycled the same thing over and over in it.  I will say though unlike chapter 2 I did not clip through any walls or doors and did not fall through the floor.

All in all if you want a cheesy horror game that started out with a really good story and kinda just flubbed in the end then go ahead and buy it.  If you were like me and thought that chapter 1 was really good but needed work and expected the following chapters to improve on what they had established story wise and design wise well you will be dissapointed that is why I do not recommmend it.

Chapter 1 = rough around the edges but has good atmosphere and story build up.

Chapter 2 = buggy(at least when I first played it) gameplay terrible alien animation and so-so story 

Chapter3 = Has same terrible alien animation some good addition to the story until the stupid open ended ending which brings no closure to the story as a whole and rehashed puzzles and level design from the first 2 chapters.",1446676568,1464908518,False,2,0,0.498233199119567871,3,True,False,False,False,,,

+ Consistent foreboding atmosphere

[h1]Overview[/h1]
[i]Quadrant[/i] is an episodic horror game revolved around a small group of scientists sent to investigate in secret a distress call from a failed research center. The group soon part ways to explore the facility and weird things start to happen. You play the role of one of them, and try to escape the danger you've discovered.

[h1]The Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Good Horror Setting[/b] - The environment is a horror cliche standard. Empty building, ravashed furniture, scattered documents, locked doors, complete darkness. And while the elements are a textbook case, it lacks in execution, which I will go into detail in the cons section.

[*][b]Immersive[/b] - You can see your feet and the plexiglass and some of the edges of your hazmat suit, and when you run your screen gets blurry because of the heavy breathing clouding the helmet. You can't run very fast because of the rigid construction of the suit, and get tired really quick 'cause... you're a labrat, not an athlete. Very nice attention to detail, and it makes you really get into character.
[/list]

[h1]The Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Poorly Optimised[/b] - Despite it's mediocre graphics and lack of particles or animation, the game cannot run a constant 60, hell, sometimes it just drops between 36-45fps constantly, making it a really choppy experience. I see no reason for this on a high end gaming PC.(My specs are on my profile, if anyone is curious)

[*][b]Rigid animations[/b] - The few things that move in this game (your hads, feet and the monsters) have very unrealistic animations, almost looking like plastic action figures. While on the subject, your shadows look horrendous. Look at it while moving around, and see almost no movement, just a rigid model. See gameplays and you will surely note it.

[*][b]Repetitive Environments[/b] - This building is huuuge, and it shouldn't be so. The assets used here are very limited, and you'll see the same desks and chairs and broken montiros over and over and over again, with nothing new other than the layout. Most rooms are very spacious for what they hold, and the occasional ravaged room isn't enough for me to consider level diversity.

[*][b]Cliche Enemies and Gameplay[/b] - I don't really want to spoil the first chapter, for people who want to play it, but for the ones who are undecided let me tell you what will happen. You will find a lot of fuses for no reason, even though you will need it only on one occasion, and in a low number (needed to use four, ended the game with 13). There will be plenty of jump scares, a couple of monster chases, and on the second one. Guess who the enemy is? Half-Life Head Crabs copycats. Gameplay is also so recycled from other games, I don't even know what where to begin. You have a few puzzles now and then, can find story-related documents, audio logs and picture cards. Other than that, you walk around aimlessly.

[*][b]CLOSED DOOR SIMULATOR 2015[/b] - Remember how I said the building was too big? It was for a reason. Not having doors would look like crap, and having to design so many rooms would be repetitive and time consuming for the devs. So what did they do instead? Lock them ALL up. 95% of doors you will encounter will be locked, 4% are open so you see which way to go and 1% are unlocked so you can explore some more.

[*][b]Episodic[/b] - For me, episodic means a sort of early access. We give you the first chapters of a story we havn't even finished yet for you to enjoy. Even if you don't need to purchase them seperately, which would have been the final nail in the coffin, waiting an unknown amount of time for the next part of the story is not a good thing either.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The trailer and the screenshots on steam made it look promising, however the execution is so poorly done that I cannot recommend this.

I was recently reminded to finish Quadrant and provide a more updated review for this game. It holds 3 chapters in total and asks for 5 bucks. In my previous review, I did not recommend this game and to wait for updates. The game picks up a bit better in chapter 2 but falls apart in chapter 3 sadly. Here is my updated review:

Pros:
The horror atmosphere still holds up
Tension is slightly better
Sound Design is still solid.

Cons:
Graphics are still poor (They actually removed shadows to conceal animations, but they are slightly improved)
The enemy AI is kind of dumb and really easy to dodge
Story is lackluster
Walking simulator 3.0 

STORY & ATMOSPHERE: 
The story has not really improved going forward into the later chapters. They reveal a lot more but they don't bother to really explain much of it until the very end. However, a lot of it is very easily forgettable and honestly, the main enemy is just not that interesting. They talk about this higher level enemy who has command over the creatures in the facility and how he instructs them in a particular way but it doesn't really expand into anything beyond just ""Humanity is evil because I think I am good!"" Basically, the same horror cliche we have come to expect over the years. I applaud the developers for trying to bring more substance to it but they don't do much with it. I honestly found the experiments they mention in the documents more fascinating than the bigger picture. Once again, the characters are forgettable, don't get much background context and generally disappear faster than you could ask. Heck, even the main character gets no development beyond ""I can't speak because no one gave me a voice actor!"" As much as I tried to get engaged into the story, it's nonsensical and you'll just be bored walking through the simulator.

The Rest:
The horror elements just fail on the most basic of levels. The only real horror elements are blood and the alien-looking creatures. Definitely are more fun compared to the spiders in chapter 1 which, for the sad part, don't get much use in the rest of the game. The don't try to spook you (unless you find basic jump-scares scary) and the alien language isn't all that interesting. While they were a nice touch for the puzzles, you will probably be more annoyed at them than finding them interesting since the overall puzzles in the game is split into 3 pieces: Fuses, Code-panels, stealth-sections. The stealth sections are pretty laughable once you realize you can outrun the majority of the enemies into ""safe zones"". Some are more tricky than others but for the most part, they just serve to slow you down rather than add tension and fear into the section. The fuses are still the same as before.

The level design gets better in the later chapters but not by much. Everything is still very much repeated through the game and you'll think you are walking through the same sections over and over but, in actuality, are progressing. You'll get to see some labs at least and some of the rocks they acquired but not much else beyond that. It is still largely comprised of offices and hallways. There are also a lot more locked doors than ever but the vast majority of the stuff you can actually enter contain nothing. No worthwhile pickups or anything. Just pretend they don't actually exist and just keep walking down that same corridor that you swear you walked by a dozen other times.

Bugs still exist in the game sadly and the controls are rather wonky at times. The enemy AI is very easily avoidable if you know how to dodge a bit and know where your end goal is. You can run by all of them and enter a safe area where they can't get to you. By the end of chapter 3, you will be bored after the walking simulator just to repeat the same section again right after. The combat system does not work very well, don't even try. You will be killed almost immediately and the weapons don't even feel that different from each other. You may or may not get stuck occasionally, it can happen as well as the running and jumping feel very weird. I believe holding jump actually increases how high you can jump and letting go early will drop you. Overall, still very much the same as you expected from the first chapter.


Short Review:
While I did play the 2 chapters I missed much later down the line, I kind of wish I didn't bother to go back. Nothing really changes and the improvements they mention are very minuscule. It is just a walking simulator once again with even more locked doors, a different enemy, very little develops and just overall, not very fun. For 5 dollars though, I guess, maybe, you could check it out but you will probably want your 5 bucks back by the end. They mention multiple endings in the description which is honestly not very true in the more logical sense. Technically there are multiple endings but it is based entirely on one choice and it only serves to change the dialogue very slightly. Check it out if you want, I can't stop you but I hope my review might deter you from wasting your 5 bucks. The game's length is short (I believe 4 hours but I kind of speed-run through it because of how dull it was).

The game gives games like Outlast and Alien Isolation justice. I haven't felt on my toes this much in a long time. But, the game has its problems as well. This is not a perfect horror game.

Suffice it to say, this modest little indie game never had much chance of living up to the grandiose heights of that recent mega-corporation mega-game, but it certainly can't be faulted for lack of ambition therein.  
 
   It's atmospheric, super-scary, has excellent sound design, some challenging puzzles (well, they were for the hopeless likes of me, anyway!), and looks like it may actually have a genuinely interesting storyline.  I say ""looks"" as this is only the first part of an intended three-part ""season"", so here's hoping they actually get that far, release-wise (otherwise that price-tag is looking rather steep).  Some minor technical flaws aside - I'll be damned if I can get the cursor to line up properly when trying to pick up an item, and the Options menus are a mite confusing to negotiate - it is nonetheless looking like a mighty promising proposition.  Here's to the next two chapters!
