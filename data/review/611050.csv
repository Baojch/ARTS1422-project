Voicework and plot are all solid, although it is just an intro as mentioned in other reviews. The use of panels as more vibrant overlays on 3D scenary works as a focal point (even if it doesn't exploit the degrees of freedom much more than that). Ultimately visually it's just 'comic panel' + setting, but with an evocative setting that does feel additive. They throw a couple of neat touches in for some of the transitions. A touch disappointing that the inlaid figures didn't extend fully beyond the frames as you moved about. Cool experience for the price all told though.",1532556596,1532556596,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Moriarty Endgame is a bold step towards the future of the graphic novel/comic book. I had to play through twice since the first play I was so focused on the creative shader use and the blending of 2D comic sprites in a 3D immersive plane that the story went right over my head. The creators throw us right into the world of Moriarty with very little hand holding -- which is nice. The writing and art style are consistent with a high fidelity voice over and sound effects leading the pace. I was briefly removed for one moment in a scene where we learn how Moriarty gained his super power. It felt forced and unnecessary in comparison to the subtilty in which other major plot points were revealed. That being said, the dark matter super power story will make a great episode on its own. It also moved a little fast for my taste. One thing that is wholy unique to comics as apposed to digital media is the ability to 'travel at your own pace.' To handle this the developers implemented a simple forward and reverse feature that allows you to easily restart a scene or skip to the next (I would guess each scene is the equivelent to 1-5 panels in a normal book).  Still, I think there could be a more creative way to let the reader move at their own pace. These are nit picking observations, and at the end of the day Moriarty provides a concise and cohesive product, which is twice as impressive when you consider they are paving the way. I am excited to see what the team puts out as they become more comfortable exploring this new take on the media.",1518662606,1518663116,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I can definitely recommend this experience.  The only problem is that it does feel short, that's because the experience is very engaging and things are heating up.  It's like a teaser.  Just when things are getting really good, the experience ends.  

I would definitely love to see where this story goes.  Basically, this is a VR comic book where you have a screen shot of the action for the comic.  But all the while you're in the background of the place where the action is taking place (which is in black and white).  This contrasts really well with the stark colors inside the ""pages.""  There are few animation even within the pages of the comic book.  

I'm not a comic book fan or reader.  But if comic books were this immersive, I'd definitely get into it and get my nerd on.

It's certainly worth the purchase - if you're a VR enthusiast or creator - because it's a fantastic implementation of the graphic novel medium in VR. It embraces the tropes and affordances of the original medium (2D, speech bubbles, striking coloring), which I think was a brilliant choice on the dev's part. The art is lovely, esp. if you're into Steampunk, and the colors are gorgeous. 

That said, the story is... Gah. A little on the weak side, imo. Moriarty's and Holmes' moral roles are flipped, which is an interesting concept - but there's little to no character building, pretty stereotypical dialogue, weird dynamics (Watson's character is... wha...?)

It might be unfair to judge the story out of the context of other, non-VR issues of Moriarty. But they're not available as part of this game, and as an isolated experience, I don't think this one has a mass appeal in terms of being an awesome graphic novel. It kinda isn't. It's also exceedingly short, at 10-15 minutes of ""play"" time [mine shows ~7: there were sync issues with SteamVR but it was at least 12 minutes). And the voice acting feels a little over the top quite often. These are normal issues with games, and maybe more forgiveable in that medium, but I brought my graphic-novel expectations to this experience, and as such, it falls a little short. 

What it is, though, is a fascinating experiment with form and with how passive ""reading"" could work in VR, and it works really well as such. And even though it's still fundamentally a 2D experience the parallax effect of multiple ""action planes"" and effective animation, as well as gorgeous backdrops and really clever ""windowing"" of the panes, definitely helps with immersion.

If you're curious about ""out there"" VR experiences - that don't go down the obvi path and offer an alternate take on what it means to create entertainment in VR - definitely give this a try!",1492044476,1492044477,True,3,0,0.533512711524963379,0,False,True,False,False,,,
