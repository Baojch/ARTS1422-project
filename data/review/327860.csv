we didn't finish the whole thing because we picked up other games, but it was still a nice experience.
it did have a few bugs here and there, especially during combat and respawn, and the repetitiveness of the quests made it a little boring at times, but we still had fun, which is the most important part anyway.

would I pick it up again to try and finish all the quests? probably not.
would I play a sequel that's maybe done just slightly better? yeah why not

The overall feel of Salt is generally tranquil, for example when you're out sailing, fishing, or exploring. It can be a very relaxing game.

The combat is also pretty basic, except it can be challenging if you bite off more than you can chew. I personally found this aspect fun, as you can always return later with better gear if you're finding things too difficult. There is a hardcore (permadeath) mode if you're looking for even more challenge.

Another surprising aspect of Salt is the depth. Not necessarily the quests, as they are usually straightforward, but the number of items and figuring out what to do with them will keep you busy for quite some time, especially if you don't Google the answers.

Tomate una tacita de cafe y prest√° atencion. Este juego es un minecraft-survival basico, no esta mal en cuanto a graficos y jugabilidad (inventario, pelea, crafteo, etc.) pero es aburrido si lo jugas sin compa√±ia y honestamente tampoco es que es muy divertido.

Es un Sandbox infinito osea que podes grindear de por vida y las islas son limitadas en tama√±o lo que complica las cosas, en Minecraft dentro de todo hay cierta continuidad territorial.

Creo que no esta tan mal pero no me termino de convencer la propuesta.

Salt 2...I'll try it once it leaves EA...I just hope they stuck to similar gameplay as part 1 because they have something special here. We have plenty of garbage released these days...we need more games like this! 

Anyone into exploration and discovery with very little hand holding is going to love Salt. I highly recommend not looking anything up online because this game is based around learning as you go...google will ruin that experience for you. 

Its a steal at the sale price....I bought the developers other game (Wild West and Wizards) just to support them. Great job devs! I hope Salt 2 is a great success.

I like to mark out my days and write little notes before waiting by a campfire and come up with backstory for my character and stuff, just creating my own little world. Plus the ships are so...motivating? Like, moving up from a raft to a sailboat felt like such a HUGE upgrade, and then finally getting the last bits i needed to get a proper ship, it was just the second best ship there was, but it immediately makes so much room for personalization and you feel so accomplished!
The navigation makes me struggle a bit, but only because i'm awful at reading compasses, but i love that the mapping system is so personalized, that you can add journal entries for specific islands and mark them with symbols for what you find there (though I might wish the symbols were more concrete? that they had specific Meanings that were laid out, rather than just implied meanings? only because I tend to confuse myself with whether I use the pirate hat to mean there were pirates there, or there was a pirate captain there, or...etc).
I kind of wish that it had more varied scenery, especially with the trees? only one tree provides fruit, which makes the rest of the trees kind of useless? (though pretty)
I like playing this game when i want something relaxed and...not mind-numbing but soothing? just the sound of the waves and the occasional very loud slurp of health potions or crunch of food. (some kind of cooking ability would be cool too, since at the moment im apparently just eating raw deer meat)
A really lovely game that is absolutely work the money I paid for it!

The most chill sailing simulator on the planet, SOT and a lot of other sailing have nothing on this, perfect game to kick back, grab your favourite drink and snack and explore the world. Course there are the occasional bugs here and there but this is what your getting for only 2 bucks:
- Land + Sea Exploration
- Limitless Open World go wherever you want
- Complete random generation (or pre gen if you want)
- Many things to collect
- A non grindy system
- You dont have to pay anything in-game besides the 2.15 price tag
And if your not sold so far the game even has a demo which is FREE, to ""try"" (Last time i played the demo you basically got the entire game free.)

Now all and all Salt isnt a godsend of a game and it could have more features, which hopefully more things are added in the 2nd game. (Which is much more expensive)

Either way if your bored of all these huge titles coming out, are on a budget, drained from new horrible releases etc, I highly recommend giving Salt a go the perfect way to unwind after a big day.",1669621704,1669621855,True,5,0,0.582114934921264648,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I had bought this ages ago and recently got back into it thinking maybe it had evolved into something worthwhile. Unfortunately, it seems the time vs update ratio isn't what I expected. Resources are few and far between for a true crafting game, and the islands are rarely of any interest. If you wait until night and go toward the lights you might find something interesting but other than that it's just hours upon hours of not a lot going on. The story line, as thin as it is, is predictably linear. One thing this game did REALLY well was the manual mapping. You aren't given any directions at all but mere coordinates (albeit rarely) and at one island you can claim rewards for how accurate your map is while having the ability of fixing mistakes for a cost. What this game could use is a levelling system, base crafting, and a deep dive into true crafting. Do I like this game? Yes. Would I recommend this game? Not unless you're incredibly bored and have hours and hours of time to spend mindlessly wandering, or it's on sale.

Hunting? Fishing?
Exploring?
None of these things is overly complex on their own, but together they make a great experience IMO.
A little like minecraft on the sea.

Overall, I found this game very enjoyable.
The sailing while not overly complex, was both fun and relaxing.
It is one of those games that compel you to do just that one more thing. And you discover another path you can follow.
I always think there is something else to explore or maybe I should read one of the book I found for a clue to some fun adventure.
You can also play with friends. You can give them your kit. If your friends get lost and don't know where you are, they can teleport to you, should you chose to do that. 
If you are on a distant island and they are joining the game at map coordinates 0,0, they will need to do that at least once.
While there is only one save slot, if you die, it starts you at your last save spot at a safe distance.
I think the graphics are very good (the pirates being the only exception).
My only complaint is the fighting is a little meh.

They are working on a Salt 2. Hopefully they will eventually add multiplayer as an afterthought, as they did with Salt.
Either way it looks to be very much the same winning game design, with improved graphic, story and combat upgrades.",1661298031,1661298275,True,1,0,0.497300982475280762,0,False,False,False,True,,,

I've been on a bit of a survival game kick lately, and when I noticed that Salt was on sale, I went ahead and bought, because it showed up on Extra Credits' ""Games You Might Not Have Tried"" series quite some time ago. Understand that I'm not blaming them for recommending a bad game, up front they told me that any games on the review aren't necessarily good, but they are interesting in some way - and I will grant that particular explanation.

One aspect of Salt is that you have to do your own mapping. Get a sextant, and a compass and go out into the archipelago to kill pirates for their booty and explore the world. Put islands on your map, write notes about them in a journal. In concept it is indeed interesting, but it doesn't go a lot further than that - at least, it hasn't yet as best as I can tell. 

In true form to the survival genre, Salt feels a little like a minecraft clone, but without as many immediately apparent options. Your play begins on an island in an endless archipelao - computer generated, of course - and you are alone on an island with one other guy. You pick up a few logs that are lying around, along with a pickaxe, and a few other odds and ends. The guy alone on the island with you tells you that the raft next to his camp doesn't belong to him, and that you can take it, and off we go.

You can technically craft your equipment in Salt. It just feels weird that I picked up my pickaxe randomly at the beginning of the game, and it just never wears down - as best as I can tell. I could hypothetically have this pickaxe for the rest of the game. I mean, yes, a little more realistic than minecraft's or Medieval Dynasty's setup where your pickaxe falls apart after 45 minutes of use, but where those games seem to have a direction that they're going, I can't figure out Salt, and after 3 hours of running across pirate island after pirate island, for some reason everything that I've come across feels pretty samey, and if there is a tutorial to this game, I haven't really found it yet.

This game could be a really cool and engaging game.... if it was a really cool and engaging game, which it isn't - as far as I'm concerned. There is apparently a Salt 2 in the works, which makes me think that they're just rushing out milquetoast sequels for the sake of cashgrabbing from an already milquetoast game.

I don't want to steer anyone wrong though. I've seen a few reviews with like 70+ hours on Salt, that give it the thumbs up, but right now, that's just more effort than I'm willing to give.

Really wanted to like this game, but the reality is that it isn't much of a game at all...

Concept-wise, Salt is spectacular: sail around an infinite procedurally generated archipelago, surviving off the land and sea, fighting pirates, hunting and exploring. 

The actual game however, is just not engaging in the least.

Your sail boat simply moves forward regardless of the wind direction. You can't even adjust the direction of the sails for RP purposes.

There are ""pirates"" on the islands, but who exactly are they pirating from, considering that there are no other boats sailing on the ocean? Nor any towns on the islands? The average non-pirate population of the islands is 0.1, as in you find one person every 10 islands or so. And they are all male.

There's a hunger bar, but it depletes so slowly that you only need to eat once every 3 in-game days, and finding food is neither challenging nor interesting.

There's a health bar, but the enemy attacks are so weak that it's next to impossible to lose a fight so long as you are swinging your sword in the enemy's general direction. There're potions and other items to heal you, but the health bar regenerates so quickly there's no need for these items.

There's also a stamina bar, but this, when running, depletes so rapidly there's next to no point in running at all. 

None of the stat bars serve any meaningful purpose in making the game in any way enjoyable.

What exactly is Salt?

It's not a sailing game as there are no sailing mechanics.
It's not a survival game because surviving is ludicrously easy.
It's not an action game because the action is ludicrously easy.
And to be honest, it's not much of an exploration game either, as most of the islands are devoid of any interesting features.

Even a ""chill game"" has to engage the player in an enjoyable way. Salt just doesn't do that.

The original review is below.
______________________________________________

It looks like a simple sailing and exploring game, something fun to play with friends!
However it is extremely rough around the edges:
-Connection with other players/host is very poor, hits on monsters barely register.
-Player names are small and hard to see, you will have a terrible time if you get split up which doesn't help as there is-
-No minimap. There is a world map but you got to fill it in yourself, which would be cool if you had any way to establish where you are. Though with how simple the game appears, I get it will throw people off who don't want to bother.
-The inventory is a mess and gets cluttered fast. There are tabs to quickly sift through your items though.
-The optimization is lacking, though it looks simple, it quickly reduces your framerate even on a decent computer.

?-When the host died, it kicked everyone off the server. Idk if this is intended but the way a multiplayer game is set up was quite awkward to begin with. You essentially join the party, then create/continue a world that has the same seed. Something that wasn't really clear and required us looking up to figure it out.

The positives are that it looks interesting, and could be something neat.
Different bosses and a bit of early game mystery with the ancient statues sounds promising!
I hope the game is/will be simple and fun, not try and be super deep and complex.

My suggestion is to hold off on it until it gets some proper TLC.

Big pass here, there are too many better options.

The concept of the game is great, but execution is poor. It could be so much better.
The characters look aweful, a lot of things happen to be buggy. Keeping your stashes sorted is making you insane- totally insufficient. But Thunderstorms are nicely made and lighting really flashes in!

Na? Sind wir auch mal wieder gestrandet und kommen nicht von der einsamen Insel runter?

Typisch mal wieder. Mit diesen Billig Kreuzfahrten ist das doch immer das selbe! Kaum haben die abkassiert, s√§uft der Kahn mir nichts dir nichts ab und man sitzt bl√∂d auf nem verlassenen Eiland herum, w√§hrend man verzweifelt versucht, aus gammeligen Kokosn√ºssen und ein paar Zweigen eine prachtvolle Strandvilla zu bauen...

Und weder Captain Jack Sparrow noch sonst jemand eilen zur Hilfe, Wilson haben wir l√§ngst ins Meer gekickt, der hatte ohnehin nicht viel zu sagen und insgesamt sind wir auf unserer Insel ganz sch√∂n ""Lost"", auch wenn wir keine Luke mit verfluchten Zahlen drauf haben. ;-)

Und sieht auch gar nicht mal so h√ºbsch inselig aus hier, oder? Alles noch eher grob und kaum poliert. Bei Stranded Deep wirkte das doch alles so sch√∂n und detailliert und auch da gabs schon kaum Content √ºber die Jahre. Hier wirkts eher wie die Blaupause von nem Konzept eines Entwurfs einer groben Idee...

... die dann leider nie fertiggestellt wurde. 

Early Access halt, aber warte mal kurz...

Moooomentchen mal....
... w√§hrend wir hier auf unserem Felsen mitten im Nirgendwo festsitzen, hat der Publisher genau das gleiche Ding nochmal mit Wildwest Assets released und nochmal abkassiert. Findiger Gesch√§ftsmann, Hut ab!
Und das Spiel dann auch gleich wieder liegen lassen, nur um jetzt f√ºr dieses Fr√ºhjahr Salt 2 anzuk√ºndigen, das haargenau aussieht wie das unfertige Ding hier, ich glaube sogar, einige Screenshots stammen sogar noch aus dieser Version?!?

√Ñhm, naja, puh, nun, h√ºstel... daf√ºr gibts sicher eine ganz logische Erkl√§rung, k√∂nnte man meinen. Oder?

Und ja, die gibt es, lieber Leser. Das ist schlicht und ergreifen richtig dreister Scam und das gleich dreimal.
Ne ziemliche Frechheit, null Kontrolle seitens Steam und Abzocke hoch drei - und das im wahrsten Wortsinn!

Also Finger weg, kauf¬¥s nicht und wenn Du es gerade eben gekauft hast, gibs schnell zur√ºck.

Und ja, dieses Spiel hat Potential, es finden sich gute Ideen und auch frische Ans√§tze blablablablabla....

Ist doch eh egal, ob das nun Ans√§tze oder Potential hat, das Spiel ist tot! Der Nachfolger ist auch tot und das dritte nochmal gleiche Game ist angek√ºndigt. Hier tut sich also nix mehr, die Ans√§tze bleiben unvollendet, das Potential wird nie ausgesch√∂pft werden.

Ich hab das Spiel vor Jahren mal f√ºr 1,50 oder so gekauft und ja, f√ºr den Preis kriegt man schon genug Spa√ü dabei herausgequetscht. Die Erkundung ist angenehm motivierend und das Ausprobieren und Insel erforschen machen echt Laune. Die K√§mpfe sind lahm, aber damals dachte man sich: Hey, wird schon noch werden...

Und solange Early Access weiterhin als miese Betrugsmasche genutzt werden kann, werden wir solcherlei Gedanken auch oft haben in der Zukunft, nur um dann bitter entt√§uscht zu werden.

Ich machs kurz: Das hier h√§tte richtig gut werden k√∂nnen, macht aber im Grunde nur richtig w√ºtend!

Und wir lesen uns dann in drei Jahren wieder, wenn unter Salt 47 Kommentare stehen a¬¥la: Oh, das sieht aber schick aus f√ºr early - da kann was Gro√ües draus werden. Wir beide l√§cheln dann nur mild, denn wir wissen Bescheid und kennen die Zukunft. Salt 48 steht n√§mlich schon in den Startl√∂chern ;-)

Spiel derweil lieber nen anderes Survival Game. Die Pr√§misse, dass Du irgendwo ganz allein gestrandet bist, findest Du ja sicher tausendfach besser umgesetzt, also w√ºnsch ich Dir bei diesen anderen √úberlebens-Games schonmal...

... viel Spa√ü ;-)

The music is fun too, being just background incidental, and isn't overbearing like some game music can be. The game play is basically, survive. Explore, and survive. Explore, survive,  and have fun doing it!

Talk to those who will talk to you, kill those who attack you. find and loot all the crates, chests and boxes you can. Pick up all the resources you find. find or make tools, clothing, weapons, etc. Build a tiny raft. Build a small ship. Later, build a big ship, or a huge ship. Explore more islands. The map is an interesting concept. You start with a blank piece of parchment, and you have to create the map yourself. if you visit an island, it doesn't get marked on the map, this is a piece of parchment. You must mark your map with the island, and add map markers to show what or who you found there.

Die Kinder schreien ""DAS HAT JA SO VIEL POTENZIAL"" 
Ja Junge, Kacke wenn das Game nach 5 Jahren immer noch genauso viel Potenzial hat wie am Anfang. Grafik schei√üe, kann man aber m√∂gen, mich pers√∂nlich schreckt es nicht ab. Gameplay ist aber genauso M√ºll. Alles in Allem ist das Game dann halt auch Verarsche. Auch wenn wirklcih einiges am Game stimmt, hat der Entwickler sich l√§ngst verpisst.
Die Reviews auf Steam zeigen es mal wieder. Es fing zum EA launch an mit √§u√üerst positiv!!! Das muss man erstmal schaffen. Klingt nach einem Meisterwerk oder? N√∂. Mittlerweile ist das Ding bald bei Ausgeglichen. Die Leute kaufen es trotzdem weiter. Es mag auch einigen taugen, die Anspr√ºche sind ja unterschiedlich, ist auch in Ordnung so, an den meisten Reviews siehst du aber, dass nciht viel Spielzeit zustande kam. Sagt mir dass das Game nicht bindet. Egal, habs ja trotzdem probiert und f√ºr schlecht empfunden. Der Entwickler denkt sich auch, leckt mcih doch, ihr habt doch alle schon geblecht, Updates k√∂nnt ihr knicken.
Ich kotze. Maurice von der Gamestar hat gerade erst eine Kolumne auf Youtube gemacht, kritisiert dabei eher den verbraucher als den Entwickler und damit hat er sowas von recht. Das zieht sich durch die gesamte Branche, Entwickler haben oft schon gar kein Interesse mehr ein ordentliches SPiel zu bauen, die Leute kaufen auch den M√ºll. Also werde ich einfach M√ºllproduzent, so krass es klingt, aber das ist Realit√§t geworden. Und es wird nicht aufh√∂ren, es sieht aus als g√§be es immer mehr von diesen Idioten, die jeden Schei√ü kaufen.
Allein in meinem Freundeskreis hei√üt es auch bei Fehlk√§ufen st√§ndig ""Ach die 30 Euro..."" anstatt einfach mit 4 Klicks eine R√ºckerstattung von Steam anzufordern. Wenn es denen nicht wert ist mit 4 Klicks 30 Euro zur√ºckzuholen, dann frag ich mich auch nicht mehr warum neue Titel jetzt mittlerweile schon 80 Euro kosten. Das w√§ren dann umgerechnet 10 Klicks x). Da w√ºrde ich als entwickler auch sagen, warum muss ich ein ganzes geiles Spiel bauen, wenn ich genauso viel Kohle mit einem game verdiene, das kompletter M√ºll ist?
Spiele mit wirklkich offensichtlichen marketingl√ºgen wie bei Cyberpunk und etliche andere, machen doch trotzdem Ums√§tze von denen man nur tr√§umen kann. Cyberpunk ist ja trotzdem ein geiles game, aber w√§re das spiel bei 90% aller Spieler unspielbar bis heute gewesen, w√§re das Spiel dennoch eins der meistverkauften Spiele. Das muss man sich mal vorstellen. Nur weil CD Project Red CD Project Red ist, k√∂nnten die einfach nur eine leere H√ºlle verkaufen, die Leute kaufen es blind. AUch hier wieder im Freundeskreis zig Beispiele. Hier werden Vorb4estellungen gemacht zu games, die nur angeteasert sind, man sieht ncihtmal Gameplay. WTF. Biomutant war da ein perfektes Beispiel. Haben sich einige Leute geholt nach dem Teaser von vor Jahren. Als es dann rauskam haben die sich gewundert. Gespielt eine Stunde und gemerkt wie doof das ist. Keine R√ºckerstattung geholt. 60 Euro einfach verschenkt an einen Entwickler, dessen Gesch√§ftsmodell GENAU DAS IST. 

F√ºr das Game hier hab ich nat√ºrlich gleich eine R√ºckerstattung beantragt und das sollte jeder tun, macht aber kaum jemand, das Geld bleibt beim Entwickler, der wahrscheinlich Tr√§nen lacht √ºber die Dummheit der K√§ufer und sch√∂n l√§ngst das Firmenlogo von der Tafel gewischt hat und ein neues draufgeschrieben hat.

This may be someone's preferred type of game, but there are many other sailing/pirate sims out there that run better and look better. This isn't a knock on the devs who made this, but it's just a very boring game overall, and I feel they limited themselves with an engine that seems like it belongs on a Windows 98 machine. The performance is surprisingly not that great either considering it's mostly voxel and poor quality 3d.

The one positive that this game has over something like Sea of Thieves is the ability to build a base since it's more of a survival game than purely exploration. Not sure if people would compare these two game together, but SoT is just a lot more fun and rewarding.

It's a really interesting open-world-pirate-sandbox-no-pun-intended-treasure-hunting-crafting game and I did enjoy the initial few hours.  However, this game falls flat in the long-run as is the case with these types of open-world sandbox games. There's another reason why I'm writing this review, however. Stay tuned, folks!

It starts off good. You learn to collect resources, you learn to craft items, find treasure, do quests, etc. That's maybe 2 or 3 hours in. Then, you learn that you have to travel for several minutes from island to island to make real progress. You do so in a boat, of course. You can put stuff on your boat (e.g. torches, chests, etc.) so there is a little bit of customisation, to an extent. The crafting is very mundane, unfortunately, and there's not a vast array of items to craft to where it gets complicated. I suppose the point of the game is to go around doing quests and finding treasure. Do as pirate does. 

My issue with the crafting and quests is that it is very shallow. It consists of ""collect # of item"" or ""go to location, find item, return"". There was only a few unique quests I found but they weren't too interesting, and a lot of them were at locations with higher-tier enemies, so a lot of my time playing was spent going around islands trying to find loot. You can't craft a lot that ultimately advances you forwards, and a lot of the loot and quest rewards aren't particularly significant. In fact, a lot of the better loot I had found is gained through grinding quests to get the unique quest tokens(or whatchamacallits) that you can exchange for items. So, to ""advance"" through the tiers of equipment you need to grind A LOT. It adds to the very simple feeling of the game but grinding never ends up being fun or good. This game has nothing to supplement the grinding itself.

The game itself feels very incomplete. The world is empty, there's little in terms of NPCs, civilization of any kind, and any significant landmarks of any kind. It feels like they left this game as ""good enough"" and moved on, which is very disappointing. There's surely more they could have added, such as cities (port royal was a real place, y'know), maybe big challenges / temples / forts to explore? Maybe ruins to explore? There's just so much missing and yet I do see one positive. I consider games like these ""podcast games"" or in other words, a great game to put something in the background and play this game as ""filler"" because who wants to stare at a computer screen for 2 straight hours listening to words?

So why am I *really* making this review? I just today(Dec 2nd 2021) have noticed that back in March of the same year, they have started a kickstarter for, get this, Salt 2. I'm beyond disappointed. Why not just update the original game? It's an exceptionally bad sign when a developer creates another game with the same name as the previous game but + 1. Presumably not much will even change and it will be the same idea and same execution. I will not be buying it. I got Salt 1 for a discounted price and I will only be getting Salt 2 if it's free because it's not worth buying the same game twice.",1638471169,1638471169,False,4,0,0.496314078569412231,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros
-A decently done open world concept
-Sailing around on semi-crafted vessels
-Crafting options
-Missions within the game
-Difficult enough to not become monotonous too early

Cons
-Not a distinct enough world
-Not enough crafting with vessels
-Navigation could be done far better
-More interaction in the world needed.

Their are 3 things i like to see improved on map and markers that leave a good way to follow them and the things posted below.   
It's more of a Great first time game build and combat effort on what could be a well done game sold that way for the developers of this game! In Recommended as such for a low price not sure at this point for it could of had a lot better characterization an interaction to a lot of things.  
What makes this game good is the fact that is all works well enough and having a lot of Exploration and a lot of cool rear items but what keeps this game down is a few things yet it still works and can be fun for at the point of 14 hours of game play i found some interesting things and the huge ship you repair and get later is cool.   NOW WE COME TO THE CON'S IN THIS GAME!
Pirates that fear water and will not enter it using this is great in all for beginners  do to the enemy hits can do a huge amount of damage but it seems more of a quick fix to the balancing issue that just could of given a few more items as your seeking and exploring.  Yet it maybe just bad luck finding them on the very first island.  Items and flowers can make healing yet the issue is the enemy speed seems a bit over the top due to later as you go your armor and such helps a lot so this maybe a fix but not really.  Also pirates that will not go on a ship to have combat is some what unrealistic and maybe done for like they said exploration but it would not of hurt them to just have a few situations of combat to keep the feel of it real.  I hope they do improve a bit on the second game SALT 2 and what i see it looks that way.   In all this game is worth 5 or more bucks at the point i played it and was fun but interaction to objects found seem a bit off in characters and objects yet play out okay as you go.  Over all i like the game exploration style a lot and some of the island hidden quest of object that i have not yet figured out what or how to interact with. Its a great game in all but again not really a top of the game in looks or finished in some aspects but worth what i paid for it on sale!

It is kind of a survival game, cause you have to manage your ""food-meter"", but its usually no stress, the bar does not deplete quickly, and there is tons of food to find. It is part RPG, cause you can build your character with tons of different gear, that boost your stats, armor etc. At the same time you cannot alter your characters stats without items, and there is no lvl system. 

The graphics are nice, there is a lot of content, lots to do. 
I have played for more than 100 hours on the same save, and there is still a lot for me to do, even tho I've finished the main story. 

The main story didn't really catch my eye, can't even remember what it was about. But I don't really mind, the experience is still worth it by far. 

This is a game where you can grind forever. Fishing, killing for equipment, searching for treasure out at sea, looking for song sheets etc. It just never stops. I have never really enjoyed grinding in games, but in Salt I find it relaxing and chill. The soundtrack is nice, the graphics and sounds beautiful. 

This game was made by a small studio by a few people, and I think what they've made is very good. They made the best they could with what they had, and it shows. There are of course things that could have been a little bit better, but overall its good.

""Frustrado com minhas experi√™ncias em Risen 2, lembrei de outro jogo que tinha em meu acervo com tem√°tica pirata, mas um vasto mundo aberto para ser explorado em busca de tesouros. N√£o, n√£o era Sea of Thieves. Era Salt, um infinitamente mais modesto t√≠tulo independente que eu havia testado em uma vers√£o demo, no agora distante ano de 2015.

Por fora, Salt √© um daqueles jogos de sobreviv√™ncia em que voc√™ precisa coletar recursos, construir coisas, tomar cuidado para n√£o morrer por causa de necessidades b√°sicas ou inimigos aterrorizantes. Na pr√°tica, ele est√° muito mais pr√≥ximo da vibe de Minecraft: um t√≠tulo para ser apreciado sem stress, no seu ritmo, sem grandes amea√ßas. N√£o por acaso, a trilha sonora principal de Salt √© o barulho das ondas e das gaivotas, intercortada em alguns raros momentos com uma m√∫sica suave e sutil que lembra muito o que a Mojang atingiu com seu t√≠tulo. √Äs vezes, a m√∫sica sobe para batalhas ou para trazer um clima √©pico no mar profundo, interven√ß√µes que contribuem para pontuar esses momentos, mas que n√£o chegam a subir a adrenalina.

A grande verdade √© que Salt √© um jogo que traz paz e n√£o assombro. Esse horizonte √© evidenciado tamb√©m em suas cores vibrantes, como se um Sol tropical beijasse o solo com graciosidade. Quase d√° para sentir a pele bronzeando. Em Salt, o verde √© mais verde, o azul √© mais azul, o mar √© mais mar do que em muitos jogos. Com rever√™ncia e um leve temor, jogamos nossa jangada nas ondas e manobramos o barco em busca da ilha seguinte. Mesmo quando se obt√©m uma caravela pirata, n√£o √© poss√≠vel se sentir conquistando o oceano, apenas obtendo um pouco mais de conforto e seguran√ßa em meio √† vastid√£o oce√¢nica. Somos convidados dessa beleza, nunca seus mestres.

Mecanicamente, por√©m, Salt est√° bem distante de Minecraft ou da maioria dos jogos de seu nicho. O jogo n√£o nos oferece a possibilidade de se erguer constru√ß√µes de qualquer tipo. Somos n√¥mades, explorando um mar que n√£o tem fim, com ilhas geradas proceduralmente. No m√°ximo, √© poss√≠vel construir ou melhorar barcos, mas nada que possa ser comparado √† complexidade de um Raft. O resto dos elementos fabric√°veis s√£o apetrechos que carregamos, vestimentas ou alimentos. O foco de Salt est√° mesmo na explora√ß√£o, no girar dos dados de cada ilha, que pode conter surpresas ou recursos necess√°rios para seguir viagem.

O combate, quando existe, √© simples e pouco desafiador. Isso pode frustrar alguns jogadores, mas acredito que seja mais uma vela que impulsiona uma experi√™ncia que se deseja explorat√≥ria. A noite pode trazer inimigos que d√£o sustos, mas tamb√©m pode ser facilmente evitada com uma boa fogueira. N√£o h√° lutas obrigat√≥rias ou que n√£o possam ser evitadas correndo. Se uma ilha est√° perigosa demais (?), sempre √© poss√≠vel navegar at√© a pr√≥xima.

Sem me dar conta, completei doze horas nesse universo, sem chegar a lugar algum. At√© porque Salt √© um t√≠tulo t√£o infinito quanto seu mapa. H√° inimigos gradualmente mais fortes, mas tamb√©m h√° equipamentos gradualmente mais fortes. Com paci√™ncia e sorte, voc√™ pode encontrar miss√µes e correr atr√°s desses objetivos, um norte mais n√≠tido do que havia em Minecraft ou na maioria dos t√≠tulos de sobreviv√™ncia, entretanto, na maior parte do tempo, voc√™ estar√° apenas deixando se levar, como uma onda no mar. Depois da primeira dezena de horas, h√° coisas que n√£o vi, mas tamb√©m houve muitas coisas que vi muitas vezes, o que acaba cansando.

Atingida minha zona de conforto, com um gale√£o pr√≥prio, bem iluminado, com cama, equipamento satisfat√≥rio e nenhuma morte nessas doze horas, fiquei tentando imaginar o que poderia estar na pr√≥xima ilha que justificaria minha perman√™ncia em Salt. N√£o me arrependo de nenhum minuto gasto sob esse Sol causticante, por√©m n√£o encontrei motivos para perseguir esse horizonte.

Deixo por aqui essa aventura e esse pergaminho, a ser encontrado por novos aventureiros.""

Truth is there are better similar games out there. The Raft and Valheim are two examples. To be honest they are both similar to aspects of this game, but they are both better. Valheim will scratch your build a boat and sail around procedurally generated islands much more than this, and the Raft has more interesting things to do from the start, with much better progression. So I would recommend either of them over this one. 

However, if like me you have played lots of the Raft and Valheim, and like a simple gameplay loop for relaxation, then this could be the very thing.

I've played this game for a solid 16 hours. 16 hours of finding nearly nothing of note. I had to stop myself after all this time and ask ""Am I having fun?"" And the answer was a resounding no. 

I'm not having fun navigating a massive map to reach an island exactly like the last four islands but maybe this one has a pirate on it trying to kill me. 

I'm not having fun when nearly everything you find is better than anything you can craft. 

I'm not having fun when I find an island, the size of four islands put together, and have to hunt down 18 pirates all to win a pair of boots I already have 4 copies of and some hardwood logs. 

I'm not having fun chasing a deer down in the dead of night because I'm out of flint and can't fast forward in game clock- for that matter, I'm not having fun chasing down an endless array of deer that will run to the opposite side of the island at the slightest provocation.

I'm not having fun when fishing nets me mouthed basses from small, medium, huge, and gigantic and I literally just need ""large"" to finish a quest

I'm not having fun squinting at bamboo and having to check the wiki to understand why even though it's right there I can't harvest any 

16 hour play time and I struggle to find where the fun is meant to begin. 
And if the game isn't fun, what else is it bringing to the table? From my experience, not a whole lot.

The low IQ trolls posting negative reviews with little game play should stick to Animal Crossing. I've played the early versions and the finished version more than once. Multiplayer was added after the game was finished and that added more fun to an already good game. It's all about exploration, quests, collecting with some boss battles scattered around the map. I find it a very relaxing game and enjoy filling out map and collecting achievements.

Pros:
Fight pirates
Collect loot
Build or buy ships
Nice progressive map system

Cons:
Simple combat - slash and block mostly

Ihr erwacht auf einer unbekannten Insel (ich glaube bei der aktuellen Version seid ihr dort nicht mehr alleine)
Ihr habt eine komplett leere Karte und sonst nichts. Um euch herum andere Inseln und jede menge Wasser.
Was tut man also? Man versucht andere Inseln zu erkunden und im Prinzip ist dies auch schon alles was ihr in diesem Spiel macht.
Hinzu kommen ein paar tolle Mechaniken die das ganze abhebt von anderen Open-World-Erkundungsspielen.
Vorab, das Spiel f√ºhlt sich extrem unfertig an und wird auch nicht weiter Entwickelt. 
Salt2 steht schon in den Startl√∂chern.

Ihr sucht euch Material zusammen, baut ein Boot und erkundet die Welt.
Die Map f√ºllt sich aber nicht von alleine! Alles was ihr auf eurer Map stehen haben wollt, m√ºsst ihr selbst dort eintragen. Dabei k√∂nnt ihr Orte mit Symbolen, oder sogar mit einem Info-Text markieren.
Auf eurer Reise findet ihr ein paar interessante Quest-NPC's, H√§ndler, jede menge Piraten und noch ein paar andere Bewohner, wir wollen ja mal nicht zuviel Spoilern ;) 
Ihr k√∂nnt gro√üe Schiffe bauen/kaufen/finden und stetig eure Ausr√ºstung, sowie Schiffe ausbessern.
Die Quests erledigen sich eher durch Zufall, meist wisst ihr nicht wo sich euer Ziel befindet und stolpert nach mehreren Stunden erkunden zuf√§llig dar√ºber. Macht euch also nicht verr√ºckt, wenn ihr bei euren Quests nicht weiter kommt.

Das ganze l√§sst sich inzwischen wohl auch im Co-Op zocken, was ich noch nicht ausprobiert habe, aber demn√§chst werde.

Aktuell kostet das Spiel im Angebot 1,49‚Ç¨ und damit Empfehle ich absolut JEDEM sich das Game einmal anzuschauen.

Der Normalpreis von 14,99 ist meiner Meinung nach nicht mal √ºberzogen, kann man √ºber die unfertigen Elemente hinwegsehen.

It's a beautiful cell-shade paradise with great game mechanics, zero character customization, and limited content. At least at the start. The two quests I found were pretty lame: find a pick axe, find a missing treasure so you can get these pantaloons to give to some wacko sailor. 

Your avatar is a near-featureless blob that looks like a mini-staypuff. There are no stats. No builds. The first person view has no hand to hold your weapon. 

Though the islands are plentiful and the raft easy to place in the water, there is little to see. There are plenty of trees and stones everywhere, but the trees can't be chopped, and you don't have a pick axe until you do that quest. There is some variety in what is found on an island. I found pirates on one island, a hunting stand on another. Found no wild life other than birds and deer. There may be other animal types on other islands. I have no intentions to find out. 

the water environment is under-utilized. No fishing that i could see. No ship to ship combat. At least not at the start. No water treasures or sunken ships. Maybe all of this exists in other parts of the game world. Maybe they will be added later.

Au d√©but, on se sent un peu comme dans Ylands, retourn√© √† l'√¢ge de pierre et plus ou moins contraint de prendre la mer en investissant la plus grosse partie de ses ressources dans un radeau peu pratique (mais n√©anmoins suffisant). Apr√®s avoir collect√© ce qu'il faut pour un sailboat et r√©gl√© les probl√®mes de nourriture, on prend vite go√ªt √† se d√©placer d'√Æle en √Æle en se demandant ce que la prochaine cache. Du gibier ? C'est l'heure d'aff√ªter ses fl√®ches et de refaire le plein de viande. Des pirates ? C'est le moment de se battre et de s'enrichir. Et toujours plus de ressources, qui repopent p√©riodiquement (tout comme les ennemis, le gibier, les qu√™tes et les tr√©sors). C'est donc sans fin, pour l'amateur du genre...

Et l√† intervient LE truc qui permet de ne pas tourner en rond en terrain connu : la carte. C'est l'occasion pour que j'explique √† Casstoidla ce que j'en ai compris. La carte est un immense quadrillage vierge sur lequel il faudra dessiner soi-m√™me ce qu'on apprend au fur et √† mesure. Pour cela, deux outils compl√©mentaires. Le sextant permet de donne les coordonn√©es de la position actuelle (au-dessus de la barre d'outils), on peut alors la reporter sur la carte. Si on se trouve sur une √Æle, un clic gauche suffit √† placer une √Æle aux coordonn√©es d√©sign√©es. A droite, plusieurs ic√¥nes permettent de d√©terminer en quoi la position est int√©ressante (marchand, bateau, monument, ruines, etc.). La boussole permet quant √† elle de d√©terminer l'azimut pour se rendre d'un point √† un autre, m√™me si le sextant pourrait √† lui seul permettre de se rep√©rer par localisations successives. A propos d'orientation, une info int√©ressante : dans le jeu, le soleil se l√®ve bien plein est et se couche plein ouest. Utile pour attendre la boussole...

Compte tenu de l'immensit√© de la map, je pense qu'il peut vite devenir r√©barbatif de tout cartographier, mais signaler ses trouvailles me semble indispensable. On pourra √©galement regretter de ne pas pouvoir construire un home sweet home (du moins, dans les premiers temps de la partie). Peut-√™tre un manque, moins √©vident quand on √©lit domicile sur un bateau.

The real tragedy is that the developers are great people, and very limited, but because steam has very few long term support tools other then ""Make a DLC, etc""  they have to make a decision like this if they need money, and basically tank any respect the community has  for them.   I understand it's as much an issue with the platform as the developers, but then again many developers just plod along and stick with something, or reduce their price, rebuild it, get more outside support if they need it, document and broadcast their progress, then pull the price back up once they have a solid product.

This is why Early Access is so risky, will they fulfil their side of the bargain, or will they just stop working on it for two years and then start ""Salt 2"" without finishing the first one. Its bare bones at best, sorry its just not up to scratch even for EA.

Buy this, or the second one theyre making at present, at your own peril. It will probably go the way of the dodo too...

It's also riddled with bugs, QoL problems, and other such glaring issues the devs are too lazy to fix. That they continue to sell a subpar product with so many problems kinda speaks to their character.

And these aren't just your normal design flaws. I tried to boot the game up just tosay to revisit it after 3 years, and found myself plagued with a strange issue where I couldn't select text boxes and my character spun in circles. A trip to the Steam forums confirms this is a gamepad issue that even unplugging my gamepad did not fix. The game is basically unplayable for me now, and the fact this is a KNOWN BUG where the ONLY fix is to UNPLUG YOUR GAMEPAD is asinine. Imagine having to unplug your gamepad to get a game to work.

If you can get past those issues - and I haven't yet - you do have to deal with a game that has a lot of neat ideas which feel mostly under-utilized. It really is half a game. I LIKE the things that are there, I like the way island mapping works, I like sailing around looking for loot, but things like fishing are incredibly shallow and it really feels like an early access game the devs threw up their hands on and just quit one day.

There really is nothing else like it. Its closest contemporaries are games like Sea of Thieves which are grief-heavy MMOs, so the only way I'd recommend it to someone is if they really just want a pirate game that is designed as a ""completable"" solo experience. Unfortunately, this is the best we have for that, and the second something better comes along, I'd jump ship for it immediately.",1614893895,1614893895,False,8,0,0.558643698692321777,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Didn't have any expectation when i bought it. But so far i have a good time with this game.

The exploration and adventure part is very fun and obviously the selling points of the game. The combat isn't satisfying but it does its job well. The story is just there. I think the graphics supposed to be charming and artful, but it also quite ugly to be honest. 

The world is huge, but not always in a good way. It's pretty confusing because as i said earlier that exploration in this game is fun, so the map should be good because of that, right? BUT, the world is so empty making it boring when you sail from one island to another island, and also not every islands are interesting. if the map is like 50% smaller, this game would be more fun and less tedious. And most importantly, the fun of exploring in this game will stand out even more.

Don't know how good this game compared to other similar games like The Forest and ARK though, probably this game is far inferior by a large margin. But hey, it's a VERY cheap game. If this game looks interesting to you, and because of the price alone, might as well just give it a try.

The game is mostly about going from island to island, killing pirates and gathering wood and ores.

There's a few boats to craft but repairing an old pirate ship is the most simple and easy way to get your first floating base and it'll serve you well enough. It's not the fastest but honestly you don't really need to bother with building better boats because they're just a mean to an end (that is going from an island to another) and have no other utility. The Maidens are very nice looking vessels but the pirate ship already offers you more than enough space to place your bed and your chests.

There's no big objective to accomplish or story to follow since it's just a sandbox type of game and what you can do is pretty repetitive. Same thing with the islands; there's thousads of them to explore but it's always the same things you see and after playing a few hours, you have seen everything (except the jungle biome but since its vegetation density is the same as everywhere else, it doesn't feel different) so like I said at the beginning, you either like or dislike that kind of game.

Sail to an island, fight some pirates, buy/sell some stuff, repeat. There seems to be more to the game than that, but it's hard to want to even figure that out when it started to feel tedious like 3 hours in.

I tend to dislike games that make you spend a lot of time managing your inventory, and this game is pretty bad about that. You're constantly picking up loot that includes:
 - Maps (of which you get a lot of duplicates, but it takes a bit of work to find out it's a duplicate), 
 - and of course gear that's like every MMO, where this has +1 to that stat, but your current gear has +1 to this stat, and if I get the set I have +5 to that stat....this shit is not fun when the reason you're trying to min/max is to do better in combat which is extremely basic, awkward, and slow
 - Tons of miscellaneous items like fragments of things, coins for specific purposes, types of food, bait pieces, crates, crappy clothes, etc. 
Which wouldn't be so bad, if you weren't also unable to sell a lot of it, unless you find a vendor that wants those specific items. So you're just constantly carrying around a inventory filled with stuff you don't want, with the choice to either sell it or trash it (which you don't want to do since it's all worth money).",1600623770,1600623770,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is pretty fun but, the game still feels early access and very unfinished but it really nails the sailing and exploration. The combat is rather dull but the bows are fun to use. The survival aspects can be completely ignored as far as I could tell, I'd forget to eat for days and it didn't seem to effect me at all. The multiplayer is rather glitchy and unstable but it does work ok and the game is a lot more fun to play with others.

It's been on my wish list and I snagged it on sale for 1.49. 

I love that you have to  create your own map as you explore - using a sextant and a compass instead of just an auto map really gives the game a unique feature, even giving you a journal to fill out to remember special places and items.

Inventory management has it's ups and downs. I like that there is no weight limit (yet?) and that I can create ""pages"" and sort my items my own way, but having to move items one at a time to get from page to page is tedious. 

Sailing along the ocean and seeing an abandoned ship or a large grey tower on an island is really exciting and makes me feel like an explorer. Trying to navigate tall areas of land and hilly areas is not exciting. 

Combat is easy enough that I don't feel like i'm over powered, but I also have had to turn from a fight a few times as well. Overall this game is very relaxing and I don't really feel rushed, allowing me to do things at my own speed.

I hope there is more coming from this game as I am really enjoying it.",1598131264,1598131264,True,4,1,0.557415485382080078,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Feels incredibly unfinished. Due to the overall lack of content and depth the game is mostly just tedious despite some of the neat core mechanics it implements.

* Combat has no finesse, and hunting is drawn out needlessly between weapon damage and animal health.
* Exploration holds little value since most islands have virtually nothing on them. 
* Gathering materials feels like a chore as you comb cookie cutter islands for logs and specific rocks. (Being unable to cut down trees while holding an axe in my hand feels somewhat frustrating. Only bits of wood you find on the ground are suitable.)
* Crafting seemed shallow and mostly pointless.
* Poor audio and music design.

Even though the gameplay loop is repetitive and combat is extremely shallow. This game requires you to take initiative and seek out things to do. There's a lot of things to do from collecting crafting ingredients or searching out a boss at night, but if you don't choose to do them you'll be wandering around without purpose and you'll get bored pretty quickly. This game doesn't hold anything back and anything can be found, the game has a lot of rare moments and even with many hours in, you'll still find completely crazy and new that you just never expected to find. Personally this keeps me on edge as I feel as if the little noises in the track for the rain actually means a terrifying rare boss will come out at me, you just don't know with how vast the content is. It's a shame development has ceased, as if this were to be built upon, that feeling of excitement and anxiety of genuinely not knowing what could happen would stick around for even longer. However the content we have now is enough to evoke the feeling for at least 20 hours. 

A few mechanics are explained in the help book, but who reads that? Once I figured out the ability to create different sets of items, it completely expanded the way I played, hunting after rare items to give my sailing set a boost, or my running set additional stamina or run speed.

water looks great

sailing at sea is nice and peaceful.

crafting system is well done.


The bad
not able to gather wood from trees,fiber from grass/bushes or stones from some stones.

pirates that don't sail a boat at sea

the world makes no sense, its pirates which don't sail. and people by themselves.
where are the towns and societies? this world would not last. i never saw a single woman either...

navigation is horrible even with the tools you need to find..

islands are bland with little interesting to see on them.

building bigger boats requires a lot more resources and time but they are barely better. you can put a bed/supply box on it as an actually useful feature. otherwise the early boars work well enough.

they should sail significantly faster than the early boats.

The game doesnt tell you alot about each item or boat so when you get something you have to test it out yourself which can make you feel more accomplished.

Do not buy this game even on sale if you haven't tried the demo, it lacks polishing and feels like a beta. You ""can"" have fun with this though, it's very relaxing and there's some fun sides to it but it very much feels like something that was released way too early.

It's all about what you want really, it's hard to explain and everyone will have their own opinion about it. Therefore, you should try the demo.

That having been said, I think they're quite a bit of enjoyment to be had in Salt and with the now added multiplayer it's sale price of ‚Ç¨ 3,74 might yet be worth it.

I cannot however, endorse this kind of practice of releasing a game too soon. It's a bad practice and should not be tolerated under any circumstances, I think we're lucky that Salt turned out the way it did, it could've been much worse.

On one hand, it‚Äôs an endearing, relaxing survivalist game. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ ARK minus dinosaurs times Nintendo. It wants you to survive and explore, and the experience is truly relaxing and easygoing and honestly that‚Äôs nice to see from a game in this genre ‚Äî the whole IT HAS TO BE SUPER HARDCORE thing tends to mean you have to sacrifice your life grinding to experience the game. Not so with Salt. The game is really focused on sailing and boatbuilding, and the feeling of setting out over the water to find new islands is a very good one. It‚Äôs constantly autosaving, so if you do die, you don‚Äôt get set back much. All the islands are full of fruit so you don‚Äôt starve. If you jump in the ocean you don‚Äôt get attacked by sharks and you can‚Äôt drown. And the effect is a good one ‚Äî it‚Äôs a game that feels like a deep breath.

The problem with it, and the main reason it‚Äôs in this post, is that unfortunately the dev abandoned it. It looks like they did juuust enough to justify taking it out of EA and then gave up. And for all it does well, it does feel very unfinished. It never progressed to other boats being on the water, or adding villages to islands, or basebuilding, or a lot of the staples of the genre. There are only a handful of boats to build, there‚Äôs no music, and the AI is not. There are also still lots of bugs. Which is all a shame because it‚Äôs so close to being a very good and pretty unique game. I get that eventually you want to move onto new projects as a developer, but it is hugely disappointing. There‚Äôs just not enough here, certainly not enough for a $14.99 sticker price ‚Äî that it some audacious shit. (I paid $3.74 for it which is the upper end of fair.)

This is actually the first time I‚Äôve gotten burned by an EA purchase, incidentally. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm particularly judicious, but I do buy EA games from some frequency and I‚Äôve had a pretty great experience with the system ‚Äî past purchases include ARK, My Time at Portia, Slime Rancher and Staxel.

Buy it when it's like 30-40% off
Now in detail:

GRAPHICS were the most frustrating thing, even though it looks beautiful in general, the NPC's look a bit too simplistic to me (clothes are great, but their body shape omg). Also there's a big problem whem hunting on an island. If the animals would always be marked I'd be okay with it but god damn it, everytime deer run off even on small islands it's so hard to find them again. Especially with lots of grass or rain the footprints don't help at all! And cause of the sometimes crowded-feeling environment you can't differentiate a deer from a rock or tree from a certain distance. So frustrating. I also find it helpful but weird that you can sometimes see campfires from far away but not the outline of the island it's sitting on. 

ANIMALS are so weird when it comes to hunting, aiming with your bow seemed quite intuitive when it comes to deers but I haven't shot down a single bird up until now, oof. You also have to stand on a big enough mountain to do the latter as they only seem to fly on a certain height. You do know that birds sometimes fly higher, lower or even sit down?

FOOD was the only thing you seemed to have to worry about if you kept away from pirates until you got a good weapon and took them seperately but honestly... I've had an empty food bar for a long time now and it doesn't seem to matter. Which is nice, since there are little to no apples (which even if you sometimes can't even grab) and you often just don't want to hunt or have deers nearby. So only before/ after a battle should you eat to get that health regen.

MAP is the one thing I found the most interesting/ original, since it doesn't reveal at a certain radius around me, which I found super boring in all games that do this. Instead, when you have your sextant (and maybe compass) ready to determine your location you put the islands in yourself! Sure I'd like some kind of checkmark to tell me that I put the islands in the right spot or something to feel confirmed with but just this little thing adds so much as said by others!

EXPLORATION is the thing you should do to enjoy this. DON'T try to stay on every small island for too long, see your boat as your base and home. Islands should be more like mines, in which you stay a while till you got all you need (especially chests) and then go on to put the next one on your map. You'll just end up confused if you try to even remember where exactly what is on an island.",1574624148,1574624148,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However its quite fun, especially if you have a player being a good cartographer. Its notably calm on the seas and can be very relaxing.

Boat physics are buggy when you tp to people on them or move them via 'replacing them down' in the sense that its Gmod physics going wild. Nothing breaks and no one dies, but its certainly amusing.

Multiplayer
-Loot is instanced, so everyone gets their own loot(randomized for most things).
-You can trade with other players.
-You can assist with sails or steering on boats that are not yours and such.
-Light sources (handheld) are for both you and them.
-HOWEVER, you LACK the ability to utilize placed equipment on boats that are not yours, like chests and I think torch holders and such. (You might be able to use the cannons).
-You also cannot place items on boats that you do not own.

Aside some rounding out on multiplayer aspects, i think this game is excellent. If you had a small group of friends willing to play together as a crew then I would estimate the value of this game to be 15-20 dollars. It has a small sense of feeling unpolished, maybe that is mostly the multiplayer mechanics, but as a whole it feels as a rather nice and fulfilled game.

There's little to actually do, there's a few simple ""quests"", which are more just fetch missions. The game is riddled with bugs, and the ""pirates"" and more just hostile island dwellers. They never ride in actual pirate ships or attack you on the sea. Combat is lackluster at best, essentially coming down to clicking on enemies and running away if they are too strong. The graphics are poor and at a distance islands can look pretty ugly.

But where Salt really shines is in an area few other games can. The sense of exploration you get from just sailing around is unparalleled. The loneliness is strangely comforting. Oftentimes you don't really know where you're going, and you don't care. You just want to see what you find. Even when its the 1000th pirate island, or just a small desert island with a trader, it always somehow feels exiting. The game gives you a blank map, and its up to you to fill it out. It might not be for everyone but I personally loved charting my progress and marking islands I found on the map. It made everything feel more personalized, like you really are the first one to chart these unknown lands. 

The ships are probably the best modeled part of the entire game, and they should be. You spend the majority of the time on your ship, sailing between the many islands, so might as well be proud of it. The sense of achievement when you acquire some of the larger ships is wonderful. You grow attached to them as you personalize them and live upon them. They become like a home, and the sight of your galley silhouetted off the shore of the island you just explored is always welcoming.

The simplistic art might not work all the time, but it mirrors the core simple aspect of exploration. Everything seems calming, even if that means it isn't particularly gorgeous. It doesn't need to be. It's simple and welcoming. Just charting a course for the nearest inn island and sailing there, which would normally be a menial and boring task, is somehow enjoyable. When that music kicks in you don't care that you aren't really doing anything. You're alone on the high seas, on your trusty ship, and it's homely.

Though a lot of enjoyment can be had from calming solo exploration, the game does benefit from multiplayer as well. The multiplayer can be buggy at times, as with the rest of the game, but is nonetheless entertaining. You and your mates can form a more concrete plan for your sailing, seeking out Pirate Kings Outposts or the elusive Jungle Island. As homely as your ship may seem by yourself, it is even more so with friends onboard. They can also significantly help in fighting bosses, which are often difficult by yourself (in part due to the lacking combat mechanics).

On the topic of price, I can't say I recommend the game too highly at full price. With the little amount of actual content it contains, I do not believe the enjoyable exploration aspect enough compensates to the pricetag. However, if you can purchase the game on sale I highly recommend it, provided you like simple exploration.",1569232280,1569232280,True,28,0,0.717272639274597168,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It is a small game and has limited content so yes it becomes repetitive after a while, this would be my biggest complaint about it, however at the price it's hardly fair to hold this against it.

I would describe Salt as a slow paced archipelago-exploration cartographer's experience. At the time of this review I've played 20 hours and I'm still only getting started... Honestly even after repairing a ship and getting enough resources to make several chests and boxes, that was just positioning myself to begin my journey across the deep blue sea.

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] There's lore in the game books... But much like Elder scrolls lore books, I only read when the curiosity outweighs my desire to explore... or I'm never curious and your books go unread; however there were some funny books in Oblivion and Skyrim that I did actually read.

Why did you wake up on an island? Who knows. Not me. I choose to believe that my character was born from one of the fruit trees [i]...and that's why he has a chronic fear of using axes on chopping down trees because that would be so much nicer then picking up wood on the ground one log at a time![/i] GAH!

There is a quest based system, even a quest log, but I had the darndest time trying to figure out the user interface. Inconsistent playing sessions didn't do me any favors here... And I can't review what a quest giver wanted, other than a tiny note saying ""Find the Pirate Hat in the Silver Chest, on the island with orange grass and stumps"". Thanks Game... I'll do that... coordinates would be nice, but you'll leave those to me to figure out in Cartographer simulator 2018.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Salt is as free an open as a game can be... Almost too open ended. You wake up on an island and gather materials to make a raft. TADA your tutorial-hand-holding phase is done!

This is what everyone longing for player freedom wants, right? It's that moment after you step out of the sewers in Elder Scrolls Oblivion. It's after you leave the first zone in the Witcher 3. ...Only now you're hit with the quandary: ""Uhhh... what now?""

Well, there was some guy talking about finding an Inn... and some light that would bring me to it... but I didn't find an Inn until 19 hours into the game and looking on the steam discussion page for hints.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2250226508

So... I can't tell you much more about questing in this game because 20 hours in, and I'm starting to figure out how it works myself because I just found the stupid Inn.
But I hear you asking inquisitive reader ""Atratzu, what did you do for those first 19 hours?"" I'm so glad you asked!

I floated around on a raft worrying about what would happen if my inventory filled up (It never did by the way),  I would press the M button occasionally and then get scared and close it. I keep calling this ""cartographer-simulator"" because it's your job to get the tool that tells you your coordinates, then you need to mark down where the islands are! When you start a new game and press M, you see NOTHING... you scroll through the infinity and it looks a lot like Algebra graph paper, and I didn't like that. Nope nope, not one bit. [i](To be fair, as you mark islands it gets kind of refreshing and pleasant ------ to think that no one is to blame for cartography errors but me, OH GOD WHY!)[/i]

After floating along I came across a trashy pirate ship, but HEY it's a freaking ship! So I repaired it and then took a year hiatus where I played a bunch of other games [i](Including Raft)[/i] and moved IRL.

Eventually I was guilt ridden and came back to finish what I started. But now I had to relearn everything... thankfully this old salt sea dog can learn new tricks.

So I set out again! This time with intent to at least get more of the achievements... at least more than 2 of 29. It's about this time that the Stockholm syndrome set in, and I thought ""well, at least this is relaxing"".

However, again note... I now had a decent sea vessel, cabin space, I could summon my raft whenever I needed, I had resources saved up. So I think it's very safe to say I restarted playing at a good time, because I was already set up. The only problem was I still had/have NO idea where I'm going and what I'm doing.

I came across a spider Queen, and I murdered her face. I found a pirate boss completely by accident, and murdered his face. ...Mind you I got some decent armor from some pirates because it seems completely random where strong and weak pirates are located.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] Looking back over this review. I feel like I haven't really started to explain Salt... much like how I'm 20 hours in and I haven't even started PLAYING salt. This is the type of game that will appeal to certain people, mostly those who like extremely free player experience, and have lots of patience for clunky cumbersome user interface.
It has the staples of most highly popular games: Crafting, combat, exploration, survival, sandbox... however it lacks a level of polish that leaves others frustrated and exasperated.

I'll try to explain more and cover more basic mechanics, and extrapolate in my video on Salt. If you're curious I'd encourage you to check it out. Otherwise, I hope this review has been useful for you, thanks for reading!

Salt is an interesting game. It's got an extremely long plot, near infinite amounts of (admittedly fairly similar, but still enjoyable) gameplay, and is very much a slow burn. [b]You will not get 'good', or even arguably do anything meaningful in your first hour - or 8[/b]. You may very well even end up hating the game for it. Many of the reviews from people with less than an hour reflect this - do I blame them? Are they 'wrong'? No. 

It took me a lot of frustration in the early game, at how slow the gameplay was, at how confusing navigation was for me, as I'm sure it was for every new player, without a Compass or Sextant to tell me my positions and directions - I do still have many incorrectly mapped islands from my first 20 hours - and at how much of a grind it was for me, stranded on a starter island, waiting around for a good real-life hour, waiting for wood to spawn (missing the fact that you could open up the crates a certain [spoiler]Mysterious Figure[/spoiler] was sitting on), so I could repair the raft).

Yes, it was tedious. But it did have its fun moments, even back then. And, after another few hours of discovery, exploration, and frustration at the Raft's less-than-perfect, extremely basic steering mechanism, I built a new boat, and was relieved at the significantly easier steering. I also discovered an [spoiler]Ancient Island[/spoiler], and got multiple very helpful weapons 
and ammunition from [spoiler]Hunter&Pirate Challenge Chests[/spoiler] which really got me interested in the game.
After that, it really got interesting. But that's for you to find out, if you decide to buy Salt.

The soundtrack is additionally fantastic, and - unlike most survival games - you don't need to keep constant track of a bunch of meters to stay alive. It's really worth a try. And as if all the content currently in the game wasn't enough, it's still being developed.

Every time I start a new playthrough, I head in a different direction and just try to enjoy myself. Whether it's in the quest for bigger and better ships or better equipment, I enjoy my time, no matter what.

I remember the first time I played this game seriously and for longer than a few hours, and it was an awesome experience. I repaired the old pirate ship, then began sailing north, for days on end, occasionally foraging on islands, and that was fun. But the part that really sold me was then writing down my adventures into my own little journal.

Doing little things like that really made me immerse myself in the game, to try and actually build a character, rather than just be controlling a completely blank slate of a character. In fights, I'd try to be smart about what I did, rather than just having potions and bandages galore and simply whaling on people with the sharpest stick I could find.

Now, I don't agree with the developers calling the game finished. I think that, just like with Shoppe Keep 1, there's still a lot of polishing that needs doing, since the game is a little bit broken sometimes. But, despite that, I'm satisfied with the game as it is, and would recommend to anybody interested in the game to try the demo out, and maybe snap the game up when it goes on sale during the next Summer Sale.",1560779698,1560779698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is probably the first unpopular game I've played where I think the devs lack in a bunch of stuff (their graphics handler seems to be inexperienced, even for indie standards) but seem to have alot of potential in many of the other areas. I won't get into any of the nitty-gritty of why I will follow these devs into their next project since this a review. Before I get into it though, I DO want to make it clear that...

There's a lot more content to it than you think, trust me. Keep exploring.

[h1]The Review (Spoiler Free)[/h1]

[b]Positives[/b]

What the game really does really well encourage exploration. The devs vision clearly aligns to scattering the lore, tips, loot, and quests all across the world. You may find a strange pillar with no idea on what to do with it. You may wonder how on earth do you climb a tall mountain with a smoke coming out of the top. You may wonder if there are other islands besides the generic plains ones. All of the information are scattered randomly throughout loot, which really enhances the exploration aspect for the game, especially early on. This is one of the few games I've played where you don't explore to look for fun, but to explore because you want to learn more about the world and the tales in it. 

Another thing that the game does really well is do the said exploration in a pirate way. A really good pirate way infact. Probably the best I've seen. If you're looking for a game that really captures the [i]Sailing the Seven Seas[/i] type of playstyle, this is the best on the market. Wind Waker is the only game of this category that (obviously) beats this game in terms of sheer quality and gameplay, but Wind Waker doesn't have the extra quirks of sailing and pirate-type details that Salt does. This game also follows the myth/legends road that traditional pirate stories take, which really immerses you to be a pirate in this game (and yes, I also think Sid Meier's Pirates is a better game than Salt, but that game is too vastly different to be comparable to a pirate game like this).

So what the game does positively is best immerse you into the pirate gameplay. Along with being unique on the market, these unfortunately are where the positives end.

[b]Negatives[/b]

I wanna start by addressing the positives I had. The ideas the game has itself is superb. The execution, however, is only satisfactory at best, and at worse, dogshit. I seriously have no comment for the optimization and graphics for this game. Obviously, whoever handles the graphics and optimization is massively inexperienced, and its most likely the devs themselves, with some revolutionary-potential ideas but no asthetic prowess/vision, drawing the barf terrain and oversaturated leaf sway. Doing some of the quests seem enticing. Later on, you'll uncover some potentially sinister enemies, but the enemies themselves look like the [url=https://www.pillsbury.com/doughboy] Doughboy from Pillsbury[/url]. If you couple this with the lack of sea enemies as you go about sailing around, its clear that these ideas are shrouded with barebones effort.

Gameplay is extremely straight forward, blocking seems almost unoptimal (even while parrying exists, as a block seems to have a longer start-up than 2 sword swings. Kiting the enemy is not very reliant, though exploitable if you experiment enough to see how it works. Is realistically impossible in multiplayer. [i]Note to low spec users: When I played this on my old laptop, me and my friend took actual coffee breaks when we landed on a new island because the loading time was so slow that pirates, trees, wood, and such only loaded AFTER being on the island for 10 minutes. For each island.[/i]

Unpolishness is another downfall to this game. Back in Alpha (I pirated the game at that time [strike]seriously no pun intended[/strike]), there was no crafting hints. This made the tips and recipes books extremely valuable, and really made collecting every item worth it, as you have no idea if it was needed for quests or would really enhance your stats and exploration. Crafting hints work similarly to current Minecraft crafting hints, and seemingly were added due to the almost severe lack of guide/hand holding. Though interesting, it made first impressions really unpredictable due to the nature of RNG islands. You would have either knew how to craft a bow in 2 islands, or in 20. Though an alright fix to that, has made the guide books to crafting swords, bows, torches, and even the rare items largely useless, as all players magically know how to craft stuff. This is just one major flaw, along with others, that slide into this category of major unpolishness that seem to reek the end result of this product.

[b]TL;DR[/b]
Though this game is extremely unpolished and uncreatively executed with some novel ideas and visions on the pirate take, the main aspects of immersing yourself as a pirate are largely there. If you dont give a shit about graphics, essentially whacking your enemies to death, and just wanna live the pirate dream (better than Sea of Thieves in vision imo), this is the game for you. This game does not hold your hand, and knows you played this game to be a pirate, doing everything it can to help you reach that. Why do I recommend this game? Because I just wanna sail around and loot shit.",1560082227,1560082227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That being said I do not find this game is anywhere near completed. 
Some of my main issue the following; 

Chests of ships can only be opened by the ship owner. There is no friend system in place to allow sharing. (you can trade but that's so much more time and basically because there is no limit on inventory makes chests useless.) 

There are no dangers on the open sea. You can equip and use canons on your ships which is really cool however there is 0 reason other than decorations to do so. 

If they are going to call this game completed then at the very least I would like to see an open server list in game so that you can join other players worlds and at least have some open water sea battles. 
That being said for this game to be in a completed stage I think they need to include a friend system for chests, limit the on hand inventory to about 3 pages and to have pirates sail the seas and attack your boat/require you to repair it from time to time. 

That being said if you ever get the chance to get the game for the 4$ price do it. You will have enough fun with the game that, that is worth the price.

 Why is this bow and arrow so crappy? It just falls and that's it!

Apparently, in this universe, the torches are waterproof and lose their light after a while. Wish I knew how to light it again.

So I found this island thanks to a map that I ""borrowed"". Seems like a good place to summon demons so I set up a campfire. If only I knew how to make a tent. But that's probably not important.

This game is fun with friends, i currently have 2 other people and we split up are roles  I'm the captain, friend 1 is the nav, friend 3 is the brute. Food isnt a issue but more options down the road would be great.  Hitting trees is the easiest way to get food and Fishing is hella fun.

I recommend not using max setting as there is a lot of thing to render like the water and trees that could easily heat your gpu if you didn't bother to set a proper fan curve. If it rains best thing to do is just sleep a whole cycle that stuff is semi killer to fps

Hmmm.....  A game of wait for the light...  Then spend a few minutes playing until it's dark again.  Half of the day is too dark to see much.  Another obviously failed ea title using Unity.   Wish these ea devs would stop using both Unity and Unreal......  not one ea title has ever successfully used them.  All have graphical and performance issues.  With an i7 8700k 16GB RAM and a 1070ti.... I'd expect over 60fps with max settings for this arcade, very limited textured detailed game, but something causes it to run around 25-30fps.

Hard to believe the devs have another title in the works when this one has obviously never been completed.

The game does have the idea down....  Like so many of these titles where the gameplay so many want is there, but it's just not up to par and falls flat due to the lack of dev time spent.

Can't recommend the game but can recommend the effort.  Just wish someone would finally get it right and on a AAA level.

Second impression.

The darkness..... Once you understand that it is part of the game it becomes easier to deal with.  Getting to that point where you can do things at night is a little slow.  Knowing that torches actually lose brightness as they age helps.
After playing many hours I can see the attraction.  The gameplay elements are there in a great way.  And I can see why it should be a classic.

Take this gameplay, add realistic graphics, a more realistic approach to sailing and the ship damage with repairs..... with a MP aspect you could have a huge hit.  Add some minimal base building.  Take the approach of a safe base that anyone can visit if they want they just can't destroy a thing unless allowed.  The allowed part would be setting up targets for other players to hit with cannons to gain access to a locked chest..... lots of possibilities for PvE and PvP with how it's set up.

Changing to recommend.  Was nice not expecting anything.....loading it up...seeing that it has issues with quality while thinking ...""oh no here we go again with another ea title"".. but discovering that it has much more to offer if you can get through the start.

Funny.....then came Atlas.  Where Salt Devs made SP fun, Atlas devs can't seem to do AI or game design worth the effort.  Atlas devs could learn a lot from the Salt devs. :)",1555012095,1587601161,True,8,0,0.494421511888504028,0,True,False,False,False,,,

To call this a ‚Äúbad game‚Äù is an insult to the other wastes of money on steam, so let‚Äôs refer to it as what it really is, interactive shame. At first glance this seems like a typical adventure game, wander about, interact with npcs, fight enemies, and things of that nature, in some respects all of that is true. You explore a bland lifeless world, talk to npcs with puddle deep personalities, and frantically flail your twig of a sword at whatever it is you‚Äôre trying to kill. Welcome to Salt. 

To start off I need to talk about the graphics. I usually don‚Äôt care if a game looks hyper realistic or not, especially if it‚Äôs stylized and knows how to look good despite it possibly being rather crude and unpolished. But Salt is in a whole other league of ugly, it somehow manages to not only look like s**t, but run like it too. I tinkered around in the settings, and it doesn‚Äôt really seem to make a difference if I have the settings at max or minimum, it‚Äôs still choppy and terrible. Which is totally unlike the wonderfully immersive gameplay, speaking of which.

Wow, wasn‚Äôt that a great transition? So the gameplay consists of the following, walk, fight pirate, run away from pirate because he hits like a freight train at full speed, heal, do this over and over until you kill the pirate, loot him, search the island for supplies, build a raft from what you found, sail to new island, repeat until you realize the futility of your existence, quit the game, and write a review to distract yourself from the existential crisis that this game induced. In all seriousness, I slogged through this torture for two hours today and I feel absolutely no urge to ever return to it. You might say that it is unfair for me to criticize Salt without having put more time into it, but I have to strongly disagree, I put more time into this thing than any sane person should. I got to the point where I could build a proper sailboat that would replace my raft, if there is a difference between the two other than aesthetics and how you utilize the awkward controls, I certainly couldn‚Äôt tell you. After this I gave up a few minutes later, because I realized it would be the same cycle of suffering until I got the biggest ship in the ‚Äúgame‚Äù and then I‚Äôd have even less of a reason to trek through the barren endless ocean. It‚Äôs painfully slow and monotonous, I doubt that this would have changed at any point during my ordeal, and honestly I‚Äôm not willing to find out. When I have to waste a substantial amount of my time in a game, just for the possibility that I might get to have fun at some point far in the future, that is as good a reason as any to cut my losses and quit, because that is a greater cost than one could ever write on a price tag.

I left Salt feeling depressed and defeated, it‚Äôs not just because I thought it was bad, it‚Äôs because it felt hollow. I got the feeling that no one cared when making this, that this was just a paycheck to them and that they put in the minimum amount of effort required. If something is bad, but it feels like someone put some heart into it, like they actually tried, then it is a lot easier to overlook some flaws, but this just feels soulless. I‚Äôm sorry that I played this, but even more so that someone had to make this. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs on sale, or if they‚Äôre offering to pay you to play this, don‚Äôt. Forget you ever saw this and you‚Äôll better off for it. Goodbye, I pray you never come to this place again, I wish I had never ventured here, much less purchased a ticket to go farther.

There's little to actually do, there's a few simple ""quests"", which are more just fetch missions. The game is riddled with bugs, and the ""pirates"" and more just hostile island dwellers. They never ride in actual pirate ships or attack you on the sea. Combat is lackluster at best, essentially coming down to clicking on enemies and running away if they are too strong. The graphics are poor and at a distance islands can look pretty ugly.

But where Salt really shines is in an area few other games can. The sense of exploration you get from just sailing around is unparalleled. The loneliness is strangely comforting. Oftentimes you don't really know where you're going, and you don't care. You just want to see what you find. Even when its the 1000th pirate island, or just a small desert island with a trader, it always somehow feels exiting. The game gives you a blank map, and its up to you to fill it out. It might not be for everyone but I personally loved charting my progress and marking islands I found on the map. It made everything feel more personalized, like you really are the first one to chart these unknown lands. 

The ships are probably the best modeled part of the entire game, and they should be. You spend the majority of the time on your ship, sailing between the many islands, so might as well be proud of it. The sense of achievement when you acquire some of the larger ships is wonderful. You grow attached to them as you personalize them and live upon them. They become like a home, and the sight of your galley silhouetted off the shore of the island you just explored is always welcoming.

The simplistic art might not work all the time, but it mirrors the core simple aspect of exploration. Everything seems calming, even if that means it isn't particularly gorgeous. It doesn't need to be. It's simple and welcoming. Just charting a course for the nearest inn island and sailing there, which would normally be a menial and boring task, is somehow enjoyable. When that music kicks in you don't care that you aren't really doing anything. You're alone on the high seas, on your trusty ship, and it's homely.

Though a lot of enjoyment can be had from calming solo exploration, the game does benefit from multiplayer as well. The multiplayer can be buggy at times, as with the rest of the game, but is nonetheless entertaining. You and your mates can form a more concrete plan for your sailing, seeking out Pirate Kings Outposts or the elusive Jungle Island. As homely as your ship may seem by yourself, it is even more so with friends onboard. They can also significantly help in fighting bosses, which are often difficult by yourself (in part due to the lacking combat mechanics).

On the topic of price, I can't say I recommend the game too highly at full price. With the little amount of actual content it contains, I do not believe the enjoyable exploration aspect enough compensates to the pricetag. However, if you can purchase the game on sale I highly recommend it, provided you like simple exploration.",1549183125,1549183125,True,113,5,0.879390954971313477,4,False,False,False,False,,,

The combat is super rng, and has no actual combat mechanics. You spam right click and sometimes left click. The combat is either ""spam potions and press right click on the pirates"" or ""right click, see that the pirate hurts at lot, run and spam potions, fire arrows while running, run up, right click to attack, and repeat"". The big bosses are especially bad at this. Either you get him one-on-one and destroy him, albeit losing quite a bit of health, or you somehow manage to attract him and five of his goons and get insta-gibbed. All you can hope for is a good drop or find like I managed to do.

The world is so fucking buggy, and even on low, I have to save and reload for all the textures to load in.

Fine material is a fucking pain in the ass to collect/craft. 

Finding pirates on a huge island to get your chest of goodies is a fucking pain in the ass. There are no markers or anything, all you get is this tiny fucking yellow arrow, to the point where I've spent a good 20 minutes trying to find just 5 pirates. 

There is no actual map. All you get are ""maps"" that tell you where a location is. Then you have to use a compass and sextant. While realistic(?), it's so goddamn dumb. I actually don't know if your journal has a map, because there is no good tutorial system, and when I click on map, all I get is a regular journal to record some coordinates. 

You can't chop down trees. You have to find the logs on the ground. What the heck?

Fetch quests. Oh god, the fetch quests.

The graphics and quality look so bad.

The game just feels unfinished. When you want to record in your journal, you have to pause the game. I can't count the amount of bugs I've encountered or the amount of times I've almost want to rage quit because of the shitty combat. There's a lot of downtime when sailing to distant locations where you just do nothing. The game itself relies too much on the pirates, and not enough on exploration itself. It feels like a Korean RPG grind, just doing the same thing over, and over, and over again on islands, until you get to that one unique one.

And yet...

This game is amazing. 

Sure, it's potential was ruined, and it feels unfinished. But it still feels good. It feels nostalgic. It gives you a sense of accomplishment like no other, when you finally finish a task. 

The exploration is top notch. Theres nothing like island-hopping killing some [strike]Japs[/strike] pirates, and moving on. While downtime can be bad, it's also good in this. It gives you time to think, and craft. It's great being isolated, just being on your own and basking in the sunlight.

The bad quality and textures add to the charm. While shitty, it's just nice to look at. It makes you want to sit down on the top of a mountain, and just relax. I've only managed to get a sailboat so far, but even by itself, the little thing just looks so homely. 

Sailing is fun, and it feels fluid, charting a course is pretty darn nice too. 

And the music, oh god the music. It almost never plays, but when you're just out exploring an island, with the sunlight filtering through the trees, and the music starts, it's so peaceful and chill. It's really nice. 

This game offers a feeling of isolation and exploration no other game has been able to. The feeling when you finally wipe out an island of pirates is something a lot of games try to replicate, but none really do. Crafting is nice and simple, which I enjoy a lot. 

This game could benefit a lot from a workshop, like GMOD, where you could install mods. That could push the game into something fantastic, and far beyond what it already is. This game has so much untapped potential.

7/10 for this game. It manages to enthrall me in it everytime I play, and gives me a feeling like no other. It's definetely not for everyone though. It's not worth the $15 price tag, so wait for it to go on a major sale, and grab it then. $5-$8 is my recommended price.",1548653364,1556066462,True,36,13,0.598783433437347412,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Most models look like garbage and the game runs like crap on older machines as of 2019.
The combat is atrocious, I mean just awful, Its like a random number generator but somehow worse, the hitboxes are wack and combat is so unfair that the creator actually gives you a ""Rage quit"" function upon death that exits the game, as combat is the only real danger.
This game is unpolished and ocasionally bethesda level buggy, it could use some improvement on a lot of things, particularly textures, combat, user interface, and some small improvements to navagation.

Without OP PLZ NERF weapons and armor even the lowest level pirates actually pose a threat.

On larger islands its very hard to find the last couple pirates and even with the help the game gives you it can take MUCH longer than it should to find them.

You can't chop down trees and that bothers me wayyyy more than it should.
----

Even with all its flaws, I keep coming back to this game for at least 3 or 4 hours at a time.
It captures a sense of isolation and validation for your hard work that many games try to accomplish and fall flat.

Exploration is almost on the same level as games like minecraft, absolutely phenominal.
In addition to this, particularly with the larger vessels, the sailing feels uncannly similar to games like Assassins creed black sail, that is to say excellent and realistic feeling without the work.
It is however for better or worse much more lonely.
While many prefer the isolation whilst exploring, myself included, there are a couple of things you can do to pass the time while sailing between islands, chief among them fishing and navigating, which adds to the realism and keeps things entertaining.

Crafting is pretty basic but it gets the job done simply and efficently. Its also rather extensive with lots of useful decorative items that you can customize your ship with.
Hunger works for the game rather than against it.

Because of the poor quality of the terrain and foliage textures, the ships (particularly the later ones) look almost beautiful by comparison and perhaps subtly encourage you to get back on the ship and keep moving.

This is a interesting, heartfelt and independently made game that despite its various glaring flaws, shines like a diamond in the rough of all the unfinshed/""finished"" early access beta games that plauged steam when greenlight was starting out.

While in its current state it doesn't warrant the 15$ price, I would pay 10$ all day.



Fantastic bones with interesting and enthralling exploration, decent crafting with rewarding loot and navigation but utter garbage combat and poor quality textures.

PROS:

+GREAT soundtrack
+Survival system is very simple (could be a negative point too)
+Pretty complex crafting system
+Runs smoothly even on low end rigs
+Character models are cute <3
+Quests/Stories/Npc's are entertaining

CONS:
-The combat system is too simple, that's definitely not its best selling point.
-Many glitches remain in the latest version (quite a lot actually)

I purchased this at full price and got WAY more than my moneys worth. There was nothing I found in Salt to dislike, except that I can't stop playing it (off-line SP). I had to force myself to take a short break to type this. Really.

Okay, I do have one complaint, but it involves my under-powered hardware. However, Salt has seen to it that there are plenty of graphics settings to allow even my slow machine to run it fairly nicely.

FPS is my main love, and Salt provides for this - in this case it would be First Person Slasher. Adventure, exploration, gathering, crafting, survival and more all provided by Salt.

And sailing! I have a great fondness for the water, and Salt has plenty of it. Sailing on a foggy sea, and watching an uncharted Island slowly rising up and appearing through the mist... just for me to explore. Nice. Maybe there will be pirates for me to slice and dice, or maybe not. If not, perhaps there might be deer, or some nice fat fowl. Then I could get in a bit of bow hunting. But I can, if I want, let the island wait, while I drop sail and drown a few worms. You never know what you're gonna catch in these waters.

Weather effects, day night cycle, the ocean swells, all add to the enjoyment.

As I continue to play, more aspects of the game become apparent. The attention to detail is amazing. It is obvious to me that the devs spent a lot of time thinking the project through.

And to top it off, there is even a demo version to check out. To avoid spoilers, I would only suggest being patient at the start. Once you get going it just keeps getting better.

I could go on and on about how awesome Salt is, but the waves are calling and I'm outta here.

I really enjoyed playing Salt! Most of the systems are really basic so I understand the calls that the game is boring. I didn't find that to be the case. I thought sailing between islands was relaxing and since you need to make the map yourself there's a real sense of discovery. I was always interested to see what was going to be on the next island.

Die Grafik ist f√ºr meinen Geschmack fantastisch. Eigenwillig, aber hat man erst eine Weile gespielt entdeckt man den Charm dieser eigenwilligen Grafik. Leider fehlen dem Spiel elementare Bestandteile, die es ""lebendig"" wirken lassen w√ºrden. Eine Welt aus Inseln die es zu erkunden gilt. Sch√§tze zu finden und neue Rezepte zu entdecken die man craften kann. Nur gibt es so gut wie keine Zivilisation und die die es gibt besteht aus vereinzelten H√§ndlern und Questgebern und einem Haufen Piraten, die man einfach nur t√∂ten kann.

Ich pers√∂nlich w√ºrde dem Spiel 30-40 Stunden Spieltiefe geben. Ab dann habt ihr in der Regel alles erreicht was man erreichen kann und wart dabei recht langsam. Man kann keine eigenen Geb√§ude bauen, um so eine Insel vielleicht zu seinem zu Hause zu machen. Die Kartensteuerung, bzw. das erstellen einer Solchen ist derma√üen umst√§ndlich, dass ohne √úbung ein Questgeber kaum wieder zu finden ist. Eine gute Multiplayer-Plattform ist nicht vorhanden. Und NPC Mannschaften gibt es keine. Die Steuerung der Schiffe ist zu Begin interessant, wird aber schnell einfach nur noch nervig. Am besten f√§hrt es sich mit dem einfachsten und kleinsten Segelboot. Kisten und Material lagert man dann auf seinem n√§chst gr√∂√üeren Schiffen, die ja jederzeit an jedem beliebigen Ort einfach gespawnt werden k√∂nnen (Samt Aufbauten und Inhalt).

Alles in allem ein tolles Konzept, mit viel zu wenig Inhalt. Einer katastrophalen Map-Steuerung, einer toten, fast lieblosen Welt und dummen bis stumpfen Feinden, die es oft nichtmal Wert sind, dass man sie noch umbringt.

Sehr schade, da dieses Spiel ja nichtmal √ºber die Community mit Mods versorgt werden kann.

I'm a boat guy as well so I was looking forward to that aspect of the game. Unfortunately, the potential for fun here quickly becomes a dull, boring and repetitive grind. Literally all you do is sail around, find an island, look for crafting materials, kill the occasional pirate, then rinse and repeat.

For an exploration game, I was surprised to see that the game world in general feels utterly deserted - 10 hours in and about 20 or so islands explored, the only people I've encountered are the occasional pirate, the occasional merchant, and the innkeeper (who I've seen once). There are no boats out on the ocean apart from you. It's a very strange, unengaging experience.

The game revolves around progressing via its crafting system however the crafting feels unfinished and unpolished - it's unintuitive, clunky and unrewarding. For a game that is centred around crafting, this is really a shame and I feel like it could use a lot of improvement.

The combat, as others have pointed out, is amateurish at best and it feels as though the only reason it exists is to give the player a reason to go exploring for loot. 

My biggest complaint is the way materials gathering has been implemented. It is unrewarding, illogical and boring. For example, there are trees everywhere on every island but you cannot cut down a single tree to get wood - the mechanic doesn't exist. Instead you must roam every island you see in the hopes of seeing a piece of wood you can collect. Also, several materials that are required for progress in the game, are only available as random 'uncommon' spawns in random places, which makes crafting progression particularly with the boats extremely frustrating and depressing.

Strangely enough, the day/night cycle doesn't seem to matter or impact on anything other than stressfully forcing you in the early/mid game, to land on an island and quickly make a fire before night falls. I've read that night time is supposed to bring monsters, but I've so far only encountered the occasional pirate so I can't comment on that. I feel like there should be an option to just have it always day since night time doesn't seem to matter.

If you want to spend hours and hours grinding repetitively and aimlessly for the occasional crafting material then Salt might be worth a look but otherwise there are way better options in this genre.

So this game has been abandoned. It left EA and was officially released without it being totally polished, yet it does work. So it's not one of those games that was released in a broken state or where the devs forgot about it after selling it as EA. I don't want to rip on the devs as they did the bare minimum to statisfy their requirements, but they defiintely didn't do anything beyond the bare minimum so they're not exactly praise worthy. There's just so many bad devs that abandon projects in EA because it's not profitable enough that these guys may seem like good guys in comparison .... maybe they are sadly.

This is a crafting game with survival elements. It's definitely focused more on exploration though. Sailing the open seas is definitely the focal point of this game and it's also where it falls apart. There just isn't all that much worth discovering. Almost every island looks the same. There are differences obviously. You'll come across merchants, pirates, deers, spiders, cultists and lots and lots of birds. 

And yes some islands will have some ancient cultist stattue or some merchant structures that will differentiate it from other island. Yet, in the end, 90% of the stuff looks the same as the previous island you were on. And there's just some mechanics that are puzzling. LIke you can't cut trees down, you can only find them. You can mine some ore nodes but not others (usually not if they look big). Plants are rare to see. The rarest item to get is probably the plant fiber. Because plants are just rare to see and even when you pick one there's no guarantee you'll get a plant fiber. And you'll need several to fix the pirate ship. 

Combat is too simple. It's just a matter of what gear you have. You'll either outclick them to death or not. There's no challenge other than are you geared enough for the enemy. And it seems every action is too simple, except shooting stuff with a bow & arrow. You'll want to upgrade that or face having to hit deer multiple times.

I don't know. It's not a bad game. It's definitely a relaxing game .... except when you need an item like plant fiber that will take forever to get enough of. I haven't even mentioned the graphics. Well, you can see the store page and yes, the game is that ugly.

But it still leaves a lot to be desired.


There is no caves, dungeons, temples with large epic chambers full of dragons to slay, nor huge kraken rising up from the seas, no epic loot to chase... the world is pretty lifeless with not a whole lot to do, you'll probably be bored in just a few days of playing. Why do all the living at sea games have this problem?


Why the dev worked so hard to make the games foundation, a crafting system, and then hardly use it, is beyond me. There isn't very many recipies, bad guy types, or even quests. The quests you get are always the same thing. Go to this island nearby and kill the bandits, bring something from the loot back... rinse and repeat. The bad guys are always in clumps of 2 or 3, spread out over the island. 


It woulda been such a better game if it was focused on living on just a few islands, growing crops, building structures on land, protecting it from pirates once in a while, diving into caves, who knows...  Apparently the dev is still going to add more to this game, hopefully it will get some exciting content, until such a time my review stands for what it is now currently.



Conclusion?
Salt- sodium chloride... So tasty! and is one of the most intersting molecules with so many uses. If only the game SALT could have the same said for it. 
It's good, but it's short. Endless miles of water, but only 2 paws deep.

MAP
the map is a weird one when you first start the game the map is empty and you have to fill it out p√• placeing the islands on the map. that was a weird one for me as dident know how to use it untill i googled it. but when you get the hang of it is amazing and you can really feel your inner pirat channelling.

BOAT
you start with the raft wich is a platform with a sail and a stick. the raft sails nicely but it is hard to know the precise way the boat is sailing.

COMBAT
combat is okay. the game has a simple combat system that is made harder by the animations being shit on the enemies when you walk and fight at the same time.

BEST MOMENT
when i was sailing from the jungel island back to the merchant it was in the dead of night i could not se anything besides my tourchs light. i was on the old pirat ship at the time and i stood in the front of the ship to make sure i wasent hitting anything. when suddenly i saw sand. and i ran like the wind to the helm wich i turned like a mad man to the side and doged a massiv island. and at that moment i said to myself. in wich other game does this happen? it just doest happen in other games. only in salt do you get those momnets where you sail in the dead of night. or have to slay 44 pirats at an island for a chest filled with loot

PROS
-the game looks elegant yet simple
-there is allways new stuff to find and new threats
-the ships sails very nicely
-the navigation is awesom and i feel like a real sailor when i finde my way using the map.

 CONS
 
-there is not enough plants on the islands i am talking about the flowers.
-the animations on enemies are to simple.
-the pathfinder for the enemies are terrible (so its almost imposseble to hit them when they are running at you)
-when you get the option to craft a weapon you cant see the stats, so you dont know if its worth it.
-on the jungel island the pochers can trow their spears through the ground so you can¬¥t hide behind hills.
-i have like 13 of the same book. :-/
-i dont allways know where to find stuff.

So at first glance this game looks like a cartoon style pirate exploration game! If im wrong then please tell me, but I do love these types of games and when i first saw it im like I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT!!!!! Like spongebob didnt when he didn't need water in sandy's tree dome! The game its self is very great despite all the negative reviews and comments on it! Your a pirate exploring the seas after you crash! (i think you crash thats why you walk up on a island with a dead pirate and some wierd dude!) For a game with mostly negative reviews this game is a diamond in the rough! All tho there are somethings that could be improved! 

Such as! 
1. sometimes in the pause menu your boat sinks to the bottem of the sea!
2. the deers look like laggy hackers when they run (atleast for me)
3. all tho islands are not actually close i have found it beocming extremly long to get to island to island! 
4. the deers get stuck on some things like the raft, rocks, trees, etc. 
5. I would park the raft a good 10 feet away from the island and then i would return to it being beached in the same place! (As if there are tide shifts and it lowers the water level(by alot))
6. This is just mainly a suggestion but i think there should be more people on islands like atleast some random dudes on every island that just sit next to a campfire or somthing!
7. there should be more animals you can hunt, likes pigs, bears, etc.
8. there should be animals that try to kill you like a bear!

Some things i like about this game!
1. It has a cartoony feel!
2. Your a pirate whats not to enjoy!
you start with a small raft and can make better ships.
3. every building is almost suspend in air on logs stilts!

This is a fun game to just pass the time in and enjoy! you can go teasure hunting! You can go hunt deer! whats not to love!

The atmosphere, visuals, the sun reflecting perfectly off water, the way the boats sway and make sounds, the ambient sounds of different island types, and the AMAZING music all come together to form Salt. There is so much freedom as to how you approach this game, kiting enemies with a bow, getting heaps of move speed or armour or health etc. is amazing. Most enemies have different attack speeds and animation speeds to make dodging attacks interesting and not as repeatitive. there is a lot of depth to this game.

However, some things are not worth it, such as any cobalt weapon or armour. For the most rare ore in the game it offers nothing over items you can find on enemies or buy. One of the best weapons in the game (aside from tiger spirit spears) is the blade of duality, which can be found in Tier 2 pirate island chests, which are fairly easy to clear out at an early point in the game. Kinda ruins part of the experience to be able to have access to an end game item that early.

At the start, it really does not look like there is much to this game, but once you get farther in, you can see there is a lot to it. The part I like the least about this game is you spend at least HALF of your game time sailing from one location to another. Possibly more than half. It takes forever to get from one place to another. You can get equipment to make the trips faster, but it still takes a long time. I am talking anywhere between 5 minutes to 30 minutes of just sailing from one location to another depending on your destination. During that trip, there are no other ships or pirates or anything. Just random islands and open ocean. 

Then there are the legendary weapons like Sword of the Sun and Old Sword I think it was called. You have to kill boss type enemies with these weak weapons to get ""Legendary"" weapons that are not that much better, if at all, than Epic weapons. The best weapon I ended up getting was an Epic weapon called Spear of Tiger Spirit because it acted as a weapon with good damage and you could shoot it ranged with no need for ammo. The ranged part was very innacurate though. 

The variety of boats is actually pretty good. I got the raft, the sail boat, the old pirate ship, The White Narwhal and finally The Royal Madien, in that order. Each felt a true upgrade to the next and nicely designed. 

I enjoyed half of the time I spent in this game. Especially on the tier 3 pirate islands, but after a while you see how tedious it is to get the best items in the game, which is why I did not finish the game. You will find some fun here, but the mynute gains in armor and weapons just does not make it worth going after their ""Legendary"" weapons/armor.

In summary, there is fun to be had here, but a lot of tasks are tedious becuase of the distance and Legendary weapons/armor just don't seem that ""Legendary"" or even worth the time to bother with.",1532291779,1532291779,True,12,0,0.616693675518035889,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However it had great potential and the devs pulled off something unique.
Salt is a very chilled game with a lot to explore and quite a bit to do as well. It's difficulty level depends on how you play it. Some islands are very hostile and you need very good gear in order to survive. But you do not have to visit them if you so wish. 
I play Salt to relax. Sail the seas with my ship, park in the middle of the ocean, take out my fishing rod and watch the sunset as I catch the occasional fish. 
When I feel more adventurous I will find an island with pirates and clear it. A chest with goodies waits for me as a reward. 
Eventually I get burned out and leave Salt for a few weeks. But I keep on coming back to enjoy the beautiful atmosphere the game provides.",1530519925,1530519925,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hi, Unfortunately this game turned out to be boring, even within the few minutes I was in, when I started, it looked promising, and, the concept is good, the ideas are good, it's just that, it feels dead, dull and overall boring, I can't really point my finger on what is that make this happen, but well, unfortunately I can't recommend it.
Welp, let's go through the procedure.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*] Good performance
[*] Multiplayer
[*] Graphics Settings (Believe me, this is important, so many games doesn't add those and become unplayable for lots of people)
[*] Extensive Help information about almost everything you need to know.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*] Poor Animation.
[*] No option to change keybindings.
[*] Unimmersive. (this is not even a real word)
[*] Raft and boats are awful to control.
[*] Knowing what you can and can't do is hard. (Like expecting an axe to cut a tree, but then it doesn't)
[*] Mostly dead environment apart from the default animals of that island or pirates (if there is any).
[/list]

Like I said, it's hard to point my finger on what causes it to be boring, and it seems to have everything to work, but it doesn't.
Instead it makes you feel sleepy, looking for things you aren't sure about, trying things that are supposed to work but then doesn't, and then you find the tool/weapon's real purpose later, or maybe you never do.
Navigating is awful, not just by how the raft controls, but by the emptiness present in the meantime, for you then to arrive and find nothing of interest in the other island.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It's a survival + exploration game, although surviving is kinds hard, as you need to hit a tree in order for it to drop something, sometimes, or hunt some animals (which seems to be going in extinction), or find any by chance, etc.
Your body feels soulless, as you are what you hold (A flying tool), fighting is hit & Block, boring, but you can try a power hit, or to move away, not worth it...
Most of the terrain doesn't seem to be interact-able , wood you need to find on the ground, as tress can't be cut-down, or I didn't find some sort of special tool that isn't a normal axe...
Controlling the raft is awful, I get that they tried to go for a more realistic approach, but it's just awful and troublesome, after a while you get the course you wanna follow, but setting it straight is the hardest thing ever...
There are quests to do, but they are just as boring unfortunately, they don't add much to the game apart from some objective.
The UI is bad, as you can't move stuff around, and I hate having lots of panels on my right, as it makes me have to move my head and deviate my attention.

Well, I have lots of more things to say, but since letter limit is a thing, i'll keep it short.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Bad | 3/10
It had everything to work, but doesn't, unfortunately.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Nothing much to complain, they're fine, apart from some weird shadows sometimes, the characters are meh, nothing special, the graphics aren't the main issue with the game, having better ones wouldn't change a thing. 

[b]Graphics:[/b] Average | 5/10
I said they're fine, not good.

[h1]Sounds[/h1]
Something that has worked, I like some of the sounds, even thou some seems weird, and the song is nice, for the sound I don't have much to complain.

[b]Sound:[/b] Good | 7/10

[h1]Controls[/h1]
The controls are responsive, somewhat fine, but the ways to open the inventory and some tabs are annoying, it also ahs the lack of key bindings options.

[b]Controls:[/b] Good | 7/10
Works, but could have been way better, the shortcuts are not that good also.

--------------------------

So, even thou the game is fine in other categories, just the gameplay itself kills it for me, apart from feeling empty, it feels like no effort was put into trying to make this into something fun, but rather just to finish it.
I'm normally very forging with games, but this one doesn't deliver any sort of fun or entertainment to be worth buy.
I would gladly update this review if the game gets updates and becomes better, but for the time being, I can't recommend it, sorry.

PS: I keep the game installed on my PC for some months, so if there is a big update, expect this Review to be updated!

The graphics are simple, so if you want something to make your graphics card scream with effort this isn't it. But it's clean, bright, and inviting. Every day looks fresh and new and filled with adventure, just from the sunlight.

There isn't a huge amount of story. It's a sailing/resource gathering/island exploration sandbox with a few quests to point you to new places. You kill pirates and take their stuff. Why? Because.

The combat can be frustrating at times and while there is excellent gear out there, it can take a lot of grinding to get.

The world generation is decent but not stellar. There are some good guides written for the default world seed, but if you use a custom seed it cane take a while to find specific things. Which may be good or bad, depending on what you like to do in a sandbox game.

The sailing, though... the sailing is brilliant. Do you ever have the need to just jump in a ship and sail across the vast ocean, riding the waves, wind in your hair, searching for the horizon? This game scratches that itch in all the right ways. It takes a little while to get your first big ship, but once you have it, you're standing on the bowsprit feeling the spray and smelling the salt air as your ship dances joyfully over the rolling waves. You shrug off quests and resource grinding for the sheer joy of sailing into the never-ending horizon. You are free.

So do I recommend Salt? Well, as a survival/adventure sandbox it's kinda meh. But as an excuse to sail... it's beautifully addicting.",1529513793,1529513793,True,30,2,0.734579563140869141,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I bought this game some years ago, appealed by is rather unique atmosphere, perfectly conscious at the time that it was an unfinished alpha game.
Since the premises I really lookedm forward to see what the development could have brought to a game with a loooot of potencial... unfortunately that day has never come, the game left early access without actually been completed, like many others EA games with bad and irresponsible devs.
This is a huge sandbox, but there's nothing to do in it, the world is empty, just few pirates or npc, no towns, nothing that makes a huge world like this alive.... quests are terrible too and in general there's no sense of reward in doing anything, and the game in general feel unfinished (as it actually is).

I'm really disappointed by this game, I really suggest you to not play it and look for something better.",1527519009,1529261090,False,62,3,0.804872810840606689,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]PROS[/b]: Beautiful - it really is beautiful, loads to do, manageable learning curve, more exploring than fighting. Not too much of a scramble to find resources, really great landscape generation, feels pretty balanced overall - good adventuring. Disco deer. The Treasure Grabber guy's dialogue.

[b]CONS[/b]: Inventory management is awkward and fiddly, the large ships are offputtingly hard to sail, balance of items available and craftable seems a bit thin/unbalanced in places, occasionally islands don't load till you're already inside them. Fighting feels a bit flaily - couldn't always hit the pirate I was literally standing right in front of, but no idea why.

Some finer points of consideration:

- Sometimes islands take a while to load in, or only the island loads, and the trees, rocks, angry pirates, and shrubbery only load once you're already skipping merrily across the landscape. It's bad when you find yourself suddenly surrounded by angry pirates but it's even more bad when you find yourself trying to run away through an awful lot of trees that weren't there a second ago.

- Hunting is a lot more fun when a glitch makes every startled deer do a spectacular and extremely fast kind of flipping-back-and-forth dance as it runs away from you. However, this makes their tracks impossible to follow. But on balance, I'd still rather have un-trackable disco deer happening to me than the normal boring kind, so this is fine.

- I was REALLY excited when I stumbled across the existance of [spoiler] black deer [/spoiler] for the first time. And then I was kind of disappointed that there isn't really anything very special to be done with their skins. This is a common theme, it turns out. You find something really cool and there's a decent challenge in hunting/acquiring it, but discover that it's not really worth much and there's nothing really cool you can do with it. I got the feeling at times that the devs are perhaps struggling to keep up with their own fabulously creative output. ""We've invented these amazing items! But now we have to invent something just as amazing to use them for too...""

- This game provided me with [b]THE[/b] most satisfying gaming experience of maybe the last two years, it truly did, simply becuase climbing to the very top of one of the mountains really is a proper and considerably difficult challenge. Everything is procedurally generated, so there is no guarantee that you will actually be able to summit any given mountin. Doing so was IMMENSELY satisfying. My dumpy little bloke stood there at the top in his extremely silly hat, smeared in sticky fish juice, and veritably radiated pride. And then I fell off a mountain. Again. But I was still so pleased that I didn't mind.

- The landscape really is excellent; varied enough to be exciting without being confusing, really nice, natural-feeling island generation that seems to work very nicely. Other than when you're sitting in a spot in the sea where you KNOW there should be an island... only to have it load in with you floating calmly far beneath its surface, looking up through the trees and the grass. That's not really a massive problem though, until you - being a pragmatic sailor - decided that you should probably sail out from inside the island. Have you ever seen a whole galleon clip through a beach and then be launched fifteen feet in the air? If not, you're in for a treat.

- Speaking of which, I spent ages working my way up to getting one of the bigger ships and I was [b]SO EXCITED[/b] to start sailing around in it and filling it joyously with crap... until I discovered that you cannot both 
A) see where you're going and 
B) steer one of the infernal things at the same time. You also can't easily raise/lower the sails while standing at the wheel, which, when combined with the visibility problems, make ""stopping becuase an previously un-loaded island is suddenly happening to you"" quite difficult.

- The game has a brillinatly expansive feel yet manages to avoid feeling either bleak or too crowded, which is impressive. the gradual change to much bigger waves out in the deep ocean areas was pretty cool. I gather there is going to be something happening with features under the water, at present it's just blurry and blue. Which I prefer to blurry and full of shark. But still.

- The fishing mechanic isn't annoying! I LOVE it when the fishing mechanic isn't annoying!

- I had forgotten how much I love having an unlimited inventory! And then I realised I had forgotten how much I hate having an unlimited inventory! Because I selfishly want to be able to both carry absolutely everything I see and also find specific items again at some point in the near future. Efforts have been made in Salt to try and facilitate that, but they were no match for my hoarding prowess and I spent a lot of time scrabbling around looking for that one particular non-descript pair of boots etc. etc.

The game is pretty damned good for something that is still in development, but there are still places that feel a bit thin and underdeveloped. I believe this is, in part at least, because there is SO MUCH STUFF in the game already, it's so rich with features, creatures and loot that it struggles to live up to itself in some places. 

Ultimately I burned out on it a bit when I'd gotten past the disappointment of not really being able to sail around happily in my great big boat, and also realised that there wasn't really anything super-cool left that I badly wanted to be working towards. I made heavy use of the wiki - becuase otherwise I really would have just sailed around for hours running my boat into things by day and getting eaten by things in the dark by night as I gibbered and clicked wildly at the scenery.

Thank you for your feedback. I wanted to clear up a couple things that might improve your experience. You can craft a pickaxe actually! It's 1 hardstone ore and a wood log. Also, the reason we didn't allow the player to cut down trees is to encourage exploration. Some islands have almost a thousand trees on them and we knew it wouldn't be a fun experience staying on one island and cutting down trees. And since Salt is primarily about exploration rather than survival, we wanted to focus on that element if that makes sense!

Unfortunately, it is not fun enough for me.

Procedurally generated world of sail ship and exploration adventure, with melee combat and customizable ship sounded like a dream come true to me.

However, I can not like the game enough due to the following reasons:

1.The world is really too empty. 
There's no one at sea to be seen.
There's no settlements or town. Friendly NPC are almost always alone.
There is too little things to do/explore on each Island. Most of the activities in game comprised of either you killing pirates to unlock chest or hunt to reduce your hunger.
This sounded fun at first but it sucks after few hours.

2.It's very grindy survival game.
 
It's a survival game where you have hunger bar. And since hunger bar reduce really quickly, you almost always have to find animals or pirates to kill so you can eat off their corpses. 
A game that force you to grind is boring.

Additionally, it isn't easy to kill animals either. At least earlier in the game when you have no fishing rod or ranged weapons. You have to stalk them and stab them then repeat the whole thing for about 4 times.

I get it, videogame is a way to waste time, but when I brought this game I expect to get my time wasted by sailing in big ship and exploring procedurally generated world, 
not wasting my time climbing mountains and stalking deer.

3.No character progression.

Sometimes you have to kill just 3 pirates, but sometimes, you have to take on 10 pirates all by yourself. But guess what ? Even if you do that you won't get any stronger. The only thing you'll get off them are few coins and some same gears.
It's disspointing when you have to go through all the hassle of luring and stealth killing a numerous amount of enemies and yet you're still the same old dude who's just as strong as one or two pirates.

4.Single player ship control sucks.

It's an absutely great thing that you can walk around and explore your own ship entirely. Even famous sailing games like Assassin's Creed, Uncharted Waters Online, etc. doesn't allows you that much freedom.

And unlike in games like Sea of Thives or Black Wake, it's actually possible to sail the ship by yourself. But guess what ? It sucks. You have to manally control the ship wheel, or sail, or cannon. 
This isn't a problem in smaller boat where the steering control and sails are very near eachother. 

But imagine only you yourself do something like that on a god damn galleon.

5.You have to make your own map, and you don't even know where you currently are without using a tool from your inventory.

Some people might like this, but not me.

Automap with fog of war system would be better.",1524904299,1524905737,False,21,1,0.687509834766387939,0,True,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: Empty procedurally generated game with a few seeded activities. Deerhunt island. Pirate Hunt Island. Most of them mostly barren with one random NPC on it.

There are, I presume two ways of going about playing this .The one method that involves using craft material to climb up the tech ladder seems to not really be viable. You always do need to find a lootstash or lootbox to find some of the core components and tools. For example, I do not believe it possible to make a pickaxe as no stones are lying around.

Pirates just charge forward and clip into each other as they clumsily swing and you clumsily swing back. It is a simple hit and get hit affair with a largely useless block function as you still take damage while blocking and aggroing more than one pirate means they deathball togeher making blocking really hard to time or use at all.

Activities in islands sometimes involve clearing a few deers, killing a few pirates etc, at which point a reward unlocks. This to me sounds the more viable option as the rewards are often in gold which allows you to buy things from merchants that you would have trouble getting on your own.

The thing is the raft you use to get between islands is a tad annoying to use, in addition, I beached the raft and no matter how much I tried I could not push it back into water despite pressing the appropriate keys and being very patient about it.

That left me swimming from island to island which was not satisfying or effective.

I found a pirate map, and a compass, I assume I would have needed a sextant and other things to actually be able to track my position and triangulate where to go. Which would possibly add some kind of a geocaching element to the game albeit an uncommon, and rather rare one.

When you take into consideration that hunting involves hitting a deer with an arrow upwards of 4 or 5 times and chasing them around all over. That fruit trees are not a very common source of food, and that getting trapped at night without a campfire or torch means that you are stuck waiting for the night to cycle away, staring at a pitch black screen that makes any gameplay impossible it makes you wonder if the few survival elements that were included were really thought out all that well.

Conclusion: Even if a lot of things were added in, I do not think that the core elements of gameplay are fluid enough, the crafting is clunky, survival is badly handled, combat is a clunky clusterflock and I found the setting somewhat bland and not very piratey after all. For that reason, it would not be a recommendable title even if it was brimming with content. But as things stand now I would strongly advise to steer clear. This is a walking simulator mroe than anything else. It would be best for me to remove it to the library of hidden titles and remove local content permanently as this is no longer in Early Access and it is safe to assume that gameplay will not fundamentally change.",1524346975,1524346975,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And they were right, it is.

As a fledgling pirate, you wake up on an island with the gear to make a raft and little else. From there on out, it's really up to you what you do. There is a quest line and side quests given to you by various NPCs but, if you simply want to go island hopping (make your own map!), or fishing (catch rare fish!), or take on bands of pirates with your sword or bow (die after being overwhelmed when your gung-ho approach fails spectacularly!), you can.

The graphics are, I would say, functional compared with, say, Sea of Thieves (which I only mention as something vaguely comparable gameplay-wise), but they have a charm all of their own. And besides which, it's gameplay that really counts and if you like the idea of a first person pirating game with light survival mechanics, this may be for you (give the demo a go!).

I should say that I've only played singleplayer and there is a multiplayer option which I've no doubt is fun; playing with a friend/friends usually is after all. Once again, if you're not sure, try the demo.",1523532841,1523532841,True,5,2,0.532866835594177246,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's atmosphere was great, super peaceful with plenty of pretty sights, and enough content to get you hooked before running into some flaws. I loved the exploration aspect of it, it was fun making use of your sextant to plot out islands on your map.

     However, now we get to my major gripe with the game: The combat, I cannot stress enough that the combat in this game is a complete and total pile of trash, it's like they looked into EA's chamber pot of fecal combat systems, took a butter knife, scraped out the very bottom of the pot, slapped a shiny 'dodge!' and 'parry!' sticker on it and prayed no-one would notice that it was just a month old turd. The whole thing detracts greatly from enjoying the exploration of the game. 

    The combat itself basically ends up boiling down to: if your weapon has higher numbers than their weapon, and you have armor with high numbers, and have enough health potions, then you win! No skill, just numbers. 

    It appears they tried to make it skill based adding a 'dodge' mechanic and a 'block' and 'parry' mechanic, but the are so pin-point precise that they end up relying on luck. The enemy attacks have no indication of when they will hit you and they home in on you like guided missile, if you dodge too soon during their attack, they'll just turn on a dime and hit you in mid-air. Blocking only lessens the damage you take, and you just barely have enough time to get a single attack in, making doing damage more worth while.  

    Parrying theoretically will momentarily stun them, giving you a large opening for attack. But after experimenting on a weak enemy for about 30 minutes, I could not find when the right time to parry is, and concluded that it is completely random, with me only getting lucky twice in a ocean of failures.  

but after moaning an whining about the combat for hours I thought ""Well hey, the games in early access and they're a small team, they'll fix it eventually right?""...

Yeah, and then it left early access, the devs essentially said ""we hope none of you actually thought we where going to finish making our game, because we're only going to to minor updates bug fixes from now on. [b] cough [/b] if you're lucky [b] cough [/b].‚Äù

    And I didn't even say anything about the lack of stuff to do out at actual sea, sure there's treasures you can find, but that just about as fun as removing each and every one of you nose hairs while hanging upside-down from slowly rotating ceiling fan.

    Your ship is more of a glorified storage locker on which you are completely out of danger, nothing can happen to you when you are on your ship, there is no threat, you can't beach your ship or sink it, there are no enemy pirates or sharks or anything that would pose the least amount of threat to you while your at sea.. nothing!

    But I wanted to say that I did have a lot of fun just exploring islands, finding new quests and items. I kinda just ended up relaxing entered a trance of exploration that sucked up my time before being pimp-slapped out of it by it's ugly and jarring combat system. Then only to find out that the devs abandoned the game with it's many flaws and bugs.

         So, my final verdict is this: If it's on sale, consider picking it up, but you will probably regret buying this at full price.",1522732976,1522732976,False,34,7,0.713050663471221924,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay mainly conists of sailing between islands to collect sticks and rocks. Occasionally taking a fetch quest . Clicking on pirates until they die and some fishing. 

The fishing is a good example of what Salt is missing. The fishing gameplay is similar to Minecraft except without the polish. For a nautically themed game that costs this much I'd expect something similar to Stardew Valley at least.

[b]Kurzbeschreibung[/b]

Salt ist ein Survival-Abenteuer-Spiel, bei dem der Spieler Pirat bzw. Abenteurer ist. Es gibt ein Hauptquestlinie und verschiedene Nebenquestlinien, die man erf√ºllen kann. Das kann man entweder gezielt tun oder wie das typisch f√ºr OpenWorld-Spiele ist, einfach nebenbei. Die Questgeber trifft man dabei immer wieder und auch die Orte f√ºr Quests wiederholen sich. Es gibt dabei im Laufe des Spiels einen sp√ºhrbaren Fortschritt, der sich daran bemerkbar macht, dass sowohl die eigene Ausr√ºstung, als auch die Gegner schwerer werden. Auch bei Nebent√§tigkeiten wie Angeln oder Jagen macht man mit der Zeit durch Ausr√ºstung Fortschritte und es geht einfacher. Bei mir macht sich das vor allem beim Jagen deutlich bemerkbar - wo am Anfang die Rehe noch weggerannt sind und ich sie dann anhand ihrer Spuren wiederfinden musste, kann ich ihnen heute mit der passenden Ausr√ºstung hinterherlaufen und sogar mit dem Messer anstatt dem Bogen erlegen. Diese Ausr√ºstung ist dabei nur f√ºr diese T√§tigkeiten wirklich gut geeignet, f√ºr Kampf benutze ich eine andere Ausr√ºstung, die ich aber mit einem Klick und dank endlosem Inventar leicht wechseln kann.

[b]Was ist gut?[/b]
[list]
[*]Multiplayer I - dieses Spiel l√§sst sich einfach im MP spielen und Freunde k√∂nnen jederzeit hinzukommen und wieder gehen auch wenn sie vielleicht einen anderen Fortschritt in Sachen Quests und Ausr√ºstung haben
[*]Open World - die Welt ist wirklich gro√ü und man wird wohl nie alles erforschen aber es macht echt viel Spa√ü von Insel zu Insel  zu segeln, zu Navigieren und zu Kartographieren (ja ihr m√ºsst eure leere Karte selbst f√ºllen und bekommt daf√ºr im Laufe des Spiels auch bessere Gegenst√§nde und Funktionen hinzu)
[*]Grafik - die ist, auch wenn recht einfach, durch die Beleuchtung doch ziemlich sch√∂n
[*]Atmosph√§re - haben die Entwickler wirklich sehr gut eingefangen, man f√ºhlt sich wirklich als Abenteurer, der durch die Meere reist - durch B√ºcher und Quests wird die Welt auch ausreichend lebendig und erh√§lt mehr Tiefe
[*]Multiplayer II - Sehr sch√∂n ist auch, dass es im MP um die Ressourcen keine Konkurrenz gibt (jeder bekommt z.B. das Holz und gleichzeitig ist Loot von z.B. toten Piraten zuf√§llig, wodurch es eben doch Unterschiede zwischen den Spielern gibt) - Au√üerdem ist es gut, dass man die Map mit gleichem Seed einfach weiter im Singleplayer spielen kann, so kann ein Mitspieler zum Beispiel einfach schon mal weiterreisen und an besonderen Orten dann auf die anderen warten und sie einladen (der Spieler muss dabei noch nichtmal der Host sein)
[/list]

[b]Was neutral zu werten?[/b]
[list]
[*]Das Spiel ist nur in Englisch verf√ºgbar, aber die Texte sind leicht zu verstehen
[*]Crafting - zweckm√§√üig auch wenn es irgendwie sehr schade ist, dass man Ressourcen wie Bambus oder Holz nur finden und nicht richtig abbauen kann - bei Bambus m√ºsst ihr auf die dunkelgr√ºnen Bambusst√§be achten, die zwischen den normalen Dekost√§ben sind!
[*]Schiffe/Basen - Basen auf Inseln k√∂nnt ihr nicht bauen, macht auch keinen Sinn, aber eure Schiffe dienen als Basen, allerdings braucht ihr nicht unbedingt ein gro√ües Schiff mit Kisten, Kanonen etc. euer Inventar ist endlos und Kisten auf einem Schiff braucht man nur um √ºberfl√ºssigen Loot oder Dinge, die ihr grad nicht braucht zu lagern, damit euer Inventar wieder √ºbersichtlich ist - im Endeffekt ist ein gro√ües Schiff einfach nur ein Statussymbol - praktisch werdet ihr meist mit dem kleinen Segler fahren
[*]Musik - ist OK
[*]Grinding - eigentlich typisch f√ºr diese Spiele und am Anfang eher unsch√∂n, sp√§ter l√§uft es aber einfach nebenbei und geht gef√ºhlt auch wesentlich schneller
[*]Kampfsystem - ist OK, Blocken und Ausweichen ist manchmal sinnvoll, im MP reicht aber einfach draufhauen
[*]alle NPCs sind nur auf Inseln zu finden, nicht auf Schiffen und andere Schiffe liegen immer vor Anker, der Ozean wirkt dadurch extrem leer. Es w√§re nett wenn wenigstens hin und wieder ein Schiff mit Piraten zu sehen w√§re, muss ja nicht fahren aber irgendwo auf dem Ozean mal ein anderes Schiff w√§re nett gewesen.
[/list]




[b]Was ist eher negativ zu werten?[/b]
[list]
[*]Das Spiel wirkt unfertig und h√§tte noch ein wenig Entwicklung vertragen (Quality of Life-Improvements wie bessere Sortierung im Inventar oder Cheat-Konsole falls mal ein Bug dein Savegame zers√∂rt w√§ren sch√∂n, au√üerdem gibt es wohl Inhalte, die noch nicht wirklich funktionieren oder zumindest nicht zu Ende entwickelt wurden)
[*]Es gibt hin und wieder [b]Bugs[/b] die dein Spiel zum Absturz bringen und wir hatten auch bereits einen Bug, bei dem das komplette Inventar verloren ging, h√§tten wir nicht meins r√ºberkopieren k√∂nnen, dann w√§re das sehr sehr frustrierend geworden.
[*]Ebenso schade sind Bugs bei Booten, wir hatten einen, wo wir richtig weit weg geschleudert wurden, weil die Boote mit den Spielern gebuggt haben - seitdem fahren wir nur noch einzeln und es w√§re wirklich sch√∂n zusammen auf einem gro√üen Schiff zu fahren - das w√ºrde definitv mehr Spielspa√ü bringen.
[/list]



[b]Fazit[/b]
Salt ist ein sch√∂nes, atmosph√§risches Survival-Abenteuer-Spiel und wenn ihr es mit Freunden spielen wollt, dann w√ºrde ich es unbedingt empfehlen, wenn euch das Setting anspricht. Durch die Bugs und teilweise fehlenden oder unfertig wirkenden Inhalte w√ºrde ich nicht viel mehr als 10‚Ç¨ daf√ºr ausgeben. Wir haben fast 50h in Salt und immernoch Spa√ü. Die Kritik in einigen Reviews hier ist berechtigt, es wirkt teilweise wirklich als w√§re es zu fr√ºh aus dem EA rausgekommen, allerdings sind die postiven Bewertungen von vor dem Release eben nicht ohne Grund da. Die aktuelle Welle der Kritik kommt √ºberwiegend von Spielern die vom vielleicht zu fr√ºhen Release entt√§uscht sind. Wer Salt aber noch gar nicht kennt kann nicht derart entt√§uscht werden. So geht es mir und darum empfehle ich es auch.

[h1]Verdict :[/h1]
[b][i]If nautical nonsense is something you wish, then buy Salt; Recommended Purchase[/i][/b]

[h1]Crawling From the Deep[/h1]

There‚Äôs plenty of open-world survival games out there on the market, but not too many of them actually manage to slither from the absolute hellhole that is Steam Early Access. Salt miraculously did just that, and I think as such it‚Äôs definitely worthy of a look at the very least. It‚Äôs a game about naval exploration back in the time of pirates and swashbuckling adventures, and as such has a massive focus on naval exploration. Coincidentally that‚Äôs also my favorite part of the game, all the nautical nonsense that can be done with little more than a raft and copious amounts of ambition. Before I decide to nosedive into the game as a whole, I‚Äôd like to address some of the obvious problems that may turn potential buyers away at the doors. The biggest of these is the graphics, and more specifically, the player models themselves. Now, I didn‚Äôt experience this to as bad a degree considering I played alone and as such didn‚Äôt really interact with too many other people, but it‚Äôs clearly a problem. It‚Äôs definitely a sad state of things when I can best compare your models to those present in Roblox, and there seems to have been absolutely zero work put into them at all. It‚Äôs extremely disorienting, going from island to island in your swashbuckling escapades, killing wildlife and exploring jungles, only to be interrupted at first sight of one of the aforementioned disfigured monstrosities. Not only did it take me out of the experience, it honestly just made me laugh, and that‚Äôs not really what you want your player to be feeling when they‚Äôre in the middle of combat or attempting to uncover story. On top of the hilariously horrendous player and NPC models, another issue is that of the combat. It‚Äôs not particularly good, however it also isn‚Äôt particularly bad in any way either. That‚Äôs the problem though, it just feels like it could have been more than it currently is. Like there was a pool of potential for these devs, but even over the course of a little over three years they still managed to ignore it. I have no real problems with how the combat is now, it‚Äôs definitely functional and, in some cases, a lot of fun. However in a game where I found myself fighting fairly often, it‚Äôs pathetic that the only real options for attacking are to hit them, and to hit them slightly harder. 

[h1]Cartography and Carnage[/h1]

Both the player models and the overly basic combat are minor complaints in an otherwise well-rounded adventure game. In the patch released when they pulled Salt out of early access they also added a main story, however I ignored it almost instantly and instead chose to head island to island in search of plunder. Just about every island has something for you to do, although it‚Äôs usually only that one thing. What I mean by this is that if you go to an island that has an objective for killing a bunch of pirates, that‚Äôs the only objective you‚Äôll have on the entire island. So although they‚Äôre all different objectives, there‚Äôs still only one per island. Regardless of how many objectives each island has, they all feel rewarding and incentivize you to take part in whatever that islands task might be. For an island holding a hunting challenge, I‚Äôd find a tall cabin decked out with some armor and weapons, all ready to be swiped once I killed the required amount of deer. I like that you actually have a reason to do these objectives, as all too often games put the objectives there for you to do, but don‚Äôt actually give you any real reason to do them. Something else I think that Salt does well is give a feeling of genuine realism without actually having too many realistic mechanics. I think the premise of the game itself, coupled with the extremely minimalistic way the game is made, makes for a weird experience where you don‚Äôt have too many particularly realistic mechanics, yet all the same you feel as if you‚Äôre actually there. It‚Äôs a difficult feeling to describe, but it‚Äôs what makes Salt able to pull you in with gameplay that‚Äôs really rather simple. Your time on these high seas is going to be spent either crafting, killing, or sailing, and that‚Äôs surprisingly enough to keep you occupied. However I haven‚Äôt gotten too far into Salt and I certainly haven‚Äôt even touched the main storyline, but as it stands now I feel that there‚Äôs enough content here to almost, in places, make the game feel like simulator rather than an arcade-y survival game.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Swashbuckling fun! Roaming the high seas and plundering a variety of islands is a blast, and Salt does a perfect job of making you feel immersed in the role of both an explorer and a pirate; the only problem is the all too average combat and horrendous player models.

All the negatives people are citing are true. The combat is super basic, the graphics are unique if simple and at times even ugly. You can and do get lost. Those things are true. Also true is that Salt is a work of ambition, beauty, genius and depth that few titles attempt.  It is a relaxing, open rogue-like first person sailing game. It is totally unique on every level. No part of this game (except the item menu) works exactly like any part of any other game. Even though that is true, it feels impressively intuitive. You may want to watch a short video about how to use a compass, (if you don't already know) but apart from that, the adventure will unfold for you the way good modern games should, no FAQs or tutorials neccessary. Once you've set sail the horizons gently tug you out into the open blue. 

My only real suggestions for improvements involve increased budget like adding content complexity (like insides for the huts in pirate villages) and things like that. I feel also that there could be a bit more to most of the NPC camps. I would change nothing about the general art direction but would appreciate a complete divorce from anime (the eyes look referential and that isn't appropriate) . I also feel that the texture art is misplaced alot of the time. But again, I'm sort of just complaing about budget there - which is unfair. 

All around one of the best ever. Amazing. 

If you're looking for violence, adrenaline or hard-core survival, give it a pass and save us the misplaced negative review.

You wake up on an island without knowing what happens, you walk by them until you meet a person in a campfire that has a corpse beside you, why not talk to him? Thanks to talking to the stranger, you repair a balza and go in search of a true adventure. Will you become the captain of a great ship with a huge reputation and that your enemies tremble with just hearing your name or will you just be another captain of a shabby ship that nobody respects? You choose.


[u][b]Positive Points[/b][/u]
‚Ä¢A large number of options to modify the game to your liking or your power, as well as in graphic aspects, sound or controls, among others.
‚Ä¢It has the possibility to choose between two game modes (normal and hardcore, one life) and how your world is going to be generated (a random seed, a personalized one and the predefined one).
‚Ä¢The control of the boats is simple and easy to master (the one of the first boat that we obtain is very original inclusively) so in a few hours you can become an expert sailor.
‚Ä¢Automatic saves every very short period of time, which greatly helps if we have a problem (such as a power outage).
‚Ä¢On more than one occasion, you will laugh out loud when completing the achievements and watch them leave.
‚Ä¢We can have different effects, positive and negative, by consuming some objects.
‚Ä¢A large number of objects that we will have to discover in the great open world that it has.
‚Ä¢During certain times of the day we will meet with low tide or high tide, it has happened to me a couple of times to leave my boat near the shore and to wake up having to push it to be able to unclog it.
‚Ä¢A very funny touch of the title is that when he dies he gives us an option that says: Rage Quit. Test it yourselves.
‚Ä¢The game does not have high requirements to play it, with a decent computer you can run it without problems.
‚Ä¢There are stories of pirates about their lives or their adventures, we can find them by killing some of them or looting their treasure chests.
‚Ä¢You can customize your boats the way you want and as much as you want, the only inconvenient is the space that you can get to occupy with them but nothing else.
‚Ä¢I have not found almost any bug that affects the gameplay itself, only some very small (Like the one that puts a pause on the boat that we started, when you return to the game it is as if submerged under the water and we hit a big jump towards above)
‚Ä¢At any time we can select our boat and put it in any position on the water (Yes, I found out about this after spending hours pushing the boat that had been stuck).
‚Ä¢Many will say: '' The game has bad graphics '' and this is false, because their graphics are based on the simplicity they have and what makes it so characteristic.
‚Ä¢Its developers listen to the feedback and update it every very little time.
‚Ä¢The price you have is very fair to what they are giving you so I do not think it means a problem when paying attention to the game.
‚Ä¢It is compatible with steam control and best of all is that it has a trial version which you can download to see what you are buying.
‚Ä¢We can get food in several different ways, from hunting wild animals to fishing.
‚Ä¢It has a normal learning curve so it will take you some time to understand things but it is like a chain reaction, once you understand you begin to understand everything that is related to it.

[u][b]Neutral Points[/b][/u]
‚Ä¢The controls are too simple, which for some may be beneficial, but for people who are looking for a big challenge, they will not get it in any way.
‚Ä¢It does not contain any type of tutorial on which we can base ourselves to understand the game, but there is a kind of ""book"" where it explains some basic things.
‚Ä¢The initial inventory, which we will find on the first island that appears, is always the same regardless of the seed we use (The amount of wood and rocks that we will find in the land may vary) but this has two points of view; The good, where thanks to it balances the beginning of all the players so that nobody finds a seed that is easier to others; and the bad one, where once you have played many times it becomes very repetitive and you want to have other objects, even if they are worse.
‚Ä¢When you kill all the pirates present on an island you will be marked in a treasure chest where you can find various valuables, the bad thing about this is that you have to kill if or if all the enemies, which It seems unrealistic because just having a ganzua or dragging it to your boat would be enough.
‚Ä¢The sound is something common but the music is very good, the problem is that the sounds predominate in quantity over the music so we can only enjoy certain moments.
‚Ä¢I have seen almost no visual effect except for that of the sun and that of some particular enemies, but that of the sun reflected in the water is magnificent.
‚Ä¢Its difficulty varies according to what we are talking about, for example: Obtaining objects, at the beginning, is very easy. The combat is extremely difficult.
‚Ä¢The collection and obtaining of resources is very different from what we have seen in other titles, for example, to obtain wood we will have to pick it up from the ground and we will not be able to cut it. The most normal thing is to have to break the stones to obtain their internal resources (stone, minerals) but this is also wrong due to one reason, the existence of the peak, this object does not make any difference to the rest of ways to break a stone.

[u][b]Negative Points[/b][/u]
‚Ä¢To begin with, the game only has one language despite the large user base it owns, so developers should focus more on that.
‚Ä¢HUD too simple, only white letters in a background, although I personally like the font they used.
‚Ä¢The way we discover the map or the way we can know where we have been is too complicated, it is based on a system that they wanted to make realistic but it is only annoying and that many people can not understand for many reasons, a totally unnecessary implementation of the game.
‚Ä¢The pirates attacked you without any apparent reason, this may be due to the fame they have had, but it would not be a bad idea to be able to talk to them and avoid in any way that they attack you (either bribing them or just talking). The opposite happens with the people with whom you can trade, why not be able to attack them or rob them?.
‚Ä¢The combat is horrible sincerely. All weapons are equal, only some of them perform more damage or others have less speed when hitting, and the fighting options we have with them are also. I summarize the fight: Paste, block waiting for the opponent to hit, hit, block again, hit, lock again ...
‚Ä¢The NPC run much faster than you so if in a combat you do not have stamina you have to give up for dead.
‚Ä¢Missions, both main and secondary, are typical and boring for the most part.
‚Ä¢The boats only have 2 states: Braked and in speed without variety.
‚Ä¢The design of the characters, both ourselves and the NPC, are very repetitive and very simple (Even when we put on our character's outfit is modified as seen), there are only some specific ones that look different.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]
I may not have put all the points I wanted in this analysis but with what I have I realize that it is a very good game that has great potential and is on its way to the star, but it falters in many points and its developers need be immediately aware of them. I recommend buying the game if you have the money. And most of all I recommend playing this game with friends because this title is made to be played with other people, if you try to go solo you will get bored after a few hours.

I got this game a long time ago and I got to say, I have been repeatedly dissapointed with the updates.

The combat is just this, hit mouse 1 to swing. Thats it. All the weapons do the same thing, and the bow moves at snail speed when strung. Its almost impossible to hit a deer while it is running. This is dissapointing cause of how many updates they have had since this game was made.

The UI doesnt help either, you push a button and i opens crafting. You can't really open your inventory from a keypad. E is the locked button to pick stuff up, and where it is on the keyboard it breaks the immersion. Thrying to look and grab something while traveling is annoying. I have to go into the crafting menue, then click on the inventory. In the middle of combat, to switch to a ""different"" weapon, you have to go through two menues and then clunkily move your sword to your character. 

Now lets talk about the quests. In the 50hours I played I never got to the main questline. That is because I could never find it. This is because it is completely random where you find the tavern to get the quest, and it is almost garenteed you will not find it for at least the first 6hours of playing the game. 

The ONLY saving grace is the exploration of this game, it is so much fun. Building your first ship and traveling around the different islands, you can completely randomize the islands so each one of them is fun. It is cool to happen by a island with three or four pirate camps on it. This is the enjoyable part of the game and what I liked the most. 

I would give this game a 5/10, at least the newer updates. The game is fun but if you don't like exploration do NOT buy this game.",1518973499,1518973499,False,6,1,0.539534866809844971,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I love this game for it's exploration, sights, and simplicity.

HOWEVER in it's current state, there are many many many MANY glaring problems with the game. One of which is the only use for cannons is to shoot from sea onto land, specifically killing ancient statues. Nothing else and for no other reason do you need cannons whatsoever.

The game emphasizes getting off the boat and checking islands which all look similar to each other spare a few, and combat which is not very complex and gets old fast. Also, I can't seem to hit those parrys every time, even with perfect timing.

I have a lot of gripes about this game, and saying it's a completed project at 20 bucks irritates me.

BUT If you can pick it up for 5 bucks or so, this is a good purchase for some laid back exploration.

As of today, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone. It's fun for me, but I know it's got less content than pretty much every other survival game out there to date.



Add some sea battles and I'll revisit this review.

If you're looking for a Sea of Thieves alternative or a pirate RPG, prepare to be underwhelmed. If you're looking for a quiet game about exploring, you've struck gold. 

Salt's best feature is it's naval exploration. The boats are lots of fun to learn how to steer properly, and I absolutely love the idea that you need to navigate and make your own map using just a compass and sextant. 

The island's aren't too varied and often only have 2-3 interesting things on them, but you often won't have to sail far to find another one. The quests are a bit simplistic (find this item and bring it back is the most common) but there is some depth to certain questlines, like the Innkeeper's. 

Don't expect much from the combat. Learning to block properly is what will give you an edge. Other than that, it's just hitting  your opponent. But as I said above, this is a game about exploring. Combat is simply one aspect of exploration.

I would encourage the development team to consider adding ship-to-ship combat, and pirate ships that roam the seas, as a potential DLC in the future. 

This game is great to play with a friend after a long day at work, if you need something to keep your attention but not overwhelm you.

Ok, crafting menu, there it is. Hey look, a book of crating, boat...boat...boat... raft, close enough. That is a lot of wood. Time to get swinging *hits tree for a few minutes* I can't harvest trees... hmm, *wanders around island* ah good there is wood on the ground, how much do I need again... oh, this is gonna take a lot of farming...

Luckily, things panned out for the better as there are broken ships that you can find at various islands (a broken raft at the first island) that take less materials to fix than the base crafting recipe, which I like. Different aspects of the game took some getting used to and getting a sextant is SO much more important than a compas as you have to make your own map, which I enjoy doing.

I feel like a privateer in this game, doing what I want, killing pirates and cultists, helping those that will pay me, and hunting down not only animals on the various islands but the sweet sweet loot that comes from everywhere. I am currently hooked on this game and can't wait to jump back in. 

What I like:
The ships
The sailing
The treasure/loot/booty
The derelect ships
The hunting
The combat (some don't like it, I've gotten used to it)
Make your own map

What I'd like to see improved:
More map markers
Ability to blend islands that are L shaped on map
Improved help tools (hover over stats to know how they benifit/hinder you)
Flag guide (something to tell you what npc flags mean, the fishing guild flag is confusing as to what it is)
Laddered buildings being safe from enemy attacks (but allowing humanoid enemies and bosses to get into them to attack you)

I fired it back up recently after the full release and have been pleasantly surprised at the additions to the game since I last played. Ship models especially are much much better than the early versions.

Overall, Salt is a fun little open-world sandbox game with lots of exploration, a bit of quest structure if you want it, a variety of weapons and armor in ascending tiers of rarity/power, and some interesting mechanics that evoke the feeling of exploring an unknown world and charting your own course on your adventures. It's a simple, pleasant, relaxing experience. 

It's *not* a detailed pirate simulator, a graphical powerhouse, or action-packed combat game. Melee fighting is fairly straightforward - you attack with quick or heavy strikes, you block or dodge, and that's that. Likewise, sailing is fun, direct, and lightweight - you point your ship in a direction, hoist your sails, and go. There's no wind direction, sail plans, leeway, doldrums, or other more complex elements to conducing a ship from point A to point B. It manages to be a charming experience in spite or perhaps because of these straightforward mechanics. 

There are some disappointments, of course - the absence of any kind of NPC activity on or in the ocean is probably the biggest letdown. (The world is populated with various NPCs with a variety of functions, but they're all landbound.) The performance isn't great and it doesn't feel optimized as well as it could be. The lighting can look surprisingly good for an indie game, but the contrast is often frustratingly stark - shadowed forest areas can be very dark even on a sunny day. 

But these issues and the relatively small scope of the game haven't stopped me from getting immersed for several hours at a time -- fighting pirate captains, completing rare gear sets, building new sailing ships, crafting new items, investigating weird cults, digging up ancient relics, and just sailing around the world to find new islands. 

If you go into this remembering what it is - a small-scale indie game created by three people in one of their first forays into game development - and you enjoy the basic premise of an exploring game, you'll probably enjoy Salt. I'd recommend picking i up on a sale as it's a bit light to merit the $20, but maybe that will change if Lavaboots continues to add content post-release.

(Also, just ignore the reviews claiming they've 'abandoned' the game or 'cashed out' or the the game is some sort of EA scam or whatever. Anyone who's been following Salt's development is aware that Lavaboots has pretty much done everything you want an indie dev to do with an Early Access game. They've been active, transparent, responsive, and honest about the game's progress at each step of the way. And - lo and behold - they *released a working game* at the end of the process. That's more than a lot of much bigger EA / Kickstarter projects can say.)",1518378070,1518378582,True,2,0,0.488273113965988159,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really like what they do because it is done well. I don't mind the simplified graphics but only if the game has depth. That is where it gets a little foggy for me.

As a pirate looking for 'adventure' I was more interested in pirating and there doesn't seem to be any of that in the game. So... this is more of an exploration game with pirate clothes. Sure you can find treasure, nav a boat/ship but you there isn't a crew to have, ships to plunder, nor towns or villages to pillage. 

Like I said, what they do is good, but it's what they don't do for pirating that marks this game as not recommended.  There could be so much more in a game like this, but there it's not there.

Don't get fooled by the video, it looks like there are pirates running on a ship and a few seconds later cannons are shot at another ship (and vice versa).

If yes, then it's even dumber, because you respawn and can instantly teleport to your ""friend/foe/othership whatever""... I just dont get it...)

When I noticed it was actually now OUT instead of EA I instantly grabbed it, and my first impressions are wow this game should return back to Davy Jones locker and back into EA. They had also added a price increase now it is ""finished""

Now the good.

So, I kinda like the art style
Seems like loads to explore
Looks pretty in parts

However 
Its buggy including terrible clipping issues
loads of graphically issues
The tutorial is just a bunch of stuff to read 
Terrible UI which is pretty confusing too
Sound is meh

This is just not even close to justifying the price tag, needs so much more polish its unreal

The sailing, fishing, and a handful of other minor features are nice, but remain underdeveloped. There was immense potential here, from ship combat to battling monsters at sea, a dueling system to reputation with pirate sects. None of that will come about, apparently.

All this is as of full release is a sailing simulator, and while that's somewhat decent (compass, sextant, other tools help make sailing feel involved, not to mention that you have to be your own cartographer), there isn't enough there to justify the price.

First, thank you for your feedback and taking the time to write out what you liked and didn't like about the game. I did want to let you know that we will be continuing support of the game even after the full release with bug fixes, balances, and other changes. Feedback like this is important in helping us understand what we did right and what we did wrong. 

I also wanted to assure you that we didn't release in order just to cash out or anything like that. We are a really small team (only 3 members) and we've been working on Salt for around 4 years. And while we loved the idea of content like ship combat, monsters in the sea, etc., we knew that would be a massive undertaking and we just didn't have the team size or resources to do it. I wish we did as I agree that type of content would be great! Instead we focused our efforts on quests, loot, exploration and discovery, and multiplayer and tried to add as much content in that regard as possible. 

We will be continuing to improve as much as we can and taking feedback like this into account in the future. 

Thanks again for taking the time to let us know your thoughts!"

Salt is a Nautical themed exploration game that's main charm lies in sailing the open sea, exploring items, and getting loot.

Good Sailing
Amazing Exploration

Terrible Combat
Poorly Optimized
Terrible graphics and models
Buggy
Terribly UI

My Suggestions:
FIX COMBAT
Clean up and simplify the UI

The lack of backstory for your character gives you so much space to improvise and be creative with your own legend. The massive open world game gives the player so many opportunities to explore for themselves and find all sorts of lore-based items. The boats, although glitchy at times, are an amazing segue from island to island. Personally, one of my favorite things to do is to while on a boat waiting for the next island to appear is to fish or to read one of the many, many books found around the game. The combat system, although very rudimentary, can be quite stimulating and the player can't help but feel rewarded with the game's looting system. Many of the items, while seemingly useless, have many secret parts to them that allow users to access opportunities along the way that wouldn't normally be an open door. The game works fantastically, and the content of the game gives off a vibe that makes the player feel accomplished. I seriously recommend the purchase of this game.

Edit: I also recommend that the player experiences everything on their own, meaning:

Problems are quiet are few and here are some :

1: Is that even with marking islands on the map it takes ages to do the quests.
2: Ships don't have cannons
3: No AI ships Q.Q Please put this in the game
4: Most loot is all the same from pirate islands
5: No sense of scaling - Some bosses and enemies go from very op to very weak. Often within an hours of game play. 
6: Even tho Multiplayer is available, its not as enjoyable as what I thought it would be.
7: You get to create huge ships however you can't share it with friends/allies (This includes chests)
8: No point teaming with someone as all the stuff can't be shared in the first place

All this is subject to change however THIS is still a fun little game to play with a friend or two. 
The art style is cute, reminds me of unturned. 
Gameplay is smooth however saving bugs the game
It is a huge game, just takes forever.

Try the demo, if its not for you then thats cool. I will keep playing this game all the way till it comes out.",1516092186,1523502640,True,18,2,0.650851607322692871,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Don't buy it. They barely did anything with it. I'm assuming since Sea of Thieves released which is a better (and way more expensive) game they just gave up.

Kind of saddened to be honest because I spent so many hours on here with my girlfriend. She and I loved this, but as like everyone else we soon found out it needed so much more and the developers were giving so much less. 


Needs a whole lot more, but it's fun.

Worth the price right now? Probably not, but in the future I expect it will be better. I recommend it for people who love to play passive gameplay with not very challenging combat. It's fun with friends as well. Just needs a whole lot more bug fixes & content added like character customization would be greatr or even building structures on islands where you can store your things and decorate as well.

This game has potential but as it stands it's a boring sailing simulator. I feel like I'm playing windwaker all over again.
I understand this game is more about the journey than the destination (or building, ect.) But when the journey is at least over 5 mins of me boringly dragging the steering a little to then left then a little to the right while I watch an island barley grow in the distance, it's just not fun.

As it stands I just can't recommend this game. Even as a relaxing leisure game. I was filling my time with other things while sailing and it was still just super boring. I will check back with this game in the future and maybe repurchase it then but I CANNOT recommend this game until they fix the boring long sailing - nothing happening sequences.

P.S. since so haven't played this game long some might say I didn't give it enough chance and maybe once you get a bigger ship or get to another area sailing won't be a ls dull but the fact remains that for now, at least I'm the beginning, the sailing is so long and boring that it sucks all the will to continue.

3) People who thought this game was something it is not. (This game is NOT a survival game.  It is not RUST in Pirate land.)

Salt is an exploration game and a RPG game.  It is quest driven.  The map is random and infinite but completing quests is the only real way to progress in the game.  

People who get turned off early by this game are not experiencing even a tiny drop of what this game is.  

The combat is not intense because this is not a action game - it is adventure.  Collecting ingreidents, collecting items, going to new islands, mapping the islands (you make the map yourself and get rewards for correctly mapping it).  This game feels like Zelda the wind waker and even looks like it a little bit ( no dungeons though - so far)

This game is about discovery and loot and quests and mystery and sailing.

Salt is the eptiome of being about the journey, not the destination.  It is not a game you play to beat.  It is a game you play for the experience.  A review I read a long time ago described it as ""therapeutic"", and I honestly can't think of a better word for it.  It's charming...with its atmosphere, graphics, and gameplay that pushes you to just keep sailing and exploring.

The game is filed under the survival crafting genre, but I feel like calling it that does the game a disservice.  You won't be building bases.  You won't be mindlessly chopping down trees for in-game days at a time.  You won't be constantly dealing with hunger, thirst, and temperature changes (there is a food meter in the game, but it's not a constant thorn in your side.  In fact, I believe the only thing that happens when it runs out is you don't regenerate stamina as fast).

You'll do none of those things.  What you will do is sail...and explore.

At first, you might be turned off by the game.  ""Why can't I chop down trees,"" you'll wonder.  ""Why do I have to find random logs littered on the ground?""  But the more you play, the more you realize that this system of resource gathering works to further the game's emphasis on exploration.  You won't be sitting on one island for too long.  No...you'll get what you can find and then it's off to find another one.  And it's a very peaceful experience.  You'll sail...walk around on the shores of islands...mine some rocks...hit pirates in the face with an axe.

All very peaceful...

The game isn't perfect.  No game is.  The grind to get certain things can be frustrating at times.  The procedurally generated, random nature of things means that some quests can take forever to complete, whereas you might find what you need for another quest literally on the next island over.  But the only real major complaint I have with the game comes from the combat.  It's clunky and bare bones.  You can block, attack, dodge, and that's about it.  There is a parry you can do, but the timing is so precise that it's almost impossible to do.  Not that it helps a whole lot anyways.  But the developers have said they want to work on the combat so it's likely it will get better as the game progresses.

Speaking of the developers, it goes without saying that early access on Steam has seen more than its fair share of clunkers.  But the Salt devs are one of those few that truly seem to care about their project.  So far, every major update has done nothing but make the game better.  And they're aware of their limitations as well.  They're not trying to make this big game that has everything everyone could want in it.  They're making the game they want to make and that they can make.

Salt may not be for everyone, but it's one of those rare games that truly satisfies the wanderlust festering within my soul.  It's a simple experience on its surface that has a lot of depth hiding underneath.  And it only gets better as time goes on.  With the addition of multiplayer, the game has reached new heights of awesome.

So grab some friends, sail the seas, hit some pirates in the face, and above all...have fun.",1514325883,1521912571,True,4,0,0.561586618423461914,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So I have two options now: I send the money I saved to the devs or I buy it and gift it to a friend.

Of all the games in the overdone survival genre, this is perhaps the best. It does not concern itself with minutia and tedium. It may seem odd at first, but you can't even chop  down trees! You must come across logs laying on the forest floor.

Why is this? It is because Salt does not want to waste your time chopping trees down, spending perhaps hours of total game time swinging an axe. Salt wants you to get on a boat (from a raft to large battleships, where multiple players can all hang out) and explore. Salt wants you to fill your notebook and map-grid with amusing descriptions, while you chart the islands of its vast ocean. Salt wants you to find a chest, but it won't open until you hunt down a Deer - creeping up on them with your bow, after carefully tracking their footprints through the forest. Or a chest that demands you kill all the pirates on an island. Or a character with a quest, sending you off to chart the world, or recover lost items, or annihilate some pirates. Salt wants you to revel in its loot, and equip the paper doll of your character with cool gear, complete sets that aid in everything from sailing speed to sneaking, even rope, which will help you scale steep cliffs.

The reward cycle is constant, and the world is beautiful. The light playing on the swaying grass is gorgeous. This game has the most pleasing lighting I have ever seen. Long ocean voyages may sound boring, but when there's a thunderstorm at night, and you're spotting for campfires in the pitch black fog, you really feel the vastness of this infinite world.

To finish, I have always wished games like Minecraft would have quest generation. Salt has great random quests, and the map you fill in yourself (which is verified by in-game cartographers for rewards), make this game a true adventure. You will not be building a base, you will not be chopping down wood. You will be EXPLORING.

My only criticism is that the game lacks environmental variety. I wish for frosty mountains, and lava-flows at night from sleeping volcanos. Right now, you can become tired of the 'tropical theme.' Don't let that stop you though, it is still beautiful, and worth 40 hours of gameplay or more.

I *beg* them to expand this game, but as it is, I can still recommend it.",1513138806,1514548234,True,8,0,0.568343579769134521,0,True,False,True,False,,,

As a long time Salt fan for many years this is the update I have been dreaming about, but how does it affect the overall gameplay experience of Salt?
The answer is, it changes everything
-Suddenly things like sailing the seas with 2 huge ships is possible, a scenario where this is applicable was when my friend would follow me as I taught him how to navigate to a jungle island.
-The story is great with co-op, me and my friends got to experience the suprisingly in depth storyline with a few boss fights along the way.
-The most enjoyable aspect of multiplayer is something one might not expect and it's NAVAL COMBAT! Not even kidding, although it was quite late in the game me and my friend's ship were outfitted with cannons and ready to go. Turned on team damaged picked a spot with open water and of we went, cannonballs flying everywhere, moving our ships into position for that beutiful perfect shot.
-Theres hours of pure entertainment and when the game isn't moving fast it's a relaxing and soothing adventure.
A strange thing occurs in Salt and I'm not sure many have noticed
When you start the game salt is a fairy normal survival game with the addition of sailing, however as you play more and more, the games tone and feel and what you can actually do changes drastically for the better. As suddenly your sail boat is a naval ship, your not looking for food to keep you alive your looking for treasure and loot to be the Captain Jack Sparrow of Salt! Then you follow the main quest and so much more!

Cons or ideas for future updates!
-Ai pirate ships to battle
-Improved naval battles, I.e ship damage, leaks that need repairing, torn sails, cannon holes etc
-new ship spawn system, this in my opinion is to overpowered and takes the risk out of avoiding sand bars and would be bad in naval combat.
-Dedicated servers (maybe) co-op seems to be just fine as long as their is ai ships to battle and board.
-Allow a crew system where players can be made part of a crew where they can access cannons and ship crates.
-A neutral pirate island city/ town with built in ports where pirate ships dock and npc roam, also shops and restraunts perhaps?
-Model the lower decks of some ships so they are accesable i.e pardon psuher

Even at the Early Access stage Salt has so much content and can consume hours of your game time.

Oh, I cannot describe how incredibly fun that multiplayer is! I will just say that I loved this game in singleplayer, but experiencing the new multiplayer and adventuring across the sea with friends was easily 10 times more fun. (Moreover, how they have implemented the MP is incredible with how it matches difficulty to how many players are around!)

This game already feels very much like a complete game and the developers are always updating and very active. Further, they are very interested in player feedback and suggestions (especially on Reddit). The whole atmosphere of the game and community is also positive.

All I can really say about this game is this: open-world exploration, survival, crafting, adventure, rpg-elements, pirates, and an incredible amount of fun. The world is huge and procedurally generated. There is a main storyline with bosses. There is a lot to do and find and many ships. And there is a lot more coming from the developers. So if you enjoy any of that you will really love this game.

So, is it worth the price? Yes and more! The soundtrack to the game is similarly phenomenal - just wait till you listen to that piano on the title screen. I fell in love with the game immediately.

After 24 hours of game play, I've concluded that Salt is a very enjoyable and well put together game, despite being early access. This game starts you off right away to be left up to your own devices to explore at will. Unfortunately you will be sailing alone, only meeting friendly or enemy NPS at land for now, hopefully. There is a subtle storyline, but building a basic raft and sailing away is honestly the best way to go. Lovely ambiance, pleasing graphic style and an ability to drastically alter the brightness really helps out during dark times. There's a somewhat mysterious aspect to this game, adding another level I didn‚Äôt expect and was pleased to find. There is decent amount of options for boats, clothing and weapons, along with an acceptable variation in the type of islands you can find at this point in development. Navigation is a key feature for a better enjoyment of Salt as you slowly mark out your own map as you explore, which is relatively easy to pick up with practise and the right tools. Altogether, Salt is a fun game which brings draws you back wanting to explore again and again.

It must be noted that there are a few sensitivity, smoothness and loading glitches which are expected especially when loading new areas, fighting and viewing wildlife in an early game. Occasionally islands will fail to load foliage/buildings and can be fixed either by opening your inventory, taking a screenshot or accessing the ESC menu.

Overall, a pretty enjoyable game with major potential.",1510378318,1510378631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- Game has Alot and i mean alot to do for its price tag.

Well I sort of got that in Salt but read on because it is not the only thing I needed.

     In Salt like all survival games you start out with nothing and work your way up to building what you need for survival.  Because resources are super rare in this game you will end up exploring alot to get these items.  Exploration is very same-y because there are only 2 biomes from what i found - the lush green islands you see in the screenshots and smaller desert islands with only sand and palm trees.  
     Initially it is easier to kill isolated pirates an take their items rather than make your own.  Itemization is decent, using the classification that WoW uses with Classic Everquest type stats for weapons and armor.  It doesnt take long to get what I think is the second most powerful weapon in the game, a blue grade scimitar (I ended up with three in the first 5 hours of gameplay).  I came for the combat but the enemies consist of pirates with 3 names (fight exactly the same (chopping wood combat)) a spider, a pacifist ""deer"" which looks like an elk, and reports of a tiger and a spider queen I never saw.  There are quests but the only ones I found were kill x deer, kill x pirates and find location of treasure (marked by a red x on the ground). 
     Building seems to be limited to items that can be carried on the person.  I found no recipes for building a structure or base.  The only exceptions I found were the storage box (don't build this) and boats and a campfire.
     Probably the most annoying feature of this game was when I tried to use an already existing hunters perch as a base.  I built a storage box and kept my items in it as I explored the nearby area.  I managed to wipe out an island with about 20 pirates and take their loot and I put a flag atop their highest mountain to declare this base is mine.  As I explored more and more I got farther away until one point I came back and the island had been repopulated by pirates and my flag was gone.  Then I got to base and my storage box was gone with all the items I had in it.
     In my opinion Salt is not as good as other games in the survival genre and I cannot reccomend purchase at this time",1508905660,1508905660,False,20,3,0.482301265001296997,6,True,False,True,False,,,

I'm really quite exhausted with all the Minecraft clones and zombie games; this game is neither. It makes a wonderful blend of relaxing sailing, fascinating exploration, and... well, adequate combat. The game is not perfect, but it's a work in progress with some signs that the developers have their heads in the right place.

Things you will do in Salt:

Build rafts, boats, and ships
Sail the open seas at your leisure
Be utterly lost until you acquire a compass and/or sextant
Forage for lumber, herbs, and fruit
Mine for stone, ores, and jewels
Populate a blank sea chart with islands you've discovered
Write notes in your journal (even connect notes to your map)
Go bow hunting for deer (or perhaps more exotic game)
Go fishing
Do battle with pirates of varying title and skill
Rob the corpses of said pirates
Uncover treasures buried beneath sand, soil, and sea
Amass trinkets, tools, weapons, musical instruments, and more
Pursue an optional main quest or many side quests at your leisure

If you loved the atmosphere of games such as Monkey Island and Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, you'll probably love this game. It's your own little pirate-infested archipelago extending farther than the eye can see in every direction.

Having talked the game up, here are some negative points:

The game features blocking and parrying - features I generally like - but neither feature really feels like it has proper impact on the combat system. Blocking is generally a game of greatly reducing your aggression to anticipate and partially negate incoming damage - rarely worth it. Parrying is a game of perfectly (I do mean [i]perfectly[/i]) timing your block for the moment the enemy's weapon connects with you - maybe another 100ms of breathing room would make it something I'd be more willing to master. Mostly, I just make with the quick stabby motions of a trusty dagger and keep lots of potions and bandages on hand.


EDIT: The fishing has been improved somewhat, I believe. I'm finding fish I had only read about since the 1.9.6. update. :D The following may still apply to some degree or another, but it's improving well.

The fishing in this... maybe I just haven't discovered the little tricks to getting rarer catches. I don't know if it has one, but it needs an upper limit on wait time for catches (that or I'm just inexcusably impatient, which I may well be). Other than that, I find myself building a stockpile of varying sizes of bass, regardless of equipment, magical fishing music, or super extra special lures. The fishing questline will likely be the last one I complete, apart from perhaps the cartography questline.

The game is, as [b]Early Access[/b] should imply, still in development. From a consumer perspective, this could be a negative, yes. But if this game looks like something you'd [i]love[/i] to play in its finished form, you do the game's future a disservice by choosing against purchasing it at this early stage. Besides, it's best to air your suggestions and gripes earlier than later - you may well have some small part to play in helping to debug and shape the final product if you buy in and participate now rather than later.

In conclusion: really awesome sailing game that is super relaxing and features just enough progression, crafting, and world generation to keep you going on the same save for weeks (if your attention span is as short as mine).",1508101274,1508191756,True,14,1,0.663325011730194092,0,True,False,True,False,,,

There are too many games out there that hold player's hands. In Salt, you've got just enough information to properly invest in your character and make the right decisions at the time. The world and items have depth, progress feels EARNED rather than given, which is important to me, and I feel a sense of freedom in the game that is not overshadowed by the sheer amount of open world there is.

There are repetitive parts, such as the hunting islands, pirate hunting, and treasure hunting, but these can be improved on with more content over time. The best part about this game to me is the simplicity and reliance on gameplay to feel fun, rather than strictly on graphics and effects quality. It takes me back to the gamecube era, where gameplay was the main attraction rather than cutting edge graphics.

There is a depth to the loot in the game that feels very rewarding; eventually I expect that the encounters and islands will also have some environmental depth and unpredictability to them as well, but with the options to expand my character and playstyle currently I am more than happy with what the alpha has to offer.

I like sandbox games, but I prefer voxels, survival, and multiplayer. Would a game without any of that(1) be enjoyable?

TL;DR: oh hell yes.

Since buying it, I've played almost nothing else for over a week. The game's fairly slow pace and emphasis on exploration is tickling me just right. Additionally, I've been repeatedly surprised by how much *stuff* is in the game. I keep finding out that there are more items, more books, more quests, more kinds of islands, more kinds of enemies, more ships, more things to decorate my ship with...

Before buying Salt, I thought that even if I liked it, I'd reach the satiation point with it in a few hours, maybe a day, like I do with most sandbox games. But there keeps being more to do and more places to sail to do them.

This is not an action game. Don't get me wrong: your character is fairly quick on their feet, and combat can get pretty hectic if you're outmatched, but overall it's got a slow, somewhat meditative pace to things. You sail across stretches of water, setting your own course to unexplored islands or toward sunken treasure, often fishing over the side of your ship as the waves roll the deck and the sun slowly sets.

If you really enjoy survival, crafting and sailing, this game is definitely for you. As one review put that I readd before playing 'sailing feels right', and it indeed does. Sure, at first it's a bit frustrating with the raft, but once you get the sailboat and on up, it's so relaxing. The rolling seas are also a super nice touch. Most could have made the water flat, and while it doesn't get as rough as I'd like it to, it's still fun to climb a huge wave one after the other.

Now, this game isn't exactly a triple-A or whatever the term is, so it's gonna have some flaws and such that come with it. While sailing is nice and such, combat is another feature that's just as important and to me just feels clunky and slow. It takes a bit of grinding to get a goodd weapon, but once you're set, you're more than good to go. 

At this point, there's still some bugs, and as much as I'd recommend the game I'd like to warn that at this point and time that's to be expected. The only one I've really dealt with was teleportation and put twice as far away from my original destination while sailing, into a zone where enemies were above my level, so to speak. 

One thing that I initially didn't enjoy but have come to love, is mapping. I'm sure that most players might not enjoy it but who knows. In order to map the world, you need a sextant and compass. Using co-ordinates given to you, you take out your map and ""draw"" the map in the alloted co-ordinate square. It is a bit annoying at times but it gives something to do when you're sailing on your way to somewhere. I would also call finding someone to sell stuff to a con, but sometimes you end up finding someone to sell to just when you're about to give up.

Regardless, this game is worth both buying on sale and full price, I never thought I'd have so much fun with it honestly.

So to recap, pros and cons:

PROS:
Sailing is very relaxing.
Crafting is fairly easy.
Gathering materials at first is [relatively] easy.
Looting enemies is sorta fun.
Large inventory space.

CONS:
Clunky combat.
Clearing islands of enemies in order to open chests, it gets a bit difficult after half an hour to searching to find that one last enemy.

Also, I hope to see maybe the ability to build stuff on islands, maybe making little forward-operating bases for yourself, places to store stuff for later maybe.

The very act of sailing is deceptively simple, just point your boat and go, but then there's the act of going back to an island for a quest which requires genuine planning.

1. You need a Sextant to know exactly where you are in the world.

This is an easy tool to use. Just hotkey it and press the button and voila, you now know the grid your in. Go to your map and locate said grid and mark it with an island if your on one, otherwise leave it blank.

2. A compass to make sure your going in the right direction but the compass is a little weird. 

If you want to go North-West then make sure the red arrow is pointing north-east and the white arrow is pointing south-west, think of it as North and West with the white arrow being your East-West bearing and the red arrow being the North-South bearing. Once I figured that out, it was smoother sailing.

3. Understand that the map does NOT automatically update!

Make sure you know how to work the map grids and how to document an islands location and you won't get lost. It's immensely satisfying to see your map grow and to find your way back from a long journey. 

Sadly it has one big bad point. aside from being the best way to travel, sailing is boring. The devs have hinted to spicing up the ocean with roaming pirates and I hope that means ship to ship cannon battles and even some more dangers like sea monsters but that depends on whether or not the game is going to be realistic.

The main source of content is on islands. Islands however are fun, they allow you to collect resources and gather food for long journeys. You can also hunt, fish, barter, quest and play music (like buffing yourself) as well as document key features on an island to your map such as pirate activity, hunting potential, dangerous creatures, hut locations and so on so forth.

Again, sailing is boring but at the same time it's not awful. It works well and can be fun on short journey's but the ocean needs more activity aside from fishing. I hope we get cannon battles, I really do...",1506867939,1506868311,True,11,0,0.622556865215301514,0,True,False,True,False,,,

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- the graphics look bare bones, I knew that from the screenshots before of course, but ingame it comes off even more bland

- the world is bland and boring, every island you visit feels the same, there might be the occasional hut or a ruin, but thats it, its boring

- for a game that revolves around water so much, the ocean is completely empty.....no flora and fauna whatsoever

- crafting is a big thing in survival games and yet again this game is god awful in that aspect, you cant gather wood with tools you have to collect wood off the ground which goes against every survival instinct and the wood is rare to find, at least in my playtime I encountered almost none of it, there are multiple stone types you can collect and the one that is used in most recipes, is the most rare one......even for basic things like arrows or a campfire you cant find the ingredients...or at least its way too frustrating

- combat is a joke, you literally just stand with a pirate and hit then block, hit then block and exchange that in a slow comedic way.....

- the sailing is not fun at all, it only draggs out the game by a lot. The ocean water is completely flat, there are no waves to battle or manouver around storms or something like that, its like sailing in a big hotel swimming pool

- there is no real need for a food meter, as it doesnt add anything to the game, is this a survival game? Yes? then why cant I chop down trees to make a fire. Is it an exploration game? Okay, then why keep me busy instead with hunger.....

- there are quests in the game, but I would hardly call them quests as they are so mondane and boring

- everything is presented to you in text form, you find books and literally have to read like 4 pages of a book to get some quest information, I didnt like that at all, I dont mind reading, but here it was way too often and way too long

It's not even for the fact that it breaks imersion when that comes on, you seriously do not think about it that way....but it is strictly because that buzzing and crackling annys the crap out of you. Its makes you feel as if you are on the phone menu and there is a button you can not skip, so you mentally make the "" *sigh* T_T really?"" face while you wait through it. In fact, it literally made me want to rush through an island and GTFO outta there as fast as I could. The game also feels dead and completely lifeless.

If you're looking for on-the-sea action, get Sea of Thieves. I really enjoy this game, but there are a few things I wish were different about it. Also, Salt 2 is in the works I believe, so I'd just wait for that.

Pros
It's just not what I originally thought it was. Seeing as it was early access, I assumed there would be much content to be added, and there was. 

To start there were ships, pirates, treasure, exploring, etc. I expected that they would eventually add more pirate-like things, such as naval battles, merchants traveling by sea, and a crew. None of this was added, however, and most of the content was angled toward exploration. 

Salt is definitely more of a game in which you explore the world, looking for islands and becoming the strongest adventurer. I have to admit I was a little disapointed when I saw that this game came out of early access and generally, no more content was to be added. 

This game also got quite boring doing the same thing repetitively- explore, fight get loot, repeat.
-Can get repetitive
-No naval battles
-No more content being added

Pros
This game has TONS of items to collect and use. It also has many sidequests as well as a mainquest to follow. There are also boss fights, and mini boss fights, such as fighting pirate captains on their island, or island challenges where you have to destroy all pirates or animals on an island. The way you explore in Salt also is pretty fun. There aren't pirates at sea or massive waves or anything, but the game really has a lot to it. The game also has various NPCs that you can trade with and get sidequests from. Salt really has a lot of content to it.
-Bosses
-Island Challenges
-Tons of items
-Quests
-Exploring
-NPCs
-Trading
-Treasure to find

Conclusion
I honestly think this is a pretty fun game, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sailing around, exploring, doing quests, or really anything that anyone enjoys doing or having in a game in the Pros list above. I wouldn't recommend it to people who are hoping for exciting naval battle action as it's really more of an RPG with tiers of weapons, armor, loot, and sidequests. Sadly, there is no more content being put out for this game, though the company is working on a new game called ""Wild West and Wizards,"" which should be pretty cool. It also seems that there is going to soon be a Salt 2, so if you want to wait for the (hopefully) superior version, I'd wait for that.

Good news, the developers have indeed fixed the game breaking bug. The game still has a quiet, tedious charm to it that may not fit most peoples' fancy. A lot of mundane game play for those who enjoy a grind. I still haven't played quite enough for a full review, but at least the developers are listening. Cheers.

**Original Review**

I enjoyed this game for a short time.  It doesn't hold your hand.  You learn as you go and it's a neat concept moving from island to island.  There is a lot to explore, but islands can be rather empty and boring.  There's not much in the realm of building, besides ships.  You can't just chop down trees and dig, this is not a minecraft-like game.  Combat is underwhelming.

Here's the big problem with the game: there's a game-breaking bug that can take your mediocre experience and drop it into the abyss.  Sometimes, your boat may fly into the air.  Once it sails into the heavens, you can't get it back.  Even destroying and replacing the boat seems to continue to launch it into the heavens.  In other words: no more moving island to island--the whole damn point of the game.  I had this happen a mere 2 hours into the game.  It has happened twice and the only solution is to start over.  In a game where I already find little attachment, a game breaking bug is the deal breaker.  This game is hard to like, and this bug makes it easy to uninstall.  I'm dissapointed, consider it has a positive following.  However, I don't understand why it has a postive following--I couldn't enjoy it no matter how hard I tried to.",1505758208,1599675589,True,0,0,0.475504398345947266,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I guess it's called that because this game is full of islands and pirates; well land based pirates at least. Though there are a variety of ships, I've never seen another soul on the water.

This game has a lot more loot variety than most of the others; not including 7D2D. You have several types of armor, weapons, and accessories. I haven't needed to build a base yet, so I'm not sure if that's a thing.

Unlike the other games, Salt is populated. There are merchants, pirates, inns, etc. However, they are spread out amongst hundreds of islands, so you might not see anyone at all or a small handful depending on the island size and the resources.

Combat is with other humans/ mostly pirates and cultists. There are no wolves, bears, etc. You can swim a long ways too, though even a raft is much faster. I found an abandoned pirate ship, repaired it, and now I ply the waters in style. It seems weird to control a 60' long ship by myself though‚Ä¶.

Food has to be scavenged and is always low. Trees bear fruit and deer are plentiful but shy easy so killing one takes patience. It is unlikely that you will make a clean kill with one shot, so you'll be chasing them down. A head/neck shot does massive damage though so you might get lucky. The flee AI for deer is great. You won't guess which way they'll run unless you box them in somewhere.

The map has to be populated by you. It's just a blank sheet of graph paper with longitude and latitude marks. You can find or make a sextant and compass to help with this and you can also WRITE NOTES on it. How nice that someone finally got this. It's so nice to be able to write stuff down. Things like ""chest I couldn't open in nw corner of the island at 5E 12N, etc. I don't mind maps that hold your hand but sometimes it is quite fun to do your own. Note that there are several markers ready made for the islands too.

There are lots of chests, buried treasure, ancient ruins, etc. Exploration is HUGE in this game.

While there is no multiplayer just yet, it is in the workings. The author wants some form of multiplayer because they're going to add cannon to the bigger ships and then you'll be able to have ship to ship battles in multiplayer. For us single-player folks the cannon can take out shore-wandering pirates and deer.",1505230450,1505230450,True,38,2,0.776733458042144775,2,True,False,True,False,,,

I think I honestly enjoyed watching lets plays of this game more than I enjoyed playing it, because I found the hunt for logs tedius and staying fed more difficult than I expected, maybe its because the bow mechanics felt a bit wonky and I couldn't kill dear all that effectively. 

Overall its a peaceful and beautiful world that, like many of these island sims, still lacks depth. If the game had co-op I would see it being a lot more fun, running around with a friend, clubbing pirates for their booty. But as it stands, to me, the game feels empty and a lil lonely. If I could give this a see for yourself I would because the price is good, and the visuals are good, but since I'm forced to take a hard stance, I'm not so much going to say ""DON'T PLAY THIS GAME, "" but I will instead recommend checking out the HD remake of of Windwaker if you have a WII U. That game has gorgous cell shading, and island after handcrafted island thats interesting to explore and really cool bosses, instead of what you get with this game... Islands, many of which are really similar in appearance and combat/survival mechanics that don't feel balanced yet.

1) Ships. The entire game is based around ships. It is your home, your transportation, and your storage box. We need more ships, loads more ships. Both crafting and littered to be commandeered, We need ship upgrades. Not more box types or beds but structure upgrades. Better sails, rudders, paints, material types, stats. Ships need a lot more love. We need ship battles. We should be battling AI long before multiplayer is released. This should be implemented in prep for PVP and ship to ship combat in general before Multiplayer is even a forethought. I mean seriously what are you going to do with a friend? Pick up logs together? LOL. Ships, need a lot of love in this area.

2) Islands. the only thing more detrimental than the ship is the islands. We need more, we need a lot more types. Volcanic, tidal, barrier, coral, and mix the lot. We need something to enter. As it stands there is what.. 3 buildings that you can enter? So basically most islands are barron flat ~ surfaces you walk around on to pick up logs. That is not really an adventure is it? We need ruins, I don't mean more columns stuck on the ground. I mean Aztec empires long lost. Cave systems, Beached ships, ghost towns, abandoned villages, we need something to explore. Something that tells a story without a quest, think Roanoke Island. 

3) Danger. We need threat. As it stands I have a better chance of finding end game loot than dieing. Sharks.. seriosly, it's the ocean, think about it. Bears, boars, snakes, Long forgotten traps. We need a sense of danger, a threat. 


My opinion of the game as it is. Definitly a lot of time and love has gone into this. The devs seem to communicate and listen. The game is definitly headed down a good road. Updates are pretty regular and usually pretty good sized. Honestly, the game is boring as it stands. Don't get me wrong, fun on that first run but it don't take long to see that massive hole in content. It don't take long to realize you will be staring at the same four or five islands for hours and hours. If you buy the game, buy it to play threw once and shelve it. It has a long way to go. Multiplayer is not going to be a saving grace. Instead of one person board out of his mind now you have two people picking up logs on the same map. This is going to be a great game if the Devs see it threw. My opinion anyway. As it stands, not yet.

Edit 07/09/18
Fixed Your you're, thanks :)

So it looks like the Dev team has called it complete. Other than a few patches, it's done. For five bucks? Absolutely worth it. You will get a few hours out of it. Unfortunately my entire wish list still stands. 

 It's my understanding the Devs are moving forward on another project. 
Based on Salt I am looking forward to see what they dream up next. I feel Salt was a leaning tool for them and from here their games will only get better!",1502903318,1531153418,False,106,2,0.684970557689666748,7,True,True,True,False,,,

Very chill, and being as I have watched this game from the update just before the ship redesign up to now I might as well toss my two cents in.

1. Graphics: The graphics in this game are very simplistic, that doesn't mean they are bad graphics, they are fantastic as they are and despite the minimal design they really add to the games charm.

2. Gameplay: The gameplay here is fairly good, the combat system has been polished somewhat but it does still need a bit of work. Sailing is absolutely fantastic, it makes you feel like a true sailor to go across the sea with compass in hand and consulting your personally drawn map.

3. Nitpicks: These are pretty much the only things I could find that bother me, you can probably disregard them as personal preference or nitpicking...
The first issue most people will have is that multiplayer does not exist yet, the devs have stated that they will not add multiplayer untill most of the big updates are finished, so fear not! It will come soon. I would recommend buying a couple copies for when it does come out.

The second issue I have is that the storage systems are incredibly expensive. You find so much loot in this game, and while the inventory is practically bottomless, it is nice to have chests marked out for where you want your booty to be stored (Arr), however a chest costs 6 hardstone to make (which I barely ever find), and 6 iron(Nearly impossible to find) if you want a decent chest. Crates are cheap but they have like... 5 slots, certainly not enough space to store all your ill gotten gains. Some cheaper alternatives would be fantastic.

Besides that, I must have gotten pretty lucky with most of the early access titles I have been following, because this game not only has potential, but I belive that it could be one of my all time favorites when its done.

I give this a 9/10, seriously, buy a couple copies, save the extras for your friends when multiplayer comes out, and in the meanwhile get on a ship and start exploring! Arr!

Edit: It has been a few years, multiplayer is out now, the game is still just as enjoyable as I say it is. However, the Dev's stopped updating the game, no more things are being added to the game. Unless moddability is perhaps brought into the game as of right now it just has exactly what I say it has, and nothing more.

If you are okay with that (I certainly still am, I come back to it all the time) than please, by all means buy this game, I would reccomend it at any price you are most comfortable with, I don't hold it against the company that they would turn away from this game to move on to greater things. It is a good game to wind down, with a bottle of rum. I am changing my review to 7/10, still highly reccomend, but its not going anywhere else.",1502845367,1543709548,True,6,3,0.605016708374023438,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I played the version 1.8.0 before, and now I'm progressing through v. 1.9.5 . The developers have added many new features and improved a lot the visuals of the islands and NPCs. Even without the soon-to-be-implemented clouds, the skydome is amazing. The sunrise and sunsets are breath-taking, and also is the night sky full of stars. To my surprise, the game has included tides, working synchronously with moon phases. I must say that, as someone from Brazil, and now living abroad, this game truly makes me fell at home somethings. Specially when contemplating distant islands from beachs during the sunsets.

With new lore flashed out through books, enemies, dialogs and events the randomly generated worlds of salt seems much more consistent now. The developer have also added new items and bosses, which keep making you wish to explorer outward.

For future updates, I wish that the islands get more populated and the NPCs acting more lively. I'm eager to see other boats trading from island to island, even if they are just following a programmed track. I'd also like to find actual villages or cities of friendly NPCS; different tribes (firendly or hostile) with languages we must decipher to comunicate.
Likewise, I hope that oceans also get more populated with sharks, whales, storms and currents.

Besides all updates we're still going to get in the future, I already recomend it for anyone as a very good game the way it now is.

Bien plus √©volu√© en l'√©tat actuel que ce qu'en pr√©sentent les vid√©os francophones sur YouTube. 
Et l√©ger avec √ßa, que √ßa en tourne nickel (juste de rares bizarret√©s plus marrantes qu'autre chose :  Premi√®re nuit sur le bateau, premier plumard : au r√©veil, perso' et bateau envoy√©s en l'air, pour retomber de tr√®s tr√®s  haut dans la flotte - Tu parles d'un r√©veil ! : M√™me Bobonne l'aurait pas invent√© - trop g√©nial, le gag du lit-catapulte ! - Me dites pas que c'est  un bug... Serais d√©√ßu.)
Prise en main relativement facile, un univers et une ambiance-son des plus sympathiques, du loot √† foison, un craft qui m'a l'air pas mal et qui va s'√©toffer au fil des d√©couvertes... Que du bon ! Seul probl√®me, pour barrer le radeau, il faut tourner le dos √† la proue, mais d√®s le second bateau, c'est r√©gl√©, puisqu'on dispose d'une roue de gouvernail.
L√©g√®rement emb√™tant aussi : m√™me de jour, si on veut distinguer les d√©tails des sous-bois, on a int√©r√™t √† jouer avec la luminosit√©, mais comme on y acc√®de rapidement, en cours de jeu, par un simple ESC ou, plus direct, la lettre O, c'est pas trop g√™nant... 
A part ces petites contrari√©t√©s, je me r√©p√®te, mais que du plaisir ! M√™me avec ses pirates et de rares b√©b√™tes pas sympathiques, √ßa reste un jeu hyper-cool, une occasion de pure d√©tente ludique sans prise de t√™te.
Quant √† l'interface, quelque peu d√©routante au d√©part, elle est de fait tr√®s bien con√ßue, quoique l'inventaire devienne, apr√®s moultes trouvailles, quelque peu bord√©lique. Heureusement il y a une barre d'acc√®s rapide 10 emplacements (faut cocher la case dans les options) : clic droit maintenu et chiffre, de 1 √† 0 pour attribuer... 
Autre truc : apr√®s on dispose d'objets √† placer (lit, portraits, bras√©ro, supports de torche, etc ) qu'on peut r√©cup√©rer par un ""E"" maintenu.
Et oui, d√®s qu'on a un bateau avec cabine, on peut l'am√©nager et disposer d'un lit : plus de bois √† gaspiller pour les feux de camp ! 3√®me type de bateau : le bateau de pirate - un deux mats -, qu'on trouve g√©n√©ralement aux extr√©mit√©s d'une carte, et qu'on peut r√©parer : 40 bois + 10 bois durs + 8 cloth swatch (craftables √† partir de fibres v√©g√©tales) + 10 plant fibers (craftables √† partir de bambou) - Je le signale pour vous permettre de vous y pr√©parer, puisqu'on ne conna√Æt la recette (clic sur le poste de gouverne) qu'en trouvant l'√©pave -. Des bateaux plus √©volu√©s existent, mais il faut en trouver les plans...
Des mat√©riaux de construction √† partir de pierre et de bambous sont craftables aussi... Le craft semble tr√®s riche, mais on y acc√®de lentement - surtout quand on ne sait s'orienter, et qu'on compl√®te / rend les qu√™tes ""au petit bonheur la chance""...

Un petit conseil en passant : D√®s que vous avez le bateau de pirate, gardez n√©anmoins le deuxi√®me bateau en tant que canot. Pourquoi ? parce que la nage fatigue √©norm√©ment et qu'aborder une √Æle avec une endurance √† 0, c'est pas l'id√©al...; d'autre part, un gros bateau est bien moins manoeuvrable, surtout dans un groupe d'√Ælots. Plus  pratique d'amener votre canot √† proximit√© et de sauter √† l'eau - Variante : √† partir du canot, g√©n√©rer le gros bateau (""B"") au plus proche.
Un autreconseil : parsemez votre bateau principal de torches (qui durent √©ternellement), y compris dans la mature et le pont inf√©rieur - Vous le rep√©rerez de loin -. Pour fixer la torche  (""T"") sur le porte-torche (1 ironite), ""E"" non maintenu.

A quand une traduction fran√ßaise ? - Parce que si l'anglais ne d√©range pas trop dans le jeu et pour le craft, pour les bouquins √† lire et les qu√™tes, c'est quand m√™me assez frustrant... - l'occasion peut-√™tre de m'acheter un dico' et  de r√©actualiser, voire d'√©toffer mes maigres r√©minescences, le jeu ayant de rares dialogues et un rythme cool qui permettrait ais√©ment la chose...

Personnellement, j'ai pas encore pig√© la fa√ßon de me servir de la carte... (quel rapport journal, onglet Map, et carte ?) Si quelqu'un a compris et peut m'expliquer en bon fran√ßais... (?)

J'ai commenc√© √† r√©diger cette √©valuation il n'y a pas trois jours, apr√®s 4 heures de jeu; ce soir, j'en suis √† 48 heures (non ! 58,3 - eeeuh...) et viens de l'√©toffer / rectifier... Oui, je sais... 
M'en fous ! M'amuse.

Tr√®s tr√®s prometteur ce Salt...! Un petit bijou √† la fois de simplicit√© de conception et de richesse de fond : √ßa change agr√©ablement. Et on ne le soup√ßonnerait jamais, mais qu'est-ce qu'il peut √™tre  riche en contenu, ce jeu !

Remarque Mac Sierra : √† la r√©attribution des touches (pr√©vues qwerty), l'√©cran plante syst√©matiquement...; le jeu est cependant jouable, mais en qwerty. Par contre, aucun probl√®me sous Win10

Je reprends en janvier 2018 et - d√©ception ! - Le jeu n'a gu√®re √©volu√©... Je me serais attendu √† voir l'artisanat d√©velopp√© (construction, terrassement, cuisine, etc) , mais non ! On a maintenant le sempiternel mode multijoueur qui attire les foules avides de baston, fi√©vreuses de d√©molir ce qu'un autre a laborieusement construit...

It's really a fantastic game, lots of fun, but it really is unique in the deluge of survival games on Steam.

A bare-bones summary of gameplay is you go sailing from island to island, looking for NPCs to do quests for, better gear, loot, etc. What makes [i]Salt[/i] so interesting is that its very basic premise - explore, loot, repeat - and its very basic graphics should make the game boring at best. It is just the opposite, however. 

When you start out, you have nothing. You are on an island, and that is it. Explore around the island, and you will find some useful items to help get you started, perhaps the most important one being the raft, which will allow you to traverse the sea (you could theoretically swim but the time it would take to get anywhere makes it completely impractical). Any island you see on the horizon is an island you can visit. 

Almost all islands have harvestable resources - the island could also contain deer that you can hunt, stranded pirates, ancient burial sites, graves of unfortunate adventurers, and other cool stuff. Islands can also house hunting tree stands, inns, merchants, fisherman, scholars, and other NPCs, almost all of which can give you quests. 

Some islands will have derelict pirate ships ""docked"" near them with a lootable chest on board (you may need a key to access first!). These ships can also be repaired and used once more on the high seas! These larger ships can be decorated with various interior decorating items you can either craft from resources or collect by completing quests. You can also find blueprints for even larger and better looking ships. 

[i]Salt[/i] also has an abundance of ""side-activities"" that players can do. These include (but isn't limited to):
[list]
[*]Fishing
[*]Kill X number of pirates to open the pirate loot chest
[*]Kill X number of deer to open hunter's loot chest
[*]Pulling up treasure from the bottom of the sea

The game also has an interesing map mechanic - you do not have a map that tells you where you are in the world. You actually have to draw the map yourself. The game functions off a grid world, and an island can occupy one or four grid squares. You can find the location of an island you are on using a sextant. Once the sextant gives you the coordinates, you can plop down an island marker on the map at the given coordinates. It's a pretty awesome mechanic. You can also find or craft a compass, which makes navigation on the high seas much easier, and is thus an extremely valuable tool.

Overall, while simplistic in premise and implementation, [i]Salt[/i] is a strangely absorbing game with lots of little things to do to keep you busy if you get bored with one thing or another, quests to help you advance, and - more importantly - [i][u]infinite[/u][/i] exploration. This game is well and truly the explorer's dream game. As of writing I have 26 hours on record, and fully expect to sink in many more. It is also a single-player only experience at this time, however the devs are apparently making progress towards adding coop to the game at some point. Regardless, the game is worth buying, and is a must-buy when it goes on sale.",1499994747,1499994747,True,10,3,0.626189351081848145,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It may appear to be a basic game, but it has an incredible amount of depth and content, all of which is surprisingly unique. Although it is lacking a small bit of world variation at the moment, not many games scratch my exploration itch like Salt.
Even though I work on the wiki constantly, every day I'm discovering new stuff that I had no idea existed until then.

It does, however, sometimes test your patience, as a fair amount of progression is based on RNG, and the ship journeys can last quite some time (though I, personally, very much enjoy just sitting on my ship, watching the waves and islands float by).

The most recent updates have nearly doubled the amount of content, and the devs have a lot more plans for the game, such as base building, multiplayer (soon!), new ships and more.

As everyone else has said, it's incredibly relaxing. Even when at sea and the waves start to get high and the music begins to pitch, you can still feel greatly at ease.  You're never rushed to do anything and can just explore the world as you collect quests from merchants and guildsmen. 

Not only that, but for an Early Access game, it has enough content to keep you entertained and engaged for a long time. The developers are pleasantly talkative and keep you posted very frequently on updates and anything else they're working on.

Once you get to the first other island in the game you'll most likely already start discovering new things and recipe books that will bring you the motivation to keep playing and craft new boats, weapons, and armor. I say ""motivation"" because when I play games, a lot of the times I fall short of completing them and end up deserting them.

Not only is this game fun, but it's relaxing and you can play it at your own leisurely pace. There's no rush! In this game I find myself not constantly worrying about having to get food or get this and that. Plus you can sleep at night! Not all survival games have that and it sucks wasting time sitting in a house all through the night.

I had recently finished repairing one of the pirate ships I found (which felt very rewarding) and it was getting dark. I had also made a fire pit to put on the deck so I could have light and sleep through the night. Standing there on the boat at night looking at a nearby island, I felt comfortable and relaxed. The gentle sound of the ship creaking, the waves slapping against the sides of the boat, and the light crackle of the fire put me at ease.

This would not be as much of a problem if the block negated all of the damage, like it does in most games. However, in this case, parrying saves you from some of the damage, but not all of it. Even if you block every attack perfectly, you will still die if you are fighting against an opponent with a large health pool or if you were at low health when the enemy attacked you.

If you like exploration games, buy it. If you like unique survival games, buy it. If you like sailing, this is a better sailing simulator than Wind Waker.

This might be one of the most visually and auditive stimulaing games i've ever played. And with a more powerful computer, you can easily get lost in the sound and colour of the wild sea. Thank Russ there is an option to blend out the HUD, so you can embrace the beautiness of the unexplored land on its full scale. Even on low settings, everything is very stylised and appealing for the eye of the eager explorer. But if you like the cartoony, downgraded look of the game more, you can just adjust the game to make it look more cartoony

The survival aspect is not as present, but the main point of SALT is the exploration and giving you the feeling of being your own ship captain. Also, the quests and different factions you can join make up for a lot of work, and frame the exploration very well.

Crafting is already very advanced and works more or less without a lot of confusion, you just have to figure out everything. From flower potions to ship decorations, entire ships even, or glowing magic swords made out of moon stones, if it has to do with killing people or sailing, you can craft it.

Fighting is very tricky though, because basically every hostile creature, pirates, captains, and especially cultists, are all capable of hurting you really really bad, thats where the handy quicksave comes in, which should be used before any challenging encounter.

With all the different mechanics of exploration, crafting and looting, there is a lot to do and explore in SALT, which honestly can be quite tedious, because the map is HUGE. Lots of islands, temples, mountains, and a hell of a lot of water you have to explore. Orientation can be really really offputting, because the only things you have for mapping are a map you have to fill up with landmarks and such all by your own, a sextant and a compass you have to raid from pirate cartographers. So you have to fill up the map all on your own if you want to get the least bit of information in geography, and even then orientation is really confusing, because you only have a compass to show you the direction you want to go in.

All in all, I already love this game with only 14 hrs on record, and I can recommend it to anyone who likes good visuals, immersive exploration and sailing, if they aren't bothered by how tideous it sometimes can be.",1492879278,1492879278,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The devs are very open to feedback and are (relatively) consistently pushing out GOOD, community-driven updates. Multiplayer is in progress, if that's your sort of thing.

PRO'S
------
+ Devs are constantly working on bug fixes and new content (I first bought this game over a year ago and only played for ~4 hours, I came back a while ago and it was significantly improved)
+ Devs actually listen to community feedback
+ Randomly generated, infinite world, allowing for constant exploration
+ A large system of quests, I've beaten the main quest line and still have many more ""side quests"" to complete
+ Relaxing game, requiring minimal brain-power (I could easily listen to audiobooks while playing)
+ Great soundtrack (For when I wasn't listening to audiobooks)
+ HUGE amount of items and lore books
+ Can run well (40 fps) on my crappy computer (4 gigs RAM, GTS 250, duo-core CPU [2.5 GHz])
+ Not overpriced
+ You can put multiple items on the same hotkey (For example, I can press 6 once and pull out my compass, or press it twice and pull out my spyglass)

CON'S (* INDICATES THIS IS EXPECTED OF EARLY ACCESS GAMES)
------
- Combat doesn't vary, and can become quite bland
- Bugs/glitches* (None are gamebreaking, so far)
- Early-game can be a little frustrating (Resources are quite scarce, and you can't accurately start making your map [see neutral point 3] until you get a sextant, which can take up to an hour to get)
- Travel can become boring (This is where audiobooks come in)
Note: They've since added storms and treasures along the sea, but it still feels boring with long distance trips. Perhaps some sort of way to unlock ""fast travel"" to certain Inns would be nice.
- Worlds may have to be reset with some updates*
- Requires basic compass/map navigational skills (Can be learned in 5 minutes on google)

NEUTRAL (Some players will view these as pros, and others as cons)
-------
-+ Graphics aren't the best (If this drives you away, you're missing out a lot of good games)
-+ Infinite inventory (It removes part of the challenge of inventory management, although there becomes a point where you can't access some items until you remove others to make room for them in the visible inventory)
-+ You create your map (Cartography)
-+ You are never OP (Enemies have a minimum amount of damage they do and some will always be a bit of a challenge)

Overall, I give this game an 8/10 as it is now, but predict it will become a 10/10. The only things that bring this down are the bland combat and the occasional obnoxious bug. I've, essentially, beaten the game and there are still loads of things I have not done and tons of items I have yet to discover. Content is constantly added and is always great.

Besides this a lot of basics are missing:
- controls need to be changed in a pop up menu that appears before the actual game starts, there are no options in-game to change it;
- while playing, you can not load a game. You have to go back to the main menu to do that;
- no auto/toggle forward/run/move button, annoying in a game where you move slow,,,,and you need to move a lot.

The game has potential, but the studio is a small team of persons and that shows in the game. Looking at what they plan to do in v.1.9.5. I see they waste time on moronic stuff: 
""We've also made some subtle changes to the main menu, adding a randomly generated island in the background, some new graphical effects, and the ability to slightly move the camera, giving it a more immersive feel.""

Went from scraping by and barely surviving to cruising the deep blue as a one man pirate operation with a tricked out ship.... and still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, or that I'm missing things to progress the story. 

You can mess around for days in one area and build supplies or scavenge or stay on the move working on quest items or rng treasure. The last update I played (there have been a couple and multiplayer added since) added maps and the ability to make your own map. Since you load a ""game"" each time the coordinates of certain things you may need or wish to find are ever-moving.  There were a few bugs with characters not being somewhere or vanishing/clipping, but rather rare honestly. 

Performance wise it is a small install/download (500mb) and ran very well for me although I had some slow-down after packing myself down with logs/numerous items and there being numerous objects on screen or loaded.  I had read they were working on animals despawning more consistently and other things like grass/trees to improve this, however. 

Graphically it is simple yet has beautiful moments and possible views.  The characters are a little bland initially but soon grow on you as you interact and/or kill them.  The art style is nostalgic yet creative and you can see future possibilities as endless with the smallest tweaks or changes if they feel so inclined at some point. 


When I played (been busy, waiting a few updates) it was quickly addictive and fed the progression urges for several days anytime I had a moment. I would definitely buy it again just to try and make sure the devs continue updating and completing their vision.

I‚Äôll be honest: when I first heard of Salt I was intrigued and ‚Äì although the graphics were very ‚Äúcartoony‚Äù and rather simplistic compared to other somewhat-similar games on the (Early Access) market, and the game was in Early Access ‚Äì the availability of the demo persuaded me to give it a go. 
This is where I lost interest in Salt (although still interested enough to maybe come back to the game at a later stage). And unfortunately I‚Äôm not sure whether they‚Äôve updated the demo since the game‚Äôs first release, but I sincerely hope they have because of two simple reasons:

The first reason is because the time I spent playing the demo back in 2014 I found not enjoyable at all; seriously. I felt as if even the time it took me to download the free demo was time wasted. 
This brings me to the second reason I hope they‚Äôve updated the demo in the meantime because ‚Ä¶ it does not do the actual game justice! 
I‚Äôm sorry, but the demo that was put online upon the Early Access release was so terrible that I uninstalled the game within an hour of playing. I sincerely hope this is no longer the case because, people; this game is pretty spot-on. 
A discount and seeing positive reviews and recent and regular updates finally pulled me over the line and, boy, am I glad that happened. 
Within just a few days I‚Äôve got over 15 hours in and I‚Äôve seen‚Ä¶ What? About 10 islands, maybe?

I admit; this probably has a lot to do with my navigation skills (which are apparently non-existent).
As I stand proudly aboard my fixed-up old pirate vessel ‚Äì a map in one hand, and a compass in the other ‚Äì with the wind bellowing in my sails I revisit the same islands over and over again as I have absolutely no idea on how to navigate using the map and the compass. 15 hours and approximately 10 islands later, I have gotten nowhere near the Treasure Island I have been searching for since the day I killed my first pirate and got hold of his treasure map, and I‚Äôve enjoyed every single second of it. (I still hope to make my way to the Treasure Island, though).

For the record: Salt has ‚Äì as far as I‚Äôve noticed ‚Äì nothing to do with the cooking ingredient (as a matter of fact; cooking isn‚Äôt even part of the game (yet?)), so I‚Äôm guessing the developers went with this name because of the salty seawater; and there‚Äôs lots of that!

You wake up on a beach as a completely invisible personage ‚Äì not joking! The items you pick up ‚Äì such as swords ‚Äì have a shadow, but you don‚Äôt ‚Äì after obviously something happened. Maybe a shipwreck or perhaps you were left by your captain because of mutiny? I‚Äôm not quite sure about the reason why, but someone has left you a book ‚Äìas you obviously did in the seventeen-hundreds ‚Äì telling you he tried to wake you and, instead of robbing you blind and emptying the treasure chest nearby, leaves you with some sweet starter‚Äôs loot and the advice to search for the inn. 

A nearby raft can easily be fixed up with the wood and other items you find on your starter-island and before long you will set off towards another nearby island.
This is something you will repeat many, many times, but it is just so incredibly relaxing floating around on your tiny raft whilst circling a small island or just simply gliding over the calm waves of the azure-blue sea. 
It‚Äôs a tranquil mix of sailing, exploring and scavenging; all the while island-hopping and filling your bottomless pockets with anything you can find.

The crafting menu could use a little work still but it works pretty straightforward so you really don‚Äôt have to be a genius to figure out these mechanics. However, navigating ‚Äì as mentioned before ‚Äì you either understand or you don‚Äôt, resulting in you either ending up at the place you were aiming for or being hopefully lost at sea and just go with the flow. I fall into the latter category. 
I would welcome some improvement there, although I do like to map the islands on my own sea-chart which is, in my opinion, a nice ‚Äúmini-game‚Äù that does add to the explorers experience; it just needs a little more tweaking to make it work a tad better. 

This still being an early access title does mean there‚Äôs quite a bit of content missing and leaves still a lot of potential for growth in the future. To complete the piraty-experience I would like to see different kinds of weather which also affect the way the sea behaves, caves filled with traps and treasures possibly hidden behind waterfalls in lush jungle-forests, a wider selection of animals including turtles shuffling on the beach, birds in the sky, monkeys in the trees, and also adding coconuts or bananas ‚Äì there are so many palm-like trees, and not a single coconut to be found ‚Äì nor would I say no to some form of being able to pick an island you like and build your own little pirate‚Äôs nest there (which just sounds like a fantastic idea for a swashbuckling multiplayer). 

The game isn‚Äôt perfect yet, and the absence of a gamma slider ‚Äì even if you lower the screen-brightness on the laptop the vivid colours of this game can most certainly hurt your eyes ‚Äì is a bit of a downside in my opinion. There are various lighting effects that definitely need polishing (place a fire-pit on your top-deck and it‚Äôll light up the usually dark-and-damp captain‚Äôs cabin like a Christmas tree) and combat can certainly use some adjusting, but if you‚Äôre looking for a beautiful fun game in which you feel completely free to explore an immensely huge world all the while scavenging for materials to either build a new boat or ride the high seas in your very own fixer-upper abandoned pirate ship, than this is a game for you. Hours will literally pass by both in-game and in real-life while you‚Äôre playing Salt. Don‚Äôt let the rather poor demo spoil the fun you can have. 
And although the raft is an awfully wonky thing to start the game with; it gets better the moment you‚Äôve found enough resources to build your first proper sailing boat, making the whole gaming experience a lot better. 

TL;DR: 
A big thumbs up for this pirate-like free-roaming explorer‚Äôs game. Don‚Äôt let the demo rob you of the fun you can have in the full game. If not sure; buy it on a discount. There are regular updates, but keep in mind this game remains still in Early Access (even though its release has been over 2 years ago and still needs a lot of work).",1490204860,1490204860,True,10,0,0.586775302886962891,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Recently I really dived into the vast sea in hopes of finding something worth making this title a recommendation. 

Personally, I do 'enjoy' the game, as it encourages you to seek out entertainment as opposed to force feeding it to you. I'll go over a few points that really stand out. 

Combat is as basic and bland as it could possibly be. I find it by no means to be difficult dealing with pirates/spiders/deer. Pathing is a complete and utter abomination that NEEDS to be rectified. If you have the slightest bit of intelligence and problem solving in that brain of yours, then this game shouldn't be an issue combat-wise what so ever. This only becomes easier and more of a joke as you collect gear. However, the game isn't a tank and spank playstyle. More often than not, running and re engaging is your best bet in any multi target fights. Oh and get gud with a bow, scrub, it's as simple as it gets with bow mechanics.
Equipment is nicely distributed, and hard enough to come by that it doesn't make you immediately OP. However, I find the amount of craftables to be something to desire. I don't think having every craftable available at the start is a good thing. I am probably wrong at this, but for a game that encourages exploration, I was really disappointed to already know how to make 'The Red Maiden' ship and a full set of cobalt armor and weapons; without ever needing to find the book that actually does talk about these things. It's that attention to detail that Salt misses, that really makes it lose appeal.

Now the meat of the game is exploration, and navigating is really fun in my opinion. Hard at first to figure out, and sometimes the compass doesn't align very well with the world, but once I got a hang of finding my place in the world...well the game really openned it's doors. Finding maps on pirates that lead to different merchants/ruins/towns etc, was a blast. BUT, this isn't a selling point, and I may as well play any other exploration game if not for the sailing. Singleplayer adds to the immersion of being stranded initially, but over time as I repaired a pirate ship and sailed around for an hour or two, I found myself wanting crewmates or some sort of greater NPC interaction than just quest givers and merchants. 

Which leads me to...multiplayer.

I feel like the outcry for mulitplayer has derailed development for the actual game itself. It's honestly not the next direction of development that needs to be handled. That seems like something for the end of development, when all the pieces are in place and really blowing the minds of people playing it. Having other players in the game is going to cause allot of problems. It won't work right intially, people WILL have problems and then those people that try it and are unhappy are going to complain about the game. I feel this is an ankle slice for development, and it actually is a big 'fuckyou' to a crowd that enjoys this game as is and wants more of the game itself.


TLDR? Do I recommend Salt?

Yea it's a decent game, but I wouldn't push it on anyone. I personally have enjoyed it, but I'd say this is a niche game. 

I can't stress enough, that this is a game that still needs allot of work and attention. Keep that in mind if you purchase it.",1489501015,1489501061,True,56,1,0.789376497268676758,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It isn't, at least not for me. The idea of sailing around on a raft aimlessly across the sea battling pirates with a lack-luster combat system is not my idea of entertainment.  Unless you're really good with the bow and the crude arrows, the basic pirates will allways win. It is easy to be overcome and healing items are limited. The game forces you to spend countless hours looking for mats in hopes to build a better boat than that awkward raft you start with. Also need to hunt deer on the off chance it'll drop a pelt to craft even the basic armor. 9 times out of 10 in my experiences, the deer rarely drops enough pelts to even craft the simplest of armors. I don't see spending countless hours hunting deer to be relaxing nor fun. I wouldn't reccommend this game for anyone who may be looking for any type of instant satisfaction because it definintely won't happen in Salt.",1489385428,1489385428,False,9,2,0.524603128433227539,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I play with a sort of ninja/Metal Gear Solid style combat method, lots of hit and runs, using the bow; etc; it's more ""Espionage/Tactical blah blah blah"" than the new Metal Gear is by a long shot; so I actually prefer Salt for my fix of that.

Just started playing again, as I got it ages ago when it was still very early in development, and I was waiting for it to be more fleshed out; now it is; and it is glorious.

The AI retreats if they don't think they can match you, regroups, plots; and if they know they can take you; they will come after you like savage dogs.

The graphics are good enough; the cartoon style is betraying of the complexity of the game play itself; but it's not complex like many modern games, in that you need to sink 10,000 hours into it to understand the basics; you can just hop in, and go.

As a boat building/sailing kind of guy in real life, I find this to be a good way to deal with winter time in Canada; when I can't get out on the real water.

This is for sure a game anyone can enjoy, from young to old; from casual to hard core; and it's one of the few games that is open world that is really open in the sense of play style, as I previously mentioned. There is nothing stopping you from getting a good ship, and just sailing for a million miles in one direction, if that's what you want to do; or if you prefer, combing each and every island.

I really dig the map system they added, where I plot out what I find, and can leave notes etc.

I enjoy the fishing in it too; the dev's have done a great job of making it so the player develops their own superstitious idea's about how to catch the fish; and that sort of thing; it's very realistic in that way.",1487735778,1487735778,True,6,0,0.513185441493988037,0,True,False,True,False,,,

There are those who like to chase around, all guns blazing and living in the moment. The other kind is the type who doesn't mind the grind, and takes time to look at where he/she is and enjoying the moment. 
I have logged a lot of hours in 7 Days to Die and even in that, my style is fight when you have to, but get home before dark and enjoy being by the fire.
Salt is for the latter kind of player. Graphically speaking, this isn't photo realism, but it soon takes on a beauty all of its own until you don't even notice how different it is. Trees and leaves sway in the wind, Deer dash here and there and the constant sound of the sea, crashing on the shore, makes the sound a real treat. Music only appears at key moments and when it does come in, it's very welcome, as it means you are near something interesting, or you're about to encounter something special. You soon learn the meanings. Longer musical pieces appear at seemingly random times, and the musical style itself ups the immersion factor ten-fold. 
Beginning with a simple raft, you make your way up through the various ship types, by collecting wood and stone, animal hide and plant fibres. The quests are interesting enough, the foes are of varying strength and difficulty, and the game world is enormous. What makes this game beautiful to me, is after a hard day running around an island getting resources, I make my way back to my upgraded pirate ship, mark the island position on my map - and write a few notes in my diary - before setting my sails billowing and retiring to my cabin to read one of the many books dropped by NPC's. I might even do a spot of night fishing if in the mood, as different fish appear at different times and locations.

If the gentle swell of the ocean in a gorgeously rendered world, where you can go where you please, when you please and do what you please, is your thing then buy this game. It is quickly becoming my new favourite go-to game, and for me, reading by torchlight in my gently rising and falling captains cabin, or crafting stuff for tomorrow and plotting my next island visit really does float my boat. The immersion factor is high, and the islands fading out of sight behind you, as you sail into an incredible sunset, gives you a real feel for life on the ocean waves. After a few recent disappointments from Devs promising much and delivering little, this little gem is a real breath of sea air.

There is a lot of content now compared to last I played, the game seems much smoother and much more balanced overall. I can't quite put my finger on the exact reason why, but I love the ocean physics and sailing the bigger ships around. There is a bit of a learning curve to begin but as long as you read a little you should do fine. If you are like me and always want to learn on the fly, then prepare to restart a couple of times as you realize key features you were overlooking and have to dump your poor excuse for a map. Let me just say, to make a map in the game requires a compass and a sextant. It is damn near impossible without these. I know this is not a photo realistic game but I like this style of graphics and I am always willing to sacrifice some visuals in exchange for depth of gameplay, performance and features.

If you played this game before and lost interest it is definitely worth another look. Give it some time to grow on you and learn the gameplay and you msot likely will find yourself losing hours without realizing it, I know I have.

Featuring:
 Unresponsive blocking / parrying. 

Blocking / parrying where even if the game does respond (which is unlikely to happen during combat) to your clicking the button, it doesn't matter because the enemy still hurts you.

Cool attack moves where you completely waste your time slashing an opponent only to have that opponent seem to randomly, on and off again, have no hit box. So it's as if you're swinging at air. I call it the ""royally piss me off at the worst possible moment attack.""

Trees that you can't cut down ... even though there are axes, and no, not just battleaxes or props, I mean actual woodcutter type axes in the game ... that you actually wield. There are even tree stump models but don't be fooled, you can't make those yourself, you just have an axe ... for cutting wood ... that you can't cut wood with, and plenty of trees to cut down ... that you can't, so don't be fooled by the faq / fact that there are axes in the game, and good luck finding randomly spawned logs on the ground, if any of the logs you need spawn near the trees ... that are entirely made out of the wood. Oh, gee, where will I ever find the wood I need? Maybe I should try this forest entirely made out of the wood I need ... eh, nope.

AI so terrifying ... ly stupid that it wanders off to nowhere the second you get into water.

Water ... with essentially nothing in it.  Yea, you know that ""salt"" water ocean you see and which is like ... the major focus of the game? Yea, there's basically nothing in it, no sharks, no pirates, no debris, no sea monsters ... NOTHING. I say basically nothing because there is, thankfully, a decent fishing minigame (no, the fish are not swimming around), and also ...

Derelict boats ... that cost just as much to simply repair as they do to build. Lucky you, ... you just came across ... something you could have just built yourself, so what the fuck is the difference? 

Absolutely zero threats to your ship whatsoever ... despite being a ""pirate"" game, and there being wrecked versions of most ships to my knowledge.

Vendors / quest givers who seem a bit dead, I mean, they don't do anything, not even look at you when you are talking to them. They possess all the charm of an inanimate Pillsbury Doughboy.

A pickaxe I cannot find for the life of me. I guess it's supposed to be on the starter island but I scoured that island. Maybe it glitched ... every time I started a new game. I just know it's not fun wasting my time trying to find it and having to pass up all the ore. Edit: I did eventually find a picaxe but based on one of the early in-game books, it still seems as if there's supposed to have been one at the start.

End of sarcasm of the game's ""great"" features: Everything could be overlooked if it wasn't for that combat system, there is no excuse for that unresponsive garbage, not even being early access, the devs should be ashamed to have made such a shitty combat system, but the thing is, you can tell that the devs really care about this game overall, it isn't just a cash grab but someone's dream. That makes it hard to criticize but no matter that the game has a heart of gold, it sucks ... ass. I want to love this little abomination because it's the closest thing to a game that lets me be a cartographer but I just can't, not now. maybe they will fix it in the future, it has potential, it has cool ships. It has sailing, many games that should have sailing actually lack it or don't do it right, this game does sailing, including some of the navigation tools, right. The graphics seem good enough to me, I don't know what other people are talking about in that regard but the game still sucks.

Edit: I take back what i said about the game having a weird map. It's actually a good mapping system, especially if you want to play a game as a cartographer. That one was my fault, I just needed to learn it.",1483244714,1483314943,False,8,4,0.456194251775741577,4,True,False,True,False,,,

Pros:
- Beautiful scenery. Especially during the dawn and sunset.
- The night sky is wonderful.
- Use compass and sextant for navigation is an exciting thing.

Cons:
- Game often crash.
- The kinds of craft materials are so limited.
- Too few craft options.
- Most of objects on the ground are decorations. The player can't cut trees or build a house.
- The enemy AI is stupid. They will run straight to player or stuck in somewhere.
- Many other bugs.

---------------------------------

For the official version:
I spent a lot of hours to explore a large island. Then I saved game at beach. When I reload it, game crashed suddenly. It looks like my save file was broken. Save system still unstable.

Vegetative cover of distant islands will not disappear in time. I think this is the main reason.

To dev:
Maybe it's a little harder for your team to make a normal stable game? I don't need a very good sandbox game as excellent as Terraria or Force of Nature.

You start the game on your home island, where you can find a few resources and sail away on your little raft to distanc islands you can see in the horisont..
The game is quite nice, and the sailing is relaxing and a nice experience, though I look very much forward exchanging my little raft with the big ship someday ( a long time away it require so many resources ).

But as you visit island again and again you find various resources from rock to shooting down apples from the tree with your bow and arrow. You will also encounter pirates you can kill and traders that can sell you important things such as a navigation machine so you with 100 gurantee can mark your new island on the map and navigate much more easy. You see in the start you really have nothing not even a compass.

Along the way you will also be able to hunt wildlife and get different quest.
The game is in early access and so far it look pretty good but hope there will be much more content in the future.
All in all a nice ""little"" open world game.
I would say get the game on sale.

Went to 5 islands, saw nothing at all interesting. Pirates or savages or whatever you want to call them, all look the same, attack in the same manner and damage you whether you block their attacks or not. They attack you with an axe even though you're apparently not allowed to take it or even make your own. You're not allowed to cut down trees because I guess that would make the game ""too realistic or easy"" or some stupid reason. Instead, you run around like an idiot looking for rare logs on the ground and rare plant fibers and hit specific types of something rare that apparently supposed to be a boulder of some sort and get a single stone from it and maybe a single flint too, and of course, the boulder stays there looking exactly the same, but you can't hit it anymore. On rare occasions, there's a single fruit up in a tree which you can knock down with a club, even though realistically there would be hundreds or none at all depending on the seasons. There's what appears to be only 1 animal in the game and 1 pirate enemy, maybe there's more, but with the graphics detail being so horrible, can you blame me for not being able to tell? It feels like you're flying quickly in outer space at night while sailing in the empty ocean since there's giant white particles moving past you. The bow and combat mechanics are laughable, you cannot hit a moving target with the bow as it just seems to fly right through the deer which btw, you can run just as fast as them. The islands are tiny, empty and look all the same, there's no sense of realism anywhere in the game. For instance, you can find a hut with lit torches on the outside and equipment inside... no bodies or anyone anywhere on the island, but somehow those torches are still lit. You can't remove the torches either, but you can conveniently grab a bunch of the valuable stuff inside, because no one else could possibly have seen that well lit hut on the very top of the island acting as a lighthouse. And of course, you can't dismantle the hut (or anything for that matter) to re-use the wood. This game offers the most minimalistic amount of content possible even though it's been on Steam for over 2 years and somehow managed to get Very Positive ratings which is really disturbing. It has so much less content than Stranded Deep and yet the gameplay is nearly identical in so many ways, aside from the fact that Stranded Deep actually looks so much better. But, even though the gameplay is nearly identical, one could maybe say they can't be compared simply because that's how far behind Salt is, yet they're both priced the same and both in development, or at least that's the claims.

Ok, so you can make a large ship and set sail (somehow, even though realistic ships require a crew of ppl to manage), the amount of boring and tedious grunt work of fetching stuff on the ground isn't at all worth it. I'm not going to spend dozens of hours, if not more, just so I can make a ship for no reason... or maybe there might be a pirate ship out there you can attack or something... whatever, it isn't worth it at all cuz I'm sure that will be minimalistic and terrible too.

- Graphics are terrible, reminds me of the 90s
- Sounds are minimalistic
- Content is minimalistic
- Replayability is barely there in my opinion

Pas vraiment un moins mais les graphismes tr√®s simplistes peuvent aussi d√©courager certains joueurs.

As others have said, it is relaxing and atmospheric. It can get kinda tense during some battles. When I started off, it was a toss-up whether I'd survive a 1-on-1 fight with another pirate. Now I have picked up/made some better gear and I can take on two regular pirates just fine, even a regular pirate and a more difficult pirate (cartographer, battlemaster, etc). However, I cannot yet kill or survive a fight with a pirate captain, so there is more for me to still do even though I've played the game for 14+hrs at this point. There are more boats for me to get, and having read some of the wiki for the game I see there are more difficult fights to come. 

The game is a lot of fun, I always wonder what I will find on the next island. I think the way they did the map (do it yourself manually based on what you have encountered, just like a pirate would have done historically) was a great idea.

Der Fokus der Entwickler liegt klar auf dem Gameplay und nicht auf der Grafik, dar√ºber sollte man sich im Klaren sein bevor man das Spiel kauft. Das Craftingsystem ist simpel, erf√ºllt seinen Zweck aber voll und ganz. Trotz des fr√ºhen Entwicklungsstadiums wurde ich bisher noch nie mit Spielfehlern konfrontiert. Nach 30 Stunden Spielzeit habe ich auch noch lange nicht alles Entdeckt was die Welt an Besonderheiten und Items zu bieten hat. Hinzu kommt, dass die Entwickler darum bem√ºht sind weitere Inhalte einzuf√ºgen und sich dabei auch an den W√ºnschen der Community orientieren. 
Ich pers√∂nlich kann das Spiel voll und ganz empfehlen, da meine Erwartungen an Salt erf√ºllt wurden. Um Entt√§uschungen vorzubeugen w√ºrde ich zum Antesten der kostenlosen Demo vor dem Kauf raten. Die Demo vermittelt einen guten ersten Eindruck vom Gameplay und der Spielstand wird beim Kauf des vollen Spiels √ºbernommen!

I paid ¬£10.99 and feel a bit ripped off as I'm spending most of the game walking back and forth but finding very little resource.  It feels less and less enjoyable the longer you go on because it becomes so much a grind.  I honestly thought once I bought the game after playing the demo that this would get better and lots more would become unlocked but it feels more or less the same.  I feel like all the islands are basically the same - I can forgive the low end graphics if the gameplay was exceptional, but at this stage I just feel like I'm not getting my money's worth.

Some parts of the game make no sense as an exploration and crafting game;

- The islands are covered in trees...yet you can't harvest them.  Your only source of wood is random logs that can be found over the islands, however they are FEW and far between.  I spent near two hours looking for seven logs to repair a raft just to get off the first island.  Luckily you can't die of starvation.

- Plenty of bamboo in abundance...no way to harvest that either, unfortunately...the only way to harvest it is to run through groves of it, if you're lucky you'll find one piece of every five or ten minutes of running.

- It feels like there's not much to do other than wander desperately looking for the meagre supplies there are, which is great for explorers, but rubbish for people who want to do some crafting, killing, questing, etc.  

- I realise this is supposed to be in the middle of nowhere at all but so far, I've only happened upon one quest and one merchant and I think I have about five hours if not more in so far...it feels very empty and barren.  I haven't seen any pirates for an hour and a half...

- It takes so long to down deer, and it takes so much chasing of them, it gets rather tedious and unfortunately you need deer hide to make any kind of armor.  If you're using a bow to kill your deer, you're wasting a lot of resources as you can go through 30 arrows just killing one deer, and only a few will be found again or recovered.

The only thing  the game really has going for it is that it's still in development so it could have better features in future versions:  it definitely needs far more resources and far more to build and do.  Exploration can only take up so much time when everything looks more or less the same and you have to walk round in circles just to get two bits of wood and a few bits of fiber...I can't honestly say ¬£10.99 is value for money here right now, perhaps in future.

I will also add, that while they did a good job with what they had to work with graphically, there isn't anything graphically impressive here. That may be an issue for some, although it never took away from the experience for me.

Do you like games about pirates? Do you like realistic sailing simulators? Do you like games with epic first person battles like Minecraft and Skyrim:The Elder Scrolls V? Than this game is for you! Salt has all of the above! Ignore all the reviews saying ""This game has bad graphics"" and ""This game's exploration element is not good enough for me"". Salt has pretty good combat, very realistic sailing elements, a storyline, tons of different equipment to collect, epic boss battles,  frequent updates, and awesome exploration! The only thing I would add are enemy ships so there would be ship battles, and sharks so you would have something to worry about while swimming.
EDIT: It's guaranteed I'll nominate this for at least something every Steam Awards event, because this game is just... so... perfect. Well, maybe not perfect, but overwhelmingly amazing.
It just has everything! Epic music, combat, story, ship sailing, and environmental beauty.

And there's pirates!

Long version- I bought this game on Steam for only $7 and I feel like I have ripped the devs off. Granted, it was on Sale ( reduced price for a certain time) but from what I have seen I would gladly pay upwards of $20.

Salt is not a game that easily fits into a genre; It's ""survival"" in that you start with zero; all killable enemies have a chance to drop items that are normal ( white letters), good quality ( green), exceptional ( blue).  *Note* I'm sure there are higher ""level"" items but I'm only 8 hours in at this writing. There is also crafting..but no pre-set ""recipes"" ( ie you have to either experiment or find books that describe what you can make.)

Salt is all about exploring. The World ( as far as I understand) in bascially endless; think Mindcraft random chunk loading but islands of various sizes instead of terrain.

I have to assume the farther one goes out from one's ""spawn"" point the more difficult the game gets? Time will tell.

The game is in Early Development but is very polished as far as gameplay. I have encountered no game-breaking bugs as of yet.

It may only be my advancing age but....I did notice a bit of a learning curve as far as some aspects of the game. The world is huge....and you have no map...unless YOU make a map.

Learning the system of map-making ( for me) was a frustrating time but when I finally "" got it"" I could see what the devs wanted to do with it. Overall ( now at least) I think it very clever indeed.

I asked questions on the official forums and got only helpful replies; the community seems mature and growing.

Oh! and there's fishing!


  ** Edit as of Oct 30, 2016**

 This game is amazing but ( there is always a but isn't there?) I have a feeling it will not appeal to many players of the inta-gratification bend; the play is SLOW.  You gather equipment in order to fight tougher enemies SLOW;  travel is SLOW....VERY slow; there is no tutorial as such and I do wish there was.

 Salt is all about taking your TIME......exploring! Wanting to see what's over the next horizon. You ""level up"" by carefully gathering and equiping a motly assortment of gear. Having ALL the gear in a ""set"" should be a priority as it tends to give much needed stat boosts.

 Also, to add a bit to what I wrote previously; there ARE higher ""grades"" of equipment- they are- White ( normal), Green ( good), Blue ( exceptional), Purple ( epic!) and Orange ( awesome!)

 The fact that mobs can ""drop"" really sweet items keeps an old RPGer like me going..

  Add to all this the fact that Salt is STILL being updated- it's mind-blowing!

PRO
-cute artstyle
-still being updated
-pretty cheap

CON
-I feel as though looking for opjects is a chore, it just seems so tedious when you're looking around the same, small island looking for a pickaxe so you can actually leave said island, I'm not sure if it's the folliage or what, but finding items in the world is just annoying instead of being fun.
-The game runs, not well, to say the least.
-I understand that the selling point of this game is that you can just putter about on your own, but it's so easy to sail around and never come accross anything or anyone that actually improves or changes what's going on in the game.

If you enjoy a relaxing, calming, fulfilling evening, try out Salt. It's focus and charm is it's exploration aspect, in which you can explore an endless-ish ocean.

     It [u]could be fun[/u]...don't get me wrong here this could be a great game but it needs a lot of improvement before being a game worthy to be bought. At this moment you may see that I dont have a lot of hours into this game and thats due to the fact that I this game does not keep my attention. So for people who do not want to read my review then i give it a [b]4 or 5/10[/b]
   
     Okay so to start off lets talk about starting a new game. This game has a [u]painfully slow start and currently can't seem to hold my attention for too long[/u] before I want to play another game. So then why you ask is it a painful slow start? Well the problem actually lies with one of the core machanics in the game the exploration. In this game there are [u]lots to see [/u] and a lot of room to [u]sail, [b]enlessly[/b] not finding anyhting of worth[/u] the reason i know this is my friend owns this game and I watched him play, he played the game for about 10 or so hours and found [u][b]1[/b] thing worth his time in those [b]10[/b] hours of play.[/u] 

     So lets do a bit of comparing to game that require a lot of exploration, say minecraft, lets talk about the exploration in minecraft. In Minecraft my first 10 or so hours, back when it was still in alpha, I found tonns of monsters, made cool equipment, found cool looking places and all the while not wishing I was playing another game. So the reason I compared these two games is because I am comparing a core aspect of each game, the exploration, now I know that they are seperate games and its not right to compare them but the reason I did was to be able to show how slow the progression really is. Other than upgrading to a new sword and meeting 1 npc I went to about 20 or so islands and found really nothing to do and that where I pretty much stopped playing. The game needs more variety of enemies and more reason to actually want to play. Other than combat, that is where the compaison ends this game seems to lack content and that is needed to make a good game. Yes I know this game is stil in alpha and could change, but right know this is the dead honest truth this game needs more to do early game to grab and hold peoples attention. 

     Okay so know thats thats over lets talk about combat. So as I said earlier this game has a very similar combat to minecraft and I think presently there is nothing wrong with the current system and thats where most of my 4 or 5/10 comes from. A few small tweeks and small things like dual wielding( please correct me here if I am wrong) and hopefully the devs will smooth out the kinks but nontheless it works.  

     The A.I are kinda wonky and seem to be able to do 2 thing and thats just chase you and attack you or just aimlessley wander around. They also dont have any attack patterns or anything of note as far as I could see.

     Sailing of the ships are great and its rather fun(kinda reminds me of The legend of Zelda: windwaker). The controls are smooth and inuitive and can lead to some intersting but wonkey ways to get unstuck from islands. The only problem I did not notice much difference between the ships(again please correct me here if I am wrong) some of the shisp are huge and the only difference seems to be just the looks/size. and it kinda seems wonkey to me that 1 guy can control a huge ship like those, which brings me to my next topic.

     The world feels [b]empty[/b]. There are hardly no npc aside form the odd tavern and map guy but it just seems liek a huge waste of space. I know that there is people who will say that this is a good thing but I do not. I say this because in games liek this where you sail around and creat cool stuff and fight off badguys it just seems so lonely to do it alone. This game would benifit greatly with the ability to hire npc to come on voyages with you(correct me if I am wrong). also it would be really nice to have a multiplayer mode for this game, the abiltiy to romp around with your friends would be a boon for this kind of game, I know that some of you disagree so whatever floats your boat!

     Alright now that we covered the most important aspects of this game lets get down to the pros of this game because lets face it, its just down right rude to crap ona game and not say its good parts!

Pros:
[list]
    [*] Early Access
        This is a possitive due to the fact that the devs can fix the mistakes they made in their game and I hope to god they     don't just dump this game.
    [*] Tonns of potential
        This game screams to me that it [u][b]could[/b][/u] be the next minecraft with boat loads to do and see, fun battles to be had, lots of crafting to do and materials to collect.
    [*] Combat
        It has a solid combat foundation to work with all it needs is some to add some spices and not just salt to flavor it.
    [*] Procedural Generation
        Alright, with these kind of game this needed to actually warrent playing the game, but its still a good thing.
        
[/list]

     So after some terrible puns you see my list of pros and you read the reasons I gave it what I did. At this time I cannot recommend this game but thats not saying that it wont change and if any at time I made a mistake and said something wrong, I am sorry, just let me know and I will change it. I will try to update this as the game gets closer to a full release

ps. Sorry for some of the grammar and spelling mistakes . Cheers!",1469774573,1469775041,False,11,0,0.389176070690155029,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It's not really my cup of tea, but I'm fine having it.  It's playable, you can get into it.  It's really not bad at all.  Relaxing even.  Real pretty.  Pirates to fight.  Islands to explore.  It's fine the way it is, I think.  Updates keep happening, few and far between.  It's worth the money.  You will probably enjoy this game, even for a little while.  I haven't played it in a while, but I do peek at it to see what the devs are doing with it.  Just added a new boss, probably added some new loot.  I know they just added a new place to explore.  It's decent.

My only qualm is, after you get a big boat, and a good bit of gold...  Learn to map the sea, and get yourself a decent sword and bow.  There's little else to do.  Fight pirates.  No naval battles, you have to get out of your boat and go look for a fight.  

This game is cute.  All I can say.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, but not to every body.  

There's not much of a survival system.  You can eat, but you don't have to eat.  Food is hard to come by, not even needed.  I'm not sure what the point of this game is, really.

It is primarily one thing: A game representation of a board game, where you have to roleplay outside of the game, writing your own notes and making your own setting as to why you are sailing around and finding joy in the quests you may encounter (or non active NPC's).

Not the game it appears from the store front to be nor the game I believe you in most cases really want. It presents a world that at a distance look decent, but up close is a glitch mess. It shows that the focus of the game is on pushing out stuff fast, rather than actually making each element work and interesting. 
A bunch of examples: 
It will often be better to repeatedly die if you have a location close with good stuff, as the stuff in chests will respawn and you keep your inventory, thus allowing you to gain more items. 

If you want to buy the items you need from a shop, good luck. It appears random if the shop even has items and usually the items are fairly expensive requiring you to either play for long stretches of time (usually gaining any items you need that way, making the shop pointless) or to purposely glitch to game in order to gain gold caster (like repeatedly dying, thus resetting the world).

Running out of food has no effect... which is good, as gaining food is utterly random.

Mine a rock, get the materials... then look back as the rock stays, but becomes a floating object you can walk right through. 

Want to build something? Believe this is slightly like Minecraft given the art style and tool choices? You are wrong, you can craft a fair number of things, weapons or objects, but as a good chunk is locked to different tiers, it will once again be rather random if you can or need to craft anything other than the boat. You can easily encounter a situationen where you have 50+ of each item you need to craft a specific weapon, and then spent countless hours never finding the final piece you need. Besides; just go to the stranded ship (there should always be one), loot the chest in it and get the bow + arrows. Die and repeat a few times and you have a weapon that in many cases can one-shot kill with a headshot (and you can collect the arrows again) (Its been noted that it respawning items in that chest might be glitch for me only). 

It features a rather awful FoV, combat is ludicrous simple and requires just one thing: Aim for the head. 

Want to find where you are? You have to make certain you mark everything down on your map, and as mentioned take notes. However while that could be an interesting idea for those prepared to do so, it once again misses its mark as you really should have some more interesting islands with features you can recognise from a distance to truly be able to feel like you are navigating in a world, where you make the map so to speak. As the map is generated from a seed, this isn't happening so far.

Pirates... Well there is ships.. and islands.. But its not really pirates. Its enemies that vaguely look like pirates and with weapons named something like: Pirate's Axe. That does not a pirate game make. Where is the drinking, the sounds of pirates.. ship battles, cutlasses swung in desperation? Well, matey.. not in this game.

Personally that is not for me, and I found the most joy (minor) in reading the ingame books. Put a hold on you purchase and wait until the various features currently in the game, is actually finished and integrated properly would be my recommendation, and even then be sure you want to buy the game for what it is, and that you are not looking for a pirate RPG, with a twist of minecraft.

Still they have a demo and I highly recommend trying that out first before making any purchase - and play that demo with a focus on: Would I really repeatedly play this, on my own in this game - knowing that besides more islands with random stuff on, there is nothing more to do?",1469458436,1469581924,False,5,0,0.434533655643463135,3,True,False,True,False,,,

I wish there were a few more ship types that players could craft using common materials rather than quest rewards for more variety early game, also the game lags a bit while approaching islands as it loads however this is minor and could be related to settings. Well worth a buy, very playable in its current state.

Now 80+ hours in and I've experienced a lot of the major in-game events. I have not finished the main quest line but I've done quite a few of the side quests and explored over 650 islands. I quite enjoy the exploring aspect of the game so I'm in no rush to fight the end boss just yet. I felt guilty about getting this game on sale for so cheap so I bought a full price copy to give away.

First I got the starting stuff after reading those books in your inventory. I also found that pickaxe the book that one dude had on him talked about.

Then I wandered around for a while before seeing the logs on the ground to make a boat.

Make Boat. Place Boat. Proceed to crash boat into island.

I pushed the boat back into the sea and got on it and sailed for adventure!

I went onto another island and found a dude that wanted maps. Considering I didn't have maps, he was useless so I tried to stab him. Sadly, I could not stab him. Fuck invincible cartographers.

So then I sailed onwards, this time going a farther distance until something caught my eye.

Some victorious music played as I saw a campfire! I went to the island to see what he was all about.

Apparently there was some treasure he wanted, but couldn't find. So I walked about 30 feet from him and found an X. How bad can your leg be to not walk 30 feet. I dug up the treasure and decided to give it to him because he didn't try to kill me. He gave me a neat little lantern to put on my boat! I named it Jim.

Onwards again, Jim and I sailed. We saw another smoke pillar in the distance and decided to sail for it. Maybe they are nice too?

Wrong. I went on the island and got chased down by a nasty pirate! I sliced him up real good and looted his body. Then I went to explore more, when there was a sneaky pirate waiting for me!

I started to attack the evil fiend when I noticed that my HP was low! This was the end of my adventure for sure, but I wasn't going down without a fight! In my dying breath I swung my sword and took down the pirate with me. Jim may never be found ever again.

10/10 would avenge myself again.

Update: I have teleported to my boat and retrieved Jim.",1467320301,1467365430,True,33,64,0.665499866008758545,1,True,False,True,False,,,

The boats are very cool a little wired at first too but are fun to sail with especially when ya get the big pirate ship that i just found yesterday and start trying to navigate it XD and is the only thing you can use as a home that can be customize at the moment till they had crafting for houses and settlements.
Combat is ok and fun a little dull but better then most early access games iv played and works well but needs just a little more optimizing to be even better.

The sounds are just a bit repetitive but relaxing at the same time between the birds and the ocean. 

There's only really dear to hunt at the moment but they plane to add more in till then its just nice to have dear. 

Last but not least the art style of the game the water and the trees is very beautiful to me it very beautiful to look at and with a very practical pc with a I3 or higher with at least intell HD graphics 6000 or higher with it set on medium graphics at 800x600 with the other in-game settings up high it still looks very beautiful.

Game is not made by professional artists. They can not even cut and paste simple plants from google image search. Everything has a white outline of pixels becuse they did not want to cut the plats out by hand, they use a selector tool and just called it a day.

Combat is a fricking joke... After you are dead, you can still sit there and kill off a few pirates before it respawns you.

Pirates come at you with axes, yet you an not loot said axe, nor can you loot their clothes for cloth.

The modeling is done by a young child it seems. Everything is glued together primatives, with child like textures scribbled in crayon.

No music.....

Thee only thing it has going for it is that it is endless.... i still have not found anything worthy of mention.  There are a few houses scattered about but no real villages.

No castles to explore, no caves..... nothing except floating from island to island endlessly looking for loot.

Underwater is completely void of anything living, or any decoratons for that matter.

This game has changed so much since the beginning of early access.  There are quests, boss fights, the ship models have been redone (and are MASSIVE compared to the old models), and the characters have unique designs now.  When the game was first introduced, NPCs looked like gingerbread men. 

This is essentially the pirate version of No Man's Sky.  You won't be finding insane aliens, but you never know what you will find on an island.

After a while they become repetitive and you can see the patterns on how they're generated, but the creator is pretty good at adding new content to spice it up.

This is a great game to play when stressed out or overworked.  You don't need to worry about death or starving, you keep all your loot and hunger is just a buff to your health and stamina.  It isn't really a survival game, it's all about exploring and mapping where you've been.

Speaking of maps, the most recent update finally added the ability to create your own map, as well as journal entries.  Set sail and write about your adventure!

Pros:
-Massive sense of scale.  I don't know if the map is infinite, but so far it seems like it
-cute designs on the NPCs
-great sense of exploration
-rewarding combat (learn to use traps, parry, and use the terrain!)
-repairing an Old Pirate Ship or crafting a massive ship after using a dinghy or raft is a great feeling of accomplishment

Early Access Cons - stuff that's wrong for now but will hopefully be resolved:
-A few bugs, but it's still EA.  The cartographer NPC can spawn below the tideline and just stand there as the tide washes over his head, for example.
-NPC enemies can be OP at first, meaning the only way to beat them is to trick the game into getting them to stand still or run away by jumping to and from the edge of the water.
-While there are quite a few island types, it could use more
-ships appear to have cannon ports, but there are no gunpowder based weapons of any kind.  Not sure if this is to be changed.

Neutral:
-No multiplayer.  Not sure if this is a pro or con.  Pro because it's nice and quiet, a good way to escape, con because this would be a great way to explore with friends.  Especially since ships are so massive
-No wind direction.  Makes sailing awkward when you can sail full speed in any direction, but if there was wind direction you'd be tied to the wind...

Are there games that do what Salt does better?  Probably.  But it's the sailing and the feeling of just how stranded you are in this seemingly endless world that is filled with ocean.

I suggest to watch some gameplay footage before you buy, the graphical style might not be for everyone.
I also dont think the price is yet justified, its still early access, but so far it does not have that much content. You need to get some food and resources, but it wont take long till you have quite a stockpile of both and not that much to do with it.
After some treasures and some ancient islands you also have gear and barely find any upgrades for it. 
You need some ressources to get the pirate ship going and than you can travel the world for pieces to get a better ship. But once thats done thats basicly it. 
Some more items, some more endgame, maybe more ship improvements, more things to discover, some more content is lacking right now.

The sailing part is nice, though i also hope for some more options and variations. It always feels the same in the game, some different weather / sea behaviour would be nice. Storms or rather calm sea, sail variations for different speed would be nice additions.

In all seriousness. I have put off putting a review up because of several missing items from the game. Now that they have added in the journal and map, I can happily make a decent review for this game.

I will give this game, at its current, a 7/10.

For an early access game it provides plenty of game time that is completely sandbox and is no way linear whatsoever. The graphics are retroy like, and I like that. The combat mechanics do need some work. Archery in the game could be tweaked a bit and guns need to be added in. I mean it is a pirate game, there needs to be guns. There is also the lack of multiplayer, but hey, they said they will add it in eventually and I am a patient person.

Answer was: if I consider time spent in a flow of having fun and relaxation a loss, then ""yes!"" :)

After playing the free! DEMO! for more than 8 hours, I clearly had to buy the full game. Just to show my appreciation to the developers for both: the opportunity to try out the game for free before buying into EA and their great work with this amazing piece of exploration game.

It clearly is a pearl and worth every cent I spent (I didn't even wait for any sale, this game deserves what the devs currently charge for). If you are the explorer type of gamer, you will find this ""sailing-simulator"" worth its salt ;)

And if you are not sure: just try the free demo (it is the same game, just only the isles in your starter area spawn, so exploration is limited) - but for me it was enough to experience the soul inside the game.

I think it's because I still play LoZ : Wind Waker on the GameCube but what can I say, I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff.

NOW FOR THE REAL REVIEW, Please note I have not done everything or collected everything this game has to offer, I will update my review the way I see fit as new content arrives.

Pros
-Excellent Lighting and Colour Pallette.
-Smooth Sailing. (your ship sails over the rising and falling seas)
-Crafting system that requires either trial and error, a book, or a wiki. (I don't like ones that tell you immediately what you'll need and make the resources rarer to compensate)
-Tons of lore, loot, and quests to complete. (and apparently now a story)
-Good variety of items, ships, and environments.
-old school tools for location finding.

now the things that should make this game a negative review

Cons
-the combat system still needs some kinks worked out. (It's mostly either shoot while backpedal or hit, run to the water, heal, repeat)
-no NPC ships or ship combat. (Boats and rafts are impervious fortresses that are never attacked by pirates, GET ON THIS PLS)
-no guns. (around the era this game is going for, muskets have been around for a long time)
-no wind system. (ships are the same speed in any direction)
-no risk/reward for getting bigger ships. (if a ship you repaired gets stuck you can respawn it right next to you which is fine, but if you leave a ship anchored at an island, you can spawn it miles away, for small ships I don't care)
-not many different types of NPCs. (bounty/wanted system would be cool, 3 main types of NPC, Shop owner, Inn owner, bad guys who KOS)
-not much progression in terms of crafting.

All in all I like this game, however many more people may not, I reviewed positive because I personal would suggest other people explore this world which is really fun to explore. Maybe they should market it as an exploration game with RPG elements.

I know this game is early access, but there just isn't a lot of things to build or do.  There are only a handful of boats to build at this point, and the bigger boats aren't that cool.  You can go faster, but it is harder to see where you're going.  I found myself ditching my boats all the time and building new ones.  Once you make a boat once, you can make it again without using any materials, but it just seemed silly to ditch boats and make new ones only because it is easier than turning boats around or traveling back to where you left them.  It would be a lot better if the bigger boats had some cooler featuers that went along with them which you could customize more and there was an incentive to keep them.

Overall, the graphics are pretty bad.  I'm not someone that normally worries too much about that, but they seemed particularly bad on this game.  

I ran out of things to build and I'm less than 15 hours into the game.  I kept collecting all kinds of materials thinking I was going to find some recipes to build cool stuff.

I seemed to spend a ton of time collecting stuff that really wasn't good for anything.

I don't usually write reviews, [i] said everyone writing Steam reviews. [i]
I really like games that do something well. That special something, so to speak. The Soulsborne games have perfectly-tuned, responsive combat, and JC3 is all those kickass cutscenes you wish other games would let you play.
Well, Salt has some of the most amazing exploration of any game I've ever tried. Sure, it doesn't have that moment-to-moment tension in something like RE4, or the feeling of 1:1 recreation TW3 has, but the feeling of quite simply being [i] free [i] (more on that later) is unparalelled.
It's not a complicated game. It's simple in its ""Hey, you haven't eaten in two days, have an apple"" survival mentality, and its ""Y'know, you could just do this quest to get this one material"" crafting mentality. Despite player-aid features ranging from bare-bones to not-implemented, the friendly community and ample player-created resources are easy to get through and easy to work with, and immersive ways of keeping tabs on your location and quests are coming soon, according to the (very active) devs.
Now, don't mistake this simplicity for ease. This is not an easy game. It's no Super Meat Boy, but, at least until you figure out what you're doing, it will keep you on your toes. From trying to find a merchant, through brief (and responsive) combat sections, to realizing you're lost at sea and have no clue where you are in reference to islands and landmarks.
See, this is where I think the game both shines and drags itself down. Essentially, Salt is a hypothetically endless (its content may or may not be finite, there's just so much of it there's really no difference to a human player) first-person Wind-Waker-meets-Skyrim-meets-Latest-Survival-Game-on-Early-Access. The only ""point"" of the game is to get nicer gear, harder/better/faster/stronger ships, and shinier decorations, through two core gameplay loops somewhat like this:
[olist]
    [*]Sail to an island
    [*]Depending on what type of island, collect all the things/kill all the enemies/repair derelict ship/etc
    [*]Put loot to good use
    [*]Profit
[/olist]
Or
[olist]
    [*]Sail to an island
    [*]Receive quest
    [*]Complete quest by sailing to location and collecting X amount of Y (and possibly Z, A, B, and C) item/killing X (possibly Y and Z) enemy/find X NPC
    [*]Return to quest giver to receive reward
    [*]Profit
[/olist]
It's relatively grindy, but I personally find the gameplay well-tuned and very enjoyable, from the amazingly weighty and relatively simple almost-two-button sailing to one of the best first-person combat systems I've ever tried. The acquisition of gear, materials, gold, and ships fills a particularly under-filled niche in my gaming desires, and the fact that the game looks so nice only makes it better.
And don't believe the screenshots, because it does look [i] very [i] nice. The not-quite-cel=shaded lo-fi & low-poly graphics style is relatively easy on the hardware, but even when not turned up all the way still looks gorgeous. The colors pop in all the right places and, along with very tasteful placement of landmarks, make it easy to distinguish between the different types of islands, all with their unique features.
At the end of the day, Salt is still not a finished product. Little stutters and a few places that lack optimization (as well as a somewhat underwhelming options menu and little-to-no anti-aliasing) make that very apparent technically, and to a casual player the all-but-nonexistent beginner help in-game (there's a little more of it in the testing branch as of 3/5/16 than in the main release) may be offputting. But all the things that keep Salt from being an amazing game, rather than a really really great one are all things that will be fixed as it moves out of Early Access into being a full release. As is, it is better than a staggering majority of Early Access games by a very large margin (hell, it works, so that's better than 90% of them), and better than many full-price AAA releases *cough* SF5 *cough*.
Best of all? It's $14.99. If you're at all interested, there's no excuse to not try at least the demo.",1457236652,1457321769,True,20,1,0.607087910175323486,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Just a couple of months ago it was fully released, which none of us were expecting. It was a nice little game, with a great concept and what looked like a good future with the release of co-op and bug fixes. But then it was fully released? And only updated twice afterwards? Its like the devs cared about a project, put almost all of their efforts into it, then rushed it out and put a cherry on top and called it done? Salt has a great concept, but with all great concepts, they require a great way to play it well. Salt does not.

Salt is full of fetch quests. Nevermind that, Salt is entirely fetch quests. The main quest is constantly sending you back and forth, with a half-@ssed hunger bar giving you a pain in the @ss, and low-tier combat with poorly designed dodge and block mechanics. There is no skill, the most you can do is take 80% damage, kill one or two pirates (Which might I add all the enemies are complete bullet-sponge type enemies) Then run back to the ocean, heal for a minute, and repeat. The games time is stretched out not because of a surplus of side-quests and things to do, but because of how unneedingly large the ocean is. The ocean isn't large compared to other games, but it feels large because of how slow your ships are. The best ships barely even cut the speed in half, and it still takes forever. Added with a poorly made cartographic system and map you have a broken boring piece of sh!t with nothing to do. 

And that's another thing, this game is BORING. 90% of game time will be trying to figure out what-the-f!ck-to-do next, or slowly sailing across the empty and void of life seas, and the only way to make it a little less dead would to have a ""Treasure Grabber"" and a fishing rod. You never see the fish in the water, because there is nothing in the water. They should rename the game to the Dead Sea because it would define the gameplay pretty literally without needing to say much else. Islands are either too small or too huge, pirates tend to be mile-long distances from eachother when trying to clear an island, combined with the again boring combat, you have a pretty slow, and uninteresting experience.

This game was made to be taken with a grain of salt. The only thing leaving it from not being dead are the pyschos who credit this game for ""Freedom"" and ""There is so much to do."" and ""The main quest was 21.5 hours!!"" and ""Im 30 hours in and still not done yet."" Here I am to discredit all of them; There is so LITTLE to do within quests, and so  much time to travel between them, thats why the main quest is 21.5 hours. If I broke it down the main quest without the bullsh!t travelling times it'd be 3-4 hours. It is nothing but fetch quests, the only thing you aren't done yet is blowing your brains out like me.

Bad bits;
-not a great deal to do on islands
-bugs (a lot of them) 
-world seems fairly empty
-combat with swords is not very good
-no base building 
-very laggy
-not many animals on islands, I only found deer, spider and tiger so far
 
Good points;
-very relaxing
-collect lots of different objects to make armour, tools, weapons etc
-can go fishing
-can have your own ship to sail

The negative outways the positive at the moment but with more content being added in the future it could be very good.

I like the concept, but honestly find myself diappointed at this stage in development. 

I read reviews before buying this today stating things like ""I've been playing for over 50 hours and I still haven't found everything!"" Yet I feel like after close to two hours I've seen practically everything on every island in what is an infinitely procedurally generated game. The reason is that (with extremely rare exception) every island follows this formula:

-There is a beach
-The island is mostly a single steep grassy hill
-The hill is mostly covered with trees and bamboo and a few boulders


Here's what sets the majority of islands apart:

-Sometimes there are pirates who you cannot counter early on if you choose to fight them. 

([i]Side Note: Fighting more than one of them at once is impossible due to simplistic combat being combined with constant stamina drains, so no content is really added here other than you dying.[/i])

-Sometimes there is a deer that you can hunt. 

([i]Side Note: Why hunt it when you can hit the trees for fruit that doesn't run away from you constantly? It seems that if you can get close enough, stabbing a deer in the back with a sword takes off around 1/5th of its HP, at which point it doesn't even flinch, it just runs off with most of its health expecting you to repeat this long procedure of following it across then island then sneaking up on it again over and over again until it dies. You can find the means to craft arrows for a bow, however I have not been able to do this easily due to the resources I need for them not being very obviously attainable.[/i])

-On the starter island there are some starter items and a chest

-You will very rarely find a resource called hardwood logs lying around for use in some specific recipies. Finding these is entirely based on luck and it can take a tediously long time to obtain a decent amount of them as a result. 


When I first hopped onto my raft and started sailing I found the experience quite charming. The idea of exploring a bunch of islands and discovering the mysteries of the world seemed really intriguing yet also pleasantly peaceful. I had come to understand I'd find pirate islands and new crafting recipies for decorations and larger ships, and yet while I discovered most of these things the game has already begun to feel stagnant, almost like there is next to no chance that I will find anything new or interesting about another island desipte sailing between many of them. 

Maybe there is something out there on an island that is really exciting and different, but after playing for almost two straight hours I certainly didn't find it. Hopefully as development continues much more content and island variety will be added and I will be able to recommend this. Until then save your money. 


tl;dr, The concept is great, but as of writing the game gets repetitive fast. Can't recommend the game in it's current state but I would encourage people to keep an eye on Salts development if you like the genre.

Pros
- Exploring the ocean with no map holding your hand; besides the sextant and compas which really adds on to the immersion of the game.
- The addition of needing to eat is awesome it adds on to the survial aspects of the game
- The crafting though limited felt decent.
- The gameplay is smooth and I love the art style
Cons 
- NEEED'S MORE CRAFTING
- The ability to settle islands and be able to build more than just a campfire on islands
- I would like to have diffrient types of trees to cut down*Obviously with hardwood trees being more rare; instead of just going to an island to pick up logs. It feels lazy since other games have the ability to cut down tree's including the shit ones.
- Destructible terrain is also a must and instead of having boulders it would be nice to have mining with tons of more minerals adding on to the crafting of tools and other stuff which could expand on the crafting system.
- I get that this is not minecraft but seriously X marks the spot also feels lazy when you find treasure and if you add in a mining system you could have a chance of running in to dungeons and even random chests of treasue.
- More ships is also nice and even the ability to build ports and build your own big ships with the materials you gather.
- Islands cant just be everywhere like in stranded it needs to be rewarding when you find an island which could make better use of the compas. 
Overall I am having fun playing the game but I am giving it the thumb down because even though  I see a lot of pottential however what worries me is the lack of updates, the last update was a month ago and it feels like not enough was added which worries me the the developers have just given up. So dont just buy it.

I love [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/]Unturned[/url] but it's always felt very limited; you explore a map and that's it, there's no real need to keep surviving after that. I adore Minecraft, but it's too expansive in some ways and too easy in others. I have 500+ hours in Skyrim, and so much of that is exploring. Salt is the best of all of these games. It's been on my wishlist for a while, because I was immediately attracted to the concept of infinite places to explore, plus the crafting and travel and, unusually for one of these big survival crafting games, [i]no forced multiplayer[/i]. I'm one of those weirdos who plays MMOs and wants nothing to do with other players most of the time, especially if they're total strangers, so the fact that this game has started with single-player development is a huge bonus for me.

It's in early access, but it only feels like it a little bit. The sailing and loot in particular feel really fleshed out already, and seeing the beginnings of lore and plot are reassuring. It could really benefit from a wider array of enemies, I think, both aggressive and passive; I've been mostly resting at night, and all I've seen is two types of pirate (one way more common than the other) and deer (which do have rarer colorations). And a merchant, finally, but that's not an enemy. Even some non-interactive wildlife would make things better, like some of the birds I hear on the islands, or seagulls, or even insects flying or hopping or crawling around. It just doesn't feel as populated as it could just yet, and part of it NEEDS to feel unpopulated, because it's infinite deserted (or not) islands, but at the moment the average of two deer and 3-5 pirates on most islands just feels kind of empty and lacking. Where are the hunters whose hideouts I find sometimes? Where are the villagers from the little clusters of huts? (Unless those huts were built by the pirates who are found nearby, but what self-respecting pirate lives on land?)

On the technical side of things, Salt is great. The range of graphics settings is good, the graphics themselves are that fun mix of stylized minimalism and realistic things like water and sun glare, and while there are some issues with things having weird white outlines (it's only the generic plants that give plant fibers that have this problem for me) and strange over-lit places among trees, that's stuff that can be fixed down the road. The ambient sound is lovely and peaceful. The music, where it appears, is fairly sudden, but so far it's been for things like my first actual ship ride, and finding my first merchant. I'm amazed that a game with procedural generation and theoretically infinite maps is under 500MB, but I'm not an expert on how games are built (yet).

I really recommend this game if you like exploring and passive/low-effort resource collection. The devs are working on cartography as a priority, which I feel will just enhance the resemblance to Miasmata, but in all the best ways. A game featuring sailing as such a big part of gameplay really needs the accompanying maps and charts, so I'm really looking forward to that being in the game.",1454777525,1454777525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I'm not exagerating: In the last 3 weeks as soon as I had time, and even if I hadn't time, I played Salt manically.
This game have something that captured me. A feeling of freedom, adventure and wonder that I was searching for in many years.

I was not sure what to think about Salt when I initially played the DEMO. Since is an Early Access game, I had doubts about the quality and variety of the content that initially stopped me from buying the full game. I later choose to take the risk and I can assure you, as it is now, the game is already very rich in content. Just consider that in 58 hours I still hadn't discovered everything! The Developers are dedicated to their work and very active in the community.

The gameplay is pretty relaxing, but challenging and it is set up in an infinite seed-based generated world. The adventure start on a small island, where you can search for food, craft some tools and build your self a simple raft to explore the sea. As you procede, you can get better equipment by defeating pirates, dig up burried treasures, build beautiful ships, discover the truth about a secret cult, and much more!
Since the gameplay is nomadic, your boat is your home, and you can decorate it as you wish.

[h1]PRO:[/h1]

- Adventurous.
- Relaxing but challenging.
- Pirates.
- Anchestral and mysterious secrets.
- Beautiful ships to sail across an infinite world.
- Looting is satisfying.
- Good and friendly developers.
- Almost no bugs even if still in early access.
- Hours and hours of fun, and it's still in development.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- Inventory need some work. For now you can't organize items' order, so when you have many items it's pretty confusionary.
- Hunger is not challenging because you will find plenty of food.
- No multiplayer (But it's planned!).
- Can be addictive :P

Salt is one of the best game I have ever played, and I can't wait to see what next updates will add in.

Even due to the different visual style of the game it still looks gorgeous!
Aswell, you don't see these kind of games everyday and the idea behind it is as good as the final outcome.
I'm really enjoying the fact that this game is mainly about exploration and it gives you that magnificent feeling of freedom.

But we'll get to that.

Pros:
-enemies are hard, but not impossible, you just need to plan out a little before hand
-world seems almost infinite and wonderous
-even when everyone uses the default seed, no-one yet agrees upon a set map (randomness FTW!)

Con: 
-no built in map system.


Now, this game has a LOT going for it, except the graphics, which frankly if you base games on graphics, you never played any ""good-ol-games"" like this one. but the map thing almost breaks it for me.  now there is an app outside of the game for helping to map, but again, it is super imprecise and after you're done, you know know if that was 3 separate little islands, or one long 3x1 island.  The game does include a sexant and compass, or else mapping in gerenal would be impossible, but you can never be quite sure of the units (i'm asuming they are ""miles"" or ""knots"" or something), but many of the starter islands are so close together that when you map it out, it almost looks like the center of the map is one big continent.  If there was a skill where you could draw or craft a map and put it in your boat like many other items, and update it as you go, i would love it.  it would make keeping track of where i've been and where i need to go a breeze, instead of ""well i'm lost, lets go back to starter island (which BTW is never really at 0N-0E) and try to find where i was going.  

So i don't totally feel like i'm bashing on this amazing game, i'll talk about MANY of the positives.  The landscape is wonderous and varied.  No two islands are the same, and sometimes it even seems like some islands change when you return (or i'm just super lost again). Remember when Assassin's Creed said that it would be unlikely that you cold take on more than 1-2 enemies or else they'd wreck you and then it turned out an entire army couldn't do shit to you? well this game made good on their promise.  If you tackle 2-3 pirates (the low level ones) on that first island you swam to with nothing but your pickaxe, you're gonna have a REALLY bad time.  That's not to say they are impossible, you just have to kite them with your bow and then pick them off 1 by 1.  

Finding, looting, and repairing an old pirate ship makes you feel like a boss.  they don't require too many materials, but they do require you to totally loot 2-3 islands to get enough, and then find that ship again.  but when you do, sailing the seas is easier, you feel like you have an actual ship, and that the world just became your oyster to cut open and find all the juicy pearls. 

Inn's and Merchants, while being generic, have quests that have excellent stories and require you to find your own way through the world, none of this ""bad guy here, kill, give me his head"", it starts with a pirate stealing the inn keepers hat, then it grows into a cultist killing nightmare involving ancient moving statues and nighttime escapades. and the best part is, you have to find all this out on your own.  the inn keeper just says ""the pirates stole my hat, get it back"" and you have to go find which island it's on.

You gather resources, craft items, go hunting or fishing, fight pirates, search treasures and so on.

[u][b]What I like[/b][/u]

The highlight of Salt is definitely the different ships. Some of them can be crafted others require a certain quest.
You start with a basic sailing raft, repair an old pirate ship and finally build you own huge bark.

It takes some time to get access to the really big and fun ships but it's really worth it.
You'll just start feeling like a pirate sailing one of those heavy bulky things through the ocean.
It's even possible to customize your ship by placing beds, torches, chests etc.

Once you have a decent ship, it's time to explore the different randomly generated islands.
Depending on their type (desert, jungle, pirate township...) you can find different resources and NPCs.
Some of them are very small and others are huge including mountains and small pirate villages.

Salt has a very unique art style which may seem unrealitic and childish at first but it manages to generate beautiful flora and a very authentic island - caribbean atmosphere. Especially the lighting while sunset and sunrise is purely gorgeous.

[u][b]What I don't like[/b][/u]

The start is quite tough. There are basic information about crafting and controls but it's hard to master the first steps. You may want to watch/read some guides and look up the official Salt Wiki for details.
The game itself isn't complex once you've learned the basic mechanics.

It has some mild performance issues like FPS drops and stuttering.
In general the game needs a lot of GPU power if you don't turn down the grass and foliage details.
So you should have at least a good mid-range GPU to maintain a rather dense flora at 60 FPS.

The good news? It has a demo, so just try out how good it runs on your rig ;)

The demo is a good way of testing the game anyway but keep in mind that the real fun starts after its limitations.
So just check if it runs well enough and you like the art style. To really test the gameplay you should buy it.",1451922439,1451922439,True,5,1,0.573973655700683594,0,True,False,True,False,,,

If you expect constant quests, tense and fast paced combat, and/or generally aren't a patient gamer then this game probably isn't up your alley. However, if you are still interested then please read on.

Let me start with the good stuff:

-This game has captured a sense of wonder that I haven't experienced since Minecraft. With Windwaker style graphics, everything is visually appealing, and sailing to and from islands is somehow always exciting. Whenever I'm done exploring an island, I get giddy about the prospect of getting in my ship (you start with just a raft but can end up with a 3 mast behemoth) and sailing towards a new island or even just sailing without direction at all. 

-Though I mentioned a lack of constant quests, there are in fact a lot of quests in the game. The issue is that you'll have to do a fair bit of sailing to find merchants, innkeepers, and other quest givers. For me, this is actually a plus since the time inbetween quests really makes them seem special when you finally get one. The rewards don't let you down either. Just about everytime I've finished a quest I looked at my new item and said, ""OH SWEET!"" Even after 60 hours of playtime I am still aware of at least two quests I have yet to complete.

-Fishing is great. I know this may sound crazy but I have spent hours fishing in this game. The great visuals combined with the realistic rolling of the waves out in the open ocean make for a very peaceful experience. Fishing itself is simple, click once to cast and click again when you get a bite, but it's not the fishing mechanic that is exciting. It's the peace and quiet, and the something like 30 different things you can catch (its not always fish). I found some really interesting stuff out there.

-Ease of access. The game was super easy for me to get into and understand. The crafting system is pretty straightforward (you also start with a book of basic crafting recipes to get you going). It's a little hard to keep track of where you are going at first but I found a compass and sextant at about the time I actually started caring about where I was going so no problems there. 

The bad stuff:
- Combat. Combat at this point is rather uninspired as it consists mainly of standing toe-to-toe with enemies and hoping you beat them to death first. There are bows and arrows as well, and they do have different types of arrows which helps to spice things up. I've been lurking on the dev website however, and they say they aren't finished with combat yet so it should get more interesting as updates roll out. As of yet I have no reason not to trust the devs as updates seem to be regular and they listen to their community. 

-My other complaints are all things I've seen the devs address, such as the lack of weather (a planned but not yet implemented feature), and framerate drops on jungle islands (planned to be optimized). My complaints are basically that this game can't get out of early access fast enough!

So, if you enjoyed minecraft's sense of adventure and wonder and think you would enjoy sailing an endless world with lots of islands to epxlore, then I would definitely give this game a shot. Happy sailing!",1451871227,1451871283,True,15,3,0.690028846263885498,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- Every Island is different
- Looting is for sure valuable and pirates always protect their precious loot
- Pirates set up a good challenge
- Campfires heal you if you wait
- You can ""wait"" for hours or the next sunrise (like skyrim)

Of course there are some cons with the game as every Early Access Game does. Here is what I've come up with:
- Pirates can be a bit too tough, meaning make sure you have good armor and good strong weapons to destroy the pirates without dying immediately
- Pirates can also be in a group making it extremely difficult to avoid hits and survive for long.
- Valuable Resources can be very tedious obtaining and are rare

Well look no further..

In this game you play a pirate washed onto an island and after gather supplies to build a makeshift raft you are free to explore, kill and steal.

Pros:

+ TRUE total freedom to travel and explore
+ Building your own ship
+ Tons of crafting
+ ""Bad"" graphics opens this game up to so many more people
+ Plenty of quests, weapons, gear etc
+ Focusing on singleplayer first to ensure the best player experience
+ Multiplayer will be added
+ Controller support

Cons:
- Graphics may turn off some
- Bugs (Its EA with an active Dev team, give it time)
- Random frame drops even with this type of graphics.

This game gives you freedom, makes you feel adventurous, and relaxes you at the same time. The survival aspect of the game at the time I write this review is not the main point of interest in this game, you only need to find food and eat in order to survive. There is no system for drinking/sleeping like in other survival games, this game does not focus on that. Let's not be fooled by this, Salt focuses on exploration, crafting, fighting for your life, fighting for loot, scavenging, and living adventures, and it is excellent at delivering that. The need to eat is just to spice it up without interfering in your immersion, and is quite enjoyable to hunt for some meat or search for anything to eat without feeling that desperate.

The only thing I can point out right now, knowing is still in early access, is the lack of wild life. I would love to see more animals implemented into the game, like small animals and birds, and maybe predators also, like tigers or wolves. Maybe in future updates.

In any case, this is a great game, and for the price it has, it will bring you a lot of hours of gameplay, probably more than you put in high priced mainstream games.",1451528122,1451528702,True,18,1,0.669337570667266846,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Nothing quite beats the feeling of exploration you get when you've charted yourself a course for a far off island using your compass and sextant, standing at the tip of your ship with the waves crashing at you. 

Pros:
 * super relaxing game
 * A lot to explore, and it is simply fun to sail around and chart some islands. 
 * Decent progression so far in the gear: you start off trying to track a deer to make pants so that you aren't running around bare assed in the bushes. And now some time later I've got some ancient armor and got myself a giant ship.
 * No hand holding. The game gives you a few hints of what you can look for in the beginning but that's it. Try to avoid the wiki or the maps floating around! It's more fun to figure it all out or to stumble upon a derelict ship all on your own.
 * Dev seems to be updating pretty frequently, so I'm excited to see what they will come up next. 

Cons:
 * Combat feels a bit clunky, but it's not too bad. I wish it was more involved
 * We NEED a cartography system of some sort, even if it's manually inputting waypoints/coordinates. So far I've MacGuyver'd something in MS Paint. It works, but it's a pain to have to keep tabbing out. We need something in-game.
 * Enemy AI could use some work. Right now they run like a maniac if you stand in 2 feet of water.
 * Ran into a coulpe bugs, but to be fair it was very few and nothing too horrible. Worst one being getting hopelessly stuck in a tree after I got spooked from a giant spider nipping me in the bum. This was after sailing really far away to try to get to a jungle island the innkeeper told me about. It really bolocks'd up my entire expedition.

That's it, that's the game.
I adore this genre, and I'm always on the lookout for games with at LEAST potential.
This is not one of those games.

I tried so hard to give it a chance. But every minute was a chore. The glaring colors didn't jive, despite them trying to make it look tropical and warm/bright. The whole GUI and HUD are a complete mystery, along with the controls- especially since they didn't use typical controls for a pc game like this. There's not even a click and drag from inventory to the hotbar. What game EVER doesn't have a click/drag, or an easy way to move about items when the WHOLE GAME is about scavenging items. And sometimes you gotta run over items to pick them up and other times you have to use E and sometimes you gotta stab at stuff...I don't want a guessing game. Are you *trying* to anger your players? 

After what felt like a hellish lifetime of playing, scouring not only their 'instruction manuals' but their oddly placed control/more instruction manuals in their pause menu, I STILL couldn't find out how to put things in the hotbar. I've had an easier time figuring out a mmorpg. 

And the story. The story is just no good. It felt...let's politely use the words tired, strained and boring. It gave me zero motivation to do anything- no, it actually gave me negative motivation. When you make a game, you go into it with a *writer* in the team, if you are going to include story. And by writer, I mean someone who is creative and somewhat skilled in the art. Narrative is something you need to build up and finesse. Not just slap the first thing you think of on paper when you think of the ocean. (spoilers, I'm talking pirates) 

Real talk here, I would have more fun reading a car manual aloud to kindergarteners. 

It really felt like they were trying *too* hard to set themselves apart from other open world games, like Minecraft and such. The controls and crafting were just...barely functional. Like a termite infested peg leg. Oh and golly gee, if you're trying to not be Minecraft, don't make the peoples' anatomy look so much like their model. I thought herobrine was chasing me down the beach. If you want exploration, crafting, open world, survival, narrative (or at least just cohesive context)....fun....there are MUCH better early access games out in the market. 

Ugh. 
Let's just say this game made me...Salty.
And I most certainly wouldn't be if this game wasn't so expensive, the reviews weren't mostly positive or the preview video showed only a small fraction of the gameplay that looked adventurous and appealing, when the reality of it is...just not that. I seriously feel offended as an artist/writer, and cheated as a gamer. 
This game is literally BARELY playable. And even at that, only if you feel like punishing yourself.

...I'm getting my money back.",1450951644,1450953334,False,4,2,0.526569902896881104,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Ich liebe es, wei√ü aber ehrlich gesagt nicht einmal, warum.
Es ist leer, es gibt wenig zu tun, die Gegner sind immer die Gleichen.
Und doch komme Ich nur schwer davon los.

Die positiven Aspekte:
[b]+Die Entwickler![/b]
Ich kann es kaum genug loben, wie sehr sich die Entwickler um die Spieler k√ºmmern. Wenn man eine Diskussion im Communityhub anf√§ngt, wird sich fr√ºher oder sp√§ter ein Entwickler melden, um das Problem zu beheben (sofern man sich vorher nicht wie ein Kleinkind benommen hat.)
[b]+Riesige Welt[/b]
Die Welt in Salt wird immer weiter generiert, je weiter man segelt. 
Immer neue Inseln, keine gleicht der anderen, sodass sich der Besuch jeder einzelnen auf seine eigene Art lohnt.
[b]+Simples Craftingsystem[/b] 
Das Craftingsystem ist zwar noch in der Entwicklung, aber die Rezepte f√ºr Waffen, R√ºstungen und Werkzeuge sind selbsterkl√§rend. Steine+Holz=Schwert, Holz+Kohle=Fackel, ...
Laut den Entwicklern wird noch dran gefeilt, da es z.B. noch keine Werkbank/Amboss oder √Ñhnliches gibt.
[b]+Segelschiffe.[/b]
Okay. Rein subjektiver Punkt. Aber ich liebe Segelschiffe und die Modelle im Spiel sind simpel aber genial.
[b]+Auch Kartoffeln k√∂nnen das Spiel schaffen.[/b]
Ich habe einen steinalten Laptop, weshalb meine Auswahl an Spielen sehr eingeschr√§nkt ist.
Aber Salt l√§uft problemlos.

Die negativen Aspekte:
[b]-Die Grafik[/b]
Salt hat eine sehr heruntergeschraubte Grafik, was viele Spieler abschrecken wird und mich selbst auch anfangs sehr angestrengt hat. 
[b]-Die Leere[/b]
Die Welt von Salt ist noch zu leer. 
Es gibt noch vieles hinzuzuf√ºgen, wie die Entwickler sebst sagen. Aber gut, wohl nur ein tempor√§res Minus.
[b]-Sehr spezifische Zielgruppe[/b]
Man muss eine gro√üe Faszination/viel Spa√ü am Segeln haben, um das Spiel genie√üen zu k√∂nnen.
Wenn man wie in AC4 gro√üe Seeschlachten oder fies-hinterh√§ltige Attentate erwartet, wird man entt√§uscht werden. 
Das Segeln in Salt ist eine Notwendigkeit, die einem Spa√ü machen sollte, da sie ca 70% der Spielzeit in Kauf nimmt 
(ES GIBT KEINE SCHNELLREISE.)

Zusammenfassung: Salt macht Spa√ü, wenn man Spa√ü am Meer und am Segeln hat.
Wenn man mit den beiden Dingen nichts anfangen kann, sollte man die Finger vom Spiel lassen.

I actually learned cartography from this game and began making a sea chart for my save. Rip world reset later, but I can move on.

Pros:
- Beautiful game.
- Neat features like hitting trees to make fruit fall from the branches and repairing old pirate ships.
- Added NPC vendors in huts.
- Neat UI.
Fixed:
- Confusion on how to open chests.
Cons:
[Note these are likely just things in the works, I'm confident in Salt's amazing dev team!]
- New issue, I can't figure out how to craft the pickaxe. Components involve mining I believe. 
- Sharks? Please no Stranded Deep. Comments:
= Normal or small sized sharks are better.
= Sharks bumping the boat/raft is fine, but when your sailboat has the physics of a beach ball and you a stone there is a problem haha. Rip SD.
- Average combat system, making a new flare of strategy is better than hack and slash. (This hasn't bugged me too much).
- * No Multiplayer or Co-op. I'm 100% sure this is in the dev's plans. I really hope that they can steer Salt away from the KOS boat that every other survival game floats in. 

I know that this is an amazing exploration game, but frankly making an island into a home would add a lot of playtime into the game. I just hope that you would have the means to find your base if you died.

A cool idea: if players discover and land on an island for the first time they can name it. The more time you spend on an island the longer it will say it is claimed to you. Say Jim plays on St. George for 15 hours, and Timmy for 10 then it says Claimed by Jim. If Jim named it and he still lives there with his friend it will also be claimed by Jim and Friends. Jim just needs to be semi-active.

What I cannot believe is that I was just in time to see some real development in the game, as I began playing SALT just before this update was released, so I was able to see the ship models and textures before. after the update I was blown away by its detail upgrade. Highly recommend SALT and can only assume the best of its potential.

I would say 10/10 but as I am only 2 hours in, I will have to give 8/10 until my excitement and enthusiasm dies down. Then my rating can be more accurate and see clearer.

If you like fishing, sailing, stalking deer - this game is for you.

If you find sailing 5, 10, or even 30 minutes sailing/searching for that particular island, relaxing and enjoyable- this game is for you.

If you prefer semi-avoidable combat - this game is for you.  (you do need to fight some badies if you are to fully experiance the game)

If sailing around and the sound and motion of the water relaxes you and you decide to recline back and take a 15 minute nap to the sounds of the ocean before continuing your journey - this game is for you.

If you have a really stressfull job - this game is for you.

If the family is getting on your last nerve - this game is for you.

If you just watched a horror movie - play this game before you go to bed.

Since then the lads at Lavaboots have been setting sails and hauling ass adding several things including multiplayer(Which was one of my main critiques back then). Present day it's probably looking better than ever. 

Salt has a great soundtrack that makes long journey's all the more enjoyable, it has a decent combat, and a lovely manner of sailing about it.

The combat is as expected a system of crafting or finding weopons with different stats that relate to the players stats that can be boosted with apparel. This makes it seem like one is really making progress while playing as battles become easier.

The scenery is vivid and pretty ,as it should be, and along with the soundtrack makes the game enjoyable peacefull at times while at other occasions eary, spooky and even dark enough to make a lost, torch deprived sailor be spooked by the night sounds. I find the transition between night and day to be drastic and well done. Even silence is appreciated in this game.

Salt also boasts a unique charting system which some may find daunting at first, as one is required to use tools, found or crafted, to obtain co-ordinates and fill it in manually instead of the game telling you where you are visaully. 

Sailing could be improved by making storms, windspeeds and enemies more influental, but is enjoyble and it is ever so satisfying to finally obtain a lovely new ship from the generous variety.
I would like to see ship on ship combat and dangours to ships like reefs and even sea monsters.
Those pirates probably know their way aound a gala at the rate they manage to spread without a sail in sight.

Some better npc interactions could help and possible some events that happen without player influence, like npc confrontations.

Over all I really look forward to grab ""Captain Joe of the Dank Sea"" and ""Charl of Dissapointment Island(50.6071¬∞ S, 165.9726¬∞ E)"", and to set sail across the waters of Salt and believe me, with this jolly lot things can get salty.",1443369401,1515666425,True,19,2,0.587359309196472168,3,True,False,True,False,,,

Crafting 8/10 (Its about as good as any other list based crafting system)

You bump into lots of Salt everywhere you look, it's all over the place.  Salt on the beaches, salt on the water or in the water, salt on the craft raft, salt in the air, and salt in your hair.  Salt in places you'd just never care!

I like that this game is very simple and relaxing to play, sometimes I enjoy playing the game without wearing any pants.  I'm speaking for myself sitting on the couch, not my character.  So far I don't know if he has found pants yet either.  So if you think about it we could coexist in some sort of parallel universe and never even possess the realization of this uncanny miracle.  

Once you craft the basic things you need to explore and defend yourself it's pretty relaxing and cool to play.  I don't like to fight the lego looking pirates without getting at least 1 shot off with the bow.  They grunt like my former college roommate when he used have sex with tank ass the redhead with a huge butt that resembled a shelf.  you could place decorations or plants on that thing.  it was non structural but it was load bearing enough to handle light storage.  

The part of the game that makes me ornery is the raft placement and steering, this thing just doesn't cooperate at 1st.  Even at sea it's very tricky and sensitive.  It reminds me of Tom Hanks in BIG.  He was very lost at the time and upset with the decision he made, and you probably think i'm jumbled and should have written Castaway...no that's a farse.  

The 9th Pirates of the Caribbean movie featured several islands from this game.  The island of Sloar is infamous for Pirate raids and Treasure troves of chests just ripe for the looting.  The Pirates from Salt do not look anything like Jack Sparrow but they walk just as if they are more intoxicated.  I like their style.  this game is cool

On land, you have many challenges to face, pirates, etc to fight and also spiders to kill.  
The trees and plants offer fruit or some type of flower that you can consume to heal or run faster or glow brighter...
There are lots of different quests to do and some are harder than others. But when you complete one, you get a reward. 
Killing pirates is also rewarding. Each one carries some type of item that is useful to keep or trade to a Merchant.

The graphics have become a great deal better since I first played. Every friday there is a post on the blog about what's to come and so far, I have not been disappointed. It just keeps getting better and better every week.

If you have an issue or question, the forum is very helpful  always giving advice. 
The devs are doing a very good job on responding to your requests.

It has very few survival elements. I have seen some reviews either crediting it with being a good survival game (??) or expressing their distaste at it's poor survival mechanics. THIS GAME ISN'T MEANT TO BE A SURVIVAL GAME. It focuses much more heavily on exploration and adventure. You can't even starve to death at this point in development. (You should also try the demo before buying the game).

Salt doesn't have the best graphics, not by far, but it has amazing content and amazing sounds, minus the combat. It is also in Early Access, with a lot of the features already implemented at the time of writing this review. More luxurious features are currently in the works, such as a weather system and multiplayer. Other features such as an underwater world and pirates sailing on the seas are planned, but don't look to be coming any time soon. 

This game also has another interesting EA topic. It has, if you will, recieved the perfect pinch of Salt, in terms of attention and money. By this I mean that Salt hasn't gotten a lot of attention from famous youtubers, meaning it hasn't gotten the large playerbase of games like The Forest or Stranded Deep. What you will notice to be similiar about both of the latter games mentioned, is that their development is very slow at this point. The devs have slacked off quite a bit, as they have recieved the fruits of their labor before completing the task. They have millions of dollars at their fingertips, so why bother to finish the game? Salt hasn't gotten this treatment, mostly because it's graphics turn people away. Howver, the devs don't seem to be struggling with money. They have just enough to keep development going, and, hopefully, when the game is released, they will be rewarded with a much larger playerbase. They don't look like they will be giving up anytime soon.

Anyway, on to the actual game. The game has very few bugs. It has only crashed once for me, and I think that actually may have been more of an issue on my end. It's not very realistic, though. The deer seem a bit out of place, for example. These may just be placeholders, though. Or they will be explained in the lore that the devs are working on. There are all sorts of islands, from desert islands to ancient islands, with crumbling pillars and statues. However, all islands except the desert ones are forested, and the desert ones are very rare. But this isn't a very big issue. Some islands are flatter than others, with rolling plains, while others have towering mountains that stretch far above the horizon. Some have pirates on them, and I have heard of rare Cultists and ancients reanimated statues on others. Some are uninhabited completely, while others have the occasional deer. Some have a merchant, or an innkeeper, or an entire pirate vallage. And the best part? It's all randomly generated, unless you choose to use the default world seed. The current quests are a bit dull, though. I have only seen one, Helping the Innkeeper, a one-part quest in which you must recover an innkeeper's hat from a nearby pirate village. However, he gives you an excellent sword to do the job, making the entire quest a bit too easy. Or maybe i just got lucky.

The seas currently have no dangers, not from sharks, not from pirates, not from drowning. However, it is possible that with the weather update it will become possible to be capsized by waves. And sharks can be caught using a fishing pole. You can't currently go underwater, and if you try you will be greeted with a dark blue rectangle. There's nothing there. However, the seas do look beautiful and the currently have dynamic tides, but at this point you can't get capsized, only look cool sailing through 4-foot high waves. (Which, honestly, aren't very big, but I think that's as big as they get at this point). The seas are used only for 2 things: fishing and travel. Travel is of course important, but fishing is, at this point, pointless, as you cannot starve. 

Combat isn't the bare minimum, but it isn't Chivalry, either. You can dodge and block (with certain weapons), and some weapons have secondary functions, like a backstab. You can find better weapons in your travels, and harder enemies. I believe the hardest one has 1,000 HP. To put that in perspective, I believe the player starts off with around 55 or 50. Of course, you can get armor that gives you an edge in combat. You will normally fight 2 types of enemies: Pirates and spiders. Other ones, like Cultists or Ancients, are very rare in the world. The AI is basically the same: all enemies seem to sprint at you, sometimes zigzaging, until they reach you, at which point they will attack you relentlessly. The pirates that I have seen make no attempt to block or parry. They only way to escape from enemies is to run to the water, which is thankfully usually not very far it your slashing adventures go wrong. However, I wouldn't even bother if I were you. Why?

Death doesn't matter. When you are killed, you respawn at the last point where you saved. However, you retain all of your equipment, even anything that you may have gotten on the island where you died. In Hardcore mode, you die for good, but your saves are retained, so you can just reload an older save. I hope this changes in the future, but perhaps that is just my opinion.

TL;DR
Salt is exploration based, not survival based. If you're looking for an in-depth survival game, look elsewhere. Salt has a very large amount of content for Early Access with more features planned in the future. The world is very fun to explore, save for the seas, which are a bit lackluster in content. The combat is very good, but nothing we haven't seen before. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for an adventure in a game for a cheap price with a good amount of replayability.",1436740887,1436740887,True,53,2,0.797258675098419189,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It is a game that requires patience, and steady progress in terms of building your inventory of equipment.. take your time to see what items you can create, look for abandon pirate ships to repair, keep and decorate.. going straight for the pirates from the off, is just suicide and they will trounce your hind immediately.

Thankfully water is not something your character requires in the slow-paced adventure lovers dream that is Salt.  I purchased this game on a whim one day, and I can say that it did not disappoint.  Salt is not a game for Action lovers.  It's not even a game for adventure buffs looking for an engaging story, but Salt provides a beautiful open-world sandbox adventure game with just enough mythology and folklore to keep you sailing on.  Travelling can be dull at times, especially when you sail for long periods of time without even seeing another island to explore, but these moments are not overly common.  There are a plethora of items to find, gather, craft, etc. though the crafting and inventory menus are still a little rough around the edges for me. (I should note here that I have not played the game since the latest update and the developers say they have addressed some of the issues with the inventory/equipped items etc.)  The beautiful scenery is the real star of Salt.  The sunrise and sunset will never disappoint you, and the islands, though all fairly similar in appearance other than elevation, look nice enough.  Grass blows in the wind, fires crackle in the distance at night, and combing through a dense island at night with nothing but a dim torch to light your way can be truly haunting.  After playing the game for some time I really only have two outstanding issues I would like to bring up.  One, the enemies of Salt are the biggest nemesis of the game itself.  The graphics just seem sort of lazy and the AI is almost nonexistent.  I'm not a stickler on graphics and I love playing older games, but with the polished look that the rest of the game has you will find yourself wondering why the developers fell flat in this regard.  The other issue I want to address is the absence of other ships in the game.  While sailing you will literally never encounter anyone.  I don't mean to imply that the game should be known for ocean battles, but it would be nice to include something like a trade ship that sells supplies and upgrades for your ships, or even just friendly passersby who could give you missions and what not.

My overall rating for Salt would be 7/10

If you like adventure games where you have a minor story overview but also largely craft your own story i think you will enjoy this game.  Gathering supplies and crafting never seemed repetitive as long as I had something to gather for.  Eventually you will most likely run out of missions, but I can honestly say even though I have largely completed what the game initially had to offer I feel It was an absolute deal for the price.",1435872667,1435873474,True,5,0,0.554329216480255127,0,True,False,True,False,,,

However steam don't count your hours ingame when you are offline. Warning sometimes when they update your save gets a bit corrupted (last time i spawned a different place than i quitted but they warned me before i loaded it)

[u] TLDR: Very good potential of a game 9/10 [/u]

Crafting: It has a somewhat good crafting system (you don't know the recipes but you can see which things that are able to have some sort of crafting but not that you have all the items) The ""only"" way you can craft then is to know the recipe from an earlier game, find a book which tells you how to craft it or just try to put some different things in the crafting box and see if it tells what can be crafted out of it. (of course there is wikis for the recipes but this seems quite fun to try for some time). 

Next is the games AI: The AI of the enemies in the game is pretty well made when you shoot a pirte with an arrow the pirate runs in zigzag (he runs against you but swaps direction from a little left to a little right) which makes it hard to kill him with arrows before he finds you. There is some fails in the system with when you go into water the pirates stop chasing and when 2 pirates stand side by side the person you shoot with your bow only reacts not the other one. A thing i miss is some kind of stealth system when you shoot a pirate or animal it always knows where you are.

Next the landscape variaty (going to be placed in spoiler hold mouse over to see because it spoils the landscapes and things on the islands). [spoiler] There are 2 different landscapes: Desert islands with palmes and standard grass/tree islands. However on these islands there can be quest givers, pirates or even pirate towns. I hope they make more different kinds of islands but remember it is early access [/spoiler]

Crashes and bugs: The time i have played also the offline time i have not experienced any major bugs or crashes. The only thing that can get wrong i have experienced is some AI problems and your save when they update however the write that saves bug when they update since they can update faster then which seems fair.

That was it hope you buy it because this can turn out to be a very good game (it is good now but it can be better).",1435820142,1452529223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It reminds me a lot of Zelda Windwaker, which I loved, so finding this game was a major win!

Still I'm enjoying it a lot, just managed to repair one of the scattered pirate ships and am decorating it and enjoying having a full blown home on the seas, not just a wee sailboat. :)

I do very much recommend this game, with the caveat that it IS early access still and it shows with the emptiness of the world and some quest givers don't have quests to give yet. I look forward to being a part of it and watching the game progress and fill out.

To the developers, I'd love a more comprehensive help guide, perhaps even a tutorial 'quest' that shows you how to do most of the necessary things. Also, a more user friendly crafting recipe book would be great - as it stands it's lots of scattered recipes in handfuls of books that clutter up my inventory. I'd love to see it all compiled (as recipes are discovered) into a single journal accessed through a UI button/icon. Or at least just one book in my inventory for all recipes for crafting things of all types. Also a MAP! Right now I'm writing coordinates in an IRL paper notebook, but it'd be fun to have a map I could open and, as I discover things, mark them on an actual in game map I could then go back to.

Manko sind die noch vorhandenen Bugs (z.B. trifft der Bogen eher nach dem Zufallsprinzip, auch wenn man sieht, dass der Pfeil den Hirsch ganz klar durchfliegt, macht er keinen Schaden) aber da es sich um ein Early Access Spiel handelt, kann ich da durchaus dr√ºber hinwegsehen.

I found myself completely immersed in Salt to a point where I was legitimately freaked out by some of the games content, inquisitive about other things and quite pleased with how serene the randomly generated worlds are. The early access game does leave some things to be desired; multiplayer, smoother graphics, etc. but the content, as lava boots implements it, feels very well placed, there are very few loose ends that are common with many early access games.
I do have a few things that I would love to see in future updates; better sailing mechanics (let's face it, square sails are historically accurate, but are not the most efficient or visually appealing, Assassin's Creed Blackflag found a great balance in the sailing department) The weather cycles and new night sky are in the works, I am very excited about those, they will really help with an already immersive game. The story line could use a little work in order to ease the player into it sooner, but the journey of exploration is indeed a good one. The pirate captain bosses could be a little less random, I had trouble hunting down the last one.
Overall a stellar game, It runs (fairly) smoothly on most machines, the new menu system is great, and I am looking forward to using my controller with the new patch.

--------------------------------------------
Gesamtwertung: 8/10 mit Tendenz nach Oben!

Eng: Great Game, i would write more but i think my English is not good enough. sry. But there is one thing more to say. Everytime i start this game it feels like holidays ;-)

Ger: Also ich finde es immer wieder aufs neue faszinierend wie man mit nu3 knapp 300MB so ein geniales Spiel auf die Beine stellen kann welches zur Zeit weniger durch den Spielinhalt (Ist ja noch Erly Access), sondern mehr durch sein simples Auftreten bezaubert.

Die Grafik ist vollkommen ok auch wenn es vielleicht nicht jedermanns Geschmack trifft. Es macht Spa√ü einfach aufs weite Meer raus zu fahren und die Seele etwas Baumeln zu lassen, nur um dann diese Pl√∂tzlich am Horizont auftauchende Insel zu sehen, das Ruder rum zu rei√üen und auf Entdeckungstour zu gehen. Wenn die Nacht herreinbricht und der Sonnenuntergang das Licht dimmt, hat man das Gef√ºhl dass ein wundersch√∂ner Tag in der Karibik zuende geht, und wenn man das Spiel beendet, f√ºhlt es sich an als w√§re der Urlaub vorbei und die Sorgen des Alltags brechen wieder herrein.

Crafting: Bis jetz noch im vergleich zu andeen Spielen verh√§lltnism√§√üig wenig, aber ist in Arbeit und ich sags nochmal ist ja noch in der Entwicklungsphase. Von daher bin ich sehr gespannt was da noch so kommt.

Kampfsystem: Sehr Leicht!  Ist jetz kein Dark Souls aber das muss es auch nicht. Das Spiel m√∂chte dich in eine andere Welt entf√ºhren in der du sozusagen Christoph Kolumbus bist und dich auch so f√ºhlen sollst, und das schafft es. Ein zu kompliziertes Kampfsystem w√§hre fehl am Platz.

Nun zu meinem Farzit:

Grafik: 7/10

Spielspass: 9/10 (Wenn man nicht nur auf hardcore Action steht, f√ºr alle COD-Fans warscheinlich eher 1/10)

Wiederspielwert: 10/10 da die M√∂glichkeit besteht die Welt zuf√§llig generieren zu lassen.

Gr√∂√üe der Spielwelt: 10/10 Ich sags mal so, Wenn du bis zum ende deines Lebens nurnoch dieses Spiel spielst hast du warscheinlich immernoch nicht alle Inseln deines allerersten Spielstandes erkundet!

Steuerung/Oberfl√§che: Sehr einfach gehalten

 - Relaxing! It's a really low stress game. My heart rate climbed above 30bpm only when there were pirates rushing at me with axes. I almost had a heart attack. 

 - Fun! It's actually pretty fun if you're into exploring and open worlds. The map (I believe) is endless, with random generated islands always coming up on the horizon at some point. You actually do get a small sense of discovery and it's just as intense as Capt. Picard discovering a new planet, or a cheap street walker discovering a new wart in her nether regions. 

 - Deep(ish/er than I thought it would be)  crafting system. If you don't look up recipes on a guide, it can be mildly entertaining to experiment on things! Also, it's a good way to pass time when sailing between islands, sail time can be long. 

 - Interesting loot. I actually found myself scouring islands mainly for better weapons and armor, and was surprised at the level of bonuses and whatnot that the devs have put in the game. I wasn't expecting passive skills on different stuff, and armor sets, it was unexpected and interesting trying to find all the pieces of a specific set. It's basically Skyrim on steroids but when i say that I mean after it grows lady lumps and stops and becomes a scrawny chicken man again. So no, it's not Skyrim but it's better than I thought.

 - Interesting islands. Scouring for resources on islands and searching for pirate bases and especially traders and treasure hunter islands was a great time waster while I waited for Elder Scrolls Online to take 20 FUCKING HOURS TO DOWNLOAD.

CONS:

 - Early access! It's buggy sometimes. It'll still have a ways to go. But it's entirely playable in it's current state so you can't knock it TOO much here. Unlike DayZ which is STILL BUGGY as HELL.

 - Graphics. They aren't for everyone. Myself personally it doesn't bug me that they're pretty dated graphics, but to some people they'll be turned off. 

 - Repetition. Repetition. The game is basically the same thing over and over. Basically it's the same gameplay repeated. It's pretty much the same objectives repeatedly. You'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over. There isn't much variety in the gameplay, it kind of repeats itself a lot. HOWEVER. You WILL have a purpose generally, especially if you're trying to follow the questline, or collect supplies for certain in-game items that are pretty impressive that require mass amounts of supplies to inherit...almost kind of a spoiler what you can find, so i won't ruin it. It was cool discovering one for the first time.

 - Pirate AI - Garbage. Might change with early access, but the AI is heinously bad. 

Overall, Salt basically boils down to one word. Mild. The game is mildly entertaining, mildly exciting, and mildly deeper than i thought it would be. It's great for playing to pass time while waiting for another longer download if you don't wanna use bandwidth and for just passing the time exploring.

A game to restore your faith in Early Access.
Lovely, simple, relaxing.
First of all the graphics, they are stylized not poor. Sure they are not realistic, but they dont have to be.
Gameplay is absorbing and easy to handle if you have played a few survival games (although apart from combat, survival is assured). And the journeys from island to island with even the first boat you can craft are relaxing and wavey (nice to just drift and bob). The old familiar collecting of wood and rocks and plant fibres to craft are here, but crafting is not a major factor.
Ok I would like to see more content, but hell, don't we always? And I'm sure more will come and I have only just started and there is lots to do still.

It is a simple game but full of great gameplay and I am so far very happy with the purchase. 9/10
Updates will follow.

UPDATE:14/4/16 
Well my initial high hopes are wearing thin as this game has not really developed since the last review. The general feel of Early Access (unrefined UI, purpose of ""why your here and what you should do next"") is still overpowering and although updates have brought minimal new content and navigation improvements, It now really feels like this project could suddenly announce that it has reached full release because developers have new projects to be getting on with.....I hope this is not the case.",1434378722,1460606798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This is a very addictive game if you enjoy aimlessly wandering around and loot hoarding, lol.

EDIT: So, now stars have been added, pretty cool, only one issue, now when the stars come out there are fireflyesque things floating all over the place which first of all make no sense and second of all don't completely take away from your ability to navigate with the stars but they are definitely extremely distracting and well, they might make sense on an island but there should be no fireflies out on the water so I don't understand their purpose at all other than to add some kind of forced atmosphere during the day and a slight distraction at night.

The character models were really rough when I played it before but they have since been cleaned up quite a bit they kind of gives off a rough legos + campy feel, if that makes any sense. There also seem to have been a lot of other modifications made so it's looking really good. I haven't messed with the building options all that much, not sure if you can build a house or anything complex like that yet but you can put together a lot of other things like bow and arrows, shovel, mining pick, clubs, swords, etc. I definitely recomend giving it a try, it's a very simple/basic game yet rather vast due to how far you can travel from island to island.

EDIT+1: The bigger floaty lights are gone out on the water, super cool, there are still small ones but they aren't obnoxious like they were before. The stars are really pretty and you do navigate by them but not directly since the sextant automatically gives you the coordinates, not that that is a bad thing, it is a game anyways, wouldn't want to have to look at the stars every time you want to see where you are. I mean that would be fun for a few days but then it would just become tedious.

I've played it all the way up to beating dreagan and to be honest it was a tiny bit underwhelming. I really like the game and I love how things are slowly being added in order to keep it from being too convoluted and ending up tripping over itself in the process but it becomes a little lackluster after a while. I really enjoyed the game specifically because of the exploration and the excitement of finding new things and new places but after playing it for a few months it has turned into the same ole' same ole' of islands and pirates and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, it's still a wonderful game and I would suggest anyone interested in a relaxing exploration game to check it out. At a certain point, as it is with any game, you run out of stuff to do. 

I believe the game would be better if there was something you were working towards, like gather 500,000 pink coconuts to turn in for a pink pirate cutter or some such silliness. You get done with all the quests and then there isn't a buffer for you to work on till the next update. it needs something that will take a rediculously long time to accomplish, thus giving the developers time to release more content. Like find all fifty rare pirates that each have a part to a golden ship or you know something that makes you want to explore more.

Refreshing to have a non-voxel based survival game with a pirate theme, the boats are handled well and are integrated into the game nicely. The visuals dont strive for realism, instead having a more cartoony art style which makes the enviroments look good, while the character models and sound effects could use some work. The combat is definitely in need of work, there is no collision with animals or enemies and the bow and arrow is hard to use effectively, although this is something that will definatly improve as the devs work on it.

PROS:
- Open world.
- Sailing and boats are fun to use
- Very nice to look at
- Crafting makes sense and leaves a lot for the player to discover.

-Combat needs work
-Some optimisation and polish in the graphics

Something that I would love the developpers to add would be small towns with friendly inhabitants (there are already friendly NPCs but they are too few compared to pirates)
It would be great and could add more trading possibilities to the game !

And or those who might still think that this game is another early access poo, without frequent updates, with low dev response and a crappy ugly non-optimized unity engine : well no it isn't !
This game just had an update on test-branch, I submitted a bug report and the bug got fixed on the following day, and, the game isn't laggy and glitchy at all compared to some other high-budget ""AAA"" games (such as the ones with dinosaurs (^_^)'), even if it's using unity.

this review is coming from someone who dosent enjoy most survival games. also i dont really recommend this game but theres no neutral option

this game is really fun and its really cool how you can explore the whole world. BUT for me personally it got boring about an hour in. i had no idea what to do. no goal. its amazing for an early access game but its lacking in content,so here some ideas! add biomes or types of islands like lets say some islands will be inaccessable because of rocks all around the coast. or another island will be dead with no plant life how about some GIANT islands?. maybe add more animals like turtles and crabs or monkeys. how about large islands with towns and merchents and people. im pretty sure theyre planing on this allready but just in case there not add fish and sharks.

tl:dr so far one of the best games on early access but it dosent have much to do. i got bored about an hour in.",1434212255,1434212255,True,2,0,0.500321030616760254,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Salt's infinite playability, paired with good combat mechanics and sailing makes this game well worth the price. Players can embark on quests, sail the deeper oceans and battle towering waves, trade with merchants and conquer islands infested by either a few pirates, or a pirate village filled with battlemasters surrounded by many camps. However, the game isn't totally perfect.

Though this isn't something that hinders the game, it's something that can be a bit tedious. Resources can be unusually difficult to aquire- for example, many recipies for higher quality weapondry require Hardwood. hardwood is incredibly rare when spawning, but is even more difficult to find. All resources spawn on the ground- no chopping down trees, ect and are hidden by tall grass. This can result in a player wandering over an island scanning every square inch of ground for a solid hour, all for nothing.

However, it's not that bad. Merchants and quests, along with pirate camp loot will sometimes have hardwood. For example, one merchant offered in a fairly easy quest for  5 hardwood- pretty sweet!

I love the atmosphere (graphics, music, sounds) of this game. I get completely immersed and hours just fly by.

There is not much hand holding, just a few journals with some basic info, so you have to figure out a lot on your own. This also leads to a lot of surprise moments, e.g. when you find out that some islands have resources and creatures that only appear at certain hours, or when you encounter new enemies that you have awakened through your actions.

I'm curious as to what new content will be added in the future, but I hope that the core of the game will remain the same. And I hope that the single player mode will be still available when a multiplayer mode will be added.

But don't let that deter you, if you love ocean exploration and don't mind meh graphics buy this game. 

Some things I would like to see added to this game:

Large land masses, they could have small castles or towns, or have underground dungeons, to keep the sense of exploration alive. Just going from island to island killing pirates and picking up logs is going to get boring after a while, and I don't mean entire continents, just something larger than the usual as seen in the game.

Roaming enemy ships, how cool would it be to come across a pirate ship, and board it, killing all the pirates and taking the loot. Pretty cool.

A crew/companions, to help with fighting. And boarding enemy ships would be much even better with people to help you.

Other threats at sea: Maybe storms, sharks and squids, and maybe even a kraken boss if you sail out far enough. 

Diving: You know whats better than exploring the ocean surface? Exploring the ocean floor. There could be things like reefs, sunken ships, that sort of thing. Would be sweet.",1431726860,1431726860,True,3,0,0.542450428009033203,1,True,False,True,False,,,

For me, Salt was something ive sought for a long time, Where you would sail around and explore islands, scrounge materials, and having the freedom to do whatever I wanted.

Sure, its still beign developed and with that it comes with issues, but so far ive not encountered anything out of the ordinary except for some minor graphical stuff and minor AI behaviour but the impact of that is barely worth mentioning.

The islands are beautiful and ranging from lush tropical ones with ample supply of material, to semi-barren desert that may just contain a few flowers and some rocks to mine. hidden treasures,quests,pirates,cultists,monsters, theres a whole range of things to do and ive never felt bored with any of it, even after binging Salt for 2-3 days I dont get bored, theres always something to do and as it seems now, more content is on the way, and if coop is implemented, ooooh boy! Ill never see the light of day again.

So all in all, you like exploring,sailing,scrounging and just have a good time, this is the game for you, but be warned, its addictive ;)

The game also holds VERY much potential, as of what the Devs plan to add to the game,- like weather-types, new enemies, more boats, new UI, possibilities of making your own home on land, and (hopefully) multiplayer.

Salt is a game that creates addiction. It's not AMAZINGLY good, but it's good enough to hook you. Why?
Well you kinda create your own quests, directions and goals. The game does not give you anything to go on, which is the starting point of Your imagination.

Every time I log in, I find something new and fun that the Devs added. The Devs are very receptive to suggestions, so it's good to see a team stick to their Early Access game determined to make it great. My only fear is that in being so receptive, they'll try to please everyone and the game will become jumbled, something I've seen happen to other games that try to do too much and lose their focus.

Unlike many other ‚Äúopen world‚Äù games, the focus in Salt is squarely on exploration. Shortly after you arrive amongst its vast chain of islands, you‚Äôll learn how to build your first watercraft and then you‚Äôre off on a journey of adventure and discovery. 

Yes, there are items to craft. There are tools and weapons you‚Äôre going to need in order to thrive in this world. But, for the most part, crafting is just a means to an end. You won‚Äôt find yourself investing hours in creating a fortress-like home for yourself. You‚Äôll primarily build what you can carry with you. Your home, if it‚Äôs anywhere, is the endless sea.

You‚Äôll travel from one island to the next. On each one you‚Äôll find something. Maybe it will be as simple as food or the wood and stone you need to craft another set of arrows. But sometimes it will be something else. A village of pirates. Someone who needs help to finish a quest they can‚Äôt accomplish on their own. Ancient ruins. Or a tantalizing clue about a greater mystery hidden out there across the ocean. Whatever it is, there‚Äôs always just enough to keep you sailing to the next destination on the horizon.

This isn‚Äôt a frantic game. Not at all. It‚Äôs slow paced and for the most part, it‚Äôs relaxing to play. Sure, there are adrenaline invoking moments, such as when you‚Äôre trying to cut a pirate down to size. But overall, it‚Äôs about exploring. Finding out what might be on that island you can just make out in the distance.

The environment is rendered beautifully. The island foliage, the ocean waves, and the sunrises and sunsets are all exceedingly well crafted. Some have complained about the simplistic appearance of the pirates and other NPCs. While I would agree that they are very basic in design, from my perspective, they fit the world of Salt well. The sound design is excellent, particularly the noises that fill an island at night and the steady sounds of the sea. The music fades in and out at appropriate times and is never intrusive. The piano theme from the title screen is very well composed and particularly memorable.

The developers appear to be invested in the game and updates, at this point, are made steadily. Based on what I‚Äôve seen on the forums, the developers readily communicate with those that have questions or feedback. Yes, Salt is an Early Access title, but based on what is here thus far, it is already a very satisfying experience.

In short, if you have a love of exploration and the idea of setting out across the sea in search of adventure appeals to you, Salt is a game you will probably enjoy. At the very least, give the demo a test drive. You may find the world of Salt as compelling and hypnotic as I have.",1428271055,1428285891,True,46,3,0.761647224426269531,1,True,False,True,False,,,

I like this game Salt. It has alot of potential. I love the atmospheric noises such as the ocean water, the birds and much more. However, There are alot of spinoffs of survival games recently; The Forest, Stranded Deep and FarSky just to name a few. Therefore, the Salt Devs are going to have to compete for thier spot on Steam. This could mean alot of things such as Play to Win features, DLC including super OP weapons, and Advertisment Spamming.

I doubt very much Lavaboot Studios (Salt Devs) would do this because overall, they seem pretty laid back and just trying to get by. Also, the support for Salt is outstanding. The Devs listen to what you say in the Bug Reports and always get back to you within 1-3 days with progress.

Additionally I am not 100% satisfied with the game, There are alot of things I would like to see such as:

1) VR Support
2) Better Ocean mechanics (looking underwater in the ocean will display a pitch black screen)
3) Multiplayer (This Idea has been brought out by the Devs, but alot will have to be added to make multiplayer enjoyable)
4) Redesigning People. People in this game (Merchants and Pirates) look like a midget with a slight case of aspergergers and/or Down syndrome. Not making fun of anyone with those illnesses but its true.
5) More Merchant Locations: I only found ONE measly merchant while playing Salt! I mean Cmon. You need the merchants to acually have fun in this game!

Overall I would reccomend this game: 7/10",1428264942,1428265345,True,5,0,0.565390348434448242,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I feel highly entertain, and also I find it highly relaxing when I dont want to do any killing, I just go to the open sea, and try to catch a shark with my bamboo rod, and some deer guts. The experience of this game is so calming, at the same time, it can offer some trills, specially if you play at night, were survival becomes terrifiying, but also higly rewarding. 
So I recomend you this game, for a survival game fan, this game will make you feel worth every penny, and I do not write many reviews, but when I do, I make sure I am recomending something solid, and worth the price. so here is my review, please buy this game, and enjoy taking the deer guts, and getting the shark",1427688239,1427688239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game isnt finished yet but damn its good. There are basically no glitches from what i have seen so far, the randomly spawned islands are great how ever the first couple i wen't to nothing really spawned. The ships you can craft are really nice. There are 4 ships you can craft from a small raft to a apirate ship, these are good but maybe a few more should be added to give more of a choice, also the ships can be customized as well witch is a great thing. From how it looks thats really a personal thing but we can all agree that the lighting is amazing, it runs smoothly and since its nor finished i am exited to see what the future of this game holds. Things that need to be there or need in proving: a 3rd person or HUD view to see your person with the different armors there are, the spawning of plants to be a little better since some spawned in the air on hills or on smaller hills & well thats it really i can't think or any major bad things that people won't like apart from you can't build your own home/fort and its not multiplayer. I almost forgot you can but or sell things with traders on islands plus you can find tressure hunters and find tressure for them and they reward you.

This is a really good game and i recommend this game to anybody who likes sirvival or sailing or fighting pirates and adventure. 10/20 from me.",1427541739,1427541739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

In its simplest form, Salt throws you into a water abundant world full of scattered islands inhabited by Pirates and various Flora and Fauna. You'll find yourself darting island to island Gathering, Looting and Killing to upgrade your Tools, Weapons and Armor. The game does get somewhat repettitive (from what ive played of the game) but grinding up to cool new weapons and rare armor works as a neat incentive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Positives: 1: Sailing. Big boat or small, manning a ship and sailing it island to island is amazing. Not to mention sprinting
                                  and jumping off your ships deck onto an island and charging into a pirate camp with your ship full 
                                  mast, sailing into the distance, is even more amazing.                             

                 2: Customisable Ships. With smaller ships you can throw some torches for extra light, or storage crates. For
                                                       bigger ships you can put up weapon plaques, chests, fire pits and even a bed.

                 3: Armor/Tools/Weapons. There are an expansive variety of different armors, tools and weapons, all with
                                                             different uses and buffs to suit what you want. Most noticable are armor set 
                                                             bonuses that can give out extra sailing or movment speeds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Negatives: 1: 'Boat Menu'. As you work throught the game there are several different vessels you can craft, however
                                            when you eventually craft a boat its saved to your 'Boat Menu'. After that, they pretty much
                                            work as summonable mounts, useable at any time. Allthough its not a major issue, I feel like it 
                                            breaks the immersion of the game.

                   2: No death penalty. From what i've seen, theres no real death penalty with a regular playthrough and with
                                                      the mentioned Boat Menu theres no real detterant to staying alive.  There is a Hardcore
                                                      setting for this game, so for now it has some optional difficulty curve.

                   3:Bottomless Inventory. Once again, as far as i've played there is no restrictions to how many items you can
                                                            carry. Besides the point of having too much bullshit clogging up your inventory,
                                                            the storage crates and chests and not much use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expectations: 1: Misc Customisation. I would love to be able to stick down flagposts with a sigil and colors that i've
                                                             picked out to represent my character, More of a finished product thing, but would
                                                             still be great.

                       2: Additional Fauna: Im enjoying hunting down deer with my bow and arrow, though it would be nice to see
                                                         some other smaller or larger game to hunt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Almost all my points are subject to change at this point in time, but I strongly urge people to give it a go. Its not too bad
for $15.00 and it will be great to see some of the additions and alterations they make in later patches.

Salt has great atmosphere that's reinforced by it's awesome music and stunning visuals. You get to explore an expansive ocean with various types of islands that are home to a plethora of enemies. Survival really seems to be a non priority and there are no real consequences for not feeding yourself. I have to say I enjoy that. I'm sick of survival games where I need to eat every five minutes real time. They're unrealistic and annoying. The current state of the world is lonely and I'd love to see larger npc settlements or other inhabited vessels. Combat and the GUI both need some love (So does controller support but we'll pretend I didn‚Äôt say that as it's blasphemy) but I expect they'll get it in time. Please add hot keys for weapons and tools. I'd like to see some more music added even if it's more ambient because sailing long distances early game is too quiet. Part of me wishes for a leveling system also. That may conflict with the core design philosophy though. Oh well. Some textures look great while others are what I assume to be place holders. I really expect the game to get a graphical update once Unity 5 comes out. No more blow-up doll pirates maybe? Once the game is fully fleshed out and multiplayer is added it'll be a real gem especially if they add things like naval combat. All in all Salt is an already really promising exploration/role playing game with a ton of content and no major flaws (for an early access)for the price and it definitely deserves your support.,1427262884,1427263244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The first thing you'll notice when playing Salt is how beautiful the islands and water are (if playing with max graphics, at least). Light is the focal point for the majority of the impressive visuals, with shadows not only playing an important aesthetic role but also playing a minor practical role in allowing you to see which direction you're facing while in the middle of a forest without being able to see the sun itself, seeing an animal's shadow before you actually see the animal itself, etc. The game environment simply looks awesome. However, I took two points off because of the minecraft-esque pirates and other blocky models of objects within the environment. [b]8/10[/b]

[b][u]Sound[/u][/b] 
I find the music to evoke emotions of hope, exploration, and/or mystery. It's very appropriate for the type of game and I actually enjoy finding deep ocean because of the music. However, there simply isn't enough scenarios in the game where developers find music appropriate. You won't hear music for much of the game, but when you do you'll be asking why there isn't more.

The sounds are on the right track, but need some more TLC (add more ""scary"" ones that play under certain specific conditions). There's one sound in the game that (from my experience) tends to play when you're running through the jungle at night. It's a loud ""HHWWWOOOOSH"" in a high pitch that sounds like some sort of shade attacking. Maybe it's supposed to be an owl or something, but it makes me jump every time. On one occasion I shot an arrow into the shadows of a tree I heard it from, and shortly after laughing at myself for it I turned away to look at a deer down the beach. Right at that time my character's head made a ""thunk"" sound and my character's vision went down as if hit in the back of the head, temporarily turning my vision downward. I turned all around and nothing was anywhere near me. WTF. I left the island and camped on a nearby one until sunrise. [b]8/10[/b]

[b][u]Storyline[/u][/b]
You are a person that wakes up on a tropical island with nothing but the bare essentials. On your person is a journal left by someone else that tried waking you. This is how your journey begins, and as far as character backstory or finding the person that left the journal, I can't speak to that since I haven't come across either. I didn't rate this since it's an exploration sandbox adventure game with an anonymous protagonist. There's only so much you can do with story in a game like this. Open-ended is just better in general for this type of game.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b] 
The gameplay reminds me heavily of classic Everquest. Not necessarily the combat, story, or any other aspects that make a game an MMORPG, but the first-person perspective, the blocky character models, and the large expanse of water and oceans reminds me of the old boat routes, only now you can sail your own boat. I think my review is skewed because of my nostalgia for that game, so keep that in mind.

Combat is mostly just left click, right click to block if it makes sense with the weapon (otherwise hold left click down to do special attacks), and manage your health with buffs/bandages/potions. The accurate trajectories the developers put into arrow paths makes bows easily the most fun weapon you can obtain. At least there's some skill in that.

The sailing in the game is intuitive if you understand rudders, and you'll pick it up quickly enough if you don't. They make it so you can't lose your boats, which is nice, but I think they also coddle players. The game itself seems pretty easy after you get over the hump of not initially being able to find food easily. However, I've never ran out of food and I heard it doesn't do anything but prevent stamina regeneration (also similar to EQ!). There is a huge aspect of the survival game that eventually gets thrown to the wayside after about five hours or so once you stockpile food.

Overall the gameplay is very much what I expected, but they should put more on-use items in the game, or add some way to spice up combat/cartography/whatever. The game just needs new things to do. A lack of bugs and smooth gameplay keeps this rating from dropping lower. [b]8/10[/b]

[b][u]Overall Experience[/u][/b]
I have mixed feelings about Salt. I think at its core it's a really good game with a lot of potential. The basic premise pulls you in, and the graphics and immersion that they provide with the environmental sounds and lightplay create a really beautiful sandbox. 

The problem therein lies that this game is part adventure/RPG and part sandbox. There is some semblance of progression, but never pressure to actually progress. Progression also seems to fall off after a time, though I haven't explored more than a 20x20 grid to the southeast of origin. This doesn't sound like much if you've only play the game a little bit or not at all, but it's actually a huge time investment to clear an area of ocean and take note of the islands and what's on them. In fact, it can sometimes be a little tedious. I've also sailed a straight southern bearing for 40 grid markers to corroborate some of the info in the wiki.

What I'd like to see is an in-game system of cartography so that I don't have to use coffee-stained grid paper for my map. Additionally, I think the game needs to explore its adventure/RPG side a bit more and come up with an overall storyline for the world that players can figure out over time, exploration, and an inquisitive nature. There should be pirate clans that war with one another. There should be islands with dungeons related to the ruins you find around the world. These things should be introduced in the same way that all things in Salt are introduced: through exploration. The story and hard content simply needs to be there for players to find. The worst thing they could do is simply focus on allowing players to collect decorative items for their ships...

Salt is a very clean game that has a lot of potential. I really hope they'll consider adding more content to up the replay-value of the game. Right now I'm not sure there's enough content in the game to keep me playing past 24 hours. For a sandbox adventure explorer I would expect a much higher replay value. For its current stage of development I give salt an [b]8/10[/b].",1427029735,1427029735,True,5,0,0.514223694801330566,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Pros:

Relaxing survival/crafting game.
You can build ships and sail them.
You have to hunt and eat to survive.
You can build weapons and tools to use.
It has a nice simplistic art.

Cons:

Personally there is not much in the game yet (or I'm missing them). 
And it lacks tutorials so I found it hard to learn the stuff I needed to do to get my affairs in order. Some tutorial to teach the basics would be a nice addition.

But this is just EA now and it will get better. I put this game in the same quality category with the leading survival/crafting games on steam (The Long Dark, The Forest, Stranded Deep). It shows such promise.",1426684090,1426684090,True,4,1,0.532372176647186279,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Or maybe it's when you realize that you can get enough equipment to be a fearsome anti-pirate. Or maybe it's just how damn pretty the game is.

I found myself jotting down sextant coordinates of interesting treasure caches, merchants, or ruins. On actual paper. And using those notes to double-back at a later time to profit. Normally, I'd say that any game that forces you out-of-game to ""jot down notes"" is a failure. But for some reason Salt makes it work. It's refreshing not to have some kind of minimap and HUD. It's a relief to actually fight with the controls of your boat, rather than it just being a speedier version of walking. It's satisfying to plow full-speed onto a beach, hear the grind as your hull skips onto the ground, jump off of the bow and feel like the conqueror of some little patch of land.

I really think that the game needs more ships and possibly the addition of upgrades. 

Resource finding and sailing is the basic two things that are done most frequently, it can be seen as very boring and tedious. In the future it would be nice to see building.

Hiring crew to work for you would also be very nice to have. Pherhaps you can, provided the resources, set one to fish for you? And one to sail to coordinates?

With all that development, if added, caves would be cool, too. They would add a more productive and fun way to explore.

They fixed the grass.

The first time I played this game, grass was so hideously drawn that it was actually a distraction. It was that two-dimenional stuff that rotates with you so that you're always facing it, like in a bad hologram. I looked on the game's blog, and there were a number of complaints about visuals, to which the dev team basically said, ""Minecraft proves people don't care about graphics.""

But people kept complaining. And I stopped playing the game because I couldn't stop staring at how ugly the grass was.

And they fixed it. The devs defended a position, and when people continued to argue for why it was wrong, they relented, and they responded to what the players value.

It's also a really cool experience with a lot of room for adventure and discovery. But it could have been that, undone by dev tone-deafness. But they fixed the grass.

Graphics

The graphics in salt are very well done for a 15.00$ title.  The trees, Grass , and open sea are all beautifully rendered. I enjoyed looking at the sunsets , and sunrises through the trees as the light covered the island. However, the Pirates and Bossses are a reminder to why this is a 15.00$ title, and in early access.  8/10

Sound

The Ambient Sounds of Birds chirping, and the wind flowing through the trees and grass is amazingly well done.  gives a great sense of atmosphere.  The music seems to come and go at the right moments and adds to the game where it needs to.  8/10

Gameplay

Theres so much to do here.  Its a huge world to explore and all randomly generated by the seeding system.  I admit I spent the first few hours trying to figure out what to do, but eventualkly you get the hang of it.  There is no tutorial.  So crafting is a lot of Trial and Error.  It has a crafting system that allows you to build Boats, Weapons, armor, even bombs!  As you explore different islands you can find materials and even fight Pirates!
8/10   

Overall Opinion

I enjoyed my time in Salt so far, LavaBoots studio has what could be a hit on their hands.  A Brilliant getaway from the Zombie infested survival game.  For a 15.00$ early access game I would say it is totally worth it for this genre.  Salt is a wonderfully fun and fulfilling exploration game.  8/10

The game doesn't seem to get me. I'ts like when i think 'what am i gonna play today?'', this game never wins. (Not because all the orther games are so great.)

On the other side (again) the dev's seam to be busy, lots of changes, fixes and new stuff.

So will i give this Early acces game thumbs up?  The answer is Yes, however this is because there is nothing in between of thumbs up or down. I would hold my thumb sideways and slightly up! 



There are so many crafting open world games in early acces, that i'm getting lost and confused. It's like guessing or betting on the one or two, i hope more, that will become great games. 

It seems to me that if there are so many early acces games (like this), there is lots of competition, what would be very positive , however if the capicity grows, the prices should drop.(economics) I'm not seeing evidence of that.
I think that we are all paying too much for these early acces games. Could be the reason why there are so many, it's like a '""....""storm of them!

Dont buy it, buy some other sailing game. Windward is probably a much better choice even though its not first person. If you have an Xbox, get Sea of Thieves

+ Hijack/repairing a Pirate's ship feels amazing to get away from that dreadful starter raft 
+ Seems to be massly generated, haven't any sort of edge after sailing in one direction for a long period of time
+ Ship customization
+ Just enough water

Cons (most of these will more than likely be fixed in a future update): 
- Sometimes can feel like resources just never appear 
- Lack of crew/more friendly npcs
- No woodcutting 

 
Overall: A perfect game to help eat away a few hours. This game is perfect for just getting lost in the vast open world it has to offer. Hope to see many great features added in the future, like Multiplayer.

The execution could use a little pick me up.  That being said, this is a short, sweet adn to the point review.

Its a fun game I played for about 14-15 hours and took a break, yet to go back again, I might though.  It's but it has little in the way of things to do after you see the first 20 or so islands.

Pros:

*It doesn't crash.  EVER.  thats always a plus.
*It allows you to sail an open sea and control your boats in ways that no other game other than Zelda The Wind Waker has.  Complete open world, non linear navigation.
*The exploration aspect is pretty fun

Cons
*The AI could use a re write, When running from Aggro pirates when you hit water, they run away.
*It is a pain in the ARSE to find wood, as you cannot cut down any of the hundreds of trees on any given island...  IDK, but to me its not a true survival game if you cannot lop a tree down with an axe.
*The gameplay ATM is limited, I would LOVE to see more AI in the game, Maybe but not limited to:
 -Other boats on the seas
 -Native VIllages to conquer or befriend
 -Forts, towns, and docks to Conquer or befriend
 -Definitely more than 5 Ship Types, because as it stands the player can ONLY create two when you start, a little Sail raft, and a slightly less little Sail boat.  If you are lucky adn have a CRAPTON of materials, which took me 4 or 5 hours to get, you will stumble upon a wrecked Pirate ship which is considerably larger than your little pontoon boat with a sail.  and two others which one is obtained by completeing a quest, the other by killing named pirates and collecting the parts..  None of which I have obtained yet.
 - ALL of the ships are EXACTLY the same speed, I would think that a Pontoon with a sail, would be considerably faster than a Raft.  And a massive Pirate ship would be faster than a single masted Pontoon.  Which brings me to my next con.
 - The pirate ship only has ONE sail, the type of Ship it is modeled after is a caraval should have at LEAST three Sails, Two Square sails, one being the Main Sail, the other being the Fore Sail, adn the third Sail being the Lanteen, or the Triangular sail attatched to the Boom at the Bow of the ship.  Instead it has one sail plopped in the middle, looks a bti tacky to me.


ALl in all, it was a fun half day spent on this game, but as it stands right now, I don't see much more fun out of it in its current state, but still if you are a Sail Boat Enthusiest, like myself, or just want to take to the open wave this game be good for ye'

Of the negative reviews on here, I find that most either a). are disappointed at the ""early access development"" at this stage of the game and/or   b). dislike that this game hands you nothing.  (You are going to have to do some trial and error when crafting things.)

The game itself is great because the point is to find and acquire items so as to defeat pirates and captains; and ultimately, deal with ancient ruins and such that come later in the game.  It's paced a little slower than some may like, but that's the point.

I enjoy the game because it's laid back and I can unwind.  There aren't harsh time tables for which tasks must be completed.

---

I think that Salt has a long life ahead of it with potential to keep evolving as its player base grows.  The maps are vast and there is almost always something to find on an island (whether it be a look out point, items, loot, food; etc.). 
The world is beautiful and it is updated by the developers.

On the developers:  I have to give them kudos.  They listen to the community and get to work fixing any and all bugs they find quickly.  The Steam community is just as friendly and helps each other out as necessary.

After a few minutes of getting my berrings and looking around the starting island, I finally built my raft and got sailing. Steering the raft was a hell of a time, and I loved it. It felt like I was actually steering a raft with a stick. When I upgraded to the small sail boat, which was a huge improvement from the raft, I felt like I had accomplished a feat. The Pirates are challenging, at some point I wandered onto more than a few islands where I had no hope of making it out alive because I had the worst gear, yet still hadn't found the materials to make anything better.

Salt definitly needs improvement in some aspects, but I cannot wait for what else they have in mind to add. I think what I would want added to the game most of all is some sort of rough sea areas where the waves are higher and more chaotic, and toss your boat around.

can this game have any? well yes, you mine, search/hunt for food, build, fish and craft. which is exactly what every other survival game does, Rust, 7 days to die, the forest and Minecraft to name but a few

from a graphics point of view then Salts only contender is Minecraft, salt is simple, un-textured and bland. it would have been right at home with a saga mega drive and not a modern day pc. winner minecraft as its modable.

the combat (yep combat) is simply a case of wailing on your opponent with what ever you have found or built. the problem is the hitboxes suck eggs and its just a clunky afair.

the land and seas are just a uniform yellow and blue respectively the sky being a slightly different shade of blue, no clouds, weather or atmosphere what so ever, the best gfx can be found at night when you look at the moon through a tree....wow....

as for playability, its annoying, you can only mine specific rocks on certain islands and theres several types of rock that you need for different things. i can see that some peeps will love that aspect however as everything is so bland its a veritable feast of boredom with every island looking the same and very little diversity.

for the price id say its over priced even at ¬£5, this is a bargain bin game for 1990's pc's. from a Dev point of view it is a fantastic money maker that took minimal effort so well done to them.

all in all i cannot recommend this game as it has very little longevity and replayability is almost non existant.

the only good thing is that you fight pirates and not zombies but even this doesnt make up for this shoddy money maker.

Salt is not for those wanting instant gratification - it takes a long time to build up to owning that pirate ship of your dreams - and that means a lot (and I mean a LOT) of running around islands looking for resources.

You'll sail across a huge ever-expanding procedurally generated world looking for loot, hunting, fishing, fighting pirates, discovering ruins, customizing your ship and crafting new gear to help you on your journey. 

Every Salt game starts the same: you wake up on an island with no enemies, a journal, a basic crafting guide, all items you need to build your first boat, weapon and pickaxe. What's next? Engage the high seas and discover! 

As other players have said, this game is very relaxing and feel almost therapeutic. Kudos to the sound designer; all ambience sounds are top notch and very immersive. There's music too, but it only plays at the right times, like when you're on deep sea with angry waves, discovering something completely new, etc.

While the graphics are cartoonish, the lighting is very realistic. The sunset in this game is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen on a videogame. It's so beautiful that you'll want to stop everything you're doing just to admire the view. Another element that means a lot in your experience is the waves. They feel like real waves, reacting to the wind with unpredictable patterns. You really feel you're sailing into the unknown as you see your last visited island disappearing and with nothing in front of you. You can craft a sextant or look for a compass to help you find your localization.

The downside of this game is that you can't explore underwater, there's only one biome and there's no weather changes. The good thing is that new biomes and dynamic weather are already planned and are coming soon. To know more about what's planned and the stage of development you can read the devs development blog (http://saltthegameblog.blogspot.com). Every friday they post something new. Worth the read even if you don't own the game.

If you don't know if you might like Salt, download the demo. There's little limitation on the demo (you can't go very far, can't use world seeds and can't play on hardcore mode), so you can almost feel like you're having the full experience. If you enjoyed what you played, buy and support the devs. When you launch the game you'll notice that you can continue your adventure from where you left on the demo. How awesome is that?

All in all, I recommend Salt for everyone looking for a relaxing experience. You can play without worrying of dying (you respawn every death) or you can play in hardcore mode with permadeath to see how far you can go. Don't be turned off by the cartoonish graphics. There's an incredible game here. Try the demo and see for yourself.",1422623651,1422623651,True,105,4,0.828749239444732666,1,True,False,True,False,,,

3). Charecter Creation/ development. Dont turn this game into an RPG, just let the player feel more attached to the charecter by letting us create him/her.

By the time you read this, the game might drastically have changed.)

Salt is an open-world exploration game featuring boats, pirates, spiders, islands, and lots of water. 

You start off on an island without anything but a book, and you're tasked with creating a boat, or rather, a sailing raft. ""How do I create a raft?"" Press ""u"" to open then tutorial book. It'll tell you that you need to find logs and cloths. ""Well, how do I find logs and cloths?"", you explore the island. Logs are scattered everywhere, and cloth is made out of plant fibers, which is also scattered everywhere.

Once you've made you raft, you're free to explore the ever-expanding, randomly generated world of Salt. On your journey you will discover a lot of different things, and you might have to consult the wiki at times. The wiki is however, not your only way of finding recipes. The are books scattered around the world which contain several recipes, telling you how to craft different weapons, boats, and even potions, among many other things.

As I said earlier, the game contains pirates, spiders and boats. This really adds to the element of the game. It might make you rethink how you approach a pirate camp, or how you  might go hunting for loot, and deer in the night. During the night, it's pitch black. It's hard to see anything, really. You can craft a torch, though, to make it easier to see what's infront of you. However, before you do that, I recommend making a weapon.

Back to the pirates though. Unfortunatly, there are no pirates on the sea yet. You can find abandoned pirate boats, but without pirates in them. You can however, find a variety of pirate establishments on land. They all contain different tiers of pirates, each of them harder than the other. You might not want to fight the highest tier pirates at once in the game, so I suggest you make a sextant and write down the coordinates of that island for later (Recipe can be found on the wiki, or in a book).

Salt is one of those games that lets you explore it's gigantic world without limits. It lets you upgrade your method of transportation to make it faster, and it makes you rethink how you might approach a horde of bandits.

Salt is a good game, just the right amount of challenge, just the right amount of peaceful, relaxing exploration,

Updated 10/18/2015
Okay, I have been trying, I leave for a while and I come back after  updates.  236 hours now and my opinion has changed.  It had the potential to be a fun ,relaxing , peaceful game.  I do not know what the developers original plan was, but I think they made a mistake with the direction they have gone.
It is more violent, you have no choice but to kill if you want to get better armour and weapons and boats.
But beyond that , this game is unplayable.  It takes hours to get anywhere, sailing is tedious, there is no ingame way to tell where you have been (signs are useless).  Even with the sextant  and the better compass (which are not very accurate) it is difficult not to just sail around in circles and many times you find your self on islands where you have already been.
The  inventory is difficult to see for all but 20/20 vision.   The combat is unweildy and you have very little control over where your  sword is landing.   the only people that will be able to find the time to play this game are teenagers with no job or family or  chores to do,  The last people that will want to play this now boring game are teenager.
I tried the latest test  game  and we are back to the glitch of finding oneself draowning int he ocean after dying,  where does my ship go?
I can see where they are trying still to give the forum comments what they want, but there are just to many things wrong  and they seem to be concentrating on the  visuals and not the game play.  
I would not recommend and I want my 15 bucks back.

2020 tried again, this game just keeps getting more frustrating  and  hard to play.      It had so much promise as a peaceful game of exploration and  survival.   Then  boys had to  turn it into  a game  of  violence.    I hate it.",1422125153,1601658589,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game is a dream come true to me: an expansive exploration game with craft survival and RPG elements. In general, the game has a relaxing vibe to it, with the sailing across the vast blue, exploring the (seemingly) peaceful islands, and the colorful transistions from day to night. Filled to the brim with secrets and things to do, you'll get a lot of hours of play. Don't let the game's sweet candy coated outside fool you though. The game doesn't hold your hand after you begin your adventure. It gives you the bare minimum knowledge to set you on the right path, then that's it. Anything else is up to you (or you could spoil everything by looking it up online, you cheaters).

The only problem I can see most having with the game is the long calm before the storm. You're going to be sailing a lot and you're going to be foraging for crafting componets a lot. It takes a while to get some of the more decent equipment, but it makes getting them more worth while.

Salt is a game based on survival and exploring seas and land, as this game is still in early access i would like to write about the stuff that is in the game. As of now you can make 2 boats and find 1 
 
the 2 boats is: a sail raft and a sail boat
the 1 boat that you find is a abandoned pirate ship.

The materials is VERY important to get (like in any survival game)
one of the materials is wood

there is 2 types of wood: Hardwood, and normal wood

the same thing is with stone but there is: Weak Rock and  Rich Rock (that is what i know of/found in the game) 

as you get your first boat. You will need to sail to get to other islands to find loot and mobs/npc

there is not many npc/mob types yet...but the do consist of: Spider, Pirate and shopkeepers.

The loots is limited as i know of. It can be wood, stone and other stuff (NOTE: i am still looking for new things)

there can be chests in random island and on abandoned pirate ships but you need a key that you can loot from pirates and/or buy from the shopkeepers.

Now its time for the pros and cons :D

We'll start with pros

Pros: The game looks beautiful and it is heartwarming to look at (if you are into this types of games, NOTE you will get a little nostalgic feeling.

The soundtrack is utterly AMAZING i heard it the first time when i launched the game, instantly loved it.

The thought of steering the boat like in salt is awesome i feel like i am doing something to get the boat going. Not just steering while it goes automaticly <--i may spell that wrong

the base idea of the game is wonderful i cant imagine what future brings us.

Well that was the pros let's get to the cons :(

NOTE!!! i cant say much because of the Early access thing but i will try not be too judgmental

Cons: While the artstyle of the sea and islands is amazing... there can be more done to the npc. The npc are not that good with black hair and normal clothes. The shopkeeper and pirates have the same texture so u can mix those two up..as im saying this i dont know if there are any pirate bases. As i wanted a fight i found a hut with a pirate (as i thought) it was a shopkeeper..i bought a bow and recipe book.

There can be a more efficient hit detection on the bows and etc... 

And that Is all of the cons hope you learned something and hope you read most of it :D",1421939916,1421939916,True,1,1,0.502487540245056152,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Well, 18 months later, I have given Salt another run. A lot has improved -- graphics, combat, and quests come to mind, and the devs are on the brink of releasing multiplayer! But let's see how Salt fares with the specific items for which I docked it 18 months ago:

1. Environments: still lacking. While the game includes a greater variety of tropical and jungle islands, they do not differ very much, and there is still an overall lack of interesting places to explore on the islands themselves.

2. Activities: this has had a big overhaul. There are many quests, a litany of new pirate types and bosses, and ship customization! I still would like to see activities like cave and dungeon crawling, however.

3. Loot: Thumbs up! There far more quest-specific items, items from combat, and items to craft now.

4. NPCs/Creatures: there are more NPCs now, such as merchants and innkeepers, but the game is still heavily lacking in native biology beyond deer and spiders. They did add sea turtles, and I've seen screenshots of sharks (though never encountered them). 

5. Sailing has improved twofold. Fishing is still fun, but I love the ability to deeply customize your cruising ship, to manually map out the world (harkening back to windwaker), and to use cartographic tools like the sextant and the compass.

6. Music... better! But still a quiet game. I respect the developers' design decision to make it this way, but I cannot lie that I have a better experience while listening to tracks from Windwaker.

Conclusion: for the price, I do think Salt is now worth a buy, particularly with multiplayer so close. The game is a relaxing nautical adventure across a massive world, and I find myself returning to it again and again in the face of the usual chaotics that occupy the top sellers list on steam. But my recommendation comes with a heavy warning...

Development on Salt is SLOW. At the pace of development, it may be years yet until all of the promised content is delivered. The game now provides 10-15 hours of fun, and up to several dozen more depending on your tolerance for repetition. If you want more than that, Salt is no more than an investment. 

For me, it has been a sound investment, if only one that is taking its time to pan out.
/***************************/


This is early access, and while the game is quite stable and beautiful to me, it's also fairly empty. Islands contain mostly the same biome: a standard tropical environment with trees and bushes. Sometimes you'll find deer and rare resources. If you're lucky, you'll find some pirates on an island and some treasure chests. There is an early selection of loot to obtain. Other than that, after 4-6 hours you will have seen most of what there is to see. 

Nonetheless I love the premise and potential to this game. A massive, island-scattered world to calmly explore, with manual ship control and plenty of ships to build. The  Windwaker-styled art and seafaring give this game real character. It's all immensely exciting and I do think the developers will succeed. In many ways they already have, as I personally have had a swell time.

But before I can recommend it to the general gaming audience, it needs more of the following: 

- Environments. Snowcapped islands, deserts, volcanic peaks and flow, cities, etc. Exploration demands variety here.
- Activities to do on the islands. Let's see some dungeons and homes to explore, castles on cliffs, etc. Quests that aren't fetch quests.
- Loot: more weapons and armor and categories.
- More NPC's and creatures than just pirates and spiders and deer. I'd love to see the developers tap into various mythology for creatures to inhabit the islands and the sea, for example. Imagine leviathans occasionally slithering out of the deep sea and peaceful whales surfacing for air. 
- Speaking of the sea: there should be more to do while sailing. Whether that means interacting with creatures, dropping anchors, searching for treasure on the sea floor, anything to reduce the monotony would help. The fishing is good, but could be expanded.
- Music. The main-menu music is a beautiful, Elder-Scrolls-like tune. But music rarely plays in the game itself, and it needs to start a little more often.

The good news is the developer is targeting many of these features and the game is still early in development. I have high hopes for this title, and once I feel it has solved some of these issues, I will update this review accordingly.

I'll be assuming you know the general theme it contains.  

The time I spent playing Salt was incredibly relaxing. Like others have stated before, it's almost therapeutic. I believe this is what the game focuses on, instead of your typical Minecraft rip-off. Speaking of which, it's not a Minecraft rip-off. It's an exploration game of its own and definitely has a lot of potential to become an awesome and original game. 

If you're looking for a fast paced action game, Salt isn't the game for you. Salt is the game where you'll find yourself idling more often than doing things of major importance, but in my opinion that's what makes it so lovely. 

[u]Pros [/u]
-Relaxing
-Original Gameplay
-Open World
-Good Lighting
-Unique Water Dynamics
-Very 420 Friendly
-Arrow Physics
-Plenty Of Things To Do
-Bug-free (I haven't encountered anything)
-Dev's Seem Active
-Growing Mod Community

[u]Cons[/u]
-Strictly First Person
-No In-Game Mapping System
-Save files are not local (If you mess up, your items used while fighting will still be gone if you die)
-Delayed Response Time (barely noticeable)
-Pirates Are Landlubbers (they don't leave land)
-Unoriginal Textures & Goofy Models
-Animations need lots of work
-No Guidance (You're often left wondering ""What will I do next?"" and not in a good way)
-Unbalanced Difficulty (No Actual Combat Scaling)
-Mediocre Combat System

All in all, I downloaded the Demo and shortly after I made a purchase of the game. Is it worth the $15? That's debatable. The Demo contains a lot of what the full game has to offer and will show you all you need to know about how it plays. The game currently offers about 6-24 hours of gameplay before you get less inclined to play it. 

[b]My personal (possibly biased) review and summary: [/b]Salt is a great game for relaxing after a hard day, and it's the only game I find myself able to play in those moods where nothing seems to be entertaining. It's very smooth and runs great even on my crappy laptop.

Die Atmosph√§re ist wundersch√∂n mit den tollen Sonnenauf - und unterg√§ngen, den vielen unterschiedlichen kleinen Inseln und den vereinzelten Tieren. Beim genaueren hinsehen ist die Grafik der Vegetation noch nicht sonderlich gut aber das tr√ºbt den Gesamteindruck nicht wirklich.

Sammeln und Craften geht trotz des sehr rudiment√§ren Crafting-Huds einwandfrei und es gibt inzwischen schon eine Vielzahl an Gegenst√§nden, was sicherlich noch erweitert wird. Von Waffen bis hin zu Segelbooten wobei letzteres ein besonderes Feeling im Spiel hervorzaubert. Von Insel zu Insel schippern, die sch√∂ne Atmosph√§re genie√üen und einfach alles einheimsen was geht, was will man mehr...

Vereinzelt gibt es auf den Inseln auch St√∂renfriede in Form von Piraten die einem besonderes Loot geben und von Schl√ºsseln bis zu verschiedenen Schatztruhen kann man alles m√∂gliche finden. Am Anfang sind die Piraten noch Kanonenfutter aber das √§ndert sich im Lauf des Spiels merkbar, besonders wenn sie im Rudel auftauchen.
Nachts sollte man sich lieber aufs heimliche Meucheln verlegen denn die Nacht in Salt ist eine wirkliche Nacht, dunkel und absolut finster. Ohne Fackel oder Lagerfeuer sieht man so gut wie nichts, was die tolle Atmosph√§re nochmals steigert.

Alles in allem ist Salt trotz des sehr fr√ºhen Stadiums schon sehr gelungen und gut spielbar. Noch fehlen aber nat√ºrlicherweise viele Spielinhalte und Abwechslung, denn nun ist es nach einiger Spielzeit doch etwas zu ruhig und man hat zu wenig M√∂glichkeiten sich die Zeit zu vergn√ºgen.
Auch die Grafik im gesamten k√∂nnte sicherlich noch verbessert werden, besonders die Piraten!

Wer auf Survival-Games und Early-Access steht sollte zugreifen und alle anderen k√∂nnen sich die Gratis-Demo runterladen und alles antesten.

Between making a new boat, foraging for food, fending off pirates, and sailing off into the sunset, I have had hours fly by with ease before I even notice its happened. There isnt any building or magic or anything like that, the game is actually rather simple. It focuses solely on the exploration factor, with a small part on combat and ""survival"". Theres money and some merchants, ruins and ancient relics, pirates and giant spiders galore, but the primary focus on the game is sailing into the distance and finding new lands to explore. Honestly my only two issues so far are that the music does not play nearly often enough and that there isnt enough to do while sailing. These are seriously minor complaints and do not detract from the value of the experience as a whole, but they have to be said. The music is atmospheric and beautiful, but it rarely pops up. And sure, you can fish or manage your inventory while sailing, but if you want to go off into the wild blue yonder in a small sailing boat against the wind....youll be sitting there for a while. It would be nice to have some crafting or smelting or something to do during that time. Maybe charting a map or a captains log to fill out, something that fits the theme. Either way, it is still a truly wonderful experience and sometimes just sailing in itself passes the time. It isnt finished, but what it is has enough potential to make it easily one of the best exploration games of its genre. Honestly, the only reason I dont have 50+ hours dumped into the game by now is because I get so absorbed into each time I play it that I have to limit myself from playing on days I have to work, else I risk losing hours of time without realizing it!

Salt is a bit of a disapointment for me.  The whole point of the game is to explore, and let me just say that Salt IS a great exploration game.  However, most of the mechanics were poorly concieved and/or do not function well.  Combat is less than appealing, as there is very little to do besides click and swing your weapon repeatedly.  Archery is frustrating in the least.  Crafting is, if not well thought out, reasonable.  The killer is that you need to simply spend large amounts of time gathering resources with virtually no gaurentee that you will find them.  Logs spawn randomly, as far as I can tell.  I would love to see features where you can harvest wood from trees, and rocks from cliffs, but until then, your only way of gathering resources is hopping from island to island searching the ground for stuff that (hopefully) has spawned there.

Combat stinks, can't figure out how gravity affects arrows, and grinding for resources all take away from the truly fun exploration aspect.  I could tolerate this, but unfortunately the detract from the game dramatically.",1420852395,1420852395,False,54,3,0.730399787425994873,5,True,False,True,False,,,

Playing other games and trying to find a reason to play this one was limited. Going into the world and thinking you have the ability to forage is very limited in itself. Special objects are placed in the world for stone and so on, mining into a cliff isn't possible, look for a node (object) shaded the same color randomly laying around as the exposed cliff to mine with a pickaxe or in the earlier part of the game a club. Need wood? I would think cutting a tree down (which there are an abundance of trees on the islands) would give you some but that isn't possible, looking for wood chunks on the ground is the way it works, just run around the island and pick them up. Its a neat game, just wish it was structured differently.

The idea is that you awake on a small island with just enough supplies on it to make a raft.  With this raft, you can sail to a multitude of other islands and survive by hunting deer, knocking apples out of trees, fishing, or looting the inevitable Pirates that you will stumble upon.  You can make (or find and repair) larger boats as you gain supplies, and you can customize these boats with beds, crates, chests, torches for lighting, and even paintings.

The most fun I've had in a survival game in a long while!  Minecraft had some of the most primitive graphics but it was a ton of fun because you were able to mold the world to your liking.  In this game, you may not be able to mold the world like in Minecraft, but the world itself is so large (possibly infinite) that you will never run out of places to explore and things to do.  My favorite part so far has been to sail around islands to scope them out, then land at ones that I think have pirate villages and systematically wipe out the pirate population and take their treasure.

There are bosses in this game that you have to watch out for too - and vendors that you can find that will give you quests!  For an early access game, this one is definitely worth the price.  I have already gotten $15 of fun from it!  If open world survival games appeal to you, I'd definitely recommend this one.

Mainly the reason is because you spend time sailing between islands, I personally love this. I sail at night, and fish at night, and explore during the day.

 I like how the game has multiple ways of crafting things, so you're not confined to doing it one way. Don't like spiders? Just get the better plant fibers, and the same goes for wood and stone. As of yet it can be somewhat frustrating to find resources because you can't just chop a tree down, and not every rock you see can be mined. So this can cause some frustration, but if you're me, and enjoy a bit of challenge to scrounge for resources then this is just for you.

 The sea voyages can be lengthy if so choose and its nice, it gives you time to craft, fish and navigate. The game's features are ever expanding as this is early access so everything I love will only get better from here on out, for its price tag I fully recommend it.

Playing this game is supremely relaxing, personally reminding me of summers spent sailing the seas of Wind Waker.

Also in the latest update, you can customize your ships to your liking, and add a personal touch to your vessel, from the humble raft to the mighty Pardon Pusher. Finally, whether you are sailing between islands looking for resources, or searching for pirates to battle, or even just sailing through the vast ocean just to, well... sail, you can do so at your own pace. You can play casually and take your time, or you can take on a horde of pirates and be on the edge of your seat, vigorously fighting for your life. No matter what your play style is, there is always something new to find and places to explore. Trust me, your money is well spent on this game! If you do buy it, remember it is in early access, and there are plenty of new features to come in the future. Also remember that, as such, you may encounter some bugs during your travels. Be sure to help out the devs and let them know if you find something that doesn't seem right. And, most importantly, have fun in the great world of Salt!",1420056854,1420056854,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

But it's not really at all. There are a few similarities, maybe some inspiration as far as the sailing goes. Sometimes while playing Minecraft, sailing my little boat off into infinite oceans I wished...

For this game.

You start on an island. Your head hurts. You had been unconcious. A stranger has left you a note, and reccomends you leave your little island as soon as possible. You stumble around, getting your bearings. You pick up everything you see, you pick some fruit, you find a pickaxe and break some boulders and collect your belongings from a chest.
You have enough to make a raft and leave your tiny island, clumsily learning to sail for the first time, as you fight the wind and the tide.

You sail, you explore, you stop off at islands in desperate search for food. You craft, you fight. You manage to put together a fishing rod, and relax awhile. You build a sail boat, which is faster than your dingy raft. A compass. A sextant. Suddenly you feel more confident to explore even further.

I very much reccomend this game, it is very zen and relaxing. And once you are involved in it, fairly pretty. I'd like to be able to retexture it and that is really my only gripe with it at the moment. It's a game I'm rather comfortable sinking hours into and for the price, you really can't beat the experiance.

I'd also reccomend getting the 'Salt Charts' tool that someone made, it makes navigation easier on you. You can find it pinned in the Forum.",1419981102,1419981102,True,36,1,0.703485608100891113,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I originally reviewed this game within the first few months of release. Since then, they have delivered a very nice, very deep single player exploration game. I can not believe how many quests, treasures and just how much great content they packed into this game. 

But now there is multiplayer. And while at the time of writing this it is still on the test branch, I still have to say how great it is. Day 2 on the test branch and my wife and I had one minor bug where she saw a deer that I didn't. But after 4 hours of playing, we quickly forgot about it. All quests, loot and enemies were all sync'd perfectly. 

These guys guys have made a really great game that for the pricetag, is still like predicted (see below) hands down one of the best examples of an early access on Steam. 

Buy it. 
Gift it to a friend.
Enjoy.

**

This game is well on its way to being one of the best in the genre. As an early acess game, what has been presented thus far is nothing short of delightful. Highly stable for an early access game. Active dev team. And just flat out good ideas. If the devs do HALF of what they say they plan to do, this game will be everything the survival sandbox genre was missing.

Plus, it costs half of what most similar early access games cost, while its twice as stable and playable.

(Lavaboots, you're doing it right! :) )

Got an explore itch? Get this!
Got an adventure itch? Get this!
Got a crafting itch? Get this!

Sailing works wonderfully, not hard to get the hang of at all, and is a huge part of the game. 

So far, I haven't even seen/ noticed any bugs, and my machine is pretty low end. I still get good performance on medium graphics settings. FPS is still great, no chop, no lag. It seems the code is well engineered. 

If you are unsure about it, just download the free demo and give it a whirl, It's one of those game you didn't even know you were looking for until you tried it!

EDIT: Still Playing

Almost 90 hrs in now. We asked for maps, got maps. We asked for an editable journal, got that. Getting multiplayer sometime this year I think. The story line is there now, and it's pretty good. The graphics have seen updates, everything is still running good.

A good portion of the time, arrows seem to go through the NPCs...I could swear they do, at least. I've shot some of them dead-on and seen nothing happen to the NPC, besides them becoming aware of my presense.

To me, Salt was an insta-buy. Usually, I am hesitant about buying into an early access game, having gotten burned myself when devs would all but take the money and run. However, Salt is an early access gem, and I personally feel that this game will achieve huge things in the future.

The magic of Salt is it's atmosphere. Looking at the sun through a bamboo thicket and seeing the shadows stream through to the ground, wistfully shifting back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze. The way the ambient environmental sounds change as you travel from a beach into the inner part of an island. A quiet sunset that turns the sky a bright red hue. This game is dripping with cool scenery, and the Wind Waker-esque visuals really help it's case.

Oh, and speaking of Wind-Waker, Salt's gameplay reminds me of that game's wonderful open world sailing, mixed with (for those of you who are old enough to remember) exploring the island of Myst. But don't worry, there aren't any annoying puzzles. Salt is purely about achieving open world zen through gentle, thoughtful exploration. 

I've sailed to many islands in my short time with Salt, and I have to say that the procedural generation is amazing. Every island I've visited has been unique. Never have I seen a cookie cutter layout, or one of those Diablo 3 style map-is-the-same-but-ever-so-slightly-changed scenarios.

I feel that one of the reviewers here on Steam said it best when he likened playing Salt to the first time you fired up Morrowind. Like, ""WHOA. I've got this entire alternate world open to me?!"" It's that excited feeling you would get as a kid, entering into a fantasy world where you could just simply be. That feeling is one that Salt has in spades.

If there was a genre of ""relaxing survival"" this would be it. It's a very chill game, with no real immediacy involved, which I actually love. It's a nice change from the dime a dozen zombie survival games out there. Since you can't starve to death, and death has no terrible penalties, it's more focused on exploration than survival. My guess is that the survival aspects will evolve as the deveopers progress with produciton. 
I love sailing around the ocean in this game, it's very calming, and to me it sparks a more visceral imagination of being on a boat, unfurling the sails and going, quite literally, wherever the wind takes you.  

Of course as an early access game, there's a ton missing, and I frankly won't come back to this game until they've incorporated a map. The worlds are too vast, and there's far too many islands to take on without some sort of cartography. Also, combat hitboxes need some fine tuning, it's a bit difficult to hit things as it is now.

Knowing that water can freeze
Do you still want me to open?

To the waves you and me

We belong to the sea

A minute everlasting with you

We'll all be a drop

Will you dry me one day
Take me to the place where I came from
If I had a open heart
Would you tear that apart
Why do I feel that you're lonesome?

Les voyages d'√Æle en √Æle, √† la recherche d'items, peut s'av√©rer laborieux, mais c'est ce que l'on veut d'une jeu de survie.

Au niveau des graphismes, pas grand chose √† redire, c'est beau, c'est fluide, peut-√™tre deux ou trois choses √† corriger. Il suffit d'admirer un coucher de soleil pour se sentir l'√¢me d'un explorateur ( √† cela s'ajoute, les ruines, les coffres...).¬µ

Starting small, I began to experiment with what I found to see what I could craft with it.  It might be a good idea to gather materials for a campfire because nightime, until the moon rises, is very dark.  A basic crafting book was included in my inventory.  I found that starting with this book made the learning curve OK so far. I didn't have to find a log, pick it up and wonder what to do with it.  Making tools and weapons is critical. It's all about surviving first, more later.  Hotkeys made it quick to put what I needed in my hands.  I learn to make a basic watercraft and hit the seas!  (Salt water, I assume) Steering to an interesting looking island was difficult for me to learn.  Other people will certainly find it easier. The first unknown island introduced me to someone who seemed angry and determined to remove me.  He announced his attack with a little yelp, which I appreciated.  I hotkeyed to my neanderthal style club and engaged!

After some time running around, laughing at the terrible pirate models (Yes, they're cute, but I still don't like 'em.), failing to kill a deer, and not understanding how to craft at all, I finally make a raft. Then I sail around the islands that I started on for a bit. And then I get bored with that, and sail off into the endless void. Then the music kicks in. And I feel shivers down my spine. And I feel hope. Excitement. Joy. Elation.

Vous √™tes √©chou√© sur une ile d√©serte. Vous savez qu'Evangeline Lilly est aussi perdue quelque part sur une autre √Æle et vous attend impatiemment pour fonder une famille...

Ramasser des plantes pour cr√©er des potions et des bandages, combattre des Pirates et ramasser leurs fringues donnant divers bonus, constuire des bateaux ou r√©parer des √©paves seront votre lot quotidien.

En avan√ßant dans le jeu, on trouve des ruines et l'√©bauche d'une histoire, qui sera s√ªrement d√©velopp√©e dans l'avenir.

Certains PNJ comme les marchands donnent des qu√™tes, par exemple ramener de la viande de requin. Vous pourrez aussi trouver des cartes au tr√©sor et des myst√®res √† r√©soudre.

Les graphiques chatoyants heurtent un peu les yeux, mais on s'y habitue, tout comme les PNJ qui ont un furieux swag Playmobil. Le d√©veloppeur n'h√©site pas √† avouer qu'il n'est pas un modeur de personnages, mais qu'il en embauchera peut-√™tre un dans le futur.

Salt nous plonge dans une ambiance calme avec une exploration ouverte sur une √©tendue oc√©anique couvertes d' √Æles ou il vous faudra survivre et vous √©quiper afin de vous pr√©parer au mieux pour les combats. Les morceaux de musique sont bien choisis et relaxent le joueur. La libert√© d'explorer l'univers de salt est vaste et nous pouvons commencer par n'importe quelle √Æle , il n'y a pas de mission pr√©d√©finie , ici on peut naviguer ou l'on souhaite et la libert√© de mouvement est des plus excitantes. Les loots sont plut√¥t diversifi√©s et int√©ressants m√™me si nous sommes qu'en alpha et qu'ils vont certainement prendre une autre dimension lors des prochaines mises √† jour. Pour l'instant , salt me procure une exp√©rience de jeu unique ou l'on a envie de prendre son b√¢teau pour tomber sur un tr√©sor ind√©nichable. Le gros b√©mol selon moi du jeu r√©side dans sa facilit√© de se nourrir car celle-ci est tr√®s abonbante et peu rare pour un jeu de survie , ce qui rend salt assez simple dans son ensemble , il serait judicieux de rajouter de la difficult√© sur de nombreux domaines de jeu. La p√™che est assez int√©ressante globalement , quant √† la chasse , il serait b√©n√©fique de rajouter d'autres gibiers plus rares et davantage de fourrure. Conclusion : Salt est incomparable aux autres jeu de survie ,     ayant ador√© don't starve ! Salt est tout aussi excitant avec un d√©cor r√©aliste , il est graphiquement plaisant pour les yeux et salt incarne une libert√© de naviguation plut√¥t jouissive , non vraiment salt a de l'avenir devant lui , il vaut largement ses 15 euros , essayez-le : vous ne serez pas d√©√ßu !

Parenth√®se (je viens de p√™cher un dragonfish , un poisson tr√®s rare puisque c'est un loot bleu). Voil√† pour que le jeu soit √©pique , il faut nous donner la possibilit√© de p√™cher des poissons √©piques ou des tr√©sors sous l'eau , je suis s√ªr que le joueur aimerait davantage de surprise au niveau de la p√™che ou du craft , il faudrait aussi parvenir √† rajouter du contenu craft , d'autres livres √† looter ou nous aurions acc√®s √† de nouveaux crafts , je pense qu'il manque certains animaux comme des oiseaux (plumes) , des ours - mode agressif - (fourrure) , des singes (queues) , des renards (fourrure) , des serpents -mode agressif - (langues) ou encore des toucans (becs) nich√©s dans les arbres , voir des tortues de mer sur le sable (carapaces). D'autres arbres peuvent √™tes implant√©s pour r√©cup√©rer du bois extr√™mement rare avec une h√¢che. ce serait pas mal aussi de rajouter des bananiers ou des fruits exotiques , des noix de coco par exemple. On pourrait tout aussi bien rajouter sur certaines √Æles des coquillages sur le sable (collecte qu√™te). 

Quoi d'autres? certaines √Æles devraient avoir plut√¥t un type essentiellement montagnard avec pourquoi pas des acc√®s √† des grottes souterraines (eau souterraine) avec une surprise au bout. Une autre id√©e aussi me taraude l'esprit : il serait astucieux d'introduire des parchemins r√©cuper√©s soit sur des √Æles , soit sur des b√¢teaux √† la d√©rive (collecte qu√™te). Autre id√©e : j'ai pens√© avec une collecte de bois pour le craft qu'il serait tr√®s int√©ressant de crafter un ponton pour p√™cher en toute qui√©tude (bois , cordage ""fibres"" et autres...).
Pourquoi ne pas introduire un myst√©rieux personnage qui viendrait mettre sa tante sur une √Æle mais uniquement √† certaines heures de la journ√©e ou de la nuit , on serait tr√®s content de le croiser (rare) pour lui acheter de nouveaux livres (extension craft).
Introduire un homme pirate avec un crochet √† la main (Boss) ou on looterait un hame√ßon en forme crochet√© pour la p√™che (loot bleu 2% de chance d'√™tre consomm√©).
Introduire un homme pirate avec une proth√®se √† la jambe (Boss) ou on looterait une √©p√©e (proth√®se) rare avec des caract√©ristiques de combat.

Introduction de PNJs avec un pickaxe , une canne √† p√™che , un arc √† la main nous demandant de remplir certains conditions (leur ramener ce qu'ils veulent)
Introduction d'un PNJ bloqu√© sur une √Æle nous demandant de lui trouver son b√¢teau √©chou√©.
Application de fissures sur les falaises et massifs montagneux afin de justifier l'utilisation de bombes et pouvoir acc√©der √† des petites trouvailles.

Introduire de larges b√¢teaux pirates arr√™t√©s sur l'oc√©an , possibiliter de monter sur les b√¢teaux et combattre l'√©quipage avec un tr√©sor au bout et des cl√©s en or pour les ouvrir.
Introduire une jauge mentale pour la suite de l'aventure ne serait pas une mauvaise id√©e comme dans don't starve...
Introduire des insectes larges luminescents dans la nuit et looter une lampe rare qui serait fluo.
Introduire la possibilit√© de r√©cup√©rer du feuillage sur les arbres ou de la paille pour les futurs shelters (craft).

Introduire des petits √©tangs au sommet d'√Æles rocheuses pour y p√™cher des objets uniques.

Parvenir √† mettre en √©vidence une ou deux √Æles volcaniques (lave) avec une interaction et des loots sur place.
Penser √† √©tablir un puzzle qui reconstituerait un immense pilier qui sortirait de l'eau avec une surprise au bout.
Introduire dans le futur shelter une possibilit√© de stocker son mat√©riel et de se vider par la m√™me occasion du surplus de son inventaire.
Introduire dans le futur shelter un genre de barbecue pour cuire ses poissons et sa viande avec un bonus en combat ou faire cuire directement ses aliments avec un feu de camp.

Possibilit√© de se reposer dans le shelter et de faire passer le temps plus rapidement.
Possibilit√© de r√©cup√©rer des fossiles rares √† travers l'exploration (pnj qu√™te)
A partir de certains fossiles et os recuper√©s sur certains rivages : crafter des colliers faits de fossiles ou d'os.
Possibilit√© de crafter des coffres √† l'int√©rieur de son b√¢teau pour stocker du mat√©riel (maiden ship)
Eventuellement on pourrait croiser des pirates arm√©s et ils nous tireraient dessus √† distance ce qui nous obligerait √† adopter un sch√©ma plus tactique pour le combat.
Ce serait cool de pouvoir obtenir une plume (encre) dans le jeu et crafter du papier ou parchemin pour y mettre des notes , des informations.
Les vagues doivent pousser le bateau et ne pas le laisser au m√™me point de la carte ainsi que le vent , possibilit√© de crafter une ancre afin que le b√¢teau ne puisse plus bouger du tout ou d√©river.

Int√©grer plus de myst√®re lors des phases de nuit pour rajouter de la difficult√© au jeu.
Int√©grer des chapeaux √† nos pirates afin de les leur r√©cup√©rer (loot rare).
Int√©grer du brouillard , de la pluie et un temps nuageux par moment serait davantage int√©ressant.

Making a freely available demo is probably one of the smartest moves I've seen in a while from a small developer, as experiencing the gameplay turned my 'maybe' into a sale. 

The developers are incredibly responsive within the Steam discussion forum and listen to player input and suggestions. They do not seem to be trying to cash in and genuinely want to make a fun game for people to play. I wish more developers would follow in their style.

As far as the gameplay, it's a 'light' survival game with great colors and scenery. Sailing is an element which in my opinion is underutilized and the random generation of islands provides great potential.

'Great Potential' is essentially how I would summarize this game currently. Since the world is randomly generated from a seed it can be rather expansive but right now content and gameplay components may be found to be somewhat thin. I feel this is due to the true 'early access' nature of the title as new content comes with nearly every patch.

CON: the game has a view bugs that are pretty anoying.

PRO: unlimited terrain so no end in adventure!!!

PRO: amazing sunsets and terrain generating which really make the game more adventerous

It's early access and by no means near completeion, thus making it's price of ¬£11 quite a gamble.

My experience with the demo was fulfilling as someone who's looking for something calm, peaceful, and relaxing to play. Although mush of the game's content is missing from the demo (not surprising), it allowed me to get an insight into what the game has to offer me as of now, and what it may offer in the future.

It was satisfying to control my raft as I sailed across the waves between islands, and - aside from the simple, yet altogether beautiful, graphics - felt very immersive. 

My first encounter with an enemy, a pirate carrying a sword, was interesting - the combat in this game is simple and predictable, and provides users with the typical ""attack"", ""powerful attack"", and ""block"" features present in most games of this nature. Impressively, the combat in this game, although sometimes predictable (the enemy I fought only had one single attack) was an enjoyable quick break from the usual serenity of the rest of the game. Hunting, similarly, gives a small sense of achievement, and the rewards follow suit.

The scenery is very eyecatching and I have taken lots of screenshots of this game already, from the vast valleys in the islands to my boat drifting on the surf. There are substantial amounts of graphical settings which allows this game to be played on a wide variety of machines (and on high settings, I can safely say that I am impressed with what the graphics of this game has to offer).

Crafting in the game is easy and simple, as well as logical, and there's a decent variety of crafting recipies already. Like most games, there is a slight learning curve (not just in crafting, but in respect to the whole game), which serves as a little challenge for new players.

There is lots of content in the game already, which is surprising considering how new it is. The developers have promised future updates, however having had the game for such little time I can't vouch for them. Any improvements I'd like to see in the game are very likely to be added in the future.

Altogether, I find no bad points to make against this game. It does what is promised, and providing the developers stay faithful to their noteworthy creation, my rating of 10/10 shall stay as it is.

Please, before you purchase this game, do your own research. As with all early access games (and this game is VERY early access) you're paying for what a developer has promised you. I must say that the current game content is not worth ¬£11 - what the developers say they will be adding, however, works out as quite a good deal for ¬£11. Early access games are a gamble for the consumer, and this provides no deviation from that. Purchase with care.

I, myself, am glad to be a part of this game's development, and will be eagerly participating on the forums.

10/10. Let's hope it stays that way.",1414630933,1414630933,True,28,0,0.738080203533172607,0,True,False,True,False,,,

       The demo as far as I could tell is just the game in a confined space, so I suggest getting the demo and trying it out.

 One of the great things about this game is how the devs are very interactive (look at the discussions) with the players. It is also highly replayable since the main goal is exploration-even if you are trying to get the same things again the journey to those items will be different everytime. Of course there is also fishing, searching for loot and secrets or merchants, finding various tree fruits, hunting, gathering materials like wood and stone, etc.

The graphics for this game don't seem very good initially, but in reality they are fantastic. When you are actually playing they turn out to provide a very islandy tropical feeling. Even the balloon shaped pirates (of which there are different types) turn out to be nice. Also sounds are great - Crickets chirping, birds in the morning and after, ocean waves near the beach...   

Another thing is farther you get from land the bigger the waves get, which is just a nice little touch to have.

I personally have grown tired of the Zombie Survival games out there and Salt brings back a more realistic and exploring feeling without all the zombies. Although you may encounter a random giant spider sometimes, it's definitely not hard to kill and they don't lag around in any way. You will have to fight off pirates as well on certain islands, but there aren't hordes of them and escaping from them is usually pretty easy by just running back to your boat.  There are a couple different kinds of boats you can craft to get you to the several islands all different from eachother. Some having abundances of food and materials while others house pirates and other threats, you might even stumble upon some ancient ruins and find a nice simitar or sword. You may also stumble upon a pirate ship floating out in the ocean. These require some maintenece to repair and get working again and also hold a locked chest with valuble loot inside. Killing a pirate Captain granted me a key and I was able to access the chest in the ship but from what I have read you can get these keys sometimes from regular pirates or if you happen to come across a merchant, you can trade or buy one from him. It's the only thing thats really useful that they sell at the moment, The other stuff can be found quite easily. The worlds are created via seeds and anyone using the same seed will experience the same generated world. You must hunt and scavenge for food in order to keep yourself alive while sailing from island to island. Getting lost is probably one of the easiest things to do in this game especially if you have a urge to explore a lot like I do as exploration plays a huge role in Salt. Take note of the different types of Pirates you encounter. One I found to be really useful was the Cartographer Pirate.  Upon killing and looting his body I was able to get my hands on a compass which really made things a lot easier when it came to navigating the almost identical looking islands. The game is single player only which is one thing that bummed me out a bit as I would love to be able to explore this world with a friend, but it is still very interesting. As far as graphics go, The art syle is great, the textures and models aren't that impressive until you see a sunrise or sunset which can really make things look beautiful. Overall the game looks very promising for its future and I will definitely continue playing this. The developers are very active with the community in the forums and I see them replying to almost every post which is what we all love to see with these Early Access games. I definitely reccomend picking this game up if you like Survival and Exploration games. You won't be dissapointed. 
Please take note. This early access and there will be bugs. Don't purchase unless you understand this.

The developers are constantly improving 'Salt' so you can count on new updates being released regularly. This is my go to game when I feel the need for adventure and exploration. Permadeath can suck but each turn is always different and the loot you find varies! 

I have a lot of survival and exploration games and lately I haven't been too excited about any of the early access or new releases. That changed completely when I saw 'Salt' enter early access. I knew, from the videos and description, that this was going to be a great game.

Let me start of this review by saying that this is one of, if not, my favotite game of this year. Why? Because it's unique and takes a very simple concept that alot of people have wanted for a long time and makes it fun and enjoyable even in its early stages.

----Gameplay----
The gameplay of the game is similar to games like 'Minecraft' where you gather items and craft them although this isn't a voxel game so don't expect any digging. You start with nothing and have to gather wood and plant fibers from around your little island to make equipment but you don't have to look too far as somewhere on your island will spawn a chest that gives you the essential items to build a small raft which you can use to explore other islands.

---Combat---
The games combat system is currently buggy and not great but for early stages it works ok, it's your basic left click attack and right click block or for items such as the dagger left click is another attack. You can dodge which is something you should do often as they do do quite a bit of damage and without a good weapon they will lower your health fast before you can lower theirs.

---Sailing---
The one key aspect of this game which makes the game what it is. It's simple, you hold 'E' on the wheel or paddle and use the mouse to steer manually, you will have to recenter yourself if the waves knock your ship or if the wheel/paddle isn't straight.

---Crafting---
Currently all I know of the crafting is the basic guide you are given at the start which gives you essential things such as Clubs, rafts and other items so I can't comment on how much you can craft but I have found few things not on their such as the compass.

---Other Things---
Across the vast ocean you will come across broken ships which you will need to repair in order to use them and on the ship are chests which you can open if you have a key which can be obtained via pirates on islands, you can also obtain gold for merchants off them. I believe you will find 1 pirate per campfire so be warned if you see quite a few. 1 Variation of a pirate are the 'Pirate Captains' which are more powerful and have more health so be warned. There are also wildlife such as deer on the islands and their meat replenish alot of hunger. There are also merchants but I am currently unsure of their wereabouts.

---Things I hope will be in it---

Multiplayer: Obviously, who doesn't want to sail across the vast ocean with their crew, maybe even mmo type servers with PVP.

Workshop: Maybe have a character creator for online similar to Minecraft. Maybe even custom worlds and stories.

More Items: The more items the better!

More Ships: The more ships the better!

---Conclusion---
This is a must buy game for survival and pirate lovers as it truly is a great game.
I give the game a 9/10 for being fun, unique and really well thoughtout.

If you ignore the graphical glitches for now as its ""Alpha"" the game is pretty awesome. the developer has said they will be putting weather and more variety into the game which will just make things even better.

Only feature i would ask for is the abilitty to chop down trees for wood rather than scavenging wood. Other than that i would reccomend this game to anyone who likes open world/sandbox games.

Salt is a game about exploring randomly generated islands. 
It offers almost purely exploration gameplay. And for some reason it is extremely captivating (maybe because I love exploring).
The graphics are not too impressive, but from time to time you can find some nice scenery (sunsets and sunrises are pretty awesome too).
There is hunting, although at the moment there are only deers to hunt. There is fishing, but I'd found just roaming around to be way more fun. 
There is trading, you can actually stumble upon merchants and sell the things you don't need, or buy something you want. Although, so far they wasn't too useful.
There is combat, but it's pretty basic (think minecraft style of doing things).
And then, there's Exploration. Where you can just spend countless hours roaming around the seas and poking around different islands to find another chest, or another fancy item laying around. It's very, very fun (again, if love exploring).
Upcoming quests, new biomes and other cool things will only make it better.

On the downsides: 
- combat is way to simplistic and could use a bit more depth (again, it's not the main thing in the game as I already said).
- graphics are still quite glitchy on some GPUs (but devs are aware and fix is coming soon)
- UI is not the best one out there (especially if you are playing on a large screen/have bad eyesight)
- controls for boat could use some refinement

you make your first raft, sail to another peaceful island, get some more resources.

You decide to rest for the night, so you find an island and sleep. As you wake you explore this new island, while you gather apples, you notice a sound and OH SHIT THERE ARE MOTHER FU*KING PIRATES!!!!! DIE BITCH DIE!!! IL BASH YOU WITH MY CLUB!!!!!
You hide on your boat, watching them wait for you to return to the shore,

Al ser un juego de acceso anticipado me es muy dif√≠cil calificarlo, en Salt despiertas en una isla desierta, con solo una nota acerca de lo que tienes que hacer. Recolectar suministros en la isla y junto con los materiales del cofre crear un bote, con un dise√±o gr√°fico bastante bueno para ser acceso anticipado (a excepci√≥n de los PNJs) el juego tiene potencial de ser a√∫n mejor.
Un vasto oc√©ano con miles de islas por explorar en 3 tipos diferentes de botes (se a√±adir√°n m√°s en la versi√≥n final) con multitud de materiales y objetos diferentes que puedes Crear/Comprar/Encontrar en los diferentes lugares que visitas, a falta de un objetivo por completar excepto explorar todas las islas el juego tiene contenido para mantenerte jugando por horas.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-Un sistema intuitivo de creaci√≥n y descubrimiento.
-Miles de islas por explorar con cientos de cosas por hacer.
-La versi√≥n final a√±adir√° misiones, diferentes barcos y diferentes climas.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-El dise√±o de los personajes es bastante malo respecto a el resto del juego.
-Los PNJs y animales presentan una especie de ""Bug"" al moverse o intentar huir.
-Hacen falta m√°s objetos o un ""libro de recetas"" m√°s completo.

[h1]Conclusi√≥n:[/h1] Si hay un juego en acceso anticipado que vale la pena comprar ese es ""Salt"" pues a pesar de los min√∫sculos errores que el juego presenta tiene muchos m√°s aciertos, especialmente tomando en cuenta que estar√° en acceso anticipado hasta mediados del 2015, tiene bastante potencial y como manera de pasar varias horas y divertirse, Vale la pena.

Le jeu propose une map al√©atoire, de r√©cup√©rer du loot , d'en miner en faisant attention aux pirates.
Il y a des cerfs pour manger.
Ce qui est top c'est de partir en radeau j'adore ainsi que le son sans la musique.

Coming from someone who has bought almost every survival early access game in search of the perfect one. I think I finally found it. Who could have thought that a game this engrossing could only be 66MB? 

If you want a survival game that does not have zombies and instead focuses on actually surviving, do yourself a favor and drop the money on this. 

I was very skeptical as the videos seemed like frame rate was choppy. The game is actually very smooth and fluid. The videos didn't display the great foraging and crafting. From the time I booted it up I could not stop playing this. Sure there is a learning curve but you aren't worried about someone sniping you in the back while you try to figure out how to build a fire.

I am in awe. This is no fanboy review; I just bought it on a whim tonight. VERY PLEASED!

I had an interesting first experience in that my ship went flying off into the sunset (see the video below), but stuff like that happens in Alphas/Betas so I'm not too worried about it (the game isn't expected to leave Early Access until Fall of 2015). The game does have some growing to do obviously, but I like the idea of exploring a bunch of islands and seeing what all there is to see.  It's one of the reasons I'm so hooked on ""Planet Explorers"".  Will most certainly revisit to see what else the game has to offer and am looking forward to future updates.

It has the adventure that games like ""minecraft"" (And other crafting/surviving games) are so badly missing. 
Theres only a tiny bit of hand holding to get you started, then your on your own. Some people might cry about it, but its about perfect for most. Takes a few minutes to get your barings, but theres not much you can't figure out after that.
Crafting system is fairly limited at the moment, but early access and all that jazz.
As it stands right now October 2014, its a very playable game. Combat is bare bare bones, but again, it works.

So to sum it up-
Positives
Fun ocean adventure
island exploring
crafting & light mining
combat (with pirates!)
sailing
hunting elk
worlds can be random generated
game runs very well on my mid grade laptop
no one telling you how to play or where to go
the dev seems (so far ((My opinion)) ) like a decent person who wants to make a great community involved game. 

Negitive ...
Basic bare bones combat
not a lot of crafting (yet)


Thats about it. They have a great demo, give it a try. The demo itself, could be relased as a small game on its own and be better than a lot of the other early access games.
So take it from me, 
a 30 year old man with a beard, 
I strongly recommend this game.",1413435536,1413435536,True,39,0,0.69940108060836792,3,True,False,True,False,,,

The game is all about exploration, adventure, and discovering the game's world mysteries, and less so on survival (but it is still there)

You start off on an island with nothing, where you collect all the resources you need survive and start your journey, and by 'start your journey' i mean make a nice little charming raft so you can set sail to explore the seas and check out other islands for to gather more resources to craft even better items like an actual boat, or a glowing moon rock sword, and not just gather resources but also search for and unravel the games bysteries and secrets to learn more of the game's lore, and get nice rare ancient items.

You will also encounter pirates and animals and hostile creatures that you can attack for either getting better armor/weapons, meat to eat, or items to help you craft a new item (or a ship.. but won't spoil that for you ;) )

The only bad thing about the game so far is the melee combat, you could say it's bare bones basic, and needs a lot of work.

The game is an exploration adventure game in it's purest beautiful form, and will say it's hands down the best game that does it best, with mysteries to look out for, and a since of wonder when look at a distant land.
