Ein kurzes aber hervorragendes Videospiel, das offensichtlich mit Liebe und revolutionärem Eifer entwickelt wurde. Aber ich muss ein Paar Wörter in Bezug auf dessen Empfang von den reaktionären Kreisen sagen, den man auf den Diskussionsforen lesen kann. 

Die Abneigung der reaktionären Bourgeoisie gegen Tonight We Riot und ihre Vorliebe für die sogenannten ""unpolitischen"" Spiele sind nicht erstaunlich. Aber erstens muss man nicht vergessen, dass wenn die Bourgeoisie von den unpolitischen Spielen/Filmen usw. spricht, hat sie jene Spiele vor, in denen der Status quo nicht infrage gestellt wird. Für sie gelten Spiele ""unpolitisch"", solange in derartigen Spielen nur die grobe und billige Kultur des Neoliberalismus herrschend ist. Für die Bourgeoisie ist es ohne Bedeutung, auch wenn solche Spiele selbst höchst politisch ist. So heuchlerisch ist unser Neoliberale.

Jedenfalls, die Bourgeoisie hofft in Videospiele auch das 'Opium' zu finden, durch das sie das Proletariat - und besonders dessen jugendlichen und klassenunbewußten Mitglieder - einschläfern möchte, das anderenfalls 'begehrlicher' und unlenksamer wird. Die den Status quo und die kapitalistische Gesellschaft nicht infrage stellenden Videospiele sind für herrschende Klasse gerade deswegen in Mode gekommen, weil sie ihr eine geistige Waffe im Kampfe um Dasein liefert. 

Es ist eine bekannte Tatsache, dass die unterdrückte Klasse oft die unterdrückende Klasse nachahmt. Aber wann tritt diese Nachahmung ein? Wenn die unterdrückte Klasse noch nicht revoltiert oder schon nicht mehr revoltiert. Diese Nachahmung ist bezeichnend für den Mangel an revolutionärem Gefühl auf seiten der unterdrückten Klasse. Und dies ist das bloße Gedanke, die bloße Hoffnung der Bourgeoisie, die diese Nachahmung möglichst lange bewähren will. Deswegen ist deren ad nauseam Bestehen auf ""unpolitische"" Videospiele. Hier liegt die soziale Wurzel deren Feindlichkeit gegenüber den klassenbewußten und umstürzlerischen Spiele wie Tonight We Riot.

---

A short yet a wonderful video game that's apparently made with love besides revolutionary zeal. But I also would like to say a few things on its negative reception by the reactionary circles, which can be read on the discussion forums.

The antipathy of the reactionary bourgeoisie against the games like Tonight We Riot and its fondness for the so-called ""unpolitical"" video games are nothing surprising. But first of all we must not forget that when the bourgeoisie speaks about ""unpolitical"" games, movies etc. they mean games, in which the status quo is not questioned. For them video games are ""unpolitical"" so long as those video games move within the coarsened and cheapened cultural parameters of neoliberalism. For the bourgeoisie it doesn't matter even if such video games themselves are in fact highly political. So hypocritical is our neoliberal. 

Anyway, the bourgeoisie hopes to find the 'opium' also in video games, by which he wishes to numb the proletariat (but especially its young and class-unconscious members), who would otherwise might become more 'desirous' and ungovernable. Video games that neither question the status quo nor the capitalist society has come into vogue precisely because they supply cultural ammunition to the bourgeoisie in its fight against the proletariat.

It's well known that the oppressed class often imitates the oppressing class. But when does this imitation take place? When the oppressed class has not yet revolted or no longer revolts. This imitation is significant for the lack of revolutionary zeal on the part of the oppressed class. And this is the very idea, the very hope of the bourgeoisie, who means to make this state of conditions enduring as long as possible. That is why their nauseating insistence upon 'unpolitical' video games. Here lies the social roots of their hostility against class-conscious and revolutionary games like Tonight We Riot.",1703187915,1703190168,True,6,0,0.56506049633026123,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's exactly what you expect, really. A rather short game about the oppressed workers rising up to overthrow a shitty capitalist system that runs the planet into the ground, with the money funnelling up as the workers are paid jack-shit, the same people who keep the gears of that system running living in awful conditions as the rest of the world who hold any degree of wealth can sit on the sidelines and pretend everything is fine in their idyllic little suburbs.

Anyway, I get ahead of myself. It is very blunt, a bit hammy, and i found it really fun. It's a bit difficult to control at times and I believe that is intentional. A mob of angry, disenfranchised workers marching through areas and fighting police while trying to reclaim their lives is, I imagine, very fucking difficult to control in real life :v
They will attack when you attack, throw the things you throw. You control a random revolutionist (indicated by a bright red flag with a yellow star) and everyone will follow you. If you die, you take control of a new one. As they say, ""As long as one of us lives, the revolution lives on.""
naturally there's a bit of satire in this game, too. Like the militarised police force getting fucking mech suits that you end up taking down with nothing but dozens of bricks from angry revolutionists, with maybe a few pipewrenches or bombs thrown in there.

The cops don't get mech suits in real life, sure, but I'm sure I can recall a few stories where the streets of one place was unsafe to walk openly for about 2 weeks due to the amount of teargas the cops used..

Music is great, too. I love some of the pieces being these kinda slow, uneasy tracks that have an air of suspense to them and it all shifts to just this raw feeling of *violence* when the combat picks up. Great stuff, honestly.

It's short, you can probably already guess where the ending goes. But I find this game.. Cathartic, is the word I would use. It satisfies a sort of primal thing in me that desires to see this world be a better place, at least to some small degree.
There's even some dev stuff in here, in the endless mode, where they go off on a bit of a tangent. Things about the (still on-going.) pandemic, the protests at the time, and some other things. 
I think, deep down inside, we all want this world to be a better place. A safer place. A place where we can believe that we could bring another generation into life and know they'll be okay.
as they say in the game, ""In the meantime, we just want to say that violent revolution is only inevitable when peaceful revolution is impossible.""

I think it's pretty obvious who would buy this game, and who wouldn't Who would praise it, and who would.. well. YKnow. You've seen the second review they featured on the store page description, right? I recommend it. Even if not for it's political messaging and some moments I found genuinely amusing. Even if it's just for it's kinda short, sometimes jank managing of an angry crowd hurling bricks and spanners at opponents who are way better armed than you.",1660949556,1660949556,True,12,0,0.594384491443634033,0,True,False,False,False,,,

把搞事题材一本正经的做成了游戏，题材很抢眼。
搞事团队的人群模式也挺符合定位，任何带头人倒下，只要你团队里还有人就可以继续操控带队前行。
敌人有各种枪械电锯什么的高级武器，但是搞事团只能用板砖和燃烧瓶这种基础武器实在是……
当然因为主角光环，用着最落后的武器还是所向睥睨。
有些关卡甚至不需要怎么击杀，直接跑到终点就行了。
投射瞄准非常随缘，没什么手感可言，实际玩过之后感觉就是个胡逼游戏。

- Unique gameplay. While on the surface the game seems like a simple sidescroller the gameplay has a bit more to it thanks to its crowd mechanics, while you only directly control a single character you'll almost always be followed by crowds of workers, the bigger your crowd the stronger you are as they'll throw projectiles in unison with you and act as your lives system, as long as you have more people in the crowd death just means switching to another worker, you're incentivised to care about your AI collective as they give you power and health.
- Good weapon variety. You have a bunch of different melee weapons (fists, wrench, chainsaw to name a few) and throwables (bricks, molotovs, axes, bombs, etc etc) with different strengths and visual impacts, new weapons are unlocked by getting the top rank in each level (the more of your workers that survive the higher the rank, so you have to work hard to keep them alive) so they serve as good motivation to not just carelessly speedrun.
- Solid enemy roster. In addition to regular mooks you have to face down extra challenges like gun turret trucks that can mow your revolutionaries down if you’re not crafty and water cannons that can physically push you back across the level, plus various boss monsters and enemy commanders (with the unique bonus that if you kill them before killing the mooks under their thumb, they join your team, netting you some bonus workers).
- Sweet soundtrack. 80's style Synthwave, seems almost like something out of Far Cry Blood Dragon or Kung Fury, perfect backing tunes for a revolution.

Cons
- Short length. While the game was long enough to be enjoyable and worthwhile, I would've liked a little bit more content, the game has 4 areas, each with 4 levels and a boss, it took me only an hour and a half to get to the boss of area 3, roughly 4 hours total to finish the game because I was going for 100% (all achievements, which means a few secrets and getting the top ranking on every level) and then I spent around an hour playing the Permanent Revolution (a single map survival mode), maybe 1 or 2 more areas would’ve helped but each level is unique enough to carry some replay value.
- Could do with bigger crowds. The crowd mechanics in the game are unique and fun to work with, but even at their max the crowds are fairly small, 10 or 15 workers max, having much bigger crowds combined with much stronger enemy forces would’ve better reinforced the collectivist theme the game is going for I feel, and made the idea of living or dying on the strength of your crowd more powerful.
- Local co-op only. The game has a 2 player mode, but you can't play online so I had to stick to solo, bit of a shame.

Tonight We Riot is a fun little sidescroller with some unique gameplay and fairly cheap pricing, it could’ve done with a few more levels in my opinion but I still feel like I got my money’s worth and I’d recommend it as a product. Of course if you’re a right winger, conservative or something along those lines you won’t like the theme of this game so maybe steer clear (unless you can look past the politics and just enjoy the gameplay of course), but then I imagine the devs didn’t intend it for anyone in that audience anyway, the game is proudly leftist and politicised and makes no apologies for it. 

I’m a bit biased towards the game's sentiments myself but you can be apolitical or something else and still have a bunch of fun with it, it's fiction, people who are outraged that this game depicts rioting probably would have no problem killing and bombing dozens in any number of other games which depict murders, wars and all sorts of other violent deeds as long as they had a more right wing or neutral angle, the devs of this game just decided to come along and represent the other side for a bit, I don't see the issue with that, go look for something else if it's not up your alley.

At the end of the day the game is about smashing pixelated thugs and their stuff to bits with a simple but fun combat system, we all like a bit of digital chaos from time to time, so what’s not to like? TWR is just an enjoyable, easy to get to grips with retro style game, a good bit of fantasy catharsis for anyone who’s not in the 1%.

This game is a light-hearted representation of what happens when those at the bottom have had enough of being exploited by those at the higher classes such as those who steal the productivity surplus the worker created in the form of profits for the company owner.  
The solution we'd seek is worker liberation from their boss masters, capital owners, and the state to create worker direct ownership of their workplaces.

Truthfully, not really, but at the same time... my experience playing Tonight We Riot on my computer was much more enjoyable... somehow?

What can I say about the game. In terms of aesthetics, I love it. Music is nothing worth writing home about, the dialogue flows between leftbook meme-ry and outdated cringe (with some diamonds in the rough in-between), characterization is barely a thing. Gameplay is serviceable although it is kinda meh that you can easily 100% the game within 4 hours.

That having said, the game fails giving you the impression that you are playing as the masses thousands united strong, not so much due to the lack of physical numbers but more due to how your comrades have the AI of someone who likes to walk towards their death. Plenty of times throughout the game, you are kinda babysitting your crowd lest you wish to be left with only a few including yourself at the end of the level.

Politically speaking, the game fails to champion the ideals or worldview it wants to uphold and display through its gameplay, world-building, et cetera. The catharsis element, while present, is rather superficial...

Basically, I have a lot of grievances with Tonight We Riot when it comes to it presenting itself as THE ""unapologetically leftist game"" or as THE ""revolutionary leftist game"" because its over-emphasis on being ""fun"" and overtly whimsical in a bonafide millennial manner takes away the introspection, analysis and serious approach the game's subject matter deserves--something that is absent in most forms of media let alone video games.
As a video game, if you can overlook the price tag, it is fun. It is enjoyable. It has Co-Op, so you can beat the bourgeoisie to the curb with a friend if you feel like rioting tonight.

Overall, I would recommend the game on the condition that those charmed by the game's premise should not allow themselves being easily blinded by the game's political eclecticism and meme-ry. If you do that, you get to enjoy a couple hours of wacky crowd brawlin' anti-capitalist style albeit do not expect coming out of it thoroughly inspired or imbued with strong sensations of emotion.",1617740700,1617752533,True,13,0,0.602538228034973145,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you're getting this game, you're probably already buying what they're selling (if you'll excuse the ironic metaphor), but there's a lot to this game that makes it worth playing beyond its politics. 

I'm not usually a fan of beatemups but the way the game is built around controlling a mob, giving you tons of lives with low healthbars and having you play all those lives at once, leads to something much [b] punchier [/b] than the more traditional brawler where you and your enemies beat each other for hours until one of you collapses.
There's so much variety here too, pretty much every stage is introducing new mechanics and is just long enough to explore them fully but not too long to where they become boring or test the player's patience when replaying them for unlocks. 
The unlocks themselves add a fair bit of replay value and optional challenge to the game, it's actually pretty difficult to get through most of the levels with enough workers left for them, and all of them change up the gameplay in some way, giving you new weapons and buffs.
It's a pretty short game (easily <2 hours), but  the game reaches a satisfying enough conclusion, narratively and gameplay-wise, and also gives me enough reasons to come back to it that I didn't feel ripped off when it was over.

Music: I love it. The music sounds really good, fits the general environment, and was the first thing I noticed when booting up the game. It's absolutely amazing to listen to.

SFX: eeeehhh... I feel the 8-bit sound effects clash heavily with the music. The music is much higher fidelity than the sound effects, and the constant blips from the sound effects kind of takes away from the game, in my opinion. I'm sure there are people that like that, or at least don't mind that, but I like all sounds in a game to be consistent.

Writing: This is where I expected more than I probably should have. The writing more or less feels like the ancom wet dream, which if I knew to expect that, I probably wouldn't have minded. However, when I see a game promoting communism so brazenly, I kind of hope that it'll at least have subtleties, actually spending time trying to convince the player that this is what needs to happen if they don't want to be subjugated to a rich ruling class for the rest of their lineage. It's very much direct and not all that... well, interesting. It lacks nuance, character development, or semi-realistic interactions between revolutionaries and police, which kind of kills it for me.

If you play with a controller, movement with the joystick is much better, but aiming with the controller is an absolute joke. It's nearly impossible to consistently hit things with your thrown weapons unless you use the mouse, but then you are stuck with the clunky movement the keyboard controls give you. I don't know why the controller doesn't just give you a target like the mouse does, but it instead just lets you throw things in a general direction and hope for the best, leading to constantly over or under shooting your target with no apparent way to adjust the length of your throw.

Tonight We Riot is a very competent pixel art side scrolling brawler. Art looks good, game is fun but a bit difficult, which reminds me of the arcade days when I play this kind of game over and over. If you are looking for a good brawler game, this would be the choice.

Politics:
Now this is the real review. The developer of Tonight We Riot wants to make a political game, which is a very fair objective. Given we have so many games celebrating colonialism, conquering of minorities, etc. It is only fair that a game should represent communism. 

Since there is a game mode of permanent revolution, I think the developer might be Troskists?

However, I think the game suffers from the same issue as those who the developer doesn't like. For e.g., all enemies are dehumanised so the player don't need to feel bad when killing them. The main enemy (capitalists) are all white, blonde, and look cartoonish evil. This reminds me of many FPS games which portray coloured people as irrational religious fanatics. Even though the subject is different, the effect is the same.

As for its story, Tonight We Riot also presented a simplistic view. Workers are oppressed, capitalists are evil, therefore workers must take direct action to overthrow the evil regime. Critique of capitalism is good and much needed. It is also true that the institutions almost always favour those with capital. What the game lacks is discussion of what happens after you overthrow a capitalist regime. Factories don't run themselves, so do the state takeover all production and regulate consumption of resources? History of Stalin and Mao tells us that does not really work, or at least lead to intense suffering of millions of people. 

In order for communism to be implemented, the state must have near absolute power over individuals in order to abolish capitalism. After assuming power, will those in power give up their power to implement a democracy, or will they just stay in power forever, fearing that giving up power will lead to death? History has pretty much told us the answer.

I think in the end, the game is a success and it did provoke a lot of thoughts from me, It is also a good addition to game diversity. What I find disappointing is the lack of nuanced discussion of actual politics in Tonight We Riot. Instead it just went the same route as other games: dehumanising enemies so players don't need to think too much about it.",1601825242,1601825242,False,24,11,0.475679904222488403,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The levels are short bite-sized skirmishes and there's a rock-paper-scissors feel to changing around weapons to suit whatever enemies show up.  You're scored on how many workers survive each level, and new riot gear is awarded when a certain threshold of workers is saved.  This offers a Mega Man style gear progression through the game, as your mob of workers and your personal guy both get much more powerful with various upgrades.

I liked that the developers let you convert chainsaw guys by offing their overseers and let you give a can of Popsi to friendly riot cops.

On Gameplay: I initially found the movement/attacking mechanics a little float-y and frustrating but by the time you reach the final world the game has (mostly) helped get you used to the eccentricities of moving your workers and getting them to throw bricks in the right direction. There's definitely enough enemy variety and little twists to keep the linear experience fresh. The unlockable gear for completing levels with as few worker casualties as possible incentivizes some nice replay value and makes you think about how to tackle obstacles in slightly less pyrrhic fashion. Unfortunately, they also make finding the right tool for the situation (bricks always) in your inventory quite a bit more difficult and mouse-wheeling in search of molotovs was consistently my biggest peeve. Endless mode is a nice add-on but I wouldn't say the mechanics are strong enough to warrant much time spent on that.

Seriously, I was already convinced to buy it since  before the release, but seeing the shitstorm of alt-righters, libertarians, conservatives, tradpeople or whatever edgy liberals call themselves nowadays, I couldn't help but give extra attention to this game.  I mean, the game is made by a small company with a collectivist work policie, how could it possibily hurt the fanclub of DA GREATEST SYSTEM EVAH that bad?

I still don't understand, but I can tell about my experience with the game, so you may buy it if you like.

The game itself is quite simple, you're a bnuch o rioting workers fighting a caricature of an oppressive corporate system, commanded by an evil businessman who came straight from some 90s cartoon. Nothing complex or nuanced about it, but you can see that's intentional. I don't mind, most gamers seem to fail when it comes to see politics in anything more subtle than that. You sidescroll, you break shit, you kill pigs, you tear boots, you save people to fight along your side.  It mixes classic bet 'em up games (although it's more missile than melee-oriented) with a pikmin style of moving other protesters, which can be used tatically. There's an interesting variety of weapons and enemies, therefore a nice variety of tatics to play and make your way towards a better society. As you progress through the levels, you free workers from factories and they como to fight along you and when you do so, aswell when you finish a level, you raise a flag that resembles  the one used by asian farmers that used to kick some ass back in the 60s/70s. A lovely touch. 

To get higher  scores, it's important to save as many  workers as you can and keep them alive to the end of each level, which is rewarded with more gear that boosts your chances of winning in the next level. Having many workers along your side is also useful, because if you die, you just assume the control of another worker. Those are my favourites things about the game, you're not rewarded for your mindless violence, but for saving workers and the revolution don't die with an individual, but when there's no one left to fight.

Does it have some thumbs down?
Yes, I felt like the game is too short, I could play the for more hours without getting bored, it has an infinite mode that I haven't tried yet, but I'll wait to play it with some friends in co-op mode.

Anyway, it's a great game, you won't regret throwing some bucks at Pixel Pushers Union.

Communism and socialism is all the rage nowadays with the worthless beta leftists of society lately. Having this ridiculous fantasy glorified in this format is rather irresponsible.

You market this to fools who will purchase it, and look what you are doing, developers... engaging in Capitalism. The system you hate so much. You'll take the losers money that reside in their parents basement who believe in this nonsense, however, wont you?

As idiotic as this game is in theory, I actually had to play it for 6 minutes just to review it, and whether I agree with ""pixel pushers 512's"" ideology or not, it is absolute trash. The purchase of course, was solely to refund it and voice my opinion, but in playing it, I can see that it was programmed and developed by people as inept at making games as they are at rational thought. Anyone who believes antifa is an organization worth supporting is obviously not capable of cognitive thought, and it translated to a rather abysmal game.

I controlled the little avatar a bit, just to allow the Police beat her to death with the baton (and rather liked that, if only to watch them get what they deserve in pixels) and the AI apparently is entirely non-existent. I had to actually move the losers holding that commie flag directly towards the Police for them to hit them. While I would have liked to see more gore from their enjoyable deaths, I suppose since its 1980s nintendo level graphics you cannot ask for much realism. Its as if these people who decided to create this garbage put almost no effort into actually making a game, and are relying on the ideology to push it along to be a money maker.

Not just because how unapologetically leftist it is, but in the small size and cartoonishly violence range of weapons reminded me of many a flash game I used to play online. There's a nice range of enemy types and nice level variety for a game of this size. Early on it can be kind of a grind making it through levels, but once you start unlocking upgrades, it's easier to go after the really tough enemies. Also, the weapons selection method can be kind of annoying. I found myself accidentally tossing bombs when I thought I selected something else. But I mostly used a keyboard for that, so your mileage may very.

Overall, if you've been waiting for a really leftie game, or maybe just want to check out a different sort of retro brawler, you could do far worse.

VISUALS AND SOUND:
The aesthetics were inviting and the music blended well with the game. I enjoyed some of the references and googled some others that appeared in game. Sometimes things felt too on-the-nose, and I'm more of a subtlety kind of guy, so that's a little pet peeve of mine.
CONTROLS:
I didn't find myself having too much fun with the controls at first. 
They were fine, I guess, but didn't feel quite right, and I was getting frustrated. Funnily enough, the controls felt like more of an issue in the first levels even after I replayed them. Maybe this was due to the fact that the game places so much importance in having many people following you, and in the first levels you're kinda by yourself. There's also a bit of a feeling of gliding when moving the character, but the discomfort starts to fade after a couple of levels, it's not game-breaking.
GAMEPLAY:
I ended up having fun throwing insane amounts of bricks at armoured cars and shuffling around with the chainsaw, I'll confess.

In general, it's an ok little game, and if you like the style and people owning the fruits of their labour (as this was made by a coop) you could give it a try.",1590821353,1591362104,True,9,0,0.587677359580993652,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Original review: This is a short game, but it's solid fun if you like throwing bricks, molotovs, and bombs at cops, mutants, and giant capitalist robot mechs and making things explode. I'd say it takes 1-2 hours to just complete all the levels depending on how fast you go, took me 3-4 hours to beat the game since I was trying to get all the unlockable riot gear along the way. It'll take a few more hours if you want all the achievements and riot gear, and there's an endless mode (which is technically endless but for most people ends at around wave 62). The soundtrack is punchy, the pixel art is really detailed and stimulating, the enemies are quirky and varied, and the gameplay is varied and exciting. The game is very overtly, on-the-nose political, which is something you'll probably either love or hate depending on how you lean. (Personally I love that it's a leftist game.) The game is also pretty funny at times, it's a very light-hearted game that doesn't take itself seriously and has a lot of crazy, bombastic moments.

The mob-style gameplay is fun and something different. You don't play as just one character, but you control the leader of a group of workers. When your character dies, they pass the torch to someone else in the group and you keep playing. At certain points in a level you can liberate more workers to your cause. Effectively, keeping your comrades alive gives you extra lives and extra firepower. It's lots of fun, especially when you have bunch of rioters spamming bricks and DPSing the shit out of a miniboss or a horde of cops.

My only gripe with the gameplay would be weapon management. You end up with a lot of weapons in your inventory as you unlock them, making it hard navigate to the right one especially in the heat of a fight. You can toggle which riot gear you want to bring with you into a level, but I feel like I'm giving myself a disadvantage by removing some of the weapons. Some kind of positive tradeoff (more than just clearer inventory) like more of the weapons you do bring would be nice. Or maybe options for hotkeys to certain weapons (i.e. b for bricks, c for riot shield).

Also the game could have more replayability. I got most of the unlockables from each level on my first or second try. You get them by earning 3/3 cogs on a level by saving a certain number of workers, which the devs adjusted to be more or less on each level depending on how difficult the level is. I think setting a higher bar to get 3/3 on a lot of the levels would give the game a lot more replayability. The only ones I've really had some difficulty getting where the tower stage at the end and the car chase before that (which I still haven't gotten). It'd be even better if there was some special award for, or at least acknowledgement of, getting a flawless run without losing any workers on a level. If the game kept track of that (with an achievement for getting every single one or something) people would probably be playing for many more hours. Revisiting levels with all the riot gear unlocked could be fun too, but there isn't much of a reason to besides that fun, so some kind of challenge to get flawless or a hard mode could easily add several more hours to the game. The game itself is somewhat challenging but it's no dark souls or anything, I never really had to retry a level more than a few times.

The $15 asking price isn't much, some reviews say it's overpriced so I guess if you're looking for just pure gameplay and don't care much for the themes maybe wait for a sale or something. Personally I thought it was worth it for the gameplay, amazing art and soundtrack, and ofc to support a co-op game studio, this game and PPU51 (the game studio) are an inspiration to aspiring game dev leftists like me.

愿景和设计、传承和立意都是好的，然而本作的实际体验其实更像B级片。没有理念，没有引导，简单的将用暴力反抗压迫抽象为了一路打过去最后击败一个开着机甲的资本家然后万事大吉，这也是小游戏的局限性。
游戏一共四大关，全通后开启无尽模式。每关会根据你通关后还存活的工人数目评级，三星解锁各种强化道具——从斧头砖头燃烧瓶炸弹到防弹衣医疗箱喇叭……太阳镜？这些道具有些是关卡里捡的投掷武器，有些（棒球棍、扳手）是无限使用的近战武器，还有开局人手+1、激光伤害减半之类的BUFF。
流程不算长，不过有无尽模式兜底。难度方面大概半数的关卡不算特别高。第二关BOSS是追逐战，需要避开障碍，但是要去踩树以飞离沼泽；第三关BOSS是踩动机关炸死敌人；4-4的追逐战难度更是极高，你要用一个前后摇都很长的机枪点杀后面追来的车……
游戏本身存也存在一些问题，比如选关是地图上跑，每次重启都要从第一关开始重跑；比如第三关的暴风雪完全看不清关卡，地图上还有坑，玩起来非常难受……而且机甲和高科技还能接受，变异就太猎奇了。
简而言之，本作是一款立意新颖的小品游戏，并没有讲述理念，也过于理想化，但是还是精神可嘉的，也有一定的游戏性。

Yet [u]Desert Child[/u] and [u]Sayonara Wild Hearts[/u] were brimming with unique visual design and this... isn't. It's just a standard beat-'em-up.

Okay, it's not [i]that[/i] standard. The game does have one very unique mechanic: you can bring other rioters with you as a group. If you die, you simply change control to another rioter. It's a good way of honouring the utterly stupid lives system that beat-'em-ups enjoyed back in the dark ages while modernising it and making it gel neatly into the gameplay.

Each rioter will follow up your attacks with one of their own. Best of all, they don't take from your resources. If you have fifty bricks, then each of those fifty times you throw, your allies will throw bricks of their own. There are few things as satisfying as pummeling an entire police squad with twelve friends.

That said, I have two major complaints. One is that the game is very bad at explaining itself to you by example. The controls are simple enough but I got absolutely wiped on Stage 1-3 by new enemies with ranged rubber bullets and it took me several tries for it to sink in that pelting them with bricks was not only better than using my unlimited melee weapons, but also the [i]only[/i] viable strategy. I don't actually know what molotovs are for; they don't really indicate they're doing much damage.

Also, I hate how, every time I complete a level with the highest rank, I unlock a new item but I have no idea what it actually does until I press ESC, click Riot Gear, scroll down, and find what I'm looking for. Just tell me what the item does when I unlock it, please.

Speaking of throwing stuff, here's my second complaint: the game is REALLY unwieldy. ""Point at the target and click to throw your weapon at it"", says the game. Cool, except my weapon will not do that; it either barely goes farther than my toes, goes waaaaaaaaay too far over the horizon, or go off to the side in an entirely different direction. Later levels have hazards that are best dealt with from a distance but I used up way more ammo than I should've just trying to hit the bloody things.

The game's quite short and insubstantial and the style doesn't really amount to much. I don't think it's that bad but I don't think it's worth the price for being less than three hours long. I would LOVE to recommend it—the world could definitely use more games with this message—but the issues with the controls and its length give me pause.

Your rating for the level is determined by how many are left alive, and keeping a certain amount alive unlocks a new piece of equipment.

Equipment can be a passive item, such as a gas mask to protect against tear gas, or a weapon to use, such as a throwing hatchet. However, I found it more applicable to have only a few items active at a time instead of all of them. 

The levels are short at some points, but it feels as if some of the gameplay can revolve around testing different combinations of the equipment available and providing a challenge for yourself to get the best outcome.

As for the supposed ""political"" elements of the game, there's nothing wrong with wanting to improve the status and lifestyles of the working class citizen.

their work with the means of production in common, in which the labour power of all the
different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community. All
the characteristics of Robinson’s labour are here repeated, but with this difference, that they are
social, instead of individual. Everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own
personal labour, and therefore simply an object of use for himself. The total product of our
community is a social product. One portion serves as fresh means of production and remains
social. But another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence. A distribution
of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary. The mode of this distribution will vary
with the productive organisation of the community, and the degree of historical development
attained by the producers. We will assume, but merely for the sake of a parallel with the
production of commodities, that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence
is determined by his labour time. Labour time would, in that case, play a double part. Its
apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between
the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community. On the other
hand, it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual,
and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption. The social
relations of the individual producers, with regard both to their labour and to its products, are in
this case perfectly simple and intelligible, and that with regard not only to production but also to
distribution.",1589270066,1589270066,True,4,1,0.479445278644561768,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Basically every square inch of the game is cramming in the tongue in cheek references to leftist ideas, or the bootlickers who would oppose them. The game contains unique mechanics related to these leftist ideas. For example, there are enemies who are lumberjacks, and as workers, they turn into allies when a specific enemy cop is killed. The game also scores your performance solely on the number of your allies you save, rather than enemies beaten or time taken, which seems in keeping with the philosophy of the game over the typical language of game difficulty. 

The game is fairly short, with only 4 ""worlds"" of 5 or 6 'stages' each. Rush it and you could maybe beat the game in less than 3 hours. But there's powerups to acquire for beating a level well, and the brawling action is fun and fast paced, and it's couch co-op, so you can get a lot of extra replay value with all your comrades.

The powerups could stand to be tweaked, since they're Boolean, and can all be on at the same time. This can give you an unreasonable amount of firepower or advantages unbalanced against the difficulty of the level. If there was some system of only enabling a certain number of powerups at a time might make some of the later levels more challenging.

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.

The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.

The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.

Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.

Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.

We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.

Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune: here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.

The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.

The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.

The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.

The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.

The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.

The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.

The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, u",1589132289,1589132289,True,3,1,0.460923522710800171,0,True,False,False,False,,,

강력한 자본과 최첨단 기술을 앞세워 도시를 병들게 만드는 악덕 자본가에 대항해 노동자들의 단결된 힘으로 맞서 인민들의 안녕과 번영을 되찾아야 하는 게임으로, 여러 유닛들을 하나의 조작으로 한번에 움직여야 하는 군중 제어 방식의 벨트스크롤 액션 게임이다. 수많은 노동자들과 붉은 깃발, 그리고 자본가를 몰아내기 위한 노동자들의 투쟁이라는 설정 등, 대충 게임 화면을 딱 봐도 사회주의 분위기가 대단히 강해 게임의 컨셉이 상당히 명확하다.

탑뷰 시점에서 진행되던 대부분의 군중 제어 게임들과는 다르게, 이 게임은 사이드 시점의 벨트스크롤 방식으로 진행된다. 노동자 무리는 플레이어가 직접 조종하는 노동자 대표를 잘 따라오며, 적을 공격할 시 바로 인지하고 플레이어의 행동을 따라한다. 플레이어가 조종하는 유닛이 죽으면 바로 임의의 다른 노동자 유닛으로 조작이 넘어가기도 한다. 이 덕분인지 조작도 그만큼 단순하고 편하며, 게임의 템포도 잘 유지된다. 동시에 '단결된 인민의 힘'이라는 게임의 컨셉을 잘 보여주고 있다. 사실 노동자들의 인공지능이 아주 좋은 것은 아니라 노동자 무리를 세심하게 컨트롤하긴 어려워도 게임의 난이도가 워낙 널널하다보니 크게 문제가 되진 않는다.

총 21개의 레벨이 준비돼있고, 각 레벨을 3기어로 클리어할 시 새로운 무기나 장비를 해금할 수 있다. 3기어 클리어가 크게 어려운 것은 아니나 무기의 종류가 많아 점점 게임이 난잡해지는 감이 있다. 게임을 시작할 때 여태껏 획득한 무기를 바리바리 전부 들고 나오다보니 그만큼 원하는 무기를 찾기가 까다로워지기 때문. 그 밖에 게임을 한 차례 클리어하면 웨이브마다 적이 몰려오는 무한 모드를 즐길 수 있긴 한데, 도전과제와 개발자 코멘트 정도 말고는 큰 의미는 없다.

사회주의 지상락원 스멜을 풍기는 분위기가 매력적이고, 군중을 제어하는 게임플레이는 그럭저럭 재밌다. 큰 강점은 안 보여도 치명적인 단점도 없는 게임이라 무난함 이상의 점수를 받을 만한 게임이다. 다만 컨텐츠가 적어 플레이타임이 짧은 게 좀 아쉽다.

Let me be perfectly clear, this is a revolutionary anti-capitalist game. The game boils down to you side scrolling across the levels fighting the various forces of capitalism: the police, the bosses, drones, etc. Your goal is to make it to the end of the levels and recruit workers to the cause along the way.  You use the workers to throw bricks, molotovs, axes, bombs, at the forces of capital. There is no real ""main character"" as the protagonist of the story is the workers themselves. You control one worker, the ""flag holder"", and the mass of workers. If your flag holder dies, the leader of the riot becomes another worker from the masses. You want to be a little careful however, as keeping enough workers alive allows you to unlock more items to use. The gameplay is simple but fun, and there is a good amount of variety in enemies to keep things interesting. The music great too. One of the best parts of the game for me honestly would be the jokes and references hidden throughout the game. As a Marxist I loved seeing all the little references to historical figures, events, and left-wing in-jokes (jokes about bootlickers, eating the rich, etc.). For anyone of a leftist political persuasion, this game is a treat worth playing.

Imagine all the people, paying $15 for a 3 hour flash game that should be for free.
I appreciate that a friend gifted this to me, but I requested he refund it.
[b]He's not rich, and neither am I.[/b] 
I think he'll need the money considering the current situation that's going on now.
Value for the money is very bad and since I got it from my friend for free, now I just feel bad, that he spent this money on 3 hours that weren't as fun as I was hoping it to be. 

[b]The content is extremely short. There's no replayability here.[/b]
I took my time with the game, going through it slowly, even AFKing and got all 31 achievements for it in record time. I got to wave 62 of endless by the way. And because the difficulty was kinda poor, I made sure to [b]SAVE EVERY SINGLE WORKER WITH NO CASUALTIES ON ALL LEVELS.[/b] 

[h1]Was the game rushed?[/h1]
The mechanics are there but are not used. Molotovs do little vehicle damage, 
[b]So the entire game is just about throwing bricks and finding more.[/b]
That's the issue, it's no fun when all of these weapons are there and none of them use any game mechanics, making them all pointless in-jokes.

By the end of the game, the inventory is so messy, that switching weapons becomes a deadly maneuver that kills all your friendlies. The pepsi can weapon is for a meme, I get that, and now my inventory has an extra weapon that I will never use, adding to the difficulty scrolling through one by one, to get to the weapon that I actually want to use. Switching weapons is a chore, and the new weapons don't serve any purpose nor add anything extra to the game. Everything seems to follow this logic.

I mean, at some point in the game, we're given nets, and they disable enemies' ability to move. 
Why aren't there enemies who cannot be defeated until you disable their ability to move with nets? 

You're given snowballs that slow down enemies. 
Why aren't there enemies that you need to slow down to kill?

We're given a shield, 
To use the shield you have to get to the shield, and when you do, you can't fight back, but have to risk switching weapons, that could end up having something as useless as a pepsi can during a crucial moment. why isn't there a mechanic in the game, where the player character stands alone to tank being shot at, holding the shield while making the worker mob go around a machine gun to destroy it?

Axes are just more damaging bricks. The chainsaw has terrible damage and no knockback, using it will have your friends die because you did not kill your enemies fast enough.
Simply put, the mechanics are missing from the game. So it's like the assets are there, but used for memes, and it's like an unfinished beta, or all the filler missions of a game to pad things out, rather than the actual game.

There's the jump function but it was used only 3 times in the game,
1. To try it out.
2. To get an easy final boss kill/achievement.
3. Easter egg/achievement.

I beat the final boss 3 times.
1. First time. Everyone following me died. Including the poor dog.
2. No casualties. I found out the huddling to the right vents, has the right arm easy to defend agaisnt, and brick it, while the left arm can't shoot you well.
3. Easter egg skip to boss, and the boss got bugged, stuck to the destroyed vent, or stuck on the right side of the building shooting the left machine gun that hits nothing because the right was destroyed and it was out of available space to move.

[h1]After every level, you have to see headless corpses of the workers around you, over a getting a stupid rating and dropping your flag over a building and then tell yourself, 
""I've won."" [/h1]
In the trailer, the game made a point of the building a better society,
In the game, all you do is destroy an old one and put your flag over it. There's no visual reference or anything that points out that you've made things better, the fact that you are presented with headless corpses of your allies makes it worse. When you beat a level, you find the headless corpses of your workers, and a 3 gear or star congratulations if there are less corpses than the devs expected. At one point over half the workers I had brought with me had died, but was rewarded anyway. Made my victory feel so hollow. Collateral damage, and acceptable loses is something the bad guys should be saying, the thing that the player should be fighting against, yet here I am, lost half of all the workers I liberated, and I'm given a stage clear and a reward for not losing everyone. I don't even get the ability to rescue or heal them. the Socialized medicine upgrade feels like it works only on me, and no one else gets it.
Trying to lead or keep the workers alive is pretty much relegated to sending them to the side of the map, and throwing bricks by yourself until it's safe to move. Their AI is so bad, I've seen them try to run up and attack lit explosive fuel tankers and trash cans just because an enemy was nearby, only to result the deaths of everyone except 2 other workers. all sacrifices are more like accidents and stupidity, all of which could have been avoided.

[h1]TL;DR [/h1]
[b]I just can't recommend this game in good conscience.[/b]
If you want a game to play during this quarantine period or something worth spending your money on, this is not the game you're looking for. this is the sort of game you go to the arcade blow $1.50 on, win the game in less than an hour after 2 retries and never feel like playing again.

With that caveat: It's a beat 'em up, but with a follow-the-leader mechanic. You can tell the mob where to go, and if they are in range of where you decide to, say, throw a brick, they'll follow your lead. If they aren't in range, they won't. The goal is to clear the stage of cops/militias, and get to workplaces where you can liberate workers who will then join you. 

It's chaotic, and when the scrum of workers, cops, and occasionally mutants, get's too crowded I found myself losing track of the worker I was controlling. That sort of emulates the nature of a mob, one could argue, so it kinda works in the games favor. Aiming can be a bit tricky when throwing bricks and molotov cocktails, but some practice did improve things a bit. You win more weapons and items as you progress through the levels, but things like the shield and soda cans didn't seem to help much or have much impact. The chainsaw, on the other hand, is just hellafun to use.

I hope to see more games by these folks because this was fantastic, and I am excited that I can support people that treat their workers well!

EDIT: I forgot to mention some other nit-picks that I feel like could be tweaked. That being that weapon switching (for me at least) was kind of tedious. You can either go to the next item or previous item in a set of weapons you can use. But I would never remember that say the next weapon was this or that, so I would be just continually scrolling/swapping in one direction until I found the weapon I want.

I beat the entire game in 88 minutes, including a 20 wave run in the unlockable endless mode. 

There are unlockables (weapons, skins, perks) to get in each level for getting to the end with enough workers surviving, but I didn't feel the need or urge to grind levels until I learned a strategy to do so on each level. I suppose if you wanted to milk some more time out of this that is a way you could do it, but I have no drive to play any further.

Gameplay is rather repetitive: hold right, use your right stick to aim, hold RT to throw bricks, and LT to move your workers around clunkily. While there are some bosses and driving levels to break up some of the monotony, they are few and far between. Otherwise, you're just doing the same thing over and over again to the point I was more than ready for the game to just be over by the time it was.

You can tell from the reviews which are all breathlessly requoting the same two or three ""epic memes"" from the game that nobody's really enjoying playing it. I wish there were more genuinely socialist games, but this is not one of them.

The soundtrack is obviously aiming to be something like Hotline Miami's, but it just sounds like a mess. The pixel graphics are beyond lazy, and you can tell the 8-bit style is a real crutch here, and it's being leant on hard. The writing is not as funny as it thinks it is - at one point a big robot shows up and your character says ""Nice means of production you have here..."" - I get what is being referenced here, but that doesn't even make any sense in the context of the game. It's a robot, not a factory, and you destroy it before you progress. This superficial presentation of left-wing rhetoric is a running theme in the game. It looks the part without really saying anything. The controls are floaty and imprecise, which is fine until the game expects you to accurately target explosive barrels and avoid obstacles on the floor.

There are some bizarre omissions - at the end of every level you see three billionaire types run out of a building from your triumphant proletarian mob, but the game gives you no moment of catharsis in beating them to a pulp. They are indestructible!

If I had a complaint it's that my comrades are hard to manage and like to run off and do their own thing but I guess that's realistic. Another small annoyance is that when you've unlocked most of the weapons and have a lot of them, it becomes difficult to cycle through everything to get to the weapon you need. Example, I basically chainsaw'ed my way through the game, but sometimes there are ranged enemies that require you to switch to a projectile in the middle of battle, but you may find yourself cycling through tons of items you rarely use just to get to the brick or molotov

Now that I've beaten the game I'll say that it is short, I managed to get 3 cogs for each level and unlock each item in 5 hrs or so after retrying some of the levels a few times. Maybe not worth full price unless you really want to support the devs and enjoy the unapologetically leftist revolutionary theme of the game(I did and have no regrets). I beat it in 2 sittings over the course of an evening and unfortunately I was left wishing there had been a few more stages. With that said I'll probably still replay it here and there as well as try to mop up achievements, but wouldn't expect more than a handful of hours of gameplay.

Of course, this game is not realistic and uses these real impressions to make a good game.

I love it so far, the gameplay is really fun and the ambiance is well-thought : it's not forcing you to embrace anarchist or communist values but exposes their (true) narratives. Communism is not about making shit free or expanding the state, it is uniting the workers to fight oppression and build something else. Communism is about the base, the proletariat, fighting for themselves. Many funny elements give room to the player to have his own relationship with this narrative, even as leftist I value the fact that it has a subtle way of raising the issue of revolution.

Of course, the player clearly see some flaws :
- Doesn't handle non-QWERTY keyboards (but it's okay, I changed the mapping)
- ALT + TAB sometimes creates weird graphical bugs on the main map
- Platforms and objects on the map are not really that important, which can make the game less interesting. You don't really encounter many obstacles, funny traps, or ways to use the environment against the enemy. I just go forward and throw stuff at enemies, which is okay, but could have been better
- Visuals are unequal. Overall it's a beautiful game with personality, I especially love the characters and monsters. Props, maps and environments are much less unique and beautiful.
