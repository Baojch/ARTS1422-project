It's not a bad game by any means, I just personally wouldn't recommend it at it's current price. I got it as a gift for a friend, as it was on his wishlist and thought to give it a go myself.

It's an ok little puzzly game, while I didn't find it funny, I could see that's what it was going for, some people might find it funny. But to be fully honest, it's not worth 9 pounds 99 pence. (12.79 dollars) (11.45 euros) And just for fun. (118,007.13 ZMK, which is a currency that no longer exists.) Not saying the game is worthless mind, but I just don't think I personally can justify 10 quid. The music is a bit repetative but not irritating. The controls are probably better designed for a gamepad, as with a keyboard I found my pinky was getting a good work out, Control and Shift being the two main keys, as opposed to perhaps E and C, which if I had played for longer I would probably have found a way to remap to those. The game is perhaps a little buggy but it's not unplayable. Just a few minor annoyances, which might not have actually been bugs. 

I couldn't really think of much to put in a review about such a simple game. So let's start with this.
Goblin: a mischievous, ugly, dwarf-like creature of folklore.
And: used to connect words of the same part of speech, clauses, or sentences, that are to be taken jointly.
Grotto: a small picturesque cave, especially an artificial one in a park or garden.

There were indeed multiple goblins, the cave however was very large, I think Goblins and Gigantic Caves would've been more accurate, but it doesn't sound as nice, doesn't roll off the tongue. How about Goblins and Grubby Gits who keep shooting fireballs at me. Again, doesn't sound as nice, it's a bit long, but it's definitely accurate!
Goblins and Globetrotting. Goblins and Gobbos. Goblins and Gobbledygook. Goblins and Gadzooks! Which is what came to my mind when a level 1 human and a level 20 human were both one shot killing me. Goblins and Ganking. Goblins and Ghandi... It's clear that I've run out of ideas. Maybe I should stop here.

Edit: Also, there were muffins. I don't remember treasure goblins or Styx stealing those, but I will be sure to keep an eye on my muffins from now on.
The goblin mentioned a dislike for Gold, this seems odd for me, Goblins are generally gold loving. In pretty much everything, but if the developer of this wants a Goblin that hates gold, because adventurers like it, well, I guess that is fair enough to me.",1497583168,1497583838,False,4,0,0.467915803194046021,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is a plaformer first and puzzler second with puzzles rarely going beyond moving an object from A to B or pulling a lever to open a new area. That in itself isn't a bad thing and the developer has gone a long way to mix things up as you progress through the levels, including transmutating the player into a goblin chicken, is that a Chicklen? Gobken? This all pretty much follows the humour of the game with NPCs having conversations about MMOs and bickering as you'd see in game chat of multiplayer games. It's light hearted and can take away the sting of rage and failure on some of the more tricky levels. That said seeing the same joke 20+ times may force you to smash your keyboard too.

Graphically the pixel art style works well, animations are nice, bonus points for having the character wobble on the edge of the platforms! Woo! There is nice modern lighting effects and objects have physics which play into combat, puzzles and numerous deaths. Which is worth a mention, as you'll probably die a lot and the respawn system in the game (statue checkpoints) are sometimes infinite and sometimes just number in the lower digits. This means a particularly tricky section can result in you spawning further and further back.

There is a level editor build into the game along with sharing functionality that lets you rate the user created maps and see a Complete/Rage Quit indicator similar to Mario Maker. This provides some extended longevity to the core game alonside the additional maps provided by the developer, although it should be noted there aren't a huge number of them. It's a nice addition to the game and mean if you end up being totally smitten with it there is no reason you can't make some tricky maps for yourself in the years to come.

On the whole I'd say this is well worth a look if you enjoy platformers with some tricky precision jumping required. The physics can get in the way sometimes but it's not the end of the world.

Ecco cose particolarmente rilevanti che ho notato:

1.
I comandi sono disegnati in modo PESSIMO. Gli sviluppatori avrebbero dovuto prendere esempio da altri stealth game con componenti di arrampica-muri. Uno fra tutti, Mark of the Ninja, che riesce a dare fluidità e naturalezza di comandi a situazioni di frenetica improvvisazione.
Invece no.
I comandi di questo gioco sono disegnati così male che anche raccogliere un oggetto da terra richiederà spesso impegno.
Tirare una leva mentre si tiene un oggetto in mano potrebbe essere difficoltoso. Potremmo doverlo poggiare.
Lanciare lo stesso oggetto con una minima precisione non è nemmeno concepibile, eppure alle volte ci viene richiesto.

2.
I puzzle sono inesistenti, perchè le meccaniche del gioco sono inesistenti.
Esistono videogiochi platform che, pur non essendo concepiti per essere dei puzzle game, hanno meccaniche tali da permettere di sbizzarrirsi nello creare dei puzzle più complessi. (Broforce come esempio)
Qui tutto si limita a cercare di indovinare quale leva attiva quale botola, e mostrare una minima agilità nello schivare oggetti in caduta libera. Tutto finisce li.

While the images/videos might hint towards a slightly more open-worldish type affair, the levels themselves are fairly straightforward with the exception of side areas you can muck around with for the sake of increasing your score... Which is just a score, there doesn't appear to be anything interesting associated with the number other than that deeply satisfying feeling of watching something get bigger because of you.

...*ahem*.


Now, from my handle and profile picture, you might presume I have a certain appreciation of all things goblinoid. This is true. I suppose I just feel a natural sense of connection with small, green, warty little beasts that are regularly and often deservedly reviled...  So seeing a game where you play as a goblin, surrounded by other goblins, beating up entitled tin-can heroes using deviously improvised traps and pitfalls felt like Steam had finally answered my prayers and delivered an indie title that wasn't completely terrible. The charming art style only added to that impression.

The problem is... The art style is pretty much the one good thing here. The player controls are manageable once you get used to them, certainly, but there's always the occasional hiccup associated with being something that tries to obey the fickle laws of video game physics.  The main problem arises from the fact that you don't have quite as much, if any, control over everything else in the game that is also having issues trying desperately to not exist in the same physical space as something else.

Dragging a massive boulder will of course be slow going, until the boulder suddenly and inexplicably flips into the air and sails over your head if you're lucky, or onto it if you're unlucky. Crates and barrels will sometimes be perfectly obedient, other times they will bounce just high enough to count as being lethally dangerous when they touch you again.

Unpredictable, bizarre and frequent deaths are really just part of the fun with doing anything in a game with a physics engine though, and the game is kind enough to have a mercifully short turnover time in regards to respawning.

However, you can't just run around willy-nilly and smash your bristled little green head against the puzzles until you find the right solution, despite several of them only being solveable by doing just that.

The reason you can't use trial-and-error is that, first of all, respawn checkpoints are limited. I mean this in the sense that you can only respawn at a specific checkpoint a certain number of times, after which you get sent back to the last checkpoint before that one, and so on until you're respawning at the very start of the level again.

This doesn't make the game more difficult or challenging, it just makes it more tedious. The only thing you have to do is just run and jump a bit more through old territory to get back to where you were, only to die to the same puzzle again and have to make the trek one more time. Or, if your luck's particularly foul, you get sent to a checkpoint that was before a point-of-no-return, so you actually CAN'T get back to where you were and need to restart the whole level from scratch.

Second, even if you don't have a particularly fatal puzzle at hand, it is entirely possible in far too many circumstances that you end up accidentally pushing something too much or not pushing it enough, in which case the thing you needed for the other thing gets irretrievably jammed into some spikes somewhere, and you have to start the level over since no amount of blood sacrifice will make the spike-gods relinquish their prize of a small throwable pebble.

Now, again, there's a chance for redemption here. Games with puzzles that can lock down like that will generally have fairly short levels and a quick way of resetting the puzzles so you can give it another try... Not so in Goblins and Grottos. The game shows off its really quite wonderful art style by having these large, sprawling maps for you to explore and maneuver around... Which is great in and of itself, and was really what I was looking for. The problem is when you combine that with tricky puzzles that can permanently stick themselves to the point where you need to do all the exploration all over again. This is particularly irritating when the only reason things got borked was because the physics engine shat itself while doing a routine calculation, and sent something inexplicably flying (which, let's face it, is one of the biggest reasons we love physics engines in games).


The game basically needs to decide what it is... Is it a casual, quick little puzzle platformer with difficult trial-and-error puzzles? Or is it a slightly more open exploration game for fiddling around? Trying to combine the two just results in a puzzle platformer that takes too long to get anywhere and that you're too scared to explore for fear of accidentally jamming the system again.  Considering the game has already been released and doesn't even bear the cautionary label of ""Early Access"", I think it's fair to assume that Goblins and Grottos isn't going to be making any particularly big changes to its fundamental gameplay anymore.


I really, really wanted to like this... I really did. Again, the art style is fantastic, and the humor wasn't nearly as irritating as it potentially could have been... But it's all just a bunch of polish on a game that isn't there.

You can't make a game that requires tight controls and exact reactions, then throw in a chaotic physics engine to make things interesting. You can't make a puzzle that demands trial and error, and then punish the player for not getting it right the first time.


On the plus side, the game does have a map editor... So I guess you could just make your own maps that have nothing to do with how the rest of the game runs, and then just marvel at how pretty it is.",1474535328,1474535340,False,37,5,0.777218639850616455,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Another time a cannonball took out three enemies for no reason , they all just bounced into one another and died without taking any fall damage.

As of writing this, they're on v 1.0.4 and, it's my favorite new platformer since Broforce.

Unlike BroForce or most other platformers, don't go into this one expecting to massacre enemies. I mean, you do massacre enemies (and friends) but in a long, drawn out sort of way, because you play as a tiny goblin with no weapons and only you Spiderman-like ability to cling to walls. (you're so weak, you can't even open up doors) It's basically Trapt or Tecmo's Deception, in platformer format.... with muffins.
There are pretty much only three ways to kill something in this game, crush them, make them fall, or blow them up. Every enemy in the game will one-hit kill you, but lucklily you can endlessly respawn at the beginning of the level or from restore statues scattered throughout (which gradually wear out and break, encouraging you to not screw up too often)

Pros:  

* Fun stealth/trap-based platformer, where you play as the weakest monster in the dungeon.
 
* Very open ended exploration in a dungeon feels bigger than it is. There are lots of path choices, and it doesn't feel like the game locks you into a set course or holds your hand. You just keep exploring until you find the exit. It is possible to totally screw yourself by pushing the wrong crate or failing to take out an enemy with a barrel of explosives, but you can always reset and try again, and *most* of the time when you spectacularly screw something up, you're only depriving yourself of a cool secret area and some tasty muffins. 

* Incredibly funny, and absolutely chocked full of secrets. Watching the other denizens of the dungeon interact is often nearly as much fun as playing the game itself.

* You can ride a sheep *AND* design your own levels!

Cons (as of v.1.0.4):

* Controls are slow and annoying in parts, especially with the ""cling"" and ""throw"" buttons on a controller, that can't be remapped (currently). It's also very hard to anticipate where objects will land with the throw mechanics, and there's no visual wind-up ""tell"" that you are actually about to throw an object, or how far it's going to travel. It would also be nice to be able to throw/drop while clinging, or when standing next to other objects. (being unable to throw or drop a bomb close enough to a brick you want to destroy because there happens to be a brick on the floor.) There's also no way to bring up the menu or restart the level from the controller.

* Physics/graphics fails. Mainly invoving projectiles, chains, and bombs. Nothing game-breaking but you do sometimes end up with explosions or projectiles flying off to get stuck in walls, or a perpetual sparking bomb animation that never goes away.",1468210756,1468210756,True,32,1,0.726196885108947754,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Goblins and Grottos is an engrossing puzzle-platformer with a sense of humor that will appeal to anyone who is familiar with MMO culture or fantasy tropes. You play as the nameless Goblin, whose entire family was slaughtered by a level 100 paladin who appears to have been power-levelling his n00b buddy. On your quest for revenge you'll make your way through caves, dungeons, and forests inhabited by adventurers that call to mind every sort of MMO player you can think of -- and all of them are trying to kill YOU for phat lewtz and xp. You're only a weak little unarmed goblin, unable to gain levels like the adventurers do (and they do -- if you die they gain experience and can level up and gain better abilities!) and unable to really fight back except through your own cunning, using the environment to either make your escape or defeat those who would hunt you. 

The traps work well and are incredibly satisfying to deploy. They can either be very simple -- a spike pit or a lever that drops a barrel, for instance -- or more complex -- knocking down a chest of loot in order to distract a knight and set him up for something else. Right now there are stationary spikes, lever-operated spikes, flame traps, boulders, slippery surfaces,  arrow traps, water, chains to swing from and climb, and probably a lot of things that I'm forgetting (plus more coming all the time, as the game is still in Early Access and the developers are actively working on it and update it regularly). In addition, there are explosive kegs, throwable bombs, an ever-expanding variety of adventurers who attack you in many different ways, and a ton of props and pieces that are moveable or even throwable (small rocks, skulls, boxes, barrels, tables, etc.). There are potentially multiple ways of completing levels, and your final score is based on how fast you complete it and how many points you earn (or lose) by defeating adventurers, eating muffins, or dying along the way.

The Official Story is currently ten levels long, but will clearly be continued in the future (as I said above, the game is currently in Early Access). I found it a good mix of entertaining and challenging, and I'm eager to see where the simple but fun story goes.

The real meat of the game, though, is the custom level editor, which is a blast to fool around with. It's fairly simple to figure out, and you can make your own levels as simple or complex as you want to, then upload them for other people to play. All the tools used in the official story are available to you here, including music, dialogue, and even a cutscene editor in case you want to make a more complex story for your levels. There is already an active community uploading custom maps, and I had a ton of fun playing them all and then trying to perfect my approach to each of them. Some levels are quick and simple and give you the same rush as playing a game of Sonic the Hedgehog or just screwing around in Assassin's Creed -- you know what I mean, that thrill of just running through as quickly as possible, trying to hit all the right spots in just the right way to shave fractions of a second off of your time. Others are intended to be story-focused, or silly impossible challenges, or my favorite: incredibly difficult, punishing levels designed to push your skills to the max.  The only regret I had was that I ran out of maps before I ran out of desire to play more, but players and the developers are sharing more maps all the time. I'm working on one of my own right now, and the design and building process is very satisfying.

The music in this game is excellent. There aren't a ton of tracks yet, but all of them are quirky and fit the ""feel"" of the game perfectly. I have yet to get tired of ANY of the music, which is really important in a game like this I think, and a real accomplishment. The developers have also made the soundtrack available to you to download for free, if you are so inclined, and that's another small gesture that I really appreciate.

The sound effects are one of my favorite things. None of the characters ""speak"" coherently out loud -- their dialogue goes into speech bubbles, but they all make various nonsense noises (sort of like the Sims): chit-chat, alarm, chasing, dying. Each type of character has a unique sound and feel, from the brutish warrior type to the hoity-toity ""speech"" of the Elf Queen. I personally never get tired of listening to the wizard adventurers jabber away in the background. It's almost a shame that I have to kill them so I don't get a fireball to the face.

Overall, I absolutely would rate this game 10/10. It's addictive, with just the right blend of fun and challenge, skill and humor, good for long sessions or just a quick run-through or two. The devs have real love for their material, and it shows. The game is worth the price even in Early Access, and it's getting better all the time, with regular updates from devs and player-made maps (or maps of your own) to keep you occupied in between updates. The devs are also active on their forums, very helpful if you have any questions, and actively consider recommendations and ideas from the community.

I like the humor of this game (some lines made me laugh out loud). The pixel art is full of charm, and what starts up as an unassuming game soon shows its subtleties. Variations and subtleties of control let you do more things in more ways than you'd think possible at first. The more I'm playing it, the more fun it gets. 

It's still an early access game: you'll go through some part of the story without thinking twice and you'll be stalled for a couple of hours on some other levels..

The developers of this game were incredible ; they were quick to fix bugs, incredibly enthusiastic about their game and updates were about as frequent as the things they added and fixed included.

Pros are as follows
A catchy and memorable soundtrack
Far from original, but charming and suitable-to-the-story artwork
A very humourous, meta and interesting story that takes a fresh perspective on the MMO genre and twists it into a fun singeplayer experience
A bonus 'Create' mode a la mario maker, where you can take all the game's tools and even a cutscene maker to create your own levels and see others'
Several hours worth of user-created levels (including my own) which keeps the game fresh and longevity high
Aforementioned incredible dev team

Cons:
Stiff controls that can be quite frustrating, though admittedly these may have been refined it later updates
Infuriating checkpoint system that leaves little room for trial-and-error in a game where random deaths are commonplace
Puzzles that can be buggy and levels that glitch requring restarts and loss of several minutes of progress

The map maker is probably what makes the game, you can create some truly challanging stuff right there! :P
There are few controlls to keep track of so the learning curve for the editor is short, what took the longest time for me to get right is the cutscene editor. 
In it you can script scenes in the map you make, que dialoge between the goblins and knights, and make them act out different moves, like walk straight into a trap for instence. :P

The dev's have been fast with fixes for issues and are quick with replies on the in-game forum. :)

If you enjoy platformers, goblins and the noice knights make when you push them of cliffs.

In fact, this is my very first review, but Goblins and Grottos deserves more props and hopefully more support from gamers than it is probably getting.

Why? Because it is devious fun and a great puzzle game with a lot of potential. It's also a full game right now, and pretty dang fun.

Imagine for a moment, playing a weak, almost defenseless goblin in a world where cliched fantasy heroes with the AI personality of MMO players slaughter you and your kin as if you were level -10 pond scum. Now imagine proving them idiots as you lure them into traps, drop things on them, drown them, get them to kill each other, blow them up with dynamite and bombs, and generally wreak havoc on these mighty morons. 

Now Imagine a world that makes fun of fantasy tropes and memes in every action with clever jokes and situations and features a story of revenge told from the other side of fantasy: The goblin side!

Now mix that with clever and sometimes difficult puzzles that can only be solved with a mixture of using the heroes to your advantage, using trapdoors, chains, and rolling on top of boulders to get around (And occasionally squishing heroes as you roll over them). You have to think to survive in this game.

Does that sound fun? Because that's not all. Goblins and Grottos features a full map editor so you can make your own devious levels and populate them with your own twisted creations.

Just buy it. It's a fun game and has longevity built into it. 

Plus, it's fun to play a weakling for a change. Like any decent goblin, you'll find yourself dying over and over again, in comical ways, blowing yourself up, drowning yourself, doing everything you did to heroes to yourself. And it's fun, because you're reminded by all the smoking, shattered, broken corpses of yourself throughout the level that you made progress on your quest to defeat the ultimate paladin, and you're only a hundred or so deaths away from revenge!",1450843783,1450843783,True,8,0,0.426003515720367432,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game exerts creativity from the map editor, challenging puzzles, superb 8 bit artwork, and funny dialogue that you don't normally see in a platformer. The simplicity of the game makes you appreciate that retro feel of it if as if you were playing this gem from the 90s. A huge bonus feature of this game is the map editor where you can customize and share your maps with other people! The maps you can create are agility, story, puzzle, or just plain silly! As I played the first little bit there's a few changes that I would hope to see in the future:

1. The map editor selection screen needs to be simplified and organized by categories

2. Whenever your selecting an item in the map editor it should have some stats of what it is...for the cave moss I didn't realize that it's a object and I thought it was just tangible debris

3. The triggers for scene cuts should have an option for a preview! As well previewing levers, patrols, and etc.

Overall I am very pleased with the game and would recommend it to anybody who loves 8 bit games! Try it out!

Графика: не люблю пиксельарты, но люблю 8 битные игры с денди. Тут именно такая графика, достаточно прорисованная.
Управление: Поддерживается геймпад. На самом деле можно было бы сделать чуть лучше. Например повесить бросок предметов на другую кнопку, а не на ту же что и использовать предмет.
Музыка: Музыка очень даже подходящая. Напомниает чем-то игры про Багз Банни на первой Соньке.
Юмор: Юмора тут тоже хватает. Враги говорят разные смехуечки, бывают забавные ситуации, враги качаются в уровне при твоей смерти. В общем все достаточно хорошо.
Из минусов только очень короткая основная компания, но ее я думаю в дальнейшем продлят. Еще отсутствие возможности пропустить диалоги. Ну и физика иногда бывает той еще занозой.

Imagine mario maker, but now you can make cutscenes and dialogues which open up so many more ways to be creative.
The graphics and animations are cute and are well up to the standard set by other games using pixelated graphics that have been released recently. I was one of the lucky few who got to play in the closed beta and I'm not gonna lie, back then (especially in earlier patches) there was alot of physics bugs; however most if not all of them seem to be fixed for the early acess release. On a technical level, this game has less bugs and glitches then the majority of ealry access games.
The controls are very simple and easy to pick up. The map maker and the amount of creativity involved in creating your own levels is where this game really shines, however, The map maker interface is simple and easy to use, and the sheer amount of possibilities is what in my opinion makes this game so enjoyable. Sharing maps with friends and playing the top maps online is what this game is all about, and the fact that it has dialogues and cutscenes that you can make makes it even better.
In conclusion this game is driven by the excellent map maker and map sharing system, which is backed up by a very well functioning and technically sound game. I give this game 9/10.",1450536647,1450539736,True,21,1,0.568927288055419922,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Getting up in the morning, playing the story mode (With all the funny jokes that are in it), and seeing who can complete a level the fastest with my brother. GOBLINS AND GROTTOS is a really good game that shows lots of potential.

CONTROLS (8/10)

The controls in GOBLINS AND GROTTOS are nice and they work well. There could be more control configurations, such as W A S D and SPACE for moving, MOUSE 1 to grab things, and MOUSE 2 to pick up and throw things. Other than that, the controls are nice.

SOUNDS (9/10)

The audio soundtrack is an odd collection that really captures the essence of the game itself. You can hear the nice music in the background as the Goblin parkours his way through each level. The speech of the knights are also very comical, and give you a good laugh. It would be good if the sounds were quite distorted. It would also be good if you could import sounds in the mapmaker.

GRAPHICS (9.5/10)

The graphics are wonderfully drawn, with lods of details and colours. The animations and illustrations lure you into the story of the Goblin. I quite like the distortion effect when any object is underwater.

BALANCE BETWEEN CHALLENGING AND IMPOSSIBLE (8/10)

At first, it was challenging, but now, I can do most levels in a breeze. Then there is some very challenging levels which I like, and levels that are more like puzzles. The balance between challenging and impossible is pretty good.

STORY/HUMOR (9/10)

The humor in GOBLINS AND GROTTOS is very effective and funny. The sounds that the knights make are very humorous. The Story itself doesn't have too much depth though. From what I can tell it is just the Goblin wants revenge because the Paladin killed his father.

MAPMAKER (9/10)

The Mapmaker is a really nice feature that allows the community to share maps with each other, and compete for the number 1 spot. At first, the Mapmaker is a little bit difficult to understand, but when you make more maps, it is very nice. It can be quite time consuming creating a map, but when it is done, you feel a great sense of accomplishment. In my opinion it is even better than Mario Maker because you can make your own storys and cutscenes and be creative.

[b]GOBLINS AND GROTTOS[/b] is a puzzle-driven platform game casting you as an orphaned goblin whose family is smashed into a pitiful amount of XP by a monstrous paladin and his companion. Your goal is one of simple revenge; you will track this genocidal fiend through caverns, mountains and forests in a bid to bring him to bloody justice. 

The various conundrums are largely of the [i]pull box here to hold button there[/i] variety with many of their immediate objectives in aid of laying waste to the army of mindless adventurers that lurk throughout the game to impede your progress. Lever-armed spike traps, mangling boulders and destructible outcrops are all in place to assist in their deaths, as well as the opportunity to lure the greedy idiots into harm's way with treasure chests. 

The entire experience is unashamedly meta; the enemies refer to their in-game exploits as if controlled by the worst kind of WoW enthusiast. In as little as the first few minutes, there is a direct [b]LEEEEROOOYYY JEEENNNKIIIINNNS[/b] skit played out in front of you. Some of the jokes are maybe a little too easy but considering the rate they fly out at, the humour feels immersive and complimentary to the game, rather than an awkward distraction.

There are a few frustrating quirks in the physics; the clutter created by assassinating an adventurer or freeing a boulder sometimes reacts to you standing on it by inexplicably spearing you in the face, killing you instantly. This alone isn't too much a big deal as you have an infinite amount of lives but it's a different story when combined with the somewhat bizarre checkpoint system. A checkpoint will only allow you to respawn by it a very limited number of times before it sends you backwards to a previous checkpoint. Die enough times and you're spawning back at the level's beginning. There's no real penalty to it as you retain all progress made within the stage; you just have to jump, climb and run back to where you were which seems to be little more than a cynical penalty for experimentation, especially in the later levels.

Still, these are minor flaws when compared to what should undoubtedly be the main draw of Goblins and Grottos. The game possesses a powerful map editor which allows you create custom levels and campaigns for sharing online, even going as far as to let you write your own dialogue and plot for your NPCs. It could honestly use a basic tutorial just for the sake of eliminating half an hour's worth of random clicking but, that aside, there's hours of creative madness to be had with it.
