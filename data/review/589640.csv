My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Gameplay consists of very basic placement of a variety of minimalist pixel turrets on an established grid, letting them kill everything, then uninstalling the game because you're not a console peasant and thus don't enjoy console trash that didn't even do well on consoles, which certainly raises questions about why such trash is on PC. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

The developers didn't design the game for modern gaming PCs, as such the display resolution caps out at around 1080p, a very low resolution that became mainstream back in 2006 and became obsolete when 4K entered the mainstream in 2014.  Now, the game did come out in 2012, but there's no excuse for the developers choosing not to repair this defect before dumping it on Steam as a cash grab in 2017.  The game simply won't look right on modern gaming displays due to this failure on the part of the developers.

Because this is a console game, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the inferior console gaming appliances that the game was designed for.  These are unfortunate compromises and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was a second thought for the console-centric developers.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for consoles forces upon a game.  Once more, console peasants have made gaming worse for everyone.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the video game construction kit/toolset, Microsoft XNA Game Studio.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur/unskilled developers as it doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Spoids has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for completing the tutorial, but less than 3 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show only 2.5 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the game?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Spoids is relatively cheap at 90 cents, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.",1682184092,1682184092,False,3,1,0.234825268387794495,0,True,False,False,True,,,

首先从核心玩法上来看显得过于简单且重复。游戏中玩家主要控制一个球体在各种环境中冒险，通过跳跃和躲避障碍来通关。然而这些关卡设计缺乏新意，难度曲线也过于平缓，导致整个游戏过程显得单调乏味。玩家在游玩不久后就可能感到厌倦，缺乏继续探索的动力。

其次游戏的画面和音效也未能给人留下深刻印象。虽然球体主角的设计简约可爱，但整体画面缺乏细节和质感，场景和障碍物也显得较为单调。音效方面同样令人失望，背景音乐单调乏味，与游戏场景和氛围的契合度不高，无法为玩家带来沉浸式的游戏体验。

此外游戏的剧情和角色塑造也显得相当薄弱。游戏并未为玩家提供一个引人入胜的故事背景，球体主角也缺乏足够的个性和特点，使得整个游戏过程缺乏情感共鸣和代入感。玩家很难对游戏中的角色和故事产生深厚的情感联系。

最后从性价比的角度来看同样令人感到失望。相较于其他同类游戏，它在玩法、画面、音效、剧情等方面都显得较为逊色，但价格却并不低廉。这使得玩家在购买时可能会感到不值，尤其是对于期待高质量游戏体验的玩家来说，这款游戏可能并不是一个明智的选择。

综上所述，这款游戏在多个方面都未能满足玩家的期待。如果你对游戏的玩法深度和丰富性要求较高，或者希望寻找一款更具挑战性和趣味性的冒险游戏，那么这款游戏可能并不适合你。希望开发者能够在未来的作品中认真倾听玩家的反馈，不断改进和完善游戏的设计，为玩家带来更好的游戏体验。",1639921473,1711446666,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can designate what individual turrets do, such as target nearest to turret, closest to exit/entrance, weakest, strongest, fastest or slowest. Giving you a more custom targeting setup, since default behavior targeting is a bit awful.

[*] It's not any kind of Farming simulator and putting that in mind it hasn't even a single recognisable animal in the game. A real pity. Just Sad.
[*] Also, its not a Shooter and I can't annoy everyone with my brilliant taste of music. That's a big minus.
[*] And Last but not least it's not a shitty Tower defence. It has no unfair balance and no extra ordinary graphic, too. It does not collect my data against my will and sell it to someone and finally, I couldn't notice anything annoyable in it. A real shame.

Well worth it at this price point. (£1. 59)

Although you can't upgrade towers this does not diminish the joy. The difficulty is very well balanced. You can gain medals for each level from bronze to platinum and while bronze is easy, platinum is really hard, especially in level 5 and 6. 

Pros: 
- nice graphics
- very good balance between towers and enemies
- runs smooth and without bugs
- well designed maps
- interesting voice acting, you can tell it's done by amateurs. While some do great, especially the lady in the credits, others sound like being forced to lecture aloud before class. But that's fun too.
- good music
- very cool credits
- endless mode
- full controller support
- it even has a story

Auch heute noch sind die meisten TDs strategich nur zweidimensional, versuchen aber durch Grafiktricks einen 3D-Eindruck zu erwecken. Flugeinheiten, Turmbauplätze mit Reichenweitenbonus oder Ähnliches unterstützen diesen Eindruck.
Dieses Spiel hat eine gelungene 2D-Retrografik. Die Maps passen auf einen Bildschirm und sind relativ einfach gestrickt, es gibt vorgebene Mauern die den Weg der Gegner bestimmen und auf denen überall Türme gebaut werden dürfen.
Es kann mehrere Eingänge und Ausgänge geben, nicht alle Gegner nehmen unbedingt den gleichen Weg.
Man kann den  Weg der Gegner nicht beeinflussen und es gibt keine Rückspulfunktion. Flugeinheiten ignorieren die Mauern und haben ihre eigenen Wege.

Es gibt keine direkten Schwierigkeitgrade, sondern 3 Ziele, die jeweils nach einer bestimmten Anzahl überlebten Wellen erfüllt sind. Je nach erreichter Welle erhält man Bronze, Silber oder Gold. Hat man alle 3 Ziele erreicht und noch alle 20 Leben, so gibt es Platin. Es gibt eine Beschleunigungsfunktion (mittlere Maustaste gedrückt halten). Da die Wellen in den Missionen in kurzen Abständen starten, bekämpft man meistens mehrere Wellen und braucht sie seltener. 

Eine Vorschau, zeigt die Embleme der nächsten Gegner.
Es gibt 8 Türme ohne Upgradestufen und mit einstellbaren Zielprioritäten.
Die 8 Missionen kann man in 2h durchgespielt haben.

[u]Fazit[/u]
Schön gemachter Retrocharme der Spass macht. Ich habe es kostenlos über einen Freund erhalten und für den aktuellen Angebotspreis von 1,49€ ist es schon kurz.
