My Mystery Case Files journey has taken a supernatural twist! Her Majesty The Queen has asked me to investigate the unsettling rumors surrounding Ravenhearst Manor. My mission is to find the missing diary pages of Emma Ravenhearst, but first I'll have to solve a series of bizarre Door Locks placed by Charles Dalimar. Was Charles trying to keep someone from getting in...or out? 
 
Ravenhearst marks the beginning of the Dalimar legacy and Master Detective's nemesis for many future Mystery Case Files games. The most notable difference in Ravenhearst is with the introduction of the infamous Rube Goldberg puzzles.

To date, there are 26 games in the Mystery Case Files franchise. Games 1-9 were developed by Big Fish Studios, Games 10-11 were developed by Elephant Games, Games 12-20 were developed by Eipix Entertainment, and Games 21-26 were developed by Grandma Studios. 

[b]MYSTERY CASE FILES: RAVENHEARST[/b] 
Just as in its predecessors, Huntsville, and Prime Suspects, you are tasked with searching for clues in the form of Hidden Object Scenes, but this time you are searching 32 rooms of Ravenhearst Manor.
 
[b]DIARY PAGE ENTRY PUZZLES[/b] 
The goal is to find all of Emma Ravenhearsts' Diary Entries by finding clues via hidden objects scenes. They have given us a fifth Hint, but I strongly suggest that you save the hints for the Door Puzzles. Each room has 8 objects to find, but you don't need to find every item (the amount required is shown at the bottom of the list) so if you can't find an object, simply click the Map tab and move on to the next room. Once you find the required clues/objects, you must piece together fragments of a diary page by rotating and placing each piece correctly, at which point you can read Emma's entry.
 
[b]DOOR PUZZLES[/b] 
Charles Dalimar may be long gone, but he still haunts you with a series of maddening locks. These are Rube Goldberg puzzles that require thinking & tinkering. Click on anything and everything until you find codes or clues as to how to solve each section. At first glance, it may seem overwhelmingly impossible to figure out, but trust me when I say that if you just tinker around with the crazy gadgets, you will figure them out! If you have saved your hints, they will come in handy now because they can be used to figure out the next step of the puzzle. I have played every game in this series, and it saddens me that no one has been able to recreate the Rube Goldberg door puzzle masterpieces since Big Fish Studios handed over the reins of this series!

This game gave me headaches trying to find items back when I was playing on a CRT screen, and the sheer clutter of the rooms will make you dizzy.
The plot is intriguing if you can bear through the endless hidden object rounds, and the puzzles are amusing though infrequent. 

This game holds a special place in my heart since it triggers so much nostalgia, but if you're only interested in the story I recommend just looking up a summery of the diary pages and skipping this one.

Some items are unfindable due to translation errors (e.g. ""circle"" and ""compass""), and others are just so random that you won't find them (an ashtray in a shape that I had never seen before and would never have recognised as ashtray).

Mine automatically went full screen every time I played it, and I could minimize the game without it seeming to have affected anything else. I'm sure the screen resolution was a real issue, but I'm no expert on computers so I don't know if mine worked because of my computer or the issue itself has been fixed. 

I played this game around when it first came out, and then spent the next 15 years thinking about the Ravenhearst saga every couple of months or so. This game is a pretty straightforward hidden object game with some door puzzles and jigsaw puzzles (for the journal entries) thrown in for good measure. Each level you need to find a certain number of objects, but there are always a few more objects available to find than are needed. That gives some wiggle room to just not find some objects if you're having a hard time. There are some other reviews that give a more detailed description so I'll leave it at that. I did not find it terribly difficult, but it was still enjoyable. 

My only issue was the amount of spiders in the rooms, but that is a purely personal problem as I am afraid of spiders. Most of the spiders I was able to glance over without focusing too much. There are enough objects that the wiggle room provided lets me not look too closely at these spiders. There are a couple of rooms that want me to find the spider, but I can just click blindly in the general area and get it. No worries about finding it, because either it was big enough that I spotted and avoided it right away or small enough that there aren't enough details to be afraid of. There is one room however, the cellar, that has a large colorful tarantula front and center. I always keep this room for last. I have no idea what objects are on the bottom half of this room, I can't look at it. I just hope that however many objects I have left are on the top half or findable with hints. I am most of the way through this game and so far this method has worked. Again though, this is only a problem because I am afraid of spiders. If you do not have arachnophobia, literally nothing in this paragraph matters.

It's just a very difficult hidden-object game that almost exclusively comprises very difficult hidden-object scenes. There is no point-and-click adventuring and there are only two types of puzzle mini-games. I quite enjoyed a few of the unique puzzles! But, unfortunately, the hidden-objects scenes are difficult for annoying reasons: very low resolution, tiny and poorly rendered objects, objects covered by other objects, ambiguous item requests, precise pixel hunting, etc. The game essentially keeps repeating the same small amount of scenes again and again while asking you to point out a random list of objects. You are ranked according to how fast you play.

Two more annoyances: First, when you click an object you have to wait for the animation to end before being able to click on the next object. This defeats the sense of flow that is so enjoyable about this genre, and is plain silly when the point in this particular game is to work quickly. Second, the sound effects. I was completely amazed to read reviews here in which people praised them. I found them the most annoying sound effects I've ever experienced in a game.

As someone who's first Hidden Object game was the sequel to this, it is nice that the game comes with a relaxed mode so I don't have to worry about the time limit that much.

I'd say the puzzles were the best part of the experience. The seemingly amateurish display of all sorts of tools and objects combined in a contraption that I would only see in my wildest dreams gives the game an unique aesthetic that I haven't seen in any of the MCF games that came after.

And speaking of the puzzles, do try to savour them, once you figure out the answer to one of them, it won't be replaced in future runs.

The Hidden Object part of the game can be very frustrating at times, since the developers REALLY like to put objects on top of other objects of the same color, you always have to check the same place twice to make sure there really isn't anything there, once you get used to it, though, it's a bit easier (but just a bit, you'll still have to look carefully).

I recommend taking a break for every page you get (5 minutes minimum) since a game like this can tire your eyes very fast.

===================
Personal Rating: 6/10
===================


Details:

The third entry in the installment. You are sent on a task by the Queen of England herself (yes, seriously) to uncover the secrets surrounding a mysterious journal entry that she has received from the long abandoned Ravenhearst Manor. In your search for hidden objects, you begin to open up more rooms of the large estate by solving elaborate puzzles barring your entry into them. With each section completed, you recover more journal entries that carry you along the story.

Pros:
- The spooky atmosphere works, some scenes have moving imagery and a few eerie moments.
- Sound effects and music is an improvement from prior titles.
- Option included to remove the time limit in sections allows more casual gamers to enjoy the experience/story.
- Story was more compelling than previous titles.

Cons:
- Finished after a few hours, still relatively short.

Closing Statements:

Definitely a step in the right direction as the developers went on to make future titles, implementing sections that worked well even further. I hope to continue enjoying the series.",1642453202,1642453202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

If you're looking for something with a wider variety of puzzles and a deeper story, then maybe look up the background to this one and skip to Return to Ravenhearst. 

I played the Ravenhearst games when I was younger and came back to them in my 20s for nostalgia. I started with this one to play the games chronologically. And I kinda wish I hadn't. I was originally going to leave this with a positive review, noting that maybe I'm just not the target audience. Then I started on the sequel, and in comparing the two I realize just how much I disliked playing this one. I pretty much dragged myself through it for just the story.

The only gameplay I enjoyed was doing the jigsaw pieces of the diary, which only makes up roughly 10% of each level. The story is a lovely set up to the Ravenhearst series. I also enjoyed when they interwove the look & find and the story. In the gameplay, you'd see books that Charles' would have read, and in the story, Emma talks about Charles' obsession with door locks and collecting random junk. I wish there was more of this, and the look & find portions actually contributed to discovering more of the story, perhaps observations that the diary doesn't give you. The map being a floor plan as a nod to Charles building the house was a nice touch.

Looking at the negatives, the game was just monotonous. Visually, a few screens are nice but otherwise most are not even pleasant to look at. And then you have to come back to them. This game has a story, but the game play does not support it other than taking place in the same house. You could easily be playing a word search or matching game and it would be about the same. Maybe it's unfair of me to compare this to its sequels, but in Return at least, the look & finds contributed to puzzles and they felt like I was investigating a part of the rooms you entered.

A break from the look & find portions are the puzzle locks that you are occasionally blessed/cursed with. I personally found these to be a pain as they're sometimes nonsensical and have very little direction. The few I was able to complete without assistance from a guide did not leave me feeling accomplished or clever. Just annoyed. 

The sound design wasn't terrific either. It starts with a good atmosphere, but the amount of creaking floors and yowling cats, plus the badly looping ticking of the timer, is enough to make you want to mute it. I didn't struggle with meeting the time parameters, but it wasn't necessarily fun to be rushed. 

The game isn't bad, and it does set the stage for it's sequels. However, I honestly regret even spending $10 on this and not just looking up the story for my adventure into the rest of the series. I personally couldn't recommend you play it unless youre 100% here for the look & find, and the occasional puzzle and plot is just a cherry on top. Even then, grab it on sale for $4.",1606536893,1606536893,False,2,0,0.519685029983520508,0,True,False,False,False,

However, I can say that this is a very complete and cohesive game. There's actually a ton of content in the form of rooms to explore and objects to find within those rooms, as well as puzzles to access some rooms. The placement of objects is mostly fair and the puzzles are fairly intuitive.

There's some pretty consistent horror themes throughout the game, in the form of the plot, the art style, and the hidden objects. The plot is severely lacking, but that's fine since the plot plays a backseat in the game anyway. The art style and the hidden objects do make for an experience that feels well-crafted and suspenseful.

[i]January, 2012 review; updated March, 2019[/i]

NOTE: This title played full-screen with no problems.

This is the start of a storyline that is touched upon in MCF4: Madame Fate and continued in MCF5: Return to Ravenhearst (RTR being the first IHOG-adventure of the series).

The most memorable thing about Ravenhearst is the story.  It starts out as ""just"" a hidden object game with a romance as the theme... but it evolves into a dark and compelling tale.

Options include separate sliders for Music, SFX and Environment, with a Full-screen/Windowed option.  Happily this title will go full-screen on the Steam version, although the Steam overlay doesn't work (no screenshots - darn!)

You have two difficulty options:  Detective Mode (normal, timed gameplay) or Relaxed Mode (which gives you extra time).

There are no cut-scenes, but plenty of story via Emma Ravenhearst's diary entries, which you will find throughout the game.

You have FIVE hints to use per ""level"".  The introductory level has three rooms to search, one of which can't be done until you solve the ""puzzle lock"".  The number of rooms to search increases as you progress through the game.  You do not have to find every single item (they give you a two-item leeway), but HINTS are limited, so use them wisely!  

A slight irritation is that you have to wait for a moment for your ""crime computer"" to register that you've found each item - you can't click one object after another because the game won't notice that you've clicked on the additional items.

At the end of every level is a jigsaw-type puzzle, yellowed like an old black and white photograph for you to put together.  Finishing the puzzle will bring you a scrolling-text version of Emma's diary entry.  You can access it anytime via the diary (top right) or skip it altogether - your choice.

You will revisit levels throughout the game, but never the same set of rooms (ie. at the beginning you visit the front porch, entryway and the parlor.  On level two you visit the entryway, dining room and servant's quarters).  Items-to-find are randomized, so you may need to find one item you've had to find before, but then have six new ones on the list.

Now, back to the infamous puzzle locks.  You must figure out the door locks before you can access certain rooms.  Click everywhere, try everything.  There is logic to them, so give them a try before looking for solution!  I had a lot of fun trying to figure them out on my own, and they're one of the best parts of these early MCF games.

Are you a person who LOVES a good puzzle here and there and loves to find some objects in a scene with a massive challange ? then I welcome you to Ravenhearst, The haunted mansion that will get you stunned with its beautifull story line, Ravenhearst 2&3 are just as good tho the first game (This one) comes witht he fact it is only puzzleing and hidden objects where 2&3 had alot off adventure to it what is still rly lovly, tho it is challanging as all hell, I myself found myself stuck on like a week cause I couldn't figure out where the hell to go, and that kept me rolling expecially due to the fact the game is a HUGE explore area, As far as this one, For not being a person with English as a first language this game improoved it so god damn mutch, And also improoved my sharpness in finding things in other games aswell, You can also play the game in German and French may you be from there or wana practace that language ofc :P

The puzzles do take a while to get a hang off and even if you master em all by mind like me, They sometimes still give you quite some trouble but hey, Thats what puzzles are all about right ?

The envirement of this game tho, Dispite its obviously a messive mess in the rooms and area's cause ya gotta find stuff, The rooms,Gardens,Attic,Basement, Etc etc, Its all just so beautifull and dragged me expecially right away, and made me come back to this game so mutch, I started out witht he game personally on Disk but when I saw it on Steam I wanted it so badly x3

The story line in every single game is just amazing and beautifull, Its 1 off those games where the story just drags you with it for a while and makes you determent to find out the ending, and even when you find that out, Its not quite done with this doomed mansion in the middle off England!

Поскольку Стим не поддерживает несколько обзоров на игру, пришлось старый обзор убить и написать новый. Старый ""ничего не работает"" вставлен в конце этого. Правда, всё равно не сработало)

Не прошло и десяти лет, как Ravenhearst в Стиме починили! Интересно, почему именно его - первые две (просто MCF и Prime Suspect) так и остались нерабочими. А тут два дополнительных языка, встроенная ссылка на прохождение - всё, как в современности!

Движок, правда, не подтянули: он по-прежнему демонстрирует 800х600 (только теперь растянутый на 1920), и по-прежнему в Стиме не выключается (Стим не понимает, что он выключился и продолжает показывать ""работает"" ещё минут двадцать). Но в остальном - играбельно.

Правда, выяснилось, что можно было спокойно жить без него и дальше. Хоть это типа и первая часть длинной серии связанных игр в одной вселенной, но на самом деле это всё тот же поиск предметов, что и в первой части. Точно по тому же сценарию ""Посетил икс локаций из одного и того же списка, нашёл игрек предметов, закрыл паззл, миссия завершена!""

В плюс Ravenhearst можно поставить то, что все миссии теперь работают на сюжет и проходят в одном и том же особняке, а не разбросаны по абстрактному городу. Кроме того, часть локаций закрыта, и нужно решить дополнительную головоломку, чтобы вообще в них попасть. Эти головоломки хорошие и все разные (не то что паззлы в конце миссий, которые все по одному шаблону, да ещё и растянуты по горизонтали из-за разницы разрешений, что мешает нормально их решать).

А в минус пойдёт то, что прогресс не чувствуется. Там, где в первых частях ты решал отдельные криминальные миссии и прогрессировал в должности, тут ты просто открываешь очередной кусок сюжета в виде странички дневника учительницы из Штатов, которая на свою голову связалась со школой в английской глубинке. Снова, и снова и снова. И поскольку локации повторяются, а предметы там не меняются, с третьего раза ты уже узнаёшь нужные к поиску предметы в лицо и испытываешь постоянное ощущение ""дня сурка"" - непонятно, как долго это всё ещё протянется!

В целом, для игры жанра Hidden Objects старой школы - вполне достойно. Но состарилась она плохо, увы. Новичку не порекомендую.

This is the third game in the Mystery Case Files series which is one of the longest running hidden object series there is with 13 games as of Aug, 13, 2016.  (5 are direct Ravenheart games, with 2 ""spinoff"" games (Madame Fate) and 1 tie-in (Dire Grove, Sacred Grove) to the Ravenhearst saga).  But enough history - so love it or hate it, this is still one of best Hidden Object games on the market today.  Old school it may be but this game was also one the first HO games to actually use a storyline.

Storyline: In 1894, a young Emma Ravenhearst arrives in Blackpool, England to begin a teaching career.  She meets a dashing young man by the name of Charles Dalimar.  He proposes to her and builds a manor house naming it Ravenhearst in her honor.  In present day there is a mystery surrounding this woman, Emma Ravenhearst and the manor built in her honor.  The Queen of England, yes really the Majesty herself, sends an incomplete and torn diary to you, the Mystery Detective (from Huntsville - 1st game), with the directive to find Emma's diary pages and solve the mysterious happenings surrounding Ravenhearst Manor.  Spoilers if I said more since 1/4 of the game is piecing (quite literally) the torn diary pages back together and reading Emma's life as it unfolds.   

Gameplay: As I said before: OLD SCHOOL.  The hidden object scenes, 30 plus, is a room within the manor or a place around the manor (a porch, 3 floors inside the manor, a tower, basement, cellar, shed, treehouse, garden, etc).  The scenes could be considered repetitive though the list find objects within the scene change with each new diary page chapter.  This repetitiveness is a GOOD thing since each diary page chapter is TIMED.  The initial time to solve a diary page chapter starts at 45 minutes but decreases in time to 30 minutes or less depending on the diary page chapter difficulty.  Fortunately the scene itself does not scramble the objects, so rote learning of where the list find objects are helps as the overall time decreases.  TIME DECREASES as more diary pages are found and assembled, and the AMOUNT OF OBJECTS needed to be found INCREASES.  (Go repetitiveness of room scenes and the objects staying put where found last.)  Each diary page chapter ends with an actually piece together ""jigsaw"" puzzle.  The diary page has been torn to bits and must be reassembled, all within the time limit.  Each illustrated pencil drawn page tells the on-going story of Emma and her ultimate fate.
     
A few words about the scenes and list find objects: Charles is an EXTREME hoarder.  Every scene is jammed packed with items (100s of items) and the player must find only 8-10 objects in each scene.  There are truly no unfairly hidden items there are simply 100s of them to sort through and the graphics, at least on my computer are comparable to the game I already own.  Each diary page chapter increases the overall amount of items needed to be found up to somewhere around 64 items in 30 minutes in about 8 different scenes.  (forgive the math, it is not  accurate just using the numbers as an example).  Fortunately the player does not have to find everything generally there are 2 or more objects in every diary page chapter that do not need to be found.

A word of ... warning about the find objects.  Looking for a plane now that could be a wood plane (a carpenter's tool) or an airplane which could a jumbo jet, a toy, a decal or a paper airplane.  Compass is another one, I recommend looking for a drafting compass first (that metal ""V"" looking thing with a pencil attached) before the round object with North and South.  The list find objects may or may not have more then one meaning to them.  Also for anyone born after say 1995 they may or may not recognize some of the find list items, like reel (which is a film reel), or phone (land line phones - can one even buy those anymore?) or even camera (since most things are now all digital on a cellphone).  Just thought I would warn everyone.      

The find objects as I stated before do not move randomly about in the scene fortunately.  However the player will get a few new objects to find in previously played scenes or simply new scenes to play as the game progresses.  Keep in mind as the game progresses the TIMER is getting less and less minutes on it, so knowing where find objects are is wonderful.  

Now a little spoiler besides being a mega-hoarder Charles has a hobby of creating some very intricate and puzzling locks on some doors.  These are the scenes that have a key hole on them.  I recommend looking for and starting with these keyhole scenes because these intricate, complex locks are puzzles.  I call them master puzzles.  These master puzzles have NO INSTRUCTIONS and MUST BE figured out from the clues provided somewhere on the puzzle itself.  Basically a master puzzle is a bunch of little puzzles that form a much bigger and more complex puzzle all with the intent to find the ""key"" that opens the door.  Remember solving these lovelies are part of the overall TIME which is why I recommend doing them first or one can skip them at the cost of 5 minutes.

Here are some examples of the types of mini-puzzles found on a master puzzle lock: 1) Need 5 batteries - oh that upside down sign says ""all on"", board above has little light bulbs all off, pull the lever and some of the lights turn on, now click on the lights to get them to all turn on, repeat until there are enough batteries.  2) Need to 2 eggs, the boot behind the chicken kicks it when the lever is pulled making the chicken nose dive into an empty feed dish, no feed, no egg, no egg to solve the colored egg puzzle below which opens the door.  So where is the feed, oh above the chicken but which of the 3 feeds or combination of the 3 feeds is needed? Look for clues.   And this why I recommend starting with the master lock puzzles.  

Last paragraph I promise.  The End Game, and of course it is timed, 30 minutes to be exact.  Object find 7 keys scattered throughout Ravenhearst and solve the final master lock puzzle.  Does not sound hard until one has to search through about 15 hoard filled rooms or places looking for a single key which may or may not be in that particular scene.  Fortunately the game helps a bit with that and once all the keys are found in that area (1st floor, outside, attic, etc) the area can not be assessed anymore limiting the search.  Then there is the end game master lock puzzle - no hints, no instructions, and NO SKIPPING.  If the player runs out of time, the game scrambles the keys into new locations and the player starts again.  (Actually at any point in the game if the player runs out of time, that diary page chapter starts from the beginning of that chapter.)  Do remember repetitive scenes and repetitive non-moving list objects in that scene are a bonus to the player especially when trying to beat the clock timer. 

Highly recommend, especially as a change of pace from the point and click, mini-game, hand-holding, hidden object games of today.

PS I own every single Mystery Case File game there is and have played them multiple times.  For those interested: Any Mystery Case File not found on Steam can be found on the Big Fish Games website.  And thank you BFG for bringing this series to Steam.

This means that there is no real map, no inventory, no walking around to different locations.  Each ""level"" consists of a series of scenes (""rooms"") that are cluttered with roughly 9849259025 items, and like modern HO game scenes you have to find around 8 objects in each room.  The ""level"" is cleared when you've found the right number of items; there are generally about three more items on the list than you need to progress so there is a little wiggle room if you really can't find something.  If you play for an extended time in one sitting, you'll find it gets a little repetitive; personally, I find this one better as a time killer once in a while rather than something to spend an afternoon playing.

The minigames are few and far between and consist of a puzzle to unlock a new room.  The puzzles are not the standard HO game fare that you may be used to if you play the more modern games.

Plot is unfolded through a series of jigsaw puzzles after each ""level"" that unlocks a journal entry.

The biggest complaint I'd have is resolution; this game is made for older computers and it shows.  Items are sometimes difficult to find due to graininess/blur.  However, it is perfectly playable and although it perhaps didn't age all that well from a graphical standpoint, it is enjoyable if you like purely hidden-object games.

So in the end, the recommendation is positive for people that enjoy the HO aspects of modern Artifex Mundi and similar titles.  If you play the more recent titles and hate the HO part, you'll want to avoid this as there is little else.

I would NOT get this game at full price; $9.99 is far too much for a ten-year-old game without any frills that didn't age that well.  Wait for a decent sale if you're planning to pick this up.",1453663674,1453663674,True,20,0,0.740611553192138672,0,True,False,False,False,

You are a detective and your job is to search around a huge mansion to find clues about a missing woman. There are basically 3 parts to the game. 1. You'll need to find, say, 30 items. The game will give you a few different rooms to search with a total of 35 items. So if you can't find a super sneakily hidden thingymabob, you can just switch rooms and search for other items. Once you find your ""30"" items, you go to 2. You need to complete a jigsaw puzzle. The picture will unlock a page of the missing woman's journal and you'll slowly unfold her enthralling story. Keep finding items and putting together jigsaws to complete the journal. So now I'll mention 3. You don't have access to all the mansion rooms at first. Many are locked and you have to do multiple things in a scene to get it open. Each puzzle scene is quite unique and you get no hints so you pretty much have to click on everything until you figure out what to do. This may sound annoying but, believe me, it's not. The locked doors are extremely fun to figure out and you really feel a sense of accomplishment when you solve them. The atmosphere of this game is spooky. Things will howl in the distance, floor and wall boards will creak, and a ghostly voice will let you know that, no, this mansion is not a pleasant place. :p I've played MCF: Ravenhearst many times on Bigfish and I DO have to warn that the Steam version is a bit wonky. You can't chat or take pics while playing and when you quit the game, Steam tells you it's still running so you have to shut it down via task manager. Major pain. Still, I have to give this game a thumbs up because I really enjoyed playing it, for the umpteenth time. Also, if you enjoy this little gem, there's a sequel - Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst which is much more like an Artifex Mundi game, with an extremely creepy story. Actually, I'm about to start playing that next! If you're an HO fan, I highly recommend Ravenhearst and Return to Ravenhearst, either on Steam or Bigfish or wherever else you might find them. :)",1451438506,1451438506,True,33,2,0.739563167095184326,0,True,False,False,False,

You have Emma Ravenhearst's diary, a young American that came in England in the 1870'. What will you uncover?

MCF is a well-known series that was one of the most famous during the first era of hidden objects games, though the series is still continued and was even ported to portable devices, like the DS, iPad or even on consoles like the Wii. This game is the 3rd installement and is opening the Ravenhearst story-arc.

The goal is simple: you clear scenes with a list of items, you open doors with elaborate locks (and with stuff that aren't used but are just there to confuse you) and at the end of a level, you have a jigsaw puzzle to build in order to read the next page in Emma's diary.

You have also five hints that can help you.

Ravenhearst isn't so different from what I remember of Huntsville and Prime Suspects, that I played years ago in retail versions. However, the setting is more dark and is orienting the series towards more paranormal/obscure storylines. I understand why they expanded this universe, as many questions are still unanswered, apart for Emma's fate.

And while the locks could get you some white hair, the hidden objects are respecting the code back then: some very obvious, others well hidden or so small that you're missing them easily (I still don't know where is the hotdog in the treehouse for example). Thanks god, you don't have to clear each scene completely as you need to find a required number of clues. Generally, you can let two items on the side.

Another thing is that Ravenhearst doesn't seem to be translated here on Steam. So, unless you're used to English, you'll have some difficulties to find some items. I still don't remember what a spigot is and a fudge stick isn't something I would have in mind.

The graphics are quite correct and creepy, even if you're marvelling at the number of rooms in that manor. I mean, a surveillance room, really?

Anyway, if anything, I'm glad to see Ravenhearst finally discounted during these sales. This one was on my wishlist since 2011... and while the price is reasonable, nowadays, you can find the game for less (I found some HOG in retails for 3 euros for example), so, yeah, a discount is probably the best way to acquire it.",1451124564,1451124564,True,11,0,0.66658473014831543,0,True,False,False,False,

Als ich diese Spiel vor vielen Jahren das erste Mal spielte, war ich leider noch an Big Fish Games gefesselt.
Es ist kein besonders aufregendes und auch nicht wirklich Können abverlangendes Spiel, aber für den Zeitvertreib zwischendurch wirklich gut  und ein wenig in Richtung Psychodrama gehend. Der zweite Teil - Return to Ravenhearst - ist um einiges besser, aber zum Verständnis der kompletten Story kommt man um diesen Teil hier einfach nicht herum.
