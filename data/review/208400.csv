A little indie company that has been making RPGs for well over 20 years now. It is a remake of Avernum from 2000, which was a remake of Exile Escape From The Pit from 1995. This review is specifically about the most recent Avernum Escape From The Pit from 2011.

The game takes place in a massive underground cave system called “Avernum”. The world has so much character in the way it was intricately designed. Consisting of multiple regions full of dungeons and settlements, with people that live there with their own philosophies and way of life. Outside of these locations, in the world map, you have tons of winding passage ways and nooks and crannies, and rivers, that can lead to an ambush or treasure or possibly a wandering trader. All of these things are why exploring this world is such a joy along with interacting with the various characters and NPCs that you come across in your travels. You also will often be greeted with very rich and detailed text that will describe any given location or point of interest throughout the world. This helps immerse you further, due to the game’s rather limited visuals not presenting the environments in the same level of detail as can be described in the text blurbs. Even with the amount of text the game presents you, it never feels overly verbose or gets in the way of the pacing through your adventure.

The combat in Avernum is turn-based and pretty straightforward and simple when you get the hang of it, especially compared to D&D and other RPGs with tactical combat. Despite its simplicity it is still fun and very rewarding as you level up and get more powerful spells. There is no level scaling at all in Avernum so if you go into an area that is too high level for you, the enemies will kick your butt. When you come back after hours of adventuring and have gotten new gear, you can really see how far you have come since that last time you encountered those enemies. 
As far as the spells are concerned, they are fine but it does feel like there is something missing. There aren’t really any opportunities to use spells outside of combat aside from the dispel barrier spell. And the negative status effect spells like daze and howl of terror weren’t able to affect most late game enemies due to their high mind resistances. However my two fighters always got affected by daze, charm, and terrify almost every time it was casted on them, but thankfully you get a spell that dispels hostile effects eventually which was incredibly useful.

Pros and cons:

Pros:

[list]
[*]Great world building and a very unique setting for an RPG.
[*]Fun and interesting world map to explore.
[*]Great writing and characters. Well written and descriptive text that describes every dungeon and location you explore.
[*]Simple, easy to learn but satisfying combat.
[*]Multiple endings.
[/list]

Cons:

[list]
[*]Lacking some variety in the spells system. Hardly any utility spells outside of combat and there aren’t enough single enemy damaging spells, most are cone attacks or AOE.

Summary: I remember Avernum: Escape From The Pit being a great game even though I wrote a review only about 7 years after I completed it. Why exactly it was good, was hard to remember since the last time I touched it was 2016. I remember felt like a good fantasy role playing game, and had lots of interesting towns and places. It had tons of secrets, dungeons, and a lingering feeling of how someone had to get out of the Pit in Avernum, a sprawling, huge underground world. Avernum was an alien world, but it also felt like home at some point.

 

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] It has a clear objective, which was to get out of Avernum. That kept me going, I believe. When you do finally think it's finally over, you can still make a choice, which was interesting.
[*] It had secrets leading to the crystal soul series. We can't access crystal soul area, but it was motivating to try out more of Avernum.
[*] It had nice, iconic pixel graphics, reminiscent of the old isometric 3d games. Not too backward, and had nice touch. It has an interesting way to combine 4 people into a single trail of people who walk and fight. Interesting.
[*] It had nice mechanics, with a good touch of magic and skills combined.
[*] It has a good narrative, and a well-balanced lore, not too much, not too little.
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] You might not like this kind of rouge-like rpg games which lacks modern graphics. Settings seem a bit limited now in the world of 2023. Might be a matter of taste though. 
[*] I remember getting stuck a number of times. Difficulty was high especially towards the end.
[*]  [spoiler] Haha, I don't remember a big secret but figuring them out was truely fun. However, good luck figuring them out by yourself [/spoiler] 
[*]  Well if you get stuck you can always use [url=https://www.neoseeker.com/avernum-escape-from-the-pit/faqs/885019-avernum-eftp.html] Avernum walkthroughs [/url]

Ви граєте командою з чотирьох героїв та після невеликого вступу ваша команда починає досліджувати відкритий світ навколо. Й це найцікавіший аспект гри, тому що світ тут велікій та різноманітний, кожна частина містить щось цікаве, це може бути локація, або якийсь квест, або коротка зустріч з якимось персонажем. Тому мандрувати цим світом захоплююче, сама історія та герої роблять цей світ живим.

Бої тут покрокові, але вони досить швидки, та вороги по різному себе ведуть, відчуваєш прокачку команди, взагалі відчуття прогресу в грі - це один із кращих елементів, якщо спочатку ти взагалі не розумієш, що і як та помираєш від кожного бандита, то згодом відчуваєш занурення у світ гри та зростання сили команди.

При цьому через те, що світ гри обмежений в ресурсах - герої теж це відчувають, грошей може бракувати, тому що вони дуже потрібні в грі й це дуже класна частина, адже, на відміну від RPG, гроші тут важливі всю гру.

Графіка у грі проста, але досить зрозуміла, тому на неї перестаєш звертати увагу практично одразу. І якщо графіка здається проблемою, це зовсім не так - так, вона проста, але при цьому показує все, що потрібно.

It immediately warps you back to the mid 90s. 

The isometric gameplay is crisp and snappy.  The interface has no secrets.  It is peak WYSIWYG, and needs little explanation as you start adventuring.

The game is massive.  Exploring the larger over(under?)world map or any of the towns and dungeons as they gradually reveal themselves is a bit of a lost art form. This game does it perfectly.  It somehow feels modern, standing next to something like Shadowrun, but also feels like something you'd be ordering from a catalog in 1995 via snailmail.

It's a very atmospheric.  The series always had that going for it, and it was not lost in this version.  Exploring the world below the world, uncovering the detailed social structures that have formed from all the other exiles, and fighting different monster tribes is an interesting and rewarding time.  The overall adventure complete with the side-quests available in towns, caves, towers, etc. gives you plenty to do, and you really are generally able to just... go.   You aren't hand held.  You just go.  Start walking.  Get a boat.  Sail around.  Find a cave?  Go see what's there.  Died?  Don't go there for a bit.  Explore elsewhere.  There is always something to find.  There's always some little switch or dirt pile you missed that you can get later. 

The character system is as classic as it gets, allowing you to customize your characters for various melee, missile, and magical playstyles.  The adventuring skills and traits also give a nice tabletop RPG vibe as you need to make sure your party is competent enough to deal with adventuring perils/secrets (cave lore), or be able to read magical scripts found in crypts (arcane lore).   This gives you a great deal of depth without being clunky, overwhelming, or unbalanced. 

The battles are also so tabletop RPG style it's nuts.  It really feels like these games are spiritual successors to the AD&D Goldbox series with the way the grid-based fights play out.   Maneuvering your wizards to shoot cones of lightning around, or strategically knocking enemies back is a really satisfying time.  The battle system is simple, effective, and most of all, fun.

The games addicting.  It gives you that ""just a little bit more exploring"" itch in your brain that you will be forever scratching.

It turns out that cool graphics, atmospheric music, and voice acting aren’t everything.  A well written story with plenty of choices, the ability to succeed with many different playstyles, and just the right mix of straightforward, but fun design makes for one heck of a gaming experience.  

The game is a bit ugly, but the world is a series of giant caves, so you could argue there likely wouldn't be much beauty there.  There is no music, but if you think about it, Avernum has no music (I literally found one musical instrument in the entire game) and its people are still working on some sort of culture.  I think it kind of makes sense.

С точки зрения игрового процесса, игра не предоставляет уникального опыта.
Классов у игровых персонажей нет, прокачивать можно как угодно. Бои обладают некоторыми тактическими элементами, но довольно простыми.
Игровой движок не технологичный. Простенькая графика точно отпугнет большинство игроков.
В игре очень много текстов. Большинство событий и окружающего пространства описывается художественным слогом, что позволяет задействовать воображение, что в определенной степени компенсирует графический примитивизм.
У игры есть свои козырь. Это аутентичный мир, очень атмосферный.
Авернум - это гигантское подземелье, со своей экосистемой. Местная флора - грибы да лишайники. Местная фауна- преимущественно рептилии и насекомые. Некая Империя, крупнейшее жесткое тоталитарное государство человеческой расы, ссылает всех неугодных в Авернум при помощи магии телепортации. Таких ссылочных буквально тысячи, и это не только представители человеческой расы. Империя предполагает, что в этом подземном мире все будут бороться за выживание, и рано или позно перемрут, поэтому о них можно не беспокоиться. Тем не менее, ссылочные научились сносно жить в этом негостепреимном мире, построили множество населенных пунктов по всему Авернуму, и даже создали свое государство (по ходу сюжета выяснится, что даже - не одно).
Представители различных рас преимущественно враждуют друг с другом. Основная раса - человеческая, две другие крупнейшие расы - нефилимы (людокошки) и слитзерикай (людоящеры). Более малочисленные разумные рассы: гоблины, гиганты, разумные паукообразные, гремлины, демоны, драконы и другие.
Игрок управляет новой группой сосланных в Авернум. Цели в игре не ставят, ты исследуешь мир и походу сам решаешь что хочешь делать. По факту в игре есть 3 главных задачи, и даже можно выполнить их сразу все (но только если в определенной последовательности). При этом игра в большей степени линейна, не так уж и много сюжетных развилок.
В игре множество интересных персонажей, особенно удались разной степени безумности волшебники. Вообще магия играет ключевую роль в жизни Авернума. Без магии человечество не выжило бы, ведь именно волшеники придумали способ выращивать питательные грибы, а также воздвигли местные города. С другой стороны, те же волшебники ответственны за нашествия нежити и демонов. Еще удались драконы. Каждый является личностью со своим характером, все из них являются кладезем мудрости (ведь их жизненный опыт составляет века), но при этом имеют свое мнение по поводу взаимодействия с представителями других рас (преимущественно пренебрежительное, а иногда и потребительское).
Авернум очень интересно исследовать (пешком или плавать на лодке). Есть не только множество точек интереса, но и различные случайные или триггерные события, столкновения с периодически появляющимися врагами. В этом подземелье множество секретов и труднодоступных мест, доступ к котором появится не сразу, а только с появлением дополнительных возможностей (навроде артефакта ""Сфера Трални"", позволяющая совершать короткие перелеты).
Если война с демонами довольна банальна, то вот противостояние с Империей сильно интригует, ведь все встречные персонажи описывают ее как неодолимую могущественную силу. Что удивляет, ведь даже король демонов Гра-Хот их так не пугает. Тем интереснее бросить этой силе вызов.

I played it for 2 hours and immediately ordered it so I could get my code to unlock the full game, get my manual, hint book, and 3.5 Floppy copy.  Such a wonderful game with old style graphics, great combat, a deeply atmospheric setting, and the story telling was superb.  I beat the game multiple times and soon followed it up with Crystal Souls, and my favorite, Exile 3: Ruined World.  Avernum is a beefed up version of Exile and it is a gem!  The same story driven game, with deep character customization, excellent graphics and a world setting that I wish they would put to pen and paper.

Les graphismes et l'interface était claire et les éléments du jeu bien reconnaissable. 

Aujourd'hui, le remake:
La majorité du gameplay a été charcuté, mutilé et amputé ! Le gameplay et la mechanique du jeu n'a plus rien a voir avec l'original. 
L'interface du jeu très peu lisible et peu contrasté. Les elements du jeu sont minuscule (taille d'une fourmi sur l'ecran) et non reconnaissable. Je vous dit même pas le temps passé a chercher les ennemis, les éléments du décors et les objets au sols. C'est juste injouable et impossible d'identifier un type d'ennemi pour jouer et combattre avec une strategie gagnante. 
Et les combats ne donne plus que des déchets sans valeur et très peu d'argent. Les combats deviennent très rapidement répétitifs et ennuyeux. 

Il y a ÉNORMÉMENT de mauvais choix (lisez les autres commentaires negatifs pour les connaitre) dans le design et le remake de ce jeu et je vais pas tous les cités.

The graphics aren't much, and there's no voice acting, but the gameplay is fun, the writing is good, and the game just works. For the fogeys among us, this is a remake of the 1995 shareware game Exile: Escape From the Pit (which is awesome, but getting it to work is a nightmare).

The plot: The Empire controls the whole world. Well, they control the surface. Decades ago, they discovered a one way portal to a series of underground caverns. After a failed expedition, they started using it as a giant prison, throwing in anybody inconvenient, including your party of four adventurers. Maybe you were an actual criminal or rebel, or maybe you were just a malcontent, oddball, or member of a minority religion. The game doesn't say, so it's up to you to decide. It's also up to you to decide if your ultimate goal is to make a new home underground, escape back to the surface, or take revenge on the Empire (or you can do all three, as you can keep adventuring after succeeding).

The gameplay: Pretty standard fare. It's 45 degree isometric square grid. Overworld movement shows your whole party moving in a single square, with some roving encounters, but mostly going between stationary points. Moving around in a location has each character take a square, and they walk in a line. Once combat starts, the game is turn based with your characters moving independently. Skills are also pretty standard. Combat has blades, polearms, ranged, and requisite abilities. Magic is divided into arcane and divine, with the bonus abilities (e.g. extra spell damage) applying to both. There are also a few skills that are neither (e.g. tool use, which lets you pick locks and disable traps). While is sounds like nothing special, it is well executed. 4/5 could use some more polish, but is worth far more than the asking price. 6/5 when weighted against the price tag.",1682343494,1682343494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Avernum: Escape From the Pit is a classic role-playing game that immerses you in a deep and engaging storyline set in a vast and varied game world. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros:
Deep and engaging storyline with multiple side quests and choices.
Large and immersive game world with varied environments and interesting characters.
Well-developed character customization system with plenty of skills and abilities to choose from.
Challenging gameplay with strategic turn-based combat and resource management.
Great value for money with dozens of hours of gameplay.

Cons:
Dated graphics and user interface, which may not appeal to modern gamers.
Steep learning curve for newcomers to the genre, especially in the early game.
Some players may find the game's slow pace and emphasis on exploration and dialogue rather than action to be dull.
Limited voice acting and repetitive sound effects may detract from immersion.
Some players may find the game's punishing difficulty to be frustrating or off-putting.

Дивный гость из страны, где всегда уют девяностых, что греет тёплым пледом тем больше, чем дальше человечество по неосмотрительности уходит в стужу современности. Первая игра в серии. Или одиннадцатая? 

Графика срастается со взором спустя час или два и никогда больше не отвлекает. Ролевая система скудна, но на удивление приятна. Для прохождения придётся запастись своей музыкой или книжками. Есть отличный русификатор, добавляющий багов в игру :) Всё как любили 20 лет назад.
После обучения открыты почти все дороги, а в концах этих дорог подземелья ждут, когда их сокровища рассуют по карманам, тайники и секреты, как влюблённые аниме девочки, делают всё возможное, чтобы вы случайно на них натолкнулись, а финальные задания точат зубы, зная, что вам придётся скрежетать своими дольше, чем хотелось бы — но на то он и финал, причём тройной, как в этих ваших масс эректах, только за выбранный путь поди ещё поборись.
А в города Авернума, наверное, заходим не только чтобы вытряхнуть вышеупомянутые карманы, а потому, что это ещё и интересно. Короткие сценки бытописания, диалоги не без иронии, цели, с каждой из которых соглашаешься. Преступник в игре всегда будет ""хитрее чёрта, глупее вороны"". Волшебник всегда будет нервным сумасбродом. Злодей всегда будет смеяться над героями и драматично погибать. И в части сюжета, и в части т.н. worldbuilding-а, создания цельной картины мира и заселяющих его людей, Авернум сильно напоминает первые Готики. Все настолько просто, что не может не работать. И работает, и продолжает во 2-й и 3-й частях. В 30-х годах разраб, даст Бог, переиздаст и вторую трилогию, и это одна из немногих вещей, за которые в будущем можно остаться спокойным.

Игры всегда давали только поле для погружения, верить в мир и его персонажей или нет всегда решал игрок. Кому-то проговариваемая мотивация, уникальная физиономия каждого нпс, друзья на всю игру важны так же, как важно современным игрокам количество полигонов у волоса в носу у монстра. Кому-то показалось бы, что недостаёт привычных ныне вариативных диалогов, внутрипартийных шуток или живого окружения. но... в ролёвке старой закалки это было бы даже лишним.

Avernum: Escape From The Pit è uno di quei giochi che non possono definirsi per tutti. Con una grafica ed un’interfaccia entrambe datate, fa della storia di fondo e delle sfaccettature correlate la sua forza. Il titolo è sicuramente consigliato per chi apprezza il genere, mentre per i giocatori cresciuti con interfacce più moderne l’incontro potrebbe essere ostico. Considerando che la saga ideata da Spiderweb è composta da tre remake (dei sei capitoli inizialmente pubblicati), doveste appassionarvi alla storia troverete tantissimo pane per i vostri denti.

Although principally the work of just one man, Avernum displays all the design aptitude of much more prominent isometric RPGs, and though this particular set of remakes came out in the 2010's, they bare many of the more endearing characteristics from PC design in the late 90's. If you're looking for a comparison, I would say the original Fallout is probably Avernum's closest (well-known) cousin.

Like many such games, you're going to be reading your way through the game, but the writing is generally well-crafted and illustrious, good-humored enough to stay amusing, and succinct enough not to grow overly tedious. The game hits a sweet spot for non-linearity: there is a real sense of progression as you expand the range of your travels into yet more hostile lands, but it feels very much like the emergent result of how the world fits together rather than a clumsy dictate. This quality underpins the primary gameplay loop of exploration, conversation, and hard fighting, which tends to cycle at a satisfactory pace. I offer praise for difficulty settings- ""torment"" difficulty offers a very fair challenge for a well-informed player with a good party-building plan and a willingness to play some dirty tricks against the game systems, where ""hard"" should offers approximately the same deal to a player who is astute but coming in blind- just as long as you're not TOO impulsive, you should be able to carry on through a long-term mistake or two. The developer's attitude is such that there is one very specific cheat code that will undo one very specific mistake that can keep you from attaining one of the three game-winning conditions, but you should be able to avoid even the need for that by just minding your manners.",1670895609,1670895609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

So much to see, so much to explore.  Open world, and except for increasingly dangerous foes, nothing to stop you from doing things in the order you want to.  You can't get stuck, there are only a few game-ending choices (all plot-driven).

What a world!  Many towns.  Many dungeons.  A lot of seemingly empty land between, with special encounters peppered throughout.

It's a very old-school RPG with limited stats and improvement options, although what is there is interesting enough.  One downside to the open-world concept is the amount of backtracking involved to tie up loose ends.  There is a quick travel option, of sorts, but it still leaves a lot to be desired.

Некая Империя держит население в стальных тисках. Раньше уничтожала всех врагов империи, но позже решила ссылать их в подземелье - гигантскую сеть пещер под названием Авернум. Среди врагов империи затесалась и компания героев под управлением игрока. И перед ним становится задача: отомстить Империи, обезопасить Авернум и вернуться на поверхность. 

Под управлением игрока оказывается команда из четырёх персонажей. Игра позволит настроить каждого на своё усмотрение - выбрать ему профессию (воин, жрец, волшебник и тому подобное) или же создать что-нибудь своё. Однако это вовсе не значит, что у нас получится создать абсолютно неповторимого бойца - прокачка тут довольно примитивная. При повышении уровня на персонажа выдают по одному очку атрибутов, по два очка навыков, также раз в несколько уровней выдаётся по одному очку способностей. И лучше все качать воинам-танкам силу и выносливость, а магам - интеллект. В навыках немного поинтересней - четыре ""школы"" боя (мечи, копья, луки, метательное) и две школы магии - по одной на магов и на жрецов. Также есть специальные навыки - ""владение инструментами"" (совмещающий в себе обезвреживание ловушек и взлом замков); ""знание пещер"" (позволяет вовремя замечать ловушки и тайники); ""знание тёмных искусств"" (наши маги-жрецы так научатся читать встречаемые талмуды с заклинаниями). Лично у меня бегала команда из мечника (благо в игре есть пара великолепных мечей), лучника, мага и жреца. И чувствовал я себя вполне комфортно. 

Авернум - это не просто сеть пещер. Это довольно большая карта. В ней несколько мирных городов и множество мест, где наш отряд с удовольствием отправят на обед. Населяют Авернум не только люди, но и несколько других видов живых существ. Бестиарий тут занятный - от людей, нежити до драконов. Откуда тут города? Сперва эти пещеры населяли другие хозяева, потом Империя отправила сюда экспедицию, вооружённую особыми артефактами (их потом наш отряд сможет найти и использовать), во в качестве ссыльных частенько сюда отправляли не просто бандитов, но и строителей, магов и прочих профессионалов. 

Игровой процесс состоит из изучения Авернума, выполнения различных заданий и пошаговых боёв. Как я уже сказал, здесь несколько городов, где можно набрать задания (всякого мусора а-ля, ""убей 20 ящериц"" тут нет. Самое близкое - убить десяток летучих мышей обернётся... другим приключением. А бои, за счёт неплохого бестиария порой занимают немало времени. Всевозможный лут, который накапливается за время путешествий тут можно складировать в бездонный, общий для каждого члена команды, мешок, из которого потом можно одним кликом мышки всё продать. Несколько цепочек заданий выдаются противоборствующими фракциями, что немного добавляет вариативности. 

Но это игра не без недостатков.
Во-первых, тут очень мелкий интерфейс - особенно это вызывает неудобство при поиске кладов или скрытых кнопок. 
Во-вторых, проблема русификатора. Очень качественная работа лежит в руководствах. Перевели блестяще, однако этот перевод немного нарушил работу игры и в ряде моментов она может вылетать. Решается это возвращением на язык оригинала. Файлы сохранения не ломаются. 
В-третьих, игра старомодная - читать придётся очень много. Если читать не любите - проходите мимо.

Avernum is a surprisingly open world with many quests for multiple safeholds and towns scattered across the underground world of, well, Avernum. You play as a quartet of people whose roles you can alter at the start of the game- (priest, mage, etc), and have multiple ways of levelling up and picking attributes for every one of your characters separately throughout. The only goal really, is to get the hell out of this place, and the game leaves you many options on what else to do. You can be peaceful, you can be evil (if you're strong enough to beat the towns and safeholds of course) and you can be neutral if you please, or be a mixture of everything, i won't tell.

There are dialog choices, but I'm not sure that they hugely affect game-play. Thus my statement that it is a non-RPG. This is from the era when games were billed as RPG, but were not actual Role-Play Games, like most of the games on the market today. A true RPG has you build a character and play true to that character. At least here, you are not doing power-builds.

There is a level system, and you find items that will make your character more powerful. I do not know if items have level limits. I have not yet seen evidence that they do. 

This is a turn-based system, which I frankly like. I don't like the chaos of real-time battle.

This one introduces the races that you will be able to play in sequels. In this one, they are your enemy, along with the Empire, which is a heavy-handed dictatorship. They threw you into the world-below-the-surface.

Avernum: Escape from the Pit. A remake of a remake of Exile: Escape from the Pit, which I can only assume was a pretty solid game back in the day. I enjoyed the original remake (Avernum I) well enough. That is to say it was clunky, poorly balanced, and devoid of direction. But for its many faults, it was still quaint, nostalgic, and diverting.

That is not the case with this rendition. Somehow, Vogel managed to take his clunky, unbalanced design, and make both of those aspects immeasurably worse. For example, tell me how it is that 98% of your enemies (which always outnumber your party) can, with every basic attack, manage to hit multiple party members, and/or cause one or more debuffs that prevent any action at all for at least one turn. Meanwhile, when you do manage to get an attack in, it misses half the time, no matter how much combat skill your character has. Furthermore, best I can tell, the additional clunkiness was caused exclusively to add some half-assed animations, for the additional cost of graphical detail and distinctiveness (presumably because such features would be more effort to animate). The result is just remarkably bland. Certainly not worth the remake.

If you're curious about this game, my best recommendation is to not waste your resources, and instead go with an earlier rendition for cheaper. GOG.com makes it easy.

- Некоторые квесты то ли я запорол то ли игра,не пройти потому что на месте нет человека который должен быть там,благо это второстепенные задания

It has reasonable writing (nothing blew me away but nothing made me groan either) and decent combat and progression systems.  The in-game economy was always relevant - I felt like I didn't have enough money to buy everything I wanted(there are plenty of ways to sink money into additional character upgrades) but I had enough to pick and choose between some useful upgrades.

The game does not do much hand-holding with the order in which you should tackle things - it is possible to get into fights which are too hard for you at current character levels (esp. on harder difficulty).  I think this is mostly a good thing - it allows more freeform exploration, but worth noting.  (Especially that end-boss-of-dungeon fights can be significantly harder than the fights to clear the rest of the dungeons)

The soft level cap(character progression slows significantly after level 30) was tuned pretty well - at the end of the game 3/4 characters were at soft cap, so it was about right. 

Keyboard support is pretty good - not so much for movement, but being able to cast spells and target enemies with the keyboard was much appreciated instead of having to use the mouse for everything.

Cons:
I thought the game was a little too long.  I played 85 hours - some of that was having to load a saved game and try a tough fight again (or possibly more than twice), but some of it felt like pointless combat padding (especially some of the later dungeons where only the end boss was actually difficult and the fights on the way got tiresome - I'll make an exception for one VERY late dungeon where this was put to good effect)

It was very difficult sometimes to select squares in combat for movement if the space was crowded - the cursor tended to want to select an enemy/character instead of the empty square, and since action points and movement can really matter this was occasionally very irritating.

I mentioned keyboard support being good, one limitation to that is that I wish the keyboard shortcuts for enemies were more stable (when targeting a spell on an enemy you can type a letter 'a', 'b', etc but a new enemy moving into view can reorder everything - so if you're trying to play a bit faster it's very easy to end up targeting something you didn't intend because the enemy that was 'b' last turn isn't 'b' anymore.  The interface _does_ show you what it is, the update is just irksome)


I would have preferred a game about 33% shorter (so more like 60 hours for me).

Now over 15 years later, I wanted to go on a nostalgia trip and see what the game was actually about... :P Though I mostly played Avernum 2 & 3 as a kid, so to be honest there wasn't that big of a dose of nostalgia involved with this installment.

[h1]Comparison to Avernum 1[/h1]
The first thing I have to say is that this new and improved version has [b]so much more[/b] quality of life fixes compared to Avernum 1: you don't have to keep track of quests by yourself in Notepad as there's an actual Journal in-game and you also don't have to identify every single piece of random magical loot you come upon. For these updates alone, I'd be ready to recommend this new and enhanced version. This new version also changes how some spells work and completely overhauls the skill system. All in all, even though it's different from the previous iteration, I'd say that it's easier to get into and more intuitive. One of my pet peeves though is that you [b]have[/b] to start combat when you see an enemy and can't just walk up to him and slap him with the first guy in your party.

The graphics – while still not state-of-the-art – are pleasant enough to look at and a huge upgrade from the original trilogy. Especially if you have never played any Avernum game before you won't even have the nostalgia factor, so I recommend sticking with this version over Avernum 1 (which is available on e.g. GOG, if you're interested)!

[h1]Avernum: Escape From the Pit[/h1]
The first part of the Avernum trilogy still holds up as a nice experience in 2022, around 27 years after the publishing of the original game. Combat is a big part of the game, as is reading lots and lots of text – as that's how information about the environment, characters and quests is delivered. Frankly, it's almost like playing tabletop D&D and getting descriptions from the DM (and as you'll also notice from some types of monsters present in the game as well)! So expect to be [b]reading[/b] a lot in Avernum!

When looking at the whole game, combat is quite decent. It's not exactly perfectly balanced though, as the start of the game can be very hard, while towards the end it gets very easy (especially on Normal difficulty) if you have a couple of decent spellcasters in your party. The skill trees are very flexible and allow you to also easily train your melee/ranged characters to do a bit of spell slingin' to help with healing, for example. It's also quite hard to make an unplayable character as long as you at least max out your main ability score. On Normal difficulty the game is quite well balanced once you get past the rough start – and it's quite fun.

The writing in the game is quite clever and fun. The world is completely open, and you can explore it in any order you wish – though tough enemies will bash in your skull if you stray too far at low levels. There are a variety of side quests to complete and instead of one main story there are three great quests that grant you a final end sequence – and a bonus one for completing all three. The story isn't anything [i]that special[/i], but it nicely introduces the world of Avernum to you, sets it up for the next games, and gives you an idea where to go next in the world (unless you're just running around exploring like me :] ).

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you love the old-school (C)RPG genre, you should definitely give this game a try and see if you like it! It's a fun break from more modern games while still giving a satisfying experience featuring both fun combat and lots of descriptions of the world and events in D&D-style. If your interest is piqued, Spiderweb Software also offers a bunch of similar games that continue the Avernum saga!

 Exile -> Avernum 1 -> Avernum 1: Escape from the pit 
While this means progressively updated stuff, it's still OLD. Most of it's ""problems"" or limitations arise from the age. The other most annoying stuff is that there is no zoom, so you absolutely have to play at a by Today's standards very low (e.g.: 1280x800) resolution unless you have way better eyes than most of us.

Avernum: Escape From the Pit is a classic isometric RPG, more like Icewind Dale than Bladur's Gate, but fully indie: action, environment puzzles and a quite acceptable lore in the background, all this on an open world map that is oh so much larger than any of the abovementioned. While I did not find the lore as alluring as that of the BG series, it might be because I was a kid back then.

The games use their own system instead of a (modified) D&D, with a action point turn-based system. It can be somewhat abused in some places, and I really wish the exact point costs were more clear every time.

Controls are not the best due to isometric and figures being taller then their own squares, almost totally obscuring the one abive them. But there is numpad movement too.

Very much a classic RPG, it will certainly scratch the itch for anyone who grew up playing old D&D games and early DOS / MAC titles in the same genre.

Positives include that the world is deep, has well developed lore and maps, with tons to explore and plenty of secrets to find. Music and city sounds are vibrant and bring a game with otherwise retro visuals to life.  The in game manual clarifies spells and stats well, and the game is easy to pick up.

My only complaints might be that this game some quirks,  and the challenges of using the quest log can be a bit of an annoyance.

The UI is totally overhauled, and the graphics are much more detailed and rich. The game is also huge - took me around 40-60 hours to beat. Playing most of the side quests can even add more time on, so yes there is great value in the game.

I love this game. I think the underground empire for exiles setting is unique and extremely interesting to me. Unlike a lot of other generic fantasy settings, I found myself identifying with the characters and thinking a lot about what I would do in their situation.

Somehow a game by a small team has more quality content than just about every other game out there. The writing especially is incredible; full of wonderfully vivid descriptions and creative setups.

There are essentially two games here too: the normal game, and the torment version. The torment version will have you planning out builds in advance, doing whatever you can to exploit the mechanics of the game, hoarding ever-so-valuable potions, and completing a quarter of a dungeon before reaching a difficulty wall that will force you to go do another quarter of a dungeon to level up so you can advance in the first one. My only complaints are that some of the battles in torment do feel just a tad unfair, even in the face of the rest of the game's brutally difficult content. Occasionally you'll be forced to reload a save 40 times in a row, praying for RNG to give you a specific outcome just so you can survive the first round of a fight. It's all good fun.

I wouldn't say that was why it succeeded in finding an audience back then, nor would I say that is what makes it special now. What makes it [i]special[/i] is that it was developed in that style intentionally, with an eye and an understanding for all the things which its format allowed it to do and do well. And what it does is give you a large, strange, unknown world, full of dungeons (which are in turn full of traps, monsters, and the occasional exercise in problem-solving) and just enough story and context to make each one of them seem different, important and interesting. Encounters need enough thought to get through that your input as a player is important to the success (and survival) of your characters, but are not so involved that coming across them when they are not expected becomes a chore. There's a good, solid, enjoyable game here; solid mechanics laying the foundations for a genuine, straight-forward adventure, self-aware without needing to excuse its premise under layers of irony and deprecation. 
Some (mostly optional) parts of the game are more text-heavy and narratively involved, and if you enjoy these then Spiderweb & Vogel's other offerings will probably be even more up your alley. But Avernum itself (and the rest of its series) is very much an adventure at heart, and as long as you can derive some entertainment from maneuvring into position around a difficult enemy, or finding a lever that opens a secret passage in a brewery cellar which turns out to be full of [i]spooky ghosts[/i] - then this game has hours and hours of that to offer. And those hours pack a lot in - I have 22 hours on my time played as of this writing, and I honestly thought it would have been more; I'd got through a decent chunk of the first act/area of the game, and made a few inroads into the second.
The format of the game is an isometric turn-based role-playing game, where you control a party of four characters - so if you're a fan of that format, this is definitely worth checking out; if you're not, it doesn't do anything appreciably outside of that arena that might convince you - but if you're interested in the genre and are looking for a good example of what it's all about and why people like games like these in the first place, this one is a definite contender.

This is a game for RPG fans who don't care about production values or anything - it's made by a very small, but reputable team so you aren't getting anything flashy, but you get a solid game that can get your monies worth.

I wouldn't say anything is spectacular (again it's not a AAA blockbuster type game), but I found it fun for the most part.  I found the difficulty just fine for the most part - there's a clear progression in enemy types (i.e. goblins to Nephil to Nephar to Slith to things like various demons and strong monsters) so you can usually can tell if you are ready for the next area by how easy it is to face certain enemies.

That said, there were times where some foes felt annoying - particularly bosses. They never felt hard to me as much as they just seemed like simple bullet sponges.  They were no threat as long as I had my protections up but it felt like it took needlessly long to kill them.

Years later, I would learn that the Exile trilogy was one of the darlings of the small ‘90s indie scene, where a few brave souls tried to make a living by selling their games by mail. It’s ridiculously large and ambitious, the work of a young developer who doesn’t know how to say “no, that’s out of scope.”

Avernum: Escape from the Pit is the second remake of the original (2000’s Avernum being the first), and while the developer is much older and wiser, he tried to retain as much of the original content and design as possible, while making it more approachable for us modern players who don’t want to get locked out of winning or have to use a pen and paper to keep our own quest journal. Avernum is most famous for its titular setting, an underground realm of cast-offs from an ill-defined surface empire. It explores and models this world in great detail, and what the game lacks in memorable characters or an overarching plot, it more than makes up for in the joys of exploring and inhabiting that world. Along the way is a whole host of sidequests and locations, from the serious to the goofy, and a surprisingly complex structure of having three different main questlines with three different endings, which the character can pursue individually or collectively; I did all three, and one of them (involving a desperate assassination in the surface empire above) managed to deliver a remarkable amount of tension and drama in what was essentially a no-budget game.",1638662169,1638662169,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Notes:[/h1]
[olist]
[*] This game is an updated graphical version of the original ""Avernum"" game. It supersedes the original in all ways.
[*] Excellent writing where it feels like your choices actually do impact the gameplay. You will see your impacts on the world.
[*] A good introduction to Spiderweb Software games. I recommend starting here and then moving into the ""Geneforge"" series - the first game of which got a similar remake/remaster in February 2021.
[*] I played this for approximately 50 hours to experience all endings and as much content as I was aware existed. (Alaskan winters get to you, dude.) While the game never felt its length during play, I was pretty burnt out toward the end. Though I reckon that's entirely my doing and not the game's fault.
[*] There are tons of ways to diversify your party, though the game certainly favors melee characters. That being said, I can't think of any point where I felt like I [i]had[/i] to have a certain character type to proceed in a mission.
[*] I ended up getting pretty invested in the lore - and I can usually ignore the writing of 90% of RPGs. Perhaps due to its old-school background, this game (as well as many Spiderweb games) has a flavor that's hard to pin down. Think of ""RuneScape"" circa 2002/2003 - and I mean that very positively.
[*] Interactions with towns and other environments will primarily take place through navigating menus and doing skill checks. This integration is rare in many modern RPGs - the one off the top of my head is ""Sunless Sea"".

I now own all of their currently available games and have played through them all on ""normal"" difficulty (recently restarted Avernum on ""hard""). 

1. These games work; I have not encountered a single bug or glitch in any of them. I thought I had found one in Avernum 2 but it turns out I needed to talk to a very specific person before I could turn in the object (a certain quest involved returning a certain tome to a certain powerful being).

2. Low system requirements: These games are mostly remakes of titles originally released in the mid-90s, so they have only received some minor GI and OS updates. Up until recently I played these games on a 2010 HP home office laptop (1.4 Ghz dual-core CPU; not meant for modern gaming)

3. Superbly written and edited: Not only do these games have unique locations and characters, rich dialogue, and deep world backstories; but, spelling and grammar errors are few and far between. 
NOTE: You will be reading EVERYTHING; there is NO voice acting, nor was there ever meant to be.

4. Common Game Mechanics: With the exception of the Geneforge series (which allows you to literally create your own creature followers), all Spiderweb games use the same easy-to-learn combat system and game mechanics. The games can also be played using mouse/keyboard only, or both (I think the game may also be available for phone/tablet).

5. Well-balanced: except for two of the three main ""bosses"" in Avernum 1 and one main ""boss"" in Geneforge 5, I found game play to be challenging enough to feel rewarding but not so much as to be frustrating; although sometimes, I would almost swear that ""dungeon bosses"" have more health than all other monsters in said dungeon combined.

6. Open-World: All Spiderweb games are ""Open-World"", allowing you to explore freely; although, monsters in certain areas are stronger/weaker than others (except for Queen's Wish)

7. Character Customisation: Visual customisation of characters is extremely limited. Skills, however, need not be limited by class; it is entirely possible to have a Berserker who can wield Arcane Magic or a Hedge Mage who is a master with Two-Handed Weapons. Originally this was penalized by having cross-classed skills cost more; but, I think an update three or four years ago removed this penalty. The Avadon series has a unique skill-tree for each class however.


Overall, my only regret was that I didn't purchase the games as a bundle (which would have saved me about $60)",1633293240,1633293240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

How wrong I was.  This is a great game that fires on all cylinders.  Just don’t expect triple A polish.  That’s not what this game is about.  Avernum: Escape from the Pit is about exploration and good old-fashioned D&D inspired adventure.  This is old school for sure, but it is very approachable.  The writing is topnotch and the setting is superb. 

The lack of really any sort of a soundtrack does hurt the experience in the long run I think, but I was completely satisfied with listening to the lonely wind howling through the caverns and the forlorn drip from a distant stalactite for hours on end.

I was a little esceptic at first because i'm not a huge fan of turn based games on isometric (i prefer those that are from up to down). Because I played Exile 3 and Blades of Exile i had an idea of what to spect with this saga of games.
So even before playing a lot i can tell you:
The Lore is the best Lore i've ever played on a video game. Masterfully crafted and really inmersive. I never played the first Exile or the second, so this game is completly new to me.

Just a couple of minutes playing this game i can see a lot of new additions to the combat and spell mechanics.
From my experience i can 100% say: You can replay this game many times and never get tired. Once you finished the game, you'll desire to play it again with another aproach and other kind of characters (i write this with my experience of Blades of Exile from behind).

If you love turn based games, this one is a MUST HAVE. I wish this game were more popular because is an absolute jewel.

And i will say this anytime i could: if the developer read this review, please upload Blades of Exile to Steam, it's my favorite turn based game ever.

Nachdem ich Geneforge im Großen und Ganzen einigermaßen passabel fand und mir über Avernum viel Gutes zu Ohren kam, entschied ich mich hier auf Steam die neue Version zu kaufen - auch um einen Vergleich zu dem älteren Design der Geneforge-Titel zu haben.
Nun was soll man sagen, der bereits erwähnte Schiwiergkeitsgrad wurde in der neuen Version wohl abgespeckt. Was ich so gelesen habe, soll man sich in der älteren Version noch mit Hunger und der Option / Notwendigkeit zu Rasten herum geschlagen haben, dieses Feature wurde hier ausgemerzt. Nicht nur das, allem Anschein nach gab es auch in Sachen Levelaufstieg/Skillverteilung einige Neuerungen (die nicht jedem gleichermaßen gefallen haben).
Außerdem habe ich in Beiträgen aufgeschnappt, dass die Gegenstandsauswahl / die Gegnerdrops Änderungen erfahren haben, auch nicht unbedingt zum Besseren / zu mehr Vielfalt hin...
Dies sind Aspekte, die mir unmittelbar ein wenig aufstießen, zumal man in der Spielwelt an die fehlenden Funktionen erinnert wird...direkt in der ersten Stadt gibt es einen Raum, in dem man angeblich bequem und sicher rasten können soll (so der eingeblendete Infotext), dieser Text scheint allerdings ein Relikt aus alten Tagen zu sein, denn eine Rasten-Option ist beim besten Willen nicht zu finden - da nicht vorhanden. Das empfinde ich persönlich als grober Schnitzer, wenn eine Funktion entfernt wird, sollte man auch die Überbleibsel davon aus einem Spiel tilgen, sodass man nicht auf Features hofft, die sich am Ende als entfernt herauskristallisieren...Das war auch der Grund weshalb ich überhaupt anfing nach Unterschieden zu forschen - die mich zugegebenermaßen direkt entmutigten, das Spiel beherzt anzugehen. Am liebsten wäre ich nach der Erkenntnis direkt zur alten Version gewechselt, aber da ich diese nicht besitze und diesen neuen Teil nicht zurückgeben kann, raffte ich mich auf weiterzumachen und zu hoffen, dass es vielleicht doch nicht ganz so dolle stören wird...Das hat es dann auch nur bedingt, da ich den direkten Vergleich ja auch nicht hatte und die alten Features nur vom Hörensagen kenne...
Aber das Spiel als solches entpuppte sich für mich generell als ein sehr sprödes / ödes Abenteuer bei dem ich das Gefühl habe Etappen mühselig abzuarbeiten. Das Gefühl des trockenen Abarbeitens ergibt sich aus der zu Spielen wie Oblivion gegenteiligen Natur der Spielwelt, die sich aus strikten Levelgrenzen und starken Kontrasten der Gegnerstärke zusammensetzt. Und dem Naturell der Items - es gibt eine etappenweise Verbesserung der Gegenstände, wenn du an einem gewissen Punkt / in einem bestimmten Gebiet ankommst, dann wird deine Ausrüstung plötzlich obsolet und die nächsten Waffen / Rüstungen der selben Gattung betreten die Bildfläche, die sich von der alten Ausrüstung zumeist nur durch ein anderes Material auszeichnen, z.B. wechselst du vom Bronze- zum Eisenspeer. Oder von der Ledervariante der Rüstung hin zur Eisenvariante.
Dies ist nahezu die einzige Form der Itemvielfalt, die ich während meiner 20 Stunden Spielzeit zu spüren bekam. Ganz selten findet mal ein magisches Exemplar von Lederstiefeln oder einer Kette, die Werte wie +1 Geschick oder +10% Kälteresistenz spendieren (auf die Seltenheit von magischen Gegenständen wird auch in Dialogen eingegangen). Die Händler haben so gut wie immer 1:1 die selben Waren, und diese sind in den meisten Fällen zwar extremst überteuert, aber dennoch schlechter, als das Equipment, das du bereits hast. Naja ist auch besser so, dass wir das Zeug also nicht unbedingt brauchen, denn das Gold wird man noch dringend für die ebenfalls extremst teuren Zaubersprüche und kaum erschwinglichen Lebenstränke / Energietränke benötigen... Auch hier ist die Auswahl eher bescheiden und auch hier wurde das System im Vergleich zum alten Avernum abgeändert (Alchemie soweit ich weiß abgespeckt).

Wie ihr sehen könnt bin ich über diese Gameplay-Aspekte schon mal so gar nicht begeistert...hier präsentiert sich in anderen Spielen gleich ein viel bemerkenswerterer Item- und Zauberfundus.
Kann das Spiel also wenigstens in anderen Gameplay-Bereichen oder gar in Sachen Story glänzen?
Leider nein. Das Kampfsystem ist ordentlich, aber auch nicht mehr. Ich liebe rundenbasierte Kämpfe, aber bei diesem Kampfsystem kommen keine strategischen Glücksmomente auf, es wirkt sehr einfach gehalten und angestaubt - zweckdienlich, schwerlich mehr als das in meinen Augen.
Dass die Gegner nicht mitleveln und in manchen Regionen so stark sind, dass man sich anfangs niemals dorthin verirren sollte, finde ich grundsätzlich nicht schlecht und etwas was sich einige an Spielen wie (wie oben bereits genannt ) Oblivion oder Skyrim gewünscht hätten...Aber in Kombination mit der mageren Itemauswahl, die man erzwungenermaßen in fest gesetzten Abschnitten für die nächste Variante der selben Sorte austauscht, wirkt das alles sehr rigide und eben so als ob man etwas 'abzuarbeiten' hat. Klar es erfasst einen so manches Erfolgsgefühl wenn man die bösen Oger, die einem anfangs noch in Angst und Schrecken versetzten plötzlich mit neu gewonnener Stärke endlich dem Erdboden gleichmachen kann und so den vollen Umfang seiner Kräftesteigerung realisiert...aber das täuscht nicht über den starren Grundrahmen der Spielewelt und der ihr innewohnenden Mechaniken hinweg.
Auch die freundlichen Charaktere, die sich so in Avernum herumtummeln und mit uns ins Gespräch kommen, wirken leider öde und zum Großteil seelenlos. Sie erzählen ihre eigenen kleinen Geschichten, aber Geschichten, die man im Grunde gar nicht unbedingt hören will, da man ähnliches schon zum tausendsten Mal gehört hat und die Gespräche ohnehin nur in ein und die selbe Richtung verlaufen können. Entweder du nimmst einen Auftrag an und führst ihn dann genau wie vorgeschrieben durch, oder eben nicht. Es gibt keine unterschiedlichen Lösungswege für Quests und keine Gesinnungsfragen. Wenn du deinen Charakter durch individuelle Entscheidungen im Umgang mit Mensch und Monster formen willst, dann bist du bei diesem Spiel ganz schlecht beraten. In der Hinsicht war Geneforge etwas besser. Geneforge hätte ich im Vergleich zu Avernum wohl auch gerade noch so einen Daumen nach oben gegeben, dort fand ich die Story auch ein wenig mitreißender, und man hatte etwas mehr Varianz in der Handhabung von Quests...Bei Avernum kann ich mich leider wirklich nicht dazu durchringen...genauso wenig wie ich mich dazu durchringen kann es zu Ende zu spielen...geschweige denn die nachfolgenden Teile anzugehen...

The graphics are basic, the sound design questionable, and the music non-existent. But with a bit of imagination, and guided by the high quality of writing, Avernum is a truly interesting and unique setting that's ripe for exploration.

Exploring the world can feel difficult, at times, due to the levelled world forcing you to poke around until you find somewhere level-appropriate. But once you do, the world's packed with random encounters, towns, dungeons, and so on, so that you'll always be rewarded for exploration.

Getting new loot isn't represented graphically at all, so the impact can often feel small. But the magical items in the game are well-designed to reward the player for obtaining them, be it powerful weapons, or items that let you open up new paths in the overworld and in dungeons. 

There's few real opportunities for you to roleplay your characters, and no companion system beyond your starting party. But the characters you meet are well-written, and at times, provide some great comic relief.

Avernum: Escape from the Pit is a modern remake of Avernum 1 which was itself a remake of Exile. It is an old-school, turned based dungeon crawler with up to a party of 4. I played with a party of Main Tank, Dual Wielder (DPS/off-tank), Priest (primary healer/buffer), Mage (caster with a side in Priest for alternate mass healing)

Pros:
A massive open world to explore.
Quite lengthy.
Very interesting game setting and story imo.
Pretty decent writing for describing NPCs and areas.
Can be quite challenging, with plenty of difficulty battles.

Cons:
Graphics are very dated.
Can be a pain to get started in the early game. While the world is massive, enemies stronger than you are basically can't dodge most of your attacks, do lots of damage to you, get first move and resist most of your damage that you actually manage to land (enemies have quite heavy resist in the game I found) so a lot of the early part of my game was stumbling around trying to figure out where to heck to go at my level. Acid and Lightning damage absolutely wrecks you early game.
There's no way to see enemy stats so you're kind of blind when attacking stuff as you have no idea what type of stats it has or even what level it is; this winds up with quicksaving, getting wrecked, quick loading a lot.
Quests are very simplistic, with no real moral choices. This is a dungeon crawler but would have been nice to have some more meaningful decisions.
Combat can get a little repetitive I guess.
Bit of a nitpick but pathfinding can be a little annoying. It can be difficult to move to certain squares due to the player sprites and characters can swap places with each other but only if you do this yourself so if they don't have a clear path to attack something or move to a place they'll try to take the long route (and potentially run into other enemies doing so).

Dungeons balance tends to be a tad random at times. Some have areas of increasing difficulty, while dungeon bosses can be far more difficulty than other content. Often you'll find yourself having to clear out parts of the dungeon that you can then go looking for other content to gain level before you can tackle the rest. Basically expect to do lots of quicksaving + loading as you explore and do dungeons.

Avernum: EftP je první díl trilogie výborných izometrický indie RPG her od vývojáře Jeffa Vogela. Vlastně se jedná už o druhý remake. Struktura her z tohoto universa je docela matoucí a rozebírat to by bylo na dlouho, takže jenom odkážu na [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avernum]wikipedii.[/url]

Když jsem spouštěl Avernum poprvé, ani ve snu by mě nenapadlo, jak moc mě tato jednoduše vypadající hra pohltí a že v ní strávím 65 hodin čistého herního času. Avernum je totiž masivní podzemní jeskyně, kam Impérium, které vládne vnějšímu světu, umisťuje nepohodlné občany - kriminálníky, politické oponenty nebo příslušníky nelidských ras.

Hráč si na začátku vytvoří partu čtyř dobrodruhů. K dispozici je několik předdefinovaných povolání, ale ta za moc nestojí. Lepší je vytvořit pro každého člena družiny nové povolání, což se děje jednoduchým alokováním atributů a skillů. Díky tomu lze sestavit pestré portfolio vlastností tak, aby naše squadra byla konkurenceschopná především vojensky, protože Avernum je RPG zaměřené primárně na boj. Zároveň ale nabízí několik desítek questů a poměrně zajímavý příběh, který má tři různá zakončení. Ta se navzájem nevylučují, takže je možné splnit je všechny. 

V jednoduchosti je síla a Avernum je toho krásným příkladem. Hra možná vypadá prostě, až primitivně, ale právě díky tomu je oproštěna od spousty otravných mechanismů moderních RPG a nabízí neskutečně chytlavý gameplay. Jakmile k Avernu člověk usedne, je těžké se od něj odtrhnout. ;-) Pokud se nenecháte odradit old-school vizuálem, budete bohatě odměněni. Avernum je totiž opravdu prvotřídní RPG.",1618883946,1618973273,True,5,0,0.59815603494644165,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Now, that's an ugly game. Honestly when I started it, I was thinking ""here comes a game I'll spend 30+ hours on through the sheer power of Stockholm syndrome, and then will leave a negative review on Steam so that people don't repeat my mistake"". Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Not by its appearance - it stays that awful all along - but by the overall role-playing game experience.

✔️ Nice tactical combat, with some area effects, movement abilities, and impairing statuses.
✔️ Interesting class-less character building system. It remains pretty optimal to specialize yourself, but the choices are pretty rich, and cross-specialization is [i]possible[/i] though less efficient.
✔️ A pretty huge dungeon-like structure to explore freely, with a lot of content to interact with, hidden passages, and different ways to move around.

💭 The game's indications of enemy power level are very implicit, which can benefit the immersion, but also creates some frustrating ""die & retry"" situations.

❌ [b]This game is deeply, terribly, and mind-bogglingly ugly.[/b] This is my main grudge with it. The issue is not even that much about how ugly each individual element is - some graphic elements are ok, others less so - but more about the cohesion of the whole. It looks like different images used in the game have been ordered from various artists, without any effort to make all of them follow a common direction.
❌ This game doesn't have a displayable world map. Or if it does, I haven't found one in 80 hours of play. Seriously, having an accessible overview of the discovered world area would have helped me so many times, this is crazy.
❌ It is sometimes tedious to click on the ground because an enemy prevents you from clicking behind them. The game would probably be a bit more enjoyable if you could only interact with squares, not the enemies on them. The amount of time I spent trying to position an area effect correctly because of that must be crazy.
❌ A lot of elements would benefit from being a bit more explicit, specifically the detail of the character's current damage, resistances, critical chance, etc.
❌ The game has quite a few minor user experience issues I won't detail here.

Overall, despite the heavy negative section, I would recommend this game, since it offers an actually interesting dungeon-exploring experience if you are able to look over its terrible graphics.",1618345107,1673666085,True,4,0,0.535664260387420654,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As for the game itself, I will spare you the usual comments such as tired interface, graphics etc... In all honesty, the game is a labour of love. There is so much lore in the game, this little world is very believable. You don't have to spend 2 hours crossing the map, yet there is so much to do, you won't feel bored. I have a feeling that this is an 80-100 hours game in terms of content. One last thing, the ambient sound effects are really great.

My only gripe with this game is that it is difficult to gauge whether you are within shooting/casting distance, resulting in your squishies (mage, priest, archer) running up to the enemy instead of staying safely behind.

*Edit*

I put my money where my mouth is and reached 100 hours in the game (started a second playthrough but decided it was time to move on to another SpiderwebSoftware game). The game was surprisingly rich on a second run for something that has so much first-time appeal. I will be leaving Avernum: Escape from the Pit behind; shielding my eyes from the sun as I emerge from the cave of my bedroom in tandem with my party emerging from the caves under the empire's continent-scale oppression.

It has some issues -- there's either too much combat or what's there isn't engaging enough -- but ultimately I love the game's subterranean setting.

That the game is expressly non-linear makes exploring the ""underworld"" an absolute delight. In true old-school form there's a lot of freedom in deciding which dungeons to tackle in which order, and Avernum is full of hidden encounters and secret dungeons concealed at the back of hidden tunnels. The game even has three distinct endings, with three distinct sets of partially overlapping requirements, and three distinct final dungeons; what the game lacks in encounter design and cutscenes it makes up for in the expressiveness of the world it challenges you to master.",1600058372,1600058372,True,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Old school gamers who love the Baldur’s Gate games should find themselves enjoying Avernum: Escape from the Pit, although, admittedly, the former series has a bit more style than the Avernum games, Avernum makes up for it with a rich world and excellent storytelling.  Modern gamers who enjoy openworld RPGs like Skyrim and The Witcher should be able to enjoy the openworld aspect of this precursor game.

The Good:  You will get your money’s worth even at full price.  The amount of world building and writing in this game is akin to a good novel.  You will get sucked up into the story, and you will be sad when it finally comes to the end.  It’s also nice to have a game from an era where you weren’t expected to buy add ons.  You get a full, massive experience from just the base game.

The Bad:  The controls are clunky.  The pathing is often atrocious.  The graphics often negate the effects of the written storytelling.  (For instance, you might be given a few paragraphs on the awesome presence of a dragon only to be greeted by an image of a dragon that looks small next to your party.

In the end, your enjoyment of this game will likely be based on how much your imagination can replace the images on your screen.  For me, this wasn’t a problem, as I grew up on games like this.  I bought this game on sale, but if I had bought it at full price, I would have been more than satisfied.  Two big thumbs up.

The combat is turn based and the options available to you will seem overwhelming at first but once you develop a sense for timing and tactics it is very satisfying.

However, I find there are 2 main cons. 
1: The difficulty curve slaps you in the face after a certain point, which can be frustrating. Though there is a sense of genuine triumph in beating enemies by taking the smart approach or fighting dirty by kiting targets into corners. 
Con #2 is that quests require your full attention. There's no way points and if you don't remember who an NPC is or exactly where to find an item; then you will be wandering around for a while. Also, if you are a child of the internet such as myself, you can't reading comprehension is trash, which can result in repeatedly walking between the same 3 NPCs who all tell you to talk to the others when it's what they aren't saying that is important.

Honestly the most genuine fun I've had with a game in years.

[u][b]Ремейк ремейка[/b][/u]
Игра, известная в 1995 как [b]Exile: Escape from the Pit[/b] из серии [b]Exile[/b]¹, была возрождена создателем всех этих игр [b]Джефом Вогелем[/b] в 2000 году под названием [b]Avernum[/b], став первой игрой в одноименной серии² из двух трилогий, а в 2011 ремейк игры - [b]Avernum: Escape from the Pit[/b] - появился в Steam, положив начало серии [url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5854/Avernum_Trilogy_Bundle/]ремейков первой трилогии[/url].
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2151494373 Движок оригинальной трилогии оказался куда более [url=https://youtu.be/8U-fmGL9XBM]архаичным[/url], чем мне казалось, так что ремейк этих игр пришелся как нельзя кстати, до кучи дав Вогелю возможность эффективно преподнести эту серию в стиме. При сравнении становится ясно, что текущий движок игры аналогичен (помимо небольшой эволюции скорости & визуальной части) движку [url=https://store.steampowered.com/sub/14583/]второй трилогии[/url], которая не нуждается в переработке и посему тоже присутствует в стиме.

По поводу самой игры не скажу ничего нового. Это огромная изометрическая RPG, полная всяких интересностей для любителей знакомств с фентези-мирами, а в особенности для тех, кто, как и я, до этого прошел сразу вторую трилогию³.

Хочется обратить внимание на [url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/avernum-escape-from-the-pit/credits]приложивших к [b]A:EftP[/b] руку иллюстраторов[/url]. Красочные и детализированные рисунки для игры изобразил питерский художник [url=https://www.artstation.com/deruch]Александр Дерученко.[/url] Игровые навыки еще в 2000 году для первой части Avernum проиллюстрировал [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foglio]Phil Foglio[/url], известный как художник [url=https://www.mtgpics.com/illus?art=45&reprints=1]ряда карт для Magic: The Gathering[/url] и авторских комиксов, работающий вместе со своей женой на [url=http://www.studiofoglio.com]собственной студии.[/url] Он же нарисовал и прочие изображения, которые в данном ремейке были переработаны Александром.

Знакомые персонажи - не скажу, узнал лишь Келнера (руководитель Башни Магов из второй трилогии, в указанный момент лишь ученик), остальных лишь по упоминаниям.

Il y a juste le minimum syndical, niveau interface, et dans les mouvements du groupe/ennemis. 
Certes le tour par tour  peut paraître répétitif et lassant pour ceux que ça rebutent déjà, 
Le scénario tientsur un timbre poste : s'échapper d'une ""prison"" souterraine immense. 
Mais, et c'est là que le jeu prend sa saveur, le lore profond qui respire partout dans cette immense map où il ne fait pas bon de rusher n'importe où. Map  Immense, avec cavernes, villages, points d'intérêts, chateaux, souterrains de souterrains, ruines, etc... Certes les graphismes sont d'un autre âge (très ancien), mais le charme agit. On parcours la map à la recherche d'une issue.  de prisonniers, mais pas que , on parcours la map pour abattre monstres, bandits, chercher des pelles, des pioches, résoudre une énigme. 
Niveau magie pure, sorts de prêtres, capacités de guerrier, il faut les ""acheter"" à des entraineur/maitres. les potions sont faites par des alchimistes. On peut apprendre de livres, encore faut il pouvoir les lire. On avance pas vite en compétences, et en apprentissage des sorts/capacités. Mais ça donne du coup l'envie d'explorer et trouver de quoi se les payer. 
La zone de départ est assez grande bien qu'on puisse aller partout. Mais on est très vite confronter à des groupes d'ennemis qui OS et qui nous amène à progresser prudemment sur la map. 
Que dire ? Il ressemble à un Baldur dans son idée et le lore poussé, matiné de minimalisme (interface minimaliste et rectitude de l'architecture globale du jeu) et d'idées sympas (téléporteurs ne peuvent pas être activés comme ça, humour et ambiance générale, personnages non joueur chacun avec une mini histoire, lockpicking pas évident au départ).
Côté monstres, ya de la diversité, même si ça se voit pas des masses ""visuellement"" dans le minimalisme du jeu côté graphisqmes.
Côté combat : tour par tour classique, assez exigeant souvent. On est quasi à poil dès le début et pour un moment.
Niveau bruitages, sons : ça va, je m'attendais à pire, quoi que répétitifs parfois =)
Un jeu que je recommande à ceux qui ne regardent pas les graphismes, qui aiment le tour par tour, le challenge, le lore profond et immersif dans un jeu, et les immenses maps où ya plein de trucs à découvrir =).

Old school, but not unpleasant combat. D&D lite.
Not too punishing, save almost any time.
Some art by legendary artist Phil Foglio!

The first game is a solid entry to the series. It introduces many of the core figures in the plot, the world of Avernum, and the concepts that will be used and referred to throughout the series. It's not strictly necessary to start here, as the games of the trilogy are fully independent from each other and feature different (though always unnamed) protagonists, but it's a solid game in its own right and a good way to whet your appetite before the much more involved and elaborate Avernum 2: Crystal Souls.",1586201773,1586201773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As of 2020-03-04, with an Nvidia card (GTX 1070) with driver 436.30, I'm experiencing flickering tiles when some ambient animations happen, which is a subtle but very annoying effect. I personally find it ruins the experience.
Others have reported the same: https://steamcommunity.com/app/208400/discussions/0/1741103267276883997/
The workaround I found was to download and install the copy I own from Humble Bundle, and use ""Avernum DirectX.exe"" to play. If you copy that executable somewhere else such as the Steam install location, you also need to copy AvernumSettings.dat to C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Spiderweb Software\Avernum Saved Games, or the game will complain about being a demo version. Launching the game through ""Avernum DirectX.exe"" gets rid of the flickering.

I hear, but haven't tried myself, that you can get the same DirectX executable if you download the demo of the game from http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/avernum/avernum/index.html, but I don't know if that'll let you play through the whole game because of the registration issue.

Because of this bug, I can't recommend that people buy the game on Steam.

== Actual Review ==

This is the remake of Avernum 1, which itself is a remake of Exile 1 (the latter now being free).

Bland but somewhat charming isometric graphics, annoying UI (despite both being improved compared to the first game), expansive world you can explore without handholding, well-designed dungeons, half fun/half frustrating tactical combat with your party of four, and a story that is weaved without forcing it in your face. You need to love reading, but the writing is good. RPG progression is standard old-school stuff and loot is decent. Spells are probably the best part of combat.

Combat initially seems to control smoothly, you can easily swap between melee and ranged weapons and just click the enemy to attack. However, [b]major problems[/b] surface when you're battling in more complex environments with corridors and the like:
- Characters automatically move to attack, including to get in ranged for a bow attack. This sometimes leads them to take unexpected and suicidal moves right in the middle of a pack of enemies.
- It's nearly impossible to click the tile right above one of your characters, to move diagonally there. (You can move with the keypad if you have one to work around this.)
- Combats can be long and there is no save during combat, which compounds these issues.
- All in all this will make you yearn for the antiquated but precise keyboard controls of the game this is supposed to ""remake"".

Others things that were added compared to the original Avernum 1 are an overworld map with quest markers, a fast travel system from specific locations, and a quest log.
- The quest log is welcome, because in the first game you basically had to make notes on paper to avoid forgetting stuff.
- Quest markers are pretty useful when they show in the local minimap in explored area.
- The World Map and quest markers there however make the world much less intimidating and impressive to explore. Erika's Tower for instance is a mythical location that the first game only told you is ""Far to the West"". Finally finding it after an arduous journey felt amazing. Here though, you just see it on the map right off the bat, as soon as a character mentions its existence... Same for finding the Tower of Magi the first time - without a map to eyeball the distance, the journey through ogre-infested territory was terrifying, now it's nothing special.
- I'm of two minds about the fast-travel system. It does cut on backtracking which is welcome,  and at least it's not Skyrim-style where you can just jump to any previous location from anywhere, but also contributes to making the world smaller and less dangerous. It also feels quite a bit too high-tech for Avernum and IMO clashes with the lore in multiple ways.

The dialogues seem to match what I read in Avernum 1, so if you're exceptionally strong-willed, it might be possible to increase your immersion by never looking at the world map ('W' key) and quest markers and following the sometimes vague directions you receive instead. I don't know however if all directions have been kept, and if in any new quest Jeff bothered giving directions since ""we have markers now"" (bleh).

Secrets that you found by walking into a fake wall have been removed as well, replaced with buttons on walls in towns and dungeons, and presumably other things when traveling the map. I think I slightly preferred the original design, which usually made you guess there was a secret by the context, the shape of the room, some in front of the secret door that seemed out of place, and so forth.

With all those modern concessions ruining the old-school feel quite a bit (and what is the appeal of Spiderweb Games if not being old-school?), you might want to try playing Avernum 1 instead (with your screen on a very low resolution like 800x600). If you can stomach the old keyboard controls, and graphics it might just end up being a better adventure.

На нормальном уровне сложности никаких проблем нет: контактному бойцу даём два меча в зубы и всё вкладываем в силу, стрелку лучший лук и всё вкладываем в ловкость, магу и клирику всё равно что давать и всё вливаем в их интеллект. Предлагаемую по умолчанию партию лучше удалить и выбрать персонажей без классов. Одному персонажу следует развить взлом замков до максимума (я выбрал для этой цели лучника), а так вкладывать исключительно в соответствующую ветку развития. 

Покупать оружие и одёжку в магазинах смысла нет. В процессе исследования пещер всё это и так найдёте. Деньги лучше потратить на тренеров, а они стоят дорого. Первая цель — это купить cave lore, а это 7200 местных буказоидов на всю партию. Далее по ситуации. Заклинания тоже придётся покупать.

Если хочется себе усложнить жизнь, то это можно сделать легко: повысить уровень сложности и уменьшить число людей в партии. Пройти соло вряд ли получится, но всякое бывает…

I used to play a game called Realmz on Mac back in the days and I loved it dearly. Avernum makes me return to those days, and that's a good thing.

Obviously by looking at the pictures of the game here on Steam you can tell that the graphics ain't exactly Baldurs Gate, Divinity or Pillars of Eternity but do not let that fool you. What it lacks in graphics (you do not notice after a while) it owns up to in depth and adventure. Avernum mimics the old school computer RPG adventures and it does it very well.

Avernum is a massive game with the posibility to speak to many different persons and a extremely lore rich enviroment.

I recommend this game to anyone interested in a good ol' fantasty RPG like back in the days.

Pros:
-Large open world map
-Customizable character classes
-Unique theme
Cons:
-No real Choice, when you try to be peaceful for example, the npc just says ""Die"" and that's the end of that.
-You cannot explore the large open world map openly because the areas have a ""level requirement"" which requires you to mostly explore the entire ""Starting area"" and so on
-The combat system is horrible. It is literally the same abilities over and over. The only break from the monotony is some creatures are immune to certain damage, which then leaves your fighter to kill that and then you still use the same abilities

Avernum: Escape from the Pit is an odd one, in that some of its features I think are outstanding, and some I think are really suboptimal. It has a great premise, and interesting storyline, good depth to it, and a lovely feeling of exploration attached to it. The first downside for me is difficulty spike in different locations. The game makes it clear that some areas are too high a level for the party, in that you get one shot before you can do anything. However, it makes no effort to tell you where you should be going instead. The lack of handholding may be appreciated by some, but for me it’s bad game design. If you are meant to travel to different areas, get killed, reload and go somewhere else to see if that works, that to me is not a fun time. You also need to get every bit of possible xp along the way early on or you will be comprehensively overpowered by the enemies. This is especially the case on hard or torment difficulties. I’m normally able to play games on high difficulties, but not this one. Overall, some poor decisions mar my enjoyment of the game, but still has some real high points, particularly once you’ve made it through the early levels.",1576146469,1576146469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

最重要的重点：
一定要记笔记，一定要记笔记，一定要记笔记。
玩游戏的时候创建个txt文档，把暂时解决不掉的问题记录下来，游戏过程就变得很清晰明了。
因为游戏实在是太大了，城镇很多，随着玩家剧情的推进，人物越来也多，事件越来越复杂。
如果不记录，很会难受。   大地图上，地牢里有很多隐藏地点和线索，也需要先记下来，不然就忘了。
后面遇到NPC或者重要剧情提到这个地点，或者这个事情，有记录的话，一目了然。
游戏里 有些魔法门前期开不了，地牢又多，自己做个简单的记录，后期再回来开，会很方便，不然会遗漏了。
总而言之，是个非常好的游戏，玩起来很顺畅。




玩了85个小时我准备停下了，说一下看法。  在玩avernum之前，我先通关了该公司的avadon系列三部曲。 avadon很有值得称赞的地方，但不得不说，从各个方面，avernum都比avadon 更加便捷，优秀，玩着也更有意思一些。 
但是， 为什么我通过了 avadon 三部曲，  对于 海内外评价这么高的avernum 这个游戏我 却停下来了呢。
原因很简单，  因为这个游戏实在是 太长了， 其剧情的长度有点类似于 老滚5 ，巫师3.  
但不同于前两者， 前两者的剧情虽然长，但是相辅相成，主线剧情是一路连接着走下来的。
这个游戏 的优点在于 世界大， 城镇多， NPC超级多， 对话超级多，任务超级多 。 但是缺点也在于此。
缺点就在于 城镇实在是 他妈的太多了， 每到一个城镇都会有很多 带有名字的NPC 对话或者给任务。 但是缺点就在这里，
不同城镇的人物和故事之间关联性不强， 这就导致任务 极其的分散，我现在任务面板里 将近三十个任务就让我十分头疼。
缺点就是 城镇太多，关联性不强，导致玩起来特别的累，  特别的疲惫，不停的遇到到新地方，遇到新人，不停的对话，不停地阅读。  这样的过程一直不断不断重复，并且是毫无意义的重复，因为剧情并无关联。  和阅读小说不一样，小说出场的人物都是有原因，有关联的，看着不会无趣，  其他大部分游戏也是如此。   这个游戏最大的缺点就是无数城镇，无数NPC， 废镇太多，废话太多。--------  这次玩的时候， 建立了一个文档，这些问题立马就解决了。

It takes quite a bit of time before you get invested in the world.

Quests always give you a sense of progress (and there's a ton of them), there are multiple choices in parts but they don't make you feel overwhelmed or that you've ruined your game by making the wrong one, characters feel unique and have actual personalities, you don't need to grind constantly to upgrade your characters, the game world is quite large and exploring it is fun, it has an old-school feel but a nice narrative, and in this version the graphics and sound (while not the greatest) are acceptably good.

Truthfully, there's not much bad to say about the game at all... except... the mouse control/selection and the characters' pathfinding.

The battles are more similar to Final Fantasy Tactics with a large grid for play and the ability to move your characters around it to maximize their attack damage or reduce their vulnerabilities.

Avernum rewards you with a plethora of unique items to create the best equipped party for each discipline of play (mage, cleric, melee, ranged). It also rewards you for creating balanced parties with skill checks that require Tool Use, Cave Lore, Luck and others being aggregated across all of your parties characters.

The story line is pretty weak but it is still engrossing because of its allegorical references to colonial abuse which inspire a sense of rebelliousness.

This game makes no apologies for its dated look, and somewhat dated functionality. You might need to change your desktop resolution to something lower in order to play it enjoyably, but it does deliver where it counts.

It takes place in an immense open world and doesn't hold your hand. Find some quests to start you off on your journey and realize you may wander into some areas that will absolutely kick your butt. You really get to feel your characters develop and grow stronger. Eventually you will beat that enemy (or more likely group of enemies) that simply destroyed you earlier in the game. 

There are decisions to be made when it comes to quests. Everybody in this world is trying to scrape by and survive, some with more ambition than others, and they will all try to use you to further their own agendas. You can try playing both sides for a while to take advantage of the offerings available, but eventually you must decide who best represents your values and goals.

I find the hardest choices to make come when you are building and advancing your characters. So many options with precious few points to allocate. It makes it tough to decide, but at least the results are satisfying.

Magic will play a part both for you and against you. Getting in a fight with multiple magic users will be challenging. Battle position and strategy are crucial. Some fights against lower enemies you can run in swords swinging, but there are key battles that will require more prep and patience. It's well done in that respect.

There is some reading, but just enough to set the atmosphere. Not long winded at all. For the most part the game is based around exploring the world, completing quests and discovering secrets (items, locations).

If you’re [confused by the various listings of Avernum on Steam and GOG], don't worry; it only gets worse the further you unravel this spinster’s tale. Hopefully this information will make sense as to why there are two listings of Avernum as well as why some titles have subtitles while others do not. 

Way back in 1995, there was the first Spiderweb game made in the vein of the first three Ultima titles, named Exile: The Escape from the Pit. As you might expect from a game developed at this time, it didn’t take long for advances in computer technology to make the game inoperable on modern devices. What Jeff Vogel decided to do was to “rewrite” the first trilogy of Exile into the first trilogy of Avernum, which used the Nethergate (not the Nethergate: Resurrection) engine. Ten years later, and after completing the second trilogy of Avernum as well as the Geneforge series, Jeff Vogel returned again to rewrite Avernum with all the improvements brought with Avernum 6. This version was dubbed Avernum: Escape from the Pit. The other two games in this first trilogy have also been remade, and they are designated with Exile subtitles; the second trilogy, however, remains in its original form. 

If that history lesson was too confusing to follow, and I wouldn’t blame you, then all you need to know is if there is a subtitle attached that means you are playing the latest version with all the modern quality of life improvements. So how exactly does Avernum hold up after sixteen years? About as well as might expect.

If I had to describe Avernum, the world and the gameplay, in one sentence, it would be an Elder Scrolls version of Fallout with the world-building that you would expect from Obsidian. Now that description may be giving the game too little or too much credit depending on what you think about the gameplay as well as the quality of its writing. It does, however, capture this series’ sense of adventure combined with the sheer scale and quality of its world, and it’s the epicness of a six-game journey from the depths of Avernum to the topside world that will enrapture those who dare to try their patience for such a lengthy quest. 

One common problem with Spiderweb games, although perhaps more so in Avernum, is how stretched out these games are with respect to their mechanics. As an avid fan of turn-based tactics games from the terrors of the deep of XCOM to the pillars of excellence set by Pillars of Eternity, I would like to say there is as much depth to Avernum as the character creation system wants you to believe. While there is a decent variety of ten classes—and the following entries would let you play as humans; the feline race, Nephilim; and the lizard-men race, the Sliths—the combat mechanics aren’t as captivating when you realize all classes boil down to fighters, mages and priests with all the rest serving as hybrids. For one game, this system would be acceptable; however, when you consider these systems for six entries, you will understand the sentiment that these mechanics overstay their welcome. Avernum isn’t the only series that suffers from its own journey as Baldur’s Gate shares this same plight, even before Siege of Dragonspear added another twenty-five hours to the journey, and that game uses AD&D rules. To Avernum’s credit, this problem isn’t about quality versus quantity as these games make their quests as much as their world worth the long, long road ahead into what could easily take you hundreds of hours to see the end.

So what is about Avernum’s world that makes it so compelling? The first two entries take place within the confines of Avernum, a prison for the Empire to cast aside its outcasts, its criminals, its insurrectionists and all its unwanted folks into a realm meant to be their end. Instead of dying off, the people formerly of the Empire, as well as the other races sent into Avernum, have learned to thrive off their new environments. Sunlight is replaced with bio-luminescent mushrooms and other magical substitutes; cattle and other livestock have been conditioned to eat mushrooms, which has resulted in their milk turning green; and the exiled mages from the Tower of the Magi continue to experiment with new ways to adapt to the environment. It is all these many examples of great attention to detail as well as subversions throughout the game such as coming across a friendly neighborhood of spiders makes Avernum a believable world. 

In addition, Avernum, from the very first game, manages to do what most RPGs or fantasy worlds fail to accomplish in creating an underdog narrative. (These games also do not suffer from telling incomplete stories as every game is treated as a self-contained work.) Above all the lore and the engaging quests, it’s perhaps the length of that journey—although most of these games can be completed within twenty to thirty-five hours—and the sense of scale from all the side-content that does a lot more to sell the idea of this story. In many ways, Avernum shares a lot in common with Tolkien’s novels where the first hundred pages of The Lord of the Rings was about the Shire, the main characters and building up the suspense of the outer world. 

Out of these three goals, Avernum misses the mark on the latter category as most of the writing is expository with no real personality behind the player’s words. Many great RPGs, even ones with blank slates, also suffer from this problem, but your dialogue decisions in Avernum feel devoid of any flavor. This sentiment doesn’t extend to all written characters as they have enough characterization to make them serve the purpose of telling you a story. You also have to accept the many instances of the “Show, Don’t Tell” problem, especially when the narrator will emphasize things that should rather be left for the player to discover from conversations. However, you cannot blame Jeff Vogel for these moments because it would be a far worse problem if these details were not made clear to the player without having played previous titles, or if the sequels had to make their tutorials more intrusive. Like many aspects in life, concessions have to be made and this compromise, while not the best solution, is one where it makes the most sense. 

So after the first two games, Avernum 3 takes places at a time when the Avernites have found a way to return to the surface, and the first trilogy can end with the Empire and the Avernites reaching a mutual agreement. Normally I would have put a spoiler warning, but simply stating that information is kind of like saying Star Wars ends with the Empire in defeat (the original trilogy, not the new schlock.) You simply don’t have the context nor the experience behind that revelation to appreciate the extent of that journey. Another reason, besides making the transition to the next trilogy easier to talk about, is that Avernum always lets you have multiple endings with only one being canonical, and the introductions for subsequent games will always spoil the previous games for you. (There is also no save-transfer feature, which gives credence to the idea that the characters you play in every game are not the same adventurers.) The point of highlighting this plot point is if you want to end the journey here, then you can certainly make that decision and you will still find closure, especially if the state of the second-half of that adventure dissuades you from continuing onwards.

[i]tl;dr at the end[/i]

Avernum: Escape From the Pit is probably my favorite gaming surprise of the year. I did not expect to become so engrossed in its world.

Graphically, Avernum has nothing to boast about. IMO, the graphics are pretty bland. However, they are serviceable and I eventually got used to it. 

Gameplay wise, Avernum is pretty good even though it doesn't feel modern - and the UI doesn't help either in that regard. Combat has its quirks, but is satisfying.

Dialogues is where Avernum shines. Almost everything you learn from Avernum, its story, inhabitants, and struggles is through text. Not necessarily from NPCs, but also from the paragraphs that pop up when needed - and as the graphics don't convey much, they appear often.
Every dialogue, every piece of description, every fragment of lore immerse you into Avernum's world.

Soon, I found myself playing it all the time. I have around 80hrs in the game, and I can say it's a blast seeing your party transition from cave-noobs to beloved adventurers among the underground. And I'm overjoyed to know I'm not close to finishing the game!

Recommended to every CRPG fan!

I remember taking the step from Baldur's Gate (which was admittedly linear in an open way) to something like Morrowind, where the player's only limitation in the world is their temporary weakness. Avernum provides the best of both worlds, where you are thrust into a world and allowed to plunge into its depths at your own risk, all while retaining the moral ambiguity of handling quests and events as either a paragon of righteousness or a self-serving scoundrel -- and everything in between. Or not at all. You're allowed to walk away from quests and roam freely.

I only want to give passive mention to the graphics and production values because, yes, they are noticeably inferior to most other games on the market, but after about fifteen minutes of gameplay it's the last thing on your mind. The game plays like a novel, where you see X wall with Y door and are given a detailed description of the location, and once you get into the game your imagination runs wild.

But you HAVE to enjoy reading in games, because almost everything warrants paragraph upon paragraph of description. However, even though I'm not a fan of walls of text, in Spiderweb's games such a mechanic doesn't bother me at all.

Overall I highly recommend this game. It truly is greater than the sum of its parts, and is far more immersive and enjoyable than the majority of AAA titles overcrowding the market. You can throw hundreds of millions of dollars at a game and still not achieve the immersion and interest that fills each crevice in Avernum.",1552531802,1552533832,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When you look at indie RPG you often expect them to be too complicated for their own good, too verbose, too complex. And often this complexity doesn't bring anything to the table. Avernum is still relatively complex: you control a party of 4 characters (unless you want a challenge and go with fewer characters), each has main stats, skills, perks, a lot of inventory slots. Your party travels the underground land of Avernum doing tasks, getting famous, encountering several end-game quest lines. The world is truly open in a good way, sometimes you're limited by your fame, knowledge of spells, skills like lockpicking, specific quests - but for the most part, you can easily get somewhere where you will be obliterated. In this regard the game is similar to classic RPGs like Might & Magic or Wizardry - it's all about exploration and combat. Unlike modern RPGs Avernum has some great dungeons that are not just battle arenas, they often include secret passages and different approaches to encounters.

The story is relatively simple but well presented. You rarely do any serious decisions through dialogue and your stats only affect combat and exploration. It's all user-friendly and the game doesn't want you to trap yourself with bad decisions. E.g. exploration skills are counted for the whole party: it doesn't matter if you have one guy with lockpicking 4 or 4 people with a single skillpoint in lockpicking. Hybrid classes (e.g. archer and fighter) do not work that well but are still viable on Normal.

Spiderweb games are unique in that they don't feel like indie. They don't try to be nostalgic, or old-school, or very unique. They feel like a normal RPG with outdated graphics and no voice acting or anything. But they also lack a lot of boring stuff you're used to in modern games.

My brother and I found a demo copy of the original by chance and succedeed with a few tries to make it work on a modern pc. What we found was a very old-style rpg with mechanics smooth as sandpaper but with lots of complexity and charm. I was hooked instantly.
Despite the carpal-tunnel inducing controls and the primitive (but charming) graphics it had lots of positives:
the combat was pure tactical bliss, the leveling/equipment system was complex with recipes hidden through the world, the puzzles were intriguing and often required taking notes, and the story and setting were (and still are) pretty set apart compared to most fantasy games.

BUT that was Exile.... not Avernum.
Avernum is the third remake of ""Exile: Escape from the Pit"" from 1995. If you can find a copy of the original game you will likely find it nearly unplayable but, disregarding nostalgia, it was a pretty innovative game for the old-school tactical rpg genre. 

Avernum has only the plot and setting left from the original game.
The graphics have been slightly improved, and thankfully so have been the controls, but sadly Jeff Vogel decided that the leveling and combat/magic system was not worth the time so it was cut and simplified to the point it leaves some holes in some items and quests.

It feels like a weird hybrid made to make some bucks with low effort: 
it's not not old-school anymore but it's not really modern.
It still plays and looks like an old game but has nothing left that an old-school junkie can find enjoyable.

At this price you can find more entertaining and more deserving projects.",1549407058,1549407058,False,3,0,0.483161330223083496,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Играть в эту серию игр начал еще с попавшейся на диске с shareware играми Exile 1, которую до сих пор вспоминаю с удовольствием. Потом был ремейк Avernum 1, который я также проходил, но многие аспекты мне там не нравились (очень решали магии 3го уровня, которые раскидали по всем подземельям и квестам в единственном экземпляре). И наконец, выпущена новый ремейк под аналогичным именем: Avernum: Escape from the Pit (также назывался и первый Exile). 
По сравнению с Exile, игра намного сложнее с точки зрения боев, менее свободная в плане магии, но, безусловно, намного удобнее в плане играбельности. В этом ремейке Jeff немного отошел от так не понравившейся мне концепции магий 3го уровня: здесь они полезны (некоторые - очень полезны, некоторые вообще не улучшаются), но не так принципиально важны. В каждом подземелье есть сложный босс, а иногда и несколько, каждый из которых чаще всего имеет при себе уникальный предмет обмундирования.

Рекомендую эту игру всем любителям жанра RPG, кому важна в первую очередь глубина сюжета, а не графика, кто готов читать тонны текста на английском языке (без этого никак). Сюжет и квесты (за исключением нескольких) прямолинейны и не представляют никакой свободы выбора, хотя в последнее время мне такой вариант нравится больше. Можно спокойно играть без подсказок, не боясь, что в другом месте за того или иного монстра или предмет заплатят больше.

Unsurprisingly, Spiderweb Software wasn't a name I was familiar with, but I gather they've had a pretty strong cult following for several decades. Having played this remake of a remake, I can fully understand why. What Avernum lacks in cutting-edge graphics, it makes up for in spades elsewhere.

Thankfully, this is a game that plays its hand fairly early, and you'll be able to decide whether it's for you inside two hours. The tutorial dungeon gives you an overview of the combat system, skill tree and general environment before flinging you out into the subterranean world that is Avernum. Here be tunnels, 'cities', lizard people, a sallow-skinned populace, dragons, and an environment that oozes atmosphere. This is the strongest point of Avernum; Jeff Vogel and his crew have created a world that feels simultaneously sterile and thriving, lived-in and desolate, depressing yet hopeful. There are areas of population, but mostly innumerable crevasses and passageways untamed by humanity. An entire subterranean ecosystem and corresponding lifestyle has been devised, with a little magical assistance. Law and order tenuously holds...in some regions. And multiple factions war amongst themselves on several fronts. It's quite a unique and compelling environment to be stuck in, despite seeming visually bland at first glance.

The writing is excellent, particularly considering the small team. Flavour-text is plentiful, and most important NPCs will respond to the events of the gaming world as you complete quests and move the plot forward. Each little town and freehold has a purpose and speciality, making them feel distinct - often aided by the quests they give out. Fort Draco works iron like no other town, but has a major issue with oversized arachnids; several southern towns have soldiers to spare, but little iron and the market is priced accordingly. Speaking of quests, there's over 80 in the game, and they're varied - ranging from fetching materials to banishing mighty demons. Many of them give you autonomy in the method of completion, and just deciding to kill everyone involved can occasionally be an option. If I have one major criticism of this game, it's that it does get quite overwhelming at points; you can amass an absurd number of quests at once if you're not clearing them regularly, and that can certainly add a bit of fatigue as you try to keep track of things.

The graphics are rudimentary, and evidently not at the coalface of development for obvious reasons...this doesn't especially detract from the game, and when paired with a clean interface is occasionally quite charming in an old-school way. All information is clearly conveyed, at any rate, which is vital in a game like this. The sound design is interesting; Vogel is on record as disliking ambient music in his games, so Avernum is largely comprised of a strong and wide range of sound effects that bolster the overall texture and atmosphere. The battle system is also pretty basic, albeit with increasing subtlety as the game marches on and you accrue more skills - I'm not too fussed about battles in a game like this where the focus is on the writing and game world, but you will be doing a lot of fighting, so the system will be important to most. To that end, I'd steer clear of Torment difficulty on a first pass through the game, since I hear that combat gets supremely frustrating unless you know the game mechanics intimately.

Mostly though, Avernum captured my rapt attention through the richly-detailed environment, oddly compelling plot and unique feel. Like Trails in the Sky, it's a game that rides a strong script into an unusual setting and doesn't look back. There are weak points, and it won't be for everyone, but Avernum is honestly one of the most absorbing games I've played this year, and left a strong impression.

[i]Итак, Avernum: Escape from the Pit — «шедевр» г-на Джефа Вогеля — является ремейком Avernum 2000 года, который в свою очередь, является ремейком Exile I: Escape from the Pit, игры аж 1995 года. И игра практически не изменилась, претерпев два переиздания. Она из того времени, когда RPG являлись тем, что сейчас принято называть dungeon crawler. Т.е. игры, сконцентрированные на исследовании и боях. При этом художественная часть была элементом второго план, либо игнорировалась.[/i] 

[h1]Нарратив[/h1]
Миром правит злая-презлая Империя (а-ля Советский Союз). Всех преступников, инакомыслящих, геев(!!!), несправедливо обвиненных ссылают в Авернум, суровый подземный мир (а-ля Гулаг), из которого практически невозможно выбраться. Не повезло и группе наших протагонистов. Тут стоит отметить, что идея вполне себе интересная: подземный мир, который получает тепло от непосредственной близости к ядру планеты, а свет — от магически изобретенных люминесцентных грибов, питается искусственно выведенными грибами-растениями, чахлым скотом и ящерицами-переростками.
Но проблема кроется в том, что лор подается скупой парой строчек. Информации о народах, населяющих Авернум, катастрофически мало. К примеру, вы не узнаете ничего о гуманоидных ящерах, кроме того, [spoiler]что их не встретить на поверхности, а в Авернум их изгнали из родного мира собратья за их воинственность и кровожадность.[/spoiler] За интересной задумкой стоит простенькая реализация «чтобы был фон». В то время как Pillars of Eternity обвиняют в излишней многословности лора, в Avernum его недостает. 

Ко всему прочему испытываешь лудонарративный диссонанс. Исходя из сюжета, в Авернум сослали ооочень много людей. Но при этом города состоят из 5-6 домов (а то и трех) и едва-едва двух десятков жителей. В тавернах вечно заняты комнаты. Ассортимент магазинов не обновляется. Персонаж описывается длинноволосым и нечесаным, а на аватарке стриженный под ноль мужик. Одетому в белое монаху досталась моделька мага в зеленом. Дракон с размахом крыльев в 10 метров слегка повыше ваших персонажей. И таких мелочей, рушащих восприятие игры, целая куча.

Диалоги — короткие и обрубленные — малоинформативны, дают слабое представление о мире игры и персонажах. Отсюда — никакого сопереживания и эмоционального вовлечения. Нет глубоких и разветвленных квестов. Все просто: надо найти книгу -> нашел книгу -> отдал. При этом даже не включается окно диалога, а всплывает сообщение: «npc вас благодарит».

Где-то год назад, Джеф Вогель выдал аж две статьи, где разбирал как плохо с нарративом в Pillars of Eternity. Как ему было скучно читать диалоги, и он под конец прокликивал их, о том, что выборы бессмысленны. Весь этот «глубокий» анализ приправлялся россказнями о том, какой он молодец, и что Avernum (правда, речь шла о второй части, но не суть) подвергся тотальному редактированию. Но вместо того, чтобы облагородить текст — где-то раскрыть персонажей, дать героям мотивацию, дать выбор — текст сокращали.
Параллельно с прохождением Avernum я проходил Diablo 3. И знаете, там диалоги и лор, были куда осмысленнее(!!! [i]это фиаско[/i]). Все эти фразы компаньонов с твоим персонажем превращали их из анимированных болванчиков в личности.

[h1]Геймплей[/h1]
В принципе, основное ядро игры сделано неплохо. Но как говорится, дьявол кроется в деталях. Как было сказано выше, исследование и бой — основные действия игры. Путешествовать по подземному миру достаточно интересно. Свернув с дороги, вы, скорее всего, наткнетесь на секрет/событие, а может даже на ценный лут. Но, к сожалению, мир огромен до неприличия. Кроме того, игра вынуждает вас заниматься бэктрекингом. Так что все эти путешествия очень быстро приедаются.

Поначалу я хотел похвалить сражения в игре. Действительно, пошаговая боевая система всегда приятна. Но знаете, когда под конец тебя пичкают сражениями типа «убей тридцать врагов, пройди по подземелью с постоянно спаунящимися солдатами», начинаешь уставать.

При этом боевая система очень простецкая, и заточена под min-max статов. Хотите нагибать — качайте нужный для вашего класса стат до упора.
Забудьте об отыгрыше. Игра никак не реагирует на ваши действия. Непонятно зачем нужен бесполезный параметр репутации. Непонятно почему игра не реагирует, когда я обносил целые магазины на глазах у хозяина.
Вариативности практически нет. А где она есть — опять же не важно, что вы выберите. Я всю игру помогал агенту Империи, и все равно мне пришлось свергать тиранию. 

[h1]Визуальная часть[/h1]
Ну, игра поддерживает высокое разрешение…К сожалению, это единственное хорошее, что можно сказать о ее визуальном аспекте. 
Достаточно открыть скриншоты и убедиться, что уровень графики остался в нулевых. Современные инди-RPG, несмотря на изометрический вид, стараются облагородить свою графику детализацией, освещением (Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin, Wastelands 2 и прочее). Игры с меньшим бюджетом превращают пиксель-арт в мини шедевры. Интересный дизайн тоже не про Avernum. Если вы видели один город, считайте, видели их все. Несколько типов ландшафта — это все на что хватило Spiderweb.
Но самый кошмар — это модели персонажей и врагов. Разнообразия нет вообще. Как вы себе представляете сражение с суровым последним боссом? А как вам, что у него моделька как у алхимика или торговца из города? Эта же модель использована для магов вражеских и дружественных. Одни и те же модели монстров, раскрашенные в разные цвета — это все разнообразие.

[h1]Аудио часть[/h1]
С этим пунктом еще беднее. Скудный набор звуков и полтора трека. Яркий показатель того, что не вписалось в бюджет.

[h1]Технологическая часть[/h1]
С технологической точки зрения игра просто кошмар.
Годы опыта, скопившегося за время существования игровой индустрии, Spiderweb старательно игнорируют.
Отсутствие банальной подсветки предметов, игра превращается в настоящий пиксельхантинг. И чтобы узнать, лежит ли что-нибудь на земле, нужно открывать инвентарь. Существует шанс, что находясь в достаточном отдалении от предмета, вы его пропустите. 
Для часто используемых скиллов выделили всего четыре слота. При условии, что приходится подстраиваться под ситуацию и вместо, скажем, огня, атаковать молниями, т.к. у противников иммунитет к огненным атакам.
Герои всегда ходят гуськом. Отряд нельзя разделить. Т.е. заранее выбрать более выгодные позиции для персонажей невозможно.

[h1]Выводы[/h1]
Я не вижу, где здесь ремейк:
[list]
[*]Морально устаревшие решения в геймдизайне.
[*]Визуальная часть и интерфейс — кровавые слезы. Единственное старание — прикрутили разрешение на широкоформатники.
[*]Художественная часть — будто проба пера подростка. Как утверждает Джеф, была проведена редакторская работа и «многабукоф» было выброшено на помойку. Вполне возможно были выкинуты куски лорной информации. Лучше бы сократили размер игрового мира и свели бэктрекинг к минимуму.
[*]Несбалансированная и маловариативная боевая система.

Это не игра. [b]Это труп игры, воскрешенный злобным некромантом Вогелем.[/b]
В Escape from the Pit я провел 90 часов (70 часов на полное прохождение + 20 часов пришлось выкинуть из-за запоротой прокачки) и я хотел бы злиться на игру и ее создателя… Но я опустошен. От прохождения я не испытал ни радости, ни облегчения. Как бы сказала моя Охотница на демонов из Diablo:

difficile d'évaluer ce jeu...bon c'est pas beau et ca manque de bruitages mais bon ce n'est pas ce qui me gene le plus...
mais bon c'est austère quand même, le jeu souffre de la compraison avec baldur s gate 2 avec sa musique et ses bruitages et ces personnages charismatiques.
disons que voila, ca manque franchement d'originaliité :
l'idée que tout se passe dans une immense caverne (mais alors vraiment immense) est plutot bonne en soi...les gens se nourrissent de champignons et ont édifié des forts,  ils vivent pauvrement et ont la peau blanchatre...(sans que ca se voit graphiquement sur les skins des personnages...)

MAIS
 les quêtes ne suivent pas derrière...j'ai joué 9-10 heures et pour l'instant  j'ai chassé du bandit, de la chauve souris et des humanoides-qui-détestent l'humanité aidés par des gobelins...le genre de trucs que tout amateur de rpg a déjà fait dix fois...
les donjons sont pas mal designés avec un ou deux passages secrets qui cassent l'impression de porte-monstre-tresor...mais ils ne s'illustrent pas non plus (monstres rencontrés dans les donjons par exemple : des rats géants ,eh oui ENCORE...) 
le pire c'est les boss où on a un faux semblant de dialogue : par exemple le sombre pretre se tient devant moi et me défie, je llui dis assez le sang a suffisamment coulé, esperant que des choix vont s'ouvrir (va t il falloir le corrompre ? va t il me proposer une quete ?) et ben non on enchaine sur le combat sans que ca ait de conséquences
c'est comme le systeme de combat : c'est vu et revu... les mages ont des sorts type boule de feu et invocation de monstres , les pretres des sorts de heal et de boost...
les 3-4 villes  que j'ai visité se ressemblent : un magasin, une auberge, un office et un tableau de quêtes...Elles manquent d'un axe majeur, de quelque chose qui les différencie l'une de l'autre et leur donne une personnalité
en somme l'écriture des quêtes n'est pas spécialement profonde, les personnages secondaires sont plutot bien décrits mais ca manque de vraies grosses discussions (notamment les compagnons), il ya la quantité mais ca manque de profondeur...

globalement le jeu n'est pas mauvais c'est juste qu'il souffre de la comparaison avec baldur s gate 1 et 2, fallout 1 et 2 (qui proposait un setting vraiment original malgré sa laideur), voire meme plus récemment avec morrowind (pour les champignons et l'immensité du monde)

You will run into situations that you just can't handle until later, others that you can but you have to try a few times to get things to turn out right.

If you like turn based rpgs and don't mind crude graphics, this is a stellar game.  About the best you can get from an indie group.

I never had the opportunity to play the original Exile trilogy, the Avernum trilogy, or its three sequels.  This reboot is my first experience and I can finally see why so many people were drawn to this series of games.

The simplicity is its draw.  Well, for me anyway.  An easy to use interface with simple world design has allowed for a game with Elder Scrolls level amounts of detail.  Now I don't consider this a drawback, but some will, the game is incredibly text heavy.  To me, this is a scratch for an old nostalgia itch.

The graphics, while nothing to write home about, are good in their own right.  They fill the niche that the game has created.  You don't have thousands of character portraits, but you do have the ability to design your stats, abilties, skills, etc. to your specification.  And if you just want to start they have classes.  And if you really, really, want to start, the premade starting party is ready to go for a good, balanced game!

You can even use the editor and add spells, abilties, and whatnot without ruining your game which is a nice touch.  I have only invested about nineteen hours so far but plan on investing many, many more for the quest system is awesome.  From the main story (which has several trees of completion), to the side quests, and job boards, there is a ton of stuff to do.

There are fun, random encounters and just getting experience and collecting spells is enjoyable.  Speaking of spells, the system for learning and leveling spells is very reminiscent of AD&D in that one can only learn so much from a teacher.  One must discover the spells ""out in the wild"" or from Arcane Altars if they wish to improve beyond the basics!

There are plenty of items from swords and spears to magic scrolls and wands to the mundane like pipes and towels.  

If you love RPGs you love this game.  If your older and grew up on AD&D I think this game will suck you in!  I know for me it did because I bought all three and its ""sister"" games, the Avadon series.

An old but still very playable game that scores above average to good on every category. Graphics scored lowest due to it being an old game, but still within acceptable parameters. Worth the low price in tenfold!

[b]1. Gameplay (8)[/b]
Already a pretty old RPG, but one that I even recently started playing again because it is just made so well. The gameplay is fun and flexible, you can decide what kind of party you will and if you're good enough at it, you can make it work no matter how you want it. A full healer party? Been there, done that!

[b]2. Content (8)[/b]
The content is more than one would think at first impression. It is a very big world and becoming a thief will make some NPCs attack you, instead of giving you a quest. A big part of the game changes when you change your choices, which is very unique for an old game like this!

[b]3. Graphics (6)[/b]
Although the graphics and some interfaces have been redone entirely from scratch in the later years, it is still an old game and so it has, in comparison to now, shitty graphics. But it is certainly very playable after the graphics updates the creator of this game has done a few years after the release.

[b]4. Comparisons (8)[/b]
In comparison to other RPGs, I got to say this was certainly one of the better ones. Nowadays, of course, better ones came out. But back in the day, this was absolutely unique. The graphics and interface update is a nice bonus and makes this still a game in the top tier of its kind!

[b]5. Price (9)[/b]
There are no microtransactions in the game which makes the buy price the only money you can and will spend on it. Certainly worth it, as the low price can provide for a way higher number of hours!

[b]Bugs (-0)[/b]
Not specifically bugs, but some standard hotkeys do not work since they weren't ""standard"" back in the day. But one can easily get used to this after an hour or two.

[i]Avernum: Escape from the Pit[/i] is actually (deep breath) a slightly remastered version of the dev's own remake of one of his earliest games.  Over twenty years ago, he released [i]Exile:  Escape from the Pit.[/i]  Two more games were released until he decided to remake the trilogy as Avernum.  Then, he added a second trilogy to the story of the Avernum series.  I played the second trilogy's games when they came out and liked them, but had yet to get around to the original three.

So, time to finish the series, if a bit backwards.  Hee hee.

Spiderweb Software's games are decidedly old-school, with isometric graphics, but a [b]DEEP[/b] and detailed storyline.  Tons of quests big and small, and a novel's worth of dialogue and descriptions.

You have some, but not a lot of chances to choose what happens instead of a simple scripted event.  Several dialogue trees merely serve to funnel you back to a mini-boss fight.  Other dialogue trees bury what you need to unlock or finish a quest with an NPC.  You may have to systematically work through the choices to progress in a quest.

The 90+ hours I put in covered most of the quests, and attempting all three of the possible final quests.  You can do all three in the same game.  Plus, of course, lots of reloads because characters perished.  (Only complete party death is fatal to a game.  Reach a town with even one live character, and the rest are revitalized.  I usually reloaded if just one died.)

You have near-total customization of your party.  Unlike later games, your party must be all humans.  You can choose from one of several looks for your characters, though.  While you are given the choice of ""classes,"" really those are just starting builds.  As you level up, you gain points to put in stats and skills and traits that you can allocate almost however you wish.

Of course, given that there are mage and priest spells in the game, you will probably create one of each magic school.  Pure warriors are not left out, however.  As you level up in weapon skills, those unlock battle discplines for extra power or a spell-like effect.

There's very little hand-holding in these games, aside from a quick tutorial at the start.  And once you leave the town you start in, there's very little guidance on what areas are good for what levels.  You'll be getting quests in nearby areas that are too strong for you for a good while.

Fortunately, there are some in-game helps.  There's a journal of quests and a way to save pages of information beyond what the quest journal gives you, and a list of the undroppable quest items you accumulate.  You have a game world map with not only a ""you are here"" marker but also points of interest you find and important quest locations marked.  You also have a mini-map that is automapped as you explore.

Game action is turn-based, but not tediously so.  If you are not in combat, just clicking on a distant tile that is not too far away will send you walking.  

Enemies are numerous but generally finite, no random encounters.  Do most of the quests, though, and you will max out your point potential.  This only becomes frustrating when trying the final quests and you'd rather have a couple more levels to survive.  (One of the three final quests is [b]BRUTAL[/b] and made me ragequit the final battle after a few attempts.

Gold is limited and best reserved for purchasing spells.  Note that you can only gain two levels in a spell or skill from a trainer, but that there is often a book out somewhere for a third level.  You are much better off raiding and trading for other useful items such as potions.

However, inventory management is excellent.  Part of your inventory is devoted to a bottomless ""junk"" bag that you can just toss in anything you are going to sell and then sell all in just one click.  This is a feature I do not recall being in the second trilogy.

Each character's individual inventory is limited, but you can dive into inventory even in battle to use an item.  There is also a strength-based encumbrance limit on equipment; too heavy and it will slow you down.  This is only a factor in the early game.

Movement seems to be the only thing that is mouse-only.  Everything else has keyboard shortcuts.


Without playing the original Avernum game, it's tough to tell what might have been added, outside of perhaps the junk bag.  Some details do feel like a bit of seeding for future games, either planned when first created or additions in the remaster.

It is a delight to see how the land evolves over the series.  If you've played one and liked that game, you'll enjoy any of the others.",1529827248,1529827288,True,5,0,0.59050297737121582,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On the road, curiosity beat me and I took land on an island. There was a cave full of spell casting evil spiders. The boss of the cave was a hivemind spider, and I killed it in a very hard fight. Then I came up with another cave which is full of spiders, again. But those huge spiders were friendly, all named Spider. One of them found my char ""cute"" and wanted to mate with me... I politely refused. It kissed my leg and run away.

It's reminiscent of tabletop RPGs, and the game has an elaborate and unique setting. The game is heavy on exploration, dungeon crawling, quests, and building up your party of four characters. Graphics are basic, rather like a simplified version of the original Fallout game; they're more suggestive props than a serious attempt to render the world of Avernum.

What I liked:
+The game is built from the ground up to be flexible and nonlinear. You go where you want to go, you do what you want to do, and you develop your characters how you want to develop them. There are different three main quests; you don't have to do them, you don't have to do them in a set order, and many of the steps provide alternate approaches. While spellcasters and dual-wielding fighters tend to out-perform most other classes, it's quite possible to beat the game with all kinds of different party builds.
+The game scales very nicely as you level up; big boss fights can remain challenging up to and even beyond level 30. There's a nice variety of items as you build up your party, allowing you to tailor your characters' gear and skills to specific tasks and roles. 
+The writing and the concept of the setting are both excellent, and there are a lot of little details that the developers have thrown in. The world of Avernum is packed with places to explore, people to meet and talk to, and enemies to slay. 

What I didn't like: This is mostly nitpicking.
-Sometimes it could be difficult to see some of the items littering a floor, because they don't stand out well.
-Many major quests depend on you noticing tiny features on the screen such as buttons that open secret doors. Missing these buttons required me to do a considerable amount of back-tracking. Eventually, I simply looked up each dungeon online after I finished it to ensure that I hadn't missed something important. 
-A few character features either don't work at all, or make so little difference that they're a waste. The Challenger trait, for example, is supposed to draw enemies' attentions toward a character, but they seemed just as happy to go after others. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend this game.",1518495917,1518495917,True,4,1,0.544586002826690674,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Fast forward to now, years on, I had long lost forgotten the title of the game and every so often I had remembered the interesting isometric, turn-based game that had filled my childhood with wonders. 

And then about a week ago, I found it. It was in my cart faster than you can say Avernum.

This game is clearly not a game about graphics. If you are big on story driven games, there's a chance you'll enjoy this one.  The controls aren't the most intuitive, and the game feels like it's from the 90s however in my opinion, that's just part of the charm. Though of course, I could be biased because I've been playing the game nonstop since I bought it a week ago.

For me, it's mostly the feeling of fulfilment and satisfaction I've gotten out of following the story, making some hard choices (since there are a few to make - questing is quite intricate in some cases) and deciding what kind of path I want my characters to take. You can choose a standard party of four - a warrior, dex class, healer and mage.. or you can be a badass and play with four priests. In the end you can build your character however you like, which is something I really enjoyed playing around with.

It's a must play if you're into oldschool rpgs.

J'ai bien aimé l'histoire/ le lore, plutot original.
Petit souci dans le systeme de combat: certaines cases (derriere un personnage un peu grand par exemple) sont incliquables. On a pas de preview quand on donne un ordre, si bien que parfois vos perso font n'importe quoi...
J'ai aussi été un petit peu décu par l'arbre des competence trop simpliste. On se spécialise dans seulement 2 types d'armes de melés (et encore ca se croise), 2 type d'arme a distance (et encore ca se croise), et la magie magicien ou pretre, mais tout ca se croise plus ou moins... j'vous ai dit que ca se croisait beaucoup ?
Le jeu a des arcs longs, et des courts, mais ca change rien en fait. Un moment j'avais en ma possession un arc long qui faisait plus de dommage que mon arc court, mais ce dernier valait plus cher que le long... pour quelle raison ? De plus il n'y a aucun inconvenient a choisir l'arc long plutot que le court... étrange.
Mais j'ai quand meme kiffé. 

Le jeu se prete bien au dual screen: le jeu sur l'écran principal et un documentaire/le JT/ une vidéo youtube sur le deuxieme ecran ! Ca m'a permi de rattraper mon retard sur les video que j'avais a regarder.

Dans la plupart des RPG auxquels j'ai joué, les jeux deviennent trop facile avec le temps. Y'a un palier plus ou moins haut au-dessus duquel le jeu devient facile (et souvent chiant) et ce peu importe le niveau de difficulte. Pour Avernum je l'ai mis en mode difficile, et ils se sont pas foutu de moi ! j'en ai pas mal chié tout du long... jusqu'a la fin. Le niveau de difficulte est TRES bien dosé. Bref, j'ai mis le jeu en dur, j'ai eu ce que je voulais tout du long, pas juste les 10 premiers niveaux.",1518185654,1519315119,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,False,,,

Now feel I am in a good position toprovide some thoughts.  

Basic graphics but story holds it together and keeps you engaged.  Text heavy and suggest increasing this in the options to large.  No voice and limited sound affects.  Open world does give you the option to go anywhere and it is far from a linear experience.  Buying a boat really opens up the map and you will find a need to uncover as much of the map as possible.  

Turn based combat is simple in its structure and spells and disciplines, provides a huge number of tactical options with your playthrough.  Add in potions, buffs and enchanted weapons and there is plently of variety.  Combat can be slow initially until spells etc are bought, made available later in the game.   

Quests do not hold your hand.  They can be cryptic and you need to take note of NPC dialogs / clues.  Some items can also be given to more than 1 person for varying results.  It is recommended to 'record' any dialog containing clues using the record function.  Saves having to find and speak to the NPC again.

Overall provides 50+ hours of entertainment but longer to obtain the acheivements.   

It is a retro style game which will discount many players, but it makes up for it in many other ways.  Value for money is good against expected playtime and a strong storyline to support which is often lacking in modern RPG's.

This is an old school Computer Roleplaying game. I played the old Exile Series as the game still was shareware, and the upgrade only served to make this game a bit more apealing to new players. The developer also created a newer Stats/Skill/Trait interface which makes the game a lot more accessible and the choices a lot easier. Keep in mind, that level only plays a secondary role in this game, they only serve to power your skills, and though it's good to have experts in your group some skills are working for the group as a whole - that said, I resent experts and prefer a group of all hybrids (Arcane Priest, Divine Mage, Holy Lancer and/or Paladin)

Yes, you can customize your classes too, which is a good thing. Also choose your traits wisely when you play this game, almost everything in this game has limits, the amount of gold you can get is one example, or the traits you may chose, or your skillpoints, Javelins, Potions and such - all and everything is precious in avernum which makes the story even more believable. Also the devs put in here an option to remove unneccesary clutter (the trash-bag)... All in all if you compare this to Exile or Genforge the devs put a lot of love in their revival.

[tr][th]Category[/th][th]Score[/th][th]Notes[/th][/tr]
[tr][td]Graphics[/td][td]7[/td][td]Compared to the old Exile the graphics have been boosted. Nonetheless, they are still spartan compared to other games. But as with all classical RPG games, graphics isn't everything.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Sound[/td][td]6[/td][td]Don't expect too much sound in those games, you will have strange noises in the big cave that Avernum is, but not so much as a soundtrack or continous music playing. But actually the howling wind, the strange noises of some alien critters is much more than you need for atmosphere.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Story[/td][td]9[/td][td]Why a solid 9? Play the game, immerse yourself in one of the best indie storylines. There are really a lot of quests, challenging or overwhelming some. And the story where you chose to either plot revenge upon the empire, or try to settle in somehow.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Character Dev.[/td][td]7[/td][td]This game offers enough freedom to create your own characters and you can develop them around specialities, or just spread them as your fancy strikes. Also you need to plan ahead, don't waste resources like potions or mana on critters that are just trash mobs for your level, but use the lowest and most effective ways to dispose of them.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Playability[/td][td]8[/td][td]Easy to learn, yet hard to master. This game doesn't hold your hands and you actually can die pretty much, pretty early in the game. Safe often, Quicksafe and Autosafe is included in the game.[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Value for Money[/td][td]8[/td][td]As with almost all games that orient themselves on old-school gaming this game offers dozens and dozens of gaming hours, you can pretty much spent a hundred hours in this game and still have not all achievements, all quests solved or even found.[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Overall[/th][td]7.5 ~ 8[/td][td]*[/td][/tr][/table]

Having started at that age, the games had a pretty big effect on me, and I credit them quite a bit with making me interested both in games in general, and also in writing, which I'm now pursuing as a career.

I bought EFTP after much debate because I love the games, but I was not a big fan of the gameplay in 4-6, and had only ever played the first Geneforge. I don't honestly recall if I finished Avernum 4-6, to be honest. But I finally got the itch again and went ahead and bought this version, partially because I didn't want to keep bothering Jeff for game codes every few years lmao. That, and I've decided to subject my friends to some tabletop campaigns in Avernum, and I can record this version more easily for my notes.

I was very pleased with the update. No, it doesn't add a whole lot of extra content, and I'm mixed on some combat changes (WHY DOES HIGH LEVEL SMITE NOT TARGET MULTIPLE THINGS? DOES IT DO EXTRA DAMAGE TO DEMONS ANYMORE? WHY ME? WHERE DID BEAST CEREMONY GO?? but alternatively: HASTE TARGETS EVERYONE! CONE ATTACKS/AOES! FUCK YEAH). 

But as for being in the spirit of the original? Very much so. [i]Very much so.[/i] The nostalgia alone was worth it.

So I'd argue that, if you're just getting into the series, returning from a long absence, or just really fucking love the games, EFTP is certainly worth the money. The last time I played the originals (on Windows 7, I think?) I did have some issues, so having them updated was definitely appreciated.

Overall, I most definitely enjoyed my return to underground Australia, and am looking forward to 3's update in 2018.

I'd say more like 50/50. It's not an easy title to review. I appreciate the fact it's a small team game, but it seriously retards your progress sometimes. The setting is good. In fact, a lot of the tripple A titles can only wish for a world setting that is as interesting as Avernum's. Writing is ok; again, it's a lot of text for a small team and it shows. While you can follow the CLEAR directions given to you and still explore with abandon, oftentimes the writing falls just a centimeter short of a tropey throw-away. The saving grace here being that it is when you're dealing with the side quests. There is an interesting and challanging monster variety. Character progression is good. My tank feels like a tank, my mage is not terribly squishy. Things USUALLY agro the first character that charges at them(that helps you immensely when you play). Combat is not too repetitive and sometimes requires unique approach for bosses. There are some solid consumables to play with.   

It's lacking some quality of life elements that can make the game a lot better--UI organization, interaction with the environment. Ease of accesss stuff, so to speak. More shortcut spaces. Easier periphery organisation for the player. A plethora of small stuff, that was perhaps overlooked. Combat balance and difficulty spikes are all over the place. But I guess people would form their own opinion about that. A good deal of misses, even for characters who have invested in dexterity and skills. Mobs can have too much resistances and too high of an evasion, or too high damage and easy spammable abilities that do too many things at once. It can get downright frustrating at times. Consumables can massively alter the direction of combat(can be good/bad). Bullet sponges also make an appearance. Sometimes that is alright. Sometimes it feels inapropiate (a shaman that is ridiculously overpowered). Sometimes it feels boring (especially when it happens with every boss mob that is also showering you with poison in a tight nephelim fortress, which leads you to overconsume potions). Sometimes it feel great and done right, for instance, fighting a giant for which you get a specific side quest and he is a real challange with a really good reward. It's a lot of hit and miss with this game. There is a lot of content to go through and I just get the feeling that in the making of this game there wasn't enough thought about which is going to be good/bad. There are things like pacing between conversation and combat, exploration, main story, side quests. Avernum somehow manages to strike a balance in that regard. But it doesn't feel like it was because somebody wanted it.

The game as a whole is not bad. I suppose you should play it on it's easiest/normal setting. But who wants to do that? It needs polish; balance polish. 50/50. I am truly in the middle, despite the tag. And I will play through the whole of it, because I am an RPG nerd. For my kind Avernum is a must.

在游戏中很快的，玩家就会接到一个要求清理解决鬼怪骚扰的任务，前往一个名叫Spiral  Pit的场景。游戏会通过一些非常简单的音效，让玩家迅速感觉到：嗯，这地方闹鬼。接下来一段文本出现，描述了这个洞穴于Avernum普遍环境的区别：“……区别于外面广泛而弥曼的闷热和硫磺味儿，螺旋洞内的空气干净却又寒冷。这种是一种异常的寒冷，让人不禁警觉这个地方背后邪恶法术。……”
接下来的一段时间里，玩家需要不停的在一条宽度只能通过一个单位的狭窄走廊中探索前进，不时的需要解决前后夹击的敌人。——这真是巧妙的关卡空间设计，它带来的压迫感，配合之前的文本，确实让我紧张了起来。
接下来，很突然的，洞穴里全都黑了，文本跳出来告诉我：“忽然之间，一切陷入了黑暗之中，你几乎什么也都看不清楚了。”我赶紧打开背包把蜡烛点上，它只能照亮小队成员们周围三格的范围。你能看见在有限的空间里有几个尸鬼和幽灵，而周围红色的格子告诉你在黑暗中还隐藏着更多。它们向你冲过来。
在这一关的最后，也就是螺旋洞的中心，会跳出一个本文，讲述了这个洞穴遭到死灵占据的原因：“一瞬之间，你眼前浮现了一场环境。那是在很久之前，一些身着古旧铠甲的战士们遭到蜥蜴族的追击被迫逃难至此，却发现螺旋的隧道将他们引入了死路。蜥蜴族族虐杀了他们。战士中随团的法师在临死之际将洞穴封住，这让蜥蜴族的暴徒们也无法脱身。被肢解的战士们，他们的怨灵不愿离去，牢牢盘踞在这个洞中。等你清醒过来，你意识到即便是消灭了亡灵的头目，你也无法彻底清楚这里的诅咒。”之后是一场BOSS战，亡灵的头目不停的召唤身边的怨灵从周边的围墙中涌现对你们进行围攻，当然这也是通过文本的方式表达的。

''Avernum: Escape From the Pit'' è il secondo remake di un gioco chiamato Exile, ma lo migliora con una nuova veste grafica (che non fa gridare al miracolo ma non è nemmeno inguardabile) e lo rende compatibile con i nuovi sistemi operativi. Avernum non è un gioco di difficile comprensione come un vecchio ''Fallout'' o un ''Bards Tale'' visto che si viene accolti da un dungeon introduttivo molto facile che vi spiega tutto quello che potete fare nel titolo, ma non è nemmeno in modalità autoplay come molti ''RPG'' moderni perchè mantiene alcune caratteristiche molto old school. Ad esempio la necessità di andare da un trainer per migliorare le proprie abilità. Dovrete tenere a mente l'ubicazione di chi vi ha dato la quest e a che punto della quest siete per evitare di fare giri a vuoto perchè è vero che molte quest sono indicate sulla mappa di gioco, ma il diario non verrà aggiornato. In realtà non è così difficile ricordare i vari indizi grazie alla presenza di un apposito pulsante record che copia l'intero pezzo di dialogo nel vostro diario. Insomma se non ve ne frega nulla di una grafica spettacolare, ma volete solo giocare un RPG con tante cose da fare compratelo a occhi chiusi. Di solito lo si trova a 2-3 € insomma è praticamente regalato per quello che offre.",1507134354,1507134354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When I was the tiniest of children, I was introduced to a series of party-based adventure stories - rich in character and consequence - called Exile. These games instilled in me a great appreciation for video games that try to create and simulate an actual world, alive with a beating populace for whom one could feel genuinely acquainted.

Twenty years later, after decades of wondering where those games went and why there are so many series that use the word 'Exile', I discovered that Spiderweb Software are alive and well, still developing and still destributing the Exile series.

Sadly, that series cannot be run on modern operating systems. I should restate... it would be sad - if Spiderweb hadn't taken the time to update said games and make them available once more.

Full and oddyssean, not just for the time but even compared to some modern games, Avernum is a highly enjoyable and suprisingly replayable Fantasy classic dealing with the ever-poignant themes of loss, fear, struggle, unity and the determination of the living to do just that.

I am so glad I bought this amazing thing. Don't let the graphics trick you into thinking this is a cheap, low-quality game--its not.

The only thing just to be ready for is the interface is quite unlike any other game (at least that I've played) and as such gameplay will probably be clunky and it takes a few hours to really get the hang of it. If you give it it a chance, you will struggle to put the game down after the 3ish hours or so.
(that was about how long it took for me to start having fun with the combat--again at first the mechanics/controls are difficult so fighting is a pain in the behind but after you can actually do things in an orderly manner it gets fun rather quickly)

Noteworthy Stuff:

Very compelling story. Quite original, quests make sense and have meaning, and because the writing is so good you'll actually want to read all the dialogue. Tons of secrets, things to learn about the very big world.

Challenging/Rewarding gameplay. Hard when it should be, not just to be a nuisance for fighting every single monster. When you get to stop some terrible thing from happening it feels really good.

FREEDOM TO EXPLORE: This game doesn't treat you like a baby. Very big world, no invisible walls, no ""you cannot enter this area yet"" garbage. The toughness of the monsters will keep you from an area if you're not ready for it. There are many many places to explore, interesting pieces of Avernums past and other secrets to learn.

There are plenty of quests to complete in the game, from simple delivering a message to slaying a strong group of monsters in a small cave.  Most of the towns do have unique shops in them, like one may have someone who can train a combat skill whereas another sells boats needed to reach another area.
The game does lack a bit in puzzles to solve to progress.  It plays a bit heavily toward hack'n slash as most battles in the game are normally kill the monsters to win.  Some battles may be more difficult to overcome and require more tact to succeed.  For example, your group can position yourself to fight in a doorway so you only fight one monster at a time, which is the best way to win because you are likely to get killed when the rest of the monsters pummel your weaker support characters.
Although it is possible to search out different areas of the game from the start, it does play a bit more linear because going to those other areas can possible get your party killed as the monsters that roam different parts of the game tend to be more powerful than what your party can handle.  So usually when someone in town suggests you go some place to see if you can help them, it is best to just go that way.
The game does suffer from some nuisances.  The biggest for me was the battles.  Sometimes it is difficult to cast an attack spell because when you attempt to focus on which grids it will affect, your party members or the enemy characters will interfere with your placement.  Sometimes I was unable to get the targeting grid to set in position to attack as many hostiles as I would like because it kept jumping to different spots, so I may cast a Lightning Spell only to hit three of the five enemy targets I wanted to hit.  
Another issue with the battles is the inability to know if your spell will target the enemy (or ally) or not.  If someone was to cast a group heal spell, there would be no way to know if one party member was out of range of the spell until it was cast.  If an enemy position him/herself against a cave wall in a certain way, it is difficult to spot if its grid is targeted to not.  
If there was a way to make characters transparant for targeting with spells and make the characters a spell will affect give a glow or maybe change color to indicate the spell is in their range, it would help alleviate these problems.
These may seem like a big issue in the game but it really does not break the game at all.  Just small nuisance for a great game to check out.  
I thoroughly enjoyed exploring in the game, discovering a new underground cave system to uncover new weapons and armor, new towns, and hidden treasure in some random corner on the over (under) world map.
I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy a more traditional role playing game with text to read to get a feel of the world.

Cons:
 - It has much, much less variation in the graphics than in Fallout 1/2.
 - Smaller towns (with less dialogue in each town) than in Fallout 1/2.
 - The towns' characters have less personality than in Fallout 1/2.
 - Parts of the world are gated until you've become powerful enough to get through some certain areas, so it isn't possible to stumble upon the most-powerful enemies in the game, the way you can in Fallout (which can be extremely frustrating but can also produce memorable experiences if you manage to escape alive).

Pros: 
 - There are many, many more towns and dungeons than in Fallout 1/2.
 - The creator did an incredible job of setting the difficulty curve of the game.  Throughout my entire 80 hours playing it, I found myself hitting this sweet spot of difficulty where I needed to focus during a fight or I would die, but if I *did* focus, I would almost always emerge victorious.


Just different:
 - The writing doesn't have the humor of Fallout 2.

- avoir des attentes très modestes concernant la réalisation graphique et sonore
- aimer les combats tactiques complexes au tour par tour
- aimer les RPG ""medieval fantastique"" avec des histoires profondes

- son ambiance oppressente et des personnages fouillés
- Grâce à son monde ouvert et cohérent : Vous n'avez pas le niveau pour visiter l'antre du dragon Anthron, pas de soucis...10 autres endroits sont à explorer à votre niveau, dans n'importe quel ordre
- la variété des ses quêtes

It has a very compelling (so far) story, a reasonably complex character building. And is wholly turn based, so you can keep out for 3 hours and forget to turn the game off, what probably justifies the big game hours that I have.
I have never finished the game. Not that I ever finish a game: I've never finished Oblivion, Skyrim, Morrowind...

The good:

Clever rogue-like x tactical turn-based combat ;
Interesting development choices for your characters: there are no ""classes"" in the normal sense. I currently have a party of a tank priest, tank mage, a spearman and a swordsman, both starting in the healing arts, now.

Open game: Playing on the average difficulty, there are places where I still do not dare to go in the game. Oh, and it is an open-game: want to go all the way down to the pits of doom? Be my guest, and good luck : you will need a lot of it and lots of reloads, but it is possible...

Compelling and well told story. You are thrown into a subterranean world by an evil emperor, and that happens to be the fate of every other human thrown there... If you wink the wrong may, say something you wouldn't, you will end up here. When you get there you find an struggling, evolving society, based on the growth of magical fungus and trees. ANd not without their power struggles: there are the catlike nephilim, also thrown here by hawthorne, and the native (?) slithzerikai, lizard men native to the place... And the avernites are at war with both. Not mentioning the abyss, where the most dangerous criminals are exiled from avernum itself... All this is told you by clever character dialogs (text based), where you feel the despair of the inhabitants, some of the depression, craziness...  And there is no way out (or is there)?


The bad: 

The user interface is annoying: I had to manually edit many of the stock sprite screens to be able to identify objects that I can pick up (made the sprites have green stars when they are pickable). There are many objects that are not obvious containers (a bonfire, a dead body, a pile of skulls), yet they are... The map is isometric, and the walls are all opaque, making for situations where you simply can't find an object to interact with. 
The inventory screen doesn't show your armor and protection levels, making you bounce back and forth between the inventory and character sheet. Inventory . Esc. Character sheet . esc. inventory... 
The map is made of elevated isometric tiles: this can make the identification of where in the grid a foe is on the combat screen difficult some times... And you can't target properly area of effect spells... sometimes the characters get literally in the way of the actual square where you want to center a spell. 
Other times, this same visualization issues can make you target a square that is out of range , making you lose a turn by accident. Oh, and the keys for attack and shoot are the exact same: you switch them with the s key. Making you try a melee combat when you want to shoot, and vice-versa.

Here are some impressions on the game that can support my recommendation...

This is the first time I play turn based RPG, and this game easily gets me into the sub-genre:

+
Excellent combat.
Difficulty settings balanced.
Very good story. Unpredictive. Emotional.
Unique world, engine, atmo.
Nice skill tree and character developement.
Payed attention to details.
Overpayed attention to details.
Huge open world
Exploration.
Enough lore.
3 ways to win the game (can do multiple endings, I did 2)

+/-
4 members party to lead. (I liked this)

-
Game doesn't explain itself enough at some points, This can lead to being totally stuck with nowhere to go, but to the internet. I admit I did this horrible, cowardly thing twice to win the game on alternate ending :( I didn't have to use help to win it first time tho.

Overally, I really recommend Avernum, for it's full price. Especially for cRPG lovers who already played Baldur's Gate, IW Dale, Planescape, Neverwinter nights and Pillars of Eternity. 

I don't recomend it to people who don't have patience.

Un juego indie, escasamente conocido por el gran público, que debería ocupar un lugar en la biblioteca de cualquier amante de los juegos de rol. Un RPG de corte clásico que a pesar de no brillar por sus gráficos, contiene elementos que lo pueden posicionar entre los grandes del género.

Pros:
-La historia es de lo mejor que he visto en un juego de estas características. La ambientación de Avernum, un mundo subterráneo donde son exiliados los malhechores y enemigos del Imperio, es absolutamente sublime. Los detalles ocultos, la información sobre la Primera Expedición, el emperador/tirano, demonios encarcelados, armas destruidas que podrás volver a forjar, personajes que te cuentan las razones que les han llevado hasta allí… Todo ello, por supuesto, conlleva horas y horas de lectura y paciencia para disfrutar de todo lo que ha sucedido y sucede a tu alrededor, construyendo un relato a la altura de la mejor novela de fantasía épica.

-Jugabilidad excelente. Unas mecánicas que te llevarán a probar distintas estrategias en combate, con un nivel de exigencia extremo que te hará echar mano de cada hechizo, poción, pergamino, varita mágica u objeto que tengas en tu inventario. El combate por turnos está muy bien logrado y te hará repetir una y otra vez algunos encuentros clave para intentar salir con vida.

-Buenas horas de juego. Aunque Spiderweb especifique humildemente en la capturas de la tienda de Steam que este título tiene 30+ horas de juego, si veis las que me ha llevado completarlo os daréis cuenta de que da para mucho más. Las misiones secundarias son numerosas, pero aun sin completarlas todas, la historia principal te mantendrá pegado al ordenador una buena temporada.

-Creo que es la mejor inversión que he hecho en mi vida en lo que a calidad/precio se refiere. Avernum: Escape From The Pit me costó 1,25€ y me ha dado más de 80 horas de juego. Me ha gustado tanto el trabajo de Spiderweb que inmediatamente me he lanzado a comprar toda la saga. Este que analizo aquí, más Avernum 2: Crystal Souls, más la trilogía Avernum 4-6, me han costado en total menos de 6€. Epic win.

Contras:
-Gráficos y animaciones mejorables. Personalmente esto no ha repercutido lo más mínimo para disfrutar al máximo de este juego, pero creo que es de recibo avisar al personal. En cualquier caso, las capturas de pantalla de la tienda hablan por sí solas.

-El seguimiento de las misiones se hace un tanto tedioso. En ningún caso se actualizan cuando cumples algunos objetivos y hay veces que ni siquiera se marcan en el mapa. Esto por supuesto le da un plus de dificultad al juego que a mí (llamadme masoca) me ha gustado. He tenido que anotar a mano en un folio algunos datos. Entiendo que pueda haber gente que no esté dispuesta a pasar por ahí, pero en mi caso me he acercado más si cabe a una experiencia rolera total. Debo decir que también he tenido que consultar alguna guía en Internet cuando me he quedado bloqueado. Este juego no es para nada friendly, y aunque pasadas unas horas podrás desenvolverte mejor con sus mecánicas, vas a tener que pelear duro, tanto con la espada como con la cabeza, para poder escapar de Avernum.

-No está traducido al castellano. Es un juego con una cantidad ingente de texto, por lo que si te gusta leer y quieres empaparte de la historia de este mundo subterráneo, algo absolutamente necesario para disfrutar de esta aventura, más vale que te desenvuelvas con el inglés.

-Es imposible encontrar una cama libre en ninguna de las tabernas que se encuentran en las grandes ciudades de Avernum. El insomnio de mis personajes únicamente ha sido comparable al mío cuando esta joya me ha tenido enganchado hasta altas horas de la madrugada.

Conclusión: aunque se trate de una saga muy poco conocida, cualquier amante de los juegos de rol y de la fantasía épica debería probar este título. Siguiendo recomendaciones de Internet y, tras experimentarlo yo mismo, Avernum: Escape From The Pit es la mejor forma de acercarse a este mundo tan desconocido como fascinante.

The skill system is very shallow and just a min-max thing within a few variables. Story and quest management is ok-ish but nothing special. Grafics... well see for your self. You may have dosbox games with the same or better look.
The controls are awful and clunky. Especially moving on the world map. Its a pain to steer a ship and your party because its so unprecise. Then you have the ui which is also annoying. For instance you open the inventory with a key but you cant close it with the same button wtf?! Then there are a lot of missclicks and unintentional clicks using menus like the inventory.

I mean for a very low sale price like 80% or more off its ok if you need smth for a couple hours if you're bored. But overall its a better deal to get dos box and play stuff like return to krondor. The characters are bleak in Avernum with most of the story feeling also very pale. The writing is not good enough to overcome the technical limitations. You might get a retro feeling playing this and remember good old rpg times from the early pc games. But thats about it. I really cant recommend it for having a decent rpg feeling.

I am reviewing this game in isolation. That being said, the impression I get is that people seem to consider this game a ""diamond in the rough"", a game with poor publicity but surprisingly good gameplay given how unknown it is. As for me... well, all I can say is that I understand why this game is as obscure as it is.

Let's start with the atmosphere... the immersion, the feeling, the factor that makes any good RPG its salt. Avernum uses a very similar plot premise to a game I love, Gothic (a game that came out later than Exile, apparently - so Avernum did technically beat Gothic to the punch). An oppressive monarchy throws its criminals - as well as political opponents and anyone it just doesn't want around - into a sealed prison colony where they have to fend for themselves and struggle against each other as well as the wilderness down below. The difference is - where Gothic pulled this off flawlessly (and seriously - if you like Avernum's premise, and haven't played the Gothic games yet, try those out first), Avernum just fails to impress. It becomes obvious immediately as soon as you descend that the prison colony is actually an IMPROVEMENT over the Empire - prosperous, free, and the Empire's rule does not actually have any influence down there. That is a big no-no. It makes it hard to get into the shoes of your characters, who seem to be motivated by revenge or a desire to escape (depending on what conversation options you take as them), because one can't help but think... ""okay, what's the conflict here? What's the big deal? Why don't I just settle down, become a mushroom farmer and have a happy life now that the Empire does not rule me?"" 

Because that's a very valid question. Unlike in Gothic (where the prisoners are dependent upon the surface for luxury goods, weapons and other advanced items, and have to excavate ore in return), Avernum (the prison colony and the game's namesake) is utterly self-sufficient and does not have to give anything back to the Empire. Unlike in Gothic (where there are several camps all ruled by tyrants, the insane and other questionable figures, and there is danger both inside the camps and on the roads, where bandits lie in wait), most of the Avernum world is ruled by a rather unified monarchy with a just king at its helm and with the rule of law largely upheld. (Or so it still seems anyway, well into the midgame. If there is any shocking twist by the end, I know as little of it as you do. Wouldn't matter either way as far as the enjoyment of the story is concerned.) Avernum actually has its sub-prison colony, the Abyss, where the criminals of Avernum are thrown. Not exactly a very inspiring world, is it? Far from the gritty world of Gothic's penal colony, here you stroll almost freely between established towns, the only  enemies being the occasional cat people (sorry - they aren't bikini-clad babes, don't reflex-click the Buy button), snake people (same deal), and generic RPG monsters. Oh, and where Gothic had exciting, living, breathing characters, Avernum's characters are so incredibly dull and lacking any fantasy, it is almost an insult to the genre of Role-Playing Game. 

Seriously - I haven't completed the game, but I have played through a good chunk of it, I think. There is not a single interesting character that I met. Not even the King, nor any of his Mayors - all of them interact with your character in the same way. ""Hello adventurer! Glad/not glad to see you. I love/hate mercenaries. We are fighting the cat/snake people here. I have a quest for you that involves either killing a lot of cat/snake people or retrieving a trinket guarded by cat/snake people. Or occasionally something else like a jelly or a drake, woo hoo!"" Far from being an adventure, the gameplay feels like you are King Micah's head marshal, taking care of his endlessly boring errands throughout the realm, one after the other, never given a break or even an amusing distraction. (And let me just say: this doesn't just apply to the sidequests! Even the main quests themselves are just more of the same.)

Oh, of course, the game mechanics aren't stellar either. The combat system and the skill tree are nothing extraordinary, but at least they are serviceable... except for the horrible pathfinding system. There is no way to see whether your mage/archer is able to strike at the enemy from any given point. You have to click and hope for the best, then one of two things will happen: 1. your character attacks the target (woo hoo!) or 2. your character starts running around like a headless chicken, doing all kinds of crazy stuff, taking non-obvious paths, even attempting (and failing) to run all the way around the map to get at an enemy standing down a corridor (...why???). Nor are the line-of-sight mechanics intuitive - often you can attack when you shouldn't be able to, even more often you can't attack when you should be able to.

The interface isn't exactly great either. Aside from simply being old and dated, it isn't that informative either - there are a lot of weird things that can happen: for example, there is a mechanic that your mages cannot cast spells if they are too ""encumbered"", but either the game just doesn't mention this or it is way too easy to miss, same difference: being ""encumbered"" means not that your gear is too heavy, but that your to-hit chance is too low (...I know right, WTF?). This means, for example, that a +1 strength blade and no shield may leave your character unable to cast spells, but a heavier blade with no strength bonus (but a +5% to hit bonus) and a wooden shield (which doesn't have a to-hit malus) will let you do so. Beyond that, there are - of course - bugs. The game isn't riddled with them, but there are some - some traits don't work at all, for example.

While the big Spiderweb Software bundle may well be worth the price on sale (I don't know, haven't really tried much else from it yet), I can safely say I do not recommend Avernum: Escape from the Pit. If you get the bundle, try something else from it. Give this one a miss. It really isn't worth the hype. I'm sorry I couldn't finish it, but it was simply too much of a brutally boring slog - nonetheless, I hope that even my incomplete experience is enough to cast a convincing judgment... Avernum fails in the worst way an RPG can fail - it prioritizes quantity over quality and does not deliver much of the latter, it showcases how an RPG can go utterly wrong even before you take gameplay mechanics into account.",1482627830,1482628918,False,25,0,0.533763408660888672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Avernum 1 is more streamlined and simplified version in a good way: you have a simplified conversation mechanic (no need to guess the right word to type anymore like in Ultima or king's quest), most of the useful skills are still there but it lacks the 6 party people which gave you the option of specialization to each character (a swordsman,a spearman,a blunt weapon user, a rogue that uses ranged weapons, a mage and a priest) and tou had less spells.
Avernum escape from the pit is bad.....the story is still there (and it’s a good story!!....because it’s the same story for the 3rd time) but it dropped the skill system for a skill tree (why??), the food management aspect which gives more depth is gone (in Avernum 1 you had to be careful where you rest and in the second game where you took the journey to the Vahnatai lands you had to make stops in order to scavenge for food because you always lose some in the waterfalls), some of the useful skills like poisoning are gone, less weapon variation (no one handed spear, no rock throwing, no arrows, no clubs), even less spells, you cannot bash doors and alchemy? Forget it because you need to find alchemist in a town to do this for you and there are no recruitable NPCs...and death has no consequences because youer dead party members revive when entering a friendly town for free unlike in avernum 1 and exile where you had to pay a priest to revive them for a huge sum.
Exile is still my all-time favorite because of the RPG elements (but sadly I need to emulate win 3.1x to play this or get a windows XP machine), Avernum 1 is a very good remake and escape from the pit......no just no, it's bad compared to the originals - a real casualized version for phones and iPads.
If it would have kept the skill system and spells from Avernum 1 at least then I would have given it a good review but as it is…. it's too dumbed down compare to the other versions.

分支剧情最好玩，制作者将很多有意思的小故事作为任务穿插在游戏主线中

这些丰富的支线从多个角度全面地刻画了一个复杂的地下世界，而不是只让玩家把目光放在逃出地下城的主线任务上
另外，没有固定的主角，玩家能够自由选择搭配队伍，这一点我也很喜欢
相比起有着完善背景和性格设定的固定主角（此类题材的主角，或者说玩家扮演的那个角色，通常会是异性恋男性），没有固定主角、自由组合的队伍虽然少了代入感，但是可以让人把更多精力放在战术搭配和世界观设定上
（而且不得不吐槽的一点是，如果玩家是女性或者非异性恋者，玩这种直男主角的游戏，有时候感觉不是一般的糟糕……想想有些游戏的感情线，you know what I mean）

The number of hours I spent exploring just the first portion of the game would be enough to fill a regular game by themselves.  Maybe it's just my play style, but I doubt you could get to the original's Shareware Demon if you weren't by that time ready to play through the rest of the game -- I still consider that the best form of shareware I've ever seen.

And the world-building within that area was astounding.  The idea of living in a giant cave, and how it would affect the citizens, was richly explored, down to the type of farming (mushrooms) and livestock (giant lizards).  The political in-fighting was interesting without being overbearing; it comments here and there on modern issues through the types of people who got tossed in the pit.  The monsters had some variety to them (not, perhaps, as much as more modern games) and the way the combat flows from the environment is really appealing (there's Fight and Peace states, but the fights happen within the place you're at, not in a separate screen).  There's a lot of loot, including bits of trash and such to make the world more immersive; there's little bits of story everywhere.  And although the character-customization options seem to have been streamlined (reduced), there's still plenty of ways to make a unique team.

You can modify your party at any time, and it even comes with a built-in character editor, in case you get stuck (due to poor ability planning) or bored.

Looking at the screenshots gives you a good idea of the look of the game. The writing, though, is probably the strongest feature about Avernum:Escape from the Pit. There is plenty of quick dialogue that forwards the story without becoming overwhelming. There are hundreds of differnet and unique characters to interact with.

One of my favorite aspects of the game is the level scaling... meaning, I feel it doesn't hold your hand as you adventure. Some dungeons are leveled well above your party. This means that at times you need to retreat and come back later. Learning which dungeons are hard is part of the fun, and challenge. I feel that modern games try to hand hold you too much, not allowing you to walk into an overpowered demon boss who promptly decides you are his next meal.

Avernum: Escape from the Pit brings back the old balance and fun of cRPGs. This game has been around since the 90s, first known as Exile: Escape from the Pit. It's got a great legacy and deserves attention.

It is a grid, turn based CRPG with sandbox elements.

The plot is straight forward. On the surface there is the empire, ruled by the mad king hawthorn, a cruel dictator who rules with an iron fist. Those who go against the empire, or simply earn the ire of anyone in government, are tossed through a portal and left to die on the other side. The portal transports anyone who goes through it down to the depths of the planet, to a massive cave system with no hope of escape. So many people have been sent down there that they have begun to form their own nations as well, but, just because they are able to band together doesn't mean they are safe from the horrors that live down there with them. Your task as the newest exiles? Survive. Survive and do what you can for yourself, and for the underground nations.

Gameplay is easy to understand. Everything is done on a square grid, from exploring the overworld to navigating in combat. Each character has four core stats, followed by talents, then perks. Each core stat effects an aspect of your characters growth. Strength determines how hard you hit with melee weapons and your characters carrying capacity, dexterity determines how likely you are to dodge attacks and how accurate you are with weapons as well as how much damage you deal with ranged weapons, endurance determines how resistant you are to certain status effects and how much health you have, and finally, intelligence determines how much mana you have, how powerful your spells are, and how resistant you are to magic.

Every character has access to the exact same talent tree, allowing them to mix and match what skills they have to create whatever kind of character you want. Most of these talents are passive, but others grant active abilities which are worth investing into. You can put ten points into most talents, at which point you can't dump any more in, which is probably for the best considering at ten points in any skill, the bonuses are astounding. This really gives you the ability to build your own character however you want, from a long range crit machine, to a tank who casts spells.

Then there are the perks, which give minor buffs to certain things, but can also have a pretty big impact on your character depending on which ones you pick. If you use summons alot, you can get a perk that makes them stronger, or if you want to cast more elemental spells, get the perk which makes them work as if they were a level higher.

Combat works in terms of inititive, with the unit with the highest moving first, then the second highest going second and so on. Every unit has a set amount of time units to use during their turn, some actions costing more points than others. It might take one unit to move a single space, but ten to take an attack. You need to carefully position your characters and plan out what abilites your going to use on the many enemies you will encounter throughout your quests. 

Speaking of quests, you will encounter many on your travels, most of which are very fun. Granted, they can be as simple as ""clear out the fort"" or ""bring me five bear asses"", but few of the quests are exactly the same, and alot of them are actual, lengthy detours from the main quest lines. This really does help make the world feel that much more alive, which brings me to my next point.

Avernum is a rather bland game visually. There are a few interesting things to look at here and there, but for the most part, you are inside a huge cave, with fungus growing around you. Thankfully, you start the game off with a world map, and they went out of their way to design the terrain so that its destinctive enough to be able to navigate based on land marks, like a river or an odd rock formation. While every dungeon uses alot of the same textures (in fact, most of the game does), each one is very different, This is because they designed them in very different layouts, with a wide enough variety of enemies to keep things interesting. The game has no music though, or voice acting, so bring your own music.

With all this said, Avernum was an enjoyable experience for me, the only frustration i got was when i entered areas clearly too high a level for me or i missed that one hidden switch in the wall. The game does a great job of emulating the feeling of a Pen and Paper RPG, even allowing for player choice and, suprisingly, stupidity. It lets you ask really stupid questions, and the answers you'll normally get back can be equally as funny. I suppose thats what this game has, charm. While it isn't unique in terms of setting or has an overly deep, introspective, thought provoking plot. It does have alot of charm, a very well built combat system, a depressing, but hopeful and great plot, and a world that really inspires the desire to explore. The only limits are the walls of the cave. 

I would recommend this rpg to anyone who is a fan of old school rpgs, as well as people who enjoy newer things as well, as it has lots of familiar elements, while casting off some of the shackles older games have. If you are a fan of dungeons and dragons, or pathfinder, this is definitely an rpg you will enjoy, and possibly get some new ideas from.",1479694120,1479694120,True,9,0,0.62765955924987793,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Что понравилось:
- интересный мир с интересными персонажами. Авернум это такая тюрьма ссылка, соответственно люди сюда попадают с разными прошлым.
- хороший дизайн локаций. Я имею ввиду расстановки врагов и предметов. Любопытный всегда найдет себе награду если пробежится по всяким закоулкам.
- интересная карта мира. Тоже со всякими закоулками и неожиданными местами. Хорошо чувствуется ощущение от исследования этого нового мира.
- есть версия для планшета. Управление чуть менее удобнее чем на мышке, но зато можно играть лёжа на диване.

Что так-себе:
- бои. Они в общем-то не плохие, но под конец надоедают. Это скорее минус для второй части, как я понял там боевка точно такая же, а играть в неё я больше не хочу.
- по большей части сюжет линеен. То есть исследовать мир можно не линейно, но развилок в сюжете не предпологается.
- квесты решаются одним способом. Количество реплик в диалоге не меняется от интелекта или красноречия.

Avernum: Escape From the Pit is the reboot of the Avernum series and it does a great job at that.

While the game isn't anything heavy on graphics, it still brings updated looks in comparison to the original Avernum games, along with other updates, while at the same time maintaining the core mechanics from the original, which work just as great as they did before.

People who enjoy oldschool RPG games and/or games that rely heavily on story and tactical combat will most probably enjoy these games. And even people who like RPG games but aren't too used to these oldschool ones can still pick it up and enjoy it, as the mechanics aren't anything overly complex to learn.

You build your party the way you want (or skip it altogether and use the default party). When making your party, you can either use pre-set character archetypes (Soldier, Sorcerer, etc) or just customize each character the way you want, picking their stats and skills.

The game has an interesting story, even if it's not anything mindblowing, and there's a lot of exploration and side-quests involved, including finding secrets. It's easy to accumulate many hours within the game (I should say, considering I have 91 hours in the game and I only finished it once).

I think my only actual complaint with the game is the limit on summons - each character can only have one summon active, regardless of whether you use magic or items to summon a creature and summoned creatures themselves aren't too strong, save for the very best summon which can be decently useful. So if you want to make a character focused on summoning, he/she probably won't be very effective. It would have been a lot more interesting to be able to summon multiple creatures, maybe one strong summon along with a few weaker ones. (and I know it's possible - this has been done in other Spiderweb Software games)

Вообще я очень позитивно отношусь к независимым разработчикам и не считаю, что простая графика портит игру. Но тут как-то у меня энтузиазма не хватило. Дело даже не в самой графике - она вполне нормальная и не раздражает - а в управлении и такой штуке, которая называется дружественный интерфейс. Тут реально создается ощущение, что игра сделана на коленке. Хотя она сильно не первая в послужном списке разработчика.

Удивительное.
Так вышло, что я сам имею отношение к разработке ПО и в том числе удобству интерфейса. И местами у меня кровавые слезы наворачивались. То, что у навыков героев нет простой активной панели и все особые атаки и заклинания вызываются кликом из специального окошка, - это полбеды. Но то, что кнопок и окошек три по числу классов героев (воины, маги, священники), - это уже за гранью добра и зла. Как отменить такую атаку, тоже понимаешь не сразу. Разработчики указывают в консольной строке (!) ряд подсказок по этому поводу, но почему нельзя вместо этого пользоваться стандартными приемами вроде правой кнопки мыши? Инвентарь рассматривается буквально с лупой, а трофеи после боя не подсвечиваются и не собираются руками напрямую. Нужно нажать специальную кнопку и перейти к окну трофеев. Зато все довольно подробно изображается на самой карте, где эффектино сливается с фоном. Так идешь-идешь, вдруг случайно клацнул кнопку трофеев, и выясняется, что рядом валяются то ли монеты, то ли камни, то ли что-то еще. Герои всегда ходят гуськом, а переход из режима боя в мирный (тоже отдельная кнопка!) забрасывает их в другой кусок карты и часто - в новый бой. Блин, да я по этой игре могу лекции читать. Как нельзя делать игровой интерфейс.

Плюсы.
- У самого движка большой потенциал, на его основе на самом деле можно клепать недорогие независимые игры.
- Интересно само решение по миру и локациям, перекливающееся с картой Fallout, только более продуманное.

Минусы.
- Линейная прокачка из разряда +3% к урону, +5% к заклинаниям.
- Просто адовые саунд-эффекты. То чувство, будто авторы игры записывали все прямо в своем офисе с диктофоном.
- Много-много мелкого текста, в котором не расставлены никакие акценты. В итоге все диалоги скроллишь и лезешь потом в журнал, чтобы понять, на что же ты все-таки подписался.
- Низкая варибельность как навыков, так и игровых классов, я конечно играл немного, но персонажи сражаются практически одинаково.
- Блеклые цвета всего вокруг; понятно, что пещеры - не тропический остров, и спасибо, что хоть освещение есть, но не может же быть одинаково вообще везде.
- Открытый мир хорош, когда он достаточно наполнен - этот пустой, я бы хотя бы какие-то динамические события добавил.

В общем, у данного сочетания движка, механики и графики очень крутой потенциал, но пренебрежение к самым примитивным законам жанра и работы с интерфейсом все губит.",1475345346,1475345346,False,22,0,0.575315892696380615,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Everything in the game is mechanically sound and allows for ample strategy. You should absolutely buy it and support a great indie developer.

The only thing I would comment on is the writing. A lot of people have gushed over the writing saying it's wonderful. Well, it [i]is[/i] good, but have the right expectations: the writing is less the next Lord of the Rings in video game form and more having the best DM you could possibly imagine creating adventures for you.

Definitely should get this game!

EDIT: So I wanted to just add a final thought to my review. after putting almost 30 hours into the game, I've pretty much abandoned it. After thinking about it, I've realized the game lacks player agency. This means that there are no real choices in the game - there are dozens of quests to partake in, but there is no consequence if you don't do them. They are also almost all linear. The greatest choice present in most of them is whether you [i]actually[/i] give a discovered quest item to the patron the commissioned the quest. Again, if you don't, the only consequence is not receiving the quest reward (which may or may not be better than the legendary item you're handing over). 

Games can overcome this if they have an immersive narrative or compelling aethetics and atmosphere. Unfortunately, this game lacks both. The narrative is ok and the world is unique, but it isn't enough to keep me going after 2 dozen hours. 

Now, some of Spiderweb's other offerings do give the player more agency. So again, I recommend the game, it's fun, but I just thought some may want to know.",1472410742,1475973629,True,1,0,0.517331302165985107,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I felt like reliving games I liked in the early 90s. Games like The Magic Candle and old SSI and Ultima games.
Spider Web games taps into this nostalgia. They've released over a dozen isometric rpgs that offer hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay. 

I've put in 30+ hours into this title alone, one of 7 full titles in Avernum (I think), and that's not counting the Abadon games that take place in the same world. I'm estimating I'm about 25-30% into the game, though there are 3 completely different ways to win, so I really have no idea. The map is truly massive.

A couple huge issues: The clumsy pathfinding will drive you nuts. Characters often take the long way around to a place with a misclick, ruining a battle and forcing you to restart.  The boat pathfinding is ridiculously awful. If you are patient enough to get accustomed to these old school mechanics, you'll be fine. Save. A. Lot.

The world is dangerous. Don't expect clearcut level caps between regions, though the game is designed for widening challenges the further you venture. Money is hard to earn, and you get a real sense of accomplishment when you get a nice weapon or learn a new spell. While the starting area around Formello is relatively safe, the rest of the world is not. If it's a rich, nostalgic, challenging world you're looking for, get these. Can't be beat for the price either.

As Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw once said there are two types of games. Games I've stopped playing because I'm approaching a state of boredom akin to rigor mortis and games I've stopped playing because I just realized I should have had dinner two hours ago. This one is officially the latter.

Don't let the 'this thing was cutting edge when the SNES was still big news' appearance scare you off. If you let yourself get drawn into it you'll find a surprisingly deep game with some really well-written dialogue, funny characters, some genuine excitement, and loads of exploration. I honestly laughed out loud when I found the Spider village, where all the sentient spiders live who are very friendly, talk like small children, and are all named Spider. It was both cute and pretty damn weird.

So yes, if you an old RPG fan like me this game is definitely worth a look, as are Spiderweb's other titles. Sadly Geneforge seems to cock up on my computer, probably Windows 10, but the Avernum games are top notch for those who want something that feels more like a classic game or whose computers can't handle big stodgy titles like Fallout 4.

The game is far butchered now compared to it's older version. 

Before: Up to three levels of spells in both priest and mage classes so that you can indulge in a magic fantasy playing the game. With secrets at every turn for your wizard to decode and dangerous territory where they have to show their wit in using their magic to upgrade their arsenal and using it creatively to beat the lords of magic themselves, the slitheraki or however you spell that...

Now: Even with three levels of spells you are limited to 5 spells either mage or priest. Mages might as well be replaced with archers until you find a spell that can hit more than one target. Priests are nice for minor heal but cannot bless the party for a long time. 

Now:
Speaking of buying, selling and upgrades... nothing you get from battles is worth anything... There are times that have values that shops will not take anywhere. Items worth 240 suddenly worth 6 in a shop...

Before:
Things costed alot but you could sell items during battle, find money and not [5 coins] per 3 mobs or even find loot that is an upgrade to what you had without going into their preset dungeons. 

Before:
A game about survival where your party had to eat in order to sustain themselves so sleeping outdoors while sometimes bad was a way of hunting AND healing your party. If you didn't play this well, you'd end up with having to remake characters you put time into because they died. [Unless you found/decoded a high level revive spell]

Now:
The revive spell is in the game but... what's the point!? You can walk into town and get free heals. ""Survival"" You don't need to eat anything. The food items aren't even worth picking up, they heal you for garbage amounts. Speaking of which rather than enriching their item pool and allowing you to diversify how you play, they've just created more garbage for you to pick up. 

Before:
The game was hard but you could select information out of conversations you had with people in order to find interesting things to do and tidbits of information. The quests that you took up on your own accord were the experience to level up your party and when you came back to claim the gold reward after barely surviving that was the icing on the cake.

Now:
THe quests give experience because the mobs sure don't give enough. You are forced into conversations where you have pre-established answers which sound nothing like what you'd even ask about in a conversation to the point where it makes you seem really naive or stupid. Hell half of the information you can ignore and walk into who needs conversations anyway. Also they'll mark it on the map for ya, no need to explore or be a cartographer. 

Before: 
Having useful skills in and out of combat was possible and while not needed sometimes made the return to civilization what little you got pretty fun.

Now:
Some things are taken out because during a level up you really don't get all that much to train yourself. It's probably due to the fact that the items and money drops from mobs are garbage because in the old Exile you had to not only have leveled up to train and allot points, you also had to pay for the training. Now you somehow train yourself cuz you know everything you just don't have ""EXP"" and only casters suffer the need of learning from someone else.

Before:
Armor reduced damage, better armor reduced it better. These were flat amounts. You still needed hp, magic doesn't care about your armor and the strongest foes can use magic that you like to use all the time!

Now: 
Enemies don't need to use magic to overwhelm you because armor only increases the damage you reduce by a percentage. So rather than buying something nice to actually protect yourself it's more like you will always take damage from a foe but can lower it somewhat. Mind you that healing in battle either cost money [which you won't have] via potions or mana [which cannot be healed outdoors or in dungeons even by waiting in safe areas that you've explored and mapped like a smart survivor.] 

Exile used to be a brutal game where you felt like you were thrown down the pit and each battle brought you closer to your goal of getting out. This version either you play at a low difficulty and give yourself a yawn fest or you play at a high difficulty and wonder why you play. This isn't one of those ""Strategizing rpgs"" at that point, it becomes a luck and trial game because the game cannot sustain itself. I did play it on the strongest difficulty but that's because I played it before expecting the same fun gameplay with a tough twist. Instead the gameplay is boring and now feels like a rip off of newer games. [Questing for exp, dumbed down,  does not self sustain, barely on topic, pompous pretending to make something hard with modes when it's just a percentage modifier to things that are there already... Give me back Exile. I am glad I only bought Avernum for 3 bucks but it really wasn't worth that either!]

Absolute must buy when the avernum set is on sale

Graphics 7/10 lets just be real youre not buying this game for the graphics. They are very simple but get the job done.

Story 9/10 You quickly realize that this game has huge depth. There are so many locations and areas way across the map that tie into each other.

Battle System 9/10 The battle system is actually pretty simple but is very addicting and requires some decent strategy for harder battles. Only real complaint is that sometimes it is a pain in the ass to select a gride close to enemies if that enemy in question is larger and blocks that grid.

Leveling and skill tree 8/10 The leveling and skills system is pretty basic but has just enough depth to allow some pretty decent character development. The system uses a 3 pronged system which isnt too bad. Provided me with some interesting character combos that i liked.

Very well balanced with a good progressing curve
The lore is great and made me want to know all there is to know about Avernum
The battles ARE epic (you just need to put a epic music to go with it and to be able to use your imagination)

Now just to warn about what this game don't have:
No real player characteres development: no background, no personnality, no interraction between your four characters
No stealth system (but better to have none than one useless or broken), this is not something missing really, I just wanted to have a backstabing silent assasin in my team when I started the game.
No real replay value, there is very few alternative path, their is also probably only one good way to set up your team. (One play through took me 80hours so who care?)
Sometime during fight, you will struggle to place your character where you want. And sometime the pathfinding will play againts you.

Overall I highly recommand this game only for smart people... you are? right!

Avernum: Escape from the Pit is better than the original Avernum 1 in some ways, and worse in others.  I was disappointed that it wasn't much of an upgrade.  The engine is practically identical, so it just felt like I was replaying Avernum 1 with a couple of usability mods tacked on.  Fortunately, Avernum 1 was an amazing game, so I had almost as much fun replaying it as I did playing it for the first time.  I loved the story, I loved the length, and I loved the challenging turn-based tactical combat which rewards good planning and equipment choice as well as good combat decisions.

Long-time fans of the series will know that there are three versions of this game.  The first, Exile 1, is a non-isometric overhead 2D tactical RPG.  Very fun, but the Avernum remake blew it out of the water.  This remake of Avernum just adds a few ""enhancements,"" some of them desirable and some not.

BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL AVERNUM:
Notable locations in towns and dungeons (shops, important NPCs, spellbooks you may want to return to a second time, etc.) are now marked on your map, which helps decrease the copious note-taking this game requires.  Note that you will still have to have some paper beside you (or a text file ready to alt-tab to), to record many places you will want to return to later, or quest details that aren't automatically added to your quest journal.

There are some additional areas to flesh out the game world, and some additional fun dungeons.

Hidden areas now have a visual cue, obviating the need to tediously bump your character against the sides of the maps to find them.

WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL AVERNUM:
The skill and perk system has been overhauled to make it less likely you will unintentionally create a weak character.  I consider this undesirable both because the players who actually need such a feature aren't a good match for a game like this and because much of the fun, flexibility, and personality of the original system has been lost.  Furthermore, I believe that the ""problem"" being addressed is already covered by the fact that the difficulty can be changed at any time.

Some of the content additions to this version of the game kill the mystery and thrill of the original game.  I can't be more specific without spoiling it for you, but things you really aren't meant to see until you are well into the game, in my opinion, are now accessible to you early on.

The World Map now autoscrolls instead of letting you explore it one screen at a time, making it both easier to miss things and more annoying to track what you have already explored and what you have left to explore.

Also, I can't remember if this was in the original version or not, but there is a ""soft"" level cap at 30, after which you only get a chance to allocate level-up points every five levels (which means level 35, really, since you will probably finish the game before level 40).  Worse, there is NO warning about this!  This can really screw up some of your planning, as many skills require a certain level before the ability you want is available to you.  Of course, this downside won't apply to you, because I just warned you. ;)

THE VERDICT:
Both versions of this game are amazing, so there's no question about my recommending it or not.  So which version should you play?

If you are a more casual player, worried about making mistakes with your character creation and upon leveling up, get this version.  And if you are not interested in challenging combat, you can also put the difficulty on ""Normal"" or ""Casual,"" and just enjoy the story.  If you have trouble finding the original and/or getting it to run on your modern computer, you can settle for this version as well--it's not significantly worse.

If you are a player who cut your teeth on old CRPGs in the 80s and 90s, or if you don't mind dealing with retro conventions, go for the original.  Much of the content you are giving up is not necessarily an improvement to the overall package, and character creation and growth is a LOT more fun.  Just be prepared to take lots of additional notes on the locations of shops and important NPCs in towns.",1455150933,1455932959,True,2,0,0.526165783405303955,0,False,False,False,False,,,

    杀怪和做任务可以获得经验（废话……），经验攒够了就可以升级（又TM废话……），升级可以获得一些属性点、技能点和天赋点可以自由分配。一些技能、法术，需要一定的技能点数才可以使用，所以正常来讲魔武双修是不可能的。当然，玩家也可以打开游戏自带的修改器，把所有属性技能都点满。这样做虽说会使游戏的战斗部分变得非常简单(随便放个AOE法术，敌人就死光了)，但是不会对剧情体验有太大影响，而且可以大大缩短通关所需的时间。孰优孰劣就由玩家们自己把握了。

    关于Avernum，这个词在现实中是一个火山口的名字。由于这个火山口深不可测，所以Avernum被当地人看作是地狱的入口。在国内，这个游戏也被翻译做《阿佛纳姆：陷阱逃生》。其实，Avernum是一个系列，这款《Avernum Escape from the Pit》是原作《Avernum 1》的重制版，《Avernum 2》的重制版《Avernum 2 Crystal Soul》现在也已经在Steam上发售。原作一共6部，即Avernum 1 - 6。现在Steam上可以买到的原作只有《Avernum 4》《Avernum 5》和《Avernum 6》，估计不久的将来《Avernum 3》的重制版也会进入Steam市场。

看到这里，如果你对我以上说的内容一点都不感冒的话，那这个游戏可能并不适合你。下面我聊一聊剧情和体验，内容将有轻微的剧透。(商店页面的评测似乎有行数限制，点击这篇评测上边大拇指图标旁边的“推荐”可以看到完整内容)
[code]
（剧透程度：游戏开始半小时内的剧情）
[spoiler]   你被帝国以莫须有的罪名驱逐，被押送到一个被成为Avernum的地方的传送门前。所有被帝国驱逐的人都回被迫走进这扇传送门进入Avernum，并且从未听说有人从Avernum或者回来。沐浴过人生的最后一道阳光后，你被推进了这个传送门，进入Avernum的世界。
  传送结束，你的眼睛还不能适应这里的黑暗，耳边环绕着深邃洞穴特有的风声和水声。逐渐适应这不见天日的环境后，你开始举步前行。还能不能再回到地面呢？你不断地思考着。看到地面上有一件破烂的披风，你忽然感觉到寒冷已经开始侵蚀你的身体，于是把它披在身上(这里其实是装备使用教程-_-||)。也许是以前的人留下的吧，不管了，这里是否有人还活着还不知道呢……
  不一会儿，你看到前边有一个篝火，篝火旁围着几只Nephilim。这只是一种普通的怪物，地面上也存在，只是被帝国不断的猎杀而已。不用多说，掏出身上仅有的匕首开战吧(这里是战斗教程O_O)。敌人很脆弱，战斗很快就结束了。你翻查了一下他们的营地，捡到一些破烂的装备。有总比没有好，还是带上吧。
  你沿着洞穴继续前进，路上干掉几只挡路的老鼠，最终来到一个湖边。在湖的对岸，你看到了Avernum中的第一个活着的人类。看来已经有人在Avernum成功地生存了下来。那个人自称为Lagran，脸色惨白，似乎来到Avernum已经有一段时间了。闲聊几句后，他向你展示他脖子上的钥匙。离开这个洞穴的门，已经被他锁上了。看来这个人似乎不怀好意。说完几句挑衅的话语，他自己就走开了。
  继续前行，你看到一个破烂的房子，应该是Avernum人建造的吧。房子里聚集着一些人：几个似乎收到惊吓，躲在墙角说不出话的人，和一个正在安抚他们的医生。医生告诉你，他们还不能接受自己被放逐的现实，现在什么都做不了。而那个Lagran，带领着一帮土匪，堵住了离开这个洞穴的道路。
  没有别的选择，只能战斗了。医生为你治疗的先前战斗留下的伤口，并送给你几瓶治疗药水。带着这些，已经地上捡来的一些装备，你开始向那帮土匪进军(接下来是第一场Boss战，系统也会建议你先存档-_-||)。经过激烈的战斗，你终于站到Lagran面前。Lagran显然不愿投降。又是一番打斗，Lagran的手下已经被我们尽数击倒，他自己也受了一些伤。突然，Lagran开始逃跑。他施放了一个不知名的法术让你无法追击，打开身后的铁门逃离了这个洞穴……这算是胜利了吧，离开Avernum的出口已经畅通。你迫不及待地跑回去通知医生，然后一行人一同向洞穴的出口走去(然后医生，而且是个妹子，就消失了……)。
  刚走过那个洞穴出口，周围一片明亮，明亮到眼睛再次无法适应。难道已经回到地面了吗？慢慢睁开眼睛，你看到的是更加巨大的洞窟，和火把的光亮。眼前逐渐明晰了，你发现你现在身处一个城堡之中，周围的守卫都已经用弓箭对准了你……还有更多的土匪？拔剑吧！就在此时，一个矮小的人从远处跑来，高喊着“住手！不要攻击！”。这个人做了一番自我介绍：他名字叫做Andrew，职业就是负责迎接刚刚进入Avernum的新人。
  和Avernum堡的居民们交谈，你开始逐渐认识这个世界。这里的人们依靠不需要阳光即可生长的菌类植物生存。Avernum也有城镇和乡村，也有国王和军队。来到Avernum，相当于是获得了一次重生的机会。只要能够找到适合自己的工作，你就可以在Avernum的世界生活下去。至于回到地面，大家都劝你放弃这个念想……难道真的没有希望了么？[/spoiler]

Where do I start? I probably wasn't even 5 when Spiderweb Software came out with games but somehow they managed to reach our old Mac. Needless to say the original game was unplayable with the skill and attention span a child might have between the ages of 5 to 10 but something about the original Exile games managed to stick with my older brother who's 4 years older than me. He's followed Spiderweb's releases and remakes of Exile religiously ever since, so naturally he was ecstatic to see me checking out this remake on Steam. Having never touched the games aside from making a party, getting lost at the starting point and giving up, what did I think of this incarnation of a classic?

The first thing that's clear is how streamlined the interface has become, I believe Jeff has been working on making all the Avernum games run on the same engine to get them all consistant. It was a lot easier to maneuver through making a party and looking at all the spells/abilities... which used to have a lot more of to the point of insanity. Luckily, the spells that have been removed were either combined with other spells or removed because they really weren't necessary.

Questing and leveling is also pretty straightforward. Conversing with NPCs used to require you entering actually words yourself to get answers and information, now it's more standard with a choice of questions or answers to get what you want. The world itself feels large and lively with a map that you will be using a lot. There's a lot of choice in how your party gets shaped and your actions in questlines affect what happens at the end of the game for at least 3 types of endings.

There's no music in this game but the ambience and sound effects make up for that. If it gets too quiet for your liking you can run some of your own music to fit the mood, classical music was my choice and it fit surprisingly well. :) The graphics are also pretty simple but detailed enough to tell what's going on. Spell effects are different for each spell so you know what you just fired is indeed a fireball and blizzards are made of ice.

Combat is done in turns and has each character in the battle using action points. Using all your action points ends that character's turn while saving action points smartly allows you to attack or move multiple times. There's various skills and spell effects, defending, mana conservation and looting to take into account in every battle so there's some pretty large amounts of strategy to this game. Running in blind is a very bad idea and you should save often however...even on easy you can get ambushed and overwhelmed whether it's a fort, dungeon or out in the open-world... some of the enemies run faster than you also btw. :P

The most unique thing about Avernum (and most of Spiderweb's other games) is the writing and sometimes bizarre humor. It's charming and sometimes unnecessarily descriptive about some items or people in the world of Avernum... it's also a legacy to Jeff's imagination all those years ago, he's admitted while updating these games that even he thinks he was crazy when writing them and he'll never be able to create something like them ever again.

While admitting I am influenced a bit by the nostalgia, I think there's plenty for a new player to enjoy in Avernum if RPGs are their favorite pastime. There's a plethora of guides covering all sorts of playthroughs and party builds. This game was also a decent challenge on the lowest difficulty setting and it goes up to nightmare. The community on Steam and the official Spiderweb website is friendly, helpful and pretty enthusiastic about new people getting into the games AND in case you still aren't sure about the games, Spiderweb offers a free demo which you can upgrade to the full game without having to start a new game. :)

Quant aux autres, amateurs sans préjugés ou nostalgiques du old game, je crois qu'ils trouveront ici leur bonheur. La réalisation est soignée, l'histoire riche en branches narratives, en anecdotes et, surtout, en donjons de tous types.

Les  cartes de chaque donjon sont plus petites que celle d'Avadon mais il est plus facile de se promener dans le monde d'Avernum que dans celui de son cousin. Une carte globale permet même à votre équipe de se déplacer à sa guise et de choisir les donjons à jouer dans l'ordre qui vous sied, ce qui n'est pas le cas dans Avadon où la carte globale est ionnaccessible et l'ordre de jeu assez rigide. Ce détail suffit à rendre le jeu bien plus fluide et plaisant. Il y a aussi plein de ""micro donjons"" jouables en un seul combat de rencontre,qui permettent à la fois de collecter quelques XP et se préciser l'ambiance de la région. 

Quant au reste, il me semble que le moteur de jeu est classique mais efficace. Le jeu est plus difficile qu'Avadon tout en restant accessible aux débutants avec son niveau ""Facile"" (mais pas tant que ça... ^^) La variété des sorts et aptitudes, couplée à la grande souplesse pour l'évolution de vos personnages (aucune classe n'est ""fermée"" : même un combattant peut apprendre des sorts si vous le souhaitez) rend le gameplay très plaisant. Il est possible de tester toutes sortes de combinaisons de builds et de personnages si l'on souhaite varier les plaisirs, à condition évidemment d'avoir le temps de boucler une campagne qui s'annonce assez longue (en 30h, je pense en être au tiers environ). 

Bref : si les graphismes 3d et les effets spéciaux vous intéressent moins que la profondeur de jeu et l'ambiance du roleplay, Avernum est fait pour vous. Pour ma part, bien que les JdR ne soient - et de loin - pas mon style préféré, je me suis attaché à celui-ci dont je compte bien continuer à explorer les richesses.",1451411257,1451411257,True,5,0,0.566012084484100342,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's goold old turn-based combat, tons of secrets and a lot of world map exploration with special events.

-Easy to learn combat that still manages to heavily rely on tactical gameplay
-Enough of a story line to keep you interested
-Many many many hours of gameplay if you search out side content (I'm guessing I'm not even half way through the game yet at 41 hours)
-Noticeable area difficulty - stray too far too soon and you're sure to get burned to a crisp
-Skill customization - you can level whatever skills you like, as long as you've unlocked the prerequesite
-Working control scheme that hasn't been brutalized in favor of controller support (as is the fad nowadays)

Meh:
-Character customization is pretty simplistic.  Choose from a handful of stock avatars.  Doesn't detract from the game, but doesn't stand out either.
-Graphics - Same as the character customization, the graphics work, but feel rather dated.  At times, the art gives me the distinct feel of a late 90's PC RPG.

Cons:
-At times, it can be easy to get lost when looking for new locations, even with the help of a questline.  While this can sometimes lead to good things, like finding secret areas, more often than not it has caused me to wander into areas above my level, causing me to die or run away screaming.  This is subjective of course, as I may also have poor sense of direction lol.
-When learning to play the game, you really need to pay attention to what strategies work in combat, or you'll find yourself in frustrating situations.  In the beginning, almost any strategy works, misleading you into thinking your current strategies are good enough.  In reality, I found myself being forced to reroll a new game a couple times just to try some different approaches to combat.  New starting skills to aid in my survivability and varying methods of damage output, to fight tough enemies like mages that like to disable half (or more) of your team in a single shot.
(Honestly, I'm not sure if this is a Con or a Pro, as it really makes you think and adds to the strategy any RPG.  But it can be frustrating all the same, having to restart because your current builds can't counter something.  Casual gamers and those new to this type of game, may have trouble with this.)

Awesome game.  Plays a lot like older and newer turn based RPGs, like Divinity:OS or perhaps Fallout Tactics:BoS.  Sure to be enjoyed by anyone that's a fan of turnbased isometric RPGs.",1451253930,1451253930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you want a shorter version here it is (if you want an in-depth review, click on the Blogspot link found on the bottom of the article to navigate to my site): 

Is Avernum: Escape from the Pit worth its 10-dollar price tag?  At more than 90 hours of gaming on my first playthrough across a vast 2D, isometric, nostalgia-inducing landscape filled with interesting locations peppered with lairs, strongholds, and powerful artifacts that only the most intrepid will discover, Avernum: Escape from the Pit is definitely worth its price of admission. Add to this almost peerless writing and it’s easy to see why I’m regarding this game as one of the best in my collection. 

Ratings: 

Tilt: 8.5 – Given that I’ve spent almost 92 hours in this game and finished it, I can say Avernum: Escape from the Pit is something else. I’ve spent several sleepless nights over this one, only quitting when I realized the sun was starting to rise. Spiderweb Software has some topnotch writers. 

Gameplay: 8.0 – If you’re talking about pure gameplay alone, Avernum suffers from some design choices like making you too powerful near the end of the game and other foibles like recycled sprites and unclickable tiles. Still it does provide a fun romp that even shines head and shoulders from some games that have triple A funding.

Graphics: 6.0 – It’s here that Avernum really suffers. With only a 2D isometric engine, the game really can’t hope to match more recent RPGs like say, The Age of Decadence. Its art style, while very good, is nothing to write home about either; it just doesn’t have anything that makes it stand out from the multitude of RPGs out there in the visuals department.

Audio: 7.5 – Adequate but again, there’s nothing that makes it stand out. If only they made background music as impressive as the one used when the main menu fires up though…

Replayability: 8.5 – This is a pretty divisive point. On one, retro gamers will love replaying this game that lets you relive the good ‘ol days of the 90s. On the other side of the coin, younger gamers may be put off by its visuals and despite its multiple endings, may consider this game a one-shot affair. There’s also the matter of its length: gamers who love protracted adventures blasting hordes of undead and fantastical creatures will find this game up their alley while ones who are easily distracted by new releases might find this one to be a stubborn guest that overstays its welcome. I’m somewhere in the middle but I’m definitely going to unravel its other endings so I’m giving this an 8.5. 

Score: 7.7

In Avernum: Escape From the Pit bewegt man sich mit seiner Gruppe aus 4 Abenteurer frei durch eine riesige unterirdische Dungeon-Welt. Dort versuchen ausgestoßene Menschen eine Art Zivilisation zu erhalten und sich gegen den Mangel an Licht, Materilal, Nahrung, fiese Monster und feindliche Wesen etc. zu behaupten.
Hier zieht man also herum, sammelt Erfahrung, erledigt Quests und such Schätze etc...

Sehr sympathisch finde ich die Einfachheit des Spiels. Dialoge sind sparsam gehalten und in Form von kurzen, teils witzigen Texten, umgesetzt. Die Persönlichkeit der Charaktere beschränkt sich im Wesentlichen auf deren Aussehen und Fähigkeiten. Quests sind sehr unaufdrinlich, man verfolgt keine Kompassnadeln sondern streunt eher durch die Gegend und schaut mal was passiert. Ob ein Gegner zu hart ist, merkt man erst wenn die Gruppe tot ist. Dann merkt man sich den Schauplatz eben für später, wenn man stärker ist. Kurz: es wird dem Spieler nicht alles vorgekaut ;)
Graphik und Ton sind sehr minimalistisch, aber wer sich daran nicht stört, für ist Avernum: Escape From the Pit ein lohnender Kauf. Vor allem bei dem Preis.

There is probably more storyline in this small download than in the entire Skyrim. There are many long hours of play ahead. I did a restart about 2/3 of the way through as my party was not strong enough and I had not distributed t6he party stats well, combined I have nearly spent as many hours now on this game as I did with DragonAge inquisition.
Despite the old school graphics there is quite variety of terrain to explore.

The character development is good and straddles the boundary between too simple or too complex well. I suggest you pay attention to creating a balanced party, which is also an area that I feel could be improved. It is too easy to create parties that will simply not work. Having a bow user sounds great, but the game is heavily weighted to swords.
Another area which could be improved is the character conversation scripts. Old storylines do not disappear and too often you get into a dialogue that you have already been through a million times before with the NPC – it is almost as if the same people that wrote the  NPC scripting for Divinity Original Sin did this one too.

The game has been streamlined, interface made usable, and the graphics have improved (relatively speaking) since then, but much of the core draw (and mechanics) are still there.

If you're someone who enjoys having wide open spaces, no demand to go down any particular linear plotline, and plenty of rewards for kicking over ever rock to see what wriggles out from underneath, this game has plenty of delicious exploratory goodness for you.

That said, I'm not as fond of the skill trees they've put in the new version of the game as the older point-buy system they had before. The point-buy system hypothetically allows for nigh-infinite varieties of hybrid characters, but largely forces characters into one of four types of characters: Melee Fighter, Ranged Fighter, Wizard, and Cleric. ""Thief"" is just someone who puts points into Tool Use, and you need Tool Use (there's no magic for opening doors without it) but there's nothing stopping any other sort of character from taking Tool Use, and the game only checks total party Tool Use skill levels, so it's easy to distribute. (No dedicated thief necessary.) You COULD use a ranged fighter, but melee combat is forced upon you fairly often, and you'll want a dedicated sword user and spear user to make use of the best weapons, anyway. 

You're forced into making a character dedicate themselves to a given path by the nature of the skill tree: The high-tier skills like Riposte (counter attack chance) or Lethal Blow (critical hit power up) require plugging an equal or greater amount of points into the lower skills on the tree. Your Combat Disciplines (special abilities for fighters) are based upon total base weapons skill, and you'll want to put your attribute points into Strength or maybe Dexterity. Keeping up with magic spell tiers demands you stick points into a single base magic skill at least every other level, and dumping nearly all your points into Intelligence, and a couple into Endurance for the HP to not die in one hit. Hence, no matter what, you pretty much always wind up with sword fighter, spear fighter, cleric, and wizard. Hypothetically, there's bows and thrown weapons, but there are no good bows, and decent thrown weapons are too rare to use as a primary weapon. 

There are some choices to be made (going for criticals versus riposte) but mostly, it devolves into putting all your points into the core sklls because on the harder difficulties, you'll miss every time if you don't plug every point you can into accuracy-boosting skills, and a melee tank needs all the hardiness they can get to survive. Likewise, wizard and cleric accuracy (yes, AoE spells miss) depend upon base magic skill, and base magic skill ALSO ups damage. Hence, there's no reason not to put points in every single level. It's really only a question of whether you need more damage-dealing skills or damage-resistance skills at a given level to survive, espeically on higher difficulties, and the number of utility skills like tool use or cave lore you need is surprisingly low, meaning you basically always put points into the same dedicated ""purist"" build all the time. It leaves one underwhelmed with the potential for customization.

In the original Avernum series, it gave you more points each time you leveled, but the costs of skills rose as you purchased more ranks in those skills, meaning that there was more possibility to ""multi-class"", as a skill you dedicated points into every level would rise as fast as the skill points you gained per level, while skills you neglected would become relatively cheaper by comparison. This meant it was easily possible to make a wizard who studied enough cleric magic to be a passable backup healer and a truly excellent wizard while the cleric was a passable archer. 

Without the chance to really multi-class, you'll probably find that you're left with the same party time and again, as you're probably not going to want to play this game without a cleric or wizard, and you'll NEED a meat shield. Since this is the umpteenth trip to Avernum for some of us, playing the same party with the same character sprites in areas modeled on the same locations can give old hands a bit of deja vu all over again.

It is, yes, possible to play solo, and you'll want to generalize a little more in solo play, but even that kind of comes down to playing a wizard with some melee skill and a few healing spells. 

Also unlike this game's predecessor, this game starts you off in a small dungeon for a minor tutorial on the basics, but quickly lets you roam as a free-range adventuring band. A few easily-dismissed text boxes shouldn't annoy veterans, but might help new players, so it's not a bad change. That said, I suggest new players save frequently, and have several ""safe zone"" saves, as they can easily bumble into more trouble than they can fight their way out of with no guard rails to keep them from merrily adventuring into danger out of their depth. 

All the time and money they saved not going for pretty graphics (and if you're a Spiderweb fan, you'll recognize the reuse of a LOT of those graphics,) was put into making absolutely sprawling caverns. 

For those of you who lamented Elder Scrolls' Oblivion/Skyrim's rubber-banded monster levels, rejoice as well, as the sliths just a few towns west of where you start WILL shishkebob you effortlessly. On the higher difficulty levels, this can curb your exploration somewhat, but with a mere 350 coins, you can buy a boat that lets you have access to a large portion of the map, so long as you don't mind having to hide from the fights. While not being able to fight something sounds limiting, you can gain access to spells early, which makes it worth the trip.

That said, there's still a few places you have to go, and a pretty clear order in which you have to go there. While it's hypothetically possible to do sequence breaks, steep ramping of the power of enemies means that, especially in higher difficulty settings, there's little capacity for a player to bypass one major dungeon and be prepared for the next.

Because you have access to all the spell trainers early (just have to dodge the monsters bigger than you) you can easily get spells meant for late-game early, but at the same time, you can't afford them. Spells cost 2000 coins to learn, and clearing a whole dungeon and selling absolutely everything only nets you 1000 coins... It doesn't really get better as you go on, either, until you've bought all your skill-ups, and then there's nothing left to buy at all. I've never seen a reason to buy potions or scrolls or even weapons, as, while some mid-level stuff is available in stores, by the time you can afford them, you have better artifact weapons you lifted off of corpses. Potions can be brewed from infinitely-respawning herb patches for free, so there's at least reason to use those. 

Also, you ram through MP quickly in this game, especially later on, but just setting foot in town restores all HP and MP for free... You have skills to reduce MP use, but why use them when you need every skill point in magic power to survive a single fight, and can just go back to town for a refill after literally every fight? There are a handful of dungeons where you do have to ""fight your way back out"" (monsters spawn in after you get to the end of the dungeon), but it's rare enough that you shouldn't have trouble sitting on a pile of 30 magic potions to refill between fights if you really need it.

If you're at all interested in the genre, it's dirt cheap and provides easily 100 hours of gameplay.",1445472734,1445472734,True,28,1,0.718115389347076416,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In gewisser Weise ist Avernum ein Dungeon Crawler, allerdings keinesfalls in purer Form. Dazu läuft der Spieler dann doch etwas zu oft durch Städte und redet mit NPCs. Ich nenne es deshalb Dungeon Crawler, weil die Spielwelt an sich ein riesiges Verlies ist, dass sich in viele kleine Dungeon unterteilt.

Du erstellst dir eine eigene Gruppe, bestehend aus vier Mitgliedern (oldschool!) und erledigst allerlei Quests für die anderen Exilanten, die derweil in dieser unterirdischen Welt ihre eigenen Städte und Verbünde gründeten. Die Story ist hierbei aber ohnehin nur Vorwand für das Szenario, welches ganz klar der größere Fokus bei der Entwicklung war.

Das Kampfsystem ist rundenbasierend und erinnert stark an klassische RPGs wie Pool of Radiance. Strategische Tiefe hält sich dabei mit Würfelglück die Waage – soll heißen es gibt eine prozentuale Wahrscheinlichkeit bei der Treffer- und Schadensberechnung, die durch passende Ausrüstung und Stufenanstiege der Charaktere verbessert werden können.

Level-Ups kommen in angemessenem Maße, sie werden dem Spieler nicht nachgeschmissen, sind aber häufig genug, um die Motivation aufrecht zu halten. Der moderate Schwierigkeitsgrad ist ebenfalls ein Pluspunkt in Sachen Motivation. Jede Einstellung des Anspruchs ist direkt spürbar und schlägt sich schlicht in den Werten der Feinde nieder, nicht aber in deren eher zweckmäßiger KI.
Die Monster sind allgemein eher doof und lassen sich mit typischen Taktiken wie Engpässen oder Hit and Run locker überwinden.

Grafik und Sound... sind mit zweckmäßig hingegen noch SEHR wohlwollend beschrieben. Dadurch, dass alles unter Tage spielt, werdet ihr euch mit der Farbe grau anfreunden müssen. Das Design hätte deutlich mehr Farbe vertragen können und die Höhlen-Ausrede lasse ich da nicht durchgehen. Andere Dungeon-Crawler bekommen das schließlich auch hübscher hin. Immerhin gibt’s Lila-Korallenwälder.

Musik existiert außerhalb des Titelbildschirms übrigens nicht. Höchstens mal kleine Jingles. Soundeffekte sind vorhanden. Das ist alles was ich über den Ton sagen kann.

Fazit:

Ich hatte mit Avernum aus zwei Gründen meinen Spaß:

1. Die Spielwelt ist mit seinen vielen Tunneln und unterirdischen Gewässern ein Fest für Entdecker. Die Entwickler haben glücklicherweise dafür gesorgt, dass es auch viel zu entdecken gibt für mutige Wanderer.
2. Ich mag diese Art des Kampfsystems aus der Iso-Perspektive.

The basic story / setting involves an authoritarian government that banishes its malcontents to a massive cave system called Avernum where they are expected to suffer and die rather than sow discord among the surface dwellers.  Enough get banished in this way that, over the decades, a shaky civilization is formed.  Your band of up to four are thrust into this misery where you must learn to survive, and through many increasingly important deeds save Avernum from its many enemies and maybe earn vengeance for yourself & the thousands of other victims of cruel Hawthorne's empire.

This rendition of the first game is a re-re-make of Exile: Escape From The Pit, updated to the geneforge engine I believe, providing more fluid animations, better sprites and a more stable environment for Windows users.

Wow, mir war von vorneherein klar, dass ich wieder in den Genuss eines sehr unterhaltsamen und süchtig machenden Indi-RPG's kommen würde, aber ich hätte nicht damit gerechnet, dass Avernum Avadon noch übertrumpfen würde. Ich war direkt fasziniert als ich feststellte, dass das Spiel eine frei begehbare Weltkarte bietet (ein meines Erachtens stark unterschätztes Feature). Als ich dort dann auf einmal noch Geheimgänge und verbuddelte Schätze entdeckte sowie diverse Events auslöste, wusste ich, dass ich seeehr viel Zeit mit der Erkundung von Avernum verbringen würde. Und ich sollte mich nicht täuschen, dieses Spiel hat mich locker über 100 Stunden bei Laune gehalten. Kaum zu glauben dass es sich gerade mal um den ersten Teil einer sechsteiligen Serie handelt! Rollenspieler die mit der spartanischen Präsentation zurechtkommen sollten unbedingt reinschauen! Das Spiel gibt’s für 10 Euro auf Steam. Wer clever ist wartet natürlich auf einen Deal und bekommt es somit noch günstiger. Wer skeptisch ist schnappt sich die Mammut-Demo auf der Spiderweb-Homepage.


Pro und Kontra:

Pro:
- hervorragend geschriebene Texte, die plastische Beschreibungen liefern und sowohl Story als auch Charaktere einwandfrei darstellen
- auf Wunsch sehr anspruchsvoller Schwierigkeitsgrad
- sehr gutes Raster-basiertes Rundenkampfsystem
- sehr gut umgesetztes Open World-Konzept
- kein Level-Cap wie in den Avadon-Spielen
- sehr lange Spieldauer (ich habe auf hard locker über 100 Stunden investiert)

Kontra:
- audiovisuell extremst spartanisch (wegen des Settings sogar noch eintöniger als die Avadon-Titel)
- visuelle Präsentation so gut wie nicht vorhanden, wer die Bildschirmtexte also nicht lesen will bekommt nichts mit.
- Point & Click-Mechanik in den Rasterfeldkämpfen erfordert zu viel Präzision, das wird in Avadon 2 komfortabler umgesetzt.",1441446212,1628527063,True,2,0,0.553072631359100342,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It's heavily inspirated by old fashioned isometric rpg from the 90's like Ultima , the nostalgia appeal is definitively there . It's a solid crawling RPG with an appealing world (or rather underworld) if you can stomach the primitive graphics and limited storylines.

Gameplaywise Avernum presents us with a good solid and simple fighting system which is quite entertaining and challanging. It's similar to many other similar games but the mechanics work, and it rarely frustrate you depite teh flaws in the GUI or the inperfect pathsystem. The game definitively doesn't hold your hand, and there are areas your party should avoid unntil they've grown in experience and gear as the creatures will crush you mercilessly.

Spiderweb does a good job in presenting us this huge world with unique features and cultures, great atmosphere but ultimately it sometimes feels a little empty and one city look a lot like the others. The game ,with no advanced graphical features to speak of ,tries to impress you with lyric descriptions of the grottos in Avernum, but honestly there are only so many ways to describe the huge , dark and humid  cave where the story takes place, it gets old rather quickly.The quests in this game are rather traditional with the usual fare of defeating bandits\creatures\deamons to save the kingdom

I know Spiderweb do not have the means to pay an army of writers to flesh out dozens of intricate quests with intagrated storyline and unique characters. But a few interesting quests with memorable characters and dramatic events would have been welcomed.

I got rather bored toward the end, maybe because my party had become as good as they could, and the monsters weren't very dangerous and difficult anymore. Or maybe because I was tired of exploring the same fort or grotto with different names over and over again, but to be fair many RPG  have this effect on me after countless hours of playing.

Avernum is a good old game from a different era, it's refreshing especially for its comeback of corevalues of the genre with none of the frivoulous stuff RPGs have to deal with those days (soap opera romances, over the top graphics, boring sidequests).Its biggest strength can also be its biggest weakness however as it also doesn't make much effort to introduce new concepts and stay on the safe side of Nostalgia. 

Having spent well over 100 hours in this game , I can still say it's qualities still outweitgh its flaws by far, what Avernum does , it does it well. If you look for a nice traditional , no-nonsense RPG with a solid gameplay and credible if at times monotonous world , Avernum is exactly it.Its limitations prevent it to be on the same league as Baldur's gate or Divinity (to be fair those are AAA games...) but it's still an excellent game and well worth your time.",1440153786,1440154751,True,2,0,0.552238762378692627,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was surprised by how engrossing I found the world of Avernum to be despite its lack of pretty graphics, dated mechanics, and its fairly cumbersome UI - due in no small part to the large novel-worth of fantastic writing from Jeff Vogel, who manages to create NPCs who run the gamut from hilarious and bawdy to poetic and tragic.  The inhabitants of Avernum (and boy, there are a lot of them) are a strange and varied lot which help breathe life into the otherwise bare-bones aesthetic of the game.  Not to mention all the various bits of lore and worldbuilding detail that make Avernum feel both unique and immediately familiar to any avid RPG player.

The combat is pretty basic turn-based strategy.  Buffs, proper equipment, a clever distribution of potions/scrolls/wands, and tactical unit placement are all essential to victory.  The character/party building system is not particularly deep and the number and variety of spells are a little underwhelming, but there's still plenty of room for experiementation.  

My only real complaint about the, game besides the sometimes frustrating UI, is the disaapointingly small variety of weapons and armor.  The only melee weapons available are swords (short, long, broad), daggers, and spears/halberds - it's never mentioned why for some reason Avernum blacksmiths are unable to make maces, flails, warhammers, axes, or any of the other medieval weaponry common to the genre - a similar issue with armor, there's only leather, iron, and steel.  I assume it has to do with the original game's limitations, or possible deadline issues (Jeff seems to always be working on something), as adding new weapon classes would mean adding new skill trees which would require a lot more balancing and playtesting.  It's understandable, if not a little disappointing, but maybe I'm asking too much of a remake of a remake of a 20 year old game.  That said, the game is completely littered with various pieces of enchanted equipment which at the very least helps alleviate some of that disappointment.

All-in-all, I whole-heartedly reccomend this to any fans of classic cRPGs like Ultima/Fallout/Baldur's Gate, as well as fans of tactical JRPGs a la FF:Tactics.  It's  real good stuff.",1440038342,1440038342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

RPGs thrived in the 1990s, and for good reason. Games like Avernum (when released in 1995, it was called Exile: Escape from the Pit) aimed to get their player lost in an intriguing world for hours upon hours, leveling up characters, exploring an in-depth story and learning about the game world from multiple NPCs with varying opinions on the world around them, and finding hundreds of secrets (yes, hundreds). These RPGs were made by developers with imaginations that were close to perfection, back when people made games because they loved games and sharing fantasy game worlds they'd created with others, not simply making them to drain wallets and hearts.

The game starts out after your party of characters (which you customize, of course) are thrown into the deep abyss known as Avernum. Avernum is a series of underground caverns that serves as its own subterranean nation far beneath the surface of the world, and is the trash bin that the powerful Empire uses to throw away people who speak out against its rule on the surface. It is effectively a prison, where you are locked away from sunlight and the surface forever--unless you plan to do something about it. It is here where the Avernum series distinguishes itself from many other RPGs. Although Avernum is not a dungeon crawler by genre, it has that feeling of isolation, desperation. You want to get OUT of this underground prison, and the injustices made against you and others you meet in Avernum make you yearn for revenge. Avernum is one of the few fantasy worlds with a dystopian feel; the Empire is this world's Big Brother, and you have the ability to get your revenge, try to escape, or even accept your fate and learn to embrace Avernum. (And thus, this gives you three separate ways to beat the game through various questlines.)

This is not a mindless RPG. Don't go into this game desiring mindless fun, for you will have to read quite a bit, manuever Avernum's cave systems via map systems, and retain information about quests, as the game doesn't hold your hand with doing so. The game does have a journal system that is VERY nice for its time; when you're speaking to an NPC who says something worth noting, you can ""record"" their speech with the click of a button, so you can pull this up at any time. This comes to be very useful, as quest notes don't update as you progress through a quest, so it's up to you to pay attention and know what the next step is. Despite all this, Avernum stays very much so to the right side of the line when it comes to tedium. I encountered no game-breaking quests during my playthrough like I have with other RPGs of the time (Divine Divinity, I'm looking at you, though I love you so). It IS possible to kill NPCs that you'll need for certain questlines, though the other questlines are still available, and there is also a cheat system to help you through this as a last resort (just look up your problem online). 

I think the best thing about this game is just how interesting it is. I love RPGs because I like escaping to a different world for a bit and getting lost in its complexities; I also love exploring and finding secrets, new towns, or a hidden area of a map. This game has that, and its story makes it even more worth finding those extra tidbits. This game has so much to do and so much to explore that it has what I like to call ""Skyrim syndrome"", where sometimes you'll look at your quest log and weep at all you've failed to complete. If throwing yourself into a world is what you're into, I can think of few better worlds than Avernum.

I personally give this game a rating of 9.5/10.

Este es un remake del juego original, diseñado para jugarlo en equipos modernos, con el encanto de los RPG de épocas pretéritas y la comodidad de las resoluciones en monitores grandes.

Cuando empecé a jugar, torcía un poco el morro ante lo sencillo y aparentemente cutre de los gráficos, y lo pobres que son los sonidos. Hay pocos tracks de música y en ese sentido digamos que cumple lo justo, lo necesario para ambientar. Los veteranos reconocerán varios sonidos y efectos, inconfundibles, que podíamos encontrar en juegos viejos como el Shandalar (el mítico juego RPG de Magic The Gathering).

 No hay diálogos hablados. La música es sencilla y los efectos algo cutrecillos. Los gráficos son súper básicos. Pero cualquiera que busque un RPG y esté interesado en la ambientación, la historia principal, en vivir una gran aventura y jugar una campaña de comienzos humildes, pero con final épico, va a encontrar un diamante en bruto con este juego. 

 Lo sorprendente de Avernum es que con las pegas antes descritas, a base de unas descripciones de texto bien elaboradas y con esos limitados recursos visuales, consigue hacer creíble el escenario. Consigue transmitir perfectamente el inframundo que nos rodea, hacer vívidas las ciudades y descripciones de lugares, ominosos los sitios que parecen peligrosos, etcétera. Está muy bien escrito.

 El juego tiene dos partes: el ""de viaje"" y el escenario ""de a pie"". Usamos el primero para viajar por una suerte de sandbox con total libertad, al estilo de los viejos Fallout, descubriendo y explorando (y arriesgándonos a ser destruidos por enemigos mucho más fuertes). Avernum es un sitio bastante grande, con montones de ciudades, refugios, encuentros especiales, secretos, lugares ocultos... Usamos el de ""a pie"" cuando entramos en una localización o hay combate.
 El combate es por turnos, en orden de velocidad o iniciativa, y si bien es sencillo, cumple perfectamente y tiene la suficiente cantidad de opciones para hacerlo muy interesante (y desafiante). Funciona con puntos de acció, de forma similar a los primeros Fallout. El juego puede regularse en dificultad en cualquier momento, para hacerlo más desafiante o más sencillo si algún encuentro se nos atasca demasiado. Tienes bastantes clases disponibles y cuando subes niveles vas obteniendo habilidades y dotes para tus personajes, aunque habitualmente vas a necesitar al menos alguien que cure, alguien que encaje los golpes y alguien que use conjuros, ya que la magia es muy importante cuando el juego se vuelve más difícil.
 Hay unas cuantas habilidades que son ""de grupo"" y que tienen que ver con muchos encuentros en el mundo, en el modo de viaje. Por ejemplo, si vas apilando ""Cave lore"" en tu grupo, te darás cuenta de que descubres con facilidad pasajes ocultos, tesoros enterrados, evitas encuentros hostiles... si acumulas ""Luck"" entre tus personajes de vez en cuando te llevarás alguna sorpresa agradable en encuentros con enemigos, etc. 
 Tienes un registro de misiones, y un sistema de diario que te permite guardar extractos de información interesantes (diálogos, libros, etc) que contengan información que pueda parecer útil (y la hay) o rumores sobre la localización de varios artefactos mágicos de gran poder. El juego tiene diferentes finales, y te dan la opción de continuar una vez completas uno, y con total libertad en el orden en que quieras hacer las cosas. Yo encontré la salida y conseguí escapar, pero a esas alturas ya estaba demasiado involucrado en los acontecimientos de la historia como para abandonar a esa gente a su suerte sin más, así que me dí la vuelta y volví a entrar, para derrotar los desafíos que quedaban en el inframundo...

 Desgranas poco a poco la historia antigua, averigüas cosas sobre algo que posteriormente sale en la continuación del juego, te puedes unir a algunas facciones y ayudar o enemistarte con otras, dedicarte a purgar Avernum de criaturas que te molestan e incluso plantearte asesinar a todos los habitantes de las ciudades. Libertad total, aunque las consecuencias pueden ser nefastas...
 Los conjuros escasean y hay que buscarlos en criptas olvidadas o buscarse la vida para encontrar magos poderosos que nos los enseñen, o pagar dinerales a maestros para mejorarlos. Los objetos mágicos son una rareza en Avernum, y cuesta encontrarlos, pero el explorador dedicado sabrá buscarse la vida y eso siempre conlleva una recompensa. Por poner un ejemplo, poco a poco, averigüando cosas sobre la historia del lugar, oyes hablar de la Primera Expedición que el Imperio mandó a Avernum, equipados con X cosas mágicas poderosas. Si sigues las pistas y exploras en lugares peligrosos, puede que al final las encuentres. Yo conseguí, con nivel 10 o así, una esfera que permitía volar al grupo y atravesar masas de agua, abismos y llegar a sitios inaccesibles en un principio. Se supone que para conseguir ese trasto hay que ir a buscarlo con nivel 20 o más. Tuve que cargar partida muchas veces y escapar como un loco de monstruos errantes, pero la exploración en territorio peligroso valió la pena. Esta falta de linealidad, esa disponibilidad de darle al jugador la opción de hacerlo si quiere, es lo que me ha encantado de este juego.

 Bajo toda la capa de cutres gráficos y sonidos MIDI, es una joya para los amantes de cualquier buena historia y ambientación lograda. Bebe de los clásicos más típicos, pero eso no supone un lastre. La campaña dura bastante y el juego me hizo consumir horas y horas, día tras día, atrapado por el afán de descubrir zonas nuevas, conseguir objetos determinados y completar misiones para volver sobre mis pasos y aplastar a aquellos que te daban fuerte cuando llegaste a Avernum por primera vez. De ser un completo forastero a un héroe reconocido (o temido) en las distintas ciudades del inframundo hay un largo trecho, y por el camino conoceremos a los dragones que se ocultaron del Imperio en las profundidades, y su peculiar historia con los habitantes del submundo y sus difíciles relaciones entre ellos, la historia de las demás razas que pueblan Avernum (y puede que hasta su origen, y de dónde han salido...), quién construyó previamente las monumentales cavernas, qué amenazas sellaron o detuvieron otros héroes mucho antes de que llegaras aquí, etc. 

 Vaya, un juegazo. Yo lo compré por poco más de un euro, pero si me hubiese costado 10 o 20, los habría valido sobradamente. Llegar al final y conseguir superar uno de los finales puede llevar más de 80 horas, o incluso 100 o más si te dedicas a explorar todos los lugares y tratas de completar todas las misiones, como yo. En cuanto lo terminé, quise jugar el siguiente. Si echas de menos aquella sensación de historia bien escrita, combate interesante y viajes largos que tenían juegos como el Fallout 1 y 2, este es tu juego, sin dudarlo.",1437290727,1437290727,True,10,0,0.661885201930999756,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Avernum: Escape From the Pit
(Read on for the full review!)
======================================

Spiderweb Software, creator of the ""Exile"" series took the PC RPG template of the time and ran with it, allowing players to control multiple party members and customize their growth, exploring a vast underground world with a surprisingly intricate story. Avernum: Escape From the Pit is essentially a remake of the original Exile game of the same name. Escape From the Pit has been given a graphical overhaul, utilizing the isometric view used in the Avernum games released most recently by Spiderweb Software. The remake changes more than just the graphics, however, and the result is a game that is both the same and quite different from the original.

======================================

Pros
+ Old School style CRPG with plenty of replay value.
+ Game-play: Explore the open world as you please and do it at your own pace.
+ Really good lore for the game world
+ A ton of sights to see!
+ Engaging story

Cons
- The UI is clunky and the character sheet & Inventory is annoying at times!

Neutral
+/- Doesn't hold your hand at all. (This is a good thing to me)

======================================

Introduction

The Avernum series is based in Avernum, a subterranean nation far under the surface of the world. The surface is ruled by the Empire, a single, monolithic power under the command of the cruel Emperor Hawthorne.

Everyone on the surface who speaks out, rebels, or doesn’t fit in is sentenced to life imprisonment in Avernum. Prisoners are expected to die, the victim of starvation, horrible monsters, or simple despair.

The Avernum series tells the tale of the Avernites' struggle to survive, avenge themselves upon the Empire, and win both freedom and a return to the surface world.

======================================

Game-play

Avernum: Escape from the Pit is a single-player role-playing video game. The player controls a group of up to four adventurers, who can use melee weapons, missile weapons, magic, or a mix of these skills to defeat opponents.

One of the better aspects of this game is the opportunity to customize your adventuring party. Whether you want to have a balanced group featuring every type of character or whether you instead choose to enter battle with an entire team of tanky sword-wielding knights; the game accommodates your decision. You are also allowed to select an image avatar for each of your heroes (whether it fits their class or not is up to you). That having been said, classes make relatively little difference in your characters' long-term potential, as every character can learn every spell and ability regardless of their class. The way this works is that requirements to wield spells are determined by the stats and skills that you develop for a character - meaning that you can choose to make your units as specialized or balanced as you please. Fan of sword-wielding battle mages who can heal their team in a pinch? Not a problem. Want to throw in a super-defensive tank that will soak up damage and demand enemies' attention? Easy. Escape From the Pit allows for such customization without over complication. A downside to this is the risk that characters will become a little generic, but the multitude of customizable aspects (stats, skills, spells, and ""traits"", which function as passive boosts to a character's stats or abilities) help to ensure each of your units is a unique personality.

Escape From the Pit offers several difficulty levels, as well as the ability to adjust the difficulty at any time during your game. This might come in handy depending on how quickly you want to beat Escape From the Pit, because often you will find that enemies are just too difficult and you need to go grind somewhere else before advancing to where you want to go. Yes, Escape From the Pit does involve a lot of grinding in dungeons, but Spiderweb Software has done a great job making this experience far less tedious, with diverse and well-designed environments that often use interesting tricks to create light puzzle elements. The world of Avernum is by no means boring and progressing through the game is both fun and challenging.

All things said, it seems there's a lot beneath the surface here, with plenty of things to see and do that will keep you adventuring for many hours.

======================================

Graphics

If you're looking for up-to-date, modern graphics, you might as well stop reading now. Avernum utilizes 2D graphics in an isometric view, reminiscent of the original Diablo. Obviously this makes the whole thing look quite dated. If you aren't immediately turned off by that, then let me assure you that you will probably love this game. Noticeably improved even over those of the most recent Avernum titles are the character portraits, which are in fact quite beautiful. Otherwise, the graphics are essentially identical to those of recent Avernum titles, reflecting Spiderweb's low priority on steady advancement in that area. This is something important to know because Escape From the Pit is a game that will polarize RPG players depending on how important visuals are to them.

======================================

Conclusion

Overall, Avernum: Escape From the Pit is a solid RPG experience that combines classic style, a compelling story, and generous content to create an indie game that is very much worth your time. If you're looking for a complex single player RPG and value content at the expense of visuals, don't miss this title.

It reminds me of the old ""Pool of Radiance,"" and similar type games, which came out in the 1980's. But, it isn't the same, as in, it isn't ""official DnD rules,"" in fact it is more like a GURPS type system, where each character can be built any way you want. For example, you can have a ""tank"" type character who can also cast healing spells, or a wizard who is also skilled with a bow. 

I was skeptical at first, having been burned several times by games which are no fun at all. But, I am a huge fan of turn based RPG's, which are well made. This is one of them. I can't wait to try Avernum 2, 4, 5 and 6, which are also on Steam. (strangely, there is no Avernum 3 on Steam). 

The fights can be challenging. There have been several in which I thought the entire party would die, but I ended up victorious (my four man party has two healers, one of which is sort of an archer/healer, but it works well to have a back-up healer. I also put one point on healing for my mage, so he can also heal with his huge mana pool if he has to). And my party has been wiped out several times, but the game allows frequent saves, so all you need to do is go back to your last saved game and you're good to go if they all die. 

The game allows you to ""level up,"" with stat and ability increases at each level. There seems to be no level limit. I have been playing the game for a few days and my party is already level eleven. 

Treasure includes things like better armor, weapons, scrolls, wands, potions, money, gems, and all sorts of mundane things, like bags of flour, tools, etc.",1435954571,1435954571,True,1,0,0.523364484310150146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

From the moment you create your party, you are embroiled in the world of Avernum and if you can look past the somewhat crusty (but perfectly functional and intuitive) interface, you will not want to leave your new home until your quest is complete.

Avernum is a bleak, dangerous setting (really just a dank cavern), but somehow the developers have filled it with a wide variety of both environments and inhabitants. Towns have the feel of outposts in the badlands with a motley citizenship of people with sordid pasts, meaning you never quite know where you fit, and always need to watch your back. There are points where you free to attack and kill NPCs that will affect the outcome of the game, but much of the time you will be signing your own death warrant by doing so.

While it may feel a little difficult to play for some people who didn't grow up in the heyday of SSI RPGs, I personally have no significant complaints about Avernum.

Spiderweb Software is an amazing company, and I originally discovered them through their Geneforge games. Now, I was skeptical when I first began playing Avernum because in my opinion it had a lot to live up to. I think I can now safely say that this is my favorite of all their games thus far. It is a remake of Avernum 1, which came out over a decade ago, and all it did was improve. Currently there is a gap in the story, because Avernum 3 has not yet been remade (though I assume you could go play the original) and so unless you're fine with skipping right over to 4, you'll just have to wait with bated breath.

I know a few people who tend to ignore their games due to the admittedly strange graphics (how long can that man hold his arms like that, christ). While their portraiture and icons are very nicely done, they do skimp a bit in the 3D area, though I presume not for lack of trying. Having played a bit TOO many RPGs in days past I believe it to be somewhat nostalgic.

In short, the story is amazing, the art ""antique"", and the replayability significant. If only we could port our endings to the next games. 9/10.",1435177505,1435177505,True,8,1,0.57809901237487793,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The keyboard shortcuts are different than the original so it took alot of relearning. There's also far fewer random encounters (if really any) so gaining experience is somewhat of a strategic challenge.

Party customization is fairly deep and allows for a wide variety of tactical strategies to fit individual play style. It's turn-based, so you can come and go as you please (save after combat). Exploration of hidden areas is rewarding and the non-linear questing (take your own approach, or even finish before picking them up) gives it a realistic touch. Graphics snobs--this might not be for you. As someone who started gaming with Pong, I can appreciate this restyled version of an old classic.

To explain this, I'll have to say that the first Spiderweb game I ever had was Exile 3. It was... well, huge doesn't even begin to describe it. Back then, I didn't know a single english word, but I still played that game (the shareware part, at least) for WEEKS. It took days to even notice that there were shareware restrictions, and then I just started a new game... and it was completely different. The world of Exile 3 was so huge, and there was so much to do, it was practically impossible to play the same story twice. A single decision could change everything.

I miss that. Yes, Avernum has sideplots - important sideplots even. Your decision also influence the story in noticeable ways. Still, compared to Exile 3, where half the sidequests seemed to be at least as important and satisfying as the main quests, Avernum is slightly lacking in diversity.

All of that aside, it's still a great game. The developers of Spiderweb Software have once more (re-)created a huge world, an epic storyweb (I simply refuse to call the complex plot of any of their games a simple storyLINE), many complex and believable characters... and made all of it work with, not despite, limited resources.

My recommendation therefore remains: If you like to get completely lost in a game, if you're looking for a captivating story, If you want to truly identify with the characters of a game, and if all of that is more important to you than fancy graphics and the +12 Sword of <insert fancy name here>, then there's nothing better than a Spiderweb game.

On the whole I think it's a good game, and fun to play if you like 90s-style RPGs, especially for the fairly low cost.

It's a big, open-world game with a significant number of quests and places to wander, and a sizable number of NPCs to interact with. The skills/traits and leveling system is fairly fun to play with. There are some issues that keep me from giving it a 100% positive review:

1) If you play at higher resolution settings, it's going to be harder to see loot on the ground, and the numerous secret door switches that are pretty crucial for discovery and completing dungeons. But it will give you a better tactical view.
2) Loot rewards are pretty flat - at level 30 (not technically a level cap, but more or less is one) I'm still using quite a bit of gear that dropped at level 5.
3) The interface could be a bit better - different shortcuts to open/close windows is a minor annoyance
4) Aesthetically isometric view is nice, but tactically it makes for some challenges, esp. since you can't rotate the camera. This can cause issues with moving if trying to fight tactically and occasionally targeting in combat. 
5) You'll hit 30 before running out of content, at which point only a handful of fights will really be that challenging. Given that semi-tactical combat is one of the upsides, the game loses something when that's gone, though Grah-Hoth was a fun challenge.

The biggest downside for me is really the quest log. The quests can really pile up, the log doesn't really track meaningful details, and quests can't be sorted or deleted.  Quests also stay in your log even when they can't be completed - a minor annoyance.

The lack of detail wouldn't be quite as big a problem, except for the size of the game. Even playing a few hours daily, at some point you'll be working on a quest you picked up several days ago, with often minimal guidance on where you're at in the quest progression. Solving it in-game may require revisiting multiple towns and finding multiple NPCs who may or may not be mentioned in the text.  As the game went along I found myself using internet tips a bit more often because the fun of running back and forth between towns (even with a portal system running to about half of them) had waned.

But on the whole it's a good game. I've put about 60 (mostly enjoyable) hours into it, and am only just past the first of 3 ""game ending"" quests.

Veamos, este es un juego inde y claramente de la vieja escuela, asi que cuanto antes nos olvidemos de los graficos y los fuegos artificiales mucho mejor. Salta a la vista que en ese sentido el juego es bastante sosete y limitado... por lo que no le queda mas remedio que centrarse en el contenido y no en la forma. 

Y que contenido.... madre mia. 

La trama, las misiones, los personajes, el entorno... todo esta muy bien trabajado y diseñado. Al fin y al cabo es un segundo remake y se nota. Todo esta muy pulido y la jugabilidad es tremendamente buena... y dificil. 

Jugabilidad buena porque pese a tener estructura de sandbox todo encaja a la perfeccion y todo tiene un porque, y dificil porque el juego, jugandolo en las dificultades mas altas, llega a convertirse en reto muy viciante y divertido. 

Y es que Avernum esta plagado de detalles de la vieja escuela que hara las delicias de muchos. Mucho contenido, mucho texto, muchas misiones, combate por turnos, acertijos, larga duracion, sentido del humor, bastante dificultad... y con tres misiones finales alternativas para acabar el juego como uno quiera.  

Eso si, no es un juego para todo el mundo y eso hay que tenerlo en cuenta. Es un juego que si se quiere explotar bien nos va a llevar mucho tiempo y dedicacion. Ante todo porque esta en ingles y el juego tiene muchisimo texto, pero tambien porque es un juego muy largo y con mucho contenido. Hoy en dia hay opciones mas vistosas, asequibles, y en castellano, para el jugador de rol ocasional. 

Ahora bien, el que no tenga problemas con el ingles y no le tenga miedo a los juegos largos se lo pasara realmente bien.

Esta claro que tambien tiene algunos puntos mejorables. Dado el inmenso contenido se echa en falta la opcion de poder escribir notas en el mapa... o mas variedad a la hora de elegir personajes, que los hechizos zonales afecten tambien a los aliados si estan en el radio de accion... pero todo esto son detalles que si bien se hacen notar tampoco lastran en exceso el juego. 

En definitiva un gran juego de rol, muy divertido y toda una sorpresa que lamentablemente pasara inadvertida para muchos. 

Muy recomendable para el jugador de rol curtido y que no tenga problemas con el ingles.

Games are more accessible, fun and a lot easier to navigate. However, there are a lot of players and developers who cherish, if that’s the proper term, that old school look and feel. Avernum Escape from the Pit does not disappoint those fans. Its old school in every way from its look, broken mathematics, terrible inventory management, and world navigation. What is painful are these are all minor and fixable flaws that take away the strengths and add dozens upon dozens of unnecessary hours to the game and ultimately ruins your experience.

Avernum Escape from the Pit is an isometric party RPG that from my understanding is a remake of an earlier Spiderweb title, Avernum 6. The story begins with you and 3 other characters that are tossed into the underground world of Avernum for crimes unknown against the empire. Your main objective is to escape, but other game ending objectives become available later in the game. The story, writing and quests design border on excellent and are easily the highlight for your long adventure. 

Avernum is built on a very recognizable RPG level up system with points which are distributed through common statistics, skill and traits trees. As I said earlier the mathematics in the game are broken in such a way a character editor is attached so you can basically max out a character from the start. I did not use the editor until the end where I just had had enough. My party consisted of a tank (sword/shield), tank (pole weapons), Mage (archer), and priest (Archer). I would be confident in any RPG that this party is common and can succeed, but after many failures near the end and reading forum posts, specific character builds, not recommended, are it seems required in order to successfully finish the game. That is unacceptable but makes sense why an editor is attched.

Battles in Avernum are turn based in which the true pain is highlighted. At the onset you will be highly overwhelmed in such a way enemies will hit what feels like 100% of the time while your main characters, no matter how you have them built, will be lucky to hit at 45%. I must have uninstalled and reinstalled the game half a dozen times it is so infuriating. What’s weird is around level 12 you start to feel somewhat capable, but then it all comes crashing back down around level 21. The inconsistences grow as you continue to get deeper in the game. If you are in a dungeon you at least have a fighting chance but out in the open where you can get surrounded, luck, potions, and a healthy healer is your only salvation. As a side note I started the game on hard difficulty as I do with all games, but seeing those statistics and constant early failures I dropped down to normal. I would like to say it made a difference, but not much.

I spent over 100 hours in Avernum and I can’t think of a game that has made me more frustrated. Its complete broken character builds, mathematics and reliance to remain ‘old-school’ doesn’t help build an audience but keeps them away. Until I hear Spiderweb, who just celebrated 20 years in the business, address some modern design into their games, I’ll look elsewhere to spend my RPG time. 

Positives
*The world, story and writing are very good. It’s very reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poeish in the description of places and people. 
*Quest design is excellent. 
*Great couch/ Laptop game never used a mouse.

Negatives
*Reliance on keeping old school mentality dooms the ability to grow an audience
*If you release a character editor chances are the mathematics from your character builds, to enemy AI is broken. 
*No fast travel. There is some minor fast travel but I still figure 20+ hours is running around from place to place. Especially when trying to figure out a quest. The absolute #1 thing that needs implemented.
*Shops don’t replenish goods. One of the most, if not most important potions, is frenzy where it increases your AP for a number of rounds. Because of the size of the world and number of quests, if you use them during some minor battles, when you get to the dragon fights or bosses at the end good luck if you are out.
*Inventory as it has no effect for weight, unless worn, should be shared and have a sort button.
*The loot is very weak. Because this is a dungeon crawler in 2015(released last year) loot should be awesome and your character should mirror that aesthetic, not remain static. 
*Because of the graphical fidelity sometimes loot is hard to see on the screen. An added button to highlight interactive objects would fix this problem. It didn’t bother me, but I know others have complained of the static camera.
*A hit chance of 95% cannot =70%
*Why are there not hidden passages at the end of a dungeon to go straight to the exit or at least a short cut?
*Speech options remain even if you have used them
*One of your main Mage and Priest abilities is to conjure a minion. They are completing useless and are nothing more than a distraction to enemies.

After a while I just kept playing because I wanted to see it done. I didn't enjoy it anymore, but I talked myself into finishing it anyway, to be able to give it a full review.

First of all, it's VERY light for a RPG. Your characters have no personality whatsoever. And it doesn't matter at all what you say to the NPCs you meet - you can just talk to them again, which starts the conversation over from the beginning. Your only concern is how to level up. 

Second, it's waaaay to action oriented. Your characters are running at a feverish pace all through the game to get around the next corner or into the next fight. It does help those ""deliver a message""-quests though.

Third, while I like the main quest, the game is littered with pure grinding quests, like ""get me some shovels"", ""get me some flour"", and in time you'll have 20+ missions lined up, turning you into a quest-solving machine, running in turbo across the map, zipping through dialogue that doesn't matter, without any chance of it affecting your characters in any way except making them stronger, mightinger, richer, whateverer.

This game is for power players who want bigger, meaner characters with zero personality.

Good sides of the game is aforementioned main quest, acceptable NPCs, and a couple of memorable moments. But with achievements like ""I got all the spells and maxed them out two times"", you know it's a grinder.

With main characters that you don't care about, why care about anything? Just kill everything, like you're killing time playing this.

Every time I play this game, I end up playing well into the night, and on some occassions, into the next day.  Why is this game so addictive, why had I never heard of it before, and why is it so inexpensive???  I bought the Spiderweb collection which contained this game (the Avernum1 remake); bought it somewhat on a whim after reading about how the guy who composed all the music for ""Faster than light"" had gotten addicted to this ""hidden gem"".

Avernum reminds me of Ultima7 crossed with Xcom from the '90s.  But Avernum is both challenging and easy to play.  There are so many handy shortcut keys that you can practically play the game from the keyboard.   I love love love the command system, if you want to continuously cast a particular set of spells, you can just keep pressing the same key-combo's so you don't even have to look at the menu options that appear.  I think the biggest problem with Ultima7 was that it was too easy to 1 - get lost in the map, and 2  - get confused about what you had to do with the mission.  Avernum thankfully not only keeps track of all the quests, but also pin-points their relevant locations on the map.  And when I compare it to XCom, I will say that I died so many times, ruthlessly, that it made the game impassable after a certain point and I gave up on it.  Not so with Avernum.  The game is ""Generous"" in that it provides you with many ways to go about improving your party so that you won't die after every-other battle.   However, it's challenging enough that I still have to ""sneak"" around corners everynow and then so that I don't fall into an Ambush.

I got so ""into"" this game last year that I confess I had to put it down completely for a few months.  It was that engrossing.  The other day I started it up again, not even knowing where in the huge world of Avernum I'd left off, and within half an hour I was back along the quest trail, using all the command combo's.  

I must also mention the writing.  Kudos to the author!  I hear the game is solely developed by one man and his wife.  Is this true?  The writing is very nice, old school.  It's almost like playing a text adventure, and visualizing the story really gives you a sense of depth into the Avernum world.  There are also many many little secrets and hidden gems in the game.  For example, last night I battled through the temple of the ""Sliths"" (lizard people).  One of the items on the ground was ""Fine Trousers"" with a description that read along the lines that 'though the slith are wise, they have not yet found appreciation for a fine pair of trousers'.  I don't know, I just caught that when I saw it and thought wow, that's attention to detail.

Avernum1 is the only game from Spiderweb I have played.  I actually can't wait to get my hands on Avernum2 which thankfully just came out (not to mention all the Geneforge and Avadon and other Avernum sequels).  There must be 10 years of gaming goodness in the Spiderweb collection.  But first I have to finish Avernum1.  I wish I could put my life on pause just to play this game.

I loved the setting, the writing and the sense of adventure and exploration. The quests provide a general direction, but you're more or less free to wander around the place and find neat stuff. The world map is rather huge and has lots of points of interest, too. 

The character building sucks, though. You basically choose what weapon (or spellset) you want to use, then pump the relevant stat and skills. For melee the only option is to dual wield, as it does way more damage, and shields just don't help all that much. For range.. spells. Bows are also crap, compared to spells. The items are mostly uninteresting, too. On the bright side, there is a definite feel that your characters get more powerful as they level up, though.

Towards the end I tried to avoid combat as much as possible, as it was seriously getting tedious. It felt like most of the buffs weren't worth casting, as they didn't really seem to help all that much. The debuffs got mostly resisted, so not much help there either. My frontline fighters spent most of their time stunned, rooted or ensnared, so I pretty much spammed aoe on my casters, which.. seems all too familiar from other games :P",1422348852,1422348852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Your characters zip around at lightning speed, both in combat and outside it. The combat speed of the game is equally fast. Damage numbers, state changes, attacks, everything: it all goes so fast that it's hard to tell what's going on. For example, I couldn't tell which enemies my spells were working on, and which ones resisted it. There is no setting for game speed, so this is game-breaking. 

Secondly, the graphics suck. You can't tell what something looks like and it destroys the immersion. Honestly, this game has worse graphics than Fallout 1. The spell amimations and special affects are awful as well.

Third, the controls are really clunky. You can't pass a turn. You can't select a character by clicking on them, you have to use the portraits. The inventory system and the way you pick up items is really wierd. Instead of having nice, neat action bars with abilities on it like every other turn-based rpg, you have to open menus in the middle of combat. It's so tedious. You can tell that very little thought or common sense went into the design choices. 

Fourth, the character developement and skill system is super streamlined. For example, there are only about 20 wizard spells and 20 priest spells in the entire game. And on top of that, you don't choose them. You unlock a specific spell everytime you gain a skill level in casting. The progression is about as linear as you can get. Oh, and rogues can't sneak or pickpocket for some reason. That's like one of the most basic aspects of RPG's! There are also no speech skills, so it looks like this game is 100% combat without any alternatives. Having multiple options, such as stealth or persuation, is one of the main pillars of RPG games and this game totally skips it.

I was recently reminded that I had this, because of the release of Crystal Souls just the other day.. and boy am I sorry I forgot about Avernum for this long.  I should have played this ages ago!

First thing I wanted to do was clear up the order these games are supposed to be in, because with so many Spiderweb Software games, it can be a little confusing to newcomers (like myself, until I did some research)

This is a remake of ""Avernum"" which itself is a remake of ""Exile: Escape From the Pit"".  The newly released Crystal Souls is a remake of Exile 2/Avernum 2.  Exile 3/Avernum3 is also supposedly getting a second remake in the future. 

I know that sounds confusing, so just know that this game, Avernum: EFtP is the first game, remade for the second time. Also, I've been told that the stories are self-contained, so you don't really HAVE to play them in order.  Though, with a world as unique as Avernum, I bet it helps in understanding the lore a bit.

So what makes this world so unique?  Most fantasy RPGs take place on the surface of a very earth-like world.  There's plains, mountains, forests, rivers, lakes, etc.. it all looks very familiar.  In Avernum, that sort of place exists.. but that's not where you play.  You, your party, and countless other individuals have all been exiled to the underworld.  It's a vast underground cavern, whose light comes from glowing moss on the ceiling.

People survive by growing edible mushrooms, and receiving occasional supply shipments from the Empire.. the very people who sent everyone down here.  There are some cows, sent down by the empire, but without proper food, they grow sick and weak quite quickly.  Mages have managed to create things that kinda look like trees, just so the citizens have wood to build with.

Magical equipment is extremely rare in this world.. It's all but impossible to create any, so most of it comes from adventurers who were sent down to Avernum with their gear, then were killed and looted.  It's a harsh world.

Despite all the hardships, though, people have banded together to form towns, forts, and a government.  Of course some still decide to rebel and become bandits, or seek a way to rise into a position of power, but most people seem to live in harmony and cooperate.  And that's a good thing, because if they didn't work together, they'd never be able to fight off the Nephilim (cat people who hold a grudge against all humans for being sent down to Avernum) and the Sliths (lizard men, apparently native to Avernum, and most of them crave human flesh.)

The gameplay is exellent.  At the beginning of the game, you create a party.. your people can be whatever class you want, or 'custom'.  You spend a lot of your time walking around as a party, talking to people, getting quests, learning about the world, etc.. there are blacksmiths and such in every town, to buy equipment from.  There are secrets to find, and plenty of loot to pick up..  

When you're not in a town or dungeon, you'll be on the overworld, where everything is zoomed way back.  You can encounter enemies, special events, and other stuff out on the overworld.. and of course also travel from place to place.  The overworld is pretty darn big, and there are a lot of places to go.

When in combat, the game turns turn-based..  You move and attack with your characters one at a time.. Each character has a certain amount of AP to move with, and are allowed to attack once, or cast 1 spell per turn.. It's simple, but not TOO simple.  It has a good flow, without sacrificing too much strategic depth.

When you level up, you're able to assign attribute points, improve your skills on the skill tree, and sometimes pick a new perk/feat as well.  Pretty basic leveling up, but again simple/basic isn't a bad thing.  The game manages to do a lot with what seems like simple mechanics.

The main thing that will be an issue for some is that the graphics look very dated... and I'm sorry to repeat the same thing everyone else says, but here it goes... Graphics aren't important.  Maybe it's different for people not old enough to have grown up with older-looking graphics, but it doesn't bother me.  Sure, I like a pretty-looking game from time to time.. but it's really not a requirement for me.. but, of course, not everyone will agree.  Everybody has thier own opinions.. so take a look at the screenshots.  If it looks unbearable to you, don't get it.  If you think you can put up with oldschool graphics in order to play an amazing game, get it.

On hearing news of a renewed remake for Avernum II: Crystal Souls coming out later this month, I decied to give this another shot and have been pleasantly surprised. Unlike Avernum 2 or 3, this game doesn't have a large over-arching narrative to draw you in -- it's more of an exploratory game where you're (literally) thrown into a new world to explore and have to figure out how to make your way in it. It's a game driven by your own curiosity and determination to explore the rich new world, and figure out your place in it.

The game combines exploration, action point based combat, and a simple but surprisingly detailed storyline.

After getting through the starting dungeon, you're thrust right into the middle of the Avernum, an underground world full of criminals of the surface Empire with no known means of escaping to the surface. You aren't given a central objective that the game forces you to persue throughout the game, and in fact, there are 3 different game-ending quests that you can complete. You're given the whole world to go through, and you can complete quests in any order you'd like (although some areas require certain items to access, like an orb that grants the power of flight). The towns and NPCs are colorful, although because of the nature of the game, there aren't too many NPCs with more than a few lines of dialogue.

The combat system is simple, but offers plenty of options for tactical play. The system is action point based, and learning how to take advantage of it with abilities like Haste, Slow, Battle Frenzy, Sniping, and Adrenaline Rush is required to beat Avernum's greatest challenges. You also have to learn how to best make use of terrain, crowd control, and knockback abilites: moving through a space adjacent to an enemy uses up 4 of your action points instead of just 1, which allows you to set up choke-points to protect your weaker characters. Torment mode is particularly difficult, and because it's nearly impossible to power level (enemies in dungeons  rarely respawn), you're required to use every dirty trick you have available to win.

Character development and levelling up is fairly basic. The party you play with has 4 members, all of which are created at the beginning of the game. You have 4 main stats (Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, and Intelligence, which do exactly what you'd expect), which go up slowly on their own, and you get 1 point to allocate yourself every level. You also get 2 skill points a level, which go into a branching skill tree which improves things like your casting power, ability to dodge, ability to unlock doors/disarm traps, and gather herbs. This means you aren't restricted to any particular archetypes or classes, and can develop your characters however you want (although certain hybrid character may not be the most effective in combat). You also get a trait every other level, which varies from making your character more likely to be attacked, to selling items for more money, to being able to cast spells in heavy armor. There's nothing about this that stands out immensely, but you are able to make a variety of characters.

The game's graphics are somewhat mediocre, but it's not the focus of the game. There is also no background music in game, only ambient noises. Personally, it doesn't bother me much, but it could be jarring to others. While it should be the standard for games nowadays, I was impressed by how few glitches were in Avernum. Only 2 come to mind, and neither are game breaking (War Blessing only gives a 2% bonus instead of 10%, and targetted AoE spells have unlimited range if centered on an empty space). After the glitchfest of games like Fallout New Vegas, it's relaxing to see a game so free of crashes and progress halting glitches.

Overall a fantastic game. I've probably put more time into Avernum than any other single player RPG (my 150 hours is from two separate playthroughs). It's simple, fun, and a great exploration experience.",1420313646,1420313646,True,11,0,0.645204603672027588,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Best Feature: Turn Based Battle System with Action Points
The strategy involved with just spacing out your party members on the battlefield while doing melee and magic damage to the enemies can be very deep and rewards the player for using the most optimal strategies.

 I think for me the biggest reason I don't recommend this game is that the skill system is useless, and really you're going to end up structuring your party the same vanilla way (warrior, mage, rouge, healer) no matter what your personal style is. I tried doing 3 warriors and a healer and ended up struggling at the end despite being ""overleveled"". I tried doing only ranged/mage and found myself in situations where the maps were very clearly not laid out with any sort of thought to tactical retreating.

There's also no real story behind much of the game. Which, for D&D clones where the whole point is dungeon crawling a good story and redeem most bad mechanics. It's really you just make your way across the map and kill stuff for people as quests. Even the mainstay of fetch quests are really more like ""go clear this castle the thing I want is at the top"" style of quest than anything else. 

Combat is bland. Turn based with speed modifiers. AoE spells are extremely overpowered in basically every situation. Mobs love to aggro from ridiculous distances and you can easily end up fighting a whole floor at once when somebody sees your party through a wall and picks up 20 or so friends on the roundabout way to join the fight. 

Equipment is a joke. Your whole party will most likely end up wearing the same set of steel armor -- even my mages did -- because of how broken the skill system is. 

With nearly 60 hours of game play there is nothing memorable about any of it other than my annoyance that there are two places where you can actually get stuck with no way out and I managed to find both of them. 

There's not really any redeeming qualities about this game, it's a bland D&D clone that's entirely unmemorable.

Особая приятность игры заключается в том, что весь мир любовно спроектирован разработчиками, все мобы поставлены на свои места вручную, вещи тоже разложены по сундукам живым человеком, и нет нигде никакого рандома. Посвюду большое количество поворотиков, секретиков и тайных дверец, за которыми героев ждёт пещера с квестами, уникальный монстр, с которого падает уникальная же шмотка или хотя бы кусочек текста, а героя никогда не обманут упорными боями за сундук, в котором в результате оказывается только батон и вилка. Из-за этого исследовать мир становится дичайше интересно, и процесс этот засасывает как в турбину.
Отдельно приятно, что походы по миру и выполнение квестов не теряют актуальности даже к концу игры, когда протагонисты становятся крутыми надирателями жоп, ведь самые крутые заклинания не получишь, не найдя специальную книжку, новую крутую шмотку всегда есть на кого нарядить, а бабло не становится лишним никогда.
Также понравилось, что разработчики позаботились об игроке: нет смысла мотаться обратно в город, чтобы продать собранное барахло, потому что для него есть отдельный бездонный чемодан - можно скидывать всё имеющее хоть какую-то ценность в него, а при случае сбагрить продавцу всё ненужное одной кнопкой.
Я проходил на среднем уровне сложности. Сначала немного пострадал, но когда врубился что к чему, то сразу как-то полегчало. Банальный совет будущим пионерам: если встретите особо сложного босса, просто забейте, идите в другое подземелье, там тоже интересно, а к обидевшему боссу вернётесь когда подрастёте, тогда его и накажете. В начале игры стоит знак ""Дорогой товарищ, не ходи на юг, там сложно, а иди сначала на север, запад и восток"". Так вот знак не слушай, а смело иди на юг, даже если в других местах не все квесты завершил.
Прохождение заняло у меня 67 часов, но это было очень тщательное прохождение, все у меня в итоге оказались удовлетворены и карта вся была открыта.

А минусану я довольно хилую систему прокачки, которая сводится к тому, что всем колдунам интеллект, а всем воинам силу. Вектор развития очевиден и вариаций не допускает, поэтому двух разных воинов (равно как и разных магов или разных священников) сделать не получится.
Красивых спецэффектов в игре тоже не увидишь, хотя по ним лично я не сильно скучал.

For every 5 minutes of battle, you will spend an equal amount, if not more, reading into the story, conversing with the various characters that inhabit Avernum, and learning about the land from pop-up descriptions.

The skill-up system is nice. Though, classes are pretty linear. Mages mainly focus on mage, priest on priest, and so on. You won't really be seeing many priests dual wielding, or sword-and-board mages. BUT, you can really specialize in certain skills, so though, you can't really roam outside the realms of your specific class, you can specialize it pretty well.

The combat is classic, old-school, turn-based goodness. The difficulty is decent. If you don't know how to play these types of games (learning to buff and debuff prior to battles, crowd control, and so on) this game will prove difficult. Once you get a hang of it, it becomes fun.


AGAIN: If you are not a fan of engrossing yourself into lore, you will not get as much enjoyment out of this game as you could. IF you enjoy lore and character depth, you will thoroughly enjoy this gem.

From the beginning Avernum: Escape from the pit looks intriguing and catchy: from text to text and fight to fight, I found myself playing for 3-4 hours straight after installation without realizing it.
The art and the drawing are inspiring, there is a lot of text that really make us feel the story and the lore, dialogs are brilliant; character creation and advancement, fightings, divine and arcane spellcasting: everything it is intuitive and somehow innovative, taking clear inspiration from old paper rpgs and fusing it with ""modern"" skill trees.
Longevity also seems to be a strong point of this title: I played 4 hours and visited 3 cities, and I could understand from the world map how insignificant is the portion of underworld I explored so far.
The only negative feedback some people might point out is graphics, and on this I completely disagree: it is a simple retro 2d graphic but is not bad at all: on the contrary it is clear and fluent, does not disturb the eye and does not require big machines to run.
Also the music is fitting, with its epic tones: it is just a pity that there is not a bigger variety of tunes.

Now, I can't be sure that the creator of the game is at all familiar with Earthdawn, but the setting definitely has feels of both the post-apocalyptic-ness of Fallout, and the special flavor of the fantasy rpg Earthdawn.

The gist: You did something. The Empire was displeased enough to want you out of the Empire permanently. But, rather than bloody executions that are bad for morale, they sent you... elsewhere. The caverns of Avernum, where you are to live out the rest of your hopefully-short life. Of course, this being an RPG, you have other ideas and other options.

The game world is vast, with a world map spanning numerous screens in every direction, nearly innumerable dungeons, cities, and other places to explore. Three Major Quests, and numerous lesser ones (including, of course, the fetch quests. Where would we be without pointless fetch quests that, thankfully, you can ignore if you want to).

The system is solid: There is a great deal of customizability with your characters. You make a party of four, either from pre-gen characters or making them up from scratch from a mixture of attributes, 'feats', and skills, of which you gain more with every level-up. Sword-mage? Can do. Warrior Priest? Sure. Team of archer-priests? If that's how you want to roll it, sure. Some builds will be better than others, obviously, but especially on the normal and easy modes, you can build how you please and still make it through the game.

The graphics and sounds are not modern-quality. This is an indie game, and it shows. If you want a game that has cutscenes to ooh over, or wonderful soundtracks to slay beasts by, look elsewhere. (This isn't a slight on either the people who will look elsewhere or on the game, by the by. If you want a more visceral experience, by all means find a game that suits your wants more.) What this game does provide, however, is a lot of story. While your character is very much the anybody, allowing you to project yourself seamlessly without a pre-made backstory getting in the way, that means that all of the backstory is the setting's. NPCs there are many of. Random passersby in the towns often have their own things to say. While the atmosphere generated by the graphics engine is often lacking, entering a new place often will give you a long description instead.

In short: It's a solid indie RPG for people who like reading.

To the person who has played these games before, specifically Avernum 4-6: This is very different from those, and in my honest opinion, a great improvement. I have been playing these games since it was known as the Exile series, and I have got to say that this is the highest point they have climbed in the last decade. Not gonna lie, 4-6 were kinda lacking in the realm of creativity. You had a set path and you circled around Avernum while barely having enough skill and items to make it to the next boss, making it extremely stressful and frustrating. Leveling up was by far the worst because you could barely upgrade a single skill, if any. Now, in Avernum:Escape From the Pit, they return to the style of their first real success, Avernum 3, but with even greater creativity when it comes to leveling.

That's hardmode.)

My favourite part of this game is not being told how tough an enemy encounter is going to be. You might wipe the floor with those giant lizards using a single Call the Storm spell. Or you might get dazed, ensnared, and burned to a crisp by exploding slimes. The fun part is picking up from your most recent autosave, assessing where you went wrong, trying something different, and coming out on top with another strategy. (Tip: trigger fights and then retreat to a bottleneck, if possible. Don't underestimate upgraded spells, either.)

Pathfinding range is limited and automatically enters dungeons if they're in the way? Isometric layout makes it difficult to click enemies in the square above you? Some of this stuff seems so obvious that it makes me think Jeff's decided it would take too much time to chip off all the rough edges, but you have to admire his dedication to making games *for a living* which means *to a budget*.

(Edit: it doesn't look like I have many hours in this game, but that's because I mostly play offline on my laptop while commuting. I estimate I've spent at least twenty on it at this point - and dozens more in Jeff's earlier ""Exile"" series during the mid 90s.)",1408504497,1408504561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Avernum: Escape From The Pit is a modernized version of the Avernum series, and while the graphics are still not flashy the game more than makes up for it with good writing and solid turn based combat.

The game is a text heavy one, a blessing or a curse depending on the person playing. The writing is stellar and coupled with the low-key graphics it's one of the few games where you can really use your imagination if you so wish. It is worth noting that Avernum is an open-world RPG, so while I say the writing is stellar, don't expect a centralized story with deep characters--that's not what this game is. The game itself takes place in a huge underground cave complex, a joy for those like me who like underground fantasy settings and even for those who don't should still appreciate the unique and interesting world Avernum presents.

Avernum is lengthy, but if it's your type of game it will feel just right, making it a great game to pick up if you're on a budget. One playthrough alone will take  about seventy to eighty hours if you are a semi completionist, and even if you aren't I would wager it would take a good fifty hours to beat. Throw in harder difficulties and achievements and you can easily extend that playtime twofold.

The combat is fairly atypical for a turn based game, but by no means bland. Each ally/enemy gets one turn per round and there are different types of characters your party can contain (priests, mage, etc.). The game is open world as mentioned and it lets you explore the world on your own, the game guides you very loosely but the bulk of the exploration is up to you to do. As thus, you can easily find yourself faced off against baddies that are higher level than you which can keep the game challenging even on normal difficulty.

Open world exploration in the deep caves of Avernum mixed with some awesome writing and very interesting in-game encounters made this game a blast, but one of the things I liked most was how seamlessly the keyboard was integrated into the game. With the exception of needing to use my touchpad to click on a few interactive objects in the game world and assigning character stats/equipping items, just about everything you need to do in-game can be done with just the keyboard. Conversations, looting, fighting, moving--can all be done with the keyboard. If you're playing at home on your desktop, this may not mean much, but if you want to play this on a laptop without a mouse handy, this game is the one. Very few RPGs can be played on low-end laptops and even fewer can be played without a mouse, but Avernum is perhaps the only game I've played that's required mouse/touchpad input so sparsely. I feel like I could have enjoyed an amazing RPG experience from any Spiderweb game, but this one stands out to me due to the stellar keyboard integration.",1406604304,1406604304,True,74,0,0.803876221179962158,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I didn't care so much for the graphics, and you won't see any eyecandy here. I wanted to have an exciting story.

99% of the time the solution to a problem is to kill everybody and get the XP for it.
There are some interesting races in it and funny characters, but after a while I just really got bored with running around and simply killing stuff.
I found it pretty hard to get to an experience level where I could actually progress to killing the next big enemy, the solution for which is to find random enemies who are weeker and kill them by the thousands so you get enough XP to get to a level where you can take on the next bigger enemy.
The game has an interesting world and political and race stuff and magic going on, but it is a little bit too slow and too open for my tastes, meaning it should tell you a little bit more where to go next or what to do next, and not leave you so alone.
If you don't mind reading a lot and just going around killing stuff for like forever, then go ahead get this game.

I had loved the original incarnation of this game (Exile) from many years ago.  This title is, I believe, the second rerelease of the original.  Some notable differences: Graphics have changed quite immensely, random encounters don't generate very frequently in this version - requiring me to exploit game mechanics to keep the game interesting. More importantly, player party size has been reduced to four members from six. Skill points are handled a bit more differently than the original game as well as player inventory and NPC conversation. Otherwise gameplay and content are much the same.

The updated graphics I'm a bit critical of.  In my eyes, they're quite busy and they have made it less apparant what is significant. However, it may just be that I'm being reminiscent. The avatar image options are, however, quite limited.

The reduction is spawning has been quite an annoyance to me. If you're more into roguelike games where encounters are limited by design, this may appeal to you more. In Avernum, enemies appear to have a chance of respawning upon entering a location. If you simply revisit after sometime playing, there will be almost nothing there. Instead, to get any even significant respawning, you must repeatedly enter and exit a location, else you need to move on. This is quite different from the original game in which respawn appeared to be triggered by timers (often very quickly).

The reduction in PCs is also quite significant.  Given the number of non-combat roles expected of the party (lockpicking, alchemy, cave lore, mage lore, etc) the larger party size helped to balance this amongst characters.  With only four, this feels very limiting and you have to make some hard choices as to what your party will be capable of.

Overall, I enjoyed the original Exile more than this remake.  However, despite this is still a fun and interesting game, especially if you enjoy older RPGs with more up front strategy elements and a big world to explore.",1401737563,1401737563,True,0,0,0.495731204748153687,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For those familiar with Ultima IV (1985 release), Avernum will bring back those fond memories.  In Escape from the Pit, you control up to four party members who have been banished from the Empire.  From that seed, the storyline will grow.  Since this is a relaunch of the Avernum series, the graphics are kept simple, but effective and plays efficiently on much older systems.  Combat is turn-base with turns accomplished sequentially by intitiative and party order.  The story is interesting with plenty of side quests and dungeons/caves to crawl around and explore.

Avernum: Escape from the Pit is actually a remake of the original Avernum, which is in turn a remake of the older Exile: Escape from the Pit. This remake uses a modified version of the engine from Avadon: The Black Fortress, and not only has better compatibility with newer computers, but also is improved in the way of graphics and usability. 

I'm not going to talk much about the graphics. Since this is a SpiderWeb Software game, there isn't going to be much in the way of spectacular graphical effects. Everything is in 2D, but the art has a charm to it that lends itself to the genre. 

The lore and story of Avernum is what makes the game great. The game takes place in an unnamed fantasy world ruled by 'The Empire', led by the ruthless Emperor Hathorn. Hathorn crushes any resistance by banishing unlucky souls into an expansive unground cavern system known only as Avernum. Crimes as petty as vocalized discontent is enough to earn a one way trip to Avernum. The enterance is a one way portal underground, and there is no way out (?). 

You take control of a band of 4 adventurers, each guilty of unspecified crimes against the crown. Upon arrival in Avernum, you learn that despite the harsh conditions of the realm, Avernum has developed its own society, with its own towns, culture, and government. All is not well, however, as the underground Kingdom is locked in a constant state of warfare with the other races that inhabit the caves. The lizardlike Slitherazki, the catlike Nepharim, and the rebels and bandits who disassociate themselves with King Micah's state all try to break down the fragile thread that holds Avernum together.

Once allowed to roam Avernum, your adventurers might find themselves without direction. The world is open, with few prohibitive roadblocks to stop any exploration of the caves you might find yourself wanting to do. The dangers of the southern and western caves will keep you away until you've gained more experience living in the caves. There are three ways to 'win' the game, each of which will reveal itself to you as you gain fame with the people of the cities.

1) Banish the demon lord Grah-Hoth
2) Exterminate the Emperor Hathorn
3) FInd a way to escape the tunnels

These are all lofty goals, and completing smaller tasks to gain strength is a must.

There was only a few times I felt it was tedious play and that was with the friggin horrible ""lights go out, so you must click millions off times to move inches"" periods. The game does have a few minor bugs, like some times in teleporting your party members can end up inside room objects and freezes game for reload and if you happen to double click when casting sometimes your party members cast fake spells and move (when not supposed to move at all) so wasted turns can happen in middle of battles. BUT even with those minor bugs, the game was so fun and challenging I didnt mind over looking them. Newer more expensive games with better graphics have been doing much worse lately.

I bought it during the Christmas Sale on Steam along with everything else Spiderweb had out and decided to start with this title because it had achievements.  I was hooked on the first day.  Three hundred hours later I now have all the characters maxed out, all the endings and achievements and still a craving to play more from Spiderweb. 

Avernum began as Exile back in 1995.  The series has six core titles, making two trilogies in the underworld setting.  The game was then re-released as Avernum in 2000. In 2011, the game was then redesigned for tablets with the Avadon engine and giving a rewritten script. Escape from the Pit is this title and it was announced that the other two games of the first trilogy would be receiving a rewrite and re-release as well to build a more concise and cohesive story for the trilogy.

An evil and despotic emperor rules the entire world above, throwing all dissidents into the pit.  He's rather ruthless about it too.  I was waiting to find the guy who was thrown down in the pit for farting in front of the emperor.  Avernum is a land underground with miles of caverns where humans create societies and come at odds with the other inhabitants of the dark land. It's really impressive to see the depth of character development and the interweaving plots that are made for this game. Kudos to Spiderweb for this. 

Avernum isn't for everybody though.  The graphics are outdated, the music is bland, and the story really takes forever to get going.  
Regardless, I shut the music off and I was fine. I still love this style of graphics personally, and once you do get to the endgame you really feel for the protagonists, cheering for them and really getting into the dialogue.  Grah-Hoth gave me goosebumps and made me feel real dread. Escaping made me feel relieved, and defeating the emperor was exhilarating.  

Besides this, I really don't have much else to say about the game.  Spiderweb Software is a company of three guys making games.  I respect them for this and back in college it was a once a dream of mine and two of my friends to do just this.  For them its a way to tell a story and feed their families at the same time.

The story is much less scripted; your party of four generics is exiled to an underground Australia for defying or upsetting the powers that be, and the setting actually focuses a lot on cave life and does it pretty well.  The semi-open world lets you explore and adventure and kills things for loot, levels, and story progress.  Unlike Avadon, the scripted 'find a way to escape' goal is present in the story itself rather than spoiled and given away at the start.  There's optional fetchquesting and more interesting sidequesting, and a fair share of nice unique loot too which is always a plus in my book.  There is enough optional combat and XP to make the game non-challenging at a certain point, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

The downsides are still numerous though.  There's a lot of RPG min-maxing and information invisible to the player, such as one skill specifying a fatigue reduction bonus in number (5%) per skill point but another merely saying it 'improves fatigue reduction' without saying by how much.  Two-handed weapons do not do more damage for taking up an extra hand and there are so few unique polearms in the game as to make polearms basically worse than sword-and-board or dual-wielding.  Archery is a completely useless skill having literally one unqiue weaponto its name, and there is no reason to not give everyone a single point in priest magic and completely eschew the First Aid skill since 'fighter' skills do not use MP.  Pathfinding is pretty annoying at times because the game does not want to path through allies, path too far, through doors, or falsely tells you a space is blocked.  A lot of abilities are not worth using because they inflict debuffs which have an insignificant impact compared to raw DPS abilities.  The sound design is basically zero.  There is music at the title and credits only, and a lot of ambient noise is lackluster.  Combat sounds are generic and unimpressive.  Aside from at least one charming moment with talking spiders, none of the characters have interesting personalities which is kind of a let down.

So all in all, I'd say the following: The game is passable in combat and character progression (as long as you are good at understanding RPGs) and does please for those interested in gathering cool stuff to equip.  The game has a more open story progression, even if unimpressively delivered by its character writing and sound.  The setting is very unique and interesting, and definately a strong point of the game.

An old school RPG with a new heart, Avernum:Escape from the Pit is a remake of the first Avernum game. Character Customization, inventory management, dilog options and tradition D&D style are the corner stone of an RPG. However what makes this game shine above the others is it's in depth story. You're basically an outcast sent to Avernum, a massive underground prison where the empire sends all their unwanted. You have a choice of freedom, staying and saving Avernum, or killing the king.

If you think this game is easy, it can be, and at times, it ups the anty. There is great reward for great risk, and small reward for little risk. Dragons are the best example of this, there are some I just would not mess with, (mostly because they were cool) but others were crude and rude. So you basically could chose if you wanted to rid the dark bowels of their evil stench, which I thought was a nice touch. Though I'm not sure if the choices you make in this game would carry over to the second, but for now, it's nice to have the option of killing what you want.

Overall, with what it does great, I give this game a 8/10. There's always room for improvement, mostly graphically, but I won't hold it against them too much, since it improved the graphics from the last game greatly. A tutorial on spells may be needed since I didn't know that friendly AOE spells wouldn't harm your party members until mid way through the game, still, it's done well.",1389382752,1389382752,True,0,0,0.469358205795288086,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is a turn-based, isometric view (Diablo-style view looking down from above), single-player fantasy roleplaying game. Let me break that down:

Turn-Based: While not in combat you move your party around exploring wilderness, dungeon, and city environments and interacting with various friendly and hostile NPCs (non-player characters controlled by the computer). When battle starts, the game goes into turn-based mode. People who like the fast and furious action of real-time games like Diablo might find turn-based combat to be slow and tedious. I like it because I can let my attention wander if need be or even walk away for a restroom break right in the middle of battle. It also allows for the formulation of tactics based on the battlefield conditions.

Isometric View: Many RPGs in the 90s used isometric view. The view is from above and slightly at an angle like the Diablo games. It's nice because you get a kind of ""god's eye view"" of the game area.

Single-Player: There is no multiplayer option for Avernum: Escape From the Pit.

Fantasy Roleplaying Game: The environment is traditional ""Western medieval style fantasy"" (i.e., swords and armor and spells and fantasy monsters). There is a bit of a twist in that the game opens up with your being exiled via magic teleportation to a supposedly inescapable underworld where criminals and political prisoners are sent when they cause problems for the Empire.

You can choose from a number of traditional classes (sorcerer, warrior, rogue, berserker, priest, etc.) or you can create your own classes. The pre-made classes are merely certain selections from the game's many abilities, skills, and powers available to characters both when they are created and as they level up. Selecting a pre-made class does not pidgeon hole your character because as you level up you can choose to improve any abilities, skills and powers.

There are multiple difficulties to choose from ranging from beginner to nightmare. You can even change difficulty whenever you wish. So things are going to easy? Notch up the difficulty. Getting frustrated by how hard the play is? Notch it down.

For $10 you absolutely cannot go wrong. This is a fantasy RPG in the tradition of 90s games. I used to play the SSI gold box D&D computer games and Avernum is a great game in the same tradition.",1388945174,1388945174,True,31,0,0.769421756267547607,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is fun, especially if you like tactical, turn-based battles.  Be sure to save often, however, as it is very easy to wander into fights that you can't win yet.

Second remake of the classic Exile series' first part, Avernum: Escape From the Pit is classic roleplaying at its best! Basically, you play as a party of adventurers, who were exiled into a huge cavern, Avernum, far below the surface of the world. You have to find a new purpose here, which basically means doing all kinds of odd-jobs and quests for mayors, wizards and kings of the underworld and, while you're at it, trying to escape your dark prison.

The controls have been streamlined for the 2010s. Like in Avernum, the first remake, the game is still isometric and tile-based. However, you can finally control the characters efficiently with a mouse. This works splendidly, though the controls have frankly lost some of the function of the earlier games: e.g. you can no longer close doors (unless I've yet to discover how). Also, the pathfinding algorithm does some weird stuff sometimes when your preferred path is blocked, making characters run into wrong direction (and at worst, their DOOOOM). There's still no music (except in the title screen and the few cut scenes): use your favorite epic adventure music instead.

Skill system has basically been remade, though the comedic art of the skill descriptions has been appreciatively retained. Skills are now learned in trees, with a basic skill in the bottom and every subsequent skill requiring the below skills before they can be developed. Also, characters gain bonus traits every few levels gaining small bonuses to different skills and stats. It's a matter of taste if these are good or bad changes, but the whole works nevertheless quite fine.

Combat has always been a rather important part of Avernum series. Turn-based, the basics are still there. However, some additions and changes have been made. Warriors have gained special skills called battle disciplines to supplement their fighting ability, making them a bit more interesting and tactical than before. Spells have been remade as well since original Avernum. Particularly, all the blessings and curses have become area effects, and multi-hit spells are now cone or area attacks instead of simply hitting a number of targets.

Frankly, the hard-coreness of the series has dulled quite a bit with this latest installment. No longer are the dark dungeons truly dark, as you don't benefit from bringing a torch or casting light spells (which were actually removed altogether). There is no need to eat to satisfy hunger nor deal with dangerous diseases, and death is no longer so much a set-back as party is automatically resurrected and healed at a friendly town, removing the need for inns and renting rooms. You may no longer jump down ledges (which was never that healthy anyway). Identification of magical items has also been removed (albeit hilariously explained by ""adventurers having better training nowadays""), and potion making has become a trade secret of alchemists, so your party can't learn it itself any longer. Spiders no longer say ""hi!"" in a high-pitched voice audibly. Along with these changes Avernum has lost part of its legacy and spark.

What is left, however, is an excellent RPG adventure in a unique fantasy world. The streamlining makes the game more accessible and lets the player concentrate on what's really important: dialogue, exploration and questing. And their implementation is simply brilliant. There are tens, if not hundreds, of characters in the game who all have their own dialogue trees, and several tens of dungeons and towns to explore, everyone of them extremely detailed. Enemies are still dangerous, and mini-bosses and bosses are refreshingly difficult to beat.

Game is not only high-quality, for there's also quite a lot of it. My first play-through, on Hard difficulty level, lasted about 80 hours. Want to just experience the story? Play on Normal or even Casual difficulty, and you may even change it mid-game. However, the highest difficulty level, Torment, provides an amply named challenge for an experienced player, requiring advance planning and lots of re-exploring in areas that were previously too dangerous. Seriously though, I recommend playing your first game on Hard difficulty at max, as Torment can get tedious if you don't know where to go for the next admissible challenge.

TL:DR?

Excellent dialogues.
Robust tactical combat.
Addicting exploration.
Epic questing to become true heroes.

Not convinced? You may as well give it a try.

Graphically I have to admit that the Exile series hasn't evolved a whole lot, particularly compared to other modern games.  But what has thankfully remained the same is everything else about the Exile series: the gameplay and plotlines.

At its heart this is a turn-based RPG, though with much more freedom to explore and build your characters than most other RPGs on the market.  Want to build a mage who also enjoys wielding a sword?  Yes you can do that.  Or a barbarian who dabbles in archery?  You can do that too.

Enemies and environments are varied enough to make the game interesting.  There are fairly few recolored enemies, and each town is distinct enough that they have their own personality and such.

It is easy to get lost in the cavernous world of Avernum, but I suppose that is part of the setting.

I think it still holds a trophy with most of my hours spent on one game on Steam.
This is the remake of sorts from an award winning indie maker Jeff Vogel who actually made the game back during the 90es, but, for obvious reasons, the game needed to be updated to work with modern machines and OS', so after Jeff updated the engine starting from Avernum 4, he didn't want old game to be forgotten, so he rewrote the wole first game in new engine in 2011. 
It's fairly easy to see old genes still imbedded onto the game. Avernum: Escape from the pit is an Ultima style isometric turn-based RPG with unique skills and magic set into richly detailed fairly unique world with awesome, engaging writing and meticulously detaild maps. Narration and dialogues are the highlight, cause the game is old-school as it gets. No grim-brown realystic 3d graphic, no CGI cutscenes, but lovely prose with lots of charm and wit. Open ended world is one of the highlights. In theory you cn traverse the whole map, or at least most of it from the get-go, but areas do have unstated level requirement and you'll be quickly slaughtered if you go to the harder area than you'r level alows. Every city map is full of details, secret passages and metroid-esque still unreachable places, so don't expect to be 100% through with even the most basic of dungeons or cities up till the very end. Level progression is smooth and T-B combad is addictive in that ancient pokemon/Xcom/Fallout1&2 kind of way.

Or so I thought. 

This game is a member of a disturbingly expansive group of titles I like to call Keep Away Games. Remember the old childhood game keep away, where the whole point was to keep a certain person from getting a certain item they really wanted? This is similar, in that the fun is always kept JUUUUUUST outside your grasp. Ok, that's not true. Sometimes it flies so far over your head that the Sun blinds you, and you lose track of it completely.

-Just when you're enjoying exploring the overworld, your characters get stuck because you're trying to click on the square next to you, but the game thinks you're clicking on you. Teeth starting to grate, CHECK.
-Just when you're enjoying combat, you click to move 2 squares away, and the idiotic AI decides you meant you want to take 4 turns walking completely around the level, taking the absolute most circuitous route possible to get to your destination, rather than move TWO FREAKING STEPS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. Bonus points if this idiocy costs you a battle. Prepare for lots of bonus points. Swearing at computer in multiple languages, CHECK CHECK.
-Just when you've gotten a few dozen rounds of combat down and are feeling good about things, you hit a battle so ridiculously tough (in the same exact area you've been cleaning up) that you have to quicksave and quickload 3 dozen times, hoping to get an outcome where your entire party isn't stunned at the same time for the 3rd turn in a row again. Clicking on ""Delete Local Content,"" oh 10 minutes ago called to give you your CHECK.

I would like to meet the person whose idea of fun is fighting 3 enemies, each of which can stun your entire group at once and summon other monsters to help, which each take 4-5 turns of your team's entire concentrated effort to kill, so that I can tattoo across their forehead in Helvetica bold ""FAULTY GENETIC CODE. DO NOT SLEEP WITH.""

Controls are hideous as well. You can control the whole game via keyboard, and absolutely 165% should, but even that isn't well fleshed out. Hitting I opens up the inventory, of course, but DON'T hit I again. You have to hit ESC to close the menu. Hitting I again may accidentally use the item in your inventory to which the I key got arbitrarily assigned to. Small things like that really don't make that big of a difference, but they certainly don't help a game that already left a sour taste in my mouth.

Games like this actually make me angry, because they have the potential to be SO. AWESOME. Idiotic controls, horrifically moronic AI, COMPLETE lack of direction, and stupefying difficulty spikes aside, you may enjoy this...

There is a lot of traveling and exploration, with all sort of quests that require you to think a bit.  However, the puzzles are easy to figure out and offer great rewards.  The combat is pretty fun and simple.  

This isn't anything spectacularly revolutionary, but it was a cheap thrill for me and I enjoyed it till the end without feeling as I was expecting more from it.  It is what it is: A simple RPG without any extra flair or new feature. I can honestly say that I had gotten more than my hours worth, exploring the underground kingdom for all sorts of lost treasure and whatnot.

You have a group of four people, sentenced to Avernum for crimes against the crown, perhaps they stole something or they may have looked at the emperor funny or they just didn't fit in, despite this, they're chucked into a portal, never to return.

In comparison to the older Avernum, they've made changes, lots of them, skills are distributed via talents, and custom characters get fewer stat points, but you level up faster and there's even a tutorial, how nice of them! It's still quite lengthy, though, but less confusing.

Combat plays out like a tactical RPG, move your characters, cast spells and such. It's worth a look, there's a demo on their site if you're unsure.

The world feels real despite not being first or third person, couple that with cool battles, spells, enemies, skills, and of course, sweet loot, makes Avernum quite a good series.
