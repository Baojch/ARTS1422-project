Außerdem ist von Vorteil, dass man nicht nur auf vier Rädern unterwegs ist, sondern auch zu Wasser und in der Luft.

There are so many issues that it would still deserve a negative review even if were an early access game.
The game seems to be designed by people who very much understand the RC scene, but don't understand game programming at all.

PROS:
-Graphically, this game is fine. The tracks and the cars (exterior and interior) look good.

CONS:
-Everything takes waaaaay to long to load, considering that the graphics aren't pushing any boundaries.
-When i tried to load a track with AI's on it, the game would get stuck in an infinite loading loop. You have to load the track, hit ""restart"" and then add the bots that way.
-AI opponents seem to have a huge impact on your processor. I loaded 9 aI opponents and my framerate dropped to under 10fps. I'm on Windows 10, 64 bit OS, 32gb ram, nvidia Geforce 1080 graphics card. This is idiotic.
-The stock keyboard controls were clearly setup by somebody with little to no gaming experience. Instead of using WASD, they use the arrow keys. What is this, the 90s?
-For a game with the word ""simulation"" in the title, there is very little simulation going on. The cars behave in a very arcade manner. Not only that, but they are nearly undrivable as the wheel's turn rate is so high that it causes your car to spin on itself at almost any speed.
-Several of the stock tracks would put me in an infinite loading loop. I even waited 15 minutes at one point to see if anything would happen. It didn't. Again...how the hell is this a full release??
-Nobody is playing this on multiplayer..and for good reason.
-While i love the idea of editing my own tracks, the track editor once again feels programmed by somebody who has no gaming experience. The editor would have been fine 15 years ago, but it's truely archaic and not user friendly at all for today's standards.
-The car customization area would be fun if it actually saved your paint jobs and let you apply them to your car. I wasn't able to.

I know some people are recommending VRC Pro instead of this garbage, but at 45$ (as of Nov. 2018), it's a bit more than i'd want to spend to simulate being at a real RC track.

If you want a highly satisfying RC gaming experience at little cost, I recommend Sierra's 3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers, from 1999. It's been the greatest RC experience i ever had on a computer.

因为是遥控玩具，所以我们是以一个旁观的视角来操控，说实在的这给我一种难以操控的感觉。

接着又体验了一下飞机与船，飞机按 Y 喷气，方向键调整方向但是手感依旧难受，更难过的是飞到很远之后我们甚至看不到自己的飞机… 这意味着游戏变向的限制了范围… 是很现实… 但是这是游戏啊…

相比起来船的操控性要好过车和飞机太多。


这款游戏的游戏性真是无法让我称道，先不说手感多糟糕，在 PC 中去体验遥控车…emmmmm 说真的，我觉得这本身就是个削减遥控玩具乐趣的过程啊…

It doesn't have AI, or enough players for good multiplayer, so your stuck doing laps around the track solo. AI are currently being worked on at the time of this review, but aren't in the game yet. You can still challenge yourself in ""time trials"" though, aka qualifiers.

The cars are amazing. I think devotid could still add a ""soft touch"" setting for controllers and keyboards, as it's difficult to control 2wd cars. Other than that though, the cars look amazing, handle fairly realistically in my opinion, (ordered a usb dongle today for the real test) and have SPOT ON suspension movement.

The in game paint editor (at the time of this update) is crap in my opinion. I can't even get my bodies to save, the brushes  suck, everything is hard. Which is why you can use photoshop! Thank you devotid! I can't even use photoshop though (or save) because most of the painting files are missing... It works for most people, but I'm one of the lucky few I guess. It's still a work in progress though, so I'm hoping it's fixed in the next update.

The track editor... You can instantly tell this game was made in unity. You can also tell that it's used in one of devotid's other games along with some of the cars. I'm gonna be perfectly honest, I don't like it, but it's better then most games. So be prepared to spend 3mins on a track layout, 1hr on barriers (if you make em nice) and 20mins making and testing jumps. That's a medium sized track without a driverstand, pits, trees, or track logic. So it works, but it takes awhile.

The car setup is indepth, and hard, and complicated. But it's realistic, and if you know what your doing, you can go from an 18.5 hotlap to a 17.9 hotlap with more consistency. The setup not only changes the handling of the car, but it also changes the look. For example, I was feeling ricey one day, so I got a 4x4 shortcourse truck, and I turned it into a slammed drifter with -15 camber, super stiff suspension, and almost no traction on the tires. It actually looked like it had -15 camber though. You can also do that with toe in/out, or make your buggy have 4 wheel steering. The possibilities are close to endless.

Now this may sound like a mediocre game based on this reveiw, but devotid could very well as a single developer make a better game then VRC-Pro. This game has a huge amount of potential! Even though it's lost alot of players, buy this game and stick around, cause if devotid keeps the updates up, we could have active races in the future, a career mode, and a game that appeals to the arcade racer who's never heard of a radio controlled car in his/her life. Or a training tool, where a seasoned veteran can make his/her home track, and log unlimited laps on it in a realistic, free, (other than initial game cost) and quiet environment.",1524093644,1524093644,True,6,1,0.609384357929229736,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Its an early access title so hopefully refinement and updates will make this program better. It`s lacking in control refinement at the moment, especially where the throttles of any of the vehicles are concerned. 
I can move my Thrustmaster throttle to half-way before the engine even starts, then its super sensitive from there on up, and the control is spread over a very small amount of stick travel, which makes all the vehicles seem very twitchy. That needs to be addressed.  

The included maps also lack content, it needs bigger default maps both for the raceways and for flying, and basically, they need a lot more content to look at in them. As an example to convey what I`m talking about,  I chose the `island airstrip` to check out the drones and planes, and once you get past the control issues, especially if you are in first person onboard view, there is literally nothing to look at except blue cloudless sky, and its far too easy to lose orientation because you can`t judge your frame of reference against anything. Even a few clouds would help...

And so far I must say that the driving experience is not close enough to the real thing. It could be allot better. Unlike VRC Pro, or real driving for that matter, the views during gameplay do not corrispond with how you would naturally follow an RC car. What I mean by that is you have an entire view of the track. The car looks a million miles away. But when your actually driving for real you focus more on the car itself and use your perifrial vison and anticipation to see in front of the car. So in my opinion the screen should pan differently when driving, and I hate to use this comparison but more like the screen movement on VRC Pro. That being said my biggest complaint would be the fact that when you stop steering, the car seems to keep giong that direction for what seems like half a second. Theres a huge delay for the steering to get centered up. The wheel is centered and the car continues to steer. This is a huge proplem and it makes it near impossible to complete a lap without running into something. Iv'e tried to find somplace where I can adjust this, or take it out completely but I simply couldnt. I was super stoked about this sim, but if you cant drive the car consistantly it really takes the fun right out of it. I really wish I knew how to fix this handling issue. Other than that, its a great idea, lots of cool fetures and I wish it was a finished product. The game would be totally awesome if it were just simply more realistic like an actual simulator, and less like an arcade style ""game"" feel. Also, the diffucult, confusing, and pretty much none existant ability to adjust the settings, or radio to make for a more realistic feel, as a long time racer in my opinion this whats holing this back. There are allot of flying, and drone sims out there, but only one that focuses on racing cars alone. And its not available for mac. Yet WAY more people race cars as opposed to flying. I know with this ""game"" they are trying to cater to every aspect of RC, but in the end I think by trying to cover everything it  takes away from the realism and development of my personal passsion witch is car racing. Id like to say something positive about it, but with how lame the cars handle its hard for me to do so. I only wish I could fix it, or change some settings and make it more realistic feeling. If theres something Im doing wrong, or if somebody knows of a way to adjust the hanlding and steering delay, please by all means let me know. And also keep in mind that my review is based on someone that is looking for a way to improve lap times and have a way to practice for real racing without having to go to the track.

At first when I bought it, it needed a lot of work. Gameplay, physics, effects, and menus all were pretty rough. Recently, RC Simulation 2.0 has really made itself a very formidable competitor to VRC PRO. Here what you need to know about both these games. VRC Pro is more popular, has more professionals on it, has more realistic physics, and has multiplayer races available for everyone. The huge difference is that if you want all the tracks, all the components, all the little fun accessories and in game items youre gonna need to buy a pretty expensive monthly subscription. RC Simulation 2.0 beats it in affordability, play around fun, bashing mode, availability of RC vehicles, workshop items, and more casual feel to it. I love that now you can use the VRC Pro transmitter adapter sold by VRC which allows you to hook up the reciever from your actual RC car and bind it to a remote and play the video game with the remote you use on your real life RC car! Thats the thing that I believe made RC Simulation 2.0 a real competitor to VRC PRO which at a time was the only RC Simulator game you could find. The things that RC Simulation 2.0 needs in the future is continued upgrades to physics of the R/C vehicles and the tracks. It also needs to get name brands behind the game such as Traxxas, HPI, Team Associated, Losi, Axial, ProBoat, and other brands so that we can have actual models of the R/C cars we love in this game. I for one would love to see a Team Associated b5 or b5m buggy replace the generic 1/10 2wd buggy that I have been whipping lap times with in this game. I would also love to see the edit vehicle settings expanded to the point where you can use a painting program to paint designs on your car and its body. I would also like to see the ability to modify the shapes of the parts on the cars such as wing designs, body shapes, tire patterns, decals, and scale accessories swapping for the crawlers.

I come from playing a little Mobile RC sim called Absolute RC Flight Simulator (it has alot of planes and copters/quads but there are a few boats and cars) its a decent little app for a little relaxation, thats why i wanted to get this game.

Pros:

AMAZING graphics/lighting effects
Controller Support and key binding is sooo helpful (virtually impossible to play properly with arrowkeys)
Ability to make your own tracks and post them on the workshop
and best of all:
a wide and possibly growing range of vehicals to choose from


Cons:
can be buggy at times
controls can feel to sensitive at times
some of the models (mainly the 2 short track trucks) have a problem where the body becomes invisable when looking through the windows or upside down.




Ideas:

now mostly what id like to see added to the game is mostly more model related but an idea for some customization i had is as follows:

what if you implimet an ability to 'make' models and post them like you do with tracks like say someone wanted to make an RC version of say Big Foot (the monster truck) they could take the main build style of a rock crawler or truck and edit the size and shape of different parts of the truck, paint it, add decals or do like hand painting where you can edit parts of the body color manually to add the designs that are on the truck and post it

same could go for other vehicals, if you add helicopters you could eventually make something like a Bell 222 like AirWolf (best Heli ever XD) or maybe make A T-6 Texan with an AeroShell Paint Job, or take an F18 Hornet With a Blue Angel paint job... the possiblilitys for that are truly endless...

I hope to see this game grow in its development (mainly so there can be more people to play online with lol).


As it stands right now at the time of this review i give it a 9.2/10  its a fun sim to play with a wide range of customization for everyting from controls to each vehical you drive/fly but the minor graphical glitches and the... well not 'lacking' but small, variety of vehicals kinda loses.. but again its in development so more can be added :D cant wait to see what else this game has in store KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...

One thing I don't like about default tracks is that there are way too many obstacles for the car to tip over or get stuck in, which is especially problematic for beginners who will definitely have trouble competently navigating the vehicles. I've only tried the game a few times but tipping over all the time really gets in the way of having some real fun with the land vehicles. Yeah, I could built my own nearly obstacle-free course, but maybe the mechanics/physics could be slightly altered so that the thing isn't tipping over ALL THE TIME. I drive real RCs and they don't tip over nearly as often on similar terrain! I noticed some bugs, such as the camera not switching when using hotkeys. I'm running this on linux with open source radeon (r600) drivers on an APU (A10-5800K) and it's fairly smooth at ""Beautiful"" graphical options.

UPDATE: I'm now running this on an R9 285 on the highest quality settings and the cars look really nice. My main gripe still is that some of the vehicles are nearly impossible to drive. One of the cars doesn't turn if on full throttle, which is a bit ridiculous. Others wipe out way too easily. Luckily you can fine tune the cars but not everyone has the time to tweak the vehicles. And of course I realize a 2WD vehicle handles worse than a 4WD, but c'mon. Another thing that would be nice is putting throttle on the left stick and steering on right rather than the opposite (default).",1479205295,1482581921,True,2,0,0.500293433666229248,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I bought this game for £5 on a lunchbreak and straight away crashed the plane about 15 times. Fast forward to now two days later and I can land pretty reliably but still a bit sketchy. For me this game has more than paid for itself in terms of time it has saved me taking off, crashing, then repairing my plane.

You will be having fun on land, air and sea. It is RC so ""sea"" is not the open ocean. You should not RC in the open ocean anyway as small things tend to look like food or at least worth nibbling on to larger sea creatures. Back on topic, this is a ""jack of all trades"" that succedes in all of them. You will not be complaining at all about this title as long as you have something other than the keyboard + mouse for controls. That goes for most vehicle simulators so that is not a drawback. My low budget wheel and pedals worked (that is beyond fun in the land and sea vehicles) which was a smile inducing suprise. You can (but realy shouldn't) fly with the wheel too but a cheap controller will suffice. I am almost sure it will let You use any controller so those of You with a real Futaba or whatever...get the usb adapter and this simulator. Without spoiling it, there is quite a bit of humor throughout RC Simulation 2.0 and there are updates often enough to know it is not forgotten.

I really wanted to like this game-- I tried to find something good in it, but I just can't. Everything is wrong here.

Why?

One: The gameplay is confusing as hell. I wasted about 3 minutes trying to figure out why my car couldn't move and that was because I didn't realize that I needed to move my character (who controls horrible, has terrible camera views) to the car.

Two: Barely any content for a $15 game. You get 8 cars with 6 different tracks. And it's as if they're trying to force you to use mods to make the game more fun-- but the whole point of gaming is that it has to be fun WITHOUT mods. I don't want to modify game files just so I can have more fun with it.

Three: Ugly graphics and performance. The graphics makes the game look far more older than it is. It looks like this game was made in 2005! Can I just mention how bad the performance is? My own computer is having trouble staying above 30 fps, even at moderate settings. No game should have performance as bad as this, especially when the graphics look like something that came from a fucking Xbox game!

Four: CAR CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE! If you're using a gamepad, one notch to the left can completely throw your car off-course, driving into a wall, or accidentally killing yourself or somebody else standing brainlessly on the track. Oh yeah, sometimes my car got stuck on a piece of the track, like a barrier, and I was unable to get out; but the developers for some reason didn't design a way for the player to fix the car if this happened. Even the braindead track marshals can't do anything, and just sit and watch a poor RC car laying upside down in the middle of the track! Can I just mention how sensitive each car is in the game? You'd be going 0 to 60 in no time flat!

Five: Dead multiplayer. Nobody is online, simple as that.

Overall: I can't recommend this game, even for free, because this game is bad and it takes up space. Please ignore this game no matter how good it may look from the previews. I know this game is Early Access, but I have to review what the game is currently, not what it will be in the future.

The ""Follow Cam"" for flying is almost unplayable it needs to be fixed not floating.
A Zoom pic/cam would be much more usefull than the ""map cam"" currently on offer.
TBH for the reasons I bought the early access it's a bit of a let down, the free Picasim is actually much better for learning to fly Quadcopter and Planes but that really is as far as it goes... RC Simulation 2.0 potentially offers so much more. It's early access so I'm not moaning, I'm hoping the sim' continues to develop.
The cars are much more fun and I've been having a blast with the short course trucks on some of the tracks.
For those wanting a sim to practice flying, RC Simulation 2.0 isn't what I'd recommend at this time.

I need to stress that this is nothing as like vrc's simulation as this feels more like a game, vrc's simulation is very sim like and it feels a lot closer to the real thing. 

I'm not knocking this game as it's still currently in early access, I was very excited to see this existed. I played a lot of RealRace duratraxs rc simulator/game and even the second one, I'm not new to rc simulators. I've played great planes air rc simulator and again this is apples to oranges at this stage. 

I grabbed my vrc dongle so i could use my radio as the controller, the game already has support for this which I thought was pretty rad. It plays really well with the controller but again this doesn't feel anything like vrc.

I keep comparing vrc to this why? It's called RC Simulation 2.0, it's still very early access and I'm very impressed with what they have so far.

As a simulator it is doing its job to simulate the Rc world. I have messed around with the track editor and it is a strong feature of the game and was a smart idea to put that in during the period of early access when actual content is low currently.
Now for the dreded complaints, but wait lets first talk about what my complaints are. My only things that I think needed improvement on in the game are things that are fine to have when your game is in early access. The main one being a lack of overall game options for configuring the game to work best, and thats fine the creator is working on them so its not that big of a deal. So with that being explained that I won't go into detail about my complaints because they don't matter at this point of a new early access game.

Something I would love to see implamented is some kind of a driving tutorial. just one level to help those new Rc drivers who this is their first time playing around with a realistic Rc driving mechanics (like the sharp turning and the quick accel). That and I think it would be cool if there could be a car editor tool (not configuring the mechanics) but like creating bodies so  you could have that personalized look. That could be cool but I don't think that needs to be a priority since I would rather see more polish and configurations of the base game.

It is still in Early Access  and yet the controls and game mechanics are very polished.
There is a decent selection of vehicles and an almost unlimited amount of tracks thanks to Workshop support.

The addition of tuning to the RC's has added a great touch of realism and with the ability to actually build from parts in the games future ,this title only gets better and better.

what can i say 

probably the most inportant thing i can say is the DEVELOPERS LISTEN and ACT 
i cant remember the last time i played a game where the devs are so on the ball with the community of players when they have already got the game 

for eg .. 
i drift R.C cars and have done for years so .. i suggested adding Drifting too this game and they did and the car type i wanted  not the big wings yet tho its in progress i may add .
also after some communication with them and some tweaking the game is starting too become better than i thought it would 

the base game has tonnes of interesting things included and some of the bugs are simply hysterical and i hope they keep them in . they are too this game what the swing set was for gta iv if you have ever used that . 

the game modes are good .. sometimes can be complicated too navigate as it is in early access this is going too improve 

the suprise in this game is the physics i am suprised by how much it feels like a R.C vehicle its very close 

this game is looking like its going too develop into something that will be loved by all R.C hobbiests everywhere 

i recomend this game too anyone who is into R.C .. 

oh did i mention steam workshop support .. this is really really well intergrated and is seamless 

so i give this game at this time as it is in early access a 7 out of 10 
and i will review this when the game goes final and change it then .. 

great game ,great developers, great physics, great fun 

i won this game in a competiton the developers held a while back 
but i was watching this and voted for it in greenlight 
and .. have been for a while .. as R.C's are my life :) 

thank you for reading the review it was as honest and accurate as i could say

First of all, i felt in love with the track editor. Despsite the game in an alpha, you can build detailed and complex tracks with easy intuitive tools. In a few hours you can build tracks that looks like they were made like pro developers.

Hard to believe ? I show the receipts on my Steam workshop, where you can download my custom made tracks. Have a look !

Buggies, varied cars, drift cars, drones and boat, the game offers lots of vehicle choices. I know RC 2.0's devs is currently working on vehicle setup. I'm looking forward to this. The multiplayer has to be improved and probably will in the coming months. You can already race against people online but only with people from your country yet. The time trial is working tho and you can try to beat your best laps on the official tracks and self-made community tracks.

Some of the thing that i'd like to see ingame:

- Being able to set more track check-points in the editor (currently 5 + the finish line). This is not enough to create legit multiplayer races.

- With the global multiplayer, a global leaderboard with the lap times. (best of all time, best of the week, of the day, etc)

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

Unlimited possibilities

Very enjoyable: can provide hours of gameplay just screwing around, maybe testing your creations, or trying out what others have made.

Semi-realistic (in a broad sence)

The awesomeness of controlling RC vehicles without having to go outside and do it!

Any controller will work: even a real RC controller can be used with the right USB-PC adaptor

Many different view modes for controlling your vehicle

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]

A few glitches (expected of an early access game) The glitches I have found have given me a good laugh :)

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

Not much bad to be said about this game: but it is unfinished, hence early access. 

[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]
Super fun early access sandbox RC simulation game that will have you playing for hours! Even though I'm not a super huge fan of RC vehicles, I still enjoyed this game.
If you buy this, know that it is currently unfinished but still a whole lot of fun.

Very solid for early access, feel's like a full game already. Basically if you love driving games or RC you will love this game !

I hope we'll be able to change tires and adjust suspension later on :)

RC Simulation 2.0 is the latest RC simulator to hit the Steam store. RCSIM2 offers cars, boats and quadcopters for use on default tracks as well as user-made tracks. As this is an RC simulator it is of course geared towards people who have at least some interest in RC vehicles, if you don’t fit that profile, this game and therefore this review, probably won’t be for you. It’s worth mentioning while I do enjoy RC sims and I do have an interest in the vehicles themselves I’m not hugely knowledgeable about them.

[h1]Presentation [/h1]

RCSIM2 may not have ground-breaking graphics but what it does have are good enough to enjoy the game. The vehicle models are all high quality which of course is the most important part of the game’s presentation as an RC sim. One thing about the game’s presentation that I particularly liked was that, as there is an onboard camera for the vehicles, some of the vehicles have lower quality cameras compared to the third person view, such as on the smallest quadcopter in the game, just added a nice touch of realism for me.

[h1]Gameplay [/h1]

RCSIM2 can be enjoyed in four ways, five if you count the map editor.

First up, we have Practice mode. This is pretty self-explanatory, you choose a vehicle and then select a map you wish to test out. The only limitation here is that boats cannot be used on maps without water which is pretty obvious. Once you’re actually in the game you’re free to explore the map as you wish, the checkpoints and lap markers do work so you can actually complete proper laps and check your time for them if you wish to improve your times for time trials or multiplayer.

Next we have the Time Trial mode. Once you’ve selected your vehicle and track you’ll be given a short warm-up time to get a feel for the track (this can be skipped if you’d rather get straight to the action). You’ll then be given a set amount of time, three minutes, to complete as many laps as you can as fast as you can. Obviously the amount of laps doesn’t matter, it’s your time which is important, but your fastest lap will be used so don’t just sit there and do nothing after your first lap!

Multiplayer is the next mode on our list. Multiplayer basically allows you to do whatever you want. You can race against your friends in any RC vehicle or you could have a quadcopter paintball dogfight against your friends! I know which one I’d choose.

The final proper game mode is the Challenge mode. From what I’ve seen of it the aim of this mode is to shoot a certain amount of balloons using a paintball gun. This mode requires a vehicle with a paintball gun as well as a map that has balloons floating around.

As I mentioned earlier, RCSIM2 also has a track editor (it will eventually have a vehicle editor too). Now I’m not particularly good at using an editor in any game but I did check out RCSIM2’s, I must say it looks incredibly good. You’re given all the tools you need to build whatever track you want. You can change how big the map itself is, you can choose what terrain you want to use and then of course you have access to spawn points and all of the objects in the game. Once you’ve created your track it can be uploaded to the Steam workshop for other people to use. The idea is to create your own tracks and share them (though the game does come with some tracks made by the dev) and so this is obviously a very important part of the game.

There are of course other things I need to mention regarding the gameplay but I’ll keep it short and snappy. RCSIM2 has a full day and night cycle and you’re able to choose whatever time of day you want, though there’s currently no weather in the game. There are eight different camera angles for you to use including a first person camera that allows you to move yourself around, it’s worth mentioning the controls for the gamepad don’t work properly for the first person view and controlling your RC is pretty much impossible in this camera view, it’s mainly just to position yourself. The marshals in the game have ragdoll physics, it’s pretty silly but it can be rather fun to just run them over with your RC or shoot them with a paintball gun every so often in practice mode.

[h1]Miscellaneous [/h1]
[list]
[*]The RC physics seem realistic to me.
[*]The sound effects are reasonably good but from what I’ve read on the forums and other reviews from people who have a better knowledge of RC vehicles they could use some improvement.
[*]Most of the settings aren’t implemented yet, for now you just get a generic quality level for graphics and input options.
[*]In regards to input options, you can use KB&M (not recommended), an Xbox 360 controller (or any other kind of controller that works with windows) and of course, since this is an RC sim, you can use proper RC controllers if they have a USB connector.
[*]There’s not a huge amount of content at the time I’ve written this review but as it progresses through development and more people start making and uploading their own tracks the amount of content will increase.
 [/list]

[h1]Verdict [/h1]

[b]Worth Purchasing. [/b]

RCSIM2 is a solid RC simulator that any fans of the genre should try. It’s reasonably realistic, the RCs themselves look good and it will only get better as it develops. As I said earlier, this game probably isn’t for your average gamer but if you like RCs then you should pick it up or at least follow its development.

It popped up in steam and I just wanted a cheaper niche game that looked fun. 

I had an issue at first with the game not working, but together with a group of guys with similar problems and the Dev, We all got this thing up and running. 

This game is fantastic. I bought this game mostly because it does have RC crawling, but I'm looking forward to using the editor. 

This editor isn't just some mellowed down crappy drag and drop editor, but everything is scalable, rotatable, and it's a real powerful editor. 

The steam workshop will really make this game come alive.

[h1]Pro's:[/h1]
- Already a great sim for the true RC fanatic, eventhough it's still in it's starting shoes, it is great fun.
- Physics engine seems to be well made and has great potential.
- Netcode seems great. (In the first hour I've tried some multiplayer (without opening ports) and even with Europe>USA seemed quite good)
- Generally fun for all ages, especially when running over Larry :)
- Eventhough the content is few, already great variety in content.
- Sandbox/Track-Editor this is an option that stands out, it's already working great and this also has great potential.
- Great controller support, any game like this should have it this way.

[h1]Neutrals / Tips:[/h1]
- Audio/Sounds, the voices are already quite well, but I do think the vehicular sounds are up for improvement.
- More information in-game with the Track Editor. (It took me a while to figure out the track needs all 5 checkpoints, for a lap to be a lap).
- For the Track-Editor to have an option to make long ""strokes"" of the same terrain paint to make straight lines.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Staying really objective I can't see any cons.",1448485249,1448485249,True,39,3,0.67982327938079834,4,True,False,True,False,,,
