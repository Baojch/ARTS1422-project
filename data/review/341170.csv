I had a blast with the game, unfortunately I was unable to finish it.  I absolutely have no idea how to bypass the wall in Egypt.  I tried Super Bounce, but thanks to the corner, my timing is a split second off.  I tried floating constantly, not touching anything, but the wall still comes after you.  Just trying outrunning it is useless, you wont make it.  I tried hitting it, but nothing happens.  Propulsion Kick doesn't work.  Attempting to ""slowly"" move your way through it, doesn't help...  So I don't really know.

Great game nonetheless, will definitely revisit in the future!

[b]NOTA: 10 (MARAVILLA)[/b]
[url=https://youtu.be/ZQA5kiEOG_o][i]Podéis ver mi análisis corto una vez terminado el juego[/i][/url]

Llevo mucho tiempo sin poner un 10, para mi un 10 es un juego perfecto (O casi XD) que incluso me motiva a encontrar y rebuscar sus defectos... y sin embargo, fracaso intentándolo. Por otro lado, las características positivas son sobresalientes, empecemos:

[u][b]- Menú sobresaliente:[/b][/u] Tiene un fondo espectacular con fondo musical de SUPERHEROES! Clavado para el juego. Opciones suficientes para el nivel técnico del juego. No se puede pedir más.

[u][b]- Personalidad de Chris:[/b][/u] Chris es un personajazo, es lo mejor del juego, acompaña con una historia que aunque sea simple, tiene MUCHO trasfondo de fondo. Y con Chris desde el principio hasta el final tiene una personalidad tan currada que ya les gustaría tener muchos en juegos Triple A. 

Tiene uno de los arcos de transformación mas detalladas y realistas que nos afecta a nuestras vidas personales. Y no exagero... es un juego donde podemos ser mejores en nuestra vida real gracias a Chris... Y también como no olvidar sus sarcasmos y su humor.

[u][b]- Personajes de la trama:[/b][/u] Hay una salvajada de personajes que sorprendemente son únicos, memorables y cada uno con una personalidad distinta y divertida. 

Es la gran salsa perfecta para acompañar a la personalidad de Chris y con su humor, ya que no es el único que hace gracia. Hasta los villanos tienen un diseño artitico molón y divertidos. 

[u][b]- Diseño de juego SOBRESALIENTE:[/b][/u] Un gran aplauso al diseñador de este videojuego, quien es el mismo que hace de Chris en el juego XD. Es una persona que ha conseguido hacer que desde el principio hasta el final no pare de haber novedades en cuanto a mecanicas, narrativo que acompañe al diseño de juego, desafíos, TESTEO (Que no se nos olvide).

Es un gran diseñador que promete para cualquier empresa que quiera requerir un perfil para su proyecto. OLE SUS HUEVOS. 

Y no solo eso... El diseño de juego también entra la dificultad, es un juego difícil, pero divertido y justo. Así que si te mueres por alguna cosa... es culpa tuya, no del juego. [i](Manotaza a DarkSouls)[/i]

[u][b]- Arte y estética clavado: [/b][/u] No olvidemos de esta parte, y puede que para algunos no les suponga una caracteristica a destacar. Pues en realidad lo es, no hay que olvidar de su compañero desarrollador quien ha hecho todo el arte y animacion. ¿Quieres un juego simple, plataformero, disparos, magia, humor, personajes locos y difererentes y superheroes? Pues dibujitos a lo Cartoon y fuera... Clavado! XD No se puede pedir más. 

Hay que decir al artista que lo ha hecho muy bien y las animaciones son estupendas. ¡Buena elección!

[b]RESUMEN: [/b] Es un juego que engaña muchisimo, me esperaba un juego simplon y poco mas... y sin embargo es una puta obra maestra. Por supuesto, siempre pongo nota dependiendo de la calidad y tipo de juego. No es lo mismo un juego Triple A que uno indie creado por 2 personas, señores.

The story is fairly straightforward.  One day Chris and a number of other children are abducted, transformed and offered off as gifts to a league of monstrous demi-humans.  Chris, who's transformation has given him the ability to inflate like a balloon, manages to escape and goes on a world-spanning journey to rescue the other children.  Along the way, his journey becomes something more than just a rescue mission.  

This game really took me by surprise and it's worth checking out if you're looking for a fun, story-based platformer to spend some time with.  Here's what I liked and disliked:

Pros:

+There's a surprisingly engaging (and occasionally funny) story here with some decent world building.

+ There's a lot of variety in the levels (e.g. an imposing pyramid, a smog-filled city, an underwater facility).  Each level has its own set of enemies and a unique boss fight at the end.

+ The game has 10+ unique boss fights, including a pretty cool post-game boss.

+ As the game progresses, you get additional abilities for platforming, new spells for ranged combat and a sword for more effective melee.  It keeps things fresh.

+There's a hub world with a number of power ups you can buy to reduce the game's difficulty (e.g. health/ magic increases, armor, etc.).  You can unlock pretty much everything without grinding.

+ Quick respawning at the start of each section, much like Super Meat Boy, so you never lose too much progress when you die.

  
Cons:

- The beginning isn't fun to play and Chris' default punch attack feels imprecise and clunky.  I think this could give players an unfavorable (and incorrect) impression of what the majority of the game will be like.

- The laser traps.  They're instant death and sometimes it seems like they can kill you even when you're a little out of their range.

- You don't reheal between levels.  You can just kill yourself for an instant reheal, but it's still slightly annoying.

- The last level's platforming is surprisingly sadistic.  It doesn't take too long to get through, but it really isn't fun.  


So yeah, the good far outweighs the bad.  I had way more fun with this game than I was expecting. If you're in the mood for a quirky platformer with a lot of charm and some fun boss fights, I recommend giving it a try",1688863180,1688863180,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[b]Intro[/b]

Adventures of Chris is a platformer with metroidvania elements. Gameplay consists of platforming using your inflate/deflate skill and fighting enemies with magic and fists. Along the way you collect cookies that are used to buy upgrades.

[b]The Good[/b]

-    Inflate/deflate works quite well and sometimes requires fun upside down platforming.
-    On death you quickly respawn, usually not that far back.
-    If you get stuck you can often leave the map and return later with upgrades.

[b]The Bad[/b]

-    If you get stuck you'll have to grind cookies.
-    No option to automatically speed up dialogue.
-    Metroidvania means backtracking.
-    Enemies are unpredictable in a bad way.
-    Annoying hard-to-see spike traps.

[b]The Ugly[/b]

-    The hitboxes are really bad.
-    The difficulty is all over the place with some weirdly hard parts.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Adventures of Chris isn't a bad game but it lacks the tight gameplay that you want from a platformer. Instead you clumsily bounce around the map until you manage to get past enemies that suddenly turn around mid-patrol and unbalanced areas.",1667943249,1667943249,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,False,False,False,True,,,

While one can say the gameplay is inspired by games of the 90s, the level design and visual art style kind of reminds me of beloved flash/browser games (though let’s be real, the backgrounds are amazing). It may sound like I am calling the level design simplistic, and to a degree that is the case with the way platforming appears in some sections. As someone who had those kinds of games in childhood, I think it is kind of fitting with the subject matter. Another game series that this reminded me of was the Donkey Kong Country trilogy. In a similar way, environments mesh with the abilities of the player.

The story is a decent and humorous spin on the typical ark of its inspirations, and characters were pretty well done. I enjoyed the writing for the most part, and that speaks volumes for a game that seems to be targeting a broad audience. The gameplay is best described as metroidvania-esque ([spoiler] can’t argue with the Chris ability screen [/spoiler]). Interestingly, this was the first time I played a game with metroidvania styled abilities that made me forget that I had a certain ability: [spoiler] when I got to Egypt, I forgot that super bounce existed, and I was extremely confused for a solid 30 seconds [/spoiler]. This is to the benefit of the gameplay because most progression is straightforward. I didn’t particularly like the way the game spells out everything for you on the world map at the beginning. If I designed the game, I probably would have just left the player to decide where to explore around the globe and decide when to quit a level to potentially find helpful items elsewhere. Also, I would have hidden the optional level as a location without a level marker that the player would have to hover over, and maybe press a button, to make the level marker appear so that it is more reminiscent of the cryptic nature of older games. Perhaps an NPC would hint at its location or something. Because it seems that the game is meant to appeal to more modern audiences in the sense of accessibility, I can understand why things were designed to be more straightforward. That is why I am somewhat surprised that Chris moves so slowly on the world map from level to level (though it is a heck of a lot faster than he would travel around the real globe). 

Interesting and commendable decisions were made for this game. The developers seemed to really want every player to get a chance to see the entirety of what the game has to offer; [spoiler] particularly with the item that rings when you’re in an area that has items, which allows you to challenge yourself with “true ending” content once you have 100% of collectable items [/spoiler]. Difficulty is pretty consistent until the end of the game [spoiler] and post-game [/spoiler]. I found that there is a fun learning curve in some of the combat, especially towards the end of my play-through ([spoiler] though the true ending boss fight involves by far the most challenging and fun use of Chris abilities [/spoiler]). In one instance, a boss fight felt cheap, but it would have been less so had I done something in particular that I hadn’t gotten around to until later: [spoiler] Main final boss first phase seemed to guarantee that you take damage due to its movement pattern, but I think the defense spell would have made it a lot easier; I am still somewhat doubtful that a hitless run of that fight is feasible, but it is possible you need to bait the boss into teleporting when the boss is hugging the wall (dashing into him when he is by a wall means you take a hit) [/spoiler]. 

The last thing I want to mention is that the sound design (*POP* never gets old) and soundtrack are both great. The game treads this fine line between being parody and having quality character moments, so I feel like the soundtrack really balances that out by being grand and even genuinely emotional at times (town theme and endgame tracks).
I used to look for insanely epic hardcore games with brilliant storytelling. With time, I kind of wanted something a little more chill here and there. So, when I saw the trailer, I was expecting a light metroidvania-esque game to enjoy with some new, clever, and entertaining twists, and that is exactly what I got and more. Cheers for a cool experience, and all the best to those who worked on it.

[spoiler] P.S., I just had a look at the alternative modes, and I am impressed that there’s a quick start, easier modes, harder difficulty, and an entirely separate quest type with harder level design. I am also loving the interactive developer commentary concept. [/spoiler]",1660614680,1660614847,True,1,0,0.500924229621887207,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Good:
Good game play mechanics and responsive controls (I used a controller). And the abilities you gradually get are interesting, and change the way you approach the levels.
Music is fine and appropriate to the aesthetic.
Different levels of difficulty.
It's about 10-12 hours to beat the main quest. That's about the perfect amount of time.

The meh:
The art style is an acquired taste. It's a bit derpy and amateurish in a '90s cartoon kinda way.
The story is pretty nonsensical. I didn't feel that invested, but I guess it connected the dots adequately.
Unless you're a completionist, you can breeze through most of the levels (especially on easy). However, there's a huge difficulty spike on that last level (I spent about 2 of my 11 hours on that last boss alone). If you haven't done a bit of grinding to get the optional protective clothes, extra life, power and inflation power-ups, you will get wrecked.

The bad:
Chris is pudgy, and a lot of the humor in the story revolves around it. And I won't say it's a fatshaming game, per se, but the writing really straddles the fence between laughing with and laughing at Chris, a mix of sympathy and cheap shots.

Verdict: I enjoyed this casual, nostalgic platformer more than I expected, and the final boss (actually there's a secret harder boss, but I can't be bothered) really got my blood pumping too. I got it in a bundle for almost nothing, but it's definitely worth it at full price.

You can quickly tell that this game is a love letter to anyone who ever had the childhood thought of how they'd make a video game. It's silly, over the top, yet takes itself somewhat seriously.

At its core, the game is a tight controlling platformer that borrows attributes from many tried and true classics while still putting its own unique twists in the fold.  I love the balloon mechanics and how intuitive they control. Throughout the campaign, you unlock additional powers and buffs to Chris. While some of the powers weren't very useful for my style of play, I think it's fair to say that none of the powers are useless and anyone could a power to suit their style.

I have to say, this game goes beyond being ""just a Mega Man clone"" and puts on a workshop for mindful developer decisions. You can feel how much thought went into nearly every aspect of this game, and the wonderful Dev Commentary mode (which I would love to see more of from other games) confirms this. 

tldr; The game has great controls, unique mechanics, reasonable difficulty, a silly story with actual committed lore, awesome music, and is packed with a ton of great lessons that aspiring game developers should learn. The art style isn't always consistent, and sometimes the game will introduce gimicks that will go unused the rest of the game. While that could come across as a negative, I think that those are completely forgivable within the context that this was a tight budgeted passion project from an indie studio.

My main criticisms are that the map navigation is slow, and a couple bosses seem RNG heavy. That's not to say the game has ""cheap"" bosses, but there are two specific bosses that seem to randomly fly around and leave you waiting for when they'll let you hit them. Again, it's not necessarily a hard thing to play against, it's just boring to wait for key striking moments.",1656357553,1656357553,True,1,0,0.500924229621887207,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Even at full price, the game is worth it for the presentation alone.

The hand-drawn character sprites and levels are so rich with vibrant colors and cartoonish detail that it's hard not to fall in love with the presentation. I'm always a sucker for anything hand-drawn, and Adventures of Chris' simple-but-appealing character designs were always a treat. The story is told entirely with in-game graphics and text boxes, which gets the job done, but admittedly feels lacking. Perhaps this is unfair, but I would have liked the occasional animated cutscene or comic panel style animatic to punctuate key moments in the story - after having seen the trailers for this game, I was admittedly expecting one or two, but there were none that I could find, which was admittedly disappointing, but not at all  a knock against the quality of the game itself.

The story, such as it is, is pretty straightforward - the player takes control of a 13-year-old 7th grade boy named Chris who gets mysteriously warped to a vampire's castle along with six other kids, only for them all to be transformed into giant toys given to other villains as prisoners/trophies. Chris, however, was transformed into a balloon, and after learning to control his newfound powers thanks to some talking balloons from a kingdom high in the sky, decides to travel the world and save the remaining children from the evil Society of Fiends.

Sounds like something straight out of the imagination of a child, in the best way possible - dialogue sort of invokes a Saturday Morning Cartoon kind of vibe, and stakes are kept just high enough so that the game never takes itself too seriously. What I was not expecting, however, were the little details that helped make the world of AOC feel more rich. Without spoiling anything, the story goes a bit deeper than one might expect, so long as you look in the right places, and it's that extra little depth that helped make the story even more fun. 

Gameplay is reminiscent of a retro 2D action-platformer, where Chris has to use an ever-growing list of upgrades and abilities to get past tough obstacles, and fight a boss at the end of each level. The structure is similar to a Megaman game, where you can select which of the levels you want to do in any order, but each level provides you with what you will need to get it done without having to rely on an ability from a separate stage. Of course, those extra and optional abilities that you can find also help make quick work of your foes.

A core mechanic of this game, and also the feature I was most fascinated in, was Chris' ability to inflate and deflate himself like a balloon, since I knew that would create a lot of fun oppurtunities for level design. There will be moments in the game where you have to sort of platform on the ceiling, and it feels almost like playing the level upside down, which was a lot of fun. This ability can also be used in junction with some other abilities - mostly magic spells - and while it may seem like using this ability will actually trivialize a lot of the platforming, you can only inflate so many times, and inflating always sends you up, so it's more about timing than anything. It's not like in Kirby where it acts as a sort of infinite jump button.

AOC can be rather tough sometimes, but never in an unfair way. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have moments of frustration, but the recommended difficulty is quite forgiving - there are no lives in AOC, and every time you die, you are put back at the beginning of the screen you are on, not the beginning of the level, so if you have trouble, it is very easy to get back in and try again, so I wouldn't say it's discouraging. I have not played the higher difficulties, so I can't confirm how those feel, but they are there for added replay value regardless.

Adventures of Chris feels like a hidden gem, since I had not heard of it until a year and a half after it came out, which is such a shame.

The writing is decent. It is overall entertaining, but I would wait for it to be on sale. Here's why: 

DIFFICULTY:  The OVERALL difficulty of this game is very easy if you have experience with platformers or metroidvanias. Unfortunately, there are isolated parts of this game that are incredibly challenging and different from the general feel, so much so that the change in expectation is frustrating. Platforming is relatively easy, except for maybe one or two areas that are suddenly VERY hard. The enemies are unimaginative and all get killed with one shot (except for one type later), and the bosses are very easy and simple to follow. The last boss, by comparison, is much harder but that difficulty doesn't come from crazy movement or patterns you have to memorize - but rather the fact the game forces combat in a ridiculous environment and you have to rely on the main mechanic to actually win the fight, which is an artificial difficulty and a bland choice in my opinion. 

PROGRESSION: Progression is linear and predictable and the levels are unimaginative. The story isn't bad, but everything is fairly predictable and you don't get a sense of getting more powerful other than simply buying health upgrades and the damage resisting armor that is sold at the shop. There is a dodge ability you get later in the game that is pretty game-breaking, because it can be spammed endlessely, so overall progression is confusing. In the beginning the game is actually very hard, because you can't heal (outside of items you find) and you have limited mobility and ways to damage. This makes the first few bosses a decent challenge, but again not because of their inherent movement but rather because of your limitations. 

CONTROLS: The controls of this game are both what make it stand out and entertaining, yet ironically also what make it frustrating at many points throughout. The last boss battle, which I mentioned, relies completely on the floating mechanic which is a horrible way to create difficult - especially when you can cheese your way out of it with constant dodging. There are also so many controls between abilities and movement that it takes getting used to, yet you never really feel totally intuitive about because of their arrangement.

Is Adventures of Chris the right game to be played by fellow Gaming Fathers and their families? There are many things that I like about the game - inventive story, sense of humor, system of skills and upgrades, variability of environment, good level design, optional level of difficulty, responsive controls and nice graphics. There are also some things that I dislike - frustrating boss battles along with the inability to shoot vertically, lack of game modes - there is just a story, absence of dubbing and also absence of local multiplayer that would make the game more suitable for family playing.

Pros:
- story
- sense of humor
- skills and upgrade system
- game variability
- level design
- optional level of difficulty
- controls
- graphics

Cons:
- some boss battles
- inability to shoot vertically
- lack of game modes
- absence of dubbing
- no local multiplayer

After some training by the King of Lost Balloons (just roll with it), he gains the ability to float and deflate himself at will. The mechanic is similar to gravity mechanics in games like VVVVV, but more forgiving than those tend to be.

The levels are built around this concept - Chris pushes himself along ceilings, activates carefully timed inflations to drift through spiked-lined corridors, and deflates to drop quickly and avoid attacks. It takes some getting used to, but Adventures of Chris is not a terribly difficult game, so nearly anyone can master the mechanic.

The game is fairly short, but there's plenty of replay value for those who want a greater challenge. Mean Mode offers a new set of levels with harder platforming challenges (while also giving Chris a chance to float right over the fourth wall), while Developer Commentary is just what it says on the tin. And if you think the game would be better if you died twice as fast? Well, there's an aptly-named option for that, too.

The main mechanic is Chris being able to fly and move on the ceiling, but there is much more to that as you will eventually learn new abilities the level design will take advantage of.

Cons:
- does not look very good at all. Characters/mobs are okay, scenery is meh at best

Other issues:
- the end game player character abilities may be a bit OP in that they offer too fast movement imho, I think they should have been nerfed a bit. Sure it gives a sense of progress, but too much is too much
- the level design is limited in scope, because checkpoints are so close to one another and each new sub-area is ""sealed"" from the previous one (there is a screen transition). This is kinda both a pro and a con, it makes the game easier to play.

Nitpicks:
- death/respawn mechanic is excessively forgiving, so the ""suicide to restart with full health"" loophole applies (no big worries), and sometimes it is too easy to ""brute force"" very short but difficult screens
- transitions (after a boss fight for instance) are a bit rough - mainly due to lack of more characters animations. For instance, I guess they could have made a Chris ""victory"" stance after bosses (some games like Rayman did that), that kind of thing.

Pros:
- fun main mechanic (the floating ability) which is well made use of
- silly dialog (skippable if you don't care) and characters
- gameplay and level design that are very diversified from start to finish.
As mentioned above, the level design could have used more complexity (more advanced navigation, planning and such), but the sub-areas being so short kinda prevents it.
- relatively short (~4 to 5h) with no feel of repetition
- cool boss fights, though they may be difficult for some players

The stages' art is ugly and layout boring. Everything looks the same from start to finish, with platforms scattered without any meaning. Stages have a disturbing claustrophobic feel because the protagonist is so wide and stages so narrow. Most of the time I felt like a mouse stuck in a maze.

As already mentioned by several reviewers, the hitbox is a mess. The dev probably knew this and added health drinks everywhere. Maneuvering around rooms with spikes is impossible without getting hit. Boss fights are the worst because they take place in small rooms where you can’t dodge effectively. Because the same button is used to slide and jump, dodging in a middle of a battle gets you killed. It just doesn’t work.

Our game is 2.5D indie action platformer game with basic but kind of interesting story. We have lots of power and side skills to use while platforming and fight with monsters aswell.


[h1] ARE STORY AND STORY TELLING IS GOOD? [/h1]
I do like to say yes, its basic but pretty good story. Details are well writed and story telling is good aswell. We have some funny and cool parts and they are pretty enjoyable. Espacily the part we learn our main character background story about how people treath him like a useless fat boy, how he cant join basketboll team because he cant jump high etc... And with progressing our story how we can jump higher than anyone, how powerfull we became etc... These parts feels amazing. Learning new powers, doing things we cant do before, became powerfull is gives pretty enjoyable feeling and i realy love that. There is only one annoying thing about our story and thats Balloon people and masters telling us ''YOU ARE NOT THE HERO'' and it could be okey if its happening until half of the game or someting but even after getting all those powers and ruscuing some kids its still happening and its pretty annoying.


[h1] HOW ABOUT LEVEL/WORLD DESIGNS? [/h1]
We have 8 different world/level and one main base and overall they are pretty good, and every map have their own platform mechanics/logics and designs make them unique then other one. Some of them have traps, some of them have weather events, some of them have puzzles etc... Long story short: world/map/level desings are pretty good for indie game.


[h1] GAMEPLAY MECHANICS ARE WELL MAKED? [/h1]
Our gameplay is pretty basic but good same time and well suited for action platform game. And while we dont have any kind of big skill tree we still have some magic powers, lots of secondary skill to use for platform machanics and some upgrades like health and magic level etc. Gaining new power or side skills while exploring new map/level is gives good feeling and they keep game fresh and enjoyable aswell. BTW i realy love the part we travel as a big Balloon in world map, its realy funny LOL.


[h1] BOOS FIGHTS ARE ENJOYABLE? [/h1]
I'm not sure about ''Enjoyable'' but i can cleary say they are well maked and smart. Most of them can't be defeated with using same tactic over and over again. Espacily [spoiler]Grim Reaper BOSS was amazing, when you give him damage he says ''Oh time to use new tactic then!'' and changes his tactic.[/spoiler] Doing same tactic over and over again don't lead you easy and idiotic win in this game, and honestly even lots of big company games does that idiotic mistake, so having different paterns for BOSS'es and can't defeat them with same tactic is pretty good for indie game. BTW BOSS'es are quite hard, espacily if you are not good playing platform games you gonna have pretty hard time... So... Prepare to die a lot, because this game is not easy, espacily final part of game was pretty hard. Platforms and BOSS'es was hard like hell... Espacily [spoiler] turning in to actual ballon and doing platforms [/spoiler] was so annoying and hard... Come on dude? Seriously?! Platforms wasn't hard enough?!


[h1] HOW ABOUT VISUAL QUALITY AND STYLE? [/h1]
Honestly our visual style and quality is pretty good for indie game. It could be little bit better but its not bad at all. Its basic but does job very well.


[h1] OUTCOME EVALUATION [/h1]
Its pretty amazing game with cool story, well maked world/level desings, well maked platform details and gameplay mechanics. And bad point of game is heavy focus on platforms, so if you are not big fan of platform games things can be annoying for you. I'm not big platform game fan, and because of that parts of game was annoying for me. Still i enjoyed my time and love the game a lot. Definity will be worth spending time and money.

[h1]Overall Rating - High Quality ★★★★☆[/h1]

[h1]First Impressions[/h1]
I'm not one of those fat acceptance people, but there's not many games built around chunkier figures, making the titular character in the Adventures of Chris (AC) stand out. When looking at the trailer and description, there was an absurdity in the premise that I enjoyed. It didn't sound as bland as Curious George Goes to Space, but also not so extreme as Curious George High Fives Harambe in Hell. 


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
AC opens up in a similar fashion to the SNES game Lester the Unlikely. Chris is not an athletic kid, so when faced with the basic hurdles of a platformer, he's not up to the challenge. Unlike Lester though, he gets a substantial boost quickly, as he's transformed into a balloon, which provides for an unlikely set of super powers. These gradually accumulate in the game, from purchasing baked goods and armor, to learning mystical arts from debudo masters. As he hones these abilities, he'll be able to float downwards at will, belly flop off the ground, and fling fireballs. 

With a Society of Fiends to face off against, Chris travels the world, taking them out one at a time. Each stage has some kind of gimmick mixed in, as well as a hidden national flag and library book, which will grant you a new power if you retrieve all of them. For example, in the Great Barrier Reef stage, you control a submarine and tow Chris behind, weaving around the obstacles.

[h1]Controls [/h1]
As you obtain new powers, the controls expand. Since you can choose the order that you play the levels in, when you have what abilities won't be the same for everyone. Whilst playing AC with my controller, I didn't notice any problems with misread inputs or lag. Plus, in spite of learning the moves at different intervals, I wasn't mixing them up. 


[h1]Story[/h1]
Many of the characters and ideas in AC are bizarre. For instance, the vampire child blends very immature items like jack-in-the-boxes with wanting to destroy all who oppose him. He wasn't quite as unusual as a kingdom made up of sentient balloons though, whose existence is never really questioned. As Chris interacts with all of these weirdos, he serves somewhat of a straight man, especially with the sometimes savage lines delivered at his expense. If you have a simple sense of humor, you might get a kick out of this game, and I enjoyed some lines and moments myself.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2485479428
[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The visuals in AC are pretty basic looking, making me think of something made in Flash. That's not to say it looks crummy or poorly drawn, but for example, looking at the background of Los Angeles, the city skyline and trees are minimalistic and not very pleasant to look at. Others don't look quite this bad, but none look great either. Foreground elements, such as the NPCs, look considerably better, and the animation is sufficient to look smooth and not jarring. 


[h1]Sound Design[/h1]
I checked the soundtrack for AC on YouTube, and there's a decent number of songs for a game of this length. Most of them are only one or two minutes long though, so they loop upon themselves pretty quickly. However, there's enough variety in the compositions that the music doesn't get stale, or makes you think you've been hearing any of them for too long. Voice acting might have been a nice touch, though with the character designs, I could envision what they would probably sound like: a whiny vampire brat, an Alabaman nerd, a radical balloon, etc. I don't remember any grating sound effects, with the magic attacks sounding appropriate. 


[h1]Pros[/h1]
🌟 It doesn't always work out wonderfully, but the gameplay mechanics based off of balloons works better than I'd have expected. The float-y jumps, navigating on the ceiling, and switching back and forth is well incorporated. Plus, only some of the power-ups are strictly necessary for beating the game, so beating any stage at any time is completely possible. 
🌟 Traveling around the world is treated as somewhat of a bigger deal by the main character, who seems to relish learning about other cultures. Kind of nerdy, but also kind of nice. 
🌟 This wouldn't be a bad choice for a child's game, as it's family-friendly content-wise. Unless you count those oddballs who fetishize stuff like inflation...


[h1]Cons[/h1]
❌ Even if you don't revisit areas to find secrets, there's some level recycling that makes the last hour or so feel repetitive. It's true that this doesn't necessarily include going through the exact same areas, but I still would have liked greater diversity in the last sections. 
❌ Making jokes about Chris being a fat nerd is fine, but they would have had more content to work off of if he had any other traits or interests than school, playing games, and eating. Since that's not the case, it gets beaten to death, un-death, and dead again. 
❌ The learning curve is fairly consistent in AC, but it gets considerably harder near the end. It could cut some people's playthrough short, just before they got to beat the game.


[h1]Tips[/h1]
🔍 It's sensible to get the fire and ice powers early on, as they're projectiles you'll rely on throughout the game. Other stages I might suggest playing sooner than later would include Malaysia, Japan, and Transylvania.
🔍 If you aren't getting enough cookies for all of the upgrades, which you'll want by the time you're getting to the last boss, you can return to easy stages to get more cookies with little effort.
🔍 Switching in and out of inflated mode and maintaining precise control over your character becomes very important, so you'll want to have all of his abilities on lock-down by the end.


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Having beaten AC on the Recommended difficulty level, I'd say that it would be an easy enough experience for those who have a good grasp on platforming games. The late game does ramp up the difficulty, but something that helps the game from getting too frustrating is that each screen transition serves as an in-stage checkpoint, so if you fail in that room, you'll only go back to the start of it. Boss fights were another place where it could get a bit tricky, but they have fairly consistent behavior and patterns, so once you learn how to handle their moves, defeating them isn't too hard. Honestly though, the last boss adds so many complications, I wasn't sure I was going to beat it at first, in part because I forgot that I could float downwards manually. Oops. Either way, it was a relief finishing off vampire kid once and for all, and being able to return home. 

There are factors in the gameplay design that annoyed me more than I might have expected, such as all of the tight corridors with spikes, particularly when indirectly controlling the character and dealing with momentum. Also, although AC didn't take that much time to finish, after beating the six main stages, it seemed as if the game kept dragging on while never getting to the finish line. In spite of some issues though, I overall enjoyed playing through AC, and would recommend it for those who'd want a short platformer.

游戏中玩家将扮演一个有哮喘的小胖子克里斯，和同学们一起被魔王（？）绑架，并被变成了一个气球，为了拯救同样被变成玩具的同学，也为了拯救世界，小胖子克里斯在气球王国整顿之后，冒险开始了。

游戏作为平台跳跃游戏，玩家可以按照任意顺序探索世界9个地点，学习购买多种咒语和技巧来升级克里斯，将克里斯从一个弱小的小胖子变成英雄。

可以学的技能还是比较多的，比如火球，闪电，还可以变成弹力球什么的。

游戏还是可以的，但是这个主角实在是.....越是现实中是肥宅的玩家，就越不愿意玩一个肥宅主角，你是想让玩家幻想自己是一个肥宅英雄吗？

游戏的画面其实还算可以，动画细节比较多，动作也比较流畅。

关卡设计上只能算是普通吧，并不能说有多好玩，难度上的选择比较多，一般难度下，死了直接满血从头复活。如果实在手残，可以选那个不会死的难度。

国区50块的价格稍微有点小贵，我更宁愿花这个钱去买个星露谷，而且同类型的游戏五十块也能买到比本作更好的游戏。

My play time is probably around 8 hours less. I left the game running over night.

Firstly, the good:
* Great graphics
* Nice sound
* Good story line
* Decent power ups / upgrade progression

The Bad:
* The platforming - yep, the whole game mechanic. It has sections of brilliance, and it can be enjoyable at times, overall though, there are too many ""cheap shots"", where you'll be damaged / die because you jumped, and you have to jump to progress. Add to that, there's no way of knowing whether a hole in the floor leads down to another level or death.

The Ugly:
* One hit kills. There are far too many one hit kill sections in the game. It makes the game terribly frustrating at times. I almost quit more than once due to this.
I ended up writing my own trainer, and even with that, the one hit kills persisted, so I found that portion on some levels and disable those too. I'm looking at you Pokebills!

Overall, some segments of the game play ruin the overall fun and enjoyment. It's a pass, but barely. Buy it on sale or in a bundle.

Dev, your core loop was good and fine like, 90% of the time. Your controls were pretty tight for the most part, felt good to move around and some of the platforming was a little brain bendy, which was great! For what the art was, it was well done, some surprisingly nice subtle animations can be found in here, and the soundtrack was good. The only criticism I'd give the game, is with the Japan level. I'm not going to make assumptions on what you were thinking, aside from maybe putting in a difference in the kind of experience. But a sudden section like that (I'll avoid stating it outright to avoid any kind of spoilage) to me at least, was very jarring. It felt like it as the hardest section, but only because the challenge to that level, was so antithetical to what the rest of the game was, so it comes across as unfair.

On the face of it, it looks like a simple platformer, with a gimmick of a portly protagonist, and I was a bit worried at first that this would just pick on that element of him. And, well, it does. But it does it in a way that allows the eponymous Chris to rise above it (pun intended), overcoming his own insecurities to become a hero that those around him didn't think he could be. And the platforming is anything but simple.

The start of the game is humorous, but it quickly establishes early on that you'll be doing more than just punching by presenting a very clever load-out screen that's also a neat reference to a very popular SNES title. You'll be acquiring new abilities throughout the course of the game, and the game does a good job of introducing how they work. Furthermore, they activate quickly and certain ones, especially the movement-based powers, and they reward mastery of them, especially in more difficult fights and the unlocked challenge mode of the game. This game can be especially difficult, but very rarely does it feel unfair. The controls are extremely responsive, providing ways to nimbly navigate arenas, and there are options to mitigate the difficulty if things get too overwhelming. However, this does take me to one minor criticism.

There are parts of the game where the protagonist is tethered and moved around by other entities. I feel bad for criticizing these parts of the game, because the creator clearly did a lot of work to make them function in Unity. The physics of it are realistic between gravity, buoyancy, and pull, but [i]because[/i] it's so realistic, this means dealing with delay and hysteresis, which can be frustrating when twitch responses aren't enough. Coming on the tails of other parts of the game where you have extremely tight response, it can grow a bit frustrating to lose that control. It may take you to the point where you might just tank through the damage in parts rather than try to figure out the physics or memorize the layout of hazards. But individually levels segments are short enough where death feels like a teaching experience rather than a setback, and you have infinite lives, similar to Celeste for those familiar with that game.

Storywise, the characters you meet are charming. Chris and the main antagonist are very memorable, and you can't help but root for Chris as he struggles and grows. I might not say as much about other individuals you rescue in the first part of the game, but they show their personalities if you talk to them--and on that note, NPCs typically have more than one line of dialogue if you choose to talk to them. The game has a neat sense of lore if you opt to explore it, but you're not forced into it. It did have me wishing I could explore more of it. For a game that looks so silly on the face of it, it doesn't pull its punches when they don't need pulling.

Lastly, the game offers replayability in the form of the aforementioned challenge mode (which also offers unique dialogue that breaks the fourth wall [i]after[/i] you've had a chance to experience the story proper), and a director's commentary mode which may be of interest to individuals interest in the game design experience. If there's an option to replay fights against bosses, I haven't yet found it--if it is absent presently in the game, it would be a really nice feature (mostly because that optional boss is super fun, and I'd like to keep fighting them.)

Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this game. It offers elegant gameplay challenges while not being overly punitive with them, it works in charming homages to earlier generations of gaming that aren't obtuse or overdone, and it features a likable underdog character whose reluctant rise to the position of hero doesn't feel forced.

From the moment you turn on the game the first thing that is apparent immediately is that you are in for a great musical experience (more about that in the 2nd paragraph). Once you choose your difficulty (I chose story so I could unlock other options) you are ready for your adventure! After some brief introductory levels that show Chris has some lets say ""limiting factors"" when it comes to platforming we gain our first ability to float and start off on our journey to save children, befriend balloons and learn geography as an added bonus! Whats a real treat when it comes to game design is you can go to any level in any order and can leave any time just by floating up into the sky! To say anymore I think would spoil the fantastic story created here, so I will leave you with this...everything in this game has a purpose and a reason for being. Just like our character Chris!

Speaking of everything having a purpose this game's OST is not only beautiful, it's extremely well thought out. I could tell immediately after the title screen that I was going on an adventure and each accompanying musical arrangement really sold the experience for each level. Each time I thought I couldn't be surprised by what I was listening to there would be another layer added that delightfully caught me off guard. For example in the Brazil level after a little while pan flutes showed up! That honestly happened pretty frequently throughout my experience with the game and it was such a joy to experience. I highly recommend you get the OST because it was truly one of the biggest highlights while playing this game!

So after completing this game in a span of 10 hrs straight (and eating too many chocolate chip cookies...dang subliminal messaging!) I must say that this has been one amazing experience I will always cherish! This game surprised me on not only its ability to connect with my own childhood, but also with my quirky style of humor. It definitely throws you back to the 90's in a way not many games have the ability to. From the music, to the character design and all of the wonderful writing it was an adventure!

The fat child of Mega Man X and A Boy and His Blob:
A Boy And His Bloat DX

I streamed The Adventures of Chris for five hours with a friend and we never tired of seeing Chris punch enemies off screen - yes, the enemies blast off wildly in the opposite direction. Perhaps it was even more satisfying seeing the various death sequences (Chris pathetically collapsing to the ground with his glasses breaking and falling next to him or popping like a fat-child-balloon).

The premise is simple. A husky boy from Alabama gets abducted by balloons on his way home from school and has to save said balloon kingdom, consuming cookies as currency and milkshakes as health along the way. 

Throughout the various DuckTales/Mega Man like stages, Chris learns various abilities, and what can I say?  We all bloat down here.  Chris dashes, bloats and blasts his way through like a champ.  He harnesses the power of bloat for good.  Unfortunately, the developers missed an opportunity by not including a “cholesterol bomb” attack or weakness that Chris might succumb to.

The game seems deceptively easy towards the beginning. There are many checkpoints and you can power through the platform sections by taking many hits without consequence. (I have not tried ""Mean Mode"" yet). Then in other sections you have to die repeatedly before you figure out how to proceed.

Boss fights on the other hand feel unbalanced at times and almost like an afterthought. Boss attack patterns are non-existent.

Though I'm not yet close to finishing the game, I can already tell that this gives it significant replay value.

The game is in no way a retread of its inspirations though. It builds on them, and also introduces a dynamic I've never seen before by giving the player character the ability to float a certain number of times before having to return to the ground. This opens up the game's environment by, for example, enabling you to walk along a ceiling. The added maneuverability enabled the creators to play around with truly unique level design - something I really appreciate. Also, don't let the cartoony design aesthetic fool you. This game is hard. But not in a malicious sort of way. You need to practice, and it's designed to let you do that easily. Despite the difficulty, I've not once felt frustrated. And when you overcome a challenge, it feels all the more satisfying.

Design aside, AoC, as I wrote at the top of this review, is just plain fun, with everything coming together in a pitch perfect manner. The look and feel. The music. And the _script_.

Adventures of Chris is a fun retro-style platformer designed to be both fun and engaging to modern audeniences while providing a healthy dose of nostalgia to those who remember decades past.

I found that the game excels in both of these regards. It has charming characterisation despite its simply premise, and the balloon folk are incredibly adorable (especially Dave - both myself and my chat loved Dave).

I know it's quite cliché to say, but this game honestly reminded me of Dark Souls in some respects. Each section of a stage has automatic checkpoints, so dying doesn't lose you a tonne of progress (though you have to re-grab every cookie -the in-game currency for upgrades- in that section) but as a result you do have to learn the patterns of the enemies. The boss fights in particular have that same quality- you die over and over as you learn the dance of the fight.

My one criticism comes in here, and that is that this game requires some balancing. I was playing on the recommended Normal difficulty (the game has two levels below this, but they do not allow you to unlock achievements, and one level harder) and the game threw enemies at you in such as fast and brutal manner that Chris' limited lives where gone insanely fast.  Even my chat, which was full of gamers far better at platformer than I commented that the Chile level in particular was incredibly brutal for the difficulty level, and I never managed to beat its boss, with my viewers commenting that they felt it needed a lot less health to balance it.

Despite this, clearing each section did feel rewarding as a result, and definitely reminded me of the platformers of the 90s and early 00s where quality of life was lacking, and rather than hold your hand the game would break your hand and use it to smack you in the face.

However, my best praise for this game is that, even when invoking the retro vibe, AoC does not fall into the trap of stripping out beneficial quality of life improvements. The game teaches you each mechanic in a sensible and logical manner, and includes a lot of other nice features: the aforementioned auto-checkpoints, the clearly marked level checkpoints which allow you to return back to the hub to buy upgrades, once you've seen the intro cutscene to a boss fight and die you don't have to sit through the scene again when you re-enter the room, smooth controller support for my Xbox One controller, clean vector graphics, and penguins with lazers.

Oh did I not mention that? THIS GAME HAS PENGUIN ENEMIES WHO FIRE LAZERS AT YOU.

Adventures of Chris is a 1990s inspired platforming adventure with great humor, a awesome soundtrack and amazing artwork. While it draws a lot of inspiration from the classics, it manages to do its own thing with style.
What might look like a simple platformer at first glance will soon prove to be a hard but fair gaming experience depending on your difficulty settings and will give you a storyline that is easy to love and dream oneself into.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You start off with a fun intro, followed by a helpful tutorial that both teaches you the controls and explain the story further.
What makes Adventures of Chris stick out even more from the huge pile of platformers out there is that once you are done with intro and tutorial, you are free to play the main levels in whatever order you want.
The levels all offers different themes and power-ups or collectibles to obtain to assist Chris on his journey.
In terms of difficulties, AoC is quick to deliver four different settings right off the bat, ranging from can't die (Ridiculously Easy) to take twice as much damage (Hard For No Reason) and it doesn't end there as most power-ups in the game are completely optional, giving the player the option to finish the game with min%.
Once you finish Story Mode you will unlock Hard Mode and here the game shines even brighter than before. Harder jumps, tougher bosses and more enemies are just some examples of what changes in this mode.
A third mode, Dev Commentary mode can also be unlocked and takes you on a trip down developer lane with Chris explaining challenges, inspirations and much more about the game.

The game is impressively well polished and while the it offers rebinding for the controls, i found it working tremendously as is.


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Now in the end, what i love most about Adventures of Chris is how it brings back the fun of retro gaming, yes it can be frustrating at the harder settings but it feels so good to have a real modern retro game to just enjoy.
And isn't that what gaming should be all about? To have fun.",1602461061,1627218888,True,6,0,0.591948866844177246,1,True,False,False,False,,,

My favorite game as a kid was MegaMan X, and this game is a worthy homage to the style. The gameplay is interesting and fun. Some of the bosses are pretty tough, but I think the challenge was just about right. There aren't any game overs or cheap losses, so the game is very fair.

The best part of the game is the writing, music, and artwork. In the game, Chris is a chubby kid, but the jokes make you laugh WITH him, not AT him. I really appreciate that. The soundtrack is great.
