I think it captures the intensity of taking on a bunch of orders, organizing them in your head, and multi-tasking pouring to minimize the wait. It can actually get quite stressful which is a really neat aspect.

A few things could be better. The bar is organized in a weird fashion, the wine glasses are super glitchy (when you try to grab one, a million pop out like confetti), and the fact that you just click play and go for as long as you can. I would have appreciated a sort of ""campaign mode"" where you have to make it through specific length shifts. Clicking a button to kick everyone out of the bar at the drop of a hat once you're done playing is just is a minor immersion breaking thing at the end of the day though.

The development is dead as far as I'm aware which is a shame. Regardless, this is definitely a fun tool to learn drink recipies. 1000x better than Bartender VR Simulator, and much cheaper.",1708060231,1708060231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

カクテルを学ぶという点ではよいと思います。練習にはならないかも。

良い点
割とバーテンダーできるので楽しい。
操作感は悪くなく、モノを投げたりするのも思い通りにできる。
レシピの数も多く基本のレシピを知るにはよい。
客から注文を受けた時も、そのレシピを表示する機能があり、詰むことがない。
日本語はないがなんとなくわかるので多分大丈夫。（cognac:コニャックだけ一瞬わからなくなる。ＸＯと書いてある瓶）

悪い点
カウンターファイトのようなゲームを期待していると微妙。バーテンダーとして働いて、新しいお酒や店の装飾を購入していくのが目的のようだが、設定からすべてアンロックできてしまう。また客からの注文には時間制限がない様で、ノロノロ作ることができる。
グラスやお酒を手で取る必要があるが、コントローラでの移動はできないようで実際に部屋の中で移動しないといけない。そのため狭い部屋だと壁にぶつかることある。4m×4m程度の何もない空間が確保できれば大丈夫だと思う。
レモンジュースとライムジュースが分かりにくい。（それぞれカットレモンとカットライムをもってグリップボタンを押し込みで搾れる）
ＶＲでは難しいのだとはおもうがビルドとシェイクしかない。ステアはビルドになっている。ブレンド系はなさそう。

総評
悪い点をそこそこ上げたが、カクテルを作るという点はよくできていると思う。
ステアも脳内補完すれば良いだけなので問題ない。
カクテルを作ったことない人でも、カクテルが好きなならやってみる価値があると思う。",1663171442,1663171845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I never thought I would like bartending, never mind be addicted it. Started late last night, played until I passed out and then started playing again today.

Pros:
-Very intutitive to learn.
-Fun for casual players and bartenders alike.
-Custom music and recipies can be added.


Cons:
-Lack of enviromental variety. You get the main bar and a tiki bar. You can unlock decorations for both, but they can only be placed in one location.
-Everything can be unlocked within a few hours of play. I am rolling in more money than Escobar 6 hours in the game and I have nothing to spend it on.

Conclusion: At $15 I say this game is worth the price and it will be a favourite in my library for the forseeable future.

Remember when that young man went on to introduce an annoyingly catchy beachboys tune to the world and where every bar and night club had these clowns flipping bottles and making fancy cocktails to the yuppie muppets who frequented these hell holes.

Well, unfortunately, I even went to a local night club called cocktails and dreams, not my proudest moments but as a late teen male, you go where the hot chicks are.

Anyway, relive your cocktail dreams in this game, flipping shakers, making exotic cocktails and hit on the tail that orders these drinks. (tail what Bryan Brown would call pussy back in the un-pc 80s)

Good amount of options, purchase new stock to make more outlandish cocktails and drinks. Have frustrated customers as you fuck up their order time and time again. Be completely ignored as you try to hit on the customers. Add new furniture and glasses etc as your mini-kingdom grows.

I am actually a pretty experienced Barman having worked in bars a lot when I was a young man.  I even had a few little moves I liked to perform whilst serving, nothing like Cocktail the movie but swish enough :-)

So with that in mind, I came into this game expecting to compare it to my own real life experience behind a bar and within 15 minutes I had fallen back into my barman's upbeat chitchat pita pata; much to my own surprise! lol.


 Negatives
========
There was a single written swear word which I felt was unnecessary, swearing can be funny and I know this is an adults game; but in the example I experienced, it just seemed out of place and unnecessary.

Other than that I found that picking stuff up off of the floor was very problematic, but I have experienced this in other games too so it might be a config of my VR on this point.  (Just mentioned it in case)

The Drink dispenser device is too easy to accidentally swap to another drink, either lock it as soon as drink is poured or use the trigger to pour and not the stick.


 Positives
=======
I loved it, what a load of fun, lots of laughs and I barely even started playing!!!

The characters are pretty good to look at, realistic enough and swearing aside the chat is pretty funny too.

Great music (I liked it) a good all round experience, kinda looking forward to the customers interacting with the pool table etc..

Very authentic barman experience.


 FINAL THOUGHTS
==============
I don't know how much depth this game has, how long will it be before characters repeat themselves?  How many drinks are available and how busy can it get?

I like the pricing structure to be a little more realistic as I managed to buy all Decor Items after just 30mins of gameplay.  I would actually like a bit more of a realistic management aspect to it, rent premises and have to pay the bills etc...Work up to buying a bigger premises, more seating and perhaps food in the future! OK I'm getting a little carried away there.

Overall I enjoyed the experience a lot!  I felt like I was in a bar serving people drinks, and I barely unlocked anything so I hope that the drinks get more complicated and more outlandish too.

Despite what I said about the swearing customer having rude customers might funny, and perhaps have to bar people if they have had a few too many (responsible barmanship).

Excellent game, works very, very well and I hope more content is included than I have experienced and I hope more content is to come :-)

Love the recipes, the atmosphere, game mechanics..already learning how to make my first cocktails! :)
Although one drawback is I keep knocking the glass out of my hand and drop it on the floor/drop it in the ice basket as I wave my arms about busily serving up drinks!
Ended up spending a lot of time looking for things I dropped :(
The ice basket especially - I know I probably shouldnt do it this way but scooping ice into the cup by dunking the cup in the ice basket made me lose the cup in the basket very very often. Other than that, if i accidentally pass my hand through the counter with cup in hand, the cups drops somewhere again.
Also, would be nice if we could remove wrong garnishes.

These are minor details though. Overall love the game, great experience!

Also, would it be possible to have the option of using one of those measuring cup things? And a musher for the mojito mbe?

There are many, many drinks to choose from that follow the official drink making guidelines, and you are rewarded for making drinks accurately by getting money for correct orders that you can use to unlock more drinks. You even have the option of making your own drinks and editing the existing drinks, which only adds to the fun factor.

While the drink making aspect is complex, my only complaint so far is the progression system. So far, it's easy enough to make about sixty drinks in the bartending mode before you have enough money to unlock every drink and glass available in the game, which can cause a reasonably large difficulty spike once you go back in and try bartending again since the AI will ask for any drink you have unlocked.

For the record 3 ozs of Whisky for a Jack and Coke is one helluva strong drink and I wouldn't give that out to customers unless I knew for certain they were responsible.

　　游戏比较休闲娱乐，吧台周围的全部用具都可以自由使用。玩家需要根据提示进行调酒的工作，任务的要求几乎需要精确到用什么类型的杯子以及酒水的配比，对玩家细微的操作精确度都有要求。
　　不过游戏除了调酒以外就没什么比较有意思玩法，就只能一直调配各种各样的鸡尾酒，感觉游戏更像是花式鸡尾酒的教学课程了，玩法什么的还有待增加。
　　目前《调酒师》在steam上售价为43元。比起同类的调酒游戏，《调酒师》胜在酒水种类比较齐全，各种柠檬、橙子、樱桃之类的调味水果以及各式各样的酒杯都应有尽有，不过只能当个模拟游戏体验，玩家们需要谨慎考虑购买。

The pouring physics work pretty well, the graphics are okay, background music is nice, and the layout is good.  

That being said, it has a long way to go before it becomes a functional ""game"", I think, as all there is now is pouring drinks, earning money, and then unlocking more drinks.  It needs something to make it more of a game, like levels.  Time trials, maybe, or levels of increasing difficulties in which you fail if you pour drinks wrong too many times or too slowly.  

I'd also love to see options to hide the recipes for the drinks, or maybe a ""hard"" mode of the aforementioned levels in which the recipes are hidden and you have to create from knowledge.  Hiding the amount poured (over the glasses and such) would be cool too, especially if the physics of the drink were improved a bit.  I feel like if I tip the glass the drink should fall out, and I shouldn't be able to pour in liquids with the glass upside down or sideways.  Graphics seem a bit lackluster too, they don't feel as crisp as in other games even with supersampling up quite a bit.  Various graphics preset options would be good to have in the settings menu, as well as antialiasing settings.

Cons 

--right now are the sliders for adjusting height and position need to go and be replaced with something else, it's a pain to adjust one slider but then when clicking on the next one it resets the first slider position.
--Glasses/cups should be right-side up when picking them up, not always upside-down no matter what orientation your controllers are.
--When mixing, there should be an option to list what amount of each ingredient you've already put in, instead of having the oz total accumulate. For example, if it calls for X oz of tequila, X oz of triple sec, X oz of lemon juice, when you mix have each one on a separate line. 1.5oz of tequila, and next line underneath says 1.5 oz of triple sec, and next line with 1.0 oz of lemon juice. The system in place right now it's sometimes difficult on the fly to be like oh crap how much of what is already in there, it just says 6.xx oz so far.",1495250872,1495251235,True,16,1,0.701113283634185791,2,True,False,True,False,,,

Couple notes,
-if a drink is on fire and you throw it, it should tooootally expolde. sad that it didnt.
-the bottles come back when you throw them or put them in the trash, but the soda fountain does not. Problem.
-there should eventually be an accuracy mode where the drinks actually spill when tipped. But only as an option because i can also see the merit in the way it is now.
-When I adjust the x/y position and/or height, it doesn't always stay that way. sometimes changing one slider will reset the others and sometimes going back to the menu will reset them.
-There should also be a mode for ""just whiskey drinks"" or ""just drinks with lemon juice,"" ""just drinks in a martini glass"" etc, to help those who are using this to learn.
That's all the problems I've found so far, very very solid game and I look forward to the day that I can walk into a bar, ask for a job, and say that I was trained entirely in VR.
