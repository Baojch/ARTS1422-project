Ultimately, Bocce Revolution requires a combination of precision and good timing in order to achieve strong results. There is the option to play either against the computer, or locally with a second player.

While a long way from being the flashiest sports title on Steam, being very much a no-frills product, it doesn't need to be; Bocce Revolution is a straightforward game, ideal for enjoying on an occasional basis, away from the worries of getting involved in anything overly complex. The commentator is... an acquired taste, admittedly, but there's a certain charm about the, almost unnecessarily, enthusiastic dialogue combined with the comparatively soporific delivery that I find amusing, it just seems so on-point for this particular game (some might use the phrase ""so bad it's good!"").

In the long line of accessible sports games that use a power meter to simulate how much force you're applying to a ball, it's not a comfortable thought that Bocce Revolution is leading the vanguard into the future. 

That isn't to say that this is a terrible game. If you want nothing more than to play bocce with a friend or against the computer, and to play either a single game or a best-out-of-five tournament, then have at it. God knows the market is underserving the bocce crowd. 

On the other hand, $20 for this seems really steep because all there is are those two modes and some physics that don't quite feel right. Maybe I'm wrong about the physics, maybe they're fine, maybe it's just that there isn't any sound effect for when the ball is rolling across the court. Maybe it's that the aiming line seems to be consistently off, somewhere between five and ten degrees to the right of the ball's actual path. 

Maybe it isn't the physics as much as it is the crowd's triangle faces, and the two textures and hairstyles that are recolored and repeated across them. Maybe it's that there is only one court and it's inside, and there are windows that look out onto a blue sky of a strange hue. Maybe it's that the only sounds in the game are the kind-of-loud music, the interface sound effects, an announcer who says bizarre things like ""the competitors have the sport carved from their DNA"", and the occasional knock of wood-on-wood when a ball hits another ball. Maybe it's that the crowd is silent and motionless. Maybe it's that when you pitch your ball, your sportsman goes through the motion up to the point where the ball would leave his hand, and then instead of leaving his hand it actually teleports to a starting point somewhere below it and [i]then[/i] starts rolling. 

Maybe it's that the singleplayer is against the same AI player forever, just a single AI stuck inside some man in an orange tracksuit. I can play a single game against him, or I can play a tournament against him, but it's always him. Maybe it's that the multiplayer is only local, as if I wanted to sit in my room with my friend and play a game of bocce that is stuck inside another room, one filled with a blankly staring audience and an announcer who remains professional in spite of obviously losing his mind. 

Maybe it's that the court looks totally flat, but seems to have a slight concavity towards the center.

+ A variety of way you can throw the ball

- I felt like the gameplay was too simple
- AI difficulty was a bit too high, my opponent always seemed to get incredibly close to being perfect
- The audience are a bunch of props who don't move or cheer

The graphics are pretty bad. They are reminiscent of the PS2 era of games. 

Gameplay is what really matters though. The gameplay is decent but has some issues. The gameplay works fine but it is not very challenging or engaging. The game uses a simple power meter and has nothing to determine accuracy. Since the power meter has little symbols on it that indicates the position of the balls already in play you don't really even need to guess how much power to put into a throw. 

If you really want a Bocce ball game you may have some fun with Bocce Revolution. Otherwise I would stay away from the game. 

Note: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.
