I was one of the ""fortunates"" who played this game on NES in the 1980's when it released. My sister and I worked our way through it side-by-side. We were just about 6 and 8 years old, on the couch sharing a Nintendo controller, with nothing but a child's sense of wonderment to guide us. This was not an easy game for us. But we loved it. It challenged us to discover, punished us when we failed, and forced us younglings to be more observant and creative in our attempts to solve each new ""dead end."" Its one of the handful of games her and I can still mention at any time and say to each other ""Remember Shadowgate? Yeah, that game was one of the greats.""  
  
Well, its not the 80's anymore. Its 2024. All of my memories of this game are from 30+ years ago. I haven't touched it since. So when I saw it on sale for $3.74 I thought to myself ""buying at this price is the least I could do to give thanks to these devs for keeping alive such a Great Adventure once adored by a couple of kids.""   
  
So I bought it and turned it on... if only to give a quick curious look at that memorable first door... before continuing my adventure elsewhere on what could be 2024's GOTY: Dragons Dogma 2. Well, I think that other adventure is going to have to wait a bit longer then expected. I've only just turned on Shadowgate, been in 3 separate areas/rooms, but the vibe the game is creating has me immediately wanting more. The music is fantastic. Fit for a fantasy. The recreated graphics remind me of art you'd find on Magic The Gathering playing cards. I don't want to play it right now, I need to. I just can't wait to see if my adult self is as clever as the dynamic duo of children who played this gem so many years ago. Oh, and I've forgotten almost everything. I guess I still am one of the ""fortunate ones.""",1712048820,1712048820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This could be seen as a positive, and perhaps it somewhat is, because it feels like a 90's dungeon crawler.
You could also see it as a serious downside is my guess if you don't have played these kind of games back in the days. 
But even for the ones that played and loved things like Elvira, dungeon master and Eye of the Beholder, are going to feel like this is like the old classics  but not entirely. 
It all is amusing but it is the game that is missing the dots on the letter ""i"".

I would probably rate this for what this game is and it's budget.
I say 6,5 out of 10 points because in it's core the game feels like an android or IOS mobile game.

The different difficulties expand upon the puzzles, items and even rooms so what was easy to solve at the easiest difficulty but end up being a more complicated puzzle requiring more items and searching. Higher difficulties also have a timer mechanic where your torches will eventually burn out. This was again part of the original game and 'tough adventure' design.

So again, good game for what it is, a re-imagining of the original Shadowgate.

Though the original game was a MacVenture game - a point and click adventure series that had an odd window-based interface on the Mac's desktop - most people at the time didn't have a computer at home.  Computers at home, whether PC or Mac, were pretty rare and the Internet wasn't a thing.  The home console market crashed hard as well and it was Nintendo that single-handedly revived it with its NES and now-draconian ""Seal of Quality"" process to ensure that people were no longer tricked into buying unlicensed shovelware.  However, much of the market for the first two years were arcade ports or similar short-run quarter-munching style of games, especially action platformers that retrospectively coined the term ""Nintendo Hard"".  So a couple years into the NES' insanely popular run, Shadowgate dropped out of nowhere and provided an experience that nobody had seen before.  In a sea of run-n-guns, platformers, sword and sorcery action games, here was this unique-looking game split into several windows for menu, inventory, and wonderfully-detailed graphics that you wouldn't find in twitchier fare.  It didn't matter that it was insanely difficult and killed you repeatedly without warning, nor did it matter that the puzzles were obtuse and favored trial-and-error over logic; Shadowgate was unusually different than the rest of the market and for many people, its unique gameplay coupled with its haunting music was captivating, whether you were taking a chance on a blind buy or more likely you were renting it from your local video store.

It's difficult to express why this remake by Zojoi attracted a lot of attention because from any other perspective, the overall design of the game is archaic.  For veterans, part of the fun is simply how they subverted expectations, but ultimately the game is as obtuse as it has ever been.  Despite revisiting several of the puzzles and redoing them, changing sequences of events and outright overhauling certain areas, the game is still solidly anchored to trial-and-error and save scumming.  It's the only way you're going to complete the game without following someone else's guide, but some would argue that's also part of its charm.  By today's standards, most people would take a dump on this game precisely for the same reasons why people enjoy it.

Shadowgate is firmly rooted in the Us vs. Them era, when developers made it a point to harass and obstruct players from completing their game rather than gently guiding them on sight-seeing tours.  To finish Shadowgate on your own is an achievement of colossal proportions because a good portion of it is impossible to figure out without save scumming and risking countless deaths.  That's just what we did back in the day.  In fact, a lot of the time we couldn't even save because battery backups in a cart were expensive, so you just took extensive notes and tried again all the way from the beginning if need be because it really was Us vs. Them and we weren't about to lose!

I realize I'm reviewing this game almost a decade after it released, but I'm sure there's a good number of people who don't know it exists, but have fond memories of spending countless nights listening to familiar haunting jingles while the game actively sought to kill them.  For those folks, this version of Shadowgate is well and truly worthy of the name, if somewhat lacking the original's charm.  It's mainly why it took me so long to get to it.  Thrusting myself back into that mentality and hunkering down to take on the challenge was a daunting proposition that dissuaded me from actually doing it.

For everyone else, this game is an absolutely frustrating exercise.  Anyone expecting or looking for a casual, chill narrative adventure through an ancient castle can turn right around and walk out the door.  This game does not reward curiosity whatsoever.  More often than not, poking your head where it doesn't belong is a good way to lose it, perhaps even unfairly.  Unless explicitly telegraphed, there's no way to know if you're going to suddenly be met with a Game Over or why on earth you might want to carry 20 human skulls (protip: you don't.  A few is enough!).  All of the keys you find are unlabelled.  The spells you learn are just gibberish words with no way of knowing what they do until you find the place where they are actually used.  Remember that thing you saw in an early room that you couldn't get several hours ago?  You better.  Every action you take except for looking at things (an improvement over the original, actually), costs time measured in torches and if you're not using a guide at all, running out of torches poses a real risk.  I should also mention that you have to manually keep them lit because letting them go dark means you trip and break your neck.  I'm not kidding.

Shadowgate goes against all established adventure game procedure.  Do -not- pick everything up that's not bolted down.  Don't open every door.  Most certainly do not try everything you can and hope it works because Adventure Game Moon Logic.... sort of.  Like I said before, completing the game is heavily dependent on save scumming.  It's expected.  The game is 100% going to kill you for simply trying something out.  Repeatedly.  Save before doing something even remotely questionable.  Save before doing something entirely mundane.  Save multiple slots because guess what?  That banshee curse isn't going to cure itself and haha, you're definitely not going to cure it until much, much later, if at all.  Maybe you'll just die.  You probably will.

So for the modern point and click enthusiast, I can only say you'e got your work cut out for you if you want to dive into this nostalgic piece of work.  The art is serviceable if somewhat unrefined and lacks the pixel charm of the original.  The remixed music fades into the background and takes a less prominent role than it did on the NES.  The interface is even arguably worse than the original's on-screen action menu.  But this is a dyed-in-the-wool old school adventure game challenge with an old school adventure game mentality.  If you can wrap your head around it and understand where it comes from, the game becomes a much more palatable experience and is only forgivable in that context.  As a modern design, it arguably fails in every aspect, but since it is rooted in the original 80s release, it would have been disingenuous to  make it any other way.  That's what Shadowgate is and must be.

This version of Shadowgate is a rare revisiting of an older title that doesn't seek to change its fundamental identity.  It is purposely designed to be obtuse, illogical, and frustrating.  Yet it's also quite rewarding to the persistent player and while the narrative is standard fantasy fare, it all ties into a lore that the designer's been carrying around in his head for 30+ years and has been explored in sequels like Shadowgate64 and the upcoming do-over of Beyond Shadowgate (which leans heavily on the retro design, so look out for it).  But it's mostly about just giving him the finger because that's what he wants you to do.  He doesn't want to show you all the pretty pictures; he wants you to earn it.  You don't get rewarded for just following along and doing as you're told; you're only rewarded when you use the system against itself as you circumvent every death with a well-timed save, taking note of things and working your way through stuff the hard way, only to load when you've figured out the solution so you can save precious time.

The more Shadowgate hates you, the more you may come to love it.  The heart of the original beats in its chest and it's arguably lesser, but ultimately still the same experience with a new coat of paint. Just know that the water isn't warm and you're going to die.

I apparently got this game as part of a cheap bundle back in 2016- and to be honest, this is the only way I recommend getting this game. As part of a cheap bundle or at a seriously deep discount. (And yes, the fact that I got this as a CD Key somewhere means my review has no bearing on overall review score- so I am going with a Positive review rather than Negative.)

I never played the original game- never heard of it, as far as I can remember. 
It has Trading Cards- if you are a Completionist, you may just want to idle the game for the cards- the achievement unlock %s are rather low on this game, and to be honest, I don;t feel like that's because of difficulty- it's because you may have needed to play this game when it was a ""cult favorite"" back on NES to know what to do and where to go without having to blindly try to click your way through a few thousands clicks.

The map is huge- lots of rooms, lots of backtracking, lots of text boxes you have to click through over and over and over each time you revisit a room you've been in dozens of time already. No real fast travel- a few teleports that you will only use a few times- no fast travel using the map itself. My inventory seems to keep doing strange things and re-arranging things, which is frustrating (when I know the bar was in the third row, but it is now in the top row... huh.)
There are guides- use them, but expect some things to be inaccurate or different than what you see in your own game- mirror room, for example. The Apprentice Mode guide shows 6 mirrors in the room, while I only have 4 in the game. I haven't been following the guide step by step- only using it when I get lost on the huge map or am insure what Yorick's repeated hints actually mean. But I guess if you do things out of order, certain items don't appear, or they appear in different places, or the author may have gotten different difficulty modes mixed up.

The music is appropriate, but seriously repetitive and a tad annoying at times. The ""This music means you are in danger, girl!"" music when I am just sitting and looking around a room I have already looked around and cleared is a bit out of place for me.
The art is fairly typical for a Point & Click adventure from 10 years ago, similar to most HOGs/HOPAs too- don't expect intricate animations or photo-realistic graphics. 
Runs fine out of the box on Windows 10 22H2 on a decently beefy gaming desktop with an i9 11900K, 32 GB DDR4 RAM and a 3080 RTX ti. No hitching, no stutters, no tweaking needed. Also ran well on my older desktop with an i9-9900K, 16 GB DDR4 RAM and a 2070 RTX Super.  Could probably run on a toaster.

The save system is fine- make lots of saves in case you missed something or died- the gear icon in the upper right corner of the screen lets you save almost anywhere.

Don't expect high-action or any mind-bending battles- it's alright for playing short sessions and killing time- if you use a guide (if you never played the original game).

Spielzeit: ca. 6 Stunden
Spieldurchläufe: 1 (Ende)

Eines der schönsten Adventures, die ich je gespielt habe. Aber auch sehr schwer.

Normalerweise sind die meisten Spiele in ihrer Story und Präsentation bestensfalls Mittelmaß, aber Shadowgate hat mich völlig sprachlos gemacht. Die Einführung, die wunderbare Graphik, die Inszenierung, das ist Gänsehaut. Auch das Ende schließt eine passende Klammer. 

Dazwischen liegt ein völlig aufpoliertes Remake eines Klassikers aus den späten 1980ern (!!!). Irgendwie ist dieses Original auch in meiner Bibliothek gelandet, aber ich konnte mich einfach nicht überwinden es auch nur länger als 10 Minuten (!) zu spielen. Es ist einfach wirklich ZU alt, zu aus der Zeit gefallen. Damn, was für Sprünge wir gemacht haben. Es ist wirklich schön zu sehen, dass solche Klassiker so würdevoll manchmal ihren Weg zurück zu uns finden. Viele Menschen hätten vermutlich niemals Shadowgate ohne dieses Remake gespielt, ich zumindest zähle mich dazu. 

Ein Feature in der Neuauflage ist die F1 Taste, um die Graphik ""auf alt"" zu machen. Ob das wirklich die realistische Ursprungsgraphik der frühen 1990er Jahre auf Mac oder iOs war, keine Ahnung, aber es vermittelt einen tollen Eindruck.

Aber was ist mit dem Spiel selbst? Nun, ich denke, es ist schwer, aber nicht frustrierend schwer. Einen Großteil, ca. 70-80%, konnte ich selber rausbekommen. Der Rest teilt sich in die beiden Kategorien: D'oh auf, wo man das Gefühl hat, dass das Spiel in seiner Logik einfach dumm ist und unmöglich, wo man selbst nie draufgekommen wäre. Ohne die Hilfe von außen, Steam hat tolle Guides, wäre ich hier sicher niemals weitergekommen und hätte aufgegeben, aber die Zeiten, in denen man nach 30 Minuten frustrierender Suche einfach ""am nächsten Tag mit frischen Augen wiederkommt"" sind bei mir zumindest irgendwie vorbei. 

Dass das Spiel ""nur"" 6 Stunden Umfang hat, ist sicher ein zweischneidiges Schwert. Ich lasse das hier mal unkommentiert. 

Was ich sehr, sehr schade finde, und da bin ich sicher nicht allein, ist die Tatsache, dass die Entwickler im Abspann einen Nachfolger anteasern, der nur 2 Jahre nach Veröffentlichung, 2016 (!) herauskommen sollte. Nun, vielleicht hätte man sich lieber auf einen Trailer reduzieren sollen, aber in Wahrheit passiert ist: Nichts. Dieses Spiel werden wir wahrscheinlich niemals sehen.

Nachdem ich auf ""klassisch / Geselle"" meine Probleme hatte (Rätsel sind knifflig, Tode häufig und es gibt Unmengen Items mit denen man nichts anzufangen weiß) habe ich es im ""Normal""-Modus probiert, der noch unter dem niedrigsten Schwierigkeitsgrad des klassischen Spieles liegt.

Da ist es dann fast zu einfach, weil man viel weniger Bausteine benötigt um das passende Item zu erhalten und überhaupt sehr wenig Items benötigt um Rätsel zu lösen.
Die Rätseldichte ist viel geringer und man stirbt deutlich weniger, weil das Spiel mehr Fehler verzeiht.

Das macht aber – vorallem wenn man weiß, wieviel Potential in den höheren Schwierigkeitsgraden steckt – auch deutlich weniger Spaß.
Denn dann ist „Shadwogate“ kaum herausfordernd und bietet kaum noch die Gene-typischen Kombinationsmöglichkeiten eines Point&Click-Games.
Man hebt die fertigen Gegenstände auf, öffnet damit etwas und setzt seinen Weg fort.

Ich werde nach diesem Low-Level-Durchgang das Spiel noch einmal auf einem höheren Schwierigkeitsgrad spielen, um mehr Spielerlebnis zu erfahren.

Was aber selbst in der gemäßigtesten Version des Spieles vorhanden ist, sind die hervorragenden handgezeichneten Cut-Scense im düsteren Fantasy-Comic-Stil.

Der Sound es Spieles ist atmosphärisch dicht, die Vertonung professionell, weshalb man das Geschehen auch ernst nimmt.

Ich finde die Grafik angemessen düster und für ein Fantasty-Point&Click passend.
Szenen und Räume sind abwechslungsreich gestaltet und – je nach Schwierigkeitsgrad – voller Items.
Auf Wunsch kann man diese mit F2 auch aufleuchten lassen.

Das ganze Spiel macht einen „Erwachsenen“ Eindruck und stammt ursprünglich aus einer Zeit, wo solche Spiele für Erwachsene oder Gamer, die sich „durchbeißen“ gemacht wurden.
Demzufolge sollte man sich darauf einstellen, dass man bei „Shadowgate“ oft scheitert, viel herumirrt und sterben kann.
„Shadowgate“ erfordert also eine hoch entwickelte Frustrationstoleranz.
Diese läßt sich aber an den Spielemodus anpassen. 

Ein Unding ist allerding, dass die Entwickler es immer noch nicht geschafft haben den Save-Bug zu beheben.
Viele Spieler, so auch ich, mussten feststellen, dass das Spiel gar nicht speichert, wenn man F5 (Quick-Save) drückt oder einen Speicher-Slot aktiviert. 
(Sehr frustrierend wenn man nach mehreren Spielstunden stirbt und dann feststellt, dass es überhaupt keinen Spielstand gibt, welchen man laden kann. Dies war auch der Grund warum ich den ""Gesellen-Modus"" abgebrochen habe, weil ich sowieso noch mal ganz von Vorne anfangen musste.)
Die Ursache für dieses „nicht Speichern“ ist, dass ein aktives Virenschutzprogramm, ein Speichern verhindert.
Man muss also – bei mir war es „Avast“ ausschalten / deaktivieren, um dann in „Shadowgate“ speichern zu können.
Sowas geht garnicht!

Old school adventure (Point and click) games can be really hit or miss for me. Oftentimes the intentionally impenetrable (and often illogical) puzzles along with that feeling of being ""stuck"" just drain the fun. Having said that, there are some great games in the genre, and sometimes they're really worth playing, and I find myself absorbed in their worlds. I was always curious about the Shadowgate remake that had been sitting in my backlog for a while, and I decided to check it out.

The presentation was really nice. The medieval setting with magic and mystery was portrayed wonderfully with the mostly static, but beautiful, backdrops. (There were some nice animations that sometimes played over the backdrops for added flavor.) You had the sense of being in this strange world of witches, dragons, castles and the like, and the soundtrack also added to that magical, fantasy flavor. In typical point and click style, there were plenty of puzzles requiring you to explore, find and utilize items in various ways to unlock progress. There were also magic spells that you picked up on your trek that could be tried out in different situations, and it wasn't always obvious if a particular spell would have the desired - or any - effect. Items could also be combined to make new items, another staple of the genre. As is the case with this style of game, figuring out what to do and executing is satisfying (or just imparting a sense of relief at times). You also have a talking skull as a side-kick that can offer hints if you wish, and there are multiple difficulty levels that change puzzles and items - very much in the vein of the Silent Hill series and I thought that was a nice touch, giving added longevity.

But, for some reason, I just didn't find myself really engaged - despite the positives. I'm not sure what it was. I was stuck for a while, and I realized at one point that I was struggling to find sufficient interest to even bother figuring out or looking up what was needed. It's not that the game was bad or poorly made - not at all. It's just one of those cases where this genre has to really suck me in in order for me to stay engaged. For the right player, I can see it being fantastic. I'm not a hardcore genre-fanatic and this one wasn't enough to rise above for me. 3/5.",1647632618,1647632618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a remake/reimagining of the original MacVenture classic of the same name that imrproves upon the original with great, hand painted graphics, cutscenes, atmospheric music, and a classic fantasy story. 

Though I never completed, or got particularly far into, the original Shadowgate, I did play the game at one point when it was already a retro game. And for better or worse, this version still feels like the same game.

Overall it's definitely a game worth playing, with lots of good stuff about it! However, it's not a perfect game:
- Though mostly good, some of the voice acting feels a bit lacking. (Also, in a ""hidden death"", pronouncing the word wyvern as ""woovern"". xD )
- The game definitely has its own logic that you have to learn. Like how a lot of the parts of the game is ""timed"", though not in realtime, but through number of actions/steps; That different weapons practically has no actual combat use; How you must use the correct order when combining two items; Etc.
- There are so many red herrings and clutter items in the game that it gets a bit much.
- The music when your torch is about to go out is over the top dramatic, and it gets annoying after a while.
- The amount of commands are unnecessarily high, even with the ""modern"" option, and is another cause for confusion.

And although not something I consider a negative point, keep in mind that the game includes deaths, in a way very similar to classic Sierra games. In fact, there are many, many ways of dying in the game - enough to have four different achievements for it! The ten ""hidden deaths"" and a couple others are actually quite worth seeking out for some extra entertainment. But though I understand that it would've been a question about budget and costs, I do wish the normal deaths had a bit more to them than just a red screen and an entertaining text - and maybe a creature up in your face. But at least they went all out on the special deaths!

The achievements for the game are pretty good. Some are easy, others are are hard, but almost all requires you to actually get invested in the game. 100% in this game can probably done faster, but you're likely to spend about 20-25 hours on it. And despite several playthroughs, I didn't get bored.

I'll be buying the reimagined Beyond Shadowgate if/when Zojoi releases it.

The adventure is simple you go inside Shadowgate, solve puzzles to progress (usually involving a lot of backtracking and items express), beat the bad guy, The End, the magic however is the in betweens of the adventure. You read very descriptive texts either through scrolls and books or by simply interacting with things adding to the lore and perspective of the world you interact with, you give a few chuckles and sometimes laugh to the multiple descriptive ways you can possibly die in the game, and probably the most curious of it is the adventuring itself! There are certain achievements there are tied to specific actions and sub-routes you take throught the castle, exploration is key and trial and error a must, it almost feels like a low-key sub-quest system as you play a streamlined adventure adding to the replayability, also it's worth mentioning that certain parts of the castle will be locked off depending on what difficulty you're on, if it's harder you'll unlock more, but you'll also probably not have enough time to explore everything as the game has a hidden timer mechanic based on how many torches you have available in your inventory to light on (there's another timer mechanic a bit early on which might frustrate you a little bit, but it does add to tension and reinforces the ''every turn counts'' mindset), so harder means more, but also less time, again the keyword here is replayability. There's a black humourous air to the game without losing it's seriousness, great for balancing it out without sounding too goofy, a personal thing to ''break the ice'' while maintaining the heroic-epic aspect of it, I hope they can maintain it for the upcoming Beyond the Shadowgate Remake, although I'll admit I have a soft-spot for the light hearted inclination it's classic counterpart had.

I believe I beat it on the easiest setting, which means fewer puzzles, and the existing puzzles have fewer steps required to complete them. 
I am only decent at point and click games like this, and I understand that this game is designed to be on the harder side, but I still felt that some of the decisions the developers made only serve to add extra difficulty, while contributing very little to the overall enjoyment of playing. 
e.g. 
[spoiler]  There is a ""room"" where there is an angry wind elemental that the player must calm by playing a flute. the player cannot simply use the flute on the elemental as common sense would suggest, you must use the flute on yourself. the idea of using items on oneself is something that is very limited at least on the easy setting, and most items that the player applies to an external object are used by 'using' the given item on an object in a room. Now, I can understand having a strict ""use the item on yourself"" policy on the harder settings, but for the easier playthrough, this should absolutely function in a way where the player can either use the flute on themself or on the elemental.[/spoiler] 
of course this is just my opinion, but this moment in the game made me resigned to using a guide, and for me thats when i stop having fun with a game like this. 

It isnt a terrible game, the music, graphics, and overall theme are really cool, but unless you have a very high IQ and a taste for masochism I wouldnt suggest this game for you.

There's normal game mode which is the very easy mode with puzzles still challenging enough for the casual gamer. Then there's classic with 3 difficulties, each difficulty (including normal) adjusts the puzzles, often times changing the solutions completely making each playthrough feel different in some ways. Master difficulty is the no lube mode for people looking for the true brain twister puzzles. 

I put it on master for my first playthrough, ended in me giving up on it. It's really damn hard but here's the thing, if you start off on normal and build your way up the difficulty ladder, you'll likely be in a situation where you understand enough, by that point, to actually tackle master. This gives the game surprising replayability where you'd least expect it from a game like this. If you find yourself struggling too much on the puzzles, consider playing on a lower difficulty. Remember to think outside the box, don't take things at face value. Put yourself in the shoes of the character and some puzzles will make sense. When you get yourself in the proper frame of mind you will find puzzle solving to be challenging but not frustrating.

One more time I'll emphasize, pick lower difficulty settings, even going as low as normal if you find the puzzles in the game are too frustrating for you. You'll be surprised that, after playing on normal and the skull friend helping you when you get stuck that your brain will become aware of the thought process necessary to figure out the puzzles in this game meaning you can move on to other difficulties with more challenging puzzles and perform better than you did before.

Es difícil, y en comparación al original, tiene un buen replay value gracias a sus variaciones de dificultad y modos de juego. Esto permite sacarle un mayor provecho que de sólo jugar lo mismo una y otra vez.

Sirve de poco el conocimiento del original en esta entrega, y es todo un río de emociones volver a vivir la aventura con ese detalle de ""es lo mismo, pero no es igual"". A algunos les molestará, así que recomiendo verlo como una entrega diferente antes que como un remake 100% apegado al original. 

Gráficamente es bueno. No es algo impresionante, pero procura capturar la esencia del castillo cuidando de no pasarse de imaginativos. Es un estilo un poco tosco, pero que le queda perfecto para la ambientación de ""historia narrada por medio de ilustraciones"". En general, las capturas del juego son una buena perspectiva de qué se puede esperar al jugarlo.

La nueva música es más discreta que la de NES, y ello puede significar que te introduzcas más en el juego... o que sientas tu experiencia ""empobrecida"". Yo la he disfrutado mucho, y en cualquier caso, el juego brinda la posibilidad de utilizar el soundtrack original, así que por esa parte se respalda a sí mismo.
Las cinemáticas y efectos no son nada particularmente bueno, aunque el doblaje puede resonar en tu cabeza por varios días si entras lo suficiente en tu papel.

Los controles son una de las partes que más disfruté, y a la vez me molestó al principio. Si no te detienes a explorar las opciones, fácilmente puede sentir que no está bien optimizado para teclado y ratón. Navegar al menos una vez en las opciones para configurar el juego a tu gusto es fundamental; además de que ahí encontrarás algunos detalles que te permitirán personalizar tu experiencia de juego para tu particular disfrute.

Recomendado para los que busquen revivir de alguna manera esa experiencia que fue visitar este castillo por primera vez, resolver nuevos puzzles, y perderse nuevamente en sus habitaciones. Todos los amantes del point-n-click deberían probarlo al menos una vez. No recomendado para los que busquen el mismo juego de hace años pero con un cambio de imagen (dista mucho de ser eso), ni para los que quieran un juego que les ofrezca demasiadas horas de entretenimiento.

This is a remake, keeping some elements of the original, but expanding on and changing the rest. There are still a handful of obvious, idiotic or unexpected ways to die in nearly every room (and achievements to find them all). You will still get frustrated with some of the puzzles.

Upsides:
-Music and artwork are good. Nice to be able to play the original chiptune soundtrack as well.
-A bit more story is available this time around.

YMMV:
-The game is timed by the number of torches you have. Like the original, you'll likely restart a few times to complete parts you've memorized in fewer steps, giving you more breathing room for later.
-There's a new choice in difficulties that affects how many torches are in the game and how complicated the puzzles are. However, it also leaves some content out of the game on easier difficulties. You may be best served playing through on the easiest difficulty and working your way up. Starting out hard can be very frustrating without hints.
-There's a significant number of red herring items and rooms, especially in the easier difficulties. This is faithful to the original, but is just as annoying when trying to solve puzzles.

Downsides:
-There is a second timer mechanic added to the early-to-mid game, which can be very frustrating to deal with.
-A few of the ""puzzles"" (especially goblins) are just inconsistent trial and error. There's no logic. Just guessing and then reloading your game after your head gets bashed in yet again.

Shadowgate is, I believe, a remake of a classic adventure game—one that I've already reviewed, I think, in the ""MacVenture"" series. The original, uh, hadn't aged very well. This remake is gorgeous and slavishly faithful to the idea of the original game if not the original game itself—it's a brutally difficult point-and-click adventure game with countless puzzles, many of which are new to the remake for any returning fans who somehow remember the original 30+ year-old game vividly enough to recognize the original puzzles. Visually the game is gorgeous, as each screen is lovingly hand-painted. Few games, in any genre, manage to nail their aesthetic quite so well.

And, you know, that's basically the only reason why I bought the game in the first place. What can I say? I'm a sucker for games with pretty art styles. Sometimes this lands me an unforgettable classic, like Okami, that I'll adore for the rest of my life. Sometimes it gets me something like Shadowgate instead.

Which is not to say Shadowgate is a bad game, just not for me. There's not much narrative here, just a lot of puzzles. The setting is really interesting and the art very evocative, so the experience as a whole is very compelling... I'm just not a fan of the constant slog of point-and-click puzzles. And the interface felt really confusing to me, too, to the point where I dreaded each click of the mouse. I dunno, maybe I'm being too harsh on the game. Shadowgate feels like a game I could really enjoy if I could just... come at it from another angle. It's one of those games I imagine I'll reinstall every couple of years to give another shot, and who knows? Maybe one day I won't bounce back.

If you're looking for a dark fantasy adventure game with a vividly Gothic aesthetic--bordering ever-so-slightly on the grotesque, and can muddle past the UI issues and don't mind (or even enjoy) the puzzles, I daresay Shadowgate might be the best game on Steam for you. And maybe one day I'll be in the right frame of mind for it to also be for me.",1586562330,1591414896,True,6,0,0.611165106296539307,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Also there's a LOT of backtracking in this game, and it is SLOW! There's no fast travel, which makes it worse, And the interface makes backtracking even more worse on top of that. They could have easily put fast-travel in but I guess they were just lazy. The map could easily have had some fast-travel functionality. Maybe they wanted to keep the ""old-school"" feel of the original, but in this day and age when people are so time-poor, it's just inexcusable.

The puzzles were ok but not intuitive at all (par for the course in fantasy games really), and the instructions are in the form of riddles in scrolls and books. And reading them and trying to keep track of the information is a huge painful chore thanks to the terrible interface. You'll eventually throw your hands up in the air and consult a walkthrough. There are far too many useless items in the game which confuses matters even further.

After a while I just got sick of it all and just wanted to be done with the game so I used a walkthrough liberally during the latter stages of the game. If one has to consult a walkthrough, then it's not a good game.

The story isn't too bad. Music is decent. It's fairly short and simple game. However the overall experience was poor due to the terrible interface.",1586096582,1586096582,False,1,1,0.426540285348892212,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Это вроде как ремейк квеста 1987 года (не играл). Игра поощряет смелость и сообразительность, только это будет пушить прохождение вперёд. Чистокровный квест, в котором доступно 9 классических действий: бить, взять, использовать, открыть, закрыть, идти, есть, говорить, смотреть. Все эти способности можно и нужно использовать на чём угодно и в контексте некоторых ситуаций эти эксперименты возымеют успех. В игре преимущественно придётся тщательно сканировать локации на предмет ценного лута, слоняться по всему замку в поисках куда этот ценный лут присобачить, уклоняться от стрел, прятаться за щитом от огня дракона, драться с гоблином, оборотнем, погибать от ловушек и всего другого понемногу, что для классических квестов не свойственно. В конце даже есть боссфайт (ну почти) на посохах. Забавно, когда я вышел к боссу и пытался стрелять из посоха, который до конца не собрал и мне показали [strike]пафосной[/strike] эпичный GAME OVER.

Игра принимает во внимание дефицит внимания у людей этого тысячелетия, поэтому по нажатию F2 все предметы, с которыми можно провзаимодействовать, подсветятся. Игру можно проскакать за 1,5-2 часа, но если вы такой же тупой и не сообразительный, как и я, то в игре придётся скрипеть мозгами 10+ часов.

Из особенностей: моего английского уровня «My name is Diсk» для комфортного прохождения не хватило, поэтому периодически приходилось нырять в переводчик. Английский местами показался вычурным. Перевода на православный пока не существует. После прохождения интересный анонс игры Beyond Shadowgate, которая выйдет в 2016 году (упс, уже 2020, а игры всё ещё нет).

In order to bypass the torch limit, I downloaded a trainer that allowed me to add as many torches as I wanted.  This gave me the opportunity to really learn the different puzzles and how to actually cure the curse time limit without resorting to a guide.  Every time you perform an action, besides any type of Look / Read action, your torch gets consumed a small amount.  This make its difficult, if not impossible, to go through the different iterations of the puzzles to find the answers - short of scumming which I hate having to do.  After playing through Master several times (and dying several times) I realized the torch limitation actually wasn't as bad as I thought, but there's no way I could have done it without the trainer removing the torch limit (or at least retained any level of sanity/enjoyment from the game).  I still highly recommend this game as the 18 hours I spent over the past week were a lot of fun.

The original Shadowgate had you exploring a dark, mysterious castle, and solving puzzles.  You'd snap up every item that you saw, and tried to figure out how they were to be used, sometimes finding that they were not to be used at all.  This was all narrated but a writer with wicked, dry sense of humor, with lines that seem innocuous, but are laden with snark.  Perhaps one of the greatest joys - certainly the greatest unintentional joy - of the original Shadowgate was finding all of the absurd ways to kill your character; almost [i]everything[/i] could kill your character.  Although this - I guess you'd call it a reboot? - has all of that, it manages to fall flat.

The first problem is the large amount of moon logic puzzles.  Yes, the original had them, and walkthroughs are a thing, but it's 2014; I thought we'd all agreed that this was bad design, and that we were going to move on from it.  What makes this especially disappointing is that this game lays a pretty good groundwork, with lots of would-be clever puzzles and spells with some subtle clues, like the original often did.  Make the puzzles challenging, but there should be [b]some[/b] kind of clue about how to solve them, or else, they're just guesswork.  Part of the problem is that there are tons of useless items, strewn about in a ""Remember filling your inventory with items you'd never use?  Wasn't that great!?"" kind of way; when you have an achievement for picking up 200 different items, it's painfully obvious that you're straining to make some kind of connection to the original.

Another problem is its presentation; the original generally played it straight, with the occasional snarky line or goofy humor thrown in to catch you off guard, and it was balanced very well.  This adds in long cutscenes and lots of backstory, detailing - or more often, glossing over - fantastical worlds that you'll never experience, and the sheer amount just tips the scales a bit too far.  Lore and worldbuilding are wonderful things, but not something that Shadowgate ever needed, unless you're going to actually expand that world within the game, and given that you never leave Castle Shadowgate, it doesn't quite work.  Throwing in a few bits and pieces about the actual castle, the villain's motives, or the nature of the beast was great, but there's this whole big thing about a prophecy, and your lineage, and it all just seems simultaneously unnecessary and too convenient that you'd discover your entire family history by taking on this quest to a castle in the middle of nowhere.  That's not to say that it doesn't occasionally capture the original's great sense of humor - there are still some absolute classics here - but that the lack of balance makes the cutscenes and all of the extra story bits seem to drag on about twice as long as they actually do.  They did even realize that fans love the deaths, and added in a slew of special hidden deaths with their own cutscenes to find, so they had an idea of what to celebrate, but sadly, it just didn't quite come together.

This also has retro features, but they're very hit-or-miss.  There's a whole new look, sound, and even a completely redesigned interface, but if you want the old one, it's right at your fingertips.  The new interface is pretty bad, with some ambiguous icons representing some of the actions.  I know what a foot's going to do, but a hand could be touch, lift, take, press, or any number of other things; a picture is worth a thousand words, but not all of those words are always accurate, and thankfully, the classic interface gives you straight text commands.  The new visuals are not great; they look like a painting that's been left in an unsuitable environment, so all of the colors are smearing and blurring together.  If you're going to go all out, then do that!  If you choose the classic visuals, instead of getting something like the NES version or the old computer versions, it just drastically lowers the image's resolution; it looks like the background of a bad VGA Point-and-Click Adventure, and while an homage, it's not one to anything that Shadowgate's ever been.  With that, the new music is the typical generic orchestral outing, but the old NES music clashes with the new visuals, and with the ""classic"" visual setting doing nothing more than rendering most objects inscrutable, you don't have a nice pairing for it.

The game isn't without its potential; it just failed to live up to it.  I'd love to see some of the new/expanded elements here used in another game, like maybe a 3D reimagining of Castlequest/Castle Excellent.  Running around in real time, exploring a dark, strange castle, with a variety of vaguely-defined spells and items used to solve various puzzles and progress deeper into its walls sounds like a great idea.  I'd encourage this development team to branch out and make something that is wholly their own.

Some minor spoilers ahead, but to name a few examples below in more detail to vent out:
-Spell descriptions are very vague and for the most part I don't know what to use them for and what to use them on, their use is only described as a vague clouded vision of the environment they are to be used in. It would seem like they don't even have a separate utilitarian purpose, like one door-opening spell or one damaging spell, they are all (with the exception of Invoke) just glorified magical keys that can be used only in one particular circumstance and never again. Kind of disappointing that a light spell doesn't actually shed light or blind anything other than one specific enemy it was designed for.
-Despite being equiped with multiple weapons and combat-effective spells, as well as carrying both a shield and a helmet, you'll get instakilled by a goblin unless you decide to punch it in the face. You can defend yourself against multiple instances of dragonfire breathing, but are not competent enough to get a hold of a sword to beat a goblin, at the same time being capable enough to take him down with one punch.
-The Obelisk messages don't actually give you any advice, don't set the goal or explain the world around you, and only serve the purpose of cryptic encouragement to defeat evil.
-How is it logical that a stained glass window shedding light on the floor will point you to it so you can pry open a particular tile to uncover a skull to put into the main entrance outside the area's perimeter to activate the room of mirrors 5km deep into the castle, and how is one supposed to figure it out, and how is one to know afterwards whether the rest of the map doesn't have such particular ""puzzles""?
-Overall, there's a ton of backtracking, and transitioning between locations is a real pain after an hour or two.

NES konsoluna çıkan 1984 yapımı Shadowgate'in yeniden yapımı harika bir işaretle ve tıkla, macera bulmaca oyunudur. Yeniden yapım denilse de aslında bayağı farklı bir oyun. Bulmacalarda büyük bir değişim söz konusu. Özellikle oyunu oynadığınız zorluğa göre oyunun içindeki bulmacaların çözümlerindeki ufak tefek değişimler ve yüksek zorlukta bulunabilen bir sürü gizlilik ile onları keşfetmesi hoş hissettiriyor. Yüksek zorluktaki zaman kısıtlamalarını rahatsız edici bulabilir ve NES versiyonunu oynamış oyuncular belki memnun olmayabilir. Ben yinede farklı bir tat olarak öneriyorum.

[h1]Çok fazla isim barındıran, derin gibi gözüken kısa senaryo[/h1]

Karakterimiz, basit bir Windemere askeri olan genç Jair Cuthegar'dir. Rüyasında tanımadığı Lakmir adında bir büyücünün, onu büyük bir tehlikeye karşı uyarması ve onu çağırmasıyla kuzeye, yaşayan kale Shadowgate'e doğru yola çıkar. Kalenin girişinde, maceramızda bize eşlik edecek ve yardım isteyebileceğimiz veya pataklayabileceğimiz kurukafa Yorick'i yanımıza alıyor ve kaleye giriş yapıyoruz. Rüyamızda söylenen tehlikeyle kaleye attığımız ilk adımımızla karşılaşıyoruz. Talimar The Black adında kötü büyücü, kırmızı bir sisin içinde bize sesleniyor. Lakmir ve on iki büyücünün dahi onu durduramadığını, basit bir askerin beni nasıl durdurabileceği gibi alaycı sözlerle ""Yapabiliyorsan gel yap!"" diyerek bize meydan okuyor. (SEN KİM KÖPEK!?) Shadowgate Kalesinde kısa bir keşiften sonra Lakmir'in bıraktığı notlar ve büyülü taşlar sayesinde amacımızı öğreniyoruz. Kalenin derinlerinde hapsedilmiş kudretli varlığı Talimar uyandırıp gücünü elde etmeden önce onu yok etmek.

Senaryomuz bu kadar. Oyun içerisinde bolca parşömen, kitap ve duvar yazısı okuyarak Shadowgate evreniyle alakalı birçok minik bilgi öğreniyoruz. Bu durum senaryoya derinlik katsa da bazen çok isim olması bulmacalarda kafa karıştırabiliyor. Yazıların büyük bir çoğunluğu ise ekstra bilgi olduğunu da ekleyeyim.

[h1]Oynanış, zorluk seviyeleri ve bulmacalar![/h1]

Oyunda toplam dokuz adet eylem seçeneğimiz var. Look, Take, Open, Close, Go, Use, Hit, Eat ve Speak.

Eğer isterseniz NES konsolundaki gibi ilk önce eylem, sonra obje, son olarak etkileşime geçilecek ikinci objeyi seçerek birazcık nostaljik tatta da oynayabiliyorsunuz. Bu seçenekte eylemlerin hepsi ekranın üstünde gözüküyor. Bu haliyle oynamanız oyunun bir kaç ekstra gizli eylemi gerçekleştirmenize de izin veriyor. Sağ tık yaparak eylemden vazgeçiyorsunuz. Tüm bu fare ile kullanılan eylemler dışında klavyeden hızlıca kullanabilmek için atanmış kısa yollar mevcut. Eşyaya tıklayıp CTRL basılı tutup sayıya tıkladığınızda o eşyaya kısa yol atıyorsunuz. Kısa yola atanmış eşya için ""Use"" eylemini hızlıca kullanabiliyorsunuz. Eşya çantamızda kullanılabilir , okunabilir , giyilebilir eşyalar ve büyüler olarak ayarlanmış dört tane sekmeyle güzel bir rahatlık sağlanmış.

Gelelim oyunun zorluklarına. Normal ve Classic olmak üzere iki tür zorluk bulunuyor. Normal, bu türü ilk defa deneyenler için düşünülmüş. Zaman kısıtlamaları yok. Bulmacalar çok zorlayıcı değil. Gereksiz eşya alımlarına izin verilmiyor. Gereksiz eylemlere izin verilmiyor. Mesela ateşle konuşmaya çalışmak ya da kalkanı yemeye çalışmak gibi. Tehlikeli eylemlere de izin verilmiyor. Mesela önemli parşömenleri ateşe vermek veya pencereden atlamak gibi ölümle sonuçlanacak eylemlere. Bazı tehlikeli eylemler içinse ""Emin misin?"" şeklinde uyarı yaparak söylüyor. Eylemi yapabiliyorsunuz ama yapmamanız önerilir, tünelin ucunda Mahmut Hoca var. Gayet tadımlık, bir sefer böyle oynayıp bitirmeniz ve oyunu kavramanız önerilir.

Classic zorluk türü altında Apprentice, Journaymen ve Master adında üç zorluk seviyesi bulunuyor. Apprentice ve Journaymen, zaman kısıtlamaları bulunan, Normal'in çoğu kısıtlaması kaldırılmış, bazı bulmacaların ipuçları değiştirilmiş ve yeni odalar eklenmiş hali.

Zaman Kısıtlamaları ise şunlar: Meşale, Banshee Laneti ve Talimar. Oyunda sınırlı sayıda meşale bulunuyor ve ""Look"" eylemi dışında yapacağınız her eylem, meşalenin azalmasına sebep oluyor. Apprentice ve Journaymen'de meşale kıtlığı yaşanmıyor ama Master'da su gibi gidiyor. Yine de üç zorluk içinde bol bol kayıt ve kayıttan yükleme yaparak, zamanla çözdüğünüz veya yaptığınız eylemleri geri alarak en az hamlede tekrarlamanız önerilir. Banshee Laneti ise meşale gibi eylem yaptıkça geri sayımı olan bir lanet. Çözümü Apprentice ve Journaymen'de çok kolay olsa da çözümün olduğu yere kadar kısa sürede gelmek çok önemli. Master'da ise çözümü hem zor hem de birden fazla alternatifi var ve zaman çok daha kısa. Talimar kısıtlaması ise Master'da dahi 2000 hamle sayısını geçmediğiniz müddetçe yaşamayacağınız bir kısıtlama. Fakat [spoiler] oyunun sonundaki kurukafa kapıyı açarsanız oyun size 20-30 hamlelik kısıtlama getiriyor ve gerekli eşyalar yoksa ne içeri girip oyunu bitirebiliyorsunuz ne de 20-30 hamlede eşyaları alıp tekrardan kapıya girebiliyorsunuz. [/spoiler] Hazırlığınızı yaptığınıza emin olun.

Oyunun en güzel kısmı Master zorluk! Meşaleler çok hızlı tükeniyor, Banshee lanetini daha az hamlede çözmeniz gerekiyor. Çoğu obje, eşyanın yeri ve olan bulmacaların çözüm yolları değiştirilmiş. Yeni büyüler, yeni odalar, yeni bulmacalar, yeni engeller konmuş ve birçok ekstra gizlilik eklenmiş. Apprentice ve Journaymen'de olan ve girilmeyen odaların hepsine girilebiliyor. Master'da tüm kısıtlamalar kalktığı için yapacağınız hamlelere dikkat etmelisiniz. Parşömenleri yakmak gibi hamleler hiç uyarı vermeksizin gerçekleşiyor. Yanlışlıkla büyü parşömeni yakarsanız oyunda tamamen tıkanabilirsiniz. Kendinizi istediğiniz gibi öldürebilir hatta oyunda gizli ölüm şekillerini bile bulabilirsiniz. Master'ın bulmacaları zorladığı kadar çok fazla gizlilik barındırması benim en sevdiğim kısım. Tabi aniden çıkan engelleri o an karar verip çözmekte heyecan veren yanlarından biri. Zaman kısıtlamalarını kayıt ve kayıttan yükle ile bir miktar geciktirip tüm bu baskının altında oyunu bitirmenin keyfi apayrı ama herkesin katlanıp, sevebileceğini sanmıyorum.

Bulmacalar genellikle eşyaları doğru biçimde yerleştirmek veya o an için gerekli eşyayı kullanmaktan ibaret. El becerisi isteyen bulmacalar yok ama ipuçlarını anlamak İngilizce istiyor. Bu oyunun güzel olduğu kısım not tutmak ve çözümleri karşımıza çıkan ekranda aramakta. Bazı ipuçları gözünüzün önünde olsa da göremeyebilirsiniz. Bazen lüzumsuz gözüken detay aslında işinize yarayabilir. Bu durumlara özellikle Master zorluğunda dikkat ediniz. 

[h1]Kısaca görseller, müzik, minik birkaç sorun ve değerlendirme.[/h1]

Görseller muazzam. Senaryo anlatımında ara sahneler ve mekân tasarımları detaylarıyla muhteşem gözüküyor. Eşya etkileşimleriyle de hiç bir sıkıntı yaşanmıyor, bazı objeler ne kadar küçük gözüküyor olsada. Etkileşime geçilebilecek eşyaları görmek için ""F2"" tuşuna basarak parlamalarını sağlayabilirsiniz, hoş bir detay. Müzikler, NES dönemindeki müziklerin gayet güzelce uyarlanmış versiyonları. NES'deki versiyonlarını dinleyebilir veya yeni hallerini dinleyebilirsiniz. NES versiyonu müzikler oynarken rahatsız edici olabiliyor ama yeni versiyonları gayet hafif tonlarda, dikkat dağıtmayan güzel parçalar. Seslendirmeler az olsa da seslendiren yaşlı amcaların sesleri harika.

Minik sorunlardan birincisi; Master zorluğunda anahtar gibi eşyalar kullanıldıktan sonra eşya çantasından çıkmıyor. Eşya çantası düzenleme seçeneği olmadığı için bir noktadan sonra çok fazla eşya dolup karmaşa yaratıyorlar. Minik sorunlardan ikincisi; çok fazla lüzumsuz eşya toplanabiliyor ama eşyalardan elden çıkarılmıyor. Eşya çantası dolup taşıyor gene. Minik sorunlardan üçüncüsü; oyunda bolca silah topluyoruz ama beceri odaklı bulmacalar olmadığı için silah kullanmanın tadını çıkaramıyoruz. Üzücü. Bir sonraki oyun Beyond Shadowgate'i merakla bekliyorum bakalım. Gizli bulmacaları seven herkese önerilir.

The name of the game alone, spoke to me of prestige and nostalgia, and also mystery (I never played any of the games in the Shadowgate series).  The modernized look of the game is spectacular, oozing classic style and poignant colors.  A large part of what hooked me into the game was the art direction.  The soundtrack is also alluring.  Here is a game for you if the classic feels appeal to you.  

There is a very foundational structure inherent in the point-and-click adventure genre for the entire gaming industry in general - the remake exudes this sense of being seminal from the original.  Playing this game practically made me feel like I jumped back in time, except I didn't...  the game jumped through time to this modern remake and made the past available.  Together with the past, the game builds a whole world with its own lore, intrique, mysteries...  I still feel the game as a living world, after finishing it...  But let's get to it: the surface appeal of Shadowgate lies in its classic roots, artful visuals, and the cool OST.

Then there are the puzzles.  This update to the original Shadowgate is 95% new puzzles.  And I can say that the puzzles are good.  Well, I don't think I can say that; afterall, I've only finished the game on its easiest difficulty...  I finished the game on normal mode, which is the Novice level.  There are four difficulty levels in the game, Normal (aka Novice), which is it's own level and then Classic which is split into three levels, Journeyman, Adept, and Master.  Classic mode can be played Ironman, which means no saves.  

You might think that, for a point-and-click adventure game, there would be no differences in difficulty levels...  This remake of Shadowgate is different however.  The higher up the difficulty the more complex the puzzles will become, and the easiser it will get to be killed.  I found that being able to die in an adventure game made the genre fresh to me again.  And it's satisfying to know that there will be more difficult puzzles awaiting if you wanted to play through the game with a higher difficulty.  

The puzzles are all sensible and even the ones that are so difficult that I had to resort to a walkthrough (I think I looked up solutions three times during my Novice run?), even those puzzles would make sense and make you think, ""dang, I should have gotten it on my own!).  

So there, I laid out for you the reasons to get Shadowgate.  
-it's a remake of a classic, and a quality remake
-the art and music of the game has a classic and stylish appeal
-the puzzles are satisfying and make their own logic sensible
-death is possible, and different difficulties require more complex reasoning

I wanted to complain about getting stuck and being made to stare at the screen for hours...  but that is only because I was stubborn.  There is a hint system in the game that doesn't give much away, and it does its job.  You can turn this off if you like.

Edit: 
I was mistaken in the past about a feature that I thought wasn't in the game, but it is.  I said before that the only negative I had with the game was that I couldn't play it in its original graphics as an option.  I was wrong.  There is a ""Retro Mode"" available in the game as an option.  From the Steam game ""about this game"" section: ""Retro Mode: Play the game like it's 1989!

My dad's best friend, whom I referred to as ""Uncle Dan"", introduced me to this game.  Uncle Dan was a nerd before nerds were a thing.  He helped make me maps in Zelda 2, he gave me his copy of Shadowgate after hyping me up about it for weeks, and moreover he was a great friend.
Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away when I was about 13.

I still remember the day he gifted me Shadowgate (I still own the cartridge)... and he refused to help me with it.  He forced me to figure the puzzle out.  I finally beat it, and I felt so goddamn good.

This remake is incredible.  It's nostalgic, while bringing new puzzles into the mix.  The moment I started reading the ""Five to find..."" line, my lips moved along with it, as if it were a part of me.

To those out there who are hesitant, this is a point-and-click adventure (similar to Myst) with the potential that you will be forced to restart from square-1.  However, if you restart, you know the puzzle ahead of you, so the replay value of this game is quite limited.

If you are a fan of the old NES/GB Shadowgate or if you enjoy point-and-click adventure/puzzlers, this is worth full price.

I have very fond memories of that game; being bested by the many puzzles, dieing over and over in unneccesary and gruesome ways, while still enjoying exploring the castle and listening to the great soundtrack.
This remake has pretty much all of that, and more.
There are 4 distinct difficulties now, each with their own sets of items you can find and use, different rooms to explore and the puzzles are either different or more complex.
So the game has a lot of replay value, especially if you want to get all the achievements. There are a LOT of them.
To some, this game may seem unfair since there are 'time limits', but honestly they are not too bad. And even if you do happen to somehow run out of time (in actuality it's a number of actions you're allowed to perform), you can always load an earlier save or play a lot more efficient on your next playthrough.
The remake has everything that made the original game fantastic and adds even more deaths, some great voice acting, a grisly and yet charming art style, new spells and a LOT of new puzzles and items.
Liked the original and want a new twist on it? Go play this and you'll love it!
Fan of point-and-click games but don't like time limits or restrictions? Just play it on 'normal' (easiest difficulty) first. You get almost 5000 turns to finish the game. That's more than enough to get used to the game.
You can then decide if you want to challenge yourself with a harder game or not.

Only a few places you can die and if you save often this isn't too problematic- nor is the timed element (which may just be part of one of the puzzles anyway- I didn't fail because of the timed element so don't worry about reviews implying you have to do it to a timer, either there isn't really one or it's a long one, and you have to trigger it anyway, it's just something finding an object resolves.) Even if you do die it takes you back to soon before, you don't usually have too many steps to retrace.

Bought this off a discount for like 3€ - totally worth it.

Fun and relaxed game of exploring a fantasy castle old school RPG style. 

Playstyle:
I have'nt played the original - but im a 90's nostalgia type in general, so im familiar with this kind of RPG and how the atmosphere is created and the story unfolds. The remake catches this feeling very well by just leaving the gameplay where it is: You progress through the castle room by room, pick up stuff, use it,[spoiler] an die ;)[/spoiler] like so many RPG Novels you might know from that period (without the need of seeking pages all the time). No leveling up and attribute points here - just inventory (includes spells). There are no swordfighting minigames or stuff like that - you decide how you want to encounter an enemy when he shows up and then you get the result straight away: [spoiler]ur ded again ;D[/spoiler]. There is however a limit to the actions you can do, before the game ends and [spoiler]take a guess...[/spoiler]. But so what? you start over again, with all the things you learned, and its fine, nice touch to the game actually. When you tune it down to ""normal"" aka casual, the limit wont hit you too soon.

Other Stuff:
Graphics are decent, just animated 2D stuff - no showoff 3D. Sounds get the job done. Soundtrack is nice and fits the atmosphere.
The UI has some flaws, could have been better. I'd like to have icons for the spells directly on the screen, so i wouldn't need to open my inventory all the time. It comes with a built in hint-system you can turn off, thats nice.

nice game, would by again for 3€. maybe 5€ too.",1515525558,1515525854,True,2,0,0.554001927375793457,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ici la ""mort"" fait partie intégrante du GamePlay puisque vous incarnez un héro évoluant dans un univers médiéval fantastique, un peu comme dans un roman ""dont vous êtes le héro"".

Les tableaux sont statiques avec quelques animations et de nombreux bruitages. Le tout est très bien réalisé, agréable à l'oeil et à l'oreille. Le peu de voix est un anglais mais tous les textes sont traduits en fançais (à quelques fautes près comme l'article ""the"" qui apparait régulièrement).

J'ai commencé en Mode ""normal"" pour me familiariser et l'aventure c'est relativement bien faite d'autant que beaucoup de choses sont là pour vous aider au démarrage, l'interface n'est pas des plus ergonomique mais on s'y fait et on prend rapidement ses marques. Les raccourçis claviers facilitent la vie notamment. Chose surprenante, même si j'ai ""rushé"" une seconde fois en mode Classique/Apprenti (facile), les quelques changements apportent quelques nouveautés auquelles on doit s'adapter. En mode Classique/Compagnon, vous avez accès à de nouvelles pièces... Cette construction particulière est intéressante mais diablement... enervante car ce qui marchait le coup d'avant... ne fonctionne pas toujours entièrement de la même manière, celà rajoute encore de la difficulté qui est globalement déjà bien présente.

Beaucoup d'éléments rendent cette aventure vivante (anxiogène ?) : la gestion de la lumière avec les torches qui s'usent, les combats et autres pièges mortels, les limites de temps (surtout aux deux derniers modes). On peut aussi choisir de s'équiper de certains équipements, très utile pour certaines quêtes. Et pour finir, beaucoup de choses ne servent à rien, ou tout du moins pas pour l'aventure principale... ce qui corse le tout.

Un jeu à ne pas mettre entre toutes les mains aux difficultés élevée (nécécité d'une certaine pugnacité) mais qui peut convenir aux aventuriers en herbe aux deux premières difficultés. Un Remake/Remaster vraiment, vraiment réussi. Bravo !

J'ai l'impression, vu la qualité de l'évolution des énigmes, que ce jeu a été conçu pour que l'on teste au moins les 3 difficultés du mode ""classique"".

Ich habe auf dem leichtesten Schwierigkeitsgrad gespielt und musste deshalb das Spiel auch nicht mehrfach von vorne beginnen, weil ich am Anfang einen Fehler gemacht hätte. Also ich konnte in eins durchspielen.
Sterben kann man häufiger, deshalb sollte man öfters speichern. Meistens sind die Situationen aber vorhersehbar, wenn es gefährlich wird.
Was ich sehr gut finde ist, dass alles was man machen muss sehr nachvollziehbar sind. Wenn ich z.B. etwas kaputt schlagen muss, geht es mit einem Hammer. Auch kann man mit vielen Gegenständen interagieren, die für die Story zwar nicht relevant sind, aber sehr viel Atmosphäre geben. So kann man z.B. Kisten zerschlagen oder Wandteppiche anzünden.

(Siehe Screenshot) Das wird dann ärgerlich, wenn man gerne mal im Vollbildmodus spielen will, aber auch mal im Fensrermodus.

Insbesondere wegen der Grafikfehler die das Spiel auf meinem Heim-PC für mich unspielbar machen kann ich auch keine Empfehlung aussprechen.

I originally played Shadowgate for NES and a lot of it's feel (and some design) is very much the same. Some things are missing it seems now but still have references (the toll troll on the bridge and coins for example).

I beat the original as a kid and I remember there was a storyline but it wasn't very clear. Of course, no kid really wants to put pieces together manually like we are looking at Dark Souls storyline so I never really followed along. I really liked the story and this game's concept. The thing I really appreciate I think is that this is remastered by the original development team. This isn't just some title someone took and used to sell their own idea, it's the original creators reforging an idea they had. I appreciate that a lot, and this game was made with care.

The curse was a pain but it was so fulfilling to remove it. Some of the puzzles are very abstract but none of them are beyond reach.

The music was really nice to hear as well. The remastered tracks are good.

There is honestly a firm chance that the firm approval I have for this game is heavily influenced by my childhood memories of the game and it's similar counterparts (Such as Deja Vu). As a puzzle game it's quite good and it captured the feel of Shadowgate remarkably well.

很显然的，这部作品在冒险解谜游戏的历史上，有着与其名声不太相符的重要地位。事实上在它的背后，有着对许多后来欧美游戏的启迪，包括它奇特的物品设计，以及对于纸笔桌游的场景描述移植到图形表现上的尝试。与现在许多游戏强调简单易上手的操作截然不同，那完全没有任何提示与“报错”设计的操作，在提高了玩家的血压同时，也极大的赋予了游戏的自由感。

一位英雄该是怎样的死法？我在旧版中遇到最初的难题，不是什么新人杀手怪或是机关陷阱，而是学会如何不让主角扭到脚摔断自己脖子.....................

伴随着游戏对玩家的放任不管，所带来的结果便是各种死亡，草率的拉到机关或是盲目前进，遇到危机时无法及时做出反应。前往下一个区域时忘了举起你的盾牌，甚至是在火把烧完之前忘了添火，而导致主角在黑暗中不小心摔倒，伴着那清脆的“bia ji”一声，你的脖子就这么摔断了。

14年的新版本是一个非常优秀的重制游戏。不仅全程用精美的手绘图替换了所有场景，还将文本叙事在保留原本故事的前提下，重新给予了更高的水准。游戏的系统被开发者用现代化的方式打造了一遍，玩家仍然可以体验到其复古的本质（这点从主角伴随全程的惨叫可以体会到），但优化过后的操作与更亲切的便利化（主要体现在你死后重试的快捷性）让新玩家也可以很愉快（？）的游玩。

本作是一个经典的重生，目前一大帮国外玩家开始喊着要Deja Vu的重制了。无论你是否玩过Shadowgate，只要你喜欢点击型冒险解谜，或是希望玩到具有桌游气质的非RPG游戏，都可以尝试一下这个有着悠久历史的作品。",1488128373,1488128373,True,72,1,0.838171839714050293,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The atmosphere, enhanced graphics, well told story, remixed music, different difficulty modes, and varied puzzles and paths make this one outshine the original version even. With various customization options, anyone who enjoys point and click adventure titles will feel right at home with Shadowgate.  

 For the best experience during gameplay, I like to set the music to retro 8-bit style and play that way. That music when the torch is about to run out always puts me on edge, and heightens the foreboding mood that a game like this is supposed to have. Some of the puzzles are the same as the original- such as needing to grab a shield to block the dragon's flame in the treasure room- but others require slightly different approaches than the original game, especially on Master difficulty. If you don't use a walkthrough, it will take quite some time to get through the game. Beyond that, I am certainly not going to spoil anything, so try it and find out for yourself.

The merciless journey through a deadly castle allowed you unprecedented freedom to Take, Open, Drink, and Hit just about anything you came across in the game world. Now Shadowgate has been re-imagined for the modern era, which means new graphics and new interfaces for a new audience. Surprisingly, it might still be plenty familiar to the masochists that loved the original as well.

The first place new Shadowgate diverges from the original is in the story, though it might not be immediatly apparent how much it does. You, being a strapping young warrior, are summoned by a mysterious wizard to the living castle of Shadowgate. Within its lethal, enchanted walls is an evil warlock seeking some world-ending power, and it's your job to puzzle up a way to stop him. Along the way you'll learn plenty about the circle of wizards who once inhabited the castle, the power they protected, and the lands beyond.

In terms of gameplay, this is a first-person point-and-click adventure. Each room is a static scene with features to examine and items to gather. Clicking on something brings up a context menu that allows you to perform all sorts of actions like looking, taking, opening, using, and more. Some items need to be used on yourself, some need to be combined, and so on. The objects you find are also helpfully sorted by type, which is a blessing once you realize how many damn scrolls you're going to find.

The other thing you'll find is a plethora of ways to die. OG Shadowgate wasn't shy about murdering you for daring to pick up a book or dipping your toe in a pool of water, and the remake carries over some of that, though most are locked behind the game's many difficulty levels. Most fatalities will come at the hands of the few monsters that serve to block your progress at different points. They tend not to be hard to dispatch but there's usually one correct option among a mess of more obvious ones. For example, one enemy can be dealt with by simply punching it in the face, but using any sort of weapon or spell on it means instant death.

This also brings me to my chief complaint about the game, the obscurity of some of the puzzles. Adventure games have thankfully moved far away from the days of cat hair mustaches and helium bubblegum tooth heists, but some still have problems directing the player to the right conclusions. There are plenty of puzzles in Shadowgate that have simple solutions that simply aren't telegraphed in any way, like the cure for the banshee curse or the ability to remove runes. You're sure to run into situations where you know what to do but not HOW precisely to do it, but also situations where it's just not clear how to progress.

Luckily this isn't a particularly damning complaint, because the game provides significant help like a very specific hint system (his name is Yorick) and a useful map that marks important points of interest. It also helps that you'll be exploring some rather lovely painted scenery, accompanied by quality sound work and inspiring riffs on the original soundtrack. And there are even retro options that make the game more like the original, setting some of the gameplay systems and interfaces and even the music back to their classic incarnations.

It's something you don't often see in remakes, a gradient of options between old and new, but it illustrates the love and attention that went into making it. And it doesn't hurt that there's a quality adventure that stands on its own hidden underneath. There's enough of the original Shadowgate here that longtime fans will appreciate the arcane puzzles and sudden fatalities, along with enough innovation to keep newcomers hooked.

I had some experience with older Shadowgate, and knew what the game was all about - player finding countless ways to die. Which isn't what I find ""a good gameplay"". But there was certain charm to how insane Shadowgate was in it's leaps of logic or lack thereof, and how eager it was to kill you, and it even worked to a degree when using, say, an NES version of the game and savestating a lot. Which didn't make the game good, mind you, but at least entertaining. Which is why it is strange to see Shadowgate 2014 struggle with that in so many areas.

Now, I need to point out that the game now has a special ""Normal"" mode, which makes it work like a rather simplistic, but pretty cool in terms of the setting point and click adventure. It locks out all the unusable and incorrect solutions from the mouse interface, makes several puzzles a lot less complicated and makes it next to impossible to die. It is a fun way to play the game the first time if you're new to full playthroughs of the game, like I was, but it does make the entire game feel less charming in a way. You need to be really silly to die, it's impossible to screw anything up, no time limits, just rather simple puzzles and lots of exposition. So after you play through the game like that, you might want to start the Classic mode on one of the 3 difficulty modes.

And that's where the game has it's charm, yet mostly fails to improve on the original. It looks better, it's awesome to see how different some rooms and puzzles are across different difficulties, some deaths are still as stupid and fun. Yet, some of the silliness is gone. And, more importantly, the game doesn't feel like an improvement in controls over the original at all. The text box is tiny, some text requires you to see it all before you can do any actions, including some rooms that always do that. Inventory is a pain to go through, despite the hotkey possibilities, cutscenes are boring and slow. And, most importantly, when you die, the game wants you to sit until the grim reaper starts appearing, then you can skip it, then you're in the main menu, then you can load. Menu and quickload functionality is disabled. Meaning, that deaths are not entertaining, but slow and annoying occurances that still can come out of nowhere.

Of course, there's also the fact that after playing games like Legend of Grimrock, which shown that some fantasy-themed puzzle solving can be switched to realtime gameplay from pure pre-rendered point and click, Shadowgate feels rather shallow to play. It's a cool setting full of cool ideas, which would be so much more fun if they could be experienced in a faster and more immersive ways.

But it's just an okay update to an old game, that was never good, but has some weird entertaining value to it and an honestly pretty cool setting and ideas. Given how often the game goes on super cheap sales or pops up in bundles, there's no reason not to check it out for cheap some day.

But I think personally, that this are not a worthy Shadowgate remake.

Its so much that was removed/changed/added in the game, that its really not Shadowgate anymore.


For example, the Epor spell, the bottle you drink to become lighter to cross the rotten bridge, the blade that is used with the staff in the final scene, the slingshot, the pay-to-cross the bridge creature, and yeah, those gems (red, blue, white) that you put in slots to open hidden doors. And of course, that iconic unpassable slime when you open the incorrect coffin.

Then much things that does not belong to shadowgate was added, for example those statues you can use the [spoiler]invokain[/spoiler] spell on, and the sphere that is aquired by putting the white gem into the slot (in the old gameboy version) is changed in a heavy way that requires it to be ""charged"" with different elementals.

MOTHERFUCKING BANSHEE!
Remember the bamshee that popped out of the coffin in Shadowgate Classic? It now activates a click-counter. After X number of clicks here and there, YOU DIE. Save your game without knowing where the antidote is? Your save is now fucked. Found the room that sends you back to the start without warning? More clicks for the counter! One of the rooms in the first Hall by the dragon gets inexplicably blocked by an energy force, so you have to walk the long way around, up through the Mirror-room floor.

Oh and the mirror room. Remember how 2/3 mirrors killed you? There are now 6 and NONE of them kill you!
EPOR now does nothing as you can climb through the hole without it.
Rock in a sling? ""Death to the philistine""? I found one but both goblins I faced I simply HIT them.
Don't even bother with 'Classic' graphics mode either, as it simply makes everything super grainy.

Many of the puzzles are so obscure. I found a gear somewhere, but needed a walkthrough to find the mechanism in the floor where it goes.. except it doesn't go there. Actually you have to pry off one of the existing gears in the hatch with your sword, to see the lever positions, then put the gear back to use them.

How about the Library, remember the library? Red gem in the hole opens the bookcase...
Or how about clicking twice (once to open the menu, once to activate the book) on every book in 2 rows until you find 5 books that unlock the wall! If 'click everything until it works' is your security system, just use a doorknob!

Don't forget to use the rope & grappling hook on yourself to separate them if you forgot to climb down into the well before opening the drawbridge! You'll need the guantlet to piuch out the second troll, oh were you expecting to use that on an acid fountain?

Oh, and periodically return to the very start of the game to add a skull to the doorway. Yes, rune skulls act like batteries, 'activating' the mechanisms in the castle as if it were Devil May Cry.

Ya, so about that banshee. All of the hours my profile say that I have spent playing the game so far? Fucking garbage! Back to square one! If you do pick it up, look up how to get the antidote, and get it ASAP!",1451340177,1451341098,False,35,7,0.704059004783630371,2,True,False,False,False,,,

OK...if you like that sort of thing. For me, this was a bit of a nostalgic jaunt.

This is a nice little remake of the original Shadowgate mystery/puzzle game and probably would be a good game for those who miss the Myst style of gaming experience as this game requires a logic, all too often all its own, to solve the numerous puzzles of which this game is comprised. The graphics consist of mostly still or partially animated pictures which you click on with a mouse pointer while using different menu options to modify the effect of your clicks (you can also use hotkeys on the keyboard). Unlike the first iteration of Shadowgate the creators of this game have attempted to make the game feel less arbitrary and frustrating. The inclusion of multiple difficulty levels helps decrease frustration and increase replayability also. Unfortunately, this game has only 2 possible endings. 1) You die somehow and 2) You defeat the dread warlock lord and live unhappily ever after (due to the presence of an advertisement for a sequel).

+Good, relatively logical puzzles (so far as this type of game is concerned).
+Adequate controls for such a point-and-click style of game.
+Adequate writing.
+Will heavily remind you of the original without being as frustrating as the original.
+Multiple difficulty levels.
+No bugs.

+/-Mediocre sound with adequate voice acting.

-Not a great sense of mystery for such a puzzle type game.
-Mediocre (at best) graphics in a odd storyboard/storybook style.
-Fairly sedate music which can become repetitive over time.
-The ending is severely hampered by an advertisement for a sequel.
-Fairly generic story.

Story may seem a bit cliche, but considering that's it's a remake of a game that is almost 30 years old, I think that it's pretty much forgivable since this remake makes the game much more approachable to a wider audience.

Graphics feels top notched, and it's possibly my own computer issue or just me, but in retro graphics I can't seem to see anything that resembles anything. It's just a mish-mash of coloured pixels when trying to play in that mode.

Music can sometimes feel a bit eerie, giving you the ""all-alone"" feel which suits this theme and setting well.

UI feels a bit clunky if you use solely mouse to play, but fares better combining mouse and keyboard.

Difficulty is a welcome feature in this game as it makes it more approachable to people new to this kind of game especially where death looms at every step.

La trama è abbastanza semplice, nei panni di un coraggioso avventuriero saremo chiamati a sconfiggere il classico Male di turno; di fatto, si tratta giusto di un pretesto per farci esplorare l'enorme castello, l'ambientazione principale di questo gioco.

L'anima classica dell'orignale è ampiamente rispettata: il gioco fa parte di quel filone di avventure vecchio stampo che non risparmiano mazzate sulle gengive al giocatore, sia per quanto riguarda i numerosi enigmi, spesso criptici e non immediati, sia per il pericolo di morte che si cela dietro ogni decisione sbagliata, decisioni che sono molto facili da prendere.
Senza contare che, visto che la vita del personaggio dipende dalla durata delle vostre torce, avrete un minimo di azioni in cui completare il gioco (che resta alto anche alla massima difficoltà, specifichiamo).
In questo remake, comunque, sono presenti diverse difficoltà con enigmi più semplici e un sistema di aiuti ben integrato per venire incontro proprio ai novizi e ai pelandroni.

Davvero ottimo il restuaro che ha subito il titolo, tutte le varie schermate sono state ridisegnate a mano con uno stile grafico davvero efficace, senza contare il lavoro sulla nuova colonna sonora integrata (che è possibile tranquillamente sostituire con quella originale).

The hints aren't useful most of the time, so if you get stuck you end up having to find a walkthrough instead of the ""hint"" system actually providing ""hints"" on where to look next or whether a room even has anything of use anymore.

In the end, the game got me to go ""fuck it"" and uninstall when a particular part of the game decided to just undo some of my progress, forcing me to rerun a ""puzzle"" i had just done, all because another puzzle was locked behind this puzzle that required a clue in the far reaches of the levels. Travelling is a pain. Being forced to travel the same path three times after solving everything in your way is just terrible design when movement is already slow.

There's also a big negative that there's an explicit timer that starts early on and effectively voids your save if you don't get far enough. Since i used a walkthrough, that didn't affect me... but if you're the type to keep trying and figuring out puzzles all on your own, the game will literally force you to restart the entire game.

Overall, this game seems based on nostalgia. The art and voice acting is neat, but the story seems very barebones and typical ""one hero destined to vanquish evil sent into some corrupted dungeon"".

Multiplayer: No
Completion: 6 hrs
Cards: Yes
Cloud: No

I remember seeing Shadowgate for NES in magazines as a kid, and always wanted to try it out, but they never had it at my rental store. Now I get to have that chance, with much nicer eye candy. And... I must say it didn't disappoint, but it clearly is not a game for everybody. 

You take on the role of Jair. You want to beat the Warlock Lord. From there the story doesn't really get more complicated that that. It's pretty much your standard good-vs-evil tale. I would have liked some character development through dialogue. For example, there's a lady in a tower who would have been a good choice to converse with, but, well, that becomes moot pretty fast. Sure you become more powerful throughout the course of the game, but Jair never says anything short of grunts and tricks or treats.

Shadowgate comes from an era where dead-ends are both possible and common. I'm still against this design philosophy, but I can't totally blame them for wanting to keep the spirit of the original. Just be forewarned that it's quite possible to screw yourself over, so save often and in different slots. Speaking of which, I would have much liked the ability to name my save files. It gets kind of hard to tell which save is which..

Shadowgate boasts some very nice artwork, and is easy on the eyes. There's a fair amount of clutter in each scene, but I didn't have much difficulty picking out interactable objects, even without the use of F2. Retro graphics on the other hand is very harsh on the eyes. I recommend against using that, as it makes everything difficult to discern. I thought it would replicate the NES look, but instead it's like they took a mosaic filter and applied it to the screen. The music is pleasant, and fits the game quite nicely. It's never out of place and never obtrusive. Even better, the retro music works pretty well.

The interface is a tad on the clunky side. The inventory menu has a brief delay before you can interact with it, which is problematic when you need to access it so frequently. Thankfully you can set bindings, but that's more of a band-aid fix than a proper solution. The ability to use scroll wheel to go through items would have been nice. I suggest learning the keyboard shortcuts, as they will help speed up your progress in subsequent playthroughs. If you play the game entirely with the mouse, certain things feel remarkably slow.

There's 4 difficulty levels as of the time of this writing - Normal, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master. I ended up playing through all of them in order, and I will say there's a pretty good progression. What worked once before might work differently in a higher difficulty.  I had the most fun with Journeyman difficulty which provides a generous time frame, but lacks puzzles exclusive to Master, which hampered the enjoyment a bit. Master difficulty on the other hand is overkill. I nearly failed both curing myself and beating it by less than 20 turns each. I thought I had a firm grasp on what I needed to do to win, but apparently not!

From Apprentice difficulty and higher (all the ""Classic"" modes), the game starts to institute hard time limits, primarily in the way of torches. You only have so many turns before your torch flickers out and die. Torches aren't too difficult to find, even on Master difficulty. In all liklihood, you will probably die to the other natural time limits set by the game, especially on Master difficulty.

Compounding the time limit problem is the abundance of items that do absolutely nothing. At least in Bethesda games you can sell all that junk you acquire. In here, the items serve to waste your time and nothing more. Unused items just makes the game feel unfinished. Yes I know they're red herrings, but they feel like an oversight, especially for the adventure game genre.

The game tries its darnedest to be as cryptic as possible sometimes. Most obvious case is in regard to spells. There's no way anyone would know what the spells do, as the game provides vague descriptions when you examine and cast them. And on Master difficulty you really can't spend turns casting spells willy-nilly.

Most of the puzzles in the game make... some amount of sense. The early difficulties are easy enough to figure out on your own, at least with the help of Yorick. The later difficulties I admit to using a guide. Many altered puzzles have solutions I didn't see clues for. When have I ever needed to make a green fire or get a wet cloak?

Overall I found Shadowgate to be enjoyable enough to sit through it through all difficulties. While I can't fault it for trying to be faithful to the original, I can fault the original for its curious design choices. If there's one thing I would have liked, it's the ability to play on Master mode without time limits, because I enjoyed the sheer number of things to see in there, but had no time to see all of it. I think Shadowgate falls into a 7/10.

Until recently, I had never heard of this title but apparently Shadowgate is one of the most well known point and click adventure titles in history. It was one of the original titles in the popular MacVenture series that went on to be celebrated on the NES, GBC, and Nintendo 64 so this game has alot of history behind it. This version of Shadowgate has been completely remastered by the original developement team from the ground up adding tons of new content to the game. The title thrusts you into the role of ""The Seed Of Prophecy"", a somewhat novice but ""chosen"" mage tasked with traveling to the living castle Shadowgate in hopes of defeating the evil that dwells within...the dreaded warlock lord.

Gameplay-wise, the title is presented in the first person perspective with a very minimal heads up display. Your character moves throughout the bowels of castle Shadowgate room by room searching for clues to aid you in your quest while also collecting items and trying to avoid death at the hands of traps, creatures and just plain stupidity. The various puzzles that you have to solve during your questing are the true high point of this game. You have to be keen to figure out many of these puzzles in order to advance the story and some of them will have you wanting to toss your keyboard through the nearest plate glass window. Beware as there will be some frustrating moments to be had in this game but that just makes the reward of solving the puzzles that much more enjoyable once you finally figure them out. Remember that sense of accomplishment that you felt in Dark Souls when you finally defeated that boss after the 103rd try? Kinda like that...kinda.

Graphically, this game is very beautiful. As I stated earlier, this is a remastered version with all new stunningly gorgeous handpainted artwork from beggining to end. The game interface is easy to use and highly customizable. The sound effects are extremely well done, very crisp and fit the title perfectly. The musical score is amazing. It changes depending on the situation and the place that you are inside of castle Shadowgate and does a wonderful job of immersing you within the title.

I was able to complete the game in just under 14 hours but of course I like to explore and backtrack so the typical gamer should be able to finish it in 10-12 hours. It's a short title but very enjoyable especially if you like this genre of games. This was my first dive into this category of gaming and it was a terrific experience that has me looking forward to playing more titles like this one. In fact, there is an available option that let's you turn on the retro version of the game so I definitely plan to go back and replay it in it's original form as soon as possible. When the next game, Beyond Shadowgate due in 2016, comes out I plan to be first in line to get my copy. This title is highly recommended to the puzzle solving adventure gamer or even someone just looking for a different gaming experience.

Pour les autres en version rapide alors.
Un excellent remake, digne de son prédécesseur sur NES, si vous aimez les points & clicks et les ambiances heroic-fantasy, vous pouvez y aller, vous ne serez pas déçu.
Dans les points forts:
- Réalisation au top, que ce soit graphisme ou musique, c'est nickel
- C'est un jeu avec du cachet. Il y a une vrai patte artistique unique. Ca rappelle un peu les graphismes des cinématiques de Guild Wars 2 mais en ""différent""
- A quelques coquilles près, le jeu est relativement bien traduit en français.
- Jeu difficile qui ne vous tient pas par la main si vous jouez au plus haut niveau de difficulté. Le jeu est assez punitif mais c'est là tout le ""sel"" du jeu. Si vous baissez la difficulté, les enigmes seront bien plus simple et vous disposerez de plusieurs méthodes pour ""passer"" les enigmes.
- le vieux Shadowgate m'a été offert avec ce remake.

Points faibles:
- une interface un peu vieillote, il y avait moyen de faire plus simple, plus ergonomique. Au final, ce n'est pas très dérangeant, mais c'est juste qu'au lieu de faire deux clics, vous en faîtes trois là où le jeu aurait pu être plus ""intelligent"" dans son approche

[h1]Intro[/h1]
Shadowgate est le 1er jeu de la sorte que je fait.
Et bien j'avoue avoir TOTALEMENT accroché a ce jeu, malgré une certaine difficulté pour moi envers certaines énigmes  (oui parfois ce jeu es tres difficile, en tout cas pour moi, j'avoue que quelq'un m'a pas mal aider).


[h1]Graphismes/Décors[/h1]
Graphiquement, il y a un style que je qualifirait de  ''style aquarelle'', on croirait jouer sur une peinture, c'est tres agréable je trouve. Ceci dit, un chouya de details en plus ne m'aurait pas déplu, mais ca passe tres largement quand même.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
La prise en main est tres simple, il y a des raccourcis clavier tres utiles pour economisé du temps. Il faut chercher partout, mais VRAIMENT partout. Il faut parfois faire un retour au debut du jeu pour débloquer qque chose beaucoup plus loin, ce qui rend le jeu immersif car on scrute tout le decor a s'en explosé les yeux trop pres de l'ecran.
Le jeu est taquin...............oui oui taquin, car tout les objets recuperables ne sont pas forcements utilisables, ce qui fait marché les méninges a toute berzingue.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Le seul et unique bémol a ce jeu, ce trouve être l'absence de voix francaises, d'habitude cela est pour moi rédibitoire quand a l'achat d'un jeu. mais les voix sont belles a entendres.
Alors [i]''pourquoi l'a tu acheter gros couillon''[/i] me direz vous.......................ben j'ai pas fait gaffe en fait hihi ^^
Et je dois avouer que j'ai bien fait de pas faire gaffe a cela, car je serai passer a coté d'un très très bon jeu.
Et je peut déjà dire que la suite je l'aurai pour sure !!



Alors oui je le recommande chaudement pour tous les aspects du jeu.

Ich gebe zu, dass ich es nur mit Komplettlösung geschafft habe, es ohne aber auch gar nicht erst bis zum Ende gespielt hätte.

Der Hauptgrund dafür liegt tatsächlich an den Rätseln und dem Gameflow. Man findet haufenweise Krams, danach kommt man irgendwohin, wo man nicht weiterkommt und kombiniert danach X mit Y solange bis etwas passt oder man frustriert weiterzieht. Während das am Anfang noch einigermaßen okay war, wurde es irgendwann nur noch lästig. Ohne die Komplettlösung wäre ich wahrscheinlich noch tagelang umhergeirrt und hätte verzweifelt versucht DAS eine Objekt zu finden, mit dem ich vielleicht Gegenstand XYZ noch nicht kombiniert habe, nur um dann zum nächsten Punkt weiterzulaufen.

Gut möglich, dass das Game für Hardcore Puzzle Fans super ist, für mich als Neuling war der Anfängermodus schon absolut abschreckend.

An enjoyable and (if you ignore the fact that it's set in a fantasy world full of magic etc.) so far pretty straight forward, first-person adventure game. No nonsensical (il)logic puzzles, although having said that, it was (save for Starship Titanic) generally always the 3rd person point'n'click variety that had that type of thing...

...Shadowgate has just the kind of stuff that's typical to first-person adventure games, but most definitely at the easier end of that continuum (nothing like Schizm or Rhem here (at least not so far)).

Reminds me a little of Zork Inquisitor (just without the overt humour) although having said that it does seem that much of its text could be read as being very subtly toungue-in-cheek (I'm not a fan of obnoxious, flip and glib commentary in video games and thankfully there's none of that here).

Altogether a very enjoyable game (if you're into 1st person adventures and aren't looking for something that's going to play like a graphically enhanced mensa test, as so many of the 1st person adventure games of the past have tended to do).

The biggest (and for me really the only) potential problem I've encountered so far is the possibility of overlooking relevant objects and actions (if you don't want to pixel hunt every node and be subjected to skimming the same descriptive text over and over again, which you would almost certainly have to do on the higher difficulty setting (and why anyone would want to play like that is beyond me. For me (outside of the crazy logic typical of the 3rd person point'n'click adventrures) that's the biggest flaw in the adventure game format.)). 

Thankfully there is a hint system and a button to reveal the hotspots and on the easier difficulty, all possible actions appear in the context menu when you click on each hotspot (one cavaet to that is that I have to say that (apart from Telltale's adventures) I don't think I've played a single adventure game that isn't incompletable due to broken design or glitchy programming. One can only hope that Shadowgate can be updated should that be the case here).

One criticism I do have, is the relatively poor quality of the sound-files. I've got an Asus Xonar Essence STX driving a mid-range 3-point speaker setup that staggered the reviewers for their quality within their price range. One common criticisms of my speaker setup was the quality of the trebble, and while, for the most part, it's more or less unnoticable, the sound that Shadowgate's pushing out of my speakers is sharp to the point of discomfort. It's the first time I've experienced this with my speakers and it almost sent me -- thinking there might be a fault somewhere in my setup -- reaching over to check my hardware.
         
I'm not sure why Shadowgate's sound should be as it is, unless for file-size convenience but I can only imagine that on cheaper speaker setups, or worse still, the kind of speakers that are built into monitors, Shadowgate's sound may very well, rather than just failing to enhance the game, be tinny enough to actually mar the experience.

My sound set up is capable of creating sound that envelopes and absorbs the player into it but Shadowgate's sound almost seems like it's doing its best to be impenetrable, to the point of almost feeling kind of repellent, and it's a shame. I wanted to turn the volume up and have Shadowgate's audioscape unfold around me, but unfortunately the quality was just not there. It would seem that with no size-restrictions in terms of limited CD or DVD space, games these days could have very full, very clear audio but unfortunately that just doesn't seem to be the case with Shadowgate.

I'm actually so glad they re-made it and if you can appreciate this game for what it is, you should be able to appreciate what Kemco had to work with back in 1987 as a point and click Adventure game! The game now has a more in-depth storyline, tricky puzzles and animations that were once still pixelated images of rooms in the Castle Shadowgate. If you enjoy point and click puzzle game apps on your smart phone, you'll definitely enjoy this game. If you are indeed new to this game, stop reading right here and ignore my critique of the pros and cons of the game else you'll forever curse yourself with many spoilers! I don't mean to spoil this game too much, but I'd like to share my concerns and thoughts with the community that have been waiting for this game to be re-made for so very long.

**SPOILER ALERT**

If you are already familiar with the 1987 Kemco Shadowgate realm, continue reading this scroll as it will disappear once you finished reading it! You won't learn any new spells, but you may either want to agree or disagree with some of the points I have to make about the re-make of the already awesome Shadowgate game by Kemco.

Now First off, I've got to say, I was a little disaappointed with some of the many things they left out of the game. Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the Classic game and I pay alot of attention to detail. So much, in fact, that I fashioned an entire map on Minecraft of a Shadowgate Replica with working traps and exact(: as much as Minecraft can provide) room structure. It took me a HELL of a long time to make. Now on to the pros and cons.

The Pros: (Simple and Sweet)
-Great Artwork and Animation (Beautiful done)
-Interesting use of Puzzles and New ones added (Alot the same as the classic but some new ones that boggled my mind)
-Beautiful Story telling (Got more out of the story than just being placed in a world where I have to kill a warlock lord)
-Improved versions of Songs used in the original (Feelings of Nostalgia once I played)
-Great new tip system (helped me out alot in situations compared to the original)

The Cons: (Now I know it's not the same game but I was expecting certain similarities and some were frustrating because it didn't make sense, but others are minor)
-Not all the rooms were re-worked (we're missing a few rooms from the original which were key to storyline)
-Enemies were placed in different locations (as well as some being left out or changed, it was exciting but also, I was expecting sharks instead of an octopus/squid. Also, the Goblin had to be punched instead of hit with a rock and slingshot)
-Alot of the story was changed (such as the Behemoth being attacked would result in death, the warlock lord being attacked would also result in death. I would like someone to explain to me, why the Elemental Spirits are ""Evil"" according to the hint given? Doesn't make much sense... Would have been alright if you used the staff of ages on the warlock Lord instead.
-Some music was left out (There were plenty of GREAT tracks in the classic Shadowgate, almost one for each room. Some of the rooms had the same track of the first room playing. I just think they should have kept the music of each room after re-working it, I bought the DLC with the soundtrack and I only admired one song which is the end credits due to it going through every track Shadowgate had in a guitar rock style. Other than that, the rest of the music is the same style, slow and creepy. Still good but I think they really could have done so many more orchestrations and I'm not sure what their reason is for not making more for the game.

So there, that's my thoughts on such a great game! Most of my cons were more towards a critical point of view but it still should not deter anyone (new or veteran) from buying and playing this game. Regardless of the Cons I give it a 5/5 for being re-worked and bringing this overly critical guy some Nostalgia. I beat the game in normal mode, I'm going to try the harder modes to see if maybe i missed something. I'll check back and possibly re-tract some of my Cons in the future.

I played the Nes version a few years ago and thought is was very well thought out with the puzzles and creativity.  

Decades later and here is the remastered version!

The story is very satisfying in the way you feel every time you get to the next part of the story after doing some puzzles that you  truly earned it.

The game is set up in three modes Easy, Normal, Hard.  The Harder the game the harder the puzzles.

The game is pretty much point and click.  You go threw dungeons and click the next screen, locate and find items, weapons, spells, and Ghosts/demons/etc  Make sure you have the right things equipped for the rooms ahead and use everything you got on everything in the room.  Smash Mirrors with hammers, Fight or avoid dragons, Smack a talking skull upside the head, steal all the torches you can get into your bag and talk to a really old wizard that will show you the way to kick an evil Warlocks butt!

PROS:  
The Art Style is fantastic
Voiceovers are done well
The Music is gripping.
The puzzles are done amazingly well and still stand up today.
You carry a talking skull named Yorik with you who helps you out in a jam or cracks jokes at your expense.


CONS:
The Person reading this thinks the game stinks because they are not good at puzzles.

I'm satisfied witht the graphics and audio and gameplay was good up til (for me) about 4 hours into the game playing on normal (not classic). To that point I had played withtout the need for looking anything up on the internet and solving everything myself (maybe using the hint system a couple times to move things along). I had figured the developers had learned their lesson about annoying garbage that plagued adventure games of the past. Then I encountered this game's Achilles heal: you get to a puzzle and can't proceed because you missed something you never even knew existed, don't know exactly what it is or where it is, and the only choice is having to go through every room in the game again until you hopefully find it. Very minor spoiler here of where this started for me: there's a crystal puzzle in this game and after solving it you're supposed to cast a spell on it to activate a bridge. Problem was, I never encountered this particular spell. It would be somewhat tolerable though annoying to then look at an online guide, though most guides out there seem be written for classic mode. And since the game isn't so linear, you'll have to read through those guides pretty well before noticing the solution. That wasn't the only time something like this happened (another instance  for example is the rune puzzle) and when the annoyances started piling up I found myself mostly just sticking to the guides to speed things up and get it over with. So that's when the game starts feeling more like work than play. So bottom line is that although I enjoyed it at first, I felt barely compelled to complete Shadowgate and ultimately can't recommend it.

One nice thing about this game compared to many other point and click games is that there are four distinct difficulty levels that  make major changes to what puzzles you will face.  This option makes the game accessible for novice/casual player while still providing a challenge for the most hardcore players.  Also, if you start on one of the lower difficulty levels, you can play again on a harder level and its almost like a whole new game, with all sorts of new items and puzzles.

If your a novice puzzle solver you can play this on the easy difficulty (if your a cry baby) but it nerfs the challenge in avoiding deaths, less puzzles, solutions will be solved for you, some puzzle rooms will be unloseable but that doesn't mean you won't die on easy mode because you still can from tons of trial and error.

But then again if your a novice you shouldn't start with this game I recommend Sam n Max, Monkey Island, Kings Quest 1 Remake or Leisure Suit Larry for great laughs and easier difficulty.

One thing my nostalgia wants to nitpick is that the atmosphere doesn't quite feel the same as the NES version, but I think that just might be difficult to recapture. It does, in many ways, feel like a hidden object game, only without the hidden object scenes. However, there are four difficulty settings, which add increasingly more rooms to explore and more complex puzzles to solve, and even the easiest one is harder than the hardest hidden object game I've completed. So, it is definitely a challenge for those familiar with the original, but many features (such as a new hint system provided by a talking skull named Yorick) make it accessible to newcomers. The multiple difficulty settings, plus the myriad achievements, also solve the ""lack of replay value"" that the original game had.

While the game wears its roots on its sleeve, which is good for hardcore fans, it also contains numerous pop culture references, some of them more appropriate than others. This also accounts for some of the difference in atmosphere between this and the original: The original seemed very much like it took place in its own world - the descriptions of lands beyond the castle itself created a great sense of the bigger picture. But all the references here project a mixed sense of being in a game world that somehow knows about things from unrelated properties. At least it has a lot of monsters , unlike Shadowgate 64, which had almost none.

Probably more important than the references are some of the story changes, particularly those involving the final boss, that longtime fans may or may not approve of. I'm not entirely sure of what to think of them, myself, and I was wondering if the final puzzle or ending would change at all on the harder settings to be more true to the original, but neither does. The remake also leans far more heavily into the horror genre. While the original had some gory death descriptions, the remake has some that are played out in cutscenes and are even far more disturbing than the worst ones in Uninvited. Not necessarily a negative point, just something you might want to be aware of.

The orchestral soundtrack is based on the melodies of the NES version, but there is also an option to use the actual NES chiptunes, which works surprisingly well.

All-in-all, this is a pretty strong recommendation, whether you're new to Shadowgate or not. Hardcore fans may not approve of all the changes, but there is still plenty of challenge and fun to be had. Even that elusive Goblin Room makes an appearance.

I know some people are saying it's not as good because it can be clunky but in all honesty part of the challenge to the game back in the day was having to run around the castle. I feel that in the modern age of gaming people are becoming too used to linear games and quickly lose interest in anything that lacks that. I'm not saying it's their fault but games have changed from being a challenge based form of entertainment to a linear play through movie and if there isn't enough action to pull your attention for 75% of the game it then is labeled as ""dry"" or ""boring"" But the lack of linear game play is  refreshing for this old school gamer.

Yeah, they didn't bother with the academy award for originality back then.
If that's a problem, definitely pass on Shadowgate!

Otherwise, stay for the beautiful graphics. 
Puzzles are solid, thick, tight.
Music and sfx are flat out fantastic!

Generally, the whole atmosphere is captured brilliantly. 
I yawned in Myst and Riven, but there's something to be said about running out of torches while there's grunts and hisses coming from foreboding caverns in front of you.

A whole bunch of difficulty settings will accomodate everyone from casual coffeesippers to l33t mousebenders.
Highest difficulty will produce a LOT of oldschool deaths by dragonfire, deathly darkness or defenestration.

É diferente o suficiente para fazer o jogador quebrar a cabeça ao resolver os novos puzzles, mas semelhante o bastante para trazer boas memórias para quem jogou as versões antigas.

O jogo diz respeito a um mago senhor das trevas que pretende subjulgar o mundo ao invocar uma força misteriosa contida em uma câmara secreta. O jogador é escolhido e guiado através das muralhas do castelo para derrotar o mago e impedi-lo de concretizar seus planos.

A história é instigante e bem explorada através de cutscenes e pequenos fragmentos de texto encontrados durante a jogatina, mas por vezes, as palavras arcaicas e forma de escrita rebuscada podem dificultar o entendimento por não nativos, já que o jogo só está disponível em inglês.

Os puzzles são, no geral, muito bem feitos e desafiadores, mas alguns deles são bitolados em uma só solução, de forma que se tornam injustos. Por exemplo, um objeto não quebra com martelada, daí você imagina que a solução não é quebrar, e fica dando voltas e voltas até descobrir que tal item só quebra se bater com a mão...

Uma coisa legal é que foi incluída a possibilidade de se jogar com as músicas, texto e transições originais da versão anterior de Shadowgate. Há também uma forma clássica dos controles, mas ela é semelhante à versão antiga para Mac, e não a versão para NES que foi a que eu joguei.

No geral, Shadowgate é um grande jogo que faz jus a memória de seu antecessor e superou minhas expectativas de um mero remake. Recomendo a todos que apreciam o estilo. MUITO BOM (8/10).",1422807907,1512443559,True,19,0,0.727252781391143799,2,True,False,False,False,,,

這款遊戲從以前到現在，就是一個難!  難是他的特色。

對沒有玩過的玩家，他的難有這幾點 (新舊版都一樣) :
[olist]
[*] 你會死，而且死很多次。所以你要時常存檔。
[*] 你需要火把，否則你會死，而火把是會熄滅的，火把的數量也有限，這意味著你只有有限的行動次數。
[*] 你在前半段的時候，就會被惡靈詛咒，若不找到解除詛咒的方法，你會死。所以遊戲前半段的第一個大目標，就是解除詛咒，而你的時間有限。不少玩家對這一點很感冒，不過，這已經是這個遊戲的特色了。我想若是再出下一版，這一點大概也會繼續被保留吧!
[*] 遊戲內有不少不重要的物品，或是沒用的物品。這會增加你嘗試的負擔，導致你的死亡。不過新版中，很多物品，雖然不是主線破關必須的，卻是其他支線謎題所需的。
[*] 因為以上幾點，所以你時常會在許多不同的時間點存檔。當嘗試了很多很多步驟，用掉很多火把，終於得到一些進展後，就要讀取以前的數據，用正確步驟再來一次。這款遊戲你是可以存很多slot的。
[/olist]

新舊版有什麼不一樣呢?
[olist]
[*] 新版有三個難度可以選擇。每種難度的謎題解法會有差異。難度低的火把多且火把時間也長。
[*] 雖然有不少房間是跟舊版一樣，但是大多數的謎題都不一樣了。所以舊版的解法可沒多大用處喔。只有少數解法是一模一樣，應該是給老玩家回味的。新版還多了不少新的地方可以探索的，主要在後半段的地方。
[*] 新版的 Inventory 可以放很多很多東西，應該是沒有限制了。不像舊版東西不能放太多。
[*] 新版的魔法是看卷軸學，學會就可以無限制使用。不像舊版只能用一次。新版本魔法數目也比舊版多了不少。
[*] 新版除了主線謎題之外，還多了不少支線謎題。不少成就跟這些支線謎題有關。
[*] 多了提示系統。不過若你選的難度高，提示就越隱晦，用處越少。

What they actually did was re-imagine most of the entire game, changed a ton of the puzzles, changed how a bunch of them worked and put in a LOT of back tracking into the game.

The classic game already had a standard ""timer"" with the torches that didn't allow you drag your feet all day, but it was spaced out enough to the point where the system was ""fair"". Not only does this game still have that timer, but worse, they enforce a mandatory curse that will end your game every time unless you can solve it.

What I do consider good about this game is that they built a world because there is just so much stuff that has nothing to do with the solution there are even side-quests and many things that you will not see if you only stick to the path. There is still a problem with that though because its a time limited game I don't feel that the exploration aspect really fits though I do applaud the fact that it is there. 

The extra difficulties are nice as well, especially since they made the puzzles different, so playing on higher difficulties changes the game slightly. Unfortunately I don't find the lower difficulties to be necessary. They are too easy and master difficulty is not any harder just ""longer"" by a few steps here and there. I think there's a stigma that this game is super hard and they tried to reinforce this with the difficulty levels but starting at anything below master is really just a waste of time.

In closing I also want to say I was a bit disappointed in that there were not as many deaths as I thought there would be because I thought that was a big part of the game. I might have fallen from a few things or gotten shanked by some goblins but nothing I didn't see coming. From what I understand most of the deaths, or at least the good ones, you have to actually try to find. If you stick to solving the game though you will not die very often or at all which is the opposite of what I was expecting.",1420514602,1420514602,False,3,1,0.468767851591110229,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For the most part, the 2014 remake of Shadowgate is faithful, while also being respectful in its adaptation. This isn't a 100% translation. While some things you may remember from the past are still present in this version of the game, others may be absent or changed, while new puzzles and features have been added. The spirit of what made Shadowgate great is intact however and that's what's most important.

It would be easy to quibble over the changes and additions made to this version of the game, but ultimately they are no better or worse than what was in the game to begin with. Certain puzzles still require odd leaps of logic and certain connections sometimes feel a bit stretched, but I've experienced worse and in the context of the game world it's forgivable. Ultimately I enjoyed Shadowgate and the addition of difficulty levels (with differing puzzles and win conditions) and achievements for time and turn limits, mean that there's decent replayability here.

リメイク版ならではの特徴はまず難易度が四段階になったこと。
（※Normal x1とClassic x3に分かれているが、実質的に地続きの四段階）
低難度では死亡選択肢が減るだけでなく、重要性の低い部屋やアイテムが省略されるなどかなり大胆な改変が入る。もともとこのゲームは大量の死亡パターンが変に話題を呼んだだけで、当時でも理不尽さの少ない良作とされていたのだが、その雰囲気を殺さない良調整といえる。

一方難易度を上げていくとかつての歯ごたえが帰ってくるわけだが、このとき同じ謎でも解法が変わったり全く新しい場面が増えたりするので、最大で四周は新鮮さを保ったまま遊べるのが嬉しい。加えて「○○を全て見つけ出す」系のやりこみ実績も豊富なため、レトロアドベンチャーゲームの弱点であるリプレイ性の低さが補われており、価格に対する満足度比も高い。それでいてエンディングを一度見るだけなら原作準拠の適度な長さにおさまるので中だるみもなく、ボリュームとリプレイ性のバランスがよくとれている。

必要な英語力はそこそこ。行動に対するメッセージだけならさほど難しくないのでパズル感覚で遊ぶこともできるが、巻物の形で散らばったフレーバーテキストを全て理解しようとするとさすがに骨が折れる。とはいえ古文バリバリというタイプではないのでその点は大丈夫。
原作スタッフが監修しているだけあってフレーバーは十分厚く書き足されており、原作プレイ済みの人も初めての人も違和感なく入り込めるはず。カットシーン頼みの演出面などにはやや安易さを感じないでもないが、全体としてはかなり高評価をつけられる作品。",1420031565,1420088845,True,76,2,0.875258505344390869,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've just finished my first run through of it on ""Normal"" mode (which has to be considered easy mode by the looks of it - possibly even in comparison to the easiest of the retro modes), and I completed it in one session.  

I was only stuck once or twice, and sure enough it was largely down to me not noticing things I should have noticed.  I will say that in 2 areas this was not the case though;  one scene involving mirrors did not work correctly until I saved and re-opened the game, the other major issue there was a pumpkin based puzzle (a side mission) I could not complete.  I even watched a playthrough of that section to make sure I had done everything correctly, and it simply wouldn't work.

The main gripe I had though, and the one major warning I'll give anyone reading this, is that the controls are horribly old fashioned.  I ended up using the keyboard as all the clicking to do simple tasks was doing my head in.  An example with the keyboard would be as follows (same thing with clicks but you need to keep moving the mouse to different icons as you go):

Task - use an item on an object in the scene
1 - Press I to open inventory
2 - Press U for Use
3 - Press I to close inventory
4 - Click on object you wish to use it on

If you wish to use the object on multiple items, you need to do this every single time.  Sometimes it doesn't register properly either.  This was a major frustration for me, seeing as this is a point and click adventure game.  I know they were going full retro, but they could have implemented something in there to cut out a hell of a lot of clicking.  

With that said I still recommend this game, if you can get it on sale.  It is a fun adventure, with a so-so story, pretty images, and some puzzles that will make you scratch your head.  I'm guessing the harder modes are an awful lot harder.

The issues I've mentioned keep it from being a full price recommendation.  Only get it if you think the controls wont drive you mad.",1419995671,1419995671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

あのクリックアドベンチャーのシャドウゲート（神ゲー）がリメイク。
シャドウゲートといえば、他のクリックアドベンチャーにない個性豊かなテキスト。ダークファンタジー。雰囲気がすばらしいゲームです。

COMMANDS/AUDIO/TEXTをレトロに変更可能。絵はドットからウェット感のあるペイント画になってます。
難易度は、新しく追加されたノーマル（命の松明の火が消えない）・クラシック（見習い・中級・マスター）。難易度が上がるごとにアイテムの位置と数が違います。謎解きも難しくなります。
途中から、オプションでリメイクとレトロと切り替えいつでも可になってます。結構、音の質は上がってるような気がします。
ＦＣ版とアイテムとかが違うところがたくさんあって驚きました。
ノーマル最短距離クリアーすると１時間ぐらいの内容ですが、やりこみ要素も多くて、難易度によって謎解きが少し違ったりして面白いです。実績解除好きにはいいではないでしょうか。
クリアーした後も、あのＢＧＭが耳に残りました。

悪い点を上げるとしたら、ＦＣと比べて画が表現しすぎ。
それと、グラフィックレトロはぼやかしただけ。よくない。
あと、日本語非対応。

でも、元がすばらしいのでsteamのリメイク版をぜひ開発していただければと思います。
それと英語のみなので、英語苦手な場合は日本語化ができるようになるまで待つのが吉。

実績に関しては、ほかのゲームと比べて難易度が高いです。

- It's not an RPG in any way regarding skilling, equipping or upgrading your character. You don't have skills, attributes or whatsoever you could manage or upgrade. You can't buy or sell items and all items you find in the game are basically ""use item x for adventure element y (e.g. use the only arrow you'll find in the whole game against precisely one specific enemy).
- There are no fights in the classical sense. You don't aim or use skills or the like against enemies. You use item x, which is specifically designed to be used in this ""fight"" on the enemy or another item to win the fight. 
- There are some clues about what to do, but like in most adventures, you'll end up several times with spamming item x or ability y on everything you can to see if it has any effect. I felt really lost during the late game when I was just running around and trying to figure out where's the chance to progress with the game.
- There are NO, I repeat, NO possibilities for alternative ways to get around a challenge. You either stick to the scripted plan of using item a on element b in situation c after you've accomplished event d or you are srewed. That's actually the reason why adventures died out some time ago.

I am also one who grew up Atari/Nintendo and still own this title on my 8-bit NES and this game pays true homage to the way it was. The retro sound is awesome, and they even kept the retro controls although I have finally adapted to the newer controls with the right-clicking; but they are not mandatory, the controls of old are still there, just not in the NES format to a T...just slightly modified but work the same. The retro graphics look a little off to me, but then again, we are in the day of 1080p-4K and there is only so much you can do to make it look good, yet old. So props to the developer for a great job on both aspects.

I still love to play the original and my Shadowgate 64 every couple of years to keep my wits about me and it never gets old. I hope they go to the newer edition from here, but if not, I cannot justify any negativity for the game this is and I am proud for how this turned out in the end.

Я не сильно люблю квести, тим більше point&click, але ця гра зацікавила. Поглянув на форуми - школярі люто плачуть, кажучи ""навіщо такі важкі ігри виускати!?"" - значить треба брати. В оригінал не грав (але пограю, бо тепер його додають в комплект до гри), але читав що в людей там пригорало все що могло пригоріти, гра нічого не пояснювала, нічого не підсказувала і не жаліла гравців. І знаєте що? Тут так само. Череп Йорік (привіт, Гамлет) більше насміхається над героєм ніж дає якісь хороші поради. На високому рівні складності можна померти від всього що є навколо і ніхто тебе не попередить , що це неможна, те небажано. Хочеш тикнути в себе ножем - будь ласка, нам то що. Навіть є секретні пасхальні смерті =)

Гра дає вибір - грати в казуальному режимі чи в класичному. В казуальному думати всерівно треба, правда вмирати будете менше та й багато головоломок просто вирізано, тому рекомендую грати в класичному. Класичний ж режим веде нас до ще одного вікна зміни складності - там є вибір між Новачком, Підмайстром і Майстром. І навіть тут є різниця між квестами та методами їх виконання, а також різниця в часових рамках. Ще присутня опція - Залізна Людина. Ні, ви не перетворюєтесь в Тоні Старка. Вибравши цю опцію, вам прийдеться пройти гру без збереженнь.

Графічно гра виконана чудово, всі сценки і предмети намальовані, анімовано в стилі коміксів, інколи є більш активна анімація. Можна міняти стиль графіки від сучасного до ретро (в пікселях). Також є можливість перейти на ретро озвучку, але як на мене то композитор сучасної версії постарався на славу, і 8-бітний саундтрек може порадувати хіба олдфагів. Озвучка голосу оповідача прекрасна, допомагає погрузитися в атмосферу з перших секунд.

Сам геймплей по суті - класичний point&click, лише на відміну від сучасних варіантів - ніхто нічого тобі не підсвічує, ніхто нічого не показує - треба пильно дивитися по сторонах, пропустити важливий предмет легше легкого. Ще є така штука в грі як факели. Тривалість горіння факела залежить від дії та рухів по локаціях. Якщо факел загас - все, пітьма. І хоча вона вас не вбиває і можна чекати вічність (якщо ви звичайно не прокляті :) - будь-який крок - і ви потрапляєте в якусь халепу, що приводить до смерті. Після останніх оновлень, інтерфейс став більш зручним і не загромаджує екран гри. 

Сюжет в цілому не є якимусь видатним - є герой, є наставник, є велике зло. По ходу гри на очі потрапляють книги, листи та записки з яких можна дізнатися про світ. В цілому це читати цікаво. Правда є одне ""НО"" - локалізації немає і якщо ви не знаєте англійської - то вам буде нецікаво і безмежно важко. Бо знати, що від тебе хочуть важливо, життєво важливо. Хоча це скоріше недолік не гри, а ваш - знання мови ніколи не буде лишнім =)

В заключення хочу сказати - однозначний маст хев. 10 з 10. Шедевр. Навіть якщо ви не любите квестів, але любите челендж в грі - ця гра для вас. Ця гра заставить вас помучатись, провисіти на деяких моментах годинами, а іколи і перепройти заново через запороті моменти або несвоєчасно виконані дії (у випадку якщо ви не робите збереженнь часто). Не рекомендується людям, які чекають від гри піу-піу-піу, або ""Press X to win""",1416911919,1416912056,True,14,0,0.654784440994262695,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+A remake of the classic 1987 Shadowgate, but doesn't feel phoned in or a simple cash grab. The game is faithful to the original, but expands greatly upon it.
+Fans of the original (and later re-releases, including the popular NES version) will absolutely love the option to choose either the new transitions and music or the original 1987 music and transitions.
+The new music pieces are not simply remixes of the original pieces, but rather hauntingly-beautiful retellings.
+Game difficulty determines how hard and how long the game is. A puzzle that requires backtracking or multiple steps on Hard will either be simplified or outright removed on Easy.
+The game's many causes of death reinforces the idea that you don't need your hand held to have fun.

Cons:

-Whoever thought of the idea for retro graphics mode needs to be fired. The ""retro"" option simply places a filter over the screen, pixelating everything. Imagine playing a game that runs at a native 1920x1080, then changing the resolution to 320x200. That's how bad it is. Unlike the transitions and the music, it is in no way faithful to the original game.
-Unlike the original, the game gives you no indication that your torch is about to go out, leading to an untimely and unexpected death. The NES version had its own music piece to warn you when your torch was about to go out.
-Newcomers to the game may be put off by all the trial-and-error they will have to do, as many of the puzzle solutions seem counter-intuitive.

Friends and I would sit in Biology class drawing maps and comparing notes, then spending the evenings on the phone doing the same.  This lasted until the end of the game; it was pretty great. 

Naturally, when I heard that there was a remake of Shadowgate coming to Steam, my curiosity was piqued immediately.  It was easy to worry though that my fondness of the game only existed in the rose colored glasses of nostalgia.  Thankfully, once I got my hands on the remake, I discovered that Shadowgate was in fact a great game and the remake was pretty great in its own right. 

I've never been one much for modern adventure games, but Shadowgate seems to be a shining example of the genre.  Its packed with some great graphics updates and a great score.  The game play proves to be fun too.  I was worried that a point and click style adventure game wouldn't hold my attention.  Since this game has a good story that gets unveiled the further you journey with hints and clues scattered about the castle, it manages to be pretty engrossing.  It's common finding myself coming back to the game sooner than expected just to find out more story.  This is a strong trait for a strong adventure game!

[i]Disclaimer: I have never played the original game and played though this one mostly on easy settings.[/i]

[b]Major Pros:[/b]
Great art
Interesting puzzles of fair difficulty level
Well planned storyline makes sure players never get too far unintentionally ill prepared
New user interaction methods are fast and easy
No clicking around randomly on every room to find everything (clear markers show all visible interactable objects while secrets are hinted at in gameplay and Yorick can help you if you're stuck)
Clever usage of items to solve puzzles

[b]Minor Pros:[/b]
An easy access log is kept of everything the game tells you
Harder modes encourage smart game play with interesting ways to die while easier modes protect inexperienced players
Hints (for those that use them) are helpful without directly telling you what to do

[b]Major Cons:[/b]
Can't use the map to ""port"" to places you've already been (walking can take a while, especially toward the end of the game)
Message pop up on certain rooms that you have to click on to dismiss or you can't keep walking even if you've seen them before

[b]Minor Cons:[/b]
Spell descriptions are rather vague and result in you trying the spells on everything a lot to figure out what they do
There are some annoying goblins that randomly attack you for no apparent reason, but defeating them is the same every time
More could've been done to flesh out the story

Even on the easier modes I found the game very enjoyable. The art was nice and the puzzles appropriate and complex. Nothing felt forced in the game and I didn't feel like I'd missed anything by not playing the original game.

Graphics: Not too bad at all, but any time there is an intense animation on my screen, I get a very noticable framerate drop in the animation itself. The good looking scenery is actually a little bit of a hindrance, because the environment doesn't offer a lot of context clues on items to be picked up or alternate rooms to go into. Everything blends together a little too well.

Sound: AMAZING. Orchestral arrangements of the classic music, decent sound effects.

Controls: The UI is clunky beyond belief. SCUMM worked back in the day, but In the modern era, not so much. Not tweaking the interface (and actually making it worse at times with what changes were made) for the sake of nostalgia is a bad design choice. The inventory system is horrible. Click command. Open inventory. Click on item. Close inventory. Click on environment.

Gameplay: I  remember the old NES version well enough to remember most of the puzzles, but when the devs added in their new content, everything falls apart. They provide little to no context as to what you need to do, and the in-game hint system is a joke. They also put in a ""banshee curse"" in the beginning section which will eventually kill you, and if you take too long getting through the game and can't complete it in time, you will have to start over from the very beginning. These two elements together ruin it for me.

A good adventure game should make you have an ""Ah-HA!"" moment when you get to the next section, not cause you to punch a hole through your monitor out of frustration when you hit the next barrier of progression.

While it is not the Shadowgate you remember 100%, it is nevertheless very similar, with almost all of its iconic puzzles there, even if in a slightly altered form to make you think them out once again.

All the classic tunes are there and can be recognized if you have an acute ear.

Something new to this game, however, is voice acting and cutscenes. While the cutscenes are a novelty and the voice acting is not anything to write home about, they do the job of framing the plot of the game well, explaining why you have come to Shadowgate and why the Warlock Lord needs to be stopped.

Overall, a proved labor of love from the guys at Zojoi. If you are a nostalgic fan of Shadowgate, you should give this remake a try.

Of special note is that the end of the game contains a sequel hook.

Do you remember having a favorite video game that it seemed not many other people fully appreciated? One that you were completely obsessed with, spent tons of time with played over and over again, gathered every bit of information on it that you could? For some people, the games that they find themselves so devoted to end up becoming big series, with numerous sequels. For others, those games get periodic sequels and live on. And for yet others those games just sort of fade away, becoming forgotten in time.

For a while, it seemed that Shadowgate would be one of those games in that last group. Certainly, it was much-loved by a number of people who experienced the original adventure on NES, Macintosh, and PC. And, the series did get some sequels - a side-scrolling adventure game for the TurboDuo, and a 3D exploration game for N64, as well as a port of the original game to the Gameboy Color. But, the series never seemed to receive quite the appreciation that it deserved, and, after those N64 and GBC versions in 1999, the series seemed to slip away. While the series, or mentions of the series, would pop up occasionally, it was never anything significant. And, after a while, it seemed all hope was gone, and the legend of Shadowgate would be lost to the passage of time.

Sometimes, however, all it takes is a few dedicated people to make something happen. And fortunately for the Shadowgate series, it had two extremely dedicated people - Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs - who had been with the series since the beginning, who still maintained that love for the series after all those years, who wanted to see the series live and thrive again. They surrounded themselves with a great group of talented people at Zojoi, acquired the rights to the Shadowgate franchise, and set out to find if there was still a desire to see Shadowgate live again. And, through the relatively new (especially at the time in 2012) format of Kickstarter, soon found out that there were nearly 3500 people were still passionate about Shadowgate, and wanted to see it brought back to life. And, after over a year and a half of work, that dream finally become a reality, with the new Shadowgate game!

The first thing that should be clarified/emphasized with regards to the new Shadowgate game is that it is not simply a port/remake of the original Shadowgate. While it is based off of the original Shadowgate, and shares similarities with it, there is a significant amount of new content - rooms, items, descriptions, everything that goes into making the game. So, anyone who has played the original who is expecting to simply blow through this game in short order is in for a big surprise.

That said, the new Shadowgate shares much in common with the original, where it is a near certainty that anyone who enjoyed the original will enjoy the new Shadowgate as well. All of the core aspects of a good Adventure game are here. In your journey through the castle Shadowgate and surrounding areas, you will be exploring through a wide variety of locations, gathering hints, clues and information, discovering items and putting them to use, solving puzzles, uncovering mysteries, all while working toward your end goal. The challenge and adventure of Shadowgate is alive and well, and fans of the series will be thrilled to see all of this brought into a new game so well.

For people who are new to the series, or to the genre entirely, the new Shadowgate also provides as an excellent entry point. There are three different difficulties - allowing one to experience the adventure while working through different amounts of puzzles, different challenges, and more forgiving circumstances. There is also an optional hint system in place, where one can make use of a companion to receive information about situations and guidance toward solutions. So, one can start on a level where one is comfortable, and work up through the difficulties and help with those difficulties, until one is a master of the castle.

In bringing Shadowgate to a new generation, new expectations, and new groups of fans, Zojoi have brought the game up-to-speed not only with regards to the puzzles and adventure, but in the graphics and music as well. Each area - old and new - is beautifully illustrated, to make each room come alive. In addition, a wonderful soundtrack has been created for this game, each piece of which which perfectly fits and sets the mood for the rooms and the entire game.

For those with a fondness for the original soundtrack and style of the original game, however, there are a set of options - for audio, text, and transitions - which can be toggled on or off individually, to provide for a more ""retro"" style of play. The audio allows one to experience either the new soundtrack, or the NES one. The text option causes text to appear letter by letter, drawn by a quill. And, the transition option causes the more blocky style of moving from room to room, as opposed to more blurred option of the newer version. Each of these, depending on one's preference, can either provide for a more ""retro"" feel on a newer adventure, or allow one to experience an entirely new adventure altogether.

Between the different difficulties, different challenges, new things to explore and discover and overcome on each difficulty, new details to notice, and an intricate story to uncover, as well as the various options for display and experience of the game, there are many reasons to play through Shadowgate multiple times. While it's easy enough to do a quick playthrough of the game on the easiest difficulty with hints, it's a very rewarding experience to play through at the hardest difficulty without any hints. That may be a bit much to tackle the first time through the game, however, even for seasoned Shadowgate veterans, and so going through the game multiple times on different difficulties to uncover increasingly more of the game is highly recommended. Even beyond that, however, the world of Shadowgate is so rich and rewarding that it will continually draw one back into its world, to explore and experience it time and again.

The new Shadowgate game takes as a starting point the original Shadowgate, and builds off of it to bring forth a game which is similar in style, while still modern and up-to-date; a game which has a similar feel, yet doesn't feel archaic; a game which stays true to the roots of the original, while providing a significantly new experience; and which takes a franchise that at one time, and for so long, had seemed lost to the ages and tales of the past, and brings it once more to the forefront of gaming. The new Shadowgate is not meant to merely be a one-off thing either. Having seen the passion and love that still exist for the franchise, Zojoi have plans to bring Shadowgate as a franchise back to life, continuing to combine old and new as old adventures are revived, forgotten tales are brought to the fore, hidden information is revealed, and bright future is once more in sight.

It's not very often that a game like the new Shadowgate comes along. A beautiful blend of old and new, a game which will appeal to fans of the series, fans of the genre, and people new to both of them. A game in a series which for so long had seemed lost and without hope, brought back to life, not in just a simple port or in a cheap use of the name, but in a lovingly-crafted game, both a tribute to what has come before, and a promise of what is to come. Dave Marsh, Karl Roelofs, and everyone at Zojoi, have created a masterpiece with Shadowgate. The series is once more in good hands, and the future is brighter than it has ever been.

The essence of what makes shadowgate what it once was is still there, but puzzles, map even the story have been rewritten and expanded to make this revival a grander new experience to recapture the attention of old fans and delight the new.

Old fans, as you can see from the screen shots, many iconic rooms from the original are back touched up and modernised in a striking art style. Don't expect them to serve the same purpose they once did though or you will probably get stuck. While the new puzzles are quite challenging the game now has many new modes to curb the difficulty for new players and still provide the hardcore experience for old fans. Achievements unique to different modes and the new unlockable hidden deaths mode which will have you searching for old a new creative ways to kill your character (a homage to old adventure games like kings quest and the original shadowgate) provide an modicum of replayability this genre usually lacks.
Race against the clock as each mode gives you only a limited amount of time and resources to reach the end before the world ends or your life is snuffed out, also note the attention given to the new narrative.

The music, the atmosphere, everything on that game smelled like adventure.

This game is a reimagining of the original NES version. I say reimagine insteado of remake because it's obvious to me that while they have strong roots on the NES version, this version isn't held by those roots.

Many rooms are similar but almost all puzzles are completely different and even the ones that look like a puzzle found on the NES version will have twists to them.

The visuals are gourgeous. They use a handpainted style with very few animations and the whole experience is like playing a painting. They also vastly improved the delivery of puzzles in the sense that this game isn't a pixel hunt at all. Everything you can interact with will glow when you just click it to indicate that. That doesn't mean you SHOULD interact to everything but there is never a moment where you have to interact with some hidden object that you'll only discover by clicking everything on the screen.

Some flaws that I did find are for example the interface. Many times you have to use an item you have on the inventory and use it on the scene. The inventory screen takes the whole screen so you have to open the inventory screen, go to the page the item is at, click the item, click ""use"", close the inventory screen and click where you want to use the item. This becomes a little tedious when you're trying some combinations to solve a puzzle. The NES version kept the inventory open at all times at your side so you could quickly try many items. They could fix this by having a closeable inventory panel that doesn't obstruct the screen so you could keep it open while you try using items.

I'm having a blast. The game have three dificulty settings that actually change the puzzles. I went and selected the Master dificulty directly because that's how the NES version where - ruthless. I recomend you do the same.",1411077387,1411077387,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Some time back in elementary school, my dad brought home a DVD version of the lighthearted quick time event and snuff film that is Dragon’s Lair II. Thanks in part to my relative inexperience with games at that point, but mostly thanks to the fact that a remote control is a lousy way to play a game, I only ever made it to the second world before getting frustrated from dying over and over again. However, despite my decision to not actually play any more of the game, the fact that each failure cued an elaborate animation of Dirk the Daring’s dorky demise was fascinating enough that I watched the whole death reel. Unlike in other games I had played by that point, death in Dragon’s Lair II wasn’t just a penalty for your mistakes; it was a morbid merit badge.

It was at some other point in elementary school that I was again introduced to a game that had a multitude of ways to die, albeit not so comical: Shadowgate 64. I had rented the game from a Power Video because it was featured in Nintendo Power, and that’s just how I did things. Plus, the cover art of a staff with an eyeball on it looked cool. I didn’t know what to expect going in, and I couldn’t have told you that it was an adventure game once I did play it, even though I had played point-and-clicks such as Pajama Sam by that point. All I knew was that I hadn’t played anything exactly like it before, and that there were an awful lot of ways to die for a game without combat.

I never made it far in the game because I didn’t have a controller pack to save with, and I would always reach a starry-ceilinged room in some tower, get stuck, and inevitably kill myself with an item called Forest Nectar no matter how I tried to use it. I didn’t fare well on the save files of other people who had rented the game and managed to accomplish more, either. But my inability to progress in this game that was all puzzles and no combat and plentiful deaths didn’t keep it from occupying a part of my brain reserved for only the warmest and fuzziest of nostalgia.

And only recently we got a remake of the original Shadowgate, and I finally had a convenient method of seeing what made it so special to its fans as opposed to the sequel for the Nintendo 64, which I later heard wasn’t received all that well. Now, having played through the remake’s three difficulty levels, I realize that what I like best about this Shadowgate is what impressed me so much in Shadowgate 64 and Dragon’s Lair II and the Souls games: the sense of fragility and disempowerment that makes every moment and every decision matter. And, for me, the variety of deaths is what drives that helplessness home.

In the Shadowgate remake, you play as Jair, some hapless knight whose physical prowess makes even Dirk the Daring look good. As such, the only way young Jair can hope to overcome the trials he has been tasked with facing at the legendary living Castle of Shadowgate is by using his wits and whatever he can find that isn’t magically attached to the floor. Whereas death in Dragon’s Lair II results from the failure to respond quickly and accurately to a prompt, death in Shadowgate usually results from the failure to scour the environment for clues about potential dangers, or perhaps just because you decide to 
Use a lit torch on Thyself a few times in a row.

You explore Shadowgate using a series of commands that you would find in text-based adventure games, only they’re mapped to buttons at the top of the screen. Your most-used commands will be Look, Use and Go, and puzzles will often require you to use the Look command on everything you can click to fill the dialog box at the bottom of the screen with narrative text that just might include cryptic hints in the form of riddles or keywords. Except for Look, commands will add to your turn counter, and in most situations, the deaths you have to worry about are directly related to your turn counter. The most common scenarios involve making the right decision within a turn or two of encountering a monster. If you fail to use the proper action or proper item, or perhaps even just do things out of sequence, you’ll experience just how easy it is for everything to kill Jair.

It is the less immediate deaths in Shadowgate, however, that have the potential to be both the most frustrating aspects of the game and the most important to its replayability. Each of the torches you use to navigate the castle has a limited number of turns before it burns out, leaving Jair to promptly connect his skull with the hardest object in the room should he not have any further torches. There is also an overall turn limit for beating the game, which I never ran up against. The timed death that is the source of the frustration I mentioned is a curse young Jair has inflicted on him by a banshee early on in the game. If you don’t find a cure roughly 600 turns after being cursed, you die. 

When you’re still getting used to the game, it’s easy to run up your turn counter and prevent yourself from being able to find a cure in time. So, it’s a good idea to create multiple saves and be prepared to load from an earlier point once you know how to more efficiently solve certain puzzles. Assuming you don’t start the game on Master difficulty, whose puzzles’ solutions have the most steps involved, the banshee’s curse becomes a constant and compelling reminder to carefully consider your every move through the castle as opposed to the vague promise of death that gets pushed to the back of your mind when trying to solve the game’s major puzzles for the first time.     

Other than the banshee’s curse, the game’s logic behind why certain items are useful in certain situations and not others can occasionally be frustrating. But, for the most part, as long as you’re as thorough and attentive as possible, there’s no solution in the game that just comes completely out of the blue or requires an extensive amount of trial and error. And, even if you don’t pick up on the most helpful clues for certain puzzles, there are often other hints to help you.

Shadowgate isn’t for everybody. Plenty of people will find its hints too vague and its interface too involved. But it also isn’t a game that can only be appreciated by fans of the original or of the adventure game genre, or even by a guy who has an odd amount of nostalgia for the franchise, given that he had barely even played part of a possibly ill-regarded sequel. Shadowgate puts you in control of an unlikely hero and leaves success to your own powers of observation and abstract thinking, not to any amazing abilities possessed by the character. And, for those who appreciate the sense of peril and empowerment that comes from having that much agency over the fate of a particularly vulnerable protagonist, Shadowgate is an experience that is far more fascinating than frustrating.

Gut 27 Jahre nachdem man zum ersten mal Castle Shadowgate betreten konnte,ist es nun wieder soweit.
Das Remake ist da und die verliese des Schlosses laden zum erneuten Rätseln und sterben ein.

Im Kern ist es,wie ich zumindest mir ein Remake vorstelle.
Es fängt den Flair des Originals ein,versucht es aber nicht zu kopieren,sondern macht aus dem vorhandenen etwas neues.
So auch hier.

Die ein oder anderen Passagen werden Spielern des Originals von 1987 bekannt vorkommen,doch der Schein trügt,die Rätsel sind bis auf vllt 5% komplett neu.
Das ist es was Shadowgate richtig macht,es wirkt nach aussen wie ein schlichtes Remake,blickt man jedoch hinter diese Fassade erkennt man schnell dass es alles andere als nur das ist.

Auswählbar sind 3 Schwierigkeitsgrade,die den Härtegrad der Rätsel abändern und einige Sterbepassagen abschwächen.
Jedoch sei hier gesagt dass selbst der ,,Einfache'' Grad noch sehr fordernd ist.

Zudem kann man in einem Retro Modus spielen,welcher jedoch nur den Orginal Soundtrack einspielt und die Texte wie beim Nes ablaufen lässt.
Also Grafisch verändert sich dabei nichts.

Das Ui:
Für mich Persönlich lässt sich mit dem Ui angenehm spielen,es ist übersichtlich,vllt etwas umständlich aber im Endeffekt doch gut zu Handhaben.

Wie im Original findet man auch hier Fackeln welche die Leben des Spielers darstellen,und nach abbrennen das Virtuelle Licht ausknipsen wenn man nicht eine neue Entzündet.

Die Rätsel werden nochmal schwerer gemacht durch die Unmengen an Gegenständen die man im Spielverlauf findet,einige davon sind unnütz,was natürlich das ganze nochmal erschwert wenn man jemand ist der alles aufhebt was er findet.

Die Zwischensequenzen werden wie auch das Spiel selbst in wirklich gelungenen Artworks dargestellt,in Kombination mit dem Soundtrack absolut stimmig.

Eine Deutsche Lokalisation ist laut Entwickler im Moment ebenfalls in Arbeit.

Gelungenes Remake,dass mehr als nur den Charme des Originals einfängt,aber auch ohne den Namen Shadowgate könnte es gut alleine dastehen,Top Point and Click Adventure mit einer guten Prise Schwarzen Humors.",1409215319,1409264688,True,25,1,0.757729172706604004,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The game deftly avoids making you actually pixel-hunt, most interactable items fairly easy to spot.

The game is an adventure of the old-school, with red herrings everywhere and huge amount of items you can grab that you will never actually use. Nearly every puzzle has good, if sometimes somewhat obtuse hints, with very little ass-pull adventure logic. The difficulty levels are also very serious, massively simplifying things on the easiest level as compared to the hardest. You /can/, on all difficulties, screw yourself into an unwinnable position - the game will allow you to destroy necessary items (though not casually) and it's extremely possible to just run out of time (though not very likely).

The biggest flaw in the gameplay is some UI related clumsiness, as using items on the environment can get very clunky very quickly when you're experimenting on a puzzle. Items can be bound to number keys for things you use a lot, but I don't think that ended up particularly useful near the end.

Story: Shadowgate has never, on its own, had a particularly deep mythology. The Shadowgate remake drops a lot more lore on you, completely resetting the world and freely changing some very major details. It does some interesting things once you get to the end.

I did personally find it to largely suffer from being written by 50-year old men whose greatest influences are clearly in the Lord of the Rings vein, naming conventions clearly suffering from a lack of... I want to say modern creativity. It's all a bit out of date.

Art: Here's where Shadowgate really shines - which is important, since the game is little more than a series of paintings you flail at with a mouse. Shadowgate is not a colorful place, with most scenes generally only having two or three different colors at any time, and Chris Cold does an excellent job making a dreary Shadowgate that seriously looks like it wants to kill you.

Jair in particular is excellently rendered - the classic portrayal of the game's protagonist was a standard square-jawed manly hero in full armor and a beautiful head of hair. New Shadowgate portrays Jair as a man dragged out of his life and sent on a journey without ever really being allowed to understand why - his hair is long and filthy, his cloak is tattered, and his shadowed face imparts the idea that Shadowgate is destroying him even as he triumphs over it.

Perhaps most importantly, the art is /clear./ Despite everything being dirty, dull, and cracked, mostly in greys and browns, nothing looks maddeningly ambiguous. An item on the ground is clearly an item on the ground, a doorway is clearly a doorway, and if you at any point get fooled it's because the game is actively trying to fool you.

Music: I have a clear bias here - New Shadowgate's score is an orchestral treatment of the original music, the old songs appearing as almost etherial strains inside some deeply atmospheric stuff. Compared to the original, this score is much darker, much more ominous, and much more effective (which shouldn't be too difficult, considering the original was on an 8-bit system). There is an appreciated option to set the music to the classic beeply bops.

Shadowgate: Yeah, it's Shadowgate. You can die on almost every screen, you watch your torches steadily dwindle down, and the Warlock Lord pops in from time to time just to talk shit. Most sadistically, the game is explicitly /not/ the previous Shadowgate. Very few puzzles are solved the same way, and the game will often directly punish you for having the unmitigated gall to underestimate it in this fashion. Much like the original, the game (on Master difficulty) is not here to be your friend. It is here to laugh at you as you stare blankly at its legitimately hard puzzles and then brutally kill you for blinking.

--

All told, I give the game high marks. The UI's clunkiness just takes a little getting used to, and if you enjoy adventure games that kind of slap you around, you can't get much more slappy than this. If you're a fan of the original and you haven't picked this up yet, you should absolutely do so.",1409130636,1409130636,True,12,0,0.591976702213287354,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I've played plenty of point-and-click adventure games in the past and, with few exceptions, you're never really in any danger at all.

The basic setup is that you are a guy named Jair and you are the Seed of Prophecy, you're contacted by a mage named Lakmir who tells you to go to a castle called Shadowgate armed with only a torch, a dirk, and courage and defeat the evil Warlock Lord. It's not the most original premise in the world but it's a remake of a game that came out in the 80s, so I'll forgive the lack of originality. 
As Lord Jair, your job is to navigate through the castle, room by room, grabbing items and stuffing them into your satchel  You explore the castle by using various menu commands: look, hit, use, eat, etc. At first I found it a bit clunky, having to ""use"" myself (or ""hit"") when pulling a lever when other games would just let me use the lever by clicking on it, but I think the clunky interface is part of the charm. While you're exploring, you need to keep an eye on your torch and keep picking up new ones that you come across. If your torch burns out, well, let's just say the game warns you that bad things happen....

Besides exploring, the other thing you'll do in Shadowgate is die a lot. Taking the wrong item, using the wrong item, not wearing certain equipment (via using them on your portrait), and a myriad other things can prove fatal. There's even an achievement for uncovering all the hidden ways that you can die in the game. The funny thing is that as frustrating as dying is, in Shadowgate it's actually fun provided you save often. I found the autosave feature saved pretty frequently but I always saved as soon as I entered a room, just in case. 

Graphically, Shadowgate mostly has static pictures and some animations, but I can honestly say that I don't think I've ever played a prettier adventure game. The artwork could have come straight out of a D&D manual. Shadowgate definitely has the look and feel of an RPG but it's an adventure game, through and through. The music is also great. The main theme is my favourite but the tense track that plays when your torch is running low had me frantically scrambling to light a new one every time, even though I knew I had plenty of them. 

One aspect of adventure games that I often have trouble with is the puzzles, particularly puzzles that require something I call Adventure Game Logic, that is, puzzle solutions that involve combining items in a way that makes absolutely no sense. Shadowgate takes a subtle approach to puzzles, dropping hints here and there and letting the player figure things out on their own. If you get stuck, you can always ask Yorick the skull for help. Since this was my first time playing Shadowgate, I decided to play on Apprentice (the lowest difficulty setting) and oftentimes Yorick would pretty much tell me the answer to a puzzle. However, sometimes he seemed to be jumping the gun a bit, like when he told me I needed to cross a certain bridge when I actually had to do a few more things to get the means to get across. Other times I was simply stuck with a bunch of items and no idea where to go next. This is one of those games that requires a ton of trial and error (or a walkthrough at the ready) which is compounded by the fact that the inventory is very disorganized. I lost track of how many times I remembered a passage in a book that was hinting about the puzzle I was working on and then not being able to find it in the archives. At times it seemed as if some information that would have been useful in other difficulties (the game closes off certain areas and puzzles are much easier on Apprentice, giving you some incentive to play again on harder difficulty levels) was just a bit confusing.  

If you like point and click adventure games and you're willing to put up with a lot of trial and error (and dying a lot). I wouldn't recommend Shadowgate as someone's first experience with the genre but it is an interesting look at a piece of adventure gaming history. I will definitely be going back and playing it again on a harder difficulty level and I can't wait to see if they come out with more games in this series.",1409094282,1409094658,True,2,0,0.525321424007415771,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+   3 difficulty settings that change up puzzles, adding some replay value
+   Nostalgia trip back to the castle that I got so many nightmares from when I was young
+   Lots of 'Hidden Death' cut scenes that are really fun to discover and watch


+ / -   The puzzle structure is firmly rooted in old school style gaming-- (for good or bad) so that means some puzzles can be confusing sometimes. I found puzzles could get very confusing on hard! (First timers- I HIGHLY recommend NOT starting on hard mode. Even veterans of the original-- the puzzles are very different in this remake from the original)

-   So many items! Not everything has a use either. First time though on harder difficulties you will have a massive amount of things to pick up and keep track of. I've seen people on stream get stuck on Hard mode and then try using everything, on everything trying to brute force their way through. 



Final verdict : 7.5 / 10
===============
Really fun and old school goodness that is relatively short, but sweet. First time through will take you probably 8-14hrs and likely a restart or two, and once you know where everything is you can rip through it in about an hour or less if you don't read anything and skip all the cut scenes.  (But why do that? The cut scenes and colorful descriptions are awesome!) I recommend you start on easy mode and work your way up to hard to get more replay value from the added layers for the puzzles.

When the kickstarter for this one went up, I immediately dropped a large sum of money into seeing a remake in my list of steam games. Was it worth it?

Absolutely!

This edition of Shadowgate improves in just about every way from the original. The artwork is amazing, the new music hits the same emotions as the original, and the puzzles as as difficult as ever.

Even better is if you don't care for the new music, you can turn on the original NES soundtrack, as well as the original NES screen transition effect and sound. Great for a retro feel.

I only find myself with two dislikes and they are indeed minor. First, the game lessens the difficulty by providing Yorrik, a skull who will give you advice if you want. He also likes to talk way more than he should and since you must click through his dialog it slows the game down and throws off the rhythm you build as you progress, especially on replays. Secondly, when you try to use an action, it isn't clear if you have already selected something at times, and again will throw you off. Having a dagger selected and wanting to look at a wall will confuse you when a detail of a dagger is talked about.

Neither of these at all ruin the game, but are things to watch for as you progress through this wonderful title.",1408994402,1408994402,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Anyways, I have put a few hours into the new version... and I am still struggling as I did many years ago when I was kid. It's like a whole new experience again including the added difficulty levels!

I recommend Shadowgate to those who have played the original and for those who like to challenge the mind. The art is beautiful, the music is great, and the vamped and new puzzles offer a great experience even for those who have beaten the original game.

I'm also not a veteran of point-and-click adventure games. I gave this game a shot because I enjoyed Shadowgate 64 and I'm a sucker for the great artwork of Shadowgate.

What makes Shadowgate feel unique from the few adventure games I've played is the persistent threat of time. You become cursed very early in the game. If uncured, this blight will kill you after a certain number of actions. At first I felt that this discouraged exploration. Indeed it does, but it fits perfectly with the tone of this game, which is one of urgency. From a gameplay perspective, this is somewhat similar to the constant deaths faced in rogue-likes. With each death, the player gains more knowledge to progress through the game with greater efficiency, so the curse no longer becomes a threat after a few playthroughs. But even when the curse is cured, there is always the threat of darkness in the form of your torch. Each turn dims the torch until it is eventually snuffed, resulting in a quick death. I found that on the medium difficulty, there were plenty of torches, but there aren't an infinite supply. Thus, even when one becomes adept at the game, there is still the lingering pressure to move ever onward.

The puzzles in this game cover a range of difficulty from ""modern"" easy to logic-defyingly challenging. In some regard, the harder puzzles may feel like trial and error, especially if the hint is located in a scroll that you missed but cannot waste the turns to find. Perhaps in these situations, it is best to restart. There are a few situations in which it would be nearly impossible to know what item to use on what object to move forward, but a quick glance at a walkthrough can help.

The three difficulty settings and many achievements add a great degree of replayability to this game. The biggest difference between the difficulty settings is in the difficulty and the number of puzzles. I played on the medium difficulty at first, but I look forward to trying the game on the hardest difficulty to experience all of the puzzles the game has to offer. The achievements also encourage the player to try different play styles, such as being extremely efficient or avoiding killing any goblins. Of course, it helps that the sound, music, and graphics are all good enough to keep the player interested through multiple playthroughs.

After completing the game, I went back and read reviews of the original Shadowgate ports, especially the NES version. Most of the reviews were lukewarm at best and I'm not sure why. Shadowgate has few glaring weaknesses compared to other adventure games (it seems all adventure games have a few puzzles that require strange logic). I'm also seeing mostly lukewarm professional reviews of this remake.

A childhood, consumed by puzzle solving, thought provoking death. 

Shadowgate is- and is always will be a wonderful game. The original has always been challenging for me, it took me nearly 7 YEARS to beat the original.  I had given up many times, but in the end, I persisted, and succeeded. When I first started, I was young, the complex approaches, or even the most simplest thoughts, hadn't occurred. Getting stuck is the part of the game that will destroy you.

Even today the game on Master mode is a challenge, it stresses to the finest detail, that every aspect is important. For a veteran, every solution is the same, perhaps some have been changed. But the problem is different. The answer is the same, but you still need to solve the problem, understand the question.

You may need to backtrack, and  play much more cautiously. You may find torches to be limited on supply. The game will continue to challenge you, and make you question things, and answers. They're there, sometimes puzzles have more than one sollution. Which often ends to be a pleasant surprise, and quite gratifying, when you learn of it.

I've only managed to get past  the room of mirrors, and into the courtyard on Master Mode.

But the game is .. a good challenge, for a mind, a veteran. The game remains refreshing, and enjoyable just like the original, for the newcomer, it offers multiple difficulties, to help you warm up to the game. The game is unforgiving at times, my only reccomendation is, look at the game's controls. Master hotkeying, and using the controls.

l to look
i for inventory
o for open
u to use
h to hit
g to go
c to close

And so on, this will save a lot of mouse movement, and pains in such developments. F5 is quicksave, etc. You'll find the experience more modern, while maintaining to it's roots.

Given these origins, your motivations for venturing into Castle Shadowgate are about what you would expect: you are a hero who must defeat an evil warlock. The graphics, music and the majority of puzzles have been reworked; new, voice-acted cutscenes and story elements have been peppered throughout; while the mysterious atmosphere and memorable locations of the original remain intact, along with the option to use the retro soundtrack. 

While most of the information needed to reach puzzle solutions does lie somewhere within the game, it is not explicit in its detail: clues are often cryptic, making experimentation necessary—experimentation that results in death just as often as a satisfying solution. Shadowgate is a game in which the reaper is literally waiting around every corner for you to make your next mistake. The only difference is that, this time, it’s almost as if you’re collecting the various deaths since you’re rewarded with achievements for experiencing them and special cutscenes for discovering the hidden ones. 

On Master difficulty, the puzzles are as challenging as the name implies but often in a manner just as obtuse as in the original Shadowgate; fortunately, the developers included two lesser difficulties that make the game more approachable and groom you for your playthrough of Master—if you’re still interested by then. An optional tutorial and a talking skull companion that gives hints upon request, the equivalent of the “hint” command from the original, also help to alleviate the difficulty.

Dependent upon how you like your point-and-clicks, Shadowgate is potentially flawed: Turns are limited because the torches that keep you alive are limited in both number and duration, complicated by the fact that you’re unavoidably afflicted with a curse very early on, which will kill you if not cured in time. This is fairly forgiving on lower difficulty settings but, on Master, it’s very easy to waste enough time searching for the cure that you damn yourself in the process and must either go back to an earlier save or restart the entire game. The facts that many items aren’t necessary to progress and anything that isn’t a simple inspection of your surroundings will consume a turn, combined with the experimentation-based puzzle solving, where items must frequently be combined with each other or the environment, could make this adventure an exercise in frustration for some.

If you enjoyed the original Shadowgate, this is a no-brainer. If you hated the original Shadowgate, this isn’t likely to change your mind, though the lesser difficulties will undoubtedly be less offensive.

Once in a while you see a game advertised as ""old school adventure puzzle,"" and what do you find? The game is too easy. The puzzles are straightforward, too easily solved, and there's never enough death to punish the player. Sometimes the game won't even kill the player at all. So when a remake of the original Shadowgate was announced, my one fear was that it was now going to be too easy. Little did I know the game would be every bit as difficult as the original.

It's as difficult as the original, but not quite as brutal. The original Shadowgate sometimes had passages you could move into that existed only to kill you the moment you went into them. Or it had traps that came out of nowhere with no hint you were walking into a trap. In this manner, Shadowgate has done away with the cheap kills, doing away with the need to constantly save in every room.

Some gamers may not be able to embrace this style of gaming anymore. Its point and click and the gameplay revolves entirely on selecting verbs to interact with the objects, like ""use sword on goblin."" But for me, this is pure good nostalgia. Shadowgate is a game I grew up with and this is a great return to form. It's close enough to the original to push all the nostalgia buttons, but it has its own new cool style as well. The puzzles are familiar, but never quite the same as the original game. In my own subjective opinion I couldn't have asked for a better remake.

The UI is very clunky, and even with hotkeys, is a burden to use. The inventory when pulled up covers the entire screen, so the selection process is (pull up inventory, select ""USE"", select item in inventory, close inventory, click what to use item on) and it slows down the pace and makes trying different solutions VERY frustrating. Also, to interact with an object, you have to ""USE"" yourself on it, so again, (USE, click your portrait, click item to interact with) it's incredibly clunky and makes the mediocre puzzles even worse to deal with. At the very least, the hotkeys can be rebound.

The auto-save in the NES version is better than this one. You should manually ""quick-save"" by hitting F5 in every room, and then when you do have to restart you have to go through a load menu and select your file, it's just bad.

Oh P.S. I hope you enjoy a long-term game over timer w/o good indicators on top of the perfectly fine torch system. You get a mandatory curse fairly early on, and eventually, you will just lose. For me this was 2 hours into the game. 2 hours after getting the curse, I had to restart the game. That's poor game design and a relic of an era that they even got rid of after Uninvited because they realized it was shit back in 1987.

The charm of the original game is completely gone, no longer will you die 30 times in the first 5 rooms in amusing ways. They actively make it difficult to die, which is just so so so wrong.

You start off with just a nudge out the door, a torch and a dirk and are charged with the quest of vanquishing evil in the living castle of Shadowgate.

The game is loaded with puzzles, traps, and head-scratching moments depending on your chosen difficulty.  Having said that, I distinctly remember the NES version being far easier.  Perhaps the hardest difficulty wasn't the best idea...

The menu options are pretty much the same as they were, but the full-screen approach to the UI is a nice change away from the classic version.  You get to see far more of the environment and the amount of detail that went into the hand-painted imagery.

As I delve further and further into the game, I find some of the puzzles famliar but often with new twists (also thanks to the difficulty).  It's tough, at times, and potentiallly frustrating as all good puzzle games should be.

The music is atmospheric and adaptive, laced with familiar nostalgic themes from the classic. The artwork is nice and crisp and the added storyline so far makes it far more immersive than its original form.

For exta nostalgia, they have options to utilize some of the classic NES features such as the music and room transitions.

I would recommend it to fans of the original and fans of point-and-click adventures (like Myst and its ilk).

Fans of the original Shadowgate will love the remake of this game and the feeling of retro nostalgia.

The game starts with an animated opening accompanied by a  great soundtrack and voice narration that will give you the immersion and overhwelming feeling of  epicness to your adventure to conquer the castle and stop an evil warlock. 

Though not everything is voiced in the game except for major plotline cutscenes for the story. The game still does a great job with the  text dialogue. The graphics will remind you of a really well done animated  graphic novel if you've ever experienced any of those. The gameplay itself a click adventure puzzle game and might not be everyone's cup of tea.

Upon playing the game and starting off your adventure you'll be greeted with 3 different difficulty mode to the game, each of which changes up the solution to the puzzles to the game and stop players from thinking they know the puzzles after playing the first time. Along with starting the adventure you'll be given a well detailed tutorial that explains how the mechanics, and how the game works. This isn't your usual point and click adventure but a retro gameplay style with the player having to use hotkeys and clicking on top for buttons to execute commands such as use, speak, or even to open doors and move forward etc. So an example is  in order to get in through a door to the next area  to progress you'll have to first open the door or you'll run headlfirst into it.

The game will feature puzzles that are pretty complex and feels VERY satisfying when you actually solve it. The game does give you hints hidden in well written riddles and text on spells, items, and scroll you find in order to progress.  Upon being stuck however, players  do have the ability to talk to your only sidekick skull partner Yorick who at times talk alot but does give you hints also in riddles  but unless you paid attention to certain surrondings and the riddles, you'll be stuck at certain areas for quite a bit. 
The way to solve certain situations sometimes is trial and error sometimes and  be warned however that making a mistake at certain locations and it's death for you in many ways. There are creatures in this castle to stop you along the way such as krakens and dragons.  Luckily the game does offer saving and  quicksave to keep on playing. To add on to this the game has a mechanic that everything you do is considered a move except for looking. So each time you are using a move your torch is slowly diminishing. If you run out of torches you'll have no choice but to restart a previous save becuase leaving  will make you fall in the dark and break your neck. Along with the torch there will be another element later in the game that will be more brutal on you forcing you to quicken your pace a bit.

The one thing about the game is when you do die you'll die in a gruesome way. Along with death flying along and giving you a speech about your misery sometimes in a humorous manner. So try not to die and do your best at the puzzles, Read, look, and tread carefully in this castle of doom.

To top that off, there are three difficulties that change how quickly the torches run out, the frequency/difficulty of puzzles, and etc.  There's also a retro mode, allowing you to listen to the old music and experience the transitions we've come to know and love.  A hint system exists to help you somewhat, though it won't give you the answer flat out like BTTF: The Game did.

For the fence sitters of this reimagining of Shadowgate:  To shrug this offering of the Shadowgate franchise as simply a remake does the efforts of the development team no justice.

For those who have played any of the previous versions of the game across its many iterations, you will indeed feel as though you have returned to the same castle, and the same aura of the game remains surprisingly intact and pervades each and every room.

But be warned, the familiarity is both friend and foe as you begin to traverse the new puzzles and challenges.  Old riddles may not always be what they seem and familiarity can lend itself to misdirection.  It will take a fresh perspective from the player to prepare for the fresh traps, trials, and tribulations of this new castle shaped the guise of the old.

I must admit I had a skeptical approach to the title myself before being part of its testing; but have been pleasantly surprised by the respect to the original and the careful balance of nostalgia vs new content paid by the development team.

If you enjoyed the previous generations of the Living Castle, Shadowgate, then you will most certainly find quite a lot to love about its newest incarnation.  And if you are new to this genre of gameplay or this franchise, then Shadowgate is an apt place to start.

So if you're still interested: grab a torch, a weapon of choice, and pluck up a touch of courage and take on the new challenge of the newest Castle Shadowgate -- the Reaper is waiting to see just where your adventure may chance to end...and he can wait far longer than you can.

Ever since I played this game on a NES system a few decades ago, I recall all the frustration I had when going through some tedious puzzles, yet the joy when solving a problem made it more the worthwhile.

Those who have played the game will likely recall a skull ornament door at the very start of the game. Once inside, the warlock lord makes his first appearance (his eyes anyway) dismissing your quest to stop him and confidently remarks about your imminent death. Alas your journey and the puzzles start immediately. At times you attempt to methodically evaluate and make sense of a problem ahead. In other times, you may resort to trying random actions. Actions which may cause you to progress, cause your death – or even witty remarks to things you wouldn’t do in real life!

Its 2014, a remake of Shadowgate arrives. I really didn’t know what to anticipate until the game started. Unlike the previous game, this remake has three different modes with master being the most difficult. After choosing a difficulty mode, I was met with a familiar setting to the original classic. There was an air of nostalgia in the opening sequence, yet it was original and fresh - the design was fabulous. The background music was nicely adapted from the classic Shadowgate. A nice feature of the game is to switch the soundtracks to the original MIDI composition! A major difference at the start is you are met with a companion named Yorick, who not only guides you through your quest, but throws a few jokes and remarks to put you at ease in some frustrating situations. This was all before I entered the door - from here on I just knew this was going to be a master piece of a game. Boy was I right! The art work for the cut scenes later on were simply fantastic and suited well the nature of this point-and-click adventure game. The puzzles were similar to the classic though with more mind-boggling twist. They were that much better to solve. I couldn’t put the game down and even today, decades later, with the similarities from the previous game, the frustrations still arose. There are also a variety of side ‘missions’ for further achievements. With this in mind, this game is repayable, addicting and fun.

Zojoi takes the great problem solving of the original game to a whole new level.

If you thought you knew how to conquer Shadowgate, think again.

Zojoi have also expanded Castle Shadowgate to introduce new areas of the game that were not accessbile or included in the original. The Steam achievement are also nice touch. Curing the curse in under 200 turns was a challanging achievement.

If you are not a thinker or problem solver then this game may not be for you. If you do get stuck (and you will) take a break to think about the puzzles. If you are still stuck the forum is very active and helpful, often providing you clues to solve the puzzles without actually providing you the spoiler.
