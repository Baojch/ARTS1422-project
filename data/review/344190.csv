It's written in Java.  Don't laugh, it's true.  This is seriously written in Java.  That's what these guys think is the best possible gaming engine for 2022. 

Technically, this is exactly what you would expect from a Java app dumped on Steam.  It doesn't display properly in fullscreen and the hamfisted developers never tested the game on a high end rig, so if you have DPI scaling settings enabled it won't fit your screen right at all.  

The retro graphics are somewhat okay for what's basically a browser game, but that's not the problem.  The game is heavily infested with nasty mobile app tier microtransactions, and on top of that, this massively Pay 2 Win browser game has completely insulting cash grab DLC, over $180 USD worth. 

$180 USD for a Java browser game.  Screw that.

[quote][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews]Developer Response![/url][/quote]

The developer has weighed in to inform everyone they didn't read the [url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews]Developer Usage Rules[/url] for Steam ""partners"", or they deliberately ignored the part where Valve says:

[quote]Though it may be tempting, not every review needs to be responded to.  A developer response will frequently draw more attention than the original statement, potentially turning a small issue into a much larger community discussion. It's also not a good idea to use this feature to refute customer opinions. Your direct attention can be seen as validation or a defensive attempt to silence your customers.[/quote]

The developer admits the game was written originally in 2007 and not kept up to date or fixed when it was launched in 2015.  The developer seems unaware it is now the year 2022.  Why haven't they updated their game properly?  Who knows, but this remains a compromise/defect that gamers shouldn't be putting up with. 

Now the fun part. The developer has deliberately lied about the $180 price tag associated with the microtransactions and DLC for this game.  Here's the SteamDB page linking to the DLC: 

https://steamdb.info/app/344190/dlc/

Oops.  Why did the developer deliberately lie about this?  It's a mystery, but game reviews are about games, not the developers, no matter how dishonest they are.

The developer now switches to attack gamers and reviewers instead of owning up to the defects in their games... that along with their previous dishonesty shows exactly who we're dealing with here.  Pathetic attacks, too.  

I've written a lot of reviews... yes.  That means I know exactly what I'm talking about when it comes to decent games.  The developer thinks they're undermining my review while reminding people how familiar I am with gaming?  That's not a sensible strategy when you shift into attacking the reviewer rather than accepting the truth. 

I didn't play the game for a very long time:  Yeah.  It doesn't take a lot of time to see the developer has $180 USD price tags on the full content for the game (something they bizarrely chose to lie about when the DLC and prices are right there!).   It also doesn't take a long time to identify this retro pixel crapfest was written in Java.   What a complete BS attack at a reviewer to try disqualify a valid and factual review.   

If I played this game for 4 hours, would the game engine suddenly switch to Unreal?  Would it suddenly get 3D graphics and contemporary video game art to validate the $180 USD price tag that the developer lies about?  No, no it wouldn't.   The developers pointless and disingenuous attacks at the reviewer instead of the facts of the review change nothing, apart from to show gamers just how disreputable they are. 

The consumer hostile, dishonest developers embarrassing display does not change any of the facts about this product, but it does provide another very solid reason for gamers to think twice before wasting their time downloading this.

This game does not cost $180 USD or anywhere close to that. It is free, and designed to be beaten without spending a dime. Many players with 1000+ hours on this game have never spent a penny. Most tournament winners have never spent a penny and are the strongest players in this game.

In a cross between RPG and tactical strategy, you command a troop of ""Immortals"", basically hero units of various types, with powers, equipment, and stats of different kinds. The better part of the gameplay is spent in regional maps, ordering these units around (sometimes with allies, or summoned units if your Immortals can create those), fighting enemies as well as looting chests.

Moving around the map feels awkward and clunky ; it's reminiscent of Age of Empires (the first one) in terms of responsiveness and efficiency... which is to say, it sucks a**. The controls are easy enough to grasp, though I often found myself giving out orders by mistake - this is an isometric game, but the game's recognition of where your cursor is actually located is doubtful at best, and my units would regularly move to a square I did not want. This is especially problematic because the command to ""attack"" an enemy unit is the same as the one to ""move"" - so, too many times to count, I [i]thought[/i] I'd asked my ranged unit to attack an enemy, only for them to move up right next to its face like an idiot.
There is a ""CTRL-click"" functionality to prevent misclicks like this, but this is quite awkward to use, because you also need to shift-click to select several units, and the recognition of where your mouse is is [i]just[/i] functional enough to discourage you from needing to CTRL-click most of the time. Either way, one wonders why the developers couldn't have simply programmed a better way of moving about and attacking enemies, rather than requiring a clunky workaround to prevent misclicks.

Speaking of shift-click and unit selection, that's another real chore. If you have a unit selected and you shift-click on other units, it will [i]keep your unit selected and put it in the same group of selected units[/i], which is such an asinine and unusual way of doing strategy unit selection. I've never played a strategy game where there was no way of deselecting a unit apart from selecting another one. It's, again, really awkward and clunky - left-clicking on the ground does absolutely nothing, so you wonder why that couldn't have just been a way of deselecting units (which, I might add, is very common in RTS games). I often forgot I had a unit selected, and shift-clicked a group of other units, realizing too late that I ordered that first unit to move to a very impractical location that I didn't intend to.
Also, because of the 90's-era graphics, units often bunch up together graphically, and it becomes quite difficult to keep track of which unit is at any given spot in clumps of units, let alone select any specific one. The imprecise and often counter-productive shift-click to select multiple units doesn't help, of course. It's often just easier to select a bunch of units and move them all together, even though, from a strategy standpoint, it'd be better to control them individually given their varied skills.

Unit movement fares little better: the game has a sort of ""action points"" system going on, dictating how much you can do in a given turn. Issue is - units stop automatically when their actions run out, [b][i]even if there are absolutely no enemies left on the map.[/i][/b] This leads to ""stuttering"" armies that are as responsive as snails caught in the throes of senile dementia, stopping every few seconds to wait for your next (gonna be a tad sarcastic here) very very surprising and unpredictable order to... move to that same location you clicked on a few seconds ago. You'd think so-called Immortals would have mastered the art of moving from point A to point B without some overseer needing to refresh their memory when they shut down like high-maintenance roombas, but eh, that's 90's gameplay for you.

The rest of the UI is no better - the map view feels claustrophobic and obsolete, with an inability to zoom out or rotate the battlefield. The menus feel dated and ugly. The graphics, as mentioned, are mediocre. They resemble what would happen if someone looked at the first Age of Empire and said: ""hey, I want to create this, but worse"".

There are a few positive points, of course - as I mentioned, some interesting ideas are here. I like the character progression for the Immortals, and all the Immortal units feel varied and interesting. The character design themselves are not ugly, and although overall the graphics aren't great, there is a sort of rustic charm to them (kind of like revisiting the original AoE II in 2021). The inventory system feels nostalgic, in a good way. The sound design is fine; the voice acting is better than expected (though with a couple amateurish voices here and there - the two dudes at the beginning come to mind), and the music is pretty good.

Overall though, not an experience I would recommend. One rage-inducing misclick to go explore the other side of a distant forest instead of shooting at the evil cyclops is one too many.",1618921821,1618921821,False,2,0,0.465778082609176636,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Started it up a week ago after rediscovering it in my Favorites once I installed the Beta Branch of Steam and have actually not looked back.  Finally got to the point of being able to unlock the Berserker, which is a naga axe wielder.  Have only had minor difficulties with the gameplay, but there has been one GLARING setback to the game that I have discovered.

This being that you must have a decent internet connection that doesn't drop at weird times during the day.  If you lose online connection for ANY reason the game refuses to accept any further input from you.  It does not tell you this at all, for it will simply not respond to anything you do.  If you are on a mission map, your units can still be selected, but the only thing that you can do is open the options menu and exit level and then close the game out completely.  There's a 'logout' button but even THAT is unresponsive.

Other than this setback the game works like a charm.  People complain about it being pay to win...but the only thing I've spent on it is the cost to unlock Starter Pack 1 while it was on sale.  Radiance is easy to come by and I have the option to unlock a few more heroes for 750 Radiance each but why bother?  I'm taking names with my Berserker (now 11), Dryad, Treant, and now Mage.  The latter three are at level 1 for now, but they're still pulling their weight.

All of the Steam Achievements award Radiance, too, if that matters any.  I have had zero problems with the two boss battles I have encountered thus far with the above party.

Pay to win?  No.  Have patience and get to know the game before dumping money into it and you're fine.

It combines the best of different game genres in a compact and intuitive free to play tactics role-playing game. Think of Maplestory 2, The Banner Saga, Crusader Kings 2, and HuniePop.

While the community is small, it has the great camaraderie and sportsmanship like Maplestory 2. Gains by one player may be small, but working together will yield big rewards. However, unlike an MMO which require a considerable time commitment, Immortal Empire is a game you can drop in once in a while and still experience the fun of an MMO. There are daily quests which reward radiance should you incentivized to play daily, but this is less important than the tightly knit community of players that play gauntlets on a weekly basis. 

In addition, like The Banner Saga, Immortal Empire's campaign is long and has new game+ which showcased other routes your character may have chosen if other choices were selected. Nevertheless, there will be backstabbing and deceit along the way. Similar to Crusader Kings 2, you will have to conquer different lands and decide whether or not to allied or eradicate the natives of those areas. 

Furthermore, like HuniePop, there are romances available for all genders. Throughout your journey, your character will meet love interests which they can pursue or perhaps tearfully reject. Yes, there are two achievements for these romances. One is to max out a love interest and the other is to get the worse love ratio with one of the NPCs. Both are hilarious and worth to try out.

It's your typical Turn-Based controls, but with the twists of the fantasy RPG inventory and classes.

While many things are locked behind the option of a 1-time payment or many hours of gameplay, it should only matter those who really are keen on that part as you can still access half of the characters for free.

The game does lack in terms of informations about the systems of the game such as leveling is based on your ""profile"" and not the characters so, initially, you level your main character and as you unlock more character slot in your party, you notice you can only level 1 character for each of level... so you gotta redo the same quests again and again to level multiple characters which can easily become a pain in the butt for many. (You can reach the max level of 250 and each character has up to 80 skills points, meaning you can max 3 character at most or sacrifice some characters' skills' level.)

While I recommend this game, a warning about the multiplayer side of the game. To be honest, currently, the game barely have enough players as it is... Especially new players. You might find 1-4 new players and that's it. The remaining are high level players. Will they help/play with you? Maybe... but that remove lot of the fun factor.

Still, it's a fun game so Yup, recommended.

The combat is a turn-based tactics-style strategy with some rpg elements thrown in. While there is a 'cash shop' (by what I remember) as you progress you can get more 'radiance' (the secondary currency for buying more characters) by simply completing levels and by daily quests. With enough time you can get pretty far.

The web-based version didn't have voice acting, and while the steam version does, I think it was still well done though not the greatest in the world. The story was great back then and I hope it added more over the years (I'll update this post once I get a few hours in :P) 

The animation is something I really liked about this game, at least during the combat. They are clear and readable skills and spells, even the passive buffs are easily read with distinct colors. Each summon has their own sets of skills, and while two or more can heal there is specialists-- the priest being the main healer, the tree-ent the best tank as far as I remember it, and the druid doing the best sustained field-control with her summons and rocks that stun things for at least a turn.

My favorite game of all time is Final Fantasy Tactics... yes, that is the best way to start this review. Other fans of the game will understand. I frequently find myself going on searches for tactic games that come close to or can hold a candle to Final Fantasy Tactics. This game, is not that game.

However, to be fair, we need to take a look at what this game actually is. It is a turn based strategy tactics game with a storyline and (optional) multiplayer. It is a different system, unique in it's own ways that stands out. Do I enjoy it? I would answer that with, ""mostly."" While it does remain a free to play game that you can spend money on, there are actually complete item sets that you can only get for multiplayer, and I came to this game solely for the single player aspect of it.

The animations are atrocious, though a fair amount of the voice acting is decent. My experience bar is full, but I cannot level. It took twenty minutes to find a Valkyrie name that isn't taken (had to settle for Solveig). Having open games means that anyone can join and slow or outright halt your progress on a map. Leaving a map is unintuitive, and never explained. The core mechanic of moving can royally (or mayhap divinely) screw you over, as a single, erratic hex shift from moving your mouse a millimeter in the breadth of a breath can have you move somewhere and immediately be surrounded. Many abilities are useless, if not a detriment, such as the Valkyrie's Fan Attack. You spend time and mana to modify your attack range, but are still required to attack in melee range. Utterly pointless. Enemies will teleport around in FOW, giving a very nonimmersive feel to gameplay, as wooden and painted-on as it is already.

Even as a tactics game, there are no real tactics. Part of the extended tutorial teaches you to kite. You are expected to do this a lot, early-game. Every fight is a flurry of death-by-one-thousand-stings, as a single spell or ability can take more than half of your mana. You can add more Immortals, assuming you can actually name them something that doesn't make your eyes bleed, but it doesn't add complexity to the game. Every turn is an inconsistent duration, with no clear indication of time or even whose it is. To be clear, this isn't an early access review; the game had an official release.

If they were to improve upon these things, I still feel like there's no hook. No incentive to play. The story is beyond generic, as far as I've been, and the loot and daily quests feel like a dime-a-thousand mobile game. Certain Immortals are behind a daily grind/pay wall for no apparent reason, one of them being the only reason I was really interested in the first place.

I'm a big fan, of RPGs and I don't mind slow-paced games, so with the inevitable countless downvotes of *a* negative review, I'd like some feedback at the very least. I'd also like to point out that I don't necessarily hate the game, especially since it seems like it's a fully functional game but is still being tweaked and updated.

First off, the combat/gameplay, the most important part. It's a basic RPG with action points required for movement, basic attacks, and skills/spells. Simple, so there's not a lot to explain but of course it's a bit too simple as from what I saw and experienced out of the basic free characters, a lot of the stuff is either useless in most cases (such as buffs, and I will explain why in a bit) or situational but will never be drastically required ( demobilitization, for example, and I'll explain that in a bit too ). A lot of the skills/spells are simply a hindrance at lower levels (you have to level up skills and there's naturally a level requirement for each ""stage"" of a skill) and simply isn't worth it unless it is, well, worth it. The Valkyrie's dagger ability, for example, is pathetically weak and honestly not worth getting EVER. Now, the gameplay works using time units aka action points, which means stuff like demobilitization(stun, slow, etc.) naturally will remove action points upon the afflicted's turn, and not simply stop them from playing that turn. Why is this an issue, as I am trying to imply? Well, let's talk about how enemies act in this game. First off, groups. Always a group. This means if you pull a single enemy(let's assume you only see this one enemy), the whole group will follow. That's pretty shitty, especially if you can't SEE the rest of the enemies and considering the restriction of action points, you'll either end your turn in a situation where you'll get attack first or you'll try to run away and, chances are, you'll get attack first because - Oh, wait, I didn't mention this, did I? Enemies have drastically more AP than you, for example the spiders you encounter in the desert, area #2. Beautiful. If you're following my line of thinking, this means they attack more than you. Now, here's the obscure part that is overlooked in RPGs and the AI that controls the enemies - They will go for a SINGLE enemy and gang up on that single enemy until you either pull their attention (assuming there is such a skill or spell, I'm not entirely sure) or you kill them which is, well, unlikely since even the spiders are pretty beefy in this game. So, imagine this. You pull a group. A bunch of spiders rush to your party and... The first person attacked loses approx 50-75% of their health on the first turn. How do you feel? Well, not happy of course. It's something that ruined Neverwinter nights for me, as well as Baldur's Gate where the enemies would goose-chase your party members regardless of who it is. It's the lack of taunt-like skills but it's mixed in with a disgustingly high DPS caused by 5-ish enemies attacking a single party member, and that really stacks up. Now for the left overs. You lose gold everytime a party member dies, albeit the gold is, AFAIK, only used for buying equipment in the shop. They also never die permanently but they respawn after a few turns (it varies, it seems, as I've had 1 turn AND 2 turns for the same person on the same map, indefinitely) but they respawn at ""spires"" aka beginning of the map/spawn area, which will almost always be a far distance away unless you are getting destroyed on your first fight on a map, which is very plausible. Now, something I REALLY want to talk about is the bosses. The bosses are *absolute grindfests*. It's like making a mining simulator and it takes like 30 minutes to mine one rock. A boss that is specific to mention is the Wyrm(or whatever it is, but it's model is the 3-headed snake, previously seen to be used for a Wyrm enemy) which not only has a good 1500-ish HP on normal, but also has life-steal (was healing about 200 per turn for me). There's other bosses like this, like a manticore that you have to fight that is in the area after Beefy the SnakeEater aka BeefWyrm, that has about double the HP and somehow feels like it is the *exact same thing* except he's able to buff himself to take less damage and attack faster. REALLY has to be nerfed or at the very least, changed. That being said, HP, AP, and DMG definitely has to be adjusted to not feel like dark souls level of difficulty, especially on normal, which is the lowest difficulty. Also, the game is REALLY grindy.

How levelling works in this game is that your ""summoner"" or ""main immortal"" levels up and you distribute skill points among skill between your immortals, 1 per level, meaning your immortals don't get individual points.

The story is, sadly, pretty interesting. Basically, you start off in the game as a an ""immortal"", one that has been tied to someone else's being, perhaps soul. If they die, you lose your immortality. Interesting idea. Sadly, the dialogue feature(talking to people, making choices that give you misc. bonuses and apparently there is some romance in the game, of both genders too!) happens only when you beat a mission, so it's infrequent considering how long it takes to beat each map, generally speaking, about 20 minutes, depending on your pacing. 

So, I mentioned that there are free characters earlier. The 5 free characters are the Dryad, the Valkyrie, the Paladin, the Priestess, and the Druid. Pretty self-explanatory classes except the Valkyrie is agility-based as well as the Dryad(it's like a centuar-thing) and the Druid is strength-based, so that's a bit odd. The non-free characters are the Ivory Sentinel, the Beserker, the Pheonix Mage, the Summoner, the Tigress(like a Khajiit ranger, basically), the Inquisitor, the Treant, and the Banewitch. Now, don't fret. The currency used for the in-game store(""Radiance"") is acquirable by completely achievements and challenges, as well as daily quests, so you can earn the Radiance as a F2P model but it takes a while. In a few days of playing, I only got about 250-ish.

The music is nothing special. It's mostly atmospheric / ""just there"" so I'm not going to touch on it that much. The least I'll say is that it's better than nothing but I never noticed anything specifically intriguing.

The graphics are... Well, I'm not sure what they're called but they aren't eye-hurting. Great amount of detail put into the models and maps.

So, one thing I also wanted to point out is that there IS co-op/multiplayer for every level that I had played up until. That being said, I wanted to play alone and loot(and presumably XP) obtained by other players isn't shared with you, or it doesn't show up and so isn't something that will be noticed. The game seems like it's best played with others, so that you can overwhelm the enemies on a map but then... Why have a singleplayer at all if the odds are stacked in the first place?

That's pretty much the majority of what I have to say. Is the game bad? No. It's just not very polished at the time of this me writing this review. I put in a fair amount of time to get past the first area of the game and get into the ""real challenge"" part of the game, albeit the obligatory tutorial area of the game (I'd say the first 4 levels being increasingly worse) did get annoying easily. I won't suggest this game because there are many flaws that apply to anyone who isn't a raging ""game expert"" that coincidentally knows EXACTLY how to play this game. Not worth the trouble for me, especially since I get VERY angry at games that have ridiculous situations as well as punishments ontop of it to add insult to injury. No one wants to waste their time playing against ridiculous odds only to die over and over. It gets tedious and monotonous.",1457675154,1457675154,False,6,1,0.48618924617767334,5,False,False,False,False,,,

[b]Review:[/b]
	[i]Simple turn-based grind fantasy RPG, about how guys called 'immortals' are saving the world by grinding mobs. Before the details: the game feels very cheap overall, in all aspects. 
	A little bit cartoon style, or 'simple' style - or 'lazy' style? Whatever. There is 1 texture for every ground tile, 2 images for trees, 4 images for heroes (1 for each direction, because game utilizes square tiles), 1 image for item type (e.g. all 'gloves' are just recolors of 1 picture), 3 animations for each hero (walk, attack, death (cast is the same animation as attack)), maps are filled with exactly same objects, etc - you got the 'lazy' point. Plus all the art in game is done in very simplistic style (it was supposed to be 'cozy retro' style I guess).
	Simplicity doesn't end here though. Each hero has 6 normal abilities and 2 ultimates - like in MOBAs, but more simple: like 'Fireball - deal 300 dmg to enemy', 'Meteor - deal 200 dmg in area', 'Heal - heal all allies in area for 300 hp', and that's it - they are all like that. Note: this is not MOBA, this is RPG. No skill trees or anything. All abilities cost mana and time - the resource you get every turn. When there is no enemy you regenerate rapidly, but still walk in turns - and when there is 'no time' to walk somewhere this turn, game displays this annoying message and doesn't 'catch' your click (pretty clutchy). There is also no arrow or anything indicating what and how my hero will do after I click, and you can only wonder how far and where you can go with your 'time' - and they sometimes walk in very strange pathes.
	There are 13 immortals atm, and all but 4 are locked at start. You can buy them with premium currency Radiance, which is bought with money or grinded hard. That's not a big problem though, they are so typical I had no courage to try them (keep in mind abilities above) - Druid, Fire Mage, Paladin, Cleric, Dryad, etc. You can pack your party with up to 5 immortals per.. uhmm.. party. You can not replace heroes but can start a new party and level up it from zero. Party has shared level and shared loot across its heroes, each level you choose whos ability or stats to level up.
	Interface (except for being visually simple) isn't designed well, and is extremely poorly tutorialized. I spent a minute both trying to enter needed mission and trying to leave a mission. Level ups are unintuitive too, I wasted couple points not knowing that this yellow frame means ""choose one each level: either stat or ability"", because game never said that, and you can't respend points unless whole reset with premium currency.
	Stats are just usual RPG stats, I won't even describe them. Damage system is physical = armor, magic = spell shield. Items are random generated like ""+2 x-stat, +3 y-stat"" but there's one thing.. they don't even have names! YES, just '[Rarity] [Type]' e.g. 'Divine Gloves' x3, devs seriously..? Year 2015..? And obviously (this should go without noticing in lazy-made games) items don't change immortals' appearance.
	There is also 'complicated' element of enchanting items with gems (yellow gem - lvl 1 power, red gem - lvl 2 power etc, combine 3 yellow gems and get 1 red gem - something like that) and something similar to runewords in Diablo II - combine some letter-glyphs and get enchantment. Okay at least something to push game above 'primitive' level.
	Campaign really has 'fully voiced characters', devs didn't lie. But after things like 'stone giant is terrorizing nearby village, you gotta help', and 'ok now go kill another 3 stone giants in next level', I have absolutely no courage to go through it. Between missions there are dialogues (with 3 facial animations) and I once got +1 stat for 'right' answer.. sigh. 'Dialog choices matter'.
	I can not say myself, but from what other people are saying the game is grindy as hell. Repeatedly do same quest over and over to get gold and loot and complete daily.
	There is also pvp and coop which I couldn't try for obvious reasons.
	Grind battles at low levels don't capture player's attention at all - click your simple ability, then right click this dude 10 times, pass the turn, watch how he hits you with fist 10 times (1 animation), right click this dude 10 times again, pass the turn etc. At least they allowed us to select all immortals and rightclick altogezer :D. I want to remind for dear developers: if the game doesn't capture attention in first 30 minutes people usually uninstall (and I 'survived' for an hour, though usually I go much longer even in bad games).[/i]

Provides lots of fun! It has great potential. At the moment of the review there were not much of game content yet for a MMO. I really hope that this game gets futher development!
Pros:
+ Many characters: some you can play from the beginning, some you will unlock by playing the game
+ The ""VIP"" in-game currency is easily earned by playing the game, so you can farm it to unlock a new character, like, each day!
+ Arena ""gauntlet"" system is really fun - facing waves of monsters with friends, and at higher levels a simple mistake may get the whole team killed!
+ Nice plot
+ No restrictions on player inteaction: free trade, free partying etc - play with friends or random people as much as you want!
+ Your character is as powerful as you design him - how good you are at the game depends on your build, skills and choices - and not on random. 

Cons:
- Game is quite short, and mostly you end up farming gauntlet arenas, which become repetetive, as they are not randomized.
- Again, lack of content: all items look the same with some little exceptions, monsters and player characters have all the same spells and skills. Hopefully it gets repaired with futher development.
- It might be tricky to learn to play for new players: most likely you will have to start over after first attempt of playing, considering your past mistakes. Not sure if this is a con though.
- Lack of players: there are probably not more than 100 players online at peak moments. This game deserves more attention, however, it should be filled with more content to get it.

Fully voiced characters give you a pleasant time through the campaing, which is fairly long and has replaying potential.

---Pay2Win---
First of all I don't like how its pay to win, but I will say I was hesitant at first to say this, because the game makes it easier than most games to earn in-game currency simply by completing quests or by killing enemies. But it still is an excrutiating grind if you were setting out to get even one paid for character, assuming you play for 1 hour a day you can expect to make 150 radians on a good day. So it would take you 5 days to get 1 paid for character. Its not as bad as many games I've played but its still rather long and the quests get alot harder so don't actually expect getting it in 5 days.

---Encourages Friendship---
The game as I've found it really encourages playing with friends, which is nice of course but I'm a lonewolf and if you are too then its gonna be a hard time leveling up. I made the mistake of using all of my 5 characters at my disposal and trying to level them up equaly, but you end up finding out pretty quickly that this simply won't work. The monsters get really strong really quick and will need to concentrate your fire into one or two characters but this leaves you unable to defend against enemies that have your weaknesses all figured out. So then you need a party that helps defend you.

---Pvp---
I haven't played much of this mode so you may have to hear someone elses voice in the matter, but what I could tell is its a small version of lol. Simply capture territories on the map to earn points for your team or for yourself depending on if you clicked 1v1, 2v2,3v3,etc. But It was oddly fun, but it may just be because my crew if characters was actually really well at handling these battles, because alot of people were just coming in with one or two super strong op characters, 
I could come in with one semi-decent character or two to distract him from 3 characters ready to take down the totems, ending the game quickly before he has time to recapture.

---Storyline---
I couldn't care about anything they were saying.

---Overall & Verdict---
It was suprisingly fun, but it is a fan of microtransactions. I recommend it being played with a friend but thats usually said about every game isn't it? The artstyle is simple and clean-cut, the skills are limited if your playing with 1 or two characters it will feel, the game encourages making friends and punishes ones that don't want ones.

Final verdict:7/10 playing alone, 8/10 if your with friends.

Either way, play it, you'll love it for either a few hours,or years.",1451466919,1451466919,True,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

As an example, already on area 7 there is a boss that can't be beat with 3 characters at avg level 5... even if managing to change the character tanking damage from boss. After the fight, it still has 30% health and requires leveling grind to overcome.

Some normal encounters can be a bit unbalanced. Imagine controlling 3 characters with each having their own movement speed, then initiating a fight on one of them - the monsters attack that one character closest to them and sometimes there are too many, getting you low really quickly and making that one hero useless. This kind of aggression from the enemy can be frustrating on missions with a bonus objective to protect NPCs - but made easier by overleveling (grinding) your character levels.

The f2p model seems fair, but if you want to make a specific hero loadout, you have to wait and grind before you have enough radiance to unlock the heroes you want.

I'll update this at some point after I've played through it again.

This is a very good tactical rpg (same style of game as final fantasy tactics, xcom, etc.; in this one you control six characters if I remember correctly) but it also has multiplayer options (three modes last time I played, pvp, gauntlet (co-op arena style combat), and co-op campaign. It's a free to play, but legitamately free to play if you want (the premium currency can be farmed in-game at a reasonable pace with no limit).

Now with that out of the way onto the review (I'll update this at some later time, for now I'm just giving the short version).

The short version:
Pros:
-Excellent tactical gameplay
-Can be competitive (and even the 'best/highest rank/however you want to phrase that' player) as a free to play player.
-Diverse classes/characters (every class has their own set of abilities and plays differently from all of the other classes).
-Motivated and active developer. He hangs out in the game chat now and then (sometimes he's on quite a lot).
-At least reasonably good story (at least of couple of surprises and some decent replay value because you can go back through to get the dialogue options you didn't take the first time).
-Fun single player (or if you prefer co-op) campaign and multiplayer options.
-Probably several other things that aren't coming to mind at the moment.

Cons:
Noteworthy:
-In the past there hasn't been a large player basis. In part this is probably because the game was released in stages and by the time multiplayer and the full campaign were out most people had moved on. Hopefully the steam release has fixed that :)
-Tournaments weren't built into the game and instead were run by the developer which sometimes lead to confusion about the rules/guidelines for tournaments. Hopefully this has been fixed or at least there is some pvp mode with built-in prizes now.

Minor:
-I wouldn't be too surprised if pvp still needs some balancing but it will probably take awhile to figure out in what way. That said I wouldn't be too worried about it, as said the developer is quite dedicated to the game and is willing to listen to the games community and incorperate suggestions.
-The graphics weren't great but it looks like they have gotten a major update so that's probably less of a con than it was and honestly this is a game you play for the gameplay not the graphics.
-Initial loading time: When you first load the game and the first time you load it after any major update it takes a long time to load. This was an intentional choice by the game designer and the pay-off for it is that subsequent load times are fairly quick, (a lot faster than most of the other games I have played).
-Probably a few other things that aren't coming to mind, but there weren't any other noteworthy issues that I can recall.

This wouldn't be so bad if it was only for optional stuffs like skins etc but most of the classes are paywalled behind by this radiance. 4 out of the 5 classes you get for free are melee and this game heavily favors ranged (it uses a time action system and moving to melee range means you loses attack/time while ranged characters get free attacks before the enemies get to you).

Each of the classes is priced at an absurd 750 and you only get 15 per daily. You may get some extra from challenges (5 per) but these are doable only once per map unless you repeatedly create/delete character over and over.

The dev reply to this is that you also get 1 radiance per kill (my experience is that it's more like every 2 kills) but this is a misdirection play as it is valid only when the mob is within 5 levels of your hero level (total levels of all your chars in your party). You can't choose to not levelup your hero level (even when you choose not to levelup the individual immortals) - i.e. you'll quickly outlevel everything you fight just by playing normally and end up getting no radiance, more so if you play it typically and add in extra immortals in your party. 

Add in other radiance sinks like runes/enchants/gear/respec (and even deleting a char from your party costs like 15 per level! ) etc.. and you'll quickly realise it's your typical cashgrab p2w game from a former flash/java applet game.",1450697096,1450699002,False,64,5,0.598682641983032227,5,False,False,False,False,,,

Вообще, конечно, смотрится мягко говоря устаревше, не сказать что это однозначный минус, быть может кто-то поностальгирует по былым временам, когда похожие игры выходили на телефонах в досмартфоновскую эпоху. В любом случае выпускать такую игру был смелый шаг.
А вот что касается артов, создатели поработали на славу, на скриншотах это видно. Здесь уже все на уровне весьма неплохого квеста.

В игре существует сюжет, но честно говоря почти в него не вникал, его наличие скорее небольшой бонус, не так уж он  необходим.

Как и положено играм с такой системой игрокам предложено примерно 1/3 классов. Две другие части можно разблокировать по мере долгой и усердной игры, либо купить за донат.

Бои идут пошагово, передвижения тоже. Помимо классических полосок с маной и здоровьем у персонажа есть очки действий. С каждым шагом, атакой или использованием умений они сокращаются. Собственно исходя из названия игры - ваш персонаж и персонажи других игроков не могут умереть. Точнее могут, но возродятся через пару ходов, потеряв часть золота.

Наверное главное достоинство игры в ее публичности и важности в кооперативном прохождении. Конечно можно играть в одиночку, но по моему уже на 2ом уровне возникнут сложности с прохождением. Вовсе необязательно иметь кучу друзей или опасаться киканий из лобби из за никого уровня. 
Достаточно выбрать уровень, поставить галку Подключиться к уже начатой игре и система автоматически направит вас в игру с другими игроками. Если никто в это время не играет на этой карте, то вы появитесь один, но потом кто-нибудь может присоединиться к вам. 
Не знаю есть ли лимит игроков в начатой игре, иногда собираются целые армии из новичков, разбегающихся как муравьи по карте и устраивающих грандиозные сражения. 
Вот тут-то и возникает 1-ый существенный минус. Чем больше игроков, тем дольше приходится ждать пока все закончат ход. Новые игроки зачастую не расходуют все очки действия и не замечают этого, либо долго соображают что уже начался новый ход. 

Другой небольшой недостаток - это пока нехватка освоившихся игроков. 

Ну и конечно среди минусов весьма существенно отсутствие русского языка и любых других кроме английского.

В любом случае проект интересный и достойный внимания. Надеюсь будет развиваться и соберет больше участников.

     This game has very beautiful art, the people and settings look so good. That is, when you're not actually playing the game. The cutscenes are gorgeous, whereas the game itself is a bit of a let down in the graphics department. It makes the game look much older than it needs to be.

     Storywise, it seems very intriguing, as you play as an ""Immortal"" a being that cannot die. In this game, you are not the caster of such creatures, instead you are the creature, which put an interesting spin on an old fashioned gametype. Other than that, the game is turned based, and multiplayer so its good.

Já as músicas, eu tenho certeza que existe uma inspiração GIGANTESCA em JRPGs mais antigos, principalmente nas obras de Motoi Sakubara (Valkyrie Profile, Star Ocean, etc).

Com isso, comparando com tantos grandes nomes, difícil falar que o jogo é ruim. Para um jogo F2P, a proposta é boa e funciona. Recomendo pra quem curte um RPG mais old school e quer ter essa experiência de forma online.

Dunno much about the community of this game, i play only with friends, but so far we love it. very simple and effective take on a tactical RPG game, fun with friends, probably boring alone. has a little bit of a phone app game feel the way almost everything asks you to put real life money towards it, though. 

If some of the GUI was done differently it wouldn't feel so... sleazy? Something. like how DOTA totally asks you for money but doesn't do it CONSTANTLY. this game doesn't have that. it feels... a little cramped the way they put up real life cash options everywhere. 

Anyways, aside from that I love it. I'm a huge fan of turn based strategy games and have never seen one done quite the way they did this. It's not exactly fully turn based in that everyone takes a turn at the same time on one team, then the other team. The limits are action points, called ""time"" in this game. you can only take so many actions/moves in your turn, though they may happen simultaneously and your friend might take the position you wanted.


Overall I'd give it a solid 9.25/10  simply because i love the simplicity and execution of a game i can easily play with a friend and still feel like it's a tactical genre.  That rating is only for the lovers of tactics games, btw.  As far as objective game I'd say closer to 6.25/10  but worth a try regardless because it's free. Again: free in the same way league of legends is. all the good stuff costs a bit of cash or a LOT of grind.

There are a couple of opening tips that the game doesn't make clear and you will want to take note of:
 Each time YOU level up you can only level a single skill/attribute/feature of a single character. This means you will be most useful if you only ever have one character. Your first character's name will also be YOUR name as far as your community presence goes. The first thing you should do when you start this game is hit the ""?"" and read the help notes. Or you will want to start over from scratch very quickly. Many players prefer to play with a single character as this provides the fastest way to create a powerful presence for gauntlet games. I have revised my opinion on this because making a party for your first account is more fun, familiarises you with hero types, and you lose nothing by it because you can still create ""solo"" accounts later and use your party account for farming. ""radience"" the in game currency is effected across all accounts linked to your steam acct and items can be passed down through other players. Given that it's ""free"" it's certainly well worth a look. But be prepared for some grind.

Le gameplay est certe basique, mais assez bien élaboré.
C'est un mix entre un Baldur's Gate et un Diablo

Il y a actuellement 13 personnages jouable : 5 gratuit / 8 a débloquer (lire jusqu'a bout pour comprendre le systeme)

Le système d'évolution de notre personnage et de notre équipe est vraiment interessant.
Quand vous gagner de l'expérience, c'est votre ""compte"" qui gagne des niveaux, et le but est donc de dépenser ses niveaux accumulés dans notre ""compte"" en compétence ou stats pour nos personnages.
Par exemple, le fait d'avoir un niveau de ""compte"" 40 vous permettra d'avoir soit un personnage monté niveau 40, soit deux personnage niveaux 20 ou jusqu'a cinq personnages niveau 8. Sur ce point, c'est a vous de décider si vous préferer avoir un ""gros"" personnage, ou plusieur ""petit"". En sachant que le niveau maximum d'un personnage est 80. Et que le niveau de ""compte"" est 250 acutellement (si je ne dis pas de bétises). Il est donc tout a fait possible d'avoir plusieurs personnage niveau maximum.

Le coté multi/coop est vraiment sympatique lui aussi.
En effet, vous pouvez être jusqu'a quatre joueurs dans une même partie. C'est a dire entre 4 personnages et 20 personnage joueurs a l'écran (sans compter les invocations).
Il y a une campagne coopérative bénéficiant d'une bonne durée de vie, car en plus d'y avoir une cinquantaine de niveau different, il y a aussi une bonne rejouabilité du fait qu'il y a quatre modes de difficulté différentes. Et chaque difficulté contenant ses propres challenge.
Il y a un mode nommé ""The Gantlet"" qui permet a une équipe de quatre joueurs d'essayer de survivre a une sorte d'arene où des combats s'enchaine assez rapidement, Et qui est d'ailleur une très bonne source d'expérience, d'équipement et surtout de Radiant (voir plus bas pour le Radiant).
Et pour finir, il y a du PVP, a 1v1 ou 2v2.
La Durée de vie est donc plus que concequante.

Pour ce qui est du CashShop, il n'est pour moi pas P2W.
La monnaie du Shop s'appelle la ""Radiance"".
Et cette derniere peut être gagner en jouant, et ce de plusieur façon.
La premiere est pas le biaie des Quêtes Journalière qui donne entre 15 et 45 Point de Radiance.
La deuxième façon est grâce au fameux challenge présent dans la campagne principal.
Et La dernière mais qui est la mieu récompensé a mon avis est que quand vous combatter des monstres ayant moin de 5 niveau de moin que votre ""compte""  ( exemple : ""compte"" level 40 / montres de niveau 35 minimum) vous gagnerez donc 1 point de Radiance, et ce, tout les deux montres tuer.
Et sachant que, par exemple, acheter un nouveau personnage bloquer coûte 750 point de Radiance
En 20h de jeux, j'ai actuellement cumullé 900 point de radiance.

En bref, je recommande chaudement ce jeu !",1449496925,1449613266,True,13,3,0.700299739837646484,1,False,False,False,False,,,

So far the story seems to be primarily about riding the world of this corruption that its found itself in, as of me writing this review I have not progressed very far in the story.  The immortals themselves are your playable heroes who respawn after death, there is a pretty decent variety of immortals to chose from, the majority falling under standard RPG class system, dps assassins, melee tanks, healers, supports and even a few immortals who have hybrid skill sets.

The combat is turnbased and functions around a unique resource called time, not only does movement and attack run off of this resource, so do most ability cool downs, so when running a large party its always good to have an idea what order you should use your skills in. When it comes to game modes, aside from the campaign, there is gauntlet mode, from what I can tell you try to survive with a group of co-op players against waves of enemies for increasingly valuable rewards. I have not played much gauntlet as of this review.  Immortal Empire also has PvP or some sort, but I have not seen or tried PvP at this time.

I played this game SOOOOO much on kongregate back when I was like 16.
This is a REALLY REALLY good turn based strategy game. Its kind of simple at first, but the levels later on will have you trying multiple times to beat them because they can get hard. And not artificial difficulty. I mean you actually have out play the enemy. Despite alot of the classes being unlocked, you CAN earn the ingame currency to unlock them through challenges in missions and achievements. Or you can be like me and sell items from other games to not actually pay money out of pocket to unlock stuff anyways. On my Kongregate account I'd already bought 2 extra character slots and had about 250 Radiance left over. I dont think there were achievements before, and it reset the campaign progress for me, so I can just earn that Radiance over again and keep my old stuff B)

The story seems to have been updated and the UI may have seen some work, but the UI is still a little bit weak and all of the menus are a bit much to take in all at once, but it's still being updated after all these years so that's a major plus. Enemies I'd never seen before have been added to geh game, as well as some new story stuff I dont remember probably got added, though that's just because its been so long since I'd played this. There is a handfull of bugs and performance issues that I dont remember having when I played it in my browser, but this could just be the steam release having problems.

I always really like games where you can build your character in different ways. I have a Valkyrie that is built for tanking even though it's 'supposed' to be a dps class. I have a Priestess that can burst/buff rather than being a boring healbot. And I apparnetly bought a Paladin for something before I stopped playing before. But he was level one and I dont really know what I wanted to do with him. But I always enjoy games where you arent restricted to make your character 'heal bot' 'tank machine' and 'killy mc die in one hit' because thats what they're 'supposed' to be. Freedom to build your character however you want is a major plus from me.

This game is a VERY FUN party turnbased  RPG. Especially for it being free. Dont let the tutorial fool you. You dont just right click enemies 5 times per turn. Those are level 1 characters with 1 ability and no mana/mana regen.

Gauntlet mode is insanely fun. 4 player Co-op survival against waves of enemies. 

I played this game SOOOOO much on kongregate back when I was like 16.
This is a REALLY REALLY good turn based strategy game. Its kind of simple at first, but the levels later on will have you trying multiple times to beat them because they can get hard. And not artificial difficulty. I mean you actually have out play the enemy. Despite alot of the classes being unlocked, you CAN earn the ingame currency to unlock them through challenges in missions and achievements. Or you can be like me and sell items from other games to not actually pay money out of pocket to unlock stuff anyways. On my Kongregate account I'd already bought 2 extra character slots and had about 250 Radiance left over. I dont think there were achievements before, and it reset the campaign progress for me, so I can just earn that Radiance over again and keep my old stuff B)

TL;DR :

O jogo é uma mistura de conceitos de x-com com DOTA. Assim é um jogo de batalha por turno com criaturas chamadas de imortais, que possuem 6 habilidades e 2 ultimates que podem ser utilizados consumindo uma unidade de tempo.

Cada turno você possui X unidades de tempo para usar com cada unidade, assim você precisa derrotar outros inimigos para cumprir algum objetivo.

Análise:

Pontos Positivos:

* Todos diálogos do jogo apresentam as vozes dos personagens.
* Mistura de conceitos, o que torna este jogo bem único.
* Me pareceu relativamente rica a possibilidade da customização do seu immortal.
* Possibilidade de multi-player, o que torna o jogo bem mais competitivo.
* Diversos elementos de RPG e DOTA.

Pontos Negativos:

* A parte visual do jogo é bem simples.
* Número baixo de immortals, além de poucos que são de graça.
* Os items apresentarem sprites muito semelhantes.
