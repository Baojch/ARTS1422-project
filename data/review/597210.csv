Wenn Hobbyprojekte kommerzialisiert werden, bedeutet es ja manchmal, dass da was Tolles, Innovatives entstanden ist (siehe Dear Esther, The Forgotten City). Das ist bei dem kleinen Point und Click-Abenteuer [i]Bayou Island[/i] des britischen Front End-Entwicklers Andy Howard nicht der Fall: Das Spiel bleibt amateurhaft mit einigen Schwächen und manchen Stärken, die für mich den ca. 1-stündigen Ausflug gerade noch zufriedenstellend abschließen ließen.

[b]Hau den Lukas – Stärken[/b]
Erfrischend vertraut ist einem einfach eine ganz klassische Point und Click-Spielwiese ohne Experimente und technische Fehler. Die Geschichte von einem Mysterium auf der namensgebenden Insel selbst reißt dabei keine Bäume aus, ist aber bis zum übermütigen Ende durchaus spannend und nett erzählt. Was heraussticht ist neben der Musik aber die komplette Vertonung des Spiels: Und ich meine, die ist sogar semiprofessional gelungen! Gefallen hat mir zudem die Grafik, die einen zusammenhängenden Stil erkennen lässt, den ich mit zusammengebastelten Transparentpapierflächen beschreiben würde.

[b]Schnell weg von dieser Insel – Schwächen[/b]
Und dann gibt es die Schwächen, die selbstredend vorhanden sind: Die Geschichte ist zwar zu Ende erzählt, man merkt aber deutlich, dass einiges geplant war, nie umgesetzt und dann ein übereiltes Ende eingefügt wurde. Auch die Rätsel sprühen nicht gerade von Einfallslust: sie sind – bis auf eine Ausnahme – sehr simpel und linear. Dass diese beiden Fehlstellen für ein Abenteuer Hauptbestandteile sind, erklärt auch die leicht ins Negative tendierende Bewertung (44% positiv) auf Steam und meine eingeschränkte Empfehlung.

[code]Ein Nischentitel, dessen Bewertung durch seine Mischung aus laienhaften Rätseln, übereiltem Ende und einigen Qualitätsmerkmalen (Grafikstil, Voiceacting) durchmischt ausfällt. Als kleiner Happen für den Point und Click-Liebhaber aber durchaus ein Anspielen wert.[/code]

Now, I was pleasantly surprised with this game's graphics, sound and music - they are of quite high quality, especially the backdrops and music, which were both very nice, and fit each other very well. All dialogues are also fully voiced (with the exception of a few here 'n' there - not sure if that's due to a bug causing the sound to not activate, or whether the developer just didn't insert audio files for those particular sentences, for whatever reason), including your character's commentary on every single interactive item.

But this game was far too short, and ended really abruptly. And I mean [b][i]really[/i][/b]. I seriously thought the plot was just about to thicken, and we were about to enter the 2nd chapter, when suddenly ""The End"" appeared. I literally was like, [b][i]HUH????[/i][/b]

To be fair, the story itself is resolved. But the whole gaming experience ended up being unsatisfying because of how little gameplay was involved, and how rushed (and a bit absurd) the ending felt. Things might have been better if there were a longer lead-in to the conclusion.

My total actual playtime was only around 30 minutes. (I left the game running while going to get lunch and doing a few other things.) I would say you could complete this game in maybe 15 minutes or so, if you didn't have to wait for your character to walk sloooooowly from one place to the next. There's no way to adjust walking speed btw, and you also can't fast-travel between locations.

While there were many minor but irksome issues with user ergonomics (such as having to click specifically on ""Skip"" to fast-forward dialogue, instead of being able to click anywhere on the screen, for instance), as well as some bugs (like the Tiki Bar waiter whom you can still talk to even though he's supposed to have left the screen), the biggest issue for me was that [b][i]everything ends just as it's getting better.[/i][/b] Just when you're just starting to feel comfortably settled in this gorgeous virtual world you've been transported to, you are suddenly, forcefully yanked out of it. It's not a nice feeling at all.

I also hated the main character's (the guy you play) voice acting. It was excruciatingly slow and completely expressionless. All the other characters in the game were voiced so much better.

I feel sorry downvoting a point and click adventure, but I have to do it this time. This isn't a horrible game, I think the designer is on a good track, but I felt like playing more of an experiment rather than a real game sold up here. I finished it in less than 1hr with no effort, and for 5€ this is insufficient.

What's good: I like the style of the graphics, it also fits the whole atmosphere of the game. I liked the sound effects and the music too.

Unfortunately, the rest is poorly executed.
First of all there is barely a plot, which is a big problem for a point and click adventure. The entire game ends without explaining much, and the general feeling of this experience is of a game that is trying hard, really hard, to accomplish something (being funny, consistent), but falls short.
Talking about the gameplay instead: the animations are clunky, they need to be smoothed over. Horizontal scrolling needs a logical rework (every time you click on the screen the character stops). Even though voices are good and clear, they are ruined by dubbing. Dubbing is out of sync most of the time and sentences between characters are separated by way too long pauses. Subtitles are fixed in the top center of the screen, which can be disturbing.

I see potential in the guy that developed this, but this is not enough for recommending this kind of product as of now.",1568368590,1568368590,False,1,0,0.474192947149276733,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game was created by a one person indie game developer, who probably did all artwork and voice acting himself. There is a lot of potential. The game is not perfect, but good enough. Easy to Medium difficulty of puzzles, with one suddenly difficult one near the end. 

If you enjoy point & click adventures I suggest you give it a go. However due to the shortness of the story I'd suggest you get this in a bundle or buy full price to support the developer so he will create more point & click games. 

The Good:
+ Classic adventure point & click
+ Good music

The Bad:
- Short for the price

The game can be completed in about 30 minutes, depending on your point & click experience. 

5 minutes of gameplay so you get a good impression of the game:

It has a great concept for story, setting, characters, atmosphere... Everything has a great concept to it!
Unfortunately, the concept is the best part of the game, and when you have a great concept, but everything else is just kinda ""meh"", the whole thing just leaves you... Disappointed.
The idea for the story is great, but it was short, and barely a cohesive story. There could've been so much more of it. And I'll admit, I like the ending, but it felt so rushed, and again, disappointing.
The location is a mysterious island that [spoiler]has ghosts on it[/spoiler], but [spoiler]you meet one and ONLY ONE ghost, and even then only for like 2 seconds, because all you do with him is give him a picture for his girlfriend and then he leaves[/spoiler], and that's just disappointing. So much more could've been done with the backstory for this island. At the very least, have some of the characters talk about it more.
Speaking of the characters, they all had so much potential to fun and interesting! But they were all just kinda... Blah. Seriously, the [spoiler]drunk guy[/spoiler] had the most character. Even the main character is just robotic. The voice acting is decent, but none of the characters' dialouge was very good, and even the best actors can't save bad scripts. And the script wasn't even bad, per se, but again just disappointing. No witty dialouge or sarcastic comments that are often the hallmark of point-and-click adventures. And in the few places where there ARE jokes, they often feel just as boring as the rest of the dialouge. So much of the game could've been made so much better with a little bit of clever dialouge, and it really just left me wanting to play a WadjetEye or old LucasArts game.
Overall, the game really just made me wish the people who made it had done more with it. It's not that I don't like the game, but I honestly wish there was more substance to it. Just do MORE with it!

This isn't a horrible game, I think the designer is on a good track, but I felt like playing more of an experiment rather than a real game sold up here. I finished it in less than 1hr with no effort, and for 5€ this is insufficient.

What's good: I like the style of the graphics, it also fits the whole atmosphere of the game. I liked the sound effects and the music too.

Unfortunately, the rest is poorly executed.
First of all there is barely a plot, which is a big problem for a point and click adventure. The entire game ends without explaining much, and the general feeling of this experience is of a game that is trying hard, really hard, to accomplish something (being funny, consistent), but falls short.
Talking about the gameplay instead: the animations are clunky, they need to be smoothed over. Horizontal scrolling needs a logical rework (every time you click on the screen the character stops). Even though voices are good and clear, they are ruined by dubbing. Dubbing is out of sync most of the time and sentences between characters are separated by way too long pauses. Subtitles are fixed in the top center of the screen, which can be disturbing.

I see potential in the guy that developed this, but this is not enough for recommending this kind of product as of now.",1499527738,1499528203,False,26,0,0.713983416557312012,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This is a fairly short game, and the puzzles are pretty simple. The plot seems a bit off the rails, but that's kinda typical for a PnC game anyway. Some people seem pretty put off by the voice acting but although it was fairly bland I didn't find much else to fault it with. But I'm not a great judge of acting of any sort so take from that what you will. 

My biggest gripe with the game was the slightly clunky controls. Having to click on ""view"" or ""use"" in the inventory before interacting with an item is old-school, but in a way that makes me sort of glad most newer games have given up that minor annoyance. And the walking controls seemed really clunky, with the PC stopping randomly and not recognizing certain parts of the screen to move forward.

Some things are worthy of praise. I thought the backgrounds were lovely, they had a sort of storybook pastel cutout look that's neat. They looked hand drawn (although again, I don't actually know). The music was pleasant and on theme too. Catchy, I'll easily have it in my head the rest of the night. And it is original music, written just for the game. 

I think those two major points show a bunch of care and effort went into thise game, which is the developer's first. The way the developer has been engaging on the discussion boards and incorparating suggested changes to improve the flaws of the game is also really nice to see. I look forward to seeing more from this developer.

The gameplay is pretty simple and experienced puzzle gamers might find it to be less than challenging, but if you're looking for something to kill maybe an hour or two, this is a good choice.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play a cruise ship captain named Chris that somehow arrived at this mysterious island. How did you get here? Where is your boat? Explore to find various odd ball characters and items to find out.

As you talk to the other residents, learning that this island is named Bayou Island, you learn what goes on in the first area. Everyone here seemed to have washed up on the shore not knowing how they could of. There is also a correlation with boats disappearing as well. However Chris is a different story, having another passenger with him.

There is not much ways to grab hold onto the plot, as a lot is mysterious and questioning, especially the ending twist. As the price tag suggests, Bayou Island is a short. But the second half seems rushed compared to the first half, especially how the ending is so abrupt. There are a lot of questions other

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
With the ease of point and click mechanics, it is very easy to play. A wheel of options shows what you can possibly do. The only thing you might have to get used to is selecting the ""use item"" before clicking on an item. With the game's short stay I was not able to remember to use it every time, but I do see why it was made like that. Combining items is used by dragging an item to another so perhaps it was to not confuse the game.

On the puzzle side most of them were easy, taking no time at all. Some requiring you to just talk with the residents as the others needs items that are just laying around for anyone to steal. One had you playing an instrument, but it did not make sense what the character did in result of it. I do know that if you play an instrument behind someone inside a building, it will sound like it's inside the building. Not outside, especially when the person saw you coming inside. Other than this, another puzzle did not make sense at all. It is a combination but getting it is full of red herrings. It's not something obvious, it's not something based on the amount of certain items (which I initially thought), but based on time. With the descriptions of the objects not being useful till now, it's very weird considering the clue you get. The main red herring seems to be for something else that was originally planned but was scrapped.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
The music accompanying each area goes well with the surroundings. The music in the Day of the Dead store, and the area behind it, has a Latin flare to it. Making it seem like Chris did get washed up on the Day of the Dead, which is possible but no decorations are shown outside of the shop.

The voice acting can be better. There are some that did well, such as the bartender, but the one for Chris is not as much. Sometimes it gives off a sarcastic tone while other times he pauses where it seems it should not. There are parts where it works of course, but not throughout the whole piece.

[h1]Art Style[/h1]
The art style is pleasant to look at, with the Day of the Dead area is the best. Backgrounds having some sort of color pallet depending where the area might be. While they do tell you boats disappeared, why can one be seen in the background? Some areas have weird proportions in the backgrounds, such as the bar's counter looking taller than Chris even though the bartender is the same height as you.

The characters do seem to have time put into them to make them unique. However one design is not on the store page, which also only has the side perspective.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Bayou Island runs well, not putting pressure onto your computer. The only options you do get is volume and you can go into windowed mode by hitting escape. Though I could not find a way to exit out of the game without going to windowed mode and closing out of that.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
Of course with point and clickers, the only reason to really replay is for achievements or seeing the different choices you could of made if able to. Bayou Island currently has no achievements and no trading cards so replayability might not be there. You can go back and see all the hints towards the ending twist, but that’s about it.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
+ Appropriate music
+ Art

+/- Voice acting can be better
+/- Puzzles spike in difficulty at the end

- Ends abruptly

Looking more into it, I do see that this is the developer’s first game. Originally going to be a two parter, with the first part having a different system in interacting. I will recommend a few things. The subtitles may work better on the bottom of the screen, and perhaps being able to skip by just clicking than having to press a skip button. Putting in a few animations can help, such as putting a 'waking up' animation instead of having the drunk man sit up and go to sleep immediately. Is Bayou Island so horrible that you shouldn’t buy it? No. With the problems it has, it still has all the aspects of being a good point and clicker. There are things to learn from and I hope this developer continues making games.

It's better than most of your independent point and clicks (which are mostly just screen transitions borderlining hidden object puzzles rather than containing animations).

I would expect that this is perhaps the developers first project on this scale as there are some minor issues;

- The voice of the protagonist is annoyingly delayed compared to the subtitles, it feels like there's a 1 second load time on each line of dialogue.
- Most of it is pleasantly logical, however 1 puzzle I found unnecessarily abstract.
- The lack of a menu is disappointing and with no obvious auto-save feature it makes you reluctant to close the program for fear of losing what you have done so far.
