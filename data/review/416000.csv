I am speechless.

This game is like if someone gives you a puzzle that makes a beautiful picture, but as you try to put the pieces together, it's hard to get the pieces to fit in each slots and you end up breaking them. You could probably still play with the puzzle pieces, but it's a mess and it's not fun.

This has so much potential, the art style is beautiful and it could've been much more. 

However the first half an hour I played is just me having question marks all over my face because I don't know what are things that can be interacted with or not. 

The control is janky as hell and you end up with always using your tools when you try to interact with the townsfolk. 

It's so hard to interact with anything, or anyone in that matter. When you enter a room you can still move wherever you want as you wait the screen to turn black to move you. 

When you use pillow outside, if you keep repeating it (happens when I tried to interacting with people and having the pillow as active tool) it glitches and transports you because the game still counted your movements prior to the sleeping animation.

Even interaction wise, the start of the scenario didn't make me feel welcomed. I've talked with few villagers and they just make me go 'ugh' and I just don't care enough for them.

The sound designs... I don't know if it's just me or anyone else felt the same but it was so, so, so grating and annoying that I had to turn the volume off. And this, I actually tried adjusting the volume in game and it didn't work! Even when I turned it to 0! I don't know anymore...

It was a shame because I really like the art style. I do. And I hope as more time is spent (looks at the 2017 release date...) ... This game will be truly finished. In a playable way.",1687277449,1687277449,False,6,0,0.499093711376190186,0,True,False,True,True,,,

I'll start this by saying- I understand this game is EA, and has been since it's release in April 2017, with that said I originally played the game in June 2019 and it was working much better and had less issues. 
I got this game in June 2019 and I can't exactly remember the price but I think I grabbed for around 7-10$. The fact they are now charging 24.99$ USD for this broken hot mess is gross and the game is NOT worth that much right now.

When I originally played in 2019 I played 9 hours straight no issues. In 2023 I played over 1 hour and I've had issues left and right, having to quit and restart trying to change options and stuff. 
I have issues with the volume. I turned the music volume down to 25 and going into stores the music still blasts in my headset.

I stopped playing originally because I got bored and then decided to wait for updates, forgot about it then finally decided to replay it 5 years later since they did so many updates.... 
When I first started playing I was able to fully play with Xbox 360 controller. I have the same controller and can no longer play with controller? Because somehow using controller got broken in an update?

Fast forward to 2023 finally decided to check the game out, they did a complete overhaul town and area is completely different. Though now I can't do the tutorial at all tried 3 times, it freezes up and doesn't let me do anything. So I had to skip the tutorial. I get black screens every now and then when I try to transition to areas, I can fully say this is NOT a PC problem but issues with the game.

I noticed I have to sometimes click multiple times just to pick up stuff from the ground.
I get they're updating the game, and that's great but there needs to be much more work done.
I remember the game play and controls being so much better 5 years ago than it is now. The game looks prettier but that's about it so far. 

As it stands right now, wait to get the game, whether it's on sale or months from now when it's fully playable. The devs need to fix this a lot more before it's 100% playable and working again. I'll wait around some more since it's way too late to refund the game anyway and see how it progresses, but going from a working game, to completely revamping it and now it's buggy as heck isn't a good sign as of right now.

The things that they _did_ work on, was taking everything out that made the game charming and a refreshing alternative to the already stale and overhyped other type(s) of this genre.

I strongly advise anyone to decide for themselves if they want to spend an insolent amount of 25 € for a game that is most likely going to be abandoned again soon, after being in EA for six years now and with an already dead, yet still available predecessor, that nets them money for no amount of work whatsoever.",1670333101,1670347866,False,20,0,0.68116152286529541,0,True,False,True,True,,,

Bei mir hängt sich auf die Quest - einen Hahn (rooster) bei Lucas kaufen und der Kochwettbewerb ist verbuggt
und zwei wichtige Quests sind auch unlösbar - bei mir fehlt ein Bewohner komplett ""Rory"" und so kann ich mich nicht allen vorstellen.
Und ich kann die Quest ""Investigating the Forest"" nicht lösen - da man Cloe leider nicht darauf ansprechen kann. nach dem man die Flasche gefunden hat. 
Eigentlich ein kleines unterhaltsames Spiel ohne Stress, aber da man wichtige Quests nicht lösen kann, hat man doch Stress und kommt irgend wann nicht weiter. Es gibt teilweise auch nur sehr wenige Tipps zu den Quests InGame. Da muss man im Internetz nach Hilfe suchen. Schade.

I feel like the game can be a bit unresponsive with a controller, in regards to selecting and completing actions with A. There have been no issues picking items up, but things like knocking on doors and especially interacting with the ground to hoe land/plant seeds/water plants usually needs 2 taps of A to register. My other issue is related. I have arthritis in my thumb on my right hand, and it would be much easier for me to play using a controller if there was at least the option to hold down the action button to repeatedly do an action. I can't play for very long because the need to repeatedly press the button with my thumb causes me pain. I realise I will be in a minority with the latter.

Not to say the game is inherently bad, it has potential for something amazing and I really do believe so, but as of its current state I wouldn't recommend buying it. I'm unsure if it'll ever get out of said-state since the last update was over a year ago, also with it being still in early access since 2017.

Didn't play much since it got mundane quite fast, but from what I've played I'll be listing some pros and cons.

Pros:
[list]
    [*]Appealing pixel style. Designs of the characters can be a hit or miss, but when it's good it's really good. Some portraits are inconsistent in terms of size but it's a minor issue.

    [*]Has some good ideas, like the companion system where an NPC joins your ""party"" as he/she follows you wherever you go and can be interacted with.

    [*]Lots of animals not only to take care of in your farm, but out in the wilderness too.

    [*]NPCs locations are shown on your map. This can also be seen as a con, as it takes you out of your immersion by not letting you discover their paths by yourself, but it can be helpful for finding specific ones for tasks.
[/list]

Cons: 
[list]
    [*]The areas (the townsquare, mountains, forest, etc) are [i] far [/i] too oversized, boring, empty and repetitive. Needs either massive map downscaling or environmental diversity/filling in. 

    [*]Knocking on doors animation takes ages, especially if you want to talk multiple times to the NPC.

    [*]The music can get VERY annoying as it's the same throughout the entire day.

    [*]Adding text that tells you you've already given the NPC a gift today to make it clearer as to why it wouldn't register would be nice.

    [*]Action/confirm and Use Item/Tool keys are the same mapping which can be confusing, [i] especially [/i] with the items and tools being in two separate bars which means you can accidentally consume something when you want to use a tool, because again, different bars meaning equipping two things at once with having a single button for both of them, not very smart design.
[/list]

Comparing it to Stardew Valley is almost unavoidable due to the similarities, which I think unfortunately highlights the glaring problems with Fantasy Farming. You're less constrained by the hours in the day, but you burn energy constantly with every single thing you do. And replenishing energy in any useful way costs thousands of dollars. Even sleeping for the night doesn't fully heal you. Money isn't terribly difficult to come by at least, but useful materials are.

Overall, I recommend it because at the end of the day, if you just want to play a farming sim, you'll probably have fun with it. But if you have anything else to compare it to, like Stardew, you may find it lacking. If there was a ""Meh"" option I would choose it.",1626897040,1658618550,True,1,0,0.521067440509796143,0,True,False,True,False,,,

If you're a classic Harvest Moon fan, then this game starts out similarly to the original game - you're given a farm and a dog, except this time you scavenge around for starting tools. However, before I get into how fun this game is, I want to point out a few things that bug me (even though the game is still in development) that borderline deter me from playing the game. Immersion in terms of NPC interaction and dialogue is pretty awkward and hard to understand when you try to see the big picture of town fluency. It feels a little forced at times. The only other tedious thing is mining, which costs way too much stamina because you're digging soil trying to find stairs as well as hammering mine-able objects. Assuming the stairs don't spawn where an object is spawned on the floor, you have to spend time digging before mining anything because you might forget and dig in a useless area. By the end of your trip, you barely make any progress in comparison to how much stamina and time is consumed for the act. The final, very small complaint that I have is that when you have seeds in your hotbar/inventory, the only way that you'd find out their season and their growth time is if you go back to the store and check it out again. (I think the magnifying glass may be used for this also? I haven't tried that out yet but I am a forgetful person and I tend to have to go back and check the store).

 I understand that some of these elements may change drastically by the end of Early Access, so take all of these things with a grain of salt. If anything could be suggested just for fun, I think a romance option for Billy would be funny and interesting since he's so bad at farming and he has an eye on your farm as your unfortunately ignorant rival.

I can't convey how easy to navigate and how useful the pause menu is. There's so much information at your fingertips and it keeps track of a BUNCH of little things for those that are interested in those beautiful statistics. Speaking of statistics, not only is the pause menu useful, but pretty much every other menu that paints profit margins for you and is visually appealing on top of all that. Once you get a basic understanding of the game, you don't have to look anything up outside of it nor do you have to take very many notes (for those that min/max the game or just get really, really into it like I do!) The character designs are unique and cute, but Bonnie makes me nervous. There's plenty of work to be done throughout the game as a farmer and yet it doesn't make me feel as though I'm rushing to the next project constantly due to seasonal constraint; it's a fluent and satisfying game so far. Even if the mining kills me. Wonderful game, would recommend to others.

As far as the marriage candidates go, I hope they do.

For the most part, I'm really enjoying this game. I like the exploration and the interactions. I like all the different animals. I really like the foundation and some of the ideas this game has implemented. I wish some things were more obvious to the user (like why my mushrooms aren't growing in the caves), but I also foresee this changing since it's Early Access. 

And for the record, I do recommend the game to others, purely because there is so much potential. Especially *given* that it's Early Access. And understand, that the romanceable characters are like the icing on the cake. The cake can still be delicious without it (sometimes you don't even need icing) -- but really good icing can change the entire flavor and make it that much better.

Which is exactly why I'm frustrated by it. 

For a game that boasts many marriage candidates (for the record, 5 men and 5 women isn't a lot, it's standard), I have a pretty big bone to pick with the ones they offer. 3/5 guys have a very similar hairstyle. Blondie has the most grating personality ever. Lucas has by far the most interesting design, but he has the personality of a wet noodle. The characters I'd love to romance -- like Gabriel or Duke, or even Billy aren't romanceable. Yumiko is a dime too. They are all non-marriage candidates. :( So I was like, okay, totally, I'll go for one of the ladies. But I feel like their designs are pretty similar too (3/5 with the same jaw and they all have long ass hair). I don't mind most of their personalities, but I the game devs are trying too hard to make them ""realistic."" It's okay to give them diverse personalities and lines -- in fact, I like the basis of this idea. But you also have to balance that notion with the fact that we are playing a game to have *fun* and escape reality. And hey, I wouldn't have an issue with it if any of the characters I was interested in were romanceable. But they aren't.

I hope that changes in the future. I would be so stinking excited to romance Gabriel. (And if they already announced more and I missed it, then I apologize and you can ignore this gripe).

Also, this is not aimed at these specific devs or designers, but just this genre in general. I'd like more masc-women. And more prettyboy men. Give us a butch-lady with short cropped hair and a smirk and a pretty-boy without facial hair. And anybody who says Benjamin looks like he has a ponytail in his sprite -- it's not obvious in his portrait, and he's not a prettyboy so it's a moot point. Something something Gabriel.

OKAY. All that aside, I still think this is a great game. And honestly if my biggest issue is the lack of pretty boys, they aren't doing a bad job. I will definitely continue to play regardless, and I think if you enjoy Harvest Moon/SoS/Stardew you will enjoy this game. :)",1622484984,1622485100,True,0,0,0.455228567123413086,0,True,False,True,False,,1622595510.0,Everyone within reasonable age is going to be romanceable eventually.

It's enough like Stardew Valley that it could be its sequel, so I'd say that makes it a solid addition to my farm sim library. I am really enjoying it and look forward to more updates.

It also has features that make gameplay easier and more forgiving than Stardew Valley:

A pillow tool that you can use to take a nap anywhere and replenish your stamina - in-game clock speeds up to simulate the fast passing of time, making this tool also useful for when you are waiting for a particular business to open their doors. When you DO run out of stamina you will take an immediate and automatic nap. Also if you stay up very late you will just have less energy the next day to start off with. 

I also like how you have a separate toolbar for your tools and items, so you can never lose or misplace your tools since they are permanently attached to you (except for when you take them in for an upgrade at the blacksmith's, of course). 

I also love how if you reach the last bit of your stamina your farmer will very noticeably have a dizzy moment. Playing Stardew Valley I remember being so into gameplay that I wouldn't even notice the critical stamina warning sometimes until it was too late.

The game also enables the easy moving of buildings. So if you don't like where you put a barn/coop you can move it without hassle or having to pay any fees to have it moved.

Another great feature is that if you feel like you need a break from caring for all your animals you don't have to sell them, but can have the vet take care of them for free until you want them back - you just don't get any of their produce during that time (eggs, milk, wool, etc).

On a more personal note I also think that there are more villager characters I find likeable/interesting in Orange Season than in Stardew Valley. There was just something about the Stardew Valley characters that made them feel mostly more bland and uninteresting. So I'm grateful that these characters seem to have a more standout quality to them.

Features I would like to see added and bugs I would like to see fixed:

I'd like to be able to transfer animals to the coop/barn of my choosing via a roster in the coops/barns.

I'd like it if a character actually tells you that you have to use the hoe to find stairs to levels where the silver and gold ore are since it was some time into the game before I read the sign via a click and was like ""Ohhhh, so that's where you get those.""

I'd like to see a headlamp tool added for use in the night when the mine gets dark and its harder to make out which ore is which.

The items bar shows the number 2 when I really have 10.

I can't access Cindy's furniture for sale after she gives me the opportunity that one time to buy some (and I did). I think it's a bug.

I have experienced some wonkiness with doorways occasionally where the 'inside now' doesn't trigger and I have to go out and go back in (happens when I try to enter just as an NPC is). I also had a similar experience when I was 'hanging out' and tried to go into the spa.

Occasionally the game will freeze when I try to go to the festival area on a festival day (maybe it's because I was on horseback?).

Since the horse will wander a bit like a real horse likely would after you dismount, I would like the see the addition of hitching posts in some convenient and commonly frequented spots.",1620748294,1620929352,True,4,0,0.562932610511779785,0,True,False,True,False,,,

  O que falar sobre Orange Season?! Se você jogou e gostou de stardew valley ou harvest moon, esse jogo é pra você. O jogo contem mecânicas simples de comprar sementes, planta-las, regar elas todo dia, coletar e vender. Além disso você pode explorar todo o mapa para coletar itens, desde as montanhas até a PRAIA.
  
  O jogo também contém uma mecânica de mineração em andares, igual a de stardew valley(Orange Season se baseou muito nesse jogo).

  Os NPCs são incríveis, cada um com sua característica e persoalidade, parece que são pessoas reais mesmo. Esse foi um dos únicos jogos que me fez sentir dentro dele. O jogo contém sistema de amizade e de namoro, e futuramente casameto.

  Em relação aos bugs, nunca vi nenhum. 
  
  UM AVISO NO JOGO: se você tiver comprado alguma coisa na loja e você tiver com seu inventario cheio, o vendedor não vai roubar seu item, ele vai colocar na sua caixa de correio :)

I played for little bit and i love the game already, really. So much potential and fun already. I do not write reviews after 1.4 hour of playing every day but Orange Season has something spectacular i really adore. Which are the characters, when in first impression the character gives me joy, im hooked and need to play more. It's really rare that game gives me excitement. there is only few farming RPG games which have very nice written characters! 


Secondly i really like the art style/graphic. Developer really did chose nice art style and so on. I can see how the way is going to be in development and i really really like it. If you like games like Stardew Valley or either Harvest Moon. This one is for you seriously. Just please keep in the mind it is still in early access and many features are going to be still implented. So do not give negative review because it has time to time some bug, instead of that go to Developer's discord and report that bugs or ideas how to improve the game. And i can tell you developers does listen. 

And for these amazing modders, the game will have also Mod Support soon. :) all the parts of the game are moded-able.


[b] Pros: [/b]
+ Many variety of the crops
+ Amazing Characters 
+ Living Town
+ Cut Scenes 
+ Story 
+ Farming 
+ Animals 
+ Mining 
+ Farm is upgrade-able 

[b] Cons: [/b]

- Lacking Farm Customization (Should be in the next updates)
- Lack of hairstyles / clothes customization 
- Lack of music (Only 2 songs i did count so far...) 
- Lack of decorating interior of the house (Should be in next updates hopefully) 

I will change review after each update, so check out after each. 

[b] Conclusion: [/b]
I really recommend buying this game already, if you would like to support Developers which are responding for ideas, feedback or bug reports. They really do fix bugs asap. I never saw that quick care before. 

Im giving 8,5/10 for now. And if all the feedback and updates will have the content what is promise i will for sure go higher. Also i will be doing soon videos on my Channel, considering doing Let's Play.

There are some quests that you can't even complete because the game mechanics are bad. For instance the Mayor gives you a quest to clear all the weeds from the town but it seems like a LOT of people have issues finding the last weed, and that is because it is mysteriously hidden behind a tree or a house and the locations are completely random on where they pop up. It wouldn't be such a big deal if the larger objects that you walk behind like trees would become semi transparent when you walk behind them so you can actually see what is behind them, rather than just randomly running around clicking behind things hoping that you MIGHT find it. That is just a bad and poorly thought out game mechanic and since there are several threads that are kind of old and it still hasn't been addressed by the devs, tells me that they really don't care about addressing bad game mechanics in their game.

The rest of the game mechanics such as the point and click finger are also very clunky and just feels wrong, you basically use it for everything in the game.  The map provided that you can use is not very accurate, the crafting menu is horrible and almost non existent, You can have chickens and eggs, but  you can't make items from the eggs, unless you go into town and use a camp fire, despite the fact that you have a house with a storage system. You can apparently race your chickens though which is just weird. Bottom line is if you are looking for a game similar to Stardew Valley, don't get this one. While it seems like almost a complete rip off of Stardew, it failed on so many levels that could have made it a decent and cute game.
My suggestion to the devs of this game, is to please work on your games mechanics and how the players interact with quests and other things in their world such as their farm. As the game stands it feels more like a free Facebook farming game rather than an actual farming simulator like it is trying to be. Also maybe listen to the feedback of the people who are trying to play the game? If you ignore the very base of the people you are trying to get to play this game, then your game won't get very far.",1614806366,1616879948,False,7,2,0.576923072338104248,2,True,False,True,False,,,

TL;DR Fun and chill game where you occasionally get to race chickens or throw tomatoes at the townspeople.

A peaceful and delightful farming sim that offers a similar experience to other games but also much unique content.  In particular the inventory system is really functional and well designed.  The character development gets going after a while and the town's stories become increasingly entangled.   Also you can rest or save the game whenever you want and there is an NPC who babysits your animals if you're bored of taking care of them.  There are many fun festivals with a Brazilian cultural theme.  As well there is at least some diversity in the characters, much more so than in Stardew Valley.   The music is pleasing and overall atmosphere is simple, bright and colorful.  If you buy things when your inventory is full they get sent to your mailbox, which is convenient.  There probably isn't hundreds of hours of content but there is more than enough to justify the low asking price.  New updates are still being added and it is clear that player feedback is taken strongly into consideration.",1602219988,1708300453,True,8,0,0.593053221702575684,0,True,False,True,False,,,

But again, it pays to really explore your field and forest before really diving into the game itself. Ore, sadly isn't a really profitable way to make money. Your best bet is to like I said, go til the land in the forest and around town and plant as many flowers as your stamina will allow. From there, plant, plant plant!! Keep on planting.

Progression is sometimes a little vague, some of the essential tools are hidden in the most distant places. I prefer a system in which you can decide your own profession, but here, to get the fishing rod you have to cozy up to (bribe, befriend) a guy first. Upgrading your tools is vague, because the option suddenly appears. I would prefer this to be clear. But those are tiny things to complain about. 

It has the best inventory management system I have come across, because the game does it for you. You don't have to build storage at all, which is a smart decision, no one likes to organize their stuff. I really appreciate this. 

There are two health bars that act fairly similarly, I suppose since they have a doctor, at some point illnesses come into the game. I think one would have done just as well.

The reason why this is a negative review: My computer crashed on me and then my only save file was lost. So 6 hrs of progress gone. I have no problem managing my own saves, if I have reason to believe that stuff like that can happen, but I wasn't expecting this. Maybe putting a warning note in the game would help people to create several safe files.

If they solve this, this is a great game, I would wait for them to solve these issues first though. I am not going to start another run just yet. Maybe later.",1595663186,1595663186,False,6,1,0.475001007318496704,1,True,False,True,False,,,

While the game is actually very fun I think the only thing it truly suffers from is a lack of a goal?

But as far as plot in the storyline I cannot see any real goals other than win all the festival contest to show off your farm which does not really feel like a concrete goal? especially seeing as some of the contest have nothing to do with farming.

English Version:
I began playing Orange Season illegally, after few month I had enough money to buy it and give some money to the one creating this game!! The game is'nt finished today but is playable for a year ingame for now! This game is in the same family as Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, obviously with some differences. 
My favorite part of Orange Season is that you have to work with all your tool to improve it : you can't just neglect chopping stump and log and buy the best axe later when you're rich, each tool has an experience bar which has to be maxed to allow the upgrade!! 
Foraging is your best source of money early game, you will spend most of your time walking and searching fruits to earn some $$. I ended thinking about every possible path to choose which one is the more efficient. No violence and fight, no monster to kill when you're mining, it's a very peaceful game!
The game is updated regularly, and most bugs are fixed few days after update.

FR: J'ai commencé à jouer à Orange Season en version crackée, mais j'ai pu l'acheter quelques mois après quand j'ai eu assez d'argent, et je regrette pas de soutenir le jeu et les personnes qui bossent dessus :D
Le jeu est clairement dans la même lignée que Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper... Avec évidemment quelques différences!
Dans Orange Season, vous êtes obligé d'utiliser tous vos outils si vous voulez les upgrader, pas moyen d'économiser et d'acheter la meilleure hache, chaque outil a une barre d'XP que vous devez maxer si vous voulez acheter l'amélioration, perso c'est une contrainte que j'adore . 
Le glanage/ramassage d'items occupe la majorité de vos journées, surtout en début de partie, ce qui permet d'optimiser et de trouver le meilleur chemin pour un ratio items/temps optimal! 
Zero violence dans ce jeu: pas de combat, pas de monstres à tuer pendant que vous minez!
Le jeu est mis à jour régulièrement (quelques mois), et la majorité des bugs corrigés en moins d'une semaine après la MAJ.",1593693282,1593693282,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,True,False,,,

There's a severe lack of guides and information on some of the game's aspects but the Developer and the small but loyal community are quick to respond to players' inquiries which is nice to see. There's also a lot of carry-over knowledge for people like me who have played a lot of farming games.

Hopefully new art gets put into the game soon. The lack of portraits on some characters is a bit disorienting and ruins the immersion. 

Music is great and simple. Art style is nice and pleasing. Story is there but needs to be expounded on. The dating aspect is also begging to be updated as, from what the Wiki provides, each candidate only has one romantic heart-event. 

Anyway, so far I love this game a lot. It reminds me of some of Harvest Moon's old games in that it's simple, grindy, but also satisfying and addictive. 

I've played some SDV and the 3DS Story of Seasons games, and for what it's worth, Orange Season has some aspects to it that it does better than both franchises. It has a wild animal taming system much like the 3DS Story of Season games but you can take the animals back to your farm eventually which is exciting and new. It's mining is a lot more interactive than the 'hit here to collect' mining in Story of Seasons games, but it's also not as complex as Stardew Valley's as there is no combat in the game. 

Some things I wish would get added in the future:
1. More and better heart events akin to HM/SOS games where each stage of the heart progress unlocks and event.
2. Guides. I had to do a lot of discussion-digging here on Steam to find some things out for myself. I also quickly learned that some features didn't make it through the updates and were then obsolete which made it even more frustrating.
3. As I said, I'd really like for more art to be in-game. It'd be nice for the portraits to have different emotive versions to fit the dialogues. 
4. More domesticated animals. I really like the concept of breeding chickens until you get the perfect one, I just wish that the other animals get their chance to shine too as right now, they don't offer much interaction.
5. Quality meter on both crops and produce. The seed-maker is really 'meh'. In the farming games of recent, it's mainly used as a way to pass crop quality down until you get the perfect crop; without the quality meter on crops, it's really just for a little price discount. I'd also like to see a quality system on milk and eggs as at the moment, I don't think befriending your animals does much if anything at all. 

The Developer seems to be really hard-working and I wish them all the best. This game has a bright future and could be amazing; but for now, it's just good.",1591363584,1591363584,True,4,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The new company spent from December 2021 to December 2022 to do a single update, porting this to another engine, only for the game to be unplayable. Not just a few annoying bugs, the game right now it's a really bad demo.

Every character has a different storyline to follow and their comments change almost every day which keeps things really interesting. You can also ""hang out"" with characters and compete with them during festivals which is so much fun! The map in this game is huge and allows for tons of exploration. There are many ""secret places"" hidden around and they take a long time to find, so you'll never be bored! Another thing I love about this game is the variety of animals offered to purchase. You can get the normal cows, chicken, and horse, but you also can get ducks, yacks, and mountain goats. You can also ride your cow, yacks, and mountain goats in addition to your horse which is awesome! The farming in this game is equal to that of STV and there is mining and fishing. 

Overall, I LOVE this game and can't wait to see how it continues to progress.

Ok, eu estava 1000% hypada pra esse jogo, já que ele estava sendo completamente refeito em uma nova engine com promessas de novas mecânicas e várias melhorias (A antiga engine era o RPG Maker, que limita muito o desenvolvedor que queira fazer algo diferente de um j-rpg classicão).

O novo mapa é realmente lindo, mas está com milhares de erros de mapeamento e eu estou esperando abrirem uma thread de bugs pra postar tudo lá. De resto honestamente pra mim ficou pior, o que é uma pena, por que eu [b]realmente[/b] estava animada com essa atualização. 
Deixa eu listar algumas coisas:

🔹 Nós já sabíamos que a história seria toda refeita, mas essa nova versão [b]não possui sequer a introdução[/b]. Ou não possui, ou tem algum problema sério com a configuração de intro na tela de criação de personagem;
🔹 Simples animações de caminhar dos personagens muitas vezes não funcionam e o jogador se depara com [b]npcs deslizando pela rua[/b];
🔹 Transições de um mapa pra outro levam o jogador pra locais que não tem nada a ver (como entrar no galinheiro e aparecer na entrada da fazenda, por exemplo).
🔹 Erros de mapeamento que permitem que o jogador atravesse objetos que deviam ser sólidos e várias paredes invisíveis que não fazem sentido.
🔹 Se você tem um gamepad tem uma grande chance de que ele não funcione mais, assim como foi comigo e vários outros usuários (eu resolvi isso com um emulador de gamepad);
🔹 Consegui usar o botão de ação pra abrir um diálogo com um npc, mas só dá pra fechar com o botão configurado em ""voltar"" e não com o próprio botão de ação como antes;
🔹 Tudo parece estar pesadamente voltado pra jogar com teclado e mouse, a questão de acessibilidade e ""qualidade de vida"" está péssima.

Assim que eu soube que trocaram de engine pra Unity eu fiquei com sentimentos mistos. A Unity é definitivamente uma das engines líderes de mercado, mas em compensação o ambiente 2d dela é falso, não passa de um ambiente 3d simulando 2d. Eu aposto que na Godot Engine os desenvolvedores teriam conseguido fazer [b]muito mais[/b] nessa mesma quantidade de tempo, mas deixa isso quieto por que cada um usa a engine que quiser e eu não tenho nada a ver com isso hahaha.

Enfim, [b]Orange Season[/b], não fica triste, eu ainda te amo e vou sempre te dar uma chance, mas isso foi uma baita quebra de expectativa. Ainda assim vou continuar acompanhando o desenvolvimento e torcendo pra que os devs cheguem no ponto que eles planejaram pra esse jogo. Sigam firmes. 💪

[i]Análise original em 14/02/2020:[/i]

Vou tentar ser justa por ser um título em Early Access! Eu gostei do jogo, os gráficos melhoraram muito com o passar do tempo e já deu pra ver um avanço comparando a demo com a versão atual. O menu com o caderno me deixou apaixonada, fiquei um tempão abrindo e fechando ele só pra ver aquela animação linda hahaha. Os NPCs têm sua personalidade, só ainda não foi tanto explorada quanto poderia, mas, acima de tudo, o que eu mais senti falta foi de um objetivo grandioso principal. Algo acima dos pequenos objetivos e que eu precisaria de uns dois anos pra alcançar, tipo o que temos em HM: The tale of two towns ou outros do mesmo gênero. O Monomito é uma excelente referência de estrutura para criação de histórias, humildemente recomendo. No mais, estou acompanhando o trabalho de vocês devs e ansiosa pra ver o que mais vocês trarão ao jogo!",1581712901,1670026072,True,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True,False,,,

O jogo se trata de um game sobre administração de uma fazenda, no mesmo Pick de Harvest Moon.
Nosso protagonista pode ser modificado(Poucas Modificações entre cor de pele e etc).
Escolhemos nosso nick dentro do game, o nome do nosso cachorro e o nome da nossa fazenda. 
O Jogo a principio de Game é muito divertido, pelo fato de sempre estarmos procurando lugares novos, npc e etc.
Uma coisa que eu gostei muito desse ínicio é que o game não te entrega logo as ferramentas de cara(Procura não pra vc ver se te dão dicas kkk)
O Mapa é GIGANTE , eu dificilmente conseguia fazer tudo a pé, depois que comprei um cavalo consegui me locomover mais rapido!!
Sistema de plantação é muito bom(Uma coisa que nunca vi em algum game é que o cachorro faz xixi em algumas plantas e elas ficam como se fossem regadas... isso é uma coisa que me deixou maravilhado)
Temos update nas ferramentas principais do game. Sendo feita no ferreiro da cidade. Temos update de Cobre,Prata e Ouro por enquanto(No regador é diferente. O primeiro Update é prata, Rubi e esmeralda).

Uma coisa que me deixou meio triste foi a falta de eventos. Temos um no primeiro mês e 1 no segundo... Parando por ai. Outono e Inverno não existem eventos (Creio que ao passar das atualizações, irão adicionar).

O Jogo tem muita pegada e referência ao Brasil, como o Saci, ou o Curupira(Tendo quest com ele)
Me alegra o coração do jogo ter sido feito inicialmente por um Brasileiro, isso demonstra que tambem podemos entrar nesse mercado de games.

Os Npc's do game são muito fofos. Cada um com sua personalidades únicas ,cada um tem seus problemas e histórias.

O jogo está muito bom para a fase de desenvolvimento que está, mas como nem tudo é perfeito, eu vou listar algumas coisas que não curti muito.


Estou no inverno do Primeiro Ano, e o jogo meio que está se tornando enjoativo, já que estou a 1 semana com 40000 mil de gold sem ter noção com oque gastar. Já tenho a maioria dos updates e é isso.

Chega uma hora que fica muito repetitivo ter que fazer a rota da montanha todo dia pra pegar loot. 

Não sei se precisa liberar algo , mas só consegui fazer 1 update da casa, pelo fato do npc falar que não pode fazer mais updates.

A Pesca é Legal, com uma proposta bacana e diferentes de outros jogos semelhantes. Mas chega a ser enjoativo. Precisamos está esperando o peixe passar por cima da isca, e isso torna meio repetitivo saca, sem nenhum desafio . talvez uma dificuldade com uma recompensa melhor seria o ideal.

Até então não temos estruturas alem de uma celeiro e um galinheiro. Quando compramos do Raphael , parece que aquilo já esta no update max, ja que é gigante o tamanho e a quantidades de animais que cabem em cada celeiro/Galinheiro.

Muitos animais nas lojas ficam ofuscados, já que o Pato não tem descrição,assim como o Bode da montanha,Iaque e etc. Fica vago .

Conseguimos semi-automatizar a plantação, já que tem irrigador e etc, mas não consegui fazer isso com os animais , então meio que a partir de um momento , animais só servem para fazer produtos para alimentação do jogador ou presentes para npc, não arrumei um modo de fazer um ""Lucro Real"" com os animais. 

O Jogo tem MUITO a melhorar, e sendo meu gênero de jogo favorito e fico ansioso pelas atualizações.

I love those types of games but once you make your fifth farm... well, there is only so much to do, isn't there? 
So, when I saw this game for sale at a modest price and good reviews, I decided to give it a shot. Am I happy? Yes. Could I be happier? Yes. 
The thing is, this game is still in development and you can tell. Pictures on NPCs don't show up on the text boxes, sometimes the FPS drops down to ""is the game about to die"" (fixed by a quick reboot of the game), and other little things. But, I am okay playing am game with those things happening as long as I think it is worth it. And, in this case, I do.
I have to assume one or both of two things is true: 1) the developer is a longtime player of games in this genre 2) the developer has been reading through complaints and wishes for other games in this genre. Why do I think that? Well, here are a couple examples:
a) When I went to buy seeds (which, as far as I can tell, you can buy on any day), I was given the information about the seed and plants whenever I had them selected. How much they cost, how much they sell for, how long they grow, how many days in-between growths. All right there. How many times have I wished for that info at that moment in other games??? It was awesome. 
b) The map shows people WHERE THEY ARE. Not where they live. Where they are at that moment. Trying to hunt someone down? Never fear! If you can recognize their little face, you can stalk them. [side note: a legend of who is who would be great because I have a hard time with real human faces, not to mention little animated ones]
c) YOU can MOVE BUILDINGS. I am a bit of a designer, and so moving buildings is a big deal to me. I don't even have to wander, for example *coughcough*, up into the mountains and use an NPC to do it only to realize that there is a piece of plowed land in the way. 
d) For me, it really harkens back to the good-old memories of a certain GameBoy Advance game. A little grindy, a little gritty, but still an adventure. 
So, would I buy it again? Yes. Do I want to see changes? Yes. Should you buy it? If you are willing to say ""ah yeah, I guess that feature isn't ready yet but OMG look at my crops and chickies!!!""

Things that might make things better:
Character Clothes Customization (ie: pants for the ladies - who farms in a skirt?)
Instead of ""pet"" name, maybe just go ahead and say dog?
Transparent Trees (would like to see what is behind those dang things)

[i]Fantasy Farming: Orange Season[/i] is an indie farming-simulation RPG much in the same spirit of the [i]Harvest Moon[/i] games and also [i]Stardew Valley.[/i] Similarities would certainly group these games together in many of the same categories of comparison, whereas the differences would allow the player to enjoy each for its own game.

Similar in style, art direction, and gameplay, these games all offer a start-up farm after a quick introductory story. I haven't played [i]Harvest Moon[/i] Since the Wii and it's been about 2 years since I fiddled around in [i]Stardew Valley,[/i] so my recollection of those games are only from memory. Thus I am not going to be offering any kind of significant comparison, but rather talk about this game alone. In addition, Please keep in mind that 8 hours is a really (and I mean, reeeeally) short time period to offer proper judgement of a game of this type, so this is a mere first-impressions review.

[h1]Gameplay/Game Content[/h1]
So you want to know what you can do in this game? To lay it out in numbers, there are 25 other people to meet and to interact with in town, 14 different types of animals to own, 43 areas to explore (the buildings in town all count separately), 50 cooking recipes, 271 different items you can ship to sell, and currently 25 available tasks as of right now in Early Access. The recipes list is being developed and you cannot look at it from your menu yet. And I believe that there will be significant addenda to the actual tasks/quests, because 25 really seems like a fairly low number. (Although depending on how long you are planning to spend playing the game, I have completed 9/25 tasks so far in my time playing.)

As expected, you are going to be cleaning off areas of your farm, farming vegetables, fruits, etc. You will have to take good care to water your plants otherwise you will lose part of your crop. Before your first crops are harvested, you can explore around the local areas to forage for items to sell, so that you are able to make some money. Exploring also opens your own abilities because several of the essential farming tools are only found scattered around the map, and having them would mean the ability to gradually improve your own farming methods.

This game has plenty of fruit trees that will ripen allowing you to pick the fruits right off of them when you can see the fruit. The Orange Season subtitle of the game is no joke, as it seems that oranges are always in season, whereas other fruits will come and go depending on the seasons themselves. You will also often find random fruits and other valuables littering the local nature scape, so you can be pretty sure that you will never go hungry--even though hunger is not a problem for the protagonist in this game. It is for your animals, but all you ever need is sleep. Eating foods will remove your fatigue and restore stamina, but you can also do that just by hitting your pillow anywhere, any time.

Raising animals can be a big part of your farming instead of the traditional style of tilling land, sowing seeds, and watering them until fruition. You can raise chickens, ducks, cows, etc. You can use them as renewable resources and sell the eggs, milk, etc. that are produced. How you ultimately run your farm is up to you, although the game will definitely give you plenty of tasks to keep you more or less having the capability of maintain all styles of farming available within. A point of note is that the hens need a rooster in order to lay viable eggs for hatching. So getting that rooster is going to be important, lest you wish to keep paying $1000 gold for each little chicklet that you purchase. (I have raised 3 chickens from baby chicks so far, all of them egg-laying female. I have no idea if you can get lucky and buy a chick that turns into a rooster. I will probably keep trying, because the rooster was too pricey the first (and only) opportunity I had seen it come on sale.)

Or should you wish, you can opt for a more adventurous career and still maintain a flower garden. The flowers don't need much care, and AFAIK, they will just grow on their own once the seeds are sown. All you need to do is look at them until they are ready to harvest. Flowers can certainly generate a decent income if you have a steady supply of them to sell.

Live as a hermit or social butterfly, or just an animal lover and a people hater? I suppose all of these options are available. And you can practically gift anything to anyone, though if you are looking through your inventory in the pause menu, it does tell you if people will dislike an item. After all, it's right around Christmas time right now, who would want a lump of coal? Building up a relationship takes plenty of time, as the game's relationship hearts look almost infinite wells that will only slowly build up with lots of interactions and plenty of gifts.

When you have enough money and resources through your hard work and scavenging, you will be able to expand your house and fence things inside. I do wish you can just pick up and rearrange your fencing, because I kind of made a couple of mistakes in creating the fence around my chicken coop, and now it looks like a cat walked over my keyboard when I was putting it together. Hmm... That's my story and I will stick to it!

The different seasons will bring different items to plant or find. You will be able to attend the various festivals that occur to participate in the mini-games that are built in in hopes of winning a special prize or two. 

Overall there's just a lot of stuff to do, and so far 8 hours in, I am just scratching at the surface.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
I am playing with a controller, it plays decently well with one. I think there are definitely times when I think a mouse pointer would make things a little smoother, but I prefer the controller here. KB+M of course work perfectly as well.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Pixel-art farming pleasantries. The whole game code is available for people to freely modify it with whatever custom designs should that be a desire.

[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]
Nothing spectactular, not bad. Mostly just background stuff that you can opt to ignore. I think the dog barks a little too loud, but that's just me probably.

[h1]Audience[/h1]
I think taking one glance at this game, if you have played other similar games, would tell you whether you are the targeted audience.

[h1]Pricing[/h1]
Base price of $13.99 is fair in its Early Access state right now. The price may increase with more content. Currently the Winter Sale price at 30% off is pretty good, in my opinion.

[h1]First-Look Video[/h1]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Fantasy Farming: Orange Season[/i] will offer you plenty of hours of farming simulation goodness with its variety of adaptive styles to the farming idea in that as long as you make money you can keep moving forward with making things bigger and better for yourself. This is clearly a game not for everyone, just like some people think that these farming-sim/RPG style games are just too tedious and too much like real work. To me, I think it's really nice from time to time to sit down with a casual and relaxing game, more or less thoughtless and effortless...

Umm... What do you mean I sat around thoughtless for too long! Wait, did I lose a whole crop of cabbages when I typed this review? NOOOOoooooooo!!!!!

[b]Expanda sua fazenda, crie animais e cultive frutos. Seja um bom vizinho, busque um romance, pesque a semana inteira ou ganhe troféus em competições. Aqui você decide o seu futuro.[/b]

Em Fantasy Farming: Orange Season, você é um jovem adulto que sai da casa de seus pais para realizar seu maior sonho: tornar-se um fazendeiro, ou seja, possuir a sua própria terra e viver dos frutos do seu suor.

O primeiro passo para começar nossa aventura está na criação do seu personagem. A customização em si não é muito complexa, pode-se escolher seu gênero, a cor da pele e do cabelo, bem como o seu nome, o nome da sua fazenda e de seu animal de estimação. 

Após a criação de personagem, uma cutscene contando um pouco da história é revelada. Basicamente, com a ajuda de seus pais, você compra o seu primeiro pedaço de terra numa pequena cidade chamada Laranjal. Ao mudar-se, é recebido pela prefeita Julia, que encaminha-o até sua fazenda. Benjamin, o vaqueiro da cidade, dá as boas-vindas com um livro contendo informações básicas para fazendeiros que nada mais é do que um tutorial sobre as mecânicas básicas do jogo.

Com um grande foco em exploração, o título possui diversas áreas desenhadas a mão para conhecer, como: montanhas, lagos, florestas, cavernas e muito mais. O cultivo de produtos em determinada estação do ano, a criação de animais de grande e pequeno porte e a expansão e personalização da sua própria fazenda também são elementos fascinantes de Orange Season.

Contendo mais de 35 tipos de frutas, vegetais e flores, 10 tipos de animais diferentes e inúmeros itens disponíveis, o título cumpre o seu objetivo em evidenciar a vida na fazenda. 

Mas não se engane, é notável que o game não se trata apenas de cuidar da sua fazenda, ele também foca muito no conceito da amizade com a vizinhança. Ao conversar diariamente e cumprir tarefas para seus vizinhos, você obtém pontos de amizade que, conforme aumentam, possibilitam a opção para eventuais romances.

While the game is still in early access with much more content to come I feel it is already well worth the asking price.

The game offers the usual farming fair we have all come to know and love but what really shines for me is character dialogue. Amazingly, your player character actively takes part in some conversations and cutscenes, and this simple interaction made you feel like your character actually had a soul. Besides that, I felt the townsfolk were all very likable and felt alive compared to the somewhat stale dialogue these sorts of games can fall victim to.  

The only real negative I can think to add was a somewhat less than ideal framerate at times. This combined with the interface could feel a little clunky and slow at times. But this was by no means game-breaking for me. Orange Season hooked me instantly to the tune of 17+ hours at the time of this writing. With many more to come with new updates, I'm sure!

Having the crops being in correct seasons is great, romance is working in progress which is going in the right direction. The characters are well written and though some of the characters piss me off, that's just how their personality is.

I am not rating it a no because of it being in beta, and yet I am. 
So hear me out, I'm gonna give my pros and then cons and one major con at the end. I will say if you are reading this before purchasing, do not purchase at full price, and I highly suggest taking the price down a notch or two. 

Pros:
I love graphics like this, little indie, little cute, feels like SNES. I do not believe every game needs to be super high tech. 
The animal variety in this game is astonishing thus far, I hope they add more, along with other things to pour your money into.
This games 'mapping' is very big, in my opinion, there is some maze I have yet to even go explore, but only because I heard it was changing constantly because they couldn't decide what to do with the magic forest.
There is some 'strange' creatures in here, I'd love to see more. 
This game has loads of potential for dialogue and adventure if they ever fill it in, but they seem to be focused on surroundings and tools for now. 
Animals have variety of colors and if it pleases you, you may own more than one horse. 
All animals seem to have stats or it's just chickens. I'm not too sure. 
The gathering aspect for chump change is easier than most games, the items on the ground or in the bush is very noticeable, letting you know like ""ay psst, want a penny come over here, lass."" 
Want to get rich? Fish for the big fishhhh, I just banked off fishing alone and certain crops. 
This game also seems like its going to have cooking, like most other farming games, but the different items to do it with seem exciting thus far.
Naps are good I guess. It's an interesting feature. Brings back stamina and you can nap anywhere. 


Cons: 
Character customization could be really good in this game, maybe even outfits.
When you are on a horse, for some reason running side to side from the screen is faster than going forward or down. I don't know why, me and friends cackled at it when we first noticed.
All npcs are lacking conversation or even development thus far, which is okay, it is still in Beta. 
Animal resource gathering to get it in the bin for the morning is pretty hard, you will most likely either have to choose between gathering crops or stuff from your animal to beat the bin gathering lad. I've never been able to get both, which is okay, but a little weird.
I think the time goes to fast in the game, personally, as stated above, rather pretty quickly the lad comes to get the items from the bin. 
Stamina is way to costly, it makes me not want to do anything besides plant and animals, who cares about upgrades. I'll be rich and happy in my small house at this point. And I get you can nap, but time already goes by so quickly that napping is almost irrelevant to me not unless I run out of stamina before I get home, then I make sure to get back to the second bar and take off. 
Tools were weird, I'm making this a con because I had to google where some of them were. Because, I understand some things need to be found or given, but jeez. 
There is no map.  <--  I want to take it back, there is one it's in the corner up at the very top instead of the menu with other things.
Map for the mines?  Maybe you can earn one later, but they just changed recently along with a several holes being sealed off so, I guess not.
I started playing when you were an allowed a teleport from a witch, and I thought it was SO WICKED, they gave that so early, and it was only helpful with getting home or in town, it wasn't overpowered in my opinion. But they took that way, I was shocked. Because it was such an interesting opening to get that from a witch instantly, a nice witch. So let me compare this to something else, in Stardew Valley the wizard felt like a b**** to befriend and get stuff from and very many other games that involve a 'magical person' are the same way. So I was excited the first one I saw gave me something. 
It's really hard to find npcs and some just lock themselves up in their house. There is something to the north that I just stopped trying to get into or talk to, she just opens the door and in my world (imagination here) sticks out her tongue and shuts it. 
This game is constantly undergoing changes that affect what you already know what to do or how to strive. 

Before my big con, I'd like to say that I wish the social aspect of the game was worked on more rather than the mapping, like forests, mines, lakes, etc. That would at least distract me better to attempt to keep playing it rather than dropping it when something drastically goes array or I get bored because well, stamina problems I have money, but not worth chopping up so much wood to achieve whatever the builder can build.

Major Con, from my end:

I waited about a whole year to buy this game, hoping that the major updates would've already been pressed through. Especially since Stardew Valley lost it's wind after the major fall out they had and now only the creator works on PC, and so far it's only promotions of mods rather than updates. So when I bought this game, I still knew it was in Beta, I just had hoped it would've been developed far long enough that I didn't have to endure 'major' changes that friends warned me might happen in Beta games like this. ( I love farming/social games.) So far I achieved a bunch on my first couple of days along with making loads of money, I still have a ton of money, and I'm still in year one and fall, with my first debt paid off, and I haven't bought extra land (probably will not for a while.)  And the layout of the world is kind of complicated, as there isn't really a map. You kind of have to learn as you go, and that's fine, what isn't fine is areas are constantly changing now. I got used to the mines (took forever) and you need to get 'blue crystals' and the most recent update has taken one mine away and has made what seems to be an elaborate new one from the old one (there was two at one point.) I have no idea where the shroom people are, and I don't care really much to hunt them down at this point. I feel like a lot of hard work to memory was like wiped to a game that should be simple in most aspects. Then because I am in fall, upon the update I received several letters for summer for quests, and that just..really grinds my gears. So the updates when it comes to the world, is kind of hectic, and then put on top of the lack of details quests give, the lack of details with villagers, and other things.  And it makes me not want to play it, I'm not expecting it to be Stardew or Harvest, but I expected the world to be somewhat mostly solid rather than constantly changing. 

Like I said, this probably will change once it finishes. If not I'm terribly sorry for downing such a game that has great potential that it might not ever achieve.",1567936918,1567940108,False,17,0,0.620658516883850098,8,False,False,True,False,,,

The diversity and character development is impressive and still evolving. With only 23.8 hours, I am still within the first year and can already see how much freedom and choice there is to be made! New areas unfold through mazes and puzzles; some of which harder than others. You actually have to watch your energy and manage your time. It isn't like SDV where you have to make it to bed by a certain hour, you can stay up days on end exploring or working granted that you have enough food on hand. You can save at any point in the game which is a plus, so that you may pick up wherever you left off in the caves or in the forest.

The most profound thing I have noticed that separates the game apart from other farming RPGs is the dialogue and the background stories of characters as they unfold. Their problems, disputes between other characters, and attitudes feel very real. They have depth to them that are charming. I think that's the most interesting part, seeing what the characters think of each other. 

I also enjoy the idea that you can manipulate who ends up with who, or compete in different relationships. This game is very promising and a wonderful collection to your library!

I haven't played a lot so maybe this changes as you become better friends with people but I dislike the fact that you can't enter people's houses when they're home.

I have enjoyed the game quite a bit, of course the game is still in development and has ways to go but i for sure can see the potential here and as a person who has been playing farming games since the first HM it is quite an appealing game. 



There are ofc things that I would like to see in the future which I am sure the team behind the game are working hard on such as 



More festivals, Dating or just more day-to-day things etc.



Things I love about the game so far :



- Music is pretty cute 

- The layout of the farm, mountain, village are all pretty good and easy to get around.

- The different animals available is good.

- The seeds available and the farming system it's self is good and simple enough.

- The fishing is pretty neat nice and easy! 

- The foraging items are sweet! Quite a lot of them around which is nice.



Things I don't like so much at this present time: 



The amount of stamina used when using tools even when they have been upgraded I think still uses too much, after clearing a few rocks or branches my stamina is pretty much gone and the amount of stamina available from the foraging items does not really make up for it. I find myself out of stamina really quickly and just going to bed. (hope this can be reduced in the future) :)



- Finding the Big Blue Crystal for the mining quest was super annoying took me almost a month for me to get one even going mining for it everyday, Maybe you can increase the chance of finding one a bit :p 



- There isn't really much to do on a day-to-day basis after attending the farm, animals foraging items around. 

So I normally just go the bed early. 



These are just some of my likes/dislikes of course not everyone will feel the same and I am in no way bashing the game or anything, I do enjoy playing the game considering it is still in development. 



I would give the game 7/10 as it is now :)",1558542968,1558543085,True,2,0,0.490813672542572021,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Ich liebe Farmspiele wie Harvest Moon oder auch Stardew Valley, und so musste ich dieses Spiel einfach testen. Besonders das Versprechen eines innovativen Beziehungssystems, bei dem die Dorfbewohner auch untereinander Paare bilden können (was man beeinflussen kann) fand ich sehr anziehend.

Die Story und das Gameplay sind schnell zusammengefasst: schon als Kind hat der/die Protagonist/in den Wunsch, Farmer zu werden. Einmal erwachsen erfüllt er/sie sich diesen Wunsch dann und kauft eine ziemlich heruntergekommene Farm in der Nähe des Städtchens Orange Town. Mit Hilfe der Dorfbewohner macht man sich mit dem Anbau von Gemüse, sowie der Aufzucht von Tieren vertraut, lernt die Stadtbewohner besser kennen und erfüllt Quests für sie, und nimmt an Feiertagen und Events teil. 

Angenehm anders als andere Spiele seiner Art ist dabei die Foraging-Komponente (sprich das Sammeln wilder Früchte und Gegenstände), die im Umland der Stadt zahlreich verteilt sind. Schnell kann man sich so genug Geld für mehr Saatgut und Upgrades zusammensparen. Auch die Ernten bringen ziemlich viel Bares, was den Start angenehm schnell macht.

Leider stellt sich aber schon nach kurzem Eintönigkeit ein, was vor allem auch an den doch noch recht zahlreichen Bugs und fehlenden Inhalten liegt. Bei mir war unter anderem das Ernten der wilden Bäumen verbuggt, so dass keine Früchte mehr nachwachsen. Gleiches galt auch für questrelevante Mineralien in den Minen, die ich trotz täglicher Besuche dort auch nach Wochen nicht vorfinden konnte. Auch die Beziehungen zu den Bewohnern waren anscheinend verbuggt: für manche habe ich lediglich eine Quest erfüllt und direkt einen Freundschaftsstern (=so ähnlich wie Herzen anderer Spiele) erhalten, während ich anderen täglich Geschenke brachte und mehrere Quests erfüllte und sich überhaupt nichts tat.
Die Tagesabläufe der Bewohner waren schwer teilweise schwer nachvollziehbar (z.B. war der lokale Tierexperte, dem man seine Hühner zur Bewertung bringen kann, ständig vom Erdboden verschluckt; eine Dorfbewohnerin stand stundenlang in einer Nische herum und war nicht ansprechbar -> creepy! o.O). 
Auch das Energiesystem ist ziemlich gewöhnungsbedürftig: sind die Felder gegossen, sind bereits ca. 7/8 der Energie futsch und für Angeln oder ähnliches kaum was übrig. Um sie aufzufüllen muss man einerseits ständig etwas essen und andererseits genug schlafen. Die Definition von ""genug schlafen"" ist aber nicht sehr einsichtig. An manchen Tagen ging ich früh schlafen und wachte am nächsten Morgen trotzdem mit halber Energie auf, an anderen ging ich halb tot kurz vor Mitternacht ins Bett und morgens war alles aufgefüllt. Hm...

Ich weiß, dass das Spiel noch im frühen Early Access ist und ich hoffe (und denke), dass sich hier noch viel tun wird. Derzeit kann ich das Spiel aber leider nicht weiterempfehlen, da (vor allem für den vollen Preis) noch ziemlich wenig im Spiel steckt. Wenn neue Inhalte hinzukommen und Bugs ausgebügelt werden, schaue ich gerne wieder rein und passe diese Review entsprechend an. Aber für den Moment werde ich das Farmer-Dasein erstmal an den Nagel hängen.",1550713891,1550713891,False,17,3,0.656567633152008057,0,True,False,True,False,,,

В году реализована сезонность, в каждом из которых геймплей слегка разнится, что не даёт совсем уж заскучать.

Туториал, к сожалению, текстовый, на английском и довольно нудный, так что запросто можно пропустить ключевую информацию - например, я не понял, как продавать что-либо, что фактически делало игру не-играбельной; разработчик подсказал, что надо складывать хлам на продажу в Shipping bin на выходе с фермы. У большинства неписей своё расписание жизни, у кого-то подписанное на табличке, у кого-то нет, что зачастую превращает процесс их поиска в унылый геморрой; надо выучить. Карты нет, в этом большой минус, тоже приходится учить, кто где; но мир небольшой, всё довольно просто.

Кроме фермы, есть несколько других занятий - шахта, рыбалка - так что не обязательно упарываться по посадкам и поливу; но если уж посадил, то будь добр, поливай.

По мере игры появляются новые возможности, открываются новые локации, и т.д. В общем-то, есть чем заняться. Возможно, игра дороговата, но вполне качественно сделана.

- Neat, great INDOOR animation 
- easy to access
- type using keyboard instead of virtual keyboard ( but this is also a negative) 
- nice music
- a lot of different characters and animal. interesting concept
Negative
- outdoor movement gradually slow down due to map loading, Recommend chunk down the map size.
- Too much elements/ resouces, i know it is an early access still and you want to make the game easy for people to play, but still these elements place randomly, and untidy throughout the whole game, it make the map feel less neat and very confusing 
- Need more description, guide and such, especially a MAP I wish i know where to go, Is that the end of the map since the walking speed is slow and the map is too big, i cannot decide specifilly where i want to go and am i reaching the end of it.
- Give us a lot of control decision, you can use the keyboard or the mouse is up to you, the keyboard to type or virtual keyboard to type. BUT, this make me more confused as there is no control guide.

It's taken me longer than I'd like, but I finally bought it, and am glad I did! The game is fully playable, with a town filled with characters, mines to explore, and a good amount to do. I'm already addicted to the farming and mining system, and have fallen into the gamer trap of ""Just one more day!!!"" ...Two hours and three days later, I'm still playing it. The game is still not finished, and right now, that's most evident by the characters. Their dialogue is solid and their characterization very promising, but you can tell they still have a lot more progress to go in giving them full arcs and characterization. However, the developer is very active, and as I can tell from experience, very responsive to the community and sounds like a great person! (Thanks so much for all their hard work! :D :D :D ) 

Pros: (The dev has said there are many more developments to come--I'm especially looking forward to the story and rival marriages--but in the name of fairness, I am only listing the pros available as of this update). 

+ User-interface. I've heard some complaints that the UI is difficult, but I've found it pretty easy, actually. I'm guessing updates have been made, but it took me only a day or so before I learned the controls. The item/tool bars are simple and easily accessible, and you can find everything else you need neatly organized in the one Menu screen.

+ Solid game mechanics. As mentioned before, the game is fully playable, and the farming/mining systems are solid and easily addicting. 

+ Little handholding but good support. The game doesn't bog you down with days' worth of tutorials like in Harvest Moon, but it gives you enough to start with to begin, and the game itself is pretty intuitive if you've played any Harvest Moon games at all. Also, the game is fairly forgiving, since if you tire yourself out, you can just pick fruit around the areas to refill your stamina. This does encourage you to plan ahead, though, so you stock up on food if you're expecting to do a large bulk of work.

+ Balanced. So far, everything from the prices to the stamina to the mining chances seem balanced. If you work hard/long enough, you'll get what you need in a fair amount of time, without it feeling too easy.

+ Great dev! Again, the dev is active and helpful, and has really taken the time to listen to the community to provide a promising game for all those Harvest Moon and Rune Factory fans.

+ Characters. The characters are still in the Early-Access stages, but from what I can tell so far, their dialogue seems pretty solid (if somewhat limited since, again, Early-Access), and they seem to have a lot of potential. I also like how your character actually speaks, instead of just nodding their head with chat bubbles popping above their heads. I can understand if this feature isn't for everyone, but for me, I feel like it gives you more depth, and leads to some humorous moments in the game. If anyone has gone far enough in the mine yet, the dev does have a good sense of humor. 

* Artwork/Music. The artwork is good and gives the game character, and the music is nice to listen to and really sets the peaceful mood you're looking for in a farming game. 



Cons: (Please keep in mind this game is still in Early Access, so I suspect many of these 'cons' will be fixed over the course of the game's development. The fact that there's so few of them I can find is saying something, too). 

- No map (yet!). It took me a bit to get oriented in the game, since the layout in some areas are a bit difficult to navigate (for example, the mine area has a lot of mountains where you have to take staircases to make your way up), but I DID get used to it, and am finding my way alright now. A map would still be helpful for references, though.

- No character portraits (yet). I know this is a very late-stage development for games, so please take that into account, but I do miss not being able to see the characters' portraits. They would really help bring the characters to life, and can tell the player so much about them just from the visuals. 


If you're looking for a finished, polished game, I would suggest holding off on purchasing the game for now, but definitely keep a close eye on it, since it's brimming with potential. However, if you want to support the dev and reward their amazing and much appreciated hard work, then GET THE GAME! It may not be 100% done yet, but it's completely playable and already addicting.

They stripped out all the mechanics and started rebuilding and when it finally relaunched it was unplayable. I haven't had a lot of faith since. Play the old version (in beta) for as long as you can. I wish I could keep the old version forever.

Edit: 2022
The game has changed a lot since my initial review, so some of the details here may no longer be accurate but the spirit of it remains the same! Honestly this game is fun just to watch it update and change, even if it's never officially finished because there's just so much to see and explore. There's a passionate team behind it, lots to do and it's really cute! Give it your support!


Original review 2018:
I'm sad that this game flew under my radar for so long, because it really is something special. 
At the moment it's a little empty, there's a large map but only one monthly festival and few quests. But even what's here is delightful to play. There's a wide variety of animals (though I am hoping for alpacas and pigs!) and wild animals to tame. I gather the pets will have more to do in future updates.

There are entertaining puzzles around, little secrets to hunt for - just yesterday I found a random blue crystal under a tree - which encourages you to think outside the box. 
Your character is adorable and emotive, something I had a problem with in Stardew Valley. I hope there will be clothes to collect later!

This has every indication of surpassing Stardew Valley. I'm excited! There are a few bugs but the Dev is very good about fixing them and generally they aren't that bothersome.",1538185145,1695996213,True,9,0,0.568202197551727295,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Mais interessante ainda é ver os muitos jogos inspirados nesse clássico, porém, cada um com sua peculiaridade, com o toque único de seu desenvolvedor, e em [b]Fantasy Farming - Orange Season[/b] não é diferente. Apesar de ser dirigido ao nicho dos jogos simuladores de fazenda, ele desponta com suas particularidades e, por estar ainda em desenvolvimento, nos traz novidades e anseio de conteúdos cada vez melhores.

Prova disso é que comprei e joguei este jogo há pouco mais de um ano atrás. Volto agora (em julho de 2018) e vejo que o trabalho não parou. A interface deixou de ser genérica, semelhante a um placeholder, e tomou um pouco de forma, caminhando para um visual mais aconchegante e combinando com o jogo, dispondo melhor seu conteúdo e de maneira mais agradável. Ainda no visual, vários gráficos foram alterados, para uma arte singular e mais bela (ainda não foram todos, mas espero que uma repaginação total esteja nos planos). Vejo a jogabilidade como mais fluida, os comandos são respondidos mais prontamente e o desempenho do jogo está visivelmente melhor. Tudo isso é prova de um acesso antecipado bem aproveitado, mantendo o jogo atualizado, corrigindo problemas e trazendo novidades, fazendo bom uso e respeitando a confiança daqueles que adquirem o jogo com ele ainda em desenvolvimento. É algo a se incentivar.

Algo que é presente em muitos jogos do tipo e que não notei diferença aqui é a inconstância de ocupação do jogador, principalmente no começo. É comum o [i]mid-game[/i] ser agitado, afinal lá teremos plantações vastas, porém, o início moroso pode ser entediante para quem gosta de trabalho sobrando desde o começo. Seria interessante indicar ao jogador, no início, modos de ele investir o tempo livre, ainda melhor se existirem atividades que terão consequências no progresso do jogo.

Um ponto notável aqui é o comportamento do mundo ao redor do jogador. Ainda que haja os eventos que seguem o roteiro, não é como se o mundo dependesse de ti, enquanto jogador, para funcionar. À excessão dos personagens que lhe darão dicas, o mundo parece caminhar bem independente da sua presença. A qualquer momento tu pode seguir um outro personagem e ele estará fazendo seu trajeto naturalmente. Da mesma forma são os eventos. Alguns jogos são construídos para que tu vá tendo um desempenho melhor a cada evento até finalmente vencer um. Aqui, porém, sinto como se a vitória em um evento estivesse ao meu alcance desde o começo, e acho isso mais justo, principalmente se não é a primeira vez que está jogando o jogo e já possui as ""manhas"" de como iniciar bem.

De volta aos gráficos, é uma pixel arte muito bonita, agradável. Porém, a previamente citada atualização trouxe eles ao passo que manteve alguns gráficos antigos, que na minha opinião destoam um pouco, ainda mais os antigos não sendo tão belos. Espero que futuramente todo visual venha a ser renovado. Os cenários são um tanto vazios. Apesar de uma área de exploração grande, os mapas não convidam a exploração, por serem vazios e os barrancos e chão de terra não serem muito agradáveis. Mais diversidade de lugares e um [i]level design[/i] de lugares mais únicos incentivaria bastante a exploração, e talvez até resolvesse o que mencionei de o jogador não ter o que fazer no começo, incentivando-o a conhecer a vizinhança.

Parabenizo o desenvolvedor por manter-se firme no desenvolvimento, atento ao público, à comunidade e honrar àqueles que apoiaram o acesso antecipado. Acho que em um jogo que o conteúdo busca prender o jogador por horas assim, manter-se ativo e com dinâmica de novidades ajuda a manter o jogo vivo, uma prática que muitos não aderem e acaba levando jogos com ideias interessantíssimas ao esquecimento. Torço para que tudo siga bem na criação e, apesar de não ser um jogador ávido desse gênero, jogar apenas casualmente,  um dia poder sentar e me deliciar com este game concluído com todo potencial que ele promete ter.",1533091633,1533091633,True,3,0,0.487326592206954956,0,True,False,True,False,,,

   Yes, it's still in development. The person behind the game is very active in his community of players and is actively working to make the game as good as possible, given what he envisioned. 
  There is no combat at this time. There are two towns of people to explore. Multiple mines to do mining for ores and gems; an interesting randomized request board; fishing; Rune Factory-style ""seasonal"" fields hidden away in caverns and caves, mountains to explore and forage through, and a secret hidden society.
   For non-violent fantasy, with responsibility, budgeting, and even some interesting animal breeding available, what's not to love? You can upgrade your house and your tools, buy seeds, buy and care for animals, raise ""better"" animals depending on what you personally consider better, and spend days wanderng the mountains or fighing in the ocean.

I have never gone back to edit a review but I'm very glad I tried playing this game again after letting it sit in my library for a year. Due to boredom waiting for the new SDV update, I decided to give it another shot--and WOW, what an improvement!! This game is now set up to become one of my favorite farming RPGs as long as the devs keep working on it. The graphics that were once painfully awkward are now cute and charming. The controls have improved immensely. And the level of detail is what makes this game stand apart most of all.

Unlike a lot of farming RPGs, this one is layered with nuance. Characters are dynamic and entertaining as you'd get in SDV, with self-aware/fourth-wall-breaking dialogue, and there are more options than in most other games. Chickens, cows, goats, and horses all come with multiple colors you can choose from when purchasing; there are dogs and cats (with a wide range of colorings, compared to other titles), as well as interactable turtles and squirrels, and even some beavers. Each season has a large number of different wild flowers/fruits to collect, and lots of them, and the world is relatively large with a lot of areas to explore, including maze-like elements in the mines and an ""enchanted"" forrest. 

I can't wait for more features to be added--especially dating/marriage, as there are lots of single villagers already implemented. The devs also say there will be even more animals in future versions, which I look forward to as well! 

Happy to say I can now vehemently recommend this game! Devs, keep up the good work!!!

I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint. I played the demo for nearly two hours! Anyway, some notes of what I like:
 - Fast Player Character movement
 - Ability to teleport early game
 - Minimalist animation for actions (picking crops, etc)
 - Random animals to pet!!
 - I was leery about the stamina/fatigue mechanic (reminiscent of Harvest Moon A New Beginning) but managing it is much simpler due to food availability, particularly for early game.
 - Interesting that there's no combat (so far), but magic is present in-game
 - Unified storage!!
 - Ability to move buildings (coop, etc) all over the farm by yourself
 - Potential to buy more lands
 - And to have a bank account?

What can be improved:
 - too many screens. While I see that it compensates for how quickly the PC moves, it disrupts the game too much and makes it difficult to envision a cohesive world
 - for mouse users: too much clicking when harvesting crops. It would be nice if PC can just hold left click (a la Stardew Valley)
 - some graphic/action issues in planting. Sometimes clicking the tilled dirt isn't enough; PC has to be at a certain distance/angle for seed to be planted. planting is easier in keyboard mode though.
 - better character sprites? or maybe character portraits

All in all, it's a fun game. It has potential and I can't wait to play further as more content comes out.

Time of Writing is around patch .3 . The game has so much love from the creator, Hudell. The game feels pretty familiar to HM:FoM in terms of focus. Got a farm, got some seeds, will plant and damn if anyone plans to get in the way. Starting out you go through the struggle of managing stamina while you try not to pass out while planting some potatos. It's the usual, which is pleasant. 

The music is pleasant and never feels really out of place. I still need to listen to the rest of the seasons. The spring has this upbeat flute and piano piece which I've caught myself humming along with without really realizing it. AT night the music becomes calm, reminescent of a quiet night in the country. I noticed there's not a lot of sound during rain. . Hudell has noted there plans to be more variation of music throughout the day so maybe around then there'll be more ambient noises during rainy days.

 There's nice variety currently with the animals. For each animal you have a selection of colors for each of them so you cankeep control of your perfect all white chicken coop or if you want to have a menagerie of different colored fowls. Did i mention you can also have a yak? In true fashion you can also have a pet dog (maybe a cat in the future? who knoooows) whom I didn't know could turn into the most adorable set of pixels when I picked it up.

Last thing, that I think is the most important part of the game is its art. Houses look generally Housey. The thing that struck me the most about the art is that it really looks like a contryish type of village. Dirt in places, trees all over, the occasional annoying rock that I'm totally gonna smash if my stamina wasn't too low. There isn't portraits for the characters at the moment, however Hudell has shared some artwork on his discord and they look absolutely gorgeous with a very unique look to them.

This definitely is a game worth at the very least keepign an eye on. Hudell has so many ideas and plans for the game that I think will allow for a unique experience. Plus you can  have a guy legitmately tell you to stomp your crops if they sass you, same guy also asked me for milk to fix his furniture.

I found that having no map either was really frustrating as you would wander about no idea where you're no idea where you need to go either.  If you can polish this off add some stories, drama or interesting text to the npcs including your own protagonist and even a basic map would help.  Also write some background stories about each npc you meet in the friends and add some likes and dislikes for gifts, add interesting text to what each npc has to say get rid of the tutorials coming from their mouths, if you want a tutorial add one in the beginning for players to use but you're killing the immersion of the game letting your npcs tell me ""I need an axe to cut down trees"" over and over again or don't work too hard you will lose stamina.

They had removed the updates on this page. I DO NOT recommend buying this game anymore. So disappointing!

UPDATE: Just thought to add that leaving chickens/ducks out DO feed them and so the times they don't lay eggs must have been glitches in-game. Also, there hasnt been any update for quite a few mths so I had stopped playing for now to wait for the next update as my days have been getting too repetitive after a while. I will rate it 4/5 stars for now.

Amazing!!! I am only on day 15 and this game is much better than Gleaner Heights or even some other harvest moon /season of story/rune factory games i have played. There is enough things to do everyday and additional events here and there that helps make the game more varied. The ""go home"" function is super awesome as the areas to explore are time consuming if we were to need to walk back home. There are also some obvious originality aspects in this game compared to other games just copying each other. The developer responds pretty quickly and that is an added plus!!!!

The only few downsides I have discovered so far is that you cant receive gifts if your backpack is full. Leaving your chicken/duck out doesn't feed them and they are able to walk through the gates if the gates are placed horizontally.

I am SO looking forward to new updates to this game and will definitely update this review if anything changes :)",1525643253,1630627346,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Hudell... Advertise it a ton because it's awesome and you deserve a lot of backing to develop this even further! This is Early Access done right!

Good points in brief:

- Farming, foraging, mining, festivals, animals, good music - What's not to love?!
- Multiple towns
- Ability to tame wild animals
- Tons of animal species, plus multiple colour options for each animal
- THE MUSIC
- Serious potential, and in a great playable state already even though it's still EA.
- Nice looking characters
- Responsive dev with regular updates.

Loving it so much right now... (I played a good ten hours on the demo too so the hours are decieving). 

Improvements needed/ hopeful additions: 

Literally cannot wait for the addition of cooking, dating/marriage, more festivals and hopefully leisure options (a bar or social spot of some sort? Maybe even some extra little mini games, or raise the difficulty of fishing to make it more of a challenge?) 

It's hard to give downsides because my only 'bad points' are things which I think Hudell has plans to include in the future.. The above for example.. plus would be nice to see more conversation options with the characters so you can feel a bit more invested in them, so far I don't have any opinions good or bad on any character because you can't really see their 'personalities' as it stands. Will be nice to see that expanded on as there's real potential there, the character models are great and I'm already starting to envisage my own personas for them! :')

Also the bathroom becoming functional would be great... use of one bath a day replenishes you stamina perhaps? As if you have 30+ crops planted in the early game stages, you're left with 2 hearts after watering them and it's only 8am!

The 'foraging area' is awesome but still feels a little baron, perhaps add an extra house or two out there with more reclusive or obscure characters? Or some leisure activity place of some sort?

All in all I'm loving the game so far and I really do expect that the above will all be expanded on in the future, the dev seems really on-the-ball and responsive, and is really vocal on disscussion boards and on Discord. Everyone will compare it to Stardew Valley, but it definitely has the ability to stand firmly on its own. If you're debating on getting it in early access... go for it. It's completely playable in this state and the more support the Dev recieves.. the quicker I'm sure we'll see content expansion and progress. 

Keep up the good work, I'm really pysched for future updates!!

Yes, it is early access, but it does have a terrific amount of content in place, the developer is exceedingly active both in adding new content and in listening to player requests, and the potential for what this game could become is wonderful.  The game is moddable, but, since it is in early access, there are only a few, developer mods available right now.  However, once released, the game will have a workshop and allow players to mod and customize to their heart's content.

As for the gameplay, it is very similar to games like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley.  You get a farm, farm, build relationships with local residents, fulfill tasks, etc.  Each season is a full month and contains a festival.  Right now, you can play through the seasons, farming, foraging, and fishing.  You can also start accumulating livestock, raising everything from chickens to yaks.  While you can ""breed"" chickens, I don't believe this feature has been implemented yet for the other livestock.  Your chickens and ducks will lay eggs, but I haven't figured out how to milk the goats, cows, etc. (this might not be implemented quite yet).  You also can build friendships with both locals and animals as well as tame wild animals to bring to your farm.  

While many features are still in progress, you can easily see where they are going.  For example, romantic relationships are hinted at right now in the game and probably coming soon.  The potential to breed livestock is also in place, and there are myriad areas that you can enter in the game that are also still in development such as the graveyard and forest maze.  The developer, as I mentioned before, is extremely active, which is delightful as it appears there is about 1 huge update per month that adds excellent new features and expands on ones currently in place.  In fact, the game's website nicely lists at least 5 huge updates and the content that each will potentially contain.

Even with the more limited content, I currently have over 20 hours invested in the game and am only now entering the Summer season.

I really did enjoy this game overall, however I would not spend $13.99 on it at this moment. This game is well made graphically and most interactions happen without a hitch! The graphics are nice and the overall feel of the game is good.

However, a few points that I was not a fan of is the music in the game, there are only like 3/4 tracks that play on a loop and they feel more of music in the game, as opposed to background music. What I mean is that you're more aware of the music being there and always being there and being on a loop, that it gets annoying at times. 

Okay, ""music not that big of a deal, I play it on mute and have my own music playing in the background"" exactly, it's not a huge deal at all, just a slight annoyance at times.

This game is also very [b]not[/b] hand-holdy at all. Which is both good and bad.
It's good because it lets you get right into the game without annoying tutorials taking up your entire first week/month of the game, so that's really nice.
On the other hand, because of that the game is very much just ""Okay....GO!"" and you just start wandering around until things happen.

Which, I do get part of this game [b]is[/b] exploration, and the exploration, map size, things to see are really nice, vast, large, etc. I loved the exploration in this game and how large the maps were and the things to do and see in each of them! It really made the world a lot more interesting than that of like Stardew Valley.

[spoiler]You don't get handed all your tools, you have to go out and find them, which I love. It was awesome just roaming around then finding a box and suddenly getting a new tool! It was much better than having all the tools just handed to you, or having to complete X things to get a cutscene.[/spoiler]

Overall, I would recommend this game, but not yet. There is so much that can be done with this game that I am excited to see where it goes from here, as it is still in Early Access. I will certainly be following this game and wanting to see what happens in it, because it was good, but not quite there yet(I feel anyway)
Maybe one day I will feel it's worth that price tag, but at this moment I would feel more comfortable spending $7.99-9.99 on this game.

Wie unschwer anhand der Screenshots zu erkennen ist, ist [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/416000/Fantasy_Farming_Orange_Season/]Fantasy Farming: Orange Season[/url] ein Farming-Simulator, welcher sich inhaltlich und grafisch stark an [url=https://www.amazon.de/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=xeeran-21&keywords=harvest moon&index=aps&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=xm2&linkId=257c9da503f0242f7f730cc051316e37]Harvest Moon[/url] orientiert und natürlich auch Parallelen zu [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/]Stardew Valley[/url] aufweist. Dabei lässt sich der Charakter des Spiels schon ganz gut erkennen, wenngleich sich das Spiel noch mit Version 0.2.6 in der Early-Access-Phase befindet. Der Sound, bestehend aus Flöten- & Keyboardmusik plus gelegentlichem Glockenspiel, passt dabei zum idyllischen Dasein als Farmer. Die Steuerung, sowohl mit Maus & Tastatur als auch mit dem Controller (XBox Wireless 360), ist einfach und gut.

[b]Das Gameplay[/b]

In einem Tutorial wird man an die Mechaniken des Spiels, simpel und einfach erklärt, herangeführt ehe man eigenständig agieren darf. In den ersten Tagen gilt es dann vor allen Dingen das Spiel zu begreifen und die Werkzeuge des Farmer sein zu finden. Des Weiteren ergeben sich auch schon die ersten Quests, die man als Starthilfe erachten darf. Wesentliche Bestandteile sind hier natürlich der Anbau von Pflanzen, wobei man zu Beginn recht limitiert ist. Es fehlt halt noch das nötige Kleingeld! Das kann man allerdings durch das Schürfen von Erzen in der Mine ganz gut und recht schnell erhalten, wenn man sie dann raffiniert und verkauft. 

Zuvor hat man jedoch auch das ein oder andere Rätsel zu lösen, wobei der Schwierigkeitsgrad äußerst moderat gehalten ist. Hier hat man eindeutig die Casual-Szene im Blick. Auch das Suchen, Finden und Sammeln von Gegenständen (Blumen, Obst, etc.) ist ein essentieller Bestandteil der einem das Leben erleichtert. Mit fortschreitender Zeit kann man dann auch andere Pflanzen anbauen, die Werkzeuge und die Farm upgraden und sich auch mal ein Tier zulegen, welches dann gehegt, gepflegt und aufgezogen werden muss. Alles in allem steht einem dann ein rundum erfüllendes Farmerleben ins Haus und wer auch mal entspannen möchte, der geht halt fischen.

[b]Features und Mankos[/b]

Für mich besonders wirken die Beziehungen zu anderen Dorfbewohnern. Diese können durch kleinere Aufgaben, z .B. das Bringen einer Blume, oder durch größere Quests, z.B. die Mitgliedschaft in der Bergbau-Liga, verbessert werden. Dabei haben die Charaktere alle eine eigene Persönlichkeit, sofern man sich mit ihnen beschäftigt. Leider sind die Dialoge noch recht beschränkt, es bleibt jedoch zu hoffen, dass sich das noch ändert und die Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten ausgeweitet werden. Als cool und lustig empfinde ich außerdem die Möglichkeit zum Schreiben von Briefen. Das geht bei allen Charakteren, inklusive der eigenen Mutter. 

Leider fehlt mir eine Karte zur einfachen Übersicht. Auch die Öffnungszeiten und Erreichbarkeit der Geschäfte ist mir zu konfus. Die Einen öffnen um 8:00 Uhr und schließen um 15:00 Uhr, die Anderen öffnen um 9:30 Uhr, schließen dafür um 17:00 Uhr und wieder Andere sind von 10:00 - 14:00 Uhr erreichbar. Da stellt sich einem schon die Frage: Warum? 

[b]Fazit[/b]

Für einen Early-Access-Titel wirkt das Spiel schon recht weit. Die implementierten Features und Planungen dbzgl. scheinen durchdacht zu sein und ergänzen das Farmerleben auf passende Art und Weise. Die Entwickler von [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Hudell%20Tales&snr=1_5_9__400]Hudell Tales[/url] bringen gefühlt alle zwei bis drei Wochen ein Update und auch die Kommunikation im Forum ist meiner Erfahrung und Beobachtung nach hervorragend. Das kenne ich auch anders! Über den Preis lässt sich wie so oft streiten. Für das gleiche Geld kann man einen der oben erwähnten Titel erhalten und hat dabei ein bereits fertig entwickeltes Spiel. Jedoch kann man hier noch Einfluss auf die Entwicklung nehmen und meines Erachtens nach bei einem Titel, welcher viel Potential in sich birgt. Daher auch die Kaufempfehlung, denn auch dafür ist Early Access gedacht.

Several varities of animals, ranging from moutain goats to ducks to the typical cows and chickens. Though the controls are a bit wonky, which I'll chalk up to this game still being in development, it shouldn't limit you to purchasing this game! 

I enjoy the laidback atmosphere of this game and no monsters to fight in the mines! I'm looking forward to more festivals and perhaps a bit more plotline, as you're just placed in your farm and expected to go from there. 

Foraging is simple, and there are always new areas to collect fruits, fish and materials. I am looking forward to more fish variety in the game too. There are additional animals to befriend and bring onto your farm.

As a huge fan and player of all farming games from Harvest Moon and Rune Factory to Stardew Valley I am so happy to have found this gem of a game that has just started!
I've only played a few hours but so far this is how I feel:

The characters all seem developed (well pretty good since this is just early-access) and have personalities, even some jokes and are kind of silly! 
It all feels very nice and the start of something really great that could even rival Stardew Valley in the quality of the content.

The quests are enjoyable, there are fun puzzles that won't have you pulling out your hair to understand only to think about. You start out with a challenge to find the tools even~ No simple freebee tool start for you.

Now, there are of course some things off, the controls are a little wonky to try to remember. But hey, that can easily be remembered after playing awhile!
I do lag here and there in my front yard, but everywhere else runs perfectly smooth~

Overall, for an early access game, this is A O.K in my book! I absolutely can't wait to see what is to come of this game as it develops more.",1509078256,1509078747,True,12,2,0.616489291191101074,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Normally, I steer clear of these as I have heard so many horror stories about games never being finished and the developers basically running away with the money paid to them. However, the previous reviews had mentioned constant updates from the developer, and... WOW! They were not kidding! This simple farming sim game in the vein of Harvest Moon and others like it appears to be as much of a passion project for Hudell Tales as Stardew Valley was for Concerned Ape.

Please do not let my low play time for this game (half an hour, at the time of writing this) deter you from taking my words to heart when deciding whether or not Orange Season is a game you would like to spend your money on. I have played every Harvest Moon title since Friends of Mineral town, even so far as to continuing with both the Harvest Moon series and Story of Seasons games following the split between Marvelous and Nastume. Stardew Valley is my most-played game on Steam, and I even have it for the PS4 because I adore it so much. So, believe me when I tell you I have plenty of experience with these sort of games and can tell when I see a good one - even if it is still being developed.

I'm not going to lie. There are a few issues I ran into with the game, but these were mostly just small bugs and they've already been ironed out as far as I can tell. Bugs such as these are going to be present in a game which is still in Early Access, and it bugs me (pun not intended) that people always seem to focus on them when reviewing a game which has not been ""officially"" released. Any such issues I have had have been MINOR, and have not affected the gameplay as a whole to the point where I had to scrap my save and start over.

One of the biggest problems I have with the game - which is more of a nitpick than an actual problem - is the lack of choice in the character creator. While I appreciate that the developer has recently added in the ability to play your character as transgender (yay inclusion!), you still must play as the generic male or female model type with only the ability to change hair and skin color. Yes, I know the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games are pretty much the same, but Stardew Valley gave us a wide variety of things like hairstyles and clothing items to choose from in order to make every character unique to their player. I am hoping more options will be added into a later update. Yes, I know mods are a thing for the game... but I have not installed any of them and probably won't until after the game's final release in order to preserve things as the developer intended them during the ongoing development cycle.

It's saying a lot when the only true complaint you have is a lack of variety in your own character model, I think. That's why I can confidently say that anyone who is a lover of farming sims and/or a fan of Stardew Valley and looking for a little more of that sort of game to scratch their itch should seriously consider picking up Orange Season. Even with the game still being in Early Access, you will not be disapppointed! On the contrary, with the constant updates and additions from Hudell Tales, you will only have more to look forward to as time passes with this game in your library.",1508766625,1508766625,True,5,0,0.527453482151031494,0,True,False,True,False,,,

————以下为早期版本评测
早期版本内容不多，主角离开父母来到一个叫orange town的地方，开始自己的农场生活，可以与小镇的人们交友，通过探索地图找到不同区域宝箱中的各种工具，各种工具的地址已有社区指南说明，有疑问的玩家可以查看指南。主角有体力限制，以5颗心显示，种植150左右块农田，每日浇水就会耗光体力，所以不能无脑种植赚钱，比较辛苦。
游戏内容有耕种，畜牧，采集，挖矿，升级工具，交友互动。
耕种：在小镇商店可以购买一年四季及常年耕种的种子，购买页面显示种子购买价格、种植时长、单次收获或多次收获及间期时长，以及售卖价格。
畜牧：主角家初始即有1间家禽屋，可养14只鸡，日产1-2鸡蛋/鸡，随故事进展，可在npc Lucas处获得1只公鸡，可以使家产鸡蛋受精，不捡鸡蛋让它继续孵化若干时日后孵出小鸡；1间家畜屋，可养16只牛和羊，日产1牛奶/牛，1羊奶/羊。
采集：游戏区域分为主角农场，orange小镇，海边，矿区，山林野外，湖边野外，火车站。小镇可以采集橙子，海边夏天可采集椰子和贝壳，山林野外可采集橙子、樱桃、花生、蜂巢、香蕉（夏天）以及各季花朵，湖边野外可采集橙子、樱桃、花生、香蕉（夏天）以及各季花朵。
挖矿：获取挖矿工具后，到矿区解决谜题，找到矿区分层，修复矿车，然后就可以开始挖矿了（矿区谜题可搜索社区讨论组内容""puzzle""）。3层及以上每日更新铁矿、铜矿、岩石、砂砾，6层每日更新银矿以上各种矿石，银矿设定为更新于6层右侧区域，需挖除右侧区域普通矿石，给银矿留出更新区域。银矿用于目前版本工具的最高升级。
升级工具：目前版本工具升级，采集相应矿石，在铁匠npc处制作铜块、银块，然后升级为铜质工具，再升级为银质工具。
交友互动：和其他类似游戏一样，可以通过打招呼、送礼、完成对应npc的task增进友谊，特别的一点是，还可以通过写信增进友谊，写信有普通信封和粉色信封，普通信封给普通关系的人，粉色信封写给特殊关系的人（你懂的）。制作人员回复，目前版本未更新交友互动进度，各npc爱心程度不会增加，在后续更新中可通过各种互动增进友谊度。
所有物品通过主角房屋外的出货箱出货。
游戏也有节日设定，比如赛鸡日等，可以带家养鸡去比赛，增加npc好感，获取奖品。
目前我玩到夏天中旬，还有秋冬季节没有体验。

还是测试阶段的作品，看到是农场经营养成类型的游戏，又在打折，毫不犹豫就买了。进去玩了几分钟，实在不敢相信，优化差得难以置信，就这106Mb的游戏，无画面单纯文字对话内容也能2秒卡个十几秒，你敢信？发现只要有对话就一定会卡，没有对话的时候就不会卡。

I stumbled onto Fantasy Farming: Orange Seaon while looking for a game that would interest my 13 year old daughter. She loves the Harvest Moon series but honestly most of the recent titles are virtually the same, using a tired forumla and backstory with little innovation or change based on player feedback. Orange Season attempts to bring a fresh look at the farming/relationship/exploring gameplay without reinventing the wheel. At this, being early access, it has hit the nail on the head. My daughter, who is as finicky as they come, loves it. Now my son loves it and so do I. Updates are frequent and meaningful, making me feel good about my investment. Thus far, the developer seems very in tune with his growing fanbase and by all accounts, I believe this game will grow into something special and fun. I can't state it enough; Please remember that you are purchasing an early access game and thus will not experience all the planned features right away. As it stands right now, I believe the cost is worth it but if you prefer a completed game or feel you will be disatisfied by discovering content in game that is not yet in use then you may consider waiting a little longer until key elements are introduced. Overall, I love it and had to scratch my head for a few minutes to pull a few cons out. Even then, they are basically centered around the fact that it is early access. 

Pros
- Great retro graphics.
- Satisfying gameplay.
- Helpful new ideas and features that you always wished for in Harvest Moon.
- Tasks are varied and interesting with a touch of humor that my kids appreciate.
- Nice variety of activities to engage in, not just watering 50 stalks of corn every day.  
- Great for relaxing, no pressure, gameplay to either kill a few minutes or a couple hours.
- Looking for a use for your underpowered laptop? This will run on it.

Cons
- Early access. Understand you are not buying a complete game.
- Key features of this genre such as relationships, marriage, family not been fully implimented. 
- Limited use of mouse. Controls center around keyboard/controller use and can be mildly inconvenient for avid pc gamers.

Ist es ähnlich wie Stardew Valley - na sicher, deswegen habe ich es ja gekauft. 

Da beide sich an Harvest Moon orientieren, sind sie in gewissen Dingen ähnlich, aber dann auch wieder nicht. Dieses hier ist der Harvest Moon Reihe sehr viel näher als SV es ist. Es gibt mehr zu erkunden, es gibt auch noch andere Dörfer, eine Menge Höhlen, mit Rätsel darin zu lösen...wirklich süß und durchdacht gemacht. Man kann fischen, Pflanzen anbauen und ernten, Tiere erwerben, Erze abbauen, vieles in der Natur sammeln....

Es gibt seit Heute auch eine Wahl zwischen Weiblich und Männlichem Charakter. Sehr vieles muss noch richtig implementiert werden, mehr Optionen mit den Dorfbewohnern zu sprechen, es sollen noch Beziehungen kommen und Workshopanbindung, worauf ich mich freue. Liebe Mods...

Alles in allem gefällt mir hier der Art Stil sehr viel mehr als in SV, die Figuren uns Sachen sind etwas größer und schöner gearbeitet, meiner Meinung nach. Es ist für jeden der das Genre mag, einen Versuch wert. Mir macht es bisher schon Spaß und ich freue mich auf mehr.

Fantasy Farming: Orange Season - довольно интересный симулятор фермера, из тех, что я когда-либо видел. Прежде чем начнутся крики в комментариях добавлю: ""Мне показался он интересным, потому что разработан на RPG Maker"". 

[h1][i]ИДЕЯ И СЮЖЕТ[/i][/h1]
Сама идея далеко не новая. Существует куча симуляторов фермера как на ПК так и на других платформах. Да что уж тут говорить, если даже на ВК сервисе их просто пруд пруди. Ну а что творится на других сервисах, думаю и упоминать не стоит. Идея избита до нельзя. В основном берется за идею построить идеальную ферму и по мере увеличения уровня вашего персонажа, открываются все новые фрукты или овощи. Мало кто ожидает от подобных играх, даже попытки сделать внятный сюжет с квестами. Но тут появляются Hudell Tales со своим Fantasy Farming и нарушают все эталоны данного жанра. За сюжет взята довольно простая история одного паренька, которого задолбала жизнь в городе. Он переезжает в маленькое уютное поселение Orange Town и покупает ""маленький"" участок под огород и разведение живности. После идет такое маленькое ознакомление с местными людьми, которые могут давать вам разнообразные квесты, к примеру: вырасти редиску, покорми одного из жителей, разгадай загадку в местных копальнях и многое другое. 

[h1][i]ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ[/i][/h1]
Геймплейная часть не то чтобы уж сильно разнообразная, тем не менее вспахивать, поливать и рассаживать семена на вашем огороде придется вам самим. И самое главное - это то, что у вашего персонажа стамины не так уж и много и пополнять ее можно лишь едой или сном. Самое привлекательное в этой игре, что можно находить и использовать инструменты типа: молот, топор, коса и прочее. На вашем огороде очень много мусора и кто как не вы способны убрать его полностью. Сам по себе карта в игре не такая уж и маленькая, и придется знатно так попотеть, чтобы изучить ее до конца. Справа от города существует также лабиринт, который пройти ой как не просто (мне это так и не удалось). Ну и куда же без магии? Именно в этом лабиринте мы встречаем ведьму, которая за маленькую помощь дает нам артефакт, способный телепортировать главного героя, как в город, так и на его родную ферму. Помимо изучение местности нам придется также заниматься и самим огородом: вспахивать, поливать, сажать и ухаживать за растениями. В придачу ко всему присутствует система скотоводства.

[h1][i]ГРАФИКА И ЗВУКИ[/i][/h1]
Что можно вытянуть из такого движка как RPG Maker? Да практически ничего. Графика пиксельная, местами, конечно, красивая, но очень угловатая и уж очень азиатская. Удалось ли разработчикам превзойти самих себя? Думаю больше нет, чем да. На самом деле графика довольно хороша, если учесть движок игры, но не более того. Цикл роста растений и их разнообразие впечатляет, но во всем остальном довольно стандартно. Обычные движения персонажей, реплики в виде диалоговых окон, азиатского вида персонажи - это все на что способен этот движок, к большому сожалению. У игры огромнейший потенциал в виде не просто симулятора фермера, а целой фермерской жизни, но этот потенциал может быть загублен в такой простой и однообразной графической обвертке. Музыкальное и звуковое сопровождение довольно спокойное и не вызывает особо много эмоций. В принципе так и должно быть в симуляторе, но это при условии, если графическая составляющая выполнена на хорошем уровне. Здесь же все немного наоборот - сама обвертка у игры довольно стандартна и даже отталкивающая. Самый смак состоит в геймплейной части и самом процессе создание прекрасного огорода и сада, с огромным количеством животных в хлеву!

[h1][i]ПЛЮСЫ И МИНУСЫ[/i][/h1]
Плюсы:
+ Наличие сюжета и квестов
+ Разнообразие в растениях, животных
+ Дух фермерства практически в каждой секунде игры
+ Наличие юмора и стеба над разработчиками
+ Приятное музыкальное сопровождение

Минусы:
- Магия портит атмосферу игры
- Однотипные персонажи (из-за движка RPG Maker)
- Довольно средняя графическая оболочка

Fantasy Farming: Orange Season - до сих пор находится в раннем доступе, и многое еще поменяется и добавится. На этом этапе можно поставить 8 из 10, за довольно перспективный симулятор фермера.

Ahh, another farming simulator hits Steam. As a huge fan of the Harvest Moon series, I definitely put aside some money to purchase this game. Please bear in mind that I only got up to Spring 27, Year 1 and basing my review on everything I've seen so far.

Unlike other farming simulation games, the main character was not left to tend to a farm of a deceased relative, but in fact had aspirations to become a farmer since they were young. The first day you are introduced to the mayor who helps get you settled into your new home along with another farmer who helps teach you the basics of farming. After a quick tutorial, you can take your character outside the farm and begin exploring.

Pros
+Controller support
+Nice looking graphics
+Several different crops to grow in each season.
+Characters are unique and have different personalities.
+Tasks available to complete.
+Several different animals you can raise.
+Being able to edit the contents of the shipping bin before it's shipped. Very helpful if you accidently put something in you needed.
+You recieve a dog on Spring 2, Year 1.
+One of the coolest features, which reminds me of Animal Crossing, is being able to write letters to other characters, including your mom!
+Lots of areas to explore and forage to collect.

Cons
-Not much to do in the first couple days. I found myself running around town several times just to kill time.
-No map to help keep track of exploration.
-Some of the building/store times of operation are weird. Why is the library only open for 7 hours in the middle of the day?
-Female playable character not implemented yet as of 4/22/17.
-Only two skin choices.
-Some NPCs have no unique text and/or stand in one spot all day, every day.
-No storage unit to put extra things you don't need/want to collect.

Suggestions
= Add a statistics panel to track various stats such as conversations had, products/produce shipped.
= Add a relationships page to track relationships with characters.
= Add collectible shells at the beach.
= Add an in-game calendar.
= Add text to the television.
= Add a map.
= Add images to the character's text box.
= Add voice over to the opening cutscreen. 
= Add being able to get a cat.

If any of these things are already in-game and I just haven't unlocked them yet, please let me know. Otherwise this game shows great promise and I look forward to any and all updates! Brian Hudell is working very hard to provide the best customer service experience he can and has already provided several updates using suggestions from players.

In addition we also started a wiki for the game if anyone feels like editing and helping out: http://orange-season.wikia.com/wiki/Special:WikiActivity",1492857309,1493381426,True,88,0,0.851739406585693359,3,True,False,True,False,,,
