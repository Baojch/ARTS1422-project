[b]Deus Ex Machina[/b] is an art-house video game from the 80s. The game features both the original version and a remastered one with completely remade graphics. 

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Great soundtrack 
+ Unique trippy atmosphere

[b]Cons:[/b]
- No ability to pause the game
- No way to continue the game
- Technical issues
- Very short (around 40 minutes)

[h1]Story[/h1] 
The game tells of a distant future, where people are born from test tubes, raised by machines and controlled by the government. During the course of the game, you will follow the life of such a man from its beginning in a test tube to the bitter end. The story is pretty abstract, voice actors just throw a lot of philosophical quotes at you instead of describing what happens on the screen.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It's hard to assign a genre to this game, it is composed of short levels where you move a green square around and interact with things. The game doesn't state a goal, though it's easy to figure out, once you understand the controls (move with arrows, space to interact). There's no winning or losing here, you can even complete this game without ever touching your keyboard. Though the game tracks your percentage of completion, it doesn't matter at all. There isn't even a leaderboard. 

[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]
There are two graphics modes in this game, the original one with pixel graphics and the remastered one, that looks like photo clippings. Both graphic modes are hard on the eyes, with lots of bright colors and flashy animations. The original one is very minimalistic, but it has a certain style and your imagination will easily fill the gaps with the help of an amazing audio. The remastered version however didn't quite click for me. It felt like a game prototype with placeholder graphics. The main reason why I'd recommend this game is its unique audio. There are around 40 minutes of great music and voice acting done by famous British actors. It easily outshines all other aspect of the game and makes it feels like a music video.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Specs: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB, 32GB RAM. Windows 11.

The performance is good, too good, because the game runs very, very fast for me, because its speed is tied to FPS. So if your monitor supports more than 60 FPS, it will be very difficult to enjoy the game since the visuals will become even trippier. I advise you to cap your frame rate using 3rd party applications. There are other issues with it, like the lack of pause button and no way to exit the game correctly, the process still runs in the background after exiting, you have to shut it down yourself.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
While [b]Deus Ex Machina[/b] is a unique and enjoyable experience, I would only recommend it to those who want to listen to some amazing music and enjoy trippy visuals. If you're looking for an interesting story or fun gameplay, you won't find it here.",1648999915,1648999915,True,3,0,0.53125,0,False,False,False,False,,,

1984 yılında bu benzersiz ve ilginç oyun geliştirildi ve ilk olarak Automata UK tarafından ZX Spectrum'da yayınlandı.

Deus Ex Machina, ünlülerin anlatımı ve müziğini içeren tamamen senkronize bir soundtrack albümüne sahip ilk video oyunuydu. Oyuncu kadrosunda Ian Dury, Jon Pertwee, Donna Bailey, Frankie Howerd, E.P. Thompson ve Mel Croucher yer alıyor. Soundtrack oyun devam ederken çalınan kasette sağlandı.

Oyun, makinede oluşan bir kusurun gebe kaldığı andan itibaren, evrimi ve ölüme kadar olan ömrünü çiziyor. İlerleme görünür bir şekilde As You Like It (Size Nasıl Geliyorsa) Shakespeare oyununa dayanmaktadır ve bununla ilgili birçok alıntı ve parodi içermektedir. 

1984'te yaratılan oyun, ""bu bir oyun mu?"" tartışmasına yol açan ilk video oyunları arasında yer alırken, henüz keşfedilmemiş kavram olan ""interaktif bir film"" konumunu ortaya koymuştur. Deus Ex Machina sadece bir oyun değil, görsel ve işitsel bir deneyim. Fikir, baştan sona bir temayı takip etmeniz gereken konsepte sahip. Bu durumda tema bir bilgisayar hatası tarafından üretilen bir mutantın büyümesi, doğumu, yaşlanması ve ölümüdür. Yaratılışın ilk süreci aslında bir grup fare bırakmasıyla gerçekleşir; Oyuncu olarak, bu acayip organik kazayı yaşam döngüsü boyunca beslemeli ve yönlendirmelisiniz. Hepsi bir müzik ve anlatı tema ile senkronize edilmiş. 

Oyun, oyuncunun doğrudan bir katılımcıdan çok bir gözlemci olduğu deneysel bir sanat nesnesi olarak sunulur. Birçok felsefi, teolojik ve antropolojik konuya değinen bir oyun. Buradaki en büyük şey anlatı, varoluşçu olay örgüsü ve sunum.

Deus Ex Machina tam bir oyun değil. Dediğim gibi, bu daha çok bir sanat deneyi, bir hikâye gibi, hoş bir tadın iyi bir şarap gibi kaldığı bir yer.",1643134041,1643134041,True,14,0,0.689050436019897461,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a weird one. It's difficult to define exactly what it is, or who exactly was demanding a remaster of it. But it's maybe not one you should completely write off.

[i]Deus Ex Machina, Game of the Year, 30th Anniversary Collector’s Edition[/i] (Unrelated to the [i]Deus Ex[/i] series) is a remaster of a 1984 game of the same name that I had never heard of. At the time, it gained cult success for its avant-garde nature and innovative synchronicity between gameplay and sound.

The tone of the game feels like it mirrors the fading ripples of psychedelic aftershock left by the 60s, interwoven with an ambivalence somewhere between paranoia and wonder towards the technology of the future. This version of the game allows you to play through both a port of the original ZX Spectrum edition, and a remastered edition, with more refined graphics. The sound design and music is certainly impressive for the time, bearing an otherworldly feeling to it. Graphically, even in the remastered version, there's not a huge amount to write home about, but the graphical fidelity isn't particularly the focus, as the game thematically functions as a sort of surreal art piece, the concepts it attempts to convey only being represented abstractly anyways. It's difficult to say whether or not constructing a narrative in this manner is obnoxious or pretentious, but it's certainly interesting. The whole experience feels like attending a slam poetry session inside a robot's brain.

The game plays through the entire life cycle then death of a being, perhaps a human, perhaps an android. Along the way, your performance at stages defines how complete of a being you eventually become. Each stage plays like a minigame, and often times the objective isn't clearly defined. After a couple of playthroughs, I managed to make it through the game with minimal mistakes, and attained a more desirable ending, but the first couple were almost complete confusion. This is part of the game's charm, and is certainly thematically appropriate. Being tossed out into the world in all of its uncertainty and confusion is daunting enough, let alone for a conscious entity without the guidance of a parent.

It's easy to extrapolate and interpret the content of Deus Ex Machina, as it tells a story in such a strange manner. The issue is that this style of narrative may not resonate with everybody, and the gameplay isn't fantastic. The addition of videos explaining the history behind the game were a worthwhile addition, contextualising [i]why[/i] the game gained the following it has, while simultaneously humanising them, in spite of how alien their work feels.

Overall, I think this was largely released for the niche audience that enjoyed the original, but that doesn't mean that it can't find new players in modern day. It's a brief, experimental experience that definitely left an impression on me. For its unique tone, I'd say those who enjoy the surreal would get a kick out of Deus Ex Machina. Just don't expect particularly conventional gameplay along the way.

So at the top of this window, it shows that I've played this game for 9.1 hours, 9.2 hours on record, so basically, that's it.

I find myself wondering if other people experience more or less time? Does everyone get 9.1 hours of game play?

Does this game have replay value? I don't know. I'm not sure I played this game to begin with. I feel like it played me.

Or I played myself?

The game with all the fixin's is like $5. That's a cup of coffee. Try to find an experience that lasts 9.1 hours for $5. Maybe you could rent Sixth Sense, watch it all the way through, see the twist ending, then go back and watch it again, this time, knowing about the twist?

But Sixth Sense had a budget of $40 million. This game, I'm hoping, did not have that budget.

But it did have Jon Pertwee, the third Doctor in Doctor Who, so it has that going for it.

Did I mention it's cheap? $5!

This game originally came out in 1984. This is likely before some of you were born. So there, fake nostalgia. You get to understand how your parents, or grandparents, used to spend their time when they weren't outside playing and scraping their knees walking in the forest. We did that once.

Or maybe you grew up in the 80's, and you had a Commodore 64, or the ZX Spectrum? Real nostalgia.

Or maybe you never grew up at all? And you're just haunting this page, looking for a way to escape purgatory?

This game is based loosely on ""The Seven Ages Of Man"" from Shakespeare's play ""As You Like it.""

You will be shocked at the juxtaposition of fantastic voice acting, a real children's choir, fun music, weird game-play, and some of the most authentically retro graphics you've ever experienced.

Don't bother buying this game if you have a history of photogenic seizures (those caused by light). You may not have a good time. I mean, some games just put that seizure warning up because they don't want to get sued? It's like at least one part of this game was designed by a medical professional to induce seizures.  Otherwise, you'll be fine.

I mean look at our country right now. (If you live in the U.S., but this works for most countries out there, right?) This game couldn't possibly be worse than what you're experiencing in the real world. Right?

In the end, overall, I'd say you should buy this game. It will add to your collection. Sad that they didn't add achievements to this game. It would have been easy. If you play all the way through, you get an achievement. If you play it through a second time, you get another achievement. Maybe just have ten achievements for playing through each time?

I don't know how well I did. I don't know how to play this game. I'm not sure anything I did had any impact on the outcome of the game.

And I'm okay with that.",1556245664,1556245664,True,12,1,0.605951309204101563,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Designed by Mel Croucher with production work made at the Automata UK which is a defunct game company that was based in the UK. Describing the plot for this game is a little tricky. The main objective of this game is not about stradegy or seeking the highest score. Instead this game's plot is a meaning of life like story done in an interactive narrative gameplay. The title ""Deus Ex Machina"" is latin for ""god from the machine"". The phrase is often used for stories of unpredictable porposions that can only be concluded as an act of god. Throughout the game, you view the creation and evolution of a being known as a ""defect"". The story was based on the ""Seven Ages of Man"" from Shakespeare play ""As You Like It"". Various sequences occurs that involve trippy visuals and a collection of voice over narrations of philosophical quotes. One of the voice actors is Jon Pertwee, the third Doctor Who himself. While Mel Croacher the game designer did the voice of the defect itself.

Upon release this game, it received critical acclaim but distribution for this game was only avalible via mail order. Meaning it wasn't sold at stores so the only exposure it had was through magazine ads at the time. Despite that, the game generated a cult following over the decades and was even listed in the book ""1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die"".

The projectiles seem more unfair. None of this is game breaking because you can't really lose or win this game. You just experience it.

The remastered version and in-game commentary are cool. I prefer the abstract expression of the original visuals, but being able to play it both ways adds value. And for $5 why not?

Вероятно, Deus Ex Machina – это самая неординарная игра, с которой мне довелось ознакомиться.

Созданная писателем Мелом Краучером, и изданная Automata UK на ZX Spectrum в 1984 году, эта игра получила кучу положительных отзывов от потребителей и в 1985 году ей дали номинацию «Game Of The Year 1985».

Игра представляется как арт-объект, как эксперимент, где игрок больше наблюдатель, чем непосредственный участник процесса. Игра, которая затрагивает многие философские, теологические и антропологические вопросы.

Сюжет повествует о далеком будущем, где люди выращиваются в инкубаторах, рождаются, живут под тотальным контролем государства (можно провести некие параллели с романом «1984»). Собственно, игрок в процессе прохождения лицезреет жизненный путь одного из таких людей, от его рождения, до самой смерти, выполняя по ходу его жизни различные простенькие задания.

Deus Ex Machina нельзя назвать полноценной игрой. Как я уже говорил это больше арт-эксперимент, как рассказ, где как от хорошего вина остается приятное послевкусие.

Игра включает в себя оригинальную версию 1984 года, ремастер, оцифрованный саундтрек, книгу и артбук.

Сложно сказать кому сейчас можно рекомендовать эту игру, т.к с одной стороны она необычна, неординарна, с другой, все же сейчас есть куча других более интересных проектов в Стим.

However, instead I'd rather think of it as a piece of art and what does art do? 

Well, art tries to make us think, tries to convey a message to the person observing it. Deus Ex Machina does this through either simple 8bit graphics of the very first iteration or with an enhanced Retina version. In both cases the graphics serve their purpose, which is to give you something to look at, a context if you will and setting the stage for what it has to say. Which brings us then to how Deus Ex Machina does this. It comes from it's soundtrack. The songs reinforce the message the graphics try to depict. It melds sound and form to tell you a story. A story about life, in which (as it is with us all) always has the same end. The “score” you get in it is less important than understanding what it has to say. 

So what is it all about? It's about the “game” then of life itself. ;)
