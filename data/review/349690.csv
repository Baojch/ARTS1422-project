This game fixes almost every problem I had with Satazius, Wolflame and Zangeki Warp, and proves itself as one of the most fun shmups I've played so far, despite being very short.

From the very first level, it is apparent that the devs paid more attention to the design of their game. There are no random hazards suddenly moving around or appearing from inside the terrain like Satazius and Zangeki Warp, and there are no fast projectiles hitting you out of nowhere and no one hit deaths like Wolflame. Armed Seven does not look for every unfair opportunity to punish you and artificially increase its difficulty and length. In fact, while the game is challenging enough, it is surprisingly generous towards the player and offers help in the form of weapon and shield powerups when you need them the most, but does not overdo it.

It is also worth mentioning the game's proper usage of audiovisual clues to inform you of stuff that happens behind the carnage, so you can divert all of your attention on the battle. Some of the enemies' attacks have wind up animations, allowing you to get out of the way before it's too late. Or whenever your charge attack is ready, the game plays a unique sound effect in addition to a visible flash on your mech, properly letting you know when to unleash it without the need to constantly look at the bar on the bottom of the screen. There are still times when there's little time to react to a projectile, but those are easily manageable with a bit of memorization as the game is very short (about 20 minutes a run).

The improvements do not end here though, as the game also has some small quality of life features as well. For example, All of the projectiles originating from bosses will immediately purge upon their annihilation, preventing you from accidentally hitting a stray projectile after a victory (an issue present in Wolflame). Or your mech's hitpoint starts to glow with a green color when enemy projectiles get near it, reminding you of where you are vulnerable while also allowing for precise movement.

However, despite all of my praises, I do have some gripes with Armed Seven as well. For starters, I really don't get the point of the targeting system; something that can be considered a nitpick on my part. Your mech's weapon starts to tilt upwards and downwards while moving, and shooting the weapon locks it in its place until you let go of the button. While this allows you to hit targets without being right in front of them, I find it to be mostly useless because of the game's tendency to become a mini bullet hell at times. I personally find it way more comfortable to fire the weapon in a traditional way.

The weapon system has some questionable design choices too. First, some of the weapons such as the Napalm Launcher and Pile Bunker are highly situational and mostly useful against bosses rather than crowd control, effectively making them not a good choice for higher difficulties. Second, some weapon combos don't make much sense. Armed Seven lets you pick your loadout and the better the normal weapons are, the longer it takes for your powerful charge weapon to get ready for usage. That is why I fail to understand how the hell the beam cannon charges much faster while using the spread shot in comparison to the normal shot. Spread shot is much superior to normal shot because of higher crowd control ability and should be considered more powerful!

My next critique of the game is also a bit nitpick-y, but the game's visual clarity takes a nosedive when there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen and it becomes kinda hard to see some of the projectiles and react to them. The penultimate level is a good example for this, as the amount of enemies, projectiles and explosions are significantly higher than the rest of the game.



Overall, I highly recommend playing Armed Seven to any shmup fan out there as long as they can deal with some of its technical shortcomings (lack of a pause button, Esc closing the game, etc.) and put in multiple runs to compensate for its short length.",1683704963,1683704963,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Among them, Armed Seven is one of my favorites. Maybe I'm a sucker for games that let me pilot giant robot mechs.

Unlike the other giant mech games of Astro Port (Giant Army, MechaBlaze), Armed Seven is a horizontal scrolling shmup.  You still pilot a giant robot and get to choose some familiar weapons (assault rifle, spread shot, etc.).  But unlike the more trudging previous titles, your robot flies around blasting enemies. 

At its core, Armed Seven is pretty straight forward.  You have a couple of primary weapons and a secondary weapon tied to a charge meter.  And the charge delay is tied to those weapons.  Your mecha can also take a hit or two depending on your shields in which you can stack up to three. 

Beyond that, you dodge enemy attacks and destroy them to get to the end of level boss.  No real gimmick, not a lot of resource managing.  Just a lot of well-handing movement and shooting. Though, it can take a little time to get used to where your mech's hit box is.

Sometimes I just want a game that's easy pick-up and play.  While allowing me get through a few stages before my lack of skill and practice hits a wall.  Or the whole thing if on easy. And Armed Seven does that.",1681422654,1688500394,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This time we have some sort of mix between previous two. We're piloting one of those cool Japanese battle armors, but gameplay itself will feel more like our usual [b]SHMUP[/b]s. Unlike [b]SATAZIUS[/b], though, you won't need to re-play a certain part of the game if you'll die. You die – you lose life and appear exactly where you were killed. And as much as I liked [b]SATAZIUS[/b] (the need to re-play certain parts totally added to the balance), I can see how many people would love what [b]ASTRO PORT[/b] did in [b]ARMED SEVEN[/b]. There's a bad thing too. And that bad thing is – there's no story anywhere. I mean, I'm one of those people who dislike reading long texts, or listening to the long briefings in [b]SHMUP[/b]s. Actually, that was exactly what I disliked about [b]GIGANTIC ARMY[/b]. Those texts were just... distracting. I like having story in such games in the old school way. As a skippable intro, or in manual. This game doesn't have any and the only story-related thing you'll get is a description on [b]Steam[/b] store page. How cool is that? Well, not cool. Not cool at all. I mean, come on! Even [b]SATAZIUS[/b] had manual in [b]PDF[/b] format! Why being lazy this time?

As the result, [b]ARMED SEVEN[/b] feels a bit uninspired. Just because with it being pretty much the same thing made with the same exact technology (yep, you've got it, low resolution is still a thing), it feels like there was no real need for it. It's also shorter than previous games. Which doesn't  feel good either. Soundtrack is very good, though, design is still solid, the stable FPS adds a lot to the pretty balanced [b]SHMUP[/b] experience and all in all, [b]ARMED SEVEN[/b] is still a pretty nice choice for those who want the real old school experience from Japan.

You still are only susceptible to fire in about 1/3-1/4 of your mechs height to enemy fire and you will have to use that to sneak through some fairly tight windows at times.

All in all the shooting and dodging feels solid, the fact that the game offers you 12 total weapons to choose from (4 across three classes). Primary (laser, assault rifle, spread, smg), secondary (missles or other support fire), and a bomb type attack that varies from a large over the shoulder beam cannon that has a long cool down window but fires for a good bit and deals major damage to all in its path. To a quick beam sword attack that recharges very quickly and allows you to cancel bullets in its attack path. There is also a missle pod, and a napalm rocket that are somewhere in the middle as far as cool down and utility.

メインとサブの組み合わせ次第で、特殊兵器の再使用可能時間が決まります。
強い武装を選ぶと特殊兵器の再使用に時間がかかる感じです。

弱い武装を選択して、特殊兵器を乱射したり、
サブウェポンのボムを選択して、近距離で撃ち込んでボスを即座に倒したり、
遊び方の種類も中々豊富です。
全７ステージで、自機は２発まで耐えるシールド＋残機と、中々の親切設計で、
シールドの回復アイテムも適度に出現します。

このsteamだと値段も安いので、ロボット好き、スプリガンmk2好き、難易度があまり高くないシューティングゲーム好き、

慣れてきたら、近距離や接近してのボム連射で瞬殺したり、
パイルバンカーを使ったりする事も楽しくなってくると思います。

Wait, really? It's another one of these games... Pshaw. Why can't these guys develop a visual novel about a catgirl witch school or something? Instead, this is yet another tale about giant robots and explosions. The world is doomed, only one pilot can save the day, blah blah blah. When is Astroport going to make a game that speaks to me? I can't relate to mechas, but I understand catgirl witches.

Seriously though, this is something that I appreciate about Astroport, they make games that play to their strengths. ARMED SEVEN is a 16 minute game. You start it up, choose your weapons, and attempt to save the world. Aside from being easily-digestible, this shooter is very entertaining. 

What I appreciate the most about this game is that it's so accessible. Upon starting the game, you have a choice of weapons. The capabilities of the main gun, secondary, and charge weapon are clearly explained. While you're liable to have better results with certain weapon combinations, the best measure of your survival is being able to dodge bullets. Each of the four difficulties changes things up nicely, with enemies implementing new and more difficult attacks.

Since this is a 16 minute game, you probably won't fret as much when you lose. There aren't any continues, but the lives and shields are fairly common. However, mastering this game is a very difficult endeavor. Your play has to be close to flawless in order to get the high-score achievements. For example, when your Mech is at maximum shields, you get a huge influx of points over the course of each stage. However, if you take a hit, you're actually knocked down two levels, which means you'll need two shield power-ups to max out again. Most of the stages in this game only have three power-ups. 

The scoring system also revolves around destroying enemies as quickly as possible. Whenever a large battle-cruiser or exceptionally tough mech appears, you'll want to focus on them to get a larger multiplier bonus. Depending on your weapon set-up, this can lead to a multitude of situations. You might even have to put yourself in a disadvantageous position by leaving weaker enemies alive. However, you can't allow yourself to take damage because of the max-shield bonus. These conundrums, alongside the unique weapon-system, give ARMED SEVEN a lot of replay-value.

And...well...that's it. Once again, this is a 16 minute game, there isn't much to talk about. ARMED SEVEN is a very good shootemup, and is sure to entertain fans of the genre. Give it a go sometime.",1456930372,1456939369,True,23,3,0.733324646949768066,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you like difficult shmups then this game is for you.
Easy is do able, normal i can get to the last boss, hard and insane are for the truly gifted players.
You have 3 weapons that you can chose 4 varieties of then its off to 7 levels of bullet hell.
If you die its back to the beginning to do it all over again and the only help is every now and then you can shoot special ships that drop a shield or weapon boost.
You do have ""lives"" but they are more like hits that you'll lost 1 for every hit after you depleted your 2 shields also these hits downgrade your weapon power.
There is also a timer that you may not notice until the last boss where it will tend to run out.

One issue i had was your shoulder glows when your fully powered.
Why is that an issue? well your hitbox is below your shoulder (back of your gun) and when it glows you end up protecting it and not the space below it.",1431069029,1443492582,True,1,0,0.507692337036132813,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Armed Seven is a side on, old-school, doujin shoot-em-up, where you play as a mech defending Earth from the alien hordes laying waste, before leading Earth's armies on the counter attack. It's all set to some bombastic Metal Slug esque music, it's a very assured game. 

While Armed Seven isn't a great looking game what's there is well done. The backgrounds remind me of old Mega Drive games like Streets of Rage, all blurred skyscrapers and distant fires. There's touches of flourish happening in the distance, companions being shot down, an upcoming boss wiping out a few city blocks. Said bosses are creative and themed, the way bosses used to be, they split and change, again harking back to the 16bit era without feeling like yet another indie retro game. 

Gameplay wise Armed Seven isn't quite a bullet hell shooter, nor is it particularly gimmick laden, it's something in between. Your hit box is tiny, particularly in comparison to the size of your mech, and there's certainly something approaching a swarm of bullets on screen at any one time, but it's not that frenetic. The gimmicks come on the form of selectable weapons, before the game starts you get to kit out your ship as you see fit (to a point). I never found much to suit me beyond the defaults, but I do like the homing missiles as a special. The reason to switch and try new things is because you can alter your aim, not unlike Zero Gunner. You can tilt, lock yourself in to shooting upwards or downwards, and if you don't want to deal with that pick a build that does it for you. 

While we might not be talking Dodonpachi levels of bullets there's certainly enough that you'll be pleased your hit box is so small. That said I still took hits from bullets I couldn't see, lost in the background, my outgoing fire and exploding war ships. The health system is interesting. There's pickups to increase your weapon damage and shield, lose all your shield and you'll lose a life, which drops your weapon damage down. It means that your first life can last quite a long time, but staying alive after that requires all the concentration you can muster 

On my first at easy mode I completed Armed Seven on a single credit. It’s not insultingly easy, but it’s certainly eminently doable, especially if you play shooters on a regular basis. The step up to normal is certainly more of a challenge, all of a sudden you’ll be put on the back foot, using everything you’ve got to wrestle back control. It’s where my lack of proficiency at the genre makes me doubt things. I can’t go in to any great detail about the scoring because I simply don’t understand the minutia of it, I can’t comprehend it. It makes me wonder about the game’s difficulty too, is the step up in difficulty evidence of a flaw, something not quite right in the high end of the game, something that is nigh on impossible to get right. Or maybe that I hit a wall with the game on the harder settings less about any tightness of control and refinement and more my lack of ability.

Whatever the answer I do know that I like Armed Seven, Without being overbearing it reminds me of my 16bit childhood in the Sega camp. It’s a fun game, with good ideas, some interesting enemy patterns, and memorable bosses. It lacks something though, a (vague) tightness, something to really mark it out. It’s fun though, and cheap, and considering it’s heritage as a doujin game it’s very well done

They also made Satazius, which... *cough*

Anyway, Armed Seven takes a lot of visual cues from Assault Suits Valken, which was released here as Cybernator for the SNES. However, it's a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up instead of a run-and-gun shooter. Unusually enough for a Japanese shooter, you have a ""life bar"", but it replenishes very slowly and gives a fairly long invincibility period after you're hit, making it essentially a retheme of the one-hit-and-you're-dead mechanics found in much of the genre. As with most shooters, it's fairly short at 7 stages long, but it's fairly difficult and very replayable.

Probably the biggest point of difference this game has from the rest of the genre is the ability to choose your weapons from a choice of four main guns, four subweapons that fire along with your main gun, and one special weapon that requires charging. ""Better"" main weapons cause the special weapon to take longer to charge, so you have to choose whether you want a more effective normal shot or to be able to use your special weapon more often. The major problem I have with this is that many of the weapons seem fairly useless to me, and I generally just end up using the submachinegun as a main weapon, either the rockets or the cluster shot as a subweapon, and either the beam cannon or the guided missile launcher as a special weapon. This isn't quite so bad for normal gameplay, but several of the achievements require you to beat each difficulty mode repeatedly using each of the 12 weapons at least once, so be warned if you care about that.

All in all, it'd be hard for an Astro Port game that isn't Satazius to not earn my recommendation, so Armed Seven gets a thumbs up from me.
