Do you like clunky interfaces? I do not.

And in the end it also has the crappiest gameplay. I'm sorry I cannot refund it, but I sure can have it removed from my account.

This game's single player is horrible and is not worth the price of the game at all. I wasn't looking for a game to play with friends. I was looking into a game that plays well single player. And the fact they need you to sign in to your steam account to prove you have the game to play with other people... That's beyond stupid. This game is bad unless you live in a condensed neighborhood where all your friends live within 4 miles of you. Then you might MIGHT get some enjoyment out of this game. Go get better versions of this game. This is a common genre on Steam and I suggest you look into better ones.

Without online multiplayer this game has you rely on hooking up gamepads and playing with local friends. Not to mention it forces you to create/sync up a steam account. Which can be good but without an online mode this seems rather pointless other than character looks. Main issues is that it's not very user friendly and what if you don't have any local friends? Well you have the AI but that does get boring quick. I'd not recommend it until some sort of online feature is implemented.",1478015012,1494460954,False,11,3,0.41076350212097168,7,True,False,False,False,,,

(game was featured on my Youtube Channel)

now onto the review.



graphics, sound & artstyle

- the graphics & artstyle are neat 8 Bit-esque influence. Although I am growing really weary of this style, it was appreciated especially in the horror aspect of this. There is plenty of gore, and monsters. The sound for this game is AMAZING. I absolutely love the background music, in fact where can I get myself the soundtrack?


gameplay:

- Gameplay of Trap House is something entirely different. With plenty of game modes to choose from. The controls are easy to learn but some game modes are hard to master, and it's that curve that I love. It has some bugs here and there, like the fact that it won't progress to a next round unless pressing ""START"" on a controller or ""TAB"" on the keyboard. 


Whats the price?

- The retail price for this is $14.99 USD, and while I enjoyed the game it don't necessarily believe this is a good price for it. I would have no problem paying $7.50 and as far as even $10.


How many hours estimated?

- Out of this game, an average player will probably get a good 10-15 hours of gameplay with friends, implying they like the singleplayer challenge modes. But for completionists, they can generate 15-23 hours.

Pros/Cons

- Pros: 
'It plays well.
'the artsyle and music are wonderful
'it's a ton of fun with friends
'customization of characters & levels
'GORE GORE GORE
'variety of game modes make for a fun and refreshing experience if you get tiresome of some game modes.
'UP to 8 people can play on one console
'did i mention the music was great?

-Cons
'there are some bugs
'no online mode
'the community is very small
'must sign onto a 3rd party system



Buy it, Wait for it to go on sale, Don't.


-As noted earlier, I believe this game is well worth $10. The $15 margin feels a little offputting, yes a ton of work went into this, one can tell. But it is still just a couch potato co-op game. Maybe if the online aspect of it comes along, and we get new maps here and there from the devs, I'd definately say BUY IT NOW, but for now WAIT FOR IT TO GO ON SALE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Trap House is an 8-bit looking escape a house of traps and zombies type of game. I love the fact that you can make a character and that it allows LOCAL multiplayer but the game desperately needs online play. Another Great thing it has is a Level editor, this makes the game next to endless. The game has upbeat dubstep beats and a few other vintage gaming style instrumentals that arent bad. The Idea of this game was good, escape as best as you can avoiding traps, sounds fun. The game also has other game modes such as Last man standing, Murderball and Dodgesawl adding to more hours of fun.
The game has dark creepy overtones that work very well for it too.
I would say some of the menus and the way it takes forever to load the next round or restart are a downfall. 
I can't stress enough how much this game needs online play.

Final Thoughts:
Overall the game is fun, I did enjoy playing it,  But due to the limitations on no online play, I see it hard for someone to pay $15 for it, If this had online play easily worth it. Without it worth maybe $10.
But Still a good game, would be 10 times better with online play.

Pros:
+ DEATHS, Lots of Deaths.
+ 8 Bit Graphics
+ Local Multiplayer
+ Create a Level and Character Aspects
+ Steam Achievements
+ Controller Support

Cons:
- No Online Play
- No Trading Cards
- $14.99
