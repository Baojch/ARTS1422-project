There's no gameplay, just tapping on the screen.  The game is made to look like you're making interesting decisions as you're presented with a map of a town/village/pathway that has you clicking on various things to collect things which are then consumed when you click on an obstacle, which unlocks more things to click on.  This is so lame and shallow, you could write a script to randomly click the screen and given enough time, it would beat the game.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game features simple, cartoony 2D graphics, of the type you normally expect to see in low effort mobile apps.  3D graphics programming does require a degree of skill and competence and unfortunately not all developers have the budget or talent to deliver this, despite 3D graphics cards hitting the mainstream in the 1990's.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The game only displays in 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio.  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but I wasn't able to find it on the app stores.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes Rescue Team 2 might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Rescue Team 2 has the ridiculous price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  Because this is the kind of game you can just play for free on mobile phones, it's impossible to recommend anyone should pay money for the same experience on Steam.

Collection game from 2011.

After a terrible tornado smashes across an island, it's up to you to save lives, clear debris, repair bridges, put out fires, and provide medical care to civilians.

This part is kept rather simple overall, which is not bad. So beginner friendly. The focus of the very simply designed maps is the path search.
I played through it in six and a half hours straight. You can play against time if you want.
The game is well suited for children.
I can recommend it.

[h1] Rescue Team 2 [/h1]
Sammelspiel von 2011.

Nachdem ein schrecklicher Tornado über eine Inseln gezogen ist, liegt es an dir, Leben zu retten, Trümmer zu beseitigen, Brücken zu reparieren, Brände zu löschen und die Zivilbevölkerung medizinisch zu versorgen. 

Dieser Teil ist insgesamt eher einfach gehalten, was ja nicht schlecht ist. Einsteiger freundlich also. Schwerpunkt der sehr einfach gestalteten Karten ist die Wegsuche.
Ich hab es in sechseinhalb Stunden am Stück durchgespielt. Du kannst gegen die Zeit Spielen wenn du willst.
Das Spiel ist für Kinder gut geeignet. 
Ich kann es empfehlen.

Rescue Team 2 puts you in charge of a team sent to rescue and rebuild islands destroyed by natural causes. You have to achieve objectives per level, with a higher bonus if you finish it before a certain time.

Workers can collect ressources: food, wood, gold and a new one, fuel (used for choppers and boats). They can also repair buildings. Some of them are producing these ressources: diners give food, sawmills give wood, houses give gold and refineries give fuel. Others are objectives. Finally, you have docks and an helipad. Docks are used to save people or to collect floating wood or fish and helipads to save people (yep) and to extinguish fires. Workers can also repair the roads or remove obstacles. If you need more workers, they can be found sometimes trapped on the map.

A new building, apart for the fuel, is also present: hospital. Thanks to it, you can heal citizens or workers that were injured and are blocking the roads. Medics can be stuck too but never injured. Citizens are healed against gold.

A new feature is meteors coming to block your road or to destroy your buildings. Another natural phenomenon destroys your bridges or highways bridges: earthquakes. You're quite warned by it and you have a few seconds to react. However, I've learned that if you're assigning people to go ahead before it's destroyed, the event is delayed for some seconds. I've also noticed that there is a trigger in the level for these events. For example, the docks being repaired triggered the earthquake, meaning that the bridge that you've build just to access them will be destroyed.

As for the first game, the goal of the money collected by finishing a level is to repair your own house.

Like the previous entry, the game is very enjoyable but also challenging as sometimes, you'll be really just in time if you're aiming for a gold statue. It's due to the fact that workers, once they did an action, return to the base, which isn't allowing planning ahead. Each second lost by this simple fact is important. They didn't address this problem in Rescue Team 2, though, the next game did.

Nothing changes from the first game: the graphics are still colorful and nice. The soundtrack is also nice.

Rescue Team 2 isn't still as complex though the new ressource allow a step in difficulty, like the natural events and the injured citizens. But the fact that you can't plan ahead is still being heavy on the gameplay, though I'm pretty sure you can enjoy some of the levels, very hard to finish before losing the gold time. If you've enjoyed Rescue Team, this one will also satisfy you.

As it often happens with similar time managers, the second Rescue Team is so scarce with new ideas that it is more like an expansion to the first game. The levels are weaker and the game is a bit slower, but in the end, it is playable.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
If you enjoyed the first Rescue Team, you will enjoy this sequel as well, since they are pretty much the exact same game. If you did not play it, then you might as well start with this one, because the differences are marginal: both are using the same basic time/resource manager game mechanics of ordering 1-3 workers to collect resources and clear obstacles.

Returning players may find only smaller changes: the game adds a new resource type, but in practise, this only means that finally you use fuel for the rescue vehicles instead of powering them with gold doubloons. Not that you need these vehicles as often, since the task of rescuing injured citizens falls on a new unit type, doctors.

The game has one serious flaw, its level design. The developers struggled to come up with as many new stages as the first game had, so they often resorted to drawing cute pictures with the roads, hoping that the players will not notice how tedious some of those levels get. This issue was almost big enough for me to downvote the game, but in retrospect, Rescue Team 2 still managed to tether on the brink of being adequate.",1494427534,1494427534,True,9,0,0.603181600570678711,1,True,False,False,False,,,

In fünfzig Leveln (leider zehn weniger als im Vorgänger) und damit auch auf fünfzig Karten (und damit auch zehn weniger als im Vorgänger) schicken wir unser Team auf Straßen zu ständig wechselnden Aufträgen. Meist schicken wir zu Beginn zwei Arbeiter los, räumen Baumstämme von der Straße, was Nahrung verbraucht und Holz bringt. Dann reparieren wir ein Gebäude mit dem Holz, das wiederum produziert dann in rhythmischen Abständen Nahrung oder Holz oder Gold. Es gilt Geröll wegzuräumen, Straßen zu reparieren, Brücken wiederherzustellen, Häfen oder Hubschrauberlandeplätze in Schuß zu bringen. Mit dem dann vorhandenen Schiff können wir (je nach Karte) Holz aus dem Wasser fischen, oder Fische aus dem Wasser fischen oder Überlebende aus dem Wasser retten (was alles Gold kostet). Der Hubschrauber kann Feuer löschen oder Überlebende retten. 

Eine paar kleine Änderungen zum Vorgänger gibt es auch, so ist inzwischen etwa Benzin als Ressource notwendig um Hubschrauber zu befeuern. Im Wesentlichen bleibt aber alles beim alten.

Um eine Karte zu gewinnen müssen wir etwa alle Überlebenden retten oder auch alle Edelsteine aufsammeln. Schaffen wir das Ganze möglichst rasch (je nach Karte etwa 2-5 Minuten) erhalten wir Silber- oder Goldpokale. Letzere sind mit etwas Planung und Übersicht zu schaffen, Silber kriegt man eigentlich fast immer, auch ohne sich besonders anzustrengen.

Schwierig ist das Spielchen also nicht. Unterhaltsam aber dafür schon. Die Umsetzung ist sauber, alles funktioniert und  die Level sind nett gebaut. Wie bei allen diesen Spielchen kann man diesem auch einen gewissen Suchtfaktor nicht absprechen. 

Grafisch wirkt Alles simpel aber knuddelig, ebenso verhält es sich mit Musik und Soundeffekten.
