Das Spiel hat den Test der Zeit bestanden und wird immer noch von Spielern auf der ganzen Welt gespielt. 
Es spielt in einer riesigen, prozedural generierten Welt, in der es an jeder Ecke Schätze, Gefahren und Abenteuer gibt. 

Damals war es noch ein ASCII-Spiel.
Es orientiert sich am stärksten an NetHack, und ist nicht auf diesen Moria-, Angband-Zweig, es gehört eher dahinter.
Und es fängt sehr viel schwer mit mehr Rollenspielelementen an als viele andere Rougelikes.
Und es ist erstmal nicht Open Scource.
Es ist das Spiel von Thomas Biskup, und das bleibt es auch.
Das Spiel wird bis heute gepflegt.

Es ist eigentlich das einzige von den großen Roguelikes was nicht OpenScource ist wenn ich das richtig verstanden habe.
Und es ist tatsächlich von einer Person, dann aber mit großem Fleiß und Ehrgeiz über lange Zeit weiterentwickelt.
Ich muss sagen es lohnt sich heute noch da einzutauchen.
Thomas Biskup (a.k.a. ""The Creator"") macht eine Sache ganz krass anders, er macht 1994 ein Roguelike mit einer Welt, mit einem Land.

Und das war zu dieser Zeit jetzt wirklich für diese Art Spiel eine starke Abkehr von dem Grundkonzept.
Es gibt da Städte und Flüsse, und Ozeane, und Tempel und Hügel, und Berge.
Also eine richtige Landkarte über die du da läufst, eher so wie in den früheren ""Ultimas"".
Und es hat nicht diese Aufgabe das du hinabsteigst in ein Verlies, sondern hier bist du auf einer ganzen Welt unterwegs.

Und es hat mehr Story und Interaktion mit der Spielwelt, es gibt Quests die auf unterschiedliche Arten gelöst werden können.
Es ist anspruchsvoll und komplex was die Rollenspielausrichtung angeht.
Dann gibt es Chaos und Mutationen, diese Mutationen sind ein bisschen wie in der Warhammer-Welt.
Die Chaos-Mutationen, du kannst halt Mutationen bekommen und die können dir helfen, deinen Charakter stärker machen.
Sie kann aber auch deinen Charakter schwächer machen, oder mit einem Makel versehen.
Und das gibt hier, weil das eben ein Zufalls-System ist, ein starkes Element von ""Emergent Gameplay"" rein und definiert deinen Charakter stark.
Du kannst mit den Mutationen sozusagen an die Grenze gehen, und sehen das du halt immer wieder welche kriegst die dich mächtig machen. 
Bis zur einen die zuviel ist, die macht dann den ganzen Charakter nutzlos.
Das ist ein sehr starkes Konzept was den Charakter definiert.
Das Spiel hat ""Permadeath"", also geht es sehr stark um Entscheidungskonsistenz.
Das ist ja auch das was einen in manch modernen Spielen begnet.
Das manche Spiele versuchen das herzustellen beim Spieler.
Das du halt nämlich nicht, wenn du siehst `ah der blaue Trank den ich ausprobiert habe ist tödlich oder gefährlich, neu lädst und diesmal den blaun Trank nicht trinkst und wegwirfst.
Und das ist ja auch das was heutzutage noch manche Spiele haben.
Du machst eine Entscheidung, du gehst links, du gehst rechts, führst die Entscheidung durch, siehst welche Entscheidung besser ist und lädsts neu, machst gleich die richtigen Entscheidungen.
Das heisst du spielst das Spiel mit `Savegames`, spielst du halt durch mit einer Kette von richtiger Entscheidungen theoretisch, weil deine ganzen Fehlentscheidungen im Nichts landen.
Und hier musst du wenn du es im harten ""Roguelike-Modus"" spielst, mit deinen Entscheidungen leben und gucken das du sie wieder in gute Entscheidungen verwandelst.
Die Erfolge im klassischen ""Roguelike-Modus"" bei ADOM sind so triumphal, weil sie so hart erarbeitet werden müssen.
Es ist in dieser Steam-Deluxe-Version auch möglich das Spiel mit wiederladbaren ""Savegames"" zu spielen, doch dabei lernst du schlechte Taktiken und bekommst auch keine Àchievements"", oder du lernst überhaupt nie und schießt dir damit im Endeffekt ins Knie. 
Dann spielst du zwar die perfekte Partie, aber mit schlechten Strategien. 
Weil du ja auch einfach durch wiederholen und wiederholen usw., also dadurch das du ja manchmal einfach nur den Zufall optimierst, durch das Spiel durchkommst.
Dann lernst du aber halt schlechte Dinge !
Das ""Perma-Death"" ist auch deswegen so spannend, nicht nur weil es diese Persistenz der Entscheidungen erzwingt, sondern auch weil es das ""Lernen"" erzwingt. 
Was das Spiel nämlich eigentlich möchte, ist das du gute Strategien erlernst durch wiederholtes Scheitern.",1708872457,1708872457,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,False,False,False,True,,,

TOP FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️ Dungeon crawling.

THE UNIQUES:
💎 All time classic.
💎 So many ways to play this game.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼 Dungeon Crawler.
💼 Roguelike.
💼 CRPG.

PROS:
+ Extremely lengthy (a lot of exploration and trial&error required).
+ In-depth gameplay.
+ Requires quite a bit of planning and thinking.
+ Very challenging but rewarding.

CONS:
- Quite hostile to new players/very steep learning curve
- Once you die, you die and that's it (in almost every case). That can be off putting, especially if you put 25 hours+ in a single character
- Sometimes very random, you can get into some really unfair situations

VERDICT:
This is the type of game you pour your heart and soul into and still don't feel like you've gotten any closer to your goal, for most people, that sounds like a living hell, and trust me... it is. But this game gives you a continuous motion to keep playing. Sure, the some situation are a complete joke but if you manage to push yourself through those situations. There's a sense of achievement.

Just don't die at a high level, that will just leave you angry.
Total Score = 69/100.

GAMEPLAY:
The player's goal is to stop the forces of Chaos that invade the world of Ancardia. The game has been identified as one of the ""major roguelikes"". Most dungeons are procedurally generated, but once the game generates a dungeon, it does not change even if the player exits and re-enters it.

The game can and has ended two of my runs by throwing invisible enemies at me very early in the game (before level 7). This was a point where I had no chance of being able to detect invisible creatures, and thus was completely incapable of defending myself as they chased me through the dungeon and killed me. And at the time of writing this review, I recently encountered a floor where a seemingly endless horde of monsters had the power to NOCLIP THROUGH THE WALLS in order to surround and massacre me.

The in game information page is not very intuitive when it comes to searching the information you want, nor does it provide anywhere near as much details as it should. I have no idea what these additional numbers next to my equipment (such as Armor) means, because it doesn't explain it in game.

Also, spells have a finite amount of times you can use them before you [b]permanently forget them[/b] and then have to go searching through towns and dungeons hoping that you randomly find a copy of the tome so you can relearn it again. So if you were planning to roll up a spell caster class, you probably want to pick one of the races that levels up quickly, and grab the traits that increase your XP gain; because grinding is actively detrimental for you.

If you're playing a Weaponsmith, you won't be able to use your class abilities until you find a Forge, which you probably won't do on your first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or even sixth attempt, because most forges are randomly spawned into dungeons. The only one I can reliably point you to is in Dwarf town, somewhere around level 9-11 of the Caverns of Chaos. Even then, the guy running the forge charges you 2,500 gold every time you use it.

But that's probably not as bad as the Necromancer, who can't even raise their weakest type of undead minions until they hit level 16. I've been playing this game for a few days now, and I've just barely managed to reach level 12, even in the Personalized mode which lets you reload saves when you die. Even worse, creating undead drains your mana attribute [b]permanently.[/b] Well, technically, the game says your mana will regenerate over time, but makes it explicitly clear that this takes a very long time to do.

I'm sure there are other problems with the game I have yet to find in the few days I've been playing. But I'll say that to top it all off, the game seems to be deserted. The forums have been dead since I got here, with the latest posts being from months ago with nobody else seeming to be replying to them.

The new ADOM is really just the old ADOM, but this time with graphics. And while the graphics are actually quite nice, it doesn't change the fact that the game is almost 30 years old. Roguelikes and roguelites have come a long way since, but the ADOM remake insists on still using the same obtuse and antiquated mechanics of the original.

Legendary Roguelike that did better job at being roguelike than actual Rogue. And now with very nice graphics.
So why thumbs down?

Well.
ADOM itself is like a 30 years old game by now. When it first came out it was better than anything else by a long shot.
Sure, there was no graphics. But there was on overworld, there were quests, there was smithing, there were character classes and skills and stats. There were multiple items with variable bonuses. Alignment system, food system - you name it.
By 90s standard ADOM was one of the most advanced games around, and I kid you not.

And this is the problem with this game, exactly. It was advanced by 90s standards. While the pretty graphics is surely a great thing and it does wonders for enriching your experience, everything else is still in 90s.

The game system did not evolved with Steam release. Graphics aside it is almost exactly as it was back then, and even back then, there were issues with it.

So, it is not really an open world game. Surface world is pretty much identical and very limited in scope.
Dungeons are also quite limited in scope and levels are quite small. Except of Infinite Dungeon, which has a bunch of problems on its own, like lack of extra features, there is surprisingly little variety to them dungeons except of few (always the same) unique locations.
Then there is food, which goes down faster if you wear artifacts, for example, and corpses sometimes grant you bonuses or negatives.
Then there are quests, some of which are mutually exclusive for no reason (like starting village quests, where you can have one but not the other). Then there is Danger Level that increases difficulty of dungeons by spawning stronger monsters. Then there is a level limit (Player Character is the only monster in the game with said limit).

This all sounds cool, but there are dungeons that do not spawn if you don't have quests for them. So if the quests are mutually exclusive... you don't get dungeons! And level limit being pretty hardcore and not applying to enemies means that you can easily run into trouble (namely monsters that instakill you, who are not 'special' monsters, just overpowered versions of regular ones).
Then there is totally random loot, so you never know what you will get and when you will get it. Then there are random item destroying effects, sometimes when you would least expect it, occasionally targeting your unique loot (not named but very rare drops that you need for game progression).
And there is no reloading savegames if you fail (unless you want to play with no achievements or save scum). So you don't learn from your failure, you just have to start over.

Generally speaking, the game does not play that well as it did almost 30 years ago. Lack of any in-game information related to many mechanics, for example eating corpses of monsters doesn't give you a note in Monster Memory about the corpse effects, inability to inspect items to show their proper descriptions (you need to cast a spell for that and even then you are not always sure what it does), lack of proper crafting system, lack of proper shops, lack of proper alchemy, lack of proper herbalism/gardening, lack of proper enchanting etc.

I'll be blunt. Having to constantly check online pages just for the information that should be available somewhere ingame is not fun. No, really, it is not.

The worst part of ADOM however is... it is repeteable. I know, sounds strange if RNG is such a big deal, but... does not matter what character you play, really, you usually aim at the similar set of gear, similar set of unique items, similar set of end-game conditions.
Ending may have few variations, but the road to these variations is quite similar.

And this is the problem I have with ADOM, playing it again that many years later: after RimWorld and Masterwork Dwarf Fortress, where with tons of mods these games could really captivate my attention for months at a time (sometimes I spent a week just generating the 'right' world in DF), ADOM does not do that. I know what to expect and when, RNG just affects if I maybe get that sooner or later. It's just the same thing every time.

My thumbs down is therefore a warning for returning players: I've expected more from Steam release, at least few more dungeons for example. A new village with an altar and smithy. Something, anything. If you are like me and you have beaten the Chaos God decades ago already, you may not neccesarilly want to ruin your old memories. If you are new player who never played ADOM before... go ahead and grab it.

The more I play games that are either updated versions of ASCII classics or grandfathers of modern genres (or, in the case of something such as Dwarf Fortress, both), the more I keep people talking about how ADOM is as good as it gets with the roguelike genre or other classic ASCII-based games.

So, upon seeing it on sale on Steam, I decided to pick it up - and I both wholeheartedly agree with the people who love this game and the people who despise it.

I could go on about lots of different problems I have with this game. The fact that ""Standard Mode"" literally is not the standard mode of play (actually, it hides multiple major aspects of character building that you NEED to metagame to have a successful run). The fact that the tutorial, while a good starting point, needs to be expanded upon greatly. The fact that you HAVE to experiment in order to understand what's going on with unexplained items and systems, and in doing so can just... kill your own run.

But what is the greatest flaw of this game? For me, it's the fact that you are borderline forced into metagaming ADOM. If you don't follow a specific order of steps (depending on which of the like, 3 ""viable"" builds you're going for) your run will FAIL. PERIOD. There is very little room for experimentation, or testing out fun new strategies, or anything that most other roguelikes have.

The randomness of ADOM isn't what drives the player forward to victory; it's what you're supposed to overcome. There's not really any ""boon"" that I see with the randomness of this game - it's literally all roadblocks preventing victory. I don't understand where the ""fun"" is in that department.

""Losing is fun"" only works when the player has felt agency with their actions. ADOM makes me nothing but frustrated at an archaic, needlessly hard system that punishes ingenuity and creativity. Where's the fun in that?",1693543460,1693543460,False,16,0,0.582586765289306641,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The Steam version provides several quality of life improvements, such as graphic tiles, tutorials, character and game mode customization, roguelite features such exploration mode (start with a Wand of Wishing), turn off permadeath (very handy to become familiar with the game), easier & harder modifiers (monster health, drops), and a bit of new content (when compared to the last version before Steam). It still has the ASCII mode for people that are already familiar with it, which also has some small improvements (like monster  health bar). 

If you are into roguelikes, you already know ADOM! Returning players will enjoy the facelift, fixes, and a bit of new content.

For new players, the graphical mode makes the game much more accessible, along with (some) added tutorials and references (along with the noted quality of life improvements).

I would recommend disabling permadeath if you want to get to know and experience more of the game first (that is what I did 2 decades ago with a small shell script :P); but as with all roguelikes, the true experience is in the possibility of certain death at any time.

With all of that said, you should still be warned, this is one of the original granddaddies of the genre!

A contrast this with Dark Souls and the other Soulslike games, which I played a similar amount of time  but left a warm feeling in my heart.

Still, I can recommend this game, but only with huge caveats. What I dislike might not be an irritant for you.

This is an old school roguelike game with a heritage from a different era. An era when masochism in gaming was a virtue. An era when finishing the game, perhaps, was not really the goal, but playing it regularly for years, perhaps, was. See, back then there weren't many games to play. If a game took 50 hours to play through and that was that, it wasn't really all that satisfying because, well, what other game were you going to play next? If a game took hundreds or thousands of hours? That game could become your favorite game to learn and master. Different times.

Maybe look at it this way: with games like Chess, Backgammon, any card game, etc., the point is an enjoyable pastime. Back in the 80s and 90s there were games attempting to be pastimes and not necessarily games that you played through and ""won"" and moved on from. This is one such game.

Do you like to fail a lot? Do you like to lose tens of hours of progress to stupid mistakes? Do you like death by RNG? Do you have no life? If so, you might like this game.

The game is not supported any longer. The developer has gone dark for many years, with the last blog post on their development website saying essentially ""well, I'm now a VP of IT at my company and have less time so I'm going to focus on my other new game -- Ultimate ADOM."" Ultimate ADOM has also gone dark, so you get the picture. An indie developer has gone dark. It happens, and I understand it. The developer tried and the games didn't take off, and he now needs to make a reliable living. Anyway, if on Linux you'll have to search around steam forums for a binary patch against the executable to get menus to display properly. The game doesn't work under Wine.

The game does have an active wiki, and even active players today, an a slightly active discord, etc., all of whom seem to be long time players for whom the game clicks with. There are some easier class/race combinations and some combinations best left to experts and true masochists. There is a well maintained wiki, and active discussions. People can speed run the game in a few hours but you will likely take dozens and dozens.

You gain power in this game primarily through items. Finding a great artifact weapon can mean that you ""should"" win the game. Secondarily, power is gained through leveling and stats. There are many interactions where simply your stat or level difference is a big part of the dice roll.

Secondarily, the above is a lie. You gain power in this game by learning the game yourself. Which enemies are safe to engage without much cause for concern,  and which ones have insta-death attacks? If you don't spoil yourself by checking the wiki for every encounter you're likely to need dozens and dozens of attempts to ""win"" the game. Also, good luck piecing together the many different quests and story lines without the wiki.

The user interface for this game is bad. It was developed in an era where everybody used full 101 layout keyboards with a number pad. Diagonal movement is accomplished by pressing the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.  Also, you might also think that ""quitting"" meant ""quit the game"" -- and it does -- but not in the way you think. Simply pressing ""Q"" and answering yes effectively has your character commit suicide and DELETES YOUR SAVES. No confirmation beyond pressing ""y"" at the ""Quit the game?"" prompt. What you want is ""Save"" -- press ""S"" followed by ""y"" instead, and ""Save"" also quits the game in the way most everybody would expect.  I've lost two characters with tens of hours invested to simply pressing Q and answering yes without thinking much about it.

The game is full of little and big paper cuts like this. Some might consider this its charm, others like me might just call it unrefined and ultimately very annoying. 

A possible saving grace is that the Steam version includes a ""standard"" mode that retains save files on death. You do not get any Steam achievements playing this way, though. You can even play with ""personalized"" settings that make the game easier in various ways.",1684072039,1684072220,True,26,0,0.670891225337982178,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Some things are good, some things are very bad.  About the game... this is a 1990's era ripoff of Rogue/Hack, but the developers kept on improving it by adding GUI skins and primitive 2D graphics to support the experience.  Like the Rogue/Hack games this is unabashedly ripping off, it's a Dungeons and Dragons like derivative RPG where you wander around the wilderness, dungeons, bash stuff up and die horribly to RNG.  More on the problems of RNG centric design later on.  You do get a huge array of different character classes, races, spells, abilities and so on, so you can build all kinds of gnarly characters and this is a plus.  It's a shame then that there's also design deficiencies that will (and have) deterred many gamers.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

When you try for the best looking graphics, you'll find there's no options to change the resolution for the game (beyond fullscreen or window) and no meaningful ways to customise the graphics settings when you choose the graphical tileset modes.  All you can do is opt for the original ASCII style DOS character ""art"" the game originally had, which obviously removes the graphics.  Of course gamers will eschew that, but in the tileset mode there's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.

The game tileset mode features simple, cartoony 2D graphics, of the type you normally expect to see in low effort mobile apps, and if you don't want those you have even less choice, you have to go back to pre-1990's standards.  I'm aware that in this case it's because this is a game from the 1990's... but it's not 1993 anymore.  It's 2023.  There's more competition for gamers time than ever before.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The game features no proper overarching level design or game/story flow/plot, as they opted to try to use samey repetitive procgen algorithms as a substitute for adding such content to the game, to avoid doing the important job of level/map design.  As a result, the game doesn't actually have any content worth mentioning, just endless, boring, repetitive, soulless algorithmically generated sameyness.  Developers must learn that procedural generation is not an acceptable substitute for content.  Once more I know that's because this is a ripoff of Hack/Rogue, but if those games came out today, they'd die in a miserable, lonely heap.  It's not the 1990's anymore.  Games like Mass Effect and Baldurs Gate happened.  Content is king. 

Despite being a single player game, the developer infested the game with an anti-cheat.  That's unnecessary and quite an annoyance. 

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Like I said this is a difficult review because this is one of the best Rogue/Hack ripoffs out there... but you can also see it does carry a lot of defects (in fairness, some of which are just from the ancient, outdated and obsolete game concept).  While it's a labour of love, it doesn't compare well to cheaper AAA games on Steam.  If you had to tell a gamer with $15 and his first bleeding edge gaming rig to choose between a 30 year old Hack ripoff that doesn't even have 3D graphics, and a game like Skyrim or The Witcher (and some change left over if they buy both on sale), what are you going to tell them?

ADOM (Ancient Domains Of Mystery) didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for playing the game long enough to die (pretty easy due to Rogue/Hack RNG), and only around 35 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game on Steam.

Once more we see greedy devs trying to scam Steam gamers. On Steam, this is $15 USD, but it's free to play if you go to their website and download it.  The Steam version has just a couple of somewhat irrelevant features that don't come close to justifying this price gouge.  Remember, you can get Skyrim or a Witcher game for less than $15... so what are the developers playing at here?  Developers must learn Steam gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a whopping $15 for a free game just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for Steam gamers.  If you really want to play this after all is said and done, don't buy it on Steam, just download the free version, but you have better alternatives.",1673160530,1673160530,False,6,5,0.299244105815887451,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Skip this game if you're not interested in grinding your face against someone else's idea of ""you must suffer to have a good time.""

Googling indicates this game has anti-cheating mechanisms in place, which have no place whatsoever in a singleplayer game, not even if it does have some kind of online leaderboard. I started a game with a character who had godlike stats, but even the [b]first[/b] dungeon - the Puppy Dungeon, where you go to find a [i]lost dog[/i], was absolutely [u]filled[/u] with [i]absurd[/i] numbers of monsters, that kept getting tougher and tougher, until I got dumpstered by something that moved like greased lightning, Corrupted on hit, and tore my character (who had gone from level 2 to level 10 beating her way through that dungeon) apart in like two hits. So either that was the anti-cheat wasting my time, or it was some kind of Oblivion-style monster-escalation wasting my time.

Also, I chose to make a Dwarven Weaponsmith, thinking that I would be able to make my own equipment. I started with a 1,000-stone anvil in my inventory, but (a) there is actually no item-crafting system, only item-improvement, and (b) even though you have an anvil, you need to find a forge, and the only guaranteed forges one will find either charge a mind-blowing quantity of gold to use, or are in dangerous locations, leaving you with hoping that you find one, at random, in a dungeon, which is also a dangerous location.

本作是將 1994 年的 ADOM 圖像化後的 D&D 類型遊戲。可以選擇的種族與職業非常多樣，技能種類也頗為豐富。個人沒有經歷過舊版遊戲的年代，但這款遊戲該有的 D&D 要素都有。骰子機制被隱藏在遊戲背後的邏輯運算，沒有顯示出來，這點就見仁見智。語言只有英文，不過只要你能看懂遊戲常見的單字，基本上玩起來沒什麼障礙。

然而，遊戲缺點非常多。首先， UI 操作也非常不直覺，遊戲中的各種功能被分配在鍵盤上莫名其妙的位置，完全沒有經過優化和統合。角色中毒難解，補血方式不夠方便。蟻穴無限量產螞蟻，放著不管螞蟻又會破壞地下城牆壁，強迫症玩家難以接受。掉落的裝備有 10% 機率帶有詛咒，裝備後無法脫下，但是只有當玩家脫下裝備時才知道該裝備是否帶有詛咒，非常噁心人。遊戲成就必須玩 HARD 難度才能解鎖，但是 HARD 難度又非常容易死亡，這導致我每打完一兩場戰鬥就必須備份存檔。

[h2][b]總結[/b][/h2]
有鑿於以上的缺點，個人不推薦本作給一般玩家，但如果你是喜歡 D&D 的硬核玩家，可以嘗試看看。建議入包或骨折價入手。

If I'd get a real wish, I would wish that these playing hours weren't just the tip of the iceberg of my playing hours before Steam release. Soooo, If you wanna get married to a game, get this. It gets personal real fast.

I know, the interface is horrible and it might not feel worth it to learn it since there is so many better options these days for games like these. Personally, for me it was easy because back in the day I had this 486 PC which was slow as ass and barely ran Duke Nukem 3D on the lowest settings. This game quickly became my Baldur's Gate out of scarcity basically. Still, after all these years I still play it, not out of nostalgia, but for the real challenge and the will to beat it. I am still looking forward to seeing those other endings myself.

Just keep in mind that there is a free version of this game with graphics and sounds on the ADOM-website. There's of course the ASCII version as well if you just want to see the world burn. Or if you are a true nihilist world ender, you can also find all old versions of the game there as well, which don't have any quality of life improvements.

There are a lot of typos in the instructions/help/dialogue, and it is distracting.

The *default* control scheme is needlessly redundant and overly complicated.

The UI/HUD is overly large while the map initially/oftentimes is surprisingly tiny, even in 1080p on a 90+ inch screen.

The tutorials tell you to read the How To Start section of the manual, but make this particular section of the manual annoyingly tough to locate.

The game seems to function horribly on Steam Deck in the five minutes I spent with it there. Half of the text is unreadable due to its coloration or its size. And the controls rear their ugly head yet again.

ADOM HD Deluxe is not different enough from better games in the genre (such as Caves Of Qud, primarily) to justify its price tag, despite being on sale for half-off at my time of purchase. If you yourself have even one traditional roguelike in your library (Caves Of Qud, Tales Of Maj'eyal, Tangledeep, Dungeonmans, One Way Heroics, Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, etc., even things like Desktop Dungeons and Sproggiwood), don't bother with this one.

Freed from the need to animate everything, the game is able to provide complex, challenging, and at times bizarre levels of detailed interaction. It's got a broad scope, allowing you to range across a whole country filled with challenges and areas to explore. It's got a wide range of classes and races that you can mix and match and intriguing mechanics like farming, multi-ending quests, alignment effects, sacrificial altars, and background corruption. 

ADOM includes a wide variety of ""challenge"" endings as well; I've beaten the game several times, in different ways each time. It's role-playing tilted enough to let you really feel that you've built a character who is a person, and strategic enough that you have to make tough choices about what to pursue and when to go after it.

Механика голода не нужна, вы просто ходите и жрете трупы врагов, любые пайки стоят копейки, скилл ""готовки"" не нужен, нет никаких рецептов блюд или вроде того, просто превращение гнилого трупа в жаренный труп, который гниет дольше.

Любые союзники(саммоны, миньёны некромантов, просто рекруты и т.д.) просто следуют за вами, они НЕ атакуют врагов, для этого им нужно отдать приказ, а для этого вам нужно нажать 4-5 РАЗЛИЧНЫХ кнопок и два раза навести мышку(сначала на того кому приказываете, а затем на место или врага) и так вы ОБЯЗАНЫ делать для КАЖДОГО рекрута/миньена/пета. Сами же миньены перестают следовать за вами если теряют вас из вида(что в данже происходит каждые 5 ходов), а переходят на иные этажи с вами ТОЛЬКО если стоят вплотную к вам. 
Также, если ваша скорость не дай бог становиться хоть немного выше дефолтной, можете смело забивать на игру через миньенов, они за вами просто перестанут следовать.

Теперь о магии. У любого заклинания по неведомой причине ограничено кол-во кастов, так что вместе с маной(PP) вы будете терять и ""заряды"" заклинания. Восполнять эти заряды можно прочтением того же тома, из которого вы это заклинание и выучили, вот только по какой-то РЕАЛЬНО НЕВЕДОМОЙ причине тома ТОЖЕ имеют ограниченные заряды. Также, книги по какой-то причине весят как полноценные тела гуманойдов, ну да ладно.

Автолевелинг. Мобы всегда сильнее вас(в плане лвл), как минимум такого же лвла в ранних данжах для новичков, конечно есть различного рода эксплойты, но обычно люди не хотят таким заниматься. Прибавляем к этому ещё тот факт что игрок ограничен 50 лвлом, а мобы могут поднимать уровни бесконечно.

Скорость респавна мобов. Сама по себе механика бесконечного респавна врагов нормально вписывается в игру, в которой куча искусственных ограничений, вот только в большинстве данжей последние этажи принято ознаменовывать резким поднятием сложности, само по себе это минусом не является, но иногда скорость респавна поднимают настолько, что некоторые данжи из-за своей корридорности становятся непроходимыми БУКВАЛЬНО, иногда мобы заполоняют каждый тайл корридора и респавняться быстрее чем вы их убиваете(даже если вы их ваншотаете), хорошо если такая пробка образовалась только с одной стороны корридора, но обычно вас просто запирает в толпе бесконечно респавнящихся мобов.

Поиграйте лучше в более современные роуглайки, благо выбор есть.

(insanity).  It scratches the itch of a dungeon crawler but I would advise to read guides online.   I never finished the game (close) but just got to be a slogfest with the levels of ""insanity"" at deeper levels.

The game is meant to be roguelike but I cannot imagine most people playing w/o backing up their save games.  One specific spot in the game that is brutal for any player is their first encounter with a siren.  Unless somehow you are psychic to get some bees wax ear plugs (seriously) - it's an instant death encounter where the expectation is to start all the way from the start?  Absurd.  Too many events like this make not backing up saves foolish.  Other reviews state the fun in discovering things like what foods do by trial and error makes the game.  

Maybe if there wasn't such brutal results most of the time, but these risks are far more negative than the potential for a positive.

Other annoying things are being locked out of content because you didn't get to a dungeon by a certain level.  With ""insanity"" giving you negative traits, one cannot savor the environment and explore or take time to find secrets.

Most will go online and read walkthroughs to  get through the game. W/o doing this there is a better chance a teen will die of old age before completing the game w/o those guides and hints.

[h1]There is currently zero keybind customization in ADOM [i]at all[/i]. Either through config file or in-game settings.[/h1]

From what I understand from reading their forums & the community discussions, the devs removed the capability to customize keybindings via keybindings file or any in-game settings so-as to not ""overwhelm"" RL noobs. Supposedly, at least.

Most games I'm fine learning new schemes, but roguelikes? Nah. That's like giving me an FPS with numpad movement that you don't allow remapping. To me, at least, that's how it feels. I don't have a numpad and I really don't want to roguelike with my mouse. I'll stick with brogue, dcss, tome4, cdda, *band, IA, BAM, TGGW, CoQ, cogmind, ELoNA, etc... etc... or any of the other dozens of roguelikes that support vi keybinds. (I can't even think of another trad RL that I can't at least remap for vi-keys...)

I mean, I can understand why you simplified things, but really, what year is this? How much does it cost from a code-perspective to allow customization? Let us customize our own shit, please. Don't simplify at the cost of regressing things people use, especially for a genre so niche as this one. Keep numpad/mouse as default for laymen. That's totally fine, but don't do so in a way that locks out older fans of the genre that have a hard-ingrained traditional -- very common, even [i]standard[/i] -- preference & flow, please.

Comments enabled in hopes somebody can correct me and tell me it's possible to setup keybinds so I can buy it again and finally give the damn game a go in a way that traditional roguelikes throughout many years have trained me to enjoy.

It's a fine time waster, but after the time I've spent in the game I've yet to make any meaningful headway.

People claiming this as some masterpiece are high out of their mind on nostalgia. This ain't it. For the same cost, you could just play Morrowind, a better game in nearly all regards, with similar dice roll-based mechanics.

I get that it's supposed to be difficult but a quest you get immediately in the game is to kill a boss that is nearly unkillable for low level characters and this boss has a mechanic that will PERMANENTLY gimp any sort of melee combat focused character.

This game's lore may be okay. I didn't get to any of the game's story. But nothing else about it is good. Anyone saying this is good is just nostalgic from their childhood. Which I was ultimately saved from because today is the first time I ever opened this dumpster fire.

If you gave me two options: 1. play this or 2. I would be executed by shotgun blast to the back of the head blindfolded and kneeling in front of a shallow grave....I'd choose the second option.

The graphics aren't THAT bad. I mean mediocrity at it's finest. But then there's these disgusting looking text menus that look like a Commodore 64 literally threw up diarrhea on to your screen that ultimately destroy anything else graphically in the game.

To put it in perspective...i killed myself on purpose DURING the TUTORIAL by drowning, just so I didn't have to play anymore. Ironically my brain and eyeballs felt like they were drowning in the pools of obnoxious sh*tty text colors.

Don't listen to the lies that this game is good. Perhaps 20 years ago this was ballin' like NBA All-Star weekend. But it's aged like a methed out h**ker that's been beaten half to death by the year 1989 while pouring out the bleeding @$$hole of the goatse guy.

I wouldn't open this game again if it were the last game on Earth. I'd rather drink Freon than open this POS. I'd rather Magneto rip all the Iron out of my bloodstream through the pores of my skin than open this. I'd rather get struck by lightning, I'd take a trip in an electric chair with no wet sponge than open this.

Before anyone does the ""git gud"" sh*t...1. I'm never opening this disgusting garbage ever again.(So no.) 2. THE TOP REVIEW IS SOMEONE SAYING ""It took me 20 years to beat this"" with over 1k hours. And I'm not talking crap about that player. Hell dude, 1k hours in this crap chute...wow man, you'd give Mother Theresa a run for her money in the patience department. But literally think about that for a second though, that's not a skill issue. That's Stockholm Syndrome in gaming. A 20 year beat down and still loving the game...Absolutely not happening.

1. 图形和界面表现不佳：
游戏的图形和界面设计较为简陋，缺乏细节和视觉吸引力。游戏的画面质量较低，角色和环境设计显得粗糙，缺乏细腻的纹理和光影效果。此外游戏的界面布局混乱，缺乏清晰的指示和提示，使得玩家在操作时感到困惑。

2. 游戏玩法缺乏创新：
作为一款角色扮演游戏，游戏玩法并未能带来新鲜感，缺乏创新和独特的角色扮演元素。游戏中的任务和谜题设计较为平淡，缺乏挑战性和趣味性。玩家在游戏中需要完成一系列任务，但这些任务的设计缺乏深度和多样性，使得游戏过程显得单调乏味。

3. 故事情节和角色发展薄弱：
故事情节和角色发展较为薄弱，缺乏吸引玩家的元素。游戏中的剧情发展缺乏连贯性，角色之间的互动和对话显得生硬和空洞。玩家在游戏中难以对角色产生共鸣，也无法深入理解角色的动机和背景。

4. 音乐和音效单薄：
游戏的音乐和音效较为单薄，缺乏丰富的背景音乐和生动的音效效果。这使得游戏的整体氛围较为平淡，难以给玩家带来沉浸式的游戏体验。游戏的背景音乐单调乏味，无法衬托游戏的氛围，使得玩家在游戏过程中感到无聊。

5. 技术问题：
在游戏过程中，我遇到了一些技术问题，如游戏崩溃、卡顿等。这些问题严重影响了游戏的整体体验，使得玩家在游戏过程中感到困扰。此外游戏在某些电脑配置上存在兼容性问题，导致游戏无法正常运行。

综上所述，在图形和界面表现、游戏玩法、故事情节、音乐和音效以及技术方面都存在一定的问题。这些问题使得游戏的整体体验较差，难以满足玩家的期待。因此我不推荐这款游戏给广大玩家。希望开发商能在未来的作品中，针对这些问题进行改进，为玩家带来更好的角色扮演游戏体验。",1644770509,1711561984,False,4,0,0.529217541217803955,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Interactions with non-combat NPCs are awkward. The stores are ridiculously primitive, and remind me of something out of EA's Adventure Construction Set for the Commodore 64.
Perma-death and nothing is carried over to your next playthrough. Yes, I know this is a 'modern' innovation, but I can't help wishing for it.

身為可能是臺灣個位數玩hardcore模式全破過的人，我完全承認這不是普通人玩得下去的東西。首先你要習慣英文，遊戲並沒有太偉大的故事，但訊息有很多「眉角」，不要求很高的英文能力，但要能夠習慣。

這是一個你去網路上查各種攻略(還滿多的)，如果沒有真的玩過體驗過，大概也不得其門而入的遊戲。我基本上是用查資料的態度去看各種攻略的。而我也完全不反對看攻略，那是二、三十年的智慧結晶，光是去看網上的各種guide當文獻在k就很有趣了。

這個遊戲的魅力在於世界的豐富性，這種豐富性的體現，倒不是故事還是長長的技能樹與build，而是在於你的所有行動都有很多「眉角」。要類比的話，這並不是那種「靠智力研究出無敵的build」的遊戲，而是像傳統工藝一樣慢慢累積各種小眉角，漸漸提升生存率，漸漸加快遊戲的進行節奏，漸漸知道世界有那些威脅而要準備那些應對手段的遊戲。眉角實在太多，小技巧多到一言難盡，幾乎永遠學不玩。

不過倒不是說新手就完全沒有樂趣，其實一開始不要把破關當成是目標，看能活多久就很好玩了。這個遊戲有一大堆死法是在其他遊戲看不見的，然後玩久了就會經歷過很多非常荒謬的連鎖意外，像是大概所有玩一定時間的人，一定都有施展strength of atlas讓自己背得動一大堆東西，然後法術時效過後沒有注意，於是就被自己的背包壓死這種搞笑的事的。總之這個遊戲要小心的地方非常多，樂趣也在其中。

Steam版的一個好處是有可以S/L的模式，過去是只能用賤招才能存檔的。雖然本格派大概都是玩真實死亡啦。

這個遊戲雖然不是大紅，但也有相當大的社群，其中強者如雲，幾乎永遠可以找到各種你沒想到過的眉角。只是因為語言門檻比較高，然後臺灣這裡只有幾個像我一樣的神經病，說中文的玩家我目前其實除了我的親友之外還沒看過其他人，我自己知道全破過的則只有我而已。如果你想要一個在臺灣「與眾不同」的遊戲體驗，然後有點自虐傾向的話，可以試試這個遊戲。

1. repetitive pressing of multiple keys instead of a hotkey and unable to set behaviors
-additional unnecessary key pressing as well. EG: with only 1 monster on screen, why do i have to keep on selecting the direction i want to pickpocket?
2. auto explore is unoptmized and auto pick up (extremelly unintuitive design) is impossible to customize (eg: you cant make it so your char does not pick something while an enemy is hitting you, thus wasting a turn)
3. there are many situations mutually exclusive and level capped that you do not know about unless you read about it before, making the game impossible to play without a wiki open.

I've always felt, whenever playing, that if this game had, say, a first person perspective and a big team of people working on it, it would be known and enjoyed by way more people.

It's not just the tactical gameplay itself, and the chess-like difficult decisions that have to be made, that make ADOM a gem, but also its story, its lines of obscure philosophy and poetry, a game that makes you wonder, as you strive to get your character to survive, become more powerful, and save the world... or destroy it altogether.

В алом Хаосе все судьбу свою встретили.
Рождены были будто для этого,
Чтоб спасти всех нас от Конца Времён.

Но пророчества нам говорят, из-за гор что спаситель придёт, 
Что мечом, заговором и силой своей в земли мир он вернёт!

Вот так выживет мир, раз желает один, тот, кто правит всея

Древними Владениями Тайны!

Данный продукт очень сильно отличается от того, что сейчас принято называть rogue-like. Сложность зашкаливает, причем сложность эта - стратегическая, а не тактическая: вы должны знать, чего хотите добиться, какие предметы выфармить и для чего. Иначе - Ещё Одна Глупая Смерть. Так почему в это играют даже те, кто осознаёт, что завершение игры им не светит в ближайшем будущем (а может и никогда)? Потому что опыт попытки прохождения ценнее, чем результат. Всё дело в невероятной продуманности механик взаимодействия с подземельями (в отличие от Tales of Maj'Eyal), c его обитателями (врагами, временными нейтралами и торговцами) и необходимости продвижения в глубину Пещер Хаоса на основе того расклада, что есть именно в эту попытку (надеюсь, у вас был план прокачки персонажа...). Нынче версия в Стим обзавелась отличными тайтлами (то есть плиточным графонием, серьезно, это красивейшие тайтлы, которые я видел) и даже недельными онлайн-челленджами на очки. Есть легкий режим для новичков (и даже отдельный режим туториала), и по сравнению с руж-лайк режимом он действительно легкий.",1636046600,1636050896,True,3,0,0.546077907085418701,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You pick it up then you need to pay the merchant but there is no clear way of doing it. He just stands there blocks the door so you can't leave. You talk to him, no option to pay. you give him money, doesn't work. I had to search forums just to figure out how to buy stuff, and I STILL CAN'T!!

[u][b]Not a good game nor a good roguelike, just try something else.[/b][/u]

[u][b]Let's list the cons:[/b][/u]

- [b]The interface is terrible[/b]. I know that the game is originally an ascii game and that the graphics are just a layer put on top of that, and (maybe) that would be acceptable... if this was a sub 5€ purchase... for 15€ this is unacceptable (to me). If you want to ask for that kind of money all parts of the game should be made so they can live in the present era

- The tileset is decent but [b]items are hard to see on the screen[/b] and you often have to watch the ascii minimap. It's not too bad but annoying and unnecessary, a glitter effect for dropped items would be enough to fix this (but I imagine it couldn't be done because of the limits of the game, I guess?)

- [b]The randomization of the floors of the dungeons is boring and uninspired[/b], they always look and feel the same and are not really exciting, I have yet to find interesting secret rooms or weird layouts, it's always the same long corridors with empty small rooms

- Having to solve the same quests in the same order at every replay, makes this feel more like replaying, over and over, again and again, a [b]perma-death single player game[/b] with no saves, more than playing a roguelike (boring dungeon layouts makes this even worse)

- [b]This game feels unfair and unbalanced[/b]. In the other traditional roguelikes I have played I always felt like I learned something after I died. In those games, thinking back on my death it was either: my fault for being too reckless or, I had the solution at hand but didn't think of approaching things that way. In this game I keep on dying and can't see what the solution would have been.

I can see people arguing about this point so let me reiterate:
roguelikes should not be about knowing that precise and unique way to approach things, I should not die because of that monster that one shots me if I don't use that specific tool to fight him, I should still be able to beat him, but at the cost of burning 2 (or so) healing potions to do so. That would make me die later in the game when I need healing potions and I don't have anymore. Then that would make me think back about how to optimize things and burn less resources to do the same things I did but in a better way.
Long story short, [b]roguelikes should be about slow and long term optimization[/b] that comes with knowing the game better over time, not brutal trial and error for inescapable things that can be solved only in a precise way. This is the most important thing that makes this game a bad roguelike in my opinion.

- Linked to the previous point, I never like to look things up for a roguelike, because discovery is the best part of the genre, but in this game I just felt a lot of the time that things made no sense at all and [b]had to look up the wiki a lot[/b]",1627219888,1627219931,False,4,1,0.520377695560455322,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Cons: Once you've got a handle on what you need to do and how you need to play, the depth of the game falls of drastically.

The game is ruthless permadeath survival. I found High Elf Ranger to be the strongest. Prices for the weapon in the shop that are worse than the ones I found are very high. Badly balanced economy. There is also not an easy way to talk to people, as they constantly move and especially equipped with ranged weapon, I shoot them instead of talking, and all their friends attack me immediately. There seems to be no real story, just a few quests. It is mostly about slaying hordes of enemies, sometimes, there are tough opponents, some magical debuffs, requiring us to pray. When we get stunned or dazed, we often get to be surrounded. Enemies spawn in places we cleared the rooms. Dungeons are pretty long and there is one button auto exploration which stops at items or enemies which is cool. So the exploration flows fast and well. The combat is mainly good when you are using arrows instead of mouse, and mouse requires directional kicks. Other than that, inventory is controlled mostly by alphabet and is quite cumbersome to get around, re-equipping the items, some of the items are cursed, preventing me to take them off while they provide me negative stats. I discovered the whole map. It has around a dozen of dungeons with a lot of random encounters which I could easily evade but unless you like grinding, stay away. The game also does not motivate me well enough to fight the same enemies over and over. Replay value is included in a lot of variety between races and classes, giving me different abilities and I seem to be able to learn them from different classes. It is an interesting game but feels aged pretty badly. This would be a mixed preview if it was possible. Not sure how much better can the game get but the first impression is pretty weak.",1626199625,1626199625,False,1,0,0.451989352703094482,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you are interested in the game and it's before August 3rd, 2021, consider picking up the game as part of the current monthly bundle.

This is perhaps the first time I’m talking about a TRUE rogue-like, ADOM was released in 1994, and it is one of the original rogue-likes and one of the best of all time.  I could probably spend an hour telling you why it’s good. 

This is called a deluxe version with more graphical modes beyond just standard ASCII, adding mouse control, multiple difficulty options, and customizations and achievements.  It has all the great gameplay that a roguelike should, a ton of classes, races, and possibilities, and so many different and unique interactions you’ll be able to experience. 

It’s also frighteningly difficult.  Rogue-likes are not intended for one-and-done playthroughs but rather take a lot of constant effort to learn everything you can just hope that the player can one day beat the game with one of their many characters. 

Pick ADOM up if … well if you love true rogue-likes, or want a hard but interesting game. I’m a fan, but I will say that most people probably won’t enjoy this game, it’s a style of game that is not that popular and perhaps never was.  It’s focusing on a far more strategic style of play which is why I talk about rogue-likes and rogue-lites often. 

I’d probably not recommend ADOM to most people even though I am a huge fan of it.  But if you like Rogue, Nethack, or Dwarf Fortress, it’s worth a try, and you can play the free version which includes almost the whole game including the better graphics at the ADOM website. It’s worth a try.

As one of the founding hits of the roguelike genre, ADOM is a game in which you should expect to die often.  In other games that can be a deal-breaker for me, but much of the genius of ADOM is in starting a new character.  ADOM is a game of near infinite variation: 12 truly distinct playable races, 21 classes that vary in play style according to the race and alignment of the character,  dozens of skills and talents that also materially change the play through.

ADOM has been one of my go-to's for more than 20 (30?) years and I still find myself surprised by new and puzzling situations and combats in this sprawling fantasy world every time.

It really doesn't belong in the video game category for me anymore.

The developer states he is unable to beat his own game without cheating, that alone should say enough. 

Aside from a quick tutorial, I did only one run. It lasted about 6 hours and was a pain in the... you know, just no fun at all. If I play I roguelikes I expect to die rather quickly in my first attempts, but still had some fun, learned something unlocked some stuff and are highly motivated to try again. That I game deinstalled right away and there's nothing to unlock anyway. 

Most of the time I was repeating complicated key-combinations over and over again, just to cast a single spell and another one to heal - I mean how hard is it to implement a simple skillbar where you put your most used actions? Even learning spells is complicated, it requires complicated key combinations and/or click sequences, that your character reads the spell book multiple times with a chance of random effects until the book finally disappears. And while you train a spell by using it, you will ""forget"" it at the same time so at some point you have to read a spell book for it again. Totally logical! I also wouldn't be much surprised if you can break your legs if you reading skill is a little too low when trying to read a spell book. 

A good chunk of the time I was looking things up in the wiki to understand what the game was trying to tell me with hints like ""you are doomed!"" or ""you feel you will die soon"". Turned out that I took the wrong way and instead of the early game quest location ended up ina  ""special cave"" where the enymies get stronger as you level up. That atcually was not even a problem at first. I got a powerful spell right from start and could easily wipe out the whole room of monsters that had openend up. And the next one. And the next one too. That got me instantly several levelups for basically doing nothing and that a non-caster class could have mostly likely not achieved.  I had a simple way back and choose to carefully move on - until I learned that the mobs in the dungeons respawn. Infinitly. Yes, totally interessing and logical! I barely made it out due to that fact but got like 5 or 6 levels. That took like 15 minutes of actual gameplay.  For comparison: In a video I saw before on YT, there was a guy saying he beat the game several times and in fact seemed to have quite some knowledge about it. He started a simple fighter, ran directly into a trap that destroyed his weapon and the next whole hour he could do bascially nothing other than running away and failing a starter quest.

For the rest of the time I played, I was in another dungeon, that took very long due to the tedious  controls and the game giving no useful information. I mean fine, there is a statue - what do you do with it? And why are there statues that move? And what does this ""+aP"" value on the weapon mean? Naturally you also have all the usual ""fun stuff"" from the early rogue likes in the game with a items beeing unidentified, half of them cursed, scrolls with random names and urging you to eat stuff that makes you sick. So I got sick, does the game tell you how long that will last? Nope, Sir. So I waited like hundereds of turns because sickness had some serious effects and there was nothing I could do against it. Then poison - the same game. When I reached the boss I learned that he is bascially immune to all magic and casting darkness that makes him hard to hit physically too. On top he got a lot hitpoints and was like full healing himself every few turns. Very frustrating. Not that I actually wanted to rely on spells or melee anyway. I choose to be a Necromancer. But could a raise single minion in 6 hours? Nope! In the wiki I learned you can either make minions from clay - which I didn't have, didn't find and couldn't buy - or from corpses - which I actually expected. But the latter only works of you have a chaotic  alignment and I had a neutral alignment with chaotic tendencies - big difference! I finally died because I was sick again and clicked on the wrong spell to kill a once again respawned monster in same tedious way. Turned out, walls can reflect electricity. Just great.

Note that the game isn't open-ended.  You keep getting corrupted as time goes by, so eventually you either die, win, or lose by corruption.  Some people think the time limit makes the game more limited, but others think it makes it more exciting.  To soften the shock, there are easier modes in the latest version, even a kind of cheat mode for those who want to explore without mortal danger!

Still to be done :) ... Text to 2d conversion isn't quite complete: sometimes you see a message both in a colored window and in a b/w window behind it.  There are icons for some equipment, but not all, and they don't show up consistently in the inventory--or in the right location.  It seems like it would not be too hard to add a 2d graphic way of equipping things, showing how you look with all your armor, etc.  I wish there were a ""personal journal"" that doesn't go away when your character dies.  That way, you could base your entire epic on things you have learned yourself.  I used to have a little (paper) notebook where I recorded everything, but I gave up on it, and now just use online fan sites.

It came back to me quickly when I started playing this shiny new version.

Good things: very nice tiles. UI and keybindings took some getting used to but worked quite well. Some nice quality of life features (especially the automatic exploration is swell.)

Bad things: ADOM takes the worst parts of old rogue-likes and combines them with fundamentally flawed, completely rogue-like-incompatible ideas. It is chock-full of poorly balanced and just plain stupid things (like disproportionate leveling of some monsters AKA the überjackal effect, artifacts that are indistinguishable from common items.) It has too many things that can ruin your game without you being able to do anything about it. It has too many things that are impossible to figure out on your own. It has too many grief mechanisms (like irreversible stat drain, casters forgetting spells, frequent item destruction, unstoppable disarming, ailments that are incurable for low level characters.)

The creator has a rather singular vision he's not willing to compromise or ""sacrifice"" for quality of life.  Melee combat tends to be extremely swingy, which can be a problem when you're going to be mowing through thousands of monsters a playthrough.

Being forced to play intelligently is not the issue, fighting in corridors, minimizing being surrounded or making yourself unavailable to be target with bolt/line spells.  This sort of tactic is expected in any similar roguelike, it's more the fact that out of depth monster generation, monster special attacks, armor piercing (PV ignoring) attacks and the ""UberJackal"" problem exist.

A lot of the dungeons are thematically quite cool, but force you to have trap detection (Miserable, but not impossible for any character to get), and everything seems to be both a simultaneous battle of attrition AND a burst/crit fest.

I remember playing the free ASCII version of this game years ago, and finally picked up this version on Steam. It's just such a great game!

There are so many options to choose from when creating a character, and so many monsters and items to discover and learn how they interact. For instance, the fire bolt and frost bolt spells might seem pretty much identical, but fire bolts can burn items on the ground so you can't use them, while frost bolts can freeze water so you can cross over without swimming. Therefore the frost bolt spell costs more mana.

It can be a bit repetitive if you tend to die early on and you have to repeat the same quests over and over again, though. And the difficulty curve can be rather bizarre - you might plow through dozens of enemies with no trouble at all, then run into a boss that kills you in a few hits if you're not careful! It's probably best to be careful whenever you run into a new monster, especially one with a star by its health bar indicating it's unique!

Oh, I do need to mention the art in this game. The pixel art is very nice (though I do wish all of your character's equipment affected your avatar; hats in particular don't seem to, even though NPCs can be found wearing hats). Everything is easily recognizable and just looks good. And the music is very atmospheric; the levelup theme even changes depending on your alignment, it seems!

I had a caster going, and was doing decently well.  I opened a door to a dungeon and it was a ""monster zoo"" kind of place.  Sure, I've done this before.  I cast my trusty frost bolt and took a bunch of the creatures out.  I cast it again, and took a few more.  Went to cast it a third time, and it was no longer in my spell list.  I had no idea why.  Apparently, though it tells you nowhere in the game, every time you use a spell, you have an increasing chance to forget it at random.  I had six spells at that point, but only one was offensive, and the creatures were too fast for me to run away from, so end of character.

Very in depth, very technical, but there is a LOT to learn.  I suggest that possibly at first you put it on non-roguelike through customization at the start, and then you can utilize saves, then after you get the hang of it switch over to rogue-like.  

This isn't a game for those who get frustrated easily, dislike difficult games, or do not like to figure out mechanics who's instructions are obscure to non-existent.  

Four final notes:
1. The one possibly biggest suggestion I can make is if you can manage to exist long enough in the overworld map, it will give you a hint via a vague direction on which cave/dungeon to enter next.  It's highly recommended you follow this, you can go almost anywhere, and some of the dungeons are almost instantly deadly.  

2. When you are in doubt on your levels, power, or gear, dive the infinite dungeon, it scales evenly, and does not typically jump up in difficulty quickly.  The lower you go, the better gear, gold, and xp you get, and as long as you aren't too greedy, you can come out a winner.  Just remember going between floors ALWAYS randomly generates them, which can be a boon, and a bane.  

3.  Keep smithing stuff around, don't throw it out, this includes when you find an anvil.  It can help you enhance equipment even a little earlier in the game if you are lucky, but especially mid/late game.  Additionally, you can store this stuff, and any spare gear in the outlaw town near the beginning of the game in the thieves guild building.  I do it right where the master thief is, no one takes your stuff, and it should be there forever.  Nonetheless, I close the doors so randos don't wander in.

This is more of an opinion then constructive feedback. I am not an expert in rogueliks but I played few. I dont mind graphics but I want fun. Plus I refuse to spend 100s hours on wiki to find out how to do things - game should show me game should teach me.

I got two characters to level 10, melee only. Most boring gameplay I ever had. No special attacks no special skills. Boring weapons. All you do is bump and T for shooting.

Finished a quest for the Elder in a first town - didn't get any reward...

Went to look for a puppy, bumped through 5 levels, found a river across the dungeon. Cool! I just found a book about bridge building lets try to build a bridge! No, game is not telling you how to build a bridge. This game is not telling you a thing. Lets check skills description from manual, I think I have seen something about bridges: 

Bridge Building
*************
This skill allows you to build bridges.

:D:D

I am sure the dev is proud on how old school this game is and how it is not holding your hand - but to me it is just boring and not fun. OK. I checked my inventory. I am overburden, got 15 things I dont even know what you can try with those since this game is not telling you anything.

OK. I am bored with bumping and swinging my generic axe. I got some unidentified scrolls - I am not going to play it anyway so lets read those. Read 3.... guess what? Nothing happen. Nice. You didn't disappoint me game.

Lets try potions:

potions of water - text in a log ""potion of water tastes like a normal water"" or something like that
potions of water take 2 = text in a log ""this tastes muddy"" or something like that..

Another A+ game...

One of other potions made me blind. I waited. Bump the wall for many turns wondered around and I am still blind... Am I going to be blind forever? How can I tell? The game is not telling me anything :)

There are tons of other better designed game. Games where the new player experience is over the roof. Take DCSS for example. OK I get it, it is slightly different you just go down and you fight but DCSS is a blast in explaining game mechanics and how things work to new player. You die, you learn so much that you want to just go back straight away. But this more ""ambitious"" project is boring as fuck.

The bad: There is such a thing as too much randomness. The game makes a point of leaving quite a bit up to chance, with tables galore and so very many random dungeon features and items to keep you busy. But this randomness makes the game feel downright arbitrary at times. An early random ring of invisibility can make the rest of a run feel too easy. Likewise a random statue or pool effect might essentially kill a character, even an advanced one. There's just so much randomness that there's a whole wiki dedicated to cataloging the RNG and finding exploits which the creator has intentionally left in the game.

Even if you've played one character for a week solid, and it doesn't seem quite good enough, I fully encourage trying a different race/class combination, because it will put a completely new spin on how the game feels as you play.  Few games have I fraught so much over the potential death of one of my characters as I have with A.D.O.M.  I suggest reading at least enough of the manual to know how to refer back to it while you're in the game;  also, take time to learn the controls, and the specifics of at least one race/class combination, and keep an eye out for the Postcard Quest.

When you take out shadow wyrm, you feel a sense of accomplishment. The alignment is more than simply creating weak good/bad choice system.

The classes are interesting ( some unique to ADOM ); Gods listen and will be annoyed if you pester them too much.

I definitely recommend you to support first a) Your Brain and b) Thomas Biskup and the ADOM team for their great work.

a) the brain because this game is not straightforward, you actually need to think occasionally :-)

Thank you Thomas my friend!

I was still in middle school, and the era of the internet was just beginning. 

It came by way of loving Nethack, but being unable to shake the feeling that as much as I loved the style of game, there could be one with a system that fit better. In came ADOM, back during a time when the postcard quest was on the title screen.

Similar in look and feel to Nethack, ADOM features what I consider one of the most classic, purest RPG experiences.

- Deep array of mechanics
- Beautifully written monster descriptions
- Wide variety of items and objects
- Combat that benefits from thinking and planning
- Wide selection of classes, and almost uniquely, classes are NOT meant to be balanced. I can't express how much I enjoyed that the difficulty of the game itself needed not hinge on an easy/medium/hard slider, but inherent in the talents and skills of the character you brought to the world. 
- Clear main storyline goal that gives the game objective and purpose, without an overly large focus on aimless wandering (though there can be plenty of that if you choose to).

ADOM is a game that captured my imagination instantly, perhaps a side effect of the time. Graphics were miserable in the early days of PCs, and I readily found that my imagination served far better than the GPUs of the day.

These days, a graphical overlay was added with plenty of other more modern features, such as sound and mouse support.
Even with that available, I still prefer the ASCII graphics and a healthy dose of mental images.

I previously wrote that the game caters only to a specific class of player.  Mainly  fighter tanks.   This judgement was off of a poor understanding of the character building.   Hopefully I've learned something more about the game.

This game has a learning curve.  Your beginning stats you choose can have a huge impact on your experience.   Hence there is an option that allow the game to pick those for you so you have an easier time.

ADOM offers a lot of options to the way you play it.  They all have their own challenges.   it is a good rogue like.  If you know what that means...try it out.  But give it 10+ hrs at a minimum.   

If you're not a ""rogue like"" fan...well..good luck. :)

For the life of me, I don't now how I managed to sink a few hundred hours into this title when I was a much younger man. The various ways that ADOM can waste your time for no reason other than a dice role or hidden variable are intensely annoying and unfun.

While dungeon levels are (for the most part) completely random, a lot of emphasis is placed on the plot, which is a big draw of the game. The plot is immersive, intelligent and interesting. You enter the Drakalor Chain with the goal of stopping the spread of Chaos, completing quests as you see fit and generally fighting for glory. To aid the plot, there are many locations in the overworld and elsewhere that are constant. Thus, depending on the decisions you make, the same NPCs reappear and the same quests are available in most games (almost no quests are required to complete the game, but they are all interesting and worthwhile!).

ADOM has a lot of depth and complexity, and offers the best replay value of any game I've ever played. I have been playing it since 2009 and have won 24 times with 13 different classes and 8 different races – and I'm far from bored or done with it! From 2002-2012, there were no new releases, but a vibrant community still played the game incessantly during that time; [i]that's[/i] replay value.

ADOM is all about flexibility and control of your character. Not only are there five different possible endings, but your trip to the end can take many different forms. You can kill all your enemies with thrown shields. You can true berserk everything to death. You can dual-wield daggers or go unarmed for the entire game. You can have a pet cave bear kill all your enemies. Want to sling gems? toss hats? kick or spit everything to death? It can all be arranged. While each class has its own specialties, the options are truly endless and offer you basically complete freedom.

Let's make no bones about it: ADOM is extremely challenging, and can be quite difficult even for a roguelike. Learning the ins and outs of the game takes a lot of time, but it's a very rewarding experience. Once you get the hang of it, you'll find that there are almost no situations that can't be overcome by taking the time to think and evaluate your options.",1576393835,1576514462,True,5,0,0.510002553462982178,0,False,False,False,False,,,

En juego en sí es GRATUITO, y se puede bajar desde su página oficial. La versión de Steam, de pago, añade algunas características, como una mayor libertad a la hora de crear personajes, o un modo de juego sin muerte permanente. Además, es una forma de apoyar al creador del juego.

A mi me parece muy entretenido para echar una partida de vez en cuando. Si te gusta el género, éste es un clásico, al menos deberías echarle un vistazo a la versión gratuita.

Gut:

Athmosphärische Welt. Tolles Tileset. Intelligentes, vielfältiges Spielsystem. Macht wirklich Spaß.

Nicht gut:

Nicht vorhandenes Tutorial. Man weiß am Anfang nicht wo man sinnvoll hin soll und wo man nicht hin darf - später auch nicht. Guides strotzen vor Abkürzungen und  unerklärten Begriffen.  Prozentsatz der ""unfairen"" Tode zu hoch - z.B. im Vergleich mit Dungeoncrawl Stonesoup. z.b. man biegt um eine Ecke oder öffnet eine Tür, wird sofort dauergestunnt und das wars. ""Sterben soll Spaß machen in Roguelikes"" - ok ok aber nicht so oft ohne dass man was falsch gemacht hat. Kurz gesagt: das Roguelike Prinzip oft zu plump umgesetzt. 

Trotzdem macht's Spaß und wenn man seinen Frust überwunden hat will man's gerne noch mal neu probieren. Deshalb Empfehlung.

The scale of the adventure, the unceasing difficulty, and the importance of small increases in effectiveness that add up over time are the meat and potatoes of this rogue-like.  ADOM is one of those games where reading the Wikis, tactica, and item descriptions do not water down the sense of awe and achievement that you receive by being immersed in this world - consider that merely homework as assigned.  

I have not yet beaten ADOM.  After trying a variety of combinations, I've settled on one that I'm using as a tool for personal learning and growth - to see what I prefer as a player.  This does, of course, impact the game played - each race/class will play differently.  I think this is the path intended.  ADOM is not mastered so much as danced with; missteps will send you back to the beginning and getting comfortable is a great way to get in trouble. In fact, my latest game was one where I forgot to request divine intervention despite being very able to do so.  It is very possible to get tilted.  That's ADOM - you have to bring your wits with you. If your style of gaming is something casual with low stakes,  you should be popping coins in a game starring Mario.  If you are willing to invest a little of yourself into learning the game on its terms, you're in for a treat that doesn't end.

UPDATE
_________
Since this review, I've had the pleasure of finishing this game multiple times including an Ultra Ending as a Dark Elf Wizard (Consider that Easy Mode BTW).  ADOM is the game I nominate each year as the Labor of Love and I feel it deserves it annually - at least until Dwarf Fortress comes in as a competitor.  ADOM is phenomenal.  It has a depth and richness that you don't find often and certainly not in the true Rogue-Like genre where mechanics trump storytelling.

Данный обзор для тех, кто не играл в оригинальную игру Томаса.
Сразу оговорюсь, это игра не для всех. В общем-то ее можно поделить на две части. В режиме ""story mode"" не заморачиваясь на значительную часть комплексных механик игры вы можете попытаться пройти ее ради сюжета. Я не оговорился - попытаться, ибо даже этот режим может преподнести сюрпризы. В конце концов, чем вам помогут сохранения/загрузки если вы банально не можете убить противника потому что ваш герой слишком слаб? Режим истории здесь скорее режим обучения нежели действительно простой режим где можно пройти игру ради истории. Отсюда главный и пожалуй единственный минус игры - высокая сложность. ДА, игра требует от вас продумывать свои действия и решения, а самое главное - не рисковать почем зря. Второй режим? Настоящий хардкор, где 90% персонажей погибают у первой же деревни, потому что, как и в жизни, лазить одному по пещерам и диким землям крайне опасно.
В ней нет поблажек игроку - качали только навык владения мечами? А вот вам ржавый монстр который сожрал ваш последний меч и выплюнул огрызок. А вот вкачали бы вы хотя бы немного навык владения дубинами, отдубасили бы его уже этой деревянной дубинкой что носите про запас и сохранили бы свой меч в целости. В этом пожалуй вся суть - разнеженные современными играми, мы привыкли что игра всегда дает нам шанс выкрутиться, что любого врага можно одолеть. Но не здесь. В ADOM нужно заранее продумать порядок своих действий - что делать если меня окружат? Сколько нужно взять провианта чтобы не умереть от голода на нижних уровнях той пещеры? Стоит ли спускаться на еще один уровень вниз если PowerPoints (мана в других играх) на нуле? Если заранее продумать свою стратегию, многое становится проще. К сожалению, именно это нам и лениво делать. Поэтому я не согласен с теми рецензентами, кто говорит что в игре запредельный рандом. Он только кажется таковым, потому что мы с вами (как игроки) не приложили ни грамма усилий чтобы этот рандом контролировать. Мы каждый раз под давлением привычек срываемся и начинаем играть как привыкли в других играх - наобум. С шашкой наголо несемся вперед вопя что-то несуразное, а потом с удивлением обнаруживаем себя посередине комнаты, набитой монстрами. 
Не надо пить из лужи, если вы не готовы в нее упасть!
Обязательно прочитайте гайды по игре, советы новичку, начните с класса попроще. И думайте. Что вас будет спасать? прыткие ноги или толстая кожа? Чем вы будете бить врагов? А если это не эффективно? Всегда трезво оценивайте риски, не совершайте ненужных поступков и тогда вы получите удивительный опыт, какой способна подарить не каждая игра.",1549350029,1549350029,True,11,0,0.658284008502960205,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are many choices of race and class combinations from elf to ratling duelist to wizard, thief and assassin to gnomes and orcs, all of which have depth to them.

The classes each play differently and gain different abilities as you level, some being intentionally harder to play than others.

Good beginning classes are archers for keeping everything at range, beastfighters for being able to barehanded melee most things to death, and elementalists for an auto-renewing selection of damage spells to clear rooms.

The story is also surprisingly good, make sure you talk to any named characters you meet, there is a whole lot of interesting lore to be discovered beyond the main story and multiple endings are possible.

Difficulty - Rougelikes (for those who don't know) are known for their difficulty and the fact that death is permament, meaning you must create a new character when you die (though in recent versions this can be toggled off) 

Adom is very unforgiving but also very skill based, generally if you know what your doing you'll only die from your own mistakes (there are exceptions of course - triggering a door trap at level 1 before your stong enough to survive for example)

Graphics - the graphics are not the best, but they are much better than they were (though some preferred the ASCII version) and are more than sufficient to convey everything you need to know.

Controls - Controls are reasonably intuitive, and mouse functionality has been improved to the point where you can easily handle most actions without difficulty.",1548256332,1548256332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ADOM은 뭐 더 말할게 없을 정도로 잘만든 게임입니다.


종족이나 직업마다 특색도 그럭저럭 있고, 다양한 아이템과 퀘스트, 그리고 넓은 월드맵. 여러 오브젝트 간의 상호작용이 재밌는 게 많아서 좋았습니다. 게임을 하다보면 제작자가 얼마나 이 게임에 애정을 갖고 게임을 다듬어나갔는지 몸에 스며들 정도로 느껴집니다.



지금 부터는 그간 느낀 좆같은 점들



1. 너무 많이 쑤셔 넣음


ADOM은 하면서 느끼는거지만 월드맵도 있고, 퀘스트도 많고 너무 방대하게 게임을 만들고

또 지금도 쑤셔넣는 중이라, 한 번 하고나면 피곤함이 장난이 아님, 콤팩트 하게 깼는데도 10시간에서 15시간 정도 걸렸음 느긋하게 탐험도 하고 했으면 20시간 정도 걸렸을 것 같은데,
이렇게 너무 큰 볼륨은 로그라이크 장르와 잘 맞지 않는 것 같음.

특히 로그라이크라서 부활 아뮬렛 있는거 아닌이상 죽으면 오랫동안 하던걸 날리는 거라 그 좌절감이 정말 너무 심함. 




2.기능상의 불편함 문제.


게임 자체가 다르기도 하지만 돌죽하면서  O - tab - 컨트롤F -컨트롤 O  써보고 신세계라고 느꼈음, 

A. 이 게임은 던전 한 층이 돌죽보다 훨씬 작아서 굳이 자동 탐색이 필요없다고 생각했는지
기능도 늦게 도입 되었고, 많이 엉성함. 탐색하는 것도 영 석연치 않고 발자국 표시도 없고 그냥 못미더움.

B. 특히나 돌죽의 경우 컨트롤 O, 컨트롤 F 키로 특이 던전이 어디 있었는지, 아이템이 어디 있는지 검색하는 기능이 있었는데 ADOM은 그런 기능, 말하자면 컴퓨터가 대신 기억해주는 기능이 떨어져서 모든 특이사항은 플래이어가 스스로 기억하던지 직접 메모장에 적야되어 무척 불편함. 스케일이 커서 그런 기능을 만들기 힘들었을 수도 있겠지만 오히려 그래서 없는 것이 크게 불편하게 느껴짐, 

C. 자동줍기 모드도, 아이템 별로 설정 가능 한 것이 아니라, 카테고리 전체를 줍는 거고, 주변에 적이 있건 없건 무조건 주워서 너무 기능들이 1차원 적인 것 같았음. 물론 아이템의 종류가 너무 방대해서 그렇다고는 하나. 아쉽게 느껴짐. 차라리 지금처럼 카테고리 뿐만 아니라. \ 키를 누르면 나오는 이미 밝혀진 아이템 중에서 취사선택 하는 기능이 좀 있었으면 함.


D. 추가로 자기 세부스텟, 자기가 은신감지가 있는지, 어떤 속성에 이뮨인지, 레지인지, 텔레포트 컨트롤이 있는지. 보려면 insight 포션을 마시거나 주문을 써야됨 난 이거 진짜 너무 불편하고 왜 이런 시스템인지 이해를 못하겠음.

E. 마지막으로 아이템의 제대로 된 기능을 보려면 great identify 스크롤을 찢어야 돼서 제대로 알지도 못하고 아이템을 쓰는 경우가 많음. 스크롤은 턱없이 부족하고 스크롤 하나당 아이템 하나만 나오니, 결국 아이템 정보를 얻으려면 wiki같은 외부 사이트에 의존하게  되는데 이건 진짜 이러면 안 된다고 생각함.


전체적으로 말하자면 편의기능이 너무 떨어짐. 컴퓨터 게임인데 플래이어가 일일히 손대야 되는게 참 귀찮음.



3. 크리티컬이 아닌 이상 별 의미가 없는 기본공격들

크리티컬 계산식이 데미지 2배인데 단순히 최종 데미지가 2배가 되는게 아니라 적의 방어력 감소 전에 두배를 계산하는 식이라

데미지 50에 상대 방어력이 40이면 기본 공격은 10 이지만, 크리티컬은 (50*2-40) = 60임

실질 데미지가 6배 차이남. 이게 후반가서 적들의 방어력이 증가하고 그럴 수록 이런식으로 좀 공격이 크리티컬에 의존이 심함, 

게다가 이 게임은 로그라이크 게임이라 안전하게 원거리에서 공격하는게 전술적으로 정말 중요한데, 안 그래도 유리한 원거리 무기가 너무 강함.

원거리 미사일의 크리티컬 배수가 3~6배 정도고 무조건 해당 속성에 크리티컬을 터트릴 수 있는 슬래잉 화살 같은게 있어서 파괴력이 상상을 초월함. 최종 몬스터인 발러같은것도 상성 맞춰서 데몬 슬레잉 화살 3번 4번만 쏴서 크리티컬 계속 터트리면 그냥 죽어버림, 그런데 또 그렇다고 그런 몬스터들과 근접으로 상대하기는 너무 험난하고 그래서. 중간이 없는 것 같음.


따라서 모든 케릭터가 마법을 안 쓰면 무조건 활이라도 써야 됨. 그게 너무 강제되는 거 같음. 반대로 갖춰지기만 하면 게임이 후반부터는 너무 쉬워짐.



4. 노가다 강요


텔레포트 컨트롤을 얻기위해 블링크 도그를 일부러 계속 수를 늘리면서 잡거나

허브 노가다, 무한던전 노가다, 신앙도 노가다, 우물 마셔서 위시 찾는거 등등..

이런식으로 노가다 할 것이 너무 많음. 안해도 된다고는 하는데 솔직히 노가다 하고 안 하고 차이가 너무 심해서 유혹이 너무 강함 특히나 한 번 죽으면 끝인 로그라이크 게임이라 준비는 튼튼하게 할 수 밖에 없음.

그리고 문제는 이런 식으로 밑준비 실컷하고 모험좀 즐기다 죽는다? 좌절감이 너무 심하게 옴.


5. 좁은 길


클리어 까지 가기 위해서는 몇가지 퀘스트들을 통과하면서 가야 되는데

문제는 이것들이 쭈욱 연결되어 있음 그런데 그 길이 너무 좁아서 한 번이라도 삐끗하면 지긋한 노가다가시작됨.

예를들면 카지노 입구의 경비병을 치우기 위한 반지를 먹으려면 등산 장비를 먹고 무덤에서 스켈레톤 킹을 죽여야 됨,

물론 등산 장비가 피라미드에서 하나 나오는데 그거 날려먹으면 나올 때까지 하염없이 노가다를 해야 됨, 반대로 이미 선맥을 넘은 상태에서 등산장비가 모종의 이유로 파손되면 등산장비가 나올 때까지 무한정 노가다가 시작되는 그런 꼴임.


또 다른 예로는 영원한 화염의 탑에 가려면 ring of ice 얼음반지가 있어야 착용한 장비가 타지 않음.  중립 성향이면 하나 확정적으로 나오긴 하는데

이 아이템 하나를 얻기 위해서 

텔레포트 컨트롤을 얻는다 - 아이템 위치나 맵을 볼 수 있는 아이템을 준비한다. - 텔레포트 완드를 먹는다 - 그 완드로 드워프 마을에서 반지를  얻는다. - 화염의 탑을 공략한다.

이런 식으로 그 난관들의 밑준비 작업들이 다 세세하게 연결되어있고. 그 중에 뭐 하나가 틀어지면 랜덤 드랍으로 나오길 바라며 하염없이 노가다를 해야만 함.


물론 그런 아이템이 준비가 안 되어도 진행을 하고자 하면 억지로 진행 할 수야 있겠지만, 제대로 된 준비가 안 되면 그러한 관문을 통과하는 것이 너무나도 고됨. 고된다는 것은 죽을 가능성이 높다는 것이고, 로그라이크 장르에서 죽음을 각오하고 싶은 사람이 얼마나 될까 싶음. 이 게임은 이런 것들이 좀 있음.


결론을 말하자면 얼핏 보기에는 월드맵도 있고 이것저것 자유롭게 넓은 맵을 탐험 할 수 있을 것 같지만, 사실은 모든 관문들이 독립적이 아니라 대부분 연결 되어 있음, 그리고 그 연결 고리에서 한번 삐끗하면 다시 정상궤도에 오르기가 너무 힘듬.


6. 좆같은 커럽션

돌죽으로 치면 커럽션은 변이라고 생각하면 됨

문제는 이게 몬스터에게 맞거나 포션을 먹어야만 생기는 것이 아니라 배경 커럽션이라고

그냥 턴이 흘러도 장소에 따라 자동으로 변이 수치가 쌓임,  그렇게 변이가 16개인가 18개인가 쌓이면 그대로 카오스 생명체로 바뀌면서 게임 오버임

그래서 천천히 전략적으로 게임을 풀어나갈 수 없음

돌죽처럼 체력 떨어지면 느긋하게 숫자 5 눌러서 쉬면서 체력 체우거나, 다른 지역에서 줍지않고 버렸던 아이템을 들고오고,  또 다른 던전 돌면서 경험치도 좀 올리면서 캐릭터를 강화해서 돌파를 시도하고 이런 플래이가 힘들어짐(천천히 하다보면 커럽션 쌓여서 게임 오버니까.)

그래서 게임 내내 존나 압박감이 느껴짐,  맵도 넓고 하고싶은 것도 많고 그런데 게임 자체가 너무 등을 떠미는 느낌이 강함. 굉장히 불쾌함.


7. 경험치와 레벨업 디자인의 문제점.

레벨업 필요 경험치설정, 그 설계가 너무 구림. 초반 15레벨 정도까지는 그냥저냥 잘 올라가는데 그 이후로는 습득량에 비해 요구량이 너무나 높게 설계되어 있어 성장이 완전히 정체되어버림.

애당초 경험치 얻는게 너무 이상함. 대부분의 몬스터는 정말 별로 의미 없는 적은량의 경험치를 줄 뿐이라. 경험치 습득량이 너무 적어 레벨업의 기약이 없음. 일부 오브던전 몬스터나, 보스들이 주는 엄청난 경험치만이 레벨업에 의미있게 느껴짐. 


까놓고 말해서 게임 막바지까지도 레벨업 좆도 안 되다가  D50에 나오는 발러같은거 한두마리에 레벨 쭉쭉 올라가게 만드는 이런 븅신같은 디자인 때문에 대부분의 전투가 지루하게 느껴짐. 잡나 스킵하나 별 차이도 없는 거 같으니까. 특히 두드러 지는 부분이 오브사원 사이의 특색없는 층들을 내려 갈 때임. 의미없고 지루함.

또한 게임을 클리어 하더라도 50레벨까지 도달하지 못하는 경우가 수두룩함. 나 뿐만 아니라 포럼의 게임 클리어 로그를 봐도 50레벨 클리어가 아닌 경우가 무척 많음. 그래서 심지어 게임을 클리어 했는데도 불구하고 캐릭터의 능력을 십분 활용하지 못한 것 같아서 아쉬움이 많이 남음.. 여하튼 레벨업 관련해서 조절하긴 해야 된다고 봄.


8. 미친 도전과제

That ADOM here is the very same fabulous game, with the addition of mouse control, new visuals and some new classes/features. SO, if you're an old fan, don't listen to me, buy this game, it's worth any pence of its price.

However... the time actually flows, and we're not the same persons as we were yesturday. Players now are different. Games now are different. Thomas Biskup made a great game in 1994, but after then... He'd better be creating some new worlds rather than holding this one in life.

As of benefits and ""pro"" points for ADOM people usually calls the gross variety of choices and outcomes. I'm sorry, but the only gross in variables is the pre-start player character generation. 22 classes * 12 races * 12 birthsigns + stats + traits... that really feels as helluva of options! However, all the variety of classes, all the plethora of skills and hidden traits - worth nothing thanks to the high randomization principle of all combats in the game.

As of 2019 year cRPG player, I can't stand neither the principles of level generation (especially the structure of the main dungeon), nor the ""quests"" in ADOM. They are too conventional, primitive and unrealistic. Unfair too (maybe it's the main issue).

Finally, ADoM is a game for explicit, self-realized masochists, who are taking the fun of ""what kind of perma-death I've gathered today"". If you're thinking that I'm just a puny weakling - you're either not played ADOM at all, or you're one of those 0,001% of people who actually beaten the game at least once. By my honest calculations, a mere player have to invest about 500 hours to achieve that, and XXXX hours to be a proper ""ProPlayer"" there. Considering the fact that all that time goes not for billions of stories and the real variety of gameplay, but the boring comprehension of the basic game mechanics, pushing through constant random deaths... I don't really have enough lifetime for this. Sorry, Thomas, but I think you need to finally set the princess in some another castle.

I mark ADOM as 6/10, but it's good only as epitaph of the former glory. There are many of the better games at moment, starting from ToME, and all the way to the newest titles. 

PS: 100 ADOM releases, most of which are bug fixes!!! C'mon, it's too much perfection on the simple rhyme!

The graphics are reasonably middle-of-the-road, being simplistic enough for everything to appropriately stand out from the environment, but are subtly animated and overall very appealing. I find ""simple"" to be a quality that is very hard to do correctly, regardless of whether it is graphics, music, food, or anything else life has to offer, but ADOM pulls it off well. 

The music is also approrpriate- a good soundtrack tends to fade into background of your awareness, neither being too loud or quiet, too over the top, or too subtle, but just catching your consciousness now and then despite generally being always there.

Beyond this, what more can I say? ADOM is one of the largest, oldest, and continually updated roguelikes out there, and it actually has a plot beyond ""go retrieve the endgame-McGuffin"" that determines *how* you save the world... IF you choose to save it at all.

If you are new to roguelikes, I highly suggest this game, because there is a newcomer mode that lets you take it easy, whether it is removing permadeath, or tons of wishes to begin with, or even just a simple tutorial mode to get you on your way... but if You've been playing roguelikes ever since Rogue, ADOM will scratch that itch for you as well, being just as challenging as Rogue ever was.

If you’ve ever dabbled in the foundational classics of the roguelike genre, you’ve probably heard of ADOM. And it was probably in hushed whispers about cat lords or liches, or some esoteric rules about handling some lost temple somewhere. ADOM built a reputation for being tricky and unforgiving, even when cast against its peers like NetHack and Crawl, and you can still experience plenty of that pain even decades later. Some of the roughest edges have been smoothed over with this more mainstream makeover, but it’s still very much a game about arcane rules and deadly knowledge checks for the player. And now there’s an added element of instability that makes this recommendation an extremely qualified one.

The fanciful land of Ancardia is in terrible peril. Beneath the Drakalor Chain, the forces of chaos are stirring. Fortunately, you happen to be one of those heroic types that forges forth in search of loot and glory and ends up saving the whole shebang… or dying and restarting, anyway. While the ominous Cavern of Doom hides the source of this corruption that must be excised, there are plenty of other locations across the land that could use your attention. Musty caves, strange pyramids, and mystical temples all contain great dangers, and wondrous rewards for those who brave them.

Whereas ADOM’s contemporaries had you descending into one great dungeon complex, this title gives you an overworld and plenty of additional areas to explore in addition to its great dungeon complex. It gives the early game a little more direction as well, offering you a basic cave to explore before ushering you into a town with a few beginner quests to work through. They’re not all so simple, though… one of those quests is the infamous puppy dungeon, scourge of low-level characters throughout the ages. But I prefer this more open approach to the early game, as opposed to clearing similar dungeon levels over and over as you make new characters.

Honestly though, this is about the only allowance ADOM makes for new players. As a classic roguelike this one is just as stuffed with obscure keyboard commands and item effects as any of them, and a few of those can end up being deathly important. You’ll have no idea starting out what the relevance of a dedicated wipe-your-face button is, or why blankets end up being so important, or even which corpses you want to make sure you eat. There’s a lot of esoteric knowledge needed to survive past the early game, and it’s not always the kind that you can puzzle out yourself. Just working out the most relevant stats and skills from the deluge the game presents you with can be a tall order, much less figuring out what to do with all the unidentified potions and potentially cursed gear you’ll find.

The real pitfalls, of course, are the enemies. True to classic roguelike fashion you’re not going to know just how deadly a foe is before you engage them, and by then it’s usually too late. My last run was characterized by cleaving through foes that couldn’t do enough damage to overcome my armor, until I ran across an animated pillar of water that killed me in a single hit. These difficulty spikes aren’t even localized in bosses or traps, they’re simply monsters that happen to be the hard counter to whatever your character is, and you’ve pretty much got to eat shit once to learn what a threat they are. Some of these spikes have to be planned for hours in advance as well, so be ready for lots of sudden stops in your runs while you learn the intricacies of this one.

Even if you come to grips with the combat and the many, many systems, the game could still crash. The Steam version of ADOM is surprisingly unstable, and without unrestricted saving your character could be set back thirty minutes to an hour, or lost altogether. Supposedly it’s the updated tile graphics that cause part of the problem, but that will need to be addressed long term as you can’t have a major feature of your re-release ending runs like that. The graphics aren’t even that spot on, either, because there’s plenty of inconsistent formatting and such. It’s an odd place for a passion project like this to end up, particularly because it’s such a big feature of the roguelike landscape. But you need to be aware that ADOM is still very much the old-school ball-buster it once was, and it might even crash on you when things start getting good. I’d say it still deserves to be explored, but this release might not be the best way to make your mark on Ancardia.

First, the screen resolution settings (yes there are multiple, none of which actually use numbers until you get to the complicated stuff) don't do a thing. Nothing. Even the zoom setting does absolutely nohting. I finally figured out, completely on my own after someone pointed me to the resolution setting that has the numbers and still does nothing, that you can zoom. That was actually a tip in the advanced settings section that someone had to help me find. Something as simple as ""pressing ctrl+scrolling will zoom the map"" should have been in any of the multiple other screens that are easily accessed. So I finally got that to work for me and was able to play the game. I was looking through all of the settings screens for keybindings and simply could not find them. I asked around yet again and found out you have to go completely out of the game and actually edit one of the files with the keybindings settings. After trying to ed it the keybindings I couldn't get the game to load, so I asked AGAIN what was going on and was told that I had an empty command line. In order to see what line, I had to hit F10. Nothing anywhere says to hit that, but it's the button you push to go to ASCII graphics. After I-don't-even-know-how-many times I finally got all of the key bindings fixed. It seems like the easy key bindings are all used, so I had to make a lot of them CTRL+a number. Now I was finally able to play. This took at least an hour to get all set up, which is the longest I've EVER taken to set up a game with just keybindings and graphics. The first character I was able to play died within the first 2 levels of the dungeon. I received a cursed item that damanged me every turn and had no way to remove it. You see, everything you pick up just has a generic name, and you need to try verious ways to actually identify them. Until later in the game (according to the forums because there is nothing in-game) you have to rely on various skills, which probably will not work unless you're either a merchant or I think Ratling, or a scroll you can pick up. I never had the scroll. You also don't know the stats on an item either until you actually try it on. So I tried on an item and it was one that damaged me every turn, and I had no way to remove it. 1 down. The second was a spell caster. I didn't like how complicated the spell system was so I exited that character. The next one I ended up with a sickness that I couldn't get rid of either and constantly got hurt. The last one I got a cursed pair of gloves on floor four and couldn't hut anything with them and finally gave up. 

I just can't recommend this game based on how it's basically the 25 year old game with a really bad reskin.

Rating: Unable to find one. 
Price: $14.99
Genre: Roguelike, Dungeon Crawler
Time played: 10.6 Hours

An updated version of the classic rogue/dungeon crawler. More/different choices more ways to die. 

Gameplay - 8
ADOM (Ancient  Domains of Mystery) plays like most dungeon crawlers, go here kill things, level up and make your character better. You search dungeons and look for loot to make your character stronger and better able to survive. 

They have several gameplay modes ranging from easy (allows reloading of saves) to roguelike (1 live/ permadeath), each has its own scoreboard/leaderboard. I believe you can only get the achievements if you play the permadeath mode. 

There are plenty of races and classes to choose from, along with your star sign, all of which have various effects on your character, which directly affects the gameplay. 

Story -  8

You are the chosen one, go forth and kill the chaos that is creeping into this land.  I don’t remember the exact story, but that seems to be par for the course in these types of games. 

Graphics - 8

Not great, but still good.  The spell effects are nice and the monsters and characters you run across look good. 

Controls - 7 (mouse/keyboard)

I had trouble with the controls, but that’s due to me playing other roguelikes that have different control schemes.  The controls are slightly different but a lot are the same as other games of this genre.  As I play more and get used to them it wasn’t as difficult but still feel ‘off’. 

Repeatability - 10

Tons and tons to do in the game, like most roguelikes. They even have a dungeon that is endless/infinite so you can loot and farm etc etc.  And of course, you’re going to die a lot. So you’ll have lots of chances to try again. And again. And again.

Music - 8

It’s there, it fits the game. It’s nothing special but it does fit the mood of whatever’s going on in the game.

Multiplayer - N/A

Initial Thoughts:

Oh another rogue clone.  Meh.  Controls are.. Different. Not sure how I feel about this. 

 

Soma Says: 

Do you like rogue type games? Dying repeatedly to hopefully learn some new info on how to play the game?  Then this is a game for you.  The controls aside it’s a pretty solid rogue game and I full recommend that you try it out. 

I personally enjoy the fact that you can randomize everything, let fate decide your character. I’m not trying to win though, i’m just having fun.  If you are trying to win, yeah lots of luck with that. 

It’s a fun/frustrating experience trying out a new rogue game. So many things, is it important to have this skill? Should i be leveling it up? What about this? Do i need this? So many questions and the only way you can answer it is to play the game.

The constant updates make it worth returning to, as i have done now, after having played it for the first time around 20 years ago. I have played about 50 different versions of this game, beat it 4 times, come close a dozen times more and killed thousands of characters, often intentionally. 

Tips:
- Learn how altars and live sacrifices work. Google ""crowning"" or ""precrowning"" and get to work.
- If you have (or can get) the Herbalism skill, learn herbs and use them well too.
- You need a shield and you will need to learn how to handle skills, identifying and stuff like cursed items.
- For noobs, try playing a Priest, a Elementalist or Archer.
- Try a Mindcrafter, Chaos knight or Weaponsmith for advanced (and huge) fun!
- If you worry about cats, i have this to say: ""Budibu!""

I'm reviewing more often now. Mainly after I read the article ""What developers think of Steam reviews"" at Rock, Paper, Shotgun and the need for it wherever there is a negativity bias.

I'm a big fan of roguelikes and have played many of the major ones. I've been trying to get into this game for a few years, on and off. I refrained from using spoilers. I finally feel I've spent enough time to assess it. 

[b]Pros (for some of you, these may as well be under Cons):[/b] 
[list]
[*]Hard: By ""hard"" I don't mean your character will get killed often, that happens too. Dying isn't the main issue, oh no, this game is merciless when it comes to outright crippling your otherwise well-to-do character. Be it by destroying precious equipment or by those nasty sometimes game-changing corruptions. It challenges you in another way.
[*]A lot to explore/Game length: There's a big enough world to explore and even after more than 100 hrs of gameplay, I still just feel my best character has barely progressed a quarter of the game.
[*]Tileset/Sound/Music: Good. The classic ASCII mode isn't recommended even for players like me who prefer it. Mainly because that part feels not developed enough and you'll miss out many features.
[/list]
I can now safely conclude that this game has its own niche like the other major roguelikes, which I can appreciate it for.

Cons.
[list]
[*]UI: Really one of the most negative aspects of this game. The controls feel arbitrary, unintuitive and annoying to use, with little scope for customisation. Could take a cue from Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, which has such a streamlined UI and control setup.
[*]Buggy: By this I mean, no major game crashing bugs but minor ones and some features of the game feel incomplete. For instance, the sound randomly stops working and the quest feature doesn't seem to be implemented uniformly.
[/list]
TLDR: Veteran roguelike players can appreciate this game but it needs to be given time and its UI shortcomings excused. Not recommended for those new to the genre unless they have plenty of time (and patience) on their hands.",1532191051,1532191097,True,8,0,0.571926116943359375,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Pleasant graphics
- Lots of classes and character customization
- Plays pretty smoothely and doesn't seem to have a ton of unavoidable RNG game ending pitfalls common in Rogue-likes
- In game tutorial and different difficulty levels chosen at game start
- The option to have your character be fully or partially randomly generated (Class, Story, Stats, etc).
- Feels like a really good time killer.

[b]The Questionable[/b]
- Despite having a GUI, a lot of the controls require hotkeys from all over your keyboard
- Item destruction can be annoying (some mobs and traps can destroy items, even unequipped ones, in your inventory, sometimes in a single shot)

[b]The Bad[/b]
- Instead of RNG pitfalls, it has gotchas you only learn about if you scour wikis and/or lose a bunch of times.  There is a ton of things I could mention, but I'd recommend reading some other negative reviews to get an idea of what I'm talking about.
- http://ancardia.wikia.com/wiki/Stat_drain - Evil game mechanic that nearly forces all characters to have a form of ranged damage to mitigate the permanent stat drains, to beat certain enemies.  The game doesn't prepare you for it, and the trend of favoring ranged damage over melee damage extends further than just stat drain prevention.
- https://steamcommunity.com/app/333300/discussions/0/1480982338955499753/ - Sometimes toxic ""git gud"" community that's been around a long long time.  Dev seems to have no problem with it.  Take that as you will.

[b]Summary[/b]
I really want to recommend this game.  I really do.  It feels like a hidden gem that somehow never showed up on my radar until recently.  But it definitely has some rough spots that rub me the wrong way.  I will likely continue to play the game a while, as it's already purchased and I do enjoy a lot of it.  But buyer beware.  The fanboys that have been playing the game for nearly 20 years, leave out a few details.  Definitely read up on the negative reviews and decide for yourself.",1532165340,1532165340,False,29,4,0.586824595928192139,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This new Steam version overall is a huge improvement to the old ADOM and definitely the added content brings lot into it. I probably have spent hundreds of hours to this game pre-Steam and now just recently bought the Steam version. The game has come forward a long way and nowadays has very informative Wiki page as well, which will help old and new players alike. I find myself spending quite a lot of time reading the Wiki every time if I have a specific kind of character in my mind I want to create. I also like the graphical version of the game, although certain types of items can be sometimes difficult to spot, especially in corridors when the translucent wall covers the view somewhat.

However, what I have noticed compared to the older versions is that the beginning of the game has become increasingly difficult. So far I have about 30 hours into the game and my problem seems to be the fact that no matter how well I plan my game, I can't seem to survive even past the puppy dog dungeon or the village dungeon in the beginning. My game usually ends when the game random spawns one or two powerful monsters on the level of all sudden and there's virtually no way to beat them, or sometimes no way to even escape them. I know it is a part of the roguelike genre but it is getting increasingly frustrating, especially when you want to play on the true roguelike mode without adjusting the original settings. Also, reading the Wiki really is necessary to get into game, so for the first roguelike experience, ADOM is not the easiest.

Overall, it is still a great roguelike game and I love spending hours to it. I am happy with my purchase and I can recommend it to the fans of the genre, regardless of the harsh beginning difficulty and the necessity of reading the Wiki before playing.",1531864039,1531864094,True,2,1,0.525590121746063232,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Positives
- The fact that the base ASCII game is, and always will be, free (it's included in the Steam version, but you can download it stand-alone from the official website)
- The new graphics update makes it much easier to see what's going on and control your movements compared to the base game (i.e. if a monster is hostile to you, health bars, dots above sprites denoting status effects, the ability to click on things is especially helpful in your inventory, 
- The game has absolutely incredible depth, which the most recent updates have added to with new quests, monsters, items, locations, etc. ADOM has always been a huge game, and continues to grow even bigger.
     - Speaking of depth, the combat system, with different tactics settings and multiple approaches to attack, defence, and fleeing, is great
- The most depth in any game I've ever played. Seriously. It's hard to learn, almost impossible to master, 
- The fact that the dev(s) are still updating and maintaining this game AFTER TWENTY-FOUR YEARS (seriously, it came out in 1994, you can look it up. I've been playing this game on-and-off for about 13 years and I'm STILL learning new things!)
- Good music
- Funny little easter eggs hidden throughout the game

Neutral
- Probably the steepest learning curve you'll ever encounter in a game that isn't Dwarf Fortress
- You will absolutely need to read a guide/wiki while playing ADOM. This is not a good game to go into blind.

Negatives
- I dunno man, you might not like it?

ADOM is easily in my Top 5 Games of All Time. I have 283 hours in-game on steam, but if you count how much I played as a kid I should easily be over 600, maybe a few hundred more. That's amazing bang for your buck.

All in all, if this seems like a game you'd enjoy, $17 CAD is a steal.

Yes, lots of new content was added, which is good, but the hardest part of the game, first ten levels, was made even harder by adding trapmasters, boss monsters and vile spirits of perished heroes (that idea was bad enough in Nethack but for ADoM it is even worse). There is no point in rich middle-game and end-game content if you can't survive the beginning. It seems to me making ADOM even more hardcore this way was a bad decision (while certain 'wrong' moments, like mutually-exclusive quests in Terinyo or hidden level restriction for Pyramid or Maze, are still here). Yes, there are 'easy' modes now but they give no sense of achievement and gameplay itself won't attrract new players. BTW, tiles are looking awesome but the perspective is wrong and misleading, especially for diagonal movement, and certain items are hard to see.

Игра за долгие годы своего развития, а старт её произошёл аж в далёком 1994 году, претерпела значительные изменения и обросла множеством новых возможностей и настроек, если честно, то при запуске игры я даже несколько растерялся и потерялся в этих самых настройках, благо весёлый и приятный саундтрек не заставил меня в это время унывать, пока я обследовал возможности и потаённые секреты игры.

Хотелось бы заранее дать небольшое предостережение – игра достаточно олдскульна и не поддерживает русский язык, из поддерживаемых языков только английский, а сам геймплей предполагает, что вам придётся достаточно много читать, чтобы постигнуть суть игры и её историю. И да, хотелось бы заметить, что былые рогалики это был лишь жанр с соответствующим графическим оформлением, нисколько не накладывающий ограничений на сам геймплей, который в данном случае представляет из себя полноценную RPG с массой скиллов, классов и рас и всё это с очень хардкорным многокнопочным управлением и таким же хардкорным геймплеем, так что будьте готовы первое время умирать практически от всего, что встретится вам на карте, пока не освоитесь немного в мире игры и не уловите её тонкую суть.

Масса различных врагов от банальных орков до драконов с различной живучестью, сложностью и скилами от отравления до нанесения кровоточащих ран не дадут вам расслабиться на протяжении игры и заставят вас думать и выбирать стоит ли идти в ту или иную локацию или стоит ещё немного подкачаться на более слабых соперниках, поднабраться опыта и вооружиться более серьёзным оружием, прежде чем заходить в пещеру к злобным монстрам.

Схватки в игре происходят в пошаговом режиме, что даёт нам некоторую свободу действий и возможность продумать каждое действие в конкретный момент.

Резюмируя, хотелось бы отметить, что игра прошла столь длинный путь от ASCII графики до современного её вида (хотя игра и позволяет олдфагам широкую настройку вплоть до олдскульного вида ASCII-графики в текстовом режиме), поддерживает практически все возможные десктопные платформы и представляет из себя одного из родоначальников жанра рогалик, перешедшего в нечто более серьёзное и переросшее собственный же жанр, ставшая, наверное, даже эталоном этого жанра по развитости и интересности, имеющая обширное коммюнити. Стоил ли её рекомендовать? Однозначно да! Но будьте готовы иметь неплохой словарный запас в английском языке или желание его хорошо подтянуть, а также будьте готовы умирать и умирать, прежде чем постигните суть игры и научитесь рассчитывать свои силы, навыки и умения под конкретную ситуацию. Однозначно, релиз в Стиме – это новая веха в истории игры и жанра как такового, стоящая пристального внимания со стороны как игроманов, так и игроделов, которым игра должна стать примером качественной проработанной и сделанной с душой игры.

例えば何も考えずに水に入ると、鉄製の装備はサビるし、巻物や書物は判読不能となり失うこととなる。
モンスターが祭壇の上に乗ったタイミングで神に祈れば、カオス寄りの神なら生贄として喜んで受け取り、秩序寄りの神からは不興を買う。
ちなみに、秩序の神の祭壇へ生贄を捧げ続けると、カオスの神の祭壇に変化する。
自分が信仰する神と祭壇の属性が一致していればアイテムの鑑定に利用できるため、場合によっては便利だ。
スキルの概念もあり、同じ武器や魔法を幾度も使用すれば対応するスキルが成長し、威力や命中率が増す。

倒したモンスターの遺体は、「ダンジョン飯」ばりに食べて空腹を満たすことができるが、
コボルドなどの一部モンスターはよほど不味いのか、状態異常を引き起こす。
どれが食べられて、どれはダメなのか…。
それはプレイヤー各自が経験から学んでいくことになる。

クエストをこなし、世界に点在するダンジョンを巡ってより良い装備を集め、キャラクターを成長させていこう。そして手遅れになる前に破滅の源を破壊するのだ。

本作は残念ながら日本語には非対応だが、（ローグライクということもあり）読まねばならないテキストは多くは無い。
そもそもADOM自体が古いゲームのため、ネットを探せば日本語の情報も見つかる。
そこまで言葉の壁に苦労することはないはずだ。

難易度は非常に高く、筆者なぞは90時間以上プレイしても未だに「＊＊勝利＊＊」の文字を拝んだことがないのだが、ハードなローグライクをプレイしたいと望む向きには強くオススメしたいタイトルだ。",1525950708,1525953100,True,35,0,0.801916003227233887,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has deep and fun old-school gameplay. It's very similar to Ragnarok if anyone remembers that. It has the same addictive gameplay of collecting items, identifying scrolls and potions and building your character.
The controls could be better. ""Steep learning curve"" really feels like a euphemism for poorly designed. For instance, why not just let the player light a torch from the inventory, and why have two different drop screens depending on how much you want to drop? This isn't a deal breaker though.
It was the roguelike elements that completely ruined the game for me. I've liked other roguelike games, but here I feel it is a detriment rather than an asset. The world map seems to be fixed, and the dungeon maps are so samey you wouldn't really notice that they were random until the third playthrough anyway. The random nature means that every once in a while, even on the first floor of a dungeon, you meet a monster against which you have no chance and you can't outrun... and then you have to take it from the top. There are a number of quite unfair ways you can die, which is normal for this kind of game, but starting again from the beginning when this happens is just frustrating. The first hour of the game is mostly grinding, and I just didn't have fun restarting for the n'th time.
In summary, I enjoyed the core gameplay, but the world doesn't seem to have been constructed with roguelike in mind. Because of this, for me, it came off like a standard late '80s RPG with the save function missing.

If you aren't put off by seeing this ""O"" as an ogre standing next to books even better. The creator has been selflessly working on this game since the early 90s (with a brief hiatus) and it is easily the most complex game I have ever played.  

Unlike many roguelikes it has a very nice progression system. As you explore the world, certain floors of dungeons and towns will be the same every playthrough. These act as benchmarks and obstacles to work towards instead of endless grinding. 

As many have said already this game is truly difficult. Sometimes it is unfair, but in order to play a REAL rogulelike like this you need to adjust your goals. This is NOT a game you will win within the first few months, even with heavy spoilers. I personally have still never beaten it after playing many thousands of hours over the past 7 years. It is devilishly hard, but the fun is in trying to overcome impossible situations using only your mind and your inventory. 

Just wait till you use your only only scroll of corruption removal after the narrator informs your wizard that, You Feel Apish. You remember your ancestors.

The game interface and turn based system is good, while many options have hot keys, using a mouse is an easy option. Outside of that, I can't recommend this game to people who are new to the series. I was not part of this game when it was first established and I think for most new players that is the issue. Why invest time in exploring this world? There is no core story driving you at the start, and so many people complain about quest fetching, i.e. go here, kill this, which is what this game seems to offer. The added features of permanent death, hunger (terrible feature), classes, attributes, and talents speak more as an offering of variety, and not truly an actual play difference. The hunger feature is the worst, I should not have to a) eat 3-4 times for exploring one floor and b) be encumbered by carrying food to eat so I am not hungered. A significant improvement would be to simply slow the rate of hunger during exploration of dungeons/towns. There are modes to turn off elements you don't like, but even then the core game will boil down to use missle weapons, funnel enemies to limit damage exposure, and pick up equipment, which doesn't drive any excitement because it doesn't have the modern touches of a Diablo that color codes the equipment, perhaps that belt is cursed or magical, who knows, put it on and see.

This is a negative review because this is a game played in 2018, but if I played this in the 90s, I would see the appeal. I understand classic games and cult classics, but I understand it is my nastalgia that makes me biased in saying it is a great game. Don't let the positive reviews sway you into thinking this game is more than what it is. One review discussed Tales of Maj'el *spelling (called TOME) is better, and I can only say, it felt easier to get into that game, but this game and that were on similar spectrums. If you really want this game, get it on sale.

Después de unas 200 horas... APRENDE A JUGAR, SIN DUDARLO, MERECE MUCHÍSIMO LA PENA.

Buenas,
No voy a explicar aquí qué es un roguelike, eso está mejor explicado en otros lugares de la red. 

Yo conocí este juego hace relativamente poco en uno de mis días de arqueología videojueguil, y ahora puedo decir que es un juegazo como la copa de un pino, siempre y cuando te guste el género, incluso aunque no hayas probado los roguelike pero sí te gustan los juegos de rol también [strike] lo amarás [/strike]te gustará.

No os voy a engañar, es un juego difícil, jod....ente difícil y frustrante, aunque ahora han añadido nuevos modos en los que puedes quitar la muerte permanente y bajarle un poco la dificultad en general para los recien llegados, lo que facilita el aprendizaje. 

Aún así el jugador que no conozca el género tendrá que tener en cuenta varios puntos (muros) que quizá lo abrumen y empequeñezcan:

         -Idioma, sí, está en inglés, es la primera barrera que nos encontramos y nos puede echar atrás. Con un nivel medio  bajo se entiende muy bien y lo que no pues al traductor.

         -Gran cantidad de comandos para introducir en el teclado, esto te lleva un par de tardes, no te agobies, al final siempre utilizas más o menos los mismos, pero al principio, sí parece un laberinto de teclas y símbolos. También se ha añadido ayuda en la pantalla principal sobre las teclas que pueden hacer falta en un momento determinado.

          -Llevo diez partidas y no paso la primera mazmorra... Eso es así, cuando lleves veinte ya habrás descubierto qué habilidades son más y menos útiles y te harás un personaje con más posibilidades de sobrevivir (que son pocas).

          -Por fin he aprendido a jugar, llevo una partida de diez horitas y.... ¡qué es eso!?, ¡no puedo huir!, ¿qué hago? ¿Cómo lo mato? ¡aaarrrrrffggggggfffggggg!.... ""you have died"". Regla número uno de este juego: no te encariñes con ningún personaje.

          -La corrupción es una de las mayores putadas que he visto en un juego, si ves que te empiezan a salir varios ojos, o tentáculos en vez de brazos estas jxxxido....[spoiler] busca al unicornio blanco[/spoiler]

Una vez que superas estas ""pequeñas"" barreras, tenemos ante nosotros un juego enorme, rico y variado. Posee una profundidad que pocas veces me he encontrado en cuanto a personalización de personaje, enemigos, misiones, diversos caminos que dependen de tus elecciones, varios finales y vuelvo a recalcar, una dificultad endiablada y unas putadas enormes escondidas tras cada esquina.
Mención especial a los gráficos, al principio se me hacían un poco raros, pero la verdad que tienen un estilo muy personal, ahora me encantan.

Poniendo todo esto de manifiesto animo a cualquier jugador que busque un reto a darle una oportunidad y superar las primeras trabas que el juego te coloca, obtendrás muchas horas de diversión y entretenimiento (y cuando te lo pases te sentirás el pxxto Dios de los videojuegos).

PROS:
+ Many characters and classes.

- Level-scaling enemies and dungeons.
- Crazy RNG - you may be stomping through a dungeon and then suddenly get one-shot by some nasty spawn.
- Cheesy enemies - there are enemies which auto-disarm you, enemies that confuse you, every cheese in the book.
- Cheesy zones - there is one zone which destroys all your items unless you have one particular rare item, about which you have to read online. 
- Grindy and slow.
- Identification is a huge hassle.

Not recommended unless you're willing to put up with a lot of baloney. If you do decide to play the game, I'd suggest save-scumming your way to the first victory so that you at least learn the ropes.

I'm so addicted! This game has pretty bad UX. There's quite a few things I hate, but I just can't stop playing it. It's fun.

Default keyboard shortcuts are awful. Ctrl z, then # to cast a spell. 0 to explore, p to pickup, directional keys to move. I don't have 3 hands, I can't be in all those places at once! 

It's annoying how bad the in game help is. I don't want to have to alt tab to lookup everything, just tell me what it is ingame!

Annoying ways I died to far: 
1) In a village, my wizard Chat'd some sort of giant. He got mad and double punched me and I died from full health.
2) Hunger. Seriously, I can die in like 5 hours of game time from hunger.
3) Miscasting magic missle. Well, hitting shift z 4 all the time and ONE TIME I ended up hitting ctrl z 4 4, which fired it directly into a wall, and it bounced and hit me 8 times. Yes, because I totally wanted to cast it sideways and not directly ahead at the monsters :\
4) ""Crushed to death by luggage"". Strength of atlas wore off.... sigh

I think I read some advice saying fighter better for newbies and wizard is harder. NO. Wizard is SO much easier. Fighter can't run away very well, Fighter has to worry ""if I melee attack this monster, will I be cursed/doomed/my weapon corrodes"", will this monster hit me once and cause some effect that lets him hit me 10 more times until I die?

Treasure Hunter is awesome, but it's annoying you have to know that you have to pick ""Alert"" as your starting talent to get it. How was I supposed to figure that out without reading online?

Healing is a complete pain, requiring some time, but monsters spawn regularly even in areas you just cleared.  Equipment has lots of hassles, from low carrrying capacity, to cursed things which nearly all classes can't detect.  They're frequently dropped, can't be removed, and rarely fall off.  However nearly all classes can't unlock doors so if you try to kick one open your new magic plate armor may be destroyed by the trap you set off, even if you searched that square 5 times before you kicked in the door. 

You can hardly find shops anywhere to dump your loot, and crappy options to buy.  Also too many annoyances like so many different types of arrows or quarrels (among 6 or so different missile types with their own skill), that you then have to pick up each time you shoot one and re-equip once each small pile runs out.  

Lots of creativity in the game, but takes ""rogue-like"" principle of avoid mistakes and just turns it into ""manage craptastic shitstorm.""",1515430595,1515430595,False,6,5,0.498469918966293335,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Also, note that I have minimal time in ADOM logged in Steam but I played it on and off for 3 years back before it was on Steam and beat it.  I mainly bought the Steam version to support the brilliant Developer!  I never sent him his postcard and for that I feel guilty - so I bought it instead, he certainly deserves the money.

So - 

Roguelikes like ADOM aren't necessarily about being 'fair' but instead are about risk management, survival, and learning.  Do I recommend ADOM?  Hell yes!

Some very minor spoilers exist below, plus a rambling anecedote about a real life survival training exercise - so, fair warning...

I remember one of the first times I played ADOM I kicked a staircase in a dungeon and the whole dang thing fell down on my head, killing my pretty successful character who had gone further than other runs up to that time!  I was like, what the hell was that?!?  I looked it up and it is a known thing that happens rarely.  Apparently if you kick stairs you can get a bonus (I think it builds strength?  It has been awhile), but occasionally it will kill you dead.  It is rare that kicking stairs will kill you - but it happened to me on the first try so I guess I won the anti-lottery.  

I quit ADOM for a few weeks in disgust, then went back and avoided kicking stairs :).  Eventually (after 3 years of on and off effort) I beat the game (Elven Archer) for the normal win (closing the chaos gate) and had low enough chaos I got a  good ending too.   This was all on an older ASCII version, not the Steam version.  I actually took my wife out to dinner and had a nice bottle of champagne to celebrate - few games actually make you feel like you achieved something for real, but I felt like I had done so when I beat ADOM!

So personally I rate ADOM as one of the greatest games I have ever played.  Don't let occasional unfairness deter you from playing it.  Swear a lot when you die, have a break, and try again when you are ready.

Fun fact - I later did a survival training walk in the Pilbara in Australia's outback - it was a five day hike starting out intot the wild with only two litres of water and a full belly (plus a basic survival kit and one of those lightweight survival blankets).  I wasn't alone (5 other students plus two instructors) but it was as close to a real emergency as could be 'safely' simulated - we had to find and purify our own water, improvise any tool besides our survival knives, forage for what food we could (or starve, we did a fair bit of that :), make our own shelter and fire, navigate for ourselves etc (we did have a somewhat out of date and high level map of the general area), and on the last day our instructors kindly abandoned us (they did give us a walkie-talkie in case something really went wrong :) and we had to reach the finish line without even their comforting advice (thats what they were there for really, to advise us, and teach us a last few things that you have to be in the field to learn, and also to maybe save our butts if we got bitten by a snake, but not to do the work for us - it was survival training!).  

Anyway, the point of this rambling story - at times on that walk, I found myself feeling like I was playing ADOM :).  It was all about resource management, cautious risk taking, maintaining what control you could - more over yourself than anything else really - and thus staying calm and clear thinking, preserving your health and wellbeing, and not giving up, no matter what.  It was tough, but man was it (masochistically) fun (and who woulda thunk you can find a pebbly pile of rocks as soft as a featherbed after 4 days of survival hiking.  Wow!)

But there you go - Roguelikes like ADOM can actually teach you some aspects of survival thinking. Now that's potentially handy!  

So if you have no other survival skills, but find yourself in a survival situation, try to think like you are playing a hardcore roguelike is my advice (but you know, if you die, you don't get to try again, so be extra roguelike!).  

So go play ADOM!",1515219946,1515220239,True,37,3,0.698255658149719238,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It had only had hard mode then, (you die your save deletes). Which is now an option instead of the only choice.
This game has come far in its changes and only has gotten better in that time. The creator has done marvels and adding more content and fixing issues. The game is definitely a learning curve game, you will need to learn how to deal with things or know what you need to prepare for some things and enemies. (DONT EAT KOBOLDS, my newbie mistake in the past.)

You will be able to enjoy hours and days playing ADOM. It uses a Fair lot of RNG moments, which can be mitigated with some prep with use of tactics, skills, and knowlegde.  As random as it can be, it gives you a good refreshing feel each game. Even if the refreshing feel is some unfortunate luck it will still be a enjoyable challlenge. Sure you can reroll a character or such to get a better start, but many other games allow that too. So if you like to power game and min/max things go right ahead. Knowlegde is a better weapon in this game then most things and you will get that in time. (or wiki it).

Overall I feel this game is a great Roguelike that will continue to polish out its rough spots and become an even greater Jewel to cherish for all to enjoy a RPG that is made with passionate care.

You want to lose a character you loved, come back and kill that SOB with your next guy with flaming fires of avenging RAGE!

Specifically there are creatures which with one hit can poison you, stun you, confuse, or paralyse you, any of these status affects almost always end up in instant deaths.

The game guides I have found are terrible at explaining hey if you see this type of creature stay away, there's no list like that anywhere I have found.

I first played the game back in Grade 10, back in 2004 (13 years ago) and thoroughly enjoyed the ASCII game back then. So, imagine my surprise when it got a successful launch of Indiegogo; I'd have joined onto that investment opportunity, but well, ADOM had faded from my mind by that point and wasn't actually looking for it. However, these days, I'm happy I didn't get on it, as I throughly regret purchasing ADOM Deluxe. 

When I first bought ADOM Deluxe, it had like 50% of the promised features on day one. Then, the developer went on a very long hiatus, holding up the development team, and we had no content updates for over a year and a half. I gave up on the game, sometime around June of 2017, of ever seeing an actual update to ADOM. Fast forward 6 months, and I found out that ADOM finally got a slew of major updates. So, I redownloaded the game to try it out.

Honestly, I should have just left ADOM on steam collecting dust. The interface changes are terrible; hell in the character creation screen, most of the text pops out of the interface boxes... a sign that things weren't going to be good. Created a new character, and most of the controls I've learned to use from the old ASCII build and the build I played back in Dec of 2016, are all changed. The interface and controls has been changed and not for the better. Being that the game forces you to know a ton of information, just to make it playable, forcing players to relearn a brand new interface and keybindings is too much.

Honestly, I'd suggest everyone to stick to the free, ASCII build. It was a pretty good game then, and it is now too, but you have to really dig to find it, and these days I have better things to do that relearn everything from scratch. If you want to support Thomas, then buy the game. But, if you want to play the game, don't bother with the Deluxe edition.

I'd stick around and offer advice on how to fix things, but honestly, the last time I tried to do that, the toxic community and the hostile development team, ate me alive. And watch, as they do so again!

tl;dr = Excellent game, just don't bother with the Deluxe edition; its just not worth it.",1513736314,1513736375,False,6,2,0.416364997625350952,9,True,False,False,False,,,

O jogo tem uma certa variedade de modos prontos (história, hardcore, challenge of the week, etc) que conseguem englobar diversos perfis de jogadores, mas se você não se encaixar em nenhum desses, também é possível customizar o seu jogo do jeitinho que você quiser. 

Os desenvolvedores têm lançado atualizações regularmente que melhoram cada vez mais a interface e a jogabilidade com o mouse, e facilitam o aprendizado dos jogadores novos (eu me incluo nessa).

Prepare-se para morrer muito durante suas aventuras, porque esse jogo realmente não perdoa! O positivo é que, a cada morte, você aprende algo novo e fica mais preparado para as próximas tentativas.

Uma boa dica é jogar com a Wiki do jogo aberta no celular ou algo do tipo, porque assim você conseguirá ter uma base melhor para não se perder dentro de ADOM.

 Se você está na dúvida se ADOM é para você ou não, eles têm uma versão gratuita disponível para download no site oficial do jogo.

I though that ADOM would be another success in that line of games that I would really embrace, and was really looking forward to playing it.  

And there are a lot of things that ADOM does well, such as a better graphics presentation than anything else not-named TOME or some character building options and decisions.  You also have the major keys you want to press that bring up various screens on the side of the UI so you can use hotkeys like every Roguelike player has had to do or you can just click and play that way.  Good job on those, ADOM!

I also enjoy the additions of leveling up with skills, training, the sign you were born under, and more, and the character design has more teeth to it than a lot of other games in the genre.  

There are a few qualms that I have though.  Most Roguelikes are hard, that's the point.  They are designed to be a challenge, and no less so with ADOM, especially in the early game. I give ADOM mad props for being tough too.  But where it errs is pushing that to design decisons that make the game require extensive foreknowledge or heavy subsequent plays to have a shot at winning.  I'll give you two examples of that in a moment.  But that is not a normal Roguelike tactic. I can pick up, and win at, Angband without reading the entire wikia first and five or six walkthroughs and watching YouTube videos.  Sure, I will get better as I play more, which is true of other games, but Angband and friends always played fair with you, even when it was playing hard.  I won Angband without scumming.  I never came close to beating Moria.  I almost beat Zangband, but lost in the final battle.  You get the idea.    


ADOM doesn't play fair.  It has design decisions that force you to know about ahead of time and plan for. 

Here are two examples, one early, and one later:

Early Example - In the first town, there are two mutually exclusive quests that you could come across by talking with one of two people there, and the first one you talk to gives that quest.  Since you have a quest coming into that town to talk to as many people in the first town as you can, you are talking to them anyways, as there is an in-game incentive to complete that quest.  But one of two quests gives you a prize thats good for some characters and not others, and vice versa.  I took the wrong quest becuase I didn't know that the town had two quests that are mutually exclusive, and they don't even need to be.  Both create seperate dungeons and characters, and you certainly could do them both.  Without knowing the rewards ahead of time, you miss out on a major quest reward early.  


Middle Game Example - There is a dungeon in the game called the pyramid that you cannot get to until you're of a high enough level.  I entered it when I arrived in the vicinity with my Halfling Duelist and was told I didn't have an invite.  Then around level 14 I found a papyrus and read it, and I was invited for a challenge at the pyramid. Now's that's totally fine up until now.  You have dungeons that open up later pretty often in lots of RPGs, including Roguelikes such as Zangband.  I finished my dungeon delve of this 12 level dungon and then by the time I had finished I had reached level 17, and then I stepped out, dropped off some of my extra gear at this oasis I found, and then went to the pyramid.  But I couldn't enter it.  Why not?  I still had the papyrus with me.  So I looked it up on the Wikia.  And this is a major and very important dungeon to complete because the ruler has two major guaranteed artifacts you really want to snag.  And the issue was that you can only enter it from levels 13-16.  I was too high to do that challenge.  I saw that one of the items, a special armor, is one that is perfect for my class, and really helps you survive long term, and I missed out.  

That's ADOM.  Design decisions have been made about the game but have not been communicated to you as a player.  The papyrus that invited me to the pyramid didn't say that I couldn't arrive after level 16 and it was a limited time offer.  The quest in the first city never said that if I accepted it I couldn't do another quest instead.  

So the result is a game that appears, with the investment of a few hours, to be a sturdy entry into the Roguelike genre, but the more I delve into it, the more I realize that this is not a game that plays fair with me as a player.  And why would I want to continue to play that sort of game after already investing more than 20 hours into it? 

This could have been a game I would easily have seen myself with 100+ hours.  But there are these horrible design choices that don't respect me as a player or give me the agency to change them in the game.  That's a major philosophical issue that I hope the game cleans up.  And if it does, and becomes more player friendly with inforamtion in the game, or changing up some of those design decisions, then I would certianly be open to revisiting this review and the game itself.  But that's not today.  And it's likely not tomorrow either.  


It's okay to be hard.  It's not okay to hide information that makes the game harder.",1513563655,1513564135,False,520,24,0.79285353422164917,43,True,False,False,False,,1514021402.0,"Thanks for the extensive comments.

I agree with you (somewhat) on the pyramid issue - there could be a hint about this being a timed quest that only is available for a limited amount of time. Please note two things though: (a) It is highly unlikely that you will win the game on a streak that first gets you to the pyramid - so normally you'll not lose anything as you will have learned about the time limit after one game. (b) While the rewards are very good they are still not required in any way to win. So it's not like you are truly losing something important.

Nonetheless I get your point and have added an RFE to address this issue in one of the next releases: http://www.adom.de/forums/project.php?issueid=5863

I personally disagree about your comments on the mututally exclusive quests in the village... as neither of it is truly important for solving the game and there are so many different venues you can take in the beginning that it IMHO just doesn't matter. BTW the (a) argument from above also applies here: Probabilities are basically zero that you are going to win on your first, second or third game - so by the time you have learned enough you'll know about the exclusivity.

The design philosophy behind this is basically that choices matter - being able to do everything at any time is quite easy for the player, but I prefer forcing you to make difficult choices. That's also why I agree about the pyramid point because you (1) don't even get to know abut being forced to make a choice and (2) the rewards are a lot more important than the ones in the village choice.

In summary: Thanks for your feedback and sorry for you not being able to enjoy ADOM as much as you should due to my conscious choices. 

Merry Christmas nonetheless!"

The idea of a title with complex, emergent gameplay with an evident and long history of development gave me strong Dwarf Fortress vibes.
    ADOM is probably one of the more Rogue-like roguelikes you can find on Steam. The game is stuffed with content, including dozens and dozens of ways to meet your demise. If you survive, the game promises many rewards. You can become a king, or achieve godhood. Neither of which I experienced, because in my few hours of the game I simply stumbled into various ways to die within 24 hours.
    I had mild frustrations with the controls and UI. Usually the mouse would be sufficient to navigate and find the information I wanted, but sometimes I would find myself confused on why a spell didn't fire correctly or how to perform certain actions. Understandable considering it's history, but that doesn't mean I'm still not a spoiled modern gamer. Evidently the game will be getting an updated rerelease sometime soon, which I expect will resolve some user unfriendliness.
    I'd highly recommend this game if you're deep into roguelikes, difficult games, or imaginative adventures. I'd also recommend this title if you missed out on 90s PC gaming and want a little taste of history.

-A little too expensive for what you get

-Developer assumes gender
-Developer ignores parts of reviews he doesn't feel like addressing
-Developer claims he doesn't make any money on a $15 game
-Developer claims anyone who doesn't LOVE his game is a rude, dumb troll

I didn't even know that you could do that. Which leaves my snarky remark as the only remaining comment from me and shifts the picture more negatively than it IMHO originally appeared.

To repeat the factual points I raised in my now deleted comment:
- It seems that the review does not relate to the most recent release but an older version as many aspects (like tedious keymapping, missing hints and guidance) have been addressed. As we try very hard to improve the game based on feedback I advised the reviewer to once more try out the latest release and see if it felt improved for him.
- I commented on being expensive with the statement that this IMHO is a highly subjective matter. I strongly believe in adding value instead of in engaging in endless discount battles and that's a point to which I stand firmly. I can't feel that the price of a single movie ticket is too expensive for any decent game at all and I believe that ADOM is more than decent enough to be rated at that price level.
- I do not think that ADOM easily screws your character. Examples would be welcome, flat bland statements do not make for a good or helpful review.
- Regarding repetitveness I pointed the review to the various modes in all the latest releases that allow you to create a new character (even with extensive customization) with 3-6 clicks (and a name you need to enter). Which hardly can be called repetitive any more. It takes about 5 seconds to generate a new character if you know what you want to play. Naturally if you check all choices and optimize attributes to the last bit this can take much longer. But that is not necessary to enjoy or win the game and thus a conscious player choice.
- And about me being unprofessional: I'm sorry for reacting with an attitude after you snarked at my initial comments which tried nothing but to explain. I believe I'm taking a lot of time and effort to listen to the player community in general and respond appropriately. What I'm done with after 25 years of doing this is taking people seriously who are rude, dumb, trollish or simply unfactual. Yes, then I'm also leaning towards reacting likewise because I am a human being that spent most of those 25 years doing this for fun in my free time without earning money for it. And I come from a generation where burning down trolls was a good sport. But that doesn't mean you generally will find me unprofessional. I welcome you to discuss this with me face to face at Roguelike Celebration next week in San Francisco if you happen to be around that area (see https://roguelile.club). And I'm happy to offer buying you a meal to soothen any hurt feelings.

ADOM is exemplary in game design, has a multitude of options and is, for the most part, fair. With any roguelike game, imagination plays a key part (the main reason I still play in ASCII, although I must say that the tiles on this Steam release are of a very high quality indeed and will please those whol prefer graphics) and therefore the feel of a game can be most personal to the player. ADOM has just enough fluff and detail in-game to really allow the imagination to play: you can bump your way through many of the early dungeons without much thought for this and without some of the classic RPG elements this might get a little dull, but I think Thomas Biskup has gotten the mix of ingredients just perfect.

ADOM is incredibly deep. Pun intended - the game is a dungeon crawler after all. I've spent 120 hours and have yet to make it beyond the first area. I'm not much of a Gray Elven Bard, it would seem.

I started playing ADOM approx 15 years ago. It was released 21 years ago on DOS. It is fair to say that this game has replay value and longevity.

With the Steam launch and the NotEye graphics version I find this game to be more approachable as the game provides easier visual clues as to what sort of monsters/items are shown on screen instead of having to remember what is a pink left parenthesis and what is a green at sign.

Overall my score for this game is 4/5 -- I take one away for all the damned one-shots Biskup has reigned down my up-n-coming heros.

With more seriousness though, if you're here reading this, I assume you know what a rogue-like (as opposed to a rogue-lite) is, and what that means in terms of a high learning curve and general gameplay difficulty.
I constantly read the Ancardia Wiki (that's the only way I learned about shift+'f'), and I constantly get my rear-end sliced off and handed to me on a plate. Sometimes I forget I have a healing spell or have a wand, sometimes I just die in an early dungeon to falling rocks or fireball traps, and sometimes I make decent progress, let it go to my head and then get in over my head, and get swarmed by things I can't kill. But I keep coming back for more, because that's the kind of masochist I am.

*spoilers*
Someday, I will make it past level 20 before I get into a situation where I'm in over my head.
Someday after that, I will get really lucky and save Khelevaster, but still die in combat a couple floors down when I had an unidentified wand that would have saved my life.
Someday far in the future, I will be a couple steps from godhood, able to put all of ChAoS at my mercy... and then die once again to random rocks falling from the ceiling because I'm low hp from the aftermath.
And perhaps someday, years down the line, I will beat this game. I will sigh, and slump down into a heap... and play again because I still will have only gotten a normal ending.

I was also very sceptical about the GUI as my experience related to that in rogue likes have been negative.  So I usually prefer ASCII graphics. But I found no issues with the ADOM GUI and it kind of brings the whole new level to the game. I find the monster graphics to be well considered since I often guess the monster without even checking it. 

I'm not fan of whole achievement idea in games generally, because I find them worthless and boring to grind. But this game already had agreed achievements back then like eternium man and such, which you can now achieve officially. Definitely going to try to finish some of the most challenging ones after I finish game few times  :)

For new players the ADOM must be a hard game to get into, but it has so much reply value and depth. Usually every death teaches you something new, so don't give up. Also read game tips and Google things.

Without a doubt one of my all time favorite games. I have been playing since 97 when a friend gave it to me on a floppy disc. In no time I was hooked and have been playing since.

On that note, this is a real rogue like game. Much cleaner and better built than Nethack or it's close relatives (Slash/Slash'EM) in my opinion. Well worth the $15 and over coming the learning curve. Typical of rogue like games the learning curve here is a bit steep, but I found it rather enjoyable as well.

It is completely possible to play this game ""unspoiled"". Everything you need to know to win the game is in the game. NPCs can give you hints, or my favorite is to eat fortune cookies and learn a little something about the game from the message inside. No need to go to the internet to learn the things you need to know, which is a common problem with games of this depth these days. If you want to read ahead and learn from other's experience the communty has documented a ton of stuff to help you understand all the little corners of this game.

This game started as an ASCII roguelike and pretty small, now it is graphical and but not pretty big. It's colossal.

First of all before you start the game you have to understand that the game has kind of a learning curve, there will be a lot of deaths caused by things you did not expect. If you especially hate starting over, the game is not for you. I hate starting over too but not enough to deter me from this masterpiece. There are so many race/class combinations to give you a new kind of game that you are mostly just excited to try again with different tools - if your high elf wizard died early to some trivial door trap, start over with a troll beastfighter. Now you maybe cannot read but hey, the trap that killed the flimsy elf only tickles you. Maybe use those spellbooks you find as missiles now? And if you die again perhaps try a more stealthy approach as a gnomish assassin. You get the idea. 

The monster library is endless and the game story is intriguing, I dunno how anyone can have the intelligence and creativity required to make this game happen but I am glad someone did. It's a very complex and unforgiving RPG - to be able to beat the game honestly you will need a lot of time, brains, patience, nerves and also some luck.

You do not have to memorize tons of keyboard commands to play ADOM. There's even floating text windows that appear when you mouse over certain things.

ADOM is now streamlined and very user friendly!  I almost didn't purchase this game because of the negative reviews concerning the multitude of keyboard commands. So if you were on the fence about purchasing this game but was worried about having to memorize many keyboard command, it's not true any longer.  You can use your mouse for ""most"" of the commands.  I never needed to use the keyboard once...

Just by my brief session with the game, I can assure you that this is a quality game made with a lot of love!  There are many options covering all aspects of the game.  The UI is basic, but again has many options and is also mouse driven.  This game has been steamlined and looks to be one of the best roguelikes I have played.  So far I would recommend this game, but I have not played it long enough to really review it.  

So far the game has runs silky smooth on my computer, but crashed when I quit the game.

Но что еще меня заинтересовало... сложность! Черт побери, это самая сложная игра, в которую я играл. У тебя просто нет права на ошибку. Увидел молоха или кармического дракона? Ищи в своем рюкзаке что тебе может помочь. Не нашел? БЕГИ!

Огромное разнообразие рас и персонажей. Огромное количество монстров. Одно не радует, квестов довольно мало и практически все они являются сюжетными. Нет, это не плохо и не хорошо, но можно было бы и при перезапуске добавить гораздо больше квестов.

ADOM is (originally) an extremely hard, ascii based rouge-like which has been around on multiple formats since the late 90's. Personally I think it's by far the best traditional rogue-like, and I've tried a few over the years.

Is it worth paying fifteen bucks to play a game you can get for free without the graphics/sound? Hell yeah! The only thing I can think of which is wrong with it is the text can be a bit small, but then the display has more lines, so it evens out I guess.

Even with what would easily be over five hundred hours playing this game over the last 15+ years or so, first on Amiga, then on Windows. I've only ever completed this game once, and even then I was cheating by backing up my save file. Something which is uneccesary in this Steam version, as there is the option to disable perma-death in exchange for a big reduction in points. There are also options to selct optimal birth month, stat rolls, etc. Which saves a LOT of time if you play ADOM as I do with a specific charachter class in mind.

The graphics and sounds actually add quite a bit to the gameplay.  Especially the sound which allows you to hear if you've hit or missed or been hit. And graphics for example; It's much easier to locate the tiny girl in Terinyo when you can see a graphic of a tiny girl instead of a red ""t"" which under the Windows version could look almost identical to an orange ""t"" on some monitors.

For those who are unfamiliar with ADOM, even if familiar with other rogue-likes such as Angband, the keyboard configuration will seem a bit alien. But the list of keybindings is readily available in-game by pressing ""?"" as well as on the title screen, so it shouldn't take too long to get comfortable. For those familiar with ADOM, you'll be pleased to know that it's exactly the same.

Oh, and I don't know if I'm just being distracted by the beautiful hand-pixelled graphics and atmospheric music, but it seems to be just a little bit harder that the text-based ADOM, especially the small mountain cave.

A new set of graphics and mouse support are completely redundant if the core game will still play by utilising your entire keyboard including ALT, CTRL, and Capital and non capital letters. It is ridiculous to try and revive and modernise it without addressing those core issues.

Otherwise, you could always save scum like I do. 

ADOM save file folder location: 
My Documents\ADOM\adom_steam\savedg

Then you can create a .bat file for the save file backups. 

Create a folder called ""backup"" 

Then create a backup.bat file

backup.bat
echo off
copy yourcharactername.svg backup

then a restore.bat file

restore.bat
echo off
delete yourcharactername..svg
copy backup\yourcharactername..svg

Then you can enjoy ADOM with a character save backup.

With an alignment system that means you can be gifted artifacts from a god or be smote where you stand(unless you can work out how to avoid it ;) ) ADOM allows you to do, within the games mechanics, anything you wish; from using a corpse as a throwing weapon all the way up to surviving an angered gods rage as a pacifist.

Equipment is plentiful for all slots with many base types, prefix's, suffix's, bless/curse and extraneous things such as rust. Not only do you have an inventory and equip slots so to do the monsters with some being smart enough to decide to drop their broken heavy spear in favour of a blessed two-handed sword of sharpness.

The only downside, for some people, is the graphics; With the choice between ASCII(text) or Sprite-based those that are looking for ""pretty"" wont find it here.

ADOM is a pretty venerable one, not quite as old or well-known as games like nethack but it's an important one. Why? Well, one thing people attribute to roguelikes pretty often is that they are hard and obtuse. To a certain degree this is true, but not always. Playing a valkerie and knowing how to write Elbereth makes nethack pretty easy, or you can play something like Dredmor or a Mystery Dungeon game to have an easier time. 

But ADOM takes being weird and hard to higher levels. Cats are a constant menace. Funny lizards make you think that wasn't a good idea. Why does this level have so many corpses in it and why does my mouth have tentacles in it? ADOM probably won't give you the answers to these questions without making you work for it. 

And yet we find ADOM here on Steam, with shiny new features that make playing an old fashioned roguelike a little more palatable for people who weren't doing it in the 90s. The updated tileset is excellent, letting characters have personality and making the screen much more clear than the old ASCII symbols while retaining the ability to switch back when you want to see the whole level at once. Perhaps the biggest change is the ability to save and reload (at the cost of reducing your final score, of course). This makes the many, many fatal mistakes that one can encounter in the Draklor Chain a little less punishing. It might not help you from starving right off, but it could keep you from losing right at the start in the Puppy Cave. Then there are the weekly challenges, to add spice to players who are constantly looking for new ways to play. 

All things considered, ADOM is a classic roguelike and the Steam release has a lot to recommend it. If you are a fan of newer roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or Dungeons of Dredmor and want to dip into older titles, this is the place to be.

here are some interesting ways the game will kill you:
-choked to death on your own vomit
-dungeon roof collapses upon you
-turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos
-crushed to death by the weight of your equipment
-old age
-slain by an angry pet
-drowned
-turned to stone by a gorgon's breath
-turned to stone by eating the corpse of a gorgon
-bolted by your god after gravely offending them
-being sacrified to another creature's god
-instantly killed by a death ray
-burned by impure metal as a mist elf
-eaten by a grue
-your worn ring of the master cat explodes because you killed a cat
-your worn platinum girdle slowly squeezing you to death because you sinned
-blown up by an exploding item after you polymorphed it into itself

Trouble is, even when you enjoy other rogue-likes (TOME, angband variants etc) ADOM is still REALLY complex with the command interface. It's a whole other level of complex. If you know how to use Vi, then you'll probably love ADOM, the rest of us probably just get annoyed. It's just too steep a learning curve to be that enjoyable.

Seriously, at one point in the tutorial it says you can drop stuff on the altar, and to do that you can press 'd', or ':d' or '<ctrl>d'. WTF... And that's just one command... 

If you know and love ADOM, you'll probably love this version too. But I didn't. I'm under 2 hours, so I'm going to get a refund I think. I've been playing rogue-likes long enough now to know this just ain't for me...

There is so much to do and so many ways to do them. A single run where I made it almost halfway through the game took me 14-15 hours (don't worry you can save). No two runs can be similar in any way shape or form; the story is always different. The Steam version is the product of [b]22 years of development[/b], and it just got an update recently. You won't find many games with more content than ADoM has to offer.

Keep in mind, however, this being an old-school roguelike, ADoM is by far the hardest game I've played in my life. It is 1 of the 4 ""big roguelikes"" as people like to honk about, the others being Angband, Crawl, and NetHack, which are not on Steam, but free to download as well.



If you can stomach the ""learning how to play"" aspect of the game, this is among the best games money can buy you.

It was top of the line in its day and drove very well at the time. For a number of years, it's been sitting in a garage, and the owner recently decided to bring out the car, spruce it up, and get it back on the road. The paint has been touched up, the upholstery has been redone. The car was made before a lot of features you'd expect today were put in, so the owner has got seatbelts put in, and a new sound system, and some other odds and ends. But a lot of the car is still the same... it runs on a diesel engine, standard transmission, no power steering. It's a beautiful car, but it is still, in many respects, a product of its time.

ADOM is much the same. It's a fantastic game. It has more depth and complexity than just about any game out there, and is fiendishly challenging without being unfair (mostly). I've put in more hours into ADOM than probably any other game I've played, donated happily to the Indiegogo campaign, and look forward to the new developments as they come out. But if you've never played Rogue-likes from the 90s, you'll probably be in for a shock, much like if you've never driven without power steering, you'll be in for a shock the first time you try to drive without it. The interface is admittedly clunky, and despite the dev team's best efforts to modernize it, the learning curve is still pretty steep, and figuring out how to perform a given action (let alone when you ought to perform that action) isn't always transparent. I can imagine a lot of players finding this off-putting, and I think if you look at the negative reviews of this game, this is very much the kind of sentiment you'll see. This game isn't for everybody; due both to its difficulty and to its aesthetic, it will probably only appeal to a certain segment of players. Like the classic car.

If you've played ADOM before, you'll probably love it as much as you did then.

Hit 't' and game said, ""Try using a bow."" Hit 't' again, ""Try using a bow x2.""
Decided to switch to bow, but when I tried to remove the wand, found out it was cursed and couldn't be removed.
Equiped bow in my left hand instead. Hit 't' again, ""Try using a bow.""

Hit 'Esc' to back out and try again, but 'Esc' brought up another list of commands, none of them were quit.

No, I'm here because I have this bottle of wine and this wonderful game and all I wanted, besides rambling on Steam, was to give my thanks. So here's to you Mr. Biskup! Thank you for a wonderful game! I'm too lazy to complete the postcard quest, but I can at least drink this glass of wine in your honor. 
I was struck by this compelling need to write a few words about ADOM while trying another game. I won't name it but it's also free and also highly regarded by many. I already had a bit of experience with ADOM but nothing to compare it against. I quickly decided that the 2nd game is not my cup of tea, but it helped me realize what a gem ADOM really is. I played it quite a while, first the free version and then the Steam version, and I am still charmed by its music, by its atmosphere, by its depth. Even the minimalist tileset is charming.
Now I have all this hunger to master the game. It's slowly becoming an addiction, trying to go deeper or further than the last time. I'm learning bits and pieces and having a grand time. It's like learning to juggle, every time adding one more ball to an already incredible act. Even death is sometimes fun. Last night I laughed as I died, heavily poisoned, right after emerging victorious close to HMV. The Gods were tired of my nagging to them and chose not to answer me.

This review is coming from someone who has not played the original games in the series and has no prior knowledge, and from someone who didn’t grow up playing this type of game either. Please bear that in mind with this review. 

Gameplay is like any other roguelike game, where you get to choose from an array of different characters, and develop levels, statistics and skills as you progress.  The game is played from a top down angel and is very heavily weighted towards stats and what choices you make in whether you succeed or fail.  The game’s tutorial absolutely bombards you with way too much information which personally left more confused compared to when I first started. The controls and UI are quite possibly the worst I have ever experienced in a game too. There is quite literally a different button for every single mechanic in the game. This game made me feel sufficiently stupid because of how much jumble there is on any one screen at any time. The game was telling me to use buttons that I don’t think I have ever used on this keyboard. I am surprised this is one of the most popular roguelikes ever just from going off the usability of the game thus far. 

The graphics are bad, there is no way around it and anyone who says otherwise is purely saying it from a nostalgia standpoint.  The pictures in the screen shots are definitely not what the game looks like on my screen, and I was playing the game in 4k. 

I am still stuck in the tutorial of the game, because of being dumbfounded with the controls and the amount of information being thrown at me but this game if you manage to get into it, will offer you hours and hours of content with a very high replay ability factor also being the main reason behind this. 

I am fully expecting this review to not be very popular given that I have reviewed it before even getting out of the tutorial; and I am clearly missing something about this game since it is so highly rated. But for me, having not grown up playing this type of game, and from someone who is not able to take in abundant amounts of information and learning the most whacky confusing control scheme, I simply cannot recommend it. It is possibly a generation thing, but if you mostly agree with my reviews and enjoy the same games I do, then you may want to eerie on the side of caution when trying this out as it is simply a game I did not enjoy at all.

[h1]Impressions and thoughts:[/h1]

ADOM is one of the 'Gods' of the traditional roguelike genre, starting as a MS DOS game in 1994, continually being  development to this day.  It features several dozen different dungeons, some with fixed layout and others randomly generated each time you play.  It also has an 'overworld' adventure map, which was an unique feature in ADOM's young days.

There are a lot of different character types you can make from a big selection of races and classes who can pursue multiple different endings.  Save the world from ChAoS as a Troll Paladin, or maybe take the place of the elder chaos god Andor Drakon as a Hurthling Farmer? Anything goes.

ADOM has always been and will continue to be freeware, downloadable from the developer site adom.de.  Recent features include the graphical Noteye tileset that vastly improves the visual appeal.

On Steam, the Deluxe version promises a slew of additional features, many of which at the time of this review several months after release have not been realized in the game.  This is a point worthy of critique.  The small development team working on ADOM have always done things in their own pace, which is perfectly fine for a freeware hobby project.  However with a Steam release comes expectations of promises being delivered on.  As much as I love the devs and the wonderful game they've created, this must be pointed out.  While ADOM is a complete game in its own right, the DELUXE version is far from complete.

That bit of complaining aside, ADOM is a beautiful game.  It is a brutal, oldschool roguelike with such a staggering depth that even with the community wiki on hand, it can take years to uncover all its tricks and secrets.  It will kill hundreds of characters, often just when you felt they were getting somewhere before you can even think about beating the whole game.  It has the replayability for the game to still be addicting to play for all those attempts, with all its character variations and random generated nature.  In fact, I recommend this game not for the story and reaching its ending, but for all the journeys your poor doomed characters embark on before they inevitably get crushed.

If you like turnbased dungeon crawling, traditional roguelikes with deep systems that you will keep learning new things in even after years of playing, ADOM comes strongly recommended.  However!  I would suggest playing the freeware version on adom.de first.  Unless you just want to support the developers of course (which you should!).  The Deluxe version of the game on Steam doesn't as of yet add much of features to justify a price tag.

I played this game by myself and I have played with friends who had set up linux shells with this game on it and we would compete for high scores. I cannot overstate how much enjoyment this game has brough to my life.

This game is tough as nails and it has punished and brutalized me more times that you can imagine. 
And I loved every second.
I have put hundreds if not thousands of hours into ADOM. 
And it was all for free. 
I saw this on the store and bought it instantly. Not a second thought.

Hilariously, even with the new mouse controls, I still play totally with the keyboard. 
After all these years, I still remember every key. This game is in my blood.

I feel I must caution new players who might be thinking of trying this game out that you may find the learning curve a bit intimidating, but please persist. The experience this game provides when you are confident that you know what you are doing is just pure golden. One moment of carelessness may get you killed, but you know that it was your fault. 
Take every character's death as a teaching moment.

Thomas Biskup absolutely deserves every penny of my money.
I know how much effort he has put into this game, his labour of love.
He really deserves my money for all the laughs, the tears, the near misses, the terrifying moments, the foolish mistakes and miscalculations, the mystery, the discovery, the pain, and the joy he has brought to me through this game.

Wrote my own program to auto-backup the saves so I could cheat permadeath when I wanted to. I have played many dungeon crawl games, including Rogue, the OG of the genre. Out of them, this is one of the best. 

A large open world (for the genre) full of quests and NPCs. There is plenty to do and see in ADOM as well as a large selection of Class/Race combanations. The mechanics are perfect. This game was created based on PnP rpgs like DnD, and attempts to recreate this as much as possible. There are a ton of hidden rolls, and many are refrenced in the text. The text really makes it feel like a tabletop rpg, well written and really sets the tone.

ADOM is also Random and unpredictable. You may die on the way to your first town, killed by enemies you stood no chance against, or kick down a door  to find a large demon ready to rip your head off. With permadeath on it is a hardcore dungeon delvers wet dream come true. This game is hard.

But now there are options to turn certain features, like permadeath, off. This opens the door for people like me, who enjoy the style, but dont like always playing a hardcore character. It also makes it easier to really enjoy the story and world without fear of losing your character . The graphics are not cutting edge, and I for one am glad. This is the update the game needed. Havent fiddled with the other game modes, but I theres just so much to do. I am also glad development seems to be continueing, so there may be more content to come. 

So there you go, I love this game, totally worth my money.  If you are into old skool Rogue-Likes and value depth over fancy graphics I think you will too.

This game is still an awesome game and I have enjoyed it a lot more than most modern games I've played these days.

Pros: 
Replayability
-Most areas are all randomly generated (save for a couple special places)
-Item drops and artifacts you get are random (you never no what you will get, good or bad)
-You can play the same character type again, and it will feel totally different from your first playthrough!


Tons of Content
-Many areas explore
-Plenty of quests to tackle
-Multiple endings (you can beat the game quickly or try and complete an ultra ending)

Customizability
-Many classes to choose from (ranging from easy to difficult in terms of playstyle)
-Many races to also choose from (you can be a Human, Dwarf, Elf, Drakeling, Orc and more!)
-The new point buy system is awesome and more improved! Make your fighter have lots of strength and toughness but little learning
-Different playstyles: You're wizard doesn't have to wear cloth robes only, have him wear plate armor and attack with weapons (assuming you got the strength for it ;))

Graphics/UI/Music
-The graphics and UI are very nice looking, especially after this update. The animations are nice as well, and soon there will character customization (I'm really excited for this one)!
-The UI updated also looks very good (although it does have a tendency to get in the way when your character is at the top of a map. Hopefully this gets fixed soon)
-The music has also been improved as well, and there are a lot of good tracks in this game

Support
-Game is still being supported years after it came out 
-New content is planned even after this new update (new artifacts, levels, quests; Go check out the adom forums or the creators twitter for previews)

With any good game, there are also some cons:

Cons:
Difficulty
-When learning how to play, the game can be rather harsh (hunger, corruption, etc.). The difficulty barrier isn't as large as something like Dwarf Fortress, but it is there. You have to be able to learn from your mistakes. If you can't do that, this game might not be for you. If you stick with it though, it's a rewarding game.
-If you do have problems, the community is quite helpful (as long as you are willing to learn). There is an active adom community in the steam forums as well as in the roguelikes discord chat. Feel free to stop by!
-You can also turn off certain things like hunger and corruption, or you can also play with reloadable games if you want to play that way

Key Bindings: 
-This game has so much in it, and there are a lot of key bindings that are somewhat unintuitive. If you might not be able to figure it out, it can be quite frustrating. The game does give quick hints now, so its helpful, but this complaint is one I see a lot from negative reviews, and I do agree with it. 

Bugs:
-Like many games, there are always going to be bugs you run into, and ADOM is no exception. The game runs quite well, but every now and then you will run into something that might be a problem. If that does happen, be sure to submit a bug report, otherwise they wont be able to be fixed.

Tedium:
-One thing that I might complain about is there is a small amount of tedium in the game. You have be constantly eating, sacrificing for piety, managing inventory, avoiding cats, going to certain areas at certain times etc. It's not a huge deal, as imo it adds an interesting twist to the game. However, it might be a turn off for some people, so I thought I would just bring that up.
-A lot of knowledge can be found from the adom wiki, which is maintened quite well by the community. 

Past these cons, I love this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves roguelikes!

If you are on the fence about this game, there is a free version you can download from here: http://www.adom.de/home/downloads.html

It's a much older version, but soon it will be updated with some of the new content.",1454903131,1509563054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have been playing for at least 10 years and the new steam version adds some welcome changes.

I love this game simply because it has all the awsome features you would expect from a roguelike but with a world map.
The world map is always the same and features a lot of entrances to dungeons and villages, each being different in sometimes a variety of ways, and for the most part are randomized every game. this leaves you free to pick and choose which quests you want to take. Once you have figured out a lot of the early quests you can choose to skip the ones in which the rewards do not interest you.

My one criticism of this game is that the religion system sucks. It's not interesting, the rewards for becoming uber pious are kind of lackluster when i consider how grindy and unenjoyable reaching that point is. Fortunately it is not necesary to concern yourself with it. I compare this game in this regard to dungeon crawl and IVAN which both have interesting and fun religion systems.

Another aspect of this game that i like compared to other roguelikes, such as dungeon crawl, is that the skill system is very rewarding. some skills are passive and just buff your character but others have specific applications.
you can pick pockets, pick locks, build bridges, craft arrows, tame animals, brew potions, smith armour...
For me this adds a layer of character that helps me role play.

I recomend this game however if you do not have any experience with roguelikes i suggest you do some reading about the genre as this game is brutal and, other than the games basic mechanics, this is mostly a trial by fire.

This game is very unforgiving, so newbies to the RPG gerne beware.  If you haven't played many ""classics"" like baldur's gate, icewind dale ect. You will maybe feel a bit alienated on the D&D based mechanics. None the less, once you understand the system it is very logical and mathematic. 

Anyone who has played a decent amount of RTS games or MMORPG's will not have a hard time learning and memorising the different keys used to play the game. There are quite a few different commands and key combinations, it can seem intimidating at first. Honestly, there's only about 10-15 commands you will actually use early game. You learn everything fluently as you play by occasionally going into the help menu for key bindings.

The game is quite unforgiving and does require a lot of trial and error. It will teach you to be careful and methodical. Also with the perma-death feature, you will have to learn how to leg it. All in all I feel the game is very fair. There are occasional frustrating deaths like getting critical hit by a rat who you thought was absolutely no threat but most of the time it is your own fault if you died. 

I would definately recommend this game to anyone who love's very indepth and challenging RPGs.

The controls are clunky and the game requires too much memorization of key bindings to play.

Now ADOM is on Steam and for ~15 euro you can experience one of the hardest, most challenging, vague (in terms of ""what should I do now?"") and merciless games of all time.

That means permadeath after 30hrs of game, that means all your scrolls getting soaked because you forgot to grab that damned blanket, that means drowning, because the ice you created with ice bolt just cracked and you and all your belongings are gone, that means getting burned because one of your fire resistance rings isn't blessed, that means almost crying when you see game message stating: *THUMP*. Finally that means checking every class combination and getting acquainted with ADOM Bible or some other, newer guidelike stuff, because you think that there is some magic formula, a cheat, a ""best class combination -> enter google"" that will allow you to ""win"". That if you create a trollish healer born under the Candle star sign, you will magically plow through the Caverns of Chaos and win the game. 


And then, on level three of some random dungeon you stumble upon undead vault.


ADOM went through a lot during over 20 years of development - now you have graphics engine, you can choose a lot more during character creation, finally - you have a ""cheat engine"" so to speak, so you can try to go through the whole game without permadeath - as far as I understand, I've never tried this mode, because ADOM is in a way something that games like ""Dark Souls"" aspire to - you die, you learn, you die again. After a thousand deaths, you die once more, but you try again. 

During the ""ADOM hiatus"" a lot of other games emerged - ToME, Elona, and finally - a lot of lighthearted roguelike(like)s.

A good game made truly great. Personally I have no problem with ASCI (Dwarf Fortress and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead for the win!!!) but the inclusion of a tileset (read not ASCI graphics) helps to elevate the game.

""A top, polished Roguelike"" - TL;DR

(First off, my ""offline mode"" time doesn't seem to show up...) I have been playing the ADOM 3 beta and now the final v3.0.6... Man, what a total overhaul and awesome set of improvements! The UI now scales to whatever size screen you have, and it works great on my WQHD Alienware 13R3 to my rMBP to my little tiny GPD Pocket. Next, the simplification of the key commands is huge - it makes the game much easier to play. The sound and graphics/animation are improved, the questing has nice pop up text, and in general everything is much more polished. There are more game modes, etc. This is easily one of the most polished Roguelikes on Steam now - and there is a lot of competition. (Frankly quite a few are also worth playing, a testament to the dedication of their creators and the benefit of us the gamers.)

Previous Review, October 2016:

As of the latest beta, R71 in October 2016, I re-purchased this game and have played it a few hours. While I have only played it on an 11"" MacBook Air so far, I can say that all my complaints about the previous version have been addressed. The game looks good and operates properly as soon as you run it. It has a steap learning curve, but that's not entirely unexpected in this sort of game. The tile graphics are reasonably nice.

Original Review, December 2015:

This was the first ever Steam game I returned; it's that bad, at least on my Mac. First, basic computer program sequences didn't work. For example, I couldn't figure out how to quit out of the game and the standard Command-Q and menu items did nothing. I eventually pulled up the ""Force Quit"" menu and killed the program that way (equivalent to kill -9 for Unix users). Second, the fonts and window don't scale properly, and there are about 37,000 settings for these things, none of which produce a nice, usable look and feel on fonts unless you leave the window a tiny thing on the screen. On a 2560x1440 or 1920x1080 screen it is just insanely silly. Third, the tutorial is more annoying than helpful. It randomly pops up a super-small text box that is ridiculously difficult to scroll through telling you things that are generally irrelevant at the time. Sure, it's a roguelike and so there are tons of commands, but at least list them for me in some sort of importance order on the side of the screen or something.

All in all, I've been playing Roguelikes since, literally, Rogue in the 80s and this was one of the worst experiences ever. I returned the program to Steam and downloaded the free one. I've spent a few hours with the free one and found no way around any of these problems above. If you want a truly great Roguelike to buy here on Steam, look at ToME instead. It's cheaper, easier to learn, much more beautiful, and ""just works.""",1450619262,1515206597,True,0,0,0.481664806604385376,6,True,False,False,False,,1515444164.0,"Thanks once more for updating the review.

I haven't played this game before it came out on steam, so I'm not really blinded by nostalgia goggles. But this game is good, only it's the toughest learning curve I've ever experienced, even harder than X-Com Long war mod. To those expecting to play something where it's possible to win as long as you play right, turn away. However for those willing to preservere through tens and eventually hundreds of character deaths this game is rewarding. It's sort of like crossing a minefield, where the signs are all in a different language, so you don't know where the mines are or what to do. And take my advice, the tutorial isn't that good, it's better to wiki everything, unless you are really really masochistic and wanna learn everything through dying.

But once you learn the tricks of the game, it's enormously fun. For example, I kept starving to death, because I didn't realize you could eat corpses and nobody minds. No karma lashbacks, and no getting sick, unless you eat something poisonous. Then I finally got past the third dungeon. That's right, I've died multiple times and still hadn't gotten past that third beginner dungeon. Then I made the mistake of wandering into a random dungeon and getting killed by a room full of giants. 

Anyways the perks of this game are:
 1 it's very difficult, sort of like demon souls. 
2. It's a delight for people who like to imagine what the fights look like instead of seeing it. Like when I accidentally wandered into a water trap with a fluff ball in my backpack and gremlins started appearing out of nowhere. I was like ""Oh, ****"" and they constantly multiplied around my Monk character. Hundreds of dead gremlins later, the floor was flooded with blood and my monk had came through unscathed. 
3. There are many, many, many different ways to play the game. You could be the unarmed monk,(my favorite), the untouchable wizard(too frail in melee for my tastes), or the cunning assassin(kept dying, cuz he doesn't start with heal) and much much more. Apparently there's a race that starts with the spit acid ability or something.

Здесь и отпугивающее новичков многокнопочное управление, которое никто не будет вам разжевывать (хотя в новых версиях вроде пытаются сгладить порог вхождения), и сотни непонятных, весьма ситуативных, навыков и талантов, и, конечно, смерть буквально за любым углом. Думаете в других рогаликах легко умереть? Это вы ADOM не видели. 
Всё это компенсируется тоннами веселья, огромным количеством возможностей и уникальным геймплеем для каждого класса, расы и даже добрых/злых героев. А еще обширным миром, эпической историей и медленным превращением в демона (всегда интересно, что на этот раз у вас вырастет).
Где еще увидишь классическую игру, которая обновляется до сих пор? И это не сиквел и не ремастер от чужих людей. Это та самая ADOM. Здесь всё прекрасно. И отлажено декадами любовной разработки.

Rogulikes; I've played pretty much all of them.

It was one of the best ASCII roguelikes then and now, with all the new stuff it has become just THE game I am playing all the time...

But let me explain WHY do I not need any other games.

ADOM at Steam gives me the true feeling of constant growth, immersion, improvement, a shifting challenge system that changes constantly and is always just a bit less difficult than the impossible...

The graphics and sound are there - no less, no more. However, for an old ASCII fan like me, they create a nice atmosphere in a quite smart way as they are no less and no more than a formal aesthetic addition to the already complex, deep and well implemented game system.

What I do not like - actually what I HAAAAATE is the fact that I had to set the autosave backup file to 50 game turns, as - but for save scumming - I would have lost EVERY save file I had tried to recover... unfortunately, the game would often crash while trying to save the game. Some forum members say it is just a paranoidal behavior, but should I choose between frustration and safety, I definitely aim for the second one.

What I do like - nothing less and nothing more than all the features of the good old ""Ancient Domains Of Mystery"" from the late '90s, that is many locations, tons of stuff to find/get/steal/buy, many skills divided info combat marks, spell specialization levels, morrowind-like main skills, naturally changing mental, physical and miscellaneous attributes... Simply every game is completely different, full of surprises.

What everyone should like: every time you achieve something the game rewards it to you. Maybe it won't tell you that directly, but after a few (hundred/thousand...) deaths the world shouls start resembling a living organism that is constantly growing and modifying its contents...

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:

STEEP learning curve. Sky high difficulty. Permadeath. TON of replayability. Short on Graphics, Audio.
3/5 but a MUST if you're a rogue-like fan. 


The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:

This has been a very difficult game for me to review. It is a solid game. I am totally getting the hang of it just fine and enjoy the genre. However, these controls are still stuck in 1994. The graphics and sound are too. But wait, there is a LOT more to this game. First, the character creation alone is immensely deep. It's really great. Oh sure, you can randomize your hero/anti-hero (yup, you can be evil. why not?), their class, race, stats. You can also choose them yourself. There are quite a few to choose from. Even better, you go through a nice little quiz (or you can randomize this too) to determine some things about your character. This makes for tons of different combos and ways to play the game. I absolutely LOVE this aspect of this game. It is straight RPG with it's abilities, talents, etc. right down to rating them by dice roll and modifier. The controls though. It takes a long time to master these controls. SO much going on all over the keyboard. I feel like some of this could be somewhat simplified, but maybe I am wrong. There really is an crazy amount of depth to this little rogue-like. Fully fleshed out tons and NPC's to be found. All in all, for your average gamer there is a lot to consume here. This is not light gaming at all. More like a Paradox game or Wargaming (a la Ageod games, etc.) there is a lot to master before being able to fully enjoy this game. As you unlock all of this though, it is very rewarding. 


Avg. gamer score would rate out at a 2/5. If you take your time with this one and learn it well, or are already a fan of real rogue-likes though, you'll find this to be a 4/5. Let's split the difference and call it 3/5.

I had played it before the kickstarted campaign for the graphical version and had enjoyed it then, and I enjoy it now even more. It just offers a lot of depth and complexety, I can really dive into the game. The world really feels alive. I also enjoyed TOME, the other great classical roguelike, but somehow I always preferred ADOM. TOME just feels more like game, with its MMO-like skills, while ADOM has the typical quirkiness and complexety of games like nethack, just with a persistent overworld and an actual story, which for me is more immersive.

I like the music, the tilesets and the many possible options, the mouse control. The loading times are pretty much non-existent, which isn't the case for TOME for example. But it still expects much the users to use the non-intuitive outdated old keyboard-shortcuts.

ADOM is hard and unforgiving. The new ingame tutorial doesn't change that. I would recommend reading the beginners guides on the wiki and the ingame manual. It's a game for people who have a lot of patience and are prepared to die early. I contrast to most rogue-lites and also many roguelikes, such as TOME, I always grow attached to my characters, so having them die is even more painful.

Tl;dr: ADOM is still one of the best games for roguelike fans who like depth and are prepared to die a lot and I am positvely surprised of the technical overhaul. But it's still nothing for people who simply want to explore a world and don't like reading manuals.

Haven't managed to finish one yet, but the great thing about this game is that it doesn't really matter that much. It's not about winning. It's about your character, that you'll be scared for, that you'll pray for, that you'll coddle up and train. You'll be angry at fate, god or just the rng, you'll laugh at stupid deaths, you'll get surges of adrenaline at the sight of that out-of-depth monster around the corner and be immensely relieved when you make it to the next staircase without being followed. Pride when you get out of a situation that looked completely desperate by using your wits, disbelief when you finally identify your stuff and see that you've been carrying around 2 (!!) amulets of life saving, anger at yourself when you lose that really promising character just because you didn't stop playing in time (when you noticed your eyes started itching and your vision got a bit blurry, but hey, you just couldn't leave the game at that point, no way...)
I'm really no game expert, I don't have any comparison to other roguelikes or any other computer games for that matter. But what I love about ADOM is that it's creating stories. Of course there is the ingame storyline, but it's also creating stories in your mind. Even in plain ascii mode, maybe especially there. Your heartrate goes up at the sight of a yellow & and you start hating the sight of any kind of f. You just have to admire (and love) the simplicity of that!

- A gorgon is gonna trap you in a room and instakill you with it's petrifying breath;
- You're gonna think that eating that strange monster's corpse is not gonna do you any harm, and then you're gonna regret it, possibly a lot;
- You're gonna try and use a wand of ball lighting to rid yourself of dangerous enemies surrounding you and the bolt is gonna bounce on the walls and hit you multiple times, until you lost hitpoints enough to die 3 times over.
- After you die, you're gonna think of all the things you could have done to save yourself, and if it seems like it was at all avoidable, you're gonna feel like an idiot.

Enemies falling under your blows left and right, it doesn't even matter what type of beast you just encountered, they all go down just after one or two blows from your greatsword. You happily hoard treasures while mumbling something about having no real challenge. Then as you raid another of the countless rooms you suddenly see a ghost. Easy you think, you fought many of these and they are more annoying than anything. But then pops up another and another and another... a whole horde of ghosts. You fight but it's no use, each time you slay one, several others drain you with their touch. You turn to run but you cannot navigate the the tight corridors as well as these incorporeal beings. It is only a few seconds from there that you drop dead... drained till you collapse of old age.
That's one way an ADOM game goes.

In another you are a powerful mage, having no trouble burning, freezing or electrifying whatever you encounter. That is until you meet an enemy that commands even greater magical powers and easily no-sells whatever your arsenal of spells throws at it. What now? Drink a potion? Use a scroll? Run? Too late in any case. As the only tunnel leading away from the enemy already has an angry giant blocking it. Struggle or go out swinging?
And that's another way an ADOM game may go.

But perhaps you won't even be this lucky, you might be a looser who eats the first kobold, realizes his error once vomiting the contents of their stomach and then be unfortunate enough to meet a ghul, becoming paralyzed by its touch and choking on your own vomit.

Or you'll explode attempting to perform alchemy. Or you'll get bit by something poisonous and realize that without antidotes you're just on a timer to your death. Or you'll read a cursed book at a VERY bad time. Or you'll decide to stand on an obsidian altar while a particularly religious orc is in the same room. Or if you're really lucky you'll live long enough to die attempting to challenge a physical god.

In short ADOM is great for creating an emergent mini story of your own character's struggle (and likely death), offering a ton of freedom and depth, but also demanding patience, dedication and application of one's own brain to learn the game. Those who can handle it can expect a deep and rewarding experience as it is a much bigger achievement to beat superpowered bad guy when you're just a frail mortal who can be blown away at every wrong step.

Now if the game had more polish in terms of graphics and animation and a much friendlier UI I'd have no trouble to recommend it to pretty much everyone, if only for the hillarious ways one can meet their demise. This way, expect to invest a hour or two just to get the hang of the basics and then the rest of your life mastering the rest.",1448890425,1448890425,True,4,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ADOM est une perle. Un petit bijou vidéoludique, qui ressemble pas mal à mon jeux préféré (Tales of maj'eyal, TOME,  pour ne pas le nommer). C'est un magnifique Rogue-like.

Un petit avertissement tout de même: ADOM c'est comme une voiture. Il faut apprendre à l'utiliser. Et au début c'est difficile, on pense qu'on y arrivera jamais. Puis après, comme pour le voiture, on fait 50km en pensant à ce qu'on va faire à manger, et la voiture se pilote automatiquement.
ADOM c'est pareil. Les commandes sont assez barbares. En plus il y'en a des dizaines (marcher, parler, prier, tremper des objets dans l'eau, envoyer des sors, utiliser des torches, manger, etc... etc... etc...).
Il ne faut pas se laisser intimider par ces commandes barbares. Elles deviendront à 99% automatique.

Attention encore à une chose, ADOM ne vous prend pas par la main. Je ne vous cache pas qu'au début vous ne saurez pas trop ou aller, dans quel ordre aborder les dongeons. Alors là il y'a 2 écoles:
1 l'expérimentation. A force d'essais et d'erreurs, vous aurez une bonne idée du parcours à faire (ou à éviter).
2 Le wiki d'ADOM. Il est super bien fait. Et il permet aux impatients (comme moi) de gagner un peu de temps au début.

Dernière chose, le jeu est en anglais. A ma connaissance pas de patch FR. Mais il y'a vraiment peu de texte à lire (surtout description des sors et des talents). Un niveau d'anglais très basique est largement suffisant pour profiter à 100% d'ADOM.

Bon voilà, c'était les côté ""négatifs"" du titre. Maintenant pour le reste.... Ben c'est que du positif.
Déja la durée de vie... A 30h de jeux, j'en suis au début du jeux (je commence à survivre régulièrement jusqu'à la ville des nains). Et je prends un immense plaisir à découvrir les subtilité du jeux.
Les différentes classes sont intéressantes, et il y'en à vraiment bcp.

En plus n'étant pas du tout un habitué des jeux de rôle à l'ancienne, je découvre aussi le système d'alignement (loyal, neutre, chaotique), ainsi que le système d'objets bennis/maudits/non-maudits.
C'est très intéressant.

Franchement ADOM c'est comme TOME. On y pense toute la journée, et on se jette dessus dès qu'on rentre à la maison.
Très peu de jeux m'ont fait cet effet dans ma vie.
En parlant de TOME, il y'a une différence notable avec ADOM. La gestion de l'inventaire. Dans ADOM, l'inventaire n'est pas illimité. Et il dépend de la force du personnage. Il y'a aussi la gestion (basique) de la faim.
Même si cette gestion de la faim est problématique dans les premières heures du jeux, une fois les bases assimilées, ce n'est plus un problème.

Le nombre d'ennemis est très varié pour le moment (je suis au ""début"" du jeux). Et j'en ai rencontré des dizaines de différents. Humanoïdes, bêtes, insectes, dragons, démons et autres machins fantastiques font parties du zoo ADOM,
Le nombre d'objets est aussi impressionants. Batons, haches, épées, dagues, massues, arcs, fouets, etc... etc... etc... 
A ce sujet un petit regret. Notre équipement n'est pas toujours représenté sur notre perso. Certains objet le sont, d'autres non... 


Bon, j'ai assez perdu de temps. Je repars dans affronter les dongeons obscurs d'ADOM ! (en mode de création de charactère aléatoire, car ça me permet de découvrir pas mal de classes/combinaisons sympa).

There is a small list of reasons, but it comes down to the fact that the game just isn't much fun.  Perhaps that's a symptom of being 'roguelike', perhaps not.  

Pros
- easy to get started, play a while and then stop.  ei no load times, no startup ads to watch, no fancy graphic splash screen

Cons
-  Vast majority of games end in you dying.  Since this is permadeath all the time invested is lost.  Period.
- Most of the things that kill young characters (hunger, traps you can't detect on doors you must go through), poisons you can't cure, monsters that one-hit-kill and who are also faster than you are) you have no possibility of avoiding.  The game doesn't attempt to balance things, it mostly just rolls RNG's and eventually you die.
 - Your character rarely knows anything about the equipment/potion/buffs.  You could die with a potion of healing in your possession and have no possibility of finding out.
 - Even if you choose a class that allows you to see cursed/uncursed status, the game has undetectable cursed items to saddle your character with usless sh*t.
 - Game does a very poor job at allowing balanced characters.
 - Too many things completely invulnerable to player attacks/spells, and very little chance to determine what could be effective against them before you die.
 - If you need something (food particularly, healing, a decent weapon, an identify scroll) you will never find it.  If you don't need it, the stuff drops like rain.  And of course this lack is going to kill you.

Pretty much the game is more of a fancy RNG, rather that someting that is fun.   Some will find this fun, most people will find it frustrating and unrewarding.  And the fact that it kills you repeatedly without any possibilty of not dying makes it more fruitless.",1448669356,1448669356,False,16,15,0.37842145562171936,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Это, наверное, самый ебанутый и беспощадный рогалик из всех, что я видел. 

Игра напоминает минное поле, по которому игрока пускают гулять без миноискателя. Умереть тут можно практически от чего угодно - враги не являются непосредственно главной проблемой. Вполне можно быть убитым... дверью, которую вы пытаетесь выбить, потому что у вас нету нужного (именно нужного) ключа или заклинания, взламывающего замки. И если в некоторых случаях опасностей можно избежать благодаря осторожности и внимательности, то иногда все совершенно выходит из-под контроля. Вы можете наступить в ловушку с ядом, который будет травить персонажа до тех пор, пока тот не испустит последний вздох. Один из моих персонажей страдал от отравления больше 500+ ходов, пытаясь перебить эффект яда навыком ""первая помощь"", использовав при этом 2 раза помощь своего бога для восстановления здоровья. Но все было тщетно. Хорошо, если есть средство, которым можно снять отравление, но порой такие проблемы возникают в самом начале, когда под рукой обычно ничего нету.

Еще один неприятный момент - это местные тайлы. Это, пожалуй, ЕДИНСТВЕННЫЙ роуглайк, в котором у меня появилось желание переключиться в ASCII-режим. Местный визуальный стиль очень яркий, ""пряничный"" и, на мой взгляд, не соответствует игровой атмосфере. Но это, конечно, дело вкуса - проблема здесь в другом. Сами тайлы очень неточные. Довольно часто описание монстра или чего-то еще не соответствует его изображению. Наткнувшись на бородатого гиганта-качка, не удивляйтесь, если в тексте будет сказано, что это женщина. Тоже самое с описанием игрового персонажа - у него могут быть голубые глаза и рыжие волосы на бумаге, а на деле и то, и другое коричневого цвета. Я не думаю, что человеку, отвечающему за создание тайлсета, было бы сложно сделать несколько тайлов под каждую комбинацию волос/глаз, так что причина их отсутствия вводит меня в небольшой ступор.

Еще хуже дела обстоят с местными зонами. По описанию они очень разнообразные, конечно. Тут у нас и пещеры, и различные подземелья, крипты, даже подземный лес есть. Но на самом деле, все, что находится под землей - это серые кирпичные коридоры. Неужели так сложно ХОТЯ БЫ просто использовать другие цвета в разных данженах? Это уже было бы лучше чем то, что мы имеем на данный момент. Сильно был удивлен, увидев другой ""лейаут"" в пирамиде, выполненной в египетском стиле.

С управлением тут тоже не все гладко. Куча неудобных хоткеев, которые вам придется запоминать и использовать всю дорогу. И ладно, если это одна буква, так нет - бывает и такое, что надо нажать что-то вроде ""w?"" (это, кстати, команда для авто-исследования местности - максимальное ""удобство"", ага). Некоторые команды можно было запросто сгруппировать на одну кнопку. Например, закрытие/открытие дверей. Но нет. Складывается такое впечатление, что в подобном садистском подходе к управлению был замысел создателя. АДОМ, на минутку, делается еще с 94 года. Очень грустно, что за это время ничего не было предпринято в данном направлении.

В общем и целом, игра явно не рассчитана на новичков жанра. Если вы как раз такой, но хотите приобщиться - начинайте лучше с чего попроще: Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup или Tales of Maj'Eyal. Последний даже есть в стиме, и он очень нуб-френдли. Для тех, кто все-таки решил взяться за АДОМ, знайте - вас ждет боль и порой невыносимая фрустрация, но вместе с этим лихие приключения, веселые проигрыши (да, такое тоже бывает) и НЕВЕРОЯТНАЯ глубина геймплея. 

А я надеюсь, что став получать хоть какие-то копейки за свой труд, Бискуп всерьез займется банальным удобством и, конечно, запряжет человека, отвечающего за визуальную часть, чтобы тот хоть что-то уже сделал с местным убогим тайлсетом.

ADOM is a demanding and difficult game with permadeath coming at you around every corner. Several secret handshakes that you just got to learn about the hard way.

However,

The sense of reward in this game is unparalleled. When you kill that Ancient Chaos Wyrm with one tremendous blow from your Vanquisher, getting revenge for those five other promising characters who died to him. Or when you finally get that one race/class/sign combo running properly that you've been trying for ages. 

There is a lot of death in this game no doubt, but the huge variety you can have with character creation added to the general randomness of the game makes every adventure significantly different. The replay value of this game is immense. Dying means that you get to try something new once again!

As you start out, you might be spending as much time reading a wiki as you are playing. That's okay, there are no real spoilers in this game. Knowing everything beforehand does not really affect your experience in any negative way. And there is a fun sense of mystique; even after years of play you'll be learning new things.

The steam edition packs this classic of a game in a neat and functional package. Definitely worth the price when it comes to amount of gameplay. Also worth it for the veterans.

For some reason it isn't on here, so I'm trying again.

This game is to roguelikes what Baldur's Gate is to CRPGs. After playing for over ten years, I can safely say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. The reason for this is it's strict dedication to its core mechanic -- you, dying.

One of the best descriptions I've ever heard of game mechanics was concerning Dark Souls, in that (paraphrased) ""this is a game that is fair to the player -- always FAIR -- and the difficulty does not surprise you if you pay attention.""

ADOM is like this. Sort of. Instead of there being ways to see what's ahead and then killing you a la Dark Souls, ADOM's core mechanic isn't actually dying. That's the means to teaching you. You will suffer legitimate losses of equipment, stats, companions, or everything you have in a gripping, slow or numbing, painless death. Then, you are expected - required - to learn from that experience in your next character.

This shows in everything that the game does. RPG classes in 99% of RPGs are meaningless. In ADOM, some are similar to eachother, but every class has at least one unique quality to them that will change the entirety of the game. Races are the same, with each having a sort of opposite, such as the Mist Elves and Trolls; M.Elves have unstoppable magical capabilities and dodging, but Trolls have towering health WITH regeneration (the MOST coveted skill in the game) and can massacre just about anything (can I just say Troll weaponsmith w/sword of sharpness? Yes, I CAN say that!) (... right before I died).

I've been playing off and on, but the adventures have been memorable. I was introduced to the game by scumming and knew too little to understand that this was NOT as the game was designed. Once I found the ADOM Guidebook online, I started playing rogue (with a little experimentation). My first winning playthrough was a Human Fighter, Phaeton; he ran into a vault of Greater Molochs. It took me HOURS to kill just one, but once I did, my level rocketed and I was able to kill each one easier until my 100 Courage could take on 2-3 at a time, hitting lvl50 in no time. The Balors at the end nearly killed me, but I desperately used a scroll of familiar summoning and hit the jackpot -- a Greater Flame Elemental killed literally everything but me on the entire floor. I just followed it around and picked through the carnage. My second playthrough was a Wizard, Gafgarion, that died in the duel with Nuurag-Vaarn. When 1.2.0 was released, I dove in head first with a LOT of attempts, but finally got a High Elven Paladin, Matthias, and for the first time I got Justifier. For those who don't know, this may be one of the best non-minmax occurrences in the game. I edited my sprite to epic proportions, turning Justifier into the Master Sword from Zelda, and mopped through every dungeon. You think such imbalance isn't fun after while... until your save loads a JSON error and corrupts, thereby losing everything.

Now that I'm done rambling, here's what makes this Steam version special. You can remove all of what I just talked about. However, that's not such a bad thing. What the Steam release signifies is a willingness to accept new players. The depth and complexity of content in ADOM is such that I probably haven't seen half of it. And it's probably only going to get bigger. Therefore, it makes sense to have ways to let players explore it. There's still tons wrong with it, as one review brought up the online-only functionality. This doesn't really bother me. Unless he's travelling in the bush (doubtful), turn on hotspot on your phone for 5 mins. The act of getting ADOM on Steam in a saleable format was probably a Herculean task, and so I expect errors. Any aspersions against customer sales disrespect are fallacious and made by people who have clearly never perused the forums or seen comments made by Thomas Biskup. Since Morrowind modding, I have never seen such a dedicated community of collaborative effort.

It has never been a better age to get into roguelikes, and this game is one of the best.

The tileset is fantastic, however it can be a bit difficult to spot items on the ground, this is offset by the minimap.

I'm really happy with the changes implemented that were promised; the exploration mode and option to turn of corruption effects were highly anticipated in my younger years however as my skill has grown I have yet to even use them.

The new classes are absolutely fantastic, well thought out and are much more fun to replay than say... a farmer or a merchant.

The steps cease, you hold your breath in sheer terror, silently attempting to gather yourself in meditation and regain power.  An explosion of splinters erupts from the other side of your corridor, and the many eyed horror that approaches from the gloom freezes you in your place.

I have to say, I really enjoy the tileset.  To me it's nicer than Tome's tileset.  Tome's tileset is almost too detailed to sit well with a roguelike, it kind of gets into the ""uncanny valley"" territory.  ADOM's tileset is HD, yet stylistically better.  The details are smooth and well done, but it avoids the mistake of trying to put too much detail into a tile.

If you like games like Caves of Qud, Tome, or roguelikes in general, this is a great game and you will enjoy it.  The devs seem very eager to improve the game and listen to their community.

The only complaint I have is there are a lot of strange key combinations that maybe would be better off in a menu (like if you push esc).  It's not bad by any means, but the UI could use a bit of streamlining.  Key combinations (like CTRL+nm) are just really archaic and not really acceptable in this day and age.

Whether to risk delving one level deeper, or travel to a safer location. Making the wrong call will often lead to an early death, but negotiate these issues and your character will be set up for the challenges that follow.

For newcomers to the game, I advise choosing a stong melee character (e.g. an orc fighter), and start in the tutorial dungeon to get used to the basics of moving around and hitting things with swords. This is what you'll be doing for the majority of the time, regardless of class. You can then let the complexities of the other mechanics seep in over time.

Been playing it like for a few last years on a regular intervals of a 3-4 months, though version 1.1.1b4. Now gotta readapt to this new version, especially vile ghosts, that in truth aren't exactly my kind of fun feature, more like annoying and little bit too strong for most characters, though it may be that I just like playing rather weak combinations so idk just right now. 
There are some things that shouldnt make it to steam release, like black screen on settings (just a screen that you have to push any key and it goes where it should be, but still...), or crash(v62 gave no change) when no focus on ADOM window(thats definitely to fix fast) or the way stats are displayed isn't not saving(I like it the classic way).

Can't really be better, though still 1.1.1 with its 'features' feels nicer, but that also can be my personal taste or it can also be, that I'm still not 100% convinced on this better(newer) version; gonna play till a few wins at least.

For those who come here for a casual game: be warned;
You got to have some time and patience to get this game right even with improved guidebook.
You gonna die and die hard, die every minute, die inside, die of anger and frustration.
Till you win, and then you can only improve.

If you like games pretty hardcore, or you think that u got what is take to win this game, that play it, but remember: dying of broken leg that's bleeding isn't all the reason to make a negative review.

I just cannot leave a negative one, especially, as I've been playing it for like 5 years or more though its older version.
It's still the same game, just with a few more features.

I've known friends to lose entire summers to this game back in 1998/1999 and so many more hours poring over notebook pages of stats and abilities and trying to come up with THE BEST character combination.

Pros:
+GUI. No more ASCII. If you come from the old-school, you remember how much time was taken up by trying to remember every monster in the ASCII alphabet. Be all the ""purist"" you want but not everyone likes remembering each monster type and name by a symbol and color.
+Characters and monster sprites change according to what's equipped. Sure! Leave that suit of Chainmail on the floor for that Goblin to pick up...see what happens...
+A significantly more detailed FAQ and instruction booklet and questionnaire. Praise be to Kormak! 
+Tutorial added. Never played a roguelike in your life? TOO BAD! We'll explain it to you!

Cons:
--Oh the crashes. The crashes. The CRASHES. Somewhere in this game's code is a terrible memory leak that causes the game to go from running to utterly unstable at random and there is something punch-a-baby-rabbit-to-death infuriating at losing 2-3 hours work without a Save and Resume OR saving, game crashes mid-save and coming back to find your savefile and your backup file gone.

You need to be patient and learn/ list lots of commands on the keyboard.


I first played ADOM around 2003-2004. We had a crappy computer which couldn't handle many games at all, but my brother had ADOM on it. I tested it and was instantly hooked: So much to explore, so hard! Only one life? The merciless roguelike system where the game is permanently over when you die made me curious.

The added graphics are quite nice addition to the game and I imagine it's easier for new players to get into the game. I use only the keyboard controls for the game, as it is much faster (and I've played it for years so it comes natural). I recommend tackling the keyboard commands if you want faster gameplay.

There are so many ways you can be good (or bad) at this game. The game has been around for decades so it is well-balanced, but also still very challenging. I haven't still finished this game without ""cheating"", that is what was known as save scumming, where you copy the save file in case you die and continue game from there. I died just once to a stupid mistake which I don't remember anymore, but it still annoys me, even after multiple years. I'm fully determined to finish ADOM in the near future...
In a nutshell, the reasons I enjoy playing ADOM:
- Challenging enough
- Addictive - you'll probably end up screaming like a maniac for dying, swear you had enough ADOM for a week, only to find yourself trying a new character 10 minutes later
- Variable - Dozens, if not hundreds of ways to play the game (race, class combinations + different endings, quests to pursue, places to visit)
- Unpredictable - You might get mighty lucky early in the game, or really unlucky (dying to a random stone block trap early on for example), or both at the same, or neither. Just like life!
- Bang for your buck - If you end up liking this game, you will probably enjoy it for years - I estimate that I have played more than 1000 hours pre-steam

The game is rogue-like RPG with permanent death of your character. But it's very deep for that kind of game and very free in the possibilities. It can be called something like ""one-man-skyrim"", because you can actually play as you want - Race and Class is only the basic of your character, than came gods, potions, corpse-eating, powers of Chaos and many more things, so you can find your orc barbarian trying to learn the Wish spell from the book.

Its one of those ""two-and-a-half to three stars' moments. 

Now I have to explain that I'm one of those people who were playing ADOM since early-days. I spent countless hours and spent dozens on dozens of characters to their eventual deaths. And that is something you have to get used to in this game. Your characters die. When they die, they're gone for good. Shiny gear. Nifty abilities. Everything. Gone. The only thing you'll have to remember them by is their entry on your personal high score board reminding you that your best character died on level 5 of some hole in the field because he/she died of the black plague because you ate a kobold corpse on the ground. 

I'm resisting the urge to ramble on and on here. ADOM really is a good game! Its wonderfully complex yet simple in its premise. There is no real story involved. 'Go and fight Chaos'. They drop you on the world and wish you good luck. The overworld is always the same. And the dungeons you dive into are always random. But this time, instead of the ASCII characters representing yourself, enemies, and items on the ground, you have a nifty little graphical representation. And in the 'old' game, you had to memorize a LOT of hotkeys, as combinations of letters with alt/shift/ctrl were what you had to press to perform actions and bring up menus. 

But that's the rub. The GUI (that's Graphical User Inferface), in my opinion, is about 75% of what you're buying here. Yes, there are a few different modes you can play in. Yes, you can now play by using the mouse and right-clicking to bring up a menu of things you can do instead of remembering its keystroke to make it more forgiving for newbies learning how to get around - though the game itself can still be brutal. But when you get down to brass tacks, you're buying cosmetics. 

That's why I wavered on the tumbs up and tumbs down. I love ADOM. It's a relic from junior high through college for me. But are you willing to drop more than $10 for what adds up to little more than polish? I did, for the nostaliga.

Wait...a game that's fully developed and GOOD?  What kind of dungeon is this?  IT'S ADOM!

Welcome to the only world you'll ever want to live in for the foreseeable future!  Filled with an amazing and detailed story, ADOM is the true definition of Rogue-like.  But unlike many other Roguelikes that you'll find on steam, Ancient Domains of Mystery really does make you worry about losing your character, while simultaneously making you want to start again the second you die.  From exploring caves to finishing quests for unique items, ADOM has something for everyone.  And now with its new (and totally optional) UI, it even has graphics for those who can't stand nethack.

I have been playing ADOM pre 1.0 release and I am SO happy to see this game brought to life.  The Creator Thomas Biskup has been working on this game for so long and each new release has had me crawling around in Ancardia looking at the new changes and updates.   Now that it's on Steam, I am happy to spend my money to support the ADOM crew and continue to keep this jewel alive.

I highly urge users to try to the ASCII version prior to playing with the graphical version.  I say this because it will absolutely help you understand the mechanics and probabilities of this game.  I don't personally care for the graphical version, but being a fan of skyrim and fallout, I can also understand the longing for something more than ASCII characters moving around.

I also highly recommend checking out the wikia.  The world of Ancardia is so full and detailed, that it will help you immensely to look up your class and race to see what fun specialties they afford you!  Many have fun skills you can only have as certain races.  Be prepared to immerse yourself and realize how much fun the game can be!

EDIT (11/18/15):

The game currently has stability issues with the steam version.  Because I like this game so much and I want people to be able to see how good this game is without the unfortunate launch day issues that plague many games (squinty glare at CoD), I want to inform everyone that they may try ADOM for FREE.  The only catch is that the releases are not the latest ones.  However, they are stable and STEAM free.  You can find them on the link below.

Don't be fooled by my game time, I have played Adom for years, almost since it was first introduced, it's possibly my all time most played game exclude world of warcraft.

While still being extremely deep and complicated game, the current build is lot more fluent and easier to use, specially with mouse being possible for menus negating the need to know all keybinds, as well as the visual representations of the charecters ( although symbols did have their charm back in the day). Making it lot more accessable to new players that it used to be, but I still recommend you to go trough tutorial and using the ? key for help frequently.


So what you can do in adom?

Wanna be god ? possible
Wanna be evil? check
Wanna be good ? check
Wanna be troll that eats little children and dogs? check
Wanna build bridges ? check
Can't swim but want to cross rivers ? freeze it with spell.
Can't open door ? kick it down, blow it up so on..
Wanna worship gods and sacrefice to them ? check
Want to kick their altars and piss them off instead ? check
Want to be sacreficed by some dark priest by god ? check
Wanna mountain climb, deep dive ? check
Want to shrink or enlarge? check...

And list goes on.

This game has RIDICULOUS amounts of secrets and contents, it will take half lifetime to find or explore them all and that's with using game guides.

Extremely recommended, definately worth the price.

The graphics for this game has come a long way, and even though, compared to other games, it's own graphic detail may seem somewhat lacking, that's not the key feature here. Allow me to start likening it to other games.

In spite of the fact that it takes up about the same amount of space on your Hard Drive as Five Nights At Freddy's, it's story, lore, and gameplay are almost as deep as the land of Tamriel's. Gameplay is smooth, and the controls, while beyond numerous, are simple, and easy to understand. The downside is the difficulty. I have been playing it for years, and I have never beaten it. Namely, this is because I tend to have a Throw-Myself-At-Anything strategy, and if you are not careful, this can lead to you having a bad day really quick. Couple the fact that this game comes standard with PermaDeath, and you really want to be careful how you play. Imagine Dark Souls with the Skyrim Dead is Dead mod installed. Pretty hardcore. In addition, the game has at least six different endings. Multiple quests, endless, randomly generated dungeons, with a few of them literally infinite in size. An expansive, MASSIVE overworld that is bigger than the size of Oblivion. Random encounters in the wild with numerous creatures to face, from bandits to jackals to the Brotherhood of Chaos to hill giants. A simplistic, incredibly fun game with an incredible lore. You have multiple races, and multiple classes to pick from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Pray to the gods for assistance, but don't abuse their generosity. And with Talents, you can customize your ratling fencer to be unique from other Ratling Fencers you may create, leading to an admittedly still finite, but very, very, VERY large pool of possible combinations. This is a game 22 years in the making, and it has managed to stay true to it's roots, while at the same time become attractive to a newer audience.

But be warned, it is not a simple game where you will sit down for five minutes to flick birds at stuff. This game requires time and patience of you, but it gives back as much as you give.

For new players, a few tips: you have a deity, and you should pray when things get tough. Buy food if you didn't start with much, and especially have food for long treks through the wilderness. Anyone can put a madman out of his misery - a true hero will find a way to heal him. Giant inscects have hard shells, and you may need to swing like a berserker to cut through. Your first mindcrafter will be killed by a stone block; do not be angry when this happens. Until you understand how altars work, do not step on black ones.

And keep at it. Yes, you will die a lot. Expect your high scores to fill up with level 1-7 heroes before you really start to master this game. Winning this game is not an eventual certainty. It is a glorious achievement.

There's no real ASCII mode anymore, just a tileset emulating one.

If you haven't played ADOM before, well, it's classic roguelike. Bad things are happening in the surreal and dark fantasy land of Drakalor Chain, and it's up to you and your equipment to do something about it. Its learning curve combined with the occasionally-less-than-obvious UI will make for a painful experience, initially. It's a very difficult and unforgiving game with dozens of keyboard commands that you need to memorize, with arguably unfair deaths in the early game.

Item destruction is the hallmark of this game. For instance, taking a step might result in your stuff getting destroyed by an acid trap and kicking a door might activate a rune trap, which is even worse. Your equipped stuff and carried inventory require separate means of protection, and some hazards are impossible to counter, unless you leave your things elsewhere. (It's not all bad, since powerful artifact items cannot be destroyed.)

Early game can be tricky as a spellcaster while later challenges are deadly if you decide to melee everything, and while there are nasty surprises awaiting, there also also positive ones. It gets easier after a while, though, and it won't take too many deaths before a certain confidence sets in; after learning the ropes you're left with addictive gameplay set in a sinister fantasy world with tons of depth, now with music and optional graphics. 

In short, rewarding fantasy RPG with an interesting setting and great flavor text to boot. Not for the impatient.

This title can certainly hold its own right up  there with the best of modern games.

+Timeless game that has been shaped over 20 years, which is reflected by system complexity that goes unmatched in modern games.
+The ability to seemlessly (simply push F10) switch between classic ASCII and tiles.

+Many modes that are all well recieved. In example, Crowd mode alters the difficulty of your game by how many Steam friends you have that play [i]ADOM[/i]. This is fresh and certainly encourages community.
+++Highscores leaderboards!
+++Ghosts of your fallen Steam friends show up in your game lol.

+Great community.

HOWEVER, you should be aware of a few things before you buy:
 - Turn-based (Roguelike)
 - Steep learning curve, including Permadeath (Roguelike)
 - Tile graphics covering up an ASCII system (Roguelike)
 - Somewhat archaic control system (but the best amongst the classic Roguelikes IMO, with decent inventory control)
 - Awkward to play without a numpad - especially if you don't have an actual mouse. Not recommended for any but the biggest laptop keyboards.
 - Just in case it wasn't really obvious, this is very much a thinking gamer's game. It has ZERO twitch.

And probably the worst point:
 - Many new releases thusfar have included a fatal crash bug... although these are generally fixed in about 24 hours.

BUT...
If you're willing to persevere through this, you've got a game of almost unparalleled depth and enjoyment. SO much to learn, SO many different viable strategies, SO many different character builds, and SO much tension and excitement in a turn-based game.

Fun game though w/ tons of characters and classes to play.  Pretty basic like other games like Hammerwatch imo, w/o multiplayer which is a shame.  Typical hack in slash that is strongly keyboard based though.  Game is probably slightly overpriced, and worth probably in the 9.99 for the basic overall quality of the game (there really is no soundtrack for example).

What is cool, is you get to play a combo of tons of races and classes (that should be more previlent in more fantasy genre games like this one), but are not.  For instance I love playing a Troll Barbarian.

This game I guess is a bit old there are some indie strat guides out there to help you select your character and to explain stuff (like selling stuff requires you to go into the merchant shop and drop the item on the shop floor, lol weird), and in that regard, the game seems overall unpolished compared to the price point which it is at imo.

----

After playing more hours and seeing the dev reply to the game, let me expand my review some more.

This is the typical game that falls into ""challenging"" and tries to prey on perhaps the nostalgic feelings of those who maybe played this game in the past.

Granted I like challenging games, but realistically you will get 3-7 hours of frustrating fun.

I found it extremely difficult to get past the southern dungeon on my way past the map.  

All dungeon maps are always rectangular in nature, vary very little; granted they seem to be using a random seed of some kind, but after 3-4 times it gets stale.  There are torches on the wall, other than that, there is no decor.  Character animations are limited and are only left face and right face.  Also when I equip certain equipment like the helm it is barely visible or not visible at all.

There is no soundtrack, the ambience sound is almost non-existent.  Occasionally I hear the drop of into a puddle in a dungeon.  Again, the atmosphere of the game feels incomplete.

There are TONS of games similar to this, Gauntlet $19.99 (when not on sale, 2015 game) (http://store.steampowered.com/app/258970/ ) is a popular game my friends play that has a multiplayer aspect, which this game does not have.  Also Hammerwatch $9.99 (not on sale) which does exist, unlike what the Dev has said and exists here on Steam:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/239070/


Let me describe a small experience I had playing a Troll Barbarian, which granted is pretty cool since most games fall short of providing the race/class combo which games like this should have (orignally stated above).  I roll this toon, spec into two handed weapons, and I go into the trial dungeon, first door is locked, I can only kick it down, in the process of kicking the door down my huge club is broke, lol wtf ok.  So basically your skill that you used to get the 2hed item is worthless and now you have to punch guys.
Overall sound effects are stale, limited, and lackluster, and could be improved dramatically.
If you are going to bring back a game from 1995 update date, improve it a ton.  Check out Divinity Original Sin (http://store.steampowered.com/app/373420/), a game which was just enhanced w/ over 90+ hours of gameplay and fully AAA voiced acted.
Spell casters feel bulky and there is not hotkey menu like modern games have (again you are paying for a 1995 1st addition D&D type game).  I have to constantly hit he escape menu to break away from the immersion of the game to open a spellbook.  After some casting of the spells they are ""forgotton"" (no tutorial on this at all btw, to explain this to first time players of ADOM like myself), and I have to relearn them.  Which means you have to worry about carrying 100 stone tombs everywhere you go.  This is a problem if you play a gnome mage (which I tried out), and tried carrying around 5 tombs plus heavy rations.
Certain classes have to eat CONSTANTLY like the game should be renamed “iron ration buffet” as trolls have to eat 1-2 every dungeon level.  Since food weighs a TON certain races are bogged down w/ carrying capacity issues (which only mildly exists as a nuisance in other games).

On the flip side I like rolling a quick character and just smashing through enemies in the dungeons.  But other games have this pleasure of smashing AI units into the ground.
Also initial encounters past the first town can kill you very easily.  You see the theme here?  This game has a HUGE learning curve w/ 8bit graphics.  Time/reward/money do not align that well.

Why are the rations so heavy in this game? And not proportion to the character size, again another design flaw.

This game is geared towards probably ppl who are in the 30s.  Why pay for this game when you can get far superior games for roughly 1-2x the price.  Although if you want to step into a time machine and try to play and relive the sweet memories when you were 8 years old on your Commodore.

I feel like this game is a semi money grab at the nostalgic feels of old time gamers who played this game and who want to shell out $ for these feels.

After being frustrated for the last time, I uninstalled.

Funny, when a long time bud on Steam who saw me playing this game on messaged me:

1.) This game has entertained me for well over a decade, and I'm still not tired of it.

2.) Every time you start a new character, make a note of what your first kill is; trust me.

3.) Don't kick a door head-on if you can help it; diagonals are best.

4.) Killing cats is bad.

5.) If you find yourself with a cursed item, you might want to try stripping naked and standing in an acid trap for a few minutes.

6.) Don't touch strange trees you find underground.

7.) Never sell or drop your last Si.

8.) If at first you don't succeed, try playing a hurthling archer.

9.) There is a dedicated hotkey for wiping your face, and you'll need it.

10.) After 1000+ hours, I have never managed to reach even one of the possible endings; the furthest I've reached is character level 43 and it was glorious.",1447741315,1448101776,True,86,10,0.836171805858612061,7,False,False,False,False,,,

How to review ADOM? Well, it's one of the Great Few, an actual roguelike (not roguelikelike or light or anything) that helped define the genre. ADOM's strongest points are a mix of a persistent plot with procedurally generated elements, and a much deeper lore than its kin.

Once again the ultimate evil raises its ugly head and only a single hero can defeat it because fate says so. That hero is you. Or, will be you. Eventually you will defeat evil. But before that, you will die. A lot. And then again, and then some more. And you'll probably love every single death because you learned something, or had the chance to try out a new trick, or just had a brief moment of clarity how something COULD be done, only you didn't do it.

ADOM ""Steam"" is a pretty huge package. While the original game can be played for free, this version comes with a nice set of ""deluxe"" options and, seriously, this is a game that has been around for ages. I played it for ages. I think it's fair that at some point someone gets a bit of my money for the entertainment I had, because this is a game made for old dogs like me. A perfect throwback to my teen years, not pimped out until it's no longer the game I learned to love but with a nice, sensible lick of paint and a sleek interface. And I can still have it all in ASCII if I want.

There's just no way not to recommend this game. 
If you already know it, you want to buy it for the same reasons I did: For nostalgia, for running the dungeons again, for feeling the thrill of a fight where each move matters, for smiling at the fact that your Steam Playtime can never, ever, match the hours you already sunk into this monster.
If you never heard of ADOM, you want to try it out because it is a nicely structured, engrossing game that polishes some concepts of the genre to a silky sheen. You'll appreciate the interface, which is readable but doesn't get in your way, you'll start out small and then you'll be hooked.

All this said, it's still a roguelike. As in, one of the games that took care we HAVE roguelikes. There are many things here that are part of the genre but not to everyone's taste- a fairly rocky early game, permadeath, TONS of ways to die yeat another stupid death, and an omnipresent element of randomness that can, and will, screw you up big time at least once per run. ADOM doesn't pull any punches and you need to be aware of that, this is not a recent rogue-light, this is bedrock. If you are just curious what the craze is all about, you may want to try the free version, just to see how it sits with you. 

Because like most old roguelikes, ADOM is a game that rewards patience, planning, developing strategies and preparing for the worst- while still allowing players to improvise and come out of a tight spot with some sweet experience and a new trick in their book. 

15 Euros can buy you more recent, visually impressive, or (to be honest) more streamlined games after all, but ADOM takes time to master, and beating it once is nothing, considering the endless replayability the genre itself has to offer.

ADOM is one of the first true roguelikes among Nethack and the like but was the only one of those that made me sit on my chair, scratching my hair with the decisions the game made me do, or the sheer amount of options it presented. I was stunned that you really needed almost the whole keyboard to play the game and it sure took time to learn most of the quirks. Back then the game was presented in ASCII aka by symbols like letters and numbers. Plain 'g' for goblin and 'k' for kobold.

This new Steam version has graphics in form of a tileset tho, so you don't have to learn how to ""read"" the game first even though it doesn't remove the fact that you still have to master them buttons. I think the tileset is very decent taking consideration the scale of the game and the amount of classes/races/weapons/etc there is. 

The UI sure feels clunky though and I recommend taking your time to read through everything the first time. After generating few characters and painfully losing them you'll surely get the hang of it and the gameplay get's much smoother and faster. It's not as difficult as Dwarf Fortress but in a whole new level compared to i.e. Dungeons of Dredmor if that helps anything.

ADOM is a game in the tradition of rogue, hack, and nethack. To describe it as ""hard"" would be both true and misleading: It's actually very easy to play and very easy to make a lot of progress, but actually winning is a delicate and unlikely affair. Dying is practically inevitable and although in the ""Deluxe"" version it's possible to turn off perma-death it's certainly not in the spirit of the game to do so. I can't even begin to enumerate the number of games I've played but I've saved well over a hundred memorials to ""notable"" dead characters on this computer alone. I have only approached the approximate half-way point twice, I have never come close to winning... and still I play, because what keeps me coming back is the variety and the challenge.

This is not a game you will win in a weekend, or a month, or a year, but you will enjoy every session (right up to the moment you die). I encourage you, dear reader, to cough up the meager sum that is asked here for this gem and immerse yourself in a wonderful game in which the developer has truly Thought Of Everything. If mud splashes on your face it blinds you until you wipe it away. If it's dark or you're illiterate you can't read books or scrolls; if you're deaf you can't hear what NPCs say to you, but the wail of a banshee will also not affect you. Sometimes kicking things breaks them, sometimes it just hurts your leg. You can eat the raw corpse of a hurthling but it will taste better and sustain you longer if you cook it first.  The texture and depth is incredible and, thanks to randomly generated elements, your choice of race, class and winning strategy it's never quite the same twice.

I've been excited ever since the crowdfunding campaing, and been singing praises of this game ever since. It's brutal, hard and random, yes, but such is the nature of TRUE rogue-likes. 

Deluxe version gives you the options to lower the difficulty for more casual of players, so they can get enjoyment out of this game as well. Even giving you option to properly save your game, unlike the normal mode, where your game save is tied to your characters life, once character dies, it's gone. This is something not available in the free version. More on that later.

But the true meat of this game comes from flexibility of the combat... You have your basic Melee, Ranged and Magic attacks, but you also can use Mindcraft, companions, special race/class abilities and alchemy to name a few varied methods of dealing damage. But you can in turn take damage from ridiculous stuff among others, and get killed in many, many ways, including getting crushed by dungeon, whipping yourself to death, getting sacrificed to one of many gods, having too much stuff in your inventory and my personal favorite: Getting eaten by grue. Also, you can get killed before you even move (or take your first step) with certain race/class combinations on certain day.

There are plenty of static elements in game that stay same from game to game, but majority of the dungeons are randomly generated, keeping you on your toes every time. No two games are the same, which makes this game highly replayable.

Deluxe version of ADOM is not only worth your money, but as it gets more features, which will keep coming until the Creator of this game feels this game is complete (and moves onto the Sequel) makes this game truly worthwhile. But if you are not certain of getting the Deluxe version yet, you can always download the Free version of this game from ADOM homepage, and try it out as much you want. The base game is the same regardless, but There are bunch of nifty features that will not be in the free versions ever. But if you so desire, you can run the newest free version of this game on your Amiga or old MS-Dos computers. That's how old-school this game is.

- Point based Character creation has been Added to the game, which allows more customization.
- You can now also Choose your starting Starsign, unlike previously

I have been playing this since 1996. This game will make you rage quit and scream about how you will never play it again and an hour later, there you are playing again. The depth of this game is unrivaled by anything. You will encounter mind boggling scenarios and unimaginable deaths. For instance, I was walking through a dungeon once and I heard a water trap go off. I came around a corner and I was blown to bits by fiery death. As I sat there wondering what in the hell just happened, I came to realize that a goblin had stepped on the water trap that I had heard go off and when he got hit with the water, a potion that he was carrying reacted with the water and exploded. Or how about the time I ate a kobold corpse that made me sick and then promptly got bit by a ghoul that paralyzed me and I choked to death on my own vomit? Yes, this kind of stuff actually happens. It's the kind of stuff that makes you rage quit the game and, oddly enough, it's what keeps you playing the same game going on 20 years.

I'm putting this as a positive review because I think ADOM is a great game which is lots of fun but there are lots of warnings I have to give to people who haven't played this game or old school roguelikes before.

(I came back to this review and really wanted to tone the review down because I think the dev is a great guy and it's a really fun game but I have to be honest: there are a lot of pretty big annoyances that will make people not used to the game regret buying it, and people do need to realize that development, while always ongoing, is not as rapid as some other games, and patience is required).


The game was greenlit a long time ago and wasn't released on steam until a year and a half later. The explanation for this was polishing the game for the general steam audience rather than the more forgiving hardcore old fans of the game. Despite this, it is not really ready for a general audience despite there being easily enough time to prepare it.

[strike]1. The game can crash: I experienced a crash within my first two hours of play. The game is permadeath but does autosave every 1000 turns. The problem is that in order to recover from a crash you have to know what you are doing and rename a certain file a certain way. The game is not programmed to realize it hasn't shut down cleanly so it can't help you.[/strike]seems fixed

2. There is mouse control but it's not total, meaning you have to press keys sometimes. It's not easy to even predict when you'll have to press a key rather than being able to use the mouse.

3. The default keys are really bad from a HCI point of view (human-computer interaction): For example to rest to regain hp etc. until something disturbs you is w5 or w. That's a two key sequence for something you will be doing all the time. [strike]Even worse is the autoexplore which is w?. That's a two key sequence with the second key requiring shift! This for something you will also be doing constantly. [/strike]auto-explore is now - (minus) (casting spells as shift z, (pick spell letter), direction is bad too although is being changed to non shifted z which is slightly better)

4. It is possible to redefine the keys but unless you are an old player of adom or go looking on forums you wouldn't know how to. You have to go and get the config key file from where the game saves game data to (as in not the base game directory, e.g. for me it's C:\Users\<username>\Documents\ADOM\adom_steam) edit it in a text editor (and you have to know how to) [strike]and then put it in the right directory.[/strike]

5. There are certain features ""coming soon"". They include things like points-based character creation and being able to choose your star sign. Despite these things really not taking very long at all to program, they have been languishing on todo lists for ages. One of these at least was used by the greenlight campaign as an example of something that would be exclusive to the steam version and yet somehow didn't get programmed in the year and a half between being greenlit and steam release. (It's a couple of hours' work at the most).

As a rogue-like, ADOM is a turn-based RPG. This means that every time you take an action, all of the other characters in the game do so as well, including enemies. In a sense, it's not really turn-based as all the movement happens at once, meaning you never have to wait for the enemy's movement. Combat is a simple matter at ground level but gets more complex as the game progresses. In its most basic form, you are simply ""running"" into enemies. This causes you to attack them and they will attack back at you and so on. However, you can influence this combat in many ways. This includes switching your tactics to gain better to-hit chance and damage at the expense of defenses (can be used flexibly and in different ways depending on the situation), casting spells, drinking potions, zapping wands, reading scrolls, firing missiles, using skills and maneuvering around the dungeon to name a few. Trash mobs you can simply run into and destroy with ease, but whenever you encounter a new and unknown, potentially strong monster, you might want to slow down the pace and consider what gear you have to help you. And remember the number one rule of rogue-likes: always have an escape plan in mind!

ADOM is absolutely brutal. Rogue-lite games often mention how they are extremely difficult and will require multiple tries before you beat them. These games also tend to be relatively short, 1-2 hour experiences in various genres from fps to platformers. ADOM on the other hand is a purebred rogue-like through and through; a successful game is likely to take 15+ hours and the hundreds of failures you will suffer on the way will add even more hours on top of that. Now I happen to think this is a strength; there is immense amounts of replayability in the game due to a variety of races and classes you can play as, in addition to a huge amount of procedural generation when it comes to monsters you encounter, loot you find and dungeon layouts you will explore. And once you beat the game normally, guess what! There's several Ultra Endings to attempt as well! These endings are insanely hard to pull off, require EVEN more tries than the normal one and are virtually impossible without some outside information sources.

ADOM's strength in relation to other rogue-likes lies in its structured nature: Terinyo is always in the same place as well as the main dungeons of the game. There are quests that you will undertake in a logical order and once you learn your way around the early game, it is possible to form a strategy. This is absolutely key; where many rogue-likes hinge purely on RNG to get you going, ADOM actually has a very deep strategy layer to its gameplay. The other notable selling point in relation to other rogue-likes is the skill system; every race and class has a set of skills they start off with, and these skills can be improved as you advance in levels. This gives leveling a more meaningful feeling compared to some other rogue-likes where you simply gain more health and magic points.

Now this review could go on forever, but hopefully I've given you some insight into whether or not ADOM is something you might be into. Personally, I love this game. I have beaten it three times the normal way and once I've achieved the Avatar of Order ending. I've played this game over the course of 15 years, two development cycles and who knows how many hours. It is truly something special.

Lastly, some meta-advice:

-Do not play the game in softcore mode! Permadeath is an integral part of the rogue-like experience and you will hate ADOM if you don't have permadeath on. A character is very likely to die; you have to learn to deal with it. The entire premise of the game is that you roll hundreds of characters until finally one of them sticks and gets farther into the game than the others. If you keep struggling with a character who was never even meant to survive the experience will be miserable. Not to mention you will never have that feeling of utter disaster when your best character dies at the final level. Or on the way back after winning the game. And all of those losses will build up to the final success; when you finally, after all that heartbreak, beat the game and leave Drakalor Chain, you look back at the time you've spent and go: ""Fuck yes, I actually did it. I beat this son of a bitch of a game. Hell yes.""

-Don't be afraid to look up stuff on the wiki: ADOM is a massive game and very cryptic in some areas. However, I would suggest avoiding making a habit out of this. Explore the game freely; you're going to die so many times anyway so what's the point of completely spoiling yourself? But once you get a promising character rolling, you might want to check up on the effects of eating this specific monster's corpse, or how dangerous exactly that Gorgon is ;)

-Give the ASCII version a try! The tilesets are very nicely done and the bare-bones ASCII style might seem clunky and unintuitive at first. But you'd be surprised at the advantages it has. For example, you will easily identify new enemies: a small ""g"" is always going to be a goblin-like small humanoid, an uppercase ""D"" is always going to be a dragon or dragon-like huge lizard like drake and so on. Very clear and handy compared to the tilesets imo. Not to mention the ASCII graphics are just so damn charming!

Truth be told, of all games I have played on my PC in the last 15 years, ADOM has surely been the one I keep returning to most often. And if there's anything that hasn't changed since the first time is that, whenever I do start up a new character, I can hardly keep myself off the game until the character dies... or until I win. Today the game is officially released on Steam, and the least I can do to repay ADOM and its team for hundreds upon hundreds of hours of fun is to review it.

So, what is ADOM about? It's a fantasy-themed roguelike RPG where you create a character of your liking, choosing from a roster of several races and professions, and embark upon a journey to find out what is it that's plaguing a remote mountain chain. Most of the elements are pretty easy to grasp now that we have mouse control, graphics, and even some rudimentary animation, but should you spend some more time with the game, you'll certainly realize the complexity and level of detail that manifest themselves in almost every aspect of the game (well, except the dialogues—this isn't Planescape: Torment for sure) and this tends to hook everyone who spends more than a couple hours with it. It's not often that you play something for years and keep learning something new and relearning old things with every playthrough. Most of the in-game situations have lots of different possible solutions, which is something that large expensive AAA-titles have all but forgone these days. This game certainly rewards intelligent, thoughtful play—which in no way dimishes its ability to pump adrenaline in certain situations.

As far as roguelikes go, ADOM is definitely more on the traditional RPG side: the world isn't as sandbox-ish as something like Dwarf Fortress, there are a lot of fixed elements and reasonably fleshed-out quests; a typical ascension (the roguelike lingo for completing the ultimate quest and leaving the game) takes from a full day if you're just rushing everything to something closer to a week—even for experienced players. Virtually all the development decisions with regards to its content are also made by the same person, Thomas Biskup—the ageless director and Creator of ADOM. Obviously, there are some disadvantages to this approach, which served to be the main reason the game has at one point spent a decade in neglect, but this man's creativity and burning passion for hardcore RPGs, the fantasy, and the adventure, is what's taken it here—after more than 20 years since its inception. So when Thomas started a crowdsourcing campaign in 2012 to make massive updates to ADOM, I was among the people who contributed without a second thought. Getting ADOM here on Steam, which is almost unthinkable for a genre so niche and seemingly impenetrable, is a huge success. No-one thought this would be possible before the campaign ended. All of the funds that were raised were put to good use, and the backers recognize the main reason behind it: to give the development a strong push, not to make money out of a free product (more on this below).

If you've never played roguelikes, or have no experience with turn-based RPGs in particular, ADOM in its current form is definitely a good place to start. It's definitely a slow burner, and it might seem a little unforgiving at first, but don't discard it if your character keeps getting killed in the first 10 minutes. Try different approaches to the same problem, play to your character's strengths, take the easy ways and pay attention to many generous cues—all of this will be rewarded. At some point you might even decide to turn the graphical interface off and continue playing with good old ASCII—you'd be surprised how immersive can gameplay get if you let your imagination paint the picture. It works just like a good book. Although the monster designs are definitely sweet, and they make the game seem more like a Spiderweb Software RPGs—another dear favorites of mine.

Those of you who have already tried ADOM many years ago and are wondering what is different about it these days are in luck: virtually every aspect of the game has seen improvements—often drastic ones! Difficulty curve is a lot less spiky now, most of the infamous exploits are fixed or toned down to sane levels, and there's quite a bit of new content to dabble in if you feel like it (none is shoved down your throat, mind—TB recognizes the game is long as is)—both semi-fixed and completely random. Even if you keep playing without graphics, I encourage you to leave the in-game music on: it fits the game quite well and definitely enhances the roguelike experience.

So, to sum up, if you enjoy some or most of:
[list][*] large, detailed, fantasy-themed worlds;
[*] exploring dangerous, non-linear series of dungeons, which you can enter methodically or try diving in early for their treasure and the adrenaline rush that comes with it;
[*] RPGs with heavily customizable characters and elaborate combat mechanics;
[*] games that aren't afraid to challenge you and give choices with impactful, permanent consequences;
[*] games that are immersive, detailed, and treat you like an intellectually capable person once you let go of the tutorial;
[*] that immense feeling of reward when you have finally beat the game for the first time;
[*] achievements that are, for the most part, [i]actual and commendable achievements[/i];[/list]
...ADOM just might be your top pick. It has its problems, but they're relatively minor and ultimately dwarfed by the good stuff.

Let me conclude by saying this. Those of us who have been playing ADOM for years upon years don't do it because of nostalgia—we never did. [b]It's because ADOM excels at what it has set out to do, and is constantly getting better at it[/b]. How many games you know have seen their authors grow into successful businessmen and yet [i]still[/i] keep working hard upon improving and polishing a piece of creative effort they have started back in their college years? This game is an honest-to-god result of so much love, thought, and craft, that you'd be hard-pressed to find anything that compares. We play ADOM because we feel this. We play it because it's [b]still genuinely fun[/b]. And by the way: if you don't want the fancy and convenient stuff in the Steam version of the game, the classic, fully-hardcore version of ADOM with the same fully up-to-date quests, mechanics, and content has been, and will always remain, [i]distributed for free[/i] on the [url=http://www.adom.de/]original site[/url]. This speaks of honesty and love more than anything else I could think of. Support it while you can!

- Background -

I first played ADOM in 2003. I've since spent hundreds of hours exploring the mysterious Drakalor Chain. ADOM is one of my all-time favourite games, and certainly the only game originally released in the 90's that I don't play for nostalgia - but because it is still fresh.

ADOM is an RPG in the true sense of the word: it does not impose restrictions on you. The problem I have with most RPGs these days is how they limit the player's actions. The choice between good and evil is often in fact the choice between the good and evil dialogue option. ADOM is different in that you can actually do whatever you want, be anyone you want to be. And doing whatever you want actually means something in ADOM, since the game has a ridiculously large amount of content. Really, it does.

- Gameplay -

In ADOM, first you'll create your character. Your character will be given a starsign that will have some effect on him/her. After that you'll choose your race, profession, talents etc. from a ton of options. These choises will guide you as you start your journey, but won't limit you as (or if) you progress.

As the game begins, you enter Drakalor Chain, a troubled valley with many mysteries to explore. From then on it's all up to you. Go to the nearest village and interact with the townsfolk or find your own path. Battle fierce beasts, learn incredible spells, rob stores, fight for money, make friends, embark on quests, search for artifacts, brew deadly poisons, control minds, barter items, cook food, worship your gods, play instruments, raise the dead, clean your ears...

And of course you'll die. You'll be drowned, burnt and crushed to death. You'll die of hunger and sickness and bloodloss. You'll accidentally kill yourself conducting dangerous magical experiments. You'll die as you are sacrificed to strange and terrible gods. You'll die and return. And maybe, just maybe you'll one day defeat the powers that plague Drakalor Chain. I never did, yet, but I'll keep on trying.
