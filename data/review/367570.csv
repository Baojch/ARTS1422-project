Ach du heiligs blechle! ich bin gerade mal level 3 nach einer Stunde und hart verzweifelt. Das Spiel ist wirklich Sackenschwer und am Ende hab ich mir einfach den Rythmus eingeprägt, weil ich sonst nicht mehr weitergekommen bin. Blöd nur, dass ich kein gutes Rythmusgefühl habe haha
Konzept ist nice, auch wenn die Lernkurve hier wirklich steil ist. Die Grafik ist wirklich sehr simpel aber ästhetisch und die Musik ganz ok. Die Challenge Modi hätten evtl. noch variationsreicher sein können.
Für Casual Masochismus kommt man für einen Euro glaube ich nicht günstiger weg.
Das Spiel ist auf jedenfall genau das was es verspricht, also achtet auf die Tags und die Beschreibung!

If you let the ball hit an obstacle, you die.  To complete each level you need to ""flip"" the ball between the series of connected circles that make up the level.  That's all there is to it.  Well, this is exactly the kind of thing mobile peasants love to play on their iPhones. 

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The mobile app features extremely lazy, minimalist ""art"", of the type you normally expect to see in low effort Flash/browser games and mobile apps.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

""oO"" is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the mobile app, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

However, I have formed an opinion I want to share.

Oo's premise is very much as simple as it looks. A hypothetical world is portrayed of mathematical grid spaces, with conjoined rings floating around, along with a white dot for each. Us players are given control of the white dots in only one way: At the click of the mouse or the press of a key, the dot will switch sides of the circle it is on. This is used to progress, and as the rings progress, to dodge obstacles. There is no story; why these white dots just want to get to the other side is up to ourselves to speculate.

This mere, simple premise is used to impressive effect. Switching sides on a circle feels satisfying, even in the simple case of an obstacle-free transfer. Every obstacle setup is possible indeed to clear, if you're willing to put the time into it. Clearing each stage seems to be a matter of timing, memory, and self-control, and it can be engaging to build this up.

Thankfully, this game is merciful. You are not forced to work with a finite number of lives except in endless mode. The player can lose as many white dots as she or he wants to and keep going; the skill measure is that a count of how many dots it takes to reach the end of each stage is kept after clearing, and the circles showing each stage show the minimum number you've succeeded with.

Best of all, and most importantly in my opinion: This game saves your progress and lets you come back. Each stage has multiple check-point rings. If you exit a stage you haven't completed, then the game itself, then boot the game up later and click the same stage, you will start at the last checkpoint ring you reached.

This one feature makes what would be a far-too-cruel game into an engaging and fair experience where we can just focus on quizzing our own memory, reflexes, and timing- and have fun doing it.

--

For its simplicity I for one feel like I'm getting well more than my money's worth in gameplay experience. If you're curious and you'd rather test your timing and memory than eat and forget a candy bar, I recommend giving oO a try. If you're particularly frugal, a sale to bring the price down to 89 cents can empower this already-fair deal.",1626335041,1626335530,True,0,0,0.45649072527885437,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i]oO[/i] is a simple game where a ball must navigate obstacles by flipping between the inside and outside of connected rings. I found it tedious and did not enjoy it.

[b]My Experience:[/b]
This game is very simple - when you press a button, the ball flips to the other side of the current ring. You advance through the level by flipping into another ring. 

It reminds me of mobile games, with controls that are suited for touch, simple goals, and repetitive gameplay. That's not necessarily negative, but I found it fell into the same traps as many viral mobile games - namely, I quickly got bored. There's enjoyment here for those who like that genre, but it wore my nerves thin in just a few minutes.

I don't really recommend this because I found it tedious. However, you may still enjoy it!

Let's make it clear. Devs doesn't lie when they tell you the game is ""hardcore"". The placing of circles is sometimes so terrible you have to hit the spacebar or LMB perfectly in time to progress. The game also lacks in achievements. There are 4 levels and Endless Mode, each having additional ""Nightmare Mode"" which not only makes your head hurt, but you also don't get an achievement for completing them. Menu graphics are terribly made and looks like something from free Unity Assets.

 [h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Really easy controls
+ Endless Mode
+ That's all

 [h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Strings of small circles, where ball moves really fast
- Nightmare mode, that makes your head hurt, gives no achievements, and for some reason Hud is unreadable in it
- Hard to beat levels, because you often have to click perfectly to get to the next area
- Menu looks like it's using Free Unity Assets
- Game idea probably stolen from mobile game called Orbits (the earliest review I could find is from May 6th of 2015). 
- Game often want you to get through the area of circles without waiting, but then gives you right away areas when you have to wait for spikes to hide
- Music in Endless Mode can get so intense that you can't hear it
- Endless Mode is basically Race against Time, you can't stop on any circle, because you are chased by a red zone (it's so red it hurts your eyes)

Das Grundprinzip ist simpel. Ein Ball rollt in der Innenseite eines Kreises. Mit einem Tastendruck springt dieser entweder auf einen angrenzenden Kreis oder auf die Außenseite des ersten Kreises. Ziel ist es einen Parcour von aneinanderhängenden Kreisen zu bestehen.

Nach ein paar Kreisen kommt immer wieder ein Speicherpunkt. Der ist auch ziemlich schnell bitter nötig, denn das Game hat einen stark ansteigenden Schwierigkeitsgrad. Tödliche Stacheln, die teils sogar rhythmisch auftauchen oder selbst durch den Kreis rollen machen uns das Leben schwer. Zudem dreht auch gerne mal die Perspektive. Und so wird das Spielchen recht schnell zu einem herausfordernden Timing-Marathon, der schnelle Reaktionsfähigkeit verlangt.

Das geometrische Design ist simpel aber ästhetisch gelungen und zum Spielprinzip passend. Der treibende, immer schneller werdende Sound unterstützt die Atmosphäre.

Ein minimalistisches Gelegenheitsspiel, das weder lang noch besonders abwechslungsreich ist, das aber fordert und unterhält.

正如另一个评测里老哥所说，目前微信里有个小游戏玩法比较类似，不过平心而论，还是这款更有意思，下面会说理由。
游戏一共有十关，4个普通关卡，难度层层迭加，每关都比前一关多一种机关，还有四个由普通关卡衍生出来的鬼畜关卡，最后是无线模式以及无限模式的鬼畜版。顺带一提，关卡从一开始就可以随意选择，无需过关解锁。

技巧与I wanna系列类似，简单的地方靠反应和意识，难的地方就多死几次掌握住节奏，因为普通关卡所有东西都是固定的，有时候觉得自己在玩音乐游戏hhh，无限模式就完全靠反应了，我应该是没法拿到最后一个过100个圈的成就了。

The only controls are the spacebar and LMB, but they both do the same thing so it's just up to preference on which you want to use.
There's no real resolution support for the game. The only good way to play is on fullscreen because using ALT + ENTER makes the window the same resolution as your set native resolution.

The game's as minimal as it's stated. The premise for the entirety of the game is just to move a dot from one circle to another without the dot running into anything. You do this until you reach the last circle that clears the level. Being arcade-y, it's also a short game with only 8 levels, but 4 of those levels are just psychidelically higher difficulty versions of the other 4, so really there's only actually 4 levels, and all these can be finished quick if you're good. 
There's an ""Endless mode"" but that's really all it is, an endless version of the game that you can try to get a better score at.

Watching any video of this game, especially the ones on the store page here, will tell you exactly what the game is like.

On the other it might be consider some form of illegal torture...

More genuinely, Id be tempted to give it a neutral if the option existed because this gets pretty ludicrously tough. The first two levels are difficult, the wobbly modes certainly ramp that up, but then you get to the third and realise that they were practically tutorials.

The third level just keeps going on, and on, its much longer, much much tougher and about half way through had the 9 rings, 9 leaps in a row you have to get perfect, no space for rest, you cant even repeat a ring, as you die if you miss it the first time round. The timing for each ring is slightly different, each ring is done in less than a second, and most require additional jumps to dodge spikes. That one section not only cost me more lives than the first two levels combined, it cost me about ten fold the lives of the first two levels combined. It was beyond what was physically possible for me to react to, I ended up memorising the timings to the point where I was just tapping out a rhythm without even really responding directly to whats on screen. I ended up finishing level 3 on about 1000 lives lost... 
Ive not yet finished the fourth level.

Obviously something about this keeps me engaged to have such stupid levels of persistence, but it does tread a very fine line between seriously challenging, and essentially impossible for an average player to accomplish without blind luck.

This is a very well executed minimalistic game, the whole premise is to move between circles using their tangents while avoid obstacles.

If you are looking for a casual but difficult arcade game this should be right up your alley.

- Надо реально быть упрямым человеком, чтобы играть в это.

Only one button, but the game requires hair-trigger timing.  It comes down to finding a rhythm for each section.

There are only 4 levels (plus endless mode and drunk mode), but each is fiendishly difficult and brilliantly designed.  The levels are impossibly long, but you don't have to complete them in one shot; the game saves your progress at each checkpoint even if you exit the game.  (I wish I had known this before attempting level 3.  I did it in one sitting because I was afraid I'd lose my precious progress if I took a break!)

Apart from one little detail, nothing is unfair.  It's all about finding a rhythm of button-pressing.

This is a wonderful challenge, so why aren't more people talking about it?  Well, oO is a game about watching a circle spinning around and around inside other circles, which may also be spinning and may contain objects rotating in the opposite direction to your spinning!  It can cause hypnosis and nausea if you stare at it too long.

That little unfair detail: the tiny circles.  You spin so fast inside them it's impossible to see when to push the button to flip into the next circle, meaning it comes down to luck.  Not impossible, but frustrating, and there aren't too many of those moments to break the deal for me.

Highly recommended for those who want something to challenge their reflexes.",1485024162,1485045517,True,2,0,0.535741984844207764,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It may be only a dot, circles, and spikes but a lot of complexity was put into making this. You're just a dot going through circles, trying to get to the end and escape. However, spikes come in your way along your way as you try to not die by missing the entry to another circle. Through four levels, this changes up, causing you to not only rely on how fast you can go but how you analyze the situation. Is it now or the next rotation that allows you to safely get past spikes? 

oO can be frusturating at times, but trial and error becomes key towards the later levels. A death count is constantly up, beign a score that you can try to lower as you gain experience with the game. Want a more difficult level? Or just bored of seeing the same circles over and over? An extra ""drunk"" level comes with each level, not needed to complete the game but if the player wants to. With an addition of an endless mode, oO can last for a long time. 

I appreciate how the developer didn't make achievements for not dying in each level. Normally this would be the case, but it's great seeing a game without this asthe levels are truely hard to beat without dying.

I'm surprised at the glowing reviews this game has gotten. (And of course anyone who doesn't recommend the game gets slammed with downvotes, I'm sure I'll be no different.) Scrolling through the positive reviews, hardly any of the users seem to have played for more than a couple hours - probably because the ragequit is strong with this one; I imagine many of these people played it once and haven't touched it since - so again, it's tough to understand the positive feedback. For the novelty, sure. Everything else... hm.

Anyways - for the price, if you really want to check it out, I would say that it's worth it. There are very few games I wouldn't pay a dollar for. It's an experience, at least, and I'm not saying it's a bad game; just that I don't personally recommend going out your way for it.

oO has been developed and published by Maciej Targoni and Wojciech Wasiak. A seemingly simple game, yet it holds plenty of flexibility if not novelty from the arcade formula we’ve seen countless times already. The fact that it was created by a two-man team which has experience already with geometry-based gameplay mechanics, speaks volumes and assures that oO is more than just a shy debut onto Steam’s ever growing indie library.
 
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
While it may not necessarily impress with its looks, oO’s gameplay is most certainly its main attraction. Relatively short and few levels, that are well diversified through careful use of colors and obstacle shapes but quite difficult. Not entirely unexpected since the game has to stand out somehow. I never found it frustratingly hard but it does take some hefty time getting used to it. It uses the mouse controls to its advantage and can also provide a test for your own reaction time. For being a fast-paced game, it is surprisingly needy, when it comes to your required level of concentration. I consider it a nice break from other genres and as far as an affordable arcade game is concerned, this title hits all the right spots.
 
The minimal chromatic and shaping style suits the game just fine and the relaxing selection of sounds, prevents a potential attempt at rage quitting. It works as intended and you can’t complain about it at any given point.
 
[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Fun and challenging for the right price
+ Steam Achievements
 
[h1]Cons[/h1]
- No Trading Cards
 
 
[h1]Result / Final thoughts[/h1]
oO is one of those nice little games on Steam that was appropriately priced from the get-go. It features Achievements, but the inclusion of Trading Cards would have added even more sugar to this sweet deal. Does it really need more sugar to warrant a purchase? Most certainly not.

Незатянутые уровни, с нарастающей сложностью, объединенные одним типом геймплея. Чекпоинты, благодаря которым игра не начинает вызывать отвращения после permadeath'ов.

いたってシンプルですが、その実態は死にゲー。
タイミングを上手く合わせないとトゲにぶつかったり円の間に挟まれてぱしゅんと弾けてしまいます。
そういう意味ではちょっとリズムゲーでもあります。
サクサク死ねますがリトライもサクサク、チェックポイントがいい感じに設置されているので
全くクリアできないというわけでもないです。めっちゃDeathカウントたまりますが。

お手軽簡単かつクリアした時の達成感がしっかりある、
エンドレスモードはさらに難易度があがりますが気づくとずっとやっちゃう中毒性があります。
それでこの値段なので暇つぶしに買ってもお釣りがくるぐらい面白いゲームだと思います。",1464704928,1464704928,True,3,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Oo est un jeu de reflexe, ou plutot de rythme. Vous incarnez une petite boule blanche qui doit se rendre d'un point A à un point B en parcourant des cercles collés les uns aux autres tels des engrenages. 

Bien entendu ce serait trop simple et sans saveurs si le jeu se resumait à ça. Les fameux cercles seront donc, au fur et à mesure de voitre avancée, parsemés de pics immobiles ... ou non ! A vous de passer de l'exterieur à l'interieur des cercles, et vice versa, afin de les eviter. 
Bien sur c'est le type de jeu ou l'on meurt encore et encore, mais les niveaux n'etants pas aleatoires, vous allez petit à petit, apprendre les pieges et les parcours d'une maniere plutot machinale et rythmique (ceci vous obligeant à ne pas vous contenter d'avoir des reflexes, mais aussi de la mémoire et un sens du rythme de plus en plus rapide) 

Je peux avouer que le dernier niveau à été terminé plus par chance qu'autre chose... je ne sais pas encore comment j'ai reussis ... mais bon, j'ai eu une bonne étoile !

難易度はかなり高く、死んで覚えるタイプのゲーム。
良かった点としては、こまめにチェックポイントが用意されており、死んでも通過したチェックポイントからすぐにやり直せること。これのおかげで死んでもイライラせずにプレイすることができた。
逆に悪かった点は、ステージが少ないこと。98円のゲームなので少なくて当然だが、もう少し増やしてもらいたかった。あと、円から円に移るときの判定が少しシビアに感じた。判定はもう少し甘くても良いのではないか？
個人的には暇つぶしに最適なゲームだと思う。チェックポイントを通過すればゲームを終了しても、チェックポイントから再開出来るので空いた時間などを使って少しずつ攻略できるし、頑張ってプレイし続ければどのステージもクリア出来る。細かい不満もあるが、98円と安いので気になったら買って損はしないと思う。

[h1]其次：[/h1]建议大家玩游戏的时候热身充分！活动好上肢肌肉！把背景音乐调成最躁的死亡重金属！喝两杯浓咖啡！嚼几瓣大蒜！完全清醒并且加强肾上腺素分泌！用人类战斗的本能来决定一瞬间的胜负！
[h1]最后：[/h1]如果在游戏的期间陷入的瓶颈而久久不能平静时，就要放大招了！先灌自己两斤烧刀子！做一百个俯卧撑和深蹲跳！有条件的话找平时看不爽的人茬一架或者情侣之间临时分个手之类的！争取把自己搞的头晕目眩欲仙欲死的！这样的你的视觉就和游戏画面晃动的频率一致了！现在你有如天神附体！全成就变得so easy~
[strike][b]前面是一本正经的胡说八道。[/b][/strike]想要通关并且全成就只能苦练。死的次数多了自然水到渠成！游戏打分8/10！扣一分是因为没有设置卡片掉落。再扣一分是说明oO这款游戏还有进步的空间！",1457185620,1457186286,True,18,52,0.710966527462005615,2,False,False,False,False,,,

After beating a level you can try a twisted version of it where everything is wobbly and non-circular.

+ Минималистичная графика, в которой нет ничего лишнего.

+ Скромное музыкальное сопровождение, которое вносит в игру свою изюминку.

Минусы :
- Мне не понравилось отсутствие сюжета или хотя бы какого-то наставления от разработчиков. Хотелось какую-нибудь анимацию в конце игры или слова ""Ты сделал это, парень!"". Но, к сожалению, такого не было.

Good, short game. Try to pick it up on sale. Solid soundtrack that fits well with the game.
8/10

[b][u]Full Review:[/u][/b]

~ [i]Description[/i] ~

oO is a 2D game where you're a ball on the perimeter of a circle, and with a click you switch from either going around the inside of the circle or the outside. This is used to travel between circles and progress through the levels and to avoid spikes on your way.

~ [i]Gamemodes[/i] ~

[list]
[*] 4 levels of increasing difficulty and new obstacles every level.
[*] Endless mode, which gets harder as you go on, and every circle you progress through increases your score by one.
[*] Bonus versions of each level, where everything has a wobbly effect, causing it to look like the ball is speeding up/slowing down, but it's still moving at the same consistent speed as in the normal levels.
[/list]

~ [i]Pros![/i] ~

[list]
[*] I picked up the game for only $0.89 when it was on sale
[*] Good music that didn't get annoying throughout multiple hours of playtime.
[*] Amazing level design and cycles that are easy to understand but hard to master
[*] Very simple controls. Literally one button. (Space bar or Left Click)
[*] When you die, you go back to the most recent checkpoint, and it restarts the cycle at a specific point, which makes the game far less frustrating than it may first seem.
[/list]

~ [i]Meh's...[/i] ~

[list]
[*] I feel like the game scammed me a few times when switching from circle to circle, but that's probably just me trying to find an excuse to say it wasn't me.
[*] When you use the menu button in the upper left corner while in a level, your ball switches sides of the circle before the menu pops up. It's a minor bug but it can screw you over sometimes.
[*] No way to save your progress mid-level, but it doesn't really matter since the levels are somewhat short and can be done pretty quickly if you have practice and you know what you're doing.
[/list]

~ [i]Cons![/i] ~

[list]
[*] There are only four levels, plus the Endless mode, and no level creator/editor, making the game quite short.
[*] The game may trigger motion sickness on the later levels if you're a bit sensitive to it.
[/list]

~ [i]Achievements[/i] ~

There are 6 achievements, one for beating each of the main levels, one for hitting a score of 15 in Endless, and one for hitting a score of 100 in Endless.

It may be due to my lack of experience in the game and/or just sucking at it in general, but hitting a score of 100 in Endless seems practically impossible to me at the moment.

~ [b][i]Conclusion[/i][/b] ~

If you really want the game, you can go ahead and pick it up for the full $3, but I would honestly wait for it to go on sale at least a little before getting it. I picked it up at the end of the Steam Winter Sale for just $0.89 and I'd consider that absolutely worth it.

The game itself is pretty entertaining and also got intense for the last two levels. Easy to pick up, difficult to master.",1454314049,1454314496,True,0,0,0.479041904211044312,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But while things may look easy enough at first glance, the challenge comes in mastering the sparse mechanics you are given to get past whatever sadistic obstacles oO's glowing, circular world cares to throw in your direction.

With ever more complex patterns to overcome and a faster and faster rate of play, the simple ""push space to flip"" mechanic might only be one button but will eventually build to challenge even the fastest of reflexes. You will die again, and again, and again [spoiler]and again, and again, and again, and again, and again[/spoiler]; but unlike some other punishing titles of similar ilk, the deaths here don't tend to feel cheap. You'll always know why you died, and what you need to do to avoid death next time.

oO has four main levels, with four optional ""drunk"" levels and two endless modes which are again normal and drunk. Minimalistic, punishing games like this aren't often to everyone's liking, but I'm a huge fan of 'em and always gun for total completion before moving on. I'm currently on the final drunk level and am slowly going insane trying to complete it - but mental stability aside, oO is a fantastic little entry to the ""easy to learn, punishing to master"" genre, and I hugely recommend it.

If the original levels aren't enough, there's a variation of each, (I call it drunk mode)
Spikes, high speed movement, memorisation of patters and MORE spikes!

Это тот случай, когда вы не будете жалеть о 0,79$, потраченных на это чудо игровой индустрии.
==================
ПЛЮСЫ:
1. Предельно простой геймплей, управляемый одной кнопкой
2. Приятные звуки и музыка
3. Ненавязчивая графика, которая даст отдохнуть вашим глазам после графонистых шутеров
4. Невероятные уровни, пройти которые не так просто, как кажется. Запустив игру, вы лишь на 1 уровне помрёте около 100 раз.
5. Креативная геометрия
---------------------------
МИНУСЫ:
ОЧЕНЬ высокая сложность, доводящая до эпилепсии. На один из уровней можно потратить час чистого времени, но не факт, что вы не бросите игру на десятой минуте.
==================
ВЫВОД:
Игра классная, поможет вам развить в себе реакцию, мышление, нервный тик и голосовые связки.

zasadniczo przeskakujemy z okręgu w okrąg na ich stykach, unikawszy na późniejszych etapach zabójczych wypustek.

co jest w tej grze najlepszego ? syndrom ""jeszcze raz"". 
upartość popłaca, cierpliwość również.
oraz droga mysz, względnie klawiatura.

czemu ?

większe opory przed zniszczeniem wybranego kontrolera.

Si vous êtes en manque de super hexagon, plusieurs possibilités s'offrent à vous. Vous pouvez relancer super hexagon mais il est atrocement difficile. Ou bien vous pouvez essayer velocibox, c'est la même chose mais en 3D vue subjective. Ou alors vous pouvez vous balancer sur pivvot, difficile lui aussi mais plus relaxant. Ou sinon il y a ce jeu !

Ca se joue avec un seul bouton. Soit la barre espace, soit le clic de la souris. Un clic vous pose à l'intérieur, un autre clic à l'extérieur. Et ensuite il y a des cercles. Le but est de passer de l'un à l'autre en gérant les obstacles et changements de rythme. C'est un concentré de rage. Un truc horrible. Heureusement il y a des points de sauvegarde. Pas beaucoup mais bien placés. Et un mode infini sans point de sauvegarde pour les plus fous.

Et à la fin de chaque niveau un sentiment d'accomplissement. Comme pour tous les jeux fous fous de ce genre, faciles à apprendre mais follement difficiles à maîtriser.

oO est un jeu facile à prononcer mais pas à finir. 

Le jeu est simple, vous avancez automatiquement le long des lignes de ""cercles"" et un clic vous fait changer de côté de la ligne. 
Un concept simple, mais c'est à vous de gérer vos déplacements pour avancer et survivre et c'est là que ça se complique.
Différentes tailles, vitesses, des déformations visuelles, des pièges dynamiques... Autant vous prévenir le jeu est un chouilla dur.

Après chaque section dans un niveau, vous avez un point de respawn pour sauvegarder votre progession tout de même, et le jeu est là pour vous rappeller gentiment le nombre de mort que vous avez eu sur chaque niveau.

[table][tr][th][h1][b]Ambiances sonores et graphismes.[/b][/h1][/th][/tr][/table]

Côté graphique, le jeu en 2d est très coloré, et fluide. Les animations ont un bon rendus, et les musiques/bruitages rendent le tout fort sympathique.
C'est encore une fois simple, mais ça n'enlève rien à la qualité du jeu.

（ここまでで「じゃあ買ってみようか」あるいは「興味ねぇな」と思ったなら、以下は読まなくても結構です）


【ゲームの概要】
様々な大きさの「円」が、円周部分で互いに接した状態で、たくさん連なっている。その円の内側を、一つのドットが一定の速さで回転している。円同士の接点にドットが来た瞬間、タイミングよくマウスクリックすると、隣の円に移動することができる。これを繰り返してゴールまでたどりつけばステージクリアとなる。

なお、円の接点以外の部分でクリックすると、ドットが円の「外側」に移動する（再クリックで戻る）。これは、円に配置された様々なトラップを避けて進むための必須テクニックである。

クリックのタイミングを誤ったり、トラップに衝突すると失敗となり、直前のチェックポイントまで戻される。失敗回数に制限はない。プレイはいつでも中断出来て、前回のチェックポイントから再開可能。

ステージは、大きく2種類に分けられる。

（Ａ）円の配置や大きさ、トラップの位置や種類などが完全に定まっており、それをクリアするのが目的のノーマルステージ（難易度順に４つ）。

（Ｂ）円の移動に1回成功するごとに「次の円」がリアルタイムでランダムに追加されていくサバイバルモード。

さらに、各ステージには、まるで水面に映った風景のように、常にぐにゃぐにゃとステージ全体が歪む効果が付加されたバリエーションも用意されている（トラップや円の配置自体は、ノーマルと同じ）。当然、難易度は上がる。

一般的なそれとは全く異なる外見だが、このゲームを遊ぶ感覚は、一種の「リズムゲーム」に近いと思う。しかも、一定の拍子ではなく、常に拍子やテンポが変化し続ける「リズムゲーム」。上記の通り、ドットの移動速度自体は一定だが、円の大きさやトラップの周期（＝拍子）が異なれば、当然、移動のタイミングも変化するし、特にトラップ満載のステージでは、「拍子」のパターンを正確に読む（覚える）ことが重要となる。また、円の外側と内側という概念は、「表拍」と「裏拍」に似ている……と、そこまで言ったら、こじつけが過ぎるか。",1440497114,1440497114,True,7,0,0.612851440906524658,0,True,False,False,False,,,

我自认为自己不是抖m，恩..但这游戏的宗旨就好比o→O的过程，每次打到那种大圈圈有着各种各样的刺的时候我总能自信地说出：我能反杀！！(°∀°)ﾉ    然后就在后面看似简单的无刺小圈上打出了GG(´･_･`)  恩...吓得我差点砸了鼠标。

Oo is one of my favorite game as it takes some patience for one to get pass a level. This game never gets boring because there's always some randomness which will keep you entertaining.

I've played this game on my Android and am glad they made one for the PC as well. The concept is pretty simple, you have a ball spinning around in the ring and you need to advance by switching from one ring to another where they get connected from.

It's not just that, each level gets more and more tough as these rings have spikes, they move in a wavy shape, screen angles rotate and some rings will drop in randomly.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*]Lots and lots of hours of fun
    [*]Difficulty at max
    [*]Unique pattern of gameplay on each level
    [*]Minimal Graphics
    [*]Dude, it's just 1$ game (I seriously seriously want that the developer of this game should sell it for 3$ atleast, I won't mind paying even 5$ for such a game honestly)
[/list]

[b]Cons (Actually none but some suggestions infact)[/b]
[list]
    [*]Level editor missing, will be fun to have one
    [*]Need an endless + random endless mode, not sure if it has one as I've not completed the game on my phone
    [*]Can improve graphics
    [*]Increase the damn price xD

Why?

Hate:
It is a hard game that will punish you for any mistake that you make in which you are given all the details of how to die.

Love:
It is a simple idea and runs with it. It makes getting in and out of the game easy enough that if you only had 15 minutes to play a game, it would be fun (and difficult).

Don't like:
All the wavy levels give me motion sickness. It is hard to say that it is an extra bit of challenge when It feels more like a cop out answer.

Einerseits fesselte mich das Spiel mit seinem simplen, aber herausfordernden Konzept, andererseits trieb es mich beinahe in den Wahnsinn. Der Einstieg ins Spiel gestaltete sich noch recht unkompliziert: Man navigiert zwischen dem Inneren und Äußeren von Kreisen, wobei gegen Ende des ersten Levels erste Hindernisse auftauchen. Das eigentliche Ziel, von Kreis zu Kreis zu springen, klingt einfach – und genau das macht den Reiz aus.

Im zweiten Level erhöht sich die Komplexität durch sich bewegende und die Form verändernde Kreise, was jedoch noch im Rahmen des Machbaren liegt. Die wahre Herausforderung erwartet einen jedoch im dritten Level. Hier erreicht der Schwierigkeitsgrad eine neue Dimension, die mich regelmäßig an meine Grenzen brachte. Trotz zahlloser Versuche und einem wachsenden Frustpegel, konnte ich nicht davon lassen, es immer wieder zu versuchen.

Wäre das Spiel nur aus diesen frustrierenden Momenten gemacht, würde ich wohl ohne zu zögern einen Daumen nach unten geben. Doch dann gibt es da noch diesen Modus, in dem man plötzlich auftauchende Kreise treffen muss – ohne Vorwarnung, blitzschnelle Reaktionen erfordernd. Dieser Modus, mit seinen stets neuen Herausforderungen, brachte den Spaß zurück ins Spiel. Hier geht es nicht darum, an derselben Stelle zu scheitern, sondern sich immer neuen, unvorhersehbaren Aufgaben zu stellen.

Вам надо нажимать одну кнопку, передвигая шарик с круга на круг. Вам предстоит пройти через препятствия, до конца уровня. Самый последний уровень - бесконечный. Там нету сохранений, и вы играете на рекорд.

1. Уникальная аркада, не встречал подобных.

2. Много уровней.

3. Хорошая музыка.

4. Можно играть одной рукой.

5. Цена.
