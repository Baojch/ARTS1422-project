I mean a [b] variety [/b] of choices. It kept changing with a minimum of minimalistic descriptions in the form of three choices. To complex sentences in multiple choices.

If you are going to make these choices different, at least stay dedicated to one style. Rather than, ""Damn, that hurt!"" ""Damn you to hell, this gives me great physical pain."" Of course it is dramatised and these don't actually come up in the game.

A Choose Your Own Adventure Game that tracks your choices and calculates points and stats based on them.
The story is well written, but the game would be well-served with some music/sound effects/art to go with the writing. As it is, it does not take advantage of being a ""Game"".
I would still reccomend it, though the price tag may be a little steep for a CYOA book.
