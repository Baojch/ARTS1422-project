アルキメデスというゲームを買ったと思いきや、なぜかarcと呼ばれる

実際のウェブブラウザを駆使する場面もあり面白かった。
また、ホラー演出もゾワッとするような精神的な怖さがあった。(個人的に”アレ”が夢に出てきそう)

You're also not given enough time to explore the game, you're given orders of where to go and what to do, it feels very constricting.

It's light on the scares but it really suckers you into the world, and makes your interactions with the other person on this creepy OS via the messenger app seem very real.  As you progress through the story the game has you solving a variety of puzzles through analysis of in-game files and applications and search engines, as well as interactions on the real web from outside the game.  Everything from emailing people and getting (automated) responses, trying to track down coordinates on google maps, to looking up URLs to download rar files, cracking their password using in-game clues, and then listening to the audio files within to allow further progress in-game.
It's constantly changing things up and doesn't let you get bored, and slowly drip feeds you the story as you go which ends up being not all that bad at all.
It is in bad need of some quality of life fixes, like being able to move the windows you open up around on the OS, or quickly find your way back to previous files.

And its not like you can right click the pictures to search them on google. No, you have to memorize how the Landscapes looks and then find it by yourself....thats RIDICOULOS....

But it doesnt End there... at one point you have to find an Youtube Video to get a Command that will progress the story....guess what....the F****** Command doesnt Work!

So here I am, stuck, not able to end this Games because the Command C/ doesnt work at all!

TL;DR: You get scammed over the internet and can't get your money back. ;P

[b][i] What is it about? [/i][/b]

In this game, you play a person who's bought a game online. Doesn't seem weird yet?
I'd like to prove you wrong. You don't get a game. Instead you receive an operating system.
You'll soon receive the first message from an (yet) anonymous user, he tells you that there never was any game.
He is working for a company called arc and he's out there to get more information.
Soon you realise that there is something going terribly wrong. The whole world is in danger.
The remedy lies in your hands.

[b][i] What did I like? [/i][/b]

The game's setting. 
You never get to see anything but the emulated operating system, which is constructed in very simple ways.
This game was also pretty early in making you, the player, quit the game and solve some puzzles on your real computer (using the browser mostly). The tasks are pretty simple most of the time and you always pretty much know what you have to do, still I think it is pretty cool seeing such mechanics in a game from 2016 !

[b][i] What did I dislike? [/i][/b]

the fact that one of the meta-gaming tasks didn't work that at all times.
In this playthrough (2022) I didn't have any problems doing said task [spoiler] (You have to find the coordinates of a specific place) [/spoiler] But over the years there were a few times it didn't work out as intended, sadly. This is not the developers fault as I imagine it worked out as planned when he was in the developing stage, but after release google might've changed some things, making it very hard without a guide.

[b][i] Were there any bugs? [/i][/b]

As far as I know, no.
I played through the whole thing without having to touch any pesticides ! ;P 

[b][i] Would you recommend the game? [/i][/b]

I might be a bit late, 6 years, but still I'd say yes.
The game's gotten a pretty interesting story, nice setting and about 60 minutes of gameplay. I'm also very fond of reading a lot,
so that only helps the rating :P

It has good problem solving and searching inside of the game!   It is a very good game, just going outside of the game and back inside of the game over and over, are just not for me in terms of a play style.

So essentially cons of the game
-there is a lot of opening and closing the game to download external files, use QR codes, find the passwords for the files you download. 
-You can't scroll back to see previous conversation logs, so if you forget something, you're a little screwed because you can't go back to look at it for a re-cap.  Especially unfortunate if you haven't played the game in a while
-The scavenger hunt and problem solving can be hard and time consuming. It can sometimes make the puzzle piece you need to find frustrating.

Pros
-The creator did an AMAZING job of re-creating old OS system graphics and sounds.  Its amazing!
-How the dialogue starts I found kind of funny.
-The problem solving and scavenger hunts can be hard and time consuming.  So it honestly makes it very rewarding when you get that puzzle piece.
-The game does a very good job at setting the atmosphere.
-This game would be amazing for anyone who likes games where you have to go out of the game and find what you need.

HOWEVER, the last few minutes of gameplay almost made up for all of that. I was like, ""HOLY-- WHAT IN BUTTER-Y FUDGE DID I JUST SEE?!""

That ending has been haunting me for days and I can honestly say that after playing Archimedes, I will never forget it.

I recommend this game for the ending alone, and the game itself isn't too expensive. 
There's also a decent guide that's been put up in case you get stuck (like the thousands of others who got stuck because some objectives were just very wishy-washy).

Please support this game. I would love for the developer to hone their skills and make better, more satifying gameplay with an ending that can pack just as much punch.

I want an engaging version of Archimedes (And no, I'm not talking about Pony Island-- although I won't complain if that is the direction the next Archimedes installment goes in).

This program is ridiculously meta, applying its story to your real world. It's difficult to say much without spoiling anything, but the game has you play externally from the software provided. It required me to Google things and even watch a YouTube tutorial on how to proceed within the ""OS"" or program that I was using. During the course of the game, you're corresponding through an IM program with someone. This game required me to actually open my actual e-mail and send him a message in order to get the information that I needed to proceed. The game even has you download audio files at another point.

At first, things seem sketchy. A game on Steam that requires me to download files and interact with the real world? I was at one point, irrationally scared about downloading a virus and had to consult a guide to make sure it was safe. I was thinking to myself: ""How could something like this make it to Steam?"" But as I progressed, the audacity of this game blew my mind. I had no idea what to expect and when things started to escalate, I almost bought that this was a real thing happening, only to realize a moment later how ridiculous that was. How could something be so immersive and frightening?

Do I recommend it? Yes, it's quite the experience. That being said, you probably need to consult a guide to complete this short game. Without it, I never would have known where to proceed. I like puzzles in games, but I also like a small bit of hand-holding as well. This game does not do that. There are many documents that you can read through with clues as where to proceed, but I simply never picked up on them. Like I said though, this game is more an experience than an actual game. I usually would dismiss a game for requiring a guide to finish, but this was so remarkable that I'll concede this an exception.

The game mainly takes place in an emulated 90s-style OS -- indeed, this was one of the main draws of the game for me. This game was recommended in the comments section of a review for Kyle Seeley's excellent Emily Is Away Too, and, although the games could not be more different thematically, there are a number of similarities between Archimedes and the Emily Is Away games, including the game's reliance on what appears to be an older instance of technology and the centrality of an instant messenger program to the storyline. However, Archimedes takes a notable departure from the Emily games in tone, and, ultimately, in gameplay, as completing the game will require exploring corners of the web outside of the actual game (exponentially increasing the effectivenvess of the alternate reality that creator Joshua Hughes is striving to create). 

Archimedes is not flawless (e.g., some formatting oddities within the documents found on the mock OS jolted me out of an otherwise fairly convincing imaginative experience; it is, perhaps a little short, even given the fully appropriate pricetag), but, for those who enjoy alternate-reality games, seek out independent psychological horror, or consider themselves nostalgia junkies, Archimedes is a couple of dollars very well-spent.

- Story: It is boring, short, has holes and doesnt even make sense in the end.

2/10 It didnt worth it. I wanted to like it, i was eager but, no... 2 points goes for the effort to do something original, but nothing seemed like to click together.

This is truly a pretty nice game, even with this length. It combines Real Life actions with in-Game Elements and does it pretty perfect. The ending was a bit ""weak"" in my opinion, especially with all the ""hype"" build in the game. A second installment or something else would be pretty nice for that.

I'm all for fourth wall breaking experiences but when the very first line ""you"" say is ""Wait, isn't this a game?"" it completely ruins it. There's absolutely no chance of getting absorbed into it after that point. 

And sadly it doesn't get any better from there. The OS is frustrating to navigate. There is a Notepad equivalent that's useless because you can't access it whilst looking at another window. Sure it's kind of cool to have to write stuff down yourself but why include the notepad at all if you can't use it? So instead I just alt-tabbed every few minutes to write something down in an actual Notepad file. 

The conversations you have are disappointing too. You have no choice. You have to mash your keyboard to type but it's all preset stuff and again when it's me that's supposed to be interacting with this it once again sucks all the immersion out of it when ""my"" responses are already chosen for me and more often than not were things I wouldn't say or ask about. 

It also doesn't help that there are huge pauses at times. Often you can complete an objective and then just have to wait for the other person to start talking again. 

Not keen on having to download files from Mediafire either. Especially when the audio in them is such low quality. 
Again it's interesting, downloading files, using Google Maps, sending e-mails, some cool ideas, but just done poorly here and better elsewhere.

I didn't enjoy my time with it and sadly I don't think I'll go back to finish it but for £2 it might be worth a punt if it sounds like your kind of thing.",1491145618,1491145618,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- You have to keep monkey-typing into the 'MSN'-like window to advance. You don't know how much monkey-typing is needed to complete the text you're typing, or when you'll next need to monkey-type, so there's a constant cycle of mouse-keyboard-mouse-keyboard, etc. Ok, minor inconvenience, but it grates - there has to have been a better way to do this.

- Windows can't be moved around, rearranged, or ordered on the desktop. There are times at which it would be useful to view information in one window so that you can type it into another, but that ability is missing.

- At one point it's necessary to download and listen to some audio files. This is a cool aspect - merging in the 'real world' with the game - but the sound quality of the files was so scratchy/distorted/badly-levelled that I couldn't understand a word. Perhaps just me, or perhaps they're supposed to be a 'thematic' challenge in this way, but I didn't have any audio-cleanup software handy, so this is the point at which I gave up.

- For some reason the Steam overlay didn't work while in-game, so any time it sent me out onto the real web I had to quit the game entirely then reload it.

It was a type of game I wanted but hadn't access to so I made it up on my own in the only method my young mind could think of. Playing this way was entertaining enough that I created several character classes and moderately in-depth universes within a span of a few pages of chat logs crafted in a basic text editor.

[h1]Let the world know what ARC did[/h1]
It is an unrealistic expectation to write down what this game is about without spoiling everything (even without the ending). I can tell you when I was proofreading this I ended up sounding like Jessica Hyde was narrating a spin off of the phantasmal and mysterious UK drama series, [i]Utopia[/i]. [strike]Conspiracy theorists unite?[/strike]

[spoiler]The virus, Archimedes (ARST) is responsible for a string of strange suicides and nothing is quite as it seems. Oblivious to you, the player, someone with the handle User2409 has connected to your system from the offices of a corporation called ARC (Advanced Research Centre) using the game you've just installed. 

You sift through police and medical records in disturbing detail, search Google Maps for coordinates that open secret expedition logs, manually download audio files directly from the internet and open password encrypted computer databases as well as private emails to aid User2409 in their mission to uncover the secret behind ARC and the Archimedes virus. User2409 has undertaken a grave task which is costing him his safety among frightening mysterious disappearances of several of his colleagues and friends.[/spoiler]

It's a short couple of hours length but enjoyable. The writing may not impress and astound but it's amusing the way the less scary roller coasters are as you wait for the queues in front of the bigger rides to diminish at a theme park. The developer has the skills to bring us an even more thrilling game in a similar vein. The two hours felt short (though not abrupt which is typically the downside) and many players want more. The undoubtedly indie graphics have absolutely nothing on the overall aesthetics of this game. Without giving anything away I particularly enjoyed the execution of the final ""conversation"" where the dialogue was projected in a manner of visual intensity that worked tremendously well with the climactic last tasks the player must perform. I know. How awfully vague of me *fake fainting*! 

We must each have a gazillion different memories related to the Win 95 interface. It's what draws a lot of people to this game initially. When [i]Her Story[/i] popped up last year that familiar Windows 95 screen with the repugnant yellowing version of jade green (never looked teal to me, more like pigment green: HEX #008f4f) as the backdrop for a selection of moth-eaten, pixelated desktop icons I was understandably drenched in childhood nostalgia. Once [i]Emily is Away[/i] came along and the game revolved solely around IMs, I was infatuated with the realisation that a computer game [i]could[/i] talk to me one day. Perhaps my childhood hobby of writing self made chat logs was birthed from a strong desire to interact through games with someone only occupied with their real emotions in reaction to my own without the responsibility of me having to talk to another individual person in a more human relationship (where one is occupied in oneself). Even though intelligent machines and emotional pattern recognition in computers is now a reality, in mere mortal gaming we still have to make do with the punching of random keyboard keys to input preset dialogues the way Emily is Away and Archimedes both require for an on rails experience. It does take away from immersion and though not quite the interactive game I still yearn for, it creates a mirage of it through the completion of several tasks (puzzles and ""fact"" finding similar to [i]Welcome To the Game[/i]'s deep web simulation) rewarded with fluid progression. Time and time again this fashion of storytelling proves itself as a thought-provoking mode of playing adventure/simulation games. Slightly off topic but being such a distinct form of relaying narrative, we may one day even be able to dress the most classic of literature in a more digestible form using a similar medium.


[b][U]Points to keep in mind before playing[/u][/b]
[list]
[*]Caution: This game can only be played once. It will automatically close once you play it to the end. Which proves just hard it works to keep as much immersion as possible despite the hurdles mentioned above. Keep an eye on your trading cards. Though they drop quickly, once the game ends they will be harder to get. 

[*]Even though it is a one time experience, and short at that (1-2 hrs long), [i]Archimedes[/i] requires patience, something I don't possess. My current housemate calls me ""The Keyboard Abuser"". When I first moved in he'd walk up to me on the PC and ask me in a very serious voice, ""Are you really typing coherent sentences or just bashing the keyboard for sport? It really looks like the latter to me"". I'm so used to blowing through the net and getting all my information lightning fast that I've long forgotten the frustrations of the 90s OS.  IntraMessage, the AIM/ICQ-like IM program in this game, is tediously slow but by mid gameplay you'll become used to the zen state it guides you into as you wait for 2409 to reply. If something fails (e.g. exiting windows to quickly so failing to progress, not being able to prompt the next sequence of chat logs), reboot the game and it'll bring you back to your last auto save which works well.

[*]You may have to visit the forum once or twice if you do get stuck. All the answers are hidden there with helpful explanations. 

[*]The game asks you to download, open, run, send, receive things IRL via your actual device. 

[*]At the end of the game you are required to follow a set of rules where you must press specific keys on your keyboard that may/may not be in the correct place depending on which country you bought your keyboard. I ended up taking the moronic route of just pressing all the possible ones which worked fine but you might/might not just want to look it up ;D.

I haven't actually finished the game, as I found the interface too frustrating to use.

The game pretends to be an OS, but some fairly simple things haven't been implemented. For example, you can't move open windows, meaning that if you try to have more than one thing open at once they stack on top of each other, or sometimes close each other. You ""talk"" to somebody through an IM client, and have to spam the keyboard to see what you yourself type. I personally found this incredibly annoying, especially as the game makes typing sounds as you do it, meaning you have the click of your own keyboard (especially pronounced in my case, as I'm using a mechanical keyboard), plus the clicking of the game. Even a mouse click to continue would have been much better.

The sounds of the game are almost enough to give you a headache. It has the sound of a system fan constantly, and added to the sound of the real fans in my computer, it's an incredibly annoying sound.

The game is certainly an interesting concept (and I've thoroughly enjoyed ""games"" that simulate operating systems, like VIRLAB for DOS). If the developer made some changes to the interface I'd probably change this to a positive reccomendation and finish the game, but as it stands at the moment, I can't recommend it.",1478604193,1478604274,False,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What I do like:

It's only $2.99, but as of now it is in a bundle
The game is different. I've not played anything exactly like it before. The best game comparison I can make would be [spoiler]""Pony Island.""[/spoiler] It also reminds me of the movie, [spoiler]""The Thing.""[/spoiler]
It's short (not a bad thing in this case)
I enjoy the ""detective aspect"" of it, having to use external resources. (Although some of the external interactions made me wary.)

What I don't like:

[spoiler]The chat is scripted.[/spoiler] (I completely understand why this is from a design perspective, but it really broke the immersion for me.)
The story starts off strong, but then...
Some of the external programs you use and what you have to do with them. [spoiler](Downloading files, sending emails.)[/spoiler]
The fact that I want to play another game like this by the developer but there isn't one

The dev wasn't kidding when he put an epilepsy warning up. He responded to me in the forums about it, but damn does my head hurt badly right now. So be warned if you're epileptic or get photosensitive migraines.

This game is original, interesting and fun. Though it's not fun in the normal ""video-gamey"" way. The fun comes from all the work that goes into figuring out the puzzles and such. If you're not into researching, or don't have patience for something that requires effort or is very slow paced, this game might not be for you.

In the end, I do recommend people buy this game. I'm actually sad it's in a bundle so soon after launch. It's well worth the $2.99, and I'd like to see enough interest in this game to make the dev want to create something else.

Don't watch any walkthroughs or let's plays for it. Just buy it and figure it out on your own.

I bought this game without knowing that it can only be played ONCE!

Archmides is an ARG (alternate reality game) featuring an basic OS-desktop as your playground. Soon after starting the game you are contacted by some unknown outside person, seeking your aid in solving the mysteries hidden in the files of the OS. Playing the game requires pen&paper, lots of Alt+Tabing and visiting several webpages like Google Maps or Dropbox.
 
Graphics and sound are minmial, the design tries hard to resemble a Win 3.0-look, but still feels lackluster, without any charme. Any kind of eye-catching feature or possible more interaction with the OS would have been a large improvement.

While the story seems compelling enough, soon you realize that you are being guided through the game, not really discovering the dark secrets of a fictional agency but rather getting told ""enter this URL, go there, listen to that, read that page for secrets"".

Archimedes manages to capture that anticipatory horror and suspense very well. The puzzles and fourth-wall breaking tasks are novel and enjoyable though I never felt as though I came up against a wall at any point. (Which is a positive and a negative!)

For it's price it is a very enjoyable game, I feel like I got my money out of it and it only took around 75 minutes to finish. Which doesn't sound very long but given the price point I think that I got good value out of it.

The puzzles themselves are enjoyable but not so obtuse, the suspense is great though if I were unaware that the game is considered a horror game I'm not convinced that I would be as nervous as I was throughout. I wouldn't want to spoil the game but I did find that the 'reveal' was a little underwhelming and I think I would have liked to see more of the game actively trying to scare, perhaps another 20 or so minutes added on to the game would have been nice just to see more of the antagonist actively interfering with my actions or causing issues whilst solving puzzles. 

That said, I consider this game to be a rough gem, worth the money and definitely something I would love to see more of. It whetted my appetite for more games which are ARG-like and I felt at the end like I wanted more. Certainly a better outcome than becoming jaded by what is going on and feeling like I was slogging through to the end to see the conclusion.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game but I'm left wanting more of this type of ARG-esque experience, the suspense was great but the reveal didn't spook me as much as I had built up, but maybe that's a testament to the atmosphere the game creates. All in all, if you like puzzles and mysteries, especially those that break the fourth wall and leak out into the real cyberspace I would wholeheartedly recommend the game. For the price point an hour's entertainment is well worth it and it has certainly left a hunger that I never knew I had. Cheaper than going to see a movie and certainly felt alot more engaging and involving.

As with games of this type there is pretty much no replayability, once you've solved the puzzles it's done. Great game, great atmosphere. If you're on the fence, and you think it might be your thing, give it a shot.",1476312458,1476312458,True,1,0,0.504426538944244385,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For one thing, the game's premise is awesome. I love the idea of browsing a haunted, or virus-ridden OS with bugs you have to work around. However, that premise is shattered the minute you boot up the game and get the message from the ""User"". Then it quickly becomes one of those games where the plot is driven by the fake chatroom and not the act of browing and exploring a fake OS. You kind of depend on the person in the chat room to give you the ""next step"" to access more files, or trigger the next part of the narrative.

This game also does that ""fake typing"" thing (Where you can press random keys but pre-canned responses come out regardless of what you actually typed), so you can literally roll your head across the keyboard to advance the plot. I personally hate this trend in general because there's always a disconnect between what I feel at the moment and what I'm typing out. It constantly reminds me that I'm just playing a game and not actually browsing an emulated OS. To top it all off, your responses for the first few minutes are  whining about not playing a game you downloaded from Steam, and that really brought me out of the whole thing.

My other issue is with the ""OS emulation"" aspect in of itself. Sometimes it's fine, and allows you to copy, paste, and type whatever you like. But one huge issue is the inability to move windows around by clicking and dragging. This gets especially annoying later because there are clues on certain windows that you need to advance the plot on other windows, but you have to close one window to access the other window behind it to type in the information you just learned. So, play this game with a phone or some pen and paper handy.

One other thing I hate, which is another annoying trend in games, is the puzzles that exist outside of the game, which you can only access by downloading certain files from dropbox and mediafire. Not only are these rather artificial, if just one of them ends up corrupted or pulled down, or if the site hosting them goes under (remember Megaupload, anybody?) it runs the risk of breaking the entire game and making it impossible to progress. There's also a QR code, which is a whole other can of worms, but thankfully, it's just one.

Last bit, and this is going into spoiler territory, so don't highlight it if you are still interested in playing. 
[spoiler]The virus itself only shows up in the last few minutes of the game, which was extremely disappointing. I expected it to start interfering with you in subtle ways throughout the game, but the corruption only starts happening during the climax of the plot and when you attempt to install another virus to fight it. That said, the imagery for the final ""battle"" was AWESOME, and I would have loved for that to be spread across the game.[/spoiler]

In conclusion, that is how I feel about the game. I still recommend people check it out because I would actually like an Archimedes 2 that maybe doubles down on the OS emulation aspect, and I imagine that would require a higher budget and more development time. This game was a neat little experiment overall, but it just didn't click with me.",1476161113,1476161113,False,6,0,0.576550900936126709,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was looking for something that had to do with cryptography or puzzle-solving; this game satisfied that itch. 

Without giving too much away, the game opens as though it is a virtual desktop running an OS called Intra. Much of the dialogue and story is moved forward by talking to a character through instant messaging. It isn't as tedious as it might sound, though, because the character has you perform several tasks on the OS.

What I like about Archimedes is that not only does it make references to real-world locations, but it has you use real-world tools outside of the game (like Google Maps and audio players) to move the game along. There was a time when it had me download some files from a Dropbox folder. I was a little wary of it (you know, don't want to catch a virus), but I scanned them and they're safe.

I would like to see another game like this come out. I only wish that it was a little deeper - I wish there were more details in Intra that I could dig around for, maybe find out more about the in-game characters/company/other plot devices. I wish there were more real-world references, like locations to look up, etc. That sort of stuff reminds me of Dan Brown's novels (like the Da Vinci Code), and that's the kind of thing that would really suck me in!",1476065070,1476065070,True,3,0,0.526184558868408203,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes, the game is short (3 hours in my case), but that doesn't make it any less interesting.

A word of caution to non-native English speakers though: your capacity to understand spoken English over a low-quality signal may or may not slow down your progress. Same for your keyboard configuration. There's a puzzle that took me over 30 minutes to understand _how_ to input the required keys, because apparently the default way of inputing those keys on my keyboard was not the expected answer. I'll classify those as ""localization"" issues and they should not halt your progress, thanks to the community. However, be careful when going to forum so as not to get spoiled.

This game rely heavily on external resources like dropbox or mediafire. That is a very interesting concept for sure and change the way you ""play"" a game. I even had to install a program on my computer to solve a puzzle, that a first for me! However, story-wise it is unclear why those files would be hosted there. From a story perpective, it would make more sense if the person you are talking to would avoid corporate firewalls by sending you things through these media, however that's not the case. What you'll grab from these external resources are ""highly-classifed"" data that should have been hosted on their internal network. Kind of weird.

Another puzzle goes through an external resource where there's a mix of curated content and user-uploaded content. That is dangerous. I hope no one uploads false leads into there, but I suspect that it already happened. For the same puzzle, the developer didn't seem aware of two different ways of displaying an information, leading to much confusion in the user group. I don't want to spoil, so I'll use an analogy: the puzzle requires you to input a temperature and gives you a field like [__] F.  Out of that, you would think that it's expecting fahrenheit, but no, it's expecting Celcius. This is not an actual game puzzle, it's just to give an idea of the mismatch between the two ""formats"".

Overall, I enjoyed the games but I had to go to the forums too often. The ideas are great, but if the realisation of those ideas had been a bit more polished, it would have been truly awesome.

I do hope that the developer takes the time to polish these few puzzles. Not to make them easier to find out the answer, but to make it easier to get pass them once you have the answer. (Like any puzzle, the fun is in finding the key -- not loosing an hour to understand how to use the key).

If you don't like writing stuff down and doing a lot of researching outside of the game this game ain't for you. You won't need any programming or vastly advanced computer skills to play this game (the few times you do need those the solution is written down somewhere in the game)

You will have to a lot of things outside of the game like downloading files and sometimes even edit them to get information and move on. That means you will spend a lot of your time with this game outside the actual game instead of playing around with the ingame OS. Thats also part of it's weaknesses. You do A LOT of stuff outside the game but I would have liked a bit more playing around in the OS itself.

The second thing is the OS: It is very basic. Windows are static and cant be moved and there can only be one or two windows up at a time. There is also not much to do inside of the OS because there aren't a lot of functions in it and the few functions that are available are only useful at certain times in the story. The OS isn't the meat of the game. It
rather functions as a story-device to give you stuff to do outside of the game.

The third thing is the playtime: It took me 110 minutes to complete this game (leaving the game running while doing all the outside game stuff in the browser) thats 110 minutes with getting stuck twice taking around ten to fifteen minutes each to get back on track. 110 minutes is not bad for a 3 dollar game but it feels like once you get the hang of it and get into the story it ends a bit abruptly and leaves you hanging wanting more.

The third thing is a bit nitpicky: the background noise doesn't make a lot of sense and physically hurt me.
The game has background noise consisting of computer-fan and harddrive noises- given that the game tells you that it is the VM of an operating system, the noise doesn't make much sense even though it is probably there so you get more immersed. There is also a highpitched hissing (probably a coil whine) and even though I had the game running with a pretty low volume it gave me really bad tinnitus and even slight hearing loss on one ear (nothing permanent, it got better after an hour or so) with headphones on. 

I also encountered a few bugs in my playthrough: I could access the ingame email account without a password prompt before it. So the long quest for getting the login info just got me back to where i was. Putting in the info still got the game to progress. And later you have to copy and paste 5 or 6 commands into a command line. I just put in the first one and still beat the game which shouldn't have worked.

All in all if you like the idea of a game making you think outside of the box and don't mind getting stuck once or twice,
for 3 dollars you are getting a pretty good and slightly creepy game that is a bit rough around the edges.",1475978482,1482358559,True,2,0,0.502428889274597168,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I just finished it a few mins ago, and there are a lot of things I like about it and a few things I think could have been done a bit better..

I really like the overall feel of the game, and having actually used Windows since 3.0 in the early 90's I can say this has the ""feel"" of Windows 95.  Some people have complained about the real world ties like Mediafire, email, youtube, Google Maps (which I never could get the right coordinates with..  I had to get them from Bing Maps, and PLEASE do not consider that an endorsement of Bing, as I loathe it as a search engine..)  I actually like that you have to go outside the game for resources, but I think they should all be on a host controlled by the game devs..  The game files will eventually get taken down and someone might put malicious files for people to find..  This way is far too open to external abuse.  Also, the Mediafire site attempted to force me into dowloading one of the many ""PC Optimizer"" trojans out there..  That is just really unacceptable.

Overall I really liked the game, but they need to get control of the external resources.  I had hoped to go back into the game and start over and see if there was anything I missed along the way..  I'm sure I'll be able to, but they should make it easy for people who don't know what to do.

A bit of feedback directly to the game devs.. That ""code"" or script you enter for the endgame scenario is a bit too ""real"".. Have you tested to see what happens if a user runs it on their PC?  I haven't tested it myself, but on some older OS, like Windows XP, it might be damaging..  Also, if you go back to the emails to see if you missed anything, if you read the last one, it resets back to that point with the IM dialogue and you have to click through it to get back to where you were.

Nothing too much, but because so much of this game happens outside this game, that alone would help to make sure that things are working right outside the game parameters. This also goes for how it's meant to feel like a moderately expansive OS, but there's large limitations on what it can or can't do, and the lack of feedback means it's not too intuitive. Ironically, dealing a lot with command lines to begin with actually makes it seem even less intuitive.
