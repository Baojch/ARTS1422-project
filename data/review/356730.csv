Se cercate uno stuzzicante gioco di avventura  vogliate rivolgere le vostre attenzioni a questo The Hole Story sviluppato da volenterose studentesse sparse per il mondo. Dal mio incipit si arguisce la natura amatoriale dell'opera, che traspare evidente, per esempio, dalla sua grafica e dalla sua brevit√†. Ma il gioco offre anche una idea interessante ed uno spirito sbarazzino che si incarna nella sua protagonista Wendy e nei vari personaggi non giocanti che lei incontra. L'idea di creare personaggi muniti di vanga √® gi√† quasi un genere a s√© nel mondo dei videogiochi, e Wendy non sfugge a questa moda: figlia di archeologi, e lei stessa archeologa in erba, questa simpatica ragazzetta se ne va in giro a scavare fossi nel terreno, concentrando in questa sua azione di scavatrice la risoluzione degli enigmi del gioco. Esiste altres√¨ l'inventario, ridotto all'osso e senza possibilit√† di combinare gli oggetti raccolti tra loro; questi ultimi sono usati automaticamente quando c'√® l'interazione adatta. Il divertimento che ho provato a giocare questa avventura risiede altres√¨ nelle continue facezie e battute argute che Wendy si lascia sfuggire sia nei suoi dialoghi con i personaggi che incontra sia nelle sue osservazioni a corredo delle interazioni con gli oggetti del fondale: queste ultime per me sono una prova della cura che le sviluppatrici hanno messo nella reazione del gioco, sempre tenendo presente della natura dilettantistica dell'opera.  C'√® da dire per√≤ che i giochi di parole spesso sono ad uso e consumo dei fruitori della lingua inglese e fuori dalla portata della nostra comprensione. I personaggi poi sono alquanto stravaganti ed improbabili, in linea con la natura ironica ed inverosimile del titolo. La colonna sonora √® molto apprezzabile, ed addirittura ci sono anche degli spezzoni recitati a voce. Nella descrizione ufficiale del gioco si allude a guadagno di esperienza che permetterebbe una personalizzazione del personaggio e migliorie delle attrezzature, ed a segreti: in verit√† non ne ho trovati, non so se per mia insufficiente applicazione, e comunque, scavare in giro a casaccio e senza metodo non mi attira molto. Fatemi sapere se confermate di contro che avete appurato la presenza di queste caratteristiche.  
In definitiva l'opera ha brio e carattere, ed anche una certa malizia nel suo finale: se reputate accettabile il prezzo datele la possibilit√† di divertirvi perch√© il gioco non √® un ... buco nell'acqua.",1701009907,1701030278,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,4,False,False,False,True,,,

If you're getting this game to support the developers, sure that's worth it. But if you're getting this game wanting something to _play_, then... don't. There's no game to play, so to speak. You can finish the entire game in an hour, and  you'll wish you hadn't spent that time.

A few major points which irritated me whilst playing:
- Controls are... awkward, to say the least. It's not a game you can play on keyboard, unless I missed something. I got it to work by a combination of keyboard+controller... to talk to someone I had to use the controller to initiate the dialogue, but I'd then needed to switch to my mouse to click to advance the dialogue... I nearly quit the first 5 minute of the game because of this.
- There is no puzzle. There are riddles, yes, but they make no difference whatsoever to the game.  There are quests, yes, but every quest is pretty much solved by randomly digging around hoping you'll dig the item you need. 
- Game is buggy... at one point I spent 5-10 minutes digging around and not finding my objective... which was OK, as there was a troll that said that I needed to give it certain items so that it would let me pass, and yet I could just walk past it across the bridge to continue the game. At one point in the game I was transported to another place and had to walk back to where I was... for no explanation.
- There is no plot. I'm neutral on this one as the game's supposedly made as part of an educational effort of some sort...
- Until the very end, I failed to figure out how to save the game, so it was a blessing that the game was so short.

You are immediately thrown into the game without any knowledge of controls. I spent several minutes just trying to figure out what keys did things. When I did finally find the right button (something obscure like ""J"" to dig?), it did not take very long for me to get bored with the game.

I understand that the premise is digging things up with your shovel, but there are no designated places to dig, and one of the quests I actually tried had me digging up several kinds of apples for no reason until I finally found the right one.

The game is lacking in story, explanation, and things to do. It's like a 2D walking simulator, but with a shovel that you can use to dig for random things.

If you're going to buy it, wait until it goes on sale because it is not worth $5.

The art style, while nice, seems a bit bland, with the proportions of some objects rather odd. The animations for the main character also look stiff, as though a few pixels were moved and was deemed ""Good Enough.""

I didn't play the game for very long, but with no real story element, or reasoning to dig a hole in the ground, it makes the game rather dry and boring. After finding an old key and being transported elsewhere, I immediately dug up an apple and saw the fortune teller. This either skipped an important dialogue box, or the game simply didn't have one to begin with, however it immediately told me to dig up a different apple and bring it back without too much help but a basic description. I may have overlooked something here and it may have told me the actual kind of apple needed, so if it did, I do apologize. While looking for apples though, it told me the kinds of apples, which to me was feeling a bit pointless for a game, since as a person I couldn't care less about the actual kinds of them. 

When I tried to replay it to test whether or not the quest dialogue box was different if I hadn't grabbed an apple yet, I instead spawned in a spot where I could not move from, thus rendering the game unplayable.
