These three early games in the series will not open if you don't allow them to make changes to your computer so they can automatically adjust your screen resolution for you. Unfortunately, this one in particular happens to be the clunkiest of the trio, as you will have to manually readjust the resolution to your preferred default setting after closing the game.

If any of that makes you uncomfortable, you may want to pass up on adding this third installment of the [i]Hidden Expedition[/i] series to your collection! Furthermore, what I had initially attributed to a resolution issue is actually a feature and not a bug. Visibility of hidden items is limited in order to raise the difficulty level of the game. Some are blurry, some blend in with the backgrounds, and some are silhouettes. While it doesn't make the game unplayable, it may cause frustration, especially when looking for the hint beetles in the Beetle Temple where everything is beetle but wrong. (I can't tell you how many times I clicked on what I thought was a hint bug and it was actually just part of the temple motif. At least the penalty for misclicking is less of an obstacle than in the previous games.)

What I find most fascinating about the progression of this series is the way that this game is a rudimentary version of what the series and genre would eventually become. You can see it still figuring itself out - removing some features (such as voiceovers and secret items) that would eventually come back in later games and further improving/expanding on features that were already there (such as the use of puzzles and cutscenes to tell a story) - but the elements are falling into place. Compared to the first two games, [i]Amazon[/i] is a lot heavier on the plot despite being primarily focused on its hidden object scenes. At every turn, a new piece of story is delivered to the player and NPCs pop up frequently with something to say. The gameplay is still mostly intuitive, but the game will notify you of the rules and features when it appears that you are stuck (ie. you take too long to complete the tutorial scene or accidentally trigger a penalty) just in case you are unfamiliar with the genre.

The plethora of hidden object scenes and the slightly more interactive adventure themed gameplay (think point-and-click adventure style) are great compared to some of the puzzles interspersed throughout the levels. While creative, they can be a bit confusing to understand at first glance, especially when not enough information is given to adequately explain the task. Sometimes clicking the hint button offers more instruction and sometimes it starts solving the puzzle for you without any indication of why or how. The good news is that, if you're not interested in the puzzles at all or if they prove to be too difficult, you can just keep clicking the hint button until it skips the puzzle entirely. Although I appreciate the innovation and consideration for different play styles, I still vastly prefer the distinction between a hint button and a skip button that would soon become a staple of the genre.

And now, unfortunately, there is an elephant in this rainforest that we can no longer avoid addressing.

The story seems to want to take an 8th Wonder of the World (a la Hanging Gardens of Babylon) approach to the search for the Beetle Temple and a decent amount of quirky humor was put into it, but it ends up taking a hard turn into exoticism and then barrels straight into the white savior trope. The Professor’s unsavory comments and doodles about the locals coupled with some stereotypical interpretations of indigenous people leave a bad taste behind as you try to find some semblance of joy in navigating the gameplay of this fast-paced adventure. It’s a real shame that the educational aspect of the series was put on hold for this.

At the end of the day, I [i]really[/i] can't recommend the game for the racism in the plot - surely, Big Fish Games had more resources available to them than [b]that[/b] - but it does stand up as a fascinating relic of the hidden object genre's transitional period, so I will only very cautiously recommend it to longtime fans who are interested in experiencing the gameplay progression like I was.

There were numerous lists of HO objects, but were interspersed with a story which was interesting.  Some scenes were quirky and fun things happened.  At the airport, a spaceship came along and kidnapped someone, so the devs had a sense of humour!!
Music was really cinematic and added drama whilst playing the HO scenes.  Overall it took me 5 hours.  Scenes were broken up by puzzles which were fiendish....mainly because there wasn't much explanation.  Finding bugs added to the hint system which was necessary in some areas.  I give it 7/10.

Now this is an older game so it's not going to blow you away, but I still to this day play it at least once a year (if not more). I've been playing it on Bigfish but since I use Steam 99% of the time, I'm glad the game moved over here.

The Hidden Expeditions are another group of HOG games that range from mediocre to fantastic. Steam is actually missing quite a few of my favorites but with the slew of hidden object games appearing everyday, I would bet we'll see them at some point.

Hidden Expedition: Amazon is all about the HO scenes. That's what the game is comprised of, with a smattering of puzzles here and there. The story is mostly told by reading journal pages, one on each scene, written by a kooky old man who is searching for the lost Beetle Temple.

And now I'll tell you why I myself love this game. A large portion of the enjoyment is the music. It's just beautiful and I never tire of listening to it. Also, Beetles! I find beetles fascinating. In every HO scene (except for the very first one) there are 5 beetles to find which charge up your hint bar. I always find the journal page and all 5 beetles before searching for the other items. I also always read the journal pages (though I probably have them memorized by now) because they are quite amusing. The combo of lovely music, a beetle theme, lots and lots of HO scenes, and a story that makes me smile - it's great.

I can certainly say this isn't for everyone. Obviously look elsewhere if you don't enjoy hidden object games. It's also not super easy and not super hard - definitely for the casual gamer. (Well, some of the items and beetles are very sneakily hidden but you'll find them eventually :p). But I really had to write a review because this game is dear to my heart.

I would not recommend playing this game on the PC. It is clearly a IOS/Android port game designed for low resolution usage. Even on my old screen (16870 * 1050) it was shown in a real small frame. This made playing the game a bit of a hassle. (I would however consider buying it for my tablet if the price is reasonable).  I finished the game in roughly 6 hours, which was more or less my expectation although i hoped it would take me more time. 

Pro's:
+ Sounds and music are nice
+ Puzzles are challenging enough for a hidden object game
+ scenes are nice setup. 

Con's: 
- Screen resolution!  Screen resolution! Screen resolution! 
- Sometimes it is not clear what is expected from certain puzzles throughout the game. 
- 10 EUR /USD too expensive (value for money wise)

Final thoughts: 
I would not recommend buying unless you really enjoy these types of games and they put up on a steamsale deal. The scaling of the game to a small window is really annoying and would require adjustment of your native screen resolution to be playable. If the creators of this game would repair the screen resolution issues it might be a slightly different case.",1451156916,1451157068,False,3,2,0.563683032989501953,0,True,False,False,False,

It means that while you have a story, you're just going from list of items to list of items. Here, you're still an adventurer but you're in South America, as the title is suggesting.

And when you're thinking about this era, it means lots of items in the scene, with some being well hidden without forgetting a number of hints instead of it being resplenished. You can also get more of them by finding insects (5 of them are hidden but not at the same place). It means also random list as every playthrough is different. And generally, that era was also setting high scores.

While I'm more inclined to play the new generation of HO, that are mixing adventure, puzzles and HO scenes, I must say that I still have good moments with the old generation. However, for those that never played them before, it may appear as boring as hell. The graphics are correct, like the soundtrack, but I must admit that you're quickly fed up of the lists after a moment, even me that played Mystery P.I. or the other Hidden Expedition in retail.

Despite that, it's like retro-gaming or playing an old Doom, you enjoy these memories of another era. Or it's nice to know where the genre comes from. Anyway, while I admit that 10 euros is maybe a little too much for the game now - and that you may never see a discount, the game is still worthy.
