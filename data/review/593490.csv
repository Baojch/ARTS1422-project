Not great, not terrible, just fine. There's a couple of reasons why I'm ruling it as not recommended, though. First of all, it's clearly not finished. There's grammar errors everywhere, the build menu is a bit buggy (you can enter another context menu while still in the building interface, but closing either closes both), there's some keybind conflicts (Right-click, for example, is both movement and exiting a context, so if you try to pan while building you stop building), et cetera, et cetera. The fact that the update history runs pretty well until it hard stops in September 2018 isn't promising, though it's not super unprecedented for a surprise update after lots of time away (See Victoria 2, Reus, et al). The second reason I'm not recommending the game is that it often feels like you need to wrangle information out of the game, if the game is even willing to give you information at all. Things like ""How much food do my people need?"" or ""How long does it take for my workshop to finish a cycle?"" or ""How far does my market reach?"" are questions that are either unanswerable or so unnecessarily obfuscated that it's difficult to figure out how to optimally build a city. Maybe that's not super important to everybody, but it's the kind of thing that really annoys me.

Empire Architect is a city building game set in the Roman Empire.
In the rest of the review, I will attempt to not go into comparisons with other games, but in advance it should be stated that this game is very similar to Caesar III, but it has quite a different scope.
[u]What is it like?[/u]
Empire Architect offers two ways to play, either a campaign with maps with predefined goals or a sandbox game on a random map.
Whichever way you choose, you are trusted with building settlements in the Roman Empire. You do this by building houses for your people, providing them with entertainment, health and religion and making goods.
Goods are needed on one hand for keeping your citizens happy (the better their home, the more goods they require) on the other for trading - the latter will be the town's main source of income. There are several different types of goods like pottery, furniture or clothes. Each product requires some raw material and at least one step of processing (e.g. pottery from clay), but there are some that require two steps in two separate buildings to process (e.g. furniture is made in a furniture factory from lumber, which, in turn, is made at a lumber mill from wood, gathered at a lumber yard). This means the player needs to set up an infrastructure for making enough materials to make enough finished goods for the populace and trade (and, in the case of certain resources, for building buildings).
While goods are nice, the true soul of a city is its people, and this is where Empire Architect differs most from its inspiration. Instead of building cities of tens of thousands of nameless people, you build towns of a couple hundred, maybe a thousand inhabitants, but each of them are named and have their own routines. This means that each of them has a schedule of going to work, going home to rest and going to the market to pick up food and goods. Each citizen also has their own happiness level as well, made up of their satisfaction with their dwelling, their choice of food, choice of goods and access to water, religion, entertainment and health services and the desirability of their surroundings.
Citizens can also be educated in schools so that they can fulfill jobs that require an educated employee.
In an interesting minor twist of the usual formula, buildings have more than one type of employee, e.g. production buildings have workers that actually make the product and a cart pusher who is responsible for delivering their product to a storage building and, unless the building makes some raw material itself, getting raw materials for the production. While it doesn't make much difference gameplay-wise (aside from being able to set different salaries for the different roles), it is a nice touch.
Speaking of buildings, another interesting difference (and one with slightly more impact) from standard city builders is that building don't just appear by themselves, they need to be built by builders, sent out from architect's offices. The bigger the building, the longer it takes to build, and when the player builds many buildings at once (e.g. a new housing block or a new production centre), if there are not enough builders, it will be quite some time before everything is finished.
Helping the player in running the city is a host of informative reports and graphs, accessible from one central menu.
There is a military aspect in the game as well, but like in most games of this kind it is perfunctory at best, with legionnaires and bowmen available for training and a ""click somewhere and hope your guys will prevail"" style of combat, so it's obvious this part of the game was not where the developer's focus was.
There is no multiplayer, but on custom games, the player can choose to have one or more AI rivals on the same map.

[u]Pros and cons[/u]
++Overall, the game is nice and well designed, the different parts of citizen management, production, etc. fitting well together to make the game entertaining.
++Thanks to the campaign also serving a as a tutorial, the game is quite accessible. Different difficulty levels also mean that the player can choose how forgiving or challenging they want the game to be.
-That said, in some parts, there is a distinct lack of information, for example when the player is struck with a blessing or curse from one of the deities, it doesn't say what actually happened. Also, the tutorial doesn't always explain elements which do come up in the given mission (such as how to fulfill imperial orders).
+For a game where having stellar graphics was obviously not the focus during development, buildings are decorated quite nicely, they show a definite attention to detail.
-However, the graphics might be too minimalist even for some city building fans.
+The music is nice and Roman-like...
-...but gets repetitive fast.
++Having a smaller number of actual individual citizens means the player really feels like they're caring for actual people who depend on them for having a nice place to live.
-On the other hand, since here the player doesn't build cities for many thousands, it doesn't feel like we build an actual city, let alone a metropolis.
++Managing all the production chains and all the requirements of the populace makes a nice kind of challenge.
-Still, I feel like there's a bit of a missed opportunity here; for example, while citizens go to have a rest and buy goods, they don't actually visit entertainment buildings or temples like they do, for example, in the Tropico games.",1548605808,1548605808,True,4,0,0.581499457359313965,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Some things have been improved on but some stalwart features just havent been taken on at all.

I admit I've not delved fully into the game.

Pros:
+ Fairly straightforward copy of Caesar III and sequelling city-builders.
+ Roadbuilding quickbutton, once found.
+ Handheld early campaign for those not familiar with the game
+ Limitless amount of maps through random generation

Cons:
- Fairly straightforward copy of Caesar III and sequelling city-builders.
- Handheld early campaign for those familiar with the game.
- Doesn't copy well enough the mechanics of Caesar III.
- Random maps are made with haphazard splat-generation.
- Trees can't be cut without lumber mills, which limits megalomany.

The game itself has a delightful small-team feel, and thus I hopped right into it, and but five minutes later was down the memory lane when I was but a wee lad and my crush gave me Caesar III in exchange for some game I do not even remember any more. This was both a good and a bad thing. For one, I got to remember all the cool things and micromanagement I quite enjoyed back in the day, but none of it works as well as it did with Caesar. Then, I get to troubleshoot again with employment, health, building health and water like I used to, but again with less advanced mechanics. I can make an expansive trade network with vast exports, but again I am hampered with less options than I expected, plus there are no happy caravans trodding about. This... knuckle-rapping continues throughout the game.

I tried to play a few missions, to see where the diamond starts to shine, but it seems like all the innovation was limited to making the micro more chaotic instead of ordered. For instance, while the workers may choose to live where-ever, they get tired, and when they get tired they go home to sleep. I do not find this a needed mechanic to a Caesar-clone, especially when the effect of tiredness doesn't either affect that much or I just like to build workplaces close to home. 

In the end, I can't recommend this game. It is not the amount of effort, it is not the underlying mechanic, it is not the game itself, apart from the half-done copypasting. It is simply the fact that you may buy Caesar III for some 6 euros, and that one will give you way more bang for your buck than putting 15€ to Empire Architect.",1536788643,1536788643,False,11,1,0.626298367977142334,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Se encuentra todavía en desarrollo, pero tiene un creador entregado a la tarea y dispuesto a añadir cosas a la vieja fórmula de los Caesar, sin perder el aire retro a los años 90.

 Empire Architect lleva desde octubre de 2017 en Steam y ha sido creado por Batholith Entertainment, una empresa indie de un solo desarrollador, Chris McAulay, que se ha lanzado al mundo de los videojuegos dispuesto a renovar un clásico. Su inspiración principal es la mítica Saga Caesar y a primera vista parece un calco con gráficos viejunos. Pero según se va jugando, se descubren importantes diferencias, todas a mejor (a pesar de los gráficos).

El juego se puede jugar a nivel campaña, que por ahora tiene 11 niveles y es muy semejante a la campaña de los Caesar , o en modo sandbox, donde se manifiesta en todo su esplendor.

  Los mapas en Empire Architect son procedurales, esa es la primera diferencia con los Caesar, y en cada uno se puede desarrollar, si quieres, más de una ciudad, aparte de la tuya. Sí, puedes tener vecinos de la IA y jugar contra ellos. En esto se parece al Age of Empires. Pero no hay multiplayer y el ritmo de juego es mucho más lento, más centrado en el desarrollo urbano que en quien fabrica más rápido un ejército para acabar con los demás. Pero, bueno, si los puedes conquistar, mucho mejor.

 Hay cadenas de producción de materiales y productos manufacturados en mayor número que en el Caesar. Por lo que hay más variedad de recursos. Los edificios públicos  no necesitan estar pegados a una calle para funcionar, como en el Caesar III. Tienen un rango de influencia, que se puede incrementar si añades mármol a la construcción.

 Hay un árbol tecnológico, en el cual se van desarrollando ventajas, como que los arqueros tengan más alcance, los carros de transporte aumenten su velocidad o que los trabajadores de manufacturas sean más productivos. El desarrollador va añadiendo más avances en cada actualización.

 Las casas de los ciudadanos tienen hasta 3 niveles, que no suben de forma automática cuando se alcanza lo necesario para ello, sino que es el jugador el que tiene la opción de hacerlo. Así se tiene más control a la hora de crear zonas patricias y pobres en la ciudad. Por ejemplo, quizá no interesa subir de nivel determinadas casas cerca de las granjas, ya que si sus habitantes suben de nivel ya no trabajaran en ellas. De esta manera, puedes crear barrios pobres y lujosos a voluntad, en un proceso bastante realista.

 Por otra parte, los ciudadanos son más reales, necesitan descansar y pierden tiempo yendo y viniendo de casa, no se está todo el tiempo produciendo al mismo ritmo o trabajando en el curro como robots. Así que los recursos no crecen de forma continua. Hay molestos parones. Los ciudadanos también tienen deseos y necesidades inmediatas, que debemos intentar cumplir sin dejar pensar en el conjunto. Hay algunos ciudadanos cuyos deseos siempre se quedarán sin cumplir, por mucho que sueñen con ellos, porque han nacido pobres y es su triste y conveniente (para ti) destino. Pero no debemos descuidar la felicidad general, que es un aspecto básico para que la ciudad funcione.

El número de edificios públicos y sus nombres son similares a los de la saga Caesar, aunque hay algunos nuevos y muy interesantes, como la casa de juego de dados, para entretener un poco a la gente, o la ceca de moneda, que viene muy bien para aumentar el dinero.

 Por supuesto, también podemos establecer rutas comerciales con otras ciudades y sacar buenos beneficios de nuestra producción. Pero siempre dejando algo para el emperador, pues como buen juego inspirado en la saga Caesar, en Empire Architect también tenemos que sufrir sus pesadas peticiones y sus amenazas.

 En definitiva, un juego de aspecto simple y retro, pero profundo de mecánicas, al que en la última actualización acaban de añadir pantallas de estadísticas, para que podamos controlar de una manera más clara los efectos de nuestras decisiones. 
 Para nostálgicos de la saga Caesar es casi obligatorio, porque sigue su modelo y añade nuevas e interesantes opciones. Además, está en español. Lo que es todo un detalle.

I am sorry you have had trouble with the game. If you can provide me with your windows crash files I will work to fix whatever crashed the game.

Here is a guide on how to get your crash logs:

On top of that I am very open to ideas on how to improve the interface. Is there something specific that would make it easier to figure out the happiness mechanic? Currently the tooltip when hovering over the top bat lets you know what the biggest issues in your city are, and the overlays show you where exactly thoses issues exist in your city...

Edit: I found a crash (it had to do with the latest patch), and hot fixed it. I cant be sure that it is the same crash you had without your logs... But at the very least I have fixed 1 I could find..."

Just a quick description for people who might not know of the impressions city builder sub-genre, while this is not a pure descendent (like ""Lethis Path of Progress"" is) it shows it's inspiration on it's sleeves enough that I should describe it.
You build a city by plotting the flow of resources, the intake and outtake of goods, and balance what is best for the gods, the empire, and your city. The tools at your disposal are trade, infrastructure, wellfare, and worse comes to worse warfare.

With that in mind I will not presume that you have a decent enough idea of what to expect from a traditional impressions game, so now on to how well this game follows the old greats, and how it differentiates itself from them.

1) First and foremost there is no walker system.
For those who don't know you can skip this part but for others this could be important.
While people still move services and goods around, the old walker mechanics are not being used here.
The pros of this is of course less management of who can walk where.
The cons are more about how this was implemented rather than the actual mechanic ""removed"".
Leveling up houses is now a button you can click on the houses themselves.
This does provide more control over how fast the city advances in its demands, but it also removes both the enjoyment of just sitting back and watching the houses flourish in response to your hard work (rather than as more work for you to do) and the extra challenge and uncontrolled population provides (though this might be for the best with other changes).
Lastly I have found little to no point in leveling up the houses, since the higher levels require more luxuries for an improvement of a single extra population being housed and people might decide not to move into the higher level house if there job isn't high ranking enough, meaning in several of my games I had whole blocks of houses with only half or less occupancy because the workers in my clay pit industry wanted shacks rather than cottages to live in.

2) There are multiple cities on a single map.
For those who haven't played any previous impressions game, while there would be other cities for you to trade and defend/invade only your city would be represented in the main game window, the others were dots on maps that little indianna jones styled blobs would go back and forth from.
The only game that gets close to what ""Empire Architect"" does is ""Grand Ages: Rome"", and what they did was have single large buildings represent entire cities while your city consisted of ever expanding roads and buildings.
I have great hopes for this new idea, hopefully with more interaction between the two or more cities than throwing blobs of troops at each other or changes in what you can trade.

3) Multiple Factions
This is not implemented yet, but it is something that could make a very big difference down the line.
City Building games in this resource centered vein live and die by how complex and interconnected the production lines behave and interact, and while ""Empire Architect"" how already shown it knows what it is doing in this regard, balancing multiple factions will be an interesting challenge to engage with.

4) While there is not a mass of content yet, there is enough to gauge how well it deals with the standards set by the impression's series of games.
Housing and population management is handled very well, with entertainment and religious buildings showing both their maximum and current radius of effect, a handy counter that shows your current population and current unemployed population, and the ability to open or close individual jobs within each building.
I just wish a better explanation of the wage system could be provided, since instead of wages being applied to all jobs equally, either each type of job, or each type of job within a single building have their wages managed as a grouping.

In desperate need of a UX designer and a good artist.
Generic ""citizens"". No names. No women. Only defining traits are education level and job. No facing the issues of actual social inequality (slaves vs free vs citizens) in the setting.
Generic farms. One of the interesting aspects of Emperor etc is the varying planting and harvest seasons for different crops (which have varying availability in different maps).
No variable speed, though it does at least have playable pause.
No information on what various blessings/curses do, that I spotted.

I've not been sucked in, and I haven't spotted any particularly interesting aspects.

Edit to add more details:
UI/UX/art issues I noticed included the inconsistency of button style and positioning; difficulty guessing which category a particular building would be found in; being forced to place a single house at a time; being unable to draw new roads if they overlapped old roads; and buildings that look about to fall over. I do appreciate that there are overlays, and that the happiness score hover text gives information on what's causing unhappiness.

While I don't expect women to be equal to men (Ancient Rome, after all!), I do expect them to be present in some way, shape, or form; and it is quite disappointing to be able to look at individual workers and not see any personality. Having played many different city builders, I've seen this handled in many ways:
- Glory of the Roman Empire specifies which gender can work at any given job, with some jobs (such as tavern server) being exclusively female and others (such as miners) being exclusively male. This is also the only city builder game that I remember engaging significantly with the fact that Rome also had slavery, with slaves being the primary means of transporting materials around town.
- Cultures assigns women the role of having babies and making the men happy. This amounts to essentially population growth and productivity bonuses.
- Children of the Nile also tracks lineage and family history, with men generally doing work and women generally doing the household shopping.
- Emperor/Pharaoh/Zeus do the least. They don't track individuals at all - but it is notable that the normal employment rate is only around 30% of total population.",1508361351,1508815235,False,7,1,0.438130110502243042,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I have always loved the city building and resource management category and have been waiting for a game like this for a long time.  I had really gotten into Banished but felt there was still a small part missing.  As much as I liked playing, I really missed having a military component.  Even just a minor one, I don't mean Total War military stuff, just something to keep me on my toes.  I've searched and searched and never was really able to scratch that itch...until now.  Empire Architect is a perfect mix of resource control, city building and a touch of military necessity to make it exactly what I've been looking for!

The campaign mode is really a perfect tutorial to get you to understand the basics and I immediately won my first custom game utilizing what I learned in the campaign mode.  Granted, I played on ""Easy"" to start, but now i feel confident to try the other difficulty levels knowing what I know now.

I know the campaign is short right now but the multiple difficulty levels and the custom game feature have enough options to keep me playing.  It does seem very clear that the developer is highly motivated to continue adding and patching which tells me my $12 was well spent.  I've certainly spent a lot more on way worse stuff.

In summary, if you like city building, resource management, and having a basic military, then this is the game for you.

So far, my only real complaint is that I would love to have more information on the UI, like the ratio at which each building produces each resource and such.

Die Spielidee ist gut und gefällt mir, allerdings gibt es noch viele Bugs deshalb verstehe ich nicht warum man bereits den Early Access Status verlassen hat. Die guten Brunnen funktionieren nicht (geben kein Wasser), die Aqädukte zusammen mit den Wasserspeichern haben aktuell wohl auch noch keine Funktion. Wenn man Aqädukte abreißt bleiben kleine Teile dieses im Bildschirm stehen und veschwinden nicht. Das Spiel ist bei mir innerhalb dieser knappen Stunde 2x abgestürtzt ohne Fehlermeldung. Aber ich möchte nicht alles schlecht reden, der Entwickler scheint das echt mit Liebe zusammengecodet zu haben, die Grafik ist sehr sehr schlicht aber dennoch liebevoll gestaltet. Die Sounds funktionieren zweckmäßig, ein wenig mehr Musikauswahl wäre nicht schlecht aber das ist kein Kritikpunkt. Das Gameplay erinnert an eine langsamere aber auch komplexere Form von Age of Empires. Man fängt an Hütten für seine Bewohner zu bauen und muss Bauerhöfe errichten um Nahrung zu produzieren und Märkte bauen um die Nahrung an die Bevölkerung zu bringen. Mit Brunnen errichtet man eine Wasserversorgung für die Bürger. Man muss auf die Bevölkerungsstatistik achten da es auch nur begrenzte Arbeitsplätze bzw. nur begrenzte Arbeiter gibt. Man errichtet Theater für die Unterhaltung des Volkes und Tempel um die Religionszufriedenheit hoch zu halten, Schulen werden auch benötigt um gebildete Arbeiter bzw. Einwohner zu erhalten mit denen man wiederum neue Gebäude nutzen kann. Später kann man dann auch Armeen rekrutieren und kämpfen allerdings bin ich soweit noch nicht gekommen (der Ausbau des Reiches scheint im Vordergrund zu stehen und der Krieg ist eher im Endgame wichtig). Es macht trotz den Bugs Spaß sein Reich aufzubauen und ich habe Lust auf mehr bekommen. Ich bin sehr gespannt wie sich dieses Spiel weiter entwicklen wird und gebe trotz der noch vielen Bugs eine bewusst positive Bewertung da ich denke in diesem Spiel steckt noch eine Menge Potenzial.

To go over my negative review: 

Citizens always starving, but large stocks of food: You need to better place your buildings. If you go to the discussion forum there is a guide on my post ""starving"" from the developer. This will fix your problem.

People don't move in to level 2 homes: You cannot force them in to level 2 homes, they have to desire it first. This simulates a class structure.

At the moment there are two modes available: custom game, which is a skirmish mode in heart, with four difficulty levels and procedurally generated maps; and campaign, which already has enough levels to teach you how to play and show you some strategies. Even if the game is not on Early Access anymore, more content is still beign added, so there's more to come.

The gameplay is based on keep your population happy by providing food, education, jobs, entertainment, religion and security, while you try to defeat your opponents with your army. Don’t worry, Empire Architect is a game where your APM (actions per minute) won't matter – you can play in your own time, and the units are independent, which means you don’t need to control them. This allows for a more strategic approach, where what matters are the choices you will make about what to build next based on what your population needs at the moment, what to research, and think about efficient ways to deal with logistics for an optimized city. 

It’s worth mentioning that the developer of this game is working hard to create a fun experience and fix occasional bugs, and I’ve seen a lot of bugs fixed on the same day the community reported them. Also, the game is already well optimized, with an almost nonexistent loading screen and no fps drops. 

To summarize, Empire Architect is worth playing if you’re a strategy lover and want some new ideas inspired by the relatively recent grand strategy genre. Your input can make a difference about features and mechanics, so if you want to help build the future of the game, join the community and don’t be shy to share some ideas on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/593490/discussions/]forums[/url].",1503669453,1507378437,True,50,2,0.769053041934967041,10,True,False,False,False,,,

Checking zone coverage only works for Religion and it is far too low in coverage.
No explanation as to why area is undesirable.
Trading menu really needs work, it is a guessing game 90% of the time so it must be dealt with in order for pleasant gaming.
No option to play without AI.

No quiero, pero no puedo... No quiero ser malo con él/los Devs que están llevando a cabo este juego, o al menos intento de, porque se lo que es hacer un juego, sé las horas y el esfuerzo detrás de todo el desarrollo, el amor... Pero realmente es más fuerte que yo... No tengo idea como juegos en este estado pueden incluso estar en Early Access, está mínimamente lejos de ser un Early Access. Entiendo que Steam no pone condiciones ni hace mucho control de calidad de su plataforma, pero al menos, mínimamente, tener un poco de consideración y amor por uno mismo al presentar algo en este estado.

Dejemos de lado que el juego está en Early Access, y que uno al comprar un Early Access entiende que el estado del juego puede ser inconcluso... me comi varios juegos que quedaron en la nada y extremadamente lejos de poder pedir un refund. Pero esto... Esto es algo que realmente me rompe el corazón. Las ganas están, se lo puede ver al dev demasiado activo en los foros, pero la necesidad de facturar va más allá de todo... Y en mi humilde opinión, JAMAS podria haber sacado un juego en este estado. Creo que alguien que sienta que es gamer y hace un juego, quiere que su producto mínimamente sea potable, jugable, entretenido... Bueno nada de todo eso pasa aca.

A ver, dicho lo que ya está dicho, porque digo lo que digo... Bueno, el juego es un city builder, pero está extremadamente  lejos de llegar a 1/4 de lo que podía ser Caesar 3 o Pharaon, muy lejos y pasaron algo asi como 20 años. Pero no es 100% un city builder, sino más bien un intento de mezclar un city builder con un AoE... Ok, la idea no es mala. PERO, la ejecución hasta el momento es paupérrima. Es decir, si tenes ganas de jugar a un juego totalmente incompleto, sentirte el Indiana Jones de los fichines intentando comprender cómo funciona el juego, y sentirte EL Hiper Alpha Tester de los juegos del mundo mundial, entonces este juego es para vos...

No voy a pedir el refund, si bien podría, porque entiendo que el dev le pone tanto amor que quiere seguir con su proyecto y yo también quiero que haga un buen juego... pero por favor, existe Kickstarter para financiarse la vida si tenes una buena idea y la podes ejecutar. ¿Pero así? Lanzando un ""juego"" en este estado, definitivamente no da.

En definitiva, si queres ayudar al dev a hacer de este juego un buen juego, compralo. Si queres JUGAR a algo decente, entonces te puedo recomendar 100 Early Access mejores que este por 10 Dólares. 

Le deseo mucha suerte al dev, y que le vaya de mejor en mejor en las proximas versiónes.

PD: No suelo hacer analisis negativos, si el juego no me gustó directamente lo abandono en la libreria, ni me gasto en hacer un analisis. Pero entre las ganas del dev y el pesimo producto que presentó, consideré que valia la pena escribir sobre esto.

Steuereintreiber werden gebraucht, Architekten die die Gebäude in Schuss halten und Soldaten um eure Siedlung zu verteidigen.

Am Anfang sucht man sich einen schicken Bauplatz, Rohstoffe wie Holz, Lehm, Kupfer und Eisen werden benötigt.
Man errichtet Foren, Marktplätze, Handelsplätze und Rohstoff verarbeitende Betriebe.

The game play itself is fairly short, each AI adds roughly 20-30 minutes to game and has this huge difficulty curve as soon as they get their armies going. 

It's not really fair to call this game a city builder, though it certainly has the early stages of those elements. It's more like an easy version of Age of Empires only with one unit type. I went in expecting Ceasar and though the game didn't measure up with my expectations of what i thought it was, I was pleasantly surprised with the game.

The game is very much in it's early stages of development and the developper is actively fixing bugs and adding new content. Normally, I'd wait until the game is a bit more mature before purchasing an early access game, but I think this is one of those games that I will enjoy watching it grow.",1495827889,1495827889,True,10,0,0.535708129405975342,0,True,False,True,False,,,
