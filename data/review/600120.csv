A first impressions of the game and some background information above. This is your fairly standard 2D pixel art grinder that' relies on the player to discover and formulate much of the in-game lore and story. The game is fairly well-balanced, there's a lot of items to craft, and the regions are coherent. The small playerbase is friendly and helpful, albeit the active daily player count is very, very low.

Life Forge doesn't do anything impressively, nor are there any glaring flaws. A lot of care was taken to construct a coherent map and universe with a fair amount of variety and appropriate difficulty scaling for dungeons and open world areas. Much like another game I played recently (Mystica: The Ninth Society), it suffers from lack of developer resources to create a steady stream of new content to appease the existing playerbase.

I didn't play very long, to level 6 I think... The graphics are stellar, and I really like when your character actually displays the equipment they are wearing, but there are just WAY too many quality of life issues...

1.) Every time I launch the game it thinks it needs to install the DLLs again...

2.) Walking is painfully slow... And then you get overencumbered when half your tiny inventory is full (and then you're REALLY slow) - [b]Suggestion: Make walking FAST, and don't include an overencumbered effect!!!! :D[/b]

3.) Inventory is a joke. It's tiny and there are stacking issues... (i.e., bronze swords stack (!?) but logs and ore doesn't...) You want to get 10 logs and 10 ore in one run? That'll take up half your inventory space AND you'll be overencumbered! :D [b]Suggestion: Make the inventory bigger and make things stackable. Yes, I'm down to farm 500 copper ore in one trip, which takes up ONE slot of my large inventory, without being punished with super slow trudging back to camp.[/b] I completely understand that a person hauling around 500 ore without slowing down is unrealistic. There was this really popular MMO where you could walk around with 1000 flying mounts in your pocket, and spawn them at will. Nobody complained! :D

4.) Combat. Fuuuuuuuuuuu -- Sorry, but it's terrible (at least for Melee). If something runs up to you and starts hitting you, you have to manually target it, then manually face it, then manually spam basic attack... [b]Suggestion: Auto basic attack at least. Auto face targeted mob. Auto target attacking aggressive mob with lowest HP.[/b]

5.) Tools... You literally have to equip the right tool for every f thing you do. See a tree? open inventory, switch to axe, chop tree. Ohh, ore right next to it? Inventory, switch to pick, you get the idea. I realize this may be common for this type of game (?). [b]Suggestion: Let me just use the tool if it's in my inventory without manually equipping it.[/b]

We don't sell, anywhere, any Exp/Skill/Resource potion. They're given, for free, for logging in as a daily reward.
A level ~50 is not equipped nor should be anywhere near the current level 80-90 areas or bosses. You will just die.
Resources spawn at a fair rate, unless there has been a huge error, there is no way it took you 30 hours to obtain 3 ores. The current end game has a respawn timer of 10 minutes, and if you don't take into account the random bonus of +1 ore, that's 30 minutes to get 3 ores of current end game resources.

Reading your review for a second time, it honestly looks like you jumped tiers and I can only assume you and a group attempted to take on bosses way out of your level. You mention end game but you're 40 levels from current end game levels/items/bosses, which would make you a very easy target for bosses to instantly wipe. As a level 52 you should not be taking on level 90-110 bosses even with a max party of other level 42-62's.

It is very similar in nature to other top-down pixel style RPG's however it adds in an MMO mechanic that otherwise doesn't exist in some other games. While I enjoyed the game at first, over time I have come to feel that the developers are not objective to what it is that they do, the timing in which they do it, and the people whom they do it too.

My first example will be daily logins. For months you would be able to login and get daily login rewards on your character over a 7 day streak. At the end of day 6 / 7 you would get an in-game currency called 'Platinum' that can then be spent for unique transformations, morphs, mounts etc. however Platinum can also be bought with $$$. What occurred was that individuals took advantage of that system, creating several characters so that they were pulling in 100's of plat a month. This of course saturated the Platinum market, however instead of simply punishing the players whom took advantage of this loop-hole, the developers turn off daily logins all together - and then re-activate however you are only allowed to get the dailies once per IP. Reasonable solution in my eyes, however this does not punish those whom have already taken advantage. Instead they opted to raise the prices on all platinum purchases, with some items costing 250+ platinum; with the response of ""It's a bonus item, its not needed; price does not matter"" Essentially negating the possibility that anyone who plays for free (250 platinum, you get 7 platinum a week from logins...) would be able to get any of these items.

It's not pay to win, but if you want some of the cool stuff they are releasing you sure as hell have to pay. Otherwise the only people who will get any of the new items released by developers are those who spend tons of $$$, take advantage of the system, or are privvy to information from the developers so that they can prepare for when things are released.

Another example would be the most recent halloween event, in which PAST halloween (11/02/17)  a new halloween boss was released for a period of 8 hours (During the night while people are sleeping), which then dropped Platinum shop items! But nobody would have been online to farm this boss on release unless they KNEW it would be dropping on a Friday night for a period of 8 hours. So again those who were privvy to information or 'buddy buddy' with developers were able to better prepare and take advantage of a situation. Yet again placing items into the hands of the SAME PEOPLE, so that 3-4 people within the game have nearly anything worthwhile making the market unstable, unreliable, and overall the game just not enjoyable. The logical timing for this event would have been the night of Halloween (10/31/17), instead they delay it several days and drop it randomly in the night time; no day-to-day player would have known this. However there are 3-4 people who farmed it the entire 8 hours and I am sure got a plethora of platinum shop items. 

Final example will be the 3 hours of time that I (and a group of 6+) wasted on a recent raid release, only for the developers to DELETE the loot table so that items would not drop as we fought the boss. All because we were playing the game AS IT WAS DESIGNED, and were punished for utilizing what was available to us as players. Instead of correcting it and then speaking to that person they just made it so nobody got any loot. So 7 individuals had 3 hours of raid time completely negated, because the Developers thought it would be fun to exercise their 'power' and make it so nobody got loot. Overall, I must say I am disappointed in the way the developers present themselves, and the way that they isolate players due to their preferential treatment.

If you are looking to play solo and play from time to time, this game will entertain you for a week or two. However if you are looking for something a little more serious that will provide you a good community experience in which the gameplay is set fairly for all, with none getting advantages or preferental treatment, then this would not be for you.

Favorite part about this game right now is the community, The developers are super active, and generaly take interest in players opinions and ideas about how to better the game. Although if your rude don't expect much love.

There's no Pay to win, either. There is nothing you can buy for Money, thats going to make you more prepared for end game content. It can however make early game a Tad bit easier to buy a mount with good hp. However around level 45 your able to grind for one of the Highest HP mounts in the game.

I would most definitely recommend this game, to people who enjoy games Like runescape/maplestory/diablo.

-Pros-
-Very simple yet complicated at the same time, it doesnt hold your hand, which people who have to be spoon fed won't appreciate. 
-Content is still being added, I think this week or next week the level cap is being raised and new areas are going to be added. 
-Good music. 
-No Map so exploring is fun.
-4 classes with 3 subclasses, Gameplay changes with each class.
-Crafting with very little hand holding.
-Bosses and raid areas! Some Bosses you can solo at the bosses level if you manage your skills right, others (raid bosses) you will have an issue trying to solo at max level (70) boss level (40).
-Secret areas and bosses, no hand holding on finding these areas, but the community is awesome and always ready to help!
-Graphics are simple, and the style I like! Some are good, some are bad (Palm tress in desert), but that just makes me want to fix them and resubmit them, which is another Pro in itself!
-Awesome Community! I saw someone wrote a review talking about the forums. I've never used the forums, they have a very active well organized discored channel and any and all of you questions can be answered there.
-THE GRIND! If you want to level something, Life skills (crafting) or your character, be a man about it and grind it out!
-Devs are around on discord and in game daily. If you need something, shoot them a private message and they will help you out the best they can, some Devs more than others.

-Cons-
-Still Alpha, so there are bugs.
-I can't seem to get full screen to work. See previous Con.
-1 toon per account, if you want to make alts you need a seperate login.
-Advertised that there is a Wiki page, I beleave its fan content submitted, and its very out of date, you can use it in game but it's frusturating.
- 4 servers, most I've seen on I think was 17, and that was when I got on after it told me servers were full. Other 3 servers had 0 players online.

-Other Info- (can't think of any more Cons lol)
-Walking is slow, but their are mounts which you can fight on, and I would recommend it as mounts have health and don't die. When their health reaches 0, it dismounts you and you have to wait 3 minutes before remounting. you get your first mount for cheap and very early.
-Players constantly bless the server (cash shop item, 2x EXP for everyone on the server)
-Controls take a little to get used to.

Prós:
 - Jogo complementamente feito a mão, nada de rpg maker.
 - Muitos equipamentos bons podem ser craftados, (Lendários, Epicos etc).
 - As 4 Classes principais possuem 3 Sub-Classes em geral  primeira classe de ataque, segunda hibrida, terceira tanker.
 - Muitas montarias podem ser adquiridas Gratuitamente dentro do jogo.
 - Alpha, da para acompanhar a evolução do jogo tranquilamente.
 - Se tornar um membro é relativamente barato.

Contras:
 - Melhores montarias estão disponiveis apenas para os membros, porém para os brasileiros já sabem 2.5x o valor.
 - Grinding para upar tem saltos impressionantes.
 - Upar habilidades de craft se torna incrivelmente irritante, horas e horas, e as areas são repletas de mobs irritantes.
 - O craft não segue o mesmo nivel do drop, atualmente é possivel fabricar itens do Nv 60 e dropar (Somente em partys) itens do Nv 70.
 - Não é possivel jogar solo, a não ser que se conforme em comprar e ficar com os piores itens que outros players vendem, afinal os melhores geralmente ficam nas derivadas guilds.
 - Classes desbalanceadas, os produtores estão tentando corrigir porém não parece estar dando muito certo.
 - O pior de todos, Lag, a cada ""otimização da rede"" nada resolve, e a morte por lag é a mais dolorosa, afinal a morte é penalizada com uma determinada % em Xp aqui.

Todos os contras são compreensiveis a partir de que o jogo se encontra em Alpha, mas não o recomendo por causa do Lag, se com 20 e poucos jogadores está assim imagine posteriormente, até mesmo os americanos que se encontram mais próximos do servidor reclaman de lag.",1503345369,1503345369,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Минусы:

-Персонаж очень медленный и им не удобно управлять,поэтому некоторых монстров вообще не ударить,даже если пытаться. И в некоторых случаях монстры тебя бьют,а тебе не развернуться,чтобы хоть как то защититься.

Despite the fact steam integration is so easy every other quickly hashed out game implements it no problem.)

It's painfully clear if you see the progression of the game in real time- From it's original incarnation to it's ""Steam launch"" That no real passion is here and no grand design or desire is put forth to further the game. 

Mappers and lord knows what other fragments of the overall ""Team"" are not directly in communication with each other nor the ""Main"" developers and vice versa- Including an admission of one during a stream that they had no idea what any other mapper was doing or working on as they were in the process of making a map. And lamented that their requests for improvements for their mapping tools from said devs were left unanswered- Surprise surprise, meaning that new maps and content take longer to create and deploy.


Since I've whinged on about how the game is handled- Let's talk about the game itself.

It's plagued by lazy primative copy/paste/recolor content from gear/crafting to maps that are X amount of the same tile with color variances. Anything that isn't a ""unique"" piece of gear (The items of said numbering in the low dozen at best) is a tick up in stats and a color shift to match the color of the materials used to make it.

Mechanics that are either broken outright or obfuscated so heavily they might as well be invisible- Defense in this game is broken, and as small of a difference as 5 points can mean that at certain areas or VS certain mobs you go from eating 3 shots to being invincible- Until a random one shot happens because ???

Skills and classes are also outright broken.   Classes and their associated subclasses have different stat scaling percentage values and or damage increases/decreases.. These are however literally invisible unmarked values that you can only find out by being lucky and asking a developer or a player who has spoken to a developer directly- So you start off nice and blind even if you made an educated choice.

  Notably physical damage classes largely have worthless skills with poor stat scaling and as you hit middling levels- Your auto swings will easily outpace them even when level capped (A process accomplished by mindlessly spamming them until a times used value fills and it blips to the next rank, maxxing out at 3.)

And a goodly half of them don't have enough unique skills (And share enough skills) that there's little difference between some subclasses.  With maybe two tops being major departures from their base class at best out of a list of around 9 classes.


And there is simply not much to do and hardly any content besides mindless grind over what amounts to a single digits worth of zones and no, I'm not feeling generous enough to count submaps in said zones.

 That good will was long ago spent by the team behind the game.

It could have been a fun little comfy sandbox RPG- But an utter lack of direction, drive and general incompetence makes it not so.

Llevo 52.1 h en 5 días de juego, y creo que esto habla por si solo de lo enviciante que puede llegar a ser.
El juego tiene 3 componentes trascendentales que debes ir desarrollando a lo largo del juego, y estos son:
1. La recolección de recursos 
2. El crafteo de equipamento
3. Subir de nivel las habilidades.

1. La recolección de recursos: Cada diez niveles se abre un nuevo Tier de equipamento para cada una de las 3 clases, que progresivamente requiere de la recolección de recursos de más alto nivel como minerales, pieles y plantas. Por lo que para poder craftear equipamento de niveles más alto, se convierte casi que en una obligación la recolección de recursos.
Por este aspecto, la dificultad del juego y la extensión del tiempo de juego requerido para avanzar, es mayor.

2. El crafteo de equipamento: Funciona de manera análoga a la recolección de recursos, existen 4 tipos de crafteo, para diferentes tipos de equipamento, por lo que para craftear un equipamento de un nivel alto, requerirás un nivel alto de crafteo en la respectiva estación.

3. Subir de nivel las habilidades: Tiene una mecánica un tanto particular en cuanto a la manera en la que se consigue la mejora de las habilidades, en un principio se cuentan con pocas habilidades, pero cuando se adquiere la sub-clase, se extiende una nueva gama de habilidades; ahora bien, la manera en la que se sube de nivel una habilidad es con el uso frecuente de esta, por ejemplo, una habilidad requiere 100 usos para subir a nivel 2, y a la vez tiene un tiempo de enfriamiento de 10 sec, por lo que subir esta habilidad a nivel 2, tendrás que usarla 100 veces y esto tardará un buen tiempo. una habilidad en nivel 1 que hacía 600 daño, en nivel 3 que es el máximo, puede llegar a hacer 2000. así que es algo que vale la pena.

Todo esto y su mecánica de pérdida de exp cuando se muere y dropeo de algunos objetos del inventario, lo hace un juego fenomenal, lleno de retos y creado para personas que no se dejan apabullar por la dificultad.
No se asusten si en un principio el juego avanza un poco lento, posteriormente con las monturas todo se hace más rápido, anímense a jugar, el juego está comenzando y tiene gran potencial.

Normally I do not mind grinding, going back to vailla WoW days and farming absolutely ridiculous crap for miniscule gain... I was that guy.  But this game genuinely lacks a story, and really isn't all that it's advertised, and the community is just so awful.  

This game is insanely grindy.  It's not fun, it's not even tedious, but in order to level, you have to kill a ridiculous amount of trash mobs in the same room.  This is how you level, nearly every level, for 55 levels.  If someone else is farming the same mobs trying to level, they cannot be invited into a party if there is greater than a 5 level gap, which means you should find something else to play if the person is farming for items.  

It's currently impossible to ignore new players, and boy do they get annoying.  Not everyone speaks the same language, so you will end up with someone asking about the game and literally no one speaks Brasilian.  Others are readily available to help, but those people are usually the level 55s, and they are farming the bosses in game for loot to sell, and are not your friends.  I had one demand that I give him the items which dropped for me and my partner because he hit the boss a couple of times, but we had killed that boss several times before, so his help was unneeded.  Regardless, he had been helpful with advice, so I traded him the items, despite me really having a use for one.  I asked if he wanted to trade for it, and the cost of getting my drop back was exorbitant, how silly of me.  One item even goes for 5 million gold, which is outlandish and insane.  The level 55s run the show and make the game miserable for others, all for the sake of gold, which at the top tier is meaningless.  So what we have is a game that is so blatantly unbalanaced that the top people play it for petty gain which prevents others from playing the game for personal enjoyment, and that is how this game is designed.

Server lag is atrocious, sometimes with 3 second freezes, resulting in you not knowing how you died, since mobs can spawn on your square and attack instantaneously.  

Quests require a certain level to do, even if you slaughtered 50 of those same monsters prior to leveling, you cannot accept said quest until you are the proper level.  

There is no roleplaying in this game.  There are no heroes or villains, just cutthroats and exploiters.  The lack of customization shocks me as to how this game can even advertise any level of roleplaying.  There are no choices to make.  It simply does not exist.  

Character classes are completely broken and imbalanced.  Some are worthless, and others are beyond meta.  

TL;DR this game is for the people who have already been playing it, not you.  28 hours in and I realize it is nothing like advertised, and being an early release Alpha does NOT explain the lack of advertised content, which I see no way to add without overhauling the game.  You will be preyed upon by other players.  You will die to unavoidable server issues.  You will not be roleplaying.  You will be killing thousands of the same mobs in order to level, and you will never roleplay in any action that you take.  I will never recommend this game, nor will I play it again.",1496994706,1496994706,False,34,0,0.765517055988311768,3,False,False,True,False,,,

It's satisfying to level your skills(although repetitive and tedious at times) and the crafting system is easy to use/ really easy to pick up on.

I've also managed to level my other skills quite a bit, let me explain what some of them are. One of them is the mining skill. With this skill, as you level it, you'll be able to mine different kinds of ore, the first being copper, and second iron(I'm not sure of others, when I find them I shall add them into this review). The other skills are basically the same, in the way of progression as you level the skill. Fish to get more fishing areas, cook to cook more food, build armor to build even more armor, etc...

   An added bonus to the game is the graphics. I'm a sucker for pixel graphics and this game satisfys my pixely needs perfectly. I'd highly recommend this game, but make sure to have some people to talk to/ some music to listen to, because it can feel quite lonely at times.

P.S. If you're feeling lost, ask the global chat for help. They're all incredibly helpful and will most likely answer any questions you have.

(For now that is all, I'll update this review as I get further into the game, but for now, it's fuckin' 2:00am and I need sleep lol)

EDIT: I'm now level 20 and have all dunestone gear, but I'm lazy and don't want to edit the review, so let me sum up the next nine hours of playing Life Forge.

    When I got back on, I started farming herbs(which I had no reason to farm what so ever, besides the EXP from the plants, RIP 3 hours.) once I was done with those, I started mining dunestone for when I reach level 20, which was a VERY good idea, and helped me level more then killing the monsters would have. Let me just cut to the chase.

Pros(as of this far):
-There's TONS of content, and as I've walked around the max level seems to be 55, and for skills I've maxed some of them at level 3. 
-The communtiy is really helpful. Ask a question, you'll get an answer. 
-If you don't have anything to do, and need to waste time, this game is for you. 
-There are multi-class spells.

Cons-
-There's no easy way to track friends/ no friend system whatsoever.
-Walking. If your horse dies(after you grind gold for the first tier, 2,500 gold/ second tier 3,500 gold and three different colors), it's walking simulator. 
-Leveling your skills(Mining, Fishing, Wood Cutting, etc...) takes FOREVER, without the right equipment. Make sure to talk to people/listen to music or you'll get bored of this game FAST.
-People can be arseholes. For example, leading a horde of enemies to you when you're 5 levels under the required level in an area, I'm talking to you LEO.

That's it for now, I'll add on once I get the motivation to do so.",1495949129,1496024034,True,13,0,0.609558165073394775,0,False,False,True,False,,,

However game itself gives me idea Legend of Zelda first one where your facing lot of interesting mysteries. If only I had controller it be bit quicker to play... oh well.

Grouping is non existent at the moment, because quest advancement cannot be shared, thus making grouping useless.

There are multiple classes and multiple choices between class advancement, making you have more choice, which is nice.

The muscic is good, especially the song at the very beginning on the beach, which has a reggae feel about it.

There is a crafting system but right now its very simplistic mindless and grindy.

Overall view:If you like mindless grinding then this is the game for you, but i wold recommend  waiting it out till more stuff comes in and playing other games.Guild wars 2 is my recommendation, or runescape over this game.Both games offer more complexicty and involvement.At least the service is good.",1495750515,1495750711,False,13,1,0.56145477294921875,1,False,False,True,False,,,

If I have to mention some things that are negative, i would say the Enforcement of Rules are too lacking, hence people violate the rules are not punishes despite the fact that it was stated ""NO TOLERANCE"" 
Also, some gears doesn't make sense at all, such as 2h wep has lower DPS than 1h wep, and makes it an unviable option. Some are glitchy/buggy (because it's alpha its bound to be)

There are no longer open PvP zones before lvl 40 and I've yet to see complaints about PK griefing since I started playing this game a few days ago. With that being said... let's move on to the actual review.

I started playing this game about 2 days ago and I'm already addicted. If you're into old-school 2D MMOs and don't mind a rewarding grind, this game is worth a shot.

PROS:
- Active developpers, very involved with the community. They have a discord setup where they engage with the players and are open to suggestions and feedback.
- Lovely community. The global chat is generally friendly and older players helpful and welcoming with the new arrivals like myself.
- The game's pixel art looks quite nice.
- Good music/sounds (wait until you hear the shop music... that alone is worth the download)
- Fun combat system (challenging, stats, talent points, skills)
- 9 customizable classes (3 basic classes that each advance into 3 different classes)
- Cash shop is currently quite reasonable. It doesn't feel like you're being crippled to lure you into spending money nor does it feel P2W. You're basically just supporting the game's developpement and getting fun rewards for it.

CONS:
- Servers have had a few hiccups following the wave of new players, although the devs are usually pretty quick adressing the issues as they arise. Lag hasn't been an issue for me but I hear it is for others.
- The game is in alpha, so it does have some bugs (again, devs are usually around and try to help)
- The UI is better than some indie retro games I've seen but still could use some work. It takes a while to get used to.
- Mob claiming is done via last hitting, meaning it doesn't matter if you've done 90% of the damage, if someone runs in and gets the last attack in, they get the kill. This also applies to gathering and can result in griefing.

The game is still pretty early in its developpement stage but is an enjoyable experience nonetheless, as long as you understand what you're getting into. If you're curious, give it a shot!",1493621369,1493621369,True,3,0,0.514684617519378662,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Firstly, the controls. They are *very* sluggish, not to mention downright confusing. Intereacting with anything has you using the left control key, which is awkward. However, if you want to pick up items on the ground (Which can be picked up by other players), you need to press *space*. This quickly gets confusing and annoying, as you also have to figure out how to equip items.

The next thing I had issues with was the tutorial. I never made it out of town before I realized how absent the tutorial was. ""Talk to the other townsfolk"" is not a helpful hint as to what you need to do next. Which people? Where at? What are they doing? It's a mess. It also doesn't explain the basic controls right then and there. If I had to venture a guess, it spreads them out. Not good.

At this point, the alarm bells in my head were going off. So, just in case, I decided to read into the game, based on reviews, videos, and breakdowns of the game itself. From what I was able to find (And saw), the game is notorious for lag spikes that will kill you in the wilderness. The game also, at one point, will force the player into PvP areas, where stronger players kill weaker players in droves. Having absolutely no intention of touching PvP, as the community based around it seems to be made up primarily of Elitists, Trolls, and the occasional 'actual' player, I immediately marked that as a negative, a big one. Nobody should be forced into PvP, especially against a horde of trolls.

The second thing I ran into was the prescence of dropped inventories upon death. Normally I wouldn't have an issue with this in a game (although, it depends on the game), but when you are playing a *very simple* 2D MMO, that kind of mechanic is not needed. This went straight onto my negative list as well, as you wind up losing important or hard-to-get items in a few seconds, whether it's to mobs or players.

Lastly, and this was innevitable, the community. When perusing the reviews, and I came across any negative review, the comments were either condescending, offensive, trollish in nature, or just plain zealous. While there was the occasional neutral comment, or comment from a current player of the game that expressed some agreement witht he review, most of the comments were pretty bad. If this kind of behavior is found in the game's reviews, I can't only imagine what in-game must look like once you leave town, and start running into those that play simply to make your experience a living hell

Look, it's a pretty game, albeit a little dated, but it's not exactly good. Between clunky and awkward controls, forced PvP, and a community that gets pretty toxic towards negative reviews, or even players rightfully complaining about certain features or mechanics, the game just isn't worth my time, and, honestly, might not be worth yours either.",1493456312,1493456312,False,11,1,0.506936132907867432,3,False,False,True,False,,,

Not only do you get a huge feeling of progression and accomplishment as you level up like any grindy game, the community is amazing. I've never played a game before that when I get on the frist thing I look forward to is talking to people in my guild. Everyone is extremely social and always willing to help anyone lower level then them. Concerning co-op play it is wonderful, I legitimantly got a feeling of adventure when me and two others set off to take on the first boss. There is so much that you can do to level up between killing mobs or leveling skills such as mining, woodcutting, and fishing that grinding never gets boring. There are constant updates as well adding new content. In 60 hours of playing this game I check steam every day for an update something that only one other game has made me do and that was after over 550 hours.

The characters move way too slow, which requires the player to buy mounts or obtain them from mobs. With that said, you are pretty much in slow movement for a good amount of time which is not a good first impression.

After recently played Orake2d, so many things have been borrowed from that game (or vice versa), which is to say there needs to be originality somewhere along the lines. Certainly it is not an exact copy, but it does turn me off in the sense I have good reason to leave Orake and do not need to be reminded of its mechanics.

Penalties are way too harsh. When you die, you loose a good chunk of xp and all items in your inventory. This is the biggest let down because the mobs spawn so randomly, you are bound to die one way or another. Without the classes being balanced, you can be sure that people will eventually lean to one and disregard the others. Also with the servers being down randomly as well, this can lead to very big problems as well.

Speaking of which, the grinding is so grueling that losing that valuable xp and items can really deter people away from this game. You are pretty much moving at a slow pace trying to regain xp and doing other skills, and makes the mood feel so monotonous.

Alright, enough of the negatives. The positives of this game is definitely the community. Very active and helpful community with good events to allow player interaction. The music also is pretty neat (especially the item store music) that adds a nice relaxing mode to the game. I would lose a lot of xp, but just listening to the music just makes me want to try again. Not original, but does fit the mood.

Some suggestions.

1. I know it's a fairly new game, but the servers. Connection is very unreliable and you get dc'd very often.

2. Going to new areas causes crashing. When you, say for example, go from Gandor town to Gandor forest it has a large lag inbetween. Sometimes crashing the best of computers. I'm sure this will be fixed eventually.

3. A menu to be able to change keybinds. I love keybinds, they are the most useful things in the game. But there are so many keys that don't do anything yet and I want a menu to be able to modify them as I please.

4. The crafting house. Dragging the items are a massive pain. I think it would be much easier to just use the action key to interact with the crafting table, anvil, etc.

5. Some sort of guideline for each type of hero (Page, Hunter, Mage). I've seen many people using the wrong items for their corresponding hero. Like hunters using swords, pages using bows etc.

Just a tip: THE WIKI IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

Client stability typicallys lasts me around 10-15 map changes before I get a ""DX8 unrecoverable error.""  Yup, DX8 from 2000-01, your eyes do not deceive you; return to a land where Windows XP is cutting edge and broadband 2mbps downstream is still over $100/mo.  Let's not forget the strange discomfort of the installer asking you to point it to your system32 folder.

I really wanted to like this because it reminded me a bit of LoK crossed with UO in a LttP-esque shell, almost a throwback to Graal, but between a connection as reliable as your 9600 baud, a strugglingly bad interface that makes basic control of your character feel like maneuvering a pile of rocks, and the increasingly unforgiving death penalty for the many, MANY times you'll die (to lag spikes, client crashes and general asshattery of the desert-and-beyond crowd, basically everything that was wrong about Dark Souls MP) you're better off spending time watching paint dry.  The game was sort-of fun up until they force PVP on you in normal PVE areas, which is basically endlessly populated by high level people running monster trains onto hapless folks trying to get their tier 3 gear, and gangs of people roaming around that can actually fight within your level range just ganking and looting you.  Yes, you read that right; you lose your inventory on death PVP or PVE, and anyone can come by and grab your stuff.

PVP is buggy and laughable, always devolving to who gets the first hit, if you can even get your client to target the other player at all.  You have a handful of ninjas who've learned all the quirks of this joke of an interface who literally sit on each shard and bully the same areas day in and day out, so it's completely impossible to know if there is any worthwhile content hidden beyond these PVP areas without paying $50-$100 to look prestigeous enough to join one of the Cool Kids Clubs.  There are absolutely zero consequences for attacking another player, so get twinked and gank across as many accounts in as many level ranges as you want, if you can stand to grind.

...that's literally all there is to do here; grinding.  A game for narcissistic sadists where the sole, :innovative: gameplay mechanic so far is allowing you to be a dick to the other players by looting their corpses.  It moves like molasses and there is never a moment between dealing with clunky controls and the constant crashing that you can feel comfortable.

The game has it's bugs, of course, being so new to the steam life, but the fact it's an online game with its own servers built by indie developers who are frequently active, updating, patching, and working towards a better game? Not to mention the surprisingly great community and the fact that it has its own discord which admins are often watching and responding to? It's a feat all its own.

As for the game itself, it is a bit of a grind. Gaining exp for things like crafting and gathering make it worth it, and you can make the grind faster by making better weapons. The game feels simple, and the trio of choices for advancement leave plenty of room for unique builds, especially since you can allocate stats and use any weapon you like, and there's a number of cross-class spells to buy. Having only three base classes in the beginning that split into a total of 9 down the road is a good move, leaving things a little easier to choose from in the beginning. 

Obviously the game still needs work. But the admins are always patching, and fixing things. Always active, always listening.

The game treads the line between really fun and frustrating. The game is really fun, if you care for the asthetics. There are a lot of problems though.

Maps are littered with little obstacles that halt movement (everything but walls really need to be walkable). This is usually just frustrating, but when you're fighting aggro mobs it will get you killed regularly.

Also, the UI is very very bad. I understand the game is in Alpha, and usually the UI is rudamentary (crafting very much so), so I expect that to change in the future.

Another huge issue is class imbalance. Magi are incredibly underpowered in damage output, wear the lightest armor, and have to stand still to cast. They aren't class cannons, they are just glass. On PvP maps you'll get killed by invisible people in 1 shot. You'd be lucky to even get 1 cast off just to do minor damage before you die and watch them loot you (even if you're higher level). Normally, you'd assume you can just avoid all PvP then, but at a certain point the game soft forces you to level in a PvP zone.

The last issue is there is no controller support. I wouldn't recommend the game at all if you ultimately had to use WASD, Space and Ctrl for everything. I highly suggest using a keyboard remapper to use a gamepad, since the game functions far better with a gamepad. They really need to get on this, as I see plenty of players quit immediately over this issue.

So, basically, it's a very fun game, but very frustrating due to it's early development and some asthetic and balance issues.",1491174736,1491174736,True,2,0,0.499344080686569214,1,False,False,True,False,,,

Step 4. Realise the game tricked you into thinking you had a afro.

Step 5. Drop a axe trying to equip it.

Step 6. Go to a tutorial guy.

Step 7. Get out of the game for a couple of seconds to get the joy of painting theme.

Step 8. Get stuck.

Step 13. Some guy crashes his car at the source of your electricity

I think it's okay, it's alright. It's not absolutely amazing, but it doesn't have to be. I recognize a lot of the BGM's used because I'm using the engine that they're actually meant to be used on. That said, I want to make it clear that almost none of the BGM's used are author-created. I could link anyone directly to the RPG Maker Restaff packs where these BGM's were pulled.

Still, with that out of the way, I still think the game is fairly quaint. It's not necessarily easy, but it's not necessarily too difficult, either. It has its quirks, such as melee classes not exactly being favorable choices due to how if the enemy moves a single tile you aren't going to be able to connect your hits, while a ranged class does not have this problem.

The big things with the game are definitely accessibility. It's in Early Access, but at the time of this writing, I would recommend to the developer some kind of option to one-time reset your stats if you're under Lv.15 or something. I didn't know there were bows in the game, so I just went STR on a character. As it turns out, as a Hunter, AGI is my primary stat - not STR. I didn't know this, so now I'm running around with 3~4 levels worth of a useless stat.

The movement speed is extremely off-putting. I'm not saying people need to run at 500 feet per second, but the current walking speed is absolutely grueling and works to dampen the fun of the game. It's slow-paced by design, and as a result it's fairly uneventful and predictable. I understand slower movement speed in dark places such as caves and dungeons, but in the open field and especially in towns, you shouldn't be crawling as slow as you are.

The last thing is dialog. Using a keyboard key to interact, but then having to click [Continue] in dialogs makes for a jarring experience. I also can't tell you how many times I dropped my starting equipment on the ground because I thought I was going to equip it. It just makes sense that if you right-click an item, you're going to use it or equip it.

The conclusion is that the game is an acquired taste. If you play it for 15 mins, there's good odds you might hate it, but if you push through, it'll grow on you and you might be like me and go from absolutely hating it to kinda-sorta liking it.",1490994581,1490994676,True,0,1,0,1,False,False,True,False,,,

First of all, all im about to say is based on my opinion of the game, and the experience I had this far.
So this is what I find good about the game:
- The community, honestly one of the best and noob friendly I've ever seen.
   From veteran players, to mods/devs, everyone will help you, just ask a question in chat, and they are there for you.
   Also, devs are super open to feedback, and that's the kind of devs every game needs.
- The variety of content. Yeah I know, it may not seem much, but for a alpha, you have a lot to do, from farming resources to sell and earn gold, to making new equipment. Trust me, you will be busy if you sink into this.
- The music, it's actually pretty enjoyable. 
   And the shop music, oh god, so troll but so good at the same time xD
Now, no game is perfect, so here are some weak points:
- Controls are clunky, and you need time to get used to it,
- The interface may seem kinda confusing at first, for exemple, in terms of crafting, people are used to go to some object, press a button and options for crafting. Here, you have to drag resources, THEN the options will appear.

Now, there were some points I didn't think it is fair to talk about, like servers lagging, simply because it's a Alpha, and the number of players that got into the game was a little overwhelming to the servers.
But in all honestly, all the weak points that I did or did not mention, can easily fixed with time.
IT'S A ALPHA BOYZ, DONT JUDGE TOO HARD.

Try it if you like oldschool lile RPG's.
Just don't give it a negative review if it's not your type of game.

 If you cannot wait to explore a rich environment and a truely pixel art game with good old school RPG music then download it now and don't wait.

The DEVS teams work hard to listen to everyone and you can be part of this fantasy world. I'm bored of trowing money into games 3A MMO like Black Dessert Online and even if you trow them 1000$ they will PEE on you and you will never never be heard on what you think.

In Life Forge you will be heard , and you can help this fantasy world to get betters.

The game is fun , you get addicted fast. Lots of crafting and gathering , PvP , PvE boss ect. Everything you expect from a good RPG is there. 

The Music is flawless, it makes the world alive and the blend with music and art is completly succesful.

COMPLETELY NOT a PaY2WIN game , IM BORED of Free to Play games.... RARE are the good Free to Play Games.

In 2017,  when i SEE free to play games I hear free to get anus fuck but it not the case here and THANK YOU.

I only pray that they will POLISH what they have into their hands instead of pushing new content like many games. 

I'd give a 9/10 for this game , and polish polish polish polish more and id you  guys a 10/10,

People complain about how slow the characters are and that's fine but 2D games are suppose to be played at a slow pace in my opinion. And thank you @Adamant Entertainment, for keeping in touch and walking everyone through this. Good luck to you with the game!",1490654661,1490811195,True,1,0,0.499344080686569214,10,False,False,True,False,,,

DISCLAIMER: This is an alpha stage FREE to play game. There will be bugs, there will be stability issues, there will be a lack of robust content. If you do not go into an alpha game expecting the world, there are a lot of things to like about Life Forge.

Initial impressions upon installing this game were very good, the pixel art is great and not recycled from RPG Maker. The soundtrack and sound effects are excellent, some of which are stock and some commissioned from within the dev community. I recommend going through the tutorial area before exploring the first area as it will explain the majority of gameplay aspects. You can also level here very quickly through skilling up your professions, which I also recommend unless you just really hate crafting. The majority of items you use will be crafted, some world items will drop as well, but are not always easily accessible (boss drops) or are rare.

The spells and battling are not overly complex and have yet to be fully fleshed out, but are still fun. Spells and class roles are somewhat undefined outside of a few specializations like the Magi's Cleric role, which was just fixed and given a more healing centric buff which sets them apart from hybrids. The Magi's other two options, Wizard, and Necromancer, don't really have a lot separating them except a few spells so you might want to choose based on what might fit your playstyle in the future. I have not played a Hunter or Page class yet, but from discussions they have a similar set of on-going development and defining within their specializations.

At times leveling will be a bit grindy, whether it is through crafting, or killing monsters, but it is not a horrible grind that drags on. I reached level cap within a week of pretty consistent playing. Level cap has limited things to do at the moment, but they just re-added an end-game ""raid"" with Steam launch and PvP is always an option. They should have no problem putting out more content regularly.

PvP has its ups and downs. There are definitely some imbalance issues, but what PvP game doesn't have that. They changed it so that the first area is PvP free which was a smart move because it promoted ganking of lowbies, especially if you had not gone to the tutorial and leveled up there to at least 15. You won't run into PvP until the second desert area now. I would say as it stands now there is a good mix of PvP and PvE crowd, but the former can be ruthless at times. In Life Forge when you die you lose XP and a portion of anything you are carrying in your bag. Some people have no qualms ganking you and taking your stuff, so travel lightly and if farming make frequent stops to the town to unload goods. The game offers a good amount of safe zones as well to farm crafting materials without fear of being ganked. PvE death results in the same loss of XP and/or items. Some people will still loot you if they are in the same area, but will return items if called out on it or asked nicely. I made it a habit to prevent dying at all costs by avoiding dangerous areas above your level, and staying out of PvP zones unless no one was around.

Overall I really enjoy this game and it has potential. There is a pretty good community so far in number, and outside of a few dufuses everyone is helpful and not complete jerks. The developers seem to have a good idea what they'd like to do with this game and are very helpful while being engaged in the community. Hopefully they can deliver a solid F2P product and keep the promise of not allowing people to pay for power through the cash shop which right now only delivers novelty items and potions that do various things like reset talents/stats and bless the realm with 2X XP. You can also buy stat/talent resets with in-game gold.",1490649202,1613682592,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And it is still in alpha so it has a lot of growing that takes place.

I'm not going to give a ""Full and Critical"" review of LIFE FORGE, as it's relatively new and it is presently in it's early alpha stages, so what I will say before I go onto my list of it's Features and PRO'S/CON'S is that the game plays very well for the stage it is in with bugs that one comes across often times being minor ones or slight adjustments to balance, or a lily pad that you can walk on in a pond that shouldn't be crossable.   More important than that is the staff are actively involved and the developers directly talk with and listen to their community.

The players are a mix of a wonderful majority that enjoy interacting with others and you have a mix of the traditional more cutt throat online gamers; but as with any online experience you 'really' can not judge how this will be for any given person. (But the community is pleasant and isn't toxic.)

GAMEPLAY
Note: I've heard there'll be a system to allow you to set your own key bindings so this portion may become dated.
The gameplay itself plays similar to akin to many older pixel-art with a W,A,S,D format with CNTRL to do a basic attack, left click (or a button) to target and 1 to = for hot key placement, the classes all feel and operate differently and depending on how you build your stats so would your own class.    

FEATURES:
- Three Core Classes with Three advanced class options unique to their core class available at level 25.
- A Growing Spell/Ability system where the skill grows in level and ability the more it is used.
- A Skill system for Mining, Blacksmithing, Woodcutting, Carpentry, Fishing, Cooking, Tanning, and Tailoring; there may be more i'm still working on just now nearly reaching the present  level cap on my first character.
- A Talent Tree system that has Offensive, Specialist, and Defensive branches allowing  for great stat customization which there is also a ""Level up and stat distribution system"" which gives the player control of how their character turns out.
- A exciting and diverse world in terms of play-style, the out-lands are often PvP enabled and perilous in many ways while the close-to-town and village areas are often times safe as are 'safe harvesting zones'; but the greater rewards await in the outlands giving people a interesting slew of options.  (You can't fight someone over a 5 level difference though as to avoid griefers.)
- The games' communication system has Global, Local, and ( !Name Msg) style Whispering presently as well as a strongly functional trading system and a guild system.  
- A powerful community where the Developers and staff are actively involved with their work and product, .
- Each class has a interesting unique roll all it's own while often able to accomplish their core role still allowing for interesting party composition versus the usual 'Tank/Healer/Dps/Dps' grind, a skilled player may even solo most foes though some can be tricky given their areas.
- Player driven economy and Crafting; only the crudest and barest of equipment for each 'type' is available with a few exceptions existing at a variety of areas (Often Outland shops with odd currency).     

PRO'S:
- Enjoyable style of art that while simplistic stands out and flows throughout it's world very nicely.
- Hilarious shop soundtrack, most memorable i've heard in any MMO.
- An aggressive player will like that they can literally muscle other players out of the 'EXP race' in the outlands if they want or be a shining exemplar of travellers and protect people and ward off red-PKs; this returns the classic and more unforgiving feel older MMOs like Ultima online and Everquest were known for in rough regions, as people who die lose a portion of EXP to the PK and they drop some of their items in their backpack.
- A non-PvP oriented player will find the majority of the community are really awesome so reaching any boss with a group and fighting it is often very safe and a rewarding experience as well as that most of the games' areas lack a ""PvP open"" tag, including the entire first town and dungeon.
- A harvester feels a real sense of risk/reward on this game, as most won't venture into the outlands to gather materials, while a brave one that does may be at risk they often have zero competition; I found this to be an amazing risk/reward feature.
- Enemies are smart enough of an AI to navigate around most of their environments as well as tend to be problematic enough they're a fun challenge.
- If you love a competative and fluid market, this game has one that is ran by the players, so supply and demand and commitment/reward are a thing here versus everyone buying/selling to the same NPCs.
- Possible to max every trade.

CON'S:
The Game is in alpha so in regards to criticism i'll only give a minor amount, many things are being balanced, improved, altered and as just a player i've watched this game grow even the span of the weeks i've been here.
- Some skills will feel Grindy and areas for harvesting during peak times can prove difficult to manage if theres fierce competition, but a clever person 'can' usually find isolated areas.
- Online experiences with players may not always reflect the fun nature of the game.
- Crafting presently takes back-seat to rare drops, but I suspect this may be adjusted/balanced one day.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE (Some lols)

_______________

My own experience in life forge has been playing a PAGE, in my early days I first found myself in GANDOR the home town of all things new and inexperienced in LF and I quickly set about to looking around the town.   The familiar looking signs of a SWORD, SHIELD, or INN helped me easily enough locate the homes of interest, or lack thereof, so while I might of missed something passing through Gandor I soon discovered a friendly shop keepe who's song I still remember; 'Buy buy buy buy buy buy', at least I think that's the lyrics, but I noticed this store had maybe basic gear sets for each 'type' of core class and only a 1H/2H option for each, and only the crudest of such I was 'certain' so I set about wandering around beating on the turtles I found in the hills while inquiring in chat about the quandary.

It was at this time from the chat I learned about the Player-Economy and then returned to the shop to enjoy the song and purchase a PICK AXE.   Already about a level 12 page from brutalizing the hill creatures I began mining and smithing IRON (Tier 2) tools for myself and even some iron armor; feeling quite confident I inquired about where I might find even more impressive armor or weapons (I am a man that likes cool swords), so I set about my journey through IRON STAR MTN!


I found within the mountain about halfway up I encountered my first hostile foes and within the caverns even came across some level 18 golems; being only 13 at this time I just ran past these until I later felt bold and clobbered one near what later found was a interesting Boss Cavern room that instantly transported me back to those days as a kid where I remembered playing Legend of Zelda and going through the boss' room to press switches and get to the central minotaur boss -- who I noticed was level 20 and there was a passage way to entirely avoid... so I did!    (Turns out it was good I did, he's pretty strong!)

By this new day I found may way through the mouseling forests and past the very popular desert river into the town I call Armi; here I encountered a somber NPC of a soldier blocking my passage into the desert insisting that I be forewarned murderers and PKs could be lurking in the lands beyond him; but I'm head strong so I scrolled right past most of the details and into the out skirts of town immediatly setting about into the next area of DESERTS!",1490644570,1490645756,True,9,0,0.563095331192016602,2,False,False,True,False,,,
