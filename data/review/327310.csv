I couldn't tell if this had something to do with the built in resolution or the fact that I was on a 4k monitor or what, but even though the game has these resolutions as options it clearly wasn't designed around them. 

This is a shame as it seems the entire game is effected by this bizarre scaling issue, including the opening cinematic. However even after lowering the resolution repeatedly I still could never get it to a size that seemed at least functional--very bizarre. 

On a stylistic level I love everything about this game, and the music has a wonderful bop to it that matches the energy of the artstyle.

The killer combination tough... that would be the randomness of patrols with the poor level design and the lack of balls of the developer.
The randomness is such that it transforms every heist in a dice game.
The level design cramps too many goals into too small spaces with a lot of random patrols.
That makes the RNG go exponential.
And it would still be enjoyable if the developer had the courage to let the players save.
But they were scared it would make their product shorter.
They couldn't compute that giving up on a game makes it shorter than finishing it, on top of disorienting a thumb.

One heist takes a long time, stealth games being games of patience, long minutes multiplied by the number of attempts.
Yet here, missions are chained without saving; inter-missions checkpoints are valid for the current session only.
This stupid design creates the same stupid issue it does in many stupid games: You need hours of guaranteed free time ahead of you before launching this disappointware.
Personally, when I do have time for a long session, I don't launch a casual game but an involving one.

Meanwhile, the straw that broke my camel toe is different entirely.
We revisit the same galleries with 3 characters, each thief having a different ability.
Until the story went and removed the only character I actually enjoyed playing.

A quick TL:DR summary
Story: There is one
Controls: Simple yet fun
Gameplay: Standard stealth with a twist
Style: A+ very sleek
Music: Pleasant elevator style
Difficulty: Keyboard smashingly hard
Overall: Love it, great game.

I saw Jacksepticeye play this one time and the style and swagger of the game told me one thing; I must have it! So I bought it and expected a few hours of casual fun, boy was I wrong.
   
Now before we get to that, the game is great. Thes story is nothing great but gets the job done. The marvelous Miss Take has you take (no pun intended) the role of Sophia Take whos aunt dies and leaves a massive art collection for her. However she is cheated out of her inheritance and as a result makes the decision to steal all the art back. You subsequently have to guide Sophia or one of her two partners in crime through a series of levels, stealing everything in sight while dodging guards and ducking cameras.
   
The gameplay is easy to learn, use the mouse to move Sophia and... that's it. You use the mouse for everything, be it walking, running, distracting, using gadgets etc. which makes the game simplistic in that nice way. Using your trusted mouse you will steal various art peices while going through pretty standard stealth gameplay, hide, distract, learn patterns and such but with a slight twist: the guards move randomly. Cameras and lasers follow patterns but guards will simply saunter around the level at random which encourages (hrm, forces) you to distract them in order to work around them. A nice if bothersome addition as you have to put all of that Assassins creed thinking out of your head but still
  
As for the feel of the game: awsome. As I said the style of this game is astonishing. (It was one of the main things that made me want this game) and the levels and menu screens blend beautifully with eachother, add to that some suave music and we are set for greatness.
   
Now as I said before: casual fun this game is not. The tag is mighty misleading as the game is really difficult. The first few levels are easily completed and you feel confident going into chapter 2 where the difficulty ramps up with the pay-to-win speed of a mobile game. The guards are plentiful and their sightcone is enormous (easily covers an entire room) on top of which you have to time lasers and cameras while also dealing with dogs that sniff you out (*Last of us 2 flashbacks*) all in the confides of a tiny room. As if that wasn't bad enough the random patterns of the guards means that it is basically impossible to form any type of plan, forcing you to think on your feet. Trust me, you will be angry, you will yell things like: ""oh come on I was right there"" or ""Ofcourse he turned around right then"" and you will be forced to try every level again, and again... and again (and that's not even mentioning the bonus time objectives). Luckily, much like Cuphead, the levels are only about 2 minutes long so where as you will be forced to redo them, it won't be a slog. 
P.S. pro tip: Resist the urge to run when the brown stuff hits the fan, you'll thank me later.

To sum it all up: I love this game. With it's sleek visuals, chill music and fun gameplay it makes for a great experience. Yes it is difficult and yes at times unfair but despite that I kept coming back and I finished it and I don't regret a thing. And coming from a guy who usually gives up when games get hard, I'd say that accounts for something.

In theory this means the player must think and react quickly, but getting caught immediately results in a loss, which forces the player to restart and hope the guard positions are more favorable next time.  While most levels are relatively short and provide checkpoints, the repeated restarts can be time-consuming.  Overall not terrible, but not good enough to recommend.
Pros:
+ Levels have some replay value because there are multiple characters with distinct stealth mechanics.
Cons:
- The randomized guard behavior makes success seem luck-dependent, and leaves little room for strategy or planning in advance. Being forced to repeatedly restart a level can quickly become frustrating. 
- Character movement is imprecise because multiple different controls (walk, run, open, move camera, etc) are mapped to the same context-based click input.
- The fixed isometric camera can make movement unreliable when trying to navigate behind objects or walls, and the inability to zoom out often means getting caught by off-screen guards.",1575878579,1610125853,False,4,0,0.54459911584854126,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Chapter One is fine, but the second section of Chapter Two really just won't let me get past it. No matter what path I take, no matter how careful I am, I am always caught. I'm actually starting to wonder if it is possible to get past it at all. 

The UI isn't at all helpful. You can click on a spot you want Miss Take to move to and instead of going directly there she will move slightly past it and sometimes a little around a corner of the display table into the path of a camera or guard. Also if you happen to leave your finger on the mouse button for more than a micro fraction of a second Miss Take will  run which will of course alerts the guard. 

Whistling to attract the guards just makes it easier for them to catch you. Add to this there seems to be a problem with the guards where they just will not leave the room if you are in it. If you are outside the room, they will wander into the room and then leave, but once you are in some rooms, they just stick around and won't go away. Which would be fine, if it was just one guard. But two guards and a camera means no way out which forces you to fail. 

Some of the time if you're in a certain position on screen, you can't move the camera up or down far enough to check out where the nearby guards are either. And the teleport device has a super long cool down. Someone mentioned in another comment that the cooldown is dependant on the treasure you have, but really its just annoying and makes you sit in a corner waiting and waiting until you can use it again.

Прежде чем покупать эту игру, вам надо чётко понимать, что вы хотите от этой игры. Если закрученного сюжета, мощного геймплея, красот невиданных геймдизайнерских, то пролистывай эту игру не задумываясь.

Вкратце про геймплей: 
-25 уровней, разделённых на 5 комнат по 5 заданий; 
-3 играбельных персонажа со своими фишками (по крайней мере 3 доступных на момент открытия 3-й комнаты);
-Стелс (он прост до безобразия, и реализован неплохо для подобной игры).

В грі приємна графіка і непоганий дизайн, але все ж таки, з часом набридає проходити схожі між собою рівні. Зіграти можна за трьох різних персонажів, у кожного з яких власний стиль гри та гаджети, що дозволяє трішки урізноманітнити проходження. Гра не складна і легко розібратися що й до чого, але саме керування персонажем за допомогою мишки і клавіатури залишає бажати кращого, тому над деякими рівнями прийдеться попітніти ;) Головним недоліком гри є хаотичний рух охоронців: з однієї сторони цікаво, що не має лінійних маршрутів, котрі легко прорахувати і проскочити повз, але з іншої сторони - їхня поведінка це повний рандом, вони можуть збитися в кучу і оточити вашого персонажа намертво, або ж залишити без нагляду майже весь рівень.
Якщо ви думаєте чи придбати цю гру, то раджу робити це при знижці -80% і більше, або ж у якомусь бандлі.

I find them frustrating to play through, since most games do not provide you with cues regarding whether the NPCs can see or hear you until it’s far too late.

Instead I discovered that playing this game was not a mistake; quite the opposite in fact.

[i]The Marvelous Miss Take[/i] is the real deal; stealth, spatial awareness, and tricking your enemies by going into and out of their fields of vision, or making noise, is crucial to completely each level of this game.  And even better still, each player character in the game has their own unique play styles, meaning that you actually have to take into account each character’s unique abilities.  This is especially noticeable when playing as Harry Carter, one of the few examples of a physically disabled player character in a video game.  Instead of focusing on getting through each level swiftly, his major objectives to getting a perfect score is to get past each level unseen by both the security guards and the cameras, meaning pattern memorization and creating distractions by making noise with his cane and personal gadgets, are your keys to success.

Add a catchy, yet relaxing, soundtrack, bright colourful visuals with stylized character designs that pop and get your attention make [i]The Marvelous Miss Take[/i] an excellent game to play regardless of your previous (dis)interest in the stealth genre.",1530547506,1530547626,True,1,0,0.489773958921432495,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Yes, the randomness encourages you to be aware of your surroundings, but you probably were already. I feel like the main problem this randomness has is that it eliminates the puzzle-like aspect of most stealth games, where you have to map your way around obstacles without being spotted. Some of my favorite moments of this game come from finding ways to consistently dodge around early obstacles, attempting to beat the time limit. But this game hardly allows you to do that, because you never know exactly where the guards might be or where they're looking, making a lot of the speed strats simply to pray to RNGesus. 
That's not to say the game is all luck, it isn't, but I still can't help but feeling I'm still the same player I was when I first started playing. I say this because even though I've completed more than half the levels, I would still be just as challenged to try and complete them again. That's my gripe with this game.

It was a nice casual stealth experience until Episode 3, where things got more serious(ly annoying), and then the last two episodes where pretty much a meltdown. I rarely feel like this, but I specifically regret the time spent on Episode 5 :(
I guess it's obvious from the above that the game stopped to be fun when the difficulty increased. It can of course mean that a) I s*ck at stealth games, but it can also mean that b) the game's mechanics are not good enough for more complicated scenarios. Unsurprisingly, I vote b). Some of my reasons:
- The environments are too small, there's hardly any room for maneuvering. This destroys most Daisy scenarios, unless you're of the goatherder persuasion. Especially if you want to work in full stealth, which would be my first choice.
- Controls are not accurate. That's not a problem early in the game until you don't have to round corners with a laser field right at your legs.
- Random guard movements. It's super fun early on, and super annoying when the game gets tough. You basically need to finish the late levels as if the computer was generating random numbers specifically to hamper you. I'm not saying the game is cheating, mind you - but it certainly feels so at times, especially in Episode 5.

There's more, but I don't want to dissect the game any further, and I'm giving it a (very reluctant) thumbs up anyway. The first two episodes were a blast, 3 and 4 were increasingly annyoing but bearable, so it's still a lot of worthy content.

Meet Sophia, who only wishes to steal back what is rightfully hers. Along the way she meets Harry and Daisy; the 3 of them team up to find out what happened to Sophia's will (after the passing away of a close family member) and, of course, to steal a lot of paintings and other stuff from art galleries. 

The ""home"" section shows your own gallery where you can launch a level. Each level has 2 floors to be completed. You can only control one character at a time: when Harry and later Daisy join you notice the already completed levels can be done by them, too. Naturally, this means a rather different positioning of guards as each character has a different playstyle.

With Sophia we steal most items. A lot of objects and paintings and each level has one object behind a window case. As the heist occurs during opening hours there are civilians in the galleries. They only notify guards when you smash this one particular window case. Your best bet is to immediately hide. Generally speaking, your job is to try to avoid the line of sight of guards, cameras and dogs. Later on wall-mounted lasers make your job more difficult. Sophia is a must for story progression - Harry and Daisy can only enter a level if it has already been completed by their friend.

With Harry running is not an option anymore as he walks with the use of a cane. He enters the galleries at night time and with him we need to steal fewer paintings only. In my opinion Harry's playthrough is the most difficult in the absence of running. If you run with Sophia or Daisy it can be heard if guards are close-by but in a distance it is an extremely useful feature. Back to Harry: he can drop a ball to emit noise and distract guards. You need to make sure you pick it up before leaving a level.

With Daisy I found the game the most exciting. Our job is to get close to each guard to steal a key so that a safe can be opened. Every opening triggers the alarm so make sure you have a plan for escaping as the guards will definitely check the area. While running Daisy emits a sound in a much smaller radius than Sophia.

Overall we have 25 levels to complete (beside the tutorial), so that's 75 times the fun considering the 3 protagonists. The game has great music; each level has a name of a street found in England. The graphics and the accompanying music indicate this must be the 1950s or 60s. Sometimes civilians comment on the thefts that all appear on the news; we can always read the latest headlines in newspapers between each stage.

The downside of Miss Take is that it has an uneven difficulty. The A.I. controlling the guards often gives them different commands. We can find it difficult to steal only one particular painting in a heavily guarded room. After a couple of attempts we notice even the other rooms are a bit more difficult to complete as you never know where a guard will be moving. This is especially true when it comes to starting a level: if they move to the opposite direction we know we are off to a good start.

Miss Take is a great stealth-based adventure game with a unique atmosphere. If you like challenges you can try beating all part times with Sophia and Daisy for extra achievements. With Harry, as he cannot run, the extra difficulty lies in not being noticed, at all, i.e. ""ghosting"" each level. I hardly play more than 10 hours with an indie game but Miss Take was worth every minute of it.",1510493278,1510501182,True,8,2,0.611143171787261963,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There are three major, and a few minor, problems I had that prospective buyer should beware.

First, the controls are not very good.  The default mouse controls are just awful; they don't offer the level of control needed to respond to changing situations.  Thankfully, you can switch to WASD keyboard controls, which have three problems.  First, they felt stiff and unresponsive; the number of times I failed after accidentally tripping a laser is too many.  Second, far, [i]far[/i] too often I'd get stuck on the edge of furniture or doorframes.  Lastly, you still have to use the mouse to interact with things.  Which wouldn't be a problem, but you do this so rarely I found it more comfortable to use my off hand for the run command (Shift), and then had to scramble to reach the mouse when needed.  You also use the mouse to throw things, which is not convenient for quick responses either.

Second, the guard movements are random.  Which generally wouldn't be a problem except for the optional time challenges.  In my opinion, too many of those can only be beaten with luck.  It gets very annoying when you repeatedly start a level, then quit two seconds in as a guard you need to lure is looking the wrong way.  Even worse is when you get most of the way through and then get caught when a guard off-screen happens to look at you or wander in range of a safe alarm.  That randomness also means that the difficulty curve is all over the place; even late in the game levels can become trivial with just a little good fortune.

Third is that you need to press escape then make two mouse clicks to restart a level, for no reason that I can see.  That might not seem like much, but given how often I restarted levels, it really got on my nerves.  One click on 'Restart' should be enough to restart!

The game would also benefit from the ability to rotate the camera.  Perhaps that's asking too much of an indie game, but there where a few occasions when I couldn't see clearly thanks to my character being blocked by a wall, that interfered with my play.

Given all these problems, what kept me playing the game?  The basic gameplay is solid.  There are clear visibility and awareness cones for everything, so except for off-screen guards it's clear where's safe and where's not.  Once you understand how to lure the guards away from what they are guarding, the puzzles become the fun sort of challenging.  The different gameplay styles of the three PCs also add another dimension to each level.  The main character also gets to use a variety of different items as they progress through the game, which helps to keep things varied; it's just a shame something similar couldn't have been done for the other two PCs.

Also, I really like the game's art design.  It's simple but elegant and fits the mood quite well.

There's a lot of fun to be had from [b]The Marvellous Miss Take[/b], but also a lot of frustration.  I'd recommend it if you like stealth games and puzzle games, and like a modest challenge.",1502968796,1502968796,True,4,0,0.542619526386260986,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Guards do not follow any set patrols and force you to constantly improvise your way through a level. This is both a good thing and a bad one. Sometimes guards will decide to just constantly cockblock your objective with no real way to distract them without failing the stage.

Но к сожалению, за яркой оберткой не оказалось интересного игрового процесса.

Игра создавалась с прицелом на Android/iOS девайсы с сенсорным экраном, и это хорошо заметно с самого начала. Управлению катастрофически не хватает точности и отзывчивости, подконтрольный персонаж постоянно норовит выйти из укрытия и влезть в поле зрение охраны. Чтобы прокрасться куда-то нужно один раз нажать левой кнопкой мышки по нужному месту, а чтобы перейти на бег требуется два нажатия, и это провоцирует кучу ситуаций, когда при попытке чередования перебежек от укрытия к укрытию персонаж делает не то что от него требуется и заваливает всю миссию. Особенно это раздражает когда приходится убегать от охраны, где чередование бега и скрытного перемещения очень важно, так как иначе охранник все равно услышит ваш топот и поймает героя. С гаджетами, которые можно найти на некоторых уровнях, та же проблема - выцеливать нужную траекторию для броска с помощью зажатой правой кнопки мышки нормально можно только если стоять на месте, и то не факт, что гаджет не отлетит по странной траекторией обратно к вам, зацепившись за невидимый угол.

Ладно бы только управление, но ведь разработчики допустили самую фатальную ошибку - абсолютно рандомное перемещение охраны по уровню. Нет, в самом рандоме нет ничего плохого, при правильной реализации это только увеличивает интерес к игре. Но в The Marvellous Miss Take рандом означает именно что полный рандом - куда пойдет охранник дальше предугадать невозможно, никакого шаблона, за которым можно проследить и воспользоваться, нет в принципе. Как-то поднять камеру и полностью оценить ситуацию на уровне целиком тоже нельзя, осматривать можно только кусок этажа в небольшом радиусе от подконтрольного персонажа. Чаще всего уровни проходятся не из-за четкого плана и холодного расчета, а просто из-за того, что конкретно в этот раз вам повезло и все охранник увлеченно рассматривали стены или зашли в какой-то дальний угол карты. Уже спустя час игра вызывала только непреодолимое чувство уныния и фрустрации, потому что ничто так не раздражает в тактической игре, как невозможность спланировать свои действия.

Словно этого мало, The Marvellous Miss Take очень быстро становится однообразной и даже заставляет перепроходить старые уровни, только другими персонажами и с небольшими косметическими отличиями. Уровни созданы из очень ограниченного набора кусочков и не предлагают каких-то по-настоящему других ситуаций, новые гаджеты и типы охраны кардинально не меняют однообразной сути игры. Неудивительно, что, судя по достижениям, The Marvellous Miss Take прошли всего 3% (!) игроков, я сам выдержал 2 часа исключительно из-за того, что ждал выпадения карточек. На выходе имеем внешне красивую, но очень однообразную игру с плохим управлением и отсутствием возможности четко спланировать свои действия, что для тактической игры смерти подобно. Если душа желает стильного и умного стелса в изометрии, то лучше сыграйте в Invisible, Inc, чем в эту сомнительную аркаду с мобилок.",1488895802,1488895802,False,29,1,0.685451805591583252,2,False,False,False,False,,,

This review is a reupload from [url=https://gaolioccasionallyreviews.wordpress.com/2016/10/24/the-marvellous-miss-take/]Gao Li Occasionally Reviews[/url]

[i]The Marvellous Miss Take[/i] (Wonderstruck, 2014) is a short, but incredibly fun to play and beautiful to look at stealth game. The art collection Miss Sophia Take was supposed to inherit from her aunt was stolen by Ralph Blackstock and she and her friends have not just vowed to reclaim it, but also uncover the truth behind his ill-gotten gains. In this game with an isometric camera angle, players engage in various art heists in 25 different galleries (not counting tutorial and epilogues) as one of three characters: Sophia Take, the master thief Harry Carver, or the pick pocket Daisy Hobbs.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785268579

[h1]Controls[/h1]

[i]Miss Take[/i] can be played either with your keyboard/mouse combo or a controller. For this review, I used a wired Xbox 360 joypad by Microsoft that the game only recognized the first time I plugged it in. After that, whenever I started the game, I had to navigate to the 《Settings》menu and then to 《Controls》, click on 《Keyboard Movement》and could only then use the gamepad. Sometimes I even had to do that twice. This was definitely not the fault of my toaster [spoiler] (a 32-bit Windows Vista computer with 3070MB RAM, Intel Core 2 CPU, GeForce 9500 GT, and DX11)[/spoiler] as it also happened on a Lenovo G50-80E5 laptop [spoiler](64-bit, with Windows 10, 8GB RAM, Intel Core i7 CPU, Intel HD Graphics 5500, DX11)[/spoiler].

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Each location can be played through using all three of the protagonists, all of whom have their separate tasks at hand and differing handicaps: Sophia’s missions are the easiest, despite her having the loudest footsteps and having to steal the most amount of art – during opening hours nonetheless. Harry – having to take three painting from each floor without being seen by any of the guards – cannot run and breaks in during night time. Finally, there’s Daisy whom the guards only notice when she is in their direct field of view. She breaks in during closing days, stealing the keys from the guards and then taking the contents from Blackstock’s safe-deposit boxes. To add spice to the game, the levels are timed while the movement patterns of non-player characters are randomized. Although this might be a nightmare scenario for speedrunners, it turns out to be a fun affair with high replay value for semi-casual players like myself. 

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785268410

There certainly was a lot of love and skill put into the game. The soundtrack is amazing and the cel shaded characters and environments give the whole adventure the more than welcome comic look. Not just that, but the awesomely looking, interactive startup screen changes with each reclaimed painting. Unfortunately, this means that [i]The Marvellous Miss Take[/i] only has one save slot, making it impossible to share it with your sibling or significant other. Nevertheless, erasing the save can be done from inside the game, which is nice.

The gameplay mechanics are few, thus easy to remember, and well explained. Dangers, like the field of view of the guards, are exquisitely indicated. An issue might be, sadly, that one rather often has to restart stages as the protagonists can end up cornered by the random movement patterns of the guards. Luckily enough, all of the stages are very brief and can all be beaten in less than five minutes, several can take even less than two minutes, if you know what you are doing. Sadly, the plot and the characters are very rudimentary and feel unfinished, so if you are a fan of story-rich games, this might not be your title.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785268497

[h1]Play length[/h1]

Overall it took me around 14 hours to beat the game and an additional two hours (16 hours total gameplay) to get all achievements. After beating the par-time for all stages, players can try to beat the pro-, and afterwards the developer-times, the latter I haven’t unlocked as of writing this article (19 hours of total gameplay).

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

[i]The Marvellous Miss Take[/i] comes highly recommended; there even is a free demo version available, if you want to try it out before purchasing. The problem I had with the controller is a minor one, once I learned what to do. The title’s brevity and moderate difficulty make it perfect for the gamer who does not have that much time any longer, but would like to engage in a few adventures from time to time. The randomized movement patterns and par-, pro-, and dev- time limits also make it fun for those that like a bit of challenge.

I mean, really hard things. About Super Meat Boy-level hardness but in a stealth game, and everything is random. Well, not everything. Just the guard patterns (and that includes dogs as well). 

The first chapter was fun. The style is fantastic. I liked it--simple control scheme, basic objective, silly story. That was good. In the first chapter, the guard patterns can be irritating but not over-the-top rage-quitting. The guards have 4 stages of awareness of you--... awareness, which is just ""Is there something there?"". That fills up fast, and then you get ? awareness, which is where they come looking. Once ? fills up, you get !, which is where they run after you. If you can escape them and hide, they will have a red ? bar which will go down. If they see you during that time, it immediately goes back to !.

But once you get into the second chapter, there are guard dogs. 

Guard dogs have a gigantic scent radius all around them and a small sight radius in front of them. As soon as you touch the sight radius their question-mark bar starts going up fast. They can't catch you like regular guards, but they will bark, which draws guards. If you walk in the scent-radius, they will start following your footsteps. The only way to get rid of them on your trail is to ""run away"". Apparently this means just going really far away from them, but it's not clear about that, and running makes noise. The guard dogs have a low tolerance to noise. If they hear you running, they will fill up about a third of their ? bar. This makes it extremely difficult to actually get past them, especially if there's a security camera in the room. Then it's awful.

It's a simple stealth game, though simple does not equal easy.
one thing that makes thig game unique from other stealth games is that the guards from whom you have to hide from walk randomly meaning that they don't have a pattern, this of course adds a sense of suspence and surprise to the game as you're forced to make up your plan as you go, there's just no other option, because of this no two gameplays will be the same.
Many people in their review will complain about the random guard movements but that's what whistling or other gadgets are for in the game.
Whistling attracts a guard's attention and will make them go towards the noise, this means that although in general the guard's movements are random this is NOT a game of pure luck, you just need to know when to whistle and where, if you master that then you will be able to enjoy the game.
The story is simple and the two main characters are interesting each with unique features that change the way you play the game depending on who you pick.
The graphics are simple but that plays to its advantage as it has a nice comic book feel to it and of course because of that it's easy on the graphics cards which means that most if not all can buy and enjoy this game without stupid fps drop issues.
My only nitpick if I'd have to pick something here it would be the music.
It's pleasant however I do see it getting old after a while (but that's not a big deal considering you can just switch the music off and put your own music from your pc as the bgm)

And finally the overall satisfaction of the game... is good.
Sure, it's not a triple A title but there again it never advertised itself as some sort of jesus of games and it fully delivers what it promises.

The levels have two floors, and while you always start at the beginning of the last floor you failed at, the game only saves once a mission is completed, so don't quit before the level is completed and you're back at the mansion.

Overview: Isometric Stealth

The Good:

+ Great art style

+25 levels, each level has 2 stages

+ 3 playable character each with their own objectives and play style per level

+ The game does a good job visually presenting all dangers to you i.e enemy visions, lasers, camera etc. 

+ Each level has a ‘par time’ for replay ability

+ Great soundtrack that fits the atmosphere and art style

The Average:

If you are not interested in getting achievements, the game can be pretty short, if you are interested in achievements, the game can be pretty repetitive. 

Frustration can set in quick with this game as luck plays a big role in determining how fast and good you can complete levels. Enemy guard movement can be sporadic, its difficult to know which way they are going to go. On the one hand, it makes the game interesting and forces you to really rely on patience and timing, on the other hand, having a guard turn in the wrong direction, spotting you at the very last second just when you were about to exit the level can be rage inducing. 

Conclusion:

The Marvelous Miss Take is a fun little isometric stealth game that seems to have gone over looked in the steam community.  The premise of the game is easy enough to understand and so you can jump right into the game. It’s a fun game in short bursts. Check this game out if you are a fan of the genre.

The top down stealth style works quite well as you can get a nice look at the layout of each level and the randomized movements of the guards make you react on the fly instead of just memorizing their movement patterns and exploiting those. This leads to some moments where you will lead to some moments where you get completely screwed over but adds more tense moments to the game as you pray that guard doesn't turn around and see you. With most levels having a ""par time"" to beat, this makes some of your encounters intense as you need to race around and avoid detection instead of just sitting around too much. 

The level variety is good and having 3 different characters to choose from with different talents keeps the game from getting too stale. I was not overly thrilled with the enemy/obstacle variety (there are really only 4 kinds all game: guards, dogs, lasers, and security cameras) but the devs do a good job of mixing and matching those combinations in levels to keep you guessing.

Aside from the repetitiveness, there are two main issues. The first is the controls - they use click to move and sometimes, if you don't cick the exact right spot, the pathing gets all wonky and Miss Take will run somewhere  you don't want her to go, like right into a guard. Second, the guards do not have set paths, so there's really no learning that takes place, it's just a matter of waiting them out and hoping they go in a direction that doesn't screw you over.

You're quickly introduced to Sophia Take, the main character and find out that your Aunt had passed away and in her will she had left her art collection to Sophia. You then find out that Ralph Blackstock forges a new will and takes Sophia's Aunts entire art collection and your job is to get it back and prove he stole it from you.

Now the game is split into five chapters and each chapter is composed of five stages, to start with the stages are very basic. There are some cameras and a few guards patrolling the art gallery but as you continue they start using dogs and motion detecting lasers to try and stop you. You'll notice right away that Sophia is just your average thief, nothing too fancy; she can nimbly get away with nothing but her wits and whatever gadget the stage gave to you. As the stages get more complex you'll meet two new characters, Harry the Thief and Daisy the Pickpocket. Eventually these two characters join your party and help Sophia try and get her art collection back. Both of these characters play completely different and also have to complete seperate goals than the other two. Harry the Thief walks with a cane so he's slower than Sophia and Daisy but he can throw his trusty bouncy ball to distract guards and his missions are literal stealth missions; don't get caught at all because he can't escape easily. Daisy the Pickpocket is the fastest of the three and can walk around guards without alerting them, her missions are also drastically different; you have to steal keys from guards to open safes for cash rather than just stealing art and leaving.

This game definitely builds itself on basic but rock solid stealth mechanics - hiding, running (or walking) and stealing anything that isn't outright nailed down and then applies all of that to its extraordinary level design. On top of that the game has extremely simplistic controls, you can play it with just the mouse if you wanted to; or keyboard for movement and mouse for actions; or even just your controller. One downside is that there are no remapping controls, so if you don't have a controller and the default controls for keyboard & mouse bother you than you are out of luck.

Graphically there isn't anything to complain about, some might like the cartoony feel while others might hate it. I personally feel that it helps the game stand out amongst other games in the genre usually being dark rather than having that happy yet serious feel. Don't let the bright nature of this game fool you, it will take no mercy on you in the later stages.

Now the soundtrack for this game was phenomenal, it has that jazzy down to earth feel while you're slyly prowling around an art gallery trying your best not to get caught while you pilfer paintings or other priceless treasures.

Honestly The Marvelous Miss Take is a perfect example of how a stealth game doesn't need to be slow or tedious; how they can also be fast and lively, in a world of bright colours and memorable characters that don't need to have fifteen times the dialogue introducing them to be remembered. This game is as great as it's very own name states, it's just depressing no one really gives it the chance it deserves.

The difficulty curve isn't THAT bad, but it's just... unfun in the later stages. Depends way too much on luck; on one of the later stages, if a dog in the starting area went right instead of left, you'd lose a goddamn minute waiting for it to clear the coast, which simply isn't ok considering there are collectibles based on time limits.

      游戏流程不长， 游戏模式也比较简单，并没有通过过关获得的奖励来升级人物或者道具等成长元素，这一点可能让一部分人会失去玩下去的动力，我就单纯当做休闲的小游戏来玩，也避免了需要反复刷刷刷的情况。

      虽然是一款潜入游戏，游戏的画面设计却非常讨巧，简单而又可爱的卡通风格色彩鲜明，凸显轻松的风格，优雅的艺术品女大盗，踏着自己的步伐把一件件艺术品全部收回。游戏的BGM也充满了轻松的氛围，当收集到艺术品的时候刷刷刷的音效也让我听着很爽。
体来说这个游戏在休闲游戏中属于优秀的作品，原本就是为了让人轻松休闲的游戏确实能让人感到放松和愉悦。有一个有意思的细节，在家里切换人物的时候会产生很多有意思的对话可以让我们更多地了解人物，细心的玩家可以去收集一下哈哈哈。

The game stars the Sophia Take, an heiress whose aunt’s fortune (and more importantly, her art) is all stolen (via a forged will) by Ralph, an evil megalomaniac whose focus seems to be hoarding the art for himself rather than sharing it with THE PEOPLE. Sophia’s goal is to steal all the art back and expose Ralph for what he is.

Joining her on her quest are Harry, an older thief with a bum leg, and Daisy, a young, seemingly orphaned pickpocket who joins the team.

The game’s stealth gameplay is very simple – click to walk to a location, hold down the mouse button to run there, and use the right mouse button to throw a device (which varies by character and level) to distract or get around the guards. Ducking behind obstacles is automatic as long as you aren’t running, and the fields of view of all the guards are displayed via very simple and easy-to-understand visual displays.

The levels are all viewed from a top-down isometric perspective which is pretty heavily constrained around your character, meaning you’re exploring the level as you’re penetrating it. What makes this game unusual for a stealth game is that, contrary to most such games, the guards – both in the form of men and dogs – wander randomly through the level, meaning that you cannot rely on them to turn just the right direction or walk just the right way. This also means that waiting around can get you trapped between randomly wandering guards, so it pays to move quickly and to distract the guards to get them to go where you want them to go, either by showing yourself to them, making some noise, or by throwing a noise-making gadget.

Sophia’s goal in each level is to collect all the golden art pieces, set up on walls and pedestals, and then make it to the elevator or exit. Every level has two independent floors to it, and if you fail on the second floor, you start over at the start of that floor, not at the start of the level. On top of that primary goal, she has two secondary goals – she can break the glass around a special statue which appears once per floor, which attracts the attention of the nearest guard, or she can try and do a speed run through the level, completing it within a certain amount of time. In most of the levels, Sophia finds an item lying on a pedestal near the entrance that helps her clear the level – a noise-maker that can be thrown to distract guards, glue to stick them in place, a smoke bomb to obstruct their view, or a teleporter to skip past them.

If Sophia is spotted by the guards, she has to go hide before they catch her; if they catch her, you must start the floor over. Unfortunately, even if you are not captured, Sophia will drop her (very stylish) hat, which must be retrieved before she can complete the level.

Her two allies have slightly different gameplay. Harry always has the same item – a noise-making ball which bounces off the walls – wherever he goes, but as it is his lucky charm, he must collect it back up before completing a level. His missions take place at night in the same rooms that Miss Take’s missions take place in, but with a different setup of guards, and various barriers put in place to obstruct his route through the level. Unlike Sophia, he can’t run, but on the upside, he only has to collect three paintings per floor. His alternate goal is to make it through levels without being spotted by any guards or cameras.

Daisy has no special items at all to help her, but on the upside, she can walk right up behind guards without alerting them, and is the fastest character in the game. Like Harry, she plays in the same stages Sophia does, but with barriers up (though different ones than Harry, oftentimes), and with different guard setups. Daisy must pickpocket keys off the guards to unlock safes and retrieve deeds. The safes are alarmed, so Daisy must run away quickly after avoiding a safe to avoid getting caught. Her levels tend to be the most frustrating simply because the guards must be approached up close, and the safes always create intense situations. Like Sophia, her goal is to speed-run through every level, which is the hardest goal in the game due to the random movements of the guards, and can sometimes lead to extreme frustration.

Indeed, the game’s greatest flaw is its randomized nature. At times, the enemies will turn around and completely screw up your quickly thrown-together plan, and there are occaisions where you will simply be forced to reset a stage because guards randomly wander in through both ends of a hallway. Such events are sometimes your fault, but at other times, the random nature of the game can be quite annoying – especially when doing speed-runs as Daisy, who is pretty dependent on a good guard setup at times to complete her run in time.

The game’s other flaw is its repetitive nature. There are 25 stages, and all but one of them is played through by all three characters, leaving a total of 73 stages in all. However, there are very few mechanics in the game. There are the basic guards who wander around and are the only thing which can actually catch your character. There are security cameras which move automatically back and forth over a field of space, but which have blind spots which can be taken advantage of to sneak around; if you move into their field of view, they will alert the guards to your presence. There are dogs, who will sniff out your character if you are close to them, but which have a very restricted field of view; these canines will at time track you throughout the level if you don’t throw out something to distract them, and can at times feel very frustrating as they home in on you. If the dog catches you, it will bark at you, alerting the guards. Finally, there are lasers which periodically turn off and on, which set off an alarm alerting the guards if you stand on them.

That’s all there is, and it really shows, as the games’ levels don’t really exhibit much variety. Once the mechanics have all been introduced, you’ve seen all the game really has to offer, and the final levels are hard simply because they throw a large number of things at you all at once. While they’re interesting enough, they’re also the place where the random movements of the enemies are the most frustrating, as the large numbers of enemies populating many of those levels means there is more opportunity for you to get cornered. Thus, the game varies from kind of samey to kind of frustrating, and Sophia’s levels are by far the most enjoyable, as it is the first time through a set-up and her broader skill-set and larger number of objectives just feel like they flow better.

Overall, the game is pretty mediocre. The story is flimsy and not particularly interesting. The art style is quite nice – very deco – but isn’t enough to carry the game on its own, and while the core stealth gameplay is alright, it also starts to feel the same after a while.

Ultimately, this is a game best eaten in small bites – none of the levels are very long, with speed run times of four minutes or less which are readily achievable, and completing everything the game has to offer is likely to take only 12 hours or so. When the odd level is played here and there, it doesn’t wear on you so much, but when a lot are played consecutively, it tends to get kind of boring (or frustrating).

Really, though, I wouldn’t recommend it - it isn't a very substantive experience. While the game encouraging you to move quickly and distract foes actually gets rid of one of the worst parts about stealth games – boringly waiting around for a guard to walk by on the right portion of its pattern – it replaces it with the frustration of the RNG occasionally spoiling your run.",1452750199,1452750199,False,2,0,0.486169308423995972,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The one thing i didn't like about the game is that the guards walk in randomly generated paths, which on paper sounds like a great idea, but when you put it to practice, it's bad, since there's no set pattern, sometimes you have to remain hidden for several minutes because all the guards decided to walk in the same direction and corner you, i found myself restarting the levels a bunch of times because of this.

This is wrapped up in a slick presentation, which is sadly the game's greatest strength.

Sophia moves at a fairly slow pace and will automatically crouch behind waist-high objects--it's better to think of any waist-high objects as walls, since they effectively block vision cones in a similar way, though also preventing Sophia from running. Running produces a noise radius that alerts guards to your location, so it must be done outside of a certain distance from a guard. Additionally, Sophia occasionally collects gadgets, and can earn additional uses for these gadgets by looting art. This is a fairly smart system that rewards skilful play.

The problem, then, is the game's randomized AI. Randomized AI does not work very well for a game with light puzzle elements and time trials. Guards move in random directions, sometimes leaving the rooms they are stationed in. This randomized AI can put you in very unfavourable situations, sometimes (if you are extremely unlucky) as soon as the level starts. Often, they can put you in unwinnable positions even after collecting all the trophies, or waste a lot of your time. Completing heists can require several attempts to get lucky. Getting under par time also happens because you were lucky; the AI didn't put you in any strange situations, or you restarted each floor until you beat it with time to spare.

Dogs suck up all the fun with their presence. Their scent radius is huge and they will follow your trail around the entire map if you let them, putting you in unwinnable situations that force a restart. Dogs are very often placed in rooms with security cameras, which further reduces your mobility options and makes dogs a nightmare to deal with.

Miss Take isn't a very good stealth game. There are much better stealth games out there. Miss Take doesn't innovate, and it doesn't even iterate, either.

+ Snazzy jazzy soundtrack
+ Simple clean visuals
+ Daisy’s heists are generally quite fun
+ Open solutions, levels can be cleared in different ways using different paths
+ Lots of optional levels

- Levels all look and sound the same, repetitve
- Most optional levels are just reskins of campaign levels
- Very standard stealth gameplay, nothing really stands out or feels new
- Character abilities are very limited
- Successfully completing a heist often feels like the result of chance rather than skill, leading to frustration
- This chance leads to frequent failure, meaning having to replay missions again and again
- Harry’s missions are tedious and dull

I wanted to like The Marvelous Miss Take. I love stealth games, it had an awesome upbeat jazzy soundtrack, cool visual style, minimalist gameplay that’s quick to get into and quick to complete, and as cardboard cutout and cartoony as they were, I liked the characters. But the more I played the more I had to admit to myself that I just wasn’t enjoying the game. It’s a bizarre mix of frustrating and boring.

What I enjoy best about stealth games is two things. The first is the patient methodical observing and memorizing of guard movements and behaviors, exploring and finding the best paths to the goal, the trial and error of taking a risk, getting caught, revising strategies, and trying again until I get it right. I love the feeling of having finally outwitted, out snuck, outrun every guard by the end of the level, the feeling of having conquered using wits instead of brawn. The second is gadgets. The stealth genre is great at giving players all sorts of toys to play around with--noisemakers, sleep gas, night vision, zip lines, disguises, hacking systems, teleportation, invisibility.

Marvelous Miss Take is a stealth game. The goal of each ‘heist’ is to sneak through an art gallery, avoiding guards, cameras, and trip wires in order to steal and escape with various pieces of artwork. Levels are very small, consisting of only a few rooms, two floors, and a handful of guards. Most can be beaten in just a couple of minutes. 

The thing is, the guards don’t follow any set paths, more or less randomly wandering about the level. On the one hand, this is cool, because it leads to every playthrough of a level going a bit differently. There is an unpredictability to guard movements that’ll keep you on edge the whole time, as no area is safe. They can find you anywhere. Unfortunately, this also leads to frustration. Finishing a level is almost always dependent on luck. At the end of a heist, I almost never felt like I’d expertly outwitted a group of guards, because beating levels depends on things as trite as Guard 2 just happening to not patrol the room full of trip wires this go around, or maybe because one of the guard dogs happened to get stuck in a corner.

All the other times you fail often have less to do with mistakes you make and more to do with getting unlucky with where the guards decided to wander. The player doesn’t have many options for escaping when cornered. Besides a few limited use noise makers and smoke bombs, Sophia, the main character, has nothing in the way of cool gadgets for players to play with (with the exception of a teleporter that unfortunately only appears in a couple levels), and most levels don’t even have those. Difficulty ramps up pretty quick, and you’re going to fail heists, and you’re going to fail them over and over. Levels are very short, so you won’t end up replaying much. But when every level has the exact same visuals, guards, dogs, cameras, and goals, the game is repetitive enough already. Everything is very expected, all as per genre. You won’t find anything new here.

The developers do try to inject some variety into the gameplay with two other playable characters. Both are able to replay heists already completed with Sophia, but with some added challenges and abilities. The first is Harry, who is much slower than Sophia and has nothing to show for it except a noisemaker that is made useless because it has to be picked up after thrown. With Harry, you’ll be playing through the exact same level as with Sophia, stealing the same sort of artwork, except more slowly. It’s beyond tedious. 

The third playable character is Daisy, whose heists are easily the highlight of the game. Daisy is both faster and quieter than Sophia. Her heists strip down most of the extra fat in randomly wandering guards and dogs from Sophia’s missions, and instead involve her pickpocketing just two or three guards, and then using the keys to open alarm-rigged safes. I had a great time sneaking directly behind and beside guards to get their keys, and using strategy to draw them away from safes long enough to get in and out before the safe alarm sent the guards charging back to my position. It’s a shame her missions are so much shorter than Harry or Sophia’s. It’s the only time I felt like a professional cat burglar while playing.

At the end of the day, I’m not sure who this game is for. It has a cool style and soundtrack, the minimalism and bite-sized levels makes it easy to jump in and out of. But it has none of the things I usually look for in a stealth game. I expect casual players will be put off by the frustrating chance-laden levels, but I also expect fans of the genre will be disappointed by how limited the stealth gameplay is.

在这款游戏中，主角Miss Take要去各个艺术品展馆中偷取藏品，玩家需要操控这名窈窕淑女避开所有警卫和摄像头的视线取得宝物，然后潇洒离开。随着游戏的展开，艺术馆会出现更多的楼层，玩家还可以使用录音带等道具来引开警卫的视线，就算什么道具都不用，技艺精湛的Take也可以靠娴熟的口哨和小碎步来扰乱警卫的注意力。游戏为典型的俯视视角潜行游戏玩法，关卡式的设计辅以精美立体又充满女性美得画风和轻松活泼的BGM，使得The Marvellous Miss Take更侧重其休闲性。闲暇好时光，偷几幅名画来装点自己的小屋吧~

There are 25 galleries with two floors each ( the final mission actually has three floors), and the 3 playable characters have a different objective to perform in each mission so there is plenty to do.

[h1]Story[/h1]

The characters are ok, likeable but underdeveloped.

The game is charming but lacks variety.

There is no way to go back and review the story if you accidentally skip over something. ""Cutscenes"" are one and done.

Progression is fairly balanced, you have to do everything as the main character and a smaller number of levels as the two other playable characters.

[h1]Technical aspects[/h1]

The controls are a bit sloppy which can make a good run turn disasterous in a frustrating instant. You will probably find the use of a gamepad to be to your benefit.

The game is locked at 60fps which is ok but not great if you have a higher refresh monitor.

There are not a huge number of graphics options, but the game is simplistic enough visually to not need a ton.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Levels are well laid out and fun to walk around in.

There is very little motivation for getting all the side-acheivements unless you are trying to get every single one for the achievement in Steam. The DRM-free players will gain nothing from accomplishing the side missions which is disappointing. Unlockable costumes would have been a PERFECT reward for collecting these 

You can learn the levels and improve based on skill for the most part, occasionally a random walking pattern from a guard will throw things off, but such is life.

Levels are easy to fail, but they are short enough that you can attempt them in quick succession.

There are only four types of enemies (guards, guard dogs, cameras, and lasers), but the level design makes sure that these are all you need for enough variety. Some gamers WILL find it repetitive, while others will not.

The game is probably about 4-6 hours in length and probably 10 or so if you are trying to get all the acheivements. It may be much shorter if you are really great or decently longer if you are kind of bad.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

TMMT is a fun and lighthearted stealth game with simple mechanics that are easy to learn but difficult to master. If that sounds like what you are interested in, and the little bit of political griping isn't going to bother you (it's not as bad as I am making it sound) then this may be a game for you. I'd probably recommend the multiplayer Monoco over this, but Miss Take has a nice game on her own. At $20 the game is probably a little overpriced. I picked my copy up in a Humble Bundle, but in a Steam sale for around $5-7 I would say Miss Take is worth the price of admission.",1445967508,1446081330,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You are a woman - even if there are other secondary characters to play with during the game - you should inherit your aunt's art gallery works, but other art galleries take them from you and expose them, so you decide to steal them all to refill your gallery with what should be yours. I mean, you want to create an art gallery with stolen works, you can see how silly this idea is, but, well, the game want to set a nonsense spirit? I can be ok with it.

I could, at least, but everything else keep being silly and unsophisticated. In the game, you have to select a rival art gallery and raid it to steal everything inside it, in freaking full day, [b]during opening hours[/b]. Every single gallery has two floors, you enter the first floor, empty it, take the elevetor to the second floor, empty it, and take the exit door on the back of the second floor: the most unrealistic art gallery architecture I can imagine, even I could think of one better. They decided for this silly one and used it for every single level of the game.
You steal things while visitors are loking at them, they are ok with it, but don't you dare to steal the masterpiece of the floor or they'll call the guards! All the rest isn't important, just take it, they don't care!
So, immagine this woman getting in an art gallery, buying a ticket, putthing on a mask, and start stealing things inside the place while people are looking at them, then take the exit with a cargo of stolen works of art in her arms. I mean, how immersive can this be?

Feminists seem to like this game because, you know, strong female protagonist! Yay! What I want to ask is: if everything this thief woman does in the game is silly and unrealistic, maybe this is how the developers see a female thief, silly and unrealistic. I don't know how much feminist this can be.

By the way, I think something about the gameplay has to be said: [b]it's insanely boring[/b].
For starters, it's a gameplay suited for a touchscreen device, and, I mean, this is not a plus. Everything is repetitive, you do the same two things over and over in the same environments, the only thing which spice it up is the guards placement. I really don't believe that a difficulty only created by a different placement of enemies can make a game fun.

[h1]Conclusions:[/h1]
Do you ever dream about going in an Art Gallery during opening hours stealing everything that's inside it? Too silly? Well you can do it in this game! Yay!
You could even have fun if you like semplicistic, repetitive gameplay!

I rate this 7 of 10. This is initially a very good game with great stealth mechanics that, after its first half, actually feels too long and becomes a chore if you want to complete it. The global achievement stats are a testament to that, [b]only 2.6% have completed it[/b] (normal ""story mode"" completion, not with all the extra stuff you can do in the game). That compares to [b]42.7% who have gotten the first achievement[/b], which is not a trivial one. All this is almost one year after its release. Many people seem to like the game (for good reasons) and play it to a considerable extent, but only very few finish it. (The phenomenon is ofcourse natural and can be seen with other games, too, but much weaker. This game makes most people give up on it, much more than other games.)
[list]
[*]If you are a normal gamer who doesn't mind abandoning a game at the point where it gets tedious, this is fun for a while.
[*]If you are a gamer who likes to at least play to the end, this game drags on and the difficulty is far beyond the nice and friendly game that it seems to be in the beginning. Restarting and hoping for better random conditions will happen alot. The game is good enough to have kept me playing to the end, though.
[*]If you like to complete the game with all achievements and extra stuff like beating par times on each level, then be prepared for some frustration over the imprecise controls when things become hectic, the randomness and the lots and lots and lots of restarting a level. I persevered and did even that, but was it fun? Some moments yes, alot of the times no. I feel a little sorry about the amount of time I poured into this, but I didn't want to stop at a 85% finished game. Now I'm glad to uninstall it even though there are some ""pro"" and ""dev"" time limits left to beat.
[/list]
Also I don't like how the game never stays at a smooth frame rate (probably for everyone, check the forums), even though I'm far above the system requirements. I'll have to assume this is due to bad programming and misuse of middleware. When you're running on too many layers of software, performance and timing problems are likely to happen. The slight stuttering doesn't ruin the game though.

Finishing with the positive things, this game has nice stylish graphics, and great music that fits the style. And the gameplay is really nice, the stealth mechanics are well done and you are never unclear about what's going on and why a guard has ""caught your scent"". The difficulty ramps up smoothly, so the point where it starts to become tedious will depend on your tolerance and skill.

Dovrete sfuggire alle guardie, telecamere, cani, laser, allarmi e perfino npc random ci volteranno le spalle in quest'impresa!
Al fianco di Sophia arriveranno Harry, un vecchio ladro zoppicante (probabilmente usare lui equivale alla modalità 'difficile' del gioco, non potendo correre) e la scaltra Daisy (l'equivalente della modalità 'facile', con lei potrete praticamente toccare le guardie per sottrarre loro le chiavi delle cassaforti, senza che quasi se ne accorgano e correre via velocemente!)

Non faranno MAI lo stesso percorso, questo potrà sia farvi sclerare con ""ma che cavolo, non eri là prima brutto idiota!"" per poi passare a ""Pffff come è stato facile questo livello!""

- Impegnativo, non potete fare cose a caso (soprattutto per quanto riguarda gli archivi)
- Personaggi diversi con diversi obiettivi (nonostante i livelli da affrontare sono gli stessi)

Have you played/seen anything on Volume (Game by Thomas is Alone guy)? This is basically Volume - with a few changes. It noteably came before Volume.

Miss Take is a stealth game whereby you play one of 3 characters attempting to complete one of the 25 missions.  You play from an isometric-ish standpoint and must sneak around the levels and steal stuff. While each character share the same levels as the others, the levels for each character have different layouts and challanges and merit playing as each characters.

PROS:
- Amazing art style. Really, really great.
- Great sense of difficulty. It is never too easy or throw-your-controller difficult.
- All 3 characters have their own play styles. 
------Take is the ""normal"" character and must steal around 12 paintings/objects per floor.
------Hector cant run and has a ball used to bounce off walls to distract guards and dogs, but he must get it back.
------The third charcter must pickpocket guards to get keys to open safes (which WILL cause an alarm).
- Each mission has multiple floors per building.
- A good amount of missions.

Cons
- It is minor, but the menus are confusing as to what option you are actually choosing if using a controller.
- Unlike Volume's 100+ levels along with an editor, this only has 25 missions x 3 charcters. Not really complaining though.

각 스테이지마다 눈에 불을 켜고 감시하고 있는 경비들의 눈을 피해다니며 곳곳에 놓인 귀중품을 훔치는 게임이다. 

맵을 지키고 있는 경비병들과 경비견들의 움직임은 랜덤이다. 딱히 정형화 된 패턴이 있는 것이 아니라 플레이가 뻔해지지 않은 점은 좋지만, 이로 인해 운빨의 여지가 생겨버린다. 같은 판을 플레이해도 운이 좋게 쉽게 클리어할 수 있는가 하면, 시작지점에 서있기만 해도 들켜버리는 어처구니 없는 경우가 생겨버리기도 한다. 이 점에 대해서는 플레이하는 이들이 받아들이기 나름일 듯 하다. 일단 본인은 만족.

그리고 이런 게임들이 항상 가질수밖에 없는 특징이 하나 있는데, 바로 지정된 시야 범위가 아니라면 절대 보지 못한 것으로 인식해버린다는 것이다. 따라서 바로 등뒤나 옆에 있어도 절대 들키지 않는 경우가 많은데 이를 잘 활용하면 꽤나 멋진 플레이가 나오며 게임 플레이에도 큰 도움이 된다. 게임의 시스템 상 어쩔 수 없는 부분이겠지만, 플레이어의 실력에 따라서는 덩치만 큰 경비원들을 눈깔 해태에 시각장애인, 장님 리신에 맹인 후지토라로 만들어버릴 수도 있다.

총 25개의 스테이지가 준비되어 있다. 적어보일수도 있겠지만 같은 스테이지를 다른 캐릭터로 플레이할 수 있어 실제로 즐길 수 있는 스테이지는 73개 정도라고 보면 된다. 은신을 위주로 하는 절뚝이 해리와 경비원의 열쇠를 절도하고 금고를 따는 소매치기 데이지가 준비되어 있으며, 같은 스테이지를 다른 방식으로 즐길 수 있어 새로운 재미가 있다.

Soviel zur Story, die prinzipiell über Zeitungsartikel (nach erfolgreichen Raubzügen) weitergetrieben wird. Aufwändige Zwischensequenzen oder gar eine Vertonung gibt es nicht, dafür im Spiel selbst eine knallbunt-poppige, aber durchaus passende Comicgrafik.
An insgesamt 25 Orten, die sich alle sehr ähnlich sind, muss unsere Protagonistin nun Gemälde, Statuen und sonstigen Kram einsammeln und ihrer Sammlung einverleiben. Später bekommt sie Hilfe durch einen Meisterdieb und eine Taschendiebin (Daisy), die die bereits freigespielten Orte auf ihre Art und Weise durchstreifen dürfen. Für das Erreichen des Spielendes sind beide aber optional.

Jeder der Drei spielt sich vollkommen unterschiedlich: Miss Take sammelt das meiste Beutegut und das beschwingt im Vorbeigehen, während es besondere Beute unter Glasvitrinen gibt. IMMER sind dabei Erd- UND Obergeschoss abzuklappern. Der Alte humpelt und kann nicht rennen und spielt sich daher weitestgehend entschleunigt. Er ist des Nachts unterwegs und muss auch nicht mehr als 3 Bilder pro Etage mitnehmen. Das Spiel bewirbt sich mit dem Begriff  ""Stealth"" und dies trifft am ehesten auf Daisy zu. Sie muss sich an jede Wache heranpirschen, Tresorschlüssel klauen und damit dann je nach Level 2 bis 5 Tresore öffnen, die beim öffnen zudem einen fiesen Alarm auslösen. 

Das klingt jetzt erstmal recht entspannend und genau das Richtige für einen Raub zwischendurch. Dem ist aber nicht so. Gewalt gibt es keine, Hilfsmittel sind kaum vorhanden (und schon gar nicht in jedem Level) und dann auch nur entweder ein Recorder mit Katzenjaulen, Kleber, Rauchbomben oder ganz selten auch mal ein Teleportgerät. Die Wachen laufen Zufallswege ab und besitzen einen umfangreichen Sichtkegel. Dazu gesellen sich später Kameras, Hunde mit einer fiesen feinen Spürnase und Laserfallen. Und gerne auch mal alles zusammen... Sofern man sich normal bewegt, ist man ist unhörbar, beim Laufen wiederum erzeugt man Geräusche, die die Wachen anlocken können. Die Aufgabe ist es also, einen gewissen ""Flow"" zu entwickeln, um schnellstmöglich und ohne entdeckt zu werden die Beute einzusammeln. Jeder Ort besitzt eine Bestzeit, die es zu knacken gilt und es ist immer zu bedenken, dass es 2 Stockwerke auszurauben gibt (wobei das erste eigentlich immer das schwerste ist). Man kann es aber natürlich auch langsamer angehen lassen. Wie auch immer, in späteren Levels braucht es durchaus 30-50 Wiederholungsversuche (wobei der Stockwerkswechsel glücklicherweise einen Checkpoint darstellt). Hier ist es mit Können allein nicht getan, man braucht auch viel viel Glück, dass die Wachen oder Kameras grad mal in eine andere Richtung schauen, die Laser nicht eben dann anspringen, wenn sich eine Wache umdreht oder wenn man inmitten von Lasern steht, nicht noch ein Hund die Witterung aufnimmt. Man kann zwar Alarm auslösen, muss dann aber schnell das Weite suchen und sich hinter Gegenständen verstecken. Dies kann manchmal auch zur Taktik gehören, um Wachen wegzulocken. Das kann aber auch nach hinten losgehen, wenn drei Mann angelaufen kommen und sich in den Sichtkegeln kein Versteck mehr anbietet. 
Mann, was habe ich bei dem Spiel geflucht, bis sich die Balken gebogen haben und dann doch frohlockt, wenn wieder eine Bestzeit geknackt wurde! Wenn man es mit Wachen im Nacken doch noch zum Ausgang geschafft hat.... DAS sind die Momente, die das Spiel ausmachen! 
Soll aber auch heißen, dass Miss Take eben kein ""Casualgame"" ist, sondern dass aus einem 2-Minuten-Raubzug auch mal 45 Minuten werden können... Frustresistenz und Durchhaltewillen muss man hier auf jeden Fall besitzen, sonst kann man das Spiel direkt in die Ecke packen. 

Gesteuert wird übrigens erstaunlich einfach nur mit der Maus und es kommt auch nur die linke Maustaste zum Einsatz. Ein Klick = gehen, Maustaste gedrückt halten = rennen. Der Mauszeiger gibt das Ziel vor. Aufsammeln geht automatisch, bei Vitrinenkunst und Tresoren braucht es 1-2 Sekunden, bis der Bruch getan ist (auch automatisch). Easy!

Die Grafik ist wie oben erwähnt im Comicstil, passt zum Spiel, reißt aber keine Bäume aus. Die Musik bewegt sich im Bereich Jazz-Swing-Trip-Hop, nervt zwar nicht, könnte auf Dauer aber abwechslungsreicher sein. Möchte man alles erreichen, sollte man rund 15 Stunden Spielzeit einplanen.

Miss Take ist jetzt nicht MEIN Spiel des Jahres 2015, aber in einem Steam-Sale kann man es durchaus mal mitnehmen! Für mehr Eindrücke einfach mal die beiden Trailer auf der Shopseite anschauen, da wird alles auch gezeigt.

Todo el mundo conoce este tipo de mecánica; huye de la gente que pueda verte y consigue llegar al final del nivel. Muchos juegos con esa mecánica, pocos tan divertidos como este. 

Te despiertas siendo Sophia Take, una antigua adinerada, por desgracia, ahora desheredada. Tu misión es volver a todas las mansiones de un hombre el cual se me ha olvidado su nombre, y robarle todo lo que puedas. El juego consta de un total de 25 niveles. Por el camino, te toparás con otros dos ladrones, muy carismáticos también para volver a recorrer los 25 niveles con ellos, buscando cuadros diferentes con cada uno. Es como si de por si, el juego tuviera 75 niveles. Por supuesto, son totalmente rejugables. Te llevará mucho rato conseguir el total de cada nivel. Algunos muy fáciles, otros un tanto enreversados. Es un acierto que los guardias tengan una ruta aleatoria, porque así le da más frescura, y cambia el nivel de dificultad de estos. Lo que echo de menos es tener una variedad más amplia de escenarios, es decir, todos los robos transcurren en los mismos gráficos de mansión. Echo de menos un ""crea tus niveles"". Le vendría muy bien, y poder compartirlos con la gente. Tiene un sentido del humor justo. Algunos juegos se pasan de querer hacer gracia, y acaban haciendo lo contrario. Otros, son demasiado lineales. Una banda sonora de Jazz años 50 bastante pegadiza, animada y variada. La verdad que le viene que ni pintao' al Marvellous Miss Take.

+ Sentido del humor totalmente acertado
+ Rejugable al máximo
+ Música a piano muy fresca
+ Historia diferente
+ Gráficos suficientes
+ Acertada subida de dificultad mediante avanzas en el juego

Cons:
- Echo en falta un modo de crear niveles
- Que el juego transcurra en una sola mansión (respecto a los gráficos)
- SI se compra en Steam, el precio puede ser un poco alto
- Corta duración si no te lo pasas al 100% (o intentarlo, por lo menos)

First of all, I really like that kind of games. They are casual and should be fun, not to easy but on a decent level of difficulty.

Back to that game... the [b]storyline is a bit... meh[/B], but would not disqualify that game at all.

[h1][b]Example[/b][/h1]
I give you an ingame expamle. One of the main abilities, of all characters, is to make a noise, which attracts a guards attention. If you play by mouse you have to click and hold on your character and this becomes worse when you try to rush through a level just to be in time (with the char Miss Take) AND that causes [b]frustration which is unnecessary[/b].

Making a noise by keyboard would be much more comfortable, while navigating with the mouse. Yet I haven't tested the game with my x360 controller, so I can't give a feedback about that.

I would say this is about right. The story is that Sophia Take has had her family's art collection stolen from her by what she suspects is a forged will. Thus, she goes out to ""repatriate"" her collection. Along the way, she finds Harry Carver who is a well-known art thief and Daisy a young pick-pocket. They help Sophia uncover the plot and recover the art. 

Yeah, it is cliche, but the game is fun. It is played through 25 levels (the first is a tutorial only Sophia can do). Each level is a multi-story building owned by Ralph Blackstock the wealthy magnate who took the art. Sophia must avoid the guards and the cameras as shown by a sight cone. If spotted, the guards will come and investigate. The cameras, they just emit a screeching alarm that attracts all the guards that can hear it. Along the way Sophia can use gadgets (a noise maker - used to create localized noise; a smoke bomb - to hide your movement; a teleporter - to, well, teleport; and a glue bomb - to slow guards and dogs). As you collect loot the gadgets will recharge. Dogs, have a scent cone along with the sight cone. If you are in their scent envelope they will become attracted to you and start following your smelly foot prints (there are actually smelly foot prints you leave behind). Get far enough ahead and you can loose the dogs. If not, they will bark and bark and bark until the guards come. In addition, Sophia can collect masterpieces. There is one on each level. However, when the bystanders see you break the case they will go get a guard.

Each of the other two characters play differently. The building floorplans are the same; however, there may be gates blocking ways you were able to go with Sophia. Harry, known as the fox, has a bum knee so he can't run. To compensate, he has a bouncer gadget that has unlimited charges. When he throws it at an object it will make a noise. But Harry will never leave a level without it. If you can get through the entire level without a guard or a camera seeing you (the bounce and your cane tap is allowable) you are the ghost and receive and extra bonus. Harry also only operates at night.

Daisy is a pickpocket. She first must take keys from the guards, then open up safes to relieve them of their documents and money. Problem is once the safe is open a loud alarm attracts the guards who can hear. She, like Sophia, also has a par time to beat for an extra bonus.

What are these extra bonuses? They are more pieces of art that ordain the walls of Sophia's gallery. As she takes the main pieces and displays them, each of the bonuses will put a little picture (or two in Sophia's case) above the main portrait. This is a nice little touch by the developers. The gallery is also the level select menu.

So, how does it play? I used an XBox controller. The developers originally didn't have controller support - this was added in an update. Other than me confusing buttons occasionally, the control scheme worked well. I don't know how it plays using the keyboard and mouse.The graphics are stylized like comics and it does work well. Occasionally, there is an issue with the camera and not being able to see if you truly are out of the sight cone. But this doesn't happen often. The camera can be moved with the second analog stick (if you remember to do that). 

One of the biggest challenges is that the guards do not have set routes. They have random movement. This may make the levels seem to be based on luck. While sometimes it seems the guards are attracted to you, other times they do turn the other way. If they see you, you start the floor over, no other penalty. Notice, I said floor. If you have cleared the first floor with an awesome time and get caught right before the exit, you only have to start the second floor over. Your time, masterpiece count, ghost all remain as they were. Nice touch to prevent unnecessary travels through a level. I had a hard time with Daisy. I did complete all her levels and was working on the par times. However, this became increasingly frustrating for me and I didn't make that the focus. Some of her levels took me a clock time of over five minutes and probably real time close to twenty. There are eight levels I didn't par with Daisy and I don't see myself going back. 

I had the most fun with Harry's levels because these were true stealth - no time limit and not be seen by the guards. Sophia's stealth is where the ""action"" comes in, especially trying to beat the par time. You are moving as quickly as you can grabbing the treasure and avoiding detection. It is fun, but in its own way. 

All-in-all a very fun experience.",1426946951,1426946951,True,35,0,0.787791311740875244,1,False,False,False,False,,,

The fact that the guards actions are unpredictable makes the game especially entertaining to do as you are always having to think whilst in movement, to stop you from being caught. The game creates a vast sense of tension during your heist- with a game like this it really depends on your style of gameplay, as it is a stealth game- you have a few types of dealing with the guards; you can either lure the guards to investigate your current location as you swiftly move in the other direction, or you can simply wait for the guards to start to patrol- a very stealthy way to make yourself across the map. 

Sadly, you cannot get the feel of this game by watching the trailer or gameplay videos on youtube; it is better to simply get hands on. If you have played other games like this then there is no doubt you 'll like it.
There are only two bad thing I have noticed with this game so far is that the tutorial lulls you into a false sense of security before you start the proper game- where it begins to make the maps more complicated and the guards' actions more unpredictable. Secondly, the avatar moves at a very slow pace, but it is not too much of an issue as so do the other characters- guards. As of yet I have noticed no bugs and there is no issues with the gameplay

The artwork is superb, it may not have the brilliant graphics of Crysis 3 at maximum, but it is very artistic and brightly coloured and has an almost cartoony look to it.  Full controller support is very appealing to a game like this as it allows people to easily work through the game if they tend to consoles more themselves.

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys stealth games and likes thinking on their feet. If you have a slow mind and cannot cope with fast paced situations I do not recommend this game to you as it requires you to move if the guards see you, not just hide. If you have never played a stealth game before I reccomend this game as a starter for you amateurs.

If you're into pure stealth experiences The Marvellous Miss Take certainly knows how to please.  I myself am often found crouched in the shadows, stuffing things into my pockets, being the creep that I am.  And, as such, I can tell you what makes a great stealth game.  An adequate stealth game gives you steady feedback on how visible you are at any given time and makes it clear how alert your opponents are.  A good stealth game is all about cunning movement, where actively removing threats is impossible or undesirable.  A great stealth game takes all of the above, adds a heap of character, and then does something you've never quite seen before.  Miss Take is a great stealth game.

Like spitting into the hair of a tall guy a couple rows in front of you in a dark and crowded movie theater, The Marvelous Miss Take is a pure stealth experience.  You cannot incapacitate guards and your goal is to get the loot and get out without being caught.  If you get caught, you lose.  

However, where Miss Take really shines is in its focus on getting into and fleeing from danger.  You could take your time on every level and get through the game easily.  But if you want to get through well, you'll have to beat the par times for each level.  This might sound awful to old stealth hats, but the game doesn't punish you for being seen as long you can get away.  And as anyone who has run naked down a public street of a major city knows, that has some veracity (provided you have no obvious tattoos or weird scars).  In fact, being seen is a great way to get the guards to stop patrolling near the loot and come stomping to where you decided to give them a show (as most fellows will).  At least this is how it plays for two of the characters.

What!?  Multiple characters and playstyles?  Take a minute to collect your popped monocle, reader.  Yes, Miss Take has three characters that play quite differently.  With the eponymous Miss Take you have to collect all the paintings in each level and you are usually given some sort of tool to help: smoke bombs to hide, noise makers to distract guards, a teleporter to move quickly to where you throw it, etc.  However, if somebody notices you and you run for it, she'll drop her hat, which you have to get back before you exit, making drastic evasion riskier.  Her extra goals are to beat a par time and collect loot behind display cases you have to smash (alerting anyone nearby).  

Your first ally is a more traditional thief, who can't run but has no par time to beat.  Your optional goal is to take your time and not be seen.  His inclusion was especially nice, since that's the sort of trimming-a-bonzai-tree, patient experience I play stealth games for and lets aficionados of the genre feel like they can ease out of their comfort zone.  

And finally, the third is a teenage pick-pocket who has to get up close to a guard, stay there for long enough to snatch a key and then unlock a safe that will set off a blaring alarm.  She has no tools, but she doesn't drop her hat when she springs into action like a kangaroo wearing moon shoes.  Once again, the goal is to do it quick (certainly not what she said).

This plays out over 25 levels, which you will go through once for each character with minor changes for each one.  Much like the interiors of our protagonists' purses, it's an impressive amount of content.  And the difficulty most certainly rises to meet your mounting skills (oh my!), with later levels adding threats like security cameras, dogs that will pick up your scent, and lasers that will limit your movement.  Add these to the basic threat of guards with random movement patterns, and you have yourself a challenge, sir.  

Fortunately, the game also gives you tools to deal with the rising chaos.  Miss Take's tools are obvious, but each character can make a sound to draw guards to the area; controlling their movement for a time (and without breaking the stealth bonus for our traditional thief).  This is essential, since while random patrols provide a pleasant risk, it would be terrible if you had to wait for them to move into or out of the ideal position for half an hour while the RNG has declared the order of the day is back and forth like the ping pong savants' international tournament for obsessive compulsives.

And if this extensive love letter to Miss Take isn't enough, the aesthetic of the game is perfectly fitting a game about art and the acquisition thereof.  The soundtrack is stellar, with a good selection of lovely hard bop jazz.  The models are fairly simple, but the animation is good looking and lively and the use of bright colors make sure Miss Take looks timeless rather than basic.  The characterization of our heroes is strong and - despite their seemingly misanthropic profession - they're made quite likable, like a bunch of posh Robin Hoods, in comparison to the completely deplorable villain.  The game isn't terribly verbose (unlike me), but the dialogue that is there is often witty and enjoyable.

Miss Take does have her worts, they're just small and mostly out of sight (like behind the knee or something).  Despite the quantity of levels and the small efforts to make differences between them for each of the characters, the setting for every level is the same style of art gallery.  Only the layout and time of day changes.  Graphics options are pretty solid, but it gets a little funny about the resolution when alt+tabbing out of the game.  You can't fine tune the volume controls or rebind keys.  I found using pure mouse control to be less than smooth, but using the keyboard to walk fixed that (the 360 controller also works).  And the glue tool has some problems.  For some reason glued enemies would stay alert and constantly aware of my position until the glue ended, causing some problems.  But really, if Miss Take were a painting, the stain of these would only amount to a single drop of coffee from the spit-take at how otherwise amazing it is. 

So, yeah, The Marvelous Miss Take is easily the best stealth game I have played in some time.  Worth twenty dollars?  Maybe, if you just need your skulking in shadows fix.  I'd probably recommend waiting until it goes on sale for ten bucks.  But absolutely get it then.  If stealth is your thing, you won't be disappointed.  If stealth isn't your thing?  Well, Miss Take won't go out of her way to court you, but if you meet her halfway, she might provide you a chance to get into it (ba-zing).

You need to avoid their line of sight and avoid making loud footsteps to get past them.  Miss Take meets two friends and you can play as either of them as well.

Pros: 

Lots of fun, its a bit Portal-like but with easier puzzles.
The music is this hip jazzy sound that builds a fun atmosphere.
The puzzles can be challenging, but not too challenging.
There's some map re-use, but always with a twist so it doesn't feel like you're re-playing the same map.
Super cute graphics!
Gadgets are fun, especially the teleporter.
Everything is subtitled and all sounds like footsteps have visual representations so this game should be deaf player friendly.

Cons:

The guards move randomly, so sometimes you'll enter a map and not have much of a chance to win because of how it starts off because their starting pattern is too tough to break through. >.< 
I often had to do the same map five or six times to beat it, ymmv of course.

A Youtube review by [b]Nerd Cubed[/b][url=]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OncEz1VSVxs[/url]

[h1]General[/h1]
This game is really [b]beautiful[/b] because it is exectued well, well thought out, and has some great design on display. Really, it was just a delight to play not only due to the feast of visual communication (okay, disclaimer, I'm a graphic designer) but it was also fun and engaging. Plus it has a very fun and silly title.

The Marvellous Miss Take is a stealth game with no violence whatsoever. You fail if you are spotted and caught. There is no blackjack to hurt people with, no blood, no weapons. It's a breath of fresh air.

My time of 16 hours of play represents a game which I've finished all the achievements on. There is still more playtime on offer if one wanted to beat all of the Pro times and then all of the Dev times on two of the characters (which I will probably do over time because I love this game).

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
There are three characters which you play each level with, but each character requires you to play in a slightly different manner. You will find yourself trying different strategies and doing some gentle thinking. The objective is to pinch all of the loot without being caught!

You hide behind objects and walls from the guards (who have an area of vision cone). There are some little gadgets you will have on some levels that make life a little easier. Then there are also masterpieces to steal, dogs to avoid, laser beams, noise, safes, and miles and miles of red rugs.

Some of the levels are really very tricky if you're trying to complete them within the par time. However, I should note that it is not a requirement to complete them within a set time if you want to be a really casual player. The times do count toward an achievement, but that's all.

Finally, I really like the way that the levels work. Whenever you go onto a new floor (usually 2 floors, sometimes 3) and then you fail, or do something silly, or get really unlucky, when you hit restart you restart the floor and not the entire level. I've appreciated that an awful lot over the course of 16 hours.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
All done with the mouse. It can be a little tricky getting your character around tight corners at a run. Takes a bit of practice. Left click makes you move to that point, and holding the left mouse button makes you run towards the cursor.

[h1]Storyline[/h1]
There is a minimal storyline. It's not a deep story, but it does successfully set up a reason as to why you're going around pinching all this stuff.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Fantastic. The music is very good, to the point where I know I'm ready to play another session when I start humming the music to myself. I played the entire game with the music on.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Exceptional to my mind. Okay, so there could possibly be a few more little details and variety. For example, in the level selection house each level could have a unique painting instead of recycling graphics. However, the design is very good and everything fits together seamlessly to create a styalized world of house layouts to pilfer.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[b]+ no violence[/b]
[b]+ exceptional design[/b]
[b]+ engaging and enjoyable music[/b]
[b]+ simple controls[/b]
[b]+ play as casual as you want to, or challenge yourself with times[/b]

Ich versuche mich reviewtechnisch der Abwechslung halber mal mit einer Übersichtsliste:

Pro:
+ Stealth-Game mit Eine-Hand-in-Hose-Maussteuerung
+ 3 spielbare Hauptcharaktere, die jeweils andere Missionsziele haben
+ Nette strahlende Comic-Grafik
+ Random-KI funktioniert herausfordernd gut
+ Holt einen immer wieder ins Spiel rein (""Das muss doch zu schaffen sein"")

Contra:
- Vom Grunddesign immer dieselben Levels - alle aus der Recycling-Fabrik immer wieder bis zum Umfallen neu verwurstet
- Spielprinzip von Level zu Level absolut identisch (Etage leerräumen, 1000 Wachen ausweichen, Ausgang suchen, nächste Etage, usw...)
- Neue Features und Side-Characters täuschen nicht darüber hinweg, dass das Spiel von der Basis her nicht sehr ideenreich ist
- Random-KI ist aber auch gleichzeitig irgendwie unheimlich nervig
- Viel zu viel platzierte Gegner mit teilweise riesigen Sichtkegeln
- Nervige Hunde (wenn man die Dinger bloß bewusst machen könnte! *argh*)
- Keine Story
- nach ca. 30 Mins Spielzeit hatte ich schon wieder die Schnauze voll

Grundsätzlich irgendwie empfehlenswert - aber nachdem ich mehrmals festgestellt hat, dass es weder dauermotivierend ist, noch der Spaß regiert, gibt's von mir leider einen Daumen runter.

The Marvellous Miss Take is such a phenomenal stealth game that it seems to have snuck by just about everyone.

Terrible puns aside, Miss Take is likely one the most tragically passed by game of 2014, and one of its absolute bests. An isometric stealth game starring a feisty redhead who’s inherited art has been stolen away, it better understands the fundamentals of what make a brilliant stealth game than nearly anything I’ve ever played.

It builds itself upon basic but rock solid mechanics - hiding, running, and pilfering anything that isn’t nailed down - and then applies them to ingenious level designs to stretch them to their absolute limits. Miss Take is immediately accessible without ever feeling dumb, giving you tools you understand but finding endless ways to constantly force you to rethink how you can apply them to a situation.

There was never a moment in Miss Take where I was stagnant. There was always some guard I needed to avoid, some artwork I had to shove into my Mary Poppins-like hat, some pathway I needed to find a way through. It avoids making you feel as if you have to wait the way so many stealth games do, always urging you forward and forcing you to play better. I failed a LOT during my time with the game, but it was always do to a stupid move I’d made or an alarm I hadn’t taken into account, and never once did I want to stop because of it.

Miss Take is so incredibly rewarding and satisfying that getting caught during a heist was almost inconsequential, causing me to lose a moment or two of playtime but in that showing me a way I could better approach a level. With the lack of preset guard patterns I also never got tired of replaying levels, as each attempt changed just enough to give me something new to worry about without completely casting aside the knowledge I had gained from previous attempts.

And knowledge is never something Miss Take makes any attempt to hide from you. There’s a continual stream of information being sent to you from every object and obstacle in a level, from a guard’s field of view to whether or not you’re hidden to how much sound any action you perform will make. It’s all right before you at every moment of play, and it’s displayed in a way that’s instantly comprehensible and even stylistic, matching the games ridiculously slick art design as it all blends together under a fantastically jazzy soundtrack.

Miss Take is the kind of game that shows why stealth games don’t have to be slow or tedious; how they can be fast and lively and organic, full of bright colors and delightful characters that were more endearing to me than games with tens of times more dialogue ever managed. The Marvellous Miss Take is as exceptional as its name declares, and it’s immensely depressing how few seem to have given it the chance so they could realize it.

This is a fun game, and very easy to pick up. The controls are simple, and all the information you need is presented very clearly. You always know exactly what the field of view for all the guards, cameras and (eventually) dogs are. The levels are pretty different, causing you to really examine the best way to approach each challenge, and the three characters all play very differently, with different goals and methods to achieve them.

The art is great. Attractive, bright, colorful, fun. The only complaint I'd make is that the levels look pretty samey after a while, but that's a minor complaint, and perhaps keeping the same art style is good since it lets you focus on the elements you need to be focusing on in order to complete each level, as opposed to admiring the art.

It's a surprisingly hard game. Reviews I've seen make a big deal out of the unpredictability of the guards and that is one element of the difficulty, but it's all of the elements combined. Navigating around everything quickly and quietly to achieve your goal is difficult and the game forces you to take calculated risks at times.

In most stealth games, you have to sit around waiting while guards walk by, slowly memorizing their scripted paths. Being seen often results in either instant failure or a firefight, rendering the stealth gameplay frustrating or pointless. But in Miss Take, guard movement is randomized, so you're encouraged to think on your feet rather than watch and wait. Distract guards by whistling or throwing a noisemaker, toss a teleporter or a smoke bomb to dart past undetected, and even allow yourself to be seen to lure guards from their posts (then silently sneak over to steal that painting they were standing in front of). The cone-of-vision system and the ""ripples"" representing sound remove any questions about whether you could REALLY be seen or not, so getting spotted never feels unfair - heck, usually you're letting yourself get spotted on purpose! And even once you've been spotted too long and alarmed the guards, you still have a chance to hide or get away before being caught, so even failing a level feels completely fair and skill-dependent.

The game is comparatively short, but with the randomization, three different styles of stealth play, and the addition of challenges and par times, replay value is pretty high - not to mention its visual style and sound design are an absolute joy. If you love the Sly Cooper series, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine, or characters like Carmen Sandiego and Cate Archer from No One Lives Forever 2, give The Marvellous Miss Take a try!

Final Note: I found the mouse controls very intuitive once learned and great for my setup (I have a Microsoft Surface and the attachable keyboard can be finicky, so a game that doesn't rely on it is fantastic), but the game also supports WASD and controllers.

The game is original, has more style in one pixel than most games do in an entire screencap, the characters are engaging and the writing okay.  All these qualities pall the fifteenth time youattempt a level because, well, you had every trophy and were headed to the exit nd two guards just decided to both turn at once and box you in.

Miss Take stands out amidst the gloomy atmospheres of other recent stealth games thanks to lighthearted humor and a positive attitude. I like the variety of challenges and the “easy to learn, tough to master” feel that makes it fun to replay the levels. 

There are a few spots that could use improvement, though. The focus on aiming for better times is problematic due to the random movements of the guards. Pure luck often makes the difference between a good run and a bad run, and that can feel unfair. I think it would be better to eliminate the clock and focus instead on making larger levels and giving each of them a distinct “flavor,” since all the stages look and sound pretty much the same. 

On the whole, I found The Marvellous Miss Take to be a very pleasant surprise. The visual/audio style, themes, and gameplay are very unique and elegantly presented. Fans of stealth games should definitely check this one out.

Even though there isn't much competition, this is the best and most replayble stealth game of the year. Miss Sophia Take needs to get back her rightfully owned art pieces from various levels. Might not look it, but the game is quite experimental and challenging underneath the top-notch poppy cartoonish presentation. The art design and jazzy soundtrack are sublime. It's a game designed around non-violence and ghosting, which is even lacking among the greatest stealth games that still allow you to knock out every guard but this game is all about getting in and out of a level sight unseen. 

The control method is more like an RTS where it's mouse-only (although you can use WASD) but with one unit set against guards, cameras, dogs, and lasers. You move with the LMB and you can hold down for whistling to distract an enemy. with RMB, you can throw a gadget like a noisemaker or teleporter. My one gripe about the gadgets is they're not used in enough levels, and the glue gadget is almost entirely useless but is only required for just a couple of levels. 

It's very arcade-y where you have par times to beat and short multi-tier levels to traverse, but the random enemy placements will make you act on your toes. Sometimes that randomness can lead to being boxed in by large vision cones but realise there are only 4 types of placements, so respawning multiple times after failures is not so bad. It's hard to get angry when Miss Take, the good version of Carmen Sandiago, is spotted and throws her hat and hands in the air as she flees from being captured. Dogs are usually the most annoying enemy in stealth games, but here not only do they look cute but their small vision cones allows you to literally make them trail around in circles which is useful in later levels when they can be an obstacle to your goal. The other playable characters make for different stategies and goals in their more ghosting-frinedly versions of the same levels, and even after 10 hours of completing 25 levels, I still found their epilogues left to unlock.

I found the civilians really annoying when you're trying to round a corner and get a painting at the same time while they're gawking at it, slowing down your movement and possibly getting you spotted. 

The story itself is quite light-hearted, with a good sense of humour (""You're Batman, I get it""). The characters are likeable, especially Daisy where there's a whole motherly thing going on between Miss Take and her. There aren't many surprises in the plot, but the character banter between levels in your house are appreciated that gives a more family atmosphere as you three try to help each other out along the way.

In addition, the main character may be a thief, but it's a Robin Hood-ish thief. Taking back what was supposed hers in the first place, so the public can enjoy it. This means that this is a good game for folks looking for non-combat games, because there's no attacking the guards, just distracting and avoiding them.

I do feel the need to emphasize the challenge, though.  The difficulty ramps up VERY quickly, I was noticing a jump before I finished the first five rooms, but part of that may have been my attempts at the side challenges.",1417568441,1417568441,True,5,0,0.52021414041519165,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You stealthfully try to take back your aunt's masterpieces from a number of galleries utilizing quick strategy, an array of high-tech gadgets and the special skills of your fellow bandits, Harry and Daisy. Each level provides a range of challenging security from guard dogs, to lasers, and infrared cameras, requiring masterful forethought in planning your heist.  Each character has a number of achievements to unlock based on specific art pieces collected or how fast you finish the level.  When it comes to trying to beat the clock, it can be frustrating at times because the random path of the guards almost seem like they know where you are, leaving you no choice but to run and hide or start again.

Part of the fun with this game comes from figuring out the fastest way to loot an area without drawing too much attention.  While you can scroll around a level to a limited diameter from your character, having a separate free ranging camera to look over each gallery before you loot the place, is remarkably absent. Sure you can see the entire layout of each building before you start the mission; however the angle is skewed and somewhat difficult to see all the key areas.  Like a real heist, we should be able to scan each floor and note where each treasure piece and security is located in order to plan our course of action as efficiently as possible.  


The story of 'Miss Take' is enhanced with jazzy music, stylish animation and a colorful palette.  The narration is bookmarked with humorous newspaper headlines about your antics and simple text boxes spoken between your characters and patrons.  Given the setting, it would have been great to hear these characters actually speak with an English accent.  It would have literally breathed some personality into these characters and brought the game to life.

Gameplay itself is deceptively simple, using point-and-click mouse controls to run, walk, distract and throw objects.  Crouching is done automatically when you sneak behind tables and pillars. There is an option to use Keyboard controls but there is no indication of what those keys are, and no way to rebind them. The latest update added an Action Camera function, the (C) key, to zoom-in on your character during gameplay.  Unfortunately this is nothing more than a close-up still frame for screen capturing; you cannot play while in this view.  While the official trailer shows clips of Sophia walking around at this lower camera angle, it's bewildering why this new feature locks the game as it would have added a whole new dimension and replay value.


Despite some of these minor qualms, The Marvellous Miss Take is a refreshingly fun and unique ‘take’ on the stealth action genre.  You’ll spend hours sneaking your way through a minefield of puzzling obstacles, reclaim your aunt’s “stolen” masterpieces, and do it all over again just to beat your previous time.",1417487925,1480344751,True,13,1,0.62978208065032959,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The teleporter cooldown being tied to the amount of loot collected implies the game will reward strategic thinking, but the random guard pathing means completion of missions is often down to pure luck.

Similarly, pathing of your own character is unpredictable.  Click on a destination that's not reachable via a straight line, and you can find yourself in view of a guard or security camera.

Speaking of security cameras, these have a small ""safe"" area directly below them.  However, the controls are just vague enough that it's easy to accidentally click on a pixel too far and end up within view of the camera.


Other issues to note:

- Quitting mid-mission means you have to redo it from the start, there's no warning of this (as of Dec 1st).  This is particularly annoying for missions with three floors.
- You have to complete all missions within a chapter in sequence.  There is no ability to switch to another mission in the same chapter if you get stuck.
- The camera cannot be zoomed out to give you a view of the whole floor (though there is limited scrolling).  This makes it more difficult to plan your route in advance.

I've spent about an hour with it, and it was very enjoyable.

I first became aware of the game from a screenshot, which showcased the cute, colorful, and stylized graphics. I think they work well with the game and they look great. I'm playing on a 280x, so I can't comment on how well it runs on lower cards, but there are options to turn off shadows, reflections, antialiasing, etc, so it should probably run fine on just about anything.

Cranked up to the max, the game looks beautiful. The style complements the game well. It even offers 1.5x-2x SSAA (Supersampled Antialiasing). I opted to just leave it at 1920x1200, but I found it interesting that they had such advanced features, especially since the game looks just fine with the standard AA settings.

As for gameplay, it's pretty much what you would expect. I've only experienced the first two characters, but their playstyles are different enough to make running through the same levels entertaining. The most surprising part for me was the speed factor. Particularly with Sophia/Miss Take, not only is there a par time you can try to beat, but the randomized guards and powerups really emphasize a quickness. This is definitely not a slow burn stealth experience.

Everything is controlled with mouse. Click to move, hold left click on the character to whistle, right click to throw items, and hold left click to run (if the character is able). I picked up the controls quickly and started to have lots of fun doing speedruns on some of the levels. Restarting is quick and painless, and the controls combined with the play make for a very arcadey type of fun. I could see this being a blast played with a friend, passing the controller on death or seeing who can get the fastest time.

The pathfinding, as I've heard mentioned before, does leave a bit to be desired sometimes (Sophia got stuck on a few edges), but to me it wasn't an issue. With either character, I quickly got used to ""setting waypoints,"" basically, guiding them exactly where I wanted to go. This isn't the kind of game where you click halfway across the level and expect them to make it there unhindered. There are guards to avoid and paintings to collect.

Overall, I'm very happy I picked this up, and I recommend you do it too.

My only concern at this point is the difficulty (will it be too easy?) and the length. My (very quick) glance at the house hub makes it look like there are only 5-6 areas, and I've already made it to the second.",1417403284,1417403284,True,4,0,0.50855553150177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

They'll go wherever they want with no pre-set path, but there are ways you can distract them to certain areas (whistling, walking into their line of sight for a second, etc).

The core gameplay is you are a thief who wants to steal things, and so you do. The levels let you know how long you take, so you can always go back to a level and try to beat it faster.

Rather than skulking in the shadows, you're forced to constantly move as the guards and dogs are unpredictable. This results in seat-of-your pants moments as you're not sure if a guard will turn right into you!

The gameplay is simple to learn but evading the guards, dogs and cameras can be rather tricky -especially in the later levels. There are 3 characters, each of which plays slightly differently which is great as it mixes up the gameplay. 

The art style is great, really colourful and vibrant and the aminations (particularly the dogs and masterthief) are spot on.

The game looks wonderful with it's interesting artstyle, the game feels smooth and refined whilst keeping you on your toes at all times. The pure fact that you have to be patient to avoid being detected yet quick to beat the best time on the level adds a whole extra element of addictive gameplay.

This is a game that will last countless hours yet still manage to hold your attention as you strive to steal *ahem* I mean ""recover"" every last piece of artwork you can. Just when you think you have mastered every element of the game it is quick to throw in something new and challenging, another feature that you will be forced to master if you are to stand any chance of escaping the next heist without being caught. On top of that the game adds additional characters who behave entirely different and completely change the way you play the game and plan your moves.

I must be honest, at first I didn't think much of the game but I am very glad to have had the chance to have a hands on look at the game, because I soon saw my mistake in not realizing what an absolute masterpiece Wonderstruck has created.",1416505379,1416505379,True,16,1,0.557841122150421143,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The cartoony graphics style and animation, the non violence approach to the genre, the fitting music and the hilarious puns create a really lovely experience for gamers of all ages!
The main character is the charming Miss Sophia Take - a lady with a big red hat and a fiery hair. She's pretty new in the ""business"", so the first chapter of the game is kinda like a tutorial, as you learn to use your wit and different gadgets in this speedy theft affair. All of the levels I've played ( first 9 so far) consist of 2 parts and you usually have less than 2 minutes to complete them both ( for a noteworthy performance at least :p), so you need to be fast and and you need to be bold in your stealth action. There aren't any hp bars or something, as there is no violence - once caught you need to restart, but no worries, there is a savepoint for each part of the level.
The game offers one-hand-only-full mouse control, but there is a keyboard movement option if you like it, and I definitely used it. Playing with one hand has it's advantages :p, but the keyboard controls are tight and very useful in my opinion.
I've only unlocked 1 character so far, so I have 2 to pick from. With the second one you play the same levels, but you have different objectives and quite different playstyle - with miss Take your nimble and fast, and there is a time goal, and with the dude I unlocked - your moving around like Dr. House, but there is no timer, instead there is a ""ghost"" goal (be completely unseen).
I like the organized chaos approach - you really need to be fast and decisive, instead of staying still in the corners and trying to figure out guard's movement pattern. You will get caught once or twice, as you trial and error through the levels, making it so much more satisfying, when you achieve the perfect heist!
I'm a stealth games fan, so this review might be a bit biased, but I really like this game and can only recommend it! Then again, I think the price tag is way too steep, so if you're not a fan of the genre like me, you might wanna wait for the game to go on sale!

TL:DR or you wanna check out some gameplay - check my overview video as I complete a couple of levels with each of the first 2 characters :

Talking about the game, it's a top-down, non-lethal stealth stealth game, and it's a simple one with it's simple and good looking graphics/art style, simple controls, and simple objectives and gameplay, and it's simplicity is really nice to be honest.

The game is pretty looking with colorful cozy colors, coupled with a few nice sound tracks. The story isn't anything special but it's good for what the game is, and sets the background and reasons for what you do, which is stealing valuable art and the like. The stealth part of the game is pretty direct with a couple of enemies to deal with, with their line of sight and whatnot (also dogs), and cameras, lasers, you get the idea, and everything about those are pretty good with the enemy's movement being random and unpredictable.

You also get nice toys to play around with depending on the level and a noise maker that you can through, or a teleprompter, or glue to slow enemies or other NPCs. Just to make the playing through the levels a little (or a heck lot) more fun depending on how you use it.

There's also a handful of characters with different priorities when going through the levels, and different abilities and gameplay, which aside from the main campaign and getting three stars (or three frames), adds a heck of a lot more replayability to the game.

The one thing I found bad/annoying is the imprecise movement system, with how the area you click in to move is a big circle that results click on areas that I didn't want to click on, that and coupled with the locked camera angle leaves an annoying moment to have every now and then.

Overall the game is great and I loved my time playing it with it's cheerful and fun simple gameplay, good lengthy campaign that's fun to replay with different approaches and characters, with good and snappy level design.
