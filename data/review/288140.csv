As someone who blew a ton of money earlier in life on Links and the early TW games, this is just a godsend. Since there are hundreds of courses available for download, the first thing I did was download Congressional CC, home of some of my favorite Links memories.

The metering is a little hard to figure out, especially in the short game, and it's hard to tell when you need to dial up an extra club or two to hit an uphill green or deal with wind -- this appears inconsistent to me, but then on an actual golf course, you never know until you hit it.

In essence, I'm a little sad I didn't buy this sooner. I have to make up for lost time now and since it'll be a long time before I'm tournament ready (if ever), I'm just going to take a little walk down memory lane with a very well designed and executed game.

its the swing meter. i have a very fast high powered pc with a very good graphics car yet you get a freeze or hang in the swing meter when you take a shot. its random as well but ruins your shot completely and you just cannot do anything about it.
ive check many forums and the one also here on steam and lots complain about it and changing settings in game do nothing to address it.

Despite protests to the owner of the site from many of the players concerns in regards to the consistent winning streak nothing was done and this player continues to consistently win all tournaments he enters.  This is not a recent development but has been ongoing for years.  In all fairness the admin of the site proclaims he has done all he can to investigate the claims but says he can find no evidence of malpractice.  

In short........if you are joining PGLS in the hope of becoming a winner then I strongly suggest you simply stick to Perfect Golf and enjoy the game for what it is.

This game is the least impressive golf sim I have played so far and I will be refunding it after I write this review.

I primarily use the real-time mouse swing in this and the other golf games I play.  My biggest gripe with the swing in this game is that you can move the mouse back and forward in a super slow motion and you would be hitting the ball as if it were a full speed swing.  In addition the swing analysis stats that show up as soon as you hit the ball in the practice driving range do not show up when you play a round.  With no swing power meter as well, in stroke play it becomes a guessing game of looking at the animation of your golfer and hoping you don't overhit an approach past the green.  Yes we can't accurately predict distance in real golfing either, but real golfers know how much swing speed and power their bodies are capable of when they swing.  Computer golfers that swing with the mouse do not have such precise feedback so I feel indicators become more important for both realism and enjoyment.

The short game is another issue in Perfect Golf.  You can note the leftward and rightward slope of greens, but there seems to be no way to tell the upward and downward slope, even with grids.  I did not have that issue with any of the other golf games referenced in the top paragraph.  I also get very little feedback when I putt as to how strong and weak my swing was.  Finally if a putt is missed sometimes the slope indicated in the first putt's grid will disappear as if the slope did not exist.  Basically the display of greens information is inconsistent from putt to putt.

This game's positives are the graphics and animations.  It looks easy to play with others online, but I haven't tried it.  Players wanting greater immersion will be disappointed with only one available male avatar, no career mode, and very limited solo play options.  In addition settings for a stroke play are not saved each time you play, so it becomes annoying to have to look over the 15 or so options to try to remember exactly how you prefer to play.

I have to give Perfect Golf a negative review not because it isn't the best golfing game, but because the two major issues mentioned above take away the playability and immersion that even the basic 80's golfing games I have played for the Nintendo Entertainment System gave me.  If you want a modern golf sim, I suggest The Golf Club 2 (not 2019) over this game.  One thing is for sure: Perfect Golf will not replace Links 2003 as my go-to golf game.",1557009722,1558233782,False,7,0,0.565842747688293457,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However: The short game is impossible - the distance meter bears no relation to the distance you'll actually hit the ball, making any short shots to the green random luck.

1: Learn distances to play with no markers.
2: Play with no green grids and use f5 freecam (awsd) to analyse your putts.
3: Use motion swing and practice to get a ratio of 0.25. Do some driving range and unclick the yellow tee dot to practice faster.
4: If you hit the ball to the green from 91yards expect backspin, use this at advantage depending wind and green uphill or downhill. To avoid the backspin use your pw at 120yards because some green will roll back ridiculously 100 yards back and thats the way to avoid it.
5: Play on pro tour difficulty. New players, use hacker mode to avoid the swing ratio or else learning all at once will be impossible and you will play +100.  
6: If you do move to tour pro with motion swing, i suggest a very open course or not starting at championship tees.

There are certainly some improvements that could be made with this game, but the 3 Click system, coupled with extra sensitivity if you don't hit the snap at the bottom just right gives it more of a sim feel. I can't seem to use the motion swing system as it may not be compatible with my mouse, but even if my mouse isn't jiving well with it, I would be content to play 3 click from here on out.

I would say they need to work on the avatar's stance in certain situation/lies. And of course have more varied avatars and/or customizable ones is sorely needed. The pre-shot camera views could be more plentiful, or ideally, a true free range camera. The overhead view in relation to the swing meter should be movable, but that is minor.

Plus points:
- Controls are overall easy to pick up. 
- Intuative game play and decent physics. 
- Good game balance.

Things to improve:
- Alway making the same changtes to the game set-up. It would be nice if player preferences would be retained.
- Graphics, especially in the menu, but also the course, and the atmospheric sounds could be updated. 
- Player A.I. is a little slow.

After years of searching I gave up looking around 2009.   It was by shear luck that I tripped over this in the steam store and after a couple days of debate due to the $ 39.99 price tag, I thought I would give it a try.   Well, I could not be happier.   This game recreates the immersive feel and simulates reality better then any golf game since Links.  Some people have said in reviews that the graphics are dated, and after playing several courses I am still struggling to figure out what they are talking about unless they expect actual photos of the course.   None of the course that are available are ones I have played or visited in real life so I can not testify to the authenticity of renderings, but they are realistic enough for me.

After playing a couple rounds I decided to visit the community sites to see about additional courses and found an active community with online tourneaments and plenty of user generated courses.   Then to paraphase The Hobbit""- ""Something happened that the ring did not intend""  I saw who was behind the project.  Andrew and Mike Jones.  If you are any kind of Links 2003 fan, these were two of the premiere Course Designers from the Links 2003 community.   It was like a homecoming to see those names.   

Pros:  Great Golf Simulator with multiple options to control swing including simulators.
          Over 190 user created courses
          Online Tournaments for most skill levels

Cons:   Putting can be a challenge at amature level or higher due to lack of instruction and a guage that is not intuitive, but as with real gold, once you practice you will get the hang of it.
            The game lacks a long term statistics traking method so you can not track in game your improvement. 
            Game needs more golfers to choose from, the version I got only came with a single male golfer called ""Hacker Harry"" so female golfers don't have a free option to feel like they are on the course.

I recommend this game but offer the reservation of this is an independant studio and r the lack of golfer animations is the pit fall to this game.

Started the game but it hung up at the select controller screen and did not give the 30 second count down like it did on my PC. Back to other end of the house and the only way to exit the game was a force quit. Thought I could start game on the PC and then play on big screen but then no sound on TV, only sound was at the other end of the house where PC is. Looked online for others with the same issue and found 3 but no solution to the problem. maybe they ended up using a controller but I haven't used a controller for years and don't own one. Such a small percentage of complaints about this issue and no fix found. Keyboard and mouse work fine with all my other games, even non-Steam titles I play through the Steam Link. Really would have liked to play this on the big screen but got a refund.  :(

Wanted to edit this since I repurchased the game, I could not resist this game and I am really enjoying it so far.

Mouse and gamepad real time swing control is way off.
Move your mouse a tenth of a milllimetre off line and your ball will swing wildly to the left or right.

The Golf Club 2 nailed that aspect of the game.

Putting is better but requires you to be very soft or otherwise the ball will fly to the other side of the green.

It's a 7 out of 10 for mine.

I think this game is purely designed for people with real golf simulator hardware that can interface with this game as  the gamepad and mouse iimplementation is dam awful.

For those using real hardware simulators and  real golf clubs, the sim is probably a much better experience.

I'll try to explain why concisely;

- Simple, functional, easy to use multiplayer lobby system.
- Tons of downloadable courses that are as good or better than the ones that come with the game's original install. 98% are free! Just takes a bit of time and work to download them.
- Different control schemes available, as well as different difficulty settings for them -- this critical feature absent in some other big golf games allows you to learn and enjoy a course, the physics of the game, and playing with friends independently of your progress at mastering a particular control scheme or mechanic. This makes the game accessible, allowing you to up the difficulty yourself as you improve and learn the game -- players just need to take advantage instead of playing at too hard a difficulty level and then blaming ""bad controls"" which I see a *lot* of in other reviews below. Some seem unable to stomache that ""Amateur"" is actually a hard difficulty level just because of the word.
- Great overall gameplay & physics, good enough graphics [gameplay is just far more important].

Where it has room for improvement:

- Stability; game has crashed a few times at the end of a multiplayer round, and less frequently but a few times have run into freezing/can't-continue type issues in the middle of a multiplayer game.
- Speed/smoothness of online gameplay; there are endless ""click to continue"" type popups after every shot, every 9 holes and etc. This mechanic just slows down the speed of online gameplay and becomes more and more of an irritation over time.
- Speed/smoothness of online gameplay; there are just numerous delays between everything in this game and no attention at all in general paid to making the game run smoother, faster, and have any respect for people's time during multiplayer play. You should be able to at least enable an option to skip or speed up the viewing your own shots, and the time inbetween shots is just gratuitous sometimes. Even 18 holes with a couple friends can often be a 2+ hour affair.
- Progression? Stats? Career? Online ladder? Ranking system of some kind? Unlocks based on achievements and ranks? 
- Why not incentivize using more difficult control settings via the non-existent but hope-for-in-the-future systems of progression, achievements, rankings, and unlocks?
-Looking through the negative reviews a majority of them are frustrated because they simply cannot figure out how to set the difficulty of the swing to a good balance that challenges them a bit without being overly frustrating, and can't figure out/can't-be-bothered-figuring-out how to download and install the many popular 3rd party courses, the vast majority of which are free. Why not integrate a course-browsing/rating/viewing/downloading system into the game? Why not integrate a feature that adapts your difficulty settings for swings to a point where you can semi-consistently hit fairways but it still leaves some substantial difficulty there so you can improve?

I'm really looking forward to the sequel to this game. Hopefully it can make the gameplay smoother, faster, more stable -- and even add some elements of progression. I think that would be a huge success and very popular. Until then this is still the best option for a relaxing game with a friend -- but have your coffee or snacks ready it does go a bit slowly.",1504102787,1504103438,True,9,1,0.632595658302307129,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, that's where the good ends.

I could not get to grasps with the motion swing at all. Too many variables to get right to hit a 'perfect' swing and the smallest of errors with timing or mouse movement cause a hook shot of note. I even tried the 'ruler' trick to try to get the movement staright at least but timing issues again produced nothing but hooks.

So 3 click swing it is. In 'begginer' and 'amateur' 3-click is manageable. You do really need to be close to the mark on the downswing of the meter but I found it quite playable. Pop the game up to 'pro' and this changes completely. A pixel either side of the marker on the downswing and its off into the bush, rough or water. I played through 9 holes and hit the fairway once. Totally frustrating gameplay.

Ok, so I'll stick to 'amateur' then. After having completed quite a few solo rounds I decided to have a look at the other game types. Tournaments looked promising at first. I liked the idea I can play at my own pace and compare my score to others. However, for the 20+ hours over a few days I have played this, only one tournament has been available on a course that is not included with the game that I would need to purchase. Nope.

Right then, multiplayer. Lobby is almost empty each time. Max 30-40 players while I am checking (UK GMT day time). Most on courses I dont have or need to pay for. There simply aren't the numbers playing to make it viable for a range of play types and players.

It's a shame, I played TW from TW 99 on Windows 98 through to PGA Tour 2008 and the multiplayer stroke play was great fun. I was hoping I had found it again but alas, no. The golf club with no click swing and inconsistent swings is no better either.

So that's that. I had really high hopes on my initial play through but as I delved deeper into the game it became overly difficult making it unplayable at the level I wanted and I don't want to have to pay for every additional course.

Да, кстати, погоду можно генерировать с системного сервера, что тоже привносит в игру определенный колорит и реальность. К интерфейсу они тоже подошли с другой стороны, нежели в Golf Club.

When your talking SIM, this is as close as you can get with any golf game on the market. The ability to score takes skill, knowledge of golf, and desire. After playing 18 hrs I have finally begun to get down to just about par. 

After playing wgt, twg, and other games, this one by far takes golf SIM to new heights with their new swing motion. I am enjoying playing this game more and more, and have over 130 courses at my disposal. I can understand why some get frustrated, they do not have the patience nor will to gradually become better. Instant gratification is what most desire in today's fast pace world. This game definitely evens the field up, and people don't like that as well. 

Ball effects for differing course agriculture may be better in the future, hopefully. I have seen that cart paths do not quite bounce the ball enough, ruff tends to slow the ball down a little but not enough. Trees do very well in deflecting balls correctly in this game, I love that aspect. Greens react quite well, and I am yet to see an animal exploded from my launched ball. The courses that others have made are first class, and there are many of them. Options for in game settings are awesome. 

Overall, this game takes some time to get good at. This is not a game for those who like arcade over SIM, i.e. pg2, twg over jnpg.

Very customizable.  Not too bad to learn to play.  I picked up on the mouse click method and Steam controller method quite quickly.  Never was a huge fan of the mouse movement swing in any iteration of golf games on the PC since Leaderboard Golf on DOS/Commodore64.

The microtransactions aren't too pricey or out of control either.  You start with a good dozen country clubs and can order for $6 or less new ones.  All the fancy cosmetics are unlocked by actually playing the game.

I have yet to get a chance to try out the hotseat multiplayer, but that looks like it could bring back the good ole days of playing a bowling or golf game on the computer as a party game.

All in all, I would say this is definitely worth a buy if you are into golf, and by far the best golf game currently out on SteamOS/Linux.

If you simply want to play a round of computer golf that looks and feels reasonably realistic and where you feel that the results are down to your own skill rather than pure luck then this will suit you. Using the motion swing control method it will take an awful lot of practice to hit the ball accurately particularly when it comes to putting. After more than 40 hours playing I am still to complete a round anything better than +5.....

But unfortunately the game has a totally unfinished air to it. There is no career mode and, worse of all, no player stats within the game. I find it totally incomprehensible that in a game that stats were created for there is simply nothing. And that brings up the other big problem....no feedback and no support. Very, very disappointing. 

The game does come with a number of courses both real and fantasy which are generally very good. There is also a website where further courses can be downloaded. But that, in itself, brings another problem....the PP servers are currently down and when they are (which is rather frequently) then the downloaded courses don't show in the game and can't be played. Aaaargh!

I would love to recommend this game but in all honesty, regrettably, I can't. Sorry!

Review Mk 2:

After more weeks of playing the game, and whilst I still bemoan the lack of a career mode or readily accessible stats, I have to slightly revise my review.

Whilst I didn't mention it above one of the things I disliked about the game was the infamous ""lip out"" with putting and the devs have now greatly improved that. And whilst I'm still hopeless at the game (I still haven't done a round in anything better than +2) perhaps it does more reflect real ability than pure luck.

So if you can accept the drawbacks I will give it cautious approval!",1494412047,1504092207,True,0,0,0.540085375308990479,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The continued ignorance of that detestible cnt Mike Jones and the total mis-management of this game are making it a shambles, as more and more haters pile-on to it with bad, bad reviews every week BOOOOOOO!!!!


Mike Jones, the fat spunker, had no right and no reason to delete my entire profile OMG!! - he just didn't like it, and what is the -100 all about on my reputation score when it was at 93, just utterly peevish and child like behavior from an ingrained twt.. Mike Jones also had no right and no reason for putting me on mod queue for pointing out St Andrews as it stands is woefully inadequate as the supposed flagship course of the game, I put snapshots of the PP St Andrews up against photographs of exactly the same scenes and it is hugely obvious the texturing is nowhere near up to scratch and the bushes/ bramble are either non existent of have been done very very crudely indeed it's either an amateur job or a rush job (compare it to snapshots of Royal troon on their social site to see what is possible when done to a high level of design) - but again he just didn't like it, suddenly I was 'trolling' for saying what most of the top designers must surely have been thinking and instead of getting his honest opinion that I requeasted on St Andrews he immediately sabotaged my account and openly baited me in to writing a negative review on steam, not exactly a team player for the company!


***I just want to add here - I actually tried to pursue his disgusting treatment of me to their public relations department giving a full account of what had happened to me and asking them to investigate the whole matter with a 3rd party from within the company - guess what they did? SHUT DOWN MY ENTIRE PROFILE SO IT WAS NON RETRIEVABLE no doubt to get rid of the evidence of sabotage!!! UNBELIEVABLE AND DRACONIAN TREATMENT OF A PAID UP CUSTOMER!!! just to check it was a result of my complaint I created a new temporary profile and resent the request for a 3rd party investigation - account completely shut down again.


conclusion:

 - SO WE KNOW THEY (Perfect Parallel and it's employees, particularly Mike Jones) ARE SCUM, THEY OPERATE LIKE SCUM AND THEY SHOULD BE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY A CONSUMER WATCHDOG!!!!!!! ***


But these observations have to be stated and addressed for the good of the game and it's standing in the future because proper course critics who do get commisioned to evaluate courses would laugh our St Andrews out of town - hands down they would it would get savaged in any magazine review for instance!! But that says a lot about Mike himself, the qualities of the man - he's peevish, if I wanted to say it more succinctly - he's a very awkward man with terrible judgement and limited scope - you get them usually as security officers and they have that regrettable nature about them, that's why they stand the gates 11 hours a night I suppose, but not nearly qualified for a position Mike Jones finds himself in. 


The management of this game is also woefully inadequate and the forum best exemplifies that - they have let 3 or 4 of the most unfortunate people run riot here and spoil it for the rest, and as The Golf Club starts up societies and captures the mass market this one has been left behind in the sticks through poor project planning and will end up nothing more than a backwater of a few gnarly old men who know their life is spent and have nothing better to do than henpeck all day. 

They are still stuck in a cycle of patching up and re patching up bugs and performance issues when they should really be doing time-cost-perceived benefit analysis, there are many soft-fixes that I can see that would result in a considerable perceived improvement to the game, but as it stands there does not appear to be any kind of project planning utilizing the most effective tools in this regard.
In fact I percieve the game after a while away from it as actually being 'MORE BROKE' than it was over a year ago with the constantly disappearing swingmeter in 3 click mode standing out like a sore thumb, I mentioned it several times but got zero response from the team as they only seem to take the word of a few select. One of their very very top level designers I have chatted with has called it 'the clique' and described them as 'in their own world', and it has done absolutely nothing for the furtherment of the game over that time period I mentioned.

After the last update, so much changed that I've stopped playing pretty much. It used to be fun.

It has a lot of courses, many really good free ones; the basics are all there, it has several levels of play, all of which are too tough for this old guy, and enough free presonalization to make your game look good. They have big plans in the golf world and while some of the bells and whistles aren't there (never missed the crowd noise anyways, no fancy locker rooms to acess data, etc.) there's a lot there, almost everything can be controlled with sliders, it supports really nice graphics, There's an active lobby, several tournaments both 'official' and open, but all use levels of play above the starter level, so your controls may look different, and you may want to learn the higher levels of controls; me I have trouble enough on hacker, or whatever the lowest is. 
The game is very good at recovery, if you lose connections, or in multi-player, you have a good chance of picking up right where you left off. There's an active community base and an active forum, and an at-times chatty lobby.

This can not happen in the game. There is no stopping the ball once it lands on the green. It is all roll out so lets hope you have alot of green to work with. Sand shots should be able to get spin on them if the lie is clean and the landing area on the green is flat or up hill. This does not happen. again its all role out. Hit it thin or fat? Ok I get that. but missing the snap by a 10th of a fraction and you are penalized!!. c'mom folks get real. Putting: Not really an issue, except. too many lip outs when the ball speed is at a rate and location that would allow it to drop. If the intention is to have all puts drop in the centre cup, then make the hole smaller! otherewise, lighten up on the speed to gravity ratio. AND Why does the ball get spit out of the cup once it drops? Yep. happened twice. slow putt. in the heart, drops in the cup and a half second later it is spit out like old chewing gum. One more thing: I dont mind the forgiveness adjustment on missing the meter whith most tee shots and fairwar approaches, but lets make it equal or relative to all clubs, wedges and Putter.

Perfect golf is imo a simulator that makes reward from effort awesome.  A friend of mine bought me this game so he had someone to play this with and immediately set me up with the mouse swing settings.  There are many settings to mess about with with respect to DPI and in settings the speed of swing in relation to mouse movement, however, GET PAST THAT ! and you will find yourself playing a golf game that simulates your own play.   I highly recommend this method of play however there are the other standard 3 click mouse swing options.

I usually find that my first 9 semi sober is not bad, then deteriorating into downswings to fast or pull backs too slow, equating in hooks and fades.  However, when you pull it off ..  the feeling is AWESOME !

Great graphics, smooth gameplay and finally a golf game that Multiplayer is seemless unlike others I have played.

User generated courses which are getting better daily make for some great fun and the option do design your own should you wish.

Play competitively ot casually and drunk as I usually do....  either way ..  dont expect an EASY golf game !
Competitions online are grades from am to pro and by various swing styles.
DLC is available but also MANY user generated free courses that are awesome.

If you enjoy effort for reward games then this is for you.
If you expect to hit a straight shot and par every time ..   then choose another .. this takes effort and practice.

I´ve been playing golfgames since the Commodore 64 time before the first Links-game came out and I also play golf in real life. Not saying that makes my review more credible, but it may give a hint on what I look for and am annoyed with...

There´s lots of graphical adjustments to suit most people which is good. You have your sound options and of course your golfer customization. You can pick your clubs and equipment and buy more if thas not enough for you. At the moment you don´t have that much to buy so perhaps thats something that will be added along the way. A bunch of golf courses are included and more are available to buy for a few bucks. I´m fine with that. The courses included are fine and varying in style.
You have your practice mode which I think could be better if you had more putting and pitching options and such. Tourmaments are not used much as far as I can see which is a shame. Multiplayer will be your only option if you want to play with other players but my feeling is that this is not very active. You have to work a bit to get a game started. If you just want to play a few holes you´ll probably end up chosing solo-play anyway.

I feel I can go on and on about this so I´ll just end with what I think works well and what doesn´t.

Graphics are fine even though animations could be alot better.
Sound effects are good but the game is really missing commentary. It feel lonely out there too often.
Motionswing is frustration and annying - in other words perfect! That´s golf! :) No seriously I feel they´ve done a great job with that one. You need to practice and you won´t get it perfect all the time.
Putting is hard which is also fine but I don´t like the fact that you almost all the time have to aim 5 meters to your left/right because the greens have such big slopes. That´s just not very realistic I´m afraid. There´s some work to be done here.
As I´m a ""leftie"" I of course miss the left handed player...

Would I recommend the game? Well...there aren´t too many good golf games out there today so I guess we can´t be too selective here. If you like to play a quick round now and then and aren´t that interested in career modes and the stuff EA:s Tiger Woods golf had to offer, this game should be enough for you.

I resisted the urge to cane it with a negative earlier, instead waiting to see how the games evolved first. Sorry to say that I will also do some comparisons between other golf games as well.

THE GOOD

- The graphics are nowhere as bad as some reviewers describe. On course they are finer than say The Golf Club, I have grown to like the courses.

- Hard on the fairway as well as the green. In The Golf Club I hit almost 99% of the fairways; with Perfect Golf I am lucky to hit 70%.

- Greens are ""fairly"" realistic. Perfect Golf has much better green dynamics than The golf Club's ice puck surfaces (which is entirely where games are won or lost in that game).

- Has come a long way since Early Release.

THE BAD

- Not sure what the season pass people are going to get for their money?  But if they get value it will mean the rest of us will be stranded with a 75% complete game.

- On line play still has a long way to go before it reaches Tiger Woods 2007, which is where PC On line golf achieved its pinnacle. Sad to say we had a better on-line game almost 10 years ago.

- It feels isolated, there are no active seasons, or competitions (one token tournament)  or any attempt to group players by skill level. I know these next comment are outside the control / influence of the game developers - but in The Golf Club there is TGC Tours which is well run and builds that sense of community. The same is trying to  happen with Perfect Golf with GolfOnlineTourNet, but is a long way from polished and even the hacker league is won by people scoring -40 under.

- Dubious wind physics, while head and tail winds make a difference, I rarely bother adjusting for side winds.",1472345249,1472345344,True,2,2,0.455696195363998413,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Pretty sure there is something for everyone.

I settled in on real time mouse swing as that works well for me in other games. This game gives that swing with a twist in that tempo is also needed for a good swing.

Ooodles of game play levels. Plenty of options and feedback with the practice areas to hone your game control type. Game has a significant learning curve at higher and harder levels which is right up my alley as i like practicing as much as playing. At higher and harder levels the game will tax your cranium to score well and hit good solid shots.

Game is constantly improving and developers are trying to make a hard golf game. Golf is supposed to be hard, so I give extra kuddo's to the vision. However there are levels in the game that also make game play easy, so something for everyone in here.

Competitions and career come from outside fan sites, I have not had the opportunity to fully explore these yet, however they look OK. Fan sites can tend to rid themselves of good players looking to elevate their clique using various BS excuses, so time will tell if this also plaques this game or not.  However in any event the developers have been working on and are improving on computer generated opponets for players looking to compete against like skilled players. The game also has a lobby, something I have also not fully explored however it looks easy enough to find friends and fellow golfers to play with.

Current crop of courses are visually pleasing, and the game play at the higher levels of difficulty make replaying the same courses not at all boring. Additional courses can also be downloaded. You can read reviews and look at videos and photos of courses before deciding to add them to your stable of courses.

Developer also has a future plan to give course design to everyone. I'm looking forward to furthing my course design here.

This game still has too many issues to justify choosing it over other golf games. I decided to take the time to play Royal Birkdale (fan created) on JNPG, Tiger Woods 2008 and Links 2003 (while watching the Open) and found that while PG is sometimes prettier to look at in a screenshot, the gameplay of JNPG compared to TW08 and Links is abysmal.

If I could only choose one of the three, I'd choose TW08. And since there are new real courses still being released regularly and frequent online tournaments, it isn't even a close comparison. Add in the Career Mode and MUCH BETTER physics/swing and I think it is finally time for me to uninstall JNPG for the last time.

Some specific issues from my round today in JNPG; a putt from the fringe while the flag was in the cup resulted in my ball running over the cup and through the flag as if neither existed. The shadow rendering is horrible, and the flag shadow in particular is headache inducing. The follow camera is clunky, the aiming on the putting surface results in annoying redraws that truly destroy any immersion. And before anyone suggests ""But you can adjust things"", I spent considerable time adjusting and never got to a setting that made me want to keep playing.

End of Edit.

Don't waste your time or money.

Each ""patch"" breaks more and more, (edited to say...) and more and more and more.

Poor physics, broken swing meter, yardage that is way off, flashing textures on objects, and hilarious devs that forgot that this is supposed to be a game.

A fractured multiplayer community since the OGT site competes with the Lobby for players.

Go play TW2008 or Links 2003... more fun, no headache.

Beautiful graphics with excellent ball physics.

Many swing types available, including actual golf simulators where you swing a real club and hit a ball off a mat) though I'm old-school with the old 3-click method.  

The company that designed this game (and now has the help from Jack Nicklaus' group) is a highly-dedicated group
of computer golfers, real-life golfers (at least one that I know of is a PGA pro), real-life golf-course designers, etc.

The graphics in this game are also used by some of the TV networks in their golf telecasts.

Also, unlike the big game companies, such as EA Sports for example, these guys don't have any plans to gouge players for a full new version every year.  Yes, some of the licensed courses cost extra, but only 7 bucks for truly tremendous golf courses.  However, most of the new courses designed are offered for free, and nearly all of them are excellent.

Also, there eventually will  be a golf-course designer program offered for free (still in beta testing at the moment).  That appears it will be quite complicated, but for those used to using Unity to make games or games scenes already (not me, unfortunately), the course designer (known as Course Forge) will be capable of the fantastic.

Unfortunately, the online aspect of the game (in other words, playing matches against others online) has slipped...  It's often hard to find a match in the game lobby.

Fangen wir mal bei der Charaktererstellung an. NUR 1 Avatar - männlich - unschön und kantig. 
Die Ausrüstung ( bis auf die Schläger ) sind ein Witz. Es sei denn , Man investiert noch mehr reales Geld.

Der Sound: Keine Kommentare , sich ständig wiederholende Hintergrundgeräusche. Diese kann man aber alle einstellen.

Die Grafik: Hoppla, das ist Stand Links LS 99 aber nicht 2016.

Jetzt zur Spielemechanik: Dieses Spiel ist NICHTS für Anfänger. Die meisten Grüns sind nicht ordentlich ""lesbar"" auch nicht mit Raster. Der Caddie hat keine Lust oder ist eher in anderen Sportarten unterwegs, aber nicht beim Golf. Da überprüft man lieber selbst. Was sich aber auch als sehr schwierig erweist. Das Wetter ist ein Witz und die Ballphysik bei Wind unglaublich unrealistisch. Aber der Ball schein eh gern das zu machen , was er gerne möchte. 

Nach 19 Löcher auf Platz 759 und einem Score von +27 , dürfte jedem klar sein, dass hier etwas nicht stimmen kann.
Ich bin kein Profi aber eine + 27 ( alle auf dem Grün verhauen ) ist das schon sehr auffällig. Manchmal brauchte ich 8 - 9 Schläge für ein Grün. Putten ist ein Witz und auch die gesamte Entfernungsangabe ist eher ein Glückspiel als realistisch.

Für das Geld , hätte ich mehr von dem Spiel erwartet. Hier kommt Mehr Frust als Lust. Es mag gutes Potenzial haben, aber nicht wenn man nur ein Spiel auf den Markt haut, welches unfertig ist und die Leute zu einer Mitgliedschaft für über 200 Euro überreden will. Schämt Euch, versteckte Kosten hier einzubauen.

Auf den Punkt: Unfertiges , überteuertes , zu schnell auf den Markt gehauenes Golfspiel. Auch wenn ich nur 2,7 Stunden gespielt habe. Mehr Frust muss man sich nicht antun, da gibt es durchaus bessere Golfspiele aus der Vergangenheit.

Just my opinion of course but I look forward to see what they do with this great golf game.

There are many Golf sims and I have tried them all but following Microsofts decicion to no longer support Links after 2003 left many Golf players frustrated.  Links did however have an excellent course designer and they are lots of great designers out there who continued to support the game and gave the community loads of great courses to play.
Two of the finest designers then started Perfect Parallel with the eventual aim of releasing this game.  I joined the kickstarter campaign and was thrilled when the game got the Green Light from Steam.  When the game finally arrived I was very dissapointed because the game looked great but didn't play very well.The engine lagged badly so I went back to Links I even made sure that I updated my graphics card to be compatible with Links when I upgraded my computer.  A year os so further on I have returned to this game and I can safetly say that this is a worthy successor to Links.The graphics are beautiful the game supports lots of swing types and you can impliment real time weather for most locations all over the world but these are just small details what's important is how the game plays.  A year on the game now plays flawlessly so even if you only like the occasional casual game of golf this is as goods as it gets.  Those serious about their armchair golf will already have it. One of the coolest  things about these games is the course designer.  The designer that came with Links was fit for purpose but course design was involved and time consuming to say the least.The designer for this game called Course Forge is simpler and more intuitive to use but is not yet available but is due imminently.There are already plenty of cources to download other than those that come with the game from the link on the introduction page from designers that have been given early access and the standards are awesome.  These are now being released at a rate of about 5 a month and this will accelerate once the Course Forge is availanle for all. It would be amazing to see further cources particularly some of the best designs from the Links series.  Mike Jones one of Links premier designers really needs to make the rest of his cources available for Perfect Golf time permitting.How about it Mike?  Who knows once the CF is ready I might just add 1 or 2 designs of my own. In the meantime I'm off to play the remaining cources that I've downloaded in rainy old Blighty.

They said 2 years ago that career mode would be out ""soon."" Don't trust them. TGC2 looks way better anyways.)

Plays a good game of golf (except the putting is completely stupid), has hyper realistic coureses, and the course editor is easy to use, so many skilled disigners have gone all out on user created courses. These are the only good things about the game.

The player base is too small to have a proper online game, and the devs can only be bothered to update the in-game tournies every month or two. To play other tourneys, you need to register on one of two fan-created sites, one of which requires you to pay yearly dues. 

To see your stats, you have to go to the PP website and the format is trash. There are no in-game stats. 

There is no single player besides playing individual rounds. No career, no tournaments, and the AI golfers derp more than not.

If this game was actually completed, I would recommend it.

For me, as a single player video game player, I see them as a kind of relexation-reflex game.

I have a descent gaming rig (i-4790K OC + GTX980 16 GB ram blabla).

I own both. The Golf Club and Perfect Golf. I don't care about this Nicklaus. (Nicklaus has to stock my footware on 6th of december with sweets but don't interfere with my video games ;)

TGC: 42 hours play time
JNPG: 167 hours play time

Both are nice games. I play JNPG more often.
Why?

First. 
JNPG has 3-click. 
I dont like game-pads. 
(let the filthy console peasants or perverse masochistic 'real-life' mouse-swingers be happy with their raison d'etre, But least at last maintain our aristocratic way of computer golf game control  since time immemorial!). 
JNPG delivers!

Second.
Graphics. TGC has some nice features like shores on water, but all courses look 'the same' in a kind, where in JNPG the courses looks more different and real. (links, parkland, desert even sci-fi space course as download).

Third.
But as now, TGC is still the more finished game.
JNPG still has only one avatar, no über-detailed stats for every hole, no  seasons, crowds etc.

But.
I defenitely like JNPG more, because there is more 'depth'. But it needs more polish. Till now only the core is superb. Needs more gewgaw to be supreme.

I think this will come sooner or later.

Reviews babbling about exorbitant season-pass are wrong.
Only 250$+ when you want to let it run on a screen-simulator with real clubs (fwhich you could charge, if you DON'T just install it in your living room, - which is the norm. 
But no extra cost, when you want it only play on your own on this steam account. 
But even otherwise it would be convenient.

Last.
This game is REALLY loved by all these Ami-Grandpas.
So I think it is doing something REALLY right, as far at is concerning GOLF-Simulation.

This game is so realistic, it will make you rather play the real thing than stumble through this confusing ""reality"" rich pre-pre-alpha.

I've tried to give this game several chances, but upon playing the latest build of the game I give up, for now.

I'll probably be back after a few updates, but to the average or casual gamer, this is not the game you're looking for.

Inexplicable crashes, buggy graphics, and only ONE character model (which is hideously ugly) make this feel like a rushed, empty shell of a game waiting for content. A visit to the poorly designed and buggy developer website only made me feel like this game doesn't have a future.

Micro-transactions seem to be the ultimate goal here with their confusing ""Season Pass"" and one ball that you can buy. I'm not spending anymore money to think I'm helping make an unplayable game more playable. I've experimented with all swing styles presented in the game, and again, without taking the time to suffer through the learning curve (putting is the worst) you will never feel you've gotten anything out of this game.

This is more of a ""reality golf simulator"" than a golf video game. The reason successful sports games become successful is they often find engaging ways to make the player feel they are doing better, or making an impossible shot possible.

I'm sure someone will get on me that ""THIS GAME ISN'T FINISHED"" and to give it a chance later (which I will) this is more of a shining example of reasons we as a community should stop this wave of pre-alpha games from mudding up and getting mixed in with finished games. Since when did unfinished products get a green light to be rushed to consumers? Basically you are paying to test an un-fun real life golf simulation.

Not once on any store front or this very page on Steam is it explained that the season pass is NOT for the majority of Steam gamers even though this is very clearly a Steam game. Players who enjoy the game and would consider the season pass on the basis that they want the next twelve months worth of content (an annual basis) are left to make the decision to pump $200-ish into the game without any knowledge that they wont get any benefit from it.

Steam users have become accustomed to purchasing season passes to their games that are detailed and communicated professionally to the point that that they know what they are going to receive for their money before purchase. They are not thrown into the deep end and face a high priced annual pass that they have little to no way of knowing what they are getting let alone whether the investment is the right one for them -- which it really isn't going to be for a significant percentage of your Steam player base. For those that do fit the bill, you're right, it is a bit of a bargain (ELI5 - other golfing simulation software that serves a very niche audience are generally priced in the vicinity of $1000+ and occasionally upwards of five times that so in effect the devs have made the market much more accessible). 

Although I have had positive communication with ONE member of your team the others that have contacted me along with your fanboys have been quite aggressive. This aggressiveness has reached the point of almost being considered criminally abusive. I have personally elected not to respond in kind. In fact, I argue that silence in this instance is the appropriate response. 

PERFECT PARALLEL, Your game may be one of the most playable golf sims on the market but your behavior and inexcusably woeful communication abilities are the overriding reason why the game suffers such a mediocre review score on Steam. Perhaps if you improved your communication skills your player base would have a much better idea - anything is better than none - of what they are actually criticizing you for.

I've played probably over 125 rounds, maybe more.  I will recommend this game based on the fact there is nothing else out on the current market like it.  

First of all Links 2003 had set the standard for PC golf back in the day.  Best sim with the most user created free courses and game functionality.  Not many bigger title golf games have really come out since then.  That being said, this game does a couple of things better than the predecessor, but is still missing the mark in some key areas.

Pros:

- Beautiful Graphics (obviously better than Links 2003)
- Nice simulation physics
- Realistic environment sounds
- Good amount of courses for the new user
- UI pretty simple to figure out
- Multiplayer and Private Matches work well
- UIpcoming User Created Course Library starting to grow

MIsses

- No commentary? Doesn't have to be a celeb.  Game feels a tad lifeless without it
- Sound file sharing - Ok I am going to be nit picky but you should have the ability to play sound files during your game whether it be in a window(snap cam) or some other way. This was one of the best features of Links that should be standardized in every golf game.
- The settings to go up and down on your shots doesn't affect the ball hardly at all.
- Some default options missing
  - Why is it every time I want to see the overhead view snap cam I have to click the button? Why can't I check a setting to leave it on? Or have the button clicked deafult to that until it's clicked off.
  - Default view of a friend playing is at an angle. I understand you can move the view around manually every time but why cannot there not be a setting to default that view to straight on like your own shot?
- $5 for an expansion course? (Bethesda)

Overall I am still enjoying and playing this game.  All of my default option gripes probably wouldn't be that big of a deal to fix. The commentary I am sure could be a lot more complicated.  At the end of the day, this is a beautiful modern fun golf sim that doesn't quite have the functionality as it's long ago predecessors.",1463013163,1463013163,True,11,3,0.582769036293029785,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The graphics are stunning. The ability to play the game at a beginner level and then add complexity as personal skill and mastery of the game increases should keep interest up for a very long time. The fact that many courses are available now (some bundled with the game, one to purchase at this time, many on line by independent designers) is a further benefit for this game. I await the arrival of the Course Forge so I design some of my own courses. 
Some of the earlier reviews mention minor glitches in the basic game and in some of the add on courses. It seems that community comments about the problems bring about speedy updates. IMHO some of the glitches make the game more interesting if one keeps one's sense of humor. As an example, one course manifests a problem with the water hazzard which requires either learning how to play the bounce off the frozen surface or how safe is it to stand on the frozen surface while chipping back to the fairway.

The graphics are so old and basic looking - Looks ok from a distance, but when you're playing it's very poor.

The actual golf game play is probably the best of all options right now if you focus solely on the swing options, physics, ball spin, wind impacts and so forth.  Also, a multiplayer lobby and a multitude of game modes are great to see, but sadly no career mode or ""pro mode"" or anything like that.

But there also are endless strange bugs and interface weirdness, especially using a controller (which is the newest way to play, so hopefully that gets worked on more).

The main hangup is the old looking graphics.  The game has no grass, really basic looking water, trees with an odd sort of sheen look to them (something weird about how they look especially in the distance) and overall just appears to my gaming eyes like something you might have thought ""looked great"" in the early to mid 2000's.  Now I'm used to such a higher bar of quality in most every other game, genre and platform, that it is really hard to look at and enjoy for me.  It's all just flat textures draped all over for the most part.  Thumbs down on that for sure.

I guess if you can get past the really old looking graphics, it's a great game of golf. But for me I can not do a ""recommend"" on it with graphics this behind the times.

This is the real deal.

The game can be as hard as you want it to be. Want to go easy on a flat green course using 3 point click on Beginner? Go for it. After a while, you'll birdie too often and want more of a challenge. No problem. There's Hacker, Amateur, Tour, and Tour Pro that'll challenge you further. These higher difficulties make swing timings more precise, resulting in shots more prone to shank if you're off just a bit. At the highest levels, you won't even be told the wind speed or direction and will have to rely on visual cues like the flag's movement. This says nothing of additional round settings like wind speeds (which can be set to weather forecasts), pin placements, green firmness, etc. You'll botch plenty of shots at first until you practice to get your swing down while you learn to master both courses and conditions. Just like in real golf.

Beyond that, there are different swing styles that change ball striking experience. Want to feel like you're actually swinging something on your PC without a gamepad? Motion Swing allows you to use your mouse as a club to swing. You'll have to literally swing back and forward both straight and within a backswing-to-forwardswing time frame ratio in order to hit your shot straight. If you have a controller, you can use joysticks. 

This is a game with a great deal of depth and multiplayer replayability with a learning curve as steep as you make it. Still, the game launched a bit prematurely. The multiplayer lobby is quirky, at best; dysfunctional, at worst. Computer opponents are wildly inconsistent, too, so to play a decent opponent, you'll have to put up with the lobby's quirkiness or practice on your own.

In spite of all of this, if you're pleased enough with the gameplay, you'll be patient in waiting for patches to remedy the game's weaknesses.

There are negative reviews about season passes that are misinformed. These passes are for additional equipment you can buy to actually hit golf balls into a net and track their flight in-game, which seems like a pretty dang cool add-on if you ask me. The developers are in no way forcing customers to pay for the base game and a season pass to play for a year.

The store also offers additional courses to purchase—currently Bethesda for $4.99. There is unwarranted outcry about this as well because the game comes bundled with plenty of courses to keep the gameplay varied enough for a good while—14 full courses if my count is right, and 2 practice ranges. Offering additional DLC content to the core game is exactly what a lot of developers do these days. It's not in the base game, so therefore, you pay more for it. Sounds fair enough.

All in all, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I do hope the developers continue to flesh out the kinks, but they've managed to produce a very solid game with gameplay that'll keep you coming back for more if the sort of golf sim you're looking for is both realistic and increasingly challenging. These two strengths make the game that much more rewarding and fun when you do get a handle on things and are able to be competitive against others in multiplayer matches.",1462545513,1462555433,True,13,2,0.52068251371383667,8,True,False,False,False,,,

With the greens settings at ""easy"" the undulation of the turf reminds one of the swells on the Bering Sea--with radical pitches and slopes. On some holes you might think you were playing mini-golf because the cup actually sits atop a mound. The AI makes improbable shots from the tee, from the fairways, and on the greens. To be fair the AI shots are sometimes what you would expect at a setting of ""1""--but then there's those ""wow"" shots. Very inconsistent. 
Also, there is no way to ""save"" your preferred settings from one session to the next. Each play time requires that you re-set everything to your preferences. 
Also, some graphics are below ""par"" (pardon the pun). I cringe everytime I look at the deformed wrists of the avatars. It looks painful!
On the positive side, the scenery is very pleasant.
I won't play this game for a month or so. Maybe there will be some significant improvements by then?
I will recommend this game based on the chance that the short-comings may get fixed.

Graphics - 6/10 by modern standards the graphics are quite poor, they chose to use directX 9 along with unity, The Graphics look ok at first but when you look closer you realise how basic they are.  Water looks terrible, no 3d grass for light rough and rough, lighting is very basic and the performance is inconsistant from course to course. I have to turn settings down on an I7 4790k@4.6ghz and a amd Fury to maintain 60fps on some courses.

Gameplay - 7/10 RTS is broken, it is way too sensitive, move the mouse back 2 pixels and thats a full back swing at 800dpi* on a 1080p screen, only increasing the screen to 1440p and the mouse DPI down to 400 is the RTS some what controlable,this is using the lowest sensitivity setting in game....

Even then there is no feel and putting is a joke, with the ball rocketing off the face after the smallest slowest movement you can possibly do with a mouse, to top this the game gives zero feedback whilst on the course has to what you are doing right or wrong, the only way to get feedback is to go to the practice area (no putting green btw), and you will get feedback through a launch monitor,  not that it will be any use to you as there is zero explination of what the numbers mean, so if you have never been on launch monitor in real life and had the number explained to you, you are screwed basically. This wasn't thought through at all and they listened to totally the wrong people when implementing this.

*Mice used Roccat Kone XTD and Corsair Vengence M65

However mouse swing using the meter isn't bad at all,  although it will be very difficult for the beginner. so max assists is recommended..

Presention - 6/10 simple menus very easy to navigate....nothing to write home about 

Value - 5/10 Thought long and hard about this, if the game was £14.99 i would say yes the game is good value for what you get, but they have released it at £26.99...and on top of that have release an extra course as day one DLC (if you have DLC ready for day one, it should be in the game at no extra cost) and are planning more micro transactions.  So id say this game isn't good value, as of now there is no career or progression system, there is a planned course designer, but has yet to materialise (no idea what its going to be like)...there is online play, and solo rounds, for a golf enthusiast maybe just enough, but for a gamer looking for something to play, £26.99 is going to be poor value.

Overall 5/10 This game offers nothing for the causual/gamer player, the learning curve is very steep, with zero understandable feedback from the game ( A launch monitor is jibberish to the none enthusiast Golfer, even to some Serious golfers), The gameplay is kind of there, you just have to put is stupid amounts of hours to find it, and you will have to go on the forums to find out what the numbers on launch monitor mean....

I do like parts of this game, but i can not recommend it (not at £26.99), so its a thumbs down from me.

Edit... I was banned from the forums for critizing thier micro transactions implementation in this game, the game is on its way to pay to win, with being able to buy balls and clubs that change the way the game plays.....Avoid this game and do not support this GREEDY developer.

Edit... I just found out that this developer is going to make you pay for ""major"" updates to the game, disguising them as DLC....So this means if you want to keep your game upto date you are going to have to keep sheling out your hard earned cash to do so, and this is after they have the nerve to charge £26.99 for a half finished game.....

Edit... This is a quote from the Dev reguarding the future of the game""Once additional Feature driven DLC is available access to play user created content will be limited to those players who are on the new version."" This means courses you create yourself you will not be able to play anymore once the DLC update is released unless you buy it....This is disgusting from the dev its not enough that you have already paid for the game, they just want to fleece you out of more money.....

Devs if you read this, its not the peoples who bought this games fault you underestemated how much this game would cost to develop and its not right to ask them to pay extra for updates, no matter how substantial the update is, The way good developers work is once you buy a licence for a game or piece of software it entitles you to updates for life, unless specifically stated...

This was not the case with this game, you waited until we had paid our money, and then unleased the news that we would have to pay money for ""milestone"" updates....Sorry but this is morally repugnant on your part, and you have shown that you are just going to milk this community for a long time to come...i really hope more people see through you.

Shame really because your game isn't bad, and if you had used directx11 from the start (oh one of things they want to charge for is porting the game to DX12)  and polished the game a little more before releasing it, the game would have sold well and you wouldn't have had to resort to such shaddy practices.",1462504377,1464319562,False,202,10,0.903297245502471924,6,True,False,False,False,,,

Specifically, the course designer for PG has been long discussed and was supposed to be in the game on release. 4 months later it's still not there. Beyond the course designer, there still is no career mode. The game still has performance issues. There still is limited character customization, no announcers, very limited stats, poor UI, etc. Essentially almost NONE of the negatives have been fixed even though many of those things have been promised. Thus I can't recommend the game because I don't see tangible progress in improving the product. 

-----

I've been arounds since PG's failed kickstarter. I bought the game as soon as it came out on Early Access. However, that doesn't make me a fan. It makes me a fan of golf games. PG does some things right. It does some things wrong. Because it's a mixed bag, it's easier to list what is good and what's bad about it. As always, YMMV.

Pros:
- numerous swing type options - there are multiple though I'm a three clicker all the way and very impressed by the smoothness of the meter. The mouse swing is challenging. They've tried to implement no-cheating modes but they broke the mouse swing while doing so.

- various levels of challenge - play this with all the aids on and you'll be in birdie city. Play this without them and you might be lucky to break 90. I'm not nearly as good as I once was, but at one point I was in the top 10 on Case's Ladder on Links and #1 on another ladder. So I'm glad it's challenging rather than the ""Shoot 48 at Augusta on Tiger Woods"" mode.

- good physics - I'm still not happy with the backspin but generally the physics are good and better than any other golf game. Backspin still is off and I generate more backspin on my short irons (and I shoot in the 90s) than my avatar in this game. Other than that they're spot on. For instance, if you play a course at higher elevation the ball will travel further. That's a nice touch.

- weather / time of day settings can add some real challenge to your game. I think the wind feels spot-on.

- many different courses to choose from and quite a few to download

- multiple modes of gameplay, including solo, multiplayer and tournaments with match play, team play, alt shot, etc.

- no micro-transactions that improve your game

- no stupid characters that drive the ball 400 yards. Over-driving distance ruins so many golf games and they've prevented that here.



Cons:
- no career mode built into the game yet

- course designer hasn't been released yet (it's now 4 months late and counting)

- I don't like the way the skies look and the trees can look a little jagged

- limited current player animations (no lefties, no females yet though they're coming)

- very,very, very limited character customization

- it requires a decent computer and user made courses don't always run well. In fact, the user made courses often exceed the RAM allowance in the game causing major problems from a chunky swing meter to crashing.

- slightly too limited shot shaping options. I wish I could position my swing path and feet differently to get inventive when shotmaking. 

- very limited stats

- no announcer and limited sound effects

- no Steam Workshop integration (a cardinal sin for a game with downloadable courses)

- really poor and frankly butt-ugly user interface when you enter the game (though it's fine when actually playing a round)


So it's up to you whether to buy it. I can tell you it's a better game than that ""other"" golf game on Steam and probably the best one available on the market today. But it's by no means perfect yet (pun intended) and while I had hoped that many of the cons would be fixed, this doesn't seem to be happening. The product feels more and more abandoned with a lack of substantial progress since release. 

If you want a golf game now, this is the one to buy becuase frankly it's probably your only decent choice. Since I'm a fan of the old Links games and golf games in general so I continue to load up PG from time to time. But if you aren't a golf nut, this game isn't for you because it's just too limited in the features and progress to appeal to a wider audience.",1462490079,1473727954,False,4,0,0.575729012489318848,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I have to change my initial review as the core content on the game remains unchanged.
Esssentially this a lifeless game without any atmosphere or real point to it.
It reminds me of golf games from long ago on PC. Games like links and then the Arnold Palmer games were lifeless slogs around beautifully rendered(for their time) courses.
This game has no career mode, virtually no tournaments and liitle point to playing it
The few tournaments that exist are run via an external forum and you only play if you fullfil their unreasonably strict criteria. As is the norm with forums, the adminstrators control everything. 
I have given up even bothering to enter them as its such a conveluted process.

Its rather sad that this is another game left to wallow in such a poor state.

If you want a good game of golf via PC then look elsewhere
If suffer from insomnia and need a good nights sleep, then I recommend playing this game just before going to bed.

It's a far cry from what I remember PGA to be on xbox(which is what I was hoping this would match up to), but for the most part a good game of golf.

It's tricky to get used to and there are a few basic features which I really feel need to be added. The UI/UX desperatly needs to be improved. For example, the 'select' button could toggle an overlay of controls for a joypad as for me that button was unused and I found myself getting lost in controls.

A strength indicator should be added - % backswing versus % follow through to give a measurement of power as you take the shot, coupled with a visual aid of how straight your follow through was would be great as sometimes you draw/fade when you feel confident your follow through was perfect.

Putting seems to be very random. I found it very hard to get a consistent putt.

Draw/Fade/forward/backspin seem to have very little effect for me, and the roll of a green seems to be a bit un responsive... but this could be because I've only played a couple of hours.

Firstly this is quite possibly the best golf game in recent years that i have played certainly better than alot of past titles (im looking at you EA) liking the motion swing and i really like the way the shots just feel right.

The graphics though not amazing are really good, though really what can you do with a golf game graphically without taking away from the whole simulation end of it. I would add though that the course that i played on seemed lifeless, i mean it would be great even in solo play to see some other people or a caddy or something. Also noticed a little bit of jitter on the comet trail when the ball starts to drop after the peak of the shot.

AI is needed for solo play 

The only other bad thing i can think of is the sound design, in florida glades i can hear the ambience track looping. This may not sound like that big of a gripe but once you notice it it becomes infuriating and to have the same sound effect on all 18 holes in the track... well just play it and you will understand. I dont know if this is the same in the other courses but this must be a testament to how good the game is i cant wait to find out cos it is a brilliant game.

Also. this is early access but i couldnt help but notice there is a pro shop... all the values are $0 at the moment but i cant help but wonder if this is going to become a game that ends up cashing in big style after its release. If you can win money during games thats okay but if you are going to be asking $200 for a golf club that absolutely obliterates any competition this game is going to go south fast! 

Other than that early access is good i like it and i will continue to play more of it.. And now im late for work bye""

This is the first simulation that I have ever played that generates all those same emotions. The satisfaction at a great shot, the disbelief when the very next shot takes you into the rough, the failure to understand where it went wrong! It is an amzing simulation. I know the golf angle are sometimes peculiar, especially when stand up hill on a steep incline, I know that recovery from that situation is a lot easier than in real life, but wow! I love it.

Do not wait for the retail version, get in there on early access and start enjoying the experience. It also helps the development as this is just a small indie operation. Even if it was never developed further I would love it.

Brilliant simulation
Fabulous Graphics
Amazing detail

Bon jeux... Mais loin d'etre terminer. J'ai jamais su comment quitter une game. 

Honetement j ai penser a refund. Mais je laisse une chance. Le gameplay est bien mais vraiment buggy par moment.

Oublier le multiplayer pour l'instant les games sont tres rare!!! J'aimerais tant.

Manque de tuto. Tu te ramasse dans la game tu sais pas trop quoi faire au debut. Exemple:

La semaine passe j'ai mis le PC dans le salon pour jouer car ma blonde aime jouer au golf. Tout allais bien. J'avais apris le jeux je lui ai montrer comment jouer. Cool beau samedi on a fait une bonne game.

Mais la cette semaine il on changer la maniere de swinger... je trouve finalement une game multiplayer! Et bang le swing est diffrent d'il y a 5 jours! C'est ok, au pire, c'est un jeux en dev. mais montrer des tuto, des update in game.

Je vais pas voir le forum avant chaque game!

Steam manque de jeux de ce genre. J'aimerais tant une bonne comunautee dans ce jeux mais je crois que c'est une reve!


Je conseil mais pas trop d'attente! Je jeux reste quand meme bien fait!

The reason i have taken pen to paper (kind of) is to explain how wonderful this game is. People have commented on how good value for money this game is but it is so much more than that. This is the best, most immersive game of golf on any platform anywhere. I have played PS4 games of golf, other PC games and none of them compare to the qualities that this game has. I am pleased that i was on board from day one and have supported this game from the beginning as it has turned out to be a truly wonderful game. 
We are still in the very early stages of this game with so much more to come but the highest recommendation i can give this game is, if it was left where it is today i would still play on it each and every day. It is that good. 
If you love playing golf, whether alone or with a group of friends or a bigger community, then look no further. If you enjoyed the old style links then this is its bigger beautiful sister..with all the bells and whistles on it that we could have only dreamed about back in the day.
I cannot recommend this game highly enough. With the soon to be released 'Course Forge' (course creator) and a multitude of courses being released by skillful, talented designers...the future is bright for Perfect Golf.....

Obviously, with an early access, there are things that are needed and things that are fine as is. So far, I can say confidently that the heart is beating in this game. Visually it's appealing and the game-play engine itself is a good start. Some of the issues at this point, I hesitate to mention, again because I suspect every feature and tweak I would like to see has been accounted for by the developers and they are working on it. That being said: 

The menus need work and making changes to the settings on the fly is clunky. The types of shots are limited at the moment and needs attention, as does the power meter and putting helpers. Right now, they don't really make much sense and seem arbitrary. There's no way to punch shots through or accurately alter spin the way the real game allows. The power meters and putting grids also are somewhat of a mystery and don't seem to be designed to let the player really know exact measurements. This may be on purpose, but still this is a sim and not real life, so we need some way to benchmark our swings and fades, etc...

 It needs a player history system so I can go back and review my previous rounds, and of course, it needs more courses. I hope most of all, the developers are going to be able to make a deal with the PGA for rights to their courses and tournament play, but even if it remains simply a non-PGA golf simulation, that's fine on its own. If you want to learn the game and progress without getting bored, I think this will be a good title someday. I hope it is sooner than later.

added: May 5, 2016: 
Now that the supposed general release has been pushed out, I felt I need to comment further on this game. As I said in my earlier review, the heart of a good game was there, and I was hoping Perfect Parrellel was working hard on the serious issues in the engine. Apparently, they are working harder on the marketing and getting Jack Nicklaus to put his name on a game that is FAR, FAR from finished. 

I'm wondering if the makers of this game couldn't care less about the gamers in Steam and are more interested in the Golf Simulators out there than can use this software. Because right now, us gamers are getting no love from the game. 

A few points for the developers, which I hope read this: 

...The putting mechinism is simply awful. Damn near unplayable. It's swing mechanics are inconsistent and clunky. There is no context to the power of the swing and they give little to no credible way to read the greens. It needs serious re-tooling before this game can be considered top notch. 

...there is no way to craft shots and the chipping and pitching is abysmal and inconsitent. You'll never hit the same shot twice in the same conditions. 

...the swing meter, which is the only way most gamers are going to play this game, is baffling and inconsistent. it gives no power context either but even if it did, you can never re-create shots no matter how hard you try. 

I'm holding out hope this will improve, but if this is now considered a released game, I'm not holding my breath that major changes to the engine are coming.

updated: June 17

...a few of the patches and fixes are helping on some of the issues I pointed out in May. Putting seems to have normalized somewhat. It's getting better about giving enough clues to read a green. Still, I think the grid needs to be smaller squares and the BLI is a little clunky, but better. 

...still though, chipping and pitching are so frustrating. Practice is one thing, but inconsistency in the UI and the game engine is something else. Pitching and chipping still is a nightmare of randomness. Random in that you never ever know how your chip or pitch is going to react in any situation. it's impossible to recreate a shot that has the same variables and the engine will flatout fail you by over shooting or undershooting even though the power, lie and variables might be the same. NEEDS ATTENTION NOW.

...crafting shots is still a major problem. the shot maker function just doesn't work for lowering or raising your trajectory. It works left and right, but not up and down. 

...still worth it, as this is a simulation and not an arcade, ,and as long as they don't morph into a pay to win model, I will continue to recommend it.",1457501514,1466166956,True,5,1,0.525521636009216309,0,True,False,True,False,,,

For an early access game it's quite polished already and the course selection out of the box is good. Course Forge and user created courses... I can't wait! The 3 point click system works well, the draw/fade controls are very impressive. The hole map is good showing where your shots should be landing for par. 

On the down side, the biggest deffiency I've found is the post-shot screen... It'll tell me how far I've hit it, how far to the flag but it doesn't tell me where the ball is laying, fairway, green, sand, rough etc. I can only find out by watching one of the replay options (which are awesome btw!), sometimes I just want to get on with it. 

There's also some work to be done on long distance rendering of the ball, not a big deal though. On rare occassions I can also set the aim marker but the player doesn't re-adjust, like I said it's rare and for an early access game the occassinal quirk is expected. 

I'm very pleased with perfect Golf, I should be going to bed but I might sneak in another round!

I own others but now only play this one. The big difference for me is the swing mechanic. On the higher difficulty settings the real-time-swing actually requires a skilled effort at the swing. Other games I have played recently (such as TGC) are OK but the swing on those just seems so easy - also like you go on auto-pilot when swinging - and gets a little boring. Not so with Perfect Golf as you need to pay attention to your swing.

I also like that the physics of the game determine where the ball ends up - it is not predetermined as some other games are.

Graphics are decent as well, but I don't have a high end video card and so cannot comment much on that aspect. All I can say is that it is comparable to other recent PC golf titles I have played.

As for the number and variety of courses, it is getting better now with more user-designed courses being released.  In my opinion the variety and quality of courses is what is important rather than sheer numbers. Currently, even in early access, I see variety of courses in Perfect Golf getting better and better. They are quality tracks with a good range of difficulties available.  As the Perfect Golf course designing community grows there will be even more courses of varying visual styles getting released on top of an already great set of courses.

No modern golf game has come close.  That is until PerfectGolf was released.  

The graphics are top notch and very realistic.  You can see all of the undulations and slopes on the fairways/greens very clearly unlike some golf games.  The addition of trees and bushes from SpeedTree last year improved the visuals a great deal.  The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s Turf Effects tool.

The newly implemented Real Time Swing for controller and mouse has enhanced the game immeasurably in addition to the availability to download fine user made courses (around 24 available as of the date of this review).  That brings the current number of stock and user made courses up to around 37, a number no other modern golf game can touch.  These course numbers will continue to grow and grow once the CourseForge tool comes out and also once the developers start making licensed courses available.  

Online play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to tee off with up to 8 players.  You can stop and resume your round at a later time.  There are loads of different play modes available in PerfectGolf.  If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online as well as ones on onlinegolftour.net.  The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last shot from a number of different angles.  Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.

Another big plus for PerfectGolf is the freecam mode which allows you to more effectively read putts and scope out your next shot, even while your online opponent is getting ready to hit.  Take a virtual tour of the entire course from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.

PerfectGolf has lived up to its potential as superb golf simulation.  Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month.  This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come.  Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.

It was already a solid performer with its 3-click and Motion Swing (mouse) swing interfaces. but the all new Real Time Swing - Mouse (RTS-Ml) and Real Time Swing - Controller (RTS-C) broadens the appeal of the game by more dynamically engaging the senses in a live process.

Both RTS-C and RTS-M require a sensual mastery over an analog control mechanism that has a reasonable and rewarding learning curve.  There are also 5 levels of difficulty to help you wade into the world of real time swing interfaces at a level suited to any skill set.  I've been a real time swing controller fan since Links 2004 on the original XBox, and Perfect Golf's RTS-C has finally taken a controller swing interface through the portal that Links 2004's opened and added dimensions to its performance that uncannily model the nuances of a golf swing in a manner I wouldn't have ever dreamed would be possible with a controller.

 I'm a slightly better than average skill player, and I've managed to break par only 3 times in 50+ rounds, using ""Hacker"" difficulty (the scale runs Beginner, Hacker, Amateur, Pro, Tour Pro) with my XBox 360 wired controller.  Some would say that someone who's used to shooting 62 - 66 in a computer golf game would be frustrated by this.  Au contraire, I find it stimulating to be challenged to fully think out and execute every shot.  A fairway or green in regulation is something you don't take for granted with RTS-C.  What keeps me going is I am seeing a gradual improvement in my game as I become more familiar with the intricately scaled analog interace the game uses.  I'm probably only a few weeks away from stepping up to Amateur!

Perfect Golf has so much more to offer besides its cutting edge interface options.  Its course creation suite called ""Course Forge"" has already given birth to a couple dozen user created courses, many of which are commercial quality.  RobC's Bandon Dunes is as good as any of the stock courses that come with the game.  PG also has a bevy of multiplayer options in its Multiplayer Lobby, in addition to having an ongoing chat room from which you can discuss the game and learn from others.  There's also a facility to support user created tournaments that is proving to be popular with community sites like OnlineGolfTour.net, which hosts a number of Tours and Tournaments of various difficulty and control types, in addition to reviewing and hosting downloadable, user created courses.

Keep in mind that Perfect Golf is still in Early Access and is still being refined.

Real life golf is frustrating, but very rewarding if you can achieve success, and to do that, it takes some work.  This game is the same way, you have to put some time in to get some success - but it can be fun on the way due to the high quality courses available upon which to play.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the quailty of the courses, both the ones supplied by default in the game, and the user designed courses which so far have proven to be of as high a quality as the default courses.
My favorite method of play (swing type) is the newly implemented Real Time Swing - Motion Swing which is proving to be very immersive giving you the feeling that you are really on a golf course and not sitting in front of a computer.
Some of the new courses and swing type changes is stirring more interest in this game and there is quite a community of active players who hang out in the lobby for online multiplayer games.  There is also a site which offers weekly tournaments seemlessly integrated into the game with nearly 100 players signed up at the tour pro level (the one I play).  I do not know how many play in the other level tournaments, I suspect that it is 100s more.  There are currently no additional costs to fully participate in the game, courses, lobby or tournaments (although the tournament host does solicit donations on the website through a button).  Eventually there will be premium content for purchase (licensed courses, and accesories which will only be cosmetic and not give you an advantage in the game), but that content will not be necessary to enjoy the game.
There will be a program called course forge which will allow anyone who purchases this game to design beautiful course the same way that the original ones were developed.  The current crop of user developed courses were designed by beta testers of course forge.  Course forge will come out when the game exits Early Access, probably sometime this year (but don't quote me).

Pluses - gameplay is rich, not repetitive, due to realistic physics and variability
              interest in the game is growing, lots of partners/opponents available
              developer is active, listens to gamers suggestions and incorporates improvements
              game works on multiple platforms including golf simulators

Minuses - game requires modern computer graphics power to enjoy smooth gameplay
                 players who want instant gratification may be disappointed with learning curve

A recent update added quite a few community made courses (along with updates to the stock courses in the game) and also added several new swing styles. 

A wide range of swing styles are available:

Traditional 3-click with a power meter

Motion Swing with the mouse that has a meter on the screen (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically)

Real Time Swing with the mouse (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically.  No meter on the screen but the player animation moves in concert with the mouse movement) 

Real Time Swing with a controller 

The game can also be played on a home golf simulator.  



The motion swings are my personal favorites.  Tempo has a large part in determining the outcome of the shot (as well as swing path and heel/toe hits)  so it's not as simple as straight back/straight through.  A truly wonderful way to play PC golf.  


There are also a wide range of difficulty options so you can jump right in and enjoy the game.  The easier levels are a great introduction to the game.  Casual player or just want to have a fun round?  It's here.  
   
The highest levels of difficulty are quite tough but it doesn't feel unfair or gimmicky.  If you can control your swing, you can still score well.  If you're not playing well, it can be a real grind, but  it is so rewarding when you put a good swing on the ball.  A great option for the hardcore sim player. 

The course designs are beautiful and the ball physics are the best I've seen in a PC golf game.  A wide range of stimp settings are available for the green speeds, several firmness settings for the fairways, and several settings for pin positions.    

Currently there are about 33 courses in the game, as well as a large driving range and a short game practice area. 

 
The game is still in Early Access so things are still being worked on.  Things not yet included in the game but are planned for the future:

-Career mode

-Assortments of clothing/animations/clubheads/balls/shafts etc... 

-Course building software

-More courses

-Improved AI for the CPU players

-Country clubs and tournaments


There currently is a REALLY good third party tournament site that hosts weekly tournaments for various skill levels as well as fun ancillary events.  

They have an automatic scoring system set up that will keep track of your scores and stats after each round and maintains them on their site.  They also maintain different tours, world rankings, money leaders, ongoing season stats, etc.. and it's free to join.  A very well run tour.

The Devs have obviously worked very hard to add so much to the game, Such as new swing methods, including  real time mouse swing and real time controller swing. I think the controller swing will be a big plus to those that have played golf games on xbox  or playstation. Also now available for free are user made courses. While the Course forge has not been released yet to the general public those that were Beta testing it made some courses which you can now download and play in the game. This in itself is a huge step forward and with them being free it should open the doors for many that were a bit hesitant about the game. The life blood in my opinion of a golf game is the ability to add courses and play them for free. I know this was not the direction that  the game first looked at going but PP have listened to the feed back of the community and have changed their mind. This was a game breaker decision for me and probably for many more. The fact that PP listened and heard all the pro's and con's of free user made courses then decided that this is what the community wanted in itself  is not a small thing. How many times with other games have suggestions been made but fall on deaf ears. I can assure you I know of more then one or two. This isn't the only time that PP has listened to the community and either changed something or improved on it. That is huge for instilling confidence as a consumer that they actually do read the forums and not just pay lip service to it. 

When course forge is released to the public the list of courses will grow by a vast margin as many of us will try our hand at designing. Now some will fiddle with it and give up but others will hang in there to try and grasp all the challanges it will bring. Still the thought of getting real terrain data and to be able to create a real course with realistic terrain and elevation has me very excited. I too wondered if it was ever going to see the light of day but with this new update there is no doubt in my mind it will happen. 

So if you want to try a different kind of golf game of one where the devs do  listen to the community (That of course doesn't mean we always get our way but heck at least they take the time to respond and explain why they choose a way of doing something ) Then don't hesitate to get the game. I think in the near future you will see even bigger and better things to come and if you love to play golf games now is the time to get in on the action. Come check it out at the PP forums.

They have talked about the countless options (everybody will find a setup to his liking). They talked about the renditions of real courses, the four different swing mechanics, the absolute realistic looking graphics and the simlike character of the game.

So i want to tell you a story what all this really means if you are standing on the golf course in Perfect Golf:

I played an online tournament and was standing on the 17th tee at TPC Sawgrass (it is called Florida Glades in the game). I was 2 behind the leader who was already in the clubhouse. Many of you will know the traditional pin position on Sundays. In the corner right of the green only a few yards away from the water. So i needed birdie but the wind was coming hard from the right. To make things worse: my stock shot is a little draw - i developed that in a lot of hours on the practice range - yes, on the practice range. The game is easy to pick up in the lowest difficulty level. But if you want to play at the tour pro level, you have to hit a lot of golf balls on the range to get good enough to beat par.

So, now. I had to make birdie. I had to change my natural movement of the mouse in order to move the ball from left to right against the wind - and i was in between clubs. Should i swing harder to gain a little more length and a lot of spin (yes, the game has this priciple of golf physics in!!) with a higher danger of mishitting the shot? Or should i club up take a partial swing and try to land it a little short (water on 17th!!) and let it run towards the hole?

Decisions, Decisions. Yes, you have to make them in Perfect Golf, like on a real golf course. But you CAN make them, because the game offers every shot you can perform in real life. That is the real immersion of Perfect Golf.

Perfect Golf is playing golf on your screen - it's not playing a video game named golf!

If you don't have it in your library and are a fan of sports games, you simply cannot hesitate! Perfect Golf is by far the best simulation of the game of golf i have ever played - and it is still in early access. There are a lot of things to come.

P.S.: I overcutted my tee shot on the 17th because i had not enough muscle memory for that special shot. Made double bogey and haven't won. Did it matter? No, cause i love this game!",1456001678,1456001678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The Community is very vocal on ideas and what they feel is the right or wrong way yo implement things,and being a good Dev 9 out of 10 things happen the community way.
This alwayas bodes well where the Devs are closely looking at what the customer wants on this side I cannot fault them.
They do have there own forum which probably gets a little more feedback than steam http://www.perfectparallel.com/home from there you can get to the Community pages and discuss your likes and dislikes.
Not all ideas make it through but it helps the Devs know how the crowd are feeling and obviously bug reporting is a massive help.

I have now also found other Beta courses that you can play via the http://www.onlinegolftour.net/course-reviews.html and if you  are a little tech savvy adding them to the stock courses is not an issue.

The Game is a little PC intensive so please look at min specs advised before giving the Devs grief because it may look poor on your PC/Laptop.

They are aware that there are still some tech things to tweak and more GUI tweaks but the game is so so playable that I would say to all ""old school"" PC golf gamers come get it.

I have tried the other big Golf game on Steam but for me there is no comparison,this just feels great and there are three types of ways to control the game,as far as I know its 3 cCick,Mouse Swing and Gamepad Controller so plenty of variety for any new player.

Mostly Links (and all its iterations), TW (didn’t like it), WGT since 2007, tinkered around with The Golf Club (never could get the hang of their motion swing), and now Perfect Golf. Each game has its own pros and cons, its own pluses and minuses; however, PG has shown me it is far and above best golf game out there.

I am anxiously awaiting the 1.3.9.0 release due this weekend. For a mere $20US (for the EA edition), players wanting the best computer game to come along since Links, get on board the Perfect Golf train… you won’t be disappointed.

The game can be very challenging or more relaxing, depending on what level you choose to play at and what aids you select to help your golfing experience.  I think eveyone can find a method to play to make Perfect Golf one of the most enjoyable golf games you've ever played.  I would [u]highly[/u] recommend this game to all computer golfers!    

What follows in this review is a lengthy discussion of some of the features (not all of them) provided in the game - analogous to the list of options the game provides!

I bought Perfect Golf when it first became avialable in Early Access.  I played the Links series of golf, and played a very small bit with the PGA/TW series.  To me, PG is bit more similar to Links than TW games, but it's not a new version of Links.  The game developments over the first 13 months of early access have come reasonably steadily and each one providing new features and bug fixes of the reported issues.  I have complete faith that this will continue for however long early access continues; with the present state of the game, I suspect it won't be much more than a few more months until release (but that is only my guess).

The game requires surprisingly (to me) high hardware requirements to get the most detail from the game.  The most important thing is you video card.  You really need to have a dedicated video card; an on-board video card will not deliver the experience that players will want, even at the lowest quality settings of the game.  However, lower end systems and middle-of-the-road systems with dedicated video cards can generally run the game reasonably well.

Perfect Golf can be a very difficult golf game - perhaps as difficult as the real game for some.  However, there are many aids that can be employed to make the game more relaxing.  There are currently four options for input methods:
- a ""traditional"" style 3-click swing meter suing the mouse button
- game controller with thumbstick on the personal computer
- mouse movement, now available in a real-time format, so the golfer swings as you move the mouse
- golf simulator hardware (Trackman 3/4, Foresight GC2, SkyTrack)

The 3C swing uses a round meter which is pretty familiar to most computer golf players.  I believe the 1.3.9.0 update coming in February 2016 will have an option to make the player avatar move as 3C swing meter moves.  I'm not familiar with the controller methods, so I can't comment on this input method.  The mouse movement method allows you to change the direction of movement from vertical to horizontal as well as the sensitivity to allow for various DPI settings in your mouse configuration as well as various resolution settings for the game itself (4K, HD, VGA, etc.).  The mouse swing can optionally be set as a real-time swing.  I also cannot comment on the simulator input, but from what I've read from those fortunate to have simulator hardware, all very much enjoy Perfect Golf.

I really enjoy the challenge of the game using a horizontal mouse swing.  I haven't tried the real-time swing yet, but I definitely will be giving it a go.  I like how you can control the ball movement by making a different path with the mouse, and thus imparting draw/hook spin or fad/slice spin as required for the shot.  The physics of sideslopes, uphill/downhill lies, wind and elevation effects in the game provide the most realistic ball flight I've seen in golf games.  

Courses designed in the Course Forge by users wil become avilable for all players very soon.  The previews of the courses as well as a few that have been released by Perfect Parallel with the game so far have been very good.  I suspect there will be many more coming, but I also suspect they will all of be good quality and not something slapped together in a few minutes or hours.  

There are many modes of play (stroke/medal play, solo/team match play, and others) as well as the option to play online against other live players from around the world.  There are limimted number of official tournaments at this time, but other web sites, such as the Online Golf Tour or OGT, provide a very good complement to Perfect Golf.  I suspect after the game is release, Perfect Parallel will provide more official tournaments, but it's always good to have optiosn with other tournament providers as well!  OGT will also host user-created courses for free download/addition to the game.

One of the few drawbacks in the 1.3.9.0 build of the Perfect Golf may be the lack of a career mode.  Many computer golfers want this, but it won't be provided by Perfect Parallel until after the release of the game.  The ongoing development of the game after release should ensure that a detailed and realistic career mode will be provided, based on the attention to detail and reality that Perfect Parallel have exhibited in the game thus far.  I have no doubt that whatever is eventually provided will be very enjoyable.

Perfect Golf is currently only available on the computer (Windows, Mac, Linux), but Perfect Parallel have indicated it will be ported to XBox One and PS4, although no timetable has been provided.  Again, I strongly recommend Perfect Golf for any computer golf fan.  It's a steal for the price and will likely provide many hours of entertainment!!",1455909442,1455909442,True,10,2,0.499440133571624756,0,True,False,True,False,,,

First off, you can play this across many operating systems. You aren't limited to Windows only. Secondly, so far this game is showing strong graphics without requiring the top of the line in hardware. These developers are walking a fine line in that regard and so far winning it. Thirdly, there is already a solid online community for this game, for people looking for casual play or competitve play.

As for the game play itself it is very intuitive for the most part. I did have to look up a few things that aren't immediately evident from just jumping in and playing (like how to change clubs or shot types) but the learning curve is overall low. The courses available now are all top notch with a few real courses in there, and there are a lot in development soon to be released.

So what is it?  It's a golf sim.  It's targeted at people who want the feel of real golf.  Good physics, accurately rendered real courses, lots of camera options.

The game does lack a lot of features that modern gamers probably expect, career modes, avatar customisation, tee options etc.  But you have to keep in mind it's an indie title.  I'm not sure how big the development team is, but I doubt it's huge.  They've been making steady improvements and constantly provide informative feedback.  Progress has been slow, but the patient have been rewarded and they're getting close to a polished product as I write this.  Even those who have been hammering the developers with criticisms re: the physics are starting to quite down as adjustments are made.

There has been some controversy regarding the direction Perfect Parallel will take regarding a possible subscription service to play user made courses.  I too am concerned, but to give the game a thumbs down based on something that hasn't happened yet is unfair.

Ignore the 6/10 average.  As a fairly cheap Early Access game, it gets an 8 from me.  If you love your golf give it a go, get on the forums and help make it into something magnificent.",1451438124,1451438124,True,7,2,0.507467508316040039,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This review is less about the quality of the game than the business practices of the developer.  In all reality they want you to buy a game labled ""Early Access"", then sign up for a monthly subscription plan, so you can buy additional courses at a ""discount""!  Really?  

The game itself is OK, albeit I feel neither physics or game play are up the standard set by The Golf Club.  The world feels very sterile, and one advantage, true multiplayer, is really not worth much either as the number of concurent players that I have seen is only around 30.

 I do, however, have one major complaint, that being the lack of a full range of practice facilities. In the real world I spend much of my golf time practicing the short game; pitching, chipping, putting and sand traps. Unfortunately all one can really do in PG in the way of practice is go to the range.  I do find aspects of the short game hard to adjust to in PG (particularly chipping weight) and would welcome the opportunity to be able to go to a practice green, place my ball wherever I wish, and try different clubs, swing types, etc.

I would like to think this is in the works and can appreciate the challenges it may create, however to be ranked a great, if not the greatest golf game, it simply has to be part of the package.

With just a standard mouse $7 cheapo the game plays pretty good and has the overall feel of golfing on the course. You can play 3 Click or with Mouse swing currently. The courses they have so far are really nice and some you will be able to remember seeing before as they are real PGA golf courses. Scoring was not too bad, it does depend on the level you play with and how well you can do with the controls on the system you have. I managed to break par on beginner, but Pro level has still kept me over par.

There is a gameroom and multiplayer to find matches. They have also just introduced AI golfers that you can set up to play matches with you as well.  There are several different gameplay options like strokeplay, skins, matchplay, etc.. You can change the weather, wind, stimp of the greens, tees. and other settings to increase difficulty.

A Course Designer is coming called The Course Forge that really looks nice.  It does need to be used with Unity to lay out the Base Terrain. After you make your initial terrain you would use the CF to apply the different fairways, greens, bunkers, distances, tees, course objects, etc....

I like that the game has a game lobby and discussion area - unlike TGC.
It is in early access now so I presume it will eventually have some needed additional features such as:
1) ability to better personalize the golfer avatars,
2) ability to play multiplayer in a ready golf style to speed up play - for example, players could watch each other tee off, then they would proceed individually to their own balls and hit simultaneously, until they were close to or on the green, then could watch each other putt, If I remember correctly golf games with online multiplayer in the past did something like this.
3) more courses - including player made.
This all said, I purchased an additional copy of the early access version to play online with my friend. So I definitely recommend it.",1444699647,1444699647,True,4,2,0.500792384147644043,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The mouse swing is way cool... I had to check out a video on youtube for a tutorial ... BUT it makes the game!  The graphics have some tweaking for sure, but the trees, water, and sunlight with the weather....look very nice. I would like to see more fluff stuff on ball striking and grass flying etc.. The quiet intensity of the game is being captured for sure. There are many skill adjustments so all are challenged.  Online play: I just played a game and it was smooth with two of us.  He was on PC, I am on MAC.  Looking forward to being able to edit the players ""look"" and the other improves that are coming.   Now: if I can just get my sons to buy it!

I write this about 5 months after my initial review. The game is playing much better these days. Find myself trying to get a round in almost every day. Maybe the time away and the updates when I booted up after some time off did the trick. I run on a pretty quality system so I don't know if system quality (or lack thereof) explained the earlier issues. All that aside, it is running pretty smooth now. I'm starting to really enjoy it again. I have a few gripes but they're pretty minor. Would like to control spin more, especially on wedge shots. Can't seem to get legitimate back spin ever. That said, I love the challenge this game takes to shoot a solid score. 

At this point, I'd really like to see the accessibility to the other features of the game get easier. I don't have any steam ""friends"" who play the game so I can never get in on any multiplayer matches. Would be really nice if the companion site became a great resource for players of the game. I would love to enter more tournaments, access a ""career mode"" (I don't think that game mode is available yet), etc. Also, I have no idea how to download all these courses that I'm seeing people play on. Games like ""Banished"" have a simple subscription model for mods and additions to the game. I can't figure out how to add those for this game. This could very well be a case of my own ignorance. 

All in all, I'm changing my review to favorable from initially negative. Could be an awesome game in due time. Hopefully sooner than later!


(Original Review Below)

I can't seem to get this game to work. I bought it a long time ago from the early access and as far as I can tell the game has just gotten worse and it has been awhile since the release. I now can't even find a resolution acceptable enough in the graphics option for the game to work. Set the resolution too high, and the game is insanely laggy. Completely unplayable. Set the resolution to low and it's accompanied with a bunch of bugs. As I click the meter, the screen switches from wide screen zoom to regular, and then after I finish the swing, it goes completely black for a few seconds. Disappointed in the evolution of the game from the beginning. Best to focus only on smooth gameplay, and build from that. It seems the dev team has tried to add random features that really have never come to fruition and somehow they've compromised the quality of play along the way... Valiant effort. Still can be recovered I guess but we'll see.",1444514106,1459387139,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Rating 1-10

Realism = 10
Graphics, physics and RTS and you feel like your on the course. Just set the difficulty level to match your real game or lower it to beat the real Pros. If your a masochist just play Tour Pro and Real time swing but be prepared to shoot a higher score then you do in real life. I'm not sure the RTS Tour Pro level can ever be mastered, but time will tell.

Graphics = 9.5
Color and textures are awesome, Other then walking out my back door to the course i believe it's as close as you can get.

Physics = 9
It has varied quite a bit over the updates and it's just getting better

Swing types = 10 
Three click, Motion Swing is awesome, Real Time Swing just added and love it, it brings me to my real game of golf. 

Game play = 6-9 
Varies due to updates and working bugs out each update, which is pretty timely and usually the same day for a major bug on new update release day. Swing difficulty options are numerous and you can adjust as you progress. Career mode upcoming and Season of play at off sites (OnlineGolfTour.net). Community small but growing. Shift WASD Key for shot setup would be great one day. Icon next to player to verify swing type or filter to allow only certain swing types. I get some game freezes and disconnects at times, but again early access. Older end pc's may have some issues on Higher graphic settings. With all that PG is my game of choice

Course Quality = 9 
Colors and textures are very nice. Older end pc's may have some issues on Higher graphic settings. 

Course Creation = 6
Just improved with last update and seem to be rolling out for user created courses of Beta Course Forge. Full release of Course Forge Pending and untried by me personally.

Player ANI = 6
Work in progress, clothing options just added. Equipment updates are in the works

Compared to other Golf games, the Best out there if you want the actual feel of playing golf in motion swing or Real Time Swing. 

Early Access its a bargain and it's only getting better, for some it can be frustrating with updates and working through bug issues. For $20 my playtime in game is down to 1 cent per hour.",1443445347,1456504161,True,7,2,0.523570835590362549,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I will give a direct pro/cons list for easy navigating.

Pros:
-Realistic ball physics
-Nuances of real golf
-Innovative swing design and a familiar classic 
-Great community
-Active Devs
-Actively works with the PGA

Cons:
-Multiplayer needs to be sped up
-UI is clean and tidy but parts feel clunky not well explained (keep in mind early access/development)
-Player customization is coming but not yet here

Some of the cons are being addressed by the devs but since they aren't in game yet they will remain in cons. Been burned by too many other game developers to be positive about upcoming changes until they are already in game.

However if you want to help in its development then this is the perfect time to buy it. This game as a golf sim has so much potential and can be very challenging if you turn all the aids off. There are patches been applied, but because it’s a small development team they are few and far between. The graphics leave much to be desired, considering its 2015, the graphics are reminiscent of a game released in the late 90’s, I am sure that will also be improved in time.
There are currently only a few limited courses, unlike TGC (The Golf Club, by HB Studios) there is no course creator, so there are no community submitted courses to play on, which is a real shame as it’s something that would attract more players to this game.  This game has been developed for PC and I think it’s due for release on the consoles too.
It's now been several months on since this game was released. Its had many patchs which has improved this game even more. The graphics are still retro, but there is talk of improving this soon. As far as golf sim's go, then there is nothing out there that gets close to it. The game play is really solid and improves with each patch released.
The introduction of AI and the horizontal swing meter has in my opinion improved this game even better. The AI still needs some tweaking, but it's great to play against the computer, and you can also adjust the AI's skill level.
As I've mentioned before this is the only true golf sim out there, so a lot of practice is required if you want to play this game well.

Top impressions include: stunning procedural computer graphics (my machine is Apple iMac w/ i5 CPU) and the best golf physics engine I've seen on a game ever. Like real golf, Perfect Golf isn't easy. You won't be breaking par anytime soon, and perhaps ever if you turn off all the ""aids"" and tackle the courses at the hardest settings levels. I'm a former 3 handicapper and take my real golf seriously. There are no gizmos and fake PGA tour galleries...just great, accurate physics simulated golf. This is good virtual training for good real golfers and will help you hone your 'course management' skills.

No fps's, fast rts's or sports games, just click and click some more.  This is perfect in that regard.  Unfortunately though, whie easy to play, the graphics are painfully dull and the ambiance needs work.  If you're going to stare at the screen at least make the textures detailed or the models more defined.  The default character golfer is pretty low poly, now whether that's a design decision because they're using Unity, I don't know, but I've seen higher poly assets in other games on the same platform.  There's not much in terms of default animation with the golfer either, not that he should scratch himself with the putter, but like other games, whn you're lining up a shot you move or adjust your positions from looking at the hole, crouching to line things up and then finally taking the shot.  The scenery as I said, the ambiance needs work.  Skies, clouds, birds, water, grass and shrubbery, all just sits with a simple state to move a bit.  Just small amounts of movement.  I'm not asking for somebody to throw a pie, but if it's going to be a pc game, put some graphical power behind it.  I maxed the graphics, but still, nohing cool besides maybe a lens flare, but lens flares aren't cool...so here we are.  

Gameplay, yeah there's multiplayer and you can set up games with friends, but that's standard these days.  No silly side games or practice shooting in a range.  Just dive in and it's pretty shallow.

I bought this for a twenty but that's a bit much, had I known what to expect I'd say it's maybe worth a fiver.  I wouldn't mind a refund but I won't lie, it's easy to play and it'll be great when I'm drunk trying to kill time.  My standards tendt to lower.  

I'd say save your money for a bigger studio release.

It's a golf game... for those that enjoy the type of video golf game that isn't necessarily all about of the arcade elements from golf games of yore. Instead, this game is clearly aimed at being more of a golf simulation.

The game, bolstered by the course creator community, offers over 400 courses, including accurate renditions of popular course destinations from all over the globe; as well as, plenty of fictional courses.

Also, the game is basically one of only a few somewhat recent developer attempts at bringing a commercial golf game to market. So, there aren't a heck of a lot of other choices; and, it's admirable that the relatively small team of developers stuck with it for as long as they did.

The game now offers 3D grass, and reflective water... although it will cost some frames.

The game features elevation effects; which allow the ball to carry further at higher elevation.

The game features online multiplayer modes like stroke, match, alternate shot, skins, etc. There is also a Resume feature, for players that get inadvertently kicked from an ongoing multiplayer match.

The game features multiple swing types, from 3-click, to gamepad, and mouse swings, as well.

THE BAD:
The User Interface, particularly when attempting to navigate through the menus and the settings, is very clunky and frustrating for new users. There exists no tutorial, despite the entire piece of software being anything but user-friendly. 

The sound is occasionally intermittent, with the impact of golf shots oftentimes being completely missed.
 
The graphics and vegetation colors are a bit outdated. Although, with the new 3D grass, the game looks light-years better.

The physics engine needs improvements. The equipment power progression is not linear, and often produces highly irregular physics results.

The golfer avatar looks unfinished. The setup positions are largely incorrect, down to the backwards hand positioning. Also, the swing animation has a terrible hitch in it.

There is very little user customization, outside of selecting 14 clubs. Each and every user is required to use the same exact character. The only variation being, some basic shirt color adjustments.

The course downloading system is somewhat disorganized, causing users to have to download each course from unaffiliated websites; and then, manually extract each file individually into the correct game directory. There are no auto-course-updates either, which causes users to have different versions of courses, preventing a given grouping from going off.

The lobby itself is setup rather haphazardly, with inaccurate or incomplete references to player locations on various courses, based on misidentified hole numbers. As well, listings of multiplayer games take approximately 30 seconds to refresh, causing all sorts of issues when multiple players try to simultaneously join a game. This can be fixed by password-locking your game, if you already have all of the predetermined participating players waiting in the wings.

THE UGLY:
There is no moderation whatsoever in the lobby. So, some users have been known to get quite vulgar, while trolling the lobby and flaming others, without consequence.

Where there is moderation, in the forums, the developers have repeatedly attempted to muzzle legitimate criticisms, by regularly deleting posts featuring bug reports and physics gaffes.  

There have been ongoing issues with Gimmes; freezing up the game entirely... when hitting a par 3 tee shot that lands inside Gimme range. The Concede Hole button oftentimes causes the wrong player or team to win the hole; and the round cannot be continued from this bug.

There have been ongoing issues with multiplayer connectivity failing, due to excessive lag, which can cause undue stuttering while spectating another player's shots.

The lack of blending the various lengths of rough causes unnatural bulges, and shots will occasionally interact as if the golf ball were coming in contact with a street curb, as opposed to thick grass.

Another huge issue is the lack of smooth undulating surfaces on greens. There are jagged creases and geometric shapes with straight lines protruding from the ground on many of the greens, oftentimes causing the golf ball to veer off of its intended path, unnaturally.

The cart paths hover above the ground. The developer has stated this is intended, as it is apparently a workaround to another issue. How is that okay?

Occasionally, the golf ball will actually penetrate underneath the surface of the turf, warp underground, and pop back up above the surface. This bug destroys all immersion.

There are no official competitions; and, unaffiliated private ladders - like PGLS - are run by highly competitive fellow players that oftentimes participate in their own tour events, while setting up draconian rules, which don't always apply evenly, nor even to themselves. It ends up being a kangaroo tour, dictated by mob rule, and blind favoritism to users that fall within what is essentially just a tight-knit-friend-group.

In the end, the only fair methods of competition would be rated lobby games, and an official tour... run solely by the impartial developers.

OVERALL: 
Overall, the developers have definitely tried to make improvements to a whole host of game-breaking bugs. But, the game never took off, commercially; and it's very likely that the lack of commercial success contributed to the inability of the developers to fully flesh out all of the fundamental issues with the game.

I've played the game as long as I have, off and on, because I enjoy turn based Alternate Shot; which the other major video golf developer has failed to adequately deliver on.

Also, from getting involved in the Early Access betas, this community was excited to see what could be produced without all of the bureaucracy of a large developer like EA Sports, which had just gotten out of the video golf game business. 

Ultimately, this game never fully reached its potential. But, since the community still keeps relevant courses, occasionally I'll fire it up and play along during the majors, or other big events where the top players in the world gather.

Still, there cannot be an automatic excuse to give the game a glowing review for which it's ultimately not deserving of. There remain far too many bugs, as well as, physics anomalies, and the glaring lack of any competitive purpose, whatsoever; which would compel any avid golf fan to give any largely unfinished platform a thumbs down.",1434679635,1586214422,False,152,17,0.831951260566711426,4,True,False,False,False,,,

It has the look and feel of the PGA Championship PC game that I used to play, but Perfect Golf has the advantage of a strong and growing on-line capability thanks to STEAM. I have just several minor complaints about the game. 

First, I wish that the wind was more of a factor in the game to make players think a little more about how to shape shots. Clever  players could then hit fades and draws on purpose to hold the ball against the wind, or use the wind more to move around dogleg corners depending on the situation.

Second, I don't believe that players are penalized enough when hitting into or out of the trees. I have seen many shots go right through the trees like they were thin air, when in real golf the tree limbs or leaves would have knocked the ball down. Fairway bunker shots also seem a little too easy compared to real golf.

Lastly, I suspect that some of the players out there that are using the Motion Plus method to swing the club are using a track or some other kind of aid to move their mouse perfectly each time. It's too much of a coincidence that they have the same shot shape everytime, especially when consistently hitting it with over 100% power. That creates an unfair advantage over those players who use the tri-click method. I recommend that you allow just the tri-click method for on-line play to guarantee that no player has an advantage over any other.",1433629764,1433629764,True,2,1,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Now that that is out of the way, im always keeping my eyes open for a good pc golf game as i am a avid golfer and a country club memeber so i take it fairly serious,(more about getting better outside of just having fun). The king of the course to this day still imop is the Links ls series. I was on the interwebs and caught drift of Perfect Golf, not sure if this was true but i had read a few of the older designers from the Links series helped out with either the production/direction or programing of this title. Right off the bat that sparked my intrest because i hold Links LS is such high regard. After getting to play this now for a bit heres my thoughts what i like and what can improve.

The graphics are pretty nice all things considering, i still need to really tweak the settings a bit yet. As for the performance its really hit and miss and i do hope down the road they OPTIMIZE this title a bit better.
Im expecting high framerates with my setup, (i7 4770k 4.4ghz, MSI GTX 980 4g, m100 ssd and 8 gigs of rip jaw x ddr3 1866). My fps fluctuate from 80 (caped) all the way down to 28 or 30. Even with everything maxed i feel this game should run at a steady 60fps no problems with my setup, so better Optimization would be a great addition.

I enjoy the ball flight and the way it behaves on the green;s (backspin/roll/ect) this is what i loved most about Links Ls and i would say Perfect golf gets this pretty close to what Links Ls had. No Tiger woods Bs where you can manipulate the ball spin in mid flight. The sound is good and animations are good minus the putting animation something bout short puts and how the golf holds the putter combined with the stroke seems a bit off to me.

Im sure this will be added down the road but Crowds for tournement play should be here also a variation of diviot animantions would be nice. Also i just thought of this but to coincide with the divots they should add an extra meter (pro difficulty) where you also have to gadge weather or not you have hit the ball clean/slight divot or hitting it fat, heavy divot, i would really like this added! 

Lastly this wil take some time but hopefully this game will get a strong and rich following and it will mature into what Links ls has in its Links Corner. With there course designer and obviously a ton of time, there are so many real course replicated in great detail that users are able to play. The catalog of courses is so extensive most of the time when the real world tourneys start up i would say 80 percent of the time there is that same course i can download and play will the pro's are actually playing them. Its deep golf nerd stuff but some what of a guilty pleasure i have and will play that course while my laptop plays the golf channel right next to my comptuer!

I would give this game Birde for right now. The drive is in the fairway with the approach shot was on the green but not to close followed by a 20 foot put that sink if your picking up what im throwing down. So far more hits then misses, can't wait for more updates from these developers keep up the good work and lets go for that eagle!",1429738410,1429738410,True,4,1,0.519122302532196045,0,True,False,True,False,,,

(old review) This is absulotely terrible! You can't make a game that looks sooo pretty but plays terribly. I have played every Links Golf Series, ive played PGA Tour on the Ipad, ive probably played every golf sim since the Atari 800 XL The control of the power bar is completely rediculous the swinginmg is way way way off. If you move your golfers position farther to the left and then take a swing and it misses the mark and goes just a little bit the ball curves to the left WAY WAY WAY left not equalling the strength and the way the ball should be going. The Physics are all wrong. The Mouse buttons to stop on the swingdown is not consistant and sometimes it does not respond ir it responds late and the swing goes way to the left or the right.  There are not any cheers or announcers.  Links 2003 a game that is 12 years old plays better than this game, it may not look as animated and as perty as this game but at least you can have fun playing the game. This being said this is still in BETA and Im really hoping this game improves cause wasting $20 doesnt make me a happy camper.

UPDATE**************** Ok im Liking it more the past 2 days. Ive figured out that i can change the settings to make it easier for starters. I was playing the Pro setting. Also the swing is easier than i thought HOWEVER its way too sensitive sending the ball right or left even if your barey left or right of the downswing marker. I have a pretty good PC with lots of memory and 3 core etc the graphics are very choppy when set to best, so I lowered it and it playes great and even though its not on the highest settings it looks 420X better than LINKS, Tiger Woods etc..

There are only a few concerns that i can bring up that they need to fix.
1. Sometimes you can get your ball to bounce out of a bunker and as far as I know, bunkers aren't trampolines.
2. Putting power and the power system. There is a a line that is what is the recommended strength for the the putt but it says you may have to adjust yourself based on the incline/decline of the putting green. This is false. If you go above the line on average putts it doesn't change the power at all. Same goes for if you go below the line. Chips and bunker shots have the same kind of wonky thing happening. 
3. Wind. Wind seems to have little to no effect on the ball's trajectory even at 17-19 mph.
4. Your persons legs disappear when standing on an incline.
5. The in game sound is insanely loud, even when  you put everything at 4% of the 100% possible. For me, 1% is about perfect.
6. Ball spin. If you position the shot to where you get underneath the ball when you swing, backspin should accompany the shot as well as the shot going shorter than normal because it should increase the arc on the ball. No such thing happens. The ball goes farther and when it lands no backspin happens. Instead when you don't position it at all and just swing normally your ball will get this weird ghost backspin that happens for no reason. Topsin has a similar effect where the ball doesn't change trajectory at all other than it flys shorter than normal. No ball spin happens when it lands as well.

If they can touch up a few of these mechanics they have in the game but have no effect on it then this game will literally be perfect golf. Except for like, real golf...",1427490413,1427490413,True,3,1,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True,False,,,

It's not a golf game, it's a shell of a golf game with no internals. There is no AI, no season/career options, no stats, no tournament play. You can play a round against yourself or an online opponent and that's it! Graphics are average but it does however still require serious PC juice to run. Menus are few because there are no real features that require menus. Visually the menus have a very simplistic layout and are certainly not intuitive to navigate. There are no great new features in Perfect Golf that other golf games don't have. The features it does have are nothing new and are extremely basic with many bugs/issues.

You would think the developers would do something great with one of the most important areas of any golf game, the swing meter! Well, no, it's as basic as you can get! 
I like to click. You have some very basic difficulty settings you can adjust for the game difficulty and that's the end of the swing meter feature list. There is no option to change the swing meter speed to something of your liking. There is no option to add markers to the meter. The meter links to the graphics engine so if you don't have a silky smooth running game, you also won't have a silky smooth meter making it impossible to play. These are simple meter options golf games over a decade old provided. Perfect Golf gives you the most simplistic of meters with virtually no options to tailor it. 
If you use the mouse method for swing, same deal, extremely basic with little to no control. There is not even a horizontal mouse swing option! There is no feedback on how well you did with your swing as in Tiger Woods games so you never know what area of your swing needs work.

Considering how little of a golf sim Perfect Golf provides, you would think the developers would nail what has been done before in golf games and improve upon those features. No such luck! Here we have first time developers and it shows in every bland detail of the game! 

One final example to leave you with. The game contains a follow the ball in flight option same as a ball-cam from the Tiger Woods games. In Tiger Woods the camera follows the ball through flight and as it hits the ground the camera smoothly follows behind the ball as it bounces and comes to a stop. In Perfect Golf, as the ball hits the ground, the camera bounces along with the ball! The entire screen jumps up and down. Talk about annoying! Talk about motion sickness! Talk about the feeling you are playing arcade golf! You find youself expecting the golf ball to explode or some dude to come out from behind a tree and start shooting at you every time your shot hits the deck!

The lack of controller support makes the game completely unplayable from your couch. This is a golf SIM, not a casual golf game. If you attempt to use your mouse with motion swing, your ball will fly left every time. The graphics are sub-par at best which is unfortunate. 

If you have played golf games before, this one is VERY easy to pick up and start playing. Very simplistic. I didnt want another Tiger Woods game. I was however, hoping that some of the positives that made those games so much fun would be incorporated in this. Who knows, its early access. I hope the DEVS have everyone in mind while making this game. Not just the die had golfer, but the casual gamer/EA fans as well. 

Controller support would go a long way in making this game more fun, lets get that done quick. Looking forward to seeing the completed game.

Things that seperates itself from other games:

-A real time physics engine combined with real ball flight data(launch angles, spin rates and ball speeds) taken from launch monitors put this game in a class of it's own. Once you experience the before mentioned there really is no going back to other golf games.

-The Motion Swing mouse mechanic is a first of it's kind that introduces D plane swing theory. What is D plane theory and how does it realate to the mouse? Well, the simplified answer is the tracking of the actual swing path plus the tracking of the clubface angle. Your swing path is determined by the direction you move the mouse and the clubface angle is determined by the tempo at which you move your mouse.

-A real time weather and lighting system allow you to input a geographic location and play in those weather and lighting conditions. Never before has a golf game recreated weather and lighting conditions like this game. The lighting and shadow effects are exceptional and really change the look and feel of a course. You can even play in a thunder and lightning storm. Even though you wouldn't do this in real life it's worth doing in PG just to see the lightning effects.

-The last thing worth mentioning, and maybe the most important is, this may be the first game to offer up realistic scores in competition. I see no way to shoot in the 50's on a consistent basis, especially with aids turned off. I see scores being very close to real life, maybe even higher. Since tempo plays such a high role in the swing, straight edging or trying to zero out the x axis on the mouse is not going to get your far. Also, since the game uses a real time physics engine to determine spin you can't put artificial spin on the ball and throw darts at every flag.

$20 for this game is a steal. Buying it now will save you $10 to $15 when it goes retail. Once the course forge is released with the retail version and courses start pouring in, there will be no reason to even talk about another golf game. The potential this game has is limitless.

I was a Tiger Woods player from the very first and enjoyed each version and I have a strong liking to the three click swing meter.

I think many who do not like this game are still committed to the unusually low scores attainable in the TW range. Even I had my 15/20 under par rounds at St. Andrews. 

The swing meter has sever punishment for a pulled or pushed shot, but this only encourages me to take more care on the third click.

I have only played the easier settings but the wind seems to have little effect on the flight of the ball.

At times the roll seems excessive especially on the fairway slopes.

The graphics and ambient surround sound have an exceptional quality.

I have experienced two bugs, one irrelevant and the other annoying.
(a) : At times the lower half of the players legs disappear in the bunker.
(b) : The program freezes after a final putt is made and there is noway to restart the program or PC except to reboot. When the PC is rebooted the game continues from where it froze. This has happened on about six games to date.

I am convinced that if this program continues and expands as it has begun it will be an extremely addictive game to play.

As regards the gameplay in particular, it is indeed excellent, although even at the easiest setting the shot meter is very unforgiving. A slight miss off the center line, left or right, yields an erring shot in no man's land. So you better hone your reflexes. That caveat notwithstanding, the game is great fun. Kudos to the developers at this stage of development.

Now, on the less positive side: the graphics are nice, but a bit disappointing, if we consider that they are roughly on par with the graphics in the game Links 2003. I must say, however, that I am here comparing the best and most recent offerings of this old game, with respect to available courses, and the likes of Shardowlands in Perfect Golf. Still I find that the vegetation, especially the foliage of leafy trees, could and should be better, more polished and photo realistic. I would likewise welcome some flowers in places to add a touch of color and variety to this green fest. Also, even with the antialiasing on, there are still some noticeable jagged edges. Keep in mind that I have the graphical settings at ultra high, with max resolution of 1440 P. In short, I believe there is still work to be done on the part of the developers when it comes to graphics.

Clearly, and quite predictably at this stage, there is also a lot of work to be done when It comes to available courses, clubs, and avatars. Furthermore, I would love to see an array of AI opponents of different skill levels for off-line games.

I suggest Perfect Parallel include a store in the game to give the option of considerably expanding the content at a reasonable cost. I personally have no issue with financially rewarding the developers (like the competent course designer Mike Jones) for this most promising game.

I'm running the game in windowed mode 1280x768 on a 5 year old laptop with AA on and Bloom on. Trees are set at 350, shadows 200, Grass 100 and camera view distance 1500. All things considered the game runs good apart from a few stutters here and there that I can live with and haven't yet affected the playability.

Ball Physics: the team has done a wonderful job on the ball physics, especially after the latest update. I considered the ball physics in Links v1.07 to be one of the best I've seen in a golf game but in PG they've taken it to another level of realism. Sure, there is still some work to be done but having played a few different golf games this is the best I've experienced as yet .......

BUT .... while I feel that tee to green the devs have created up to now the best simulation of real golf yet seen in a computer game, I do feel an element of realism is then lost with the putting model. To help explain this I should point out I am a novice real life golfer, having only played the game for around 18 months. So it is fresh in my mind what it is like to be a beginner and having to learn the game. I feel a simulation should have the same sort of difficulties and learning curve with all aids off as the real thing. That may also mean I'll never be able to shoot under par for a round as in real life. A par on a hole should feel like an achievement. Unfortunately the putting model destroys this sense of achievement because it feels like I have too much help. Sometimes I misjudge my long putts on a real course massively - and that never seems to happen to me in PG due to the putting meter. And sometimes in real life I've putted from the fairway just off the green and given too much power and ended up off the other side of the green. I can't seem to do that in PG as my power is limited by the meter.

My suggestion - a straight swing bar that follows the movement of the mouse. The putter head placed two thirds down the bar with movement then for back swing and power and length of follow through for movement. Putting aids can be markings on the bar to help judge distance but true simulation mode with no aids would be with no markings and just from feel as in real golf. Don't know if something like this is possible. It would mean that by selecting a putter the graphic would automatically switch from an arcing swing meter to a straight putting bar. In simulation mode full back swing (of course restricted to a point) and full, fast follow through would always result in a maximum power putt.

A free roam mode would be nice, even if it was only restricted to a 20 or 30 yard zone around the golfers position, to allow for better planning of shots like in real golf when views are restricted. Of course, these restricted views should also be set to golfers eye level for realism.

Look forward to future update improvements and hopefully more courses. Great job so far and the closest to a simulation of the game I've yet to play.",1424619951,1424620091,True,23,3,0.681334078311920166,1,True,False,True,False,,,

The early access of Perfect Golf is a fantastic start and the devs appear to have every motivation to bring the game to full fruition. Unlike many early access titles, the devs at Perfect Golf aren't promising heaven and earth just to get people's money but they are promising to create a great golf sim for real golfers, something I firmly believe they are very capable of delivering.

The current basic build is solid and enjoyable enough to hint at what is to come. Of course it has some bugs and it is missing many features and some areas require polish but these are all being identified and dealt with systematically and professionally as far as I can tell.

For anyone looking to buy this game in its current form, note that it does not yet have the following features which some may want to wait for:

- Computer opponents
- Career mode
- Golfer appearance customisation
- Statistics and Tracking

I would also say that, while the game looks very nice on my machine in ultra high detail at 1080p (you need a proper gaming graphics card here by the way), the golfer animation could be doing with being more fluid and the feeling more solid when the ball is struck or impacts the turf. It just feels a little floaty at this point with the golfer, terrain and ball all having a slightly disconnected feel. Additionally, the wind conditions seem to have no effect on the trees or flag; at 50mph the trees move identically to when the wind is at 10mph.

On the other hand, the in flight ball physics are awesome and the mouse control ""motionswing"" mechanic is brilliant and is easily the closest feel to a real golf swing that I've experienced in a PC golf game. This mechanism puts the onus on the tempo and rhythm of your swing rather than just how straight you can move the mouse back and through (anyone remember table edging?). Downswing too fast and the ball is going left, too slow and it's going right, similar to real golf. If you let the pressure get to you and you lose your tempo, you're in trouble, just like real golf.

Also, the real time weather and sky conditions make everything feel a lot more realistic and help with immersion.

At this point there are no computer opponents and no sort of career mode but these are planned. Additionally, there is no golfer or gear customisation beyond being able to select which 14 clubs you want in your bag.

If you are a new starter (or even if you're not), here are my top ten tips for bringing down your scoring and increasing your enjoyment of the game:

1) go to options and change the camera to track your shot because it's a static camera by default which is boring
2) bring up the map using the button on the top right of the screen to allow for easier aiming
3) right clicking in the power circle allows you to change club and select normal or chip shot type
4) right clicking again in the power circle allows you to alter the trajectory or add fade/draw bias
5) read the instructions and practice with motionswing. It may be tough to start with but it's worth it when it clicks!
6) The marker on the putting green has nothing to do with power, only direction. The centre point on the putting power bar is the power needed to reach the hole on a flat green. You need to go past this point if you want to putt uphill
7) activate the terrain slope graphics for normal shots as well as putts because the ball being above or below the feet will send the ball left or right respectively
8) wind seems to have smaller effects on the ball than in other golf games but once the speed goes above 20mph it starts to have more of an impact
9) go into your golfer settings and swap something out for a 64deg wedge. This is easily the most useful club in the bag behind the driver and the putter
10) if you want to chat in a multiplayer game, hit enter

As far as multiplayer goes, it is currently based on a peer to peer hosting system with the normal modes of play you would expect and a few unusual ones. Since there is no central server yet you need to ensure you have a fast and stable internet connection if you are going to host a game. Otherwise, ask someone with a better connection to be the host. My experiences have been mostly positive as both host and guest with no disconnections but perhaps I have been lucky with my opponents.

From memory I think there are 6 courses currently to choose from and new ones are being added regularly as part of the updates.

If you are a fan of golf and you are looking for a proper golf simulator you should buy this game now.

If you enjoy golf games in general but want a career mode, customisable equipment and computer opponents, check back in 6-12 months.

If you want to pretend you are a superhuman who can drive the ball 400 yards and impart spin with the power of your mind, go play Tiger Woods.",1424103501,1424103501,True,2,1,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Motion Swing using the mouse is the best swing method I've ever used becasue it is all about 'feel' and that is what real golf is about also. There are loads of options for people who want a less challenging experience too...but playing with no assists is best imo. 

The game will be packaged with CourseForge for creating user courses and having been fortunate to have a dabble I can say it is a wonderful piece of software, way more versatile than TGC's offering.

The new swing model of Perfect Golf is genuinely good - it'll take you a bit of practice to get it, but what I like is that you can hit quite alot of decent shots (neither truly awful or perfect) that makes the game feel more like the real thing. 

I've only been playing it for the past few days, and my gripe is about  some of the graphics performance - it's pretty stuttery even with a Radeon HD7770, latest drivers and 8GB ram.

Otherwise, the courses look beautiful.

I hope they keep up the good work on Perfect Golf - there's every chance it'll develop into the type of golf sim that's been simply non-existant for PC owners.

PP needs an ALT shot game. When you want to set up stroke game I suggest to lower the number of players from 8 to 4.
Connection issues are slim to none. Haven't got kicked out or timed out yet woot woot!!. I'll post more as I play more. 
So strokem good guys and have fun

Little things like the player model clipping through severe slopes and clubs not being obviously accessible can be overlooked at this stage because the core of the game works well enough. There were very minor visual things that actually bothered me. The courses look wonderful, and the ball physics are pretty close to spot on which swayed me to buy it.

It gives indie game developers a chance to release games that enthusiasts will help test and report bugs + have the opportunity to request new features. This obviously tells me that the game is far from complete and the only way it's going to get better [no matter what state it's in] depends on the participation/involvement of the user base.

After having played Perfect Golf for a few hours it was clear to me that the skills of course design, that Mike, Andrew and the rest of the PP team have shown - time and again - in the courses they have released for Links 386, have been solidly brought forward to PG. The courses aren't just beautiful and difficult but the attention to detail is amazing. The live water, real-time weather, blend of grass etc. looks stunning and it makes the game very enjoyable. Although we currently only have 5 courses available, I'm enjoying every single minute of playing this game and helping to report back any issues I have found.

The areas of improvement that I see as most significant are 1) make online-play smooth for everybody 2) improve the clunky interface where we join and set-up games, etc. 3) make the ball physics a bit more realistic/tough when rolling around in the rough.

Features that I'm hoping will be added are 1) the ability to be able to create private games 2) the ability to see who is hosting/taking part in a game (Steam name) 3) the addition of a Break Line Indicator (similar to the one in Links).

This game is only going to get better and better and be a huge success. I'm actually building a brand spanking new PC, so I can enjoy the stunning graphics to its fullest:-)

The graphics on Ultra High settings, look great. Of course, I only expect them to get better as development continues, and as the community gets ahold of the CourseForge to create custom courses.

As would be expected, the Early Access version of this game has some issues with the swing meters. However, I still feel that this game has a good foundation to build on with the current meters. Looking forward to the later builds to see what each swing meter feels like.

Also, the simple, in-game match making and chat is decent for an Early Access title. 

Cons:
There still seems to be a lot room for growth in this title. Most of the things I would say need to be fixed have already been touched on by other reviewers. However, I would have to differ in my opinion of the severity of the negative comments. I think that the main areas that will help improve the quality of this release are more player customization options, refined motion swing meter / character interaction, and more courses(...CourseForge).

Overall, I am happy with the quality for such an early version of what has the potential to be an amazing golf game. Like I said, I am truly excited about the release of CourseForge, as I believe it will add a great deal of value to this release. I think that some people expect more from Early Access titles, and may be a little harsh on the developers.

The game, at this point, will not dazzle you with its graphics (I'm playing all graphics options maxed out, btw), but what it lacks in glitz, it makes up for with the truest golf mechanics and 'feel' that I've yet come across in a golf video game.    

I originally started out with the 3-click meter, because that's what I would normally default to after toying around with other games' motion swings (be it the Wiimote, PS controller or mouse).  However, after deciding to give this game's motion swing a try, I'm hooked.    Finally, a game that nails it.  The motion swing is fantastic.   It feels natural and organic, whether on the full swing, chipping or putting.    It's also deep, and difficult (playing with the assists at 'minimal') but with practice, you see improvement as you start to gain feel and muscle memory, just like in real golf.   The game also provides you with numerical feedback (on the driving range practice mode) to illustrate the errors and there is a guide on Steam that explains the numbers.  In short, there are 3 components - tempo, swing path and face contact, all determined by the speed and directions you move your mouse.

das Spiel erinnert optisch von Anfang an sehr stark an die Links LS Serie. Man könnte fast von einem ""Klon"" sprechen; Fans der Serie können also direkt und ohne Probleme loslegen. Leider betrifft dies aber auch die Grafik, die nicht auf dem heutigen Stand der Technik ist. Eine golftypische Musik läuft im Hintergrund ab (abstellbar); Vogelgezwitscher (auch abstellbar) begleitet meinen Weg. Ansonsten ist der Sound eher dürftig. Hier vermisse ich die kurzen Kommentare der Caddies (""bite!"" oder ""crushed that one"") ebenso wie die Möglichkeit den Sound mit eigenen Dateien zu editieren. Auch das Geräusch beim Schlagen des Balles könnte satter und unterschiedlicher sein.

Nach dem Start finde ich mich im Chatraum wieder wo ich mich mit einem oder mehreren Spielern zu einer Runde Golf (Stroke, Match oder Skins) verabreden kann. Der Ablauf erinnert stark an die damalige MSN-Gaming-Zone oder Gamespy. Ich erstelle also meinen Charakter, bestimme die Auswahl der Schläger und stelle den Schwierigkeitsgrad ein. Hier gibt es zwei unterschiedliche Hilfsmöglichkeiten die ich frei einstellen kann: zum einen eine Spot-Verbreiterung auf dem sogenannten ""Swing-Meter"" (der Abschlagspunkt ist einfacher zu treffen) sowie eine Art Flughilfe (trifft man den Punkt nicht schmiert der Ball nicht zu stark nach links oder rechts ab). Nett: das Wetter lässt sich frei einstellen oder aber auch über eine ""Echtzeit-Wetter"" Funktion bestimmen.

Findet man sich dann alleine oder mit anderen auf einem (von fünf) virtuellen Golfplätzen wieder läuft eigentlich alles ab wie bei anderen Spielen dieser Art. Ein Schläger lässt sich sehr einfach auswählen (der Vorschlag des Caddies ist mit Vorsicht zu genießen). Flop, Fade etc. einstellen und ab dafür. Das Golf-Feeling kommt gut rüber; ein kleiner Chat erleichtert die Kommunikation (geht natürlich auch für die Tipp-Faulen über Skype oder TS3).

Irgendwann erreiche ich das Grün - und hier kommt es nun zu meinem Hauptkritikpunkt: der Swing-Meter zeigt nun ein kleines Fähnchen an das die Geschwindigkeit des Balles auf ebener Fläche zum Loch vorgibt. Es spielt also keine Rolle, ob man 2 Meter oder 20 Meter vom Loch entfernt ist. Einzige Schwierigkeit hierbei ist das Gefälle bzw. die Steigung einzuschätzen und den Grid, also das Gitter zur Bestimmung der Breaks auf dem Grün, richtig zu deuten, was Aufgrund der viel zu großen Breite der Gitterkästchen zu einem Glücksspiel mutiert. Nein, beim Putten kommt bei mir keine Freude auf.

Weitere Kritikpunkte sind das fehlen von Spielmodi wie ""Best Ball"" oder ""Scramble"". Es gibt nur einen (männlichen) Golfcharakter, keine Turniere, keinen Karriere-Modus und auch kein Ranking System. Die Ballphysik lässt hier und da zu Wünschen übrig und auch der Einfluss des Windes ist nicht wirklich immer erkennbar.

Trotz alledem empfehle ich dieses Produkt zum Kauf. Nach langer Zeit gibt es endlich wieder ein Golfspiel für den PC das in die riesigen Fußstapfen der Links LS Serie treten kann. Und da wir uns im ""Early Access"" Bereich befinden müsste vor all' meinen Kritikpunkten eigentlich ein dickes ""noch"" stehen, denn sie können alle noch ausgebessert werden. Ich hoffe einfach darauf, dass mich hier endlich wieder ein tolles Golfspiel erwartet. Der Ansatz ist zumindest mal vorhanden, und der sieht wirklich nicht schlecht aus!",1422531418,1422531418,True,3,1,0.505300343036651611,0,True,False,True,False,,,

 This early access offering from PP has funtionality,and the 

gameplay has been stable on my mid range Aurora R4. I have 

been impressed with the physics and ease of use. The options 

in this early release are also noteworthy and pretty much 

intuative.
 I have followed the devolpment of this game and was 

apprehensive as I loaded it up for the first time. I was 

pleasantly surprised as I played it more. Even at this stage, 

the options to set it to ones liking are plentiful and much 

more than the basic, bare bones state that other early access 

titles offer.
 Once you have started to become familiar with how your ball 

reacts to your input, the possibilities to try new shots or 

varying techniques is already engaging. I like a game that 

challenges me, and I feel PP has created something that can 

and will be honed and refined to what its customer base will 

suggest/request for future updates.
 The multiplayer functions well at this stage, with Steam 

friends/voice chat integration.   
 This early access includes only the base game but the Course 

Forge course designer will be included with the retail 

release. (There are many aspiring designers waiting to get 

their hands on that). 
 The PP website has tons more information regarding 

everything that is Perfect Parallel. The developers are very 

active in the forums and have shown they embrace community 

suggestions.
 I am a satisfied customer and see alot of potential with 

this sim-I am having a blast thusfar ""feeling"" this game, and 

look forward to its refinement. A definite ""buy this"" from 

me.

 To potential buyers, be warned that the developrs have askd for poeple to post reviews. So the flood of recent reviews stem from that request.

Even with the latest updates this game still has a long way too go. The RTS mouse swing isn't as good as PGA2k, TW series or CPG/WGC. It just has no feel, you have no idea what went wrong when the swing motion that just worked fine now sends your shot shanked off into the woods or a hazard. Ball physics are still unrealistic. This game is more frustrating to play than real golf a lot of the time. 
 I would love to say yeah buy it. But if you do just know there is still a ways to go yet.

Recommend this game? yes with a caveat. It is FAR from ""Perfect"" Golf. ball physics are terrible, putting is unrealistic, motion swing isn't real-time or tied to the golfer, wind has no effect, multiplayer has issues. Graphics are good (not as good as The Golf Club, better than World Golf Challenge 2011, the other 2 golf games I play).

The other caveat is to play this (and most new games) you'll need CPU and video card horsepower to run  it at high graphic settings. 

Basically this is Links 2003 updated to a 2009-ish game. If you like Links 2003 you'll really like PG. For those of us who like a golf game with a real-time mouse swing buy this early access release and see if the improvements over time make it better. $20 isn't a deal breaker. Right now I've stopped playing it and will try it again in a month or so to see if any improvements have been made.

UPDATE 8-13-16

many patches later this game still has issues. Latest patch introduces some ""anti-cheat"" into the software. So if you make a number of good swings the game says ""must be cheating, using some outside swing aid on the mouse"" and then will cause a mis-hit resulting in an errant shot. So you get penalized for honing a swing?!?
Ball physics still not realistic. Lob Wedge  shot lands, kicks forward?? no back spin? Yet out of the rough or sand ball checks up and spins back.
They really need to bring back the original programmers who initially did the game so the code that keeps getting broken with every patch can be fixed. but given so many have now worked on the code, it's probably really messed up for good and needs a complete rewrite.

So still can't recommend this game, just be aware of all the faults if you do decide to buy",1422374511,1471111133,False,11,0,0.55061495304107666,0,True,False,True,False,,,

After I gave up Links, which I still play once in a while, I was looking for something new, with a multiplayer function. I started playing Shot Online, TW08 and TWO, but non of these games really made me happy. When I heard about PG I was really excited. I followe their Forums since they have been active and now, after years of waiting, here it is. I was asked to join the closed alpha to test the game and helping to make this game the best game out there. I know we have a long way to go to make it the best Sim out there, but my experiences with the Dev Team and the way they do their fantastic Job, let's me be very optimistic, that we will soon have the best Golf Sim ever.

There are still bugs and glitches, but we are in Early Access, so noone should think he gets a finished product. But the game is playable and the numerous Options make it the game everyone wants to play. It now has 3-click and mouse swing (Motion swing) and more ways to play will arrive, like controller support. There are currently 5 courses but this will expand after final release as the CourseForge will be part of the Final. With course forge you will be able to create your own courses.

After all I think Perfect Golf is on the right way. There is alot of work to do, but the Dev Team works hard and I'm sure these guys are able to make this game the number 1 on the Online Golf market and maybe the best Golf Sim ever. As the game will always evolve there are almost no real limits in the future to add things.

Can't wait to see the ""final"" Product, but as stated, it will never be final.

Edit: 

Almost a year later this game really is awesome. New swing methods have been added, Controller support is added.

Are there still bugs or other issues? Hell yes!! But the developers are working hard and usually they fix those issues fast. Sure there are problems which take a lill longer to fix, but I'm very positive that most of them can and will be fixed soon.

What do you get for your money? You get a great Golf simulation. The game is fully playable, has alot of courses now that the Course Forge testers published some of their great works, you can play multiplayers with your friends and/or family. Some things still aren't included like a career mode and this is one of the things which will take longer to be implemented (After final release I guess) but the gaming experience is simply awesome.

Is the game finished yet? NO! And actually it never will be finished. The developers will always work on it and improve things. The game is still in Early Access, which meens it is not finished. There will be a final version soon, but even that will not be completely finished. So if you buy the game, all you need to do is enjoy playing it and sit back and wait for new features or graphics etc.

Update #2

6 Years later I wouldn't buy this game again in it's actual state. The Devs gave up the game some years ago, no new updates and the player base really gets smaller and smaller. The 3 click swings got worse and worse. No idea if this is a game problem, server problem or what ever, but missing the snap by 1/1000 mm ends up in a giant snap miss. When friends of mine miss the snap by a hair nothing really bad happens. My FIR got down from 84% Average to 23% Average. This is definatly not a problem of my swing as I don't miss the snap more than before. Maybe something activated the cheat-protection and never disabled it but I'm very unhappy with the game now.

Some think they should have done more but here is the reality of this game. If you like a golf game that provides you the ability to create a course this is a great game for that;however, it is complicated to do so; however, it is doable and in addition because of its complexity you can do a whole lot with the course maker thing. Because of the PGLS website (google PGLS Golf) you have a great way to play multiplayer with tournaments a forum and people who beta test the course you make this website has basically saved this game. After awhile the developers focused on other things. If you like a realistic golf feel this is the only game that provides that. When you compare this game to other golf games that you think are great this game easily surpasses those with realism in addition you have many ways to play it meaning there is controller support and click or 3 click and motion swing and real time swing. I think putting in real time swing is horrible not sure how they could fix it and keep it realistic though. If you want different avatars and clothing opitions you are limited your golfer is a white male and the clothes are limited. If you like a whole bunch of different courses you have got it make. So for realism and course desighn this is the best thing out there and it is an embarrassment to the planet that it took past 2016 for this to happen and still all the other course designers are stupid and the mechanics too. The gaming golf community for the pc is so pathetic that many still play Tiger Woods 08 and Links 2003 then there is this the stuff in between is those is pathetic but thats my biased opinion. Fortunately these guys came out with this unfortunately life happens and they did not do a Career mode which was talked about they did not have different avatars ( so its a white guy and its male in this politically correct world this game will probably get banned because of this ) you can though make an AI golfer and play against it and tweak extensively its abilities. It will be a white guy who looks like you that wears different clothes unless you give them the same clothes.

Works well on my 18 month old MAC. A little ""choppy"" at times but still adjusting graphics settings to find the sweet spot.
I'm a keen golfer playing off 12 and much prefer the sim style of game, i.e. rounds of 65s - 80s and NOT the 50s you'd often see at the top of leaderboards on Links. Hopefully a blend of EA Tiger Woods (ease of play and visuals) and Links (gameplay and options) can be found.

It's best to begin offline anyway and play the game as it was made to be, a golf simulation. I wouldn't play a real golf course without learning how to hit a ball..!
 
The graphics on my 4yr old system run fine. I'd love to improve them, but to ensure the game runs with a good frame rate, I opted to keep the graphics down. However, the view is good, I have no tears or glitches and the screenshots I've taken look great. I can play the game at fullscreen in 1920 x 1080, so everything is as I expect.
 
Gameplay is almost spot on. It puts you in total control when playing using the 3 click system. The other control method is still being developed, so I'd expect that area to improve alot over the coming months. I won't comment any more on that, as I've not really tested it. This isn't like older or other golf games, it feels more Sim than Arcade. Granted it has a few elements that are needed to transfer anything simulated to a computer game, but they are minimal and necessary.
 
Real Time Weather is pretty cool, and works a treat. The Time of Day setting is one of my favourite things, being able to visually see the sun rising or setting, and playing a twilight game has the good old feel of those summer evenings, with time on your side. 
 
Currently the 5 courses are just about right. With the promise of many more to come, it will soon become a tough decision choosing what course to entangle yourself within. Plus of course the Course Forge (Designer) a little further down the road. 
 
I'd certainly like to see alot more improvements, walking the hole, first person perspective to name a basic few.

Comme beaucoup de joueurs aiment jouer ensemble et souvent l'un après l'autre, je suggère d'ajouter un ""Timer"" un chronomètre avec possibilité de placer le temps voulu pour jouer un coup et que si le coup n'est pas réalisé dans ces temps, il y a pénalité d'un coup. Il manque encore une meilleure évaluation du terrain sur lequel la balle arrive (""heavy rough, light rough ...) et un pourcentage équivalent au risques encourus. Je recommanderais aussi (si c'est possible) une vue à partir des yeux du golfeur quand il ""swing"" comme possible position ainsi que certains outils pour analyser davantage le vert et faire un ""chipping"". Il semble que le jeu ne soit pas 3D mais ce n'est pas grave s'il est bien construit. Au début je n'aimais pas l'outil pour le swing, mais en l'étudiant davantage au Driving Range et sachant que si je vais vite la balle va à gauche et lent à droite en plus du tempo et du sweet spot, j'ai joué ensuite sans les aides et j'ai pû performer raisonnablement; indiquant qu'avec la pratique (comme au vrai golf) on peut s'améliorer. Je n'ai pas encore joué multiplayer, mais il va sans dire que la communication facile et la possibilité de sauver une partie en train de se jouer serait un avantage. Plusieurs d'entre nous seraient prêt à payer davantage soit sur le moment d'acheter le golf ou même après pour avoir certaines options (comme des bâtons et de l'équipement différent pour faire comme nous le faisons avec du vrai équipement). Une option comme pouvoir jouer avec une ""board"" du style P3ProSwing ou Optishot rendrait le jeu encore plus intéressant (de pouvoir jouer dans un garage avec des amis et leurs bâtons comme avec TW 2008).

And I wasn't even expecting a lot to begin with. When it works, the overall gameplay may be decribed as passable or rudimentary at best. When it doesn't, you will be struggling with all manner of bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies. From frequent crashes, to graphical glitches, to loss of chat features/interface. Admittedly, I am running the game on a near minimum requirements spec PC, so others may have a technically superiour experience, but I am, for example, literally unable to play two rounds in a row as the game crashes to desktop every single time I try to load a second round.

Motion swing controls are either broken or the developers simply don't understand what the whole point of being able to play by using your mouse as a club is. (It is to give the player the feel of actually swinging a club, in real time, and therefore requires 1:1 motion controls and respective visual representation. Another game achieved this perfectly, in 2001.)

Underwhelming at best. Every chance it will improve down the road, but impossible to recommend at this stage, particularly to those with lower specced PCs.",1421985848,1421985848,False,21,3,0.386466771364212036,3,True,False,True,False,,,

Graphics are just OK with current settings looks like something out of the 90s.
No support for a controller yet only three click swings or an awkward mouse meter.
The golf club seems to have better graphics and a lot more features and controller support but also has it's problems.
Lack of commentary on the golf course, some maybe OK with this, but the sound over all is pretty meh
It is early access, and I think the game has a mediocre foundation, but there is a lot of improvement needed at this point.
In my honest opinion if you're looking for a golf game on PC I would go with The Golf Club option, but beware it has it's quarks too.",1421978811,1421978811,False,17,3,0.36467587947845459,4,True,False,True,False,,,

Even a casual player such as myself can enjoy this one. I was terrible when I first started but after even the first 5 holes I was able to improve because the controls are very familiar and not overly complicated.
