For me the aesthetics fell pretty close to the uncanny valley. My brain tries to see things as real objects, but then they aren't which confuses me slightly. Additionally, the low animation frames and unnatural physics when dropping, makes it feel even more strongly off putting. But that's just my personal taste, others might not even see this.

The levels are quite fun to complete, but it can be quite tricky to keep up with four different moving lanes and often it's rather hard to actually hear the rhythm.

inSynch is a""rhythm game"" about pushing some buttons at the same time some shapes go above them, if you do it too son they will not get pushed farther, if you do it too late they won't be pushed properly, you need to push them in the right moment.

The game is nice, it's entertaining and will not last too much, I have currently played 51 minutes according to steam and I already completed all the levels (in a way), the game just feels really easy in that sense, it has two modes, one is a score-based mode where you just push the shapes into the hole and at some point they will come back and you will use them to get points, the other one is a ""how long can you survive without making mistakes""-mode, this feels more like an arcade type of game, just do it as long as you can last, but you have no particular objective (other than the 60 seconds you need to last to get the achievement, which I believe can be called the ""completion"").

I'm a big fan of steam achievements, I try to complete the games I like to 100% achievements and it kinda bothers me when games just give away achievements for really simple things like tutorials, killing the first enemy, pressing right click and so, and well, the achievements are really simple in this game, I have 71% of them (10/14) in this hour of gameplay, and I was able to get ALL of the score based games on the first try without even trying, the survival-based mode is more complicated, but you still can do it in a couple tries.

Considering the game doesn't have an ""end"" as it your only objective for the replayability of this game is either getting the highest score or surviving the longest time, but considering you don't get anything out of it (since there are only 4 levels on each mode) the game feels like something you would play, complete a bit and then drop it because it's no longer interesting.

Now, this is supposed to be a rhythm game, but other than the existence of music it doesn't feel like on, every time you press a button to push a shape is not really related to the current rhythm of the music, and you won't get any feedback from it (unless my headphones have gone crazy), the only way you get a sound when pushing one of the buttons is when you don't push a shape, which doesn't make sense to me.

The game is nice, it has some potential, but is really short, doesn't give you any particular challenges and doesn't have a big amount of levels like that, I would not recomment it, if a game is too easy it doesn't really feel like a good game.",1461647078,1461647078,False,14,0,0.71219104528427124,1,False,False,False,False,,,

InSynch, you deserve better.

What can I say to convince you to support this completely ignored gem? That it's a handcrafted rythm based masterpiece that is a shockingly good time by yourself or with a friend? It's hard to put into words the endearment I feel for this game, and the borderline disgust I have that this is being overlooked in favor of Temper Tantrum. This entire game has ""Indie Success Story"" written all over it, one that the likes of Kotaku and Polygon would be drooling at the chance to cover, and yet...nothing. 

I usually dive into the mishmash of the game and give my thoughts but really, borkabrak had it covered. This is a work of art, a borderline masterpiece. Here it is people, a great, unique indie game that could bring couples together and cause devotion from a number of aspiring artists, and yet here it sits, virtually untouched for half a year. 

So rarely do I find a game so filled with utter passion for its art, and so gleeful and fascinating to play for small bites of time. I went over to see how well their android version of the game is: surely it might've caught on in the mobile market, right? Nah. Estimated 10-50 installs. I'm heartbroken. I don't know where it all fell apart. Lack of marketing maybe? InSynch as close to being a fluke of nature, because all I can decypher is that this is just bad, bad luck. If I could find a way to get the word out on this gem, I think I will. This stopped being a review a while ago, so thanks for bearing with me, but I haven't been this impassioned about a game in a while. Them Games, you're an amazing developer.

That's the impression inSynch provides in every way.  I used to disdain rhythm games.  That was before I realized they were art, or should aspire to be.  This game achieves that completely.

The stop-motion animation gives much more ""motion"" than ""stop"".  It's a funny feeling seeing a photograph move.  The pixellation, blockiness and glitchy artifacts of digital graphics that I have trained my brain not to even *notice* in most other games, because they're so ubiquitous?  They're completely absent here.  It's the visual equivalent of listening to electronic music when someone begins playing a woodwind behind your head.

Speaking of music, the music in this game has a very similar effect to the visual fluidity and verisimilitude that went into the visual animations.  There are electronic noises and the sounds of sticks being hit together, and I think that was two glasses of wine tinking together in a toast.  And somehow, no matter how your gameplay affects the music (and it does), the overall composition remains interesting and very cool.

There's a mode where you play just for fun, without penalty for misses, and without really too much emphasis on score -- in fact, it's the only mode available when you begin.  And the effect is just that -- fun.  Hell, the pieces you're interacting with dance for you in ways that can only be described as playful to the point of ecstatic.

InSynch was first released in an art gallery, and it shows.  It's a beautiful, playful, and engaging piece of interactive art.  Well worth the purchase price, if only to support people who might put more things like this into our world.",1443888822,1443889829,True,9,2,0.589245259761810303,0,True,False,False,False,,,
