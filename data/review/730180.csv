This seems to have been made a VR exclusive to prevent any comparison with non-VR 3D games, a comparison that this game would fail very badly at.  Developers must learn that while VR is great, if the only thing that makes your game great is the VR, then your game isn't great at all.

The long version: You get what you pay for.
A super simple game. It seems repetitive and slow paced. I can't say I know what the later levels are like because It's too boring for me to keep playing. The grenade launchers are almost useless IMO. and There's no real progress in the game. With the automatic guns it makes all other options pointless.

it is a very simple basic shooting game.

I buy this because i am trying the function to use my new quest 2 to play steam vr game and i can make it work.
i make it work in a low end computer also. and i can play it and get my things done.

i am not very like the gameplay setting. if there is a little bit change of the game play setting, i believe the game can be much more playable and last for longer.

of course, the below is only my pov.
For any shooting game that excite me is a how i can aim the shoot the target accurately.
i will feel excite if i can aim the target accurately in one shoot.
so, there are at least 2points that prevent me from playing this.

1) there is a ""aimming line"" that pointing to the shooting direction.
I didn't find a way to disable this ""line"".
I understand that may wanted and neccessary for some players.
Why not just create a setting that i can just choose to disable this point line?

2) it look like there is a weak point of each target, that is the red block.
once you hit the red block, it die.
this is somewhat a good idea. But i can imgaine that, it may be a bit quite difficult to hit the target if my above point 1, the pointing line is disabled.
So, if the point 1 is workable, there should be another setting that we can set the number of the red blocks on the targets.
Like we can kill it if I can shoot any of the blocks on the target.
I like the feeling of one shoot killing and I think many of the people would like so.


This game is playable to me if there are 2above setting and I can just like keep to aim and shoot the targets.

It's basically shoot the tiny red dot visible from the outside or hidden inside the different moving objects.  If the objects hit the wall either up or down or on either side, you lose health.  There's no dodging or strategy other than quick, accurate shooting and maybe some target prioritizing at times.  There's a scoring sytem with multipliers that I found doesn't quite work well because you will miss a lot.

My main complaint is that the waves start very slow and you have this worthless gun at the start that you have to continuously press trigger to shoot in both your left and right hand motion controllers.  Luckily, unlocks are quick and soon you have some interesting weapon mods to choose from, including a machine gun that lets you just hold down that trigger button.  I definitely enjoyed the grenade type gun mod.  Makes things more interesting.  The shotgun mod is also nice.

I only found one mini-boss that is kind of annoying.  You have to shoot that thing forever.  But there was at least a nice variety of weapons.  Nothing like an enemy that whizzes by very fast and you have to hit a tiny red dot to give you a nice challenge.  

I played this for 30 minutes and already got my .99 cents worth of entertainment.  This game is not for everybody.  The visuals are very basic.  The background is very boring.  Games starts out very slow.  But I think there's enough of an interesting gun play.  I just wish there was more strategy than shoot a tiny red dot quickly.  I hope the dev at least adds the enemies sometimes coming towards you to make it more interesting.  Right now they just go side to side or up and down.
