My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The art that isn't part of attack animations is pretty nice, which is a shame given how much it is let down by the rest.

And the dev apparently abandoned this game in favor of making some garbage incel visual novel where he cries about being a virgin, in stark contrast to the nofap ""asexual"" protagonist of this game (who seemingly just used MPD-like disassociation to stop having sexual frustration).

I think the production of this game was a crossroads where the dev picked the wrong path and now calls ""thousands of hours of Youtube videos"" sociological research.

This game has a really interesting concept, you are Cleril, a poet on a journey to reclaim your mind from your subconscious.  The problem is the second mission of the game has you heading to a neural center point, to put yourself into a coma.  My problem with this is that soon after the coma begins there is a boss fight called The Monster.  This fight I do not understand its purpose.  It is quite easy to beat all the other parts of it, then the head just heals constantly.  The head heals for around 8-10k damage a round while you can only do around 100.

TLDR: Basic setup is interesting. You are some kind of dustmen scribe from Planescape going through some pocket dimension with shades, having to suffer weird dialogue as if in a dream sequence, having to scribe your way through and use weird dustmen necro style abilities. However the game itself is trash.

Outstanding Issues:
-Game looks like a pixelated mess if you press Alt+Enter to fullscreen and has no options menu
-No controller Support (sigh)
-Custom assets are a nice touch but they are low quality and there is WAY too few of them which in turns hurts a lot of other aspects
-Immersivity is not very good as you are dumped without context in an unfamiliar environment with no plot hook
-Level design is often bare with mostly empty space or just repeated patterns of corridors and room as if someone used a copy paste
-Progression is scripted in a way that you are forced to find the correct sequence, sometimes limits the ability to keep progression at a good pace and stonewalls you with mundane boring tasks",1503469173,1509911940,False,0,0,0.496656715869903564,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Game progress is linear and the game takes 4 hours to complete. Battles are varied and interesting, and strategy is useful. Visuals are artsy and weird, but professionally done.

You have a choice of three characters to bring with you as party members for each quest, and you may switch between them, as needed. These characters represent different aspects of your personality, and are entertaining in theory, but lack  emotional depth - their primary function is to participate in constant intellectual banter.

Each quest consists of a map in which you must make your way to the final boss, while fighting random encounters along the way. There is variety in each level and there are unexpected obstacles to your path that might take a while to solve, but nothing that will really discourage you.

There are waypoints to save your progress, so you can leave the map and not have to start at the beginning. You are allowed at any time to travel back to Haven (your home base), which replenishes all stats.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnG47k4UIdg

Released on Steam on August 5th 2016 we have Haven. Developed and Published by Cleril Calamity Studios, Haven is an RPG developed using Enterbrain’s RPG Maker. This isn’t the first RPG Maker game I’ve reviewed, and you can catch the other one here. For transparency, the developer sent me a key to the game for me to review.

In Haven, you play as the poet Cleril, within his mind. Over the course of the game, Cleril is joined by three other denizens of his head and together they fight against his subconscious for control. The game has a very psychological aspect to it and adapts a fairly interesting battle system. But is it any good? Let’s find out in…

[THE GOOD]

The hand drawn artstyle is a good touch. One thing I’ve never been too keen on with RPG Maker games is the reliance on the stock assets or sprite edits of existing assets and Haven’s implementation of having custom assets goes to show the effort made. While a section of the game does have a snippet of the stock assets and the menus absolutely reeking of them, it’s used in a much more creative way, considering the setting is Cleril’s mind. Interaction with objects has been done pretty well, It’s a little impressive that for every stump in the game, there’s different text when you interact with them, then again, I’m pretty weird and you’d have to be in order to interact with every stump in the game.

The game’s battle sequence I thought was a little unique. Cleril and his allies each have a Sanity and Ink meter. Sanity acts like HP while Ink acts like MP. Alongside a standard attack, Cleril and his Allies also possess skills which can use Ink or Sanity, as well as support skills which can be used to replenish them. Each character has unique abilites which you can use to strategize for the battles ahead and new skills can be learned in the Dictionary upon receiving Ink Wells throughout the game. As Cleril’s allies level up, they can also learn skills of their own as well as having a unique skill or ability that Cleril can spend Ink Wells on. Allies each have unique personalities and certainly add to the good aspects of the game. However, with all things good, there’s always…

[THE BAD]

The biggest complaint I really have here is the game is too vague in parts, especially in the story department. Without spoiling too much, we quickly learn that we’re in Cleril’s mind and that Cleril is insane, but why? Why is he insane? How did this all happen? Is there anything else going on in the world around him? The game leaves a lot of unanswered questions which still left me scratching my head once I had completed it. Granted, I did come across a sidequest that hadn’t been implemented into the game yet so I suspect there’s much more to it, but the game isn’t listed as an Early Access title giving me the impression that the game I should be playing is a complete game.

I feel the game was a little misleading with the ‘no handholding’ element. I found the game essentially guided me to just about everything, even telling me that I should save before a certain battle, how to escape battle (though admittedly I never had to), and that to heal, I could return to the main hub, or Haven while I was out of battle though it didn’t always work.

The game also features a couple of frustrating areas which requires a lot of trial and error to bypass. One particular area I found required a lot of reloading due to what’s happening. Encounter rates seem to skyrocket in certain areas with one pretty much setting me up for an encounter each step towards a chest with an Ink Well in it. The game’s lack of items while explainable since we’re inside someone’s mind does force players to play more strategically and use skills to regenerate Sanity and Ink. Asides from that, there isn’t much else to talk about here so we’ll now move on to…

[THE OPINION]

I can’t say I’m a huge fan of RPG Maker games, but don’t get me wrong, there has been some good come out of it (I’m looking at you Corpse Party). I was able to beat the game in a couple of hours with the only real hurdle being the frustrating areas I mentioned earlier. Story was interesting enough and enjoyable, but still quite vague. I do like the setting and the idea of the game taking place inside the mind, as well as your efforts to try and control yourself but I feel execution could have been handled a little better. The game certainly has potential and I think Cleril Calamity Studios has done good on it, but hey, keep at it, I think you can certainly improve.",1482088783,1482088783,True,5,0,0.562236487865447998,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Cleril’s game tells the story of a mad poet named Cleril (which seems to be a more common name then any of us ever imagined) who wages metaphysical war against his own mind. He’s locked in a cell for reasons that we’ll never know, and thus has little else to do. That confinement leaves him plenty of time to focus entirely on inner battles.

Haven is the name of a place Cleril retreats to, inside of his head. He’s fully aware of his escapism. There’s no twist ending about which world is real; Haven’s a mental prison of his own making, a way to escape the physical prison others have made for him. It’s supposed to be idyllic. There are green fields and wispy clouds, all stacked on a lump of earth floating carelessly through the sky. With giant brown eyes scored into the ground that track your movement as you explore. You know, that old chestnut. Cleril lives there with the more agreeable alter-egos that splintered away from his personality. These include The Jester, who represents his sense of humour, and The Bookkeeper, who records his memories. 

But something isn’t quite right. Instead of ending up in Haven, Cleril’s latest trip into his own mind takes him to a location that he doesn’t recognise. It’s filled with inky black infants skittering around that both adore and loathe him. They’re ""inklings,"" the manifestation of ideas long abandoned. Some of them are warped, mutated and violent. Others are scared, or furious, or confidently indifferent. And they’re all trapped in this place where ideas come to die, kept in place by a hulking reaper with a double-sided scythe. The problem now is that Cleril is just as trapped as they are. By taking out the guard and claiming his own freedom, he’s essentially allowing his unchecked ideas run riot in his own mind.

[h1]❗ Sobre[/h1]
O jogo Haven um jogo de RPG com Adventure. Foi lançado no dia 5 de agosto de 2016. O jogo foi desenvolvido pela Cleril Calamty Studios, desenvolvedora de jogos sediada nos Estados Unidos.

[h1]🎮 Jogabilidade[/h1]
O jogo foi desenvolvido no RPG Maker VX, ele utiliza a mecânica padrão da IDE e uma engine de batalha de visão lateral, que lembra muito a engine padrão do RPG Maker 2003. É uma mecânica simples que funciona bem, sem maiores esquemas e de fácil aprendizado. O problema de se utilizar a engine padrão de caminhada é que o personagem fica muito preso e tem que andar sempre reto, então é bem comum o jogador travar mais distante ou mais próximo de duas barreiras semelhantes.

[h1]📝 História[/h1]
Uma história diferente da maioria das histórias em RPG, em que você precisa explorar partes da mente humana. Você passa por diversos cenários tentando descobrir segredos e revelar mistérios, lutando contra coisas que tentam controlar sua mente, algumas coisas você passa a descobrir que vem de você mesmo.

[h1]✏️ Gráficos[/h1]
O jogo possui gráficos muito simples, as vezes até repetitivos, por limitações da própria plataforma em que foi feito o jogo. Há o reuso de alguns gráficos padrões do RPG Maker, que por vezes tem uma diferença no padrão em relação aos gráficos do desenhista. Alguns desenhos até que ficaram interessantes, como a face dos personagens em luta e alguns panoramas, mas em geral o jogo tem gráficos simplórios. Quem não se importa muito com gráficos, como eu, não deve ser um problema.

[h1]🎵 Sons/Efeitos sonoros[/h1]
As músicas encaixam muito bem com a proposta e a história do jogo, são simples. Alguns efeitos sonoros, assim como alguns gráficos, são padrões do RPG Maker.

I played a bit of the game while it was in demo and thought it was relatively interesting so I think it was worth paying the five bucks to see how the rest of the game would go. Now whether it was worth my five bucks is kind of the point of this review by a guy with an avatar of Kurisu with a banana. I should note this review might have some mild spoilers.

Haven is a RPGmaker made RPG game about Cleril who is travelling through the various parts of his mind in a war against his own subconscious. The concept in itself is enough to make it a little different from your average RPGmaker fare otherwise I probably wouldn't have considered trying this game at all. Helping Cleril are his alter egos, other figments of his mind who aid him in this war. If you haven't brushed up on your psychoanalysis terms you might want to read the opening chapter of an intro to psychology book but otherwise it's very accessible. That said I think it was really enjoyable getting to explore the mind itself.

While the game isn't a 1080p AAA sexy beyond belief title I wouldn't say it's hideous, especially considering it's a game with a zero dollar budget. The art is fairly nice and hand made but some levels are more memorable than others but I wouldn't call any of them ugly. The characters and enemies designwise are actually pretty memorable parts of the game. I particularly like the design of the Alter Egos and the bosses although Cleril himself is give or take for me.

The gameplay is a variety of clicking on things, solving puzzles, exploring around, and turn based RPG combat. If you're not into RPGs this more than likely won't be the game that suddenly makes you fall in love with the genre. The puzzles range in difficulty and the later puzzles will take more thinking power but most won't leave you absolutely stumped. The only exception to this would be the very first puzzle in the Hippocampus which was stumped the hell out of me. I'm not exactly sure how many sidequests there are but I did play Jester's. The Stranger's was not finished however and a message is even left in the game saying as much which is disappointing.

Combat at first glance runs like any ol' turn based RPG but what makes this different is there is a skill tree system where Cleril and the alter egos can learn new skills and abilities which can change how your playstyle works. Think something like FF10's sphere grid or Digital Devil Saga's skill system but not as large. That said I do think some of the things you can get is very conditional and I never see a real need to ever use them so you'll likely be sticking to only certain skills. This does make experimentation a little interesting though for those who like to try different things. As for difficulty it definitely isn't blistering hard like a SMT title but it isn't piss easy either. You'll find some of the later bosses especially making you think a bit. There isn't a need to grind though so for those who hate grinding will enjoy this. There's even a button to have the alter egos at the same level as Cleril. You could grind if you really wanted to but I don't see the point.

Haven's music is a very mixed bag. It definitely has a variety of sounds from dubstep to blues to NIN esque industrial but it doesn't always fit every instance in the game to me. I think the music after The Hippocampus tends to be better in general. The lyrics in some of the songs can also be a little distracting. Overall though the music (mostly) does what it's supposed to be doing and I guess it's better than silence.

The writing seems to be one of the main points where the dev prides himself for this game. The story is definitely very philosophy driven and while I didn't necessarily agree with the arguments they were written mostly well but at times I felt like the philosophy talk makes the story confusing at times. For example there's points where all of the characters get philosophical and I find it gets confusing on what they're even talking about. As for conversations between characters they're fairly decent. The Jester ended up being my favorite character but I also came to find the rest interesting enough. That said I never felt a huge connection to any of the characters so I never felt a personal investment. It felt more like I'm an outside observer more than anything.

Earlier I mentioned how The Stranger's sidequest was not complete which leads into perhaps one of my main issues with Haven. The main story is complete but everything else seems to not be. The Stranger's sidequest wasn't done and I honestly have no idea if The Bookkeeper had one and if he did I somehow missed it despite talking to him before every level. There's also a part where you learn about an alter ego that no longer is around called The Flirt that Cleril says he no longer needed. I honestly wish this character was actually in the game though although it was interesting in itself that alter egos can disappear. After battle you'll also notice the victory spoils screen says ""This is just to prevent a crash."" I would have rather seen the dev make use of this screen somehow either through an item system or just some kind of money system and you could buy unlockables or something.

If you've noticed Haven updating several times part of that was me finding little issues here and there but the dev was extremely quick at fixing these issues. I will definitely give props to the dev for actually making sure to fix these issues so quickly and he's very approachable about any possible issues. 

So for all of this long winded writing written is Haven worth it? I would recommend this game. It's definitely not going to get an indie GOTY award from Geoff ""Dorito Pope"" Keighley but I would say it's a mostly solid title. I wish it had a little more content, achievements would've been nice, and perhaps a bit more polish wouldn't have hurt. Five bucks is fair enough to me but if you're on a budget I wouldn't say you should feel guilty about waiting for a sale. Overall it wasn't a waste of my time, I had fun, and I hope the dev learns from this and only improves from here. Don't believe some weirdo on Steam though, go play it for yourself and give your own review.

Plot of the game is revolving around the mind of guy named Cleril. We met few another personalities of him there and try to make yourself a solid person.

The main thing I don't like in this game - it's oversaturated by dialogues and other text. It's more like visuan novel, not rpg.
All locations are hand drawn. But they are so contradictory and peculiar that repel me from the game.
And few times music in the battle was much louder than before the battle.

May be game isn't bad at all, but it's so boring for me. I can't play more that one hour. I haven't find anything that can interested me. Battles are all the same, dialogues are all pompous and overly philosophical.

I'm aware that RPG Maker games usually have a bad rep because people usually affiliate games made in RPG Maker to be complete trash because (as the traielr for the engine describes) it's so simple that a kid can use it. However I'm always open minded when I go into these titles as there have been true classics made in the engine varying from games like Corpse Party and even the surprise that was The Deed. However Haven fits into the category of what most people tend to think RPG Maker titles are affiliated with, complete trash and then some.

Gameplay in Haven is the typical sort of thing you can expect for a game made in the engine. You walk around, interact with things and get into battles. Now usually the gameplay in RPG Maker games are quite hard to mess up but somehow it's messed up in this particular title. The main issue with this is that you could probably just spam the attack button and win. I remember there was a notice that came up before a boss battle saying ""It's best to save here, you're probably gonna die"" (litterrally that's what it says, I'll be talking about those messages a bit later.) So I saved and guess what happened? I spammed the attack button and I won. ""Designed for RPG veterans"" my a*s. Now I also want to talk about the messages. One of the games main promotions that it features is that there's ""No handholding"" that is compeltely false. This game tells you absolutely everything. It reccommends points where you save, litterrally saying along the lines of ""This is a challenging battle, may I reccommend you save."" Also not only that, there's a 3rd screen that appears after a battle saying ""This is here only to prevent a crash."" Usually when this happens in other games, the screen is converted into something else. This is common practicie among huge developers as well, they take a glitch and then make it into it's own unique thing. A great example is the Creeper from MineCraft. The Creeper actually came from a bug when the develoeprs were designing the pig, so instead of covereing the design up saying ""Error, this thing wasn't meant to load"" they actually converted it into something new for the game. That's what could have easily happened here, you could have added in a new aspect to the gameplay with the menu or you could have made the player obtain loot and that menu could show it. Anything could have done, not just a piece of text saying ""This is here to prevent crashes.""

The story is both the best and the worst part of the game. For most RPG and Adventure game titles, the story is what carries the game, it gives the player a reason to continue. Now Haven has a pretty good setup for a story but the execution isn't quite there. The story is you are basically playing as the main character called Cleril and you're exploring his psyche and he's trying to explore for something I guess. He's accompanied by other personalities that he has and when put together they make up the actual person when they're actually just divided personalities helping the man actually discover something. In case you didn't realise my complaint when explaining the plot, my main issue is that it's confusing. It let's you in on the plot well enough but the the more you head into the story, it just becomes more confusing. You might be thinking that that's the main point of the story and even though it is, it should be explaining things better because I realised that the main character seemed to be all caught up with everything you needed to be. I feel like if the main plot is to explore the main psyche of a character, I should be exploring it along with him but at the start of the game, he seems to know more than I do.

The graphics are sort of hard to sum up. The graphic style seems inconsistant. Now I wouldn't mind if you just kept with your primary graphic style that you were using for the characters and the environment, even though those in general look sub par, at least it would be consistant. There are these random out of place looking images that look like they were just stuck onto the screen (look at the 4th screenshot for the game as my example.) Now the sound, when the game started the sound seemed pretty good but then it took a turn southwards around 40 mins into the game when there was suddenly lyrics thrown into the music which made the music seem really out of place. If you want an idea of how out of place it seems, just imagine fighting a dragon in Skyrim and instead of having that epic music playing, replace it with the Incy Wincy Spider nursery rhyme being sung by kids. Yeah, that's how out of place it seems.

It's hard to really find much to like about Haven because the majority of it is bad but when there is something good in it, it quickly disregards it and swaps it out for something bad or when there is potential for something it just seems dissappointing when it reaches the pay off.

Pros
+ Potential for a good plot

Cons
- Simplistic gameplay
- Handholding
- Out of place messages
- Confusing plot
- Inconsistant graphics
- Out of place music

Berechtigte Frage, aber ich habe wesentlich mehr Spielzeit als es den Anschein macht, da ich das Spiel schon länger verfolge und durch Demos immer auf dem Laufenden bleiben konnte.**

Ein auf den ersten Blick sehr seltsam wirkendes Spiel. Hier braucht man Mut für Neues und darf nicht auf Triple-A Spiele wie Final Fantasy fixiert sein und mit gleichen Erwartungen hinein gehen. 
Im Gegenteil : Wenn man mit dem Gedanken rein geht, dass eine einzige Person all das kreiert hat, von der Story, bis hin zu den Grafiken, welche fast alle handgezeichnet sind - anscheinend über Jahre hinweg, durch Greenlight, bis hin zu Steam selbst - dann lernt man Spiele aus anderen Augen zu sehen und in all ihren Details zu schätzen.

Selten passiert es hier auf Steam, dass ein RPG durch das Greenlight Programm kommt, ohne mit japanischen, halbnackten Frauen zu werben. (Ja ich rede hier von dir, Sakura Spirit, und all den Spielen die in deine Reihe gehören.) Umsomehr kann man schlichte, aber detaillierte Gegner bewundern, wie in RPG´s vor 15 Jahren, beispielsweise wieder mit dem Wink zu FF1. Nur haben wir durch heutige Möglichkeiten mehr Arten zu Variieren, wie man hier auch sieht.

Auch gibt es jetzt schon Kommentare die sich über die Auflösung aufregen. Mit ein wenig Verstand ist es aber auch nachvollziehbar warum sie so ist wie sie ist. RPG Makern ist es nicht ohne weiteres möglich solche Spiele in Full HD wieder zu geben. Dies sollte kein Problem sein, da dieses Spiel auch nicht versucht durch die neueste Unreal Engine zu punkten oder Ähnliches.
Die einzige Kritik die ich bisher gut verstehen konnte war die, dass es keinen offensichtlichen Vollbild Modus gibt. Wie aber jeder mit mehr als 3 Spielen in der Bibliothek wissen sollte kriegt man die meisten Spiele mit Alt+Enter in oder aus dem Vollbildmodus. (Eine weitere Möglichkeit wäre ingame  F1 zu drücken und es per Checkbox zu ändern, aber die erste Variante ist diesbezüglich wesentlich schneller)

Da die Story in meinen Augen ein Hauptgrund für die Existenz des Spiels darstellt, werde ich nicht darauf eingehen. Sie ist durchdacht und tiefer als es den Anschein macht, inhaltlich werde ich aber nichts verraten.

Fehler werden sicherlich von dem Entwickler berücksichtigt, schließlich ist das Spiel erst seit einem Tag auf Steam und wenn man ihn sich näher ansieht, sieht man, dass es auch sein Erstes hier offiziel veröffentlichtes ist. Wie weit sich das Spiel noch verbessern kann wird nur die Zukunft zeigen können, aber ihr könnt immerhin dabei helfen ein paar altmodischere und normalere RPG´s als diese vorher genannten zu unterstützen. 5€ sind schließlich wirklich kein Preis für einige Stunden Spielspaß.
