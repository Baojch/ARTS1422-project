As it says right on the box, this is a Mahjong (tile matching, not tile/cardgame) game that is VR exclusive.  What does VR bring to the old formula of tile matching Mahjong?  Nothing.  And that, co-incidentally, is the exact value this game has for gamers.

This seems to have been made a VR exclusive to prevent any comparison with non-VR 3D games, a comparison that this game would fail very badly at.  Developers must learn that while VR is great, if the only thing that makes the game great is the VR, then the game isn't great at all.

VR aside, for all intents and purposes ""Relaxing VR Games: Mahjong"" might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Relaxing VR Games: Mahjong didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for collecting 9 ""stars"", this is trivial and can be done in a few minutes, but only around 25 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

The poor quality of this game is also reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Relaxing VR Games: Mahjong is relatively cheap at $3 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Because this is the kind of game you can just play for free on mobile phones, it's impossible to recommend anyone should pay money for the same experience on Steam.
