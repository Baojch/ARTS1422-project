Pros:
-Able to take control and manage individual colonists/robots.
-Can make separate rooms in your colony which can be specialized for specific tasks (workshop,living area,hydroponics)
-Realism (if you have hydroponics and use red and blue light the plants will grow faster).
-Good Graphics

Cons:
-No endgame (after you make your buildings and the colonists are happy there's no much to do. You can research some stuff but that's it. There needs to be more buildings and items. 
-Colonists don't reproduce. (People land on colony and that's it you cap at 15 colonists)
-Colonist relationships are basic (some will complain about others but there is no colonist profile that you can access whenever. Only when the pop up come up once.)
-Can only have 2 livestock (chicken and an alien.)
-Again its SO BORING after you complete everything. Maybe make it so we can expand outside the bounds of the cave area. Build a space station. Author just needs to add more stuff.",1646155703,1646155703,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There's a great foundation but its utterly tarnished by the fact that this game is utterly opaque to the player.

Its very difficult to tell what is going on. And the colonists are just... Dumb. ""Fire in Storage"" No one is running. Everyone is just leisurely walking around. Um Hello, Fire? Get extinguishers? Something? No?

There's no way to prioritize so if your colonists need toilets, too bad they're going to build something else first. 

Building robots dont help that much either. 
Everyone and everything moves at this leisurely pace where there's no sense of urgency. You'd think the firefighting robots would move quickly but nope, its like an RC car with low batteries.


They sprint like 3 steps and then stop. The 3 steps and then stop. Wounded colonists just... dont appear to do anything about it? I just had two colonists die because they refused to go to medical with beds and dispenser... Is it because the scanner wasnt built? Well gee sure would be nice to prioritize that. Oh wait I cant.

any other colony or building sim type game can let your prioritize but not this game.

I played this way back in early access and I'm still encountering the same issues. I really want to love this game but man it makes it hard.

With the autosave I only lost a few minutes here and there when it happened.  I didn't really run into any bugs.  I find it to be quite playable with a fair amount of content.

That's not to say I didn't run into problems.  The design of this game will sometimes come across as bugs because it is so far from what most games follow.  Such as the fact that unlike 99% of the colony builders out there your people won't refuse to work in order to get enough rest or follow a schedule.  They will simply die of fatigue if you give them too much to do but you can't see the fatigue level of your people.  You are left wondering what happened.  You don't know what you need to do, what is wrong, or what is about to go wrong.  You are in a perpetual state of guessing.  

What's the first thing you do when you load a colony builder?  Look for the power, temp, and oxygen report or overlay and info on colonist health/mood.  You won't immediately find it.  That info exists (well except colonist info) but you'll have to go hunting for it.  You have to locate the existence of an item in the build menu that does what you want when you can't just view everything in it. You have to select the objects menu while in the right room or against a wall to see those items.  Took awhile to even figure out there was a wall objects menu with a heater.  Mouse over the correct area to get a pop up of the needed info or hunt down reports in the email system in the corner that along with your power and alerts also includes requests whether you'd like to listen to someone's music or poetry.

Games like this generally use overlays and organized reports rather than relying completely on mouse overs and little messages.  I understand the overall feel the dev was going for with the email system but my gmail is more organized than that and I don't use it for anything important.  Using a more limited and rougher system for setting the mood in the game is a very difficult thing that has to be done just right to still provide all the wanted info in easy to access locations without the typical display systems.  This attempt comes close to breaking the game.


Overall I've decided maia's gameplay just feels outdated.  A game in 1998 to early 2000s might have numbered menu lists to select things, rely on hotkeys, make you mouse over things or check messages that appear on the screen for info,etc...  These days most players are used to relying on a mouse instead of keyboard shortcuts and all the needed info ready to access.  At minimum you have a direct drop down/pop up menu that after clicking on the icon for the type of thing you want you then just move your mouse straight up/down to click on what you want from that list.  In Maia you have to hold alt to get a list in text and then move your mouse over to it while the camera spins wildly in the background.  Then fix your camera to place the item.  Option B is to select room or object and then hit q and e to scroll one by one through potentially around 19 items to get the right one.  Tedious, clumsy, outdated.


Somewhat older players used to keyboard controlled list menus, hotkeys, and limited info presentation will have the easiest time adjusting to this game.  Majority of players will likely just get frustrated and quit before they figure it out or after they figure it out they won't want to play with the slow UI design.  If you need everything right there at your fingertips without hotkeys and to know everything going on all the time then this game is not for you.  If you can't handle failing over and over again while figuring out game play that is not at all obvious then don't touch this game.  One attempt I just ignored everyone and let them die while running my mouse over rooms and walls, scrolling around outside, and looking at what was available to me before trying again.   If you want a challenge, like discovering things for yourself or solving puzzles, and don't mind using a keyboard based selection system then this game may have many interesting hours to offer.",1611805270,1611805270,True,2,0,0.516592621803283691,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There is a lot that is not working too good for me but overall the game is going into the right direction. 

Don't expect a well balanced game - it is not. Though, the basics are all there and working. For some reason, it feels meaningless after playing a while. My guess is, that the GUI is simply hiding too much information that I like to have in these type of games. Why is it so hard to organize my labor? This is a vital feature in such games. Even after I build something where I thought I could manage work - I just could cycle colonists through a list without a clou what this is actually doing. Even though it feels rewarding to see one's colony growing, it is a bit too much, that I feel being just a spectator who places object blueprints and then waiting literally hours until stuff is being built. It's fine for that I have no direct control, but I need prioritization at least! It's so frustrating that some stuff is not being built over hours, other objects are built even though my build order came later. Also when building, it just says ""building materials needed"" - but not how much? So I have this feeling, that something is going wrong with the game's job system. Most of my colonists are walking around, repairing stuff. Sometimes they walk as if being sick - but they are not visiting the medical bay. And so forth. 

So my biggest criticism is, that the game's UI is kind of not good for this type of game. I don't feel like having the control about stuff. The second biggest issue is the job system for me as I have no clue why certain stuff is never built. Thirdly, the game seem to have some serious bugs. 

I have bought when it was heavily discoutned at 6,79 Euro. So I am not complaining. Also I saw, it's obviously one developer with a bunch of supporters rather than a sophisticated game dev studio. I really hope they are getting things straight here. Instead of adding new features like cosmetic stuff, I strongly recommend to get the game right.

Everything happens super slowly, with most of the time spent looking at the colonists wandering around, not really doing anything useful.

-As the settlers not moving and the building phase is annoying (3 options and you have to use Q,E to rotate the items) the game becomes dull and borring in under an hour.

I judge it as late Alpha, maybe early Beta.

You build a colony by satisfying the needs of the colonists. You can't control them directly, but that's OK, because they know what to do to get what they need. What you need to do is manage resources, create the layout, and provide your colony a balanced diet while they get on with the Science.

At least, that what it should be, if your colonists were not neurotic, suicidal toddlers.

Your colonists die of fatigue because they got /stuck/ between a bed and a wall, without actually sleeping in it.
Your colonists die of asphyxiation because they would rather stand resolutely /just outside/ the airlock and die in their spacesuits.
Your colonists die of thirst because somehow the exit to get to the water still got /overgrown/, but the leaf-trimming robots would rather peek inside toilets.
Your colonists die of hypothermia because they'd rather make /potted plants/ than...well, apparently anything.
Your colonists die of broken bones sustained because they don't know how to walk smoothly from place to place.
Your colonists die of, I don't know, loneliness? because they wall off rooms /before/ and /without/ making the doors to get in and out.

Space is dangerous, but blithering stupidity is worse.

The developer(s) should spend less time programming the colonists to get angry when they see red glowsticks (apparently that's a thing in this game), and more time instructing them not to stand idly next to flaming machinery.",1604865609,1604865609,False,37,6,0.790308058261871338,0,True,False,False,False,,,

HOWEVER, there are a few things that I feel I need to say as well as ask. I am going to go back through some of the issues I have had in the last two hours of play. 

Firstly the colonists' AI/IA (Artificial intelligence/Intelligent Agents) ; Now I understand us as the 'Overseer' of these projects I can not control the colonists directly. There are a few things I feel are laking and some that I just plain wrong or a bug.
So with the lack of complete control (which I have no issues with as I have played many games like this), the fact there is no prioritising ablity is a surprising and rather irritating issue.
Next, Lava. So I am amazed that these extremely advanced and trained colonists don't understand that when lava is coming towards them to RUN! I lost two colonists, one robot and a chicken due to one drop of lava coming down straight outside the room.

Next, you have the weather. This planet seems to be worse than England for how many different kinds of weather you can get in one day. I had rain, fog, asteroids, solar flares and earthquakes in less than a full day. Now I don't mind too much. Apart from that when an earthquake happens, everyone becomes useless...even when they are right next to a fire. O yes did I forgot to mention that in the issues with the AI? (well no I just thought it worked better here).
Another issue I had was an earthquake that lasted over a day and continued when I started t new game.

Then the tutorial is a bit unpredictable, and when I had to reload as it is not very restriving in events, I had to restart the game and the tutorial. Why? Well, the fact that almost everything became unviewable and my mouse vanished. 

The last thing I am going to mention is that fact that the UI (User Interface) is very chaotic and not very user friendly. Now it's not bad enough that I would have mentioned it usually however with everything else put together it needed to be mentioned.

Now there is a lot of interesting protention to the game; however, I feel it's like it is still in beta, and I would not say it is a finished game just yet. However, it is good to see there are still updates coming out. 

I hope to see these issues ironed out as this looks to like a game I could sink days into playing.

I purchased this game when it was new to steam, every few years I reinstall it and check on the progress, I last reviewed this game in 2021. Unfortunately I still cannot recommend this game.  The graphics have been updated a little, but I find no changes to game play despite the updates from the developer. The game still has all the bugs that were in the game on it's first release as an early access game in 2018 including but not limited to:

Colonist starve to death while having food in their inventory. 
Colonists Die from exhaustion because they will not go to sleep on one of the many beds.
Colonist die of thirst with plenty of water available, including water stations in each room.
Colonists get stuck on chairs, tables, ect and die because they can't move.
IMP robots run around breaking stuff faster than repair robots/colonists can fix them.

Now, after you get to about 12 colonists, several colonist does nothing but move from one food prep station  to the next removing all the prepared food, in seconds 6 prep stations with 40K units of food will have none and the colonists will still move from station to station taking food, never eating.

Colonists still randomly walk outside without a space suit, and still walk inside with the space suit.
Equipment placed on walls randomly changed position, sometimes on the wall of a neighboring room, other times just hanging in the middle of a hallway.

The developer is still active, there are still updates being pushed to the game, however, the developer is still treating the game as an Alpha level Early access and not addressing the bugs that have plagued the game from the day it became available on steam.

If you can deal with the bugs or just don't care about them, it's not a bad game to play and can be an interesting challenge. As long as you can keep from running out of colonists you can keep the game going. 

Review from 2021------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I originally Reviewed this game in 2020, At that time, the developer had marked the game complete and said that they would keep working on it as they had time. I saw that they had not stopped working on the game so I reinstalled it and started a game to see what had changed. 

While some things have changed, like you can only have 3 EMP robots (used to be 6) and are limited to 10 colonists (was unlimited), I was surprised to find that the same bugs are still in the game, bugs like, Colonists starve to death with plenty of food, Colonists and Robots spend lots of time doing nothing, Colonists walk outside without a space suit, sometimes they die sometimes they don't, Colonists Still ignore priority setting, Devices catch fire for no reason.

Even though the game is marked full release and while the developer is still updating the game, it is still very much an early access Alpha stage game. many bugs, some dating back to it's original release on steam and there is very little content to the game, I still can not recommend this game in it's current state.

Original Review:
Maia had a lot of potential, however, half way though the Alpha phase of development the developer said the game wasn't making enough money, as a result he has marked the game complete and stopped development. 

The game is decent to play, but there are many bugs and glitches in the game, some of them game breaking.  If you can deal with the bugs, (people just wandering around not doing anything, fires starting for no reason and people/robots not repairing/building things, people starving to death with more than enough food on hand. ect) then the game is actually ok, those bugs just make it very hard to progress.   

I would suggest waiting until it's on sale for like $5.00 if you want it.",1583676491,1684190856,False,16,0,0.580067992210388184,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game looks great and feels like a modern spin on a 80s game but for me that is as far as the good goes. The UI is clunky and awkward to use. Things that should happen automatically, like building rooms is almost impossible as the AI queuing system is flawed. Crashes are just as frequent now as in early access to the point where I find myself quick-saving every couple of minutes just to be safe - not how I should be playing any game.

Don't attempt to play this game with more than 1 monitor or any monitor above 1080p - my in-game FPS counter shows 60 but the screen actually renders at < 1 FPS.

I think the core failure here was to build a custom game engine: ""MAIA USES A CUSTOM BUILT ENGINE ALLOWING AAA QUALITY GRAPHICS WITHOUT REQUIRING HIGH SYSTEM SPECS"".

Even when you do mark things as a priority your colonists can sometimes take their sweet time getting there to do it while they finish some other minute tasks beforehand. Hurts when its time critical.
3.	Building anything is horribly inconsistent. Sometimes you place it in the middle of a room and no colonist can find a path to it or nobody is ever assigned to build it. If it does get built then sometimes everyone ignores its existence or suddenly can’t path around it, to the other things in the room, or to it to use it. Special mentions for being unbuildable goes to IVs.
4.	Your colonists don’t give enough feedback. Things can be looking swell then suddenly they’re committing suicide. Supposedly they have moods but in the time I’ve been playing they’ve gone from happily running around to walking out an airlock within seconds. Note. This is different from 5 as apparently suicide is sudden and they don’t go to the med center first.
5.	Medical issues. If a colonist breaks a bone that’s the best option as it’s over. Every other nonfatal fatal issue will never go away and you’ll never stop hearing about how so-and-so has high blood pressure or depression even when you try to brighten up everywhere in your base, with the proper colors, or have cows/chickens on all your copious wall screens.
6.	Lights in general. Most rooms seem to come in dim and gloomy and every light you can install has a range of 3 feet from it. The most inefficient bulbs in space were used.
7.	Heat. Getting warm is easy. Cooling off is nearly impossible. The only option to cool off the room involves emptying the room of its atmosphere. The fans that empty the room of its atmosphere seem to work faster than the atmosphere generator replenishes it. This would be an issue if we were actually in space and not on a planet where we could just dump excess heat outside.
8.	Doors. Sometimes they just stop building it. You get a doorway, with no actual door, with a “Door in construction” message but nobody comes back.

Some entertaining, to me at least, stories.
1.	I accidently made a couch of doom once. The colonists could get into range to sit but once they tried standing up a chair, part of a table, a few feet away broke their pathing so they just stood there until they starved to death. I had 3 bodies that the bots couldn’t get to before I found the issue was the table.
2.	The Farm segment is actually dangerous because of too many chickens. Can’t kill them, apparently you don’t eat them, and my chickens reproduced like mad. Chickens also produce a fair amount of heat so they quickly overheat the room they’re in, one of them bursts into flames, runs around putting all the other chickens on fire, and then there is a die off. My chickens go from 40+ to 3 and my base starts cooling off but the chickens start breeding again.

Do note: I say I don’t recommend AT THIS TIME. Once it gets fleshed out more and some of the more obvious issues get resolved this could very easily be a great game. Even with the bugs I had had fun but if everything goes well you rather quickly get to a point of there is nothing to do.",1558244660,1558244660,False,15,2,0.642073750495910645,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I first found it while doing a Google search for god games, and I signed up for the mailing list. I was incredibly excited when I received an email announcing that the game was finally in Early Access on Steam in December 2013. Unfortunately, I had a sub-par laptop at the time, and the game was not well-optimized, so I had to wait a few more months until I could play it. Once I was able to load the game successfully, I found a brutal challenge with absolutely no tutorials and confusing controls, and all my colonists died repeatedly because I had no clue what I was doing. But I just thought to myself, ""[i]Maia[/i] is still in Early Access; it'll shape up into a playable game in the long run.""

Only a couple weeks shy of the five-year mark, [i]Maia[/i] finally left Early Access, and I've just played it for the first time since the release. Last time I played was about a year ago, and by then, the game was certainly playable and made sense. But since its official launch—hehe, launch—it's been given quite a lovely partial makeover by its sole developer, Simon Roth. The interface is refined—just don't expect it to tell you nearly everything you need to know, though, because this game hates you, and that's the idea. The keyboard controls are pretty natural once you figure them out—you can map them yourself if you don't like them, however—but this is a game that absolutely requires a mouse, and you'll probably start out using that for most things. The game does a very, very good job of driving home its status as a god game, giving you only indirect control over most characters, though you can directly control some robots and a couple other machines. The new tutorial is exactly what the game has been missing for five years, and it will set you properly on your way to managing a functioning colony, albeit while being snarky and condescending.

So all in all, I would say that [i]Maia[/i] has turned out pretty great! However, this is not a casual game; it's still brutally difficult, and the first few days of your campaign are crucial to your colony's survival. And do not get too attached to any of your colonists. Unfortunately, the game still feels a little rough around the edges, although nowhere nearly as much as it did even just a year ago. There's also only four save slots (plus another two that are reserved for auto-save and quick-save, respectively) for some reason, and they are shared across all your campaigns: scenarios and sandbox alike. The scarcity of save slots is probably the biggest drawback for me. It's also kind of pricey. Obviously, Simon put heaps of work into this and deserves [i]all of the pounds[/i] for what he has created here, but similar games like [i]Banished[/i] that also feel a bit more polished overall and sport a more diverse set of features do tend to run slightly cheaper. I snagged the game at 25% off for its Early Access launch promotion, and I think that would be a more reasonable price. (Yeah, it's like a US$6 difference, but I'm about to be drowning in student debt, so $6 is a fortune for me!)

In summary, [i]Maia[/i] sets a new gold standard for god games in the post-Molyneux era. It's gritty in its presentation, brutal in its pursuit of realism, and fun in its honest simulation (that is speckled with bleak humor) of a new space colony beyond the stars. Sure, it could use some improvement—and thankfully (and admirably), Simon has promised continued updates past launch, including the addition of new features—and may be on the pricey side for the somewhat narrow range of existing features and modes, but as the baby of one person developing it all on his own, including some rather impressive AI, [i]Maia[/i] is definitely worth adding to your wishlist.",1550723282,1550723282,True,7,3,0.48219597339630127,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The tutorial is broken, stuff will not register as being built like the tutorial asks for.

The UI is just so unorthodox, its confusing, looks bad and has no real clean way to organize and set what you want to build. Yea, ok roll the mouse wheel or use the Q and/or E keys to go thru the objects one by one until you find what you are looking for. Use the middle mouse button to look at a small condensed list of 5 things that so far I can not find a easy way to scroll thru it.

When I first bought into this EA title I was full of hope that Simon would get it right.

Why do devs make a game that is only appealing to them when the masses tell them it needs to change. Listen to the public and quit being stubborn. You cant make any money selling the game to only yourself.

Save yourself some money and find something else so I don't have to tell you "" I TOLD YOU SO""

After 5 years there is no way for me to get a refund.

The User Interface is STILL, after several years, absolutely abysmal.
Excusing a lack of features is possible, but if most features are just an absolute pain in the ass to even get to, then what is the point?
This game has tons of potential but sadly it is just a chore to play.

This is what happens when you develop your own engine and exactly why most studios don't.
You end up working more on the engine, rather than the game.

A small, experienced team could probably make this game in UE4 within 6 months.

Maia is a game developed by Simon Roth and published by Machine Studios

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

The game also suffers with some weird bugs and glitches which the developer seemed to have overlooked but they don't hinder the game at all and the UI in this game is simply the most annoying and awkward UI I've ever had the audacity of using

Maia overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts!

Maia was the first project I ever backed on Kickstarter back in 2013 - a mere £10 paid for alpha access and, by extension, the full release these five years later.

It's been a long time since then. In that time I've backed many, many other projects on that site. Some I've backed, and received a full, satisfying product on time and on point. Some I've backed, and despite a long delay have exceeded all expectations. And there have been others I've backed, and watched as the updates became less and less frequent, until the project - and my money - faded into the ether, to join the other failed projects in the silent Kickstarter graveland of wind and ghosts.

This game is different to all of these. The good ship Maia has essentially had one guy at the helm, Mr Simon Roth, for the duration of its long, misty voyage. His game idea didn't generate an insane amount of funds on the crowdfunding site (at least relative to recent successes), but it would have been enough to get this kid a decent terraced house somewhere outside of London if he'd decided to cut and run. And believe me, over the next few years as I occasionally found my cash sucked into a few bum steers on Kickstarter (That Which Sleeps, After Reset, and The Mandate, if you're interested), there were times when I felt certain that Maia would be the fourth bum steer, the fourth project to lay with the wind and the ghosts.

But it didn't. Every time I convinced myself it was over, out came another update, small in scope, yet titanic in meaning, as far as I was concerned. I mean damn the thing was shuffling along slower than a Hammock ballad, but it DIDN'T STOP SHUFFLING.

Then Simon advertised a link to his latest blog about two years ago now. https://blog.maiagame.com/how_to_delay_your_indiegame/

Having literally nothing else to do or look at on the internet at that exact moment, I clicked on it. I read the whole thing, and I understood that this nerdy Oxford kid, this kid I had thrown £10 at in the heady honeymoon era of Kickstarter, was in pain. That pain of RESPONSIBILITY. Responsibility that, if deleted, would not delete the pain, and ergo a responsibility that MUST be fulfilled. And I knew then. I fucking knew then. This kid wasn't giving up. This ship was staying the course.

And so here I am, too. Though he didn't do it personally, today Simon asked us - he asked ME -  to leave a review on Steam. So here I am, five years later, with more swathes of grey hairs, a bigger gut and shorter breath. But I'm not giving up, because I've got responsibilities too.

    [*]Strange bugs. I started a new game and immediately my robot started digging out dirt without me having selected anything, completely breaking the bulkhead system.

    [*]The popups... more trouble than they are worth unfortunately. It doesn't help to get updates about the electricity situation, I need to be able to see supply/demand at a specific point in time, for instance, before I start building a new room.

    [*]Even worse is the colonist requests which simply pop up like an internet ad and steals your input while interrupting whatever you were doing at the time.

It swings from a low pace base builder with an enormously detailed simulation behind every little thing you see and can interact with to a frantic struggle for survival as the dangers of Maia strike the unprepared mercilessly. Prepare to be unprepared and learn by failing.

If you prefer to learn from the mistakes of others - or perhaps boast about your most successful survival or expansion tips and strategies, visit [url=https://wiki.maiagame.com] the official wiki[/url] and help it grow.

Much like the games it draws inspiration from you do not control your colonists directly but act more as an overseer and planner for what they should do. You decide where rooms go, what goes into them, and where to get resources from - in the form of placing digging orders. Colonists make their own priorities based on their current needs and leave feedback in form of personal emails and  expressing their most immediate needs through body language. Colonists arrive to Maia in pods which can be called down from orbit at certain intervals. Then they need to get into your base quite quickly as the atmosphere is toxic and you don't can't be outside without a suite - unlike the native flora and fauna which aren't always so happy to see new arrivals. 

There's a story driven campaing with missions letting you learn about colonist needs and how to satisfy them, told through radio conversations  with the orbital command and related managment functions. They've put you in charge of setting up several bases to accomplish tasks like establishing research facilities to learn more about the planet and technologies needed to survive there.

The overall style is very sci-fi-from-the-80's, despite being set in the distant future, people have realized colonising harsh environments require tried and trustworthy tech, with some robotics and AI applied here and there to help out where it's too dangerous (or inconvenient) to have humans spend their precious time, sweat and blood. AI isn't trusted with weaponry though, a few stationary turrets and handguns do just fine and won't uninionize on you to start making their own demands.

The humor, both explicit in voiceover/text and implicit in visual style, is [i]very[/i] British, but suits the style very well and I've become quite fond of it after spending many hours trying to expand bases in a timely fashion - yes, pacing yourself is key, even during panics. Overwhealming your colonists with tasks is most likely going to be your first mistake, and thus also your last in that scenario. Maia - as in both the planet and the game - forgives some mistakes, but only up to a certain point.

I have not played many other games which are quite like this. Dwarf Fortress is probably the closest one in terms of finding out what to do, when to do it, why you should do it, and how to understand what's actually going on. The amount of input and feedback can be both overwhealming (you'll be dismissing a lot of emails) and frustratingly sparse (try following your colonists and robots around to see what they're actually doing and pay attention to your storage levels!)

I've been with this game since the Kickstarter and I think Simon - the single developer now working full time on Maia - has delivered very well and met all my expectations. There have been delays of course, but taking on a game like this is a massive task and easy to underestimate. Simon has done - and keeps doing - a fantastic job of engaging with the community and acting (sometimes within minutes!) on the feedback provided. He's got a clear vision and communicates it well.

It's a fantastic game for the audience it's aimed at and my only hope for it is to keep going in the same direction. Special thanks to Simon for staying strong and keeping Linux gamers in mind.",1543000105,1543001027,True,20,0,0.609141170978546143,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The AI pathing is awful.

If they do remember to eat and sleep, sometimes they get so depressed they just walk outside and commit suicide. (And honestly I know how they feel)

The tutorial: I love the sassyness and it gets all the stuff you need to know across. Problem is that sometimes stuff just doesn't happen. Colonist don't start on a crucial part, like the Wind Mill. You're supposed to move an atmosphere generator, like 2 minutes after you've built it, and while doing so, it just catches on fire. And noone cares. The colonist just keeps moving the thing while it's burning. All while the mouse-over says its in excellent condition?

Un guide vidéo provisoire a été publié [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/252250/discussions/0/1692669912403602379/]ici[/url].
Le jeu est actuellement en fin d'accès anticipé, mais le développeur a indiqué qu'il souhaitait poursuivre des mises à jours régulières. Quoi qu'il en soit, celui-ci est déjà très prenant, je ne regrette absolument pas mon achat !

Le développeur est très actif sur Discord et les forums, et les problèmes sont corrigés rapidement. Le jeu dispose aussi d'une bêta mise à jour quotidiennement. Une liste des mises à jour peut d'ailleurs être trouvée ici: https://dev.maiagame.com/

Ce qui distingue Maia des autres jeux est que les colons ne sont pas contrôlés directement. Ceux-ci ont des besoins et une volonté propre. Il ne faut pas les surcharger d'ordres de constructions, sinon ceux-ci risquent de tomber de fatigue. Ceux-ci sont libres de former des liens sociaux entre eux, leurs compétences s'améliorent avec la pratique. Il vous feront part de tout cela par e-mail, ainsi que de ce qu'ils pensent de la base, de leurs besoins, etc (pas toujours de manière explicite, cependant).

De plus, le jeu est vraiment une simulation complète, la plupart des mécanismes étant simulés de manière assez plausible : par exemple, la température du corps est calculée en fonction de l'émissivité radiative de celui-ci, de la quantité d'énergie dépensée pour l'activité, des coefficients d'absorption et de réflexion du vêtement porté, ainsi que de la température de la salle (convection et émission radiative). Et chacune des compétences, aussi loufoque soit-elle, a un impact sur le jeu.
Il s'agit véritablement d'un jeu de ""SF dure"", où les technologies sont plausibles, et dans le futur proche.

Le jeu a énormément de potentiel, même si celui-ci affiche de nombreux problèmes en l'état, et s'avère difficile à prendre en main.

I still absolutely recommend this. It’s very relaxing and hilarious fun at times when an unfortunate chain of events culminate in an unexpected disaster :D

This game always had a very steady progress, unlike other EA games, and it was fun keeping an eye on it and watch the improvements over time. Remember that this is an Indie and not a huge studio. I’m a dev myself and I tell you it’s amazing what S. Roth managed to achieve here. He could also be reached e.g. via Discord or Twitter so I’ve absolutely no idea why some people here complain that they were ignored. Mayhap they were simply rude?

Don’t give the bad reviews here too much credit. The annoying repeating crashes e.g. that many players describe did only happen in fact for Windows players due to a bug with async operations in a library from Microsoft. That was not related to the game itself, and is fixed by now. This game didn’t crash for me in hours on Linux so I believe this statement by the dev. And to this dude blaming this killed his hard-disk or boot-loader or whatsoever: Just no. This is not how computers work o0

It's not a casual game, and you'll have to spend quite some time thinking about the order and arrangement of what you build to optimise your base and prevent unnecessary bottlenecks and/or death. It has a deep level of simulation when it comes to things like temperature and atmospheric systems, as well as colonist psychology and behaviours, which isn't made immediately apparent to the player with hard numbers. Instead, you have to use the information provided to you be the colonists' reports and in-game objects (such as info screens) a lot more than you use many parts of the UI.

As a game that's been in early access for a long while, most of the negative reviews revolve around bugs which were long fixed, features which have long since been implemented, and a general level of polish and completeness that didn't exist years ago but does now. Complaints like the lack of tutorial are entirely invalid, for example; it has one.
Simon's a wonderful dev who'll identify and begin to fix problems you find in the game very rapidly, and quite often the more amusing emergent ""features"" become features indeed.

Both games are stunning in their visuals in their own ways, as would be expected given the different settings. Maia goes to extra lengths to really draw one into this sort of Low Maia Orbit view where you monitor your colonists' behavior & changing moods/attitudes, guide their mining and base construction, and try to make sure they don't rapidly starve, dehydrate, and die of exhaustion. 

In short, it's a base building & management sim, with many of the quirks you'd expect of that if you've played other games of the sort. 

Where Maia really shines though is in capturing the hard scifi aesthetic. Maia is an extremely tumultuous world, prone to earthquakes and hurricanes; while also being in an active star system, with its local star flaring up from time to time creating electromagnetic interference that generates blackouts and the occasional meteorite shower that can smash surface constructions yet also provide some useful research material. 

Oh, and both earthquakes and meteor showers can lead to cave-ins as you carve out your base, so you gotta watch out for those even more than you otherwise might...Alongside stumbling into the occasional vein of lava that can swallow up IMPs (mining robots) & colonists if you're not careful.

It's challenging, but if you can work your way through all that, you get to see a cool little base come together and see colonists eke out their new lives on another planet. Plus, you get some amusing stories about remote controlling repair bots to fix stuff and accidentally setting livestock on fire because they just happened to pass too close to your welding arm, IMPs going stir crazy from not being issued many orders lately, & sabotaging things, and then of course sometimes simply forgetting to throw together some repair & cleaning bots leading to things catching fire or acting up.

Perhaps most importantly to some folks though...It has raptors that barge into your base, alongside some other curious wildlife.

Original review below, tho.

------

It freezes. Not so often, but in a strategically manner - usually when the colony is eventually somewhat auto-sustainable.
Often these freezes follows the delivery of a new notification. Wildlife herding e-mail notification -> freeze. Colonist haiku e-mail -> freeze. And so on.
In addition, colonists are almost always stupid. AI, for instance, cannot even figure out how to extinguish a wild fire in Workshop, providing plenty supplies of water.
And if you lost your only IMP prior to build the 3D printer, because it mined a Lava source while expanding buildable area of your base, you've lost the game.
I know, most of the issues that I'm having can be filed under some Bugtracker platform or something like that and fixed.
I know, give this game some more time to develop, and it can be awesome.
I know, we're talking about (yet another) Early Access title. That has got potential. You know, a Ferrari chassis has the potential to become a badass Ferrari. But with a poor engine, tires, electronics and so on, we can have a Laika resembling a Ferrari, which is definitely *not* what I'm wet dreaming about.
I think that even on sale it's a bit overpriced, taking also in account that this game need more fans and sponsors to grow, so the more people you reach, the more visibility you gain, the more future buyers you can expect to harvest. Yes, 10 € on sale doesn't seems much - 5 € here, 7 € there, 10 € up, 15 € down... sum that money to the taxes... and you must eat, don't you? And so that ""only 10 €"" obtain a more heavy meaning when talking about household economy.

To sum it up, this game is an EA, of course, and it's got potential (that phrase must be some sort of Steam meme) to become Great Again, but for me, and for now, it's a no-go. I'm going to apply for a refund and I shall buy it again, even at full price if it's worthy, when some more of that famous ""potential"" is concretized.",1530101622,1652564074,True,0,0,0.517241418361663818,2,True,False,True,False,,,

Negativ:
- Die GUI ist grauenhaft .. wirklich grauenhaft..
- Die KI der Siedler ist katastrophal. 99.9 % aller Tode wären vermeidbar, wenn Deine Siedler einfach mal was sinnvolles tun würden aber nein obwohl Du Tonnen an Nahrung hast kommen sie nicht auf die Idee mal was zu essen oder das Gegenteil sie umarmen sich lieber und stehen dumm in der Gegend rum anstatt mal die Pflanzen zu ernten oder zu verarbeiten.
- Sagte ich schon die GUI ist grauenhaft ? 
- Sinnvolle neue Ding/Features brauchen ewig um ins Spiel zu kommen, im Moment wird gerade mal ein bisschen hübsch gemacht.
- Gerade für neue Spieler sind die ersten Spielstarts extrem frustrierend, die Startressourcen sind viel zu knapp .. man muss ziemlich genau wissen was man tut sonst hat man schnell keine Nahrung mehr und es heißt game over.
- Man kann nur sehr indirekt Befehle an die Siedler geben.. erkennt man das es beispielsweise einen Engpass gibt weil sich die Siedler um gewisse Dinge einfach nicht kümmern kann man nur wenig machen um den Siedlern einen Klaps zu geben. Meist bleibt einem nicht viel übrig als alles andere ab zu schalten damit mal jemand langsam in Richtung Problemzone geht, häufig hilft das aber auch nicht und die Siedler stehen wieder nur dum rum oder laufen hin und her anstatt wichtige Ressourcen zu bauen/einzusammeln. Beim Raumbau/Möbelbau kann man Dinge mit hoher Prio versehen, was aber nur begrenzt hilft.
- Feedback der Siedler bekommt man durch eine Art SMS .. diese nett gemeinten IC Nachrichten, sollen wohl RP-Feeling aufkommen lassen, gehen einen nach kurzen aber unglaublich auch den Sack und man klickt sie einfach nur noch weg, gerne mal eine wichtige dabei ignorierend.

Positiv:
- Nette Idee.. viel Potential
- Der Entwickler ist aktiv im Forum .. und versucht zu helfen. (Zumindest hat er es bis vor ca. 1 Jahr.)
- Sci-Fi
- ääähh viel Potential ?

…

btw.. ich hatte einige nette Gespräche via Forum mit dem Entwickler und alle meine Anmerkungen sind vom Entwickler immer vernünftig kommentiert worden… aber trotzdem glaube ich einfach, das er sich total übernommen hat. Alle meine aufgezeigten Probleme sind immer noch mehr oder weniger im Spiel. Das Problem mit der KI bekommt er trotz endlosem herumgewerkeln einfach nicht in den Griff.. und das killt wirklich jeglichen Spielspaß.

Ich möchte nichts böses unterstellen, aber schaue ich mir die letzten Erweiterungen/Patches an glaube ich das Spiel ist im Zombiepflegezustand angekommen.

I have tried and tried with this game through bugs and crashes and more. It is such a creative, fun and brilliant idea but its just not there in the gameplay. I find myself turning this off after an hour at a time because I get too frustrated. You have no direct control over your 'settlers' so you simply tell them what to build and where. Unfortunately you will find a group of 8 people that are starving to death would rather run around repairing items (even when you have an automated repair bot) than building places to grow seeds, cultivate them and then cook them. They will have beds but die of fatigue. They are tired but refuse to build couches to rest. This on its own is not a game breaker, however, the way you call in drop pods of a random number of new 'settlers' after specific time frames (and sometimes never again) means that you are losing three settlers because they wouldnt prioritise correctly but only one new settler drops in. You must then wait another ten minutes before calling in new settlers and again this is random so you may get one you may get four who knows. For this whole length of time you have two fewer workers which seems to mean the priorities fall further down the list. Add to this the fact some lose heart (mainly because they work backwards) so they wonder off into the wild to die and you end up never gaining additional workers, so the important things you need done, but your colonists refuse to do unless they have NOTHING else to do (that includes stuff you dont allocate), never get done, its drop pod, die or wander away, repeat, so you cannot advance your colony.

Though it is still in early access, and is UNFINISHED, it's a great concept and Simon has been making great progress over the years (which is not something you can say for a lot of early access titles!). 

The game is starting to become a true, working game at this point, and it's a joy to play! Though it did need a bit of polish for a while, which is possibly why the steam reviews are surprisingly low, it's not nearly as unpolished as it was before and many of the main game mechanics are now set. 

Worth a try if you like colony simulation, it has a TON of character and personality, and it's really well done for an indie! I think the majority of the negative reviews are from the older days when it was really an alpha. Figuring out how the gameplay works was a challenge because back then there was no tutorial or anything, and it would crash. Now crashes are mostly nonexistent and there is a tutorial, and the game mechanics are a lot less finnicky than they were (colonists act reasonably and follow orders assuming they can complete them). He's added tons of details and even a little floor polishing robot to cleanup colonist footprints!

Totally worth checking out, don't let the reviews turn you away, but be aware, it isn't finished yet, and you're buying an alpha. Don't expect it to have all of it's Campaign and mechanics fleshed out yet.

If you don't absolutely love base building games get this one on sale.



Early access review below

I keep trying and I keep crying....

Things that need to be improved before I will endorse this
1. AI: you know it, we know it, the AI is just bad. Hire someone that knows what they are doing or get some community members to help. This happens --> person gets out of the capsule and starves to death when there is a whole room of food waiting to be harvested.
2. Environmental events. Non customized exploration has events happening almost every day and some times 2 to 3 times. there are way to many events firing off. 
3. Maintenance is extreme. AI shouldn't have to maintain every item every darn day. it takes like 5 repair bots for a tiny little base and humans are still repairing stuff. 
4. Research should have some ability to focus it.
5. Depression and suicide. I had 3 humans walk off into the wilderness on like day 3 and then lost 2 more people trying to get their bodies back. If someone is going to do something like that there should be time for emergency medical response to save them. 
6. Careers. There should be a way to assign people to certain tasks. I got a guy who is good at constructing stuff spending all his time playing with the trees. This would be handled by something in the command room
7. Priority of objects. Double clicking on things helps when it doesn't make you pick the object up and then have to replace it. There is a better way. Click on a button on the interface called priorities and set a numerical number of priority to the object.

There seems to be no agency, no control and no means of actually getting anything done. Player Information in Maia is one of the worst I've ever seen. I know how to place rooms, and what I would 'like' built. That is literally it. Maybe it works perfectly for the fanatic fanbase (that i'm sure exists and will rage at this) but again, I wouldn't know. There is zero information given to the player ingame as to HOW to build anything. It took some effort but mining was simple to figure out. So clearing rooms was easy, and placing rooms is simple. Unfortunately because of how aweful the building system is, it's just as easy to accidentally destroy your rooms, instantaniously mind. There is a long drawn out process to build a room, yet you can clear and undo everything you've done in one miss-click. Every time I come back to this, I had forgotten why I disliked it. Every time I give it another chance, I put it down within 20 minutes of attempts.  To put an emphysis on this, I wasn't able to get colonists to build the ONE THING THEY NEED to survive the first 5 minutes. They all die from hypothermia, and refuse to build a single heater. This is the massive drawback to a survival game where you have zero control over the people. A game that does this, and attempts to make something no one likes work desperately needs perfect AI, easy to use controls, a gameplay loop that can be understood quickly, and mechanics that work together very neatly, while also being complex enough to justify having zero control over your people.

You don't control your colonists directly and you can't change the world yourself, you place orders which your staff or robots will carry out. Robots are robots and get to work as soon as they realise there's a job waiting but colonists have needs and might not rush off to build immediately so your job is to plan the base so that colonists don't have to spend all day looking after themselves.
Your first bases will die horribly while you figure out what needs building ASAP and what can wait but once you've got the hang of setting up a self-sufficient base you can stop babysitting your colonists and start expanding or experimenting with rooms. Or decorating.
There's a research system to figure out once you've done that with a bunch of nice upgrades to unlock as well but once I've built and researched everything I lose interest in that base and restart - there's not really much to do at that point besides exploring or expanding just for the sake of it and every sandbox has to end somewhere.

I have a lot of sympathy for that, and viewing it through that prism helps me see past some of the more glaring issues.

The game is essentially a Dungeon Keeper-style simulator set in space, where you are a administrator rather than an evil wizard overlord. You carve out rooms, place objects in said rooms, and the colonists do their thing with what you provide. The strategy is in when and where you place rooms and objects, and it's good fun.

The game is not easy at the start, particularly as the tutorial doesn't linger long on some key elements. It took me several plays just to realise some core gameplay elements, too, like the importance of having the smelter and the robot manufacturer early, as well as power and space heaters, but that may just be me. (I lost many a colonist to hypothermia. Good times.)

To my mind, given I haven't found any major game-ending bugs, the issues are with the UIX and the colonist AI.

The UI feels sluggish, which is irritating to begin with, but you do get used to it. That's not a big issue.

The colonist AI, however, is more problematic. Because there's no way of directing individual colonists, you are completely at the mercy of the AI. And it has no mercy. It will send your colonists off to do things you would consider very low priority over things that are litterally life-saving. That's a much bigger issue, as several hours of game can be ruined by a colonist taking a stroll outside while fires rage and fellow colonists suffocate.

THE BAD

Bad UI all around.
Lacks sounds 
The sims ai is very bad,they will not delete things or build things for hours(real TIME if ever) and other problems.I could not get these ppl to delete a bird feeder in the middle of the floor for 15 hours,and they still have not done it,and there is nothing else to do but make food,and yet they are just jogging and studder running? around the base like its going to h3ll.lol

Very bare bones with things to place in rooms,very bland and basic for 5 years of EA.

The one that made me laugh was the Command room, and only a  map table is used in it.made me laugh like what no coms,no back up stuff,nadda. POINT?

The sims look the same, very similar even in their clothes.and jog and stop,jog and stop as their walking animation,its horrid.
When sims die,if ever,you just push a button and Magic another capsule drops from space,earth or some station you have no contact with,but its safe to drop on in!!
There is a cap on ppl you can have i assume,cause i have around 12 and i can't push that button anymore...

The simulation of the sims is very dull NO sounds at all

Lacks everything needed to know the people,their moods,etc,also lacks basic suppy tables. You do have a roster that you can hover over but this is another bad UI thing,,but its just names and their basic skill set as if their skills matter.Also this roster is a bad placement for what it needs to be.No needs listed,nothing like hunger,water etc...the stuff you need to know.

No build costs,or know what it takes to make something,it just smelts something then they build it.weird cause the metals have all this info on them that is a total waste of time to read and its funny,like 10% co2 or 50% etc..for what? lol its just bad

You have a storage room that will have tons of metals and they will not use it,and you will need to dig more and more just to get the AI working building what you placed and they will never use the metals all over the floor or in the hoppers..
 Can't tell if they are happy or sad or care,all they do is have a body sweat and temp reading on them.
Lacks animations.
The gfx for this game do not fit it,its hard to explain,but it looks like a realistic vibe,but it does not play that way.

Msg spam and pop ups while playing the game is so past annoying its hard to get past that alone.
The sims just jog around and sometimes will hug each other in the most crazy of places leading to their deaths sometimes,Bad AI. Setting up a base on some horrid planet would take skills,effort and dedication not hugs and non stop jogging,just does not fit the game type its weird.

Also there is a voice of the base telling you warnings and such,where does this voice come from? the Command room? NOPE...out of thin air.

Found it to be very boring after a few hours
So they make food,but you need to keep placing ration boxes for them to build or they will not eat the food they made...weird.
Nothing good to say about this game other then it looks good as in the base art and assests.
To me this game is someones college class project.

These devs tryed to make the game seem like its so deep with skills for the sims,but you can pick the worst ones,like a game programer and set up a wind turbine,etc,so its just for what i call milking EA updates.

Very slow dev team milking EA for sure. Games been in EA for years and what looks to me like it was when i first seen it years ago on youtube with the same stuff in it that it had years ago.You can go see for yourself.

SO what updates? The same ones you see from devs who have no clear goals to the game and what it can be and what it is , will not just move on and take it like a man,this game is a fail and they as a team do not have the skill set to make this game into what ever it was when they first dreamed when starting it and if this is it,well imo should be removed from steam... 100% this game will be left for dead for sure,you can already tell just by playing a few of these types of games and this one stands out for all the wrong reasons. Like rimworld,murcury fallen,space colony etc,there is a few more out there,even games like hearthstone,space base df9 and others on my list,this one is the worst one so far.

I would say make a few saves,and often just in case CTD's i played 4 games for 15+hrs or so and  crashed often.

Worth it on sale,not worth full price as it is a bit annoying with msg spam like i never seen before,repeat msgs by the dozens the whole time you are playing,to the point you stop looking at them and deleting them. non stop and other weird things like the need to place objects like a thermo gen next to an air lock thats next to your base wall etc.

Overall i would say wait on this one as it imo is never going to be anything but a temp and farming sim with no sounds straight up cash grab for sure,and that kinda sucks.

The sims are very basic and not much to see other then them jog around ....pretty blah.

Would be cool if it was the next rimworld or a clone of another EA game called Murcury fallen but this game does not even come close to the most basic of tasks in those game for around the same price and been in EA for longer. Heck you can buy space colony for like 5 bucks and it was made 20 years ago and is better then this by miles on end.nuff said

This game for what its got feels very empty and lacking in every way you can think,but it does look good,and i think that is the Con.

6 for gfx
0 for sounds
3 for music-cause i dont listen to game music.
4 for effort.
10 for concept

But if you get it super cheap like i did,then go for it. but its a pretty basic bland colony sim. I hope this game does become something cause it looks cool,but 4 or 5 years in EA and its still looking like the first year...prolly not.

Still gonna play a bit more on the other map types,so far the game is just overall boring and maybe need to watch a movie like Moon or something to get in the mood to boot this POS up

The good.

The game is fully playable.  Rare crashes - and for those that experience - a dev who is extremely responsive / quick to fix if it's something on his end.

It's hard.  Not least because the AI is; on occasion, still a bit screwey - but it's basically 90% baked now so it's totally workable.  The hardness is just that.  It's a hard game.  Building a colony on a remote planet with only 4 people probably would be right.

You'll die.  You'll die again.  Sometimes it will be bad luck. Sometimes it will be a gameplay mechanic you need to learn.  Sometimes it'll just be a bad spawn (you'll soon learn to recognise the good ones!)


The bad

Very little.  it's a one man dev but the progress is steady if not light speed.  But updates come regularly.  Are properly tested. There is a dev / experimental branch for those inclined.  The dev Simon is very responsive - there is a good community of loyal players who have played multiple builds and provide constructive feedback.   Why is that bad.  Well it's small and it's slow.  And like everyone of course I'm impatient.  So the bad isn't too bad at all.

Overall.

It's an early access game with a committed developer; a clear and achievable roadmap and steady progress towards a fully baked game.  At the moment it's fully playable across multiple plarforms and configs and for those rare ocassions where a new player has a hardware issue - the dev is quick to work to resolve.  

A game that only got made becaues of Kickstarter and Early Access and which will benefit from your investment.  It's not 100% - I'd say a good 70% though and very playable and enjoyable.

(Steam says I've played 150 odd hours but that's a significant undeestimate. Some builds don't seem to trigger Steam's clock and streaming locally - which I do all the time - never counts towards play time.  It's probably more like 400 hours and therefore worth every penny of what I paid !)",1508959220,1508959220,True,14,1,0.636127352714538574,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I really enjoy this game. Well, I can't really call it a game yet. It has what feels to me around 97% of a complete game. Keep in mind that this is early access. That said, I have been on this ride for quite some time now. It has constantly been updated and with each release makes big progress. Dev is active on forums and as far as i can tell and have seen, listens to the community and tweaks the game accordingly. If you like builder/sim games (Evil Genius) this game is up your ally. If you also like to support early access this is your game.

Im not going to list the pros out, but there are many.
Here are the cons as far as playablilty:
Tooltip is still sloppy (trouble setting priority, sometimes deletes item and puts tooltip into placement mode)
AI still needs some work
Build priority control is basically non existent
People die and get stuck under items and in walls
Doors can be a pain to get completed
Tutorial needs work (would help with learning hot keys and such)
Additional airlocks can be difficult to place if not done just so
Tend to have a hard time having native animals around 

Thats about all I can think of that has bothered me or caused me problems. In no way do any of those things make the game unplayable. Just can be annoying from time to time as the dev brushes them up and polishes them. I have played this so far 79 hours. I have enjoyed every one of them.

If Sci-Fi is your thing and you enjoy simulation/builders, get this game and help support the dev. We are not far from a jewel.

[i] March 25, 2020[/i]
Well, I still like it. 

I just spent several hours having another play through (Is the metric [i]really[/i] 7 hours?!). Good times. I made it to day 46 before deciding to begin writing. Everything about the controls came back to me or was in the in-game help. I didn't play the tutorial.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] The graphics, being stylized along the lines of 1970's / 80's British sci-fi design, are still enjoyable
[*] The humor is unmistakably British and dry
[*] The game tempo is relaxed. Real relaxed. I mean, people die and you're suddenly General Melchett.
     [list]
     [*] Dehydration? It's a tough swallow, what.
     [*] Exhaustion? Went flat out, did she?
     [*] Explosive concussion? Oh, blast!
     [/list]
[*] Haiku, all of them
[*] Pleasure is in the details. Read the descriptions. Read the emails.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] Game controls. Maia went its own way on the user interface. It's there. It's usable. But, it's not well documented. By the way....
     [list]
      [*] [i]alt+mouse movement[/i] is the alternative to [i]middle mouse button[/i] to adjust the camera angle
      [*] [i]middle mouse button[/i] click de-|prioritizes building the object
     [/list]
[*] More than one airlock is begging for trouble
[*] Sometimes a restart of the program is needed to get the colonists going again
[*] James Cameron isn't British, so Sarah Conner never appears when we need her (You can still channel Kyle Reese and [i]blast[/i] those metal mothers into junk)
[/list]

[b]Random thoughts:[/b]
For longer term enjoyment, treat working with the AI, especially in consideration of pathing / object placement as goal, instead of regarding pathing as a shortcoming. Still, Pathing, you've come a long way, baby!

On the topic of enjoyment. It's really better to lean toward [i]Black Adder[/i] expectations of outcomes as opposed to [i]True Lies[/i] when playing the game; cynical vs. all the goodguys live. 

If I recall correctly, I usually managed to kill off my first colonist in a couple of days. With the play-through that I used for this Review, it was day 36 or so, and, given that none of the other colonists could be bothered to help, Q. Hanson probably wasn't such a great loss to the mission. 

Were I to make an effort to keep canno....colonists alive, I would regularly check them via the colonist focus in the lower left corner, to ensure that they hadn't exited an animation/interaction into a wall or object, and take action to ensure they wouldn't await their death with a stiff upper lip. I'd also apply the concept that the less objects against the walls is more death-free gameplay.

[i]Original Review[/i]
[i]Sep 25, 2017[/i]

I've been playing this game for a long time now, over the years. It's getting better, but I enjoy it for more than the gameplay. If you want to know about gameplay and the genre, etc. You may be better served reading a different review. Know that the game is early access. It is improving, with bugs being squashed, game mechanics being tweaked, and new aspects being introduced.

I became aware of slow TV via Norwegian programming. Slow TV programs run for hours sometimes even tens of hours, showing a task in its entirety, like the preparation and burning of a log fire. The programming shows the actual effort that goes into creating things. There's no montage to steal that appreciation for the real effort, which yields the result and how that effort contributes to the satisfaction in the well done job.

Maia has held my interest in a similar way. On the other hand, Maia sometimes feels like an Advent calendar. I open it up, get a treat and go away, returning when it's time to open the next box. 

Observing the steady progress and effort put out by Simon Roth has made the game rich for me. I watch the pathing today and know that Simon spent significant effort to improve it. At the start of each game, I wonder how food consumption will proceed, because it's been tweaked over and over in the effort to find the right balance. I take direct control of the utility robot with its laser welder then head off to the livestock room for some culling, and anticipate the day that the oxygen draining chicken parades are no more.

Simon is a responsive developer, but is firmly set on his vision of Maia. He interacts with the community, taking ideas, offering explanations, and generally demonstrating his interest in what people have to say. If a developer version of the game goes south, I'm used to his quick action to restore the game to a playable state.

Owning Maia is contributing to a Work. What kind of Work might be up for debate, but that Simon Roth has set out to create a Work is unquestionable. Indie gaming has seen its share of failures. Developers throwing up their hands and calling whatever was in front of them ""good enough"". For years Simon has steadily plodded along, singlehandedly developing his concept. I applaud that effort. From the outside it's like watching concert music being composed with various movements being created in a fit of inspiration and then being worked over to complement each other. Frankly, I can't wait to see this Opus finished.

The fact is that this game has held my attention more than any other purchase I've made. Heck, I've almost invested 3 working months of time in gameplay.",1506372794,1585277063,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False,False,,,

I am playing the 0.63 release. The game has come along and is in a playable state. There are some balancing issues but nothing eggregious. I feel like the game could be a bit harder. I think you get through the early game quite fast and then it slows to a crawl as you wait for your colonists to build the things they let you know via email. 

The email system could be cleaned up some, as sometimes the emails open on there own, and you have to close them. Other times you see an email that has not been opened. As you read the emails and respond to them, and to other crises around the colony, you decide what should be built and order it. Then you sit and wait until your colonists get around to it. 

I am not sure but I think the smelter works automatically though sometimes you check it and as soon as you hover over it it starts working. I would like a dialog of the smelter so you always know what state it's in.

BUG:The 3D printer can be placed to close to a wall and the new IMPs cannont get of from between the wall and the printer. This last item I will report to the devs. 

WANTS:I would like to see the walls bias out of view as you mouse over them so you can more easily see what you're working on in the room.

Indeed, it's not a ""god game"", your role is to give the priorities of the station through make/build/repair/expand/research commands. However, the game has a built-in life simulation, which means your colonist need to eat/sleep/socialise and also to take care of your base (repairing, handling food growth, food making, dealing with water supplies, etc.). Moreover, they will send you e-mails explaining their needs and state of mind, that you have to take into consideration.

Therefore, and I think this point is the biggest part and also the most complex part of the game, you really have to understand and to manage people in a station instead of only the station as a structure. 

And, I think, this is where the game really shines. It took time, for a player, to really understand how everything works  but in the end it's really addictive and pleasant to watch everything working.

Bought this game a couple of years back and put it away since I could not figure the starting out...lousy instructions folks. A few days ago, I decided to try again and so much easier. I've played about 3 or 4 days now and enjoying myself. After several bouts of absolute frustration I am now at day 57 with 12 colonists. 

Hydroponics was lousy so I bypassed it by doing animal containment and living quarters before it. Also built more ration packs at the beginning of the game (and dev? how did I do that with no supplies?) then brought in another load of colonists. After hitting the more colonists button I built my table, the wind turbine, atmosphere thingee, flywheel energy thingee, and then waited a bit while they did it all. More energy producers, the smelter, and a bed and food table, then went for hydroponics after all that. However, if you don't have both a food table and ration packs, someone's gonna starve. You won't be perfectly balanced until you get that 2nd table.

I noticed that some games have a lot of hypochondriacs after I create medbay. Though I still have not figured out how to cure their awful blues. I think maybe lighting so still experimenting. If don't have a lot of that, then I get more broken bones that you would believe. Like 4 broken arms for the same person, all on the same day. lol. Jeez dev. I don't think anyone would break their arm 4 times.

All in all, I enjoyed the game once I actually got started. As I believe I said, it's frustrating. Especially when everyone dies and you don't have a clue as to why except they were asphyxiated. My theory is poison gas from a just opened area but I don't know if that's even in the game. Dev. consider that for difficulty = insane. I'm a well-aged lady here....don't you dare say old... so sometimes all the sounds overlapping the warnings is often hard to decipher. Also my people keep telling me about an alarm bell that is either zen or insanity depending on the colonist. On a hunt to find it....sigh. All in all, it's fun!

Unfortunately, I can only give limited gameplay reviews, as the engine and various other failings have hindered my access to the actual game. 

First and foremost: Fullscreen mode scaled to screen size! How can I emphasize this enough? Every game scales the screen size to the edges of the monitor, and adjusts its resolution within these limits. But not Maia... Heaven help you if you toggle fullscreen, as the menu, along with 75% of the game's interface, will be shoved out of your view, leaving you to desperately try to find a way to get it back. But why would you need fullscreen in the first place? It is a convenience, truly, but I enjoy being able to scroll my view down in the game, a luxury that is denied for those of you who cannot properly scale the game's interface on full screen. 

NOTE: I may retract this portion of my review in the event that I purchase a 5 foot screen.

Second, optomization. For the love of all that is holy, optomize this game! My top-of-the-line computer should not be choking or lagging the instant I activate 2X antialiasing. And to add on to that thought, why am I forced to ramp up the graphics settings in order to get back to ""none""? Another seemingly nit-picky feature that has ended me in a CTD because I had to go up to maximum antialiasing to get to none. The game panicked at what appeared to be a demand for unreasonable graphics and immediately jumped off of a bridge. So perhaps the ability to simply select lower graphics settings without testing the strain on your engine?

Third, and I know I'm going to get crapped on for this, fix the OS X port! Yes, I became so frustrated trying to make this game work on windows that I resorted to an iMac to come from another angle. I know the saying ""nobody games on a mac"" and apparently, the development team here has taken that to heart. Their OS X version of this game doesn't even finish loading the main screen before crashing into a heaping pile of wasted code. If you're going to sell a product for a different platform, so help me God, it is on you to make sure that it at least works! Anything less, is theft, plain and simple. 

Fourth, the AI needs some serious love. For the time I was able to play, my colonists watched as two atmosphere generators broke down and a third caught on fire. They started crying instead of worrying that the air was going to run out if they didn't jump to action. Two of them chose to starve to death instead of going to eat, and a second one kept sleeping, rather than do her job. Yes, I'm talking about you, K. Smith, you lazy freeloader! Nobody wanted you in this colony anyway! 


TL;DR, 
Don't buy this game until they fix their graphical interface to something actually usable. Don't buy this game until the AI is less pathetic. And DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU OWN A MAC!!

So your colonists are pretty much doomed to starvation, or hypothermia or death due to fatigue as they won't do any of the things you want them to do. 


You also can't really react to all the emergencies and warnings that you are given because they will simply keep warning you of low temperatures at a certain room but since the colonists won't build the heaters you asked them to, they will freeze to death.

But! The reason why I originally did not recommend this game is still there. The first few days of the game are still a black box, with only one path forward to survive. I hypothesize that the difference between life or death can measured in how many steps the colonists must take to get between rooms. That’s harsh for the first few minutes of the game! In the end I never did solve this initial hurdle, but had to watch and copy the developer’s video blog.

I almost wish that the developer would leave the priority queue logging messages in so i could figure out where they are getting stuck and keep my colony alive long enough to see what the game is about.

yes the UI is to be tweaked and eased
yes there are lots of bugs (some can be worked around for now)
yes there is not much to do once your colony is up and running

but come on guys, this is a small crew working on a quite huge poroject (some patience is a must!). look on the details, look on a witty description of things and items ingame. this requires both time and quite a character. plus the dev is kinda sexy and funny and i like to follow his videos on youtube. 

early access game will always be a bit sketchy and some games move forwards slower than others. that's a risk we all take when we purchase EAG but there is no need going on a rampage about bugs and bad UI. just deliver them to the dev and wait patiently for them to bi fixed. EAG is all about being somewhat a tester of a game and helping devs to make it better. 

so STFU and go play some more hours of the game before commenting about how bad the game is. 1 hour gametime is only enough to kill all your colonists from a hypothermia, not to grasp the gist of the game. ;-)

After noticing the multitude of patches and the developer commenting on how many fixes he has pushed lately I thought to give it another shot. No crashes thankfully. Started off very promising, colonists actually build stuff now (!) and for quite some time I was considering finally swapping to a positive review. Unfortunately I can't quite yet and here's why:

I still had a colonist die of dehydration mere feet from barrels containing hundreds of litres of water. No colonist attempted to save her or move her corpse afterwards despite having a corpse storage unit.

My airlock randomly disappeared at one point and everyone died.

People have just walked through walls to escape rooms somehow and yet still had some sort of emotional breakdown, I have no idea why anything that happens in this game actually happens.

My colonist magicked himself outside without a suit and promptly died.

It takes a colonist thirteen(!!!) seconds to pick up building materials from a smelter after they're finished. Thirteen seconds from the moment they arrive at the machine to the moment they leave.

We're really getting there though and I can (and have for other games) overlook some hefty bugs and issues, but there's just so many gamebreaking issues here. I actually enjoyed myself here and there though and didn't get pissed off at any point so there's that.

Edit as of V0.65:
Thought I'd try again. Started off promising, colonists didn't sit and die for no reason, furniture actually did the bare minimum basic functions for which I built them but then it crashed. Repeatedly. I tried four different games, every one crashed. This game hasn't earnt any more of my time than that.

Edit as of V0.62:
I was very glad to see version 0.62 release, it promised some very interesting features plus a great performance boost which I was looking forward to. Unfortunately this version has rendered the game ever more buggy than before. Since the patch I've had the main menu hang on aborting a mission, the cursor disappears which makes me have to Task Manager the game closed then reopen it. 

I've had mining orders persist between attempts at levels, i.e. I start the mission Cassiopeia, place some mining orders, inevitably get screwed and then re-start only for the mining orders to still exist from previous attempts. 

It now appears possible when directly controlling the IMP to walk too close to a wall causing him to get pulled in and either destroyed or rendered unable to move or work meaning the end of the game if it's your only one, ruining a nigh essential feature as the IMP AI prioritises work so poorly it's easier to do it myself.

After another few hours in V0.62 I have come to the conclusion that he may as well have not added anything. In my experience, I still am unable to get anywhere near far enough into the game to even see my first chicken hatch or potato crop, let alone be invaded by herds of Velociraptor pidgeons. The more I try to like this game the more jaded I become.

Original Review(0.61):
It's not often I write reviews, particularly negative ones, generally speaking it's not worth the effort but for Maia I will make an exception. I bought Maia a number of years ago and no, I'm not upset by the lack of progress, the issue here is I have yet to get to find out how much is even possible within the game. I cant get past the first few days, despite following the quick-start guide to the letter. Everyone that makes suggestions as to what to do to progress makes the assumption that if I issue an order to my colonists, they will actually do it. Unfortunately they are so abominably stupid that nothing ever gets done. The first few things take an incredibly long time but do eventually get done. My first workshop, Table, Drill and so on. I build a smelter and an atmosphere generator and mine minerals and what have you but that's about as far as I get. I'll write the issues I have in a list format.

Colonists stop building stuff. I'll have building materials lining the walls in the storage room and they will do nothing at all. Occasionally they may fiddle with the table for a bit before continuing their exercise in inadequacy. 

Colonists are stupid to the point of having four rooms to stand in, three of which are a comfortable temperature with a dedicated atmosphere generator in each one, they will choose to stand in the empty room that is cold enough to give them hypothermia even though it is unfurnished and has a construction order in it for stuff that they will not build.

Certain objects the colonists never build. I've tried queueing up vents, space heaters etc, which never get done even if there is only a single order given at that moment, there is plenty of material and they are all walking around faffing about. 

On the rare occasion where a colonist decides to actually do something (it's generally not what I wanted them to do) it takes so abominably long for them to get it done that it's barely worth doing at all. 

I tried extremely hard to like Maia, I really did but my god, I've never had a game make me so damn angry at the idiocy on display by the colonists. 

I'll delete this review if the issues are fixed or I am proven wrong. 

Edit: I've given it another few hours and frankly I think I was too generous the first time around. People just start dying within the first two days for stupid reasons. Starving with plenty of food, dehydration despite hundreds of litres of water, freezing to death despite having warm rooms to stand in. Broken and buggy mess. I still want to like it but there are some ridiculous design decisions here even past the extremely ""early access"" colonist AI. Why do walls not connect with the stone?

Maia *is not* a game where you can micro-manage people, fiddle with spreadsheets and build queues.

Maia *is* a game where you try to build a base with (and for) a bunch of colonists that will allow them to survive on a hostile alien world. The colonists handle (most) prioritisation of tasks, they handle what they will and will not build, they handle most of their needs; the game is working out what rooms or equipment they need to fulfill those needs and explore the world they have landed on, without dying.

The lack of build queues is not a bug, the lack of spreadsheets containing task prioritisations and other ways to fiddle is not a bug. The developer has (rightly) decided these things exist in other games to patch over bad AI and we have just normalised them. In software development these things are called 'leaky abstractions' and are not desirable.

It's been a long, hard slog to get the AI to the point where it works properly (AI is hard, BTW) and doesn't eventually do something dumb and kill itself, but with 0.61 I think we're at the point where it works pretty well.

The one big minus with this game seems to be usability: the game doesn't show the player what it is (note: I don't use the word 'explain' here), meaning users have the expectation of spreadsheets and tweaking, and the build menus are cumbersome and slow to use.

Maia is also working great for me on Linux (AMD/Mesa drivers). Simon Roth also is an alright bloke who's genuinely dedicated to finishing his game.

So previously I said that this game had some problems that needed to be solved before I could recommend it. Some of those problems have been fixed and the other major problem  I have can be fixed as well so I am gonna switch this to a recommendation

Previously my two main issues where the awkward way you selected things and the lack of feedback

The problem with the menu's has been fixed, mostly. Now when you scroll through the menu there is a little sidebar that shows you the list you are scrolling through. This makes it a lot easier to know how close you are to a given item. Not to mention making it easier to create a mental image of where things are relative to each other in the list. It also helps you figure out what things are in which list. I am still not a massive fan of this interface but it works well enough that I can live with it now. 

The problem with feedback has also been mostly fixed, the emails now tend to be more specific and easier to parse as you read them. This does help to point out problems without completely breaking the fiction. 

However the big problem I still have with the game comes down to the early game. When you start a new game you have a storage room and a airlock and that is pretty much it. There are a couple of things that you have to get built right away. A workshop, a solar panel or wind turbine and some atmo generators. 

These are things that are critical to surviving but I have had to restart multiple times now because it feels like if you don't do things in a very specific order in a very short span of time you are screwed. This comes back to a problem I had which was that the people in the base don't seem to give a shit about themselves. 

They will stand around doing nothing when workshop tables are open and they are all freezing to death. You can set priority but it doesn't really seem to make a lot of difference. Being able to use the click and drag system that is used to move stuff around to tell a person to built a certain thing right now would be great. Basically just some way to force them to do something right away. I get you shouldn't have direct control but if in this fiction I am the commander of the base I should be able to shout at them to do things in some way.

Really my major problem is just how brutal the early game is. It would be nice to have a checklist that would get you to a basic state of the base. The tutorial doesn't really do this since it starts with a lot of basic stuff in place. In the main game just having a list that says something like ""Build X then build Y"" and so on would really help with the early game.",1492861514,1526563260,True,0,0,0.549027323722839355,1,False,False,True,False,,,

There is so much broken about the AI, it is unplayable. Colonists  will not do what you need them to to survive. The pace of development is an absolute crawl, and I would never have put the game out in the current state it's in unless it was free.

What this game does have: A wonderful atmosphere. Great sounds, looks, and a bit of British humor.

Barack Obama was president,  console gamer were buzzing about the upcoming Playstation 4, and a young Brit started a Kickstarter project inspired by Dungeon Keeper called Maia. It was a promising pitch - a game about controlling a colony with a 1970s British ""real"" sci-fi aesthetic. It seemed mighty ambitious for a solo developer, but I was younger, more idealistic and believed in Maia enough to pledge USD $11 on Kickstarter.

Fast-forward to 2017. Barack Obama is no longer president. Playstation 4 dominates the console market, Rimworld has show gamers how a procedurally generated storytelling, colony building game can work, and Maia is still a glorifed tech demo with no signs of becoming a real game most people would want to play.  The graphics are even more outdated than they were in 2012. The game is stil buggy and lack focus. More than any of that, there's just not much to it.

I have to hand it to Simon Roth.

yes, its an early acess game, but the core isue is..welll..
look, with this genre, the core cause of frustraition in the playerbase is the minion/colonist ai, as you have zero direct control over them.
in this case, its almost completely nonfunctional. while there IS a system for prioratising build orders, after an hour or so, its completely ignored, with colonists randomly assembling structures/furnature in whatever order they see fit (sometimes comitting suicide by ignoreing priority orders to build a hydorponic food farm or an air filter untill everyone is dead >.>), and they are incapable of basic behaviour SUCH AS SLEEPING,EATING OR DRINKING RELIABALLY as of 25/06/2017

i'll happily amend this review WHEN Simon is able to adress the AI issues, but..well. its been like this since it arrived on steam, with relatively small improvements, to some degree or other.


as a bit of an update, its gotten no better, arguabally even worse (some of the wildlife now has a chance to run at high speed into your base and eat ALL your rations less than 30 seconds into the game, and your colonists are more liekly to break down sobbing then follow an attack order.

they appear to consider comfort (beds ect) and random low-priority tasks a much higher priority than basic lifesupport (air scrubbers, air vents) and COMPLETELY IGNORE BUILD PRIORITY 50% of the time, have a high chance to set a microwave smelter on fire and die almost immediately the first time they ever use it (half the time comsuming all the oxygen in trhe air, due to their refusal to comply with oreders to build vents/scrubbers, anything involving hydroponics), are capable of starving to death while standing directly next to food/ literally refusing to take water from stockpiles and.....


look.Simon. you've done great on your own when you look at the task you've been working at.but.

you NEED to hire MORE coders.at LEAST one other person to assist with the project. you've been essentially spinning your wheels fruitlessly for the last several years, unable to get the ai to work reliabally (they still randomly get confused and stop moving/stall in an airlock till they starve/ die of dehydration)

and to be completely blunt, the state of the game is PATHETIC considering it has been on STEAm since 2013.

Unfortunately I can't recommend it.

I even tried playing without the tutorial, doing basic game starts without the tutorials guidance, and they all end the same way: my colonists freeze and suffocate while doing nothing to help themselves, no matter what is available to them. It's pretty boring, because the game pace is pretty slow, watching the colonists freeze to death.

These failed starts don't count the failed starts due to the clunky interface: you frequently end up unbuilding things that have been built, crucial doorways and room sections disappear with one false click, mislicked false starts on construction can't be cleaned up and started over.

Support now to increase its chances of reaching its very tangible potential.

First things first: it's an alpha build. Not a very early alpha - it already looks very good, the base game has a bunch of systems in it already - but not a polished and certainly not a balanced end-product.

The game is basically a dystopic, older vision of science fiction colony-building on an alien planet with cheekily British tones. To sell this game by its emotional air is mainly noting it's hilariously depressive tone. Everything is terrible: setting up a colony is not easy, and the human condition has so many requirements to retain the spark of life - your people will complain about being sad, tired, hurt, lonely, cold, hungry and thirsty, and then they will break down and die. Unless of course you manage to do your job.

Which, at the current time is more than just midly difficult. Here's where the alpha-ishness comes off heaviest. The balance is not just there yet, and the building-up-to-something-great is still coming up with bugs as games tend to when they're in their growing youth. Sometimes the game may deal you a foul hand by simply ruining the crucial piece of your initial setup, like caving in on your starter construction IMP robot just as you have spent your last building materials, leaving you to wonder who's doing the digging to get up some material production necessitated by your workshop attempting to construct the air processor to stop your folks from the good old freeze-and-choke of having no warmth and breathable air. Fair amount of my plays have been 10-20 minutes in to notice some calamity or unexplained AI non-co-operation to decide I'd rather start over than deal with the fresh hell that just ruined the current colonists' lives. And people dying off when colonizing a strange place is still OK, mind you, but some of these scenarios just flip over too many of the crucial pieces you need to have stuff progressing sensibly.

User-friendliness is not terrible, even at this alpha stage - having played some Dungeon Keeper or imitators will do you no harm to get the generic idea of how digging areas, building rooms and filling them with operational equipment works -  but the main mechanics are succinct and simple. You'll experiment a bit and learn a few things, browsing your available rooms and items and seeing through the mouse-over descriptions explain a couple things more. The tutorial is not a heavy chore, save for a few bugs at the time of writing this, that may confuse you when you are for instance ordered to build a room, but the tutorial step might not get checked and carry on if you didn't build a large enough room; something which will surely be corrected in improved instruction and polish soon enough.

All in all I got some bugs, some frustration out of confusion when I could not identify when colonists were not doing their tasks (were it an intermittent alpha AI bug, or was the colonist just too far gone in hunger and depression?), but for someone who looks up to building and growing an operation, nostalgizes about dungeonkeeper-alikes or maybe enjoys these sordid little histories that the game generates with these sorry folks trying to survive, there is a lot of promise in this one.

I'll be logging in a few feedbacks and a bug report soon and am looking forward to the day when I agree with the level of challenge as entertaining rather than frustrating when a few of my issues are being fixed in the coming versions - so far the developer communication and reactivity has given me nothing but trust for matters to proceed just so. Also, for whatever reason I keep getting pulled back in for a new try even though I feel the current build is just prone to quick failures with unclear or unfair situations in play. I'd love to get to the first play where I'll actually manage to ripen and harvest something from my hydroponics room before people starve to death or my mining robot collapses a lava flow onto itself and the colony.",1487803315,1487803315,True,4,0,0.559517323970794678,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I've played Maia for about 20 hours now, more than enough to have built myself a fully self-sustaining colony with all the bells and whistles, including the rooms that require certain levels of research, so I've seen pretty much all of the permutataions of gameplay you can get within the game.

It took me a while to get that Maia is a delicate balance between active user input (build orders, smelting stuff, etc) and watching the formidable AI systems run. However, once I understood this, my colony ran a lot better, was more productive, and I got a lot more out of gameplay. Another challenge is balancing the amount of activity. Unlike other sims, your colonists get tired and sick and dehydrated if you work them too hard, so you can't just set 4892438 build orders and go make some tea. On that note, I LOVE the level of detail - from temperatures reactive to whether an air vent system is on or off, to body heat of chickens altering room temperatures, to the relative humidity being affected by water condensing systems, to atmosphere quality being augmented by potted plants, to plants *literally* getting species-specific diseases like fungal rot and black spot... there is phenomenal detail in here that I struggle to understand at the best of times, but massively appreciate.

Another thing is that dev Roth is quite literally the King of the Easter Egg. Most people probably don't notice or read the descriptions and names of objects, but there are some real 'laugh out loud' examples of punning names that play very well within the cultural nexus of dry, dark British humour. There's also a brilliant sense of British understatement to the emails - instead of saying 'we're literally starving here, half-wit, build some food prep stations', they say wonderfully passive aggressive things like ""I hope this lack of X isn't another bureaucratic oversight."" Ah, the art of the strongly worded letter is strong in this game.

In terms of practical playability, the game is pretty easy to get the hang of; controls are intuitive, and the 'tabbing through' range of objects based on context rather than having to go through a sims-style full-scale menu system is great.

The fact that the game is still under development shouldn't put you off - it's fully fledged already, and the updates (like 0.60 adding colonist relationships... again, how the heck was this coded in?!) just add more levels of detail and interest to an already fully formed and extremely well-thought-out idea.

---

The most obvious problem is that there are no (reasonably functional) speed controls.  The game, as far as its UI will inform me, has exactly one speed, sloth.  People move like molasses and completing basic tasks takes ages.  And despite this pokey pace, you can't sit back and relax as you strategize as you would with other games in the genre because there's no real-time pause fuction - sure, there's an undocumented pause function if you hit the Pause Break key, but this can often crash the game.  The result is that you need to quickly queue up your commands, almost a bit like Starcraft but without the immediately obedient underlings or any of the good UI design that went into that game.

This is made worse by the awful controls - the game's framerate is still not as good as it should be so it's already not quite responsive enough on reasonable hardware, but inconsistent controls make planning out your base maddening.  When placing items, right click both returns you back to your regular cursor/interact mode [i]and[/i] removes items under your cursor, either queuing placed items for destruction or immediately removing what you just placed.  The result is a lot of frustration as you have to swipe away to an empty part of the map to safely right-click your way out, or risk misclicking with the flakey FPS when trying to click the menu item to swap out of item placement.

Placing rooms of course breaks this convention - right click will remove placed floors, but it does so immediately without any queuing so you can very easily cause messy problems that you'll then need your minions to slowly fix, and if you right click in an empty area you don't go back to Interact mode like you'd expect.

And Interact mode, where you can click on stuff and see information or view the station from the point of view of your colonists in first person (which is neat and even has a low-res camera feed filter), also doubles as your mining tool, so you'll frequently be mining things when you're just trying to click on a moving colonist.

Oh, and you have to do all this when it shakes the screen due to eathquakes, meteorites, and cave-ins, which are annoyingly frequent and make it hard to just control the game.

Then there's just the bizzare key placement.  Y and N are something you need to frequently hit, and I mean [i]frequently[/i], which is rather uncomfortatble since the game expects you to have a constant WASD grip.  The three main building tools - the aforementioned Interaction, Room, and Item modes - are bound to J, K, and L respectively.  These keys are nowhere near WASD where your fingers will be resting most of the time, while Z, X, and C right underneath remain unbound.  Why?  The keys are at least rebindable, though you'll have to spend a good amount of time figuring out what keys are important and which are pointless from experience.  The tutorial doesn't even bother telling you want the keys are, and the UI doesn't bother listing the keybind either on its icons.

These may seem like small nitpicks, but bad controls combined with time pressure in what's usually a more methodical genre make for an incredibly frustrating experience.

---

And then we get into the typical EA problems.

The game provides very little feedback on why your colonists aren't doing what they need to do.  I can have three full barrels of water and water fountains everywhere, yet my colonists will mysteriously die of dehydration regardless.  Hopefully this eventually changes, but for now it's complete guesswork as to what's wrong.  In a good Dwarf Fortress-like game you don't always know immediately what little cog in your operation is causing a holdup, but at the very least you have tools at your disposal to figure out what's going on.  Those tools apparently don't exist yet, mousing over a colonist gives some physical information but you can't get useful stuff like the last letter they wrote or recent complaints or anything like that, instead forcing you to dig through the often busy feed (while the game is still running in real time, mind you).  And since the game is buggy, you can't ever feel confident that you're losing because you messed up, you're always wondering if the AI is just being bad and not doing obvious things like eating when it's hungry.

Then there's the lack of content, bugs, and general unfinished state of the game that you'd expect out of an EA title.  Yeah, it's nothing shocking, but it's nothing special either that really demands your money now like Kerbal Space Program or Darkest Dungeons or Space Engineers.  Updates happen, but they sure as hell take their time.  This game's been in EA for a long time and it still feels like it has a long way to go.

~~~

The game simply isn't ready for your money.  I want to love the game so much and it feels like in two years maybe there will be a game worth playing, but as it is now it's just a really pretty piece of junk compared to other Dorflikes like Dwarf Fortress, Prison Architect, or even other EA games like Stonehearth.  It's not Spacebase-DF9 levels of terrible, there aren't unexplainable oxygen leaks that eventually kill everyone with no further promises to improve, but it just gets so many little things wrong that it can't hold a candle to a game like Banished.

It's fun, 16+ hours in and looking forward to the next update.  If you are looking for a polished game, with no bugs this is not the game for you, but worth putting on  your follow list.

Pros: engaging idea, and appeals to my strategy sense.  I like the integration of AI in terms of survival, and building.

Cons: The build priority of the colonist is a bit wonkers, and the tools to set priority don't always work.  At times (without cheats) you're at the mercy of what ever the colonist think should be done first.  Often you will find a colonist build a new facility only to have the build the wrong door first, and without additional raw building materials they will dye of hypothermia.

That being said I like it, I like it a lot.  I have played several Early Access games and this is one that I will follow regularly.

The improvements that are made in each monthly update, have been a great and very consistantly steady progression. 

[b]Early Access:[/b]

If you used to be an Early Access believer but then had bad experiences that caused you to lose the faith, this game is a great one to help get that feeling back again. If feels pretty nice to belive in a game and actually have the developer live up to those hopes we have for what it could be next month, and then the next and so on. I feel like it's getting harder to find Early Access experiences where that still happens. I am SO glad I got this game. It's worth it for the regained trust in Early Access games alone.

[b]Linux Support:[/b]

I really appreciate the Linux support. Recent Example: The linux version had an important issue with it when it was released yesterday. We mentioned it to Simon and he had it fixed within 24hours. 

I have other games in my library, written by large teams, that have a much larger linux base asking for fixes, which are still basically unplayable (for linux and mac users, anyway) many months later. I would say I wish Simon was working for those guys so some of my other games would get this level of care as well, but I'm actually quite glad he's working on Maia because this game really deserves to have a developer working on it that really cares.

[b]Communication:[/b]

I highly recommend checking out the discussion pages as well as his website. He has been really great at working with the player base to make sure the updates contain the fixes that we care about the most and he is very transparent with what he is working on next, so you never have to guess if the thing you care about is something he is already working on or not.

[b]Is it finished?[/b]

Nooooo... Don't be confused about that, it is Early Access (Currently at 0.59 as I'm writing this review). There are lots of things he is still working on and little oddities that he doesn't like.  You will still have frustrating little moments watching your colonists do something rediculous that gets them killed now and then. The difference is that after watching the update progressions up to this point, I can now just laugh when those silly things happen, knowing that, in a few updates they won't be happening anymore.  (Which is unfortunately not something I can say for quite a few of the other games I own).

The overall feel is an enjoyable blend of contemporary sci-fi and 70s retro. It's a base management/survival sim that takes healthy splashes of inspiration from games like The Sims, Dungeon Keeper and Evil Genius. It's rich in character; touches like colonist-created, programmatically generated music and haiku, and colonist skillsets like cat appeasement and lukewarm tea brewing, add an undeniably charming flavour to the game.

In action, it's a constant, remarkably challenging exercise in staving off disaster, whether caused by your colonists' stupidity, the environment's general malice, your own ineptitude at the sheer complexity of colony management - or, admittedly, the occasional bug, as the game is still very much a work in progress. That complexity is both one of the game's biggest selling points, and one of its biggest hurdles; the sheer intricacy of the simulation's modelling gives the game enormous depth - if you can navigate your way up the remarkably steep learning curve.

The game discards many of the usual crutches of simulation and management games. The inability to directly control your colonists certainly adds to the challenge, making the gameplay experience more one of orchestration than direct management; likewise the lack of a comprehensive, point-by-point UI - beyond the basics, the stats and status of your base and colonists are communicated more by visual and audio cues than direct notifications. The overall sensation is one of trying to conduct an orchestra comprised largely of simpletons, playing music utterly unfamiliar to you, where a quarter of the instruments are invisible, another inaudible, and nobody thought to bring any sheet music. It's unashamedly difficult, but deeply satisfying one you manage to get a handle on things.

The game is absolutely still a work in progress, but with enormous promise. The developer, Simon Roth, is active and engaged, and calling him deeply deeply invested would be an understatement. I look forward to watching it grow and flourish towards full release.

I've had my eye on this game for awhile and decided to take the plunge. However, this game is still in a state where it requires testers more than players. The base gameplay is still too buggy and unbalanced to provide much enjoyment, although I can anticipate having a great deal of fun with Maia when it is further along.

I will update this review from time to time as the game develops.

Update October 21rd 2016, version .64

My prime problem still exists, in that the colonists feel wooden and dumb. They do things slowly and often ignore survival-critical tasks. It seems like the AI gets gummed up quickly. From the opening of the game, just attempting to set up the initial base, it feels like you need to follow a set script of actions to be successful. It doesn't feel like there's any room for individual preference or direction.

Update November 5th 2018, version .68

Checked back in for a bit over an hour's worth, two years after my last look. Not much has changed on the surface. The colonists are still slow and very dumb, leaving critical tasks unattended. The player recieves practically no information about what is needed in a reactive way (there is a barebones training missions now, which helped a little, but the gameplay is still quite bad). The one positive change I noticed was that food and water needs seem to come less often, so that rather than being dumb and starving fast your colonists are dumb and starve slowly.

The game is a simulation of sorts of trying to colonise an inhospitable planet. There are many dangers present, such as colonist incompetence, your own incompetence (yep! My first play and everyone died of hypothermia), planetary dangers (earthquakes), equipment failures, solar flares/radiation. A bit like a Sim-something game, scaled down and focused on the premise of colonising - well okay, similar in scope to ""The Sims"", but Mars! 

Colonists all have their own personalities and skillsets, and as such are more/less suited for particular tasks. Getting a random song or poem from one is a charming touch.

It is a very interesting game, and one that is gaining more depth and complexity as time goes on. It may be early-access alpha level, but the game already has more than enough in it to entertain for hours; I can see myself getting lost in it easily.

The developer is incredibly active, both on social media, as well as posting a game changelog on their website and in the games news section on Steam. Seriously, check out the news section! They are very passionate about their game, and this shows heavily in playing it.

This Game has gone nowhere, will go nowhere. I was initially very interested in its development and enjoyed the style of development however the game suffered from being very slow, boring and pointless and has gone in the direction of being bug ridden slow, boring and pointless.

Having comeback to the game to see what interesting and exciting things have happened I come to see initially working features buggy, colonists refusing to use the hundreds of litres of water to satiate themselves, colonists being trapped in wide open spaces and crying themselves to death, 12 colonists struggling to focus on building 4 things over 5-10 minutes for seemingly no reason.

As it is now you have to baby every single member of your colonization, built a lamp within a few metres of a wall ? I'm afraid that's a death trap. Watch for the first half an hour as your colonists eagerly swarm around the colony being productive, mourn as they cruelly become suicidal morons bent on boring you to death. Perhaps your interested in the challenging task of guiding a group of mentally deficient individuals colonization attempt of an alien planet ? Look elsewhere, When one colonist dies he is soon replaced by another, the goal of the game is to survive building a base with a seemingly unlimited amount of expendable manpower, research a meaningless tech tree as everything that means anything is available at the start of the game. Wildlife always dies when shot at, morons are cheap and unlimited and whilst the idea that a bathroom might cost me the lives of 3 brave explorers would normally be hilarious its often a joke that takes half an hour to get to the punchline.

TL;DR
Don't buy it until the AI/pathfinding got a lot better, or it's on sale for <10 USD.
It has a lot of potential, the core elements are there, and there are some interesting gimmicks but it needs to get better to be enjoyable IMHO.

---------
I WANT TO BELIEVE *insert X-files joke here*
I'm a sucker for survival/build-up games (logging ~1500 hrs in Space Enginners alone) and I've been watching & wishlisting this title for two years now.
Infrequently I've been visiting the store page of this title but was always repelled by the mixed reviews, their contents and reasons.
But this weekend was a 50% off special, so 'out of boredom' I finally picked it up, especially since in version Alpha 0.58 ""AI has been tremendiously overhauled and improved"".

I like the aspect that you do not directly control your crew in this game, you do have control over the IMP humanoid-bots and repair-bots, but you do not specifically tell your crew what they're doing when.
That's good in my books.
But it's not good if crew-members get stuck in the middle of a Workbench, or behind walls or in Atmosphere Generators. Also not good is when crewmembers infrequently dying of dehydration, even though there's like three half-full water-tanks to drink from.

What this game needs is an overhaul of the UIX; when every ~20 seconds a full-screen displayed warning been thrown into your face - stealing the focus - bcause your veggie-farms needing to be pitched, you're slowly turning into the infamous meme of fire-breathing Pepe, yelling at your monitor.

Frequently I had to abandon & restart my early-games, because of key crew-members being stuck, trapped or clipping into stuff. Like, remotely controlling a repair-bot. it's easily to drive it through walls, but you'll never get it back out of there, being stuck. you can't disassemble it because your crew-members can't reach it. Also frequently you're giving build orders (for outside placed Wind-Turbines or Solarpanels) and your crew-members aren't building them, even though all prerequsites are met.

Unfortunately I haven't gotten too far, since my people turned after a longer game frequently into lemmings, throwing themselves into the arms of death due to starvation and/or dehydration despite an abundance of available food and water.

It's also lacking are more - ""general oversight"" in terms of a grid's power needs/utilization and easier indicators what your crewmember is needing/lacking. after all they got voices, so they could tell you. (No they don't tell you when they're dehydrating and about to keel over).

This being an Early Access title, you're hereby warned. I can see where this game is going with its potential. The dev team is a small one with three on-site staff and three external contractors, which explains why their progress is so slow, especially considering the complexity and intricacies of this type of games; and it seems they developed their own engine for this, instead of using a middleware like UNITY.

VERDICT: buy when <10 USD or when AI/pathfinding has drastically improved. Until then; No.",1476651076,1476651076,False,4,1,0.539696395397186279,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Technically it is like old good dungeonkeeper but in space. The problem is, controls are so awkward that they turn the game in to the pain to play.

Developers should also consider removing that ""digital noise"" filter from the game (or at least have an option to turn it off) because it really does not add any value to the game - it just tires your eyes and makes You wish to turn the game off within first 10 minutes of gameplay.

The general guideline is that while games should provide some kind of challage to be interesting that challange should not be in form of bugs and awfull user interface but in a good AI, or challenging story instead.

Personally - I was blasted away by the fact that I was somehow removing whole parts of base with just a single click instantly or placing doors randomly without a chance to cancel such ""design errors"".

In last version before official stable release I have some issues or better say ideas for improvements regarding UI, but overall it is easy to digest and react to game events. Game has also no hands hold approach, however descriptions of devices, events, messages are verbose enough in my opinion to give you enough hints what's going on.

[i]Do you like science-fiction?[/i]
[i]Do you like classic god/sim games?[/i]
[i]Are you looking for something unique, different & challenging?[/i]

[i]If so, read on...[/i]

[h1]My Introduction to Maia[/h1]
I first became aware of Maia back in 2012 when Kickstarter was in full swing. The unusual sci-fi aesthetics and interesting vision are what initially attracted me, and I continue to be impressed by how driven the developer is.
This is a god game with subtle challenges underneath. Challenges which may even change the way you view game design in general afterwards.

[h1]Maia, the HUD & Gameplay[/h1]
Why even mention the HUD? Well, rather than take the approach of giving the player an easy categorised spreadsheet list of all the various variables/states in the game via large sprawling HUD panels, Maia chooses to integrate much of that as items/signals visually within the world itself. It is this world which you'll spend most of your time interacting with as you expand your base, build machinery, craft autonomous robots, and battle the various hardships that colonising a harsh alien landscape requires.

This difference in game design approach isn’t for everyone, and can force the more casual gamer to rage, but therein lies the treat for those who persevere. Creating a large self-sustaining tech-enabled [spoiler]nuclear fusion powered[/spoiler] colony from a few desperate souls is really satisfying, and you’ll end up more attached to it than just about any other god/sim game out there.

Sure, it does take some time to understand how the world works, and there are some quirks which may be bugs (it is in Early Access currently), but it makes for such a refreshing change from the sea of clone and asset store created games currently on sale.

[h1]Sound & Model Design[/h1]
As a fan of both the 80’s culture and electronic music in general, the general model design and music/effects are really top notch for a small studio, and thus deserve a special mention. I had flashbacks of Vangelis’ Blade Runner combined with Space 1999 and it’s a perfect fit for this type of game in my opinion.
If we’re lucky, we’ll see a Maia soundtrack release at some point.

[h1]Bugs & Developer Commitment[/h1]
For a game initially Kickstarted in 2012/2013, you’d be quite right to question when the release would be, especially as we’re now approaching 2017.
Thankfully, unlike many other games that become abandonware, the Maia build is still being actively updated with fixes and new content.
To give an example, I've recently seen the developer having to put in extraordinary work to fix problems for Linux users which were not caused by the game, but GPU drivers. I also heard they spent a huge amount of time trying to make the game run on older Intel drivers. These particular issues are also somewhat to blame for the slip in release dates.
That's commitment you don't see from AAA devs, let alone an indie dev.

You can clearly tell that this is a passion project, which more than likely means that development will continue for some considerable time irrespective of version numbering. Not only that, but the developer is extremely technically skilled, having written the actual game engine itself that drives Maia.

If I had any critisim of the developer, it would be the heavy reliance on Steam Early Access, but then this is more a business issue rather than anything else, and hopefully the future will be a bit brighter after the recent Steam changes and tweaked business models from lessons learned.

[h1]More Than Just Maia[/h1]
If you're anything like me, and have an interest in what's under-the-hood, you may be surprised to hear that the developer seems very keen to engage in that kind of discussion.

I've watched a dev twitch stream where a crash occurred. The dev then took viewers through code explaining a sizable amount, making a change, recompiling the game source, and playing the new revision. I don't think I've ever seen that kind of open engagement from a developer before.
See for yourself: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/simoroth]https://www.twitch.tv/simoroth[/url]

On top of that, they’ve also provided a publicly accessible site showing the code changes committed to the project:
[url=https://dev.maiagame.com/]https://dev.maiagame.com/[/url]
Again, which other developer does this?!

[h1]To Summarise[/h1]
If you want a new experience and appreciate the different approach Maia takes, then you will, I’m sure, see the beauty behind this one-of-a-kind labour of love.

Edit (Feb 2017): The most recent version of the game, 0.60 has lava (seen in original kickstarter art), and many, many fixes. In fact, the game has been fixed/tweaked in a huge number of places over subsequent updates such that it's hard to find any glaring issues.

The dev (only 1 I believe) creating this is an idiot. I listened to a podcast he did and while I agree, I don't want to be spoonfed every detail... you could at least give me a chance to figure out what's going on... The tutorial doesn't cover anything, just makes sarcastic remarks and shows basic keystrokes but doesn't explain what anything actually does. There is no pause button, meaning you can't hit pause and look at your base to find out what to do next. Especially important at the beginning of the game. So as of right now, the game is about starting a new game, failing within minutes, and restarting a new game. While I like the concept of starting over with more info to do a better job the second time I hardly even have time to find out what my mistakes were. 

Edit: The dev is a Genius/Idiot, and I am empathetic as I am similar. He has built something so complex with actual science behind each piece. An intimate knowledge of electricity is something i've seen so far. So the idiot part, the implementation, the part where you connect with real people. As I've said there is so much lacking here. For one a pause button, but after writing this I realized there is no save. Supposedly there is a quicksave and quickload but it doesn't work. So EVERY time you load the game you're looking at starting a new game. So back to the genius/idiot point. He's done so well in the implementation of certain points of the game, however other parts make it almost broken. 

I will continue to update this review untill it is comprehensive on the good/bad points of the game... (Written below, in under FINAL EDIT: I have stopped rewievewing this after I receieved a refund. I can't very well continue a review if I'm not able to test certain aspects of the game. The review will stay 'as is' and incomplete. Poetic? I think so, this game has been in early access for a long time now. As my last entry edit, which I wasn't going to mention, the dev admits to spending around a year working to make the game compatible with old graphics cards. This is why I can't find myself to remove the genius/idiot part of the review. You could possibly replace the 'idiot' comment with inexperience, however in the same podcast he mentions the old graphics cards he touts all the projects he's worked on. Being fully aware of what you are buying into with Early Access, I don't forsee my troubles being fixed anytime soon if ever. So there you have it, an incomplete review of an incomplete game. (See dice roll below))



Plusses:
+++ A genuine real life face for every colonist
++ The plants have energy value in joules (Thank you Mr. Newton)

Minuses:
--- Everyone died in the ""TUTORIAL""...
--- One mission ""Cassiopeia"" says you have 45 minutes until more colonists arrive, it's more like 3-5 minutes

Explanation: Ok so on top of everything else the AI is messed up beyond reproach, the I.M.P. robots will rush to make a door when things like an 'atmosphere creator' is in need of building, or a space heater has been qued when everyone is freezing. They seem to make wind generators at a fair pace but still neglect other objects needed that an alarm is buzzing at you about. It comes down to timing. The 'game' doesn't give you enough time to correct any potential problems before colonists die from them. Say hypothermia. I put up the space heaters but no one is building them. If a colonist is dying of freezing you would think that would be a priority. 

The theme is based around not being spoon-fed answers by your user-interface. You get emails from the colonists asking what they want. The problem is by the time you read them they are dead from whatever it was they wrote about. I have no idea what the dev is thinking...

Sorry, I wanted to like this but I wouldn't suggest buying even at half price...

Final Edit: I ultimately asked for and receieved a refund for Maia, I'm leaving the review as it was at the time of refund. The only things I will add are that I was fully aware of the F5 and F9 save/load, they did not work. I was not aware of the space button to pause, though I don't think it would have helped. Perhaps my machine is running the game too fast for some reason because when I see videos the colonists and imps are moving about half the speed they moved when I played. Events and emails happened so fast I couldn't read them fast enough and often the event (say a meteor-strike or death by hypothermia) happened as I was reading the in game emails. I'd also like to say I don't think this is a cash grab like some other early acess title's. The dev seems very passionate about it and is hands on updating often. Since I receieved a refund this review will remain incomplete and unchanged from here on.

And that's barely scratching the surface!

Don't let the Early Access scare you, Simon Roth and Machine Studios are one of the few that actually get it right. They put out constant updates in content and are qutie open with the community across social media. It's not hard to find out what's new, what's coming next, and what they have planned for the future.

One major problem would be with the AI.  The workers and robots  are so slow to respond and complete tasks that I alsways died from freezing.

I think more people should support it, that said ...

So I went on a mission, where the mission items were timed (I really hate to be pushed on timers, not fun at all). But ok, not a huge deal.  Built what I needed to, down to 5 mins, put some items down, including the main mission item – a communications antenna.  Some people were doing nothing, and eventually started building.  Seems they didn’t get the memo that communications was the next mission item, so they left it last.  1.5 minutes left, communications still pending, people are walking around, and hugging, etc., and the timer is ticking away.  It eventually reaches 0, mission failed, and the colonists don’t give a damn, lol. 

Ok, I think I put down too many items at once, so I did it a bit more controlled. There’s very little room for error, as you have to think minutes ahead (not seconds). Made it to the next mission item – also timed (argh). Ok, so started to clear an area.  Colonists are now complaining about needing sleep, and food, but the medical center and beds is the top priority?  I guess it is in case they die from hunger while working as slaves to build while starving to death because the timer doesn't have any wiggle room. I also needed more power, built another wind generator, then started the medical building, laid out the door, and 3 medical beds.  After 1-2 minutes, a colonist finally shows up to build it, and the door, and leaves the beds and takes off.  Ok, no problem, 1.5 minutes left, let’s see if anyone comes to finish the beds.  Timer runs out, mission failed, colonists don’t give a damn (again – 3 beds was the mission item), lol.

Cool, you can control the robots in first person view. After clicking the mouse button, I thought the robot pooped/regurgitated something awful. Oh ok, just the rocks I guess it collected? Not a bad thing, just funny. ;)

You can right-click to de-select the active action under your cursor when building items. You can also right-click to destroy a building without warning (oops). Costs time and materials to rebuild what was destroyed in a fraction of a second.  Had to reload the game (on timers after all, no room for error).

In the middle of all this, while building, the game takes control and throws the camera over to the incoming colonists.  I DON’T CARE, I saw the message already, let me finish what I was doing.  Now I don’t even know where I was, must scroll back – yet, on the way, the camera pulls me to something else. :/

Keep getting a warning the storage room is getting cold.  You can now hover over rooms to see their temperatures. I built atmospheric generators to help (one per room), and it helps, but I found out from watching a video that you only need space heaters in other places.  How much do they output though, or how much power is required? Doesn’t say.  I can see the temperatures in rooms rising now.  Stats are getting better, but still a bit poor list of stats, still difficult to see what’s really going on around the base.

It also crashed a few times in a way that made the cursor disappear.  Make sure to save often.

Things it needs:
1. Much better AI (perhaps even mission focused). Enough hanky panky, get back to work!
2. A priority system, so you can better queue up what needs to get built first.
3. Much better stat reporting on the items (especially generator outputs for one). If there is a warning a room is cold, at least show room stats also.
4. Status icons you can click to quickly bring you to the events/issues. DONT FORCE MY CAMERA - I might be in the middle of something. 
5. Automated smelter, or show an icon when it is waiting, or done. Don't turn this into a space focused Farmville game, lol.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odBDAcOEKuI
6. Fix building bugs (see comments), random crashes (rare), and errors restarting missions (always have to restart the game).
7. Built hydroponics for food, but people are still dying from starvation? lol This needs to be fixed. If I'm missing something, then that should be in my notifications. ;)
8. No idea what anything does, or why I need it, nor how many I need to make.  There are details when selecting items to build, but no text describing what it is for.  Makes it a bit tedious to keep looking up what things are for, and why. For example, until I watched a video, I had no idea space heaters could be used instead of atmospheric generators.  I thought I needed a generator in every room.

I'll keep an eye on these issues and update the review as the game progresses.  I think it is a great game to support, but I had to give a thumbs down until a lot of issues are ironed out. I'm half afraid sometimes to play it in fear I forget to save and it crashes. ;) Perhaps Auto-save is needed at an internval I can specify.",1476249154,1476473376,False,12,3,0.653835535049438477,14,True,False,True,False,,,

The game is constantly improving with changes having positive impact and is responsive to player feedback. Can't really ask for more from a game in Alpha.

Maia is basically a base management game with survival elements and will be even better once more content is added and the bugs ironed out. At present there are actually a surprisingly low number of bugs but the main one that gets me everytime is the deaths from your colonists just deciding to stop moving and eventually dehydrate or starve (whichever comes first). This wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't a cap on the number of colonists meaning they don't get replaced. Eventually everyone will be dead and with nobody replaced the base can't get bigger as more people would be required. 

For an early access game it's a good problem to have as it will be fixed eventually. General gameplay is still really fun and oddly stable.

With 0.59  Maia has had a lot of content , fixs and tweaks - really making it feel more and more like a decent budget AAA game rather then a indie. I mean, its not there yet, but Maia's pretty darn ambisious, so its amazing how far its come.
I think the key to if you will enjoy Maia or not is if your prepared to learn and replay a lot. While initially it feels like ""scifi dungeon keeper"", the game is a lot less forgiving. You have to balance life essentials like heat,power,atmosphere before you even get to food and drink. Each time you play - and your colonists all die horribly - you tend to learn a bit more for next time.
The game also, despite being early access, has a lot of content already, with various scenarios as well as free exploration. So with these too things in mind, its certainly not a game to be used up quickly.

The downloads/limitations of the current 0.59 state of the game are mostly UI related, as well as some AI issues with colonists build priority's. Its perfectly possible for them to build themselves into a room with no doors - so you better hope another colonist will decide to build a door before they die or starvation/dehydration.

Despite this, its a game I definitely recommend for sci-fi fans with patience, and a desire for a reasonably realistic ""let me set up a base on a unexplored alien world"" game.

Previous review (Sept 13):

Maia is already a great expirence, with even more great potential.
It feels sort of like dungeon keeper meets star-trek with bits of dwarf fortress chucked in too. Its ambitions are big, but its pulling them all of pretty good so far. Anyone that yearns to build bases on alien worlds really should check this game out.

Additionally;

Please don't dismiss this game from the (very recent) negative score. A lot of the negative reviews are over a year old.

Maia's concept basically takes Dwarf Fortress and puts it into space, on another planet.  That's both a good and a bad thing.

Like DF, you decide what needs to get done, and the colonists go off and do that on their own, with no direct control.  Unlike DF, if a colonist is unable to do something, you don't actually get any sort of message as to why — it just doesn't get done.

Like DF, it's being built by a solo developer, who is focusing way more on adding new features than on fixing bugs, even old or important ones.  Unlike DF, those bugs aren't things like ""military training isn't working"" — they're game-breaking things like ""none of my colonists will go outside to make a wind turbine to generate power for the atmosphere generators, so they all die due to lack of oxygen"".

Even once you get through the first few steps and get a real colony going, it's only a matter of time before colonists just up and decide they can't do some critical thing and they'd all prefer to die, and you don't get any indication why.

My suggestion to the developer would be: Even if it's not part of your vision on how the final game will look — for now, give us some debugging tools!  Even if they're off by default, we need some way to show us what our colonists are up to, what tasks need doing, why they aren't being done, how priorities work, etc.  For one, it's just too frustrating to play without those right now; and two, they would enable us to give you actually helpful bug reports, instead of just vague statements like ""nobody would go outside so they all died"".

Sadly, my experience playing Maia for several hours today was basically the same as my experience back in 2014.  A ton of stuff has been added, but the game feels exactly as inscrutable and unplayable now as it did back then.

Placement:
Sometimes I cannot remove room blocks, they light up but when I try to cancel them they won't go away. New game...


Construction:
Seems they like to construct solar panels more than they like to construct the windmills, the flare happens nearly immidiatly at random game and they all die because of power problems even though I have instructed them to build windmills and there is sufficient material left.

Pace:
Time feel its a litle bit fast, when I have made up my mind of where I want everything and instructed to robot to make room for base they have already died in some way, either lack of air or freezing to death.

Last year I called it ""playable"". This year I can actually call it entertaining. What's most entertaining, at least for me, is that the colonists are actually very human. Allow me to explain.

In most games, you have people that feel more like worker drones. They will go from place to place, build, mine, craft, sleep, get hurt, go to the medic bay, build, mine, craft... The ""people"" here feel actually like people. And they don't want to be treated like worker drones. They get stressed out if all they do is build and work. 

Of course the idea that people do something aside working isn't new. But this is I think the first game that actually models ""stress"". I wonder why this isn't a sales argument, but I was actually happily surprised when I noticed this! 

You start out with 4 colonists and you can of course make them work, work and work. But don't be surprised if they get really burned out very, very quickly. And that means that accidents will happen, that they get depressed, and that they will simply not really want to work anymore. They start making bad decisions, they start to mess up priorities. And they'll start to complain. Subtle at first, and eventually they'll be anything but subtle. Ever heard of ""quitting on the inside""? That's what they do. If only because they can't actually quit, being stuck on an alien planet. They'll just get sick a lot, make snide comments in the emails they send you, complain about their coworkers and actually be hostile to them, work the bare minimum...

A bug? No, probably not. Because if I lower the work load, if I add ""stress relievers"", if I add more people to spread out the work, suddenly they start to behave ""normal"" again.

This is actually pretty amazing. I have never encountered this depth of AI in any other game.

Aside of this, yes, there's still a long, long road ahead of them. They now added ""missions"" to the already existing sandbox game where you get more or less easy tasks to fulfill within a given time. Still in need of some tweaking and balancing, IMO. The alien fauna still doesn't quite have as much of an impact as I'd have hoped it would (basically the alien animals are a backdrop and don't interact much with your base). The balancing in general still needs work, it's VERY hard to start out but if you survive the first 10 days it becomes pretty much a cakewalk, a slow, steady increase in ""demand"" from the colonists would be great here. And there's still not that much to ""do"", so to speak. Research now works pretty well, but after about a dozen or so research topcs have been checked off the list, you're done with that, too. 

So we're still not looking at much of an ""endgame"" to to speak, and I still hope that we'll eventually see some sort of ""campaign mode"" or something that's more than the sandbox (plus the ""guided sandbox"" callsed missions). 

It's not done yet. But with very frequents updates (about one large update per month), we're looking at a game that not only gets active development but one that actually improves with every update. Many Early Access games ""break"" at some point and start getting worse, losing or throwing away the reason you bought it for. So far, Maia avoided this fate.

However since then I have become a bit disillusioned with it. But I will provide a fair judgement of it in its current state and the developers. 

The game does have amazing charm, almost all the tech in the game is not far from what we have now and this gives the game a fantastic sense of realism. Even the charecters are dressed to match what you would expect and the game has a fantastic sense of humour in the little info pop ups. Base construction is intresting placing rooms and then decorating them freeform does give a great sense of personalisation (beware OCD people out there, trying to place things dead on is a nightmare, I suffered!). The world outside your underground home feels alive in the style it has been done in with various creatures who may pose a challenge to you. And they accompany the various events such as earthquakes that keep the game fresh and intresting. Managing the various resources is also given a sense of realism such as managing air production and flow, heat, food and such and the devices used are, as I've said, realistic in design the type of thing you would see in a building today. Futhermore the game's developers are fairly active and updates are common but nothing really seems to make serious progress forward. 

However this sense of realism is compounded by the fact the game is buggy as hell. I cannot reason the A.I of your people who seeminly act at random if at all. They will often die standing in a room that has no heaters set up yet while the room next door is fully heated. Getting them do to anything is a chore and I have often had people die early on because they take so long constructing the basics. The tutorial is terrible, I thought that all you needed as the atmos gens to sort our heating and the like, but while the tutorial gets you to build one it does not get you build the heaters meaning by the time you realise you really really need to, coupled with the time it takes the A.I to do anything, it might be too late. 
The U.I is not very helpful with nothing immediatly displayed on the screen meaning on your first go you wont even know how much elect, water and such you have until it runs out. I like where the developer is trying to take it however, being able to read your peoples E-mails is a great idea and again adds to the personalisation. But at the moment is fails to give the player what they need. 
The colonists work independent of the player, but sometimes it is needed to force construction of an item or activity and if there is a way to do this I havn't found it. If you need to build a turbine for an emergency power drop, but have other actions already in place your a little screwed. 

All in all the game has a great feel to it and that is why I am reccomending it, to keep and eye on it but not to buy. Previous versions of this game were more enjoyable and to me more stable and that is a shame but hopefully this is due to them implimenting the game proper and this is just a rough patch.

Today the game still has many of the same bugs and issues it did when it was released and is still in a barely playable state.
The developer is still working on the game, but at the pace it is going and considering how inexperienced and inefficient the developer still is after all these years, it seems the game will still take another 2-3 years to finish.

Because the idea behind this game is rather interesting and refreshing, and there aren't a whole lot of alternatives, it may be worth checking in on this game again in another 2-3 years. Then again, by then there might be something much better.

The really infuriating thing? Sometimes they will build them. But they refuse to build a smelter so then when I run out of building materials, I can't get anymore to build the heater in the hydroponics bay so they stop freezing to death just standing around in it......

It is understandable that one guy alone cannot move mountains, and what Simon has attempted here is simply awesome, on the other hand as a kickstart contributor i've been waiting for 3 years to play. 

This review is for alpha 0.55 and it is the first one that i managed to keep running for more than 4 h straight. The bugs are plentyfull and diverse, from annoying to game-breaking. 

I am now writing this review after an extended playthrough that i would rate as very enjoyable despite the need for frequent ""save-loads"" to reinitialize the scripts. It has sadly ended in a save game that loads to crash and i will probably be waiting for at least 0.6x before attempting another run. 

The game at the core is truly amazing, a hard sci-fi world with tons of attention to detail and very immersive. You need to pay attention to a million small things to keep your base running and the AI is quite helpful (when not crippled by bugs). The world is a funny and strange mix of Dungeon Keeper meets Alien and it works! 

The only big fault I see is the planning... if you budget your game for one man for 2 years but have no chance of finishing it in that time-frame you'll run in a catch 22 , the game is in a too poor state to attract new buyers and thus you cannot hire people to accelerate the process.

Of course, you can never really tell with Early Access games, but first impression is it's allright. Not exceptionally awesome, but pretty good. I'd even say at least slightly above average. It was definitaly worth the money and you get pretty much everything that's being advertised. What suprised me most is that, unlike many other alpha-games, this game has exceptionally little and few bugs. Sure, you get the occasional crash (at least on win10), which can be frustrating if you haven't saved in a long time, sometimes colonists get stuck and die, object ""health"" sometimes becomes negative which will result in the object not getting any repairs ever but all this happens rather rarely and doesn't really have too much of a disrupting influence. All in all, i'm pretty glad i've bought this game.

quick summary:

+ rather bug free
+ you get everything that you see in the trailer
+ the game can be played almost without any disturbances
+ no game-breaking bugs (at least none that i encountered)

- no autosave (at least not that i know of)
- game sometimes crashes (at least on win10)

so i'd say, if you don't mind running into small bugs occasionally or (seemingly) random game-crashes and you like the game's concept, go ahead and buy it, even if it's just to support the developer.

Edit: it has been more than a year since i played this game last time. Currently, it is definitely not ""an entirely new game"" (which is good, because i liked the game the way it was) but there are a lot of changes. as far as i could tell in the few hours that i have played now, pretty much all bugs that i mentioned have been fixed and i didn't experience any crashes. there are also a few new and interesting objects to work with. i still wasn't able to locate any option for autosaves, but now that the crashes seem to have been fixed, that is only a very minor issue and almost not worth mentioning. so, i'd say it has improved a lot since i wrote my initial review.

Firstly, lets reiterate that this is an Early Access Game. This means that it's in development, some features aren't 100% correct, bugs 'may' be included (for now), and it's not a final product.
Maia isn't your everyday resource planning, create, build kind of affair. Yes, it has those elements, but the game is way more technical and scientific. You have to bear in mind breathable atmosphere for your people. You have to watch for the core temperature and air flow. Create correct conditions for plant and animal life to grow. And watch that your people don't go loco and start losing their minds.
Graphically the engine is quite well done. Visual representation of solar flares, and external radiation are well done. Of course these conditions affect your environment too. 
Building and placing objects is pretty easy to do, after some practice you'll be placing and moving about freely. Personally I would like to be able to zoom out a little further, but that's personal preference.
Looking forward to more interaction with the wildlife - they are out in the wild, but I've yet to experience them attacking my crew, for example.
The addition of missions is a welcome one too. You have objectives to achieve and a time limit to do so. Once complete, you progress further on. I've not tried all of them but they certainly make you focus on the tasks in hand.
Just remember - early on - Crew need clean air, food, water. Nail that down quick and fast.

Robots who can't always reach their mining destination despite doing so earlier is another thing I've been bumping into quite often. Or people dying of starvation or malnutrition despite having full stock of rations. I should also add my humans last a veeeery long time without a bathroom.

While some are self explanatory, a short line saying what it does and what it requires to work would be great to have. I had to go online to see what does what so far.

I get a lot more colonist deaths than I used to, which created stress to deal with the many problems - a very good thing in a game like this. I also managed to turn that flagging base around and down a more stable path, which was a huge sense accomplishment as everyone stopped dieing!

I'm looking forward to capturing one of the native fauna that can be domesticated and using it to supplement the base rations.

Every update has added blancing changes that make aspects of the simulation more interesting, and major features are added quite often that change aspects of how I've played the game. I still recommend this game, as it often makes me wish I had more time to play it.

- End Update 2016-12-15 -

I really enjoy this little base building & management game. I absolutely love that the development team works to publish regular updates to the game about once per month; each time adding neat new features (it's an alpha!) and working through the known bugs that have been reported and reproducible.

In particular, I love the heat simulation and new room layout mechanism in the most recent update. The former adds a layer of management detail that is complementary to other base needs, while the latter presents a more intuitive and visual way of ""painting"" the layout of your base than the existing system (you placed entire room tiles with a click). Then they worked to add in color a color picker for the lights, which affects the colonists' moods and plant growth rates. Oh and a brand new scripted mission to play through. So, plenty of new features each month to go along with learning what exactly it is your colonists need to stay alive and form a self-sufficient colony.

I've definitely enjoyed the open development of this game. Each update has been great and added several new toys to play with.",1458225866,1481832801,True,8,0,0.543344676494598389,2,True,False,True,False,,,

バグ落ち・高負荷、インフォメーション不足・コンテンツ不足
個人開発だと思うけど、そのキャパを大きく超えていると判断する。


以下過去文

現在アルファであり、今後修正される要素や改善する箇所などがあるだろう事も踏まえた上で駄目な部分を書いておく

・UIが物凄く使い辛い
まずメインメニューの""Launch""文字がクリックしづらい。オリジナルカーソルを使用していることと、反応するサイズが小さすぎて押しにくい
ゲーム中マウスホバーで表示される情報は、逆に文字がでかすぎる上に画面からはみ出すせいで非常に見づらい
何より表示される文字が全体的に見づらい

建築するものをQやEキーで選択するという古くさい仕様
クリック(右含む)が汎用過ぎる。建築しようとしたときに出るメッセージを閉じるためにクリックしたら同時にオブジェクトを設置してしまうとか、設置しようとしたが止めようと右クリックしたら、マウスの下にあった建築指示を取り消してしまうとか

・全体的にインフォメーション不足
足りないものがあるならそれを表示するべきだし、建築指示を大量に作ると優先順位を設定できない
一つ一つ建て終わるの待ってから次を作らないと、何時まで経っても建て終わらないオブジェクトができて、主にミッションで容易に破綻する

石を掘り、材料にする、というメイン要素の資源管理に対して、地面に石が落ちてるところに部屋指示したら石は消えるし、材料作る指示しないと殆ど全てのオブジェクトが作れない
ロボが無限に石を排出できるみたいだけど、無闇に掘りたくないのに掘らないと進まないジレンマ
掘った後そこに部屋指定ではなくて、部屋指定をしたらそこを掘ってくれる方が楽なんだけど、部屋指定してない場所の崩落イベントが無意味になるから無理なんだろうか

・カメラの自由度が無い
・オブジェクト配置時のマウスに張り付く仮オブジェクトが緑のドットで輪郭が不鮮明である為に、微調整できず綺麗に位置合わせできない
・ミッションの建築指示のタイムリミットが短すぎて他のことが全然できない


サバイバルゲーにありがちだけど、現段階では自由度が少ない、というよりコンテンツ自体が少ない
酸素を供給する手段が一つだけな所とか、エアロックが無いと外に出れないはずなのに掘ったら外と繋がっちゃうところとか、まだまだ全然ゲームのベースができてない感じ

Overall, this game isn't bad.

The graphics are ok, especially since it isn't a AAA engine. (The rain kinda is wanked, but that is with most games that are top down) The concept is, in my opinion, one of the best parts of the game and I'd love to see it reach its goal. Making it into the game a few hours, I finally built a lab and was able to start doing research, though it doesn't lead to anything yet. But based on the reserach that I completed and finished, it seems that the goal it to eventually get a tech tree of some sort into the game which would increase the time to ""finish"" the game and also increase replayability.

So, since this is a great concept and it seems to be on its way, what is the problem? I personaly feel like I don't know if it will ever get to its goal and dream. I've seen so many early access games come and go and never get fully finished. Like I said, the concept is great, but with a UI that needs work, menus that are slightly confusing and an AI that really doesn't seem to know what it is doing, I just don't know. Hopefully I'll get proved wrong.

So, breaking down the issues with the game I'll start with the UI. The UI doesn't provide enough information at a glance. It is slightly cumbersome and it provides so few functions in general. As for the menus I'll just give a few examples; the load and save buttons aren't in the ""esc"" menu but are buttons in the upper right of your screen... ok, not bad sounding... but they aren't labeled so I lost a two hour base because I hit the ""load"" and not ""save"" icon. Another example of the UI needing work is the building menu. To switch between items as of now, one has to press ""Q"" and ""E"" a design choice I personally don't get. And that latter brings me into my last point or the AI being wonky. I can get around most of the other issues, but the AI is my biggest gripe right now. I can't tell my colonists what to do by say clicking on them and then clicking on a task I want the to complete. In some cases, this can lead to many deaths. I can set up many tasks, with the first thing I tried to build being a heater, and they'll do other things first, and die from hypothermia. lol. I mean, if I'm freezing to death, I'll build a heater first. But, IDK, maybe they know more than me.

So, in the end I'm going to recommend this game with a caution. Beware of what you are getting. It is, as I said, a great concept and I think that all the negative reviews don't do it quite justice and I want to see this succeed as I miss games like this. However, I think that my fear of it not being finished or what it could be may still be well founded.",1457635561,1457635561,True,25,1,0.702249884605407715,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Every once in a while you find a developer that understand what early Early access means and understands that it does not mean crowd source fundraising.

Not everything will work in Alpha and that is fine -- however there should be some minimum expectations. As of right now there are some ridiculous bugs/issues that I noticed within the first 20 mins of play including the following:

- Turning on/off text effects do not work properly (text effects are very annoying and distracting)
- The exit button does not work.
- Camera functions are not smooth on high end machine (i7 / GTX 908ti / 16GB)

There are options that should be available for use in an alpha that are not:
- Video options are extremely limited and are extremely slow to respond to adjustments
- No Gamma correction and this game tends to be a bit dark

By the time the developer is receiving money from players, the core game enviornment should be stable and workable enough to determine what else needs to be done in order to enable the community to provide usefull feedback.

Ich selber besitze dieses Spiel nun schon seit 2 Jahren und warte auf Updates aber passiert ist bis jetzt nicht viel.

Spiel ist total verbuggt:

Negativ:

- Kolonisten bleiben in Wänden hängen
- Kolonisten und Roboter spären sich aus, beim Bau oder Bergbau (Da dann Rohstoffe für Türen felhen sehr intelligent   Programiert *facepalm
- Spiel bleibt regelmäßig hängen
- unübersichtliches Koloniesystem, man weiß nicht was den Kolonisten fehlt was sie benötigen
- absolut die dümmste KI die ich je erleben durfte 
- man kann Bauten weder entfernen noch ändern (fehler beim bauen werden so bestfraft das man dann ewig einen Schandfleck in der Basis hat kurz gesagt man kann wieder von vorne Beginnen sehr ärgerlich!!!
-Es fehlt eine Übersicht was man zum Bau benötigt (Sprich Rätselraten was brauch ich zum Bau für...)
- Grafik ist Verbesserungswürdig

Positiv:

- Spielkonzept interessant
- erinnert an Dungeon Keeper im Weltall nur ohne Kampfeinheiten ;)
- Atmosphere im Spiel ist gut gelungen

Mein Fazit:

Kauft dieses Spiel nicht es ist absolut nicht Spielbar und sehr Enttäuschend.

Bref vos personnages se contentent de réparer des éoliennes toutes les minutes parfois à trois dessus sans penser à se faire de la bouffe et finissent par crever comme des cons... La recherche se résume à construire un ordinateur qui fera des recherches aléatoires et complètement sans pouvoir agir sur dessus.

Ok, so I haven't written a review before but decided to write one for this game. First I'll just list Pros and Cons in order then describe a little about it from my experience thus far,

Pros:
-Neat idea worth expanding on
-Good graphics for an alpha
-Fun*
-Harder sci-fi than some I've played
-Devs work on the game and respond to feedback (Got an answer on the review initially)

Cons:
-Bugs
-More bugs
-Occasionally problematic UI
-Optimization issues
-AI build priorities
-Inability to manually control colonists

So, I'll start with the Pros. First off is the idea, I like it. It is always nice to see older style technology (Like the capsules the colonists land in) in a Sci-fi game instead of the constant use of sleek and streamlined ships and tech. Next up is the graphics, they are actually surprisingly good for an alpha game although I'll admit I've never been much of a snob about graphics. Now on to the ""Fun"" I mentioned, it is not fun in the sense of a fast-paced action kind of fun. It is more of a challenging fun associated with overcoming the challenges of survival. And finally, the last pro, ""Hard"" sci-fi. I find hard sci-fi to be more interesting a challenge in a game and that made it just a bit more interesting to me. For example: to get water you have to build a solar still and for food you need to build and maintain a hydroponics area instead of just building a food replicator or the like. 

Now on to the Cons. First off let's talk about the bugs, most of the other reviewers say that the dev/devs have focused on features over bugfixing (time will tell if that's true, I've only had the game a few days at time of writing.) I think the dev/devs should absolutely focus on bugfixes first, at least the game breaking ones that is. A good example of this has happened to me several times in a single game where I would call in some additional colonists and they would just stand outside the capsule waiting to die in their suits, that needs to be fixed. Apart from that, there are a few bugs I've encountered like one of my I.M.P. bots just standing in front of a fossil stand that was full holding a fossil and wouldn't dig or another one where my maintenance bots wouldn't go around the local Flora to repair my wind turbines so I had to manually drive them out and around the plants. Now that bugs have been adequately discussed let's move on to the UI. It is hardly there, kind of annoying to get used to, and is a little hard to use for rotating items without placing them. In addition to those, there is no way to save your game during it so you have to hope that it saves it. And, finally, on to the the optimization I mentioned. It freezes while loading it but eventually does get running. It is a minor issue but I did find it frustrating that the game freezes each time I start it even though it'll run well after it loads (with bugs and UI issues of course). 

TL;DR: It is definitely worth waiting on. I'll recommend it but with one planet sized caveat: it is buggy and very much an Alpha. In other words, watch the game and buy it when bugs get fixed.



**UPDATE**
I said I'd come and update the review over time, so I will. The bug with colonists getting stuck coming out of their pod is fixed. There are still some problems with AI priorities so far and the game crashes occasionally. For the AI priorities, I can set them to build the basics of a colony (Like heaters, atmosphere generators, and wind turbines) and they will not get around to much of it and die of hypothermia. 

One new problem I have with it has emerged though, and it is admittedly a little bit nitpick-y. The problem is that the escape menu has no save option or ""quit to main menu"" button. I'm assuming it is a save and quit situation, but it is still a little odd that I can't save with how much it crashes for me at present. I'd be fine with a ""save and continue"" or ""save and quit to menu"" option or something similar. 

I'd still recommend following the game, it is interesting and you don't see too many more ""hard sci-fi"" styled games like it. I'd recommend buying it if you don't mind it being a little buggy or supporting the devs though.",1451965166,1459644710,True,10,0,0.545099079608917236,2,True,False,True,False,,,

This game goes to great lengths to bring the perils of just existing on a hostile planet to life and the attention to detail can be felt running through all of the interacting systems.

It's been really interesting to watch this game grow through Early Access - update after update have added new systems and fixed bugs, and with a simulation game like this each new system increases the complexity exponentially. With the addition of the campaign it feels like those systems are now pushing towards something as well, for those who are less inclined to play a ""directionless"" sandbox.

.56 update: Now the game has been updated so it'll work on modern video cards, so the game now runs.. HOWEVER, the game it's self is still unplayable. Colonists will just randomy starve to death even though there is food, livestock will spawn uncontrolalbly if you create a livestock area and cause all of your oxygen to be sucked up (the chickens don't die, but the colonists do). The funny thing is, there's an article from years ago that says the developer knew the chicken spawing rate was insane, but left it as-is because he thought it was amusing. Haha funny, we'er all laughing at a game-breaking bug you never bothered to fix (esp. since now it seems chickens are needed so colonists don't starve). 

Colonists won't build a door to save their life, quite literally.  Some things which should be automatic aren't (like converting raw materials into usable materials--the smelter isn't automatic, and can't be made to be automatic). Robots still get stuck, although the addition of repar robots is progress in the right direction (if they didn't get stuck).  UI is buggy. I had the tool tips say I was placing a ""Dog: wooof!"" for everything: items, rooms, etc (restart fixed that). Had another case were I couldn't see any of the update texts to know why a colnist died etc.

The game is playable for the first 10 minutes, then it crashes and burns in a cesspool of bad game logic.

I've given this game, and the developer, a chance for years now. I'm done. He has never fixed the core game logic, and, at this point, I doubt he ever will.  In fact, as of .57, he's added more logic that causes colonists to die even faster.

----
.54 update: The game now has issues with modern video cards using OpenGL 4.5 --it won't launch, and, instead, will try and ""fall back"" to OpenGL3, and then finally fail.  

Stay away from this game. Looks like the dev may have tried to make his own game engine--Unity would have worked fine here. No wonder why game developent is taking so blasted long.

---

Instead of fixing bugs and major playability issues (which are boring to do),  the developer has focused on adding features (which are fun to do, but pointless if the game core is broken). The only thing this ""game"" will provide you with is frustration. It isn't even a beta quality project yet/

Watch your colonits wander around inside your base and suffocate because they never bothered to take their space suits off. Have your colonists starve to death because they're too busy walking in circiles or standing still to eat. Watch your base equipment catch fire and burn because colonits are too busy fixing a door they just fixed a minute ago than to maintain equipment--and watch equpment filair up far more often than is fun. And come on? A work lamp becoming atorch and burning an entire room of hydroponics? That's just stupid-- no light would explode and start a fire because nobody had touched it for hours.

The UI also leaves much to be desired. The UI is both keyboard and mouse based, and the keyboard element isn't well explained,. There also is no scrolling through messages, so if the text doesn't fit all on the screen (such the case with stored research), then you won't be able to read it at all.",1450130774,1469949928,False,87,7,0.691528856754302979,18,True,False,True,False,,,

[i]A Dungeon Keeper-esque space-colony builder with minimalist UI[/i]

tldr - I like it. Maia shows great promise, and has a very low chance of succumbing to Early Access Syndrome.

[u]Gameplay[/u]

Your base is built into a mountain (the atmosphere of the titular Maia is toxic). If your colonists need to go outside (to build solar stills for water, wind turbines/solar arrays for power, collecting researchable things like non-sentient alien creatures and plants, or meteorites, etc) they will use the airlock. The suits they use outside are cumbersome and slow.

Inside the mountain-base you designate (much like Dungeon Keeper) areas to be mined out. Once empty areas can have rooms (such as a workshop, a research room, a living area, a hydroponics room, etc) built into them. You must then place a door, and other context specific items (for example workbenches and 3D-printers in the workshop, or beds/couches and toilets in the living area). 

Once a game starts you must quickly build a workshop, and add a workbench. Once that is done you must build a power system (wind turbine/solar array, or a geo-thermal power plant as well as a ""fly-wheel"" energy storage (battery). Once a power system has been built you must place atmosphere generators. That all takes care of your urgent needs. You must however secure a food source (hydroponics, or animal farms) and continually satisfy the needs of your colonists.

You do not directly control your colonists.

The devs of this game have stated from the outset that they don't want to 'spoon-feed' players to much information, and have designed the game in such a way that players must work for information. There is no ""emotion bubble"" that floats above your colonists, only biometric data like respiration rate, perspiration rate, heart-beats per minute, etc. This is just one example of a system that promotes player interaction and investigation as opposed to unrewarding spoon-feeding. All the information you'll need is there, you just have to find it.

[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
[*]A cool, and compelling theme.
[*]Easy to understand game mechanics.
[*]A tutorial (I'm serious, how many games have a proper tutorial while in Early Access!).
[/list]

[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
[*]No traditional savegames, instead you play one game at a time that can be continued if you exit the game and come back.
[*]No bordered window mode.
[*]Lacks detailed options (but there are resolution, anti-aliasing and quality options).
[*] No goals/missions other than survival (Although the latest update has added three scripted missions).
[*]Still in Early Access.
[*]The normal price of $24.99 is arguably too high for the current build (but will be a good price once Maia is feature complete).

[u]The Early Access Problem[/u]
Maia is still in Early Access (As I write this, Alpha version 0.51) which poses several problems with a recommendation. When it comes to Early Access many promising games are either; abandoned by their developers halfway through development, developed in such a way that early-adopters are angered, or have their developers react angrily from criticism. I believe that Maia, although not immune from such problems, is certainly free of them for the foreseeable future.

[b]Dev Abandonment[/b]
Maia has received regular updates, both small 'hotfixes' and major updates. The two latest major updates, Alpha 0.50 and Alpha 0.51 were deployed on the 3rd September 2015, and 22 October 2015 respectively. Each update adds a lot of new content, and fixes bugs.
The developer, Simon Roth, is also very active on Twitter and happily answers questions.
[b]Bad Development[/b]
Some Early Access games have started out promising but developed along different lines than what was promised. I don't think Maia is at risk of that as it's clear from development and the content of updates that Simon and his team have a clear plan and is sticking to it. Hopefully this will protect against feature-creep, and I have seen no evidence that it isn't.
[b]Naughty Developers[/b]
Some strong games have been let down by their developers being taking criticism very badly and being rude - which does sometimes make people shy away from their games and makes adapters regret supporting such devs and their games. Simon and his team do not appear to be the type to do any of this though, as Simon is quite open on Twitter and I have never seen or heard any complaints regarding his behaviour.

Problems:
* Contruction is weird when building two rooms adjacent to each other... the second room will have space used up by a hallway you didn't place.... why?  The blueprint didn't show that.
* Font for colonist selection screen is almost unreadable at my resolution.  It really needs to scale with resolution size.
* No way to prioritize what gets contructed first... and the AI isn't smart about it either. No food... well we'll work on something other than the greenhouse.... 
* AI problems.
* Letters/messages take a long time to scroll on the screen.  Annoying.
* Game could really use a UI element that shows your bases inventory, oxygen, etc... So that you don't have to click over to the storage or the ? button over, and over and over again.

* Lack of useful information.  
 -  Ok.  Red means you can't build something, green means it's ok.  But wtf does yellow and orange mean?  There should be a tooltip explaining what's wrong with the location.  
 - Why is something not being built.  Am I out of resources?  Is everyone too tired?  Can noone get to it?  When you hover over a construction project, it should show a tooltip saying if there is enough resources to build it or if its waiting for an available worker.
 - Are people idle?  Or is there something else preventing them from work?  Can't tell.
 - What workshop buildings do I need?  Are some of these just upgrades?  Or do I require some for building specific objects... No clue at all in the game.
 - Still no way to tell how much air their is in a room.


Pros:
 * It was neat that colonists would make suggestions that have possible positive and negative consequences.
* Looks nice.

(The game has improved allot, it is in a much, much better condition than it was before.)

 0.57 Review

Main Problems:
* Lots and lots of unecessary micro. 
 Ex:  You can build space heaters... but you have to manually turn them on and off as rooms go from too cold to too hot, apparently they can build robots, but not a rheostat. :-P  
 Ex:  Accoding to his youtube, if you don't manually operate the furnace, to smelt the ore... It has a chance of breaking down!  Cookie clicker isn't the best source of inspiration. :-P

* Lack of useful information.  

 - People dying.  They need to call for help or something.  So that the user can get an indication that something is wrong.  Example:  I had a colonist die from dehydration.  I had barrels of water and a water still.  Never got a warning saying colonist thirsty and I have no clue why they died.  (Stuck someplace maybe?  Bug?  I have no clue.  Which is the problem.)

Pros:
Looks nice.

Overview:
I tired it out again and quit as I found the lack of useful information and all the micro really annoying.  It also felt agonizingly slow... but I suspect that was because of soemthing the peons where lacking, just no clue in game as to what that is.  (Sleep, workbenches, resources, something else?)

Still don't recommend buying the game.

It's rare to have a responsive dev so I better take advantage.  The I.M.P. is much improved, no trouble with it ignoring orders.  However there is issue related to the I.M.P. but not really the I.M.P.s fault.  after it gets done digging it just stays there and when you build a room there's a good chance it'll get stuck inside a wall.  You can avoid that by giving it a dig order some where else so it'll move away but you have to remeber to do it and sooner or later I always forget.  I think the best way to fix this would be to program the I.M.P. to automatically go to the nearest storage unit and wait there when it completes any job it has so it will be safely out of the way and I won't need to remember.  Another fix would be the ability to destroy rooms.  As far as I know you can't destroy rooms but I havn't chaecked the tutorial in forever so I might be wrong on that.  There are two other concernes.  I notice after a long while the colonists seem to lose focus on building blueprints.  This only seems to happen after the base gets pretty big so it might be because they are busy repairing things, not sure if repairing is prioritized over building.  In future plays I'll try and remeber to use more than one repair drone and see if that helps.  

The other thing is the windmills.  They keep falling down.  I always put turrets by my windmills so I'm pretty sure it's not wild life getting them.  Often times it happens so fast I don't think it normal wear and tear, I'm lucky if I get two days out of them.

[b]Short summary: [/b]Maia is a unique, captivating game. It explores the possibility of a human colony on an alien world. Even in its present unfinished state, Maia is worthy of purchase and full of potential for enjoyment and delight.

[h1]Overview[/h1]

I first encountered Maia at a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7HLqexFBeY]game show in 2014.[/url] Being fascinated by space exploration, I was immediately sucked in. Maia 'gets' space exploration in the same way DayZ 'gets' zombies: The story is not the zombies, it is the [i]people.[/i]

In Maia, people are at the heart of the experience. They do what the want. They interact with each other. They may follow your orders, or they may laze about and die of starvation. They might threaten each other, become sad, grow happy, or develop relationships. They are truly a group of colonists, going about life on an alien world.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Interaction with Maia is indirect. The player never builds structures, or conducts research. Instead, requests are placed in the world and colonists then react to those requests. I use the word 'request' rather than order, because colonists will not always carry out instructions.

At first, their ambivalence to a placed Atmosphere Generator may be interpreted as a bug in the game. With more play time it becomes apparent that the colonists have a sense of what is important, and what is required. Already have too many Solar Arrays? Colonists might simply choose not to build them.

There are no centralised mechanisms for managing colony power, food, and water requirements. Instead, individual stores must be inspected, and observations taken around the world. This quirk can sometimes be frustrating, but that frustration can give way to fulfillment - Balancing a power grid is very hard, and more rewarding for being so.

Often I see Maia referred to as a 'God Game.' Having never played 'God Games,' and not being familiar with the genre, I can't speak to the accuracy of that description. I would not, however, describe Maia as a god game in the first instance: The player is not god, they are a companion. Not omniscient, omnipresent, or all-powerful at all. Instead, the player is limited, flawed, and often ineffectual - A reflection, perhaps, of the colonists pottering about on the planet surface, and all the more enjoyable for it.

[h1]Aeshetics[/h1]

Generally, I am about as artistic as a pencil sharpener, so I'm not the one to judge Maia's aesthetics. But I think it looks fantastic.

The use of a custom renderer means the game does not express the intangible 'feel' of a commercial solution such as Unity or Unreal. Instead, it gives of a vibe of bespoke craftsmanship. Models are of a consistently high quality. Animations are well weighted and engaging - Though they are often blatantly disconnected from the gameplay their are supposed to be related to.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

Early Access games come in various flavours of 'bugginess,' and Maia has tended to hover towards the 'very buggy' end of the spectrum through much of its development. Because Maia does not offer many explicit clues to the player about what is happening in the world, bugs can be insidious. A colonist sitting on the floor of a room may be bored and recalcitrant: Or their AI might simply be stuck in a buggy loop of doom.

Recently, the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791434871068/announcements/detail/97180323971741771]Stardystopia Update[/url] has brought fresh stability and consistency to the experience. If Stardystopia is a foundation upon which Maia grows in future updates, then it has the potential to leave its challenged technical past behind.

[h1]Development[/h1]

Judging the character of Maia's development is perhaps the act in which my conflict of interest is most likely to manifest itself. It is also the area of which I am most critical.

An Early Access game must be open. To be on Steam Early Access to not just invite, it is to require the interaction of customers with the development team. It has been difficult for Maia's customers to find information about development. In the last few months, the team has made strides towards pulling down the fourth wall and letting information flow out to customers. This process must accelerate.

The pacing and content of development updates are strong. Most especially since around March this year Maia has received consistent, high quality updates that have steadily improved the game.

Most importantly, Maia's development team has authentic soul and character. [url=https://twitter.com/SimoRoth/]Simon[/url], [url=https://twitter.com/carolinedonnaf]Caroline[/url], [url=https://twitter.com/leannethng]Leanne[/url], [url=https://twitter.com/Ruairi_Iliffe]Ruairi[/url], [url=https://twitter.com/hdickson_]Hannah[/url] and others are committed, tireless, optimistic, and hard working. They want Maia to be a better product, and are constantly putting in the effort to make it so.

In the earlier alpha versions:
-The colonists built in some random order prioritizing food and water over building anything, so all my colonists died from lack of clean air. During one of the play throughs they finally built the air generator and power generators just to find out that the colonists prioritized a couch over a bed. Yup, a couch. They would run to the workbench to work on the bed then run all the way back to the couch to sit and repeat this process with the occasional run to get food or water. The workbench and beds were really close. To be honest they finished the hopper before a bed, oh and a door to an empty room, and another couch. They never finished the bed.

-Another play through I set up a nice looking research lab and placed an artifact in there. To my horror the artifact was cursed. The colonists would run to study it and oh boy did they study the hell out of it. They studied so hard they died from starvation or exhaustion. After the colonist's untimely demise the next would run over to study it on top of body of his fallen comrade. This happened until my colony was wiped out. Yes I had over 8 colonists and all died in a glorious pile in front of the artifact. 

With Alpha 0.50 I find the colonists actually building things. Except doors to rooms with their fellow colonists trapped inside. For those that haven't played when you create a room it has no doors built in and the person who built it gets trapped inside. I thought my other colonists would go to the rescue but instead they roamed the land outside the colony searching.... searching for what I do not know. Then they would suddenly stop and stare at a tree, rock, windmill, solar panel, or just stand infront of their recently dropped colony ship thing. Yup new colonists would land and just stay in front of their ship. I had about 5 guys next to each other in front of their ship. The colonists must have messed up bad on earth because all I can think of is the earth being run by really smart people: ""You have an IQ of 20! Well we so happen to have am OUTERSPACE mission for you! Can you say OUTERSPACE?"" ""Otterspace!"" ""Yeah close enough, off you go.""

I would recommend this game to any who feel like get frustrated at colonists who are anything but the chosen few to expand our foothold in the galaxy.

I've been following this game for several year now. I bought into the alpha back in mid 2013, or at least well before it hit steam. It was in Alpha then, and is in Alpha now. Even Minecraft didn't take this long in alpha, and its alphas were far more stable. I was playing through this game just before writing this, wanting to record some footage to post online. I played for about 17 minutes, after which it crashed. Lost that save. And if I wanted to start it up again...whelp, gotta wait for the game to load the menu, in order to load the game. Oh, and DON'T EVEN THINK about changing any graphics settings, unless you want to wait a minute and a half until the game decides it's ready. Also, while this maybe due to me having a shitty 4:3 monitor, but I could not play this game in any widescreen resolutions, even in windowed mode. 

This game had, and still has, so much potential. If it wasn't so crash prone, and didn't take a lifetime to load, I wopuld recommend it. It is fun!....WHEN it works. The problem is, well, it tends not to. Not for very long, at least. It's as crashy now as it was back in 2013. 2 years, and still a crashy, buggy alpha. It feels like more effort has been put on gameplay and features, and less on fixing bugs. What good is gameplay, even amazing gameplay, if you're unable to enjoy it due to bugs and crashes?

This game still sucks :( The interface is terrible. Text is not well visible over the background, the UI switches to things happening outside while you are placing objects inside of base. Or it shows some random email while you are building - why is this engine in charge of what I see all the time???

There is almost zero sesnse of the base's resources. Sometimes things don't get built but I can't figure out why. Do I not have enough material? Is the building itself bugged? I can't tell because there is no UI to get this info!!!

The game still crashes while playing.

The missions are too hard. It's not easy to fulfill objectives unless you have every single move planned upfront. I.e. after failing numerous times.

IMHO, the developers keep failing in game design. Yes, building your own engine is great, well done, you can pat yourselves on the back. Now get someone who can actually make things playable for people!


REVIEW OF 0.49:

I just had a look at the 0.49 and regrettably I must say I wouldn't recommend this game. I bought it around 0.47 because it looked so good on paper but here is why you actually shouldn't get it in my opinion, at least in its current state:

- the updates have been increasingly rare
- the updates that it does get add new functionality that seems random while it doesn't improve the (lack of ) core game play
- there is no sense in the game of what you are supposed to be doing - e.g. how much material / food / colonists in total you have. They just added reports on power which is great, but every game like this has an overview window that shows you your resources so that you know what you need to be getting next. That, to me, seems more important than adding weapons, for instance.
- there is no sense of why accidents happen - e.g. all my atmosphere generators exploded all at once - I have no idea why! And the colonists don't seem to care, they just walk around. You would expect major panic if something like this happened in the real life (the game is supposed to be a simulation, right?)

Before you all start accusing me of not knowing what alpha is - I know very well. I'm a dev myself.

In my opinion, the devs here should stop adding more functionality that create more breadth and isntead focus on improving the gamer's experience to create depth. Make a game out of this. Because at the moment, it seems like bunch of functionality stitched together. Give us a reason to play! Experimenting with new features is great, but wears off after you've built everything. The game is not interesting after that.  Give us a sense of what we are doing and why we are doing it!",1438565678,1502148863,False,111,4,0.765797019004821777,0,True,False,True,False,,,

However, Dwarf Fortress is playable (your mileage may vary). Maia is really not playable and hasn't been for some time. I imagine that making a game is difficult, especially with a small independent team. However, the game got a couple hundred thousand dollars from Kickstarter and tens of thousands from the IndieGogo side. I do very much hope that I'll be able to change my review of this.

Some issues I found in the game while playing:

- Some NPCs will often start walking in circles trying to find a sweet spot to reach something and will stay like this for a while (minutes, sometimes 10 minutes or more), and if this NPC is a human being, it will starve to death.
- The colonists starve to death even if there is plenty of food
- The animation for the ""aliens"" to die takes really long. Like ""Wow you shot me? Just hang on while I prepare to die... just a minute... almost there. Okay, dead""
- There is nothing you can do about the bodies outside the base and sometimes the alarm will just keep warning about the base perimeter, even if everything out there is dead.
- When you ask the colonists to build a materials hopper they just won't... until they feel like it. But then your entire base is completely full of rocks and they WON'T TAKE THE ROCKS FROM THE FLOOR AND PUT THEM IN THE HOPPER!
- The colonists walk too slow. So slow that they often starve or fatigue to death on the way to their assignment.
- There are not many things to do in the game, so the player may get bored REALLY FAST. No action, no jumpscares, no nothing... and it gets boring.
- After you built the entire base, it will be too big, and the colonists will die because of fatigue due to their deficient AI.
- When a colonist die from the fire on the atmosphere creator (?) it will become a burning corpse and won't move.
- Sometimes colonists die and just stay there, standing... creepy.
- Colonists will ignore bodies and people dying. This should be prioritized. 

My reccomendations:
(To the developer)
- Fix the bugs before developing new stuff. People are getting tired of the bugs and are leaving the game.
- Some more action would be a nice thing (if you really want to develop new stuff)
- Make the colonists faster! They run and stop too much! It's so annoying.
- In base, the colonists in the suit should walk faster.
- Try to program a new AI. They should prioritize some stuff, like eating and resting! They die of thirst and hunger even when you have lots of water and food avaiable. I don't think a human being would starve to death due to his many assignments. He would eat and then work.
- They get hungry too fast.

(To the players)
- The game has a really nice concept but is still in development. It's still unfinished! If you don't have patience to wait for the developer to fix stuff, just don't try any alphas. You will get tired and will just get pissed for no reason. 
- If you do have a lot of patience, my advice: play it. The game is really cool and it makes you imagine all the possibilities for it in the future. It's raw, but when cooked it's gonna be crazy :P

Edit: It has been 5 years since my review of this game. The developer even thanked me for my detailed review. And I appreciate that. But then it's been 5 years and...

The game is still unplayable. One thing is to have patience and wait for the dev to fix the bugs, another is to come 5 years later and the game still be in the same position.

I mean, the concept is great but the game is still in its early steps. Not playable at all.

Some examples of bugs:

- The colonists still starve to death even when there's food everywhere.
- Colonists usually forget to do stuff like tending to crops and making food.
- Bodies are still left outside to rot.
- Colonists still walk way too slow in a ""run and walk"" manner. It's mildy infuriating to see. They often walk too slowly and die before arriving to their destination.
- Sometimes colonists have to wear protective suits inside the base, and that's fine, but that makes them EVEN SLOWER than they already are. And most times they just starve to death.
- Aliens can clip through walls and doors and get inside your base and eat your chicken.
- Most buildings are forgotten by the colonists and the blueprints stay there forever.
- Fighting is extremely not satisfying at all. Colonist shoot, alien walks like nothing is happenings, and takes 200 years to ""die"". The animation is wonky.
- Colonists get out of the base for no reason without wearing protective gear and die on the wasteland. Definetely a bug because there is no reason for them to do that and you can see the colonists is trying to get back in but the path finding is awful and he can't seem to find a way back in.
- There are many other bugs I could describe but it has been so long I'm not sure the dev will be able to fix this.
- Now, after some time, there won't be enough space for new colonists to arrive. And I don't mean in the base, I mean they can't land because of the capsules outside from previous colonists arriving. You can destroy the capsules, but as I told you, most times colonists never go where they have to and they never destroy the capsules you ask them to. Your colonists start dying and you can't seem to get new colonists because of the old capsules outside.

Once again, the concept is cool but sometimes I feel the engine chosen to make the game might be too old or something like this. It seems the dev can't make it work and I understand how frustrating this might be. I'd love to give this game a thumbs up again but after 5 years waiting for the same bugs to be fixed I just can't do it.

If you like this kind of game and want to give it a try, go ahead, but don't expect it to be a walk in the park. It's hard and most times it'll kill you for no fault of your own. You give the colonists everything they need to survive but in the end they always die.

NEW EDIT:

I don't learn. I can't learn. After literally more than a year after the last edit, I came to the conclusion that the dev doesn't understand what are the issues with the game. Problem is, the whole community is telling him the issues and he still keeps doing them. I don't know if this game will ever be what it could be.

The fact is, this game said it was Mac compatible, so I spent my 15 or 20 dollars thinking it would be, you know, Mac compatible.  Well, a year later, I still have never gotten to play the game (unless you count one time it actually started and ran at about .5 fps. for a few minutes before crashing.)  I have patiently waited for this dev team to fix whatever bugs have been preventing this game from running or even starting on my Mac that meets every system requirement I've seen.  And here I am still waiting, with no results to show for it.  Yes, this is an early access game, so bugs are expected.  But this has been an early access game for 3 years.  I think that is a long time for any game to be early access, and its plenty of time to fix bugs that make it impossible for customers to even start the game.

Good potential in what is there but at this point after following the game for a few years now preceding the Early Access release it is still in dire need of:

* Colonist behaviour tuning so they don't just feel like partially-autonomous robots just running about performing reactive duties - Missing are Social interactions, off-duty behaviour, interests, role ownership in that it doesn't take 5 colonist engineers to attempt to change a lightbulb. If one person decides they will own the job of changing light bulbs it should be their responcibility, and just generally seeing colonists do more than just bounce between reactions.

* Some means for the player to actually be involved in the colony even if it's through passive influence events. Currently you say where rooms go and what objects go where, then you're done and have nothing to do forever except sit watching a rather interesting/destructive screensaver. Complex simulation inclusion is great for a game, but a game it does not make in itself if you have no avenue for continious engagement.

I tried to play the recent build of 0.56 and I hate to say that this game has gotten even worse somehow. Your colonists are even more stupid than ever before, despite several A.I improvements mentioned in patch notes. Instead of roaming around weeping themselves into starvation they will now wander aimlessly freezing to death, as weeping and sitting on the floor is more productive to their survival than building a wall heater apparently. 

There are many many more ridiculous bugs that are each just as game breaking that seem to never be fixed, but rather compounded with each content patch. If the current build was made to be somewhat playable before new mechanics and other content is added or if what is stated in the patch notes is actually present in the game I may have hope for this game.

Уже сколько лет игра в разработке, а прогресса почти что и нет!
Я все ждал, ждал... еще с версии 0.25+ постоянно слежу за ней. Но обновления выходят раз в 2-3 месяца! Причем обнова из разряда: ""Починили траекторию ИМПа!"", через пару месяцев опять: ""Починили траекторию ИМПа и добавили какую-то мелочь"". И так далее каждые 2-3 месяца! Нет, задумка хорошая, но вот разработчик явно положил мокрый и горячий на разработку. А те так называемые ""сайлент"" апдейты никто и не замечает, ведь, как говорит сам разраб, фиксится что-то важное. 

Про никакую оптимизацию - даже говорить нету смысла. 
Более того, если еще на версиях 0.37-0.45 колонисты могли забегать в скафандрах домой, то сейчас они это делают постоянно... 

В общем, раз в 2-3 месяца что-то фиксят, но при этом ломают в 2-3 раза больше. Даже полосу слева на ЛЮБЫХ картах от АМД не удосужились убрать! В свое время брал за 450р о чем жалею. На тот момента была надежда, и вот увы, прогадал в итоге. 

Ее даже за 50р не рекомендую брать. Это будут просто выкинутые деньги в никуда. К тому же противно наблюдать, как разрабы доят народ как коров. Сначала заманивает, а потом, когда все видишь и осознаешь - обещают кучу всего. Так что можете смело взять игру, попобовать поиграть минут 30, и сделать возврат средств. На крайний случай - час. Надолго вы вряд ли тут задержитесь.

ДЛЯ РАЗРАБОВ:
Поглядите, что может сделать ОДИН человек на примере BANISHED за меньший промежуток времени! Позор вам! 

ДЛЯ ВСЕХ: 
НЕ БЕРИТЕ ЭТОТ УЖАС!

Версия 0.58, казалось бы должно было добавиться много чего за последние почти 2 года... угу... ага... Парочку тумбочек добавили, пару моделек и, чуток текста. 

Тогда я еще мог развиться до построения лаборатории с компьютером, пусть для этого приходилось потратить часов 5 (80%+ времени - перезапуск игры, ибо: зависал AI колонистов, глючила графика, зависала сама игра, ломались сейвы и начиналось все с нуля, и т.д.). Сейчас - не могу даже построить рабочую зону! 

Кончается еда? Построили Гидропоническую комнату, приказали строить дверь что бы колонисты зашли и посадили культуры. Но они не строят эту дверь... орут что жрать хотят... ну дверь постройте же! Но нееет, они не строят ее и в итоге дохнут от голода! 

Так же с жилой зоной. Зону построили, дверь не собираются даже начинать строить! Орут что устали... все уже отменил из запланированных построек - не делают дверь. Поставил ее с другой стороны - не строят. В итоге дохнут от усталости!

И так 99% времени в игре... нет, ну с 2012 года, сука, можно же хоть что-то внятное сделать! Но от того что нам выкинули сюда в стим в 13 году почти ничего не изменилось. Можете поиграть в 0.25 версию. Разницы почти нет! 

Итог: разрабы поимели нас. Мы поверили в интересую идею, концепты, но 4 с лишним года по сути ничего не получили.

P.S. Нет, бляха-муха, они издеваются! В последней новости по версии 0.58 есть пункт... верно! ""Исправлена траектория ИМПа""!!! Сколько же можно дрочить траекторию ИМПа? 4 года? Серьезно?

P.P.S. Саймон - ты 3.14здоболищ2.7!  >:(

Derzeitiger Stand (betrifft 0.48 auf iMac 27"" Mitte 2011 unter OSX 10.10.4):

- Nur jeder zweite Programmstart funktioniert, im Wechsel mit ""unerwartetem Beenden"" noch vor dem Ladebildschirm.
- Hat ein Programmstart geklappt, bietet sich der Bildschirm in nativer Auflösung im Fenster an: 2560x1440. In dieser Auflösung ruckelt es fürchterlich.
- Also Neustart (mindestens zwei Mal), um die Auflösung zu ändern. Ein Krampf. Die Auflösung lässt sich nicht auswählen, sondern ich muss alle Auflösungen durchklicken. Nur dass dieser ""Mauszeiger"" dann nicht mehr mit dem Bildschirm synchron läuft. Unmöglich, dann noch die Zeile mit der Bildschirmauflösung zu treffen. Abhilfe: Abbruch des Programms, Neustart (mindestens zwei Mal).
- Hat man die Auflösung endlich geändert, NIEMALS DEN FULLSCREEN-MODUS EINSCHALTEN !!! Dann bleibt nämlich der Bildschirm schwarz. Abhilfe: Abbruch des Programms, Neustart (mindestens zwei Mal). Dann die config.xml löschen und von vorne beginnen.

In den Update-News feiern die Maia-Macher neue Features. Davon konnte ich noch nichts probieren, mangels lauffähiger Engine.

I've been following Maia for a while but I've never bought an early release game and was hesitant to do so. I few weeks, maybe a month ago I bought Prison Architect, which is also an early release game and it was great, it seems complete even though they are still working on it. Then just a few days I decided to buy Maia, I believed for the price it would be fun to play and see how it would grow through updates. 

However I can't play. I installed in on my computer and when I start it up I get a little document which flashes and then shut downs, not even making it to the actual game. I reinstalled it, didnt work.  Changed around with the screen scenes and it didnt do anything. So I tried to install it on my cousins computer. I got so excited when the game launched, I got to what I guess was the loading screen before it faded white and said, ""Maia.exe has stopped working.""

I dont believe both computers have issues, I would like to think it was simply an early release bug, but they are two different problems. So for now, I would not recommend this game until this is fixed. I do hope this can be fixed with a future update as I really would like to try out this game.

One day, this will be an awesome game, but right now -- even as an Alpha -- I honestly feel Maia is too rough, and too early in its development cycle, to appeal to anyone beyond those who are fully committed to the testing and review of something in the earliest of prototypical stages.

Another way to put it? I regret spending money on Maia in its current state -- but I expect I'll be glad of the purchase later on in the Alpha development life cycle.

Ignore the steam playtime; I bought this outside of steam at 0.3x.

It's not often I write a negative review, especially of early access games - either it's too soon to tell, or the game is so bad that Jim Sterling will deal with it.  Maia, though, I want to warn people off, for now.

[b]Maia should not be in early access at this time[/b], and it certainly should not have a ticket price of $25.  This is an alpha stage game, with serious, fundamental flaws that need to be worked on before this can be an enjoyable beta experience.

[b]Maia[/b] is a colony builder, like [i]Spacebase DF9[/i] or [i]Rimworld[/i].  It takes the [i]Towns[/i] approach of letting you set tasks and build spaces but not directly control the colonists.  With good AI and balanced priorities this works well; without it, you get issues as with Towns.  Maia is somewhere in between: the AI isn't very good, but there is so little going on in the gameworld that it's just about good enough, unless you do something weird.

Graphically I like Maia.  It's got a 1980s styrofoam-and-foil aesthetic, with big-head robots and Space: 1999 jumpsuits.  The graphics are very unpolished, but this game I think qualifies as alpha at this stage, so that will come.

The UI is just so bad.  It is clunky, awkward to use, with unintuitive keybindings, an absence of necessary information in the overlay, no easy way to check what your colonists are doing, and an annoying over-sensitivity to screen scrolling when you're trying to get the obnoxious and imprecise mouse cursor over the icons.  Drawing rooms is a chore, which is an issue when that is pretty much the only thing you can currently do in the game.

It's also very poorly optimised.  Running on min settings, with a mid-range computer in excess of the recommended specs, I get memory crashes, terrible frame rate issues, and periodic freezing as the game tries to calculate something.  I've spent a lot of time on forums trying to find ways to address these issues at my end, with no luck; I'm not the only person with this experience.  A certain level of poor optimisation is to be expected with early access, but not to the degree where it derails your playing.

Development is okay.  I feel like they should be further along than they are at this point.  For over a half a million dollars in funding and a year and a half since the first playable build, it should be further along than this.  I think Maia, Towns, DF9 et al illustrate one central truth about town-management games: they take time to develop.  If you over-promise, you get DF9; if you rush and then run out of hype, you get Folk Tale; if you don't nail the AI, you get Towns.  Dwarf Fortress didn't happen overnight; without having to worry about graphics or platform integration that game took years to get to anything like a quality gaming experience.

And that's principally why I am warning against Maia.  For a well-funded game to be charging $25 for an early access build that isn't optimised, isn't visually polished, doesn't have basic features, lacks solid AI, and is without the diversity of content you need for a game in this genre, that's not a good investment.  I accept that an early access game will be content-light, will have areas needing to be polished, but when a colony-manager after this much work still doesn't have basic UI, AI and optimisation sorted out, they are going to have no chance of adding more content without bringing the game crashing down.

I want this game to succeed, but they don't need more money, and you don't need the current experience of Maia.  Give them until the end of the year, see where they're at then; they will either have fixed these issues by overhauling basically the core of the game, or it will have gone the way of Folk Tale.  Either way you'll have your answer.",1428295825,1428295825,False,198,1,0.770616471767425537,12,True,False,True,False,,,

It features I.M.P that are robot versions of imps from Dungeon Keep, they will mine what you select for mining. Your colonists build your rooms and items in them, as well as grow crops, research and all that jazz. Maia is also hard sci fi, the colonists sweat and burn calories when working, the more calories they burn the more food they need to eat. All this is simulated in the game, so you need to get your food correct and it takes time to grow so planning and learning is needed.

Lots of updates to the game since it launched on early access, there is at least 1 sizeable update a month. Its is very stable at the moment, runs very well and no major crashes. Its very much an alive game.

The AI has been improved drastically in the last few updates, they no longer seem to want to die, still a way to go with them, but they are very much do what you think they would at the moment.

The UI is the biggest stumbling block in the game. I kinda like it, but I can understand people that don't. Its very hands off, you know what is going on by seeing it. If a colonist is shivering and you see their breath, then the air is cold. You know the air quality of a room by screens that can be built, there is no overlay or any information readily available to the player. 

Also in the construction menu, there are no images, you have to scroll through a list of options with the keyboard, its easy to miss things. I would like a slide out panel that had images and you can select it but you get used to the way of it soon enough.",1426167633,1487767244,True,14,0,0.578431844711303711,0,False,False,True,False,,,

So yes slow update was a issue but with recent events I don't see that being a problem any more and if you worried about the dev burning out or burning the cash of there customers like some other early access dev have done Simon has already addressed these concerns http://maiagame.com/viewentry.php?id=25 This game is receiving good attention from the dev team and the progress is moving faster then i have ever seen it on this game improvements are happening faster with that said there is still a ton of testing for game breaking glitches left to do so don't expect a glitch free game yet.

Pos:
Good Dev and team listens and interacts with the community
steady progress of the game with hot fix’s and cont updates
A increasing R&D system in the game, watch your tech evolve and grow
Game mechanics are pretty realistic looking in to all aspects of the human condition
Looking forward to new features and such the sky is the limit!!! or so a hope :P
Really cool looking 1970's future look to it

Game is still riddled with game breaking glitches that are just waiting to be discovered
game is poorly optimized ATM (But what do you expect form early access a gold toilet?)

Pros:
 - Nice concept/style, I can see why it's attracted attention over the years.

Cons:
 - A tasking/AI-centric game with terrible AI. We're talking colonists running out of the airlock with no suit on, people standing motionless in burning rooms until they're incinerated and no prioritisation to job queuing so critical life support machinery will not be repaired because everyone's too busy following each other around in circles or all waiting for the same (broken) machine. The order you create jobs in is ignored, and even completely clearing the queue won't get your colonists to repair that air filter before they all suffocate.
 - Alerts/announcements that become repetitive and annoying, particularly environmental warnings that you can't do anything about because your colonists are all sat in the lounge ignoring you.

Still a fucking mess...
Whilst some interface and AI problems have been resolved, the constant failure for the AI to path any tasks is beyond a joke. Random issues occur frequently, with colonists not being able to find a path to objects that are in an open space next to them.

Maia spielt sich gut und es hat meine Erwartungen erreicht. Ich bin auf die angekündigten weiteren Features gespannt und kann im derzeitigen Release-Zustand guten Gewissens zum Kauf raten.

=====

Stand: Version 0.65 (Review nachbearbeitet und Empfehlung angepasst)
Die Entwicklung geht sehr regelmässig im 2-Monats Rythmus voran. Die Updates bringen auch jedesmal einiges an Inhalt. Der Fortschritt ist solide, aber immernoch sehr schleppend (1-Mann nebenberufliches DevTeam?).
Falls die finanziellen Ressourcen reichen um das Spiel fertigzustellen, dürfte es ganz nett werden. Ich hoffe dass es sich noch oft genug verkauft um dorthin zu gelangen.
Da sich das Spiel mittlerweile recht gut spielen lässt und einiges an Inhalt bietet, kann ich nun zum Kauf raten.

=====

Stand: Version 0.46
Maia hätte eigentlich Potenzial und seine Reize, nur zieht sich die Entwicklung dermassen schleppend hin, dass das Spiel zum finalen Release wahrscheinlich veraltet sein wird. Derzeitig  arbeitet die Crew (und Imps) ihre Tasks nicht speditiv ab und läuft oft desorientiert herum, was nicht nur ihre Überlebenschancen schmälert, sonder auch Spielfrust beschert. Zudem ist es immernoch schwierig herauszufinden wieso ein Crew-Member gestorben ist, respekive was man hätte dagegen tun können. Rundherum ist alles noch sehr experimentell und das Spiel stürtzt auch gerne mal ab.

The game reminds me a good deal of dwarf fortress in many way. Firstly: You die a lot. Personally speaking, Im frustrated as I can't get a handle on the building which always kills me. Sometimes the humans are machines, making 4 turbines before lunch, other times refusing to build a heater because their cold. Many problems,bug, and preformance issues have been fixed, and I see good potental in this game, but untill  the problems with build order has some sense to it, I can not reccomend it, esspecially at a $25 price

Other Problems:
No way to check colonist skills
Alert system treats skill ups and colonists about to die as the same priority
Build system is rather buggy, and doesn't always make sense. Perhapse an in game tree of what builds what in the workshop?
Having to build wall screens to check atmos and heating doesnt make a lot of sense and is poor gameplay, as sometimes your colonists dont build them in any sort of resonable time.

I routed some new doors through another part of the complex but the colonists just wouldn't build them. So basically everyone on the outside of the hydroponics room starved to death, everyone on the inside died of fatigue because they couldn't make it to the beds.

games just as broken now as before colonists starving rather than building a door to the hydroponics now we have rotots that damage and destroy things is this just an excuse to not blame the AI for not fixing things EA or not ive never known an alpha or beta maybe the state of the colonists  brains are similar to the dev they both have assigned tasks yet they never finish them 

off topic a moment ive just nearly wet myself laughing at the video simon did on youtube about Early access games he makes every excuse to blame the buyers for the old bs brand of ""oh you dont understand what ea is"" dont make me laugh any harder we know what an early release is pity YOU dont know how to make a game fully playable without firstly making cats and dogs over colonist ai tasks and having the downright cheek to say wost thing you did is bring it out on EA on steam oh why is that because EVERYBODY can see it or is it everybody can see the overall ""ratings""

The weather effects are awesome. That being said, I have purchase several games in alpha and beta stages. I have been in invite-only beta tests also. I know what to expect and what not to expect from games in early stages, and this one is terrible. The developer clearly has little idea of what he's doing from a procedural point of view. In the time i've owned this game here's what's happened: several patches have been released, but the big problems haven't been resolved... neat new little content has been added, but with the game unplayable it makes little difference. This game is sure to disappoint over and over again. I waited so long to write this review because I wanted to see if some progress would be made, but it hasn't. The worst part of it is that the developer has had to go off steam (on kickstarter) to continue to raise money. Please save yourself the headache of downloading this game. If you do try to play, here are a few tips.
1) Save often. F5 saves and F9 loads... the icons at the top right also save and load, i'll let you try to figure out which is which
2) The AI is always getting stuck in stupid loops or just shutting down. This happens every few minutes like clockwork... you must save, exit the game, and restart it to continue playing.
3) Things don't update like they should... if you mine ore but can't figure out why it isn't being moved to storage... it's probably AI to blame again... another reload should help.
4) Sometimes things stop working inexplicably, If the airlock breaks and cannot be repaired, you must start a new game. some things can be repaired though, so who knows.
5) Always place two doors on rooms... if the door breaks and needs repair, but your people are inside of the room, and the guys outside the room are too tired to do it and the door that's broken leads to the sleeping area... they might decide not to repair it and instead die from lack of sleep... leaving the others trapped inside to starve
6) Just get in the habit of restarting the game every few minutes
7) Don't bother with research, it causes bugs which basically cause the game to crash beyond a certain point... meaning you'll never get past that point without starting yet another new game.
8) Use windows 7 or vista, and make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card (and by that I mean have a graphics card that uses newer drivers) The dev doesn't like helping with bugfixing if your computer doesn't use the latest drivers, despite the fact that some older cards (like the ones in my windows 7 machine) have old drivers (even if they are the ""most up to date"" they are still like 2 years old) and that still others (like on my windows 8 acer machine) require the use of special drivers provided by the OEM which may not be the ""latest and greatest"".
9) Don't expect too much, this way you won't be disappointed.

Edit: still... don't buy this game. It's on sale, but seriously... you wouldn't play it more than 30 minutes, even if it were free.

UPDATE: 21 May 2015... I'm not sure how it's even possible, but the game is even worse now than it was before.

UPDATE: 1 Sep 2017... Still going to be a negative on the recommendation. I advise staying away from this one a little while longer. The dev has continued on pretty much the same trajectory. New features, new bells and whistles, and failure to address very long-standing issues with the game. It still has graphical glitches everywhere. Sometimes a door will be stuck closed because of power outages, but it will never update. It looks open, but noone can get inside. Upon reloading you'll go ""oh, that's why they weren't building anything... they couldn't get to the workbench"". Sometimes colonists become unresponsive but seem to still be standing around. AI has improved, but not by much. Resolution problems and graphics problems. None of my OTHER games require disabling overlays or nvidia share. None of my other games are affected so horrendously by UI scaling (if you go fullscreen and can't click the buttons, that's probably why... this game hates UI scaling). None of my other games break horribly when my gpu drivers are a couple weeks out of date. The dev is better at writing exuse posts blaming the flaws in his code on everyone else's setup than he is at writing code to fix problems and address issues. The game is not as awful as it was, but at this rate it'll never be a thumbs-up game. In the past couple hours I've only had one crash-to-desktop.",1417234178,1504247094,False,108,0,0.787768006324768066,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Personally, I think that Maia went to Greenlight too early, while there were still too many bugs and issues. But with 0.46 the game is stable and playable for many people and the future promise is just starting to show through. For new players there's probably a solid afternoon of playtime here, plus some replay value. There's no combat yet, but it's planned for the next build (0.47) and I imagine that this will boost re-playability a great deal.

I was initially drawn to Maia by the atmospheric trailers and the potential shown in the very first alpha builds. The aesthetic and design of Maia is fantastic. The art and music combine to create a slightly unsettling, suspenseful atmosphere that's lifted by the numerous little touches of wry humour and observation; many of which are genuinely clever. Hitchhiker's meets Alien.

If Simon and team manage to wrap their unique design around a enjoyable and challenging colony builder then this will definitely be a stand-out title for the future.

Simple: The UI menu is straight out of the 90s, equipped with a load in time of a minute for a selection of 4 choices and a spinning globe. After half a decade of the player base begging and complaining about one of the worst UIs of the 2010 era, the devs have not touched it since day 1. Now, 5-6 years later of development it no longer even functions on some computers, so sorry, as one of those people, I can't even review the game.

5 Years later, I can't even get this POS to start anymore, because the UI is so horrible it puts the start button off-screen and takes multiple ctrl-alt-del restarts to get fixed, which frankly is just not worth it. We went in reverse since last year, but apparently that logically means: ""It's time for release!""

I purchased this game in 2014, in 2016 it was clear the Devs had absolutely no interest in fixing any issues the players were complaining about.

I hope you all are eating crow now, yes the Dev truly didnt care as I said in my 2016, 2017, 2018, and now 2019 review. The game is -still- atrocious.

That said, it shows a lot of promise. I am looking forward to the finished product, when it is released. Judging by the rate of improvement thus far, that should be in the summer of 2029, or thereabouts.

I'd like to recommend it, but I can't. Currently it is simply not an enjoyable experience. In fact, one could argue it is not even a game yet, merely a concept demo. I can't say I regret paying for it, though, as I consider it money well spent in support of the game's development. 

I really do want this to be a good game. Or, failing that, at least a finished game.

Update:
Work continues. Although my colonists and the IMP remain utterly useless. The game is still completely unplayable, as the colonists will be happy to ignore everything you tell them to do, and thus promptly starve, thirst, or choke to death, as everything spontaneously bursts into flames around them for no damn reason.

It took a few goes before I figured out that the robot is accessible, you dont click on it. you click on rock formations and he digs bits of the rock face out and you can then build your colony. No tutorial on how to use him though. Colonists are unuseable, they do what they want to do. 

I have played this a number of times and each time my colonists died of asphyxiation. Every time, even when I build atmosphere generators. This game is currently a no go without a decent tutorial. Its not a game per sae currently, its really a large project in futility and how to kill space colonists off the quickest.

Thumbs down, I bought this knowing it was an early access game and they are stillworking on it, but this ... is embarrassing, It does not hold a candle to Dungeon Keeper. And yes my hours played looks low. Trust me if you have a Vista or earlier made computer this game will crash badly. My hours are lower than what it says above, its included crashes and time i tried tofigure out how to fix it. 

In my humble opinion, wait 6 months then have a look at reviews on here. See if some of the issues have been fixed but there are better things to waste money on than this.

Its a great concept, but the execution is very poor.

I've been patronizing this game's early access since it was available for early access, and while some bugs have been fixed, numerous game-breaking bugs still remain. Its pretty-much unplayable still, despite several months development since its initial release.

Glitches in character AI get them stuck in routines that eventually lead to their deaths. For example, eating and sleeping, repeat et infinitum, while not working on the hyroponics bay. The AI seems to get deadlocked quite a lot. Since the characters start running to the food and then eating, I assume that the value for hunger isn't being reset properly.

There are also animation problems that seem to somehow reflect character position. Character position in the world should not be a function of the 3D engine. The location of objects should be purely data, which is then rendered. The reason why I suspect this isn't the case in Maia is because characters ""jump"" back, particularly after a collision with a wall. Yes - they walk into walls and then teleport back a few steps. So the pathfinding is bad too. I think this is because the objects in the world are not on a real ""grid"" system. While rooms might be, everything else seems to be kinda ""free-floating"" and placable anywhere in the room / outside. While this would be cool, it doesn't work right, so its not cool.

Also the object rotation system is very annoying. It would be much better if there were a ""spin by increment"" key prior to object placement. And objects can intersect eachother, which makes no sense.

Additionally 6 mo after launch there's still no save / load system. The game still starts with invalid start conditions (breaches in the base start point to the outside world makes colonists unable to move around in the cavern without space suits, and the airlock is on the other side of the base). There is no way to make a new game without exiting to desktop and starting the game over. The settings are very minimal, and there are enormous problems with resolution. You click and it changes, in a cycle, rather than selecting from a menu. This is terrible because it saves the last setting, and there's no ""does this resolution work for you?"" dialog. This means you can get yourself into unusable settings and be unable to get out.

Also the game performance is really quite bad.

Meanwhile the creators are adding content while there are still problems with the fundamental mechanics of the game. I wonder if they understand how unusable the game is right now....",1412563797,1412563797,False,51,0,0.670086443424224854,2,True,False,True,False,,,

Old review below.  Was positive. (4/10/2014)


READ BEFORE YOU THINK THIS IS A PURELY POSITIVE REVIEW!!

I normally don't like to review games this early on because I really don't think it's fair to either the consumer or the devs to do so at this stage.  However I think a good number of the of the reviews have been a bit unfair.  A lot of the reviews aren't taking into account how early this game really is in development.  Yes that is the fault of the devs for jumping the gun, and putting it on the market, however the game does show a lot of progress, and it's a really good concept.  It is extremly buggy at the moment but that's to be expected of any early access game.  That's why I'm not considering the bugs in this review but I'm focusing on the content.  The devs have done a good job of keeping this game as a more realistic survival/ managment game, and that's nice to see, since it's not really something that has been done that much.  

HOWEVER! I don't write reveiws for the sake of the devs, but for the sake of the customer.  This game is a big risk!  It's very hard to tell how this game is going to turn out at this stage since it's in such a raw state.  I myself think that it's going to turn out well, and that's why I'm giving a positve review.  However unless you're a risk taker I would advise that you hold off for a little while before you buy this game, and keep an eye on it from afar.",1412447503,1506768314,False,0,0,0.483914881944656372,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Update 18/11/2018

If you're only going to read one part of this then here it is in a nutshell: In my first section of the review I say that I couldnt get colonists to build a hopper. No matter what I did. It is 4 years later and I STILL cannot get them to build a hopper.

Although there have been a number of improvements there are still so many situations where the AI Just simply doesnt work. From not deconstructing things to having colonists die and being unable to have more ""dropped down"" to you even when the timer hits zero. Having so many chickens in the livestock but none of your colonists will kill them even when theyre marked to be killed. Having colonists rush and build new items yet the leave items that are waiting to be built since the start of the game which leads to the error saying no path found to workshop even though it says when you place it the placement is perfectly fine and you build another workshop with more tables and they still cant build it. 

All in all this is early access but at the same time this game has had these issue since it was first put onto steam back in 2013... its now 2018... and after 5 years I can honestly say that there have been improvements but these improvements over the space of 5 years simply do not constitute a $24.99 USD pricetag when there are games that are the same price and A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER and fully released even after being developed on steam early access AFTER this game started development. A great example of this is subnautica.

I credit the dev team of this game to sticking with it in the long run as this is what a development team should do for an early access title. Taking a look at the feedback and continuing to improve on the game. However, I am honestly am at a point where after purchasing the game a few years ago I simply have no interest in it whatsoever anymore and honestly feel as though from this point onwards I consider this to be a failed project and do not think I will continue to update this review as I will no longer be playing it.

NOTE: I do not see this is a waste of money for me, I purchased the title because I was interested in it and wanted to see it develop further and sometimes these ""investments"" dont pay off and this is an example of that.

Update 17/01/2018

Let me start off by saying I honestly cant tell you if you will like this game or not... why? because I dislike it so much that I simply cannot find anything I enjoy. so here is just some input I have after playing the game for the first time since 2016. You wil notice there are 2 other review sections and each is from experience playing the game. the first is from September of 2014 (initial purchase) and the second is from August 2016 (return two years later to check progress).


As it stands the developers have removed quite a few bugs from the game and i praise them for that but to put things simply... they just havn't done anywhere near enough. This game has been in Early access for how long now? and to be perfectly honest there are a lot of games that START in early access in a better state then this game is at this point in time.  I honestly would be happy to say to the development team to focus their efforts on a new game. One that has a roadmap more refined and clear targets to be  set as this game is stuck in its own little development hell.

Now for some gameplay. In terms of the fundamentals its all pretty much there, buggy, but its there so you can play the game, however, the execution, feel and controls just dont make a lot of sense, the UI feels clunky and out of place and there just isnt any polish at all (which is soughta understandable for an early access title). There is not enough information given to the player a lot of the time or its just presented in such a way that it seems really childish (for a game about colonizing space... this just kills the whole ""vibe"" and with popups just being annoying as hell on their own.... not to mention some are just stupid. Like honestly... you're colonizing another planet... WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU MAKING MUSIC THAT YOU WANT ME TO HEAR..... you dont even have a damn atmospheric generator at the start.....

++++++++++
After purchasing a new monitor and attempting to play this game not only did i realise it doesnt support widescreen but that the features being added to this game seem totally pointless. I feel like I am playing a game from the early 2000 with features still in development. Seriously... its been so long now, HOW CAN CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS STILL BE A PART OF TESTING. Bugs are everywhere (including just trying to change graphical settings) and the gameplay is outdated to say the least. If steam had the refund option when i purchased this. I would have refunded it on the spot
+++++++++++


++++++++++
So a new patch has come out which for me, has been the biggest improvement since the beginning. I have actually managed to build a base! WOOHOO!! :D There is a bug that still occurs where the human AI get stuck and end up dying from starvation but I hope that this will be fixed soon!
++++++++++


This game COULD be great. But what lets it down most of all is the AI (A CORE MECHANIC OF THE GAME). For a game that has been in Alpha for almost a year now the AI is STILL SHOCKING to the point where the game is virtually still unplayable. 

People and the IMP get ""stuck"" and dont move leaving you to restard or watch them die.
The people don't build certain things even when they should be able to (For example I have NEVER been able to build a hopper, it just sits there unbuilt for countless amounts of time)
I've had people die from exhaustion because they refuse to build a bed.....

I have only played 4.4hrs of the game and watched tutorials on how to get people to do things but nothing ever works. this game needs a serious overhal becuase as it stands, I WARN YOU NOT TO BUY IT",1411626685,1542509567,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,True,False,,,

Thing is they have less funding than some other games and I just hope it's enough to complete it..

Very upsetting as the game looks like it would be so much fun.  However it constantly glitches out either the screen blacks out or the the characters simply stop doing anything at all.  
would be nice to be able to go back to the main menu as well to start a game over but you cant you have to comply close the game and relaunch to start over once your colonist are dead.  mine seem to continue to die because they cant keep a build order in order or build the things I want them to build when I direct them too.  Im guessing since this game came out almost a year ago and is still having these sorts of problems its probably not going to get better.  Which is a shame because I love the game concept and think that this could be alot of fun.  But right now im feeling completely ripped off especially with it being so much.

Ok so simon has evidently been putting in some work as Maia is atleast playable now!

Despite a new update, this game is still woefully unintuitive, with a clunky and underwhelming UI that had me doing things like accidentally deleting my airlock when i was trying to clear / unbind the current tool from my cursor (you know, where games would usually let you right click to stop doing a thing). 

It also still heavily, HEAVILY punishes people that don't know what they're doing. It will not give you reminders or UI feedback on what you're doing (for example, if you want to expand a room? nope, no idea what to do there), and gives you no hints if you're trying to do something wrong. 

The tutorial is still effectively the same since it was first implemented, and even though it has been 6 months since I last played the game, it still moves at a glacial pace, and still does not help you adequately navigate the hopeless UI. 

This game, as far as I'm concerned, is still an alpha AT BEST, which is a shame, because as you can read below, I had such high hopes for it. 

Sorry, Simon, but you should cut your losses or get some help with this game, because it REALLY needs other peoples perspectives. Particularly on the early game to new or long returning players. 

That said, if you enjoy bashing your head against walls while you try and figure out whats going on, having to restart a lot through trial and error, then you might just like this game. 

Edit: Update as of 29th April 2020 (4 and a half years later). The developer has become disenfranchised by the amount of work required to fix this game, and basically released this game from EA, bugs and all. The game works, and if you're lucky you wont suffer any of the game breaking bugs regularly, but don't expect to be lucky. Simon (the developer) moved on to a new game because Maia was not earning enough money for him.  

Maia is yet another cautionary tale of early access buy-ins, and it joins the like of Towns, Starbase DF-9 and games of their ilk that were abandoned, only to be picked up with half-hearted effort whenever the developer can be bothered.

Shame, it had so much potential, as you can see below in my earlier reviews. 

Edit: Update as of 4th Nov 2015, original review below for posterity and because it still has some valid points. The aforementioned save system works fine now, the game is a lot more stable, and has many more features and content. The AI pathing and priorities are still buggy, but the developer is working on them. 

The caveat at the bottom still applies, but there is more substance to the game now. Considering it was up until recently a one man dev team, its at least a good effort. Worth peeking at if you can get it on a 50% or more sale, not recommended at full price unless you're a big fan of the game concept and know what you're getting into.

---------------------------------------------------

A neat game with a good concept, but is nowhere near playable in any respect YET. Currently (as of 19th June 2014) the game lacks such features as working save system, game stability, solid AI pathing, room code management and much more. 

With more funding/staff or time this game can be amazing, but right now? Don't even.

As of current version I recommend this game, with a HUGE caveat; Know what you're getting into: An unfinished, very early alpha of what could possibly be a great game. If you trust the developers wont get sick of the game and run off with the money (anyone remember Towns?) then give it a go and see. If you want a fully functioning game, keep it on the wishlist and wait until it gets out of early access.",1405818416,1611361078,False,0,0,0.494291931390762329,0,True,False,True,False,,,

(first review 2014)
I cant wait for it to be a full game ! 
Even if its buggy right now and you can laugh at very much its like a space game I have always wanted. 
It sometimes did crash but still I wanted to restart it and keep going and try more stuff. 
See how long I could make people survive, it reminds me of a lot of different games I loved when I was younger. 
The diging to find resorces like dungeon keeper, and the way you want to take care of people like Theme hospital (lol that game.) And u want ur crew to be safe and defend them like in evil genius.

リリースから1年過ぎ、どれどの位遊べるようになったかな？とプレイしてみたが
何も変わっていなくて唖然とした

I can see ""Dungeon-Keeper"" and ""Evil-Genius'"" trade mark right there and perhaps the ""The Sims"" as well.

I've only managed to get as far as  sussesfully adding a Workshop room with two of three Work-Desks and Two Working Lights before the Robot who digs the rooms out just froze and then started to move around in small circles depsite being given orders to dig out another room. It's the only thing in this game that can do this. Apart from retreive the rocks, rubble and other detrius from where he deposited after digging. Not much else could be done beyond this.

According to what I had been intructed to do in order to continue playing the game. I had to build a work shop with a desk and a light. 3 by 3 squares is the mnimum size requirement. For starters.

Thw rokshop is need to be built first before anything else can be done.

In previous gaming session, I had tried to make bigger rooms and had marked out acouple of them to be cleared as well as trying to furnish the other rooms as well  as outside. This was mistake. Evryhting should be done slowly and sectiojn by section or else pople start dying (Aphyxiation or Mal-nourishment.)and they need to be replaced and the robot just stops moving. Refusing to do anything. On two occsions, he got caught between the wall where it had been digging and the wall of the room that had been built by the human working on top of him. So, I need to be careful to let the robot do what it can first before the humans  perform their duties.

I think this needs to be addressed.

I might add a video later.

Looking forward to the finished product.

I can tell you that it has sat on my wishlist for quite some time before I bought it during the sale. I have watched with some interest as the game has developed. Having now, albeit briefly, played it for myself I can say that - in it's current state I cannot in any good conscience recommend this to my friends in its current state.

That's not to say that Maia hasn't got potential, it certainly has. But the fulfilment of that potential is a long, long way off.

The most glaring shortfall here is the staggeringly poor optimisation. All early access excuses aside, this is a game that is charging almost £20 to get players to poke around at what is currently available - the scope of which is very limited, and in my opinion, not especially fun either - for that money I would have expected that the game engine would be in some sort of state that was reasonably optimised for the very broad range of system builds that comes from PC customers. Whilst the game is not unplayable, it's always irksome when a system that vastly exceeds the recommended spec splutters along at 12 frames per second, like some elderly man with a cold. 

The second issue I had was with the minimalist UI. This is subjective and some people will like it, but for whatever it's worth, I didn't. Having to blindly cycle through construction options using 1-9 and B and V felt unintuitive and was something I can't ever see myself getting used to. That being said, I liked the way I could place items pretty much wherever the hell I wanted in a room, that felt smooth and comfortable to get along with.

Another thing that struck me was the very sparce tutorial. Alright, alright, so it's not rocket science this and for the majority of people, there isn't much that is going to need explaining, you can figure stuff out just by playing around with the game, plus it's an alpha, I have yet to see a game in it's alpha state that has a fully fleshed out tutorial. Nonetheless, I feel that the areas covered by the tutorial were hastily put together, and not especially informative.

Whilst i'm on the subject of tutorials, the dialogue. Being British myself, I 'get' that whoever wrote the tutorial was attempting  to create the lofty humour of a smug, arrogant ai. However. At the early stages of the game, it's a bit jarring, and doesn't lend itself well to imparting knowledge. Those of you who played Frozen Synapse may remember the tutorial and it's deeply condescending dialogue. That worked for two reasons: 1. It was offset by a more pleasant dialogue as a counter and 2. It was voice acted so it felt like a infinitesimally intelligent ai and not, in the case of Maia, simply the developers quietly sneering at it's customers. In this instance it comes across as not only churlish, and dare I say, a little rude, but also because of it's delivery, entirely misses the target of being funny.

Another bone of contention was that there was no feedback to see what was being worked on. Not being one to build one thing at a time, I slapped down a load of stuff and waited. It was hard to tell whether people were working on something, or just running around like lunatics. Another thing is that I had very little feedback on what it was that my colonists needs were at any given time, it would be nice to be able to see a general overview of that at a glance.

Maia might be a good game one day if it's devs stick to the plan and don't get too lost in the woods on the way, but it's a long was off that chequered flag, and at this juncture there really is no guarantees that it will be good in the end. My enthusiasm has certainly been significantly dowsed by playing the game in it's current state, and I have to say, I regret paying the money, but you never know, maybe i'll have gotten a good deal in the long run, only time will tell at this point. Only really worth investing if you really have an overwhelming desire to support the developer or have an incredibly optimistic disposition. Elsewise, wait and see.

Ce jeu à quelque chose de plaisant, bien sûr, il n'est encore qu'au début de l'alpha et le jeu contient très peu de chose, mais il est assez plaisant de regardé les gens travailler,

mais on se rend vite compte que le jeu n'est pas amical envers l'utilisateur en ce qui à trait au commande,

il est impossible de configurer les touche que l'on veut utilisé, chaque personne à ces touche qu'il préfère utilisé dans tout les jeux, ce qui rend le jeu asser déplaisant et frustrant quelque fois, comme nos petite manie d'utilisé nos touche habituel pour le déplacement de la caméra par example, je me trompe de touche à toute les fois, vraiement pas amicaux comme système d'interface...

les ""FPS"" ont des problème, le jeu est souvent sacadé,

le petit robot, le ""Wimp"" je crois, il lui arrive souvent de tourner autour des resources, d'essayer de les prendre et ne réussi pas, il va donc au prochain tas de ressource et ne réussi pas à le prendre, il va donc à l'autre tas de ressource et... ainsi de suite, il peut faire le tour de 50 ou 60 tas avant de ce décider d'en prendre un,

il lui arrive aussi quelque fois de rester à un endroit et de ne rien faire, il faut donc relancer le jeu pour qu'il ce mette en mouvement, ainsi que certain personnage...

pour ce qui est de nos colons, il ont une appetit de loup, il passe tout leur temp à manger et à boire, en moin de deux heure il avait déja tout mangé...

pour ce qui est de la construction, le jeu étant encore en alpha, il n'y à vraiement pas beaucoup de chose à construire, et pour ce qui est du l'agencement des pièce construite, de mon côté je suis bloqué, il nous est impossible de déplassé le sas de départ, il est impossible de le démonter ou d'en créer d'autre, ce qui rend le 3/4 de la carte innacessible, puisqu'on ne peut pas créer d'autre sas, donc impossible de faire d'autre sas sous d'autre montagne, ou de faire un sas de l'autre côté de notre montagne pour y aller...

il y à un gros problème avec les pièces principale qui existe au début du jeu, même si on peut défaire la première pièce ou l'on peut ranger le matériel, il est impossible de déplaçer le matériel, comme la nourriture restante ou les barils d'eau, ce qui rend l'endroit impossible à utilisé à d'autre fin même si on détruit la pièce...

le jeu à de beau graphiques, mais presque aucun sons pour l'instant, hologramme des objets avant le placement très mal fait, impossible de dire ce qui est le devant du derriere de l'objet, utilisation d'un système par point qui remonte à la programmation sous le système d'exploitation ""dos"",

les écriture qui apparaissent à l'écran sont presque illisible, tout est en vert pâle, une des pire couleur à utilisé dans un environement éclairé, il faut donc bouger la caméra pour essayer de trouver un coin sombre pour essayer de lire...

bref c'est un jeu qui est quand même plaisant, mais que je trouve présentement surévaluer au niveau du prix, pour ce qu'il offre pour l'instant, c'est un alpha que j'évaluerais plus autour de 10$ et non 25$, mais bon, ce n'est pas le premier alpha à ce surévaluer, beaucoup on cette mani, l'attrait de l'argent sans doute ha ha ha..., mais bon ça reste mon opinion...,

si vous désirer l'acheter, je ne le recomande pas au prix de 25$, dans son état actuel...,

pour ma part disons que comme c'est un jeu de création, trop peu d'option son offerte pour la création, et que la création de pièces peut être problématique, dans mon cas ma créativité est bloqué, causé par le manque d'option et de réarangement des pièces et des objet que l'on ne peut déplacé...,

pour l'instant c'est plus un petit jeux de passe temps, mais il ne faut pas trop utilisé notre créativité car l'on sera vite bloqué par tout ça...

mais le concept est interessant et le jeu semble avancé vraiement très lentement, mais peut-être que dans quelque année nous pourons laisser notre imagination fonctionné...

je ne recommande pas ce jeu comme je l'ai dis à cause de son prix trop élevé pour la qualité offerte, mais je le recommande si les gens peuvent l'avoir à prix moindre pour encouragé le créateur, car il semble faire son possible, et si vous aimer ce style de jeu, car bien que ce qu'il offre soit peu, il reste quand même interessant, mais ne le prener pas trop à coeur pour l'instant, car les ""bugs"" vous rammenerons à la raison asser vite ha ha ha",1403273958,1403273958,True,9,0,0.601989626884460449,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Colonist AI routinely craps itself and either stops building anything any more (lucky version) or you just get a colonist going catatonic in the airlock and never moving any more (more usual version.) And when you do get it to work for half an hour, it will prioritize the hilariously wrong thing, like everyone keeping repairing the doors instead of building the air purifier.

Now that might be palatable (not really) in a game where you can direct them around, like in The Sims, and the AI only keeps them alive in between. But here you can't direct them, and the WHOLE premise is that they do their own thing, a broken AI just means a broken game.

Etc.

Really, it has no excuse to be released at this early and dysfunctional stage. It may eventually be worth playing. Save your money for then.

Update for 0.44: 

Upon starting the game, I proceeded to place the workshop and dig a small tunnel to one side, and a 4x4 tile hole there. Partially because you NEED minerals, and partially because I needed somewhere to place the hydroponics bay. I must stress that I wasn't digging some grand ballroom hall, and I was mindful that it has plenty of all rock walls on all sides, because I did read the update notes about earthquakes. When that was about half-way dug, the ceiling promptly collapsed, squashing the only digger robot and two of four colonists, who were there to take minerals.

So basically, instead of fixing the existing problems, it just added a random ""*BANG* you're dead!"" event, the hallmark of incompetent game design. Yippee.

Well, regardless of how you personally feel about that kind of events, to my mind it just further illustrated the point of why shouldn't you buy a game that's not even in alpha yet: you don't know what you're going to get for your money. The kind of gameplay elements that the final mix will have can just as well be what you like, or what you hate, and there's no way to know which it will be, as there doesn't even seem to be any plan.",1401305186,1409653067,False,139,1,0.744381427764892578,7,True,False,True,False,,,

I am NOT gonna Recomment this game.. The game developer startet out with wanting 18 euroes for the game witch was more than enough for the game as it were. Now the game is up to a staggering 22 euroes!! and thats for a game that dosnt even work probaly.. The developer is just too greedy.. At the games present state i´d say its no more than 12 euroes worth at the very best.. 8 euroes if you wanna be fair about it... DO not support the developer in this greedy project that has nothing to show for it.. sure its ok Graphics got somne good features in it... but the game crashes all the time.. colonists die all of the sudden for no apparent reason and the list goes on.. DO NOT BUY!!!

Off too.. even with only about 90 minuts of playtime i can already now say that this game needs alot fo work before it is playable.. 

Before i go further i´d like to say that i really think this game have potential and that is the reason i recomment it.. However

Even with only 90 minut of playtime i experienced several major issues that makes this game unplayable in its current state..

1: Game crashes to windows on a frequent basis for unknown reasons.. I have 12GB DDR3 Rams a Radeon 6950 HD 3D graphics card with 2GB intergrated GDDR5 rams and an i7 8 Core processor.. i KNOW my computer is not the issue. witch leaves the coding of the game as the problem.. This is something the developers needs to adress Assap if they want any success in keeping this concept alive.. 

2: The game seems to slow down when you open a mail from one of the colonists.. this would be completely okay if it was not for the fact that sometimes the game stays in slowmotion and there is nothing you can do about it other thanm restart the game witch brings us to problem number 3.. 

3: The game seriously needs a save game option.. The crashes = start a new. The game bugs out on you = start a new
The game freezes = start a new.. so on and so on..  you get to play like 10-20 minuts at a time and the game halts for one reason or another.. and then you have to start from scratch again cause there was no Save option.. 

4: Another thing that can make the game very heavy to play or even unplayable is the introduction to windpower mills.. As soon as i placed a couple of those and the game started to slow down.. The more machines i put down the slower the game became.. untill i at last gave up and quit.. 

There is probably more than what i have written here.. and as i said to begin with i would recomment it.. It is up to you guys out there considering to play this game wether you wanna support a alpha version that have ALOT of work still there needs to be done.. My personal oppinion is that 18 Euro is way too much for a game that hardly work yet Developers needs to make some drastic changes to the game coding if they want this game to be successful.. Each day that g oes by without changes i highlighted will be another nail in its coffin..",1399575691,1401186985,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Now the game has come out while I am in college. Was it worth the wait?

Yes and no. Maia is a game definitley with a lot of style but perhaps not enough substance. The game looks great, has a awesome retro futuristic style, and is engaging enough with its development of the colony. Considering how it was all made by one person over several years, its impressive Simon got this far. It feels nice to slowly build up your under ground base and the cheeky humor keeps things lively. The sound effects also remind me quite a lot of system shock 2, which is a big plus in my book. The missions give a lot of structure to the game, more so than the generic sandbox mode does and the dialogue is engaging enough, albiet a bit bland. 

However the game has its issues. It doesnt have the in game longevity one could hope for or enough substance in what can be built and done after 5-8 hours. Not enough interesting dynamics or systems exist like seen in Rim World to keep the moment to moment interesting enough. The game is still missing features promised early in development and probably could of done with some of those extra stretch goals that didnt come to fruition. 

Even the fauna could have used more. Theres only three alien types and they dont look really ""alien"" at all. Im rather dissapointed by how boring and sparse the aliens are.The threat posed by the world was over stated and a bit dissapointing. Furthermore the games missions are often vague and the game with holds critical information from you in non sensical ways. They could have done with a far more traditional UI and control scheme. I encountered my fair share of bugs too that made doing certain missions impossible with cheating. 

TLDR; Maia is a pretty game with a lot of cool style and engagment but in the long run this doesnt make up for its lack of substance and other issues. If you ask me this is probably more of a beta than anything. That said its cheaper than Rim World and despite its issues is hardly a bad time. Just dont go in with too high expectations. Still I want to congragulate and thank Simon for sharing his awesome dream with us.

Its a very good insight into what will possibly happen but as it stands right now it is nothing more than a tech demo. There is no save game feature and you cannot progress any further than what you start off with. Basically its a colony game without colonists or any form of expansion.

What is currently in the game is a handful of objects for a handful of rooms. A couple of those objects have an unknown function and nothing is really explained about the objects or indeed the colonists that you have. There is no way to get any more colonists as of yet and pretty much as soon as you build all the rooms and fill them with items you have acheived all that you can.

The graphics are pretty good and although it has some clunky animations and is still rather buggy it will no doubt be polished quite nicely. It DOES have the potential to go far but even compared to other early access titles it just doesn't have enough content to even class as a game yet. Its simply a tech demo.

Keep it on a watch/wish list and get it when its at a game like state.

EDIT: As per the developers response you CAN save the game using keys F5 and subsequently using F9 will load your last save. Again this is obviously an unfinished feature but its a lot better than starting from fresh all the time!

I wasn't really planning to ever really try this game out again or have really thought about it at all. However the dev reply to my review(which you can read at the bottom) and I felt obligated to at least give it try again. I mean it has been almost four years so it has to improved somewhat in this amount of time.


So launching the game brings me back to when I first played this in 2013. The menu screen is the same. Which is very limited, you got ""Launch"", ""Settings"", and ""Abort"". I am a big fan of having the ablilty to select/adjust a wide veriety of Game Options and Settings. With this game as a ""BETA' now. I expected that you can do a lot more with more information available to you. My expectation was fully crushed. The UI is simple, too simple that it makes it very annoying to change any of the settings. It's set up as something you would see in a console game ten years ago. You have to toggle through everything first to know what is available to you and then toggle again to your choice. Of course toggling the different textures crashes the game. The only ""Auditory""(audio, why not just name it Audio and keep it simple?) option is to turn music on/off.

The game itself looks the same as before and there is a little more information than before during gameplay. However the UI just makes it really annoying. Everything just pops up on your screen overlaying the game with that old school green text. Since it just overlay your live game it makes it very difficult to read. You end up not wanting to read it and just click ""Y"" over and over again to close them out. Also the building controls are not thought out well. To build different areas you have to toggle 1-9 to select the type of area you want to build then select the ground. Why not have a build menu? or at least just make it where you build a basic zone/structure and then select what that desinated zone will be. Which then the colonist just modify it to said type. Everything is just too simple that it makes it unproductive and hinders your gameplay. BUT! its okay you have a pet dog, you are only barely surviving so having a dog before a way to feed yourselves is important.

Right now, with what the game is currently I could not reconmend this game to my friends. Maybe in another four years, it will improve enought that I will enjoy MAIA and be able to tell others the same. Okay so this is my original review back in 26Dec2013


Maia is sci-fi strategy simulation game by Simon Roth. The game is currently in Alpha however it seems to be very pre-alpha at the moment. The game has a lot of potential but is lacking a few features right now. One of the biggest issues I have seen is the ability to save, right now there is no saving feature. With that, it doesn’t matter how far you have progress, in the end you have to start over again. There are a few glitches where your Colonist and Robot worker will ether stop working or would not complete tasks assign to them. The tutorial of the game is very limited but having them pop up is the annoying part.

The good thing is that if they brought out updates and improvement it might become a great game. However, so far it has been 22 days since the steam launch and it has had zero updates so far. If that changes or the game get better I may have to come back and change my review. This review is based on what is available during this stage of the alpha.",1388130783,1508685766,False,11,0,0.519394636154174805,3,True,False,True,False,,,

Still an early Access game at this point, and now apparently abandoned.

MAIA is rough. Still ""Alpha"" rough. 

There's great potential here, but I'm rather hesitant to recommend a game this unpolished and unfinished to anyone. For now, I'd advise waiting, and returning when the team delivers that final software.

However...

If you're willing to tolerate the slow pace of development necessitated by the small team, then I do really think that there's a gem on the way here. It's still early days, but the game has come a long way since I first played it in 2013, and the development team has continued to roll out updates, including feature additions and bugfixes indicative of ongoing long-term development and support.

As long as you understand that you're getting in on an alpha, this might be worth a look. Just recognize that it's not a finished product yet, and given the pace of development will not be ready for that final rollout for some time, if ever.",1387415604,1576313889,False,0,0,0.492585897445678711,13,True,False,False,False,,,

It is wrong for STEAM to already allow this game under an early-access program.  It will take months, if not a year before anything stable comes out of this, and that is assuming the developer(s?) will continue work on this.

Its graphics look good and it features a nice and clean interface. Also the approach of you looking down on your colonists as though your an central AI or commander behind a set of security cameras give a real nice overall feel to the game.

Again, this is very early in its development, but with the planned game mechanics this should prove to be...interesting to say the least.

REVISIT 28-08-2020:

So, I don't know what happened during development, but basic things such as changing display resolutions completely ruin the game and I haven't even played it because it is impossible when the main menu buttons are waaaay off screen in lower resolutions. This is a thing I always check for because it seems trivial, but it determines how much respect the developer has for lower end machine owners and sets the bar for anything that follows from that. It is really simple; If you choose not to ask for available display modes and instead decide to limit the game to a specific set, at least make sure it actually works on those settings. I can deal with full lists with every available display mode and then have GUI elements disappear off screen, since that's easily solved in a patch or update, even after leaving EA. But to have this happen in a strict set of settings and still not get it right...that's just flat out wrong and the idea of text-editing a config.xml to resolve these GUI issues is 'BloodyShoddyLookingIfYouAskMe' (reference to the lowest texture mode available; It's actually called THAT).

What also rubs me the wrong way is changing settings are applied immediately, even though there is an 'apply' button at the bottom. I have to wait for the game to unload textures and load new textures when changing detail levels. That is fine, but do that when clicking the 'apply' button, that's what that means. Also, tell the user WHY the cursor isn't moving, none of the buttons work anymore and show a loading bar to tell the user how long it takes (approximately) before control is returned.

These are just 2 examples of very basic things right from the onset that just make sense and don't frustrate the user needlesly before even starting the game.

When starting the game for the first time, one is offered a tutorial. Following the instructions to the letter, not only did I manage to start a fire (unintentionally), but also stopped any future progress by building a workshop with a door and a workbench...since the game doesn't actually mark these objectives as reached... Missing the completion of an objective is pretty trivial if it is done every second or so, but it should never cause a game to become unplayable afterwards. Most games solve this issue by doing exactly that; Check it regularly, meaning within reasonable time but not so often that it will crash the game, and mark it completed once all the conditions have been met. Then never ever check back again unless it is a repeating objective. Again, this is one of those simple things that should not be a big deal; You (the computer) knows where to draw a workshop, door and workbench, so you know that they exist, so tick the bloody boxes already. If not this frame, then at least anywhere within the next 60 frames (means it should still be ticked after a second at most).

I'll be checking this game further over the next day or so, but I won't add (I hope) to this anymore lest I risk this becoming a 'what to watch for when making a game' tutorial... As it stands right now, these things are 'BloodyShoddyLookingIfYouAskMe' (sry for repeating that, but it just fits somehow)...",1386885987,1598572475,False,0,0,0.504362106323242188,0,True,False,True,False,,,

If you buy now you will be waiting to a possible mid next year to really say I can play this game now.

I regret Maia more than any other useless, unplayable purchase in the dark history of Early Access. Maia is absolutely beneath what's acceptable to release as an EA game. It does not even meet the minimum bar of quality for paid alphas.

As of this updated review, you're still paying for an extremely limited demo sandbox where you can place objects and watch animations happen. The setting can't decide whether it wants to be a realistic simulator (vital statistics on each colonist, food/water/atmosphere required for survival) or a complete joke (giant fuzzy extraterrestrial life). 

User interface design is not good, and it's difficult to tell what each control does. The current main controls for Maia are a series of badly documented hotkeys. One of the only good new features: you can skip the tutorial now.

But if you take one thing away from this review: the bugs are [i]show-stoppingly[/i] bad. I've experienced sudden framerate slowdowns on both Mac and PC, as well as crashes-to-desktop for no discernable reason. The colonist and robot AI will get stuck in walls or stand next to piles of rubble on no notice. There appears to be very little QA before each release, and minimal progress in fixing the crash bugs since I wrote my last review in 2013 December.

Summer 2015 Update: It still sucks. I'm not even going to sugar-coat this. It crashes and freezes even more than it did last year, and there's still no resource management or objectives to speak of. They literally just added more framerate-drop-inducing wildlife.

Maia isn't worth paying for and probably never will be. I used to think something good might come of it eventually, but after more than a year and a half I've lost all hope.

Summer 2016 Update: Still pretty unstable. They finally made time to fix a few bugs.

I last left a review / played this game about 3 years ago. I had many issues with the game then. This time around, the same applied. Still having issues with features of the game working.

Here is a list of things I had trouble with during my 4 hour playthrough (which is also up on my Twitch/YT Gaming/Hitbox/Beam profiles):
- Colonists move incredibly slow and thus, progressing through a game is excrutiatingly slow.
- Placing items/rooms is difficult. I had mined out the rocks between my initial default space and the empty space nearby and I hit a bug in which, I couldn't place any type of room in the given empty space.
- During the first mission I had to repeatedly find a new place to setup the microwave transmitter. The transparent showing of the object would be green, assuming to me it was a good position to place the transmitter, but then when placed that ghost object would be red. 
- Double clicking to prioritize jobs works some of the time I feel. I had the transmitter, some atmos gens and meat trolleys prioritized, but they were not taken care of in time and I failed the mission or my colonists died.
- I would like to see smarter AI...If I have my storage room setup with atmos gen and a small heater...I'd kinda expect them to hang out in there most of the time instead of venturing into other parts of the base to then die from cold exposure or asphyxiation.
- I had 2 or 3 crash to desktops as well during my 4 hour playthrough.

After trying out this game again, I still cannot recommend anyone to pick this up. I'm sure that Simon is the only one developing this game and it has got to be tough, but I am no happier playing now than I was 3 years ago.

One thing to keep in mind is that this game is in alpha. Now I know a lot of people go, ""Oh I'm a software developer, I know what alpha is! This isn't it!"" Those people are dumb and probably liars because, hey, this is the internet. So from a completely normal, non-developer girl: This game is in alpha. It's obviously in alpha. It is not feature complete. There is very little in the way of UI and things people expect to be there (like cancelling orders for objects) are not there.

But the concept is there. You can see things working. You can ooh and aah at the pretty graphics because they do look really freaking nice. One thing you can't do is play much. You can't save. Why? It's in alpha. Alphas are not feature complete. They lack many things we've grown used to and honestly take for granted in games. The developer isn't lying to you. They aren't tricking you. They're being very honest that the game is very deep in development. It says that right there on the tin.

So if you don't want to see and experience a slice of game development, if you can wait and be patient, or if you hate bugs and incomplete UI... Then don't invest in this right now. If you can't wait, if you like to see a game grow and change, or if you want to help with development then do invest in it.

The stability of the game has greatly improved, but still not perfect, although this is to be expected with a game still in Alpha (0.57 currently). Just a few short notes below.

The game has not advanced much since 2013, and is still very barebones, the AI of the “colonists” and robots still requires a lot of work, with perhaps a system of prioritisation within the AI or user set. Examples are things like, building an item and getting “trapped” by the item, or temperature problems, but they will not build a heater when requested, the robot trying to complete non-existent build orders and refusing to do anything else, although these things are not my main worry about this game.

My main concern is that in the past two and a half years there has been very little progress and brings me to wonder if it will ever achieve release worthy standard.


--5th of December 2013----------
Keep clear for now, this is not worth being on Early Access. The constant crashing and memory errors that are being experienced by owners should be a clear warning to others.

--18th October 2016----------------------
Avoid this buggy, poor product, awkward interfacee, horrible control scheme, with a just painful method of placing items in the world.

Over 3 years and still an unplayable heap.

Throughout teh years many games about colony survival hit the games market and only a couple gained a place in our memories. e.g. Outpost, Space Colony, Startopia. But, most of those games are lost in the vast endless space of cybernet.

So, how able is Maia in obtaining a place amongst our memory?

At this point, it's a buy and forget game. Not because of the way it looks, it's probably one the best looking colony survival games out there, but because of the way it tries to create an atmosphere. 
I don't know exactly why, but something is missing.. The feeling of survival. Why should I build s**t if I don't care. Why should I research things if I don't see the point in doing so.
This is probably because of the lack of any solid plot and future goal that keeps me interested.
Yea, sure, my goal is to survive. Yea, whatever, I'm playing a game, I want some glittering prices along the way and some motivation to do some crazy things. I'm playing a game to escape the dull side of reality, so please, don't show me my daily struggle. 
In other words, we need a good Visual Novel style content / plot / story. We need interesting characters and social dillema's.

If Maia is able to provide us with those things in the near future, well, in that case we might have ourselves a winner.
But, as long as it stays the way it is (Bugs not taken into account) it's a dull experience.
