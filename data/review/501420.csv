Edit on July 31st, 2016:
Okay, fun's over. Since no one else has reviewed it (at the time of writing), I'm giving it the recommendation it *should* have. It's a bad game. I know this, and you know this. Little to do, music is grating, models and environment just aren't appealing. I also actually got stuck behind one of the ""mountains"" because I accidentally teleported too far past it and couldn't teleport back. Only way to get back at this point is to delete my save, not that I'd be losing much to begin with.

Also, I recieved it for free as a joke gift. But the actual asking price is atrocious.

Anyway, dev, if you read this, please put more effort into the game. A fun game can look ""bad"" and still be fun (although in VR it's a different story, you should still make it look at least palatable). Make it unique and worth the asking price, don't just drop the bare minimum of assets and what constitutes a ""game"" into a scene, charge $6, and expect anything good to come of it. Ask the community for feedback, for help, just make it known that you're wanting to improve. Just put forth the effort and you can make a game you can be proud of, and worth the $6 price tag.

Until then, though, I do not recommend this game. It is not fun to play, nor is it even worth showing to friends and family. My 1.8 hours is from idling just to play off the joke review, which I really shouldn't have joked about in the first place.

Edit for August 11th, 2016:
It appears the dev actually took the criticisms to heart and actually improved the game, so I feel obligated to update my review once more to reflect the changes that were made. The creepy, lifeless cartoon rabbit from before has been replaced with a dog instead, which is a step up and a great replacement. You pick your dog from a cabin instead of pure darkness. The arbitrary gardening system was removed entirely, replaced now with just a food dispenser (although what happens when you inevitably run out of money remains a mystery to me, as there's no apparent way to regain this money nor have I played the update long enough to find out). The music has also been replaced; the original loop from before plays at the beginning but no longer plays through the entire game.
So do I recommend it? Despite the improvements, I still don't recommend it. While an improvement over the original, there's still much to be desired. The dog doesn't animate at all, the scenery is lacking in many regards, and right now you can only play fetch, wash it, and feed it. You just wait and respond to the next thought bubble. If you want to play fetch with a dog, you can play fetch with the robot dog from The Lab for free. There just isn't enough here to justify the price.
However, while I don't recommend the game, the dev has taken the criticisms well (from what I remembered seeing in the forums, at least). Personally I believe the fact that the dev is listening to feedback and is trying to improve the game is admirable. Unfortunately I think the decision to purge the forums for the new version of the game is questionable at best, and would have been a better decision to ask the users to see the newer version of the game instead of removing the criticisms from before the update.",1469749974,1470930927,False,30,20,0.743021726608276367,4,False,False,True,False,,,
