You fly around space on a rocket surfboard, tethering beasts the size of planets, wielding spears and runes that allow for a host of amazing builds to facilitate a combination of tactical combat and twitch reflexes. Utterly unique from start to finish and bursting with original ideas like Willy Wonka playing Asteroids: Monster Hunter Edition while listening to Glory Hammer in the background. 

There is just one problem: everything I just described is so shaky that it measures on the Richter scale. Don't get me wrong - it is a decent game and I'm going to give it a recommend for just how many unique ideas it has. But keep in mind that unique ideas are often unique for a reason. And just as a pogo-stick made of ice cream or an airplane made of banana bread sound both unique and awesome - they are not structurally sound. 

Let's talk about what the game gets right: I enjoy combat. Very fun to fly around fighting a wide cast of imaginative enemies. Going up against some of the big bosses in particular and pulling chunks off of them until they look like they have suffered explosive bouts of leprosy. And I don't know why, but there is nothing like chasing down prey many hundreds of times your size and stabbing it to death with sewing needles that makes me feel like a legendary deep space hunter.

This game is 90% combat, 10% prep. But prep can completely alter how a fight goes. Maybe a particular set of runes are not doing the trick against the monster of the hour, but hey, swap in some water runes and the monster gets mashed. Which is important as a lot of the monsters you face are fairly beefy, with the kind of health bars that are used in gyms to rack weights for power lifters and small to medium sized forklifts.

The problem - by which I mean the problem around which all the game's problems revolve - is that the game is very clearly about luck, the runes you get dictate the kind of enemies you can handle, and yet the game is designed with the idea that skill is the deciding factor. I'm sorry, but there is no answer to certain enemies if you don't have the equipment to fight them. The most glaring example of this is when the game throws something like a berserk reefgoblin at you. How do you handle an enemy that is invulnerable to the front, can't be killed through raw damage, and can survive its body being ripped from its head - and STILL get faster? The answer is that you don't. Even if you boost, you run into the problem where your charged spear is slower than your character's movement - meaning that you've sunken time and resources into an enemy that just isn't worth the effort put into killing it. As the only way to kill it is to get a near impossible shot on a tiny fin going mach twelve and you'll suffer far more damage than any reward that creature can provide.

Even when an enemy is not impossible to kill, there are many cases where they are just tedious to deal with. Puffers, Angels, Starbait, Goblins, Sandchewers, and several other enemies are just not fun to fight and are usually not worth the trouble to kill. It gets even worse when most enemies in the later stages need to have their heads ripped off to have the common decency to stay down. And while fighting any one of these enemies is usually doable, every enemy comes in a group - often making dispatching them dangerous and tedious as you can't even position yourself to do damage without the right rune set up.

And that's really the killing blow. Later enemies just are not worth it. There is a strong argument to be made that if you're lucky enough to have your build sorted out you should skip killing enemies in the last couple rounds and just head straight for the boss of the zone, as engaging with the game at that point will always be a net loss. But even then, it goes back to the idea that even if you have your build sorted out, that doesn't mean you have the resources to beat the boss - as once again, some of the charging enemies are so fast that unless you are geared for boosting, you have no chance of outrunning them. It's to the point that playing against an elite charger boss is a flip of the coin. Sometimes they get mildly annoying enchantments like poison, or fire, or ice. But then you land on that 1 out of 4 chance that the boss whose entire gimmick is hitting fast and hard - you land on the berserk enchantment when makes the boss hit *faster and harder*.

I don't think I'm selling this correctly, so let me expand. There are multiple *normal* bosses that rely on use of your radar to have a chance against. You run along side them for a bit chucking sowing needles at them like an abusive spinster before they tear out of there like speed racer. But Berserk on elite bosses seems to increase their speed by some unknown percentage - and just as 50% faster on a tortoise just turns it into slightly faster tortoise, 50% faster on a formula 1 race car turns it into a interstellar warp missile powered by hate instead of blood. So by the time the monster shows up on your radar he is already helping himself to a space cowboy sandwich. I know at least one has an attacks that... well it isn't an instakill. It's more like an attack that does massive damage and can proc multiple times back to back that it is practically an instakill. It is the ""I'm not touching you"" of instakills. 

But these are all extreme examples. If you play the game right, prioritize keys and drop rates over everything else, and keep runes based on their future utility against certain monsters, then you're going to make it. But here is the problem with that: most of the rewards suck. The best character in the game is Emerald Jones - he is unlocked by killing one of the easiest bosses. The worst character is Xexemoth, and he is unlocked by killing one of the hardest. Even beating the game only rewards a mediocre spear. 

You know what the funny part is? One of the best spears in the game is supposed to be unlocked after completing the bestiary - this would require multiple runs beating the same bosses multiple times along with all the worst enemy types until you collect all 60+ entries. But by the grace of God, the programmers had a fit of good sense and didn't introduce the change - as such, the weapon Judgment is unlocked after only 20 entries. Far more doable and actually makes the early game fun past the first few runs. 

The wildest part is that Judgment isn't even *that* great a weapon and it would have taken one of the most tedious challenges to complete *AND* you would have no new challenges to test it on. I mean, maybe Elite mode - but you seriously have a better chance of beating Elite mode before filling out the Bestiary.

And that's still not the craziest part of this game. In the weirdest of weird moves, legendary runes are almost never seen in this game. Oh they exist and in the hands of a player that knows their business they can be very useful, but I know for a fact there are multiple players that beat the final boss and never seen one. Again, this is the dev trying to make the player feel like they have earned it, but i'm gonna be honest: unless that rune has the power to one-shot a boss, it is a little excessive to put 10 hours between every rune a player sees. I myself had only seen 1 or 2 in the 40 hrs I put in before I got the key spear and both of them, while powerful, were by no means game changers.

So with all these petty grievances aside, why should you play it if the rewards suck and the gameplay is generally unpolished, often breaking its own rules? To be honest, the biggest reward this game has to offer are the hunts themselves. Just the sheer spectacle of the 4 tent pole bosses justify the asking price. And just like I said at the start, it is a unique concept I haven't seen anywhere else.

- Creature turning should be adjusted to be a bit slower ( or at least dont have them turn on a dime if their front is armored...)
- Have it a bit more clear where to hit some creatures, specially things like the worms in yellow
- Have the shop actually be useful, the amount of times i have over a thousand or even 2 thousand gold simply cus there was nothing good in the shop is almost every run.

One of the biggest points against this game is that it is abandoned in what can only be described as an unfinished state. There are items that literally do nothing (unintentionally), attacks that have inaccurate hit boxes relative to their sprites, and a truly severe lack of balance. 

The controls of the game are just bad. Movement is slippery and turning 180 requires taking wider turns than Euro Truck Sim; your spear attacks have very slow projectiles, making aiming annoying, and the boost mechanic is terrible. You use 1-3 of your 3 boost based on how long you hold it. 1 boost is so small as to be almost useless, 2 is usable but the cooldown is atrocious, and 3 is way too fast, to the point where your turn speed is not sufficient to stop you from careening away or directly into whatever you were fighting. 

The enemies in the game have interesting designs, usually a mash of two existing creatures, but sometimes angry flesh triangles. Unfortunately they're almost all spastic bastards who either fire endless projectiles, or are covered in armor and just try to rub on you, or both. Enemies also have a lot of health, so every fight drags on.

And, finally, the upgrades you get, the whole roguelike part, is complete and utter bullshit. You can get a legendary rune that carries the whole run from your first chest, or get literally nothing useful after taking down 5 of the 9 regions. Consumable items also suck, most last only 10 sec (a boss fight could last 10 minutes) since the bosses are so different, you might want a different build for different bosses, but it's so rare to get anything useful you almost never have a cohesive build, much less multiple. Unlike most rogue-likes, you have almost no interesting decisions to make; most of the time you have a bad choice and worse choices.

the game is a top-down, rouge-like game, so every playthrough is diffrent. and with a rtocky soundtrack too!
Pros:
Lots of diffent kinds of enemys and bosses
A bunch of weapon upgrades that make you feel liek a god on a surfboard!
the game's artstyle is very pleasing to look at, the creatures look awesome aswell!
charectors are fun and creative, and bander to each other everytime you complete a contract

Cons:
Some of the bosses are extremly difficult to dodge attacvks from, some are even garanteid to hit you.
The selection of charectors, while being greate, dont really make much of a diffrence, some of their stats are just plain old bad.
i am unsure if the devs are still working on the game, i would really like an expanion or an upates, since the boss variation can kinda feel samy at times

Забавно, что в игре нет ни черного (Черного?) моря, ни одиссеи. На самом деле дело происходит в космосе, при этом удивительно похожем на океан. Дело не только в условной двумерности, но и в обитателях - все космические монстры так или иначе похожи либо на морских обитателей, либо на прибрежных. Одиссеи, как странствий в поисках себя и дома, тут тоже нет - по сюжету это соревнование колоритных космических охотников. В общем, самым подходящим для игры названием стал бы ""Космический Нантакет"", но кто бы купил ее тогда.

Удивительное.
Представьте, что вы идете по своим делам, и вокруг вас начинает кружиться мушка. Все бы ничего, но она тыкает в вас малюсенькими иголками, а еще у нее есть крошечный гарпун, которым она отрывает самые истыканные кусочки тела. И так, пока вас не доконает кровотечение. Игра примерно про это. Только вместо вас колоссальные и не очень монстры, а вместо мушки - собственно вы, отважный космический гарпунёр. В общем, эта игра еще относится к жанру сражений с большими чудищами по типу Shadow of Colossus, но в инди обертке и 2D. Авторы грамотно выдержали игровой процесс - во главе угла конечно боссы, но ключевая прокачка и добывание экипировки осуществляется (по желанию) на средних чудищах, плюс, есть мелочевка, которая не приносит никаких бонусов, но порой портит нервы. В итоге, игру можно проходить как резкими скачками от колосса к колоссу, так и вдумчиво, перебирая добытые руны. Для первых есть даже спид-ран ачивка. 

Плюсы.
- Противники разнообразны, повадки каждого босса нужно изучать, порой ценой многих поражений, сражаться интересно и непросто.
- Руны и расходники разнообразят процесс и по сути формируют уникальный стиль каждой игровой партии; это особенно существенно потому, что выпадают они не так уж часто, особенно качественные, а выбор в магазине чаще всего убогий.
- Графика поначалу немного отпугивает, но потом привыкаешь и даже начинаешь ценить ее минимализм, не отвлекающий от геймплея.
- Идея с сонаром шикарная - на мини-карте монстры видны только при повороте сонара, а между ними перемещаются не всегда предсказуемо и могут появиться рядом с гарпунщиком внезапно и больно - это превращает игру в немножко хоррор, когда ты задерживаешь дыхание и напряженно вглядываешься в сонар, чтобы угадать, откуда придет опасность.
- Загарпунить Ктулху бесценно!
- Помимо Ктулху есть еще ряд литературных отсылок; первого доступного гарпунёра зовут просто - Старик (привет, Хэмингуэй!), а главный босс в конце игры - это одна огромная цитата из другого произведения (не буду спойлерить).
- Во время брифингов на станции персонажи забавно бормочут на загадочных языках.

Минусы.
- Музыка здесь просто есть, с геймплеем она гармонирует не очень, на мой взгляд, несет чисто служебную функцию озвучки спокойных и напряженных моментов.
- В игре очень серьезный рандом по обвесу, не каждая партия в итоге оказывается жизнеспособна (по крайней мере при моих руках); впрочем для хардкорного рогалика это должно быть нормально.
- Соревнование между гарпунщиками по очкам чисто номинальное; насколько я понял, я последним боссом имеет дело только протагонист, а за него должны отвалить столько очков, что можно перегнать кого угодно.

В общем, классный рогалик, в котором забег обычно составляет час, максимум полтора, а бои с противниками изобретательны и требуют индивидуального подхода. Я даже умудрился дойти до финального босса и поглазеть на него, хотя после просмотра чужого прохождения понимаю, что мне его не одолеть; пять фаз с условным буллетхэллом - это нечто. В любом случае, игра прекрасна, особенно срединным геймплеем, когда корабль уже экипирован рунами, а на сонаре маячит силуэт Ктулху.",1561623964,1561624155,True,1,0,0.527777791023254395,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So I bought the Switch release which just came out about a week ago and while it's fun there, the JoyCons are not ideal. The Pro Controller alleviates some of the twitchy/precise aiming needed.

I've gotten as far as round 5 with amazing early runes only to be demolished by enemies that are putting a clinic around you because half the time your battle is with the controls. 2 bugs I've noticed on the Switch release: SLOW. SLOW. SLOW inventory managing and the occasional UI text pop up that does not go away if your pointer was hovering over an item when you back out of inventory/shop.

(Herman Melville's classic work is censored, but i'm talking about the whale one obviously.)

Banksy's Otter Sea is commited to its setting. Instead of crawling through a dungeon you are hunting space monster bounties in a competition. This extends beyond narrative set-up for why you are thrusting yourself into dangerous monster laden territory: you in fact are competing, score-wise, with other a.i. Controlled  bounty hunters. It’s a non-combat element that can add some tension and healthy frustration to the game.

 In the prebattle state you can visit the shop, pick your bounty (the boss you will fight), and dig through your equipment and inventory. Whatever bounty you don’t choose is then assigned to the a.i. competition. There is some banter amongst the competitors, but for the most part this is your chance to gear up. 

Being tossed into the expansive, murky depths in search of a monster feels thrilling. Twinstick fans will find themselves right at home as the glide around and harpoon enemies. The movement feels purposefully weighted as you balance using your boosters , making turns and hitching yourself to enemies with your harpoon. Your primary fire consists of rapid fire styled javelins, while your alternate fire is the harpoon. While there are items that can lend some damage, your harpoon finisher is the preferred method for dealing with most enemies. If it feels like this has come up a lot, it’s because the harpoon is a defining feature: a charged up harpoon at the right time can rend a pulsating limb from enemies, weakening their damage output, slowing them down, or opening up new critical areas. It can be tricky to use at first, especially on nimble enemies, but when it does land, it feels great.

Outside of this one neat trick (space monsters hate it), the combat is standard fare. Your gear mostly just tweaks stats or adds generic effects to your primary fire and boosters: some split shots, critical chance increase, ice that slows down, faster attack, damage increase etc. There aren’t really any synergies or inventive options here. Obtaining these items is feast or famine as you rely on keys to open up chest that might contain credits, health pickups or gear. It is possible to get far without good gear, but even fodder enemies feel to spongy and quick in early stages, so runs will often drag out unless you get the right gear early.

It's worth a quick mention that bugs did cost me a few runs. Using a few different game pads I had some issues playing , but on top of that there were a few times that I got stuck at the shop screen or another menu and had to quit the game. It wasn't frequent, but losing a good run to some bugs is never fun.

The neat setting is conveyed well in game and a few distinct gameplay tweaks set this otherwise responsive twinstick roguelite apart, but it probably won’t rend you away from Dead Cells or BoI or whatever roguelite is dominating right now.",1542503043,1542504468,True,1,0,0.528795838356018066,0,False,False,False,False,,,

各种宇宙怪物的造型到是很奇特，后面的大型BOSS也很有压迫力。
因为移动时有微妙的惯性，怪兽和飞船又在一直移动，武器的速度不是很快，所以操作上是有一些难度的。

操作：
WASD：移动
SHIFT：加速推进，可以撞碎地图上的岩石。
左键：投掷小矛
右键：投掷重型勾矛，再次右键将矛收回。
Q/E：使用道具。
TAB：弹出道具背包。
ESC：菜单。

小矛攻速快，伤害低。
重矛速度慢，伤害高，需要蓄力，可以扯碎身体部件。
当怪物身上有部位开始闪烁红光的时候，就可以用重矛扎上去在扯碎了。
小怪扯碎就死了，BOSS就要一点点撕了。

难度不同的狩猎地图，里面的小怪难度也不同。
狩猎前记得点右下角的SHOP购买出售装备，道具。
怪兽有时候会掉落钥匙，可以开启地图上的宝箱来获取各种道具。

BOSS不会直接出现在地图上，在地图上能够扫描到，呆在附近一会儿，就会从背景中浮现出来。",1525037240,1525037369,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,False,False,False,False,,,

游戏设定是，玩家与外星渔夫比赛猎杀海怪，比赛9轮。每轮有不同难度的猎物供玩家先手选择，然后电脑随机分配剩下的猎物。猎物越强，猎杀获得的分数越高。玩家根据情况来决定是硬刚大块头抢分，还是找一般难度的目标打钱、打宝箱积攒实力。

战斗设计非常有想法，玩家有两种攻击手段，左键普通投矛低伤害高频率，右键蓄力投锚高伤害还能钩在敌人身上，之后继续投矛攻击相同位置会打出debuff，再次右键收回锚就可以断肢了。整个战斗围绕断肢展开，一步步撕碎体型庞大的BOSS很有满足感。

但是，不知是不是因为我一直挑着难度高的地图打，敌人血量高得实在过分 ，更别说多数敌人都有几块无视伤害的甲壳，绕圈追着戳屁股也是醉醉的。玩家移动方式还有点尴尬，大概是为了符合渔夫打鱼的设定，驾驶的小快艇是单向向前的推进器+舵，移动还有惯性。于是在本来不算密集的弹幕中转向急停擦弹消耗的操作和精力反倒多了，使得较长时间的BOSS战乐趣骤减，这是我放弃继续挑战的主要原因——操作难和操作烦是两回事。

也可能是我衰老了，确实懒得在这种设计上死磕时间了。

The game is, on its face, fun enough, but after a few plays, the flaws in the game became enough to stop me from playing further.

The basic game loop is as follows: Start game, select one of four characters (one at start, 3 unlocked by beating specific monsters, each with their own basic ability), select a spear (each with its own ability - and some are MUCH better than others...), select a monster and stage (each monster comes with accompanying modifiers that affect the stage, like bigger or faster enemies, more or less loot, more or less keydrops, etc.), hunt monster, and repeat from stage select. While in stages, you fight small monsters, collect credits, collect keys to unlock chests, and then rip and tear the boss creature apart for a massive slew of loot, then go back to the stage select screen to buy other upgrades and do it again. Chests contain both consumables and rune upgrades for your ship and spear, as does the after-shop store, and is the only way to advancing your character. In this way, progress can feel very RNG gated. If you constantly get consumables, or get poor runes, or runes that don't synergize, your run feels like it's over before it started. The 3rd and 4th biomes especially take a massive hike in difficulty that can be impressive to surmount without synergized powerful ship and spear runes.

The game's music and graphics are passable (but repetitive - there's only one ambient track per biome, one combat track, and one boss music track per biome. It quickly wears thin, it's all grating and loud,, especially in the Desert and Abyss biomes), but what's really great is the sense of scale - you really do feel like a tiny dude in a space ship flinging toothpicks at these giant Shadows of the Colossus style monsters. Even the smaller random mobs are susceptible to being torn up bodypart by bodypart, and harpooning and tearing monsters often leads to weakening or changing their behavior in various ways, or even leads to quicker one shot kills, so it's always useful to rip off limbs. Ripping up the boss monsters is satisfying, and feels great, and is the core sense of fun in the game. Puzzling out how to approach and rend off pieces while dodging attacks is enjoyable.

The game takes a massive difficulty spike about half way in runs, when the desert and abyss biomes open up. The bosses are much more difficult, the game becomes much more bullet-helly, and even the generic monsters become SO speedy and orbiting around your ship that no matter what speed upgrades you have, you simply dont outrun them unless you use your severely limited (even with runes - but using boost runes when there are so many other important ship runes to use is folly) Boost to reposition. And if you don't have several well synergizing damage runes, the most important of which are spread shot and attack speed upgrades, you can be plinking away at even trash monsters for a great deal of time before you can harpoon bodyparts. As keys can be a rare currency, and chests will have consumables, only money, or random runes in equal measure, you can never really be sure what you're going to get - but unlike other roguelikes, you don't have the ability to fall back on at least being levelled up, you simply have underpowered runes, which can quickly end a run when forced to choose between 3 difficult bosses.

Ultimately, the game is fun. The final run of bosses are incredibly difficult and will test your skills to the limit even with powerful runes and consumables for you to use. Unlocking new spears and characters is relatively easy, and new unlocks come at a relatively quick pace. Monsters unlock bestiary entries with little lore snippets, and hints for how to better defeat them in the future. The game can become repetitive, since there's only so many bosses to fight, and four biomes, but runs are also small and bitesize, completeable in under an hour, easily. I wish more was done with the 'competitive' feel of the game - the game is set up to have you rivalling other hunters, but you never come across them other than to see their auto-generated scores and what monsters they fight. It would have been interesting to be able to come across them in missions and have to compete against them for kills or to score the final hit on bosses.

If you enjoy the top down shooter roguelike, and are intrigued by the tiny vs massive giant bossfight style, definitely give it a chance. Ultimately the amount of upgrade RNG you're subject to put me off of it, but honestly - I could probably have stood to get a lot better at the game, which probably would have mitigated my woes.

The TL:DR is that now that i have revisited it, I can say its actually bad. There are a couple reasons for this.

The entire game is RNG. The missions are random and its possible that you can get screwed by the affixes. Chest loot in mission is random as well as the chance for keys to open those chests is random. The shop is random after every mission. 

So why is this a problem? Early enemies are slow enough to where you can tolerate their janky movement and dont have enough health for you to spend your time on. Later missions however enemies will run circles around you if you dont have the necessary ship runes, and absorb spears for days if you dont have the proper spear runes. The only silver lining here is that there are a lot of potential builds that come from the spear runes, but as already mentioned, you may not even be able to round out a build by the time you get taken out by later missions. 

Enemies are very odd. Harpooning as a mechanic is fun, but other than giving a burst of damage, it actually just makes a segment of an enemy invulnerable. There is a tooltip in loading menus that says enemies are slowed while harpooned. The reality is that its not significant enough to be noticable. Not only that, harpooning pulls you AND the monster closer together, meaning enemies have an easier time hitting you because they are forced in closer. 

Probably the most frustrating part is enemy rotation doesnt seem to be tied to movement. Most of the enemies you fight are you continuously playing merry-go-round until they die, even after you have taken out things you would expect would halt locomotion when removed, such as jets for the squids and legs for the frogs. It doesnt help that hitboxes for the armored enemies feel inconsistent.

This game is frustrating and incredibly unrewarding. Its a continuous descent into the realization that everything is predetermined by RNG, and that there is no potential for skill to be rewarded in consequences or choices to result in game variation.",1512617232,1640666018,False,8,0,0.5025748610496521,1,False,False,False,False,,,

A combination of frustrating design decisions and occasional severe bugs makes this into an unpleasant experience, and if one continues playing until one has beaten the game, it's more likely due to stubbornness than enjoyment.

In the beginning of the game, combat is tedious, a boring cycle of killing weak enemies that take too long to dispatch while waiting to find a weapon upgrade which may or may not ever materialize. Later in the game, most actual threats feel as though their danger comes from clumsy game mechanics rather than appropriate challenge. Various aspects of the game feel unpolished; a shop appears at the beginning of the game when the player cannot possibly have anything to sell or any money to spend, the visual indication of the boundary of the level is much too subtle, etc.

Some enemies can be rendered impossible to kill (an abyss enemy in the -goblin family has an invulnerable portion and a vulnerable portion; usually these can be killed by depleting their vulnerable portions' health and then harpooning them off, but a Berserk elite has enough bonus health to actually survive this process, leaving only the invulnerable portion to swim around and attack indefinitely).

Not only the art design, combined with a great (and a bit repetitive) soundtrack, but also the idea itself of a space surfing Poseidon, ready to rip a variety of insect and deep-sea inspired monstrosoties is quite genius in itself.

With the current version that got rid of most bugs, it is an enjoyable game for short sessions. The only downside it brings is within balancing. RNG is very heavy in this one and can eliminate a pt with a well equipped character quickly. With the spear unlocks and a variety of levels with up- and downsides to chose from for each stage, it offers the opportunity to adapt and may avoid death. So even with a few balance issues, it remains a fun game for me and is recommended.

Ok I’m finished in the shower now on to my review.

Blacksea Odyssey by Blacksea Odyssey (no coincidence), has absolutely nothing to do with the wet blue stuff and all about the black void stuff, yes, space and the immense vacuum of it. Hack and slash your way through tonnes of baddies, at that’s just to get out of the saloon, not even into the game yet.

Story
Reading like a cross between Moby Dick by Herman Melville and The Island of Dr Moreau by H.G. Wells, you are one of the best hunters in the galaxy and in competition against others, you must find and hunt down the elusive White Whale or die trying.

Gameplay
I recommend to hit the tutorial first as this will guide you through your movement, fire and other quest keys. Also to get you use to the slightly weird use of WASD. Weird only because I am not use to it, but over time you can master it. W is to go up, S is to go down, A is to go left and D is to go right. Those using a control pad will be use to this. LMB is throw spear, RMB is power up throw (very handy) a second click of RMB will rip limbs off if powered throw is a success. Shift is power boost to your ship, if you need to do a quick get away or to ram some terrain out of your way.

You start of with the Old Man, who looks more like Neptune from The Little Mermaid, only more bad ass space marine style and a crude spear (you get to unlock three more Hunters and a boatload of WTF spears later).

You meet at the main Saloon and listen (read) to some banter from your competitors, some of it can scroll through a bit too fast, so brush up on your speed reading. Then you from a space map you pick which Monster bounty you wish to go hunt for. These will have a lvl of difficulty and bounty listed with them but don’t be fooled, even lvl 1 monsters will kick your butt, hard! Select then hit the road..um space.

You fly around the area, keeping a close eye on your radar in the bottom left corner, if a red ping shows then you have a monster near by.  The map is filled with space flora (shrooms) that can cause psychedelic hallucinations, so avoid at all costs. Also minor monsters that can pack a punch or swarm you to death. 
All kills will earn you money and points so hunt away, but you need pick you opportunity as most monsters have some form of hardshell armour and your spears will just bounce off, aim for the soft fleshy parts. You can power up the throw by holding the RMB, let loose and land a hit, RMB click again and you can start to dismember your prey, piece by piece (Calamari anyone!).

Some of your prey will drop coins and even keys if your lucky. Take a key and scan for a hidden chest, to claim loot. Most loot is power-ups for your spear or ship or both. Above all do not die as this is a permadeath game and there is no health boosts or aids unless in a chest. Once you have killed you bounty you return to the Saloon and rinse and repeat.

Everything else
Main menu and options are well thrashed out giving you options on graphics and sound as well as key binding and feedback vibration (for those who play with their controller between legs, you sickos!)

Graphics are cartoonish Southpark style, are crisp and clean and work very well here. Back ground music is subtle and upbeat and is not annoying so leave it on. Movement is crisp and very responsive, sometimes a little too responsive but at the same time it will save your butt a tonne load.

My only small grips with this game is that a) monsters can hide behind the space debris from you as you need to either blow it out of the way or go around, but you can hide behind it because monsters just glide through it as if it’s not there. 

b) It has a very steep (not steep, it’s a bloody sheer cliff) learning curve that even low level monsters eat you up for breakfast, lunch and tea!

c) Story is bare exists but maybe a bit more tweaking it could beef up the game a bit more.

Outside of these, Blacksea Odyssey by Blacksea Odyssey (still no resemblance) is a fun action shooter/Harpooner that needs to be in your library.

If any of you read my Eldritch review, you must already know I have a soft spot in my cold, dark heart for rogue-likes. It all started with the original Binding of Isaac, there Is something about the randomness of the items and your progression that appeals to me, and this game does that rather well, there is room for improvement, but at it's current state, it's really fun.

Many years in the future, The Galaxy holds a sacred tournament that happens once a decade, The Blacksea odyssey, in which every hunter must prove their worth by hunting down and killing the most ferocious creatures that exist in the known universe, in which the winner, aside from insurmountable riches, gets a chance to battle the legendary Titan of the Stars.
Well, the story is a bit lackluster, but it does add something to one of the characters, in which there are 4, all really well designed and colourful, and the one you start with is The Old Man, who is one of the oldest humans to still roam the galaxy, and he is in search of revenge from the Titan, who took his arm in his youth, and he is poised to do whatever is necessary to defeat the blasted space whale.
Does it sound familiar? It's because it is, The Old Man is basically Captain Ahab, from Moby Dyck, and the Titan is the whale himself.

The game is a top-down rogue-like, with Nuclear Throne like controls, in this game you've got two active item slots, a boost system, and spear and a harpoon, and an amazing combat mechanic, you can weaken the monster's limbs, and after they've been weakened enough, you can harpoon them and rip them off, which limits the monster's attacks and mobility, that is such a cool mechanic, and it works so well, it is amazing to rip off the bosses's arms and spiked tails, sooo satisfying. You can also improve your spears and your ship with runes, changing your playstyle a bit, and at the start of each game you can also pick one of the 4 characters and one spear, each of them with their own playstyle as well.
Also, every part of the map's terrain is breakable, you can use your active bomb items to blow them up, or just boost trough them, this prevents the enemies to pin you at walls and just murder you, which still happens at times.
There is one peeve I had with this game, some things clearly need rebalancing, your boost clearly needs to last longer, it's barely a boost as it is right now, you've got to use it to dodge the boss's attacks, but then it enters an ungodly cooldown. Also Megalodon is just absurd, it turns way too fast, Jackdaw needs to have a weak spot in his mouth, not just block everything. And the frogs at the early levels are really annoying when you still have no runes to boost damage.

The graphics are OK, there is a bit of room for improvement, but I like the game's style, the designs being what I love the most, every enemy has a really cool design which complements their fighting style. Some of the bosses are MASSIVE, like REALLY HUGE, they easily dwarf your view range, and I like that Shadow of The Colossus type of huge bosses.
The music is also kind of catchy, but I am one to prefer podcasts and other types of music while playing video games.

Overall, this game has the potential to be great, and as is, it's really fun, and the developers literally updated the game on the 18th, so it still has their support. I recommend it, you're sure to have several hours of fun with this.
Just remember to disable the screen shaking under the options, it's really headache inducing.

The game is viciously difficult and will not pull punches, but has been rebalanced somewhat by the developer after the initial releases, resulting in a far less frustrating experience than it once was.

I feel that the game still has some untapped potential, but in its current state this is certainly worth playing and enjoying.

Bear in mind, I initially had a negative review up for this game, with the strikes against it being poor balancing, glitches and my reading on the game's discussion section that the developers had abandoned it. The developer responded to my (rather spicy) review very calmly and patiently, stating that they had not abandoned the game and were working on a patch to address the issues.

Now that I know the product has not been abandoned and several of the issues it was suffering have been actively fixed by the developer, i'm glad to say I feel it has earned the ol' thumbs up. =)

On a serious note: it's, as you saw from videos and screenshots, game with shump elements (it's closer to western type of shmups, than to a super-mega-ultra-hardcore Japanese shmup) and rogue-like elements (random encounters and loot). So how does it work in practise? Gameplay cycle is as follows:
* kill trash monsters in their camps;
* slay relatively big boss monster;
* buy/sell loot;
* repeat this until the last battle against ... little bunny with a carrot-sword (not really).
Followed by item-stacking (or creation of build), heavy use of the surroundings, analysis of enemy behaviour patterns and other nuances that has to be learnt.

Man, I like the game a lot, but sometimes it can be kind of a ""celestial dumpsterfire"".

Pros:
* different space beasts with different behaviour patterns. One of the most impressive aspects was their ability to defend themselves in different ways even when approached from back.
* upgrades that require time to learn (like Pimpernel in Borderlands 2). Of course, there are your standard movement speed, attack speed, damage boosts, but that's just how it is.
* art style is great. It succeeds to deliver an atmosphere of harsh, cold and unforgiving space filled with creatures who don't give a damn about humans (it's a little bit influenced by Lovecraft's work (I know man didn't write about space hunter, but the feel is on some level similar)).
* most of the boss fights are really entertaining (at some level, at least, haha).
* environments are destructible and may be harmful, I really liked seeing debris drifting, awesome attention to detail.
* music is ok.

Cons:
* overlapping, disappearing and distorted audio (sometimes);
* bullet-spongy enemies; they can really be irritating, sure, if one has enough damage runes, the job can be done pretty quickly, otherwise drops are in the hands of RNGesus. So, I guess, it depends on one's preferences.
* some AI is really stubborn, especially that [spoiler]Megalodon[/spoiler]. Man, it is annoying, because that a-hole keeps on turning (very) fast when I tried to flank him. It seems that the boss does not have any turning limit like other bosses. Another example [spoiler]Vilemoth[/spoiler] - this majestic creature just flies around and do not attack me. I, like some kind of idiot, have to play catch with it. Not cool, dude, not cool. Also, some trash mobs (in void biome) are really fast - faster than my spear, especially when combined with speed modification. Jesus flippin Christ.
* this is where attrition comes in. There were some fights where I just gave up because battle became solid stalemate.

Oh, and I forgot, [spoiler]Doomreaper[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Aether[/spoiler], go to Hell, not to mention the last d-bag.

Verdict: game's between average and solid, in my opinion. If you are still curious or long boss battles are your thing, then sure, try it out. Otherwise - purchase if you have some ""creds to burn"". For me it lacks flexibility in dififculty, but I understand and respect design decisions.

If you need further encouragement: Blacksea Odyssey feels like [i]Risk of Rain[/i] meets [i]Worms[/i].  It's a top-down Roguelike-like, with many unique weapon mods and destructible terrain.  The emphasis of the game is on boss battles: the end of each of the rounds is a boss that you select at the Bounty Select screen, so you know what to expect.  The stages between bosses are incredibly fluid, relying completely on your focus to advance and defeat the boss.  But even more than that, each mob fight feels like a mini-boss fight.  To defeat enemies, you have to focus their weak spots, then rip them off with a secondary-fire (a harpoon shot).  [b]This harpoon mechanic is extremely gratifying.[/b]  To me, this feels like what many Roguelikes (or Roquelites, or Roquelite-likes, you know what I mean) have been missing over the years.  I don't want to just beat shit up, [i]I want to make it feel like my shots matter.[/i]  I want to feel like a Master, more than just a Badass.  And Blacksea Odyssey does that for me.

In all fairness, I did encounter a bug that resulted in me dying.  But was that enough to make me want to stop playing?  [b]No.[/b]  (The Krakhammer boss became invulnerable, getting stuck at 100% health, more than halfway through the battle.  But I'm almost positive that the bug was a result of me pausing the game during combat, which was due to me jotting down a note of how awesome that boss battle was.)  It is likely that you will encounter bugs, but very few (if any) of these will be game-affecting.  Most are graphical or text bugs (I unlocked 135,000 chests!?), and the ones that do affect the game are forgivable.

And on to the polish.  The polish on this game is fantastic.  It's more than I've come to expect in most indie studios.  It's more than I've come to expect in games beyond indie studios.  You can feel the love the developers put into this game.  Background layers in stages, boss reveals, music tracks, character animations, destructible terrain, lighting effects on walls, character sheets, stage types, itemization, their spin on character creation, harpoon ripping physics... I could have a list a hundred items long, and still miss things that I appreciate.

Blacksea Odyssey is a great game.  I enjoyed it more than Everspace, and that's saying a lot.  You should buy it.

You fly around through a series of levels attacking monsters and collecting power ups. At first it was difficult but I could see that with some practice and the right power ups it could be an awesome game. And it is. After the initial learning hump I couldn't stop playing and sank a lot of hours into trying to unlock new spears and characters and getting to further levels. 

Unfortunately every 2 or 3 levels the enemy types change and the only real way to defeat them is to die a few times learnng their patterns, which means you have to start the game over again, which means it could become unbearably grindy for some. 

Still, this is a creative and well-executed game.

Honestly, the story may as well not be there, as it's only told during cartrige-era text boxes, but for the amusing conversations that take place between the four hunters between missions, which if you take the time to read are actually quite amusing. 

As far as gameplay goes, you control your spaceship with WASD and fire with the mouse. There is gamepad support but I would recommend not using it. I've tried both, and even after taking a half hour getting used to it with the gamepad it still wasn't worth it. The controls simply don't work.

Your only customization going into the game is which of the characters you play as and what ""spear"" you use. Each one has different effects, pros, and cons. None of the bounty hunters are genericly better than the others. The standard indie random loot and infinite replayability rears its head here, with ship and spear upgrades being ""runes"" which are acquired by opening chests and defeating enemies. It's all comprehensive enough, although I've found the runes to be very unbalanced within teirs, and some runes are almost useless.

Controling the ship is a little clunky, as it controls more like a boat than a space ship. However, once you've adjusted for the controls and stop running into the projectile you were trying to dodge, the game flows very nicely and intuitively. 

Map design is a little boring, with four teirs of space and each one only having recoloured rocks. Enemy design is a little more inspired, though it doesn't take a genius to realize that there are about five categories of enemies and you just need to slot them in for each layer you travel to.

Now I will talk about the two biggest selling points of the game, which are the reasons the game is teeth-gnashingly difficult and extremely fun.

First is the enemy AI. Whoever did the programming for the puffer fish AI on the second level, hats off to you, I can never hit those guys from long range. Most enemies in the game have unique AI that determines their attack patterns, and it's enough that even after slaying a few hundred of the same enemy you can still be blindsided by their routine.

The second big selling point is the boss fights. There are seven levels to the game, and each one you get to choose which of a handful of bosses you'll be going after. Bosses range from insultingly easy (looking at you Puff Daddy) to basicly impossible without a perfect build (Charybdis). Almost every boss has some unique gimmick, and the level major bosses are as rewarding to fight as the challenge implies. 

I have a few minor problems, like the rune issue above and the fact that you can never just strafe to dodge those stunrocks from the level three bosses, but in the end the game is very solid. Not something to be played all day and beat, but a fun thing to do with a few hours to kill.

Boss fight are also great. They are hard and you need another tactic for every part of fight with every boss. That's make fights intensive and it won't be boring after few hours of game. Great thing is also harpoon. You can't deal dmg to enemis forever just atacking them. You have to catch their weak spots by using harpoon and rip parts of your enemis and it's not so easy. It's mean you can have all epic or legendaries runes in your inv but you still need to focus on aiming and avoid enemys atack cause you can't kill it just by shooting it. With bosses is same thing.

Example of some frustrations, there's no confirmation dialog on the ""Restart"" button. There is to exit, but not restart, so good luck not ever pressing that. You also can't get drops from bosses if they're in the black, inky area, despite the fact that bosses sure do love to move there and die. Bye, all that effort! You get nothing for it!

Example of some awesome things, there's next to no limit on how you stack the assorted runes and spears you can collect, which leads to some crazy cool synergies and a lot of variety in how you play each run. As you get better at piloting and harpooning, you start to be able to really dictate the stages of the fights you find yourself in, dancing and zooming around giant space beasts as you disable 'em progressively further.

Aiming with any sense of consistency is impossible. These issues apply to both keyboard&mouse and controller. The enemies never move how you would expect. Many of the small neemies will have boost-like movement, but even while boosting in a direction they will slide left or right which makes trying to avoid them frustrating.

 The bosses are big, which they use as a selling point, but the camera doesn't zoom out, or follow your ship well enough to make the fight feel like you are fighting a huge monster instead it feels like you are alwways stuck on the undamagable side of a big wall. If you are close enough to see where to aim at a boss, you are far too close to be able to avoid attacks. Like, FAR TOO CLOSE. I found myself sitting so far away I couldn't see any part of the boss until I thought they were done their sttacks before going in to try to get a few hits in.

 I have no idea if once you are supposed to start weak and get better with unlocks, but your starting weapon's effectiveness is on par with in what, in any other game what would be disgustingly useless. The smallest of enemies takes maybe 3 hits to kill, but due to the first probelsm stated this means probably firing anywhere between 5 and 10 shots. 

 The harpoon is a cool idea for tearing away pieces of the enemies, which is the best part of the game, but the charge time and the enemy movement again make using it not worth the effort other than on bosses.

If I may be so bold as to recommend ways to fix most of the issues: Take away the turning your ship has to do to move, let it just move immediatly in the direction you want to move in. Fix enemy movement so that it is more predictable. When you fight a boss have the camera zoom out so that you can see the whole boss as well as the environment around it.

Хороший, годный Early Access перешел в состояние хорошей, годной игры. Может быть, даже рановато перешел...

Сюжет таков: четыре лучших охотника на космических НЁХ всея вселенной собрались в одном месте, чтобы в соревновании, под названием ""Blacksea Odyssey"", измерить, у кого писька длиннее.

Цель игры проста: пройди до конца и, опционально, окажись выше всех в таблице писькомерства. У вас есть четыре разных персонажа, десяток копий и пара-тройка десятков рун, апгрейдов на копье и корабль. Конкретно здесь ничего примечательного. Рогалик, десу.

До уровня ""годнота"" игру все так же вытягивает геймплей. Каждый (ну окей, почти каждый) моб - это продуманная моделька, с частями тела и зонами непробития. Достаточно надамаженную часть тела нужно отрывать гарпуном. Именно ""нужно"", на этом завязан весь геймплей. Без этого не пройдешь некоторых боссов, а позже и некоторых мобов.
А про добросовестность разработчиков... На Early Access стадии они служили своему делу верой и правдой. Баги фиксились, контент как-то добавлялся. Что будет теперь - не знаю. В этом плане нас ждет неясное будущее.

Также нельзя не заметить, что игра вышла из Early Access'а. Потеряна та ламповая атмосфера, когда в игру играли пара сотен человек... Но это так, печаль олдфака. А настоящая проблема в том, что в игру с кучей народа набигут и читеры. Таблица рекордов потеряет смысл, если читеров не будут пидорасить из нее.
А еще, несмотря на то, что игра уже в релизе, багов в ней по преждему дохера и маленькая тележка. Если у нас больше не будет апдейтов каждый вторник - то это плохо. Опять же, будем надеяться, что разрабы не огондурасятся.
А что до механики жидкого вакуума и мужиков без скафандров в открытом космосе, то игре про охотников на космических НЁХ это можно простить. Если же вас это не устраивает, можете искать обоснуи в процессе игры.

Однако, если положить на все это болт и просто посмотреть на игру, которая у нас есть сейчас, то она определенно стоит своих денег.

However the moment you are dropped into your first match (hopefully after learning the few ropes you need to know) you embark into a randomly generated stretch of space and go out to hunt your target and see where this game really shines:

Every enemy of the game has weakspots you can tear and rip, most of which are giving it either an attack to hurt you with or which are essential for moving around. As you begin your first hunt you get to feel the first satisfactory rip and tear of an enemy's body while learing to maneuver the board you are ""surfing"" on. Once you have fished away all the ""smaller"" enemies (or if you feel lucky go straight ahead to kill the boss) you end up meeting the prey you chose only to face a creature that might as well hunt you down instead. The bosses with their elaborate behavior patterns, massive size and tons of HP are the bread and butter of this game and it is a blast to ""hunt"" them down. They whack you away like the fly you are forcing you to learn their patterns, evade projectiles and melee attacks while whittling away at often elusive and protected weakspots to tear them off to do more damage. This essence of studying your target and strategical approach makes for tons of fun with hours on end! Even if you bested the same boss over and over again you come back and the ""worst"" you could say is ""Oh, hello old friend. Is it this time of the tournament again?""

As for controls the game is smooth and swift, the harpooning and spear-throwing going on without issues while requiring your skill to make the most of them. You HAVE items you can use, but one-use items are to aid in a pinch and are never able to one-hit anyone but lesser cannonfodder. They are all about strategic use which you have to time, less the item is wasted or even worse...you! Several spears (not harpoons!) to choose from give you another tactical element to consider which often goes hand-in-hand with the ""runes"" you find. They are passive bonuses which are divided into the ""Spear"" and ""Ship"" group which augment and enhance the respective aspect in many ways. Do you want some poison damage to slowly chip away at the bosses health since you cannot hit him? Do you want higher chances to throw more spears for bursts of Extra-DPS or are you so cocky to use a rune massively boosting your damage while you stand still? The options can be mixed and matched on the spot thanks to a generous inventory size so you can adjust to match every enemy with a tactc befitting him and while there are pattens it is you who sets the pace and approach every time.

To summarize, Blacksea Odyssey is a game about real ""big-game"" huntin in space with options to improve your weapon and ship while challenging you to take on more and more dangerous creatures with 4 different Contestants (3 Unlockable) to choose from and over a dozen harpoons. The closest equivalent would be a Monster Hunter meets Top Down Shooter in Space, although the customization here is not as massive. Taking bosses apart in a literal manner is fun and requires skill which keeps you coming even for bosses you already ended before to see how much better you have become. Fighting them is adrenaline inducing as you are likely fighting for 5 minutes per boss depending how well you do and things never get dull either. I have yet to notice a bug that affected gameplay and it runs smooth without issue and I clearly recommend this for anyone liking themselves some top-down action against big bosses round for round and a handful of RPG-inspired enhancements. Each run is new and yet not, old ""friends"" and new challenges surfacing every new try. Now get out there Contestant and hunt your way to the top in the depths of the Blacksea Odyssey.",1464854377,1464854377,True,3,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Очень необычный, захватывающий геймплей. Враги принимают удары разными частями тела и если избивать только одну, ее нужно оторвать и враг получит очень много урона. Это необходимо делать для эффективной расправы с большими врагами, но с маленькими не обязательно (хотя о чем это я, такой шанс грех упустить).
Некоторые боссы размером аш с целый уровень! И как же приятно им отрывать конечности одну за другой, приближаясь к голове!
Огромное разнообразие: в определенных биомах - определенные враги и боссы. Перед началом раунда вы сами выбираете на какого босса пойти, с какого упадет больше плюшек!
Но некоторые боссы настолько суровы, что без специальных рун на них идти - суицид. И это тоже плюс.
Руны, которые улучшают лодку и копье - улучшайте атаку, комбинируйте, кидайте фаерболы и ядра, ускоряйтесь быстрее и много много других плюшек.
Большое количество расходников - вспышки, мины, бомбы, аптечки, щиты, зелья, стероиды - без них никуда, нужно использовать с умом!
Последние уровни не просто так последние - они реально сложные! 

Игра в раннем доступе, но выглядит потрясно. Желаю разработчикам поскорее завершить ее.

Впервые вижу разработчика которому не плевать на свой проект, продвигают как могут.

Про саму игру сейчас много не скажешь, ибо ранний доступ и контента не так много. В общем, играем мы за космического охотника на иноплатнетную рыбу. Оружие - копья, каждое со своими статами. Дополнительное оружие - гарпун, нанеся определенное количество урона части тела врага, мы можем её оторвать. Вы когда-нибудь отрывали  ж
oпу огромной рыбе? А Левиафана на куски разрывали? А Ктулху? В этой игре сможете оторвать и лицо и жoпу и всё что захочется. Причём отрывать не просто можно, а НУЖНО. Потому что доведенная до ""загарпунивания"" часть тела перестает принимать урон от обычных попаданий. Некоторых боссов можно забить и просто стреляя, но отрывая куски вы убьёте их быстрее.

Но это было бы скучно, если бы не руны! Да. Рунами тут усиливается ваше копьё и ваш корабль. Копьё может иметь элементальные (огонь, лёд, молния и т.д.) атаки, можно ставить модификаторы скорострельности или ""снайпера"". Для корабля отдельные руны - сонар, скорость, воскрешение, фаербол, пушка и т.д. Каждая руна имеет несколько степеней редкости  от Common до Legendary и чем реже руна, тем круче у неё статы. Короче рун тут очень много, я за 13 часов далеко не всё видел.  Так же у нас в арсенале аптечки, стероиды, зелья берсерка и прочие мины с бомбами.

БОССЫ! Варьируются от ""изи-пизи"" Мегаларча до Ктулху который может убить вас одним ударом. Размеры тоже варьируются, бывают боссы размером с обычного моба, а есть боссы которые буквально размером с весь уровень. 

Цель - бить самых крутых боссов и за 7 раундов набрать максимальное количество очков. Хватит ли у вас ""шаров""?

Минусы есть. Это бета и тут куча багов которые то и дело вылазят в очередном апдейте, но e-mail разработчиков есть в самой игре и фидбек они читают. Нашли баг - пишите им. Общаться, правда, придется на английском. :)

Caratteristiche:

Possibilità di fare pezzo per pezzo i nemici
Tutto, dai nemici allo scenario è completamente distruttibile
Gameplay ricco d’azione
Enormi Boss
Achievement di Steam
 

Una volta ogni decennio, i più grandi cacciatori dell’universo si riuniscono per competere in un torneo, noto come il “Blacksea Odyssey“.

 
Nel gioco dobbiamo impersonare uno dei tanti Titani (ognuno caratterizzato in modo differente) ed imbatterci in varie missioni, le quali consistono nel raggiungimento di una creatura colossale per poi abbatterla! Le missioni seppur molto ripetitive sono del tutto randomizzate, e man mano diventano sempre più difficili, per questo bisogna sbloccare: nuove armi e equipaggiamenti!. Ogni mostro ha il suo tallone d’Achille e sta a noi scoprire qual’è,spesso, consiste nell’attaccare il nemico negli occhi, oppure arpionarli strappandogli arti e altre parti del corpo!.

There are a few minor issues but those issues are just things that can be fixed by the devs or not.

Pros:
Accessable by everyone
Game can play on any system
There is a lot of replayability here
The Core Fun - Difficulty Loop is there that doesn't get old or dynamic
Delivers exactly what it promises to us
A wonderfully good time
Plenty of stuff to unlock to make future plays more fun

Cons:
Enemies do a bit too much damage
No Difficulty selection
Cannot carry over items into a permanent inventory

Addictive due to the amount of variety of weapons and enemies you can face, can keep you playing for awhile. The greater-than-screen bosses are fantastic, feel engaging and very real, this game I believe is for people looking for a bit of a challenge. 

Texture wise, its kind of simple but compliments the retro feel of the whole game.

The music is excellent and suits all parts of the game perfectly.

While the game is great, it can feel slightly repetitive with little variety and some stages.

It's a rogue-lite top-down shoot-em-up set in space and you're on a rocket powered surfboard as you fly through the black sea (re: space) throwing spears at space-fish and using your harpoon to violently rip body parts off of these space-fish.

It sounds like bullshit but nothing I said is false or exaggerated.  It's all genuine gameplay and it feels awesome.  It feels great to rip the leg off of a giant space-frog and then finish perforating it with your infinite supply of javelins.  The items all add significant choice of how you alter your gameplay, and the consumables are all fairly interesting.  It's a fun roguelite with a creative setting and a unique aesthetic.

The description claims RPG, but I wish it were removed because the only remotely RPG-like feature is the inventory.

A few complaints:
 - the terrain kinda sucks and is frustrating to move around and is pretty dull in general
 - it's annoying/tedious to find things in the world because the sonar (radar) is small and local and doesn't show chests
 - some elements of the UI don't quite match aesthetically, so there's a weird disconnect (minor complaint at best)
 - the screenshots on this Steam page shows a lot of items but items seem much more rare than the screenshots suggest, leaving you starving for something to equip half the time
 - chests are very underwhelming for how tedious/annoying they are to hunt down

These complaints are all acceptable to me considering how fun the game already is and the fact that this game is in early access makes me hopeful that the devs will address these complaints over time.  And they've promised updates EVERY 7 DAYS.  That's awesome!

Here's a video of my first impresions of the game:

A nice vareity of enemies, a solid feeling gameplay, and I feel a lot of effort being put into this game.

Pros:
A base game to build off of.
Frequent updates
A somewhat unique idea

Cons:
Currently doesn't feel balanced
REALLY RNG HEAVY
You're basically FORCED to use the unique mechanic (Harpoon)

More detail:
The gameplay feels really great, has a nice flow to it.  But whenever there's a heavily damaged part, you have to harpoon it, not allowing you to do any damage to the creature (at least to that part)  I argue that kind of kills the flow of the fight, especially for weaker enemies that are typically smaller.  My suggestion is to make some sort of text indicator while allowing for damage to that part to be felt.

Another complaint more than a few bosses are just giant big dummies with large damage immunity zones that rush you, and in certain areas you get stuck in them that leaves you constantly getting damaged due to you colliding with them, so you die in a couple of seconds.  Personally it makes me feel less like a solid object maybe make the collisions cause both of them to move around from eachother or cause immunity to damge untill the both of you stop colliding?  An example is Mooncrusher.  Giant, and only rushes at you.  While some may feel it fair, I feel it's kind of lazy, hopefully some of it isn't to stay.  Another thing is recycling basic enemies as larger bosses.  Well anyways even though all of that is a problem, the game as much as I hate saying it, is a promising game I only wish to update this again when it releases, I am hoping that it's as good a improvement as I forsee.  The main thing I think needs work though is balance, I read another review saying it was too easy now while that wasnt my experience maybe there's a need for a difficulty option with a wide vareity of options, like oldschool ID software big.

Original review
---------------------------
In it's current early access state I dont feel like I can recommend this game.  After a long session of play I felt really bored.  It's not horrible, not even that bad.  It's just that I cant see much good but I want to say why I dont like this game.

1. A couple subjective things here.  Personally I like some of the graphics others I dont, like the textures on the objects, but I feel like the random level parts are just there and dont add anything, just a bunch of leaves or something not particularly ugly, I just find them un attractive.  And the soundtrack is really not my thing, some of the themes left me with a headache, which is how I discovered that there's either no music option or it's glitched at the moment not allowing me to mute just the music so I muted the game in windows audio.

2. The gameplay.  It feel way too slow because you from the start do low damage, and everyone else does low damage, yet has high health so both you and the enemy are just hitting eachother but it feels like you're going no where.  So I guess the current balance of the game causes pacing issues for me.  The health in addition to the enemies having tons of immune areas, and the bosses mostly being tankier larger versions of regular enemies made a lot of the fights feel boring.  Also the AI feels copy/pasted across all the enemies.  They slightly float around while turning and then randomly dash rather being like most shoot em ups where they have a good constant speed in predictable patterns in some way that still attacks you.  Overall gameplays a bore which made me have to not reccomend the game.

3. WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CHESTS THAT ARE LOCKED ESPECIALLY AT THE START SERIOUSLY I JUST WANT TO OPEN SOME LOOT BEFORE I TAKE ON A BOSS FOR FREAK SAKE GIMME A CHANCE GAME!",1457825342,1461313231,True,1,0,0.44457891583442688,3,False,False,True,False,,,

If you're no stranger to Rogue-like games then you'll find yourself right at home. There are many different builds to discover and content to unlock. Keep in mind that at the time of this review the game is Early Access so bugs and changes are to be expected in the upcoming weeks. My overall experience before writing this review (2 hours) has been great. I don't normally prefer the top down look, but the artwork fits the camera angle well. Gameplay is smooth and you feel in total control of all your actions. Finding new runes to upgrade your weapon and ship is always a blast! My most favorite aspect about this game at this very moment has to be the epic boss battles! I won't spoil much about them, but they are most definitely a challenge that feels amazing to overcome. Each run, (so far) if you expect to go all five rounds, should take about 30-50 minutes. This time for a game session is actually pretty perfect for a quick game every now and then. 

TL:DR, if you're at all a fan of rogue-likes then give this game a shot. The devs are extremely passionate about this title so you'll have no worries of lack of feedback and content as this game progresses. Looking forward to checking out more new characters and bosses soon!

The game forces you to play the tutorial (for good reasoning) and I finished thinking, ""This won't be too hard."" I was definitely wrong about that. Some of the non-boss monsters can sometimes be just as big as the boss in each round and often times just as strong.

Blacksea Odyssey steam early access full review (this took me so long then I accidentally closed the tab and had to make it again XD)

Contains spoilers.

The bosses were incredible and interesting. Puff Daddy was far too difficult at first, but after I got used to him, it became a lot easier. Moonsplitter is absolutely incredible and my favorite design-wise. I don't know why, I just love him. Megalarch and Belch Brothers are great, and NOM NOM NOM?!?!?!?!?!? How do you come up with stuff that creative? Great Ghuza did not disappoint, Wyv the Elder's unique Tri-Breath was great, and Charybdis (I hope I spelled that right) was UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. I mean, the whirpool mouth insta-kill, the crazy under the screen tentacles, the vast number of little sucker-like poison shooters... I mean, I can't find anything to dislike. Here are my only problems. 1. Wyv the Elder has such a fast breath recharge that it's nearly impossible to rip out his tails. Also, his attack range is a bit too wide. 2. Belch Brothers are waaaaaaaaay to easy. 3. Can you even rip off ANYTHING from Puff Daddy? Enemies are all great, except for one stupid little bugger that makes my blood boil... THE SKITTISH LEAP-FROG. The idiotic little monstrosity looks great on the outside, but of the inside he's a green little ball of PURE EVIL. I'd take three belch brothers with my ship at ten hit points over five Skittish Leap-Frogs. Also, I continue to encounter a bug where my harpoon passes straight through enemies. Doesn't happen nearly as often with bosses. Getting stuck on tiny bits of stone or spinning rocks is a problem too, as well as me constantly getting blocked by weird, unbreakable invisible walls that harpoons and spears can pass through as well as enemies. Overall, this game has been an amazing experience and I am proud to have just unlocked Gungnir ;). 4.5 out of 5 stars.

BSO actually almost reminds me of a top-down Shadow of the Collosus. The majority of the game-play revolves around hunting down and killing giant bounties, with each bounty requiring a unique approach. Each enemy in the game, even the small trash mobs that you will have to fight through to get to the big bosses, have components that you can destroy that will weaken their overall fighting capabilities. For example, if fighting a boss that shoots lasers out of it's eye, you can actually focus fire the eye and eventually removing the boss's ability to shoot lasers out of that eye.

BSO also features a Diablo-esque drop system, where the each enemy killed can drop items, including executables that have cool on-cast effects and equipables that give passive boosts. This drop system was actually one of the highlights of the game for me. Once the player accumulates a selection of equipable runes, the game-play starts to become very fun. You go from slowly chipping away at an enemy's defences to destroying entire sections of bosses in only a couple attacks.

My biggest complaint about the game in it's current state is that the early game can be rather off-putting. You kill slow and move slow until you find some rune drops. However, once you find a couple runes, thats when the real game starts. You kill trash mobs super quick, and actually start to feel like the legendary space hunter that you supposedly are. 

In review...
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*] Fun rune system
[*] Music was great
[*] Each boss requires a different approach and strategy
[*] Destroyable environments and monster dismemberment
[*] Some bosses are huge! Ran into one bounty that took up most of the playable arena

[list]
[*] Only one playable character (more on the way)
[*] The early game is slow until you can start equipping runes
[*] Weapon slection is sparse until more options are added
[*] Character development revolves entirely around the drops you find
[/list]

The best way to describe it would be as a twin stick shooter at its core, with permadeath, loot and epic boss fights. Levels are procedurally generated,fully destructible and come with dozens of different creatures to fight against. The tutorial also explains the controls both for keyboard and mouse and controller at the same time so you can choose whichever you prefer.


[h1]The core:[/h1]

The main premisse of the game is pretty simple. Once in every decade, four contestants compete in a hunting tournament to find out who is the greatest hunstman and you play as one of these contestants. This tournament is divided in 5 rounds. Between rounds you’ll be placed on the Blacksea map, here there is some text dialogue between the contestants, they brag about previous deeds and mock each other. It is on the Blacksea map that you can visit the shop to sell your unwanted items or buy new ones and it is also here that you can choose different bounties to take. 

Each bounty has its own description, such as difficulty level and stats such as “-% enemy damage” or “-% credits dropped”, aswell as the amount of credits you’ll earn upon completion. They are also divided into different biomes such as Tropical (green) and Crystal (blue). Each biome will reflect the enemies you’ll encounter once you’re there.

The boss and overall creature design is pretty damn good. The game does a really good job in showing you which body parts are weak spots and what kind of attacks that enemy has. Not only that, but no two creatures look the same.

During bounties you can choose either to farm credits by killing lesser creatures or you can go right away for the boss. After killing the boss you’ll complete the bounty and then you’ll be awarded score points based on your performance. It is these points that will rank you in comparison with the other contestants.

While playing you’ll also find chests that contain loot and that can be opened with keys, keys which you’ll find by killing enemies. In Blacksea Odyssey, loot is presented in the form of runes and potions that improve both your ship and your weapon. That said, this is where progression comes into place. Right now there is only one playable character, The Old Man, but more are on the way and I assume that each will fit a specific playstyle and each  will have its ups and downs. You’ll also be able to choose one of various spears to choose from. each with its own passive bonus and specific stats.

[h1]Combat[/h1]

This is main part of the game so let me do my best to explain how it works. Besides attacking with your spear, you can also throw your harpoon into the creatures and use it to rip body parts off or to slow down said creature. However you can’t just spam both your spear and harpoon because some enemies have armoured body parts. This forces you to keep moving and flanking your enemies so you can deliver a fatal blow to their weak spots. 

It is also worth mentioning that your ship has a booster built into it. This booster is divided into three different types, short boost, medium boost or long boost. Using the short one will use up one boost bar, the medium will use two bars and the long one will use three bars. This is very helpfull to escape from tight situations and to open passage on terrain, thus proving to be a life saver at times. 

So, if you haven’t guessed already, the combat is very fast paced and you’ll find yourself using your boost to dodge and using your harpoon  at the right moment to slow down your foes and deal tons of damage.

One thing that bothered me at first was the fact that the camera is very close to your ship, but you also have a sonar to guide you, which will show you where creatures are on your minimap, as well as rock formations.

[*]Astonishingly good music
[*]Fast paced combat
[*]Stylish visuals
[/list]

Blacksea Odyssey is as solid as a rock can be. It has tons of potential and I trust the developers to improve the game, since they update every 7 days if I’m not mistaken. The only thing that it needs right now is more unlockable characters and weapons (perhaps ships as well?). The combat is refined and extremely enjoyable and everytime you defeat a boss you feel like you’ve accomplished something great.

I highly recommend Blacksea Odyssey to people who enjoy hectic and fast paced fights with enough enemy variety to force you to adapt to new situations.",1457281776,1457285467,True,40,0,0.790498614311218262,6,False,False,True,False,,,

The random element of what runes you get, or what bounties are available, adds onto the difficulty factor, but not in a bad way. I would compare it to the randomness of item rooms and floors in the Binding of Isaac.

I don't usually write these, but this is a really good game; it's unique, fun, and in general the more they add the more potential it gets. I cannot recommend this enough!

It's an odd cross of monster hunter, and roguelikes. It has that same pulsepounding feeling at times when you're up against a big enemy and have very little health. I imagine it'll only get better too (Especially if/when they extend max # of rounds). I really enjoy this, that's all I can say!

More fish and stuff than before! I now have seen more depth to the characters, combinations of runes and spear types, and it's just.. so good.

You are armed with a rune infused spear to pierce your enemies and a harpoon to detach limbs, being quick and accurate is a must as you evade persistent strikes and try to land your harpoon into the colossal creatures…ehmm..tentacle?…fin?…eye? 
You start off with the only character available which is the Old Man, I’m assuming you’ll be able to unlock other characters later in the game. You get to see the Old Mans stats and learn about his back story. After you read about his epic beard and bionic arm you go to the weapon select screen which has a variety of weapons to choose from but you only get to select the Crude Spear as the other weapons you need to unlock. Now your on the map where you can choose different sectors to hunt your prize bounty! Colossal creatures have epic names like Nom Nom Nom and Magalarch, they also come with a range of difficulty and different stats for enemies in the sector such as all enemies on the map will have reduced damage or you can also have reduced item drops. There is an item shop that sells equipment to recover hit points for your ship and increase your damage, but just remember once you die you lose everything! Overall I love the whole concept of this game from the epic boss battle music that gets you pumped to the Old Man surfing on his space ship. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves shooters and ripping giant space creatures to shreds!

You are one of the badass looking whalers, who entered the competition to beat everyone else (and not die in the process).

Generally, the game's more or less your typical rogue-lite twin-stick shooter.
You get to fly around, shoot spears at space fish (I guess that's fish?), buy upgrades and consumables, upgrade your spear and your ship (which looks more like a hoverboard).
Additionally, you can unlock more characters with different stats and perks and arm them with variety of spears that also have different stats.
That'd be pretty average if this game didn't have two things that distinguish it from the rest.
First thing is absolutely crazy art style and monsters design. I can imagine some people might not like it, but I personally loving it - it fits the game very well.
The second, more important, thing is ""rip off"" mechanic. 
The idea is that all monsters you hunt have vulnerable parts. And if you want to defeat them quicker - you can weaken those parts and then use your harpoon to rip them off dealing massive damage.
It's not easy to pull this off, especially on more protected monsters, but it feels pretty awesome being able to pull this move off :D
You can of course just keep shooting and kill monsters the traditional way, although it takes quite some time this way.

There are couple of issues and minor annoyances in the game at the moment.
Chests are not shown on the minimap so it's a bit tricky and somewhat annoying to search for them.
Minor UI glitches, spears missing targets (my guess is hitboxes need tweaking) and other small things.
Nothing game breaking was noticed. And devs are promising updates every 7 days.

So, if you like rogue-lite twin-stick shooters and theme with new mechanic does sounds good - go for it.
The game's pretty cheap and very enjoyable for what it is.

Part top down shooter, part rogue-lite, with RPG qualities, this is Captain Ahab in space meets Shadow of Colossus. It's challenging, fun, and original. Ripping apart space creature limbs is oh so satisfying. Finally this game gets an Early Access release. These guys LISTEN to fans, so whatever you feel like asking for need fix, be vocal. These guys are promising a new update every 7 days until full release. That's pretty damn awesome! (But not as awesome as harpooning a mile long Kraken in the face).

- Top down visuals are interesting, I love the light effect along the envirionment but nothing compares to the titanic boss fights.
- Titanic boss fights.
- You harpoon things. LIke you harpoon limbs and RIP them off. It doesn't get much better than that my friends.

- Needs full controller support and refinement (Keyboard and Mouse work really well though)

Your character fights with a spear (basically an infinite ammo pistol), and a harpoon that needs to be charged up to use, but does more damage and can tear off weakened pieces of enemies to inflict major damage and reduce their functionality. 

This harpoon adds depth to all encounters. Instead of indiscriminate firing, you can repeatedly spear a particular body part (such as an eye that shoots poison darts) and eventually harpoon it and rip it out. As a result, no more poison darts while you finish it off.

Gameplay video, including four bosses:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flzjrYgLGn0

Each round of the game (out of 5), you choose a bounty to go after. You'll always have a choice of 2-4 randomly chosen bosses, each offering different difficulty and potential rewards. 

Then you launch into space. You start by exploring, looking for regions where you can encounter groups of smaller enemies, which will earn you small bounty, and if you're lucky, power-ups. If you're very lucky, a dead fish will drop a key that opens a chest that may contain runes - more on that later. And if you kill all enemies in a region, that results in bonus bounty at the level's end (as does speedrunning the level).

Once you've done everything you want to, you can go and find the boss, which will be lurking under the surface (of, er, space). Fight the boss, earn a huge bounty explosion, and move onto the next round.

But man, the bosses! They're brilliantly designed with a great art style and each demanding different fight strategies. Some are more traditional bullet-sponges, others level-swallowing mouths with vast tentacles. Others are armoured pyramids with a death-star exhaust port to fire into. And the biggest boss, the leviathan, can fill half the level and has teeth for DAYS.

Each boss (like all enemies, in fact) is designed to scale to different sizes. At ""elite"" scale, the leviathan's mouth ALONE is several screens long. These encounters can be genuinely breathtaking.

It helps that your old man controls so well, once you get used to the ""surf-like"" turning. Once you master it, it allows you to dodge all manner of bullet hells. A controller is ideal for this movement, but I ended up on keys and mouse because I found aiming easier (and the game struggled to interpret some of the gamepad buttons reliably for me).

Roguelike elements mean each level is created afresh, although none of the layouts are particularly memorable, they're just arenas for the fighting and make you have to explore a bit. 

What is more memorable is the rune system - this is a great game for people who love to repeatedly play to hope to come across the rarest runes. They power up your ship and spear, but come in different rarities - some of the most powerful rare ones are nuts, but you'll hardly ever get to use them. You can also fiddle with the rune loadout to pick the ones that suit your play style. Shame nothing carries over from game to game (at time of writing, at least).

Only real niggles - the spear collision on some of the smaller enemies can be a bit off. You can use either mouse & keyboard or controller, but each have their weakness. Some of the easier bosses can be a chore once you've fought them a lot. You can have bad runs where you simply never find any power-ups. 

In summary, I love this. There's still loads of new content to come over early access, but it's great already. Highly recommended.
