ASA is the first game in the franchise, which consists of 4 main games + 1 free prequel. The game (and series in general) centers around a mysterious black cube that floats in space and possesses hypnotic powers. Our nameless astronaut is drawn to the cube and finds himself in a spaceship called Ark. The minute he steps into the ship the cube is stolen from him by another astronaut and he becomes trapped inside the Ark. Our hero needs to solve the riddles of the Ark and retrieve the cube to get back to his homeworld.

Positive:

- Puzzles are the most important element in this genre and they are well done in this game (with a tiny exception I will mention in the negative part). There is a very nice dose of variety; deciphering number systems, hacking into computers, geometry puzzles, searching clues in diaries etc. The pacing of difficulty is also well done, initial puzzles are easy without becoming boring and the later puzzles are difficult without being frustrating, It is clear that developer played many Myst-like games and learned what works and do not work in this genre.

- Sci-Fi elements are more than window-dressing . It is clear that the author has a deep love for Sci-Fi; the story, exposition and atmosphere of the game is very captivating. There are lot of inspirations from classic Sci-Fi novels (2001 being the most evident one) and the especially towards the end game ends up delivering a lot more than being ""Myst in space"".

- Graphics are above average in general, however the cutscenes are surprisingly good for an indie game.

Negative:

- Navigation is very messy. The environments are simple, however because camera angles change so abruptly it gets unnecessarily complicated to draw a mental map in your head or getting from point A to point B. I eventually got used to it, but I think this aspect will be very frustrating to first-time players.

- There is one very under-clued puzzle towards the end, which kind of ruins the perfect puzzle design streak the game had up to that point. What makes it worse is, the clue for the puzzle becomes unreachable when you encounter with this puzzle, and hence if you didn't take note of the clue before, the puzzle becomes unsolvable. What make it even more worse is, once you understand how the puzzle works it is actually a very cool idea, I really wish it was implemented better. Fortunately there is a final puzzle after that one, which was a joy to solve and ends the game on a high point.

- ASA is a bit on the short side, I think the game could have used at least 25% more content. 

Conclusion:

ASA is a very promising start to the Black Cube series. Although it is far from perfect, the puzzles and atmosphere/story are mostly very good and it is definitely worth your time if you are looking for a solid Myst-like game.

This game deserves some note for it being literally the only game I have played which manages to have a less good navigation system than Myst. And Myst came out in the 90s so it gets a pass. You can't tell where you are, or what anything is. The very first room you start in has such insane perspective warping you can't tell what's going on. Good thing you have a little robot voice to tell you what you can click on and what objects are, because you won't understand otherwise! Every time you move forward, it changes perspective. So one screen you are standing on the floor, the next you are looking down at the room from the cieling, the next you look up from the floor. It's like you're a spider. Each shot is composed horribly, so you can't tell how things are oriented. This is inexcusable considering Myst mostly solved these problems in the 1990s and only got better from there.

So that aside, the puzzles that I've seen aren't really good. They don't really have any reason for being what they are, just kind of random stuff that is put there arbitrarily. The story seems okay, but it seems to be mostly revealed through very boring voice acting of digital diary entries. I might give it another go since I didn't play that long, but I think it's just a no from me.

His attention to detail in terms of the alien language, numbering system, technology, etc. pulled me in from the very beginning. He is also a master at creating (very) challenging puzzles which will make you stretch intellectually. Thus, you feel a sense of real accomplishment when you solve them. 

ASA is an early game with an interface that makes navigation puzzling at times. However, once you get used to it, you will be zipping around the ARK and the planets without thinking twice. The art and music are beautifully done and I enjoyed the voice acting. Using a dairy and various artifacts, the game tells a full story of the astronaut who preceded you.

This is not a game for everyone. You need to be a problem solver who is patient and willing to use a pen and paper extensively. It is likely that you will need to peek at the walk-through at least a couple of times while playing this game. Not for full solutions, but to get additional details on how to solve some of the puzzles. I did not see this as a failure on my part... just part of the playing the game.

If you enjoy immersing yourself in another world and taking time to savor the process of discovery and working through the various challenges, then I highly recommend this game (as well as others in the Black Cube series: Myha Return to the Lost Island and Boinihi: The K'i Codex)",1591501938,1591502257,True,12,0,0.665797054767608643,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is also quite absorbing, creating an atmosphere that gets you playing comfortably immersed in the environment and setting it creates. The music contributes tremendously to that, as well as the good voice acting of the protagonist of the logs you collect. 

Graphics are ok, but navigating through them feels strange in some instances due to weird angles (images are static in most cases, so is not a problem of camera navigation, rather of artistic choice of perspective).

Puzzles are good and interesting in general, making you think quite a bit on how to find the solution. It is one of those 'old school' games that forces you to take notes on paper (or screen shots of a clue with your cellphone in my case, to access relevant information while completing the corresponding puzzle) to be able to complete the difficult ones. I particularly enjoy that, as it makes you think beyond just 'trial and error: click on everything and use every object with each other'

Overall, quite a good recommendation, especially for sci-fi and space narrative fans.

- puzzles are logical, you just have to be observant

- i would say it's a no-nonsense game - not a lot of the annoying things-you-have-to-do-before-you-get-to-point-B sort of fillers
- I like the music
- the story can engage the player, and that makes the ending pretty chilling.

CONS:
- the directional movement is confusing and quite redundant on some points. mostly confusing.
- i would hugely appreciate a note/picture-taking feature.
- wish the game's window size can be adjusted. the feature isn't there and my game opened at lower resolution, in a window, and stuck at the upper left, about 3/4s, of my screen (normal reso 1920x1080). don't think there's full-screen adjustment capability either.

Among the former was the locked door in the house on Kepler (perhaps this could be fixed by [spoiler] making it clear who lived in that house? [/spoiler] ) and among the latter were the computer puzzle (in which the commands work inconsistently and even the developer's own walkthrough didn't work for me) and the fact that I was able to pick up the silver key without opening the book first (if you're the developer or have made it far enough, you know what I'm talking about). Nonetheless, one of the best parts of this game is its soundtrack; I would highly recommend picking it up if you're into videogame soundtracks. Also, the puzzles are fairly unique and interesting, the story is decent, and the overall world is fun to explore.

Asa è un avventura in prima persona a schermate statiche.
Gioco myst-like a tema spaziale. L'inizio è affascinante: ci troviamo in una stazione spaziale (quasi) disabitata, il primo enigma ci richiede di inserire una combinazione usando un sistema numerico alieno; qui si evidenzia la prima caratteristica del gioco: dovrete giocarlo con un taccuino in mano e segnarvi le cose che scoprite, visto che il gioco non fornisce nessun supporto in questo senso. La cosa è semplice all'inizio ma diventa più complicata quando bisogna avere tutto l'alfabeto alieno sott'occhio o una sequenza di 42 numeri(!) da inserire nel giusto ordine. Già da questo potete capire da soli se siete pronti per questo approccio ""Old-Shool"" o se non avete il tempo o la voglia di sbattevi a questi livelli. 

Tecnicamente siamo su discreti livelli, per quanto siano antiquate le schermate statiche, generalmente però tutto sembra abbastanza grezzo, e non potrebbe essere altrimenti visto che è un gioco realizzato da una sola persona. La trama è  interessante, con qualche richiamo a 2001"":Odissea nello spazio"". Il problema principale per me sono alcuni degli enigmi veramente troppo estremi, visto che non solo dovremo avere le informazioni giuste nel nostro fido taccuino, ma dovremmo anche ricordaci tutti gli indizi che troviamo nella nostra esplorazione, i quali saranno fondamentali per capire la logica di alcuni enigmi che altrimenti sembreranno del tutto senza senso, rendendo pressoché impossibile ad esempio giocarlo solo nel weekend.

Insomma il gioco non è bocciato del tutto, chi ha voglia di dedicarsi e impegnarsi a fondo questo è il gioco giusto, per tutti gli altri il gioco risulterà fin troppo ostico.",1548353006,1548353006,False,5,0,0.546660780906677246,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This review is about the RE version.

I am surprised that this game has so few reviews with many negative ones. Except for the voice acting, I found that it was quite an impressive and enjoyable puzzle game. The story was pretty interesting and directly inspired from 2001.

You are an astronaut. While working outside your space station, you see an enigmatic black cube floating close by.
Intrigued, you leave the safety of your station, trying desperately to catch it. Finally reaching it, you find yourself low on oxygen, unable to go back to your station. You lose consciousness, and wake up on a mysterious alien spaceship, named the ark by a previously rescued astronaut. Having no idea where you are, you start following the notes he left everywhere, trying to uncover the secrets of this spaceship, and maybe find a way to go back home.

To advance in the game, you have to solve a wide variety of puzzles (not one puzzle is the same). For this, you will need to read everything you find, and pay careful attention to your whole surrounding. Like Myst, Rhem games and the like, you will have to take notes. I never took so many screenshots in a game. Clues are just everywhere and can be anything. I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles. 
Puzzles complexity is diverse and ranges from easy to impossible (for one puzzle).
Be ready to do a lot of trials and errors to solve some of the puzzles. Persistence is a requirement.
There is just one puzzle at the end that is way too hard to figure out by yourself. 


In addition to the alien spaceship, you also have the possibility to explore two planets (and a satellite).
Because of the wide diversity of the environment, every rooms, places are different, you never get bored, and are just curious to see where you are going to explore next. 
There are also two possible endings to choose from.

The background music also fits nicely with the surroundings.

The only thing I did not like was the voice acting, which I found pretty useless. An option to disactivate it would have been most welcome, or was there? There are two voices in the game, the previously rescued astronaut diary voice, and an AI voice (from your space suit?).
First, I did not see the point of having to hear the astronaut voice everytime one clicks on a section of his diary. It's more distracting than anything else, since one reads faster than the guy talks. Also, if you make the mistake of clicking twice on the section you want to read, the reading voice will start twice simultaneously...
So, I ended up turning off the sound while reading the diary. And just so you know, you cannot skip the reading part because the diary contains many clues to solve the puzzles. I would recommend reading the story of the other astronaut anyway since it is necessary to understand the plot. 

Also, I did not really understand the true purpose of the AI voice. Was it intended to give us hints, or simply to keep us company while being all alone on an unknown spaceship?
It could have been seriously improved, since most of what she said was pretty obvious or just made me feel like a small kid:  I find a scalpel, and the AI tells me ""leave it here, you could cut yourself!""; I look over some handrail, and she tells me: ""be careful not to fall!"". Oh well... It would have been great if it could have been funny...


In all, while looking past the voice acting part, I most definitely recommend this game. Puzzles were fun, the exploration and story quite interesting. 
I am looking forward to the next games of this developper.

-------------------------------

The game ran flawlessly on a windows 7 laptop. But here are a few glitches I encountered:
- Simultaneous reading voices can be heard if you click several times on the same diary section (you are not supposed to do that, but well I did it...).
- on Planet Kepler, in one of the houses, I first found a locked door with a keypad on the side asking to solve some mysterious equation. When I came back later to try to solve it, the locked door and keypad had disappeared. At their place was a shelf. I first thought it was a different house looking the same, but I looked everywhere and never found the first house again. If anyone has any hint about this first mysterious house, I would be interested to know.
- outside the spaceship, after coming back from the satellite Cobalt, if you decide to turn around, the satellite is gone. You have to go back inside the spaceship, then exit again for the satellite to be there again.
- after advancing in the game, some objects previously found, reappeared (copper wire, dark rock, bird fruit) and could be then needlessly used again.

----------------

Maybe spend a buck or two on it if you really like the genre (but there are other short game that you can get for the same cost that are less annoying).
I got this cause I saw Catyph released, and was curious about this earlier game (ASA) before I tried Catyph. Pros and Cons:
+ Science Fiction point-and-click with a somewhat interesting story
+ Some of the puzzles in the later parts of the game are nice (but getting there is a problem, see below)
+/- Myst/Rhem-like movement, where you click on an arrow at the edge of the screen to turn or move. Suffers from the ""Railroading"" problems of similar games (i.e. ""Why can't I move *there*?"") and the panning is non-intuitive.
+/- One music puzzle about halfway in (I had already turned off the sound by then because of the dismal voice acting)
- Game window showed up as tiny area at top of screen regardless of my resolution, I had to use the Windows magnifier to play the game.
- Voice acting sounded bored [EDIT: I've assumed the voice-over is the protagonist's voice, but could it be the AI in your space suit? It's not clear at all. If so, then I might excuse this as an artistic choice, but it should be made clear]
- Inventory tab that mysteriously disappears (click the right mouse button to recover, had to search online for this)
- Trouble implementing puzzle solutions with the interface
(mild spoilers ahead)





[spoiler]There's a puzzle with wires that you have to arrange correctly. I figured out the solution, but I couldn't figure out how to move the wires so they were in the right location. Frustrated, I re-checked my solution, and tried again several times. Finally got past the puzzle probably due to random chance. Checked an on-line walkthrough and I had the right solution in the first place.

There's a puzzle with decimal coordinates on a grid. The grid is divided by several major lines, and 4 minor divisions between each of them. One would think that the divisions would go, for example, 0.0 then 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. But they actually go from 0.0 to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and then 1.0.  There's nothing in the puzzle that implies this, the number system isn't base-5 or anything unusual. Again, the puzzle was easy, but inputting the correct solution was annoying.

Some of the other puzzles are sufficiently obtuse that even with the walkthrough, I had no idea what the objective was (i.e. the 2 rows of 6 buttons). Too bad, since there are a few good puzzles towards the end.[/spoiler]",1487428967,1602011094,False,13,0,0.632502317428588867,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Game starts out strong and does a decent job being a Myst-like.  Then about an hour in you come across a computer you need to log into.  Once logged in, you're forced to deal with the worst computer simulation I've ever seen.  It was like Satan himself had to design a frustration device.  You look up what to do because you don't hate yourself enough to deal with that only to find yourself figuring out a music note puzzle (with one portion hidden just to screw you more) and it's time to just call it a loss.

It lacks some of the polish that those games had, but still has an interesting story, beautiful environments, and some clever (albeit easy) puzzles.

Pros:
+Extremely good prerendered animations and screens
+Unique sci-fi story told through diaries and the environment
+Very nice soundtrack
+Most of the puzzles are good

Cons
-Puzzles are mostly very easy...
-...with the exception of one puzzle near the end which makes absolutely no sense. Even after reading a walkthrough, I still didn't understand it. (this was the only puzzle I needed a walkthrough for)
-The game lacks polish; most of the animations don't ""line up"" with the screens correctly, so they just suddenly cut and start which breaks immersion.
-On the subject of polish, I found a prerender which contains a texture that has a very clear watermark on top of it. This kind of stuff really shouldn't slip through.
-Many animations show the player character from the third person, and some of the screens are shown from camera angles that the player character clearly couldn't be standing from. This isn't a big deal, it's just one of my pet-peeves as it breaks immersion for me. If you take a look at RHEM and Myst, these games always remain in first-person and all of the prerendered stills are always taken from camera angles that make sense for the player to be standing.

I launched the game for the very first time and was treated to perhaps the [i]only[/i] menu screen to leave an impression on me. I've included a link at the end of this review of a video of the menu screen.

Now I'm sure everyone is wondering what is so significant about a simple menu screen, and I will confess that the menu screen alone doesn't amount to much in any game. However it was what the menu screen represented that was important. Here you have a space adventure game, essentially Myst meets 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the first thing I see upon launching it up is a cinematic reel with short scenes that feel like they could be from a movie like 2001: A Space Odyssey and a chilling song to enhance the effect. Before I have even hit the play button I'm already asking questions about what's going on and the air of mystery and wonder has already been created.

So the question remains, does everything after hitting Play stand up to this menu screen I'm raving about?

In short, in my humble opinion, yes, it absolutely does.

ASA: A Space Adventure is in fact very similar to Myst, a slightly modernized version but still very true to the Myst style. A mysterious black cube appears nearby your spacecraft and lures you out, the next thing you know you're on-board a mysterious ship named 'The Ark'. From then on out, you are left to sift through diary entries left by one Philippe Forte and other clues to try and piece together what has happened on the Ark.

What ensues is a well paced science fiction adventure that hits all the right notes and maintains a good balance of feeding you parts of the story while maintaining an air of mystique. I was particularly impressed with the puzzles in this game. If you played many modern point and click style puzzle games you've no doubt come across a few puzzles whose solutions just seem inane. While some of ASA's puzzles tripped me up for awhile, at no point did I find any of the solutions dissatisfying, and in fact I enjoyed the problem solving process very much in this game. For many puzzles, figuring out the solution requires walking around and finding clues and taking notes. I have about seven or eight pages of notes, diagrams, and solutions that I had to write out, I even used a piece of graphing paper for one puzzle. The fact that I had to take notes alone was very satisfying.

The story in the game is just as impressive as the puzzling is. I found that throughout the game there is always a feeling of mystery and wonder, there are always questions, even at the conclusion of the game (there is a sequel in the works as of this writing called Catyph). Alien worlds, alien races, a gigantic mysterious ship...it is most definitely a full fledged science fiction setting. I have mentioned 2001: A Space Odyssey before, drawing similarities to the mystery and oddity of it all, but I also got Interstellar and Stargate vibes as well from the story. Regardless of influences or similarities though, I definitely found the story was well told and was fused together with the puzzles very nicely.

There is, unfortunately, very few games like Myst in today's market, which I find a shame as it's the perfect medium for telling mysterious science fiction stories via a puzzle game. This game is superbly executed and remarkably imaginative, and it's a shame that it's such a hidden gem since it deserves so much more attention and consideration than it currently receives. Anyone at all interested in Myst-esque games [i]or[/i] science fiction adventures should not hesitate to give ASA: A Space Adventure a shot, it's a pleasant and interesting experience that is well worth your time.

Se bene le lacune tecniche siano evidenti, soprattutto negli spostamenti , troppo macchinosi e confusionari a tratti, questo gioco offre un esperienza davvero particolare, con una trama che convince da subito e intriga, al punto da farci andare avanti per scoprire tutti i segreti che il gioco ci offre. Degno di nota è il lato artistico del gioco infatti, che ricrea la giusta atmosfera e a tratti stupisce per il gusto puramente estetico, se bene come già detto le carenze tecniche siano evidenti anche qui.
Da lodare anche i vari enigmi, questi non risulteranno praticamente mai fuori luogo, saranno coerenti con la trama e lasciano libero spazio all’interpretazione, quasi mai infatti dovremo cercare particolari oggetti da usare o chiavi per aprire una porta, sarà invece più probabile che dovremo cercare un codice da decifrare per scoprire la combinazione per proseguire, ecco che quindi diventa importantissimo prendere appunti nell’arco della nostra avventura, troveremo infatti annotazioni incisioni e quant’altro che ci possa aiutare ma non porteremo praticamente nulla con noi, sarà quindi necessario annotarsi tutto quello che ci sembra interessante, non sarà necessario trovare tutti gli indizi per proseguire dunque, a volte riusciremo noi stessi a trovare la soluzione senza aiuti, questo da grandi soddisfazioni a volte.
Mi sento di consigliare questo gioco ma solo a chi ha una buona dose di pazienza e chi ama le avventure grafiche alla “Myst”, siamo di fronte ad un ottimo gioco ma con una forte impronta old school, che non soddisfa tutti i palati con i suoi toni pacati e a tratti frustranti.

Despite having played it already, I was greatly looking forward to the Steam release - hopefully it can help this wonderful game get some more exposure. 

ASA is a broadly ""Myst-like"" (i.e. first person puzzle-heavy) sci-fi adventure game. If you're a fan of exploration and puzzle solving (studying notes to decipher passwords, exploring the world's nooks and crannies, discovering mysterious contraptions and figuring out their purpose, etc.), then you're bound to love ASA. The puzzles are particularly great, being both challenging [i]and[/i] logical - a rare feat for any adventure game.

I'm a big fan of Myst-likes, and having played a whole lot of them, from the Myst series itself to Zork: Grand Inquisitor or the more obscure ones like Schizm or Obsidian, I can safely say that ASA's puzzles and atmosphere are among the best in this subgenre.",1425648589,1425660557,True,42,0,0.810008108615875244,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The game features a slideshow style presentation similar to games such as Myst in which you move forward image-by-image rather than free movement as in a shooter. Although this might seem like a turnoff to many players this method of presentation is really one of ASA’s strengths. It allowed the developer to create very photo-realistic surroundings for you to explore and ensure you see all the sites from the best angles. The result is a game that makes the world feel more real as though you could walk into it and well realized enough that you would want to.
Like games such as Myst, ASA aims to challenge you with difficult but logical puzzles that you may need to write out to help figure out the solutions. The puzzles feel very natural to the environment and although you may struggle to figure them out are very rewarding. 
The story for ASA is one that I found very engaging. During the game, you will find journals left behind by a previous explorer. You will explore the adventures of the previous individual through these journals while also making your own and learning a little of the history of a rather fantastic place that you will get to explore.",1425615381,1425615381,True,18,0,0.662492871284484863,0,False,False,False,False,,,
