Die Grafik ist wirklich schlecht und nicht mehr zeitgemäß, die Animationen sind grausig. Das Mining bringt viel zu viel Geld, was einen dazu bewegt, sich zu fragen, warum man überhaupt was anbauen sollte. Die Charaktere laufen gar nicht rum und es gibt allgemein zu wenige... das Dorf lebt einfach nicht. Die Zauberer habe ich noch nie in ihrem Haus angetroffen, um ihre Dienste in Anspruch zu nehmen. Am Anfang nerven mich die ganzen Sequenzen tierisch! Und wenn mal eine ist, ist sofort der ganze Tag vorbei. Die meisten Gebäude sind schnell wieder hergerichtet, es fehlt die Motivation weiter zu spielen. Ich bin mittlerweile im Sommer und habe gar keinen Kalender... gibt es Events?

 - The merchant is in different spots everyday ugh

If you take this mobile app as a serious PC game (which it's not), it's a basic StarDew Valley like farming/adventure/business sim game where you run around a cartoony/anime styled Final Fantasy esque farm and plant and sell cabbages etc through monotonous repetition of basic tasks.  Is this fun?  Of course not.  There's also a crappy, badly written family friendly story that's mostly just a wrapper to get you into the monotonous seed planting/garden watering.  At least the graphics look slightly better than Stardew Valley?  Which is a lot like saying one midget is slightly taller than another.

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The artwork here is terrible, it's somewhere between old retro pixel ""art"" and early 32 bit console graphics, used as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It seems the developer really didn't know what they were doing, couldn't manage to do contemporary graphics, but didn't want to go retro, so they just sort of lifted the old console graphics and dumped them into the mobile app.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget to arrange someone who can do graphics properly, or lack of talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result of these decisions.

Bewilderingly, the mobile app doesn't include proper audio controls, so you can't turn off the annoying background music, you'll need to alt+tab out and stop the music using the Windows sound mixer.  This is obviously not okay and it's unclear why the developers chose not to include this basic feature.

There's no options to change the resolution for the mobile app or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this mobile app is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this mobile app will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality mobile phone graphics.  Some of this is due to the mobile app heritage of the game and some of it just seems to be because the developer couldn't be bothered updating the graphics they took from console and dumped into the app stores.  Case in point, some of the intersituals are 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio... that's just sloppy, but that laziness demonstrates clearly the disdain the developer here holds towards PC gamers.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the mobile app unplayable for differently-abled gamers.  PC gamers will be insulted by the presence of console peasant children's toy controller prompts, despite this being on PC.  Developers should try to be aware which platform they're developing for.

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this mobile app garbage carries the eye watering price of $20 USD, on app stores, it's still overpriced at $15 USD (ouch). Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay FIVE BUCKS MORE for a cheap mobile app just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  The developers here genuinely are trying to mislead gamers into thinking this has parity with cheaper AAA games like Red Dead Redemption 2, Monster Hunter Rise, Euro Truck Sim 2, Horizon Zero Dawn... the list goes on.  And in what level of hell do these mobile app developers think mobile apps on PC are worth $20???!?!

This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this is a mobile app, is priced to insult and gouge PC gamers, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.  Just who do they think we are?",1685161634,1685161976,False,5,2,0.317695558071136475,0,False,False,False,True,,,

When I first bought this for my lady and I, I had a light of hope that it would be good…

…and I was pleasantly surprised.

Now sure, at first impression it looks like a mobile game without the pay to win features and it kind of makes Farmville look amazing in comparison, yet I still find it a good game, and it only gets better once you beat the main storyline.

It isnt what the old games were, but I've sunk 20+ hours into it according to my profile and I like it more and more as I progress. I feel engaged in my day-to-day farming life (and it takes up my day!) like I haven’t since A New Beginning. The Story of Seasons games haven’t been doing it for me and I feel the series has gotten a little too far away from the farming aspect I fell in love with all the way back on the SNES.

Graphically, the juxtaposition between character models and backgrounds is pretty bad. The models themselves are fine and fairly expressive during skits and I find the whole thing looks a lot better zoomed all the way out.

There are crop variations and mutations to suss out for even MORE profits which really provides a lot of fiddling around and experimentation for those like me who enjoy that sort of thing. There are guides for those who don’t.

I actually had a hard time choosing a marriage candidate this time around(!) which I haven’t had a hard time choosing in years. Usually I choose to live my life out in voluntary celibacy because all of the choices are awful. I was essentially a hermit in A New Beginning because I hated the marriage candidates so much.

I could continue but in short, check it out for yourself. There are a lot of people frolicking through the reviews with a vendetta against Natsume for trying to do the series honor. Their budget is a lot smaller than Marvelous’s and I think they made a solid attempt with Light of Hope and got pretty darn close. 

So far my only gripe is that there could have been more development between villagers. I’m almost through my first summer and they are... fairly repetitive.

Also, you can’t marry Sam because, like, he’s got a wife but, like, I haven’t seen her nor do I think he’s even called her by her name so I don’t see why I can’t be his second family. I’m championing for a DLC. Homewrecking on the Homestead. I’d give them ten bucks easy for that sort of story telling.

2. Decent gameplay, themes and control. I like the fact that we no longer need to select tools. Just stand in front of things (tree, soil, rocks etc) and press action button, and the right tool will be selected.
3. Zero combat. I prefer my chill, farming games with zero combat because I have no chill when it comes to combat. I would prioritize purchasing farming games with zero combat. ""Gentle"", ""kind"", ""idyllic"" are the keywords I focus on when it comes to farming games.

Improvement needed (IMHO):
1. Graphics. I prefer games with beautiful, 3D looking graphics. I dislike simplistic, 2D looking or pixel art. Modern graphics card can do so much more. This game's graphics has a lot of room to improve.

Pixel art with 3d is kinda weird mash together and it doesn't work.. Whats more is they have made maybe 3 new characters in the last four games maybe. They are reused characters there is nothing new about this. 

The whole game is meant to be farming and relationship building yet half of everyone isn't even available at times not even in their house, they are just gone. No one even walks to an area but vanishes into place just filling any form of normality to the game. All of the magic users are horrible to even talk to in their homes as all they do is give either pointless information or tell you what to do next so you get no form of seeing who they are outside of the events. Even if you get events they have shallow and uninteresting personalities. And if you can't romance the villager they don't matter. They have less personality than a rock. On top of that when you do have events and you talk who knows what you are saying. Your character talk and you don't get to know what they are saying, you have to guess. 

And then the DLCs, pay money to get to unlock more tools, people to romance, or events. Wowie. Swoon the king of the underworld for 2 dollars and regret life as he is the most unattractive model every made in any harvest moon game.

It has dungeons and some action which is a great addition to such games in my opinion.

This Harvest Moon game isn't as good as the other games of the series.
But my main problem is its bugs and some problems the game has.

First launch, game is bugged, i can't refill the watering can, i can't remove plants, game is bugged, had to restart the game, that's a pretty good start (sarcastic huh). 
Second, game is slow paced but this is much more annoying than the other games of the series.
""Objective says get to point A, then get to point B, now go back to point A, go back to point B, now go to point C, go back to B, go to A, now go back to B"", you'll be going back and forth lot of times at least at the beginning and it's getting annoying. 
Also, the loading sequences are truly worthless, this game shouldn't even have loading screens. There are bigger games which uses even more ressources and all and do not have loading sequences or are even shorter than the ones in this game... Useless.

HM: Light of Hope foi uma experiência interessante mas muito desagradável em várias partes para qualquer um que já tenha jogado um jogo de Harvest Moon ou similares.
Vou separar os pontos positivos (+) e Negativos (-) do jogo.

+ Gráficos razoáveis para a franquia;
+ Os aldeões te dão missões que ajudam a aumentar o relacionamento e dão prêmios;
+ O jogo tem uma história... de verdade;
+ Quantidade razoável de animais;
+ Boa quantidade de receitas;
+ As plantas têm mutações;
+ Boa quantidade de opções para romance;
+ Os eventos de evolução romântica são bem bonitinhos;

- Uma das ferramentas mais básicas e importantes de um  jogo do gênero é a Previsão do Tempo. Sabe aquele programa que passa na TV que fala como o clima estará amanhã? Pois é, esse mesmo. Nesse jogo não tem previsão do tempo (nem TV), o que tem é um mago que só aparece algumas vezes no fim da noite e que faz divinação do clima do dia seguinte, mas como isso acontece anoite, não adianta de nada já que você não vai ter tempo de se ajustar a o que vai acontecer no dia seguinte;
- Pouca variedade de músicas;
- Poucos eventos, e a maioria deles são repetidos periodicamente ou são só de conversa;
- Algumas mutações são muito específicas e com certeza só seriam descobertas com um guia;
- O mato crescer de volta na fazenda... tudo bem. Árvores... tudo bem. MAS PEDRAS????
- A sua fazenda se enche de entulho mais rápido do que você conseguiria limpar, a menos que você queira perder metade do dia, todos os dias, só limpando entulho;
- DLCs... mano... sério? O jogo já é meio fraco, e ainda querem cobrar DLC por uns conteúdos questionáveis?
- Há uma personagem que te ajuda dando dicas do que os outros aldeões gostam para presente. O problema é que a informação que ela dá é sorteada e que normalmente ela repete escolhe 4 informações e as repete infinitamente até você desistir de perguntar.

Eu estou bem em conflito para decidir se devo dar uma nota positiva. Entretanto, devo considerar que eu quase abandonei o jogo no início por conta dos inúmeros pontos negativos que saltam aos olhos logo de início.
Por isso, a menos que for muito fã de grindar fazendas, NÃO RECOMENDO.",1646448588,1646448588,False,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I had plenty of fun playing it. In my opinion it's a lot more chill than SOTS:FOMT and I really like it for when I don't want to feel crushed under the demands to keep up, but I can't help but notice how unfinished it felt. It was all over the place, the pacing is rather bizarre, and I don't think I've ever played a HM game where I have 80k gold by the start of Year 1 Summer.

There's crop mutations and 4 different types of soil, but somehow it's missing a map where you can see where you planted what, and would need to go to the location to check individual plots for what kind of plant is there. There's a shipping bin, but it feels a bit weird to have it when you can sell to specific shop-owners for higher prices. There's no real way to know tomorrow's weather. The quality of the animal produce is *randomized*, which is just unbelievable. Animal growth rate also feels like forever despite purchasing from store, which in my opinion defeats the purpose; the idea of purchased animal vs birthed one is that of comparing upfront cost with the profit loss from the length of pregnancy as well as waiting for the newborn to grow into an adult. It doesn't matter, there's no point in getting the pregnancy medicine, it's literally more expensive than just buying a calf off Sofia. You get incredibly rich very easily off of mining, which has both a positive and negative: in one hand, you're not as pressured to plant plant plant and water until 2 AM. It's actually really nice if you're looking for a truly chill game. On the other, it does make the farming feel kind of pointless, if what you enjoy is the gradual and careful building of wealth.

Another aspect that I felt was really lacking was... the villagers. There's nothing really interesting about them; personality-wise, maybe there's a trope or two you like, but they hardly have deeper relationships with each other. I rarely feel the need to visit or talk to them to see how they're doing. NPCs are also usually stuck in one place at certain points in the plot, which means for weeks on end while you're trying to get a specific quality milk, they'll be in the same spot every day morning to evening, saying exactly 1 dialogue.

At the same time, I do think there's enough things going for it to be worth getting on sale, or even full price if you're in other countries where the full price is halved. Funnily it's the fact that some of the systems are wonky or lackluster that you end up able to set your own pace. If you're like me and get really stressed out about meeting goals or missing the shop opening windows, this game is an alternative where you can largely ignore all that. Just come in with a different mindset, I think.",1642297878,1642297878,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a fantastic feature that all games of this genre should implement.  Many times you are trying to make sure you get as much done as physically possible in a day.  If something should happen and you need to quit for some reason you often have one of two choices, either quit or try to rush back to bed to save.  This causes you to either lose progress by quitting out or to shorten your day and potentially cause you issues further down the road.  By having the save feature like this game does, it really assists and makes sure you don't lose any progress you were working on.  

Lets move on to the bad now.  Playing this game you need RNJesus to help with anything as almost everything is randomly decided.  There is no clear way to get the desired effect that you require in this game without a good amount of luck or save scumming to acquire it.  

Crops are an absolute mess in this game.  They try to make the crops growable in all seasons which would be a large plus for games of this genre.  However, they ruin this by making obtaining new crops by planting in off seasons for mutations and giving them health bars.  The idea to mutate crops to get new ones would be amazing but it's extremely poorly executed and the information provided to the player is very little at best.  I had to pull a guide to actually find the information and then from there create my own spreadsheet to ensure I done crop mutations in a timely manner.  This still lead to over 200 hours played to complete this.  Even worse is the fact that due to crop health they can die in their proper seasons if you are not taking full care of them or a weather event takes place at poor time for you.  A grown crop loses it's ability to receive water so they will die after a couple of days as there is no way to provide them with what they need to survive. This means you cannot grow grass and let your animals outside to eat it as will die within a couple of days at most.  Even worse is the fact that a majority of crops in this game are useless outside of providing you money.  One example of this is Wheat and one of it's mutations Rye Wheat.  You can use the Wheat to make flour for your bread in cooking, but the Rye Wheat has no use what so ever in the game.  It's not even worth farming them for money either as you can go to the mine and quickly make more money then you'll ever need in the game through that alone.  

Weather is painful to deal with.  There is no way (at least that I have found) to get information about the upcoming weather.  According to the game, you are supposed to be able to talk to Gareth (the Wizard Apprentice) after 6pm at his house and he will tell you the upcoming weather.  Either this does not work or is so heavily weighted in RNG that I have never seen him actually do it as all he provides is useless ""hints"" to what you can do around the farm, all of which you will already know to do before you can even unlock him as a villager.  Even more aggravating is how the weather works.  Sun and Rain work the same as any other game of this genre.  Thunderstorms & Blizzards are about the same as well with it taking the ""no villager interaction"" approach. Then you have Fog and Heatstorms.  These 4 weathers are problematic as they greatly harm your crops and if you aren't staying on top of fertilization, they'll die out.  3 of these I can understand why they would affect crop health, but Fog makes no sense.  Never has there been a point in time when a natural fog has rolled through the neighborhood and all the plant life has just died out.  It feels like they were just looking to add something to make it more difficult to keep crops alive.  

Animal friendship makes no sense in this game.  In other games of this genre, your animal drop quality is based on the friendship of your animal.  The higher this is, the better the quality.  In this game the friendship with your animal just gives you the ability to have the random chance to get better quality.  Complete friendship with your cow, well that entitles you to the potential Miracle Milk (5 star) from your cow but your probably going to only get a Ultimate Milk (3 star) as it's so heavily weighted to this.  This wouldn't be an issue until you quickly look at the cooking recipe list and notice that it's so heavily weighted to the use of milk that it feels impossible to complete.  A barn of 15 cows of one type and if your luck isn't perfect it would take legit real life weeks to even come close to half of what you need for the recipe list.  Ultimately there was so many milk requirements that I broke out Cheat Engine just to get the amount I needed to complete the recipes as I didn't want to put another month of real life time into this game for just collecting milk.  

The respawn on trees, rocks, and bushes are ridiculous as well.  I understand that they want you to be able to have enough rock and lumber to do anything with, but when was the last time you saw a tree fully grow in 3 days?  It makes it difficult to have a nice clean farm for any amount of time and will really start to grade on your nerves if you like to keep things tidy like I do.  

Overall, I want to love this game.  I grew up playing the Harvest Moon games and loved them.  However, this isn't one of those as that series is now it's proper ""Story of Seasons"" title as it was in Japan originally.  This game feels like a poorly rushed knock off of the Story of Seasons games pushed with the old Harvest Moon title to try and get people to play them.  However, outside the save function, nothing great really stands out about this game that makes it any better then others in the genre and but the issues with the game stand out far more then other games in the genre.  I sit on the fence for almost a month debating if this was a recommend game or not and finishing it this morning, I can say that I cannot recommend it due to outstanding issues.",1641390832,1641390832,False,4,0,0.564203739166259766,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The overly simple controls actually make certain actions harder, especially for M+KB. Mouse controls in particular are very poor with everything being keyed into the click, it can make doing the action you want difficult. For example, click on a sheep to shear it and end up petting a cow 3 tiles away despite the action icon being on the sheep. Trying to use the charged hoe, you'll need the keyboard for that and if you misclick, you won't be able to use the hoe because you need an available tillable tile to use the charged hoe.

Other issues with mouse controls is trying to quick select an item to use as you may end up moving onto the space instead of using the item.

Note also that most crops can be passed through so there is no need to do any special crop arrangements unlike some farming sims.

The story is kind of questionable in quality as well. Really, the story is just a long tutorial.

Also, make sure you sell your dishes in order. If you sell out of order, the restaurant may sometimes fail to stock the dish. (Normal -> Great -> Ultimate -> Supreme).

Also, for achievements, you'll need to save and sleep then close the game to trigger some achievements. Why? Don't know, but that is how some of the achievements work.

Also be aware that you have a very tight inventory limit until you unlock your storages, but do note that when cooking in your own house, you don't use the storage that is like two tiles away. The ingredients must be in your inventory. Also, you need to have the non-great ingredients for many recipes/turn ins as the great version cannot be used instead. (On the other hand, some recipes/turn ins do allow the great versions). Not that you'll want to use the great versions in most cases, but it is something to note.

While you can grow trees, do note that trees not only block movement, but can also hide obstacles, such as weeds and it can be hard to see these obstacles. This isn't a huge deal with keyboard controls, but mouse controls can be frustrating here, especially since your move and till buttons are the same.

Also, for anyone wondering, there does not appear to be the option for same gender marriage.",1633998503,1634025082,False,0,0,0.457848817110061646,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Yes, the game looks terrible and some characters have ""Mii faces"", but the fact you can finish the storyline in a only a few months of in game time (I beat it in the first summer) is a good thing.

When playing other Harvest Moon games I have all the upgrades before the first year is over and I have nothing to do, get bored and quit the game.

But in this game you can ""beat"" the game quickly, so I did it.

Making everything use one button makes the game much easier and charging up to fertilize or pick up a bunch of crops at the same time makes the game much easier and I can grow much more crops than in other Harvest Moon games.

Main story short.
Slow walking animation.
Not impressed with the bachelors this time round. Most are rather dull or too dopey. (Taking my chances with the Underworld King. LOL At least he's got some adorable qualities.) 

Regardless I still experienced enjoyment from it. There's some good humour. Character and animal designs are cute.

This game has its own kind of setting with its Japanese Anime way of people talking to each other, with their emotes and reactions. But I like that. There is some simply but nice story, with some mysteries, the characters are not very deep but adorable enough.
It's not as good as Stardew Valley but probably about the same level as the other two games I would say. At least it's good have me kept hooked for 5 hours so far and probably many more.

I just love such kind of games. You build up your farm, grow some crops, have your live stock, mine some ores, improve your tools, the seasons change and so your crop, you help other characters, help the whole town there, socialize with them, resolve some mysteries, etc.
And I love how these games are so relaxing and still so much fun.

Edit after 20 hours of playing:
This game is still fun and entertaining, but there is one thing that annoys me more and more. This game is not programmed very well in terms of performance. It has very simple graphics that could be from the last century, which is fine for me, but still it is very power consuming. This way it is wasting way more energy than necessary and your notebook gets heaten up for no good reason.
And even more annoying are the loading times when travelling between map parts. This takes about 5 to 10 seconds each, which makes no sense at all. It takes even longer when an event appears.

Only 1 gender for the animals, lazy
map is super tiny, SUPER TINY!!!
you can only buy 1 animal at a time, slow as hell and teleports you back to the barn every time so you need to walk back.
8 hours in and i still cant cut a large trees or smash big rocks
No leveling system, harvest moon games never have them. But ive come to enjoy them in every rune factory
Pay to unlock mobile bullshit feel. You need to build and unlock everything on the map and each time you need a new thing that gets harder and harder to find or grow or catch
They forgot to fill in some of the map background in, just blackness
20$ for this game with almost no depth and they try and charge you more for dlc

In fact, any entry bearing the Harvest Moon name since Natsume's split with Marvellous back in 2014 can be skipped. 

The Harvest Moon games made since the split are half-assed, hollow attempts at cashing in on the fact that they got to keep the name they gave the series for the English localisation. The 3D graphics make the game feel bland and uninteresting compared to previous 3D entries to the series. The characters don't feel as interesting, and the gameplay doesn't give me much to make me want to return to it every time I shut it off. 

I didn't even get to the point of getting married in the game because after someone accepts your proposal you have to jump through more hoops in the form of quests with frustratingly specific requirements. After several in-game days waiting for one of my animals to produce a specific quality of wool I realised that I was no longer enjoying myself and hadn't been for some time. I shut the game off and felt no desire to return to it.

If you're looking for a good Harvest Moon game either get your hands on an entry from before the split, or pick yourself up one of the entries in the *real* Harvest Moon series, renamed Story of Seasons by Marvellous. They keep the heart of the series that made fans love it to begin with, while adding new and interesting features that keep players coming back.

Negatives:

1. The storyline is fairly short, can be completed within a day or two. Should probably extend the storyline and make it last throughout at least a year game time. That way it'll take a few days and one could explore more of the world around them and play for more than just the story.

2. There are next to no player choices to make. You get to decide wether you play as a boy or a girl, your birthday, and your name. Oh and your significant other, of which are not many due to the fact that it isn't possible for same sex marriage. We don't get to design our characters or truly choose who we wish to end up with. I understand that programming is a bit of an issue, but one could take the money gained from this and improve the game to make it much more player centered and better overall.

3. The controls, even with a controller, are wonky. It is rather hard to tell just where you are and what all does what when moving your character. As others have said, it's very reminiscent of a moble game.

4. The graphics are fine, but the mash-up between the 3D and 2D pixel art styles does not work. It would be better if the 2D models were a little bigger to make your character and the npcs fit into the world better.

5. It is rather hard to figure out what to do and how to get things even with Edmond. I had to look up how to get a fishing pool because I didn't know how to and the same with a hammer for the mines. I also had to look up how to go about the levels of the mines (go deeper) and how to fish properly. Nothing was explained, except for at the very beginning.

I like the idea of such a mash-up world, but if I had to choose between this and Stardew Valley, I would choose the latter. It's a lot smoother in its gameplay, the player has more control over the smaller things, how to do things is actually explained... I could go on. Personally, it's a waste of money and I bought the bundle pack. If I could remove bought games from my library, this would be one of them. Again, it has potential, but it's definitely not something I will be returning to any time soon for any reason. It's rather boring and I'm just sitting around half the time waiting for people to be available. I would like a refund and I think a demo should be released for this so people can find out if they actually like it before wasting their money on it.",1617344747,1617344747,False,2,1,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I beat the game (another official first for me and Harvest Moon) and now I'm trying to decide who my character should marry.

I had taken a break from the game after beating the main story. But when I came back I was SO EXCITED to discover that new events, characters, and missions had been added to the game. That's not something that happens in disk games.

It's very cute without being cutesy most of the time and has an engaging story line. 
The game is very reminiscent of Stardew Valley but with enough differences to be worth owning both.
I absolutely LOVE the farming mechanism, which allows for crops to MUTATE depending on chance, terrain type, and time of year as well as mutation boosting agents. It's a very, very clever addition to a farming simulator and one I've never seen before. I also really love how the seasonal planting works, because unlike many other games, if you plant crops in the wrong season, they DO NOT die immediately. Actually, with enough care, fertilizer, and luck, you can grow any crop in any season. And as annoying as I find it sometimes, crops randomly DO wither and die on you, especially if you aren't taking good care of them, which is aggravating when it happens but also a really nice touch. (My family grows food and our plants do not all suddenly wither at once with the change of season).
The characters are many and varied, with some of them amusingly eccentric and some of the annoyingly so. (I do NOT like most of the Harvest Sprites for this reason). However, outside of the main story, almost none of the characters HAVE to be interacted with, so if you find one more annoying than the rest, you can usually avoid them.
While the resource gathering in the game is very rich and very well thought-out, USING those resources is a lot less intricate. I'm torn on how I feel about this. On one hand, it's annoying that I gather all these resources (wool, various ores, etc) and then don't have much use for most of them, except cooking and repairing buildings. On the other hand, it's actually kind of neat that my character can't do EVERYTHING. He can farm, fish, and chop down trees and break rocks, but he can't also weave his own clothes and set precious stones in jewelry and have an entire wine-making or cheese-making operation going, and while I do sometimes wonder what to do with these resources, it's a lot more of a community-minded game than many others. A lot of other games I've played, your character could do pretty much everything ALL the other characters could do which often led to them being the only ones to do ANYTHING. And this game is very different in that the character actually needs the others to achieve anything. It's a neat mechanic to the game, and one I haven't seen before, as other similar games I've played did have a community of people who had certain skills but then would also teach them to me and give me the ability to do it myself, and there was very little working together. I like how they managed to make a single-player game cooperative without losing features for the player. I'd like it a bit MORE however if my bag could hold more items. While storage is available eventually, I find my bag aggravatingly limiting in quantity when so many item types exist due to 5 quality tiers. 
I also love how any recipes (food or otherwise) you follow tend to require several items but rarely aggravatingly difficult to obtain ones or ones that require several extra processing steps. For example, if I want to make a salad, I may also have to make, say, mayo first, but I don't have to first press vegetables into oil, then make mayo, then find mustard seeds to stone grind my own mustard first. It straddles the line well (usually) between so easy it's pointless and so overly complicated nothing gets made, especially since in many of those games, all of those steps require lots of time waiting for it to be done. While this is NOT realistic, unlike many parts of the game, producing new things does not require time. 
The recipes are also really really well done because for almost all of them, you can sub items. So if it calls for, say, tomato, you can choose different breeds (which you got through mutation, usually) OR sometimes jsut flat out different things. Like it'll call for sardines but you have cod, so you can use cod. Which is just AWESOME because isn't that how we cook in life?
Another excellent feature is how your energy levels the next day change based on how late you went to bed and whether you went to bed or passed out. Instead of losing half the day, you get way more tired way more easily, which... I mean, realistic.

Overall, I'd say this is an absolutely excellent game with some unique gameplay mechanisms that really add value. I definitely recommend it!",1603631073,1603631073,True,6,1,0.588631153106689453,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Getting your hands on various new crops feels laborious since you can only unlock certain ones by completing requests. Trying to make the more rare crops also sucks and doesn't guarantee you will successfully grow to harvest them, even when you throw tons of money into special fert and apply it every day. Also, yes I did apply the seeds on the lands they are suppose to grow in. 

The farming doesn't really feel fun or efficient. It's strange that they gave the player so much in the means to push farming as your main thing, but it's redundant. The game focuses on the player farming in so many different land types and yet it is not necessary. Practically all common or uncommon seeds can be planted next to your house regardless of the lands the seeds require. The only times I had used the other places like swamp and dry areas is when I attempted to make the rarer/harder to proc plants.

There aren't many villager/townsfolk interactions. The whole co-op thing with the crystal/gem fairy doesn't work.

Where to start? I had so many issues with this game. It feels a bit surreal that they released this in 2017 and it's so lackluster. Natsume is a million-dollar company, so there's really no excuse for such a [i]basic[/i] game. Indie developers have made significantly more interesting and fun games with less resources. Stardew Valley is the obvious example, but I even liked World's Dawn, a RPG Maker game, vastly more than this. Sadly, I put way too much time into this game. I kept hoping it would get better, but not even DLC could salvage my enjoyment. In fact, the DLC made it worse.

Long list of issues:
[list]
[*] There is no mystery or depth in the story. Everything is spoon-fed to the player.
[*] The characters are extremely boring and one-dimensional. All character cutscenes are so dull and uninteresting. 
[*] The island is way too small. There's not a lot of exploring to do, even after unlocking everything.
[*] The controls are finicky and make the already tedious tasks in the game more frustrating. 
[*] The player can ride a horse to get around faster, [i]but[/i] it takes a long time to even obtain the horse. I obtained my horse [i]after[/i] I finished Chapter 5 (the initial ending of the game), in which the player obtains teleportation from the map view. That defeats the whole point of even obtaining a horse if the player can't get it earlier in the game.
[*] There's no obvious way to advance in the mines. I had to search online how to advance, because the game tells the player exactly nothing about how to find the ladders to lower levels. 
[*] Fishing is easy, but uninteresting and not very fun. 
[*] There are too many levels of item quality. Two or three would've been fine, not five: Regular, Great, Ultimate, Supreme, & Miracle/Legendary. Every time the player gets a new recipe, it has to be made five different times thanks to the quality variations. That's such a needless and uninteresting way to bring variety to the game. 
[*] The protagonist can only be a light-skinned man or woman, giving a big ""f--- you"" to darker-skinned and enby players. 
[*] Furthermore, there are only heterosexual relationships/marriages.
[*] Speaking of marriage, the wedding day is abysmal. It lasts about five seconds and takes up the entire in-game day, forcing the player to neglect all their crops and farm animals as well. 
[*] Thankfully, I only obtained two of the DLC, during the summer sale while they were cheap, because guess what -- they don't work properly. It seems like the DLC only works if the player has it from the very beginning of the game and follows every little step needed [i]precisely[/i] to trigger cutscenes that are required to happen before the player can even utilize the DLC features. I researched online to find several different issues with the DLC packs, so my issues weren't even all of them. I contacted Natsume via their official email and got a ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" stock answer. It's almost like these DLC packs should've just been part of the base game and then maybe there wouldn't be so many issues with it working. 
[/list]

Short list of good things to say about it:
[list]
[*] The animals are cute. The player can adopt a dog and a cat.
[*] The female protagonist makes cute facial expressions to make up for her lack of dialogue. 
[*] While the characters' personalities are dull, there are a few who, at least, look nice/pretty/cute: Edmond, Soleil, Jeanne, & Shirlock. 
[*] The seasons of Spring and Autumn are pretty. 
[*] The player can save at any time rather than daily like in other games of this genre.

Not the best of the harvest moons, but that's just my opinion. Don't let me sway you away from the game by me saying I don't like it.

This is the first harvest moon I know that requires flowers for tool upgrades, or that I can recollect currently. It didn't take me until the 1st year of fall to realize I can plant crops out of season with Fertilizer, something the game didn't tell me.

This game is very intricate and versatile compared to the rest, you have many blends of fertilizers you can create that help with cross-plant creation basically, gaining a new harvestable item, along with food blends and creating your own quality of food. 

Crops are not the money maker in this not unless you want to go wild. I found myself holding onto crops just for quest exchange or to make food to keep me stamina up, and in the mines - using the food, and making my money that way. I quickly went from 0 to 500k  with no problem. Fishing is also the same way unless you catch the big boisss. Though its more beneficial to use your crops and fish to create food or hold onto for quests, same thing with items from animals, for some of those items will be used to craft things through npcs in the game before and after ending.

Game has cute scenes and good humor. You can beat the mainstory in the first year, even by summer. This game is definitely intended to keep going after the main storyline, the dlc started to take off for me right after along with the additive content for reaching end-game, such as marriage, kids, barn upgrades, chicken coop upgrades, clothing, etc. 

The only true irritating fact about this game is if you are trying to level your FP (friend points) with someone and everyone usually has a cut scene at a certain FP (musical note, 1, 2, 3, 4 blah blah) if you do not witness the cutscene, please don't waste your gifts on them for it does not increase the FP, and soft-locks it until you see that cutscene.

PONTOS POSITIVOS.
- Tratamento inteligente de seleção de ferramenta (Meio Confuso no começo, mas você vai pegar rápido).
- A plantação não bloqueia seu caminho, sendo assim você consegue fazer uma plantação 3x3 sossegadamente.
- Você consegue plantar no inverno sem necessidade de uma estufa (Não tem estufa no jogo).
- Sistema de estamina bem intuitivo.
- Quando você vai coletar qualquer material (minérios, madeira, legumes, verduras, flores, cogumelo, etc) caso você já tenha 99 do item, ele será armazenado automaticamente no armário ou na geladeira.

PONTOS NEGATIVOS.
- Menus não muito Intuitivos.
- Variações de itens desnecessários (o que dificulta fazer algumas missões do jogo e confunde ainda mais o menu) EX.: Ovo (Egg, Great Egg, Ultimate Egg, Supreme Egg, Miracle Egg) cada receita feita com um ovo vai ter uma variante ou seja 5 tipos de ovo frito, 5 tipos de ovo cozido, etc.
- Os personagens não são muito carismáticos.
- A economia do jogo é bem quebrada, a plantação e os animais da muito pouco retorno pelo esforço, compensa MUITO MAIS ir minerar ou pescar (acabei guardando a maior parte na geladeira/armário por que não compensava vender, mas, sim usar para dar de presente para os NPCs ou fazer missões).
- A história é bem mais ou menos (mas a maioria dos harvest moon não tem um aprofundamento muito grande na história então já era meio esperado ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
- Não é muito amigável com novatos (se você não tem experiência em outro títulos vai passar um perrengue).
- Adubo, você vai precisar MUITO disso se não sua plantação vai ficar morrendo do nada (o que reforça meu ponto, plantar só serve para presentar e seguir a história).
- Os eventos do jogo são bem mais ou menos.
- O pacote de semente só planta um quadrado( nos jogos anteriores um pacote plantava 9 )
- Você só consegue carregar 99 de cada item (isso atrapalha na hora de plantar e colocar adubo).
- Os personagens brotam e aparecem do nada (eles não saem andando pela cidade eles de repente surgem no lugar)

CONCLUSÃO
- O jogo poderia ter um tratamento melhor, da a impressão de ter sido mal polido ou feito as pressas, ainda é harvest moon sendo assim a ideia central do jogo é a mesma (apesar de não compensar plantar), vai chegar certo ponto que o jogo vai ficar tão repetitivo que você provavelmente vai enjoar de jogar (eu enjoei com umas 40 horas de jogo)",1593128559,1596326522,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

By end-game, it gets to the point where to create a type of bait needed to catch a rare fish, you first must catch some *other* rare fish and combine it with some rare crop, combine the two to make a very specialized bait which then gives you a chance to catch the super-rare fish... it's exhausting, highly luck- and grind-based and ultimately just not very much fun except for people who take achievement completionism to the level of an extreme sport.

Just played the new SOS Friends of Mineral Town, and I have to say HM Light of Hope actually has better game play mechanics. I think SOS has cuter graphics, but the novelty of that fades quickly.  HM Light of Hope is a GREAT BUY at half the price of SOS.

HM Light of Hope has better farming controls.  And it has a crop mutation element.  That is actually my favorite.  Crops can mutate into a new crop under the right conditions.  The variety of soil type also makes farming much more interesting.  I put in hours of gameplay trying to unlock new seeds for crops and flowers.  In comparison, ""Friends of Mineral Town"" gets really boring really fast.

That's just one area where I think the new HM is better.  Storyline, and fishing is also better here in HM Light of Hope, imho. The more I play Mineral Town, the more I want to replay HM LOH. :D

Original Review

The story moves faster than the previous HM games.  They improved the process for farming and raising animals, so it's not so tedious.  Mining is much easier, and so is making gold.  I finished the main story line within the first year.  Wish the story was longer.  I really enjoyed the game play and can see myself playing the game again.",1589493734,1626118433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

honestly i gave it a go because they arnt many harvest moon types of games on pc (and those that are i either played or arnt good either)

too make a long story short, the story is shallow, most characters are dull or impossible too find. and only AFTER finishing story, you unlock half the game.

so too put down a list of problems.

1, selling stuff
    it seems that selling too npcs makes more profit than sellin too the bin. which makes the bin completely useless.
    in addition, you have too either buy or sell x amount in order too unlock more seeds and tree's too plant.
    not a problem but pointless.

2, mining = profit.
    so less than halfway year 1 i unlocked mining and o boy does that make a profit. in reality it makes so much more profit
    than farming does. in such a short timespan. that it feels like farming becomes the sidegig.

3, upgrades locked behind story.
    after a certain time in the game (fixing blacksmiths house) you end up being able too upgrade your tools.
    which is great and all. but i quickly noticed that everything you need is either deep in the mines. or is out of season.
    certain flowers required for upgrades can only be obtained during 1 season and thus hard too obtain. while others
    are locked behind resources that only unlock AFTER beating story.

4, story is simplistic and dull.
    the main aspect of the game is for you too ""find"" 5 medalions. sadly story wise each and every single 1 takes no effort
    too obtain. if anything the game would have been better off not having this story. the main characters ""reason"" too stay
    on the island is rather bad as well. you wash ashore and as usual fashion gets brought into a house too rest. character
    character wakes up and with little to no dialog accepts too live on said island. without even beeing outside yet!

5, building instantly.
    so in the older harvest moon games it would take a while for a house or tool to be build. unfortunately over the years 
    they removed said system. now everything gets build instantly. its a shame really. but the thing that anoys me the most 
    about it. is that whenever you repair an house of someone. they magically appear the next day. as if getting an invite too 
    come back home. it's so obnoxiously bad that its sad. fix house. npc moves in the next day. without ever hearing about 
    them earlier.

6, npc static during story.
    so long story short. when you're are at ANY of the story parts. the npc you interacted with will stay there until you move 
    onto the next story part. this can takes days or weeks ingame. completely removing them from the normal cycle.
    this can easily lead too events and interactions breaking. as the npcs arnt joining.

7, inconsistent events.
    so since for whatever reason the dev desided too remove the calender. you will never really know when an event is going 
    too happen. this sadly also means. you don't know if you missed any. or for whatever reason. sometimes events dont 
    happen at all. apparently there are multiple events a month. but because of point 6 and other things. events just dont 
    trigger.

8, tiered minigames.
    of the events that do spawn there are certain tiers you unlock. easy normal hard. you start on easy and if you get 1st 
    place you can then do normal the next time the event shows up. sadly tho, the events seem to be even random there.
    for the fishing one you require a certain amount of points which seems to be completely random whenever you obtain
    the right amount or not.

9, hearts(affection) doesn't mean anything.
    for whatever reason. it's real real real easy too obtain affection with people and animals. even more so if you shower
    them with gifts. which isnt even needed because of how easy it is too obtain. yet it doesnt seem to do anything.
    untill you beat story you can't even marry people. within 1 month i maxed out affection with all animals i got.
    yet they still produce questionable quality of resources. not too mention that more animals unlock AFTER story.
    while your barn is already full.

10 house upgrades.
    speaking of upgrades. the farm upgrades are unlocked again. after story. they arnt really cheap either. so you end up
    having (forgive the pun) farm for money wood and stone. which would not be an issue if the game was enjoyable.

11 co-op
     as i'm finishing up the review of the game i suddenly remembered co-op. like... why did you make it so bad?
     yes folks, unlike what the website says. this game has co-op. shitty shitty co-op. you unlock that after about
     a week or 2 ingame and then can select too have a 2nd person join. unfortunately it's NEVER explained. so the 
     1st time i activated this mechanic i ended up losing control over my MC. because for whatever reason the game
     desided too move my controls too player 2. player 2 is only active while you are on your farm. seemingly as a sidekick
     again sadly tho. its interactions are limited and honestly no npc even ecnolages its existance.

if anything. this is one of my lowest ranking harvest moon games too date. and i think i played almost all of them.
sadly the game doesnt even have much on the points of good things. as all but 1 character is bland af. which sadly has always been a problem with the later HM games.

long story short.
i wish they released a better harvest moon game instead of this one. hells even releasing the older ones would have been far more interesting.

Likes: The characters are cute and their expressions are funny and unique. (They kinda remind me of Mii Characters.) The animals are adorable as always. The story in the game is good.

Dislikes: The controls are a little iffy at times. When collecting flowers in the wild, you won't know what flower it is until you pick it up. The story is good but it's too short in my opinion.

I've always loved Harvest Moon and Rune Factory games. I've waited a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG time for Harvest Moon and/or Rune Factory to come to PC, Stardew Valley and many games since have shown there is a market, and this is what we get? This game? If it wasn't published by Natsume and carried the Harvest Moon name, I would have thought it was some copycat asset flip game. 

The graphics are awful, there is no charm. The controls are awful, no PC optimization, you don't even have a item bar to easy swap between things. Even when zoomed out to the max everything still looked like I was playing an older game on a CRT monitor. This may be to hide how small the world appears to be, however, there are clearly more areas to unlock, but without any kinds of map I don't know if it would make a difference. I didn't play long enough to comment on the story but it seemed pretty standard from what I saw. 

I thought this might have been a poor mobile port, nope, the game was released on PC in 2017, then later to PS4, Switch, and mobile in 2018. That's right, a game released first on PC isn't even optimized for PC, has XBOX control prompts (which you can see from the screenshot) but I can't find any release info for XBOX, what?

There are better mobile games then this, heck Stardew Valley is now on mobile. I couldn't even say this game could stand on it's own merits let alone when compared to it's competitors. The most disappointing thing is that I really wanted to like this and give it a shot. I saw all the positive reviews and thought, maybe look pass the graphics and there is some enjoyment to be had.

There are a number of apparent issues:

1. The graphics suck.
2. The story line is pretty bad.
3. The game does not feel like the older Harvest Moon games.

Also, one issue that you cannot tell from the screenshots is that this is a really crappy port from the Switch.  They show the XYAB buttons in the UI.  Due to the crappy port from the console, the controls are clunky for a keyboard user.

I really wish Natsume would put some time and effort in a nice PC version of a good Harvest Moon game.  Really disappointed.  Honestly, Stardew Valley is a much better game and closer to the old Harvest Moon games than this one.

I also know people seem to ""hate"" this game mostly because of this, claiming this isn't a true Harvest Moon.


My biggest surprise here, however, is that I DON'T hate it. And while I DO understand people's point, this game actually DOES feel like a true Harvest Moon to me. 


That said, this isn't one of the best games to carry the Harvest Moon name. Everything is... average in here, nothing more than that. Graphics are average, soundtrack is average, story is meh...


But I'm having fun with it. A LOT more fun than I was anticipating, in fact. The gameplay is solid. The game reminds me of Island of Happiness (Nintendo DS), since you play in an abandoned island and the more you fix stuff more NPCs come to live in the island. And I LOVED that aspect, since it really feels like we are accomplishing a lot more than your typical Harvest Moon.


The controls aren't bad either. You can even use the mouse for everything, including moving around (but you can also move with WASD... and that's what I recommend). Some things are more intelligent than in most games in the series, for example: if you click in a crop, you'll water it, without having to select the watering can first. If the crop is already watered, you'll use a fertilizer if you click in it again. Click a rock, you'll use the hammer automatically. This makes things a lot more simple, and in a game where you'll do repetitive activities all the time, that's a good thing.


Now, everything that you'd expect from a Harvest Moon are here: farming, gifting, fishig, mining, getting married, heart events, etc. Everything done in a very average way, but nothing badly executed either. And man! This game is packed with content. Not as much as Stardew Valley, but as a Harvest Moon game, this one has quite a lot of stuff to do, even if not as much as Animal Parade or Friends of Mineral Town.


But as I said before, everything this game does, it does in the most average way possible. And that's where you should decide if this game is for you: do you want an average Harvest Moon? If, like me, you've played all the games in the series and also played Stardew Valley until your eyes bled, then maybe you want a new game? If yes, then get this game. This game won't ""replace"" any game in the series. It won't replace Stardew valley. But if you want a new Harvest Moon, this game isn't bad.

I recommend it if you already did everything you wanted in Stardew Valley, for example, and still needs a new farming/dating sim.",1588104363,1588166128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Mining System: 3/10. Honestly, being able to use the upgraded Hoe helps, and the fact that mining is the best way to obtain gold in the game also incentives a little, but honestly, this mining system is probably worse than Friends of Mineral Town. It is grindy and boring. Fortunately, you can get the minerals you need fast enough and then you basically just stop mining, unlike FoMT where you actually had to mine a lot in order to obtain stamina fruits and cursed tools. Nonetheless, this is one of the worst current-era mining systems around. 

Planting: 5/10. The mutation system is quite interesting, however, it is quite expensive (which is not that much of a problem) and, especially, it is time consuming. For some reason, the devs decided to now allow us to hire help from the Harvest Sprites, so, no matter how advanced in the game you are, you will still be watering and harvesting by yourself. In fact, the only way to improve your production is upgrading the tools, and then it is done. You have to plant about 500+ of some particular crops in order to obtain enough mutations to unlock the seeds for them, and doing it without any irrigation system (again, sprites or anything) is consuming. 

Animals: 2/10. The system is completely unclear on how the quality of the animal products work. I assume that, as in any other game, the higher the friendship/love/w/e with the animal, the higher the quality. However, it also looks like giving better food (Delicious Feed in particular) increases the chance of higher quality, but, again, this is something not specified and even guides aren't clear about it. Similarly, it feels there is little reason to let your animals go out (besides some bugs with it, like some not going out at all - even though they are not sick/pregnant/anything) and if the Delicious Feed theory is right, letting them go out is actually bad as it decreases the quality of the products. If that is the case, the system sucks.

Also, while Milk is highly demanded for cooking, Wool and Fur are pretty much worthless. Money? Get from the mine. Requests? Meh, not worth it and also you can get enough for all requests in like 2 seasons. After rebuilding everything and marrying, it feels like the sheeps and donkeys are useless. 

Relationships: 0/10. Honestly? There is absolutely no reason to improve friendship with anyone that you are not going to marry over 2 notes. In previous games, higher friendship would allow you to visit them in odd schedule times (by the way, scheduling in this game is oversimplified as hell: most villagers have basically two different schedules, independent of season, weather or anything - and they simply teleport from one place to another), offer new items even at the highest levels of friendship or any other kind of reward. In LoH, you don't unlock anything. Bastian and Sofia will need you to get 2 notes in order to fully unlock their stores but that's it. I think Carol also needs 2 notes for some flowers. But there is no other reason for it. 

Even the cutscenes with Michelle - which i married - are boring and poorly made. From what I have seen in cutscenes with other characters, they are not better either.

Wifes: 10/10 - Kurisu is on the game, I don't care about anything else. This line is half-ironic, by the way. Jokes aside, 2017 and HM games still lack any kind of homosexual relationship. Yes, I understand the child is a major part of the storyline, but there are many ways to include that (adoption hi?) and make the game a little bit inclusive. But w/e, for *me* this is minor, but for some people it might be sad and bad.

Cooking: 2/10. Cooking is grindy as hell as well. The bottleneck is, by far, Milk, which basically requires you to have a farm full of cows. There are almost no recipes with eggs (which is funny), and the recipes are very repetitive. Basically, (insert quality) Butter + Fish or (Insert quality) Cheese + Bunch of stuff. Gezz, you need a total of 22 cheeses of EACH quality in order to complete the list. That's 66 Miraculous Milks only for the cheese. 

The specific quality system is also a huge annoyance. Honestly, all the cooking system seems messed up and lazily done. Requiring so many top-quality material and not even allowing a higher-quality to be used in most recipes is simply bad. 

Events: 2/10. No more horse race. No more... so many stuff are missing. I will skip this into the final one because they are related.

Soundtrack: 6/10. It's calming, but repetitive and the mine one is straight forward annoying. Also, bugs in the summer... bug me.

Art: 1/10. Gezz what an ugly art. Really. Honestly it feels like a huge downgrade compared to a GAMEBOY GAME FROM 2003. This is how ugly the art is for me. 

Final review: 4/10. The game seems like a down-graded version of games that were released more than 15 years ago. Seriously, there is considerably less content than Friends of Mineral Town (aside the crop mutations), and gameplay has not improved at all. Mining is even more boring, relationships are more meaningless and storylines are more lazy. So far, I haven't seen any couples in the island besides myself, by the way, which is also something that downgrades the storytelling - if you don't marry them, everyone else in the island remains single forever, because you are the only person worthy? Miss love rivals. 

So, going back to what I have written in the beginning: This is not worth it, unless you already got full achievements in Stardew Valley, or even My Time at Portia, or anything else that had a little more of effort put from the devs, and you really love this kind of game and really want to play it. Especially considering it's quite expensive.",1587448000,1587449895,False,13,0,0.667607784271240234,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'd value it at $8 maybe. The things I mean by frustrations:
- I had to look up how to use Soleil, and guess what, if you're playing the PC version of the game, you can't! You have to play multiplayer with a console and 2 controllers for that. Stupid.
- The controls are not that well explained inside the game. It took me forever to figure out how to actually use upgraded tools. All they tell you is ""hold the Action button"", but that's not what you actually have to do. What you actually have to do, that the game doesn't tell you, is hold the action button and drag it across the squares you want to use it on. It was a pain in the ass to learn that bc like I said, the in-game exposition wasn't adequate.
- How to fish was also not very well explained. But luckily, it was easy for me bc I was used to the Stardew Valley method of fishing. But still, to save you some hassle and disappointment when you first try to fish (without any guidance from the NPC who gives you the rod): you click on the square of water, click again after choosing your bait, and the hard part to learn is wait for the tiny bumps to turn into a big splash, THEN click. At first I just kept clicking as soon as the fish bites and you see ripples, because that's what I remember doing in numerous other games, don't remember if that's how it works in previous Harvest Moon games or not, but it is just not explained at all when you get your rod. 
- The NPCs are kind of meh, with only a few of them having real interesting personalities. They mostly just hang out by the fountain and say the same lines over and over again. I guess that's typical of farm sims, but this one has especially bland NPCs. Tree of Tranquility was the last Harvest Moon game I played and the NPCs in that one were written better. They were much more interesting in A Wonderful Life for the Gamecube too.
- You can make so much from mining, and so little from fishing and farming, that you wonder why it's a farming game at all. All you have to do is fix the restaurant, buy a bunch of bread, mine every day, eating bread when your health is low, and bam. Why even bother growing crops or having animals? Other than that the plot of the game demands it, and most villager requests are for crops, animal products, or flowers.
- NPCs make requests that are sometimes for off-season items, I wish they had programmed it so that they knew what season it was when making a request? Idk if that's possible. There are endless requests, they often feel repetitive and boring, and I don't think the game rewards the player that well for doing most of them. 
- The fortune telling characters being only available after 5 on certain days. I'm used to things being closed and off-limits by 5-6 or so, so that took me forever to figure out. I couldn't understand why I was never able to visit them.
- Speaking of NPC availability, you don't have any device you can even buy right away at least that tells you the hours of any business, and they are not posted on signs AT the business (which they are in other Harvest Moon games). You have to look up the hours/days for businesses to be open in your bookshelf, that's the only place you can see it. And there's no ""business hours"" sheet, you have to find the sheet specific to that business or NPC. Frustrating. 
- No calendar, like, anywhere? No TV, at least, not that's available in the first 2 seasons where I'm at. In other games, you started with a basic TV and a calendar in your house. 
- The map tells you where characters are if they're out of their homes, and sometimes? tells you if they're in their homes? It's very unclear. Many times you get no indication of if a character is inside their home and their home is open for visitors. 
- I got stuck in limbo where I'm at right now waiting for fall, because to advance the game I need a strawberry, milk, and flour. I could make the flour in summer, but spring had passed, so too late to get a strawberry, until fall. And I have to wait for my cow to grow up for the milk. And I upgraded my tools early in summer (needing flowers to upgrade tools in addition to cash and ore is weird and frustrating too), using sunflowers. Now I have to wait for fall for the cosmos and white roses needed (for SOME reason) to further upgrade my tools. Even though I have tons of money and other material (materials that actually make sense that you would make a tool from). So it's like Summer 15 and I basically have to twiddle my thumbs for 15 more days. Or just do my farm chores and go back to sleep. 
- The tool order thing. I basically cannot destroy unwanted crop plants that keep producing all season. When you start on a square, it first assumes you want the hoe, then if you click a hoed square, it rifles through available seeds to plant, then it assumes you want to water, if watered it assumes you want fertilizer. No ability to just take an axe or sickle or whatever to plants you no longer want. I guess you just have to let them dry up and die. It also means that, say you water a square in the middle of a 3-square row and you want to water the plant before it and after it, you can't. Because the game will not let you water a square that's already been watered. And the controls are sometimes heckin shifty so you definitely will screw up and water in such a way. 
- You can't give food to wild animals? I don't know how I'm supposed to befriend the mountain cat if the game won't let me give it stuff? Or maybe it has to be given certain specific foods? Not like the game will tell me. If you want to figure this game out you probably need to search online, the exposition in-game is the bare minimum, if even that. They did say you need to upgrade your house to have a pet, which I think is kind of bogus anyway, but maybe that means you can't feed a wild animal to befriend it until you do that. 

I will say though, that despite these issues sometimes causing frustration, I do mostly enjoy the game. I just don't think it's up to the Harvest Moon name. The dev breakup here leaves an obvious mark on the quality of it. I was hoping it would be good despite that drama, but it's really mediocre. I'm only playing it because I got so good at Stardew Valley (and married my favorite NPCs in different save files) that I got bored with it, and because of the quarantine. I have heck-all else to do. Not like I'm actually going to finish crocheting that scarf, or work on my novel. Ha. It's funny but I'm pretty much going insane under the pressure here, and that I actually seem to enjoy playing this game seems proof that I've finally hecking lost it.

After a few more days: Well, I can't say it's not growing on me. I like Cyril and Jeanne. However, this is balanced by the fact that I have come to hate Tabitha and the purple haired lady. Tabitha is just an annoying brat. The other is pretty but boring and always in the way between me and the blacksmith. And all she ever says is either ""do you have that thing I asked you for"" or ""I just can't imagine myself being married, teehee"". Ok fine, I won't marry you. Byeee. 

 I found out that you can sometimes select the green arrow to give a higher quality item than the item that is required. I say sometimes. I could not use Great White Roses for the tool upgrade that requires (because, reasons?) 4 White Roses. I just never had much trouble figuring out the basics in any previous HM game. Everything was either explained fairly well via a cut scene, the person who gives you your farm giving you a tutorial, or text. The fact that you can grow things without real regard to seasons makes the game feel weird, and not grounded in nature or reality as much. I mean, it isn't to begin with? But it's odd that your animals shit in this game, BUT you can grow carrots in the summer.",1587153533,1587485800,False,14,0,0.658394396305084229,8,True,False,False,False,,,

Look it up on your own for more details).  

While this game is lacking in features compared to the previously Japanese-made titles and has various little annoying details in functionality compared to them, this game is still fun and addictive.  Features-wise, there's no character customization or really much else to customize (which I'm not super upset about it lacking, but I do like customization features), and the game seems a little short on festivals/events.  Functionality-wise, the game annoyingly lacks an in-game calendar and everyday weather forecasting (you can ask one specific character for the weather forecast, but he is only around in the evenings and only like every other day of the week), and it really sucks that animals bought from the livestock dealer aren't adults, and thus one has to wait several days for them to mature to get their products (which is especially annoying for the donkeys as they take a whopping 30 days to mature!).  Additionally, the way one progresses in the story to unlock features is sometimes annoying, as one has to obtain certain items to progress, some of which can be more difficult depending on the in-game season, plus it can be restrictive if the player just wants to farm his/her own way as opposed to what the game says to do.

That all being said, I thought the crop mutations were a really cool and interesting feature.  The characters are pretty fun and likable (Except the blue Harvest Sprite!  That guy's a d***.), and it was actually a bit of a tough decision on whom to marry.  The Player 2 Gem Sprite helper, Soleil, is a cool and useful feature (especially in the mines!), though it's worth noting that when I would activate it, Soleil's controls would go to my controller, and the player character could only used through the mouse and keyboard.

Ultimately, I just adore the base gameplay of Harvest Moon, so the annoying features were tolerable and the good stuff was just as good as ever.  If you feel the same about the base gameplay, and/or want a different, less-frills Harvest Moon game definitely pick this one up.

The development of tools and buildings is awkwardly mismatched with the resource acquisition. The fertilizer system is just a nuisance.

Примечательно то, как бесстыдно поступили разработчики: получили права на использование имени нашумевшей франшизы и выпустили под ним какую-то ерунду, воспользовавшись тем, что игроки не знают всех этих закулисных интриг. Фанаты серии, ни одна часть которой никогда не выходила на PC, восприняли игру холодно, зато ей очень обрадовались пользователи Стима и сделали игре такую кассу, что всё остальное уже не важно. Многие так и не поняли, что их обманули, и настойчиво защищают Light of Hope в обзорах: [i]это же Harvest Moon, она не может быть плохой, вы просто её не поняли! Я и сам пока не понял… но это же Harvest Moon, она не может быть плохой![/i] Это не Harvest Moon.

Сюжет банален: герой (конкретный мальчик или девочка на выбор) терпит кораблекрушение и попадает на остров, где его выхаживает смотрительница маяка. Город на острове находится в упадке, жители покинули его, здесь нет ничего интересного, но герой почему-то решает остаться и навести на острове порядок, а заодно возродить каких-то духов маяка. Герою в собственность дают избушку с кроватью и участок земли, заваленный брёвнами и камнями.

В Castaway Paradise аналогичная примитивная завязка, но это не мешает ей увлечь игрока. В Light of Hope всё не так радужно: с самого начала все здания закрыты, NPC практически нет, сажать нечего и некуда — сперва придётся расчистить участок. У вашего героя есть полоска энергии, и ресурса этого несбалансированно мало: вырвал десяток сорняков — всё, иди спать до утра, а то в обморок упадёшь. Обморок грозит ещё меньшим количеством энергии на следующий день. Со временем темп игры набирает обороты: вы чините магазин, и в нём появляется торговец, у которого можно приобрести семена овощей и фруктов; чините другие здания — и становится возможно купить семена цветов и рецепты, пообщаться с новыми персонажами и попытаться выполнить сюжетный квест: найти магические печати и вернуть их на места. Звучит интереснее, чем есть на самом деле.

Первый очевидный недостаток игры — её внешний вид. Делать такую жалкую графику для игры на платформе, на которой уже вышло столько красоты, просто неприлично (я говорю не только об AAA-играх, но и о казуальных проектах наподобие этого). Дизайном игра тоже не блещет, всё крайне примитивно и безынтересно. Вы считаете, это нормально, когда дом семьи из трёх человек представляет собой коробку с тремя кроватями?

В любой The Sims ухаживать за огородом на порядок интереснее, чем здесь. Повторяющихся действий слишком много даже для симулятора фермы, к тому же процесс ухода за овощами невозможно автоматизировать. Даже в маленькой Farm for Your Life можно было купить автоматические поливалки и нанять помощников. А самое неприятное — каждое утро растения рандомно гибнут, если их заранее не обработать дорогостоящим удобрением. Сами семена тоже влетают в копеечку, так что после всего этого фермерства и продажи овощей вы практически не получаете прибыли. Животные бьют по карману ещё больнее. Куда выгоднее рыбачить или грайндить в шахте — денег за результаты своего труда вы получите в десятки, а то и в сотни раз больше. То есть в [i]симуляторе фермы[/i] бессмысленно заниматься фермерством.

С готовкой тоже всё плохо. Рецепт варёного яйца стоит 300 долларов! ( ・_・) Сложный, наверное. Ну а сам процесс приготовления блюда представляет собой скучное окошко крафта. Готовое блюдо стоит меньше, чем сумма его ингредиентов. Несколько видов качества каждого продукта не спасают положение, даже наоборот: для некоторых рецептов нужны настолько отменные ингредиенты, что этим блюдам не суждено быть приготовленными, плакали наши ачивки. Кстати, ингредиенты разного качества занимают разные слоты в ограниченном инвентаре, так что вскоре собранные с грядок овощи не лезут в карманы.

Общаться с NPC неинтересно, а «катсцены» невозможно пропустить. Обучение слишком подробное и навязчивое, зато, когда заканчиваются очевидные вещи и начинается полная неизвестность, подсказки прекращаются. Реплики персонажей очень простые и глупые, словно написаны для дошкольников, зато разбиты на десятки пролистываемых окошек диалога, чтобы игрок одурел, пока ждёт его окончания.

Саундтрек ужасен. Даже спустя полтора года после моего последнего посещения шахты из Light of Hope я легко вспоминаю звучавшую там музыку. Думаете, это мрачный эмбиент или что-то героическое, потому что обычно в этих шахтах водятся враги, и с ними нужно драться? Вот и нет, пещерными обитателями игра нас обделила, а самым удачным звуковым сопровождением добывания руды и драгоценных камней кто-то посчитал карнавальную музыку, точнее даже, её недлинный отрывок, повторяющийся снова и снова. Да ещё игра так запрограммирована, что лестница на следующий этаж открывается под одним из последних исследованных участков, хотя по-честному здесь должен быть рандом.

Не представляю, кому эта игра могла действительно понравиться. Здесь не на что посмотреть, нечего почитать, музыку лучше не слушать, все предложенные занятия скучные, а сюжетный квест очень короткий и примитивный.",1578566386,1580743620,False,27,0,0.770121574401855469,2,False,False,False,False,,,

XSEED has made some wonderful games with much better graphics and story than this; why would there be any reason that this game would be released with such an abysmal soundtrack, horrid graphics, and hardly any fun to be had?

Ok, so I bought this because it was recommended by a friend yes (only apparently they didn't play this version whoops! lol), however I can safely say I DO NOT recommend this game.
It is so SO boring. I do love these types of games, and yes I do own and play Stardew Valley which is basically heavily inspired/ripped off of (however to put it) from Harvest Moon games, BUT this particular game just pales in comparison.

It is (at least to me) not very clear on what to do, and it takes forever to do anything/earn profit (especially for a first timer), and you cannot skip cut scenes. Not being able to skip cut scenes is a sin in my book. Straight up sin!
The energy levels are piss poor, I understand they are going to be in the very beginning but even by beginners standards they are pretty crap.
And over all... I just do not have fun playing this game. I wish I could get a refund for it, but apparently I've just played it for 'too long'. Honestly I've only played it for 'so long', because I was waiting for that  'ah-ha moment', for why people enjoy it so much. Sadly, that did not occur.
I hope whoever does get this game enjoys it, but it is, by my standards, a big no.

A shortened list on why a big ol no:
1.) too slow
2.) cannot skip cut scenes which is an absolute sin imo
3.) not enough energy, even for beginners, just like one more heart would be good (again imo)
4.) directions are not clear at least not after when you're through ""here's how to plant things"", because then it just kinda drops you like naked baby in the woods and says HAVE FUN!
5.) because I'm so used to games like Stardew, Skyrim, etc. etc. allowing gay marriage/same sex relationships, it took by surprise this one doesn't so I'm like THIS BIGOTRY SHALL NOT STAND! lol xD

Pros
- cute graphics
- supports one-handed gameplay for the most part (except when using upgraded tools)
- most characters are likeable
- changeable clothes
- having to unlock areas makes it not overwhelming
- good for children
- requests make for more gameplay, I personally find it fun
- good soundtrack
- convenient (and creepy) map that tracks villagers' locations
- automatic selection of tools is convenient
- fun main storyline
- DLC

Cons
- basically Skytree Village for PC
- forced pace for gameplay during the main storyline due to items required
- I don't understand how Soleil can help
- heteronormativity
- Doc looks too different and is a bit creepy at first
- villagers don't walk places, they teleport
- too many qualities of products
- scenes not skippable
- constant load screens
- the only cat is the stray bobcat that can only be adopted after a house upgrade
- weird requirements for tool upgrades
- [spoiler] I thought that Nova was selfish for not thinking of the consequences of her actions and only focusing on what she wants [/spoiler]
- only 3 save slots

It's not horrible, but I'm only in Fall of Year 1 and am getting bored.

Part of the problem is the tediousness of farming itself.  It takes forever to upgrade equipment, I've only managed to get the first upgrade so far, and I can still only hoe and water a total of three squares at a time.  Needless to say, I'm finding farming tedious, which is pretty much the biggest purpose of the game.  And, as far as I've read, there are no sprinklers implemented nor can you hire anyone to help with the work.  Currently, I also only have one chicken and one cow, and I kind of don't want to get more animals because I think it'll get just as tedious as the farming.

I could probably overlook these aspects more, but characters are just flat.  They say the same things over and over, and there's really no engaging story to draw you in and make you want to develop friendships.  As with the farming, I'm just a little bored with the people and feel like I'm just doing the same over and over and will continue to do the same over and over with little change--other than better and/or more stuff I can buy.

On top of that, instructions that are given are very sparse or just nonexistent.  An example of this was the mage who kept showing up in my house saying to meet the mages at the Goddess' Hot Springs--something I needed to do in order to progress the story.  I thought that meant I needed to fix the Hot Springs and then could progress.  No.  It was only by accidentally wandering into an area that I discovered the right place to go.  Then there's some gem sprite--Soleil I think.  Suddenly it emerged from a purple gem in my house.  What's he for?  I don't know.  By accident, clicking on the sprite's gem in the tool section of my menu, I discovered a whole new submenu where I could give the sprite gems for ""help.""  I have no clue what this help is.  I gave the sprite a gem and nothing seemed to happen.  I clicked on his gem home in my house, and it suddenly said ""Do you want to end multiplayer?""  I clicked yes because what?  And then the sprite disappeared.  I had no clue if it was permanent or what, so I went back to a previous save. 

And then there's your bag.  You are limited in what you can carry--only 99 of each item until you can upgrade your house for storage.  I have no problem with this factor.  The storage factor that is frustrating, though, is the unknown limiter as to the overall number of different items you can carry.  What is that number?  No clue.  It's not as if you're given slots so you know just how many different items you have or that you're warned--hey, you have 52 of 75 items that you can carry.  Nope, you hit that too many item quota at inopportune times--like when completing a quest and getting a unique reward or when finding a new gemstone in the mine. . .  However, it doesn't tell you what's going on.  You just a get a message that says something like you have too many of this item in your bag.  So you try selling some of X item that you're currently harvesting, wondering why the game thinks you have too many when you only have 23.  Or it just won't let you create gems from ore and you have no clue why and think the game is broken. . .

At some point, I'll probably come back to this game, but only for little bits at a time.  With that in mind, I'll give this a hesitant thumbs up, but it's probably not a game that will completely draw you in and immerse you in the fictional world, which was what I was looking for.",1555541651,1555580797,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If Soleil is included for special edition then the multiplayer feature should be adjusted for use on a keyboard for the PC version. I would change the way the grass seed was planted as well, instead of disappearing when you harvest it for food, it would simply grow back and if you didnt want it there anymore you could use the hoe, Also it would be more convienent if the tilled land would stay into the next day instead of having to do it over after those one time harvestables, Infact it would be much nicer if the veggies could all be multi harvestable...Overall this is really great game!

I find this game to be the weakest in the series. Does that mean I dislike the game? Of course not, as you can see I've put several hours into this game. I found the game lacking alot of depth compared to the other previous harvest moon games. The game has alot of typos in the texts (which shows they didn't really put much thought into the game.) Another thought was the graphics...for being released to both PC and the Switch, the graphics are not that great compared to Animal Parade and Tree of Tranquity ( Excluding the 3DS HM).  I found little exploration in the game nor challenge. 

  Now on to the good stuff, I still found the game fun even with all the flaws. The classic Harvest Moon Farming,Fishing,Mining, and  Social interactions are still there. There are more crops to discover and requests from the towns people and the facial expressions are funny. Each character has their own quirky personality and isn't afraid to be a little weird. I am still playing this game and hopefully I can add more to the list of good things than negative. 

  In conclusion, I like this game. Is it the best? No, but it's still fun.

This is totally one of the SIMPLEST games the series has ever made. Some of the games are simple but work well because the play is good, characters are interesting and cutscenes and lore are entertaining (ie HM 64, HM Save the Homeland). 

This game feels like a step back from the potential the series should have unlocked after 20 years of game development. It's still a decent game and I enjoy it, but it's disappointing as a Harvest Moon game. 

Overly simple in an insulting way, weird graphics, ugly Harvest Sprites, weird child rearing spouse raising thing with the limited edition spiritual marriage candidate, and the plot can be beat far sooner than getting married. Money is way too easy to get just by mining, the crops mutation are sorta interesting but the fact that I was able to grow a summer flower in winter feels like cheating. The heart meter has always been my least favorite since its so hard to tell the exact energy you have. There's no calendar so I had no idea how many days a season lasted (35?? WTF?) The ridiculous size of the farm is pointless given you can grow all over the entire island. Weeds grow way too often for how much energy they take. Island map is way too small and very generic.

However, the game is easy to get a rythm and schedule for and the whole gathering items for the big item is very RPG and still entertaining. The heart events may be boring but still fun to trigger regardless. Making friends is easy and there is plenty of time in the day to farm, forge, and socialize. Hot springs for stamina are ALWAYS a plus. Kinda interesting how all wild flowers have the same graphic but can be registered as different flowers. I really appreciate when the HM series has wedding clothes, I like that you're involved in making them, it makes the wedding feel more real. You can customize things a little but not so much you stress over it. The game isn't too complicated so it's a nice way to relax and have fun without worrying about puzzles or clues. The side quests are kinda fun, usually you naturally progress those items anyway so it's not that inconvient to complete them.

For this particular game, I would give it a 3.5/5 star rating.

It's very cute, definitely reminds me of old school Harvest Moon games, and was quite enjoyable. I went into the game not expecting it to be like Stardew Valley, especially considering that although both games incorporate similar gameplay, the developers are different, and I was correct.

As for the beginning of the game- washing up on an island after a storm- I detracted points for that. I recall that particular scenario from at least two different HM games (HM: Island of Happiness (exactly the same in that the character stays on the island and restores it) and HM: Tree of Tranquility (the character was moving there already and got washed ashore in a storm )), if not more.  The island itself is very gorgeous, I loved the graphics, though it did bug me that the wild flower 'marguerites' and 'tulips' looked excactly the same with broad white petals and a yellow center while the same flowers that were grown as crops looked completely different and neither one looked like the wild ones. Though when the wild versions of the flowers were picked it showed a version of the crop flowers? I don't get it, but okay. I liked having the mutation crops back, yay! A nice random surprise whenever it was time to harvest.

Most of the characters are very likeable. With that being said, here are my disliked characters- 1, Sally (I personally found her to be an annoying brat during the quest to get the axe- she promised to believe that the main character was indeed a farmer if they brought crops and then when that was done stated that they were probably stolen right in front of her mother and didn't even get a scolding for it!?! ) and 2, Doc! (I thought he was annoying and weird, not going to lie. I didn't like him in HM: Skytree Village, hasn't changed at all.) The mages were nice new characters to interact with and great new romance options.

There are clothing options but they are limited to 4 per character choice (male/female) and only available after restoring the lighthouse >.< And there is no option for changing the hairstyle :( Developers, if you are reading this, I would pay for more dlc to add hair styles and more clothing choices, seriously.  Melanie deserves more than just the six outfits she sells and why not add someone in who can do hairstyles? Or maybe one of the townsfolk has a hidden talent and is able to cut hair? I just find it really surprising that there is literally no one on the entire island who does hair styling considering how short some of the male characters keep their hair.

Another developer suggestion: please do a patch that prevents the main character from being forced back to the barn every single time an animal is purchased. It's annoying and frustrating. I saved and saved to buy two chicks and wasn't able to purchase both because I was running late on time and I got sent home with the shopkeeper and my first chick and didn't make it back in time. I know that the first time with the cow and sheep it's necessary because of getting the tools but after that? Especially with the chickens? Please consider changing that.

Before I considered buying it, I heard that it was about 30$ and I wasn't even aware that there was DLC for a Harvest Moon game. I came into th Harvest Moon Franchise pretty late, and I have to say that this game does not give a good first impression to newer players. I haven't played through the entire game only because it does get painfully grindy which, in some cases, is good. I did not want to put in I don't even know how many hours into this game just to do a review. I do plan to play more because there is somewhat interesting content to enjoy, but this game is a good example of why I wish there was ""Kinda"" option in terms of recommendation. 

I have played one other game in the Harvest Moon Franchise, and that was A Wonderful Life. I have not played it properly whatsoever because the controls for me were really old school and it was hard to keep track of my stamina. However, I still got a feel for how the game worked, and honestly it was definitely a better game then this mobile port of a mess ever was.

The graphics are a mess. You have 3D characters in a 2D world. This works for certain games. I understand that this is a mobile port, so I get why that decision was made, but for a PC game, that doesn't look too good, and it's kinda off-putting. 

The other thing that's not very enjoyable is the dialouge. The tutorial is unskippable, and it takes almost 2 hours to complete which almost seems scammish because if you wanted to refund the game, you wouldn't be able to because you can't refund a game if it has 2 hours logged into it. You can't get a proper feel for the game until after you get the tutorial done, which again, is extremely scammish. This is probably one of the games I got during Christmas that I wanted to refund in the back of my mind but it was too late. So the only option I had was to keep playing it or just put it under the ""Don't Bother"" category in my library. 

The DLCs are a bit pointless. If anything they should already be in game. Why do I want to pay 2$ just to marry the King of the Underworld? Again, it is a bit scammish. It was a good thing I got the bundle on sale. It's nice to have these options for those who want those options, but putting a paywall on a small part of the game is annoying. I mean, for some, people already had payed 30$ for it, why do they want to pay more money for something that, again, should be part of the game already, especially if you're trying to get away with selling this game for a higher amount then the original mobile port. Seeing a 20$-30$ price tag might have made people think that the DLCs were part of the game already if they were just coming from mobile, so in that point of view, some people may have felt scammed in some way, shape or form. You either sell the game as a whole, or make it free to play if you want to throw some DLCs on it. DLCs work for some games, DLCs are supposed to be like an after thought of sorts. For this game however, it feels like they were planning the DLC whilst making the game. These things could have been just added while in the making, making it worth the price tag.

I've only been playing this game because it is a great time killer. Once you upgrade your tools, the grind is reduced. The game is still somewhat unbalanced however. You actually make more money from fishing and mining then you do with farming. For a Harvest Moon game, that is just wrong. Farming is deemed pointless on the terms of a source of income. You can still cook, and use the things you grow to upgrade your tools, fix buildings, and give gifts to the NPCs. 

Tutorials are unbalanced as well. They teach you everything you need to know about farming, the most horrible income source,yet they teach you nothing of the fishing or mining mechanics. Who was suppose to know they had to hoe the ground to actually progress through the mines? For me, fishing was a pain to understand because I didn't know when to click, is it when there was ripples in around the bobber, or when there was a exclamation point? Sooner or later I figured everything out, but for some people, that can make or break their purchase because they don't know if the game is broken or not because there is no direct explanation. Yes there's Tips/Tricks in the game, but for fishing, the explanation was too vague to understand.

Overall, this game is all over the place. It's not rewarding in some places, and it's possibly a scam in some way. I only recommend this game at discounted price, and if you see past the issues and are in need of a good time killler. Other then that, don't buy it.

The story is fine, I like the variety of crops and animals but I cannot get past the mechanics and slow loading times. They take away from the fun. The watering can upgrade is terrible. You have to get it just right on the squares to water 3 at once. Maybe I am missing something but how it is now it takes me way too long to water all my crops. The hoe also is frustrating to use when upgraded. 

The mines are okay but I wish it didn't take so long to find a ladder. 

THE LOADING TIMES. It takes way too long to go from one screen to the next. It is like I am playing on a mobile phone. 

Like I said, if these things improve I will update my review. I am continuing to play until I complete the game so maybe my opinion will change.",1546845679,1548231571,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Edit: What I really love about this game are the characters. Now, Stardew Valley definitely is the most refined in comparison to Harvest Moon LoH; it has better mechanics, better visuals and a much more expansive world. However, me being me, I'm a sucker for fun characters. This is where Harvest Moon LoH wins in this regard and is the sole reason as to why I play this over Stardew Valley, unfortunately. 

And of course I'm going to be comparing this game to Stardew Valley; Stardew Valley is the game that single handedly dominated Harvest Moon fans and any fan of Agricultural RPGs. 

Now, this is not to say that I dislike Stardew Valley; in fact, I love Stardew Valley. It's just like, at least to me, what's the point of being in a town where the word ""edgy"" can describe literally like 5 residents of the whole town? The word ""grumpy"" can describe at least 4, I believe. And there are only about 24 people in the whole town. Harvest Moon has fun, quirky characters; It's got a witch, a wizard, a family of, what I believe to be, ninjas, dorky little fairies (that personally make me grind my teeth in frustration from the ""kawaii""), hot moms, some demon chick, and, apparently, you can bang the Harvest Goddess. 

Now the game plays like a mobile game, in fact, I believe that this game was made with mobile devices in mind, as evidenced with Harvest Moon LoH being available on the app store (it's also on the ps4, which is kind of hilarious; really hilarious actually). To the core it's a mobile game and that's the reason why people are always commenting about it looking like a mobile game; it's because it is one, it's on the app store. The design pholosophy fits that of a mobile phone. For instance, you can click wherever you want to go and your character runs towards the specified spot (that I like a lot), and you can click and drag your mouse to control the character, much like how you can press and hold your finger against a touch screen and drag towards a specific direction to make your character move.

Again, this game is far, far, FAR inferior when compared to Stardew Valley. The controls aren't the best, the graphics, while nostalgic for me since it reminds me of old anime-esque games I would play when I was a shota, are less than appealing (borders disgusting, actually), the mining is tedious, gathering materials is such a chore (you only get one wood or stone per mining or foraging respectively, i'm not kidding...), it's priced at a significantly higher price than Stardew Valley, literally no character customization at all (what? why? the protag is silent anyway, so why NOT give me the option to make a character?), selling items is such a hassle (you have to click on the number box to switch from the hundreds to tens to ones and you have to click on the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the number of items you want to sell. This  obviously could've been handled better, but again, , this game is made with mobile devices at heart.), no notifications or sound cues to tell you your character is almost out of stamina (messed up and passed out a couple of times from this. I'm not always going to be looking at the stamina bar, given that I'm more than likely going to be doing other things while playing this kind of game), things are hotkeyed to pretty inconvenient keys and you can't change them (fantastic design choice 10/10), the buttons for the XBox controller doesn't go away regardless of whether or not you're playing with a controller, you can't mod it (as far as I know)...

Wait, why did I thumbs up the game again?.... Oh yeah... I'm a sucker for fun characters...

But jokes aside, avoid this game; don't buy it unless it's on sale, and even then be cautious. This game isn't worth the money. The only reason why I have it is because of the Christmas Sale. If I were you, i'd watch a LongPlay of the game first before deciding whether or not the game is truly worth your money. Decide for yourself whether or not you want it; don't just jump on the bandwaggon without knowing why.

I see a few reviews talking about the long tutorial. This is completely normal and on brand for Harvest Moon. Every Harvest Moon game I've played has a very long tutorial, and usually you can't skip them. It's annoying, but just something that you deal with if you like Harvest Moon. 
The loading is a tad annoying, but I wouldn't say that it'd ruin the game, or even make me wan't to not reccomend it.

Pros: context sensitive tool use that makes it unnecessary to switch between a tool every time, a list that memorizes all the villagers birthdays likes and dislikes automatically for you, the coop assistant that more or less shortcuts everything for you (he or she is its own upgraded 3 by 3 hoe and watering can), and the horse is pretty damn fast compared to some of the horses in the past. 
Cons: The character graphics and music are sorely lacking- it's hard to look at a character's face and decide you want to marry it unless you splurge for the DLC bachelor/bachelorette. The music is so repetitive and poorly composed that it's not really worth listening to, especially in the mines where it becomes maddening quick. The Cicadas in the summer CAN'T BE MUTED. The festivals are hard to plan around especially since there is no calendar to look at in-game to help you plan it just notes on the bookshelf that you have to individually select to research the days. And the coop is a bit of a nightmare to use if you're a single player: either you need to map your controller configuration to two separate characters or use the controller and keyboard interchangeably to get the job done. I get the impression that the NPC characters are so bland and archetyped that I might not bother befriending them. 
 Finally, and this is just personal opinion, the gem Spirit doesn't do anything for me. It resembles a floating baby [spoiler] I can't imagining wanting to marry its adult form [/spoiler].

Think of the Final Fantasy ports and some of the more popular PC games that are psuedo casual that were ported to mobile. It's really just the other way around in this case, as this is a full-length game with just as much content as any other Harvest Moon. 
I DO NOT like the art style very much, but it's not the end of the world. I like the gameplay, and the speed of the game, and the fact that I can just click a tree and start chopping without worrying about having an axe. Or click a rock, and I break a stone. The up-close portraits of the villagers faces are animated and a little bit funny sometimes. I wouldn't have expected that from the screenshots of the game. 
In the older Harvest Moons, the plot and story are so lackluster and just kind of drag. Chores are repetitive and the world becomes this big place you just have to traverse to no end, over and over again.  World is a little smaller here, the tasks are less tedious, and you can just get through a day, a week, a season, a lot more casually.

It took me till about fall day 10 to finsih the main story line

If you actually follow the games proper way of playing you take good care of your animals, and i struggled getting 2 great wool because it wouldn't accept any higher quality for the quest to get married (Yes this annoyed me)
I wanted to get the achievements for everything in this game BUT for the harvest all and fish all you have to go through this extreme breeding process for even a harvest moon game and there are too many crops for this just look it up theres around 10-15 crops per season some needing to be pre-breeded from pervious year seasons its a pain.
The soilel multiplayer option made this game in the beginning easier. I loved that, i used my controller to help me and get more stanima in the beginning at the beginning
I wanted to get the grown up child achievement : nope, 90 days worth of game play to grow up a child. Have to wait an hour each day to feed said child (required to grow up) so 90 minutes of game play even if your rushing if not like 180 minutes.
This game as a harvest moon game felt empty because of the fact that you cannot make decent money off crops you need to use the mines for money. the story is so easily completed. the requests dont come in equal quanities for villagers, i only started getting requests from new villagers when started IGNORING the normal villagers.
They could have done so much beter if you want a better harvest moon please go play the games by the orginal creators of harvest moon as harvest moon is copyrighted in the usa and is now story of seasons. 

SOrry for the long review. I liked the game at times i hated it at other times. I also wont be playing anymore. I would not suggest it to friends.

That was very boring, and didn't even lead to choices you could make to affect your own game.

The animation for farming/plowing/watering was tedious, and energy management isn't given many options early in the game.  There is very little food, for example, that you might recharge your stamina with.

Playing on PC with a keyboard/mouse, I was not able to figure out how to make upgraded tools (hoe/watering can) function in their advanced capacity.  ""hold the action button"" did not work.
Edit: I was able to make the advanced tools work only after changing my action button to space bar instead of left mouse click.

There seems to be basically only one way to play this game, and it's very linear.  There would be no reason to replay it after finishing it once.  There is little chance for alternative challenges.

The game mechanic of crop mutations looked like it had potential for interest, but there seemed never to be a purpose to growing mutated crops other than acheiving a complete encyclopedia in game.   If grindy completionist goals aren't appealing to you, that would be very boring.

I was not able to find a decent wiki for this game.  The apparently official game wiki I did find only mentioned this edition of the game in passing, and did not give details of how to play it or understand its particular challenges.  

I would not recommend this game to anyone.  I put dozens of hours of play into this game hoping to give it a fair shake because I had always heard good things about Harvest Moon, so you can't say I wasn't fair in trying to let it show its best side to me.

(I mean - almost ALL of them, across several different platforms)  And this game will probably be the last one.
I cannot recommend this game, either to old HM vets or newer players.
The TL;DR version:
Price too expensive, gameplay very bland; Stardew Valley does it better. (albiet the graphics are ancient)

The cons: This will likely be a personal view, but here goes: 
1) The characters are a directly from Skytree Valley, which is doubly disappointing since this is the 20th anniversary. A few new faces are not going to make it feel like a new game.
2) The trash outside your home regrows too fast. You can pluck the weeds and mine the stone, but it comes back waaaaay too fast. If you chop a tree, it should stay gone for weeks. There's a lot trees in other parts of the map.
3) Characters are lack luster, the dialogue never seems to change, even when their heart levels are up. After a while, I just gave up talking to anyone, which is a shame, because keeping heart levels up should be rewarding, feel like progression -  not feel like a chore.
4) Small bugs still exist (like handing in a quest item to Carol, but you get Gus who replies) 
5) The summer ambiance (Skytree suffered from this too) - There's an insect or something making an awful racket, I turn off the sounds until summer was over.
6) Time stops indoors. This is especially annoying when you have to wait outside the barn for animals to eat. (like an hour)
7) Mining - this is where all the money comes from, not farming (which seems counter-intuitive for a farming game.)
8) Requests from villagers come in the mail, which is the most unsocial way possible.
9) The mutation effect on crops carried over from Skytree is just as clunky, and frankly, not needed.
I could go on, but I think I've made my point.

Pros?
1) I like the upgraded tools and the way you can 'steer' them. An upgraded tool can operate in a zigzag line, which is handy.
2) Lots of areas for farming, once you get the tools to clear the way.",1538348169,1538348169,False,5,0,0.52903139591217041,0,True,False,False,False,,,

At the start, it can be quite difficult to get the ball rolling, as the saying goes ""gotta spend money to make money"" seems to be turned up to 11 at first. But to be completely fair, it was quite rewarding to finally see the village complete. 

Not sure if it is a pro or a con for this one, but every bachlorette, with the exception of one, loves the same item, and its not exactly a difficult one to find either. This made that aspect of the game feel almost too easy, but hey, some people might like it, others wont. (I only played as a male character, so I'm not sure if this applies to the guys as well) Theres also the whole thing of when you go to let the barn animals outside, they seemingly pop up at random around the farm. Good luck getting them all in the same pen in a timely manner.

Now then, it gives off a strong vibe of being a mobile port (hell, in the tutorial it even says touch the screen and drag to move, guess we shouldn't be too surprised considering its Natsume, and they spelled their own name wrong in HM64).

This is a different approach to any of the other Harvest Moon franchise and I'm not really that keen on it. Usually, used to meeting the mayor or someone who was a friend of your grandfather. Instead, you just wash ashore and found by a random villager who just helps you and shows you an unused farm.

Having to pay out of your own pocket to restore the village is a new one for me, and to which it's a pain. The beginning is painfully slow due to this. Restoring places, and if you restore the wrong building its another day or more before you can progress on with the storyline. When you finally can progress it just feels like things move fast, so I've been kind of prolonging advancing the storyline and just kind of focusing on befriending the villagers I guess.

Talking about the villigers, the good thing about Light of Hope is it seems faster on raising their friendship level. I guess having the requests really does help progress their levels. 

Having no calender in this game sucks so much, holy heaps. I mean, I can't be the only one who really relied on the calender that was provided to keep tabs on birthdays and especially keep tabs on whatever festivals were going to be happening, right? This is kind of the biggest thing that I am annoyed with in the game. I need the calender for the love of that there is.

The mining in this game is pretty ridicluous. The income on the gems just breaks the game for you there. I feel cheated on how easy I was able to almost find all the gems and material from the first day I got the hammer. Forget buying the seeds just go all mining. Like the other Harvest Moon games, different floors of the mining gave you specific ores. Nope! Not in Light of Hope. Just find Jade on level 2 out of 100. Refine the ore and sell it for 2,000 gil. Broken.

I don't really know what else to say. I'm only about 13 hours in the game and I'm just slowly prolonging from advancing for awhile. Let's not forget though that Yasuhiro Wada did not help with the making of the game since he left in 2010, so it's most likely why the game has an off vibe to it. I'll probably give an update after I possibly played more of the game.

[b]OVERALL RATING: 6.7/10 [/b]

[olist]
[*] STORY (6.5/10): The start of the story is kinda cringey and unrealistic [spoiler]because your character just got washed up in that island during a storm then the next thing you know is that you're staying in the island to help bring back the people and restore it to its former glory.[/spoiler] It also became more of a fantasy genre (with all the magical stuff in the story) than the two versions that I have played. However, the good thing about this version is that you would somehow feel and keep track of the progression of the story since they would actively give you things to do for the story to move on.

[*] CHARACTERS (5/10): The characters are nice but I feel like they are lacking in story. I would love it more if there's more story behind each character and their relationships with each other (like in friends of mineral town). You also don't really feel getting close to people that much based from interactions unless you check out the relationship bars (musical notes in this case). You won't also feel the rivalry between you and the potential partners of your love interests.

[*] GAMEPLAY (8.2/10): Gameplay is good for me but let me break it down in different aspects.

[list]
[*] Farming (9.5/10):
They made things easier for you to grow your farm (except the weeds are annoying and you don't have a sickle to cut all of them at once) and there is a huge land where you can farm. Aside from that, the crop mutation is great that it would make you feel that you really are managing a farm.

[*] Rebuilding Island and Villager Requests (9/10):
I like how you have something to do everyday. [spoiler]At the start of the game, you won't have access to the entire island and you would have to rebuild things first to expand and unlock more areas.[/spoiler] Aside from that, villagers would keep giving you requests for you to accomplish. It basically keeps on giving you some goals that you need to achieve as you keep playing the game.

[*] Events/Festivals (6/10):
There are just a few events and for me, they are not as challenging as the ones provided by the other versions. I especially liked the chicken fight, horse race, and dog frisbee in the more friends in mineral town. Even the cooking festival is not as challenging here.
[/list]

[*] GRAPHICS and SOUNDTRACK (7/10):
The graphics and animation is just fine but they are not really the best ones either. As for the soundtrack, I believe that it is fairly similar to the other versions and generally suits the overall feels of the game.
[/olist]

To sum it up, it's not really the best version of Harvest Moon out there just like what others have pointed out. However, I would still recommend because it is just a chill game and is nice for killing some time. Besides, completing all of the steams achievements for this version is challenging enough and for perfectionists and goal-oriented players like me, it helps me develop my focus and strategy skills in achieving the goals set by the game.",1531765347,1531767868,True,8,2,0.632468581199645996,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Das reich werden mit der Miene hat nichts mehr mit Harvest Moon zu tun. Wie schon mal von jemanden erwähnt, nach 5 Minuten in der Miene kommst du als reiches Püppchen raus, was das anpflanzen von Obst und Gemüse total Sinnlos macht weil man damit kaum Geld verdient. Genauso wie das halten der Tiere. Das was eigentlich Harvest Moon ausmachte, das Farmleben, wird zu einem reinen Bergarbeiter Spiel. Das hat nichts mehr mit Harvest Moon zu tun. 

Ich hab es mir geholt da ich dachte, dass es vielleicht was werden könnte, nein ist es aber nicht. Vorallem in den Bergen wenn du dort herum läufst verzehrt sich das Bild etwas und das ist sehr unangenehm für die Augen. Die Grafik ist aus der letzten Tonne geholt und die 3D animationen waren auch mal deutlich besser. 

Das man alleine eine Insel aufbauen soll, die eigentlichen Bewohner gar nix machen und sich lieber aus den Staub machen, finde ich doch sehr zweifelhaft und nicht gut durchdacht. Noch dazu wollen sie immer wieder etwas von dir und geben dir zum dank das du ihr Haus/ Laden wieder aufgebaut hast, einfach nichts. Das Spiel zeigt immer wieder ein ""nehmen aber nichts geben"" was ich sehr schade finde. Noch dazu finde ich blöd, wenn man einen Auftrag fertig hat und einen Bewohner die Sachen geben will, man manchmal gefühlt Minuten lang suchen oder sogar warten muss weil man die Person gar nicht findet, nicht mal auf der Karte. Wo sind die denn dann? Spontan mal eben weg gefahren mit dem Boot? Denke ich nicht. Das ist auch wieder nicht gut durchdacht. Die sind an Orte wo du noch gar nicht hin kannst weil WEGE VERSPERRT SIND und du die erst frei schalten musst, wo ich mich frage, wie kommen die denn dannn da hin?

Noch dazu war jedes Harvest Moon Spiel auf Deutsch und dieses ist auf Englisch was auch nicht für das eigentliche Harvest Moon spricht. Es ist einfach nur reine Geldmacherei mit dem Namen mehr nicht.

I got the game early on and those reviews were daunting, but I ignored them and am glad I did.

I've actually enjoyed this as another Harvest Moon.
You farm, you mine, you fish, you cook, you find someone to settle down with, do periodic festival stuff, and you can go hardcore completionist and collect everything if you're into that. It's standard for the series. It has its differences, but at the end of the day it's another Harvest Moon game no matter what people tell you. It doesn't need to evolve into a complex monster and become a farming simulator. It's simple and cute farming fun and that's what matters.

The story can be completed very quickly if you choose, but story has never been a major staple of Harvest Moon games 
anyhow. It's always been a fun little side thing to give you a reason to be there farming and that's about it.

I did not play other games like Skytree Village that have similar characters and skins. I can undstand why the community rejected the reproduction of them. I do not think a price tag of $30+ is justified on this game. A game needs to feel new and completely different with occational nastolgia being okay. I think reusing  characters was a bad move. The game needed more character customization to get rid of the same plain look. I liked the bright colors of the game even if the graphics disappointed.

One thing that is enjoyable is the simplicity of the tool actions for farming, it cuts time and allows for easier mass farming which allows to farm more without it feeling like a hassel every game day. However, the profit coming out of the mine needs to be tuned down a litttle to keep it on par with farming. Being able to rush the mine everyday for instant profits does take away from spending days farming. Some people like to fish, some farm, some mine so all aspects need to be rewarding as equally as possible.

Another positive I found was the rate you could befriend the towns folk was great. Sometimes in the harvest moon games it takes too long to befriend people and I won't even bother with them all but the rate was good in this game. 

Lastly, the story line for this game felt too short. I purposely delayed pushing the story at points because I was flying through it. If I can beat the game before 1 calendar year I don't like it, there is not enough challenge. To those looking to buy the game just know this isn't a long game.

I will recommend playing the game as a loyal harvest moon fan to experience it yourself and judge. I'd give it a 3/5.

I hope the next game is more impressive.

The idea is still original to the first and previous harvest moon games and it's just circulating around that idea. However if you do not mind about the graphics then it is also a contributing factor on why you should play this game, since this is the first ever harvest moon game that was released on the PC platform so i think most of the harvest moon players and lovers wouldn't mind. This is just to bring back to the old nostalgic experience that harvest moon players have played over the franchise over the years. Plus the graphic were not that bad compared to the other harvest moon games.

Negative Review : To the expectation these days and especially in 2017/2018, demands are a bit pushed to the top and most gamers who have experienced high end games would negate badly about this ""light of hope"" graphics, considering that it is not easy and cheap to develop a game, i think natsume can and should made a harvest moon game on pc platform with graphics and interfaces that are much refined from the older generations of harvest moon. I think Natsume can bring more innovations and new ideas to this franchise for example variations of stories or more chapters/arc considering this is released on steam or maybe have a team that could write a new events on each regular updates just like producing an anime.

 Pros
-Farming controls are easy, no need to switch between tools
-Interesting characters, the addition of witches are cool. 
-Farming mutations are interesting.
-Graphics for animals are cute.


Cons
-As some people have said, the graphics are stale. It looks like something you'd see early 2000's. It's not even cutesy rustic, it's just ugly. 
-Lack of depth, everything is strait forward. There's no secrets or anything, no surprises. It's all just pretty boring. 
-Characters don't have much depth to them. No real back stories. 
-Not very many animals in the game
-Game is way, wayyy to easy. Completing the main storyline takes less than 10 hours, and can be completed in a little over one game ""season."" The items don't require mutations or anything.
-very little/no upgrades to buildings, very little buildings/useful features in general. What happened to the makers? Those made production interesting. 
-No Calendar, and no furniture to add to the house. What. 
-No TV like in previous games, if you want to know the weather you have to wait until 5pm and go talk to the wizard dude. 
-Remember the festivals that rate your sheep, cows, chickens? They're not in this game.
-no story/time progression. 10 years can pass and everything is still the same. Nothing new happens. 
-No foraging like previous games. You can find flowers, but that's it. The flowers all look the same on the ground, just an ugly big white flower. 
-Can't customize your character, no clothes, Nada.
-Charging your watering can/hoe is weird. You have to drag the curor, but if you're not in the exact right spot your character will move in that annoying touch screen thing. 
-The whole restoring the lighthouse thing is bland. You need very little to do it. At least Tree of Tranquility it took actual time to replant the tree. 
-Request system is annoying. It seems like the actual mechanism behind the game, the lighthouse seems like an afterthought. 
-Balance of the game is way off. What's the point of planting crops and raising animals when you can find gems EASILY and sell them 900-5000 gold a piece? There's very little to actually buy after anyways once you fix the town and repair the lighthouse.

It's overall a pretty easy game so it's a good choice if you just wanna relax. It's a lot easier to build friendships with townies than in older harvest moon games.

The story isn't overwhelmingly long, but you can kinda get stuck if you take your time (like i did) and need something from a season you just left (I didn't know that you could grow crops outside of their season back then) so that is kinda annoying.
If you like achievements you're in for a heavy load of rng and reloading saves as mutation of crops and trees is just pure rng.

It's not worth the money. It's barely worth $10-15 at the most.

I will say that I felt that some of the game changes in this one is nice. Being able to not have select the tool for every single thing really does help. Also viewing which crop you've planted is nice, and I also liked the story line.

However, as an old Harvest Moon fan I don't think this game lives up to its predecessors, but seeing as this is an entry title on PC I'm happy it made its way here.

First of all, it took about 30 hours for me to complete (Keeping in mind I used Cheat Engine to speed up the travelling and DIDN'T cheat any other way). 

The game revolves around you completing requests for the various villagers in town. At first there won't be many but as you continue through the story and fix up the village - they will come back. These requests are mainly obtain x amounts of item y and hand it in for a reward that may be in the form of money or recipes which help you with your farm. Some items are only obtainable in certain seasons unless you use fertiliser, or aren't obtainable unless you have a certain recipe. These quests are enjoyable to do until you reach endgame, where it then just feels pointless as the rewards become redundant and the grind gets to you. 

Secondly, this game is a farming game right? What if I told you that 95% of your profits come from mining? Why is this the case? Because you don't know what future job requests are going to require, therefore you stockpile all of your crops hoping that it will become useful in future. THERE ARE A LOT OF JOB REQUESTS. I've finished the game and I still have requests. It's essentially Mining Moon: Light at the End of the Tunnel. 1 Soul gem (rarest gem in the game) is worth 5,000... let's say we have 36 of one crop that sells for 80 each, that adds up to 2,880. Why waste my time watering 36 crops for +5 days and then sell them when I can just spend that time in the mine and obtain +10 soul gems along with other rare gems and ores?

Third, the characters are likeable but there isn't much interaction availiable. you talk to them once, then you talk to them again, on the third try the same dialogue just loops. Also, the story is a bit confusing as it doesn't always tell you what you're meant to do, there's no quest menu (job requests excluded) so I spent a lot of time googling answers.

Conclusion: 
Is this game worth $30 USD? If you calculate accordingly to my hours that's about $1 per hour of gameplay. 
Yes I do recommend this game, but only if you're new the HM series, looking for a farming/life sim or if it's on sale. 
The game is good, but it has its cons. cons that are mainly experienced towards the end game.

If you really want to experience HM, grab an emulator or be like me and grab a 3DS. The 3DS is backwards compatible with DS games and there are plenty of HM games out there (Rune Factory 1,2 and 3 included).",1516349467,1516349467,True,8,0,0.565589010715484619,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I enjoyed this game for a while, I have nearly 30 hours playtime, but it just doesnt keep the player motivated to keep playing. It takes forever to get a wife and upgrade your house. Upgrading houses was always my favorite this to do in farm games, but this one makes you wait and wait and find lots of rare items that must go into the build. Farming is completely useless becuase you make far more money mining. You can make more moeny in two days of mining than you can a full month of farming, and with far less work.

It is also NOT a great Harvest Moon game. Its fun. I'm playing the heck out of it. But there was clearly a shift from what I can only assume was intended to be a mobile game to what we have now. The game itself is kind of contradictory; it's both really simple, and really complicated, but in all the wrong ways. For instance, it's purposely vague on story goals, and everything is gated in weird ways. You need flowers to upgrade your tools. Also, your crops can randomly mutate, and become ""great"" versions of themselves (ie Great strawberry, etc.). There are also ""great"" versions of every mutation, leading to about 10000000 kinds of corn that you can grow, which all make different, unstackable, kinds of cornmeal. Which you can use to make different kinds of bread or feed. These ""great"" item upgrades do NOT always work the same as others. Sometimes it will let you use higher quality items to fulfill requests, but not always. I can't figure out what the distinction is. Also, you can mix and match item quality levels for requests (when it works), but not for town improvements. For instance, you need donkey fur to build a dock, but you need 5 donkey furs all at the same level to build it. Its needlessly complicated, especially since the player can't really control what gets upgraded, and what stays at base level. The story is okay, it was actually pretty decent.

But while it can be an enjoyable time-waster (and boy did I sink a few hours into it before I burned out at last on it!), this game just lacks that special addictive quality that makes the Story of Seasons series, the Rune Factory titles and Stardew Valley so very, very absorbing. If those games are generally the A-titles of farming games, I would rate this latest Harvest Moon game a B-.

Pros: the farming of this game is stream-lined and relatively easy to do on a day-to-day basis, working my way down to the 100th floor of the mine was very fun, great variety of animals to collect and crops to cultivate, it's fun to revitalize a deserted town/island, and Edmond is a genuinely adorable bachelor.

Cons: the art is frankly rather ugly and amateurish, the main story line could have been interesting with better writing but seems so lifeless and dispiriting, almost all of the characters are dull as dull can be, you're basically forced to abuse your animals in order to get the products you need out of them, it's just not as good as recent rival farming games.

Basically, if you're really really really desperate for a new farming game to play until the next Story of Seasons or Stardew Valley comes out, this game is a decent time-filler that'll amuse you for at least a few days. But don't expect anywhere near the polished game-play or level of writing in those games showing up within this one.

Also ich habe das Spiel um die 12 Stunden und die Story fertig gespielt.

Positiv:
- Endlich hat der Spieler mal ein paar Emotionen :D
- Kein Tauschen von Werkzeugen mehr, alles automatisch wenn man den Dinge anklickt die man bearbeiten will
- Tiere sind leichter zu pflegen/füttern
- Die kleinen Aufgaben für die Dorfbewohner, spielst zwar Laufbursche aber kriegst was dafür und man kann sich schneller mit denen anfreunden
-man kriegt das was man will, ein Farm Spiel
- bringt Spaß die Stadt aufzubauen
- leicher herauszufinden was die Bewohner mögen wegen ihren sehr ausgeprägten Vorlieben
- bei Events kannst du trotzdem einkaufen
- die Bewohner sind viel länger wach also mehr Chancen die zu treffen

Negativ
- kurze und langweilige Story
- Die Aufgaben für die Story sind einfach farblos
- Die Mine...gott diese Musik hat mich psychisch einfach fertig gemacht, davon abgesehen das auch keine Musik wechselt, sondern immer die gleiche Fröhliche Musik läuft die einen sagt ""Hey bringt dir das Graben von jedem cm, damit du die Leiter finden kannst, Spaß?"" völlig der Horror
- Man kriegt viiiiel zu schnell Geld, am Anfang fischen, damit du Ore verarbeiten kannst und fertig
- Wo ist bitte meine Traverne? :c 
- Kein Kalender, kein Fernsehr, man wird ein Tag davor informiert
- Events wo du mit jemanden weggehst, wird zwar paar Tage vorher bescheid gegeben, aber du bist immer alleine mit denen heißt die anderen Dorfbewohner siehst du nicht, zerstört das Event und das Gemeinsame treffen des Dorfes 
- Was immer ein Herz war um zu sehen wie gut du dich mit den Dorfbewohnern verstehst ist nu eine Note aus meiner Sicht echt mega unschön
- Viel zu wenig Dorfbewohner + Auswahl, man hat halt einfach 5 männliche Möglichkeiten, 1. verrückter der auf Blumen mega abfährt und ohne nicht könnte sein Lebensinhalt, 2. verrückter der auf Fisch steht und immer umfällt wenn er Hunger hat, 3. verrückter der auf Tiere steht, 4. Verrückter Magier der sich immer mit der anderen prügeln muss, 5. Verrückter Magier der mehr als 100 Jahre alt ist, also nicht die beste Wahl xD
- Eintönig man kann keine Kleidung, keine andere Frisur/Haarfarbe haben, Möbel oder deren gleichen kaufen, sowas wie ein Kühlschrank etc kriegt man nur wenn man Upgradet, allgemein wird alles nur durch Geld geregelt
- Hund + Pferd muss man kaufen und man kann sich keine Farbe aussuchen 
- Man kann keine Ringe oder Amulete mehr finden/craften
- nicht Tastatur freundlich (hab kein Kontroller und wollte dafür auch keinen kaufen ^^)
- man muss viel alleine erraten wie das und das geht (oder ich bin einfach dumm xD)
- finde die Größenunterschiede hässlich...das man so groß wie ein Baum ist muss nu wirklich nicht sein xD
- das Wellnessbad was dafür sorgt das du Energie bekommst dauert 100 Jahre, also lohnt sich mehr Brot zu kaufen, weil du eh genug Geld hast
- Die Tiere essen immer am Morgen also musst du warten bis die fertig sind...
- Das Pferd musst du jedes mal wieder zur Scheune bringen sonst ist es beleigt und kannst darauf nicht reiten, anstatt das es von selber nachhause läuft
- Upgraden der Werkzeuge..ich habe keine Ahnung wieso man dafür Blumen braucht die nur in einer Gewissen Seson wachsen...wieso Blumen für ein Upgrade für ein Hammer? O.o

Ich muss sagen dieser Harvest Moon Teil ist eine Enttäuschung und fühlt sich eher an als wäre das Spiel noch nicht fertig.
Klar man bekommt das was man will. Farmen, Tiere und Liebe, aber ich habe weitaus besseres erwartet, da sie wirklich schöne Spiele hatten. Leider werden ihre Spiele mehr und mehr so als wollten sie nur Geld damit verdienen wollen ohne mal auf die Ideen der Fans einzugehen. 
Auch wenn ich 12 Stunden gespielt habe, was bedeutet das es ja nicht so schlecht sein kann, finde ich das eine schwache Leistung immerhin ist Harvest Moon mehr als nur Geld und farmen.
Events wo man alle Dorfbewohner trifft, Leute mehr kennen zu lernen, darauf scharf ist die Minie durch zu machen ohne das die Ohren völlig vergewaltigt werden, Spaß daran hat neues zu entdecken und und und
Mir fehlt das gute alte Harvest Moon Mineral Down, da war mehr Liebe zum Detai drin.

Also ich kann es für große Harvest Moon Fans nicht empfehlen, die (wie ich) besseres gewohnt ist, besonders nach Stardew Valley.
Sonst die noch nicht viel  Erfahrung gemacht haben ist es in Ordnung.
Nicht das ich es komplett hassen würde, aber wie gesagt bin besseres von den Machern von Harvest Moon gewöhnt.^^",1514888800,1514889497,False,18,2,0.71375119686126709,1,True,False,False,False,,,

1. You cant Auto Water, and the game gives you an I N S A N E amount farm land to use. im talking there are about 10000 tiles you can plant on, and thats a low ball estimate. Watering is such a tedious part of the game , and it extremely detracts from the game at virtually every juncture. 
2. Farming is largely pointless. You will only ever farm for Food/feed supplies (fodder corn) and the oddball flowers to upgrade your tools. 
3. Mining is too profitable. one day in a mine can turn more profit than an entire month of Cropping 300 tiles(this takes all day to water until you get the max level watering can). This game basically becomes Mining Moon instead of harvest moon.

The characters have good design but they are very bland and their dialogues hardly change throughout the story.

The mission system is heavy and unnecessarily complicated, and do not talk about cooking. The recipes are messy and it is difficult to find one, the most common ingredients are the most complicated to find when you have your livestok with high affection and that they give you a single random item only makes the game more tedious.

The difference between the simple and the blessed tools is almost none, specially the fishing rod. Is frustrating if we think all that it costs to obtain it. 10 times I have gone fishing only one or none gives me more than one fish.

The game looked promising but it is too simple in some things and ridiculously complicated in what should be simple. I finished it in 2 days and until now I do not see that it offers me too many things to continue playing it.

Not worth the money you pay for it, in the Harvest moon in addition to the systems the characters are the most important of the plot and should have more soul and personality than this.

Passable for casual players or small children, but I do not recommend it for fans of Harvest moon or Story of Seasons.

Sólo estoy decepcionada de este juego. Los personajes tienen buen diseño pero son muy sosos y sus dialogos apenas cambian a lo largo de la historia. 

El sistema de misiones es pesado e inecesariamente complicado, ni se hable de cocinar. Las recetas estan desordenadas y es dificil buscar una, los ingredientes mas comunes son los mas complicados de encontrar cuando tienes a tu ganado con afecto alto y eso que te den un solo item random solo hace el juego mas tedioso.

La diferencia entre las herramientas simples y la bendita es casi ninguna, en especial la caña de pescar, y eso es frustrante si tomamos en cuenta todo lo que cuesta conseguirla. De 10 veces que he ido a pescar solo una o ninguna me da mas de un pez.

El juego se veia prometedor pero es demasiado simple en unas cosas y ridiculamente complicado en lo que deberia ser sencillo. Me lo termine en 2 dias y hasta ahora no veo que me ofrezca demasiadas cosas para continuar jugandolo.

No vale la pena el dinero que pague por el, en los Harvest moon ademas de los sistemas los personajes son lo mas importante de la trama y deberian tener mas alma y personalidad que esto.

I still play that first game at least once a year because it is my most favourite game. 

I agree that it is good for a company to expand and try new things- they can not just expect people to keep buying the same games over and over and not provide something new. But something big is lost in the games they have been making the last few years. I don't feel like I am playing a Harvest Moon game- I think A New Beginning was the last title that I felt I was playing a true Harvest Moon game.
Since then, it has felt like every other game has been a semi-good parody.

However, I feel like in comparison to some of the lesser titles (The Lost valley), Light of Hope is a step in the right direction... But there is still such a way to go.

Light of Hope looks like it was made in an RPG maker and I have a tiny bit of experience with using those to know that the easiest part of using an RPG maker is the design- placing the tiles. But whoever made this map clearly left their deadline to the last minute and did a passing-grade job. For example, the pathway on your farm- I can tell that its meant to appear as this faded-stone path but it actually is just blocks dotted in random places and its horrible to look at. It is really very simple but highly effective to fade the edges of the tiles to get this effect because this is otherwise a very poor and downright lazy job.

A more personal opinion I also have, which others may not agree with, is the colour- everything is far too brightly coloured that it turns childish. The whole game in fact feels more like it is designed for a child but I also believe that the bulk of the Harvest Moon fanbase is adults but we are not really being acknowledged. 

A big problem with the game is how quickly you can finish it and how boring each day can be. Back in the day, you would have to collect all 101 sprites, or put some real hard work into restoring the town- work that would take in-game years. In Light of Hope I am practically going to bed by 11am because thats it- I've watered my crops, I've fed my animals, I have said hi to the person I like and that is it for the day. The older harvest moon games- you could be spending most of your day trying to finish all your tasks and still be struggling to finish it all. That is what is so great- you are so busy! You feel immersed in the game. Light of Hope is too easy and too boring.

To put it plainly- I don't care much about the characters in this game. I don't feel like I know them and they are not interesting enough for me to want to know them. Their 3D designs when you speak to them are ugly- I am a big fan of the more anime-style you used to do because now they look like children and that doesnt really make me what to marry and start a family with them... If anything it's creepy.  I also miss how in the older games, the villagers would walk around and had a schedule- they didn't just appear magically somewhere and remain stood until bedtime. They used to have their own favourite spots to visit and spend time, based on their personalities. They even had different dialog depending on where they were at the time and also depending on how good of friends you were. With your love interests, you had to work hard to win them over and there was also competition- for each love interest there was a rival- someone who also cared for them and could end up marrying them if you werent careful.

Another wonderful but simple thing I miss about Harvest Moon are the little things- like how you could find treasure in excavation site, cursed items and tools, random events between characters (that you can only come across if you meet very specific criteria), hidden mini games, even hidden mermaids!

One main thing that frustrates me about Light of Hope- you have a ridiculous amount of farm space but you cant build anything on it? There are pre-built barns and windmill and this is it. You can't add anything else. Do you really think I need all this land? It would be good if we could place beehives like in A New Beginning, or greenhouses, a pond, maker sheds, a mushroom house... It is just a waste of a lot of land and it again makes me revert back to my previous point of this being designed lazily. 
I also wish we could customise our house and farm more. Maybe even the character. 

Some aspects of this game that I do enjoy is the mutation of crops and flowers- I think that is a fun idea. And the bell to get animals in and out of the barns... I thought I would have more to say on good things to be honest.

In comparison to their counterparts, Marvellous: Story of Seasons and Chuckefish's Stardew Valley, HM:Light of Hope does not meet the expectation bar. In fact, it falls very... very short. This is disheartening but perhaps my expectations were too high.

This re-iteration does not add anything new, even the townsfolk are copied and pasted from prior installments. There is a lack of festivals, stale dialogue, and the pacing is terrible. I beat the game in under 24 hours mid-summer year 1. 
If you are looking for something new, this does not deliver. If you are interested in something VERY familiar to mindlessly occupy your time, this will serve that purpose.

Yet there are some nice game mechanic additions that I have to acknowledge Natsume for; the algorithm for tending to your crop fields and caring for animals is a HUGE time-saver and you now do not have to open a menu and equip tools manually or even use the quick bar to fully till, water, and fertizle crops. This makes the tedious tasks and repitition fly by so you can do more in a day - the only problem, is that there's nothing really to do during the day...

As such, that addition does not make up for the fact that the game is just overall boring and too simplistic/easy. If you have not yet played Stardew Valley or SoS, give those a go first; if you've played them and are looking for a quick fix to satisfy a farming itch - then this one will do just that but dont' expect anything more. 
Also as an aside, I played 4 hours of HM and then 4 hours of SoS: trio of towns back to back to better judge, and I stopped HM after 24 hours and have decided to replay SoS instead - if that is any indicator as to how boring this game has become. 

TLDR: no innovation or creativity, stale gameplay, but good controls. 
SoS and Stardew valley have more to do, so buy those first.

Veterans and Rune Factory fans will be extremely let down. I have to agree with other reviews when they say it is definitely lacking when compared to previous HM games. Light of hope is charming, yet I feel it is a bit empty and monotonous at times. The characters are likeable but events with them seem a bit short, pointless, lacking content and emotion. I don't really feel any personal investment in any of the people in town. At one point I completely forgot the name of one of the lesser mentioned female characters so I had to run around talking to everyone to figure out who she was. Name visibility when approaching characters could've also shortened the time frame. The clock runs way too fast as it is. 

Once you get past the initial story line, it is just a bunch of endless requests and mining to get money. Farming doesn't yield as much money as mining gems and fishing (if you get the better bait and pole). Towards the end I was mostly farming for animal food, wheat and new plants. The different quality products you get from your animals is wonderful but it is infuriating having to spend almost an entire game year to get a specific type of wool to progress the storyline, just because I treat my sheep too good and I keep getting the higher tiers. I literally had to earn money to buy a new sheep, wait for him to grow up, and neglect him for a bit to get this. I feel like I am being penalized for treating my animals too well. Forget it if you need to earn several wool or donkey fur for a request because those 4 have to be of the exact same quality for the game to see it as the item needed, there is no mixing and matching. 

This annoyance also brings me to the cooking system, it works the same way as the requests. If you need 5 cheese for a dish it has to be the SAME EXACT quality. I had 12 cheese all of varying qualities (these take 3 milk to make each) and about 10 milks of different qualities and could not make a dish. I ended up having to go buy some from Bastien just to finish the request. Eventually I started selling these because they just took up space in my fridge. It took entirely too long to actually do anything with them. Also the 10 types of each recipe for varying quality ingredients was messy and chaotic looking. I would have 10 recipes but 50 items on my recipe book. For example: there was pizza toast, excellent pizza toast, superb pizza toast, etc. This was the same for just about every recipe.  It would be nice to have one of these recipes listed and have the option in the menu to increase the quality. It seems a bit redundant and unnecessary to have so many versions.

 BAG SPACE, there is no number or indicator to let you know the bag is getting full......this is very frustrating when I finally found a soul gem or that one time I won a contest and had no bag space.... the items just vanished forever into the abyss. Thanks...

CALENDAR, it would be nice to know the birthdays and events without the help of the little harvest fairy. Harvest fairy  only lets you know about events 5 days in advance. If you get caught up or carried away it is easy to forget. 

The witch and wizard that let you know hints, weather, likes and dislikes are never in their homes. I can also never find them on the map. I eventually just stopped looking for them until I had a request. I was grateful I didn't choose one of them as a love interest, it would've been near impossible. 

STORAGE, storage bins would be amazing. Especially for a psychotic organizer like me. Using the same storage for all my seeds, flowers, ores etc is a bit messy. 

Seeing what is in the shipping container would also be awesome. It would be nice to see how much I am making and what items are in there. Also to take them out if I accidentally put something in that is needed for a request. 

It would be wonderful if the npc and animals names hovered over them as you selected or approached so I can tell who they are. When you look in the book it doesn't differentiate between the different types of cows, donkeys and chickens. It shows them all with the same exact default image. 

Leveling up when mining, farming, fishing, ecetera feature would be amazing too. I feel like my character has spent so much time doing these activities and still has as much stamina as when they first started. It's a bit frustrating having to load up on food just to get down 5 levels in the mine when I have the best equipment. 

I know I have done nothing but complain and criticize, but I guess I have been spoiled by the prior games and my expectations were a bit too high. I guess I also miss the Rune Factory series a bit and was looking for my fix, this is perhaps where I went wrong. I am aware that this company is different from the one that created the original games, but I don't feel that is any excuse to bastardize the series. If you are testing the waters, great. But using the HM name to get attention for something new and completely different is ultimately only going to lead to disappointment and harsh criticism for/from the fans. It sets an expectation that obviously had no intention of being met. 

TLDR: If you are new to the series I recommend this whole-heartedly. If you are looking to have the same experience as you got from prior HM games this may have you ripping your hair out at the unnecessary disorganization and lack of variety and content, that you have come to expect. 

I have spent a lot of time on this game and can't bring myself to not recommend it. I have enjoyed the time I played, but the little nuances have started to grate on me and I find myself sadly losing interest.",1512059271,1512059363,True,54,2,0.80194169282913208,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Was mir wie in jedem Harvest Moon fehlt sind Schweine. Ich weiß nicht ob das Spiel vorgaukeln soll, dass keine Tiere getötet werden abgesehen von Fischen....

Positiv finde ich auch die neue Tastatur belegung, vorher fühlte es sich oft an als würde man das Spiel über einen virtuellen Gameboy spielen.

Negativ beim Kochen könnte man gerne wieder diese Trennung rein machen wie bei den anderen Spielen. Also Fischgerichte, Nachspiesen, Getränke, Salate und C.o.

สรุปคะแนน 9/10 

เป็นเกมที่ไม่เหมาะกับทุกคน และคนละสไตล์กับ Stardew ไปคนละทาง กล่าวคือ เกม Stardew จะใหญ่กว่า และค่อนข้างไปในแนว Sand Boxes แต่เกม Harvest Moon จะเป็นแนว RPG

ตัวเกมมีเป้าหมายชัดเจนกว่าแต่ละขั้นต้องทำอะไร และมีแต่เควสช่วยบังคับให้ว่าเรารู้ว่าต้องทำอะไร ปลูกอะไร หาอะไรต่อ แต่ก็จะบอกอ้อมๆ ไม่ได้ถึงจะกับว่าไปขุดสิ แค่บอกว่าชาวบ้านอยากได้อันนี้ หามาที หามายังไงไม่รู้นะ

ข้อดีของเกม 
- เนื้อเรื่องถือว่าโอเค
- เอาใจใส่เรื่องตัวละคร บทพูด ปฏิสัมพันธ์ระหว่างตัวละคร ถ้าคุณเหนื่อยบทพูดก็จะเปลี่ยน ทำเควสสำเร็จบทพูดก็จะเปลี่ยน หรือถ้าเราไม่ทำเควสหลักสักที ชาวบ้านก็จะช่วยแนะนำให้ไม่ลืม 
- มี Event เลือกคำตอบ แบบ Stardew เวลาที่ความสัมพันธ์ก็จะมีเรื่องน่ารักๆ ขำๆ ไป
- ตัวละครค่อนข้างมีนิสัยเอกลักษณ์ จดจำได้ง่าย และมีเสน่ห์เป็นของตัวเองดี
- การใช้งานเครื่องมือ ง่ายถึงขั้นสุดๆ เป็นจุดที่ชอบที่สุดและ ไม่ต้องเสียเวลามาสลับเครื่องมือให้วุ่นวายเสียเวลา เกมออโต้ให้หมด 
- อีกจุดที่ชอบมากเป็นพิเศษ คือ ปลูกผักแบบไม่ต้องสนใจฤดูกาลได้ (แต่ต้องมาใส่ปุ๋ยนะ) คือเป็นปัญหาของเกม Stardew มาก ต้องที่มานับวัน พอเปลี่ยนฤดูก็ตายหมด หรือต้องรอข้ามปีกว่าจะปลูกพืชบางชนิดได้ อันนี้คืออยากปลูก แกก็ปลูกไปสิ ไม่อยากให้ผักตายก็ใส่ปุ๋ย ถ้าลืมใส่ แล้วผักตายก็ปิดเกมเปิดใหม่ มาใส่ปุ๋ยก็จะรอด โหยชีวิตแม่งโคตร Happy มาก 
- ตอนขุดเหมืองให้อารมณ์แบบกำลังเรียนเลข คือขุดไปสักพักก็จะพอเดาจุดได้และว่าจะตรงไหนจะเจอทางไปต่อ ไม่ต้องมาเสียเวลาขุดทั้งแมพ

ข้อเสีย
- ภาพไม่สวย ดูเด็กไปหน่อย แต่เอาจริงๆ เล่นสัก 5 ชมก็จะเล่นชินกับมันได้ แล้วก็คิดว่าสาวในเรื่องน่ารักทุกคน ผู้ชายก็เท่ ไม่ต้องมา MOD แบบ Stardew ด้วย
- อีเวนต์แม่งน้อยมาก แต่ตัดจบมาก


สรุปสุดท้าย เกมดี แต่ไม่เหมาะกับคนที่ชอบคิดเยอะ หรือชอบความอิสระแบบเกม Sand Boxes ซึ่งมันไม่ใช่ไง มันเกม RPG ชัดๆ เป็นเกมเล่นง่ายๆ คือเล่นแล้วรู้สึกว่าเออเกมแม่งต้องแบบนี้และ ไม่ต้องทำอะไรยุ่งยาก คิดมาก",1511899309,1511899309,True,5,0,0.566071093082427979,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Despite its change in graphics it is enthralling on a whole new level with the same existing gameplay that kept me going for hours on end when it first appeared several years ago.

There are a lot of games that have been derived, improved, and expanded on from this one but all owe Harvest Moon a full and complete bottle of homage in celebration of its come back especially finally being here on steam.

I admit I was a bit hesitant about this one at first but after playing it for awhile it feels like a well welcomed addition to the entire Harvest Moon Game series with all the fun of the originals and more.

 I just hope it stays updated which so far it seems like it with some recent fixes and improvements and that some neat fun cool things are added over time to keep the game going more even if it's additional DLC I would gladly get.

At least A New Beginning looked a lot prettier and felt a lot smoother. I love Harvest Moon and I've played just about all of them as much as I could to some sort of end. This doesn't really feel like a Harvest Moon game.

Firstly, I hate the graphics. The art style is bland and it doesn't look as if they tried very hard on any of it, almost like they threw assets together rather than create a world. Any immersion I might have had is already almost completely lost on this. It reminds me of those free flash games or something you can play on Facebook. The first word that comes to mind when I see it is ""cheap"". A Wonderful Life looks leagues better and that was on the Gamecube. I don't see any excuses here.

Secondly, nothing at all thus far has pulled me in or interested me. The characters are plain and the story seems rather shallow. It already wants you to invest your time and energy into helping people you hardly know or care about, whereas, in most other Harvest Moon games, it seemed to leave you alone for a little while with your farm and the people, so you could get to know them and the area before throwing you into any kind of plot involving the Harvest Sprites or any sort of conflict, even if it was previously mentioned.

It's too easy. In previous Harvest Moon games, they introduced some interesting things, even if they were different variations of asects from other games, it still worked. Now, in the very beginning it gives you the possibility of infinite cabbage seeds and clearing most of the land without consequence. I read that it was all intentional and that ""hard work pays off as with every Harvest Moon"" from one of the people working for the game. It isn't hard work at all. What's the point if I can do all of this without consequence within the first couple days in the game?

This game is on the PC but a lot of the mechanics and even the button hints on the screen scream controller. It doesn't tell you to click the right mouse button but if you want to open your bag to hit X on the controller. Why not just make a game for the console?
My guess on that one is that putting it on Steam was an excuse for them to be lazy and make money off of yet another ""Harvest Moon"" game. And lazy they were.

There's graphical glitches, awkward controls, lack of explanation, poor graphics, bland characters, boring plot, all for a price I wouldn't pay again for it, not in a million years.
I'm incredibly disappointed since I've seen such wonderful Harvest Moon games prior to this one. First PC game is a bust.
Don't waste your money. If I can get a refund, I plan too.

-กระเป๋า กว้างใหญ่ เก็บของได้เยอะ แต่คุณภาพ และชนิด ของในเกมก็เยอะตามทำให้เมื่อเล่นไปนานๆ ของจะเต็มจนน่ารำคาญ 
-การทำฟาร์ม ดีตรงที่ไม่ต้องเลือกเครื่องมือ แค่คลิกตัวเกมก็เลือกให้เลยว่าจะ รดน้ำใส่ปุ๋ย บลาๆ สะดวกดี และเก็บผลผลิตได้ครั้งละ 9อัน ไวดี 
แต่ ข้อเสียก็มีคือ ทำอะไรข้ามขั้นไม่ได้ รดน้ำก่อนเก็บเกี่ยวไม่ได้ ทำให้ต้องเดินวนไปมาหลายรอบ 
- มีสัตว์ใหม่ๆ ให้ผลผลิต ที่ภาคอื่นไม่มี  แค่โดยรวมแล้วยังไม่หลากหลาย
.เควสเยอะดี แต่ บางอันก็ทำยาก 
-การตกปลา ตอนแรกๆ ตกยาก แต่ถ้าตกเป้นแล้ว ตก ไปเล่นเว็บ หรือทำอย่างอื่นไป ได้ด้วย พอได้ยินเสียงปลาฮุบเหลือ ค่อยกลับมาจอเกมยังตกทัน
-ข้อเสีย 
-เหมืองขุดยาก (แต่หาเงินได้ดีมาก)
-ไม่มีปฏิทิน ร้านต่างๆ เปิดปิดกี่โมงถ้าไม่ไปดูข้อมูลนอกเกม แทบไม่รู้เลย 
-สิ่งสำคัญเลยคือความโรแมนติก... เหมือนทำเกมมาให้เด็กเล็กๆเล่น แม้แต่ฉาก จูบวันแต่งงานยังเซ็นเซอร์ โถๆ 
ตอนจะแต่งงาน ต้องหาของเยอะ รอนานมากๆ เลย 
ภาคนี้ไม่มีคนช่วยเราทำฟาร์มด้วย (แอนมอลพาเรด สามี+ลูกช่วยทำฟาร์มได้)
-เก็บสัตว์มาเลี้ยงได้แค่แมวอย่างเดียว...

สรุปแล้ว คิดว่ากราฟฟิกปานกลาง ไม่สวยมากไม่ถึงกับดีเยี่ยม สนุกและคุ้มค่าพอสมควร

(Vor dem Lesen sollte beachtet werden, dass ich diese Review freischnauze und ohne weitere Recherchen geschrieben habe, in dem kompletten Text nur meine eigene, subjektive Meinung vertrete und in erster Linie nur eine mehr oder weniger kurze Information über meine Eindrücke zu dem Spiel geben und den Leser unterhalten möchte. Das Spiel ist scheinbar nicht aus dem selben Haus, wie die früheren Harvest Moon Teile, dies wusste ich zum Zeitpunkt des Verfassens meiner Review jedoch noch nicht und wurde eher unfreundlich in der Comment-Section darauf hingewiesen, weshalb künftig jegliche Art von Kommentar zu meinem Review gelöscht wird. Noch einmal: Dies soll nur zur Unterhaltung dienen und meinen eigenen Standpunkt wiedergeben. Jeder der seinen eigenen Senf zu dem Spiel abgeben möchte, kann dies in Form einer eigenen Review gerne tun.)

Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass ich eher der stille Genießer bin und nie Reviews schreibe: Trommelwirbel bitte. Hier kommt mein erstes Review, like... ever.

Harvest Moon DS - Das Spiel mit dem alles begann, alles steht und alles fällt. Viele Leute denken, mit dem Kauf des neuen Teils ""Harvest Moon: Light of Hope"" bekommen sie Gelegenheit, sich von der Melancholie und der Nostalgie ihrer Jugend davon tragen zu lassen... Doch warum gibt es dann trotzdem rote Däumchen, in der Review-Section?
(Achtung! Ich meine damit, dass mein EIGENER Hype und nicht die Reihe an sich mit 'Harvest Moon DS' begann. Mir ist bewusst, dass es davor noch andere Teile gab, leider fand ich die jedoch persönlich nie annähernd so gut wie 'Harvest Moon DS'.)

Grund dafür mag zum einen die Tatsache sein, dass viele nicht bedenken, dass sich über Jahre die Zielgruppen ändern, Spiele sich entwickeln, neue Partner dazu kommen und alte abspringen und es nie ein Spiel zwei mal geben wird und nie ein Spiel so gut oder so schlecht wie das vorherige sein kann - Denn genauso wie die Menschen, die diese Spiele erschaffen oder sie spielen, ist jedes Spiel ein Unikat und unterscheidet sich von den anderen. Liege ich im Recht? Ich hoffe doch.

Wer Fan der ""Harvest Moon""-Reihe ist, wird bereits die Entwicklung mitbekommen haben. Mit den letzten Teilen wurde die Grafik zwar immer moderner, doch auch kindgerechter, da - genauso wie bei Pokemon - neue Generationen nachrücken, die nun die neueren Teile unserer alten Kindheits-Helden als ihren Einstieg in die Gaming-Welt nehmen.

Ich gebe zu, die Grafik ist in diesem Teil ein negativer Aspekt. Mir gefällt sie nicht, das ist eine subjektive Meinung und damit bin ich nicht alleine. Aber wie war es denn auch anders zu erwarten, von einem Spiel, welches es normalerweise nur als Handheld gibt? Berichtigt micht, wenn ich dies nun sage, aber: Betrachtet man das Spiel einmal genauer, stellt es sich kleiner und auf einem DS-Bildschirm vor, so ist die Grafik schon weniger schlimm. Und wenn man nun den Ursprungspunkt des Spiels bedenkt... könnte man diesen vielleicht als Entschuldigung nehmen. Vielleicht. Zusätzlich zu der bereits erwähnten ""Verkindlichung"" natürlich. 

Aber diesen Punkt mal beiseite. Verglichen mit den letzten neu-veröffentlichten ""Harvest Moon""-Teilen hat dieser endlich wieder eine Story, an der man gefallen finden kann, wenn man offen ist, dem Spiel eine Chance gibt und vielleicht lange genug die Augen zusammenkneift, bis man sich an die Grafik gewöhnt hat. Unsere Erntewichtel sind zurück, mit altbewährten Namen aus dem ""Harvest Moon DS""-Teil, und somit auch die Erntegöttin - und ihr Pervert-Nosebleed-Väterchen. Oder Ehemann. Who knows.

Aber auch sonst ist alles beim Alten: Pflanzen anbauen, Tiere hüten, Katzen zähmen, Hunde halten, eine Mine erkunden, die große Liebe finden, heiraten und ein Kind zur Welt bringen. Letzteres sind Punkte, die auch auf mich noch zukommen werden und ich bin sehr gespannt, inwiefern sie mich catchen werden.

Nostalgie pur, nicht wahr? Auch die Musik gibt den gewissen ""Harvest Moon""-Flair wieder. Jedoch muss ich zugeben, dass ich sie nur leise als kleines Hintergrund-Tüdelü vernehme und sie drastisch von Spotify übertönt wird. Aber ich hab mir das Spiel auch nicht wegen der Musik gekauft, verstanden?

Nein, gekauft habe ich dieses Spiel auch aus einem anderen Punkt, der mich leider bisher auch ein wenig (!) wie bestellt und nicht abgeholt im Regen stehen lässt: Charaktertiefe. Bisweilen suche ich verzweifelt nach einem Charakter, der mich so richtig catcht. Den ich mag und heiraten will und mit dem ich gerne rede. Ich habe da so meine Lieblinge, klar. Aber andere Charaktere sind wiederum einfach nur NPCs. Leere Hüllen, die nichts zu erzählen haben. Aber vielleicht geht das auch nur mir so. Subjektive Meinung - ihr erinnert euch?

Um mal von dem zweiten negativen Aspekt unter hunderten von positiven abzulassen:
Wir haben uns entwickelt. Ja, richtig. Auf einmal können Pflanzen mutieren und somit in neuen Farben erstrahlen, die Enzyklopädie erweitern und das Achievement-Hunting auf Vordermann bringen. Das Spiel ist mal wieder ein wenig - wie wollen wir es am besten nennen? - komplex, auch wenn man keine hunderte von Erntewichteln finden muss um eine versteinerte Erntegöttin wieder in ihren Normalzustand zu befördern und dann abzuschleppen. Die Arbeit in der Mine ist zum ersten Mal seit Langem wieder essentiell für das Spiel, die wohl beste Geldquelle die man haben kann... und es macht Spaß! Auch kommen nach dem End-Game neue Tiere hinzu und - wohl das Beste von allem - man wird von den Machern erhört und es gibt tatsächlich Patches. Patches? Patches! 

Ihr seht, das Spiel hat sich entwickelt und es ist noch nicht vorbei. Schnuppert doch einfach mal rein, egal ob ihr neu in der Reihe seid (an dieser Stelle: Tut mir leid, dass ich meine Zielgruppe auf alte Hasen gerichtet habe) oder nicht: Mit zusammengekniffenen Augen und viel Offenheit oder Liebe für ""Harvest Moon"" wird dieses Spiel euch viele schöne Stunden bescheren.",1511472471,1542995360,True,50,9,0.661996424198150635,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This franchise was my all-time favorite game when I was still playing on my GBA and after that my Nintendo DS. I mean, I started playing Stardew Valley because of HM.

Comparing with games such as Stardew Valley or World's Dawn there are a few things I am missing (for example, something simple as a calender where I can find the birthdays and events). However since I have only just started playing and the game has only just been released I'll give this the benefit of the doubt and won't let this weigh too heavily when forming my opinion.

In fact, while writing this review there is only one thing I don't like about the game and that's the art style. The design of the characters (especially up close) I find more befitting a Nintendo console such as the 3DS or the Wii. But honestly, it's not something that bothers me a lot. I just prefer an art style either like several visual novels have (more anime-style) or like some H.O.-games have (most Eipix games). I am sure there are people who actually prefer the art style of HM.

All in all, I am looking forward to the future. How the game will develop further, how much effort the developers will put in this game now that it's released.

I first thought it was a limitation of the Tech, but now I'm just wondering if they're lazy.

For example, it's great that you can walk over crops, but you can't walk over weeds??? In the GBA (Mineral Town) version, grass would grow back after the animals ate it, but in this one you have to CONSTANTLY: till, plant, water, repeat. IT'S GRASS. Why can't the animals eat weeds?? Seriously, weeds (and rocks) don't grow that fast.

They got rid of pushing the animals (one-by-one), but instead of a bell; why not an open door concept? When your barn door is open: the animals can roam in and out (morning/evening). Cows sleep outside all the time with no problems. Keep the sick mechanic, but only when you leave the animals out when it's raining/hurricane. Rushing to get them in the barn and closing the door can be a thing. I liked the Gamecube version where you had a pasture for animals. This world is big enough, but there's no pasture?

This game would be great if, when you expanded (built the bridges), you could turn that land into a grazing pasture or something. It's a cheap way of turning expansion into a reward.

More expansion options. I get all this cash, but nothing to spend it on. There should be: Seeders, Automatic milkers, Auto feeders, SPRINKLERS, seed hybrid machines (I couldn't figure out the Gamecube version. Don't make it that complicated. A minigame or simply waiting is sufficient to get new seeds) etc. You should still have to interface with something everyday, but getting these toys will allow you to spend more time expanding the farm or romancing locals. As it is, You only have enough Time/energy for small gardens here or there even after maxed out everything.

The game should start out like chipping at a mountain with a toothpick, but as time goes by and the more work/effort you do the more utilities you should get. Like in real life. I'm not talking about a combine. I'm talking about simple tools for the animals.

There should be family things. Picnics, etc. IDK. Something. Ok, I'm married. Now what?

The wife should help and depending upon who you choose (lazy, stubborn, thrifty, etc) should determine what they do around the house. One can be good at farm work. One that doesn't do anything except spend your money. One that cooks all the time. One that gets discounts at the store. Etc. Have them do something!

Houses/building should be real. We have the tech. Why isn't there an upstairs? Why are all the adults single? The 90s are over. It doesn't have to be fancy, but something that doesn't feel like a shed.

Befriending the sprites should also reward something. Like randomly upgrading quality of crops/animal products. Finding and giving rare foods/minerals. There's a sprite for every chore, but all I see them doing is getting in the way.

The chicken coop. Why not have an attache where the chickens can walk and roam and feed outside? This should be an upgrade option for the coop. You don't need this huge building for chickens. I lift their lid (I have chickens in real life) and grab the eggs. There's a trough I pour feed in. Chickens NATURALLY seek shelter at night. I just make sure the feed is full, but with the attache (it's a fenced in area around the coop) feeds costs are now nill. The Doc NEEDS that for an building option.

I've been wanting Natsume to fix these issues for decades, and I'm hoping they do that in the next game (and the graphics should be Gamecube or better quality). I know Harvest Moon is not about the graphics, but in this day and age it just feels lazy.",1511412431,1511412811,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

At 25 hours I feel like I had barely scratched the surface of the content that is available in this game. It’s fun, relaxing, and I personally LOVE the graphics. I am a diehard harvest moon fan and must say that this game can best be compared to the design of both harvest moon: magical melody and Stardew Valley. That being said there’s nothing wrong with Stardew Valley and I’ve seen a lot of people suggesting it rather than buying this game as its $15 cheaper. If you aren’t a harvest moon fan and love indie games than I HIGHLY SUGGEST you buy Stardew Valley instead. Personally, I’ve played harvest moon all my life. I’m currently 22 years old and I’ve been playing harvest moon games since I was six or seven so of course I’m going to be very biased to loving this game, which I do A LOT. Stardew Valley is not appealing to me because it personally does not “feel” like harvest moon. It was mostly an indie graphics problem for me. If you don’t like Stardew Valley because of the graphics than harvest moon: a light of hope is the game for you. It very closely resembles similar graphics to harvest moon: a magical melody and a very similar playstyle. Bottom line that people must understand is that harvest moon and Stardew Valley cannot be compared. They are different in a lot of ways and in my honest option just doesn’t have the same “harvest moon” nostalgic feel. Harvest moon games never had indie graphics and to be honest that is what instantly turned me away from even wanting to try Stardew Valley. That being said the choice is yours! If you’re still interested in learning more about Harvest Moon: Light of Hope, there is a pro/con and changes list below: 
Since this game cannot be compared to Harvest moon: a wonderful life as it is in no way similar I will compare it to harvest moon: magical melody as it seems to adopt the same style. 

Things that have changed since Magical Melody: 

1.	The Map! This is a GREAT CHANGE in my opinion as the map in harvest moon: a light of hope is SO MUCH BETTER! In a magical melody you had to buy different plots from all around the map and it was very very frustrating and almost impossible for you to have multiple farms. In a light of hope they made your farm not only centralized but also having different areas that are attached to your farm that can be unlocked for additional plot space. I LOVE THIS.
2.	I LOVE the story. You’re basically tasked with rebuilding the town. This may turn a lot of people off to the game because it is grindy.. BUT THAT’S WHAT A HARVEST MOON GAME IS. If you don’t like relaxing farming simulators, then this game wont please you.
3.	NO MORE LIMITED BAG SPACE!!! This is the change I have to say I welcomed the most. One of the most frustrating things to me in Magical Melody was having to upgrade my bags and going through them every day to try clear them out. The backpack system in this game is wonderful and it will bring you absolutely no annoyance.
I realize that there are no negative changes listed but once again this is just my opinion and Harvest Moon: Magical Melody is hands down one of my most favorite games ever made. I liked all the changes made to Light of Hope and I truly believe Light of Hope is a superior game. It captures the spirit of a true harvest moon game.

Pros:

1.	I love how you no longer must change out your tools hoe/axe/hammer etc. when farming. This was always something that frustrated me about harvest moon games but that is no longer a problem! You no longer must switch out, but the game automatically knows what tool you want to use. This makes farming smooth and simple and really makes relaxing your top priority. 
2.	The Map
3.	The story 
4.	FREE BAG SPACE!!

Cons:

Given that I really do love this game it was difficult for me to come up with any cons, so I will address some things that other people have been bringing up in reviews. 

1.	Many people may view the lack of customization as a con. I can understand this if you are a Stardew Valley, harvest moon: skytree village, or harvest moon: new beginnings fan. Harvest moon: a wonderful life and harvest moon: a magical melody NEVER had customization and as this game is a 20th anniversary edition I must say I would have been disappointed if it did. 

2.	The cutscenes are a little annoying if you already know what you’re doing because they cannot be skipped. However, once you get through them you never have to go through them again.

To be clear I'm not saying alternatives are bad, they just didn't give me that harvest moon feel when I played it. I was scared because of some of the negative reviews but now that I've played it I can see that this truly does give me the feeling that I used to get when playing harvest moon back in my childhood, and that feeling is losing track of time while I spend hours trying to manage what I want to do next, whether it's focussing on making certain crops or improving relationships with the other characters or upgrading my tools, and the list goes on.

The way this game essentially works is you ""build"" the town first, and then you play. you are meant to acquire certain materials and then use them to repair old buildings around the city in order to bring back the old residents of the town. The game does this in a way to introduce you to new elements one at a time as to not overwhelm you from the get go. For example the first few things you repair just require softwood which can be obtained from many trees, then once you advance a little you will start repairing buildings that require wood + stone and from there on they get more and more complex in order to teach you how to use new tools and such, you will also unlock new areas of the map over time as you progress the main story so you aren't overwhelmed with the big map right out of the gate.

There's a bookshelf in your house that has a tips category that grows as you unlock stuff so it's a good idea to go back and check it every once in a while because otherwise you will most likely miss a lot of information.

Here's what I think based on my experience with other HM games compared to this one.

PROS: Game has a decent story, it's not like the old school HM games where the story is ""save the town by making a lot of money and friends"" it's more like the modern HM games where you try to restore life by completing goals.

Game has a good way of introducing things to you as quickly as you are able to understand them, you progress on your own terms.

Game has a ballanced focus on building your farm as well as rebuilding the town, some things rely on others in order to be improved, like you need to have the blacksmith back in order to upgrade your tools that way you can be more effecient at farming.

Game has a good variety of characters and has the standard friendship builder that shows with music notes when you speak to them.

Game does a good job at allowing you to use tools for their given purposes when looking at a surface that needs that tool instead of picking the tool you want to use and then press an action button.

Game probably has the most extensive list of vegetables out of any HM game I have ever played, this is mainly due to the fact that vegetables can mutate based on various conditions like which soil they are grown on or what other things they are grown near, an example of a mutation would be planting 6 cabbages and then 2 of them end up being red cabbages instead of green ones.

Game does a good job with crops in general. You don't have to worry about sorting them in any specific manner because each seed sows 1 spot so you don't have to make weird crop patterns to effeciently accomodate the most crops, this is also made possible by the fact that all crops have no hit boxes so you can walk right through all of them.

Now here's the negative things,

CONS: Game does a pretty poor job explaining how mining works, if you have ever played HM before then you can probably gather that you go into the mine and hit the crystals with your hammer and then use the hoe to find the ladder, but even after that the gems you find aren't even worth a lot UNTIL you process them at the blacksmith by talking to him during his working hours and tabbing over to his 2nd tab and trading your ores for processed versions of the items you dug up, I figured this out but it took me some time and I know this is a confusing subject because I have seen a lot of people point out in their negative reviews that mining makes no money, in fact mining makes INSANE amounts of money once you figure this out, almost too much money in my opinion.

Game might feel slow or empty to newer players. You pretty much unlock EVERYTHING in this game, you start with practically nothing. So to people who have never played a HM game in their life they might expect to be put in this world filled with NPC's and such but that only happens once you begin rebuilding stuff and getting them to come back. I have seen reviews of people saying there are only like 14 npc's but I am on the 2nd day of summer and there's at least 24 different NPC's that I can converse with so I get the idea that some people might think the game has no content.

Game has (in my opinion) slow progression for tools. In order to upgrade your tools you need to unlock the blacksmith and then pay him 3k (or 10k for fishing rod) per tool + the required materials to upgrade them. Most of the materials are simple to get but for some reason you need a specific type of flower to upgrade them the first time and those flowers don't even become available until you unlock them which might take some time. 

Game could have more interesting NPC's. There's times during certain quests that any NPC involved in that quest will essentially be locked in the same area until you complete that quest and some of the later ones can easily take an in-game week to complete because you must wait for a certain crop to grow. 
I feel like this is kind of a way to remind the player that they need to do the quest and not forget the main objective, but I can't help but feel like they coulda just done that with either an in-game journal that tracks progress or at the very most have one of the harvest sprites remind you whenever you spoke with them, but to have an entire city in a hypnotic state over a blue bird for an entire in game week is kinda rediculous in my mind. 
You can still speak with them and gift them things, but everytime you talk with them they will repeat that same line, which most NPC's do anyways until you get their friendship status to the next milestone, but it's still pretty shoddy in my opinion. The game does however do a decent job of having events happen when you get all the different villagers to certain friendship levels, but other than that it's pretty much the typical HM NPC experience.

Game took away two things that I heavily relied on in old HM games, the T.V & the Calandar. Now the only way to tell the weather for the next day is to get this wizard back into the town and then go to him at his convenience and he can read tomorrows weather for you, on the bright side rain plays a significantly smaller role now because animals hate being left outside overnight REGARDLESS of what the weather will be the next day, plus there's a bell outside the barn that can move the animals from the barn to outside and vice versa.  There are however some new weather types that can hurt crops and such which would be very nice to be able to see a day early on T.V but they did what they did. The removal of the calandar in my opinion was the worst idea, for a game that does a good job of holding your hand through the beginning, now you're expected to remember birthdays and festivals without that aid, yes you can open up the menu and go to villagers, and go through every single one of them to see when their birthdays are, but that takes time and you just end up forgetting anyways. The same thing can be done with festivals but again it's tedious and too time consuming.

Those are the primary topics that I could think of to cover in my current experience with the game, I will be sure to update this review if I run into anything in the future that I feel should be added. My end conclusion is that I love the HM series and this game is no exception, I am having loads of fun with it and it has been keeping me well entertained for a few days now.",1511354012,1511354012,True,18,0,0.646669089794158936,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Even though it's been four years since this happened, I still see a lot of hate being spewed at Natsume--that they ""stole"" the Harvest Moon name, they're ""lying"" to people, and Story of Seasons is the ""real"" Harvest Moon. But a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing, as they say, and there's a lot of facts these people don't know. For anyone reading the topic who doesn't know the story, Harvest Moon games were originally made in Japan and published under the name ""Bokujou Monogatari."" Then Natsume would translate the games into English and release them as Harvest Moon. But after A New Beginning, Marvelous yanked the series from Natsume and began having XSeed, their western publisher, localize the games as Story of Seasons. Then Natsume began internally developing their own Harvest Moon games, consisting of The Lost Valley, Skytree Village, Seeds of Memories, and Light of Hope. So without further ado, here's some facts you may not be aware:

1. Marvelous did not create the Bokujou Monogatari franchise.
Bokujou Monogatari was originally owned by Pack-In Video, which later merged with Victor Entertainment. Marvelous later bought out Victor Entertainment and acquired the rights through that purchase.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack-In-Video
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvelous_Entertainment#Marvelous_Interactive_Inc.

2. Animal Parade is the last real Harvest Moon game.
Many fans commonly cite Animal Parade as one of the best games in the series and a good entry point for newcomers. That's because it was the last game made by the real creator of the series, who left Marvelous after that.

http://harvestmoon.wikia.com/wiki/Yasuhiro_Wada

3. The Marvelous games, including Story of Seasons, were not made by the original development team.
Even after Yasuhiro Wada and most of the pre-Marvelous development team left, Marvelous just hired a new development team and continued making games under the Bokujou Monogatari banner. Compare the credits of an older game in the series like Harvest Moon 64 to Story of Seasons, and you won't find a single name in common. Even when you compare the credits of Animal Parade to the credits of Story of Seasons, you'll barely find any names in common and the two most notable ones (Yoshifumi Hashimoto and Igusa Matsuyama) are only listed under Special Thanks.

http://fogu.com/hm/animal_parade/game_credits.php
http://fogu.com/sos2/game-credits.html

4. If you think Natsume ""lied,"" then Marvelous has lied to you for years.
The Story of Seasons games are made by completely different people compared to beloved classics like Harvest Moon 64. So if you're going to hate on anyone, it should be Marvelous. They changed development teams years before Natsume began developing Harvest Moon titles.

5. Marvelous is to blame for the name change, not Natsume.
Many people think Natsume refused to license the trademark out of spite, but Marvelous actually declined to license it. When Marvelous notified Natsume that they would not be licensing Bokujou Monogatari anymore, they had already made the decision to release the series under a new name.

Hiro Maekawa, President of Natsume: Roughly three years ago, Marvelous notified us that they were not going to license their Bokujo Monogatari series to Natsume anymore, and that they were going to release the series by themselves under a different brand name. Needless to say, we were surprised by this decision. One of the things I am proud of at Natsume is that we have loyal and longstanding relationships based on mutual trust and integrity with our partners, and we never like to see a successful partnership end, especially one that includes a product so near and dear to my own heart.

http://www.siliconera.com/2015/03/18/harvest-moon-beyond-whats-next-natsume/

6. What Marvelous did is considered a jerk move by Japanese standards.
From an American perspective, having XSeed localize the games is completely logical. From a Japanese standpoint, you don't turn your back on a loyal partner. Loyalty is extremely important in Japanese business culture.

""The Japanese, for example, define business ethics in terms of loyalty to their companies, their business networks, and their nation.""

https://hbr.org/1996/09/values-in-tension-ethics-away-from-home

7. If the president of Natsume hadn't gambled on the original Harvest Moon, we probably wouldn't be getting the games.
People thought he was nuts trying to bring the series over, but Hiro Maekawa was positive there was a market for the game and he was right. The series would have likely remained in Japan for decades or even forever if not for him. Maybe you could show a little gratitude by not being a colossal jerk to the company that brought you years of fantastic memories? You don't have to play the new games or like them, just don't be hateful.

8. Natsume spent over 15 years building the Harvest Moon fanbase in the west. 
If you're not familiar with business, you may not understand what a huge deal it is that Natsume spent fifteen years building a market in the west for Harvest Moon. Then Marvelous, the new kid on the block, yanked the series from them and flushed Natsume's years of hard work down the drain. Legit move? Of course, they had the right to do that. But surely you can muster some sympathy for Natsume in this situation.

9. Now do you understand why Natsume began developing their own games?
Marvelous handed them lemons and Natsume made lemonade. Thanks to that, we now have two farming series to play instead of just one, and both are getting better with every new game. Frankly, that's totally awesome for fans. It's fine to prefer one series over the other, but please stop the misguided cries of ""dis isn't REEL Harvest Moon,"" ""Natsume stole the name,"" etc. It's completely pointless to argue that one is ""real"" and the other isn't when there AREN'T any real Harvest Moon games anymore. All we have left are two different companies making games, one under the name ""Story of Seasons"" and the other under ""Harvest Moon.""

10. PS: Natsume's Harvest Moon games are in fact developed in Japan.
For those people who turn their noses up at western-developed games, Natsume's internally developed games are made in Japan and localized for western release.

Original review:
Don't let the haters put you off this game. The graphics might not appeal to everyone, but the gameplay underneath it is solid and improved compared to Skytree Village. Give it a try--you can always get a refund if you don't like it and played less than two hours. I'll try to update this review with more points as I continue playing.

Pros:
-The game has a main story, unlike many modern HM games.

-You don't just gift people, you can do requests for them and they'll give you rewards.

-The crop mutation system is really fun. You can plant crops in different areas besides your farm with different fertilizer, and they'll produce a new crop.

-You don't need to change tools, the game will automatically use the right tool when you press the Action button.

- FoMT mining system, which is way better than mining in SoS. Instead of just smashing a single rock and reloading if you get the wrong thing, you explore a mine and have to find the staircase by digging.

-You can fish nearly anywhere with water instead of just designated fishing spots, and you can see the fish swimming around. They also sell for good money. Bait is also much more useful compared to Skytree Village.

-Music is nice; too bad the soundtrack isn't for sale.

-Cows that give chocolate milk!

-Not just one, but two marriagable wizards!

Cons:
-The main story is fairly short. 

-No new characters compared to Skytree Village

-Characters don't have much dialogue.

This one I see improvements.
HOWEVER; I only feel netural about this game.

I am going to go down starting the dislikes.
Dislikes: 
-Disappearing villagers? Why not let them walk to the next loading screen? Thats so weird and it makes the game feel....like it's missing something?
-Short story line . I almost beat the main quest within ONE season. 
-What happen to the marriage flowers? these quest requst lines are kinda...blah to me.
-No voice overs?
-Not enough content like in Stardew Valley or Story of the Season.
- Price doesn't equal how much care and love they put into this game.
-No feeling on the characters. Not many lines...They kinda say the same things....
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Likes:
- Crops have different types like instead of A+, or a grading system it's more like a more different crop.
-different terrioration this is a big plus because it's different and for each crop it improved and makes it worse. I really like this idea.
-Interesting story line
-the rebuilding process 
-lots of farm land
-this game I can let my future children play because it looks like it's for the younger age kids. Not us adults lol.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neither dislike/like
-No new characters in the past 4-5 years. This is not an issue really, but there is no new creativity.
BUT many havestmoon characters are also reused. Like from NES, Gameboy, SNES, N64, Gameboy advance and some  other come backs. I don't see why some people have problems now? Ann, Popri, Karen, Mary, Elli been in how many Harvestmoon games? See this is for me defending Natsume because they always done it. So they shouldn't be bashed or rated by reused characters.
-graphics I can live with, I see improvements from the moblie apps

This can change.
Do I recommand this game. Yes
Rate: 6/10
Room for improvement
Is it worth 29.99?
No, I would wait for a sale.

Everyone has their thoughts about the game.

Magical Melody though.... <3 I loved that game.

And correct me if I'm wrong but I couldn't find anyway to skip the lengthy tutorial.

Unlocking all the characters feels like a poor excuse for gathering/spending money and materials as you don't get a choice in what you build or any kind of new machanic to set it off from that last game that hadthe player build the town from scratch. It really feels like you never have to really go out of your way and work hard to get anything. Once you know to just keep everything you get from rewards, you're kinda set for the cycle. 
The graphics are not at all appealing from the purely objective (and kinda logical) stand point of; why are the 3d models polygon (it is 2018) and why do most of the pixels look weirdly compressed as though someone saved the PNGs as JPGs. Something else I noticed, especially in winter, was the fact that the floor tiles don't match up when they are put side to side in-game. I'd say the game feels unfinished, but it's more just seems to be designed like an IOS game.
I would get my money back, way too much money for an IOS game, but to find out whether or not you like the game you have to pass the 3 hour refund time. 8 hours in and there's still more basic things to unlock.

1.  There are a few graphical issues and the graphics are certainly not stunning by any means.
2.  The story feels way too easy to complete and the upgrades aren't terribly time consuming either.  
3.  Beyond a few requests and repairs there is no purpose for wool and fur.  There is no tailor to use them at or any clothing to collect.  Some of my favorite games of this genre allowed for buffs if you wore certain items together.
4.  A lot of the content and NPCs are recycled from previous games so it appears there wasn't a lot of effort put into design or development.
5.  There appears to be a lot of little bugs here and there which, again, makes it seem as though not a lot of effort was involved and the game was rushed.


[u]The Pros:[/u]

1.  Being able to work towards achievements and show them off, being this is a PC game on steam, makes the grind feel worth it.
2.  Not having to switch tools constantly was a nice perk.  Tools are also upgradeable which saves on time in-game.
3.  The farming buddy that shows you what is growing and the health of the plant was extremelly helpful in caring properly for crops.
4.  Being able to grow any plant in any season without a greenhouse right off the bat and trying to find mutations makes the game unique to any other competitors in the genre.


[u]Overall[/u]

While it was entertaining and I am still playing it I don't feel the quality is on par with a 20th Anniversary title nor is it worth the current price tag.  So, due to that and in spite of my love for the series, I personally wouldn't feel right recommending it.  However, there is plenty of room for improvement and hopefully we'll see some very nice DLC down the road to add more depth and ramp up the entertaininment value.  For now though, save your money and keep an eye out for sales or improvements before you buy.",1511129869,1511206249,False,35,0,0.686226308345794678,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ขอบอกก่อนว่า ไม่ได้เล่นHMภาคหลังๆที่ลง3dsเลยนะ ดังนั้นจึงไม่รู้จะเปรียบเทียบกับอะไรดี

เนื้อเรื่อง เรามาติดเกาะโทรมๆที่แทบไม่มีคนอยู่ เพราะที่เกาะเคยเกิดพายุหนักพัดบ้านเรือนเสียหาย ประภาคารก็ไม่มีแสงซ่อมไงก็ไม่สำเร็จ เกาะทรุมโทรมลงเรื่อยๆ ไม่รู้เพราะอะไรดลใจเราตัดสินใจจะอยู่ที่นี่ จึงต้องมาฟื้นฟูเกาะ ซ่อมบ้านเรือนให้คนกลับมาอยู่และซ่อมประภาคารให้กลับมาใช้ได้ดังเดิม

ตัวเกมเหมือนrpgแบบปลูกผัก คือมีเควสหลักฟื้นฟูเกาะ และเควสย่อยๆจากชาวเมือง มีแผนที่หลากหลายที่ต้องใช้ของในการปลด 

ระบบต่างๆเปลี่ยนไปจะHMสมัยก่อนๆเยอะ เราชอบนะดูมีมิติดี
เช่น ขายของกับsamได้ทุกชนิดแต่ราคากลางๆ แต่ถ้าขายดอกไม้ที่ร้านดอกไม้หรือขายวัตถุดิบที่ร้านอาหารจะได้ราคาดีขึ้น

sam ไม่ได้ประจำอยู่ที่ร้าน บางวันอยู่ในฟาร์มเรา บางวันก็ไปอยู่บนเขา

หรือผักบางชนิดต้องปลูกในดินเฉพาะ

ภาคนี้ไม่มีปฏิทิน ร้องไห้หนักมาก

ไม่มีทีวีนะ อยากรู้สภาพอากาศต้องไปหาพ่อมดฝึกหัดให้ทำนายให้

ตัวละครที่จีบได้ หนุ่มๆน่ารักดี ให้ผ่าน ปล.ทำไมถึงจีบไมเคิลไม่ได้ เด็กแล้วไง สงสารคนเล่นสายโชตะหน่อย โฮฮฮฮ

เรื่องภาพเรามาตัวละครดูสูงเก้งก้างไปหน่อย แต่พวกพื้นหลังนี่ ok เลย ปกติถ้ากราฟฟิกมีพวก 3D เราจะปวดตาแต่นี่เล่นได้ยาวๆ

สรุปว่าเราให้ผ่าน รสนิยมแต่ละคนไม่เหมือนกัน มีคนชอบก็ต้องมีคนไม่ชอบ

ส่วนราคา 300กว่านี่ก็ไม่แพงนะ 

กลัวอย่างเดียว จะทิ้งไม่อัพเดทนะสิ ในอนาคตช่วยอัพเดทโชตะน้อยๆมาเป็นกำลังใจให้ที

I love this series, I love this concept, and I love this game title.  Here is my first impressions.

First off, I am thrilled that this game has finally come to PC.  At last!  

Please note, this is not Stardew Valley and should be played differently.

The game seems a bit dumb down from the pervious versions of the title.  The 'story' is a bit childish and appears to be less comples.  I'm not randomly seeing people or bumping into them, but I am forced to through what seems to be a linar story line.  (I am not sure if I'm just too new into the game yet for it to open it)  

I don't know where the random festivals are, the town mayor, why some houses are just 'we'll come back later' after its repaired.  It seems less logic/story based then just 'not yet for your linar story line'.  In the past the game used to have business hours.  At 12 or 1:00pm you knew others would be having lunch or doing their normal rourtine.  

I'm curious what the future holds for this game.  The reason the series has lasted this long has been due to the complex and adorable story lines, attempting to reach goals, getting married, making your farm (the way you want it made) etc.

The ability to farm with one click is AMAZING so thank you!!!  I don't mind skipping over the dull routine of doing the same thing over and over again.

Also hoping I'll have storage somewhere?  We shall see with that as well.

As of now I do recommend this game, but be aware its interesting.  This is also not a graphic based game by any means.  I don't know why the DS version has better graphics - I'm not into major graphics but I also don't understand the downgrade.",1511112148,1511112148,True,11,4,0.524501144886016846,6,True,False,False,False,,,

Every year I begged Natsume to make a PC version.  The initial reviews I read made me worry, but I bought anyhow, and I am very glad I did.  Is this perfect?  No.  Is it exactly what I hoped for in a Harvest Moon PC game?  No.  I would like the music from one of the early games, perhaps it was It's a Wonderful Life, where you connected with the Mineral Town DS and could trade items from two towns.  The perfect game in the Natsume portfolio for me was Rune Factory Frontier on the Wii.  So, yes, I would have preferred more elements from some of the earlier games.  Maybe that will come later?

However, this is highly enjoyable and I am having a great time figuring things out for myself.  At first I thought the fishing was another horrid challenge as it is in some games (like Stardew Valley), but I figured it out, and I like the mining, too.  I will also add that Stardew Valley was always a clone of Harvest Moon for me, as I am so grounded in the latter.

There have many similarities, but SoS has had decades of experience and changing to refine its style and gameplay versus the couple of years that Natsume's beeen making games (not just publishing them). I would equate this game to the older Harvest Moons (ie. N64 or Gameboy). 

Whats I like in the game : 
-The crop growing and animal raising has been streamlined. No more pushing individual animals in/out of the barn or switching between tools.
-Cute story. Its simple (as the original HM games were pretty simple) and progresses rather quickly, so you dont have to wait months in game to grow a crop to progress the game.If youre looking for harder challenges to complete, you can work on upgrading your farm and tools, which require A LOT moire supplies and money.
-The mutation system. Its fun to try different plants in different areas to see what happens (though I wish there were more variations)
-They brought back the gift system. This was lacking in the 3ds game, so its nice to see that come back.

What I didnt like: 
-Repeated characters. There are a few new characters, but MOST of the characters weve seen in the last 2 Harvest Moon games, so its like introducing yourself to the same person withthe same personality and the same problems over and over again. They also tend to repeat the same thing over and over.I also wish there were more then the 14-ish characters total. 
-Graphically, I wouldnt same its bad, but I wish there was a little more variation and a little more effort put into the scenary (though again, the old HM games didnt have much done with the background either). 
-Mining is a pain, you have to plan to use your whole day getting to the next landing level and you have to take a lot of food because the latter placement is random in these huge rooms, you can go through all 5 hearst just on 1 level looking for the latter to the next one and the landings are only every 5 levels. 

Untimately, I think its a game you have to give a few hours of play time to really make a decisiom on likablilty And if you expect ts going to be as good as the SoS games or Stardew Valley, then you will probably be disappointed. But if you go into from the perspective of the old HM games or comparing it to the last few entries, It is improving in quality. I personally like it and find it a good game for the time between now and when the next SoS game gets localized.

I've played the Harvest Moon games for years, and even though Stardew Valley basically puts this game to shame (independently made, tons of wonderful content and marriage candidates), this game is still good in some aspects.

However, I have a lot of gripes with it.  Doesn't even seem like they really tried on some aspects of the mobile port (Tap on screen, seriously?  How did that get through testing?), and some of the key bindings don't really make sense - but it seems they tried to remedy that in their latest update.

My biggest gripe I have so far is that there is NO (clear?) WAY of deleting saved games. I mean, I accidentally made a new save for my current farm, so now I have two saves.  I tried going into my Harvest Moon folder and attempting to find the save data that way, but I couldn't find them at all.  Please make a way to actually delete saved data, or at least make it clearer if already implemented.

I'm also unsure which people are the bachelors/bachlorettes?  I see the friendship meters, but it's not very apparent which of them are actually available for marriage. Not a big deal, but it's still something that should be apparent.  Maybe with hearts instead of music notes?

Also, the walking/running animation makes it seem like you should be going faster than you actually are.  I suggest tweaking it a bit to make the animations a bit slower.  Also, the path-finding heading up to Edmond's house is pretty bad - my character just kept running back and forth like she was lost.

Edit: A few more things I want to point out that I forgot about until I started playing again after the review.  Some of the descriptions of crops aren't consistent.  Some crops state that they can be harvested more than once, but then an NPC informed me that strawberries ALSO could be harvested more than once despite its description not saying so.  There is no consistency there, and there definitely should be.

Another issue that I found out is that it takes energy to pet your animals? Understandable I guess until you're trying to feed your animals and they keep getting in the way of the feeder despite pushing them, so you just keep petting them and WASTING ENERGY because they're being assholes. Please make it cost a lot less or make it easier to push the animals longer distances or something.
-> Also regarding the horse, I befriended it enough and now I can't pet him anymore - I just mount him.  Not sure how I can pet him and raise friendship when I automatically mount the horse now? Unless mounting strengthens friendship, then nevermind, but there aren't any hearts to show that.

I also just found out that improving your tools grants you an entirely new tool for some reason, even though it's supposed to be an improvement to your existing one.  So I currently have one basic watering can, one expert watering can, one basic hoe, and one expert hoe in my inventory. Not sure if this is a bug or not but that's something that should be improved upon.  You shouldn't have two/three/four things of the same thing in your inventory when they should be improvements, not brand new ones.

Overall a decent game, but things could be improved upon. I'm only in early summer, so my review could change from now until later.  I'm still having fun with the game, but it is NOT worth the $30 price tag.

((I took out a portion of my review about receiving a quest in late Spring to craft some food that required strawberries, but then I found out that's what the fertilizer is for - it helps grow crops in the season they don't do so well in.))

Pros:
- Has a bubble indicator to note what kind of crop it is if you've grown it before. Very nifty.
- I like the concept of restarting a village, and I like how this was accomplished.
- Pretty straightforward starting out, although there were a few things I was confused on, such as how to get the hammer and how to get material stone.
- The animals and characters are cute HOWEVER they need to work on the clipping issues.  This is visible as a female character and you're running south - the shorts/legs are clipping.
- You don't have to swap tools, which is REALLY nice.  You just point and click on a thing you want to do (till the ground/water a crop/smash a rock/chop a tree) and it does it automatically.
- Harvesting crops is SO NICE, you can click, and drag your mouse over crops that are ready to be harvested and you can pick up a lot of crops doing this.  I just now found this out and I'm in a quarter-way through the summer month.
- You can plant crops and flowers at any time of the year (!!!) HOWEVER you should be using fertilizer every so often to ensure they don't just wither and die.

Cons:
- All of my gripes I mentioned above.
- Not worth the $30 price tag as-is. Seems more like a $15 game.
- There doesn't seem to be any real benefit to planting crops anywhere else besides your farmland, but maybe I'm just not far enough into the game.
- No character customization. I would REALLY love character customization, even something as simple as a new eye or hair colors.
- Fishing seems buggy.  There were quite a few instances where I was definitely mashing my left mouse button and it was NOT going down.  I think it's because my mouse was directly over the square/area where the fish & bobber was? Either way that should NOT be a thing and should be fixed.
- The townsfolk basically stand in one position (sometimes they will walk around depending on where they are) until a certain point of time and then they just DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR and appear somewhere else on the map.  This is lazy design, make them walk like normal people. Except the mage, his apprentices, and the Harvest Sprites - those at least make sense.
- Economy honestly seems rather broken.  I believe I reached 100k gold within my first month, if not very early on in summer.  The mining needs tweaked because you can make SO MUCH just by mining alone.  It's where I have made the majority of my money.  The earnings needs toned down by quite a lot, or it should require more ore to create a gem.",1511034108,1511134236,False,57,0,0.80037921667098999,1,False,False,False,False,,,

After playing for a few hours and reaching the cut-off time for a refund, I decided to continue playing and keep the game. Why? Because I genuinely enjoyed it. Yes, the farming mechanics are simplistic, and yes the art/graphics are pretty barebones, but it has a surprising amount of charm to it. So far the characters actually are showing signs of having some personality [at least on par with MFOMT localization] compared to their previous endeavors as a development company, and while farming is perhaps TOO easy, it's fun and now I can plant and harvest over 85 crops as early as spring 4th! As a veteran HM farmer, that made me pretty happy. 
  
Yes, Stardew Valley, and Story of Seasons are WAY better. But this game is actually fun as well. If you've already played both of those games for over 100+ hours [like I did], and are an old school harvest moon fan, then I think that you'll really enjoy playing this game. It's very carefree and easy, something fun to do for a couple of hours. Also a good game for introducing younger people [or people new to video games in general] to the joys of farming/dating sims.  
  
Now, the only real issue I'm having is that NO, this game is NOT worth thirty dollars. Maybe 15, or even 18. But not thirty. 
If the character portraits were actual ART and not polygons, and if the map were twice as large and the mechanics better, then maybe I could see charging that amount. My recommendation would be to wait until it's on uber sale, and THEN buy it. It's worth having in your library if you like these kind of games, but just not for the listed amount, especially since it's a digital copy, not even physical. [and no manual and artbook either, boo. Natsume please fix this.]

• Light of Hope is the latest game in the Natsume series, having a horrendous graphic that nobody want to look at it so theres alway a negative vibe around the game but if you take a look at it, it is actually pretty decent

• LoH plays very much like a traditional HM game, so farming does not have much change, the game have a variety of fertilizers to choose from, there is a tons of crops and they all can mutate, not to mention that the farm you own has a very large size (roughly equivalent to Stardew Valley)

• Activities outside farming such as mining, fishing, ranching and cooking in general are very normal and nothing outstanding. There are no monsters in the Mine, the mine it self look bland and lack any kind of creativity in design, the number of fish species in the game is not much compared to the number of crops In the game, the animals in the game include Chicken, Sheep, Cow, Horse, Dunkey, ... .Crafting does not exist in the game, the material is only for upgrade.

•The most important point to me in a HM game is the character , and have to say that I am very pleased about the character in LoH and this is probably the brightest point of LoH. This game is full of cuties, we have Dean a big redhead who work in the flower shop with his mother and ask me for fertilizer every damn time, Jeanne a lonely girl with a small garden like to spend time in the mountains and Doc a mad scientist who owns a robo dog, theres also 3 magicians in the game (mage, wizard, witch) and alot more cool character, no samesexmarriage btw. Festivals in the game are generally fun, including dog racing, cooking,fishing ... things,the game also have little events in the year like fireworks, gift day, ...

• The visual part of the game is bad, the 3D character model that combined with the 2D background  make the character look like he/she not touching the ground, not to mention the texture is pretty low look like 720p that is stretched. The game supports controller and you can play the game with only mouse, the game also plays well on the window tablet.

• In general LoH is not bad, if you have 30$ in your pocket and already own Stardew Valley then LoH is a game for you to chill the fuck out after a hard day at school or work (Slime Rancher is also fun if you want to relieve stress). 

• An ok and very basic HM game that has nothing special about it, Natsume choose a safe bet this time

As a long-time Harvest Moon player, I do not recommend to get this because you can get better HM games on 3DS, alternatively called ""Story of Seasons"" or get Stardew Valley instead for better gameplay and more contents...
----------

The main issue I have is that this game overall took major stepdowns than the previous HM games I have familiar with; more things are absent/not presented.. It's hard to suggest people to play this while there are better HM games existed out there on portable console that offers more varieties, extensive gameplay, and customizations (HM: A New Beginning and Story of Seasons).. 

Light of Hope still offers basic core HM gameplay that have been known for the series; from farming, fishing, mining to getting friends and eventually get married, all are there and working like before, but it's so basic that the repetitive nature of the game is way higher than previous HM and there's not much stuff to do to fill the time with different activities like before... In short, LoH feels more like a downgraded version and a major disappointment for the first series entry for the PC...

If PC the only choice of platform to play farming games, Stardew Valley is still the best option overall..",1510914353,1511020588,False,383,18,0.873274028301239014,24,True,False,False,False,,,

-passive npcs, unlike other HM series, when you get the task to make a ""delicious animal feed"", to lure the blue bird, some NPCs will always stay at the same place and always say the same thing until you finish that task,my advice don't forget to plant strawberry  in spring.
-we can't even see how and when the NPC move from a location to other location.
-no more calendar, (maybe because i'm still new ?
-mining is now doesn't worth much money

-the graphic, i prefer PS2 HM series, or 3DS HM

-but the farming not too bad, eventough it doesn't worth much money, 
i still can make much money from fishing , clam digging, and selling boiled eggs

Story
It's light hearted, true to form HM fare. There's a struggling town in the middle of nowhere and you are tasked to revive it. It's not deep, but it's fun enough.

Characters
The characters are interesting and I feel like I want to know more about them. This for me sets HM/SoS/Rune Factory apart from other farm sims. These games put as much focus on the community as they do the farming and they do it well. This game is no exception.

Farming
Farming/Ranching is well-rounded with the added bonus of mutations. I've not been able to mess with the system much, but it seems like it will add a lot of experimentation and discovery to the typical farming formula. It also adds a lot more crops and products to the list. The mutation system was actually the selling point that finally made me buy the game. 
I will add that the expansion of your farm is directly linked to the expansion of the town. You can't ignore the town repairs.

Graphics
Again, it wholly reminds me of a 3ds game. They're clear, colorful and to me they're charming. Graphics have never been a make or break for me either way.

I make a point to review every game on its own merit and overall this game is just plain fun. Plus, it's exciting to repair the town bit by bit and find new mutations. If the price bothers you wait until a sale comes along, but for me it's worth the price tag.",1510843963,1510843963,True,18,1,0.580055773258209229,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Is it worth the price? Eh.

There is more content than I thought at first, I am moving through the main storyline pretty quickly, but there is a TON of stuff to unlock. but I don't think the replayability is there like it is in SDV. especially since you can't skip scenes. 

Everyone is complaining about the graphics but they remind me of Another Wonderful LIfe on the GameCube. Just more yellow. I genuinely prefer the graphics to stardew valley, but at least SDV allows mods. 

Characters are pretty cute and have some lol dialogue, made me wish there were more. 

You have a gratuitous amount of land available to use, I wish there was more I could do with it than just plant crops. as far as I know I can make a couple fence types and upgrade my house. I would like to be able to create pathways and ranch more animals. I was excited by the character Doc the Architect, the name made me think we could make some cool things. :(

But it uses the characters from The Lost Valley and Skytree Village, along with a brand new story.

A port would be a complete copy of the mobile game, adapted to PC with no changes to the art, story and characters.

Does it feel like a complete and complex Harvest Moon title? No.  It is worth the buy? Yes, but only once the pice drops (Steam sales, anyone?)

It is, per se, a very simplified Harvest Moon experience. If you expect and want the complete experience, play Story of Seasons.

In itself, it's still very enjoyable. There are some pro and cons, however:

PROS
- Greatly enhanced rucksack system. Honestly, I'm surprised no one though of that earlier. No more tool swapping all the time. And THAT feels super great.
- Laid back atmosphere.
- Straightforward story.
- Most (but not all) of the hand-drawn style backgrounds look rather good.
- No more awkward minecraft-esque world building.

CONS
- Complete re-use of characters from other games. Honestly, why go through the trouble of creating a new story only to re-use past characters?
- At the beginning of the game it's hard to completely fill an entire day. I often use out all my energy and need to go to bed at 11am.
- As much as the hand-drawn style of most art assets is pretty, there are also huge problems with the look of some items. Most notably proportion-wise.
- The 3D characters look out of place.
- I hear the keyboard controls are so-so. I'm ready to believe that and list it as a con, even though I've been using a controller (PS3 controller emulating an Xbox controller) and saw no issues.
- Sometimes the story feels too simple and pretty bland. It feels like an alpha build or an incomplete game at times.

Not wanting to go all fan-boyish on the game, but will say the wife and I own just about every Harvest Moon game released in the US, and have drawers and a closet of old consoles and hand-helds, many of which were bought just to play HM games.

This one in particular is no better or worse than many of the others and it does have a unique charm in that it's the 20th anniversary themed game so does go back to the roots of the genre in being more focused on the farming, socializing, and town building aspects of its earliest predecessors.

It also has cameo appearances from NPC's of earlier titles as well. As well as a storyline focusing back on reviving the Harvest Goddess.

So for us, this game has a lot of charm, and thankfully, a reaffirmation of what Harvest Moon games are all about - farming, socializing, a touching storyline about rebirth and renewal with a cast of loveable NPC's that really make you feel welcome in a game you feel like calling home.

It's a love letter to all the Harvest Moon games in the past, and as such is a welcome, appreciated, and recommended Harvest Moon game for all of its fans.

If the game sucked, I would say so, but in our long years of playing Harvest Moon games, this one definitely doesn't. Is it the best Harvest Moon game? No. But it's also not nearly in the bottom either.

Beyond being a homage to the series, it's a solid, enjoyable addition to the series in its own right. And one that returns to what Harvest Moon is all about.

I am really missing character customization as well. I don't know if the clothing requests work the same in this one as SV, my sheep is still a baby and the first request asks for two wool. The house upgrade asks for a lot of dough and mats, but it gives me something to look forward to working towards.

I think that this was more than worth the money since I can already tell I'm going to spend at least quadruple that on this game.

It looks like crop mutations work similarly as stated above, just with stuff being out of season being fragile.

There are completionist achievments and depending on how you play will impact the difficulty but overall it's accessible to everyone. This game fits well into the Harvest Moon formula and does evoke some nostalgia for its predecessors while still bringing new elements to the table. If you've played and Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, or Stardew Valley then you've pretty much got the gist of the game. It's not supposed to be challenging to the point of ripping your hair out but instead a relaxing and enjoyable escape.",1510773826,1510773826,True,7,0,0.484412461519241333,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm not going to lie - I debated long and hard on whether or not to recommend this game or not.  Even in the video I made for it I was leaning heavily towards not recommending it.  But after considering it, I realized it had something that kept me interested - charm.  While the game might look like some sort of cheap mobile knockoff, be kind of goofy at times, and generally not seem too appealing, it still captures the overall spirit of Harvest Moon and carries that charm with it.  

Don't get me wrong - it has it's downsides.  The biggest being the price.  When you have the farming gem Stardew Valley at $15 and it being such an amazing game - you should be priced more competitively.  Yes, Harvest Moon is the original.  Yes, it set the standard for the farming/RPG genres.  But this is the first foray into the PC market and you have an amazing game to compete against... so compete!

Graphically the game just doesn't look impressive.  It's more reminiscent of a flash game. It's trying to aim for that retro look while also going for modern and it just looks... not great.  Also a lot of sections that simply look like standard mobile icons in pretty much every mobile game ever (the big, bubbly boxes for example).  

The natural keybindings for the game are frustrating.  More frustrating is that it took a minute to actually find the options and make changes to it (or to even exit the game).  

There are a few quality of life changes that I did enjoy.  The main one probably being that you can just click on something and your character will automatically interact with it properly - water it, cut it down, harvest it, etc.  This is really nice for those of us who have the tendency to forget to switch tools and accidentally cut down our hard work.  Though I guess for some it might be ""easy mode.""  

In conclusion I think Natsume has kind of dropped the ball on this game in a lot of ways - pricing, looks, control, etc.  But through it all they managed to keep that spirit alive and somehow make it fun - even alongside titans like Stardew Valley, Rune Factory, etc.  But I will say if you're on the fence about the whole farming RPG games - avoid this one. It costs entirely too much and you can spend half of this and get something that's definitely great.  But if you're an old school fan and just enjoy this genre as a whole, then it may be worth considering.",1510771667,1510771667,True,8,1,0.500580012798309326,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Graphic: Compare to how horrible Lost Valley was it was improvement, But i feel like Skytree had better Graphic then Light of Hope did. So i giving (Graphic 6/10 Rating.)

Controls: I played on Gamepad. Could be little more smoother i got stuck sometimes. or while trying to pluck weeds wasted enegry by using the hoe instead. I did like that i didn't have to go menu to change tool/items.
(Controls 7/10 Rating)

Gameplay: Lot more fun then Lost Valley, About the same as Skytree. Quest could be more organize by what has been unlock. Example: Nova want bread. (No clue how to get bread why? Because i didn't know you had to unlock resturant to cook nobody in game explain that.) Plant grow to fast and are to easy to get seeds. (Gameplay 7/10)

Story: Better story then Lost Valley. Not as good as Skytree. The story felt rushed and little to fast. You shouldn't be handed main part of story right off the bat. Nor middle part of the story right after. It should be a challage and explain what your goal is to aim for. ( I talking about Tablets). (Story 5/10 Rating)

Overall Review: This game is not bad or good. It inbetween they aim it towards younger kids and little towards the older fans. I'm a HM Vet. I wish they kept Skytree graphic but i can understand them trying out a different approach as they grow. The game is little to easy because of it aiming towards Kids. Wish they up challage because kids are smarter these days and don't need it dull down.

Ending Note: To everyone giving this a negtive review least play this  more then 2-4 mins.  If you're going to review this you need to compare it to there other self made games not there past localization. Because Natsume didn't make any of Harvest Moon games in past. They only translated it. Lost Valley-Skytree-Seeds of Memory-Light of Hope. Are in studio made game. So you need to review base from Lost-seed of memory.

There is some boring grindy parts, and the tutorial takes FOREVER. And if you don't pay attention to dialog, you can get stuck in a spot for hours.

I am excited about the crop mutations and figuring those out, and I like the fact that you can go back to the mine in increments of 6 (6, 11...) so you don't have to start at 1 every time. 

It is a tad bit hard to get your items upgraded, though, and getting your house upgraded is REALLY tough.

Some downsides to note:
- Aboslutely zero character customization. This feels like a giant leap backwards because A New Beginning let us customize our characters, and that was so well received that it should have set the standard for futures game. The complete lack of character customization was and is a huge turn off for me personally.
- Very little to 'forage'. You start in the spring and there are 3 things you can forage (every few days, not daily) 2 types of flowers and bamboo shoots. 
- If you're not paying attention, you can accidentally buy crops that are not in season at the time of purchase. Once planted they'll die unless fertalized.

While the artwork may not be for everyone, I found it totally fine for the most part with only a couple things looking a little off such as the mountain edge cliff and the water backdrop behind it. The animals and characters are well done with their expressions and the animals are really cute. The expressions are especially silly such as everyone's extremely alarmed look when they find out you were the one to repair their homes and shops. Your character's running animation is also a tad goofy as well but it's serviceable and after a while you don't notice as much and get used to it. The game also has some helpful innovations like a little thought bubble that tells you how your crop is doing and if it needs water, etc. Also there are some great streamlined features such as not needing to switch tools to do different activities. The game knows automatically what you are wanting to do given the current context and does it. I'm also super excited to finally get the so-called ""candy"" animals such as the cow that produces chocolate milk and the cotton candy sheep.

However, being as that I've grown up with Harvest Moon since the SNES, I decided to give it a run anyway.
And I'm not dissapointed. It very much has the spirit and feel of the older games that I fell in love with time and time again.

Pros:
Frame rate is fine
Not having to switch tools for all actions comes in handy
Controller works just fine (Using a Logitech Controller from Best Buy)
Villagers have many cute emotes during conversations, making it engaging

Cons:
Not really sure when festivals happen, there doesn't seem to be a calendar.
Takes a while to really get started and it's hard to find all the tools. (I've found all of them and now the game is fine.)
Is it worth $30, no. Maybe $15

HMLH follows the generic storyline from past games; A lost goddess, a farmer saviour, and a whole lot of farming simulation in order to save a goddess. Though this is very similar to past games, it will do a treat for a newer generation of gamers and new platforms. 

Though the story is intersting to follow, the graphics aren't something to be consider 'next gen'. The sprites (Crops, Rocks, Trees, Buildings and Furniture) all look as if they have been enlarged from a smaller image, creating a dissatisfy pixelated look. The player looks like something straight from the original WII series, which struggles to fit in with the other art styles. The players running animation not only does not work the way it's intended, the player almost seems to be floating over the ground, rather than walking. 

While walking you will encounter numerous obsticles. These obsticales are not something that you would expect, as they aren't intended to be in the game. The mesh around each object does not fit the size of the sprite, causing your player to constantly get stuck on weeds and rocks while trying to farm. 

Farming is what made the Harvest Moon series different to other RPG's and the mechanics always seemed to be spot on! But not in this game, this game was a massive let down. The fact that tools are automatically selected and not able to be manually selected makes farming a hassle. Honestly trying to chop down a tree has never been so hard! You somehow miss the tree, and end up hoeing the ground!

Lastly the port was a massive let down for PC, the start screen says touch, the control icons are from XBOX and the totourial is on keyboard and mouse! I've never been so confused with controls in my life! ARMA 2 has easier controls to understand! Overall I recomend playing this game on a controller, it is much easier control.

To conclude I do not recomend this game for the retail price of $30 thus far. The game should have been delayed from release, graphics made to at least be at a default of 1080p, all animation at 30-60fps and lastly the port fixed to know what device you are playing on.

Seeing as it's a Harvest Moon Game which Stardew Valley was inspired by, it's of no surprise that reviews will compare the two.

Standalone this game holds it's own, It features everything a classic Harvest Moon should.
The mouse controls work well and keyboard is only just minor adjustment behind.
Unfortunately the experience is a little spoilt by clashing character models and world aesthetics.

[h1]Mouse controls work beautifully.[/h1]

In menus the mouse is confirm (left mouse) and back (right mouse)

I click a tile on the ground and it does the action it needs. chop trees, break rocks, till the soil. Can all be done with a simple click for each action, the character will move to the tile and do the action.

If you click on a tile ready to plant it will bring up a simple selection to pick the seed, and you can click the arrows to go previous and next seeds.

[h1]Keyboard, unfortunately has minor problems[/h1]

You can move the character with W,A,S and D and this works well.
Unfortunately for some reason they chose to use I think F1 and F2 as default for previous pane and next pane.
This is easily remedied by changing it to Q and E. This makes farm life very smooth.

[h1]Graphics are aesthetically disjointed[/h1]

I found the aesthetics of the characters and world to be very different, 

I found myself enjoying them both separately but the mix of the two clashes for me.
I was able to lose focus of the character while farming and focus on the characters while talking the the NPC's

I feel a more shortened character models would have proven to suit the world more.

[h1]Odd instructions, Steam version before console, inexperienced PC developer?[/h1]

The player is given the instruction to ""Tap Screen"", a PC player might at first glance jump to conclusions and write this game off.

Although, Getting into the game, the player is also greeted with controller prompts.

While also, the mouse controls work perfectly but are not shown.

On top of this the developer has chosen to release this on the PC before the consoles.

With all this in mind, I can't help but feel the developer is using the ability to rapidly patch within the steam platform as a means to get the game ready for other platforms where patching is somewhat more difficult

I have to hope they are dipping their toes in to PC development and are just inexperienced to the needs of a PC user, I hope they will polish what they have. only time will tell.

[h1]Stardew Valley or This[/h1]

If you had to pick one of the other for a PC user, I'd have to pick Stardew Valley, simply because of being able to modify it to add anything you liked from Harvest Moon: Light of Hope.

The controls confused me a little bit at first, but it's nice how they made it so you don't have to switch around in your controls to select the needed tool. It automatically selects the necessary tool you need whether it is plowing, chopping, planting, or watering. You just click. In the long run, this takes out the jarring portion of any farming game where you need to constantly choose the correct tool. (Sometimes selecting the wrong one and wasting energy). I feel like the developers put a lot of thought and effort into this portion of the game.

I only played 2 hours into the game, so I can't say much for story yet. But I feel like they could have put a little bit more effort into the intro.

Just like my initial impression, I am generally pleased by this game and love how it plays on my Windows tablet. I do have my gripes with the game, which I'll discuss in this review, but overall I really like it and still recommend it.

This game is extremely versatile when it comes to how and where you can play it. It has three main input methods that work interchangeably and seamlessly: Keyboard, gamepad and mouse/touch. You can mix and match, but they work best on their own. I've noticed some people playing the game on streams and youtube trying to play this like it's Stardew Valley, and while it's possible, it's definitely not optimal. This versatility means I can confortably play this on my tablet, without any extra peripherals attached, which is already the number one thing I wanted from this game.

The farming works great in this game, it's possibly the best farming gameplay in the series, and it has some hidden depth to it that may throw some people off. Crops have their favorite seasons where they grow well and happy, but you can plant any crop or flower in any season, they'll just need some extra help (fertilizer) to keep them alive. There's four different types of soil types, and many fertilizers you can use. This combination of season, soil and fertilizer can make certain crops change and mutate into different, usually more valuable variations.

There's a ton of different muations to discover, and registering them all in your encyclopedia is one of the many optional goals you can achieve, and probably the most time consuming.

Compared to Natsume's previous entries in the series, this one takes the best from their past experiments, and combines it with a more traditional top down gameplay style that, while a bit underwhelming for people used to PC gaming, works great for people like me with weaker hardware.

Graphically, I don't mind it, it looks just like their other games, which looked fine to me to begin with. But I do understand other's reactions, as I said, it still looks the same as their previous three games, games released on weaker hardware and systems with tiny screens. I think it's certainly time for Natsume to try some new graphics.

Of course, the game is not perfect, and there's some quirks that should be addressed.

For starters, there's some noticeable graphical issues that happen with some characters like Sam, Doc, and Elise, where parts of their models clip through each other as they interact or move around. Some background elements also have noticeable differences in style and quality, for example, the palm trees are in a really nice hand-drawn artstyle, while the other two types of trees are renders of a 3D model. The same goes for multiple other things, like the houses, where it's clear they have different origins and styles.

Some lines of dialog and quests are awkward, and/or confusing. This is specially noticeable when playing through several parts of the storyline, for example, there's a bit where for no reason you must first build the house of an unrelated NPC before the game will allow you to find the item you need, and this is AFTER the game explicitly told you how find the mcguffin in question. 

Little confusions like that are present through the entire story, and will likely stump several players. Curiously enough, while the game keeps track of minor sidequests you get in the mail, the main story quests are not recorded at all.

Another gripe I have with the game is that mining for gems is so profitable, risk free, and easy that it basically trivializes farming as a source of income. Because, why bother using the multiple huge fields you have available for agriculture, when mining for a day will give you more money that you'll get for a week of farm work? And it's not like mining is optional, because you'll need lots of resources from that mine, and the gems will be just byproduct.

Anyway, all things considered, I really like this game, I think more people should give it a chance (waiting for a sale is always good, though), and I hope it will continue to be polished and grow as time goes on.",1510685708,1511379170,True,6,1,0.251123160123825073,3,True,False,False,False,,,

1. It looks like it's a poorly optimized mobile port (""tap screen"", really?)
2. My PC can handle Witcher 3 on ultra settings. It seems it can't handle this game :D (poor FPS)
3. The graphics - it looks like someone planted 3D models on backgrounds taken from RPG Maker stock. The devs wrote they wanted a nostalgic feeling, but I think it could look much better in pixel art (like Stardew Valley or old Gameboy Harvest Moons).
4. You can't skip cutscenes.
5. Character models are bad (the style is a matter of taste, but they're poorly made - for example the traveling salesman's collar is sinking into his thorax as he breathes). Also, you can't customize your character. 
6. Refund, please! (edit: got the refund, thanks!) For me, it's not worth the current price. But I'll probably grab it when it's cheaper/on sale. 

Neutral:
1. You keep a ""lvl 1 house"" in your BAG :D
2. XBOX controller is working fine for me. 

The Good Things: 
1. You don't have to change tools - an automatic action is chosen (when you press a button near unwatered crop - it's watered, when you press a button near a weed - it's pulled out, when you press a button near a flower - it's pulled out and put into your inventory).
2. Rebuilding of a village sounds fun.
3. The gameplay seems OK.

I feel a bit cheated for this price, if you're a Harvest Moon fan and you feel nostalgic, better wipe the dust off your Gameboy/3DS/whatever and play the old games. Or try Stardew Valley. Or try Rune Factory (it's AWESOME). And wait for the sale because I'm not saying it's a totally bad game, just that IMHO it's not worth that much - that's why I don't recommend getting it now.",1510682376,1510942964,False,768,15,0.906472384929656982,40,True,False,False,False,,,
