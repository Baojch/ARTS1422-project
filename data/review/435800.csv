My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707402903,1707402903,True,1,0,0.489690721035003662,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It actually works, too, for a number of levels, but as you get further into the game and the level design changes, it gets almost impossibly frustrating. At a certain point in the game, the difficulty switches from having to keep track of two balls to dealing with the bad hitboxes, weird visual design choices and floaty controls, the death of any precision platformer. 

Balls get stuck on edges very easily, get hit by projectiles they barely touch, and have very weird physics when interacting with each other, which is a pain especially in the levels where one ball has to protect the other by rolling in front of it (as orange can't get hit by blue obstacles and vice versa). Jumping is very inaccurate as well. Or, in short: you can't control both balls as precisely as the game demands, so finishing a level (especially for S times) often comes down to luck later in the game.

I will say that Binaries does tickle the brain in a unique way, but the controls and level design just don't match a precision platformer, and the difficulty of having to keep track of two things at the same time becomes an illusion once you realize that it often just comes down to hoping that the wonky physics play along. If the level design was built more on the first couple levels, the game would have been a lot better imo.

Binaries is a platformer where you control multiple units at once. Therefore the game is very disorientating for most of the levels, and can feel very annoyingly just like you have to use trial and error. There are also a lot of nicely designed levels that are fun to figure out.

The problem I had was that by the time I had 100% completion, I was only just starting to feel like I was getting good at the main mechanic of the game: being able to watch and move two units at once (the last thing I had to do was replay some of the first levels to beat the time trials). For the rest of the game a lot of the time I'd just been swapping which unit I was looking at and learning by trial and error where was safe to land for the others. So now I'm finished and don't feel like I have fully been tested on the skill the game has given me.

There's too many lazy levels and bad design choices (that the in game subtitle commentary tries and fails to make uniquely comedic) and also a couple of very minor bugs like getting stuck going through small gaps and sometimes not dying to projectiles.

There's no workshop/user-made levels. The aesthetic's alright. The music is nothing special. Took me about 7 hours to 100% over a couple of months.

All those jumps and dodges you’ll have to do, you do for two (or more) balls simultaneously. With only one set of controls to do it.

You ever heard of how difficult it is to simultaneously “tap you head and rub your tummy” or “draw circle with one hand and triangle with another”? That’s exactly the skill this game will put to the test. This is multitasking brought to the extreme, this is the ultimate twofer, this is the stone to kill two birds with.

Level design definitely deserves a praise too. With 101 levels, developers really explored the concept of simultaneous control to the fullest, finding time and time again in what particular way it goes against any instinct you had so far.
Add minimalistic, but very clean design, simple, but appropriate soundtrack – and you not only swearing and breaking your keyboard, but doing it in stylish and relaxing environment.

Rien de difficile jusqu’ici.

Là où ça se complique, c’est que vous contrôlez toutes les boules en même temps. Quand une va à droite, l’autre va à droite aussi.

Evidemment, une boule orange sur des piques oranges, c’est perdu ! Heureusement, une boule orange, sur des piques bleus, vous n’avez rien à craindre et pour l’inverse aussi (une boule bleue sur des piques oranges).

Dans Binaries, il ne faut pas avoir peur de perdre et de recommencer, et de rerecommencer et encore et toujours encore.

They carefully chose the name of their studio after ants because, in their words, they are ‘small, sociable and very hardworking.’ Though I wasn’t able to confirm their size through communications with them I was able to confirm that they are definitely friendly and the amount of work that has gone into making Binaries one of the smartest new puzzle-platformers on Steam attests to their hardworking nature.

It is this hardworking nature that definitely pays off with the quality of their game. It’s a game where you are tasked at guiding two cute through brightly colored challenges. Although I bring into question the game’s validity of being the first concentration platform game – which it bills itself as being on its website – it definitely made me concentrate a lot more than I thought that I was going to do throughout the game.

With 101 levels contained within the game there is certainly more than enough content to justify the $9.99 price tag. In fact, I would go so far as to suggest that when the game is on any multiple figure discount that the game should be considered an absolute bargain. It’s not just a quantity over quality type equation for the game either. Every level that I have played through feels as though it belongs and hasn’t simply been added to the game to bump up the arbitrary number of levels. It’s certainly a case of quality and quantity here.

I quite enjoyed the fact that the game has a non-linear map. Certain levels are colored blue and others are orange. I’m unsure whether this is intended to signify that one level is harder than another or not but you do need to control balls of both colors through every level. Perhaps the reason that I do not know the answer to this question is because I was having too much fun and I was quickly selecting the next level and the next and so on. Unlike many infuriating platformer games where you have no choice in what level you play next you and has you quitting because you cannot defeat that next level having the choice of picking another level makes the game player friendly.

There’s an enormous amount of replayability within the game. With timed awards for each level – S, A and B – you will constantly find yourself returning to previous levels to best your personal bests. Even when you have unlocked S on a level you may feel as though you’re capable of beating your best time.

The presentation of the graphics and the sound are top notch. The developer added the soundtrack to Steam as purchasable DLC because there was a demand for it among the playing base. The game’s music changes dependent upon how you are faring in each level. If you’re playing poorly it will slow down and try to aide your concentration but if you’re doing superbly well the soundtrack can become quite frantic and will help keep you in the zone.

Finally, the game has been Steamified with trading cards and Steam achievements.

What more could you possibly ask for from a puzzle-platformer? This game is fantastic and is highly addictive.

I've always been a huge fan of platformers and puzzle games. [i]Binaries[/i] is like the genius love child of the two genres.

The concept is very intriguing: controlling two blocks to get each one to a separate goal. It looks odd on paper, but [i]Binaries[/i] executes it flawlessly. The levels pose a very good challenge, but not to the point of being neigh impossible. I'd say it's more NES hard than [i]I Wanna Be The Guy[/i] hard.

Graphically, it's a damn good looking game. The best way I can describe it is like [i]PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition[/i] - It's minimalistic, but it's beautiful.

The music in this game is phenomenal, so much so that I kinda want to buy the soundtrack. That's something I hardly ever say about any video game, even AAA titles. The sound effects aren't too bad, either.

The game controls marvelously on the XB1 controller. There was never a time when I felt it controlled too loose nor tight, it's right there in the Goldilocks zone where, within two levels, you have the physics down to a T.

Should you buy it? YES! Buy it now! Hell, I'd get the soundtrack along with the game! And seriously, Ant Workshop, you should put this on the console stores. No joke, you would make a killing!",1460551598,1460551598,True,3,0,0.488356024026870728,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Could soak hours into it if you wanted to race friends times. If no friends you might get bored after beating each level once or twice. (See gameplay in video below).

~Overall Score - 8.75/10

[b]Long version:[/b] For a puzzle game I can really admire this. It is a lot different of a game than you might orginally think, innovative you could say to some extent. I've only played about the first 10 levels or so, but I've seen some of the higher levels you can get to in their intro video. I would highly recommend this game if you are a puzzler that likes a challenge, or even if you are a casual gamer that may only have 5 minutes to spare at times.

[list]
[*][b]Gameplay - 10/10 -[/b] For being a puzzle game it sticks to it's guns. You get exactly what you are expecting, besdies some of the levels being tricky, but that is part of the expereince. Figuring out how to beat a level is what makes you want to play it again and again. 101 levels seems like a lot, and it will have you playing for several hours to beat them all, but how many hours more will it take to master them all is another question. You also have the ability to skip levels if you are stuck, which is great to give yourmind a rest when you are too puzzled.

[*][b]Replayability - 8/10 -[/b] Lots, if you like to challenge yourself. The game does have 3 internal rankings S, A, and B in order of highest rank for fastest time possible. If you are one that wants to get that high ranking you will play each level many different times. IF you don't that's where the drop in score comes in, and you can only improve so much before most won't find it as fun to0 grind those small numbers.

[*][b]Graphics - 9/10 -[/b] Not everything needs oto be state of the art, and for being a simple game it gets simple graphics. Although the theme is orange it blue, it could use some sprucing up in color in spots you need need to move on or in the menues. This may just be a personal feel.

[*][b]Controls - 8/10 -[/b] This game does come with controller support, seeing as you move both balls at once it is only as tr4icky to use as you will make it to paly, I didn't try it out though. Although I do find it a bit wonky you can't remap the keys and the only way to jump is either spacebar or the enter key on keyboard mode.[/list]
