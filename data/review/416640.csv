      四级阅读压力不大，读起来语句感觉相对成熟，有很明显的小说感而不是游戏感。是继Tally Ho、Agent 180 和Night Road之后我比较喜欢的一个GOC游戏。

      一周目，感觉很棒！虽然果然是恶人模拟器（？）玩的时候不停感叹：小丑竟是我自己！谜语人竟是我自己！莫里亚蒂竟是我自己！虽然无论什么奇怪题材的游戏都能给我玩成幽默喜剧（）不愧是我。
      总的来说人物动作语言选择范围还是比较广的。为了游戏体验和剧情效果（此提议适用于所有COG游戏），一开始就选好自己的行事风格，后面盯着这一点发展。虽然失败的技能检验文本读起来很开心但是各位一定还是更喜欢顺利地继续吧，哈哈哈。

      吐槽：[spoiler]来和我一起大声感叹：格鲁竟是我自己！虽然在游戏里时不时会出现戏剧大师莫里亚蒂风格的选项，但是总的来说我的人设还是软萌（？）格鲁大叔呢（甚至因为过于“Good Guy”被暗网的各位鄙视，太艹了），毕竟我只是一个猫猫都不杀的无辜小甜饼(Cookies) 。关于这一点我倒是觉得我个人很符合暗网起名字的要求（关于你想成为什么，你想成就什么）[/spoiler][spoiler]甚至最后打了个世界和平成就就真的太艹了啊[/spoiler]
      还有游戏里有的紧张时刻会感觉到一种熟悉的憨豆电影式搞笑氛围，太艹了。[spoiler]比如后面会有那个暗网组织协会喊你去喝茶，喝到一半义警乱入。我、协会特工和义警三方对决。字幕都吐槽说“Fine, all I need know is my eighth-grade PE teacher to show up, and everyone I've been trying to avoid all my life would be there.""看的时候直接笑哭。然后就是大家的反应时间，里面就有一个”fine,you two take care of each other, I'll get out of here... ...""这种怂怂的选项才适合我这种全剧搞笑担当啊（）[/spoiler]当然人物也比较有意思··· ···特别有意思。[spoiler]比如那个一见面就试图色诱的Court其实一直在偷偷资助孤儿院··· ···[/spoiler][spoiler]太艹了。原本玩的时候我已经脑补好了一万字被背刺的黑化科学家人设哪晓得最后他居然··· ···[/spoiler] [spoiler]人工智能是好文明！我直接斯哈斯哈（？）[/spoiler][spoiler]后面他要你去执行任务，给的服装都是什么鬼，性感泳衣和小丑服··· ···无论选哪个选项就真的就都是""sacrifice your dignity""··· ···感觉这个朋友是个活生生从卡通片里走出来的纯良反派，甚至为了阻止恐怖袭击去绑架市长（）[/spoiler]
      
      总的来说游戏基调很轻松愉悦迪士尼（？），类比《神偷奶爸》，角色都很可爱。
      还有我想问一下，为什么好像我碰到的每一个人都试图跟我调情？？？不讲武德啊，偷袭一个纯真善良的银行抢劫犯，你们这些人呐（一位老UT·调情大师Firsk·玩家义愤填膺地谴责道）。

Now i will be discussing some SPOILERS from this point onwards so read at your own risk.

Most main character will survive untill the final act no matter what you do, making your choice irrelevant. There's a chapter in which your character has the option to kill another character, Even if you choose to kill him, you won't since your character got a change of heart suddenly. the worst offender is the ending, now i won't go into too much spoilers but let's just say that what ending you get is dependant only on your last choice, a.k.a. no choice up untill this one matters. And there are a lot of options for the ending so you better be reay to replay the game at leadt 8 times to get them all, even though you already know how everything will turn out regardless of your choices.

The main problem I have is the number of choices overall. They are few and far between, or you'd pick something and it'd be like: ""that's not your real answer, instead you do this.""

Pros:
-Loved the humor, wasn't expecting so many jokes and it's just well written. Went really well with my character. Your evil, but the fun kind of evil. 
-I really liked the writer's style. Paints the picture really well, very impressive, felt like the villain I wanted to play.  
-Planning points was a really interesting and unique idea. You earn them in game and spend them when you feel you need to. These unlock secret options to make your next decision succeed.  
-Interesting world, very good world building. Things were introduced as needed, no long history lessons. 
-There's different heroes, villains, vigilantes, and organizations. Sometimes I found this too much and other times it worked really well.
-Favorite part of the game was chosing a sidekick. Interesting options and consequences. The sidekick acts more like your go to heavy hitter rather than an actual sidekick. 
-Quite a few love interests. Heroes, villains, and vigilantes. There's quite a bit of flirting, but you're not sure if you can trust them. The flirting kinda acts to build up the suspense, is this person gonna kiss me or kill me? 
-You can focus on 2 of 3 different styles of solving problems: ingenuity, combat, or terror. Using all 3 doesn't work out too well.  
-Eager to play again, check out the things I missed. 

Cons:
-You don't have alot of options when designing your character. Tech, combat, or apparition that's it. 
-Picking your lair doesn't matter, the story just makes genetic references to it. 
-Story jumps from 1st heist, to origin, to having a base of operations with anything your can imagine and an army of minions. Didn't see the need for this, it felt like a large part of your story was missing. 
-Not sure how I feel about the final fight, it's a bit too heroic for my villainous taste. 

Final Thoughts:
-Better to get it on sale. If you wanted a more serious tone, than you probably won't like it. But if you're willing to keep an open mind and looking for some laughs it's worth playing. The story hits it's stride mid game.

maybe its nostalgia, maybe its knowing that my roughly half hour wage wasnt being spent on a half hour of linear short story garbage i didnt pay for, then a proceeding 3 hours of denial and utter grief as i try and fail to find any semblance or at least illusion of choice.

It follows a strict format outlined by the company's website - players can chose male or female characters to play, and they will inevitably set 'orientation', as well as giving players an initial set up characterising their player with a custom name, abilities and traits.  In this installment, the player is a super villain... and I have to say it's easily my favourite of the [i]Choice Of[/i] games I've played so far.

The general plot pits your villainous cad, whether he/she be a technogical genius, a military tactician, or a frightening dark prowler, against the equally sinister Dr. Arachnus, who is terrorising the city... and who has made a rivalry with you a particular focus.  Through the various choices you make, Arachnus' plan is outlined neatly, and you're soon drawn against such other (deliberately) cliched and outlandish characters as The Drake, The Countess, and Agent Steelheart.  Whether your villain robs a bank with smoke and mirrors, hides naked in a vat of flour to make a raid (don't ask), or planting nanobots into the mind of a corrupt politician to ensure their later compliance, the acts of villainy you commit are yours to command!

The game is simple.  No graphics, no mess, no fuss.  You read a page and when the page ends you get a choice.  When you take your choice the story will take you in a different direction.  Certain choices give you certain 'Planning points' that you can spend on restricted choices later - you earn them for being particularly menacing or clever.  It is possible to 'die' in the storyline so it's important to get as many advantages your way as possible - whether it be hiring a team of supporters to eatch your back, or amass enough planning points to get yourself out of whatever trap you find yourself in.  Along the way, choices give you stats, and these stats can also be used to influence the choices, especially towards the end.  Pay attention to what technological terror you're contstructing!!!

Those looking for a straight laced plain jane comic book style story are going to be disappointing.  Instead, [i]Diabolical[/i] plants it's own tongue firmly in cheek.  Yes, your villain can do some utterly dastardly deeds.  The plot whilst filled to the brim with humour is ultimately quite serious, but along the way a good dose of camp and slapstick is played for jollies.  Ultimately, despite how amazing you make your villain, you can't get away from the fact that they're just a little bit... rubbish.  And that's OK, because your villain will ultimately become the King / Queen of Crime... 

Ultimately [i]Diabolical[/i] won't cater to all tastes as some will find it's light-hearted banter too comical, but others will revel in the pomp and circumstance, finding a well-written great story pitting you firmly in the driver's seat.  Ultimately for every time your character is defeated in an ignominious way, you'll find a super dark twist reminding you that being a villain certainly doesn't make you the hero!  One of [i]Choice Of's[/i] best and therefore recommended if you don't mind the format.

Choose your minions, pick your lair, decide on what kind of weapons you want to use, and don't forget to spend some downtime with your goons at your underwater lake (bingo has always been a favourite).

[i]Diabolical[/i] is a beautiful homage to the stereotypical comic book or TV cartoon villain, and now you can take on this role for yourself.

+ Also includes a few more serious moments amongst all the light fun
+ There's plenty of interesting villains (and heroes) around who (1) gossip about you, (2) are in your way, (3) want to kill you or (4) want you to join them
+ The possibility to have a threesome in space

- At 130,000 words, it's relatively short, and you can finish it in ± 1.5 hours
- The choices aren't very imaginative, and sometimes don't really have impact on the story
- There is little depth to the characters, including your own
- Limited romance options
- No save points and no skip options

Outside of action scenes the players choices have only superficial effects in the story.

Choice A:  The writers preferred choice
Choice B:  Different way of going about the same thing as Choice A.
Choice C:  A legitimatly different option from Choice A that will autofail if chosen.

But far far worse than this is the action scenes.  Every action scene is the same sequence of choices:

Sequence 1
Choice A:  Action
Choice B: different action
Choice C: Joke

No matter what choice you chose in Sequence 1 the game says ""Psych you were hit/fell down/etc. while trying to decide"".

At this point you probably are a bit confused, so let me dissect the issue; In a ""Choose your own adventure"" game you are the main character, your choices make your personal out comes and paint a picture with the brush of your psyche: the game is a sandy beach and you the castle building child, each castle is different, yet all are clearly castle inspired by medieval architecture. In ""interactive light novels"" however, this is not the case; these games are more of showing you a(n) (almost) linear story, yet allowing you to be a part of the story, getting you attached to characters based on your actions, not to mention letting you feel the impact of the story first hand instead of the second hand method of traditional novella. Yet these two are not completely isolated from each other, rather they represent a spectrum of possibilities for games to exist in. Examples of games that heavily focus on only one side are: ""Long Live The Queen"" and ""Monster Loves You!"" for ""Choose your own adventure"" and ""Zombie High"" by Delight games llc for ""interactive light novels"". 

This game, while wearing the mask of  ""Choose your own adventure"", upon close inspection is somewhere around the middle, casting a wide net in a manner of speaking. A visible blow, in my opinion, to the overall sense and game play as this identity crisis chips away at a solid and enjoyable core.

Despite my criticisms (including the fact that I still don't know if the game has RNG or runs on a flat number based skill check), I love it.

Very good writing. Seems to be able to go from serious to silly without much clash. Also, the writing is just immersive to the extreme. It's so illustrative that I forget I'm actually reading. It's really good value for money. I always say that if you enjoy a dollar per hour [USD] of gameplay than you should safely recommend the game.

All-in-all, it's pretty goofy, and wears its comic book inspiration on its sleeve, to the extent that it even tells you to read about name-dropped heroes and villains in back-issues of their own fictional comics, and I mean that in only the best way.  Taking the ""pragmatic"" choices are the sane ones, but I can't help but laugh and keep picking the ""theatrical"" choices that involve burning the money you stole, volcano lairs, and other feats of ludicrous supervillainy done more just because it would be hilarious than for any real purpose.

... Just don't expect to take any of it serously. In the opening, a security guard gets the drop on you with a gun, and you can somehow chloriform her before she can fire a shot at you... from several feet away, when she was behind you, and already had her gun out and ready to fire... So yeah, Rule of Cool and Sorting Algorithm of Evil is in full effect, and practical skills are useless against the Awesome But Impractical.

There are flaws (the ending achievements are mostly determined by one big choice at the end with your previous decisions not preventing you from choosing any option or unlocking ones from you) but the sheer ludicrousness of some of the things you can do and experience make the experience awesome and enjoyable. For example, there's a subplot about a pair of anchors who have a failing on and off marriage, a rural cop who has more ordinance than small countries, and school kids who will help you steal gold.

The supervillainy/heroics are closer to something like Darkwing Duck, rather than your standard DC/Marvel parody.  The story can get dark (and there's even a lethality score to help represent  your bloodshed) but even the darker aspects aren't explicit. 

One thing I really apprecciated was the ""planning point"" system. While there are decisions that are locked behind your past choices (for example: If you didn'tenslave a character, you can't use them when an opportunity presents itself), there are also locked choices that require planning points.  You acquire them by showing your ability to gain resources or favors from NPCs.  Locked choices that require PP allow you to take flashier options to sometimes use all of the other options at once.  It's a fun mechanic and gives replayability to the game since there aren't enough points to cover all locked choices)
