The strategical layer has relatively little depth other than balancing between growth and defense/offense, which in itself is very finnicky as it's extremely difficult to judge effectiveness of ship loadouts in any way.

Part of the above, is the fact that during battle, whether missiles get shot down or not seems extremely random, and extremely impactful. If your enemy can deploy ships with bigger missiles than you, you're likely to lose a ship or two off the bat, and after that it's just several minutes of ships whittling each other down.

There is also the technical problem of transition between menus/views taking as long as several seconds, which just adds to the frustration.",1546106803,1546106803,False,2,0,0.525738179683685303,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sector 724 seems to have flown right under the radar of everyone on Steam! I feel for the developer here, because this game has more going for it than a large number of the other titles that were release mid-April. There are a couple of other reviews here, but these are in Russian. So I thought I'd take the chance of purchasing this game at the low asking price to see if I can help out in the form of an English review.. Please note I am still learning the game, so will update this review as necessary the more I play and the more early access takes shape..

_____

Humanity has just discovered a mysterious substance known as SOR, which has lead to a scientific breakthrough in space ships gaining warp capability. The human race has now found their first colonisable planet in the far flung reaches of space. Sector 724. However, the Human Race is still bitterly divided, and every powerful Business Corporation that is capable of space flight is now in a bitter power struggle to obtain more of the SOR resource. With Earth's resources dwindling, the Earth Council has tasked these corporations to reach Sector 724 by any means possible. So long as they follow certain rules. 

It is now the responsibility of the player, a member of one such corporation, to continue to explore the territories closer to earth and fund a new colony in Sector 724 in the name of their employer. However, since every other space fairing corporation on Earth has the same mission as you. The war for supremacy will not be an easy one.

So at its core, Sector 724 is a Turn based Strategy game. Players will start as the dominant Corporation with 7 Sectors already under their control. Each sector brings in different additional resources (Ore, Silver Bullion, Gold Ingots, Research Potential and SOR) which funds the war effort in different ways per turn. Whilst Ore, Silver and research are consistent, SOR harvesting can fluctuate every turn and Gold is only obtainable in certain sectors or in battle.

Every Turn begins with a Real Time battle with a random corporation. Unfortunately however you never know exactly who you are fighting. It is pretty much you Vs the rest of the world. The core difference is more down to the fleet composition which can contain anything from a couple of fighters, upto 5 huge fleet destroying battleships. Depending on how many ships are in a sector, you can select 5 ships of your own to go into battle with, although it is recommended you have the best and most powerful where possible, otherwise you will get torn apart. And you will, often, since the enemy composition and number of ships appears random and often scales with your tech level. If you lose a battle, you lose a sector. If you win a battle, you get to choose a neighbouring sector to conquer.

Battles are however a simple affair, and control is limited to a few factors. These are speed, direction, weapon and shield energy management, Tactical nuclear missile fire rates, Ship reactor overcharge (which damages ships) and the ability to retreat. Battles last anywhere upto 5 minutes unless a fleet retreats, is fully destroyed or the designated flag ship of the fleet is destroyed before the rest. Fleets can move about their own space, but the Earth Council refuses ships to enter enemy sectors in fear of all out war and the council being overthrown.

Each victory or loss also comes with an approval rating from the Earth Council. At early stages it is +2 points approval for a win, -1 point approval for a loss. This can also dramatically impact your funding from the Council as time goes on. Therefore it adds the pressure to be victorious as much as possible early on, as early funding is crucial to the arms race you will engage in.

If you are lucky to win a battle. You will have a chance to upgrade your ships current weapon design blueprints or research new tech and ships. If you fail in battle, you are stuck with the same tech you had before the battle and have to wait next turn. Once you have done this, you can outfit your ship with the new tech to get the edge in the next turn. You also have access to the shipyard to build new ships for existing sector defence, or to replace ships that have been destroyed, or you have assigned to new sectors.

The other option open to you is Sector 724 itself. In this screen you are tasked with sending harvested SOR to the new colony itself to improve development ans supply. The more you supply the sector with SOR, the more funding in Silver Bullion you receive for the war effort. This is the most important screen as funding the colony to maximum is the ultimate goal to win the game. This is also the location for trading with Earth's Council. Depending on market prices of SOR and the laws of supply and demand, you can purchase extra SOR for additional Silver Bullion to get to your goal faster. Or instead of shipping SOR off to the colony, you can sell it for Silver to fund your war effort at home. So finding the careful balance is required in order to win the game.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*] The game has solid foundation and potential. What currently exists is very much playable and the game can be completed from beginning to end.
    [*] Game Stability is rock solid. No crashes at all during the time I've played.
    [*] Even though the developer has claimed that Early Access only has basic content. There's enough depth within for multiple playthroughs.
    [*] The tutorial, whilst not too well translated from Russian to English just about gives you enough to understand the mechanics and get you on your way, and even takes you through a typical turn order.
   [*] What sound and music that exists really fits in with the mood and ethos of the game and is pleasant enough to not feel grinding.
[/list]
[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
    [*] The game is made in Unity. Whilst this is not an issue for most people. Some people just don't like Unity games. So if you're one of those, you're not going to be converted here.
    [*] Translations from Russian to English are weak at best. Whilst you can read the text and get the general understanding of what is being said. Translation likely went through Google Translate. Grammar is terrible, spelling mistakes are common and some things make no coherent sense whatsoever.
    [*] No difficulty levels. Quite simply put, due to the random nature of this game. Such as fleet composition and the game deciding which sectors your next battle takes place in, you're either going to win easily, or get terribly murdered. Difficulty is all over the place. So if you detest RNG, stay away!
    [*] The game with some screens the UI looks nice, it looks relatively professional as can be with Unity graphics limitations. However some of the screens and UI still looked tacked on and unfinished. This is still early access, so this will change.
    [*] Another Early Access restriction is the content element. Whilst you will likely have multiple play throughs, the game is very likely to offer an all too similar experience between games. Content will sort this, so this will hopefully no longer be an issue come full release. The same also applies to the sound effects and Soundtrack. They are a little thin on the ground at the moment.

You will get your money's worth out of Sector 724 with a few games played. Does it have legs to carry it in the long term? Only time will tell. However I will give this game a positive review at this point in time as the potential is there and the price is low enough to not be an insult to your wallet should you wish to give it a go. And I suggest you do.

Whilst the game isn't super amazing at the moment. It still stands as a Good one. Chances are you've already purchased a couple of games on Steam or a bundle. They are likely games that are far worse than Sector 724. It's a rough gem that does need a lot of polish. But does have the potential to be a rather unique indie title.",1463173383,1463173404,True,22,1,0.631987452507019043,0,True,False,True,False,,,
