The weapon animations are also awesome, but there are some significant issues I’d like to address;

[list]
[*] The game requires quite a lot of patching to actually run on modern-day hardware.
[*]The actual engine is fairly unstable, especially when going through tight spaces, driving over rough terrain, or during seismic events.
[*]There’s a significant amount of fog in most indoor areas, making CQC a bit of a pain.
[*]The tutorial teaches you about certain buttons which can only be activated via vehicular combat, but I never encountered a single one throughout the campaign.
[*]It seems like the amount of armour your car gets is entirely dependant by your speed, which makes it incredibly difficult to kill certain enemies.
[*]Many of the later levels don’t provide anywhere near enough pickups, making some sections almost impossible. I hate cheating in games that I haven’t played before, but I don’t think I would’ve been able to finish the final boss fight without activating god mode. Even the penultimate level requires a fairly conservative mindset if you’re planning on escaping at the end, so kudos to those who played through the whole game legit.

It's fast-paced and has some interesting ideas up it's sleeve for sure. It seems a bit ambitious but unfortunately seems to have either rushed production values or not reign them in properly.

First I'd like to briefly point out the good I observed in my experience:
*Lovably hokey voice overs (Love me some cheezy VO which was common back in the day!)
*Lots of cars-- and they all look really cool!
*Fun to toy around with the cars and their unique weaponry
*Being able to drop in/out of your vehicle any time you like
*Graphical aesthetic. Minimalist, but nice.

Now, as cool as these features are in the game, it has some extremely annoying pitfalls that are simply impossible to ignore which I feel need further expanding upon to get an idea for why I'm unable to give a recommendation on this title:
*Accessibility: Getting this old game to run is a bit of a hassle and you have to know what you're after. There's some guides to help with that, but some of these issues out of the box are quite inexcusable for a modern re-release. The game is crash prone, riddled with FPS issues and countless other problems I had even after patching it with various fan-fixes. 
Now personally I don't mind this but it could be a big turn away for many players I can imagine.
*Level design: The level design is pretty awful, but the missions do go by fast so sometimes you're too immersed in the carnage and the mission ends before it can become too cumbersome...Usually. Maps are generally 'large' but you can sweep right by them due to how fast your vehicle can tread around. Geometry is basic, especially interiors which look downright abysmal, even for the late 90s.
*Story: The story is just fluff on top for the carnage. There's nothing here really-- it's very basic Fallout/Mad Max post-apoc gang chaos and that's about all there is to it.
*FPS/On-foot mode: There is no camera sway, no footsteps, VERY little feedback in this mode. Usually the only way I'd know I was even taking damage is the health indicator flashing at me (and on higher resolutions, even less noticeable...) 
This was a horrible design choice as several points in the game you are -forced- to go on foot. This was a pretty big let-down for me as this feature seemed like such a treat at first, but in practice it falls apart completely and feels cheap.
*Vehicle controls: This is a pretty bad one. Vehicles are fun to play around with, but when actually controlling them mid-combat they are very awkward to maneuver quickly enough, get caught on terrain, or bump to the point you're flying off the ground constantly. I even had times when the game just flat out broke and I launched through the terrain or dropped through it. Ouch.
*AI: The AI in this game is extremely erratic and stupidly fast/responsive in vehicles, and the on-foot AI is basic-- but in all the WRONG ways. Half the time they won't even notice you, the other half of the time they notice you TOO quickly. It's horrendously unbalanced and bipolar to the point you will become frustrated due to lack of challenge, or way too much, way too quickly, which brings me to my next, and biggest point...
*Difficulty curve: This is the part that bothered me the most. 
The final quarter of the game is a complete chore. The game's difficulty spikes suddenly and absurdly in the final 4 or so missions which becomes wearisome -very- quickly and the smallest mistake costs you your rig -and- your health all in one swoop.
It is incredibly unforgiving if you mess up, and with how awful the controls can be, this happens a lot beyond your control. 
The AI issue mentioned above makes this all so much worse. Car dogfights are supposed to be fun, you'd think? Well, not in this game-- at least not once you get mid-way through the game. You're offered little to no time to actually enjoy the new rigs you're given as the slightest error means you're dead due to how ridiculously fast combat gets. Combat becomes incredibly annoying for all the wrong reasons. Enemy vehicle reaction time is stupidly high (also, screw those super tanky turrets. ""What were they thinking?"") and the moment they see you nearby, or you shoot them they tend to lash back in milliseconds. It's absurd. They also tend to tail you so aggressively that it becomes impossible to have fun swooping on them or getting the jump on them. 
Perhaps some enjoy the brutality here, but I found it lazy design as these same vehicles often got stuck running into a wall or debris without knowing how to back up. So I call bad AI design on this one that results in artificial difficulty and redundant trial and error...
*Carjacking claim is misleading: In this game you can't even car-jack until a good deal into the campaign from what I gather, and even then it's limited to a special EMP-based ammo you need to find in missions. You can only ever hold one at a time, and usually if your car blows up, you're dead in seconds in the later half of the game, so why even bother with this feature at all if it gets you killed 90% of the time? Terrible design choice, here.


All in all it's a game I really wanted to like and loved the concept for, but ultimately it fails, especially mid-way and never recovers that initial steam it has going in the first few missions. You just aren't given time to really -enjoy- the vehicles, you don't even get to select them yourself! Not directly on a per-mission basis anyway. If you're really a completionist and must play every car-combat based game or FPS-like out there I suppose you could do worse, but this certainly isn't in the top by any stretch of the imagination. Just know what you're getting into and expect some frustration.",1610811011,1610811011,False,5,2,0.577873468399047852,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[u]Perspective of 1999 Review:[/u]
[b]Redline[/b]'s main attraction is its ability to mix car combat with first-person shooting. After controlling a vehicle or turret and using each ride's unique weapons, you can exit at anytime, and the game transforms into a first-person shooter with ten different on-foot weapons. The first-person elements works better in enclosed areas or buildings, as seeing an enemy's car coming straight towards you is unsettling. The only way (except for accurate aim with one particular gun) to battle a vehicle is, of course, with your own vehicle.

The gameplay itself is superb. As mentioned, the mix of the two genres flows perfectly. Although on-foot is your basic running and jumping (and left-right rolling, if you wanted to confuse someone), vehicle controlling takes a moment to grasp. Although the default settings may need to be tweaked, you would normally free-aim your weapon cursor with the mouse, and use your keyboard to drive. Driving is straightforward to learn, but the only odd thing is the sliding mechanism. The vehicle, no matter the size, all stops and slides the same. Most vehicles have multiple front weapons and a singular back weapon, and there's a large variety in the game (some have side-door weapons too, which is the hardest thing to control).

In the single player campaign (which has a lackluster yet passable gangs-in-wasteland story) the missions are linear, but not to the point of staleness. One mission has you racing the clock in an intense drive through a canyon. Another mission has you gunning your way to the heart of a rival gang's headquarters in the middle of a dystopian city. Other missions mixes up numerous objectives, such as hostage rescue, destroying a particular object, or defending a spot, to name a few. The story is told through intermission cutscenes, and although a select few are impressive, the vast majority consists of simple conversation. The AI is a bit predictable, as they are all set on being cannon fodder. Their intelligence is only slightly increased when in a vehicle, as their actions are a tad more randomized. After beating the game, there isn't much replay value. One mission has an alternate ending, and about half the missions has an alternate pathway at some point or another. The game is also covered with secrets and easter eggs, to the point that developer [b]Beyond Games[/b] even created an interactive credits level.

However, the lack of a replay value is saved by the multiplayer aspect. You can play either free-for-all or team-based. Some of the maps are based on the single player, but others are completely new, and yet somehow still fits the overall tone of the game. Having to counterbalance your friends' usage of both on-foot and vehicles makes for a unique online game. Also, the default melee weapon (the sawblade) can actually be used to fly, which makes on-foot navigating a lot easier. Apparently, at first, it was programmed into the game accidentally, kind of like the story of [b]Quake[/b]'s rocket jumps. There is also a crucial multiplayer weapon that only makes brief appearances in single player (the EMP), which if shot at an enemy, it blinds and ejects them from their vehicle; thus, you can commit grand theft auto in the wasteland.

The graphics are fine-tuned and impressive, with bright explosions, numerous gibs from a corpse, far draw distances, and unique atmospheres differing between missions. Although the overall game is dystopian, the locales are distinguished, such as an old airport, a converted military base, a religious gang's church, and the obvious Stadium City to name a few. The sound is adequate, as the guns sound different enough to figure out what you're being shot with, and the music is a good dose of industrial metal during crucial moments. The voice acting (sans the friendly boss character) is a bit amateur though.

Overall, Redline mixes car combat and first-person shooting quite well. The setting is accurately portrayed as a dysfunctional wasteland, and the variety of the weapons and vast array of vehicles helps to submerge you in that world. The single player may not give too much replay value, but a second playthrough years later (or an online frag fest) will give you a reason to revisit this game.

[u]Perspective of 2020 Review:[/u]
In 1999, the mix of an on-foot shooter and car combat might have seemed cliché, but in reality, no one was really trying it. [b]BattleWheels[/b] was the godfather (the spiritual predecessor to Redline by Beyond Games), but it was an early '90s handheld game that got stuck in time. [b]Necrodome[/b] attempted it, but the game's lack of diverse weapons and cringing graphics made it a flop. [b]Interstate '82[/b] allowed you to get out of the car, but you had a limited choice of weapons, and the third-person camera was laughable. Even years later, it's hard to come by a good on-foot/car combat video game. [b]Auto Assault[/b] in 2006 tried the MMO route, but restricting hostile actions on-foot and a lack of marketing gave it a short lifespan. [b]Rage[/b] in 2010 attempted the blend, but critics pointed at its lack of originality and its inability to focus on particular gameplay elements. [b]Mad Max[/b] in 2015 is another example, but again, the game had its problem of a repetitive environment and confusing mission structure. Almost no games can be perfect, and neither can Redline.

Redline's on-foot can be compared to Quake or [b]Redneck Rampage[/b]. Its movement is fast, the battles are jolting, and there's many weapons. Redline's car combat can be compared to [b]Interstate '76[/b] or [b]Carmageddon[/b]. It's uniquely textured, the controls has a small learning curve, and there's a sense of urgency when battling in vehicles. But, Redline can only be “compared to” and not “exceeds” though. The mentioned games' gameplay elements are on par or slightly better than Redline; thus, individually, Redline does not reinvent anything. It simply presents two solid genres as they're known for.

The graphics aren't terrible, considering it was from 1999. The explosions still look kind of cool and the dystopian world should still be observed. The music isn't too dated either, as even in 2020, it still sounds like a [b]Nine Inch Nails[/b] or [b]Fear Factory[/b] outtake album. Overall, the gameplay is still unique enough to try out, even today, due to the lack of video games executing the two genres well enough.

There are many complaints about both the Steam and GOG versions of Redline. I have written up an extensive FAQ in the appropriate community discussions/message board. It covers the game crashing at launch, slow loading screens, getting multiplayer to work, secrets, and more. A lot of people spend about a minute to try to get a 1999 game to run on their PC, then, they give up and leave a bad review; granted, the publisher should have covered these issues before throwing it onto Steam or GOG. But, since this is the only exposure Redline will ever see in the foreseeable future, sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands.

[i]9.5/10[/i]

[u]Top 3 Pros:[/u]
-The first-person shooter and car combat mixture is very unique, setting the game apart from its peers.
-Atmospheric scenery with only minor complaints towards the graphics and sound.
-Multiplayer that can't be found in this form elsewhere.

[u]Top 3 Cons:[/u]
-Besides multiplayer sessions, not much replay value, with a lack of customization options and no offline arena-based modes.
-The AI always goes into full-on kamikaze while only showing hints of a brain while driving.
-Vehicle controls may seem odd at first, but eventually is a breeze to understand.",1593164706,1593240073,True,11,0,0.661862969398498535,3,True,False,False,False,,,

I'd overlooked this title in the past, thinking nothing of it. Just another '90s FPS, nothing special. Until recently when I saw someone talking about it, and how it was their favourite game. I decided to give it a proper look.

What I found was something that appeared to be RAGE if it were made in the '90s. Being a huge fan of RAGE, I decided to just go ahead and grab it. I ignored the warnings of waiting for a discount and the game not running on Windows 10.

I downloaded a widescreen patch which you can also use to adjust the FOV. Just don't go over 1920x1080 resolution, the widescreen patch is limited in maximum resolution. Also, you may need to tweak the FOV a bit, I settled with 0.15.

Here's a link to the patch: https://kunnollakeittoa.info/asm/#redline

Extract the files from the widescreen patch to the Redline directory and run RedlineConfig.exe to set it up. After that, just run the game from the redlinePatcher.exe. Unfortunately, you won't be able to run it through Steam this way.

The graphics aren't amazing for the time, but they certainly aren't the worst you will find. The game is however rather buggy, with issues popping up from time to time. Thankfully, levels are relatively short and you can easily restart, but I only ran in to two major issues where I had to restart a level.

When you do hear music, it doesn't last for long but it is very upbeat and heavy hitting, which is nice.

Voice acting can sound a bit cheesy at times, but that was something I was happy to overlook.

Gameplay overall is fun, but it can be rather punishing at times and then piss easy a few minutes later. It varies a fair bit, and sadly there is no difficulty selection.

The story is pretty basic, set in a post-apocalyptic future where gangs rule the wasteland. Your character wants to join one of these gangs, and an opportunity to do so finally arises for him.

I can't really say anything about multiplayer as I can't manage to get it working ATM. It does look like it'd be a lot of fun though with the ability to fly around with the melee weapon. 

In the end, this offers more of that RAGE flair which RAGE 2 failed to deliver. It is a rather unpolished experience but if you're a fan of RAGE, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with what was achieved here, back in 1999.",1587452137,1593274198,True,6,0,0.602701783180236816,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Not going to lie - this game is rough by today's standards. You will want to rebind a lot of the controls as out of the box they are awful. And the menus lag like mad.

Visually it is also pretty dire and the audio is bugged so the soundtrack will only play one little song part over and over. And the less said about the voice acting the better. 

However the game itself is pretty action packed, with a great selection of armed vehicles and personal weapons and you can jump in and out of vehicles at will. Admittedly the difficulty can swing from stroll in the park to slogging through hell and the AI can be somewhat wallhacky - with some weapons having the ability to one shot you!

One really nice touch is that there are even different cockpit views each vehicles as well as the usual outside the car cameras.

[u]What I liked about the game[/u] 
[list]
[*]	The game had some pretty awesome looking vehicles.

[*]	Driving around, killing enemies and blowing up vehicles, can be quite fun and satisfying sometimes.  

[*]	Some of the levels where quite good, like the Arena.

[*]	I liked how the weapon you where using could change into different weapons.

[*]	The game is short. 

[*]	The game has training levels. 

[*]	Interesting story, sadly let down by everything else.  


[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u] 

[*]	Buggy and glitchy. The game kept repeating the same song over and over again; playing over the cut-scenes and over songs. Enemies can shoot through walls when driving vehicles. Animations are a bit messed up, especially when the troops holster there weapons, and the weapon just goes completely through them.  

[*]	Moving around on foot isn't practically pleasant. If you touch any obstacles; even slightly, it will slow you right down or stop you completely. I suffered from motion sickness throughout the game. 

[*]	Ugly weapon models. 

[*]	Boring characters. 

[*]	Crappy boss fights. I wish the game would display the boss's health.  

[*]	I wasn't keen on the cars health bar. A 0-100% health bar would have been perfectly fine. Would have been nice to see a speed dial.  I also wish the map and the radar where permanent. 

[*]	Driving vehicles over flat terrain was fine, but once the terrain started to get hilly and rough, driving becomes almost impossible. When your vehicle goes into the air and lands it's like bloody pinball and crashing into cars is like bumper cars. 

[*]	More power ups for the vehicles would have been nice. 
[/list]


[u]Conclusion[/u]

I bought this game thinking it was going to be like carmageddon; sadly not. Probably the most fun I had in the game was during the driving missions. It's definitely not worth £4.99. If you insist on buying the game, buy it while it's heavily discounted.

-+ скачки в сложности. То легким ветерком летишь сквозь уровни не напрягаясь, то перезагружаешься после каждого выстрела.
-+ если брать время проведенное вне авто, то это типичный шутер того времени. Ничего нового окромя дизайна пушки гг (пушка одна, зато аж 10 сменных насадок к ней), игра в жанр ""думоподобных игр"" не внесла.

Например стандартные рыдваны Красных 6 обладают только фронтальными лазерами, зато бесконечными. Броня тоже слабовата. Фирменные фургоны компании имеют пулеметы  спереди и побокам, есть ракеты наведения и мины. У Леперов, имхо, вообще самые мощно упакованные пушками тачки. Ну и тд. 
Жаль, что из-за короткой продолжительности нет времени прочуствовать это по-настоящему.
+ Музыка. Играет только по праздникам (ну и всю 9ую миссию). Но зато когда музон играет, это очень круто и радостно)
+ Сеттинг. То что успели показать за недолгую продолжительность кампании заинтриговало. Хотелось бы добавки... 
+ Диалоги. Персонажей в игре не так много, реально выделить могу только двух, но зато каких - Боссов Компании и Красных 6, Лидди и Рэнта. Второй в качестве радиоведущего заткнул бы за пояс ФриДога из Фола 3, первый же уморительно гнобит все и вся, особенно достается герою, если тот вдруг посмеет двинуть кони во время поручения Компании.

- название: ""Redline"" (альтернативное ""Redline: Gang Warfare: 2066"");

- разработчик: ""Beyond Games"";
- графика: ""3D"" (трёхмерная);
- движок: ?;
- жанр: шутер (от 1-го лица), гонка (иногда).

Особенности геймплея:
- стиль: олдскул;
- сюжет подаётся между уровнями в виде видео (на движке);
- сохранение в любой момент и автоматическое сохранение при пройдении уровня;
- мир: коридорно-аренный;
- здоровье не регенерируется;
- защиты нет;
- лимита на переносимое оружие нет;
- некоторые враги респаунятся;
- ловушки: турели;
- интерактивные объекты окружения: переключатели для активации заблокированных дверей и различных механизмов; взрываемые бочки для нанесения урона; боевые автомобили для управления;
- бонусы: аптечки для пополнения здоровья.

Недостатки:
- русский язык отсутствует;
- баги: при увеличении разрешения игрового экрана окно меню игры не масштабируется, а остаётся исходного размера; при выборе максимального разрешения игрового экрана на ""Windows 7 x64"" игра часто вылетает после окончания начальной заставки игры.

ИМХО: графика относительно своего года уже отставала, хотя и незначительно; возможность персонажем управлять автомобилем (только не боевым) встречалась уже давно (""Terminator"" (1990) (""Bethesda"")), а боевым транспортом, как минимум, в предыдущем году (""Redneck Rampage: Rides Again: Arkansas"" (1998)); новаторством в геймплее стало то, что персонаж мог выйти из автомобиля через разные передние двери (на соответствующую сторону сбоку), и то, что некоторые из оружий боевых автомобилей были самонаводящимися; то есть шутер не привнёс кардинальных нововведений, но довольно развил данное направление; через пару лет появились ещё водный и воздушный транспорт для управления персонажем (""Red Faction [1]"" (2001)); задания в шутере разнообразные помимо убийства врагов (уничтожение объектов вражеской базы; активация генераторов и т. п.).

Оценка: 4/5.

I'd recommend the game if there were plans on a patch for modern os'. but the devs say nope and this game is only tested and working on win 98 and xp even if you can get it to work on other os's you will have issues NOTE: this is one of those many games that is in a special box of THIS WILL NEVER WORK AGAIN due to modern MS os's not adding any type of VM builds for older os supported codecs or wrappers etc. due to win 7 8 and 10 about 80% of old games using windows WONT ever work, unless its a dos game say goodbye old games DON'T BUY IT. EVEN WHEN IT'S ON SALE. 1/10 to quote a friend who made a recent review.

stay far far away, and when you see ANY game in steam stores that say win 7 or + when its made in the 90's DONT BELIEVE IT unless the devs have patched it, which most devs are defunct (luckily this dev isnt but they have NO PLANS on updates)

frankly they are shocked that steam/valve is selling this in the store as win vista or 7 compatible, according to the devs win 98 se and xp is required. + glide wrappppers galore.

kiss old games goodbye as MS keeps ignoring old windows games

It [i]was[/i] a great game, however it has a lot of technical issues on modern systems so I can't recommend you buy it now. The Steam version is the same as the one on GOG, so don't expect it to be any different there. Both are at version 1.1 (the menu will say 1.0, this has always been the case, the patch never changed that number, so ignore it, and ignore all the people in the forum thinking they have to install the patch. That does nothing.)

The game's level design is pretty bad, but otherwise it was a fun FPS that also had decent car combat (and every car had an interior camera view!). It was fun blowing up bad guys into red chunks, and the way your weapon would transform into different versions was very cool. The animation for turning your assault rifle into a buzzsaw or sniper rifle was always entertaining.

Sadly, as I said, the game has a ton of issues currently. I was able to get it running on Windows 10 (though a lot of people in the forum can't get it to run at all. I did nothing special, so I have no idea why others are having issues getting it to launch), however you cannot change the resolution any higher than 1280x1024, the framerate is capped at 30fps, there's no way to increase the extremely small FOV, and if you use one of the fanmade patches to get a higher resolution (I was able to get it to launch at 1920x1080) the game will not run through Steam. Hence why it says I've only put a handful of minutes in the game.

Among other smaller issues is that the mouse will go wonky in some menus, slowing to a stuttering crawl, making it very hard to change keybindings and graphic settings. The soundtrack is screwed up and every single level starts with the same loud song (track02, which you can find under the Bonus Content folder), which plays for about 2 minutes and then stops. It doesn't play any of the other 8 songs this game has, it doesn't loop that one song, it just.. stops.

That one song will begin playing once a cutscene starts, too, so if you haven't turned it off (it's the ""CD Audio"" setting) then you'll have an impossible time trying to hear any of the characters.

If you don't mind playing with no music, a tiny resolution, mouse issues, and the often crashes, then it's a fun game. The level design is, as I said, kind of awful, and you'll get lost a good bit of the time. But the weapons are fun, the vehicles handle nicely, each one has an interior view, and the characters are pretty goofy and entertaining, especially whoever voiced Bork. Goodness, that voice.

Anyway, I can't recommend it, it's too buggy. Not even for the $0.97 it's currently at. I hope that this game sooner or later gets an official patch to fix at least a handful of the issues I've mentioned, but until then just play something else. You aren't missing too much. This is an entertaining, but altogether forgettable game.

If you really need some Redline in your life, why not just listen to some good ol' King Kobra?

15 Minuten gespielt und ausgemacht - das ist im Prinzip alles, was ihr zu einer Anti-Kaufempfehlung dieses Spiels wissen müsst.

Redline möchte gerne 3rd-Person-Fahrsequenzen mit 1st-Person-Ballerabschnitten verknüpfen, scheitert aber nach allem, was nach der technischen Skizzierung dieses Models auf dem Papier kommt - nämlich in der Umsetzung. Das Spiel ist zwar aus den 90ern - und deshalb noch nicht für WASD-Steuerung optimiert, aber was mich wirklich wurmt, ist die Lenkung des Wagens, mit dessen MG-Geschützen wir andere NPCs über den Haufen fahren oder den gegnerischen 4-rädrigen Blecheimer mit einer Chuck-Norris-Explosion im Level verteilen. Unser Wagen steuert sich einfach viel zu schwammig, die Gegner-Erfassung ist viel zu steif und U-Turns sind einfach schlecht zu machen - das hat seiner Zeit Interstate '76 oder '82 noch besser hinbekommen!

Wer von dem Fahrgeballer in riesengroßer, heute total unterirdisch schlechter Umgebung genug hat (hey Devs - in den 90ern mit absoluter Anfangs-3D-Grafik muss (!) man doch erkannt haben, dass die Darstellung von weiten Umgebungen nur wenig taugt, gell? Ja? Ja? Nee? *argh*), kann und muss sich in bestimmten Gebieten vom Sattel schwingen und zu Fuß weiter rennen. Dabei stockt's teilweise komisch und das FOV sieht irgendwie zu rangezoomt aus - ergab bei mir einen sehr komischen Eindruck beim Spielen. Die Gegner-KI ist unter aller Kanone und irgendein Obermotz muss irgendwann auch mal zur Strecke gebracht werden - sogar in Extra-Arena ohne Lebensbalken verlangte er ca. 20 Sekunden Dauer-Ins-Gesicht-Geballer bis er umfiel und die erste Mission damit abgeschlossen wurde. Danach fing das Prinzip in anderer Umgebung wieder von vorne an.

Von einer vernünftigen Story weit und breit nix zu sehen. Die 90er hatten wesentlich unterhaltsamere 1st Person Shooter in tatsächlichem 3D. Half-Life, Sin, Requiem, Kingpin, Soldier of Fortune, etc.
Von Redline habe ich dabei bis dato nie was gehört. Nach meinem jetzigen Test weiß ich auch warum.

Finger weg!

Появилась на Стиме - сразу взял не раздумывая, как дань уважения разработчикам.
Прошел игру еще 15 лет назад. Непременно пройду еще раз, чтобы получить одни из самых незабываемых впечатлений от игр. В Beyond Games не побоялись совместить два жанра, шутера и гонок, чтобы выдать отличный во всех отношениях продукт. Хоть технологии того времени и ограничивали разработчиков, многое компенсировалось творческим подходом и хорошей фантазией.
В Redline 12 уровней (миссий). Они небольшие, но разнообразные. Разумеется, ныне графическая составляющая игры выглядит архаично и оттолкнет подавляющее большинство игроков. Но геймлей, старый добрый геймплей, даст фору и современным, пусть не ААА, но корявым early-access инди так точно. Здесь нет никакой регенерации здоровья, только аптечки. Нет чекпойнтов, но есть сейв в любом месте. Враги достаточно умные и стреляют метко. Быстро пробежать игру не получится.
Отдельно следует похвалить разработчиков за покатушки на автомобилях. Управление ими сделано очень хорошо. Даже сейчас такое встретится не часто. Конечно, в современных играх, есть поправка на рельеф - в Redline местность все-таки в большинстве своем плоская. 
Из особенностей оружия выделил бы шокер для автомобилей. При помощи него можно выкурить водителя из вражеского транспорта и самому завладеть им. В свое время было потешно.
Мультиплеер тоже хорош. Его минусом назвал бы большие арены как для малого числа игроков.
