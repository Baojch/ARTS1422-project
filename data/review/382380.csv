Beautiful artwork and music, and the story has many interesting ideas.

Exemple (Obs might spoil a bit.)
Bird guy start to talk like Lizard guy like they are good friends, even though they hardly spoke to one another AND he had betrayed us just 1 hour earlier.

This is an absolutely amazing, gorgeous JRPG that had me hooked from start to finish. The beautiful hand painted backgrounds really breath life into this game. The main character may be a silent protagonist, but you really feel for her and all of her companions. There heavy themes of racism that this game tackles as  well as people abusing power both for personal and public gain.

The combat is also unique for a JRPG. While it is standard turn based battles like final fantasy, the interactions with the enemies based on the various damage types you do is very unique. e.g. If an enemy has a shield, you can do blunt damage to them to have them lower their defense. If you're fighting a plant, you can do fire damage so set it on fire which makes it more vulnerable. Each and every fight is like this, where you pick and choose your damage types to try to find out what the enemies are weak to. BEWARE! If you do not do this, you will die. This is actually a very difficult RPG and you need to take full advantage of enemy weaknesses to succeed in battle.

I think this game is easily a 9/10. My only complaint is that there is no native controller support and you have to set up controller support through the steam settings. That and that there are no cloud saves, so I had to stream from my main PC to my steam deck to keep the same save file.",1669409063,1669409063,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Though the game has many bugs (most of the game breaking ones I found can be fixed by playing the game in compatibility mode for windows XP by right clicking the game file and finding the setting in properties),  I did manage to finish and love this game! The story and world was dark and engaging. There were many unique game mechanics that i felt help balance and keep me interested in the combat. There was also a lot of optional content in this short and linear game.

The amber throne's world has a history full of conflicts and wars. It felt fairly realistic and many of the characters have grim struggles of their own. Overall the different races accross the small world had different cultures and mannerisms. This world was fun to explore and learn about.

The game had several systems i had not seen in other games. Healing items that could only be used from the menu outside of combat often provided exp boosts for so many battle turns. This encouraged me to use inventory items that i may have hoarded and never used otherwise. Some characters even had passive abilites to learn that doubled the effectiveness of healing items. This kept early game healing items from ever becoming completely useless. The crafting system was also offers many different equipment, permanent stat boost items, and great restorative items to craft at new locations with old equipment and items. I very rarely sold things as many things had a function in crafting. My only major complaint here is some of the plants used as potion ingredients were so beautiful and well drawn that they didnt look like things i could pick up and put in my inventory.

Overall this was a great linear game with hidden goodies along the way. The game is very close to 15 hours long so its realistic to finish even if you dont have a lot of time to game. There were a few points where i was lost on where to go next but once you find where to go the plot strings you through the next locations in a very linear fashion. There were many hidden shops, tiny side areas, and even some key items needed to face an optional boss.

Overall the music and soundtrack for this game speak for itself as heavy strong points but the game has a lot of small things i liked and mentioned in this review that i felt made it a fun experience.

The Amber Throne story wise is meidcore at best with simplfied combat.  Characters could use more skills than what's provided.  The graphics are breath takingly beauitful and all the art is hand drawn.

Is it like the Amber Throne hovering above? At least it is true, that man has no control, even over his own will. [/h1]

Amber Throne is a neat little jrpg that can take up to 15 hours at least. Yea that's on the storefront, it's true, and at just $15 is a worthy pick up in my opinion, if you can withstand the fact the fullscreen feels super zoomed in and a fixed 640x640 resolution.

That technicality aside, graphics wise it's very pastel to water color styled. It comes to life with the scenery and the sprites in battle. Creating an interesting ambience that betrays the somber, poignant, and almost bleak story. The music helps set this up, which can also be a make or break point, you can turn off the music if it's not to your liking. I say this because recorder isn't for everyone, but the strings are really well done. A lot of the tracks are enjoyable, in my opinion. And the overall quality is a higher cut than what I was expecting for an RPG maker game.

Which speaking of, I point this out because the Amber Throne is basically a powerful wish making device, and as such various civilizations have forged dependence, over-reliance on it. A utopia, eternal life, power and domination, survival and prosperity, everything in between. And they all fell apart when they forgot to enjoy life while they enjoyed its power, yet they continue to seek its power, and care not who they step on to get it.

It's a harder hitting story in that regard. 
A few weaknesses to this game is things don't always make sense in where you're going, you might accidentally backtrack, or wonder around in circles until you get it. This is mostly due to how 'clutter' is arranged, as at one point I wasn't aware a statue hand had just enough pixel space for you to get through, not until I tried everything else to narrow it down.

The other is grammar. Harpsichord sometimes ends up misspelled. There are a few other words here and there where syntax doesn't match up. but it's rare, so it gets a kind of a pass I'd say. The one last issue is there is a rare bug where the ground goes totally black, but this can be fixed by exiting and re-entering the game.

One issue that may make or break is sometimes the battle system is a bit odd, how many effects just turn off upon receiving damage, making some healing effects unusable, meaning a reliance on items, meaning your one guy takes a turn to not attack. And you only get to field 3 people out of a total of 5. It's not unplayable, it just feels wonky, oddly set up. 

So if you're looking for good fights, you're better off looking elsewhere. If you want to experience a story and the world it's set in and the plight of it all, this is for you. All in all not too shabby, especially for the price.",1610416072,1610416202,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is very unique.  It certainly differs from others with its artwork, OST/music and gameplay.  So much work was put into this one and it really shows.  The story keeps you guessing and you see it either via text and animated pictures.

Of course this is a turn based RPG, but it uses its own style of combat/weaknesses/defenses.  I didn't even have to go nuts with picking ""the right skills.""  YOU pick what YOU want.  Really.  There is no grinding.  You don't have to.  The enemies don't respawn... unless you activate a specific statue, but then again, I made it to the end on my ""fun having skills"" alone.  If I can do it, you can definitely do it!  After I found a grindable enemy: I did so for fun.  It is amusing to be overpowered for the end boss.  Heh Heh.

Oh right, the story.  It isn't light and fluffy... let's just say that.  It is heavy and weighty and you have to think. Mainly because the text is written in a very smart way.  Will you be upset?  It depends on your take of things, but you gotta look on the bright side: after you figure out what it is.

There is lots of gameplay and optional/hidden quests/enemies, so you will be going at it for a while.  Go on, enjoy it.  Have fun with this unique style and then afterwards, you can even have a debate on what exactly do you think all of this means.  Thank you for a really interesting game!!! =) :D :>


I came back to mention the following: ""Sunken City Eye 2"" -> If you bring up the menu, you get a blackout screen.  You either gotta restart or just find the ladder.  Once down the ladder: the game is fine.  There was also a guy in ""Ohka Ruins 3"".  After you do the quest for him and come back through: he is officially stuck in a side wall.

All of the individual artwork and animations are fairly impressive for an RPG Maker game, the music is a nice touch; the combat actually is quite decent for how simple its framework is. But contrary to how genuine the visuals look, the writing itself is just primitive. The world design feels very much like something a creatively inclined adolescent would write up. It's honestly not bad, but it's not something I would want to dedicate over ten hours or dollars to. The naming of various things is a more obvious sign, such as bland and simple titles like the white-robbed sages. That doesn't sound at all like something grown adults would choose to name a powerful and respected council of government. Meanwhile the story introduces various unexplained lore and unexplained events that leave the player in complete ignorance, it just moves so fast and absolutely nothing is explained. There's no sense of mystery or wonder, it's just confounding in a way that makes the story less enjoyable because it's not understandable. It feels very much like it's trying to be a deeply written world but it's just not crafted well enough to get there.

The primitive world design is amplified by such events as the player infiltrating a city by simply walking to the right of the front gate, climbing up some walls and dropping down. That's just not how reality works, you don't infiltrate a fortified city by just climbing over some rough patches on the wall; especially not directly beside the front gate as well. They try to validate it by saying the guards haven't found this place yet; but it's literally right beside the front gates. There's even a woman sitting on the walls playing a flute over the city, and they say the guards have never noticed this place. It's just not a believable or logical thing to have happen, which is why it doesn't happen in the average story.

The writing itself is simple, when characters speak they all just sound like the developer speaking to the player. They all have the exact same speech patterns, with the exact same relatively simple vocabulary, and anytime they don't it just sounds like the writer is putting on an act to try to make their writing sound a little different. This character says ""you"" they say ""ya"" to make it seem like they have some kind of rough country dialect; and that is the extent of their individuality compared to every other character. The word choice, sentence structure and tone overall is just very shallow.


It's certainly not bad, and as said there is clearly a lot of solid production value in this with a decent combat system. But if I'm going to sit down for an over ten hour story driven game that I paid potentially sixteen dollars for; the writing really needs to be genuinely refined and immersive otherwise the experience isn't either.",1562874281,1563089441,False,4,1,0.546249985694885254,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's all hand-painted and gorgeous, and it alone was what drew me to the game. It sometimes uses default assets for icons and a *single* animation in the end, but for the most part, it is 100% custom.

The story is very interesting and tackles some interesting ideas about how regulations bind us, how we should forge our own destinies, and how you should let go of vengeful desires instead of let them consume you. I don't know if I can really call any part of it ""cheesy"", it felt really original overall, and I had a great time experiencing it. The worldbuilding is also very nice, and I love how many of the characters are written; I *still* want to punch some of the villains in the face, and I'm going to miss reading some of the words of the party members.

The music was *very* nice, having what felt like it had to be around 40-50 tracks, if not more. Each one fits the circumstances you hear it in quite well, and while I do think that some of the ones you hear a lot (such as the overworld theme) can get too repetitive after a while, it's overall very nice. I wouldn't feel bad about buying the soundtrack.

Combat-wise, the Amber Throne definitely tries to feel different compared to most other RPGs. Five characters with a party size of three (although one PC must be in the party at all times), and each party member has 8 skill slots, with about 24 skills to choose from as you wish on each character, means that your party can really be customized a lot. Many enemies are dynamically impacted by creative use of skills, such as using defense-lowering skills to break the shield of one enemy, or using a gun skill to make a soldier bleed as you shot him in the gut. This aspect is really nice for the most part.
However, I did have *some* gripes with the combat;

- In about the last third of the game, the encounters start to feel more like endurance than actual difficulty; you'll go through corridors with enemies faster than you, that you can't avoid, and fight the same encounter of 2 (or 3 sometimes) enemies several times in the span of 30 minutes. These fights DO give you a good amount of XP, but frankly, the game would be better off without them.

- You're given one of the party members, Sirra, about halfway through the game, and the last one, Oboa, in the last *fourth*. Due to the skill system combined with slow levelling, it means that if you don't grind, Sirra will only have about 3 skills until the last fourth or so, and Oboa will have like *one* for the entire game, maybe two. Admittedly, their base skills are pretty good, but this still does make it almost feel like the game wants you to stick with the first 2 party members, Popelle and Nuo, as they'll have way more skills unlocked just through playing. Despite that, I still was able to use Sirra very effectively once I unlocked him; no idea if Oboa would feel tolerable enough, but from what I've seen of his skill list, he sounds like a lot of fun if you grind for him.

- There's absolutely no healing magic (aside from lifesteal). This is kind of nice, because you never feel that there's an ""essential"" party member you *must* have, but it also means that if you don't stock up on healing items, you might not be able to beat a boss you're perfectly leveled for (which, frankly, is most of them - this game doesn't require grinding anywhere from what I can tell), simply due to running out of potions, and have to trek back to a shop. At the end of the game, I had something like 90 or so healing items before the final boss, and ended up with about 60 or so at the end - while it sounds like I overstocked, the final boss just... doesn't actually drain you of them that much? Still, 90 felt *reasonable*, and that's kind of annoying with how much gold that requires you to shill out - you *must* be prepared with too many healing items, or you run the risk of running out.
 
And a last gripe; the game doesn't always make it obvious where you should go. Not in a ""cool explore""-y way, but more like a ""Alright, I've been wandering for 30 minutes with nothing to do, where the hell do I go?"" type of way. Later on, the main character's Journal starts to be a bit more clear about where you have to go at the very end, which makes the last third or so a *lot* easier to actually navigate, but about the second and third fifths of the game can feel like the developers didn't have strong ideas on where to have you go.

Amber Throne é um RPG que se destaca pelos seus gráficos em estilo desenho aquarelado, mas que infelizmente me deixou um gosto bem amargo. Seguem os pontos positivos (+) e negativos (-):

+ Desenhos aquarelados que dão uma beleza única ao game;
+ História ampla;
+ Boa quantidade de itens e equipamentos;
+ Função de crafting para itens e equipamentos;
+ É possível escolher a ordem que você prefere aprender as skills de cada personagem;
+ Boa duração;
+ Músicas únicas;
+ Sistema de combate que encoraja variedade no uso das skills;
+ O jogo e faz se questionar se os personagens principais realmente estão fazendo a coisa certa;

+/- O boss final luta nú;
+/- [spoiler]A Evelyn é bodybuilder;[/spoiler]

- Graças ao estilo de desenho do terreno, muitas vezes se torna difícil diferenciar o que é o que;
- Vários erros de escrita;
- Alguns bugs visuais;
- A música do mapa pode ser irritante;
- A história, embora muito elaborada, é extremamente confusa;
- Você não consegue definir exatamente qual o objetivos dos personagens, pois todas as conversas são excessivamente nebulosas;
- A conversa com NPCs não muda conforme o decorrer da história, fazendo muitas falas ficarem muito fora de contexto;
- Toda a sequencia de lutas do boss final é estranhamente fácil...
- O final foi desanimador para o meu gosto, poderia ter sido melhor trabalhado;
- Não foi um RPG que me deu vontade de jogar desesperadamente até dar final;

Esse game ficou MUITO tempo na minha lista de desejos, e o comprei com altas expectativas, todavia acabei frustrado. Não que o jogo seja ruim, mas deixou a desejar em vários aspectos, especialmente pelo fato de eu dar muito valor à história do jogo e este jogo apesar de ter uma boa história, faz ela se desenrolar de uma maneira terrível.

Gostaria muito de dar uma nota positiva pelo bom trabalho artístico e boa inspiração, mas há pontos negativos em demasia.

Gameplay was okay.  Pretty typical turn-based JRPG.  Liked that there weren't the traditional MP/Mana points to deal with.  Some battles (especially the more difficult ones) definitely require some amount of strategy.  You will encounter some boss battles that may take a couple tries.  

Pacing for character ability growth was pretty okay except for when you got a new party member.  It would take a lot of grinding to try and bring them up to speed with the rest of the party/enemy difficulty.

Story was interesting.  Provided some mystery throughout the game.  That being said, I left the game feeling a little confused about a couple of things.  Possible that I just missed some key points in the game's lore during some of the exposition.  Found myself un-engaged from the story at times, though again that may have just been because I missed some of the story nuance.

The Red kingdom, the kingdom of the humans seek the titular throne. They are not alone in this pursuit, the Sehr empire made up of lizard people is also in the running. The last one in this contest is our playable character Arra the daughter of the last know[spoiler]amber god[/spoiler] , tasked by her father to destroy the throne.

The game’s theme centers on the weakness of the heart, to always seek the most easy and comfortable even to the point that it will hurt ourselves. This is showcased in the use of racism, over obsession of a pursuit or in holding on to stagnant views or ideas. As such the game has a somber or melancholy tone to it.

As for the members of your party, other than talking about the plot points, do not have an active role in game.  In some cases they are interchangeable as they repeat the dialogue.. That was disappointing since you don’t see much of them other than that. The supporting characters are mostly there for the sake of plot progression and  in some cases world building. The minor  characters, other than a few eccentric shop keeps are not much to behold. All of the game’s antagonists in one form or a another embodies the theme of the game than any other character in the game.

Despite the main cast not being at the forefront, the interesting setting and the story and ideas that take place in it make up for that. 

In turns of looks, there is not much to say and that is said in a good way. What you see in the steam screenshots is what you get in the entire game:  hand drawn beauty.The amount of detail especially in the non-in game cutscenes just takes your breath away.

The character animation might have anywhere from one to five frames of animation, which give them a point and click charm. Environmental animation are seen a handful of times, otherwise the game is just a beautiful painted picture. Only down side to the amination is during battle, the party members do have animation for all their actions during battle but, foes will only get stance changes with a few bosses getting non-in game cutscenes for their attacks. It should be noted this reviewer is not a student of animation so take what is said here with a grain of salt.

Due to only having a few rpgmaker games under my belt I can’t say for sure what sound is only to this game and what is shared along with all rpgmaker games. In this reviewer’s time in the game, the sounds did not break the immersion.

When you start up the game, the gorgeous art greets you with a non-in game cutscenes. Along with that is the equally wonderful music. This is the type of music that is heard more often in good standard jrpgs. Along with the visuals, this haunted melody invites you to open and relax your heart for an experience that won’t be forgotten anytime soon. Jasmine Cooper is a gem of a composer; let us hope we will hear more from them in the future.  Goldwood Forest and Goldwood Forest Engaged are  great highlights.

It is fair to say the game’s presentation being one of it’s strongest parts.

The game was made with the keyboard control in mind and since the title screen has a button to show what the controls are for the keyboard, this part of the review shall put more time to talking about controls for the use of a controller, particularly for the 360 controller since this was use in the review. The B button is used for menu and cancelling, the X button is to confirm an action or to pick and talk to someone/interact, for the last button the A button just has to be hold down to run and finally the upper right control stick is to move. There is no way to change the output. It should be advised to put the controller in the the PC before starting up the game. While it is possible to use the keyboard in the middle of the game with a controller in, the other way is not while the game is running.

The world map is small and will get even smaller if a certain side quest is done. However the game will use this to it’s advantage by occasionally changing the map. Other than something that is between the player and the next plot point, the world map holds small places for side quests, world building and some items.

Towns while visually distinct just hold the usual set of items, weapons, armors and inns. Sometimes they have items and other kinds of shops you can find there, but that is about it. While you can talk to the people in the towns and there are some you can give items to, the only place that can be entered are for plot and the above mentioned standard buying stuff.

Dungeons are just a chance to take in more of the art with just more battles. The most that happens was to go one way or the other to fight a mini boss to progress. The last dungeon being the one to be somewhat different. 

Battles, like many things in the game, felt like they are just there to serve the art and the story. It may not be as simple as press A to win, but the player can be left with wanting more. Here is how the battles work. There are six types of attack:  slash, pierce,blunt, blast and the only two elements, fire and lightning.  Some party members have the exclusive ownership of ether fire or lightning. Party members also have an attack type as a default attack.They can get other attack types in the form of skill which can be unlock by leveling up and getting skill points. You damage your foes with their weaknesses in two ways, standard and stance. Standard is well standard weakness the enemy have in general while stance damage will happen when a target is in a certain stance. Upon doing so will result in the opponent changing to a stance that will do more damage to the party, but will leave them in a more vulnerable state. This may not always occur and other types of non-weaknesses attacks may be needed in order to get that stance change.  In battle the turn order can be seen. The most utility this seem to have is trying to figure out when one of the three party members would attack.

Over the course of two playthroughs, it was possible to get by using powerful non-weakness attacks. The above mentioned battle system, gives this game another thing to stand out from other rpgs, just not enough to call it one of the game’s strengths. Other games such as Skybore or Chrono Trigger can give players a better time with their battles.

Some last minute nit picks and things that could not fit anywhere else: keeping your party's equipment up to date was little pace slowing in an otherwise good paced game. This was very apparent near the end game. Crafting while nice to have as a option, could not as used as much as I like due to the scarcity of needed items to use. While there was nothing that made it to the point of exploit or sequence break there were times I could go to parts of places that should not be possible and sometimes Arra can move a bit before a game cutscene can kick in. There were two major bugs that put the game to a standstill. One occured at the [spoiler]end of sunken city. After the boss battle[/spoiler] and the cutscene that follow when I open the menu the screen behind it want black and stayed that way after the menu close. This happen two times in both playthroughs. The second one happen in the middle of a boss battle that takes place before heading to the final dungeon. During that battle the game crashed. The more minor bugs was when I tried to go to the title screen the game just crashed.This did not happen all the time but, it happen often enough that I stop counting after the eighth time.

There are some nooks and crannies that are yet to be uncovered so if you are looking for a heartfelt experience rather than a challenge to overcome with a interesting story that takes place in a thought out world then this game is a good game to get.

I just decided to go through my Steam library and review things.

Playing this game I couldn't ever decide if I really liked the art or not. Maybe it's just not.... that consistent, but that's not entirely true... I will say the backgrounds and characters aren't consistent, seeming to take a different medium. The characters really ""pop"" out from the backgrounds... but I'd seriously hesitate to say that it does so in the right way. It just always looked a little off to me.
I think also the general sort of lack of higher detail and most backgrounds looking rather faded is just something that I don't like. I tend to like more vibrant, distinct colors, and this is very muted, almost like the dark greys and browns that plagued the previous generation.
Another issue is (This may be a RPG maker limitation, which I didn't realize this game was made in) is that characters have very few animation frames. It works in pixel games like older Pokemon titles, but when you have a semi detailed full person that only has 3 animation frames for walking it's a bit visibly jarring.

The music is... fine. Forgettable, but fine.

I don't remember much of the gameplay or story, but to be honest I remember getting extremely bored of the game and eventually just stopping, even though like so many others I REALLY wanted to like it.

I almost wish the game would be remade, streamlined, more interactions, expand the story, add some color and detail to the backgrounds... really give it a proper treatment. I think this game is just a ""Man, I wish this was just... more. Better.""

+Глубокий сюжет, богатый лор внутриигрового мира. 
+Все члены отряда имеют свой характер, свою предысторию, свою философию и место в общей канве повествования.
+Всё в этой игре отрисовано вручную (вроде бы цветными мелками, но я не разбираюсь). Вы не найдёте ни одного стандартного спрайта. Местные пейзажи и сюжетные зарисовки выглядят очень красиво.
+Музыка от Жасмин Купер как всегда на высоте. Обязательно перейдите на сайт исполнительницы и купите этот саундтрек хотя бы за доллар. Такой труд должен быть вознаграждён. 
+Интересная идея с различными стойками для противников и различными типами урона. Скажем, вы сражаетесь против рыцаря. Когда он поднимает щит, он наносит меньше урона, но и получает его тоже меньше, особенно колющего типа. Если в отряде есть персонаж, который наносит дробящий урон, то можно сбить щит, и тогда колющие атаки снова будут востребованы. Противники из дерева будут уязвимы к огню, каменные - к молнии. Такой подход не даёт игроку уныло нажимать в бою на одну кнопку. Всегда придётся думать и планировать. 

С технической стороны же, к сожалению, имеются огрехи:
-Проблемы с балансом. Первую половину игры можно вообще не париться о подборе навыков под различных противников, о грамотных комбинациях, сбиве стоек и баффов. Вы просто будете сметать всё на своём пути. Но вот ближе к финалу сложность увеличится настолько, что придётся нормально так погриндить и заработать на зелья для отряда. 
-Баги. Я не столкнулся с критичными багами, мешающими прохождению, но тут и там попадались мелкие ошибки, как то: непрогрузившиеся спрайты, невозможность крафта определённых предметов на определённом этапе, предметы, которые не добавляются в инвентарь после подбора, ну и так далее.

To support that, we have a turn-based combat system that's very strong and interesting. Not great about giving you clear instructions to figure out what you need to do, but not overly obtuse, and full of fun ideas. Even the times I've died have felt more like I wanted to take another crack at it than like the game wasn't fair. No Grinding either, which a lot of games like this on steam have been leaning towards lately. Fight the enemies that show up, and you'll be all set, though there is the option to grind if you have to.

Story thus far is a bit vague on a lot of seemingly-important hard details, like who your player character actually is, but does a good job engaging you with what's immediately happening, and making those events work really well. And I've gotten enough of a trickle of information that this seems to be a low burn, not information we're flat-out never going to recieve, which is all well and good. It works well, it's definitely got a direction and themes and interesting places to explore, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where it leads.

I've also never seen an rpg that made me yell at NPCs to join my party and then have them do precisely not that (at least for awhile) as much as this game does. I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not, but it's certainly a sign of engagement with the characters.

Would happily recommend to anyone who plays JRPGs like this, it's one of the good ones on steam.",1529801569,1529824287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Das Kerngameplayelement von The Amber Throne ist das Kampfsystem, in dem oben rechts im Bild die Zugreihenfolge angezeigt wird, wobei die Buchstaben die Anfangsbuchstaben der Charaktere in der Hauptgruppe und das Rote X einen Gegner darstellt. Diese wird durch die Agilität der Kampfteilnehmer und deren Aktionen beeinflusst. Techniken, die Aufladezeit benötigen, lassen einen Charakter später zum Zug kommen, als solche, die direkt eingesetzt werden. Meist ist das in der Beschreibung des Skills vermerkt. Am Kampf teilnehmen können bis zu 3 Charaktere, anderen bleiben inaktiv und erhalten weder Erfahrung für besiegte Gegner noch können sie während des Kampfes eingewechselt werden

Gegner haben in The Amber Throne meist mehrere Phasen, die meistens durch bestimmte Techniken beeinflusst werden können und je nach Gegner unterschiedliche Auswirkungen haben. Wenn ein Gegner mit erhobenem Schild zum Beispiel mit einer panzer brechenden Attacke angegriffen wird, senkt er dieses und wird empfänglicher für Schaden. Andere Gegner richten, sobald sie in Brand gesetzt werden zusätzlichen Feuerschaden an.

Das Skillsystem ist ebenfalls ein viel genutztes Element im Spiel. Hier können alle der bis zu 5 Hauptcharaktere spezielle, Charakterspezifische Skills erlernen und ausrüsten, wobei jedem Charakter nur begrenzt viele Slots für Fähigkeiten (Aktive wie Passive) zur Verfügung stehen. Oftmals müssen für einen stärkeren Skill andere, schwächere Skills erlernt werden.

Ein Manko ist die langsame Menüführung. Shops benötigen stets mehrere Sekunden, bevor sich das Interface öffnet. Im Hauptmenü ist es das Selbe. 

Ebenfalls etwas enttäuschend ist der Schwierigkeitsgrad der Kämpfe, da während der Entwicklung offenbar viel Wert auf Taktische Kämpfe gelegt wurde, das taktische Potential der Kämpfe allerdings durch die oftmals eher unterlegenen Gegner und vorallem Bosse unter geht.

Grindlastigkeit ist dem Spiel jedenfalls nicht vorzuwerfen. Gegner erscheinen auf der Karte, es gibt also keine Randomencounter und sofern man stets alle Kämpfe mitnimmt, hat man selten bis nie wirklich Probleme, die Kämpfe zu bestehen. Insgesammt werfen Gegner stets genug Geld ab, um ausreichend Heilutensilien zu kaufen und später sogar Statusupgrades im größeren Stil erwerben zu können.

[h1]Grafik, Soundtrack[/h1]
Die grafische Gestaltung des Spiels ist hervorragend und unter Makergames zählt The Amber Throne in dieser Rubrik wohl zur Spitzenklasse. Ich selbst habe jedenfalls kaum etwas gesehen, was mithalten könnte.
Gegnerphasen sind gut erkennbar dargestellt, es gibt teils sogar animierte Zwischensequenzen und der Artstyle ist konsequent umgesetzt.

Der Soundtrack ist atmospherisch und gut umgesetzt

The Amber Throne ist ein Spiel, das auf seine grafische Gestaltung Wert legt und das sieht man auch. Allerdings schwächelt das Spiel im Gameplay etwas, was in Anbetracht des Aufwands, der in den Artstyle gesteckt wurde, doch schon etwas schade ist. Wer sich an leichten Kämpfen und einem langsamen Menü nicht stört und über solide englischkentnisse verfügt, der kann während eines Sales beherzt zugreifen. Die rund 15 Euro sind meines Erachtens etwas  zu hoch angesetzt, darum eine Kafempfehlung von mir nur unter Vorbehalt.",1508014618,1508014652,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The plot revolves around a mute girl who has a single desire, to destroy the titular amber throne, an artifact of great power which can grant the wishes of those who use it. Throughout the game we see the effects of the amber throne on the various races, whether they have had a chance to use it or not. It paints the throne as both good and evil in equal measures, though ultimately, it becomes clearer and clearer as the game progresses that the throne is more than what everyone assumes it is. Along the way you'll meet a colourful cast of characters, each one having varying stakes in the story. Some feel like the Vaan and Penelo of the story, having little reason to go to these insane lengths with a girl who can't even speak. But overall, the entire party fits well. The biggest thing the game has going for it plot wise, is the metaphors it presents throughout the game, I'd list an example, but I don't want to spoil anything. But suffice to say we get to see each nations wish twisted against them in some form or another, and the execution is beautiful for an indie title.

The combat is as traditional as it gets, turn based with menus. Its alot more streamlined than the classics though, instead of having everyone be able to equip all kinds of items and magic, each character has a list of skills they can unlock as they level up. With a set amount of these abilities being equippable to that party member at any given time, forcing you to pick and choose what way you want to specialize that character, but giving you the option to swap abilities out of combat whenever you like. You can have three of the roster of five characters you'll eventually have by the end of the game on the field at any one time, and can't swap them out mid battle. Each combination of characters works in different ways, since you could have all of the debuffers in one group, or the tank, glass cannon and taunting tank in another, and both will work. My personal favourite combo was tank, glass cannon and spellcaster/healer, but that didn't mean I didn't experiment and have fun while doing so. Combat itself is very fast, normally lasting between two or five rounds in random encounters, to about ten maximum for boss battles usually, with the animations for attacks being swift and visually impactful. What little grinding that you might want to do is made painless because of this.

Visually speaking, the game is a mixed bag. Its all hand drawn, but not to an insane, breathtaking quality, at least not all the time. During combat, the art really stands out, both with your characters, and the enemy sprites. The cutscenes shift in quality, but for the most part they look very nice as well, using a slide show format with the text underneath, giving it a slight storybook feel. The overworld map and overworld sprites for everything are pretty simple, but they aren't bad by any means, nor are they good, they do their job and don't look out of place. Though, it is a bit annoying that the quality shifts so much throughout the game, with one part in particular with the final boss really looking like smudges across the screen. 

The music of this game is very simple, no grand scores or epic pieces. To the end the tunes pick up the pace figuratively speaking and get much better, but for the most part the music does its job and it does it fairly well.

Overall I love this game, its everything I could possibly want from a classic inspired RPG, with some added depth. It isn't an RPG in the sense of dialog options or massive impactful choices, but in terms of combat and character developement. The story is what you'd expect from a classic RPG, but with alot more connectivity and substance. You aren't going from one place to another, doing things to get four crystals of the elements, or stop the evil emperor, or save the princess. You have a goal, and everything you do revolves around it, every boss you fight is directly tied to the main plot. Everything, revolves around the Amber Throne. The best comparison I can think of is Chrono Trigger, minus the time travel. While not as perfect as CT, Amber Throne manages to really be a retro rpg, and something much more at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of classic Final Fantasy style games, or titles similar to them.",1500041573,1500041573,True,8,1,0.607142865657806396,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm not disappointed but I agonize when I think about what The Amber Throne could've been if this little detail hadn't been overlooked...

However, I'll tell you this - The Amber Throne is a remarkable achievement for a 2d JRPG made in RPG Maker. It's beautifully realized in its aesthetic and its identity, bringing us possibly one of the most visually fleshed out worlds ever in RPG history. There's been a lot of thought put into its characters and setting, and that has to be applauded. It also manages to shake the combat experience up too by introducing a simple, but tactical combat system based on stances and weaknesses not found in other turn-based RPGs. Nevertheless, its single biggest flaw is a very critical one, and that flaw grips at my heart strongly, as it is an absolute shame that it exists. Clearly the person who wrote this story put a lot of care in the characters and the lore of this world. You can catch glimpses of the detail in some of the text when it is presented alongside the beautiful artwork but, you're always left guessing at what the text means, as it constantly contradicts itself with its usage of superficial metaphors that imply information more than communicate it. It seems like the writer is trying too hard to prove to the player that it can use interesting vocabulary and, in turn, loses all credibility and cohesion. This is also accompanied by a lot of grammatical errors and mismatched sentences. Characters often state their beliefs and then say something right after that cancels them out. One big case of this is the Sehr Emperor, whose motives are still a mystery to me exactly because of this problem - One second he says his ambition is what drove him to try and take the Amber Throne, making it clear that it was his decision and the next, he talks about how the Throne is an ignoble thing and that he regrets that the thing exists. He then proceeds to continue his chase after the Throne without any hint of the regret he just mentioned. 

These types of moments leave the player confused. I can hint at what the writer wanted to convey, but as I read the text over and over again, I realize that there's not point to re-reading a badly edited story. It's clear to me that whoever wrote this has a very limited understanding of the English language.

The real shame is that there is actually an amazing story here with dynamic characters that shine through their different personalities and motivations. It's painful to watch it become a convoluted mess exactly because of that.

The game is definitely still worth the buy and I recommend it. Just be aware that, even though the story's infrastucture is incredibly well done as well as its lore, the way it's relayed to you is below average, at best.",1491869997,1491869997,True,15,0,0.639111042022705078,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hands down the best (and by far the most beautiful) rpg maker engine game ive ever played. 
If you enjoyed games like final fantasy IV,V and VI or the Golden sun series you will probably love this one too. 

PROS: 
-Charming story and characters, the whole game has a bittersweet tone, wich fits the themes in the story perfectly. 
-Beautifully painted parallax backgrounds instead of the outdated tileset system most rpg maker games use.
-Animated Battlers in a way reminiscent of the golden sun games, there is some depth to the combat system aswell, with enemies varying their defenses and attacks during the battles. 
-Crafting system. 
-Excellent OST

CONS: 

-the game resolution is locked at 640x480, but since this is a technical limitation from the engine, there is little the devs could have done without breaking the TOS of the software. 
-Very little optional content, aside from a secret super boss and some stuff here and there. 
-The game is not very difficult, but it never gets so easy that combat becomes trivial either (unless you really grind for it) 

In conclusion, this is little hidden gem that every jrpg lover should play, it will remind you when japanese rpgs had interesting worlds to explore, with stories filled with dauting themes and a varied cast of characters instead of waifus and pretty boys with impossible haircuts.

What a disappointment. I'm going to tell you right now not to be impressed by those screenshots and that fancy soundtrack, suspend your welling notions of ""Oh this is RPG Maker but it's different! It's not low effort trash!"" You're only right on the front of it not being low-effort, as this is probably the best example of RPG Maker games' failings you might ever play.

Positives first. It's obviously gorgeous in both BG and character design, and the soundtack is amazing. That remains true for pretty much all of the game that I've seen, so props, but unfortunately those two are probably the only real redeeming factors. I'll concede that the gameplay is fun in the beginning, but as it goes on it transforms from ""Standard Turn-Based with a Rock Paper Scissors twist"" to ""Standard Turn-Based with the tedium of guessing what your enemies are weak to and where every fight seems to take too damn long except for the bosses which feel too damn easy.""

The main problem I have is the story. It's gibberish. If it were not for the beautiful art, you would probably be convinced that the person who made this just whacked this out after reading a load of Squaresoft-era fanfiction. It's a case of someone having an idea of what makes a story dramatic or meaningful, but not being able to organize any of it into a coherent set of motivations, causes, and effects. Pretty much all of the major moments of the game befuddle rather than increase your understanding of the world. The characters are all pretty shallow with the main character's motivation changing to something new and equally incomprehensible every time you have to fight a major boss, even the villain's reasoning for trying to end the world just flies over your head. Don't get me wrong. It's not that they don't talk about their motivations. It's not that you don't understand what's happening. It is literally that they will say their motivations outright, that they are attacking you for example and why they are attacking you, and the sentences are worded so badly you have no idea how anything got from Point A to Point B. They blend together metaphors and purple prose and repetitions of pseudo-ominous phrases into a soupy mess of senselessness. This isn't [i]Space Funeral[/i]. There is no excuse.

Don't even get me started on just out and out plot holes. THERE ARE SO MANY: [spoiler] HOW DID AXIS PUT THE PRINCESSES IN THE COFFINS IF ARRA KILLED HIM. WHY DID HE DO THAT. DID IT HAPPEN IN THE SKY CASTLE OR AXIS'S KINGDOM. ARRA'S COFFIN FELL OUT OF THE SKY CASTLE BUT THE REST OF THE COFFINS WERE BACK AT THE KINGDOM. WHY WAS THE SKY CASTLE ALREADY IN THE SKY WHEN THE BIRDS HELD THE THRONE. HOW HAS EVELYN NOT AGED IN 20 YEARS IF SHE'S A NORMAL HUMAN BEING. WHY DID THE RED KING ADOPT HER. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE MINNIKS KILLED THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE SEA WAS POISONED. THAT LITERALLY HAPPENS IN THE FIRST MAJOR DUNGEON AND I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. [/SPOILER]

Whoever wrote this needed an editor or a creative writing class. As a kicker, somehow all of the typos are limited to the big dramatic cutscenes. Three times, they spelled ""delinquent"" wrong. Maybe stop using that word.

The second major issue is the mechanical aspect of the game. It's very buggy. The bugs aren't gamebreaking, at least the ones I've experienced, but they do serve to further ruin your immersion. Plot NPCs being teleported into the walls when you return to areas, sometimes walking into an area and having your character just not appear but being able to move the screen, weird lag on the larger maps, waking up from sleeping and having half of Arra's animation missing so she phases in and out of existence. Your character sometimes clips over the foreground. The combat, as I've said, gets boring. The most tactical the game is is at the very start and then as it goes on it just runs out of tricks. This the RPG Maker that everyone expects, the RPG Maker that is locked to 640p. This game is very much waving the flag of that RPG Maker.

If one of these, story or gameplay, had been clean I would have forgiven it but both of them being [i]really[/i] messy means that even though the game is very good at evoking a sense of nostalgia in me, it would be really dishonest for me to recommend it. I'm right near the very end I think and I'm just fatigued, and more importantly to this review, I don't care. I don't care how it ends because I'm nearly there and I still don't feel motivated to save the frankly poorly thought out world of the game.

Facit: If you want to play a fantasy rpg and got nothing better, you can't go wrong with The Amber Throne, cause its really doing everything fine a rpg has to to, but don't expect anything breathtaking, which is why i wouldnt recommend it.

Advice: Don't try to explore the world too much. there is no interesting additional dialogue aside from the main story and trying to find equipment and/or gold is not worth it. Also it might keep you somewhat underleveled, so the combat is actually a bit challenging.

The gameplay is very nice and runs extremely smoothly, even if its very simplistic. At first it feels like it has some depth to it. Then you realise how few skills you actually get and battles kinda end up being over-simplified as a result.

The games not without its glaring flaws though, as it tends to lag like a bitch in the overworld, especially after leaving the city and running does not work, at all

Anyway:
The soundtrack is amazing and one of the best game soundtracks I heard in a while.

The painted locations paired with the music give the game a very distinct tone and atmosphere, which is the main selling point. The story itself does what it wants to do, it advances well-paced and doesn't drag on at any time. Actually, the endgame feels a bit rushed - after the locations before it, the final locations felt a bit small in scope (I'd have the Tower of Fire and Sky Castle expected to be much larger).

Gameplay-wise, several skills were just useless (or rather: way too similar), but that might in part be a typical RPGMaker issue. Buffs, debuffs and the exploitation of weaknesses could have played a larger role, but ah well. Its typical for most RPGs since the old Famicom-era, so its not really a minus.

Overall I'd say it is constructed around conveying a specific mood - the narrative itself never gets concrete enough and feels content with alluding to its events to support that its mainly about mood, texture.

It works.

Worth a playthrough.

Pour un jeu développé par quelques personnes c'est du beau boulot et ce pour plusieurs raisons :

1) La direction artistique est excellente avec des décors qui bien que classique et déjà vu nous semblent nouveau du fait de l'aspect peinture sur toile choisi. Les tableaux sont tout simplement envoûtants. La bande son est réussi et en accord avec le scénario bien que les transitions soient parfois un peu brutale et les thèmes des personnages jouaient dans des contextes non adéquat (thème de Popelle vers la fin du jeu).

2) Le scénario quand à lui reste classique mais bien écrit, on a envie de connaître l'histoire de ce monde et de ces factions qui se déchirent ainsi que les motivations personnelles des différents personnages jouables. Attention aux anglophobes le jeu est exclusivement en anglais et il y a des fautes grammaticales qui se perdent de temps en temps dans les textes.

3) le système de combat : du bon tour par tour old-school comme en fait moins de nos jours. Le système de posture des ennemis est très intéressant. En effet, lorsque vous frapper un ennemi avec un type d'attaque (percante, feu, foudre, contondante, coupante) vous provoquer un changement de posture qui change les attaques de l'ennemi. L'amélioration des personnages se fait par levelling pour les statistiques tandis que pour les compétences il faut les apprendre à l'aide de point acquis lors du levelling. On peut en équiper que quelques une et il faut bien lire les descriptifs pour savoir sur quelles statistiques elles se basent pour calculer les dégâts infligés.

4) Pour ce qui est de la difficulté il faudra repasser car le jeu est globalement simple pour les amateurs du genre. A l'exception d'un ou deux combats et pas forcément contre des boss.

+ It's unclear what the traits do - I finally realised that agility increases the number of attacks per turn, but I'm stuff not sure what dexterity does (crit chance? dodge? Who knows...)
+ The healing spells depend on you not getting hit for an entire round, but the tanking abilities are next to useless. (You can make up for it with the trap ability, but trap only becomes truly dependable with Oboa.) Everything became a lot smoother once I gave up on the healing abilities and focused on potions with the double effect talent instead.
+ Maybe I just didn't get the combat system, but the difficulty level seemed to vary from laughingly easy to dead-in-two-turns between fights, for no discernable reason.
+ New characters start with no skills and levels that are significantly below your existing party members, meaning you have to spend time powerleveling a useless character before you can continue playing.

I have no real bad things to say about it, (as it was very enjoyable!) only some wishes.

I wish the story was more... concrete? It felt very fantasy babble at some points. I'm an experienced reader, but the text often was confusing. I was left to fill in the blanks for many things (and I played where I talked to everyone to get all the information I could, searched for all story clues, etc). 

I wish that we could have known a little more about the characters. They talk about their motivations but no real reasons are shown for them... They just... have a lot of feelings I guess? Since you are playing as Arra, who lost her memory, that confusion kind of works at the start in the game's favor? But as the game progresses, you realize that even the person you are supposed to be playing as is keeping things back from you... argh. I'm frustrated, because with some fine tuning, this story and characters would make me care about them as much as Undertale did. As it is, I'm left with the feeling of being on the outside of something big, and not now or ever being allowed into their inner circle to see more. Because I do care about the characters, I just wasn't allowed to get to know them.

The art and character/monster designs are stunning tho. Extraordinarily, sometimes breathtakingly stunning. It felt like playing through a storybook. The music matched very well too. Knowing where to go was confusing (a lot of walking into invisible walls ensued), because of the watercolour artstyle there wasn't clear lines as to where the path was. 

Also, there would be paths that would lead off-screen that you couldn't explore. I didn't mind all this however, as I liked exploring the world. It got frustrating a few times (like the time I wandered around an entire area for 5+ minutes walking into all the spaces of the screen trying to figure out where I was supposed to go - it turned out that it was a screen you previously couldn't enter, but it looked the same as it always did, so I assumed it was one of those 'aesthetic' background doorways - like it was befoooore it changed), as it does take you out of the immersion, but I don't know if that could have been helped.

You can tell so much love went into this little (surprisingly long) game, and it is a gem that is worth playing. Despite what I said about the characters being rather one demensional, the world building is exquisite. All down to the art once again. The art is certainly this game's strong point (and comes so alive, that maybe that's why I was left disappointed with the writing, it just couldn't live up to the art).

The combat is a simplistic ""rock-paper-scissors"" system but I thoroughly enjoy it so far!

The Amber Throne is gorgeous. You definitely acknowledged that by now, but since it's the most important and successful part of the game I can't really write a review without mentioning it. The story is good, and even if I personally didn't find the soundtrack to be as remarkable as some reviews said it would be, It's still satisfying.

The issue I have about The Amber Throne is that it's not that good at being a game.

That's not going to be one of those review that says ""Not worth your time - don't buy"". Like I said, there ARE some good things about this game, but I also have a lot of complaints, and the Negative Reviews section is the place to talk about those.

Let's start with the main issue, wich is also the reason why I can't play the game anymore : because I'm fed up with it. The skill system was so much fun to tinker with when I started playing. Like with any RPG, the first thing I did was to open the menu and check the evolution system. I was pleased to see that as soon as a character joins the party, all their locked skills are already visible, wich means you can immediately have a look at what kind of roles each character might be good at. That way you can plan your progression in advance even if you don't have the levels to buy the skills. So, kudos to that. But.

 Like I said, I ended up being fed up with, it mainly for a reason : there simply isn't enough skills. 

It's actually a problem I encountered quite often with games made with RPG Maker (the reason behind the obsolete resolution, btw), as well as RPGs in general. If the battles become a chore, if each of the four characters end up using the same three skills 90% of the time, then the player might not want to finish the story at all. Add to this the fact that you can end up wandering through the map with no idea where to go, or that the battle sound effects come from RPG Maker's sound bank and WILL get to your nerves if you've already heard them in several other games.

The last problem I have with the skill system is that the last character (Sirra, unless there's another one) joins the party way too late, and with only one skill, when Arra and Popette each have a good ten or even more. It wouldn't be a problem if you could level him up to catch up with the girls, but at this point the leveling had already become much slower, making it difficult to unlock new skills. And that's a shame since Sirra is so cool, on top of having a name that reminds me of my favorite character from Bluebyte's Albion. (But that might not be the point)

Speaking of characters, I also find it extremely stupid that even with only four playable characters, you can only fight with three at a time. I know I'm a fan of FFVI, and some people prefer to have three characters in combat, but in this case it's literally ""the three fighters and that guy you only remember in the cutscenes"". (Sorry, Nuo)
I know the point of such system is to make the player switch between characters to adapt their strategy to the current enemy, but you need way more playable characters to be able to do that ! You can't expect someone to make a three-cards deck from a selection of four cards, especially if those cards need to be leveled up before their gameplay gets interesting.

The last thing I have to say is about the design of those characters. Graphically, they're great (but everything is graphically great in this game). However I completely failed to grow attached to them, and that's probably because of a lack of character development. Retroactively, that's probably a huge part of the reason why the story wasn't enough to make me keep playing after I started to get bored. The plot is heavily world-driven, and the characters barely interact with each other. Heck, the main protagonist is actually mute. Sure, the story supports it, but it's really hard to get emotionally attached to a character that doesn't say a word outside of dreams and journal entries. 

And that's all I have to say. At least for now. I might add something if I end up finishing the game (and I probably will, but right now I don't feel like it). As for what I meant by ""The Amber Throne is not that good at being a game"", it's simply that, at the end of the day, I might have suceeded to really like it if it had been a novel. Or one of those japanese Light Novels. You can't simply give up on drawings like these.

Now don't get me wrong, like I said earlier I don't think the game is unplayable because of this. Even if I ended up disappointed, I still had fun playing it. There are some really good ideas, varied enemies, a beautiful story, and I found the gameplay very entertaining in the beginning and middle of the game.

aesthetically speaking, everything is hand painted and animation is smooth for the most part, though not that abundant. this doesn't take away from how lush & bright the world is, however. the characters are endearing, even more so if you dig fairy tales, and the soundtrack is so good that i alt+tabbed in the middle of playing to buy the OST. 

plenty of games try to recall us back to the glory days but this title manages to do so with flying colors while also having charms all it's own. i'm not finished my first playthrough, but i've thoroughly enjoyed every bit of my 9.5 / 20 hours so far.

I want to start off with the good things about it though only because I have been trying so hard to like this game. As everyone mentions this game is breathtakingly gorgeous, with almost every background and sprite being hand drawn.  Then there's the story which is extreml creative and nuanced touching surprisingly on quite a few modern topics that can paralel perfectly with the real world. From here though I stuggle to find compliments for this game.

I am willing to write off so many issues with plot or charcters or gameplay just because of the beutiful scenery and soundtrack, but I cannot write off the game breaking bugs. I have on six seperate occasions been forced to go back an hour to an hour and a half's worth of progress due to autosaves happening just after a game bug. For example, early in the game in the forest village there is a man who if you talk to at an incorrect angle you interrupt his pathing the game saves, and your character is unable to move. Or say much later (about 11 hours in) there is an enemy that you MUST avoid at all costs otherwise once you defeat it you are treated with a completly black screen The game is still there your character can move and interact with the world the game itself has just become black.

Then there's the open world RPG element. Please for the love of god if you are making a completly linear storyline where I must progress from one area to another and back again in a specific order, do not give me the ability to travel everywhere in the world. I would love to say that I understood what was going on in that storyline, but because I wanted to explore I ended up triggering events out of order and making a mad hash of everything. Playing through my second time after realizing what I had done, I must also ask that you make it blatently sure as to where I need to go. So that I no longer interpret dialouge to mean enter areas where I am instantly killed which are meant for the end game.

The Amber Throne surprised me, both in good and bad ways. However, the story and the art style are both very strong and help to compel the player to go deeper and deeper into the depths of this game. The story starts as so: The Amber God had a prophetic vision that there would be a rebellion that would claim his life. He perceived that, if the throne fell into the wrong hands, the destruction and carnage that would fall upon the land would be catastrophic and unparalleled. He raised his kingdom high into the sky and protected it by encasing it inside of an impenetrable cloud. The events unfolded as he knew they would and he was killed by the rebellion. Prior to raising his kingdom into the sky, he hid his sleeping daughter away with the hopes that she would someday awaken and destroy the throne once and for all. The reason why the throne had to be destroyed is because the Amber Throne grants any wish that can be imagined to the person that sits upon it. There have been several Amber Gods. However, this particular Amber God wanted to stop the cycle. Will his daughter Arra be able to fulfill her father’s dying wish?

Первый час - самые сильные впечатления. Нас выкидывает в пустыню, в совершенно неизвестный и непонятный мир, где мы играем за персонажа Арра, которая не может говорить (этот приём имеет сюжетное объяснение). Замок, парящий в облаках... Наскальная живопись... Изразцовые дома в Красном Королевстве... Порочный король, отдавший власть в руки таинственных Мудрецов... Эта мистическая атмосфера напомнила мне такие потрясающие игрушки, как Bastion, Aquaria, Journey. Постепенно сеттинг, деталька за деталькой, раскрывается, и мистика уступает место солидной предыстории с павшими цивилизациями и королевскими интригами.

История - сильная сторона Трона. Даже не сюжет, как таковой, а как он подан, насколько он закручен для относительно короткой по меркам jrpg (15-20 часов) игры. Мы смотрим шикарные по красоте слайды, в которым -движутся- предметы и меняется освещение (не знаю, почему этот простой трюк мало где используется), по некоторым валпэйперам можно даже ходить, читаем эпическую сказку с колоритными персонажами и слушаем не менее эпическую, но узнаваемую и яркую музыку (гитарные треки ящеров отсылают к первой Диабло, флейта звучит почти как у Яна Андерсона, синтезаторы трубят в пафос ровно там, где нужно, а в самые напряжённые моменты приходит затишье). Персонажи сильно отличаются по характеру и часто подают голос в диалогах. Не обошлось и без идеи, хорошо известной - бойся своих желаний, но раскрытой в антиутопическом ключе (на каждый своеобразный народ тут по антиутопии, футуристическое королевство Аксиса, закрытая утопия Munnik, заблудившиеся в прошлом Arroc и наоборот, сжигающие прошлое ради неопределённого будущего Sehr - у каждой расы своя дилемма и свои благородные ошибки, привёдшие к роковым последствиям). Имхо, подкачала концовка, в которую в лучших традициях японских сценаристов свалено слишком много всякого треша для убойности (а что они сделали с Эвелин -_-), но общая линия осталась вполне логичной и приходит к правильному завершению, чем-то напоминающему завершение манги про Навсикаю.

А вот боевая механика, в отличие от сюжета, звёзд с неба не хватает. Гринда как такового, к счастью, нет (зажигать алтари, активирующие респавн монстров, совсем не обязательно), но правила очень просты - у каждого персонажа есть скиллы, наносящие урон определённого типа, а каждый противник уязвим и резистивен к определённым типам урона, так что нужно понять, чем врага бить, и закликать до смерти. Иногда враги накладывают позитивные и негативные эффекты, типа паралича, но тактику под это менять нет особого смысла. Экономика дисбалансна - целебные эликсиры превращают любой бой кроме боссфайтов в заведомо выигрышный и при этом валяются за копейки на каждом углу. Видов противников много - несколько десятков, но лучше бы они встречались по одному-два раза, а не сериями из однотипных энкаунтеров.

Графика, хотя дико говорить это про игру на RPG Maker (640x480, увы), очень крутая. Мало того, что здесь суперский дизайн мира, так ещё добавлена прорва спецэффектов (туманы, цветной свет, падающие лепестки, песчаные бури и тд), из-за чего в динамике игра выглядит гораздо красивее, чем на картинке. Хотя вот оптимизация могла быть и получше. На моём корыте семилетней давности тормоза были только в 3-4 локациях, но в журнальных рецензиях производительность сильно ругали. Не уверен, что будет играбельно на посредственном нетбуке.

В целом имеем отличнейшую jrpg, сравнимую с классикой 90-х, незаслуженно потерявшуюся среди кучи инди-шлака, с которым её объединяет только движок. Если вы любите старые финалки, Chrono Trigger и иже с ними, настоятельно рекомендую не проходить мимо.",1442647966,1442648231,True,98,7,0.892956733703613281,3,True,False,False,False,,,

All in all this is a breathtaking game to experience and I highly recommend it for those looking for a good JRPG, especially if you are looking for something different.

It took me about 18 hours without breaks, and let me tell you... It was good. Amazing even.
The artwork is lovely, the gameplay is very intuitive, the characters are interesting and the story, man the story. I was invested from start to finish. I'll have to replay the game in hopes of catching some more foreshadowing.
I am not lying when I say this is one of my favorite games to date. It's worth every bit of money I spent.
I know I know, this sounds super ridiculous because I only say positive things. Truth be told the only negative thing I could think of, was that the sprint key was so far away from the arrow keys and I couldn't sprint while eating stuff in front of my computer.

Check list of positive things in this game:
+ Girl with a sword and her new bestie, Girl with a pistol, go and want to overthrow a throne
+ On their way they pick up Rifle Dude, a bird and a lizard
+ Plot twist that was actually not super surprising but I still yelled ""DAMN IT!""
+ Incredibly lovely artwork that I'll definitely honor with fanart
+ Very relaxing soundtrack. Seriously you can just let it play in the background. Maybe use battle music for cleaning idk
+ Not as much exposition as you'd expect
+ Long game
+ Great story
+ How was this made with RPG Maker? I had to double check because I could barely believe it.

Check list of negative things
- No sprinting and eating Pizza at the same time
- At times the controls were a bit wonky but you get used to it.

In my humble opinion everyone who loves good stories in video games should definitely get The Amber Throne. I'd give it more thumbs up if I could.",1438889226,1438889226,True,125,17,0.827722132205963135,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I adored the watercolor inspired landscapes. The story kept me invovled and had a fairytale quality to it. Each character was uniue. The images and storytelling were enough to forget that the games is an RPG Maker game. There are glitches that occur that will remind you as well as some of the battle mechanics. This did not detract from my overall expereince. My only issues with the game were the map and walking speed. First, the map was just an over view of the entire world. I perfer a map that gives more detail or is helpful when exploring. This map did nothing for me. When exploring you will also find ancient statues that will respawn enemies each time you enter that area. I chose not to activate the statues and I was still able to level-up enough to beat the final section. Now for the walking speed. Yes, you can change the walk from a slow turtle pace to an elderly person with a walker pace. I felt much of the game was me walking slowly. The game is beautiful but I still like to move at a decent pace when trying to backtrack etc.

I found this to be a great mix of story and artwork. I doubt it will be a game I replay again but it was worth playing. Thanks.",1437448706,1437448706,True,7,2,0.57715529203414917,0,True,False,False,False,,,

At times slightly obtuse, it rewards patience and exploration thoroughly. Something like a simple background object can be an interactable bit of lore with a minor experience reward attached. Rich, seemingly hand-painted art and a dynamic, ambient soundtrack completely destroy expectations of what RPGMaker is capable of. 

On the mechanical side, while stats are assigned automatically at level up, the player has a nice variety of choices in regards to which skills to buy with JP, a currency earned upon gaining a level. Nearly all of these skills have an effect on enemies; one might break an armored enemy's defenses and turn him into an ""Unarmored Enemy"" or a particularly fast enemy into a ""Wounded Enemy"". This gives battles a more involved feel which is refreshing for a turn based RPG. 

While I normally ignore RPGMaker games as a whole, I can say this is worth full price. The game's creator has been highly active in addressing the very few issues the game has and patching them.

Pros:

+Interesting female cast
+Isn't afraid to be thematically dark
+Interesting and intuitive skill, combat and crafting systems
+Exploration is encouraged, with open world elements

Cons:
-Made in RPG Maker. While this is well-hidden, occasional things like the default combat sound effects, dialogue boxes, or portions of the menus will remind you. If this is something that matters to you, keep this in mind. Other than those gripes, however, one can barely tell, and it is the only complaint I can come up with.
