　システムはかなりシンプルで、左右＋ストックの最大3種類の武器を使い分けてステージをクリアしていく縦STG。いわゆるロボシューで自機はロボットなんですが、メカデザやステージ構成が80年代アーケードシューティングライク、個人的にはPCEのSTGっぽくていいトシしたおっさんゲーマーには刺さるものがあるんじゃないでしょうか。
　ユニークなのが「サイドバウアー」。本作はストラニア軍とバウアー軍の戦いを描いた作品なんですが、プレイヤーがストラニア軍側となるノーマルモードに対し、アナザーモードとも言える「サイドバウアー」は敵であるバウアー軍がプレイヤーとなります。そして、「サイドバウアー」では、ステージ順がそのまま逆転した構成となっており、本編の最終ステージが最初のステージとなっているという構成。もちろんボスも再配置されていたり、ステージ中に出現するミッションの内容も防衛・破壊が入れ替わっているという面白い構成となっています。
　また、言及しておかなくてはいけないのがBGM。本作のBGMを担当しているのは、「マッドストーカー」や「あすか120％」で知られる与猶啓至氏。いかにも「あの頃」のゲーム音楽と言った感じのBGMがたまらん。
　いわゆる弾幕系ではなく地形に当たっても一撃死ではないものの、状況に合わせて的確に武装を選ぶ判断力を要求されるので難易度はけっこう高いですが、やりごたえのある作品です。",1711033680,1711033680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

”古き良き80年代アーケードゲームを彷彿とさせる”というだけあって多彩なウェポンを場面に応じて使い分けながらパターンを構築しながら攻略する様はアイレムの名作シューティング、イメージファイトを思い出させます。

ボーダーダウン、アンダーディフィートを手掛けたG.revらしく演出にこだわりつつもシューティングとしての面白さも兼ね備えた良ゲーです。
各ウェポンの段位を上げることがスコアアップに必要なことや、スコアの1000桁台・100桁台の数字によってパターンが変化することもあり、ガチでハイスコアを狙いに行くとハゲが進行することうけあいです。
（スコアを狙いすぎないのであればウェポンの変更は最小限にすることで安定した遊び方ができます。エンジョイ勢もご安心を）

惜しむらくは上記要素もあってパターン構築が人によって様々であろうはずなのに、スコアボードからリプレイがアップ・ダウンロードできないことでしょうか。
色々なプレイヤーの攻略を手軽に見られないのが残念です。

開発当初、アーケードで稼働することを発表しながらも諸般の事情でコンシューマのダウンロード販売となった、開発サイドとしては非常に無念であったであろう本作品ですが、アーケード新環境として期待を寄せられているEXAシステムにて、調整を施した”ストラニアEX""として稼働を予定しているとのことです。

From the perspective of a common couch potato this is a delicious shmup served in a very decent way.

Comes with twice the amount of weapons borderlands has, or so I think.
Splendid 2.5D interaction inlevel as well as infight during a boss encounter.
Combination of 3 collectable weapons, 2  or even 3 active at the same time thus go mad combining them.

Given the gerne, the storyline present is a little more catchy than usual i'd say, not Shakespear but fun.
Two different factions to play, controls differ a bit, weapons seem to be the same.
This pumps up replayability quite a lot, anyhow it is great fun to play encouters from both sides.

Runs great, 1920x1080 @60, on a 7 year old GTX260 with a quad core cpu, so this is no hardware consuming monster and thus should run quite well on most modern rigs.

As far as those releases go, this was my favorite along with Eschatos (also on Steam, and something you should also buy if you haven't yet). What I appreciated the most about this game was G.Rev's decision to design it will respect to the ""Traditional"" style shooter, as opposed to the bullet hell style which has become more common in modern shump design. Not to say I don't like to play bullet hells, I just prefer the design elements of the 80's/early 90's shooters, where the focus was on less numerous but more targeted bullets, an assortment of distinct weapons to use where success in the game is determined by proper use of said weapons in different situations, environmental hazards, cinematic style stage progression, etc. Think Gradius, R-Type, Thunder Force, the various Complie shooters like MUSHA, and Einhander as examples of what this is modeled after. That type of style is right up my alley, and Strania does the job of scratching that particular itch. Add on top of that, add the catchy, shump appropriate, electro synth fusion soundtrack of Keishi Yonao, and you have a very well crafted game. 

The craftsmanship extends to the fact that G.Rev took it upon themselves to make a whole extra addition to main Strania campaign with the ""Side Vover"" add on (at no extra cost in the Steam version), were you play the game from the perspective of the Stranian antagonists, the Vower. Essentially, you play the main game in reverse, starting from the Vower home colony, going through the same stages from the Strania side to get the Stranian home base. However, instead of being the recycled affair you would likely expect from something like this, the stage design, bosses, music, and progression is distinct enough to make it feel like an entirely different game. It was an example of how to do DLC the right way, by adding value to the game while keeping the main portion whole and untampered with.

Those that are more observant will see the subtleties that G.Rev put in both campaigns to differentiate the Stranian and Vower sides, and give them personality without even having to rely on story composition. For example, the Stranian's mechs and infrastructure are very angular and blocky and the uniforms of the main pilots suggest a militaristic, organized culture. The Vower's mechs and equipment on the other hand, are mostly rounded and curved, and the dress of the pilots suggest a tribal, nomadic, theocratic culture. Another example is that while pilots on both sides can use each others weapon arrays (denoted by being highlighted by Blue (Strania), Red (Vower) or Purple (Netural) in game), only mechs on the Stranian side have access to enhanced versions of the Strania side's weapons (essentially activated by collecting two of the same weapon on one weapon slot), and only Vower mechs can use enhanced Vower weapons on the other end. Depending on what side you play, you'll find that the enemies will mostly attack you with their side's weapons, which you mainly get from stealing them off destroyed enemy mechs. Weapons on your side are mainly gotten by storage crates and friendly drops. It's the little things that help make this game special.

If you are a fan of the genre at all, don't make the mistake of overlooking this game, as it apparently was when it was initially released. It deserves more recognition, and is a much purchase.

With collaboration from Treasure's former employee Hiroshi Iuchi as graphic designer, famous for directing games such as Radiant Silvergun and Ikaruga, and an exhilarating soundtrack with sharp sound effects produced by Keishi Yonao (Asuka 120%, Mad Stalker, Neural Gear), Strania is an accessible shooter that focuses more on environmental aspects rather than just throwing a million bullets at you on a lifeless terrain.

The controls are some of the tightest I've ever played, and the scoring system relying on weapon leveling is a very dynamic way of spicing things up for those wishing to push further their scores. The fans of more bullet-heavy games will also enjoy its expert mode with suicide bullets, and overall this game will definitely give a fair deal of challenge for all kind of skill levels.

The gameplay video on Steam pretty much says it all, and it plays just as good as it looks.

The most interesting thing about this game is the variety in both the environment, enemy placement and design, and the way you handle each situation with the different weapons.  This is a game that rewards experimentation and replaying with different combinations.  You can switch on the fly and keep something in reserve, so each time I make a mistake I always think ""oh yeah, I should try it like this instead"".  Very fun if you like to go in-depth with the available options.

The recharging shield is also a cool dual-purpose tool.  You can use it for quick bursts of invincibility during a tricky section, or use it to boost multiplier during particularly lucrative situations.  It's up to you; play it safe or balls to the wall.

The graphics are a good compromise between awesomeness and visibilty.  There's streams of shell casings flying out of weapons (even though they shoot lasers), sweet but brief boss intros firing flak everywhere, and of course the deeply satisfying mega explostions when you down giant bosses.  Color choice is done well, so no matter how much is going on I haven't had visibility issues with bullets or the hitbox.

From the makers of Border Down, Under Defeat, both Senko no Ronde's, Mamoru-Kun Curse, and their latest title Kokuga. Comes G.Rev's Strania - The Stella Machina - (Seisou Kouki Strania/星霜鋼機ストラニア), their first title on Steam.

Previously developed for XBLA and the Nesica-(X)-Live Arcade, Strania is a shoot-em-up/shmup/STG, in which you're fighting a war against both the Stranian and the Vower armies vaying conquest. Yes, there is a story on both sides if you  check the ""How-To-Play"" section after you see the mechanics of the game.

Gameplay wise, the mechanics feel similar to Einhander in a sense, where you can switch weapons (up to 3) for the right situations (though there can be times where you might end up in the wrong situation if you pick the wrong weapons.) There are a total of 9 different weapons you can use in the entire game to suit your preferences (you can also level them up if you pick the same weapon again, though the colors will vary by the sides which weapons you can only upgrade to Lv.2), although...

Scoring however, requires you to use the weapons (all 9 of them in one playthough) strategically and tactically. The game uses the JP ranking system (Kyu = Dan) to score points, use them often when destroying enemies will yield bonus points (from 10kyu to 1kyu, and then from 1Dan to 10Dan), getting all 9 weapons to 1dan or higher at the end will give you a 9Mil. point bonus if you know the game in and out. Not only that, you can use the O/D system to temporary be invulnerable for a while, and have a multiplier going from X1.1 to X2.0, use when necessary.

As it is with ports that come from the Arcade/Console versions and bringing them out to Steam, this is more or less the same as the 360 port and everything is just right with it, no issues on my end, just smooth gameplay from here on in.

Lastly on the +/- sides!

+Same as it is on both XBLA/Nesica, good gameplay/mechanics/etc. (Includes both the base game and  Side: Vower!  Based on the 1.1 XBLA updated version.)
+Various options you can set your experience to the PC port. Although the - only to some users as usual with PC users, there will be problems, but nothing much updates/patches could fix. And help on the game forums if necessary.
-Unfortunately, online co-op is not in the Steam version, even though the XBLA release had it, and the co-op for that had no lag whatsoever, just smooth gameplay there too. Luckily there's Local Co-Op at least. I just hope G.Rev can find a way to add this to the Steam version if they can do it.

And to finish it off, Strania is a great game overall, the game can be tailored to your liking either for relaxed or hardcore play. I just hope this ends up being a success somehow that G.Rev can port their back catalog onto Steam. Maybe even new titles if they can!

タイトー・トレジャーの名作を彷彿とさせる部分もあり、開発スタッフの素晴らしさを再認識させられました。
グレフの今後を応援する意味でも是非購入してください。

+The extra ""Side Vower"" content gives the game both sides of the story. Two paths with multiple difficulty options will mean more replayability than other games in the genre. Yay.
+Graphics are also a welcome step up. Some of the background elements can really pop out and surprise you. The environment really feels like part of the action.
+Weapon system is easy to get the hang of, and you can make some useful combinations, but I also really like the typical method of upgrading your shot little by little throughout the game. I give it a plus for straying from the norm while still being fun.
+Local Multiplayer yay (Not that I have friends who play these games anyway)


-My DS3 controller is only partially supported, and some buttons cannot be used. This isn't an issue with other games.
-I noticed some screen tearing while playing with native resolution (1920x1080) and there are no graphics options besides changing resolution and playing windowed/fullscreen. You may want to try configuring it in your GPU control panel. Also, there is no significant advantage compared to a lower resolution like 1280x720. The visuals don't look as sharp as they should for 1080p.

I recommend it because it makes this genre more exciting. The environment engages you, especially once you start heading into the sky and beyond. The shooting and moving mechanics are fluid, and the game is challenging without being Touhou levels of difficult. Thanks to G.rev for bringing this to Steam.",1448428277,1448428404,True,2,1,0.34372866153717041,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Can't speak at the enthusiast's level for detail though.

For anyone else, this shmup's gimmick is that you are a giant robot with three weapons, (rotating, one in each hand, one in reserve) and you can constantly switch them out from a variety of drops offered through the game. The weapons are swords or various shot styles. Tremendous chance for experimentation here and varied play styles. This was a favorite of mine on Xbox, glad to see it escape XBLA.",1448427924,1448427924,True,10,2,0.478684395551681519,0,True,False,False,False,,,
