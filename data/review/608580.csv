Normalerweise lasse ich mich nicht von Rezessionen beeinflussen und teste die Spiele gern selbst da die Meinungen ja doch recht häufig objektiv sind.

Programmierer zusammen gebastelt und im EA raus geworfen worden.
 
Das Terrain lädt teilweise sehr schlecht bis überhaupt nicht, im Meer läuft man unter Wasser, im See klatscht man auf das Wasser wenn man von der Seite rein springt und erhält Fallschaden. Rohstoffe gibt es nur mit Glück ein paar im Startgebiet, der Rest der Insel ist komplett leer. Außerdem muss man Glück haben ob überhaupt Rohstoffe spawnen, wenn ja kann man sich gut über Wasser halten, wenn nein, dann kommt man mit den Sachen aus den 4 Fässern am Start nicht wirklich weit. Bei mir gab es z.B. nur 1 Busch mit Pflanzenfaser auf der ganzen Insel. Diese wird aber zum craften der Steinaxt benötigt. Also Pustekuchen!

Das Unwetter schaut aus als würden Mincraftblöcke vom Himmel fallen trotz der Grafikeinstellung ""Fantastic"". Hinzukommen FPS Drops die das ""Spiel"" quasi unspielbar machen. Die Sonnenstrahlen sind ein großer weißer Punkt welcher immer mal wieder aufploppt. Die Grafik allgemein lasse ich mal außen vor, weil es eben noch ein EA ist. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt hat man aber auf der PS 1 schöneres gesehen.

However, I do have a few complaints about the game. Before that though, let me give you a rundown of the game, if you don't know about it yet. When you first start the game, you awake next to a crashed ship, I assume it's yours. There are a few barrels you can dig through for food and other necessities. After that you are pretty much just roaming the island for resources to progress, hence a survival game!

Now onto my pros and cons for the game.

Pros:
1. Nice graphics; not terrible and not over baring
2. GUI is nice and easy to understand
3. Saving is as easy as pressing F5
4. Decent speed of the inventory scroll!

Cons:
1. Too much grass; makes it difficult to find resources
          1a. Either cut back on the grass or make the player character taller; this will help 
          1b. Resources get lost in the tall grass!
          1c. The tall grass makes me feel 3 ft tall and can't see where I'm going.

2. There is much need for ""plant fiber"" and the only way I've been able to get this in abundance is to find what I call 'scarce bushes'. These scarce bushes give you a lot of plant fiber. However, I can hardly find them, hence the name... There is an other way you can get plant fiber, that is to find ""bark"" and craft it into plant fiber. The problem? Bark is too scarce and you can't just take the logs you collect and craft the bark, so you have to either find the bark or the scarce bushes scattered on the island. Also, see item one!

3. While in the inventory, it takes multiple clicks on a recipe in order to view the credentials. This gets irritating, especially when you are trying to craft more than one thing at a time!

4. When eating or drinking, it would be nice to have a cool-down timer. This way, when I'm trying to get my thirst leveled, I am not sitting there for 5-10 seconds clicking as if it were an endless clicker game!

5. The terrain feels a little too 'hilly'. This may be fixed with either less/ lower grass, taller player character, or a combination of the two. (Again see item one!) 


Finally I would like to say this game has some potential and hope the devs are paying attention to the feedback that has been presented to them. If so, and they ACTUALLY listen, then this game will be very fun to play in the future! I'll keep my eye on this one for sure!",1562480364,1562480364,True,2,1,0.491542309522628784,0,True,False,True,False,,1563544697.0,"Hello,

Sneaking up on these guys, with a well-timed wooden spear, dispatches them with a satisfying squelching sound, Their bodies all sem to have several lumps of rotten meat and a few twigs, as loot and the spears - once thrown - deplete after half a dozen or so throws. Still, they're easy enough to make.
The wild Boar fight back. The chickens don't, but both can be harvested to provide leather, bones and meat, for the Boar and meat and (I think) feathers for the fowls. You can collect a good bit of water at the various village pools, although the amount each 'drink' replenishes your character by is annoyingly small. The cooked meat however, will see you back to tip-top, radiant health after just a few bites.
I've only made the spears so far (I made a bow, but quit (I have work early) before trying it out. 
This IS early access and I remember 7 Days to Die looked a bit like this wen it was first born, so I'm going to go out on a limb here, and proclaim that this has got 'Potentially great ame' stamped all the way through it, like a stick of Blackpool rock. That said, it needs a lot of work and it REALLY needs the option for the player to remap the keys. As a left-hander (ooh er missus!) I was a little put out to be forced yo use WASD as my prefs are are the other end of the keyboard. So, come on Devs, get this sorted ASAP, because, after all THAT is game design 101.
It needs a few more animals, a lot more places to go and see, and some more diverse and interesting loot items.
One thing that REALLY impressed me was the weather system. The top of the screen gives time of day, moon phase, temperature and weather. At 2pm I was caught in a pretty nasty storm. Visibility dropped dramatically, trees swayed, the wind howled and lightening snaked its way to the ground. For me, this lent the game a good deal of  extra immersion, so well done in that area.
The whole thing is done with Unity and although there are better graphically imperessive games out there, I'm sure Empires will catch up.
To summarise: Get some extra animals to hunt, give the Ghoul villagers a little more to do than stand in the same place like town centre chavs on Spice. Improve the amount of thirst that drinking replenishes, put in a few more POI's, add key-mapping and have a general tidy up and I guarantee you, you'll have a monster on your hands in no time. Just don't do what a well known Dev in a similar genre does, and update the thing once a year. I won't name those particular Devs, but its no FUN if you don't PIMP up your game regularly.  Get to work IGS, then give me a call to tell me how right I was.
If you're looking to jump in early doors, onto a project that can grow to be great with some TLC, then buy this while its still cheap. DOn't eapect a lot to do at the moment, but you will (like me) at least get some idea of what this game COULD be, if the Devs stay on the ball.
I like it.

Things that need fixing ASAP.
1) Items NIOT going into inventory and hanging in mid-air on screen is a game breaker.
2) items not going into hotbar slots but hanging there unused another game breaker.
3) Crafting an item when inventory is full (of stuff that hasn't really gone INTO the inventory just drops item, never to be seen again.

I just bought this game today, thinking surly it must be worth the sale price.  Boy was I wrong!
I am also a major supporter of EA games, with only one other time leaving any
type message on the boards. But this game is just nagging at me to do so.

I watched both of Jadiwan Videos from when the game was first released, expecting to see more
game play added by now, being it's been 4 months, and was such a shallow release of a game in the first place, even for EA. 

But I was impressed with how happy Jadiwan was with the developers quick 
response to his critique to the game. 

The developer's EA page also states it will  be out of EA at the end of the year, 
“We believe it will stay in Early Access until the end of 2017.” 

So ..
I was willing to give the developer's the benefit of the doubt and decided to go ahead and support their game.  But now if I am to be honest, I am sorry I did. 

My gosh. supporters have just been asking for a save, which should be a staple of any game
release even EA. 

Sorry, but to me it seems the developer's feel asking for so little from them is asking to much. 

While at the same time they expect us to give them our support and our money. 
The last post claiming the save was coming was about two months ago, 
 I also felt they were snippy when someone questioned them about it. 

They stated they never said it would be in the last up date, Hey developer's you should of had it
in the game from the get go!
 
I am really sorry I gave you my support, I don't feel you deserve it. 
I personally don't feel your effort has been enough for the  most basic of things that need to go 
into even starting an EA game.

I just spent 74 min walking around, with basically the only view being of stone mountains, and 
tree's. 

Everything looks exactly the same, pretty much in any direction. It was all starting to make my eyes cross. Hard to find anything to harvest but tree's tree's and more tree's. You can't harvest the 
stone mountains, but you can crouch around hitting E until you feel like banging your head on your computer desk, or any hard surface that might knock some get out of here sense into your head.

There really is still no game here to be had, that I could find any way, unless you have a fetish 
for crouching while using the E key. 

I will not be refunding, only because I expect the developer's to keep their word to their supporters. Yeah Yeah I know many don't. But we can alway hope can't we?

I will give the game developer's credit for the stormy  lightening weather, that is pretty well done, 
but that is all I can say in support of Empires. 

I would wait on buying this game until the developer's hold up to their word's whether 
it's in their EA statement or any posts on their pages.",1507604213,1507604570,False,33,5,0.64300692081451416,11,True,False,True,False,,1547343380.0,"Hello Sunidaze,

Being a lover of survival games,this game from the looks of it,was for me. After engaging in the game for quite awhile,I have come up with this honest review. For the purpose of review and review only,I have listed the pros and cons of the game so that everyone can have a better understanding of the game. Note that these are my opinions and mine alone. There was no misconduct in creating this review.

PROS
1. Beautiful graphics - When compared to most game I've played,this is one of the best
2.Awesome mechanics - The game's mechanics is fluid and solid
3.Different - The game is different in the way it works. It's not your average survival game
4.Environment - The harsh environment is cool effect and it really feels alive and real

CONS
1.Lack of story - The game doesn't really have a story to it yet

All and all,this game is truly for those who love survival game. If a storyline is added to the game,Empires and easily top off those other survival games.

I give this game a 8/10 due to its mechanis and the feel of them game. I'll be making a gameplay of the game and be sure to check it out for beter understanding of the game.

Always a risk playing an early access game especially when it's in a raw state. The big thing for me with early access, is not the amount of content,  it's, is it playable and do I see potential. Empires IS playable. I spent about an hour with the game and didn't get one crash or any kind of lag, and I don't have an ultra spec PC to boot!. 
Gameplay is smooth, the menu system is simple and easy to use. I've done a youtube video as it's always easier to watch rather than read a bunch of words. Enjoy! Btw, I noticed the devs updated this game on Sunday, can't think of any other game I've had that updates on a weekend. Guess this dev cares about the game.

I have played about 45 min of the game with several deaths. I have found the developers have a good concept for the game. Everyone needs to remember, this is an early access game and there are always bugs and content planned for a game that has not been implimented. This being said, I have a few isssues with the game, that are game stoppers for me ""even early access""

1: No save function for the game on release. (Note: Developers say this will be added in the next update}. This is an issue because playing a game for 30 minutes or so and then having to restart the game the next time makes the game no fun.

2: As with all survival games, gathering resources is part of the game and expected. Having the tools to do this is a must. Having the resources needed to make the basic tools needed to gather resources is also a must and if not available in the game it becomes a game stopper. I found that the first tool you are given is a stone axe ""basic survival tool"". The stone axe has durabiliity and will weat out "" expected in a survival game"". However; to make a new stone axe, it requires stone, branches and cloth. No cloth to be found. I was able to get resources from one tree, on boulder of clay and boulder of stone. Axe is almost wore out. Wandered the map for over 20 minutes and found no source of cloth. Game over for me as I can not gather more wood, stone or clay to make any of the items in the crafting menue.

3: Food and liquid intake is part of survial games. When you start the game you are provided berries for liquid intake. The amount provided lasted the 40 minutes or so of game play and I still had some left. However; while wandering the map[, I found no source of berries to resupply my liquid intake and will eventually die of thirst. Game over in maybe an hour or two.

With the above comments in concideration, If the deveopers make regular updates to the game and address the above issues in the next update I whole heartly give the game a thumbs up. This being said. if the devolpers do not fix the abouve issues, the game is not worth the money you pay for a game that will only give you about an hour or two of continuous playing and game over ""restart"".

Pros:
Straight Forward Game
Freedom to do what you want to do
Pretty good enviorment for early access
Stone Hatchets and other tools last awhile. ( deteriation is slow)

Cons:
Not enough ''food'' items. I spent an entire game looking for boars to kill to get some meat. I never did find any and I circled the entire island.
