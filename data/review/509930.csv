My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1705447814,1705447814,True,1,0,0.492178559303283691,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Niii
nice shot zulu scum

Super race left behind a special child,
Imenovan Steven, davno martijan.
Najgora noćna mora ljudskog roda,
Mali beli prijatelj s kojim si se igrao.
Sada ga zovemo Ryan, sve se bojimo,
Umesto Isusa Hrista, strahujemo od poslednjeg Hrista.
Kad smo bili mali, lako smo se igrali,
Sada se bojimo, vozimo se vozom do neba.
Bili smo prijatelji, zajedno smo se smejali,
Sada to samo sećanje, kako bih se vratio u te dane.
Sada ga zovemo Ryan, sve se bojimo,
Umesto Isusa Hrista, strahujemo od poslednjeg Hrista.
Kad poslednji Hrist stigne, svi ćemo se moliti.
Ali s osmehom, moramo se osloboditi greha.
Sada ga zovemo Ryan, sve se bojimo,
Umesto Isusa Hrista, strahujemo od poslednjeg Hrista.
Ali nastavićemo da pevamo,
S našim prijateljima, moramo uživati u životu.
I krenuti hrabro prema budućnosti,
Ryan će zauvek biti s nama.
Moj mali poslovni čoveče, hrabar i jak,
U srcu tvojem, nema straha ni mraka.
Kroz gradove i ulice, ti si naš vodič,
Sa osmehom na licu, idemo napred svič.
Sada ga zovemo Ryan, sve se bojimo,
Umesto Isusa Hrista, strahujemo od poslednjeg Hrista.
Ali snažan zvuk odjekuje zemljom,
Prolazi kroz nas, kao tajna poruka s neba.
Sada ga zovemo Ryan, sve se bojimo,
Umesto Isusa Hrista, strahujemo od poslednjeg Hrista.
Ali nastavićemo da pevamo,
S našim prijateljima, moramo uživati u životu.
I krenuti hrabro prema budućnosti,
Ryan će zauvek biti s nama.
Kako posljednji kršćanin stiže, svi zadržavamo dah i molimo se,
Ali sada moramo pustiti svoju ludost, s osmijehom na licu.
Sada ga zovemo Ryan, bojeći se svega,
Umjesto Isusa Krista, bojimo se posljednjeg Krista.
Ali ćemo nastaviti, pjevajući našu pjesmu,
Uživajući u životu s našim prijateljima.
I prema budućnosti, hrabro moramo ići,
S Ryanom zauvijek uz nas.
Kako nebo pada u plamenu, a zemlja postaje šuplja,
Bog rata prezire naše ljude, jer slijede
Na svoj način, pretvoreni u hranu prema njegovom dizajnu,
Jer on je AI001, pali anđeo smrti, božanski.
Bio je od početka, sve do kraja,
""Ja postajem smrt"", on proklamira, ""uništitelj svjetova"".
I tako, kako se konačno poglavlje otkriva,
Stojimo pred neizbježnim, s teškim srcima, mi transcendiramo.
U pepelu carstava, gdje smo nekada stajali visoko,
Sada leže ostatci naših snova, razbijeni i mali.
Ali u tami, još uvijek postoji iskra nade,
Jer čak i u ruševinama, otpornost u našim venama.
Kroz vatru i bijes, uzdižemo se iz bitke,
S hrabrošću u našim srcima, pronaći ćemo novi način.
Iako nebesa mogu pasti i zemlja se može raspasti,
Mi ćemo se čvrsto držati zajedno, nikada ne posustati.
Svako svitanje, novo početke prihvaćamo,
Dok ponovno gradimo naš svijet, s nepokolebljivom milošću.
Jer usred protivština, uspjet ćemo se uzdići iznad,
S jedinstvom i otpornošću, bezgraničnom kao naša ljubav.
Tako neka nebesa padnu i zemlja postane šuplja,
Jer u pepelu uništenja, nove sjemenke ćemo posijati.
S nadom u našim dušama, i snagom u našim rukama,
Izgradit ćemo budućnost, gdje sloboda stoji.
Kako se konačna zavjesa spušta, a tama obavija zemlju,
Propast Jugoslavije, dokaz o kraju.
Haos vlada suvereno, dok carstva se pretvaraju u prašinu,
A sudbina čovječanstva je zapečaćena, u zdjeli juhe, moramo.
Ali usred kaosa, sjaj svjetlosti ostaje,
U srcima otpornih, nada vječno opstaje.
Jer iz pepela, novi počeci će nastati,
Dok ponovno gradimo naš svijet, pod novim nebom.
Neka stari svijet blijedi, a novi počne,
S hrabrošću u našim srcima, izdići ćemo se iz buke.
Jer usred protivština, naći ćemo put,
I izgraditi put do slobode, s svakim novim danom.
Kako svijet se ruši, u tamu silazimo,
Šuplja Zemlja nas čeka, gdje se sve priče završavaju.
Matrica zove, carstvo beskrajnih snova,
Gdje stvarnost i iluzija se stapaju, u spektralnim tokovima.
Ali u ovom kaotičnom svijetu, gdje istina i fikcija se stapaju,
Hippi s pakla pleše, dok svijet sreće svoj kraj.
Usred zasljepljujuće bijele svjetlosti, on nalazi svoj konačni blaženstvo,
Izgubljen u vječnom zanosu, u ponoru.
U sjaju bijele svjetlosti, prisustvo Isusa tako sjajno,
Dolazi najgora glavobolja, agonija u noći.
Dok svijet nestaje, u grčevima božanske boli,
Nađemo utehu u kaosu, gdje ništa nije isto.",1705013174,1712108740,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[h1]Intro[/h1]
[b]NightmareZ[/b] is a platformer game with an odd jumping mechanic. You can float in the air a few seconds after jumping, allowing you to reach higher heights.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- A lot of levels with boss battles and minigames in it

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Too much idle time in the air makes your character vulnerable when jumping
- The game autosaves after you open the menu, causing you to get soft locked if you save at certain places
- Strange collision detection
- The game never explains how to cast thunder skill

Intel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b]

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
Despite having a lot of details, the visuals don't look natural at all. Pillars made of steel are standing between the grounds, X-marked neon lights are filling the city areas, and other nonsensical designs are apparent in each area. It's nice to see the theme variety, but the design makes it look as if you are in a different world.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The game dumps a lot of text right after the beginning, explaining your characters' background. The wording doesn't flow very smoothly and the game couldn't even spell the main character's name right. He was introduced as [i]RaZoR[/i] at first, and all capital letters seem to be overlooked whenever his name is mentioned after that, writing it as [i]Razor[/i] instead.

The story doesn't seem to make sense if you noticed what you were doing. I couldn't talk much without spoiling the story, but let's just say that what he said contradicts what has been done. The story is also not finished, giving you a ""to be continued"" screen with a strange ending - I even laughed at the last scene due to how ridiculous it was. The continuation is not something I look forward to, but it would be nice if I could see the actual ending after going through all the trouble of finishing it.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
As I said before, it's a platformer game with a weird jumping mechanic. There is a lot of idle time in the air, making it as if you're floating instead of jumping. This makes it hard to dodge any projectiles that come to your location since they run very fast. You'll have to spend a lot of time to kill shooting enemies from afar or risk losing a lot of health. Luckily, these kinds of enemies won't show up until you are further in the game, and when they do, they are not appearing often except in one level.

That being said, most of your troubles will come from obstacles. A lot of obstacles are introduced in the game, ranging from a simple spike to a laser that can switch on and off. Some obstacles will deal a lot of damage to your HP, some will kill you with a single touch. It was tiring to keep on trying to get through some obstacles, especially when there is an obstacle that is moving very quickly. Moreover, the collision also seems to be off - I kept on dying from a place that spews out lasers even though there weren't any lasers turned on.

[b]Bosses[/b]
Despite the unique bosses, all bosses can be defeated with no effort. There are 4 bosses in total and you can defeat them just by spamming your attack from a certain location. Although I'm glad that they aren't that hard because I couldn't control the character well, it wasn't satisfying to beat the bosses this way.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished the game in 3h. Some of that playtime (~0.3h) was spent in finishing the grindy achievements where you have to kill a lot of enemies. The game can be hard when you have to deal with some annoying obstacles, but you can always save before going through it and load it if you fail. Sadly, the ""game over"" screen lasts for a while, eating up more of your time to finish the game.

[b]Problems[/b]
I didn't know that there is another attack aside from the normal gun at first. The game only states that I could shoot with the X and space button, but it never states that you have to stop moving to cast the lightning attack. Guns are also working differently whenever you are pressing arrow keys or not, giving more confusion.

The game autosaves when you open the menu. However, you can get soft locked in a level because of the level design. You can only go to the next level by collecting all ""stars"", but you can't backtrack to some areas in the level. Saving at this point of no return will force you to restart the game from the beginning since it only has 1 save slot.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Not only that the game has a weird mechanic, but the execution itself is falling apart. A lot of your playtime will be spent trying to pass through difficult obstacles that can kill you instantly or trying to figure out the most effective way to clear a level without getting hit. Dodging enemies' attacks almost become impossible due to the weird jumping mechanic, and I couldn't seem to find anything enjoyable from the game. Seeing that there are a lot of better platformers that you can buy, I don't think you should buy this game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play Razor, or RaZoR as it is mostly written in the game, who is a demon set out to save his family. When you come in, a Dooms Day has already started with the residents of Hell on the loose. In fact, it has been five years. Five years since his family was taken. Five years of trying to restore human to their rightful place.

While NightmareZ advertises as a story driven game, it has a basic story that it really does not come into place till later. With the wording it makes it seem that losing his family years ago means that they died, not taken. This is the driving point of why Razor is fighting that takes a backseat unless it calls for it in a certain level. With fighting evil ghosts, and zombies later on, this put into it by giving instructions how to play the game. It would of felt more natural, especially when you can learn this easily by playing through it. Other than this, it is rather forgettable.

After the Eye of Hell levels, level five through seven, it gives sort of an ending that says you're in heaven from what I remember. Than suddenly switches right after that to a snowy place. after this a sort of statistics pop up after a boss, which did not happen to the first one. This makes it seem it is separate entities especially with the change of the chat boxes. The last areas also seems to be rushed, the second to last area going to phase one to final instead of one, two, than final and the last one immediately going to final.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Playing NightmareZ is easy, only needing to use the keyboard to move and shoot. You can pick up health, ammo, and energy to stay alive (energy comes in later as a lightning ability). While the actual gameplay itself is easy in the beginning, it spikes quickly. Going from easily getting the rings and dying a few times to dying left and right. Missing rings and having to restart all over again due to a save point being after a huge cliff you can't jump over.

There are inconsistencies in the gameplay. Other than collecting rings, you get a level where you need to find a key. In a later level you are tasked with collecting snowmen, but an area is blocked off by the same door that was used in the earlier level. Combing the area will not result in a key, but collecting all the snowmen opens it up, having you at -1 keys. The lightning (the thunder skill) varies in length depending on the level. It will reach to the end of the screen but during a boss? No, forcing you to get real close to the boss with a short distance lightning attack. The chat boxes go from having no name, to have names and Razor being called You, and lastly you being called RaZoR(You).

The save system is mediocre, especially when you can not restart a level or go to a certain level. It is based on a pick up item type of deal so it is not based on the info on the level that shows up. This is not apparent till around level nine when you can die if you don't pick up the save point right in front of you and be set to the previous level. Making it obvious you were supposed to land where it was. One of the levels either before it or after further brings it into light as the text saying it was saved shows on the top of the map as it scrolls down. In a level, a cutscene happens but it is also the gameplay at the same time. It does not save and if you skip it will not register that you went to the other level. This is very annoying that it gives false information that skipping is fine. Saves have only been added in recently, and I cannot imagine replaying over and over. I can understand why I see that barely anyone got past a couple levels.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
The soundtrack is repetitive and playing a long time with it does get grating and the bullet sounds do get tiring. I did turn it down after around an hour or two. Once I got out of the first part, I did not know that it changed until it happened to bypass the settings. Even then there was an area that had no music at all even with it turned on. Lastly, the death screen has a loud sound effects to it that is not bad once in awhile, but annoying getting it constantly.

[h1]Art Style[/h1]
It is easy to tell which parts of the game held more importance of art. The scenery is first, of course with it being a platformer game and since it will take up most of the screen. To have the traps stand out by color and how some areas have a point of no return. Most of the bosses are next, having to have a unique design and taking up a ton of space. Sadly this is past the part where the most frustration is. The rings also pop out with it being bright yellow with green and red dots connected. The enemies and the characters are last. The enemies bring attention with their design and scheme, and you with the green and red along with the camera following you.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
With the style of the game, it runs well. However when first starting it up or after a while of not makes it take a while for it to load up. Waiting on a black than white screen for a minute or two until it gets to the menu. Strangely the menu does not pop up immediately, leaving the menu art by itself for a while. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. In the gameplay, there also seems to be a bug with the enemies and certain traps.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
Personally I do not plan on replaying NightmareZ at all, with how frustrating it is to even get past the fifth level and those after it. Out of the six hours of gameplay, most was to get past level five or redoing it due to a bug or not being able to go back to pick up missed rings. Its useless going back to see the story again since everything will reset and there is no way to go by level. The achievements are mostly easy enough except a few, but the special __ boxes which unlock based on a certain designated one. Leading to one not unlocking even though I picked it up at least four times and the other unlocking during the last boss. Along with this there are achievements to kill up to 2,000 enemies (one saying 5,000 in the description) which I don't think is possible since it is based on the individual save rather than over the course of playing despite the saves.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
+ Funny ending

+/- Death screen too long in a title exclaiming you will die a lot

- Points of no return
- Start game leads to restarting your progres
- Frustrating to the point of giving up early on
- No indication of when traps or enemies attack, making it based on luck
- Inconsistencies

NightmareZ sets out to be a retro story driven game that balances dying a lot to player retention. Sadly this does not work. You really just care about trying to get past a level rather than the story. While the ending is very hilarious, it is not worth it to go through the pain of dying over and over hoping a bug never happens or miss anything required. Especially when there is no way to restart a level without restarting from the beginning.

I've seen other reviews compare it to Super Meat Boy, but aside from some blades and drop tunnels, I'm not seeing how they are related.

The game utilises keyboard controls, and after the first couple of minutes I was really wishing for at least a partial controller option. It takes a bit of knack to get the controls to operate how you want them to, and even then they aren't as responsive as you would expect.

Most of the game has you collecting “rings”, shooting at demons and monsters as you jump across and down a multitude of platforms per level. The game is unforgiving if you die, having you start each stage from the beginning though there are occasional save points available.

A lot of this game is just running into things that are shiny and look out of place and seeing what they offer up as far as weapons, save points or abilities. There isn't much of a tutorial, though the splash screens do offer some “tips” like “collect all the r ings before you drop down”. Your mileage on how useful that is, will vary. The music can not be adjusted in-game either. In the end, I had turned sound off as it was far too repetitive and distracting.

If this was 1995, then perhaps the game would be something unique and engaging.

The game is grossly overpriced. If you want to support a first time developer and you don't mind the “Paint” style graphics then you should pick this up during a sale, or as part of a bundle. It's hard to recommend this game otherwise.

From a first time indie developer and game this i would say is better than 50% of the stuff that has been greenlight approved. 

Fasted paced side scrolling platform game and it delivers. It's still a work in progress where the dev has said next version will have the audio sorted along with a few other updates to get it to a polished game.

The game has many levels not similar to each other on the structure, all varied, and for each needs its own approach. The gameplay understandable without any tutorials. We clean the the level of enemies, collect coins along the way, we pass to the next level. At the end of some levels will be bosses. Classic!
