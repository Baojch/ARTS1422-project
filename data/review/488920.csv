About this being the best VR game, I gotta admit that I never gave this game a chance before. Because, you know, immersion, interacting with everything and graphics is the key for VR.

But here, the graphics and design is awesome. The cutscenes and characters are made with love. Soundtrack is cool, gameplay is not super-arcadey considering you're willing to have some control as well...

At the same time I am not too thrilled about more exciting forms of working out such as boxing or other martial arts because I am dumb enough already, I don't need no brain injures to make me even more of an idiot. 

Anyway, this is were this game comes into play, it bridges the excitement of something like martial arts with the safety of something like running on a treadmill... unless you punch something in your room.

The enemies are all varied and require different strategies to beat, so it will take some time before they gets too repetitive. You also really need to move. While you have to stay in one place, you really need to lean to the sides or crouch to dodge incoming punches. You also really need to punch, this isn't Wii sports where you can just fling the controllers around a little. Although I will admit the dodging mechanic can be a bit fiddly at times, especially in the middle of a hectic fight, but I got used to it eventually.

Long story short: this game is a real workout. It's not the most intuitive at times and I don't think it will turn you into a real boxer, but it's a good time nonetheless. But maybe take some Magnesium if you still want to use your arms after playing it.

Don't be fooled by the cartoon graphics, this is a serious boxing training sim. It is hard. While Thrill of the Fight is a boxing sim, Knockout League is (to me) a boxing training sim. Note: I write this as someone who can't get past the second boxer in the fight section of the game hahah.

I have spent many many hours on Thrill of The Fight and its presence means that all other fighting games should be compared to it. Knockout League stands up incredibly well - there is no crossover and this is a very different experience, the two games compliment each other very well, as TotF's training aspect is not nearly as developed as KL's.

OK - the fighting is a little odd, compared to TotF - in Knockout League, fights are more about timing, defending, slipping and rolling, and watching and learning your opponent's behaviour (all somewhat legit things to learn BTW). But don't get this game for the fighting, get it for the training aspect - the drills (pad work) alone were worth the price of admission as I don't have any other game that offers this. BTW if you struggle here with double hits just try to increase your accuracy as you strike the pads. The reflex training is deep and hard work even on normal mode. Heavy bag brings a new level of stamina - set it to hard and keep up for as long as you can.

This game feels like it was created by someone who loves training and genuinely wants to teach boxing skills, as opposed to simulating an actual boxing match in VR.

Note that I said it is a boxing themed VR game and not an actual boxing game.  This is where a lot of the dislike of this game comes from.   So let me get this out of the way right now:

If you want a realistic boxing simulator buy 'Thrill of the Fight'.
If you want something a bit more 'arcade-y' but still mostly boxing, get 'Creed: Rise to Glory'.
If you just want a good VR game in general and you're okay with a boxing theme, then get Knockout League.

I own all 3 and I feel like all 3 have their own virtues.

Anyway, the basic premise of Knockout League is that it's kind of a fictional boxing league and I say 'kind of' because depending on the fighter it can be anything from pretty close to actual boxing to nothing at all like boxing even remotely.  The game is very reminiscent of the Punch Out!! games on Nintendo, but ported to and designed specifically for VR.  And this works.  It works really, really well.

It's important to understand the basic flow of the game: 

You wait for your opponent to launch an attack.  You then react to the attack by dodging in the proper direction or timing your block.  If you do it right, your opponent is stunned and you speed bag on their face.  If you do it wrong you take damage.   And that's it.  You don't throw feints, you don't move your guard around, you don't try to sneak in jabs.  It's a scripted fight and you have to follow the script.  Again, this is Punch-Out!! in VR, not actual boxing in VR.

If you're okay with that then this is a very good game.  If you aren't okay with that, buy a different boxing game.

There are 9 fighters and each has a normal mode and hard mode.  The hardmode cranks up the difficulty not just by giving your opponents more damage, but by making them faster, making them better at disguising tells, and sometimes outright giving them new attacks. 

There is a scoring system based on keeping your multiplier up by not getting hit, which provides a good amount of replay value by encouraging you to compete for higher scores.  Additionally, there are training mini-games which are fun in and of themselves.   So all in all, for the asking price I think the game has a pretty good amount of content.

Overall, this is a fun game and feels professionally done, unlike a lot of other VR titles that feel an look thrown together and half-finished.  The soundtrack is also pretty good, with songs that range from just okay to actually really good. The visuals are crisp and work well.

About the only downside I see is the lack of a need to throw actual punches outside of one specific fighter and one specific training mini-game.  Otherwise you'll mostly be speed-bagging on your opponent's face and taking the time to actually throw a proper punch with proper power behind is counter-productive.  But again, that's why I said this is really more about being a good game in general than being a good boxing game.  If the game made it so all you had to do is block or dodge and just took care of countering and damaging the enemy for you it would still be a good game.",1652104853,1652105255,True,4,0,0.58749997615814209,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The characters are all unique and interesting and have their own gimmicks to fight against which makes each fight interesting on its own and something new to learn and perfect, and Barrage is my Waifu.

Yes, this is Punch Out for VR. If that appeals to you, you're in luck. If that doesn't appeal to you, why not?

Knockout League does exactly what the screenshots tell you it's trying to do. It recreates the reactive, puzzle-like boxing action of Punch Out in VR, and it does it exceptionally well. You'll start out with the easy guys (and gals - the game is refreshingly gender inclusive), and work your way up to the heavy hitters. Each fighter has a unique style, and as you learn their tells, you'll figure out the best way to avoid their blows and attack in response. Get it right and you'll get a chance to lang a few hits before going back on the defensive. Mix up your swings for better results, and pay attention to direction.

The characters are great, the production value is high, and your trainer definitely feels like a throwback to Doc Louis. You'll work up a sweat and have fun doing it (the game will even count calories burned if you want it to).

正解以外の行動をひたすら咎めてくるシステムなので、OculusがCMで言うような「自分勝手に、もっと自由に」をやりたい人には向かない。これはこういうものだと割り切れる人にならオススメ。

[h1]■概要■[/h1]
様々な強敵を相手にボクシングで試合を挑む。主観視点のVR専用ゲーであり、プレイヤーは己の肉体を駆使していつでも自由にパンチを放つ事ができる。……できるが、当たるとは言ってない。

まず自キャラを移動させるシステムがなく、また現実の部屋においても危ないから動くなと警告される。従ってこちらから間合いを詰める手段はなく、相手が間合いの外で踊っていても棒立ちで見守るしかできない。

さらに相手が手の届く位置まで踏み込んで来てくれたとしても、相手は基本的に常に無敵である。不用意なパンチは防がれるか謎バリアに阻まれるか、とにかく「命中した」判定はまず得られない。

対戦相手はそれぞれお気に入りの攻撃、お定まりの連携があり、無敵状態のまま傍若無人に拳を振るってくる。それらをすべて防ぐなり避けるなり完璧にいなした後にだけ、反撃することを許される。

多分だけど、これ見た目以外はボクシングじゃない。

[h1]■戦闘システム■[/h1]
こちらの取りうる防御的行動にはドッジングとブロッキングがある。両手を揃えて自分のアゴ辺りまで持ち上げるとブロックしている扱いになり、単発の軽い攻撃なら防ぐことができる。

ただし構えた直後、グローブが青い光を纏っているおよそ0.5秒の間にパンチを受け止めた場合にのみ反撃が許される。それ以上構え続けると紫の光に変わり、防御自体は可能だが、防いだ後のグローブが2〜3秒ほど透明になって当たり判定が消えてしまう。相手はその間に体勢を整えてしまうので、反撃するにはいわゆるジャストガードを狙う必要がある。

またグローブが透明な間はブロッキングも出ない。それが2連撃の場合、1発目をジャスガし損ねたら2発目は回避するしかなくなる。基本的に間に合わないので実質的にはほぼほぼ被弾確定と言える。

大振りの強打はブロックできないので回避するのだが、ストレート、フック、オーバーヘッド等々スイングの軌道によって、真下、斜め下、真横の5方向に避け分けないといけない。被弾した場合視界が霞んでグローブが透明になってしまい、やはり反撃はできない。


要するに、殴られてもいいから殴り返すといった甘えは一切許されない。防ぐにしろ躱すにしろ、完璧にやり果せないとすぐに自分のグローブが透明になって反撃の権利が消失する。

また敵によっては大げさな予告モーションの最中に短時間だけ「今ここを殴るチャンスだよ」のアイコンが出て、回避ではなく出鼻をくじくのが最適解の場合もあってとにかく動作パターンと正しい対応を覚えないと話にならない。まごうことなき覚えゲー。

[h1]■感想■[/h1]
まず前段階としてそういうジャンルだって事をしっかり頭に刻んで遊ばないと不満が出るのは致し方ないゲームではあるのだが、その前提で遊んでもちょっと不親切だなって思う。なにがって、回避するべき方向が分かりづらい。

強打がくる。ブロックはできないから避けなきゃいけない。そこまではわかる。

仮に相手が右フックを放ってくるとする。向かって左から右に横切るような軌道なので、始点である左に逃げても迎えに行くだけで当たるし、終点である右に逃げても追いつかれて当たる。だからしゃがむのが正解。これはなんとなく納得がいく。

仮に相手が右ストレートを放ってくるとする。奥から手前への軌道なんだから、元の位置から動いてればどこでもよくないか？　ボクシングなんかやったことないので、極論、打ち下ろし以外は全部しゃがめばいいのではとすら思ってしまう。

またブロッキングにしても「手をぐるぐる2回転させてからパンチ」みたいに動き続けてくれればやりやすいのに、大概は「思いっきり手を引いた姿勢で1～2秒止まってから急にパンチ」なので、反応するまでの猶予時間は長いのにタイミングが測りづらくて逆にジャストガードしづらい。

外見にしろ個性的な動きにしろビジュアル的な部分は結構好きで、特に6人目のグローブを8個付けててどれで殴ってくるかわからないタコ紳士なんかいいキャラだと思うんだけど、ゲーム的にはもうちょっとだけアシストが欲しかった。

相手が全身に赤い光を纏ったら強打が来るよみたいなシステム面を説明してくれるチュートリアルが英語音声のみで、英語字幕すら出せないのもマイナスポイントか。",1606446578,1607012744,True,6,0,0.587695479393005371,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Onto the review of the game. This game is what punch out on vr looks like. This plays the same too. This is not real boxing simulator, so dont expect to just punch anywhere.

Sometimes u could interrupt their punches in the middle IF there's  a sign to do that. Blocking is almost useless as u have to do it in about half a secpnd of time before the attack landed. Any faster or slower would make u get pummeled.

Tri-Tip: Perfectly normal fight, the first and only of its kind. The dodging is a little screwy but it's the first level, so nothing too hectic. Compared to the rest of the fights, though, it's quite predictable and boring. Also the fire sound effect in his intro blew my eardrums straight out of my skull. 5/10

Barrage: I love this woman. Her fight introduces sideways dodging, where you're meant to lean out of the way and get in a quick counterattack, a mechanic that will become the bane of your existence due to how poor the tracking seems to be. Maybe it's because I'm taller than average? Still a fun fight, if only because of her personality. 6/10 felt bad hitting her.

Electric Dude: Forget his name. Honestly, I was expecting a german accent or a knockoff Rick impression. Instead I was faced with something ten times more annoying than his finicky dodge windows (and don't get me wrong, those are god damn annoying): his voice. I feel like that was intentional though, unlike the dodging. The ""Knock Em Out"" segment in this fight was especially satisfying for the latter reason alone. I remember most of his attacks being blockable, but the dodgeable ones are nearly undodgeable due to shoddy tracking or unrealistic reads. I'm only human, guys. 4/10

Crimson Fang: I think I got that name right. I fucking love the animation on her mask. It moves like a separate being entirely, making it feel like you're really taking on a two-in-one fighter. The godawful dodging was less godawful in this fight: when I got hit, it actually felt like my fault, rather than the game being broken. 8/10.

Scurvy Jones: As a captain myself, I took this man's inclusion as a personal challenge, and challenge it was: only one of his attacks is blockable, but the dodgeable ones are better telegraphed. However, if you miss the block on his headbutt, you bear witness to the first appearance of an incredibly annoying, nauseating, why-the-hell-would-you-put-this-in-an-active-VR-game feature: visual effects. Your vision literally blurs if he gets the hit in. This, predictably, makes dodging his rage-mode attacks harder, but it also made me feel physically ill to the point that I had to give up the fight and take a break if it happened too much. But hey, he was a fun fight overall. I am de captain now, and all that. Thank god I don't have to deal with those weird visual ailments anymore, right? 7/10

Sir Octocunt: Fuck this guy. As if having to keep track of multiple possible attacks from a single full body tell isn't hard (if fair) enough, you also need to keep track of his arm movements for his arena-covering dodge attack. The problem? HE THROWS HIS ARMS INTO THE AIR BEFOREHAND! Oh yeah, lemme just SNAP MY NECK BACK while wearing the weight equivalent of a CAR BATTERY on my face. Nothing wrong with that. (jokes aside, my neck still fucking hurts from my attempt at this fight. It'd be more reasonable if the devs didn't expect you to stand right up against him like you're about to neck him on the mat.) AND IF THAT WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH, he has an attack that applies those annoying-ass visual effects. Less nauseating this time around, more genuinely disorienting. I'm in the middle of a room in real life, I don't want to feel like I've gone blind while playing a damn video game. Sure, you can block that attack, but he almost always throws in an incredibly-hard-to-properly-time blockable attack that, if timed incorrectly, will leave you completely vulnerable to his ""fuck you I win"" attack(s). Because he has two. The ink, and the aforementioned dodgeable tentacle smash. I managed to reach the third round with this cephalopodian son of a bitch, and I even got ""in the zone"" during the first two. I lost almost immediately because my neck isn't titanium-reinforced and I couldn't dodge his tentacle smashes, which, I might add, he adds an ink spray to in the middle of. 0/10, I hope whoever designed this fight gets the psychiatric help they need.

I'll add on to this as I progress. IF I progress. Again, I'm flesh and bone, and evidently, the devs never accounted for that.",1595400665,1599123248,False,4,1,0.529827654361724854,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's very much a timing game that requires you to make the right move at just the right time in order to counter-attack, similar to Punch Out. Sometimes this feels pretty good, but it can be tough to recognize the difference between some of the enemy attacks and then remember what you have to do, and then actually do it. Because unlike Punch Out, which relies on nice, clean digital inputs (left, right, up, down, etc.), this game is using an analog play space that can feel a little more subjective. So you might feel like you dodged an attack, but because you didn't quite position yourself where the game wanted you to, the opponent's attack still hits you. There's also the issue that if you hold up your block just a little too early, you won't be able to connect with your next attack - your gloves ghost-out and you whiff, which just feels awful.

I'm still recommending it because it's kind of fun to memorize the patterns and what you have to do (just like Punch Out), and landing punches is very satisfying. There's a nice sense of progression through the opponents, which each have some special gimmick to make them interesting. And the art style, music, etc. are all very nice. There's also a calorie-counting feature which I find motivating.

If you're looking for something more simulation-like, try Thrill of the Fight. Or if you want something pretty much smack in between arcade and sim, Creed is a good one too.",1574564663,1574564663,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Хотите хороший фитнес, заряжающий энергией и позитивом - эта игра для Вас!
Любите реальный бокс и хотите играть по реальным правилам, то лучше обратите внимание на другие продукты.

Вас ждут:
- Интересные противники, которые пришли как будто из Денди. К каждому нужен свой подход.
- Полезные и фановые тренировки. Есть даже боксерская версия бит сэйбера.
- Отличная графика
- Прекрасная оптимизация, что позволит играть даже на слабых машинах

Минусы и подводные камни:
- Думаете взять игру для своего ребенка? Противники здесь выходят на ринг эпично - некоторые дети пугаются такого выхода один на один. Победы требуют дисциплины и внимательности. Не всем детям хватит терпения пройти хотя бы первого бойца.
- Так как это аркадный бокс, приготовьтесь, что здесь совсем не все, как в жизни. Не получится отсидеться в блоке или положить противника чередой точных ударов, а бить вас будут не только руками.
- Тут придется бить женщин. И инвалидов. И животных...

В целом это очень крутой проект, настоящий бриллиант. НО нужно понимать, что именно он из себя представляет - АРКАДНЫЙ бокс с мультяшными позитивными, но немного грозными героями.

먼저 비교할만한 게임은 크리드 라이즈 투 클로리겟네요 가격도 똑같고 장르도 같습니다.
차이점은 크리드는 누가봐도 어느정도 현실성이 잇습니다. 넉아웃은 그림체가 아케이드성이 짖죠.
크리드는 정해진 공략법이 딱히 없습니다 넉아웃은 정해진 캐릭터에따라 공략대로 해야하네요
이게 문제가 안되는게 넉다운을 시키면 조금씩 달라지기도하고 무엇보다 움직임여야하기떄문에 의도찮은 하체운동도 합니다.
크리드 매일 3경기 pvp하면서 그래도 어느정돈 익숙해진줄알았는데 이게임하니까 다리가 터질거같습니다 ㅋㅋ 
물론 크리드도 의식한다면 하체도 움직이겟지만  넉아웃은 의식하는게 필수기떄문인거같네요
그다음은 가드 크리드는 머리와 몸에 손을대면 자동적으로 가드를 해줍니다 넉아웃은...가드를 듀토에서밖에 안해봣네요 ㅋㅋ
그만큼 더 움직이지만 많이 아쉽습니다. 제가느낀 다른점은 이정도겟네요. 상체 운동량은 둘다 비슷할거같습니다.하체는 넉아웃이 높겟고요.
개인적으로 둘다 소지해도 괜찮겟네요 아케이드성 게임과 사실적 게임. 둘다 재미있어요
넉아웃에 점수를 더 주자면 캐릭터가 귀엽네요.

I passed the first 3 enemies by the skin of my teeth, and now I'm fighting one that needs to be punched in the head while they're doing their own attack against me.  My fist goes through their head, and nothing happens.  Even when I'm throwing a full-on haymaker irl.  Or a short jab.  Or a hook.

Where the ref tells a boxer they dodged a punch too well, so the attacker gets a free punch on the defender because the defender didn't dip to the correct side.

It's a game of ""duck left, right, or down, then follow up with 1-5 punches, duck any counter attacks, then follow up, duck any counter-counters, then follow up"" and if it actually tracked my hands, I might enjoy it.

The game controls feel really good for the most part. There's enough fighters and mini-games to keep you coming back for a long time before you master everything. The fighters ooze personality. It's a great workout.

On the minus side, blocking feels weird because of the timing. You have to do it in front of your face regardless of where the attack is, and you have to do it early, but not too early. You pretty much need to already have the opponent's attacks memorized. If you could ""just block"" the attack as it happens instead of going an awkward interval early, it might be more engaging in VR.

That would've added a ton of value to me. I also don't remember if these fighters have visual bruising or not, but if not, I wish it did. When you compare this to Thirll of the Fight, at $30 I think this is a bit too pricey. $25 is the sweet spot. I actually enjoy Thrill of the Fight more since it's more natural, but lacks the polish this game has. But Thrill of the Fight is only $10. If these two games would have a baby, I'd be ecstatic. So your options are either price ($10 vs $30) and game style (arcadey vs more realistic).

I only do not play it more because it is so exhausting and 5 out of 7 days of the week i am already doing a non vr sport and you really can not play this when you are already exhausting.
Do not mistake this as a realistic boxing game. This is an arcade game. It would be better described as a boss fighting game where you learn the patterns of the bosses and react accordingly by dodgrind, blocking and interrupting.
This is probably the only game where i am looking forward to any dlc. I would gladly pay 10€ for 3 additional fights.
There are currently ""only"" 9 fights available, but while this may seem like a small amount it is really more than enough. Every fight is very difficult(maybe with the exception of the first 3 introductory fights). You will need multiplie tries for every new fight/boss to learn how to fight them correctly. The fights are all very different and very enjoyable. If you manage to complete all fights you get a new game+ which is much harder and is the point where the real challenge starts. NG+ is a lot harder and even the easiest fights will challenge you.
If you ask me this is one of the few must have games for vr. It looks nice, sound is pretty good, controls are awesome and offers plently of content. I can only really see two downsides with this game: It is so exhausting that i can not play more and blocking is pretty useless in NG+(currently at the time of this review).

근데 트레이닝에서 배운 기술들이 막상 경기에선 그리 많이 필요가 없을 수도 있습니다. 그냥 잘 숙이고, 빈틈을 보면 면상에 손을 빙글빙글 돌리기만 해도 어느정도는 먹히니 말이죠.(...) 하지만 진짜 권투경기답게 플레이하고 싶다면 코치의 말을 잘 듣고 명심하면서 트레이닝에 임할 필요가 있습니다. 그리고 손을 빙글빙글 돌리거나 멀찍이 피하는게 꼭 만능인 것은 아닙니다. 이는 ""크림슨 팡""(4탄)과 싸울 때 확실히 느끼게 될 겁니다.

열심히 트레이닝을 하고 왔거나 연속으로 경기를 뛴것 때문에 체력적으로 지친 상태라면 다음 경기에서 패배할 확률이 상당히 커집니다. 움직이는게 무척 힘들테니 말이죠. 체력이 아주 좋은게 아니라면 적당히 쉬는 것도 중요합니다.

You'll often have series of three balloons that'll come in arcs which end up being a hook punch, straight punch, uppercut, etc. They get mixed in with quick jabs, dodges, and blocks. My first time around was a blast once I got the hang of what hand was what color. After that it was a just trying to beat the score. Each round you get better and better and the adrenalin starts going. Then you're exhausted.

This game is the big VR Brother of Pounch Out!
A wide variety of opponents await you, all with different attack patterns, weaknesses and personalities.
To succeed you will have to recognize the enemy's attacks and counter or dodge appropriately.
The punching feels great, the block mechanic is solid (it prevents you from constantly using block and forces you to be more active and precise) and dodging needs to be done with your whole body and not just with your head,

Next to the story mode, in which you wil fight increasingly more insane enemies, there is also a training mode wher you can practice punch combinations, fast hiting and Hit/Dodge coordination.

The art style is bright and colorful, just like the characters. Voice acting is done very well and overall the atmosphere is wonderfull, you really feel like you're in the ring and fighting for your life!

A word of advice to players who are not that fit (like myslef): This game will tire you out. Your arms and legs will get tired and you'll run out of breath after a few fights, so take a break and drink every once in while ;)

Another interesting feature of this game is the calorie counter: Enter your height and weight at the beginning of the game and it will (more or less accuratly) count how many calories you have burned while playing the game. A nice little feature.

Overall a very enjoyable game!",1523367537,1523367617,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Knockout League goes even further: as an arcade-style boxing game, this is one experience that teeters on exhausting.

Knockout League is the sort of game is where virtual reality truly shines. In classic ""Punch Out"" format this would be a fairly dull game for 2018. But in VR it's an immersive, enjoyable and astoundingly atmospheric experience. And a sweat-inducing, calorie-burning one, too.

Knockout League is a well crafted, beautiful-looking game; its cartoon-style graphics are superb, the characters are colourful and the animations are astounding. 

The controls are incredibly simple, too: throw punches by pushing your hands out in front of your while holding the controllers; block by raising your hands in front of your face. There's no need for button presses, as Knockout League is entirely based on movement.

After the initial tutorial, you're tossed into the ring with a real opponent and the fighting begins in earnest. It's tough at first, but satisfying. This is an arcade game, not a boxing simulator, so it's not gruesome, its cartoon graphics are often amusing and playful.

There are currently nine opponents in total, each of whom has their own characteristics with different moves, fighting styles and outfits. There's a woman who punches in quick combos, a mad scientist with bionic implants and metal legs, a boxing octopus, and all sorts of other lunacy.

You need to learn the opponents' styles and moves in order to win, as dodging and timing is everything. Each time you defeat an opponent and they get back up, they then have a new set of moves or additional punches in their repertoire. This means you need to play through each a few times to learn how to defeat them more easily.

You're essentially shadow boxing as you're not actually hitting a real object, but there's no awkwardness as you can't see what you actually look like. It quickly works up a sweat. 

One of the Knockout League's highlights is its calorie tracking feature. Entering your weight into the game and letting it calibrate based on your height will allow the game to give you an idea of roughly how many calories you've burned during a play session. We found we were averaging around 50 calories per round of play. Considering each round is only around five minutes long, if you can manage half an hour of play you'll have certainly contributed towards the burn.

Overall, Knockout League is an absolute smash hit. K-O!

*Reviewed on the HTC Vive*

Let me preface this by saying I've been taking MMA for 5 years, including boxing & muay thai. I still have to take breaks between sessions & fights to wipe off all the sweat.

Knockout League is probably the most polished VR boxing game to come out, yet. The game looks gorgeous. I can max out the graphics options, even on a GTX 970. With 9 varied opponents & 3 tiered training modes, it has a lot to offer. Each opponent has a different strategy, so throwing 1-2-1-2's won't win the match; neither will a tricky offense, unfortunately.

Being patterned after an arcade boxing game comes with its own pitfalls. Your offensive game exists primarily blocking/slipping/bob&weaving your opponent's attacks, then countering with a 6-10 hit combo. When you're sparring in real life, anything more than 2-3 strikes will only tire you out. A competent opponent would cover up, counter, or step out of pocket, by then. It also doesn't have the strategic depth that I was hoping for with feints, parries, set-ups, etc. Bob & weaves can be tricky, and VR tracking also can't effectively tell the difference between a light/probing punch and a power punch. That last point is a limitation of VR, in general.

My criticisms belong to a niche - minor nitpicks that could make a great game even greater. I think this belongs in every VR gamer's collection.",1519277257,1519277292,True,92,6,0.859733343124389648,2,True,False,False,False,,,

This aspect of the game made it more than just a simple hack-n-slash or button masher like Hyrule Warriors or Bayonetta, both of which I never enjoyed completely.
This however just like Punchout on the NES, gives you interesting puzzle-like combat that forces you to learn your opponents patterns. Looing back, it reminds me a lot of Zelda bosses. The way there are three phases, in which the tactics change somewhat, even if it is sight. Puzzle/ strategy games interests me infinitely more than fighting games and that's why this game hooked me. It made me keep playing for a VR experience that was able to last longer than the usual session lasts for me. This surprised me quite a bit, as this games is also very exhausting and a great workout (It keeps track of burned calories!).

Die kurze Spielzeit ist eher meiner mangelnden Fitness als dem Spiel zuzuschreiben.
Gegen insgesamt 5 verschiedene Gegner stellen wir unser Können im Ring unter Beweis. Zusätzich bietet das Spiel einen Trainingsraum mit verschiedenen Trainingsmethoden und unseren Coach, der uns fleißig trainiert und anspornt. 
Die Hauptaufgabe ist es natürlich, der Meister im Ring zu werden. Und das ist gar nicht einfach.
Anstatt wie willd einfach drauflos zu prügeln, müssen wir in Knockout League auf unser Timing achten, rechtzeitig Ausweichen, Blocken und Kontern. Dazu wird uns vom Spiel ein Bereich vorgegeben, in dem wir zu stehen haben, wir tänzeln also nicht um unseren Gegner herum. Wer Realismus erwartet, sollte also zu einem anderen Spiel greifen. Der Spielspaß geht dadurch auf jeden Fall nicht verloren. 
Die Gegner unterscheiden sich in ihrem Kampfstil, und man muss ersteinmal durchschauen, wie die jeweilige Taktik funktioniert. Um so toller das Gefühl, wenn man es endlich geschafft hat, seinen Kontrahenten auf die Bretter zu schicken. Ich bin beim ersten Mal auf die Knie gesunken und habe die Arme hochgerissen. (noch vor dem Sauerstoffzelt)

Das Spiel kann durch eine hervorragende Grafik und Vertonung punkten, und ist körperlich wirklich fordernd. (Nicht umsonst ist ein Kalorienzähler eingebaut, wie genau der ist, sei mal in Frage gestellt)
Auch die verschiedenen Trainingsmethoden machen Spaß und bieten Anreiz, sich selbst verbessern zu wollen.
Wenn man nicht Bewegungsscheu ist und keine wirkliche Boxsimulation erwartet, ist dieses Spiel auf jeden Fall einen Blick wert.

One thing to be aware of is you have very limited space to move in terms of room scale.  You are pretty much forced to stay in a spot and take your opponent head on.

It's right up there with Rec Room. There's a number of things that make this game exceptionally good.

Fun atmosphere: The devs put a lot of personality into this game. The graphics are cartoony and light-hearted. The competitors are dressed in outlandish outfits (or are outlandish species!) and are as dramatic as any WWE soap opera. They have some hilarious animations, both in reaction to getting hit and otherwise. And, when in the ring, you won't be able to resist strutting around for the crowd :)

Replayability: There are currently 5 opponents to fight in the ring but also many training modes. Each opponent is quite unique and either encourages or forces you to master different skills. The fighters follow patterned attack sequences that the player must first learn to recognize and then learn to counter. Most players will get many hours of enjoyable, skill-based challenge from mastering the ring. Afterward, you can refine your punching speed on the speed bag, test your memory and technique against trainer Doug's mitts, or try your luck in the alley; where you'll have all your skills tested under a barrage of projectiles. Each training comes with different difficulty modes plus a stamina mode that lets you keep improving your time indefinitely, serving as a great measure of your increasing fitness and skill!

Full-body involvement: For me, the more physically involved a VR game is, the more I like it. This one has you ducking, weaving, and punching like a madman. No other game has brought me to complete physical exhaustion! :D Not only is it more engaging and fun, it's also satisfying to know that I'm getting a real work out while playing!

Good mechanics: The game works pretty much exactly as intended. The physics are solid. The gameplay is skill-based and intelligent; quite reminiscent of Dark Souls-style combat.

Good music: I think there's only one track at the moment but that's not so bad because it's a good one! Really gets you pumped!

Active devs: The devs are active both in responding on the steam forums and also in frequently updating the game with new fighters and new training modes. They've been very friendly and informative, in my experience.

I really can't recommend this game enough. It's super fun, it's great exercise, it performs excellently, and it's cheap! What's not to love? :D",1510197039,1510197039,True,4,1,0.560439586639404297,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This needs to be a little more boxing and a little less Punch out on the Wii, dodging is bad, certain punches are spotty, crimson tiger the second fighter is bullshit, sometimes you dodge, sometimes you hit, there is no reason, the devs say timing, but if thats the case the timing window is so small it doesnt even register a punch on a right hook into her face after you slip her windup, as my fist goes see threw and passes harmlessly through her only to reapear after Ive returned to a neutral stance, which the game also always reads as blocking, which would be fine if that didn't ""eat"" your block. We have 1:1 hand and head tracking damn't, use it. The game also needs to do a better job of explaining certain things, like why even though the punch was on the overside of the room it still hit, or that crimson is invicible unless staggered and that you have to hit her seven times in a row without getting hit to stagger her so you can hit her. 

Thats what makes this whole thing infuriating, this is a fun game, with good graphics and design, until you actualy get to the fighting... what does it matter if I can throw 2 left straights, a right upper cut and a hook if there is no point to doing those combination. The game works out more to dodge ('slip"") throw a right hook that sometimes works, if the npc is staggered unleash flurry of jabs. Also a major part of my issues is that the npc will be WIDE OPEN, but be invincible as its not time yet to hit them, so your fist just lightly taps them and they ignore it like the fly it is.

In particular the dodge mechanics. It just feels so excessive in regards to how low you need to squat or move from side-to-side and it's impossible to 'out range' their punches. You basically just keep getting hit until you learn where exactly you have to go.

The huge issue I have with the game is it's basically just a scripted encounter and you never feel like you're in control or winning the fight. It's always just wait for the tell, react, get your pre-determined amount of punches in and repeat until your opponent falls. If you throw a punch during down time you get absolutely no reaction/feedback at all which feels terrible.

Your damage is also dependent on dodging so simply blocking a punch causes you to lose any momentum you've built up. This essentially makes the strength of your punches not matter as long as they're quick enough which is fine.

The focus mitts training is essentially just 'memory' but with punching. I had fun initially up until they start throwing in subsequent dodges which lead me to just quitting because I could not dodge the 2nd dodge in a row whatsoever no matter what I tried. When you start to get to the longer 'combos' (e.g. 112134526) the time it takes for them to get across completely kills your momentum, shorter but more combos is so much more fun and realistic.

They were right! And it's a load of fun. Fighting opponents is a pattern recognition game, but you still need to do a good deal of punching, dodging and blocking. The training is actually the part I like most, probably because I bought this game with the idea that I would use it to make my workouts fun rather than fighting. It even keeps track of how many calories you burned, although I am not sure how accurate it is.

I was surprised to see that the game would actually figure out from the speed of my punches whether I was putting any power behind them. So if you just want to casually place your hands in the right spot just to get the game to register that you ""threw a punch"" you are out of luck. You actually have to do the work.

If you want to play it without causing yourself injury however, read a bit about shadowboxing, in particular how to pull punches, as if you don't try to stop your arm before you fully extend it you might hurt yourself.

Anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

EDIT 16 AUGUST 2017: Devs added new workouts, Reflex Alley being the one I find most fun. This has now become my favourite VR game from a fitness point of view.

Aside from fighting against NPCs on the ring, here are the workouts you can do:

1. Speed bag (can do it with weighted gloves if you want to up the game)
2. Dodge drills
3. Block drills
4. Focus mitts
5. Reflex Alley.

The Reflex Alley will throw random objects at you, rather than in a pattern. It differs from some of the focus mitts drills since the workouts are never the same. You have a red glove and a blue glove and you need to hit water balloons. There are red and blue water balloons – ideally you want to punch them with the correct hand.

You also get thrown a basket ball, which you are supposed to block and a weight which you want to dodge.

The mode throws everything in the mix and there are 3 difficulties to choose from and an endurance mode.

I own Box VR, and with the introduction of Reflex Alley in Knockout League I basically have no reason to play that other game as Knockout does the same thing and does it better (and does more things).",1498563710,1502888788,True,9,0,0.636077284812927246,3,True,False,True,False,,,

There are training modes available, too, that'll help you stand a better chance in the ring.

Thanks to some cartoonish stylisation, Knockout League's graphics look great without being too taxing on your rig. The aesthetic lends itself well to the type of game Knockout League is aspiring to be, with characters that would fit right into the pages of a comic book. The sound design, too, is well thought out. The music and SFX gel very well with the arcade like, fast paced gameplay. My only complaint in this area would be the slightly hokey voice acting for your personal trainer, which while not the best, is certainly serviceable.

Knockout League is a rare VR treat; Well designed, well made, with promising future features thanks to regular developer support (for the moment). Most importantly it's a lot of fun to play and to watch others play.

Pros
Nice Cartoon Graphics
Very Responsive
Comfort level is high
Immersion is great
You really do build up a sweat

Cons
The fighters punches are very limited and repetitive. Once you have played a character a couple of times , you know what punches to expect. They each only have 3-4 moves
Some punches just don't register.  They are blocking but you come in below the block, hit them in the stomach and nothing. It ruins the immersion and gameplay. Easily fixed by having the opponent move his block, or take a hit.
Very light punches still do damage. I think that softer and harder punches should register different with the boxer. You can beat an opponent easily just by tapping him. 
NO multiplayer- It could potentially be great


The bare bones are there and I think that if the developers really put the effort in this could be a fantastic game. I wish I had waited for more some development before purchasing but these are the risks of early access.

My review is due to the awfull dodge system, to dodge you have to go to a determinate direction, each enemy can attack from 5 directions and you can dodge to 5 directions, the game track your movement not your position so if you go to the correct side it will count as a dodge even if you get hit in game, but if you go to the wrong side it counts as a hit even if you are miles away fro the enemie punch. You cannot block the 3rd fighter and for me is almost impossible know how to dodge him, sometimes I get hit and sometimes I don't, I try to go to the logic side when I see him coming but I still get hit, I tried to beat him for 1 hour and end up frustrated because there is no way to use the logic when someone is spaming hits and you cannot dodge any of them,  you don't know if it is because you are going to the wrong side or you are doing a bad timing.

5此游戏值得购买，卡通风格，非正统拳击的街机游戏玩法，让人欲罢不能，汗流浃背。

It's an awesome feeling to knock an opponent out. The abilty to hit as hard as you want without hurting anyone and making yourself fitter makes this a must buy if you want to use your Vive to shed a few pounds.
I love this game and am lookng forward to its completion.

It has supplanted SwordMasterVR as my favorite physical combat game. And don't be fooled by the videos - this game might look ""cute"" but it is intensely physical to play, and feels viscerally violent. If it were too much more realistic it might be too much, really. 

Opponent sophistication: I've unlocked the second opponent-character so far, and haven't managed to beat her after several attempts (which doesn't get old because after every time you manage to hit her enough times in a row to daze her, she adds another set of moves to her repertoire). 

Exercise factor: I find as I get really into this, it starts to feel natural to put real force behind the punches, all of them. When I'm doing it, my brain thinks I'm actually fighting (despite the fact my opponent is this sort of early-Pixar-looking crude 3D model). This definitely elevated my heart rate and breathing to levels consistent with a hard sprint, and kept it there - to the extent that I start getting hit because fatigue or lack of breath is slowing down my reaction times. Also, despite being pretty athletic I find my shoulders, traps, and obliques are extremely sore after about an hour of play. Also my feet. 

Experience/realism: The haptic feedback is extremely well timed with the sound effects and the visualization of the impact (theopponent jerking back, etc). I can't quite describe how visceral it is. You really get this jolt of adrenaline and a sense of satisfaction when you land a hit, or especially a series of hits. This is an extremely well put together melee combat mechanic that motivates real physical investment in the fight while also requiring quick thinking to figure out how to beat opponents.

Room scale / other considerations: I am fully utilizing my play space dodging and rushing not just with my body but with my feet. A lot. If you wear shoes, you'll make a LOT of noise. If you wear socks, you slide around. Barefoot, I had best footing. But be warned, if you aren't used to that, the fast lunges and dodging around will be very hard on the feet - particularly around the edges and the pads of the toes (blisters or friction burns on all of them).

I'm really looking forward to beating this person so I can see what interesting characters the other two early access characters are like. GREAT GAME!

Now ---- the wishlist:

1. Multiplayer. Obviously. I don't care if I can't see my opponent's legs, or they don't have special moves. Just the block/rush/dodge/duck/swing mechanism is enough (with voice chat...that's really essential) to let people interact in this way.

2. At some point, you're going to need to have the characters start learning. I suggest you have them start throwing the player's own punches at them (exactly the glove movements relative to their head...when they reach a certain proximity). And then record how the player reacts (how they move to dodge it, or if they block it, and what kind of follow up punch they attempt). And then have the character make exactly that reaction when a similar punch movement is tracked. You might have to slow it down a bit (at least when first introducing the move) and gradually speed it up. Then the player will actually be learning good reflexes.

3. Special moves. Pleeeeease? With really cool special effects and the announcer calling it out, etc. It doesn't have to be unrealistic street fighter stuff (though...wouldn't that be fun). Just cool things similar to what the characters get. Like an unblockable punch (with a long wind-up). Or a fast combo (that your trainer teaches you at some point, when you unlock it) that makes your gloves catch on fire.

4. Why don't WE get to be announced and have some cool showboating gimmick that the crowd goes wild for? When I saw we were picking our nicknames by selecting one word from each of two lists, I thought that was the idea (since you could combine ""Beast"" (roaring) with ""Wicked"" (with hellfire or a pentagram or something) so that when the announcer calls ""in this corner, the Wicked Beast"" I'd see flames rising around me in a star shape and a load roar. Or whatever.

Anyways, I hope any or all of those end up part of the completed game. I'll definitely be playing this in easy access while I wait!",1486274001,1486274912,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,False,,,

here's how it works thus far: you stand in the center of the ring. if you move your head with the proper level of intensity, which isn't really well explained, you will trigger a dodge. the dodge is apparently invisible, so you can't tell if you triggered it too early, too late, or not at all. while your punches are 1:1, the animations are not - you can get punched even if the punch animation is nowhere near your head. this becomes obvious if you try to step out of the way instead of move your head.

if you're imagining moving around the ring and really using that room-scale, you can't. your opponent will stubbornly stand in the center of the ring and stare at the circle you are supposed to be in. it's kind of like boxing a gif. he won't follow you like an actual boxer, he won't try to guide you back to the middle of your play space (but you will get a helpful error demanding you return to the fight if you move too far away). he will just stand there and throw punches at the location you're supposed to be in, and you will have to ""dodge"" them. you have to try very hard to not shatter the illusion that you're in a ring.

Works great with the Rift, it doesn't seem to use the 3rd sensor, so if you're having 360* tracking issues (360 tracking is still in experimental phase at this point so give Oculus a break) I don't think it matters here. I didn't have the need to turn around at all in the first two fights. So if it does come to it in the final two fights, I'll update the review. At this point, you're good with two sensors 180* tracking (which isn't a problem on the Rift) and you're fine with 3+ sensors because it doesn't seem to need the back sensors at all. 

It seems really early access at this stage. Only 4 opponents, and it's really just a, ""Memorize their pattern"" game. If you don't block or dodge at that time you don't get an opening and the opening is just on punch until you get enough punches to daze the opponent in which you get to do muliple punches on them. It's incredibly basic at this point, and if it wasn't in VR it'd be a terrible game! 

It has a ton of potential, I recommend it. And please don't refund it, the developers need to continue developing this game. It needs variety in fighting style and it needs to not be a scripted fight, meaning they do the same thing over and over until you memorize what they're gonna do.

Now that it's out of beta I had re-downloaded the game to give it another try. I must say it has improved a lot. Most of my complaints has been addressed. I will leave my old review up for comparison but with modifications in parentheses.

This game is very polished, has nice graphics, and will give you a good workout. I was sweating a lot from the 2nd opponent. Some negatives...

 - Game starts off with you wearing gloves in opposite hands. Nothing major but it's annoying having to remove wrist straps just to swap controllers.
 + (Update: Game now loads with you wearing gloves in the correct hands)

 - Pricey for a short game with only 4 opponents, but it's in early access so more to come.
 + (Update: It now has 8 opponents making it worth the asking price)

 - Can't change graphic settings until after tutorial and it starts on the lowest settings.
 + (Update: You can now change the graphics and all settings when the game begins)

 - During tutorial if you hit your trainer he gets upset and repeats his lines from the beginning.
 + (Update: You can no longer hit your trainer)

Overall a fun game but not worth the asking price. Yet...
(Update: I feel this is now worthy of a purchase with all of the updates it was given. They have added some nice presentations to the boxers and doubled its roster list. This feels like a Mike Tyson Punch Out game from the NES but in VR. I am now recommending this game.)",1485410741,1518671196,True,0,2,0.504413604736328125,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a boxing game where you can't punch your opponents.  Yes, that's right, you can *only* counter them!  Also, the game is not room scale.  You are required to stay in a specific area of the ring and wait for them to come to you.  If you exceed their boundary limits, the game will halt.

For a game that advertises ""1:1 punch movement that lets you attack how you want."", that's a total load of baloney.  They will block every jab you take at them.

Basically, you must read their super-slow telegraphed attack, remember what you're required to do (dodge, punch, or block) and then swat at them quickly and aimlessly like a catfight.  Forget about perfectly executed hooks, uppercuts, overhead smashes, body blows, etc.

There's also something weird about the game: There are only four opponents, and the coach and first two weakest opponents are all black: an old black coach, a huge dumb Mike Tyson-like boxer and a black ""jungle woman"".  Wouldn't it be weird if the first three characters you encountered in a game were all Slavic, or Latino, or Asian, or [fill in a random race here]?  It would be different if the remaining two boxers were of somewhat proportional balance, but instead we have a white pirate and a octopus.  So we have three black people, a white pirate, and an octopus to punch at.  It struck me as a bit weird, like a stereotype of who participates in boxing.  I'll let you come to your own conclusions.

追求现实风格的拳击VR游戏的就不要买这个游戏了，看画风和人物就知道是不同风格，这个更注重游戏性。当然，拳击的爽快感还是有的，而且消耗体力程度不比真实风格的拳击少，甚至更耗体力。尤其是在你打得激烈时，现场发出的欢呼声，令到你就算累了也越打越有动力。

这游戏胡乱挥拳是没用的，有一定的规则技巧，主要就是：躲、挡、打。虽然暂时只有4个对手，但难度一个比一个高，每个对手都有特别的技能，每次最多打完一个或两个对手就没体力了，要打通关并不容易。你被打倒后的效果也做得不错，尤其是在打累了的情况下，真有点要晕倒的感觉...

以上这些设计，再加上配乐、配音、画面等各种气氛的营造，令到这游戏虽然不是真实风格的拳击游戏，但拳击的氛围与爽快感可能是最好的，就像是提取出了拳击的灵魂，兼具游戏性与真实性。

这游戏可能令人最扫兴的地方，就是靠近游玩空间的边缘时，游戏会暂停，直到你走到中央等三秒后才会恢复。如果游玩空间比较小，那么就会频繁暂停，会影响爽快感。这应该是为了防止撞墙，毕竟拳击是高危VR游戏，控制器杀手。游玩空间比较大的话，基本上没啥影响，而且相当于给了个暂停功能让你休息，不然太累了！这样的设计有利有弊，最好的解决方法就是给一个选项开关，提醒玩家自己负责可能的损坏。",1485341516,1485341516,True,4,1,0.50309675931930542,0,True,False,True,False,,,

　　游戏的打击感十分真实，几乎是拳拳到肉的真实反馈令游戏的体验十分畅快。除此之外，游戏还不是单纯的会挥拳就能了事的，跟现实中的拳击一样，你还要会格挡、闪避等多种动作，灵活在场中游走，动作性非常强。
　　目前《拳击联盟》在steam上售价为61元，支持HTC和Oculus使用。游戏的动作操作性很强，真实还原现实拳击的各个动作要求，如果你能有足够的空间玩这款游戏，一定会让你觉得跟真实的拳击比赛相差无几，推荐玩家们购买。但目前游戏的价格还是有些偏贵，感兴趣的玩家们可以等游戏降低40%~50%的价格再购买体验。

I really wish it was possible to set the starting position in each fight, the default one fits my playspace very poorly and makes the game hard to play.",1485306904,1485310371,True,14,0,0.647187650203704834,2,True,False,True,False,,,

There are no training mini games involving bags. They're grayed out. The only training is mit work with the trainer. The game is pretty hard. I couldn't beat the second boxer, a woman, during my first 30 min. You can't fight the next two boxers until you beat her. There are four total. I don't recall seeing a life bar. It seemed like you had to hit the opponent perfectly in a set sequence to knock him/her down. I prefer a life bar that you can whittle down over time. Assuming this gets more content, it's worth it.
Update: I've played this for 1.2 hours and have beaten all four boxers and done the training twice. 
1st boxer: Beat twice on first attempt (update lost my save, so fought him again)
2nd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat
3rd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat (watched a guy beat him, then beat him myself)

Below the line is my initial review, here my new thoughts after having fought all enemies and tested the new 'Fitness' update:

All 4 enemies are great and since the re-balancing feel a lot more fair and at the same time some attacks have become more challenging. Some fights can be difficult, but still feel fair at all times. The difficulty ramp is still here, but it got nerfed a bit, while the last enemy has gotten harder (which I appreciate as in the initial release he was too easy/weak).

The developers have now implemented an alternate grip for the gloves which make them more similar to the default grip for Vive controllers in Thrill of the Fight. This allows a much more natural grip to punch the enemy. This change came after some community feedback, so they definitely do listen to the things posted here on the Steam forums.

The latest content update has brought 2 mini-games to Knockout League: Focus Mitts and Speed Bag.

Focus Mitts: my favorite new mini game where you have to land jabs, hooks, uppercuts in certain sequences as well as dodge attacks in the harder difficulties. There is easy, medium, hard and a stamina mode available right now. In the stamina mode you're only allowed to do 3 mistakes before losing. This mini game is exhausting in a good way. Great addition to the game!

Speed bag: this one hasn't excited me that much. You have to punch a speed bag with a certain speed, either with your left, right or alternating both hands to score points. Again, there are 3 difficulty settings and one free punching mode. Not that exciting after one go. I wish they'd gamify that mode more.

[b]Conclusion[/b]: I can still recommend this game to anyone looking for a Punch-Out like boxing game. If you want a more realistic boxing game, I still recommend Thrill of the Fight like in my initial review. Both games have their places and I enjoy both.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you played Punch-Out in the past? This game is Punch-Out in VR!

My first impression after having played through the tutorial, beat the 1st and 2nd enemy, and failed against the third enemy twice: fantastic game, achieves what it wants to do (Punch-Out in VR), highly polished visuals, very active combat.

If you expect to get a realistic boxing game, then this isn't for you (there is an octopus as an enemy...an octopus!). But if you enjoy a pattern-recognition based arcade boxing game that requires you to pay attention, be quick on your feet/block reactively, then this game is for you!
If you want a semi-realistic boxing game, then Thrill of The Fight may be a better game for you (can't recommend Kunlun Fighting, is significantly worse than Thrill of the Fight). This game and Thrill of the Fight stand in two separate game genre's even if they superficially seem to belong to the ""boxing"" genre.

Knockout League allows you to dodge, however, you also have to counter quickly to get a hit in. The game doesn't require much space as it wants you to dodge sideways rather than backwards.
You can also block enemies' attacks by timing it. If you block too early, you won't be allowed to counter back. This makes the game a lot more exciting!

Currently the game's difficulty level is ramping up quickly and it is unlikely that you will be able to beat all enemies in one go. This is actually a good thing and you'll notice that with repeated matches that you simply get better and better to read the enemies' actions beforehand and overcoming such a challenge is always satisfying.

There are still a few minor bugs I've encountered that are already mentioned in the early access page above.

I can recommend this game to anyone that liked Punch-Out, likes more active VR games and people enjoying challenging fights.

First impression:  Already the most polished and fun boxing experience in VR.  Just as much exercise and immersion as Thrill of the Fight, but it feels like a full-on game with training area, some character customization, fleshed-out environments, etc.

Also:  be ready for a workout like with Thrill of the Fight.  You'll be ducking, dodging and dancing even on the first fight.",1485288926,1485288926,True,11,0,0.604021251201629639,1,True,False,True,False,,,
