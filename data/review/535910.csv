Two paws up!
8/10 stars

I adore cats and I like to play mahjong, so this was an insta buy for me.
I was very pleased with the gameplay, and I've continued playing long after I reached 100% achievements.

PRO
Lovely artwork is done in a cat theme - Tiles are beautifully done with cats, cat-erpillars, butterflies and flowers - a lovely change from the ""classic"" patterns you often see. A cat's eye gives you a hint, a cat paw shuffles the tiles, and a cat turning around undoes your last move.
There is a great variety of layouts across 120 boards, in a variety of shapes from classic layouts to hearts, arrows, etc.
I liked that the the unclickable tiles were greyed out / dimmed; without requiring some kind of power up.
Achievements made sense, there was no unpleasant grinding - you can be a casual gamer and enjoy relaxing fun while still making progress toward your goals.
Music is pleasant, it blends into the background without being annoying or distracting.
Family friendly, safe to play in front of or with little ones.

CON
There are controls to turn sfx and music on/off. It's an all-or-nothing deal though - it's ALL the sfx or NONE of the sfx - which is sad because some are cute and some start cute but become annoying. When you match a set of tiles there's a ""meow"" - it's cute for about the first 5 minutes, but grows increasingly annoying as the hours of gameplay. Ditto the hint button sfx - when you match a set of tiles, the hint button is removed for a few seconds, then it comes back with high/low sfx. I found that VERY grating; and wished there was a way to turn just that particular SFX off while keeping the other SFX on.
It would be nice to have a counter showing the available pairs of tiles to be matched. I've only seen that feature in one other mahjong game I've played, but I really liked it and wished more games would include it.

TRADING CARDS / BADGES
Trading cards are on the more expensive side to collect, but the badges are adorable. The emotes and backgrounds are cute as well.

VALUE FOR THE MONEY
Solid value. I found this game is great fun to play to take a break from a more immersive goal driven game, when you have a bit of free time, or just need some de stressing. I enjoyed collecting the achievements, but I've continued playing this game long after I reached 100%.",1590365327,1590365327,True,6,0,0.607601165771484375,0,True,False,False,False,,,

大约是4399级别的游戏效果，感觉上要更高一些。
比国内的烂大街中老年益智游戏连连看系列要简单，某种意义上也要难。
简单在于没有3条直线的限制，难在立体堆叠更容易眼花，覆盖机制也不是很明确。
比起听久了有些厌烦的喵音效，背景音乐意外地还不错。
当你没得消的时候会以喵爪桌面清理大师的效果帮你洗牌，有时候一喵爪下去直接会把剩下的牌扫出画面，关卡计时也会在这个时候停止，这意味着你可以开心地重开关卡了。触发几率不是很高，一百多局只遇见两次。这是个bug没错了。

推荐给成就猎人，这一款游戏属于稳扎稳打有付出有收获的成就作品，不会让你躺着拿成就，也不会刻意刁难。
也许你会发现打穿游戏竟然还有两个成就没有解锁，游戏共120个关卡，成就最高要求三星通过200关卡。怎么办？
刷以前的关卡就行了，第一页的第二个关卡超简单，十几秒一局，我推荐。

It's a charming game, and it delivers what it promises: a good mahjong game, with cat themed art. I think the inclusion of butterfly stuff is a pun about cats and caterpillars.

There are over 100 levels and they're all pretty different. It's not just the same square layout over and over. If you like traditional mahjong layouts that would fit in with the Windows 95 mahjong game, or you want weird and wacky ones like a car, sword, or heart, you will find yourself satisfied (or should I say...catisfied?).

My peeves are...

...the music (it's repetitive and on a VERY short loop, think a minute or so)

...the art (the art is not mahjong style art organized into groups, e.g. some numbers or whatever, and so it lacks a cohesive look of the type I'd expect for any board game's pieces)

...the heart rating system. How quickly you beat a level = a rating from 1-3 hearts. I get 3 hearts with little effort, HOWEVER, my boyfriend does not, so maybe I am just really good at Mahjong. This isn't a major peeve given I am unsure that the issue is with the system rather than with my perception of the rating system.


Do I still recommend it?

Absolutely. Best mahjong game on steam, due to the number of layouts alone, and the fact the mechanics work, unlike some other games. If you want a cute cat version of the Windows 95 mahjong game, but with more layouts, and cats (did mention the cats? because there are cats) , then this is the game you want.

The game music is on a loop and it gets a bit old after awhile, but its pretty nice. Also, if you leave the game sound on, the game ""meows"" at you each time you match tiles, which can be kind of annoying after awhile.

Bug wise, I only found one. If I ran out of matches and the popup window came up to reshuffle, if I clicked the ""shuffle"" button too quickly, sometimes the tiles wouldnt respawn. Solution was to slow down and it worked perfect.

if you have a tile above a tile and they're the same tile and they're the last 2 tiles you obviously have to reshuffle but when you do the bottom tile is left shaded(unclickable) even both tiles are on the same level after the shuffle, I've lost two times so far because of this and it's very annoying please fix it soon

another bug found
when you shuffle a board and its relatively still a complete board like 90% or enough tiles still there to keep the artistic design and you have to shuffle, when you press the shuffle button the image gets flipped in a direction and sometimes the image gets flipped in a way that puts certain tiles in a design outside of the window (inaccessible) so shuffling should just shuffle the board not flip the image.",1478684817,1478685454,True,1,0,0.474051058292388916,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Meow Jong does exactly what it sets out for and provides a simple but fun single player experience. Now it’s really hard to mess up a more simple game I feel and the game proves correct with no bugs or any major glitches through the timescale in which I played. I’d recommend this game to young children and gamers who are looking for something simple and something which provides a little challenge. 

Meow Jong provides quite a lot of content with around 120 boards which I found really impressive, navigating through them all was a bit tedious and painful because you have to click the arrow button which takes a long time because of the move animation. I’d love to see just a simple drop down box perhaps instead. 

There is also a score system for each boards and the quicker you do them without hints the higher your score can get and you are rated out of three stars, with three stars being the highest. Getting three stars on some of the boards can be pretty challenging. The great thing about the boards is that they range from very easy to actually pretty hard boards, with some of the boards being really challenging for me to hit three stars.

The only downside is the audio track just loops over and over and over until you hum the music with insanity but fortunately you can turn the audio off. It would be nice for a variety of backdrops too or different noises and tiles. This game essentially does exactly what it sets out to do, and does it very well.

I just played some Meow-Jong, I really like it and think it would be an awesome start for a a child / beginner and even an experienced player looking for beautiful Cat themed boards.
Since I have played Mahjong or Shanghai on computers dating back to the Tandy TRS-80 / Color Computer days I have to say this is too cute, and too much fun!
Meow-Jong is a fun variant of the original game from China dating back to the Qing dynasty in the 1600's.
Being I am a serious gamer it is nice to have a relaxing game to go to with smooth music and nice graphics.
The cat meow in game makes our cat come over and start rubbing on you, No kidding.
So far the game runs puuurfect in every way on my 4790K Windows 7 64-bit system.
I can visialize variants of this game in the future, Like Dogs, Hamsters, Fish or even a mix of animals.
This is a simple yet fun and challenging Mahjong type game.
Could we please have a version coming to Android? If so I'm in!
Well Done Pixel Barrage!",1478265294,1478265294,True,16,1,0.590620279312133789,1,False,False,False,False,,,
