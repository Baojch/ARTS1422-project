[quote=] Das Spiel funktioniert nicht auf dem Steam Deck. Dort habe ich es auch ausprobiert. Alle Texte sind unlesbar. [/quote]

FIVE: Guardians of David ist ein Actionrollenspiel ähnlich wie Diablo und Torchlight. 
Abseits der Geschichten um Trolle, Orks und andere Fabelwesen, beschäftigt sich dieses Spiel mit einem Abschnitt aus der Bibel. Und zwar, wie der Name es schon vermuten lässt, geht es hier um David, der laut altem Testament nur mit einer Schleuder bewaffnet Goliath erschlug, sowie seine 5 in der Überschrift genannten besten Männer. Aber David direkt steuern wir nur kurz, denn die Hauptrollen übernehmen seine tapferen Krieger.

Die Geschichte hier ist für solch ein Spiel hier sehr interessant erzählt. Es gibt immer wieder einen Comic (englisch mit deutschen Untertiteln), in dem die Geschichte dargestellt wird, es gibt viele Gespräche zwischen den Figuren in Spielgrafik und zusätzlich sind sehr viele Informationen zu den verschiedenen Ereignissen und Personen in den Leveln in Form von Steinhaufen versteckt. Sobald man eines davon entdeckt und angeklickt hat, wird eine Information wiedergegeben und auf Wunsch kann sogar der Bibelnachweis angezeigt werden. Das fand ich doch sehr unterhaltsam und es motivierte mich dazu, diese Steinhaufen gezielt zu suchen, um zu erfahren, was es Interessantes zu erfahren gibt. Es gibt noch ein paar zusätzlich für das Spiel erschaffene Stellen, diese werden aber auch als solche in den Informationen ausgewiesen. 
Bitte nicht falsch verstehen, das Spiel versucht niemanden mit Gewalt zum Christentum zu zwingen, es ist eine Geschichte wie aus jeder anderen Mythologie auch. Auch die Dunklen Seiten der Charaktere werden beleuchtet. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3090992192

Die Abschnitte im Spiel bestehen meist aus mehreren Leveln. 
In jedem der Level gibt es viele Items, die meist von erlegten Gegnern eingesammelt werden können. Hier greift auch die übliche Suchtspirale und man versucht immer bessere Ausrüstung zu bekommen, die auch immer wieder zu finden ist. Es gibt viel Sammelbares und das Inventar ist anfangs auch recht schnell voll. Aber sobald man in der ersten Stadt ist, kann man die Ware beim Händler loswerden. Damit das Inventar nicht zur Frust wird, hat man mehrere Hilfen eingebaut: Einerseits wird die Frequenz der Begegnungen mit den Händlern später deutlich erhöht. Andererseits wurde im Spiel die Möglichkeit der Spende eingebaut. Unterwegs finden wir seltsames Zeug wie Nahrung, Textilien usw. Diese kann man später spenden, es gibt drei mögliche Spendenempfänger, bei jedem davon kann man Waren spenden. Zusätzlich akzeptieren alle Schekel (das Gold im Spiel), was auch dazu führt, dass immer chronischer Geldmangel herrscht. Das ist aber auch gut so.  Erzielt man beim Spenden einen Etappenerfolg, winken Belohnungen wie eine komplett neue Inventarseite, die die Menge an Sammelbarem drastisch erhöht. Ich habe das Spiel mit 4 Inventarseiten beendet, die ich nicht komplett zwischen den Händlerbesuchen füllen konnte. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3090992114

Neben den ganzen guten Sachen gibt es auch ein paar ärgerliche:
Die Bewegung der Heldengruppe lässt schon mal zu wünschen übrig, weil sie immer wieder an unsichtbaren Kanten hängen bleiben können. Es ist nicht so, dass es nicht weitergeht, aber solche Sachen sind recht lästig. 
Auch das Speichern ist seltsam: es kann ein manueller Spielstand angelegt werden, der aber trotzdem beim letzten automatischen Speicherpunkt lädt. Es kann sein, dass so wenigstens neue Ausrüstung gesichert wird, das weiß ich aber nicht genau. Dafür speichert das Spiel recht häufig automatisch. 

FIVE: Guardians of David ist für alle empfehlenswert,die auf Beutejagd gehen möchten und der Suchspirale verfallen wollen, immer bessere Ausrüstung zu finden. Und wer auf Errungenschaften steht, bekommt hier 100% beim Abschluss der Kampagne.

Ele é inspirado em um período da vida de Davi, mas atenção: ele não segue totalmente o relato bíblico e faz questão de deixar isso claro dentro do próprio conteúdo do jogo, como a adição da personagem Ariella. Então, é importante estar atento a esse fato para não confundir tudo o que é apresentado no jogo com o relato bíblico.
Os gráficos são bem feitos, com cenários bem detalhados e sem aquele aspecto genérico. Pelo contrário, a atenção a diversos detalhes nos ambientes é um ponto positivo, com um aspecto profissional. Os diálogos são narrados em inglês, acompanhados de legendas (também em inglês como idioma padrão, mas existem outros disponíveis para as legendas, porém, não o português). O fim e o começo dos níveis são contextualizados por histórias em quadrinhos (com as falas interpretadas enquanto os quadrinhos são mostrados, mas em inglês) desenhadas por Sergio Cariello, o mesmo ilustrador da Bíblia em Ação, e que também já ilustrou revistas de superheróis como Homem-Aranha, Batman, Superman, Homem de Ferro, dentre outros. Enfim, posso dizer que a produção me surpreendeu positivamente.
A jogabilidade é boa, porém, o ""pathfinding"" dos personagens é falho. Sempre é necessário clicar em vários pontos do caminho quando seu personagem fica ""preso"" em algum ponto do cenário, a inteligência artificial não consegue desviar de obstáculos por conta própria. No entanto, se você puder conviver com isso, o jogo é bem agradável.

I wish they'd implemented additional difficulty levels;  once you're geared early on the game becomes way too easy.  Lastly,  the five guardians profiles irked me from beginning to end.

다윗의 용사들입니다.
대충 성경 내용에 나오는 다윗에게 충성한 자들을 플레이하는 게임이니 파이브 가디언즈 어쩌구는 너무 긴거같아서
그냥 다윗의 용사들이라고 하겠습니다.. 종교 없어서 잘 모릅니다.

등각있는 RPG, 종교에 기반을 둔 스토리. 재미 있긴하지만 나쁜 플레이 경험이 다 잡아먹습니다.
그럭저럭 파밍하는 맛도 있고 몹 몰이도 할라치면 꽤 되는 편이라 나쁘진 않아서 추천을 주려다가 비추천을 주는 이유.

단점
- 게임 상에 게임 충돌이 너무 심합니다.
 적군과 거의 비슷하게 비벼지게 되는 순간 거기에 그대로 끼어서 움직일 수가 없습니다.
이런 장르의 RPG를 해보신 분들이라면 아시겠지만 무빙샷이라는게 상당히 중요한 요소인데 적군이 앞에 스폰되어서 조금 비벼지게 되면 잠시동안 이동이 정말 불가능합니다. 비벼져서 끼게되면 그냥 못 움직입니다.
배경 내에 오브젝트와 게임 환경 디자인 자체에 신경쓴 면이 보이지만 그거 전부 캐릭터와 조금이라도 비벼지게 되면 그때부터 마우스 클릭 퍼즐이 시작됩니다. 캐릭터를 빠져나가게 할 특정 위치를 찾아 미친듯이 클릭을 해야합니다.
게임 충돌이 이렇게 심한데 바닥까지 울퉁불퉁하게 지형디자인을 해놔서 캐릭터가 제대로 걷지도 못하고 허우적거리는게 게임 내내 계속되고 같이 따라다니는 캐릭터들은 물론 적군까지 충돌이 나서 캐릭터 오브젝트가 덜덜덜 떨리는게 게임 내에 지속됩니다.

- 캐릭터 AI가 지형 충돌과 맞붙는 순간
AI 바보같아요. 진심 바보입니다. 적어도 스킬이라도 써줘야지 게임이 돌아갈텐데 평타만 씁니다.
제가 조작하는 캐릭터외에 컴퓨터가 조종하게 되는 캐릭터들은 데미지가 하향되어서 움직이는 것 같습니다.
이럴거면 움직이는 AI 캐릭터를 왜 넣은건지 모르겠습니다. 플래시로 하던 플래쉬맨은 스위치도 되던데.
캐릭터 AI가 지형과 붙어서 충돌나는 순간 캐릭터가 따라오지 않기도 해서 급하게 가다보면 사라져있기도 하고 조작불능 상태가 되어있기도 하고..

-마스터 볼륨, 음악볼륨 다 조절가능한데 성우 목소리 볼륨은 왜 조절 못하는거지?
예. 성우 연기까지 뭐라고 할 생각은 없었는데 게임을 하다보면 스킬을 연타할 때가 생깁니다.
스킬이 쿨타임일 경우 성우들이 대답하는 ' 아이 캔트 두 뎃 ' 을 플레이 내내 들어보세요.
스킬 연타 좀 할 수도 있지 자기 지금 스킬 못 사용한다고 찡찡거리는걸 계속 들어줘야합니다.
옵션에서 아무리 찾아도 목소리 음소거가 없는 것 같습니다.
오죽하면 마스터 볼륨까지 다 없애고 플레이 해봤는데 성우 목소리 만큼은 안 줄어드네요.
미친게임같으니라고 

게임을 하다보면 모아브 사막 스테이지에 보스가 두명이 나오는 스테이지가 있습니다.
한 명은 창을 들고 한 명은 활을 들고 플레이어를 반겨주는데 그 중 창을 든 보스의 기합소리가 진짜 너무 짜증이나서
지금 여기에 비추 주는 40퍼센트는 저 보스 목소리 때문이라고 생각하세요.
60퍼센트는 지형 충돌 버그 입니다.


마지막 보스랑 싸우다보면 제가 조작하던 캐릭터가 아예 캐릭터 창에서 사라지는 버그도 있습니다.
마지막스테이지 쯤 가다보면 게임이 크래쉬를 선물해주더라구요.

구매는 여러분의 몫이지만 저는 경고했습니다.
게임 오브젝트에 이리 치이고 저리 치이는 경험을 해보고 싶으신 분들은 추천합니다.
성경게임이고 종교가 어떻고를 떠나서 이 게임은 플레이 자체가 굉장히 불편했습니다.
아니 땅이라도 제대로 걷게 만들어놓고 성경을 넣던 뭘 할것이지

The bible has some really intriguing tales to tell and yet it is always kind of ignored in videogames.
If events from it are picked up then it's vague and metaphorical - what we have here is a history lesson come to life...
The ""caches"" littered across the game-world teach you interesting events of the surroundings of (King) David with the matching biblical passages. The intermissions between the levels (which are indeed very linear) are nicely drawn and pretty to look at (they are even voiced), so are the character portraits.

The ideas of a good game are definately there but...well...here we go with the negatives which are certainly dominating:
- the pathfinding (worst of it all): it is so atrocious, I don't know what to say...it's not only the AI pathfinding but also the movement in general...if it's Gods will you shall move...if not...you're character will refuse to do any step in any direction...
In the sneaking-related-level it was especially annoying...not only that the sneaking felt out of place...no, it even was barely possible to sneak and assassinate the enemies because the character didn't move and when she started moving she did it in the wrong moment. I had no influence on the movement scheme which is an absolute no-go...
- the AI: as others mentioned...it's plain bad. The characters that you aren't controlling at the moment will only use their normal attacks, and it's impossible to switch between them fast enough to take advantage of all of their skills...I imagine this would be much better if every ""guardian"" was controlled by a human player, but that's not how it should work...
-the items: there definately is a broad choice of armor and weapons, but their stats are so strange, the ""rare weapons"" sometimes are immediately surpassed by ""white"" common weapons...that's no incentive to look for better, rare equipment...
- achievements: if it wouldn't have achievements it would be okay, but is has achievements and they're not working for some. I can not get more than 3 achievments, it just stops at that, they are bugged...
-the levels: they are uninspired and often small and narrow...which doesn't help with the weird movement of the characters...
- the boss fights: the bosses sometimes get stuck during the fight...that's not what an epic boss fight should be like...

FIVE is a diablo-light. Rather than make the player choose how to increase their stats, you just have a small party that you can switch between, and they level up in the areas they're good at(the first two for example are an archer and a dude with a hammer. Hammer dude gets more health and strength, archer dude gets ranged damage and speed, etc.). This part of the game works, and it's actually kinda neat having a CPU buddy to diablo hunt with you.

Unfortunately FIVE suffers from severe lack of polish. Characters constantly get caught on level geometry, have trouble interacting with objects, and there's no QoL options like a loot highlight button. The first few cutscenes are quite lavish artwork with text, then later levels are capped with poorly placed comic-book style narration.

Speaking of narration, FIVE's voice acting is somewhat...rough. It's not grating, but you'll find yourself dreading in-game cutscenes where you can't skip through the dialogue. There's also a definite tone shift between what are clearly biblical influences and the game's own writing.

Is It worth the 10$?! IS IT?!
well, for starters I can tell you no wonder it's mixed reviews.
On it's core it's a basic ARPG, more like a demo, feels a bit unpolished, but I didn't encounter too many issues. The main problem of the game is you don't really control five because well, the AI does nothing besides spamming regular attack. And taking control of each of them is a MESS, if you take control of one mid combat, he/she stops lifting it's blade taking 800 damage and then you control it. I'm not kidding, it has major gameplay issues, and that's where it falls into a negative review.
The story tho, and the comic book and just the innovation is just special. So it does show a lot of potential. Overall it's OKAY game. Death doesn't really matter though btw, you just get resurrected and bam back to the fight you go so you can die and fight until the boss die, which is lame.
I'm sorry even though the price really tries to respect what you get it falls a bit short at least for me and I can't give it a Positive Review. Pathfinding was somewhat issue but not a major just a minor.
Anyways, I give it a 6/10 Okay+ Shows a lot of potential though, bad design.",1569861372,1569861372,False,1,0,0.488034665584564209,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Rozgrywka jak to typowy klon diablo 3 - 2 umiejętności pod klawiszami myszki i 4 na klawiaturze.
Innowacyjne dla gatunku podejście do drużyny - grasz wybraną postacią, ale w każdej chwili możesz się przełączyć na dowolną inną. Każda z nich ma inne umiejętności i inny styl walki. Każdej trzeba na bieżąco wymieniać ekwipunek na lepszy. Brak tylko nekromanty/przywoływacza, ale kiedy grasz jedną postacią to 4 pozostałe robią za miniony - więc jest nieźle.
Na początku walczymy z kilkoma wilkami i lwem jako bosem - potem już tylko zarzynamy chordy wrogów w postaci... ludzi. Dość nietypowe jak na hack and slash-a. I obrazuje w dosłowny sposób, jak niektóre biblijne sceny nie trzymają się kupy. Inna rzecz, że nie wygląda jakby było to intencją autorów. Całość okraszona cytatami z biblii.

Ukończenie gry wywołało u mnie lekkiego moralnego kaca. Co innego zarzynać hordy demonów, mrocznych kultystów, bandytów czy innych potworów. Tutaj tłuczemy w żołnierzy wroga. Drobny szczegół - w większości wypadków to my jesteśmy najeźdźcą!
Ale to nie powód do negatywnej oceny.

Ta gra jest po prostu zła.
Postacie zacinają się na niewidzialnych przeszkodach. Kiedy grasz w 5 postaci - wystarczy zmienić na taką, która się nie zacięła i po przejściu jakiejś odległości - pozostałe się do niej teleportują. Ale jeżeli jesteś w sekcji, gdzie grasz tylko jedną postacią - takie zacięcie jest równoznaczne z rozpoczęciem poziomu od nowa.
Debilna sztuczna inteligencja. Wróg atakuje głównie kontrolowaną prze ciebie postać. Można po prostu biegać w kółko a wrogowie tylko będą Cię gonić, a w tym czasie pozostałe postacie będą ich siepać.
Przedmioty tworzone w sposób losowy zainspirowany d3 ale bez większego pomyślunku. Nie ma to jak zezłomować złoty przedmiot, bo i tak chodzisz z niebieskim, który wylosował cechę +1000 do obrażeń.
Kamera jest tragiczna. Nie przeszkadza mi fakt, że nie da się jej obracać. Irytuje mnie to, że teren jest trójwymiarowy i możesz kliknąć gdzieś, gdzie nie da się dojść - jeżeli wejdziesz za skałę tak, że zasłoni Ci widok - prawdopodobnie utkniesz tam na dobre.
Nie wiem jak można zepsuć sterowanie w tego typu grze - ale pogratulujmy autorom - im się to udało!

I found myself picking Beniah off the bat right away in every mission, I liked his abilities and general play style. My second favourite would have to be Shammah with his wasp grenade as that was really useful most times. While this does not mean that the other characters are not good, it is just that I preferred the overall damage dealing route over cool tricks and crowd control abilities of the other guys.

While this is perhaps my most favourite game in the ARPG field, I must admit that once you have played through each mission and gotten all the relic stones to fill in the Biblical background of what is happening, there is really no replay value, I went through each map fully and got all the stones and finished the game in about 20 hours or so. The boss fights are a little easy in which if you die, you just respawn and fight the boss again and whittle him down over time. This means that the game (in my opinion) was intended as more of a narrative device rather than a challenge of gameplay as you go through the maps, kill the enemies and get the stones and read the comics. While I honestly love this format, I can see how this is not for everyone, in the mid and late game, you are very overpowered and most enemies I had fell in one swing so it became a battle of attrition to just dwindle the numbers and get through the maps.

Some see this as a negative, but I honestly don't care, I played and enjoyed the game how it was meant to be played (in my opinion) as a game based on the Biblical and historical King of Israel; David and his mighty men.

Overall, a shortish type game (total playtime about 20-22 hours if searching for relics) but a highly enjoyable game where you see historical events come to life.

On the less bright side, there's no real ending, the story just kind of stops after the story of Uriah the Hittite, and the gameplay can be relatively awkward, with no hub city being available for about half of the game, controlling five characters at once being more of a gimmick than anything, and it generally being a lower-quality Diablolike.

I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Action RPGs and to those that like Tactical RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age. It is an Action RPG but it also allows us to control a party of heroes, that makes it kind of unique in itself. So in a way it is like playing Baldur's gate without a pause option.

Some of the things it does well is lots of equipment drops, I found adequate equipment so that Benaiah had a weapon that did 1500-5000 damage each hit. I didn't need to replay any levels to get gear, and still managed to one-hit kill most archers. I honestly don't understand why some developers think it is fun for us to replay levels a thousand times to get decent gear. If I want to farm I will go put some seeds in the ground and in a couple months eat what grows from it. Not this cyber farming torture that developers think is fun for us.

Each item took up one square in inventory. There was no need to Tetris equipment in the inventory trying to get it all to fit. That to me was a nice plus! The inventory was expandable by donating things like grain, livestock, weapons, and money. Each tab of Inventory was 8x5 with four tabs so 160 items carried once you have all four tabs. There is also a stash which I never used but if you are a hoarder there is an option for you. Speaking of money I never had to bother wasting time buying gear so donating to get more merchants or more inventory tabs wasn't a problem either I still had a lot for my character's retirement plans. 

The game doesn't take hundreds of hours to play, that was another bonus to me most people say 25 hours I idled mine a bit when caught on a mission and had to do family stuff so I am not sure how long it took me. We don't have to replay the whole game to get missing achievements by playing all the classes, because you brought the whole team and just click between them while you play. The leveling went okay and the enemies seem to scale well to the level I was when I fought them. I was level 33 when I finished my play through. The best part is the developer didn't make us run through the game two more times with increased difficulty because they are too lazy to create more content to get to that character level 75 etc.

To recap the positives:
Multiple Heroes in a Party to control!
Every piece of equipment takes up one square! Forty items each tab.
Expandable inventory up to four tabs. 160 items then!
No need to replay levels over and over for equipment!
No need to replay the game again to play the other characters!
No need to replay the game two more times in the guise of more difficult!
No need to spend the spare time of an entire year playing it!

To recap the negatives:
Those people that want to play a game or level over and over again to get to level 99, to find that special item, or got fooled into thinking the game is going to be more fun on increased difficulty might be disappointed. Those people that might want to make multiple trips to the merchants to haul all their loot and playing Tetris with their equipment to do so, might be better off buying Tetris or another game.

First of all, as the other reviewers have pointed out, the game does have rather substantial pathfinding issues. You will be getting stuck near objects very frequently as you are walking through the maps. Now most of the time you can simply take a step back and slightly alter your route. This is not, however, always possible, and sometimes you have to switch your character entirely because the other character is stuck with no means of getting unstuck apart from changing the character. Now this is also fine and dandy as long as you are playing one of the maps where you commandeer more than one character. However, when that happens in a map where you are controlling just one character.....whoopsie daisy...it's time to restart the whole map. I won't get into other issues much, but the skill tree system is rather bad. Basically consisting of 16 or 20 (can't remember) individual skills of which you can equip four. Problem is that when you find a skill that works fine for you, and that will probably happen very early on in the game, you will have zero reason to switch to another skill. So what also ends up happen is you rack up a bunch of level up points with nothing to really do with them.

Una de las cosas más llamativas del juego es su ambientación, aquí nuestras aventuras no discurren por mundos imaginarios ni por oscuras mazmorras medievales, tenemos a nuestra disposición los lugares mencionados en La Biblia, sí, las localizaciones son las de las sagradas escrituras, con interesantes escenarios llenos de bonitos colores y efectos de luces, nos moveremos tanto por escenarios al aire libre como por ciudades, el nivel de detalle es interesante, no son gráficos de última generación pero sí resultones. Son correctos para un juego de estas características, salvando las distancias, recuerdan a los de Titan Quest, pero sin tanta libertad de movimiento ni lugares secretos.

Como decíamos todo está basado en las escrituras, al igual que la historia, y es un punto muy interesante este puesto que el argumento, narrado en forma de cómic, está directamente extraido de los libros, son citas o partes pertenecientes a los testamentos, además de los personajes; si bien hay gran parte que se inspira, lógicamente otra buena parte de la trama ha sido creada por los desarrolladores, puesto que no contaban con demasiado material, y tuvieron que tomarse muchas licencias para crear una trama divertida, que querremos continuar hasta terminarla. También en forma de secretos fáciles de encontrar, nos toparemos con pequeños pasajes de los textos, para ayudar a la inmersión en el juego. A mí el tema de la religión me importa poco, pero he visto este detalle como original. 

La jugabilidad, el punto más importante de un juego, en este caso tenemos el juego típico de rol-acción estilo Diablo, con la ambientación que mencioné, pero en este caso son cinco los personajes jugables que controlamos, todos ellos con un estilo de juego diferente entre sí, que podremos intercambiar en cualquier momento según nuestros gustos, el manejo es rápido y ágil, aunque algunas veces muy rígido, que nos costará avanzar por el escenario, o momentos en los que nuestro personaje se quedará clavado ante un obstáculo invisible; también a veces falla el sistema de apuntado y golpes. Cada personaje tiene su propio inventario, armas y objetos a utilizar, así como sistema de habilidades, muy interesantes y divertidas de utilizar. El combate funciona, no está pulido pero funciona. La interfaz recuerda bastante a la de otros juegos del estilo, en general copia cosas de otros e intenta a su vez aportar detalles originales al conjunto.

Los enemigos funcionan como la mayoría en estos juegos, carentes de inteligencia artificial, van a golpear a todo lo que se mueve sin importarles su vida, son fáciles de combatir, aunque a veces por la cantidad suponen un desafío. Resulta divertido utilizar explosivos y ver cómo salen volando sin remedio un puñado de filisteos..., también hay interesantes jefes finales, normalmente colosos con habilidades especiales y más energía. Las misiones son variadas, con muchas secundarias, no se hacen repetitivas en ningún momento.

El sonido del juego es normal, sin nada destacable, aunque las melodías son interesantes puesto que se adaptan a la perfección a lo que estemos viendo en pantalla. Las voces sí son destacables; todo el juego ha sido traducido al castellano, tanto interfaz como el cómic de la historia, hay algunos fallos pero es reseñable la traducción.

En definitiva, un interesante juego de rol-acción, con sus fallos, con detalles que hemos visto mil veces, pero a su vez con puntos originales como la ambientación o historia, es un juego corto pero si pasamos por alto los fallos de diseño o de jugabilidad disfrutaremos las horas que nos dure; hay muchas mejores opciones, lógico, pero en este caso merece la pena no dejarse llevar por los prejuicios y darle una oportunidad.

Genre: Hack n Slay

Gameplay: mit fünf wechselbaren Charakteren (F1-F5 Taste) schnetzelt man sich durch die 11 Akte. Es gibt haufenweise Loot, pro Level ein paar ""Verstecke"", welche Hintergrund-Informationen zur Story liefern. Das Kampfsystem geht sehr flüssig von Hand, es gibt einen Skilltree, richtig eine rolle Spielen tut es wahrscheinlich nicht was man skillt. Die Kämpfe sind vom Schwierigkeitsgrad her in Ordnung, die Bossfights sind am Anfang des Spiels fordernd, nehmen aber dann mit besserem Equipment mehr ab. Ab einem gewissen Akt hat man eine Basis, zu der man nach jedem Akt automatisch zurückkehrt. Dort kann man auch Geld, Rohstoffe, Waffen und Rüstungen an 3-4 Einrichtungen spenden, die dann ab einem gewissen Perk neue Inventar-Slots oder Truhen-Slots freischalten. Ebenso gibt es Personen die einen Buff spendieren. Das Kämpfen macht viel Spaß, die Skills sind abwechslungsreich, auch wenn es keine ""Magie"" gibt. Es ist kein stumpfes Schwert/Axt/Lanze Spiel, die Skills geben dem Spiel schon noch mehr Pepp. Die Story wird in schönen Comis von den Walking-Dead Zeichnern erklärt, ist zweckmäßig und unterhält.

Kritik: manchmal bleibt man leider etwas hängen beim Laufen (ganz selten) und man muss sich mit einem ""Skill"" befreien. Das kann auch bei einem Bossfight passieren (ärgerlich). Das kommt aber eigentlich nur sehr selten vor. Das Problem mit dem Sterben und dass man dann außerhalb der Bossfight-Area spawnt hatte ich nicht. Sonst gibt es nicht viel zu bemängeln.

Fazit: Jeder, der Hack n Slays liebt, wird auch dieses Spiel mögen. Ich habe sehr viele Hack n Slays gespielt: Diablo, Torchlight, Silverfall, Grim Dawn, Fight The Dragon, Dungeon Siege .. Mir gefällt auch ""Five - Guardians of David"".",1525188827,1525188827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Das Spiel ist ein sehr einfach gehaltenes RPG mit isonetrischer Ansicht und eher linearem Handlungsablauf. Es zeigt mit seinem biblischen Thema eine gewisse Besonderheit auf, vermiest aber durch Bugs und andere Schwächen den letzten Spielspaß.

Das Spiel handelt in der Zeit des jüdischen Königs David. Dabei lehnt sich das Siel explizit an die in der Bibel geschilderten Ereignisse an und sagt klar, wo es davon abweicht. Mit Bibelstellen unterlegte Texte, die man ab und an findet, geben einen seriösen Eindruck diesbezüglich. Manche Geschichten, wie David und Goliath, kamen mir bekannt vor. Dass da vermutlich immer noch viel Fiktion und einseitige Sichtweisen dabei sind (z.B. die ""bösen Philister"") kann man aber auch bemerken.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1313323086

Dieser bibel-/historische Hintergrund ist aber auch schon das interessanteste an dem Spiel. Mit zuerst einer Figur, zueletzt mit einem Team aus fünf Helden, durchlaufen wir die meist schlauchartigen Level und metzeln die auftauchenden gegnerischen Scharen nieder. Dabei greifen die Helden manchmal selbstständig zur Waffe und man kann geruhsam zuschauen, manchmal wiederum muss man sie an ihre Pflicht erinnern und die LMB malträtieren.

Es gibt auch Zusatzfähigkeiten, für die die Helden Mana verbrauchen, die den Kampf etwas beschleunigen. Sterben doch alle Helden, werden sie am letzten Checkpoint wiedergeboren, wobei die Gegner sich nicht regenieren, was die Angelegenheit recht bequem macht.

Soweit ich gekommen bin, gab es sogar mal eine stealth-artige Passage, die aber äußerst einfach zu lösen war. Am Ende eines Abschnittes kommt meist ein Bossgegner, so wie beispielsweise Goliath, den heldenmütig nur einer unseres Teams entgegentritt.

Und nun kommt das große Problem (jedenfalls bei mir): stirbt man bei dem Bosskampf, der in einer künstlich abgesperrten Arena stattfindet, wird man am letzten Checkpoint wiedergeboren und kommt manchmal gar nicht mehr in die Arena rein, weil die Absperrung oben ist.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1313319966

Als ich dann ein früheres Savegame laden wollte, war dies nicht etwa der Stand kurz vor dem Bosskampf, sondern der Stand zu Beginn des Schlauchlevels, was erneut eine halbe Stunde ermüdend repetitive Kämpfe bedeutete.

Als mir dies zum zweiten Mal passierte, war die Geduld verbraucht.

Denn das Spiel ist auch ohne solche Bugs ein wenig berauschendes Erlebnis. Es hat zwar formal viele Aspekte eines guten RPG, aber ihm fehlt so etwas wie Tiefe und Qualität.

Sehr oft bleibt man schon beim Laufen an sichtbaren oder unsichtbaren Ecken hängen. Kämpfe (außer Bosskämpfe) sind repetitiv und seicht. Das Inventar ist schnell übervoll, dafür sind Händler Mangelware (ich traf nur einen Händler; wegen der Schlauchartigkeit der Level verkniff ich es mir, dorthin zurückzugehen). Interaktion mit NPC's sind selten.

Ab und an wird die Geschichte mit comicartigen Zwischensequenzen fortgeführt, die an sich nett gemacht sind, wenn sie mich nicht so an die Bildergeschichten der Zeugen Jehova erinnern würden.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1313320601

Die Grafik (abseits der Zwischensequenzen) ist schlicht, zweckdienlich, nichts besonderes.

Der Sound ist OK, aber auch nichts besonderes. Der Sprecher der Geschichte ist nur auf Englisch.

Die Steuerung mit Tastatur ist zweckdienlich, wobei eine Umbelegung möglich ist.

Pro & Contra:

+ Ungewöhnliches, biblisches Thema

o Durchschnittliches, meist repetitves Gameplay
o Einfache Grafik mit isometrischer Sicht
o Schlichte Fähigkeitsentwicklung

- Bugs bei den Savagames und beim Tod während der Bosskämpfe
- Verhaken der Figuren an Ecken des Levels

Wertung: 3/10

Wenn die Bugs nicht wären, hätte man ein schlichtes ARPG, das allenfalls wegen des biblischen Themas etwas interessant ist. So aber macht es gar keinen Spaß.

On the front, this game seems like a solid Hack & Slash RPG game with a rather unique and rare background story. I only clocked a couple of minutes into the game and unfortunatly it is enough for one to discover what is lacking.

There are five characters, each with distinguish items and skills. You may only control 1 at a time while the remaining follows you closely and automatically engage in combat. This is a great idea because playing as a weak bowman character will have other melee character tanks for you.

Voice acting is sub-par. It tries to hard to be dramatic. If you are familiar Diablo and Torchlight series, the controls mapping are similar. UI is good as you don't need to ponder which short-cut key maps to what. All the accessible features are displayed with huge clear buttons. However, controls are clunky and sometimes irresponsive. Clicking to attack or move does not work sometimes. Path finding is non-existance and your character may get stuck easily. 

Animations is one of the issue as striking a moving enemy halts the animation but they are still gliding towards you. A.I. is nothing to shout about. Would appreciate if other characters are livelier. They don't engage in combat enemies gets close within a certain range to them. Safe to say, many elements are pre-programmed with static outcome. Another example is enemy spawns and how other non-engaging enemies will aim for you always.

Sound settings does not work in the main menu. Shutting down all volume will still play the menu repetitive music.

This game can really be something if a little more resource is spent to refine and polish it. Overall, the graphics, soundtrack, character design, combat, gameplay; well basically the core components are there and it isn't a bad game, just plagued by these menial problems.",1506435139,1506435545,False,25,0,0.659311950206756592,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Every time I read through Samuel and Kings I think how awesome an rpg of the life of David would be. In fact, I got into game design myself in order to learn the skills necessary to perhaps one day make such a game. It would seem kingdom games got there first though, and it's everything I hoped it would be.

The action rpg gameplay is for the most part smooth and enjoyable, the various character skills and ability to switch between them on the fly is great, the combat feels great and smashing through hordes of enemies is incredibly satisfying. I love the amount of loot you get, and the various buffs certain equipment gives makes equiping the five feels like I'm making meaningful choices.

The voice acting is excellent, as is the music, and the environments look beautiful and are fun to explore. However I do find myself getting stuck on the terrain on occassion, and this can be a little frustrating when I'm trying to explore every corner of the map to find the caches containing interesting background info on the events taking place.

One rather cool and unique part of this game is the comic style cutscenes, complete with voice acting and sound effects. It's a great way to cover the story of David, and brings a lot of characterisation to each of the guardians.

My only real complaint would be that the game feels a little too easy most of the time, with only a couple of instances so far where I've felt challenged in combat. A harder difficulty mode where you take more damage or enemies feel stronger would probably be something this game could benefit from. Also there is no co-op/multiplayer which is a little disappointing, but as I bought this as a singleplayer game I'm not going to complain about it, it would just be cool to have a friend take the place of the ai.

All in all, a fantastic experience so far that I'm certainly going to enjoy continuing, from a company that seemingly knows how to make quality games.

To me they are always clunky and ineffective. 

Overall presentation and style of the game is good. The fact that there is some tactics to some of the fights was a surprise too. Went in with low expectations in someways. Most Judeo Christian games, in my experience, tend to be either very dull or they feel like they're slapped together with duct tape and tossed out. Lots of similar stories and plot structures. Which sadly echoes how terribly repetitive Christian entertainment can be. But that's just like Hollywood right now anyways. Neither take a lot of risks on stories.

FIVE at least attempts something from a time period that isn't often done and puts their own spin on it. Overall for the better. They explain what is from scripture and what isn't. Which helps. Then also it isn't limited to just the Goliath story which is sadly where so much often begins and ends in Christian entertainment. They like the Goliath overcoming odds thing, but don't like bloody conquests or David's main exploits.

If I have any complaint about this, it's the voice acting. English voices kind of detract from the gameplay for me. Accents seem wrong, English voices a bit over acted. They don't feel natural and that is part due to the script which is so-so at times. Much rather have them done in either Hebrew or Aramaic with subtitles. Be a bit more interesting that way. Course I'm one who favors anime in it's original Japanese most of the time. You learn to appreciate the character which a language brings in.

Overall, decent game here if you are in the audience that would appreciate it. Probably not one if you aren't interested in the history or the story. Or if you have any opposition to it. If this very review makes you mad then you're better off not buying it. Take your anger to CoD or something else.

It's a very easy game--you won't find much of a challenge here--but the different characters and their skills are fun to play, and I do like how the story forces you to play as other people at times. I also appreciate the levels when they aren't generic valleys or hills; some of the town/city environments at night look quite nice with their campfire and brazier flame effects.

The occasional stealth/assassinate segments are a nice change of pace and don't overstay their welcome, though it is amusing to toss a knife into a guy's back and not get any reaction at all from the other fellow standing right next to him at the campfire.

Gameplay-wise, the biggest problem is the characters' pathfinding issues and their tendency to get hung up on the scenery. They don't get permanently stuck, usually, but they do get delayed often, and sometimes they get delayed at the worst time, such as in a boss fight or during a stealth segment. I also encountered a couple of buggy moments that required reloading a save, but they weren't serious.

As for the story, aside from the muddled beginning narration, it's pretty well told via comic-book scenes and dialogue, with only occasional typos or other minor editing problems, though I wish the ending was not quite so abrupt.

I also have to address the character of Ariella, a fictional addition to the tale. In general, I dislike such additions to historical/period works, especially in this case, where she seems to serve mostly as a female player character who contributes to the action. I didn't mind playing as her, though, and she is worked into the story fairly believably for the most part; I just disliked the couple of moments in the comic-book story where she's suddenly a backflipping, stabbing ninja who saves the day.

Overall, I am glad I played Five: Guardians of David. So few games are set in Biblical times, and this one handles the subject matter very well.

Take away the Biblical backstory and you have a solid, isometric ARPG from first-time developer, [b]Kingdom Games[/b], that is both engaging and provides innovative mechanics to a familiar genre. Then put the Biblical stuff back in and you’re given something else, something more—historicity and a brave exploration in meshing religion with gaming.

It’s not that story-driven video games lack religion, just not real-world ones. Taking an existing religion and making a game based on one of its more iconic heroes (in this case David, of “David & Goliath” fame), is begging the overly-critical gaming community to rip your game apart.

However, the game is solid. The level design and backgrounds are lush and gorgeous. The pacing is consistent. The loot and risk-reward system are passable. The music is excellent. If a gamer, unfamiliar with any modern religion, was handed a copy of [i]Grim Dawn[/i] and [i]Five Guardians[/i], she would be hard-pressed to select the better game since both have excellent features and limited flaws.

Beyond the objective view, the game should be praised for the way it [i]does[/i] handle religion, not in spite of it. There’s never a moment where it feels preachy. It’s educational. The outfits, weapons, and landscapes are historical. Where magic is used in fantasy games, [i]Five Guardians[/i] uses miracles. Heroism is portrayed by selfless sacrifice rather than a common rags-to-riches motif. All actual Bible verses are confined to caches, like developer’s notes, scattered throughout the game, but remain separate from the story and gameplay.

Movie adaptations of books have been around for nearly as long as cinema itself.
Forrest Gump, Casino Royale and Harry Potter are a few recent (ok, maybe no so recent) movies that I enjoyed despite having never read the books which gave them life.
The more popular a book is, the more likely you'll end up with a movie adaption (and sometimes a game adaption too) so it's no surprise that we've ended up with movie versions of The Da Vinci Code and 50 Shades of Gray, but there's a much more popular book which has spawned plenty of movies over the years (but not that many games) and that book is The Bible.

[b]A God Book[/b]

There was a famous movie director, Cecil B. Demille, who back in the early days of Hollywood built a name for himself producing biblical themed movie adaptations.
He's even quoted as saying ""Give me a couple of pages of the bible and I'll give you a picture.""
So why do we get biblical blockbusters but not godly games?

[b]A God Game[/b]

Well, gaming is a more immersive and personal experience than cinema and religion can be a divisive thing, there are so many different flavours to choose from, hell, people have even fought wars over it!

Which is ironic when as far as I'm aware (and I haven't read any of the religious books either) that  all faiths, no matter which brand you buy into, preach a message of peace.

It's all love thy Gamer, thou shalt not covert your friends Steam collection, that sort of thing, right?

Yet despite all that peaceful preachery, people have still died over an argument about who's imaginary friend is best.

[b]Good God Game? [/b]

An irony that isn't lost on Five: Guardians of David, an action RPG title which doesn't shy away from its religious roots but has all the hackery slashery of a Diablo title.
So, in this increasingly splintered, ideologically fractured world, is this godly game a good idea that'll sell gazillions  or a biblical blunder that's bound to bomb?
I'm sure God knows but he's not telling so maybe we'll come to our own decision by the time we get to the end of this review.

[b]Dogmatic Dialogue[/b]

When you fire up Five: Guardians of David you'll experience a very verbal (and to a heathen type like myself largely irrelevant) intro movie which reels off a list of old testament names and vague timescales, a summary of this opening narrative (without the names because frankly I can't remember them) would go something like this:

God told A to move to B who had a son called C that became known as D, years later D's decedents moved to E, 430 years after that F led D's descendants from E back to A and then divided A up into bits.

Now it's 400 years later and blah, blah, blah...

If you where familiar with the names and events been recounted I'm sure this would be engrossing stuff, but I'm not, so it for me, it wasn't.

[b]God is Love[/b]

Any way the jist of all this ""second son of a of a brother of a man..."" palaver essentially serves to tell you that there's a king whom God isn't too keen on but it's ok because there's a boy, the titular David, who should be king instead, oh and King number one (The one God doesn't love) is at war and readying his army for a battle.

[b]While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks...[/b]

 As all this is going on, two shepherd boys who'd been napping on a hill top, awake to the horror of death, but this tragedy isn't a result of the two opposing armies in the valley below.

They open their eyes to the shocking sight of a dead bloody sheep.

Puts all the war and Godly favor stuff into perspective doesn't it?

Anyway, this is where you come in, the first two of the five characters you'll eventually control happen to be our ineffective shepherds whose sleepy neglect has led this poor lamb to meet its woolly maker.

[b]Don't Maul the Messenger[/b]

This mindless mutton murder serves as your first task as you seek out the old shepherd to tell him of this sheeply slaughter.

Marching off down the hill side will quickly bring you into contact with a pack of wolves, the murderous mongrels which munched on the mutilated mutton perhaps?

In true Diablo style, you set about clicking on the wolves to smite them for their crimes. 
This encounter will be repeated several times as you journey down the slope.

Take a few steps, whack a wolf with a hammer, rinse and repeat, over and over and over, you can't go five steps without another pack of wolves wondering onto the screen and into your righteous hammer.

At least when they die loot in the form of gold (sorry, I mean shekels) will shower out of their still warm corpses, so that's nice.

[b]Chores [/b]

When you've finished saving lost sheep from the wolves, (not the subtlest of religious metaphors) you'll come across the old sheep keeper and tell him all about the tragedy.

Overwhelmed with gratitude the old man tells you to bugger off and find your mother, she's got chores for you.

A little walk and a lot of clicking on baddies (mostly wolves) later and you'll discover that one of these chores is to go and find your sister.

Then you follow the path some more, kill some more ""bad things"" (mostly wolves) and carry on with the drawn out ""tutorial"" missions as the game winds its way from clicking on wolves and philistine soldiers through to a lion and eventually doing the whole David v Goliath thing, which I enjoyed (even I've heard that little parable! and it was nice to reach a narrative point which felt familiar.

[b]Choppy Chores[/b]

So we know it's a slow burner but how does the game actually play?

Well, you view the action from a zoomable isometric vantage, click to move, click on baddy  to attack etc. It's an ARPG, you know the drill.

You can switch between the five party members to control any one directly, each comes with their own abilities and special actions, all of which you upgrade as you level up throughout the course of the game.

This is a tried and tested game mechanic and is initially quite enjoyable, the problem is that it doesn't take long before things begin to feel a little repetitive, the enemy types aren't varied enough and the spawn points are too frequent which can sometime make the clicky, choppy fun feel more like a chore.

[b]Avarice[/b]

There are plenty of loot drops to fill up your groups inventory, armour, swords, spears, etc. if loot is your thing then this game has you covered.

There's also an auto-equip feature which is a nice touch and saves a lot of time sorting through the inevitable junk pile which you always accumulate in games like this and leaves you fairly confident that when you sell of your unwanted baggage you won't be throwing the baby out with the bath water.

[b]Very Old Testament[/b]

The missions themselves, being tied to the old testament, follow a linier path.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, sometimes I like a single path to follow, it ensures narrative coherence and a tighter plot, the problem here (and it's a personal issue, you're mileage will vary) is that I just wasn't hooked by the story (it almost felt like it was written millennia ago).

As you follow the path through each level you'll come across caches which give you little tit bits of info regarding the game and how its unfolding events relate to the bible. It's a nice touch which lets you know which story elements were made up specifically for the game (as opposed to the elements which were dreamt up for the original work the game is based on).

You can even load up biblical references from these caches if you feel the need to dig a little deeper into the inspiration for this tale.

[b]""Yet you have made him a little lower than God"" - Psalm 8:5[/b]

Technically the game is fairly solid, you'll likely encounter an occasional glitch, but nothing game breaking.

The A.I. definitely needs some ... [snip]

Five is a lot of fun: there is a good amount of variety in your enemies, weapon and armor upgrades for your champions actually make a difference in combat. The sound track is catchy, and the storyline itself flows smoothly, filling in the gaps in the biblical historical records with believable and well thought out fiction. Loved the unusual, but effective use of the comicbook-style cutscenes. Similarly, the Philistine soldiers that you fight are well equiped in historically accurate manner. The cities and villages you fight in also give a very authentic 'feel' to each mission.  I only have one major complaint. After a while, the fighting gets a little repetative. The enemies do not level up with your men, so hoards of Amalekites or Philistines become more of an annoyance than an actual threat to your troops.  The later boss fights can be the same way; early on, you fight Goliath or others that are a genuine challenge, but the shock of battling a giant warrior is lessened when EVERY boss is 2.5 times larger than your warriors. But other than that, I truly loved this game, and highly recommend it! Score: 8/10.

[list]
[*][b]Story[/b] - Journey of King David’s mighty men and their many feats is action-packed and intriguing.

[*][b]Comic cut scenes[/b] - Worth the price of the game alone. I looked forward to these as they brought much life to the story.

[*][b]Voice overs[/b] - Will read all the text to you. Added character and personality to the cut scenes.

[*][b]Information Caches[/b] - Shed light on where the developers took creative license in writing the story but also give the Biblical references used for the story. 

[*][b]End of Act quizzes in Zion[/b] - These come available after Act 2 and provide some good loot if you get all the questions right.

[*][b]Boss fights[/b] - Varied and required some thought/strategy to overcome.

[*][b]Game world[/b] - I found it beautiful and fun to explore.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1] 
[list]
[*][b]Targeting[/b] - I often lost track of where the pointer was on screen as it blends in easily. This made controlling the attacking functions awkward as the pointer location is how/where you direct attacks and movement. This could be improved if a higher visibility pointer was added. Even better would be a targeting system like pressing “Tab” to select the nearest enemy. I ended up preferring to spam Area of Effect attacks and avoided many of the precision attack abilities because of the inaccuracy of trying to find and hover the mouse pointer over targets before it was too late.

[*][b]Pathing[/b] - I found myself often trying to get the characters around or unstuck in many areas. A workaround I learned that made this bearable was switching between characters until I found one that could get around the stuck area.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Gameplay[/b] ended up being rather easy and I really wasn’t challenged to come up with much of a strategy other than hit the auto equip offensive loot in inventory and spam AoE attacks. I managed to receive all Steam achievements just by completing the game.

[h1]Other thoughts:[/h1]
[list]
[*]If you pick this game up [b]I recommend pressing on through at least Act 3[/b] which is when you get to Zion your home base. Much more of the game opens up from here. Such as being able to give donations to unlock perks like added inventory slots for loot, ability to replay/farm previous missions, receive blessing’s that give stat boosts. 

[*]Also [b]I played this game with my Steam controller[/b] and I was pretty happy with the experience. I have uploaded my configuration “Favorite Five: Guardians of David config” and recommend using it if you have a Steam controller.

El juego está basado en los 5 principales militares del rey David, cuyas hazañas y relatos pueden encontrarse en los libros de Samuel y Crónicas en la biblia; pero (como el mismo juego recalca) debido a la poca información de estos interesantes personajes, se vieron en la forzosa necesidad de añadir e inventar situaciones para prolongar la historia del juego.

Me parece que lo lograron con éxito, las aventuras fluyen maravillosamente con intriga y emoción; las misiones, las batallas y las guerras siempre parecen tener sentido con el panorama general de la historia. Los personajes tienen personalidades muy marcadas e identificables desde el inicio, y puedes cambiar a quien jugar entre los cinco en cualquier momento mientras el cpu te ayuda jugando a los cuatro restantes; y me encantó que en ciertos niveles puedas jugar a otros individuos (como al mismo rey David).

Para jugarlo se utiliza el mouse y el teclado (por lo menos así lo juego), y en general siempre me molestaron estos juegos, ya que nunca van a donde quiero o siempre están llenos de bugs y cosas simililares.

El sistema de batalla es sencillo al principio, pero mientras más ataques y poderes se incorporan al subir de nivel, más complicado y estratégico se vuelven las peleas, sobre todo si se toma en cuenta que cada personaje tiene diferente armamento y especialidades.

I got this game because it looked like it had an interesting story and fun gameplay. After playing for almost nine hours I decided that this game is actually not much fun.

The game is divided into segments or zones separated by comic book-style cutscenes that advance the story of David and his five protectors. It is incredibly linear and does not allow for any exploring or side quests. Also, the actual areas in which your characters can walk are very constrained, often consisting of only a narrow path. These areas are strewn with objects which can often get in the way of the characters and cause annoying path-finding problems. (In one spot, getting past a tree to a cache was a matter of luck because of how narrow the path was and how the characters jammed on each other.)

The gameplay generally consists of talking to someone, walking toward a destination, being accosted by enemies at which point a frenzied battle ensues, followed by more of the same. The most frustrating aspect of the fighting mechanics is that each of the five characters has four possible special attacks/buffs. There is no way that I can memorize which character can do what with which number key and choose effectively while a frenzied, non-pausable battle is going on. Basically, I would just choose a character, spam all of his ability keys, then go on to the next character and repeat until all of the enemies were dead. This problem is compounded when you enter a section where you control only a subset of the characters and they are now assigned to different function keys.

Pros:
Nice visuals
Nice music
Good voice acting
Interesting story based on scripture
Interesting comic book cutscenes that advance the story

Cons:
Severe path-finding issues
Controlling characters in battle is so intricate that it's hard to do anything effectively
Overly repetitive gameplay

The game itself is like a surprise box, where you have no clue whoever you will get something good or something bad. In fact, the game itself has its good and bad sides which made me wonder if I should recommend it or not. Keep in mind, I will review the game as a Christian non-bible believer.

The story itself is focused on David and the region of Canaan for the whole period. The story itself focuses a lot on the bible while adding a couple of extra side quests as well. In between the hack and slash moment you have mini-voiced cut scenes which are usually hit or miss depending on the actor. The game also uses a unique system where there are a couple of comic pages either at the end of an area or at the beginning with voice acting. In fact, the game itself feels like playing a rougher diablo game. 

The music in the game is beautiful and worth listening and complements quite well with the area you are in. The graphics of the game are a bit rough, I personally thought they could have done better in that department considering the fact it is a relatively new game.

One of the unique systems in the game is the ability to have up to five companions while adventuring and being able to switch depending on the preferred style. Personally, I was not overjoyed in this department since the characters are pre-set (you will have areas where only a specific character will go, others where three specific ones and so on) as well as their weapons which cannot really be changed except for a better grade. I also did not like the pathing system which created some odd situations. For instance, in a boss fight my range character was stuck 20 paces away and was attacking a wall. In other instance, each time I was using the spearman to attack enemies, the first hit would miss even though the enemy was practically hugging you. The enemies faced were also very blend, with very little variety and most of the time being the same models over and over again.

In terms of customization I was a bit disappointed with the abilities. You can only level them maximum to level five and not a single one of those was a passive.

The game also has one of the nice features similar to Grim Dawn, aka the Market where you can exchange a certain currency for reputation and find better items

I personally did not experience any crashes during my play through, but I was a bit disappointed with some of the previous issues mentioned above

The game also comes with the comic which you see in every chapter which is a pretty sweet addition since it’s quite well made and fun to read.

Overall, I would say that the game is worth it if you can stomach the quirks and get past the biblical references. I give the game a 7/10.

システムとしてはキャラが5人居ると言う事以外は「ディアブロ系ゲーム」で全て説明が付くほどにそのまま。キャラが5人と言ってもレベルなどは共通で、キャラの切り替えも一瞬なので、5人のキャラクターを操作すると言うよりは、攻撃方法が五種類あると言った印象だった。その為、このゲームを他の同ジャンルゲームから差別化する要素はあまり無い。強いて言えば独特の場面設定だろうか。

このゲームはこの種のゲームには珍しく「現実の世界」を舞台としている。その為モンスターなどは出てこないし、敵は全て人間だけで、その攻撃方法も普通の武器を使った物だけになっている。しかし、それが原因でこのゲームは最初から最後までゲームプレイが全く変化せず、近接攻撃を仕掛けてくる人間の敵と、弓などで遠距離攻撃をしてくる人間の敵、要はこの二つを延々と相手にするだけになってしまっている。

更にプレイヤー側も一部の技が圧倒的に強く、最初から最後までその技を連打しているだけでクリアー出来るほど。戦闘バランスなども序盤と終盤とで変化が無く、ゲームプレイ中なんの工夫もなく同じプレイを繰り返す事になる。

また、この種のハクスラゲーの華であるランダムアイテムドロップに関しても、単に以前よりも強いアイテムがドロップし続けると言った程度で、キャラクタービルドを考えた装備変更などという要素は薄い。
その他に、五人のキャラクターそれぞれに装備を調えると言う要素があり、これが想像以上にかなり面倒臭い。例えばある防具を捨てるかどうか考える場合、一々五人のキャラクターの装備を確認して、その防具よりも弱い物を装備しているかどうかを確かめなければならない。しかも装備部位がかなり多いので、装備部位毎にそれを行う事を考えてみて欲しい。特に序盤のアイテム欄が狭い状態では頻繁にアイテム整理が必要なので、その度にこの様な作業を行う必要がありゲームのテンポを阻害する。

結局、敵の種類の貧弱さ、戦闘バランスの悪さ、ランダムアイテムの貧弱さと面倒、これらが組み合わさってゲームプレイ全体がひたすら退屈で単調な物になってしまっている。ゲームシステムとしてはディアブロ系そのままな分、同ジャンルの他のゲームと比べた時単調さが特に際立つ。
作りは丁寧だと感じるし、ボリュームも意外とあるが、やはり根本的な面白さの欠如は擁護できない。積極的に「クソゲーだ！手を出すな！」と言う程の事もないが、お勧めするようなゲームだとは思えない。",1474462175,1474462753,False,16,1,0.580766558647155762,0,False,False,False,False,,,

¥ Удобное управление и переключение между героями.
¥ Герои автоматически воскрешаются и приходят к месту сражения (а если умирает вся команда то все равно возрождаемся на ближайшем чекпойнте).

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
¥ Плохая отпимизация при относительно плохой графике.
¥ Скучные и однообразные квесты.
¥ Тупой ИИ наших героев.
¥ Не крутится карта (может не нашел как?).
¥ Непонятные достижения (что делать? Зачем? Сбросил нафиг).
¥ Одинаковые враги.
¥ Умений вроде бы много разных, а в основном они делают одна и то-же.

¥ Локации чересчур коридорные. Даже маленького шага ступить нельзя мимо тропинки.
¥ Малое разнообразие предметов экипировки, как и бонусов к ним.

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Diablo клон, на тематику христианской религии. Остальные ведь забрал Titan Quest... :) Игра не получилась. И очень быстро наскучивает своим однообразием. Тем более она выпущена сейчас, когда конкурентов в жанре десятки и они более чем достойны. Не рекомендую.

So yeah I'm sure there are others out there, but this one does a good job and I'm glad I found it. 
Is it a religious story? Yeah, but if you already play games with ancient magical greek gods and creatures, you could treat this the same and probably get away without being converted. It's the story of the Jewish King David, told from the viewpoint of his five 'mighty' men who were like the 'agents of SHIELD' of the Bible I guess? David got a whole lot written about him, but these guys just get a few mentions for some pretty badass things they did. Like David killed goliath, here's a whole chapter, oh and by the way, here's line about how this other dude killed 2 giants by himself. So yeah I'm sure they're glad 4000 years later that they're finally getting the recognition they deserve.
People will compare it to Diablo, but putting into perspective the size of the team and the budget, this was pretty well done. I know for a lot of people the religious aspect will either penalize or inflate their opinion of the game but putting that aside and judging it as a game it is still a decent little action RPG.

It is not without its glitches... however, these are overcome with a bit a practise.

This made it more difficult at the start of playing. But as I said, you get used to this, and just release the SHIFT key when attacking a different enemy.

I saw other reviews that indicated that this game isn't very religious. I beg to differ in that regard. As you go through the game, you uncover rocks that provide information about the story.

Now when i own it, would i recommend the game? [b]Yes.[/b] Would i ask for a refund if i had bought it for a full price? [b]Yes.[/b]

I'll start from the good things:
[list]
[*]The story is done great and I enjoyed it. It's great, that it is based on a well known book, but it's even better how the story is put for the player (cashed references, comics, boss fights against antagonists). You can even take test on how well you know/learned the story and be rewarded for it.
[*]There are no good or bad characters. Each of them is unique and you can freely change from one character to another during your play (although somethimes the options are limited to less than 5). 
[*]Almost in every chapter you will use different characters (and not only from the FIVE). This uniqueness forces you to switch between characters and try different aproaches to combats. It also helps to keep the adventure entertaining;
[*]The quests are done well and involve not only killing, but also burning, sneaking, freeing, helping and other forms of participating in the story;
[*]The graphics and animations are definitely well done.
[/list]

But all in all, if you've tried other ARPG titles, you will most probably get disappointed with the game, as was i, and this is why:
[list]
[*]First of all, the game lacks the actual action. You will definitely find some, but it won't be as fast paced, changing or surprising.
[*]Secondly, the role playing part lacks character customisation (non-existant actually) and skill customisation. In short, you have 5 main characters, that are unique weapon and skillwise. They each have 6 slots for skills (4 keys and 2 mouse buttons), each of those can be equiped with one out of three possible skills, that are unlocked while leveling. Looks like many options, but even the 9th screenshot above shows lvl33 archer using the first unlocked skill set.
[*]Finally, the equipment part lacks everything you'd expect from a RPG. No crafting, no set items, no unique attributes and actually, you can do great only with a decent weapon. And you will have to equip 5 characters (where the lack of equipment options may actually help).

Five: The Guardians of David is an Action RPG set in the Old Testament of the Bible. The aforementioned Five are David's Most loyal warriors who are tasked by David to go around killing all opposition Old Testament style. I never paid a lot of attention in religious classes but it seems like a very close re-telling of the story of David, even Goliath makes an appearance.

Very early in the game you gain access to all 5 characters and their varying play styles. Most of the time all five are on the battlefield at the same time each with varying and deep skill sets and detailed skill trees. There is an archer, a two-handed weapon guy, a spear guy, a sword and board tanky guy and a slinger. I mainly used the spear guy but the computer is very capable of controlling the other four alongside you though they will never do as much damage as the one you control. With all five in the field that game is quite easy, I didn't die once on medium unless it was a boss fight where you are routinely reduced to one character and those still aren't particularly challenging once you notice the mechanics.

The story is told in engine and in a series of very good comic scenes all voice acted. In fact for what is a modest game in the nicest sense, the art and amount of gear is very generous. The game runs very well and the only bug I ran into was on the last boss fight where all the characters got knocked out of the arena and I had to reload. It's clear a lot of effort went into this.

Probably the only weakness is the questing. Almost every quest can be summed up as kill x number of people or destroy x number of things then kill the boss. A little more variety would have been nice.

Five is a very decent and unique addition to the ARPG genre. For it's price you'll get a game that compares very favourably to other efforts at this level.",1466517842,1542548551,True,11,0,0.622009158134460449,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Inspired by real-world events from Biblical times (the real reason I bought this, to be honest), you will take some of David's ""Mighty Men"" and fight against the enemies of Israel. 

PROS:
Best Biblical video game EVER.
Fun combat (I vault kicked a Philistine off a city wall).
You control Eleazer one of greatest warriors in the Bible.
Good actvatable abilities.
Each character still feels unque.
Even without difficulty settings, the game feels properly challenging.

CONS:
No real tutorial.
I personally had a hard time clicking enemies (I can only run the game at roughly 25 FPS though)

NITPICKS:
Why did I fight Goliath with a bowstaff?
Enemies largely focus on the player-controlled character, making the ranged characters harder to use. But I only use the melee bruisers anyway.

PERSONAL THOUGHTS:
I am very pleased with what they did with the combat. Regardless of the weapon similarities, each character is unique and has a certain role. Beneniah is great for big single targets, Jashobeam will wreck hordes of lower level enemies, and Eleazer is quite tanky and has an AoE stun. The Goliath fight is peculiar given the source material, but watching a giant do a spear charge into a crowd and seeing the spectators fly through the air makes up for it. The control schene is certailny odd, but it is easily understood. If I had one thing I would change about the game, it is a shop tutorial. Yes, right-clicking shouldn't be hard to figure out, but I didn't right off so I lost a chance for more loot (a cardinal sin in gaming).

Good:
Even though I am 100% atheist and don't care for the bible or any gods, this game has managed to make it interesting to learn about the bible.
- The ancient history behind the game story makes the game feel more realistic compared to most other games. You don't hack down 3 lions at a time, 1 lion alone is a big challenge. You don't slash random bears every now and then, you save your familys and neighbors sheep from small packs of wolves.
- You don't curse the enemy with spells, summon familiars or heal yourself. You fight  with historical weapons and techniques.

Bad:
The game focuses on historical events, but it fails a bit much on following it through. I am tempted to make jokes about divine interventions.
- When you load a saved game you will have to do the whole level over again, and everything you did during that level will be rolled back >.<
- When fighting a boss, you first have no idea how you are supposed to defeat it. Then you die. Then you respawn at full health, while the boss has not healed anything, and you just smack it down. This feels like some awful way of cheating the game, it's not fun.
- Everybody knows David killed Goliath with a slinger, and the game says so too. However, YOU will play David killing Goliath with a melee weapon. Why??
- The game skips everything that happened from David kileld Goliath until he became an experienced commander. I want to know(play) what happened during that time!
- Anybody in your party died? No worries, they'll magically respawn when the fight is over.

I experience some FPS issues, for sure. Saving isn't the best, but it's straightforward that you need to save at the start of levels (i.e. finish the one you're on before you quit playing). The inventory and outfit customizations are deep and well designed. The art (scenery, wardrobes, weapons, enemies, etc.) are all *very* enjoyable to me and most of all, I am very happy to finally have a decent game to play that is mainly focused on Bible themes. The fact that many of the bosses are GIANTS is totally awesome IMO as well ! I think most of the people who have reviewed this poorly have not played through it very much or already have a favorite game in this style that they hold this up to (perhaps even one based on the lord of terror rather than The Lord ? :o lol). Once you get to Act 3 the locations that open up offer more chances to divest your inventory, save, etc. 

I was mainly excited to play this because of the subject matter and historical period and I am not disappointed. From smashing Fish-man idols to wearing antlers and capes; there is a primal feel to the whole game that permeates the first few chapters like nothing I've ever played before. It's like, if you ever played AOE or something and just wanted to be the nomad for a while - but I digress. Seeing renditions of Jerusalem (then running around it) when it was only a 15 acre walled settlement was really interesting to me too.

I would say it could use some polish in a few areas and I will be happy to make a post in the forums once I do some more evaluation. Still, I decided to buy this at full price because I really wanted to support the developers vision and, again, I am not disappointed. 

If they do another patch at some point and just tidy it a bit, without changing anything that they really have here already - this would be an easy 8 or 8.5 for me. Maybe more. I certainly look forward to the next title from this dev. Keep att'er and good work !! 

7.5/10 (+1)

If you can get it on sale, or are really looking for a game with this theme already then I would still give it an 8+. The only thing that very modern gamers might pooo-pooo is that the cut-scenes are all 'comic book style' but they are well done and there is adequade voice acting throughout. Some of it is really good but other parts are more satisfactory to the role. All in all, I don't see why anyone wouldn't like this title - especially if the FPS can be improved someday via another optimization patch or a guide. (maybe i should poke around and see if there's more on it in the forums, etc still too :P ) 

Recommend ? Yep. 

Heads up - known FPS issues, needs a bit of polishing but generally a good game on it's own merits. I would say these devs are worth keeping an eye on if this is an early product.

Between being given a copy (and then disliking the game) and the propensity of certain religous supporters to want to very vocally support this game, I'm quite sure this review will get many downvotes. I applaud the devs for trying to do something different and historical (I'm a history buff). It's nice to see someone try to do something different. Frankly, I think the idea is brilliant. The execution....not so much.

As a game, it's a failure on most every level. The gameplay is straight out of Diablo/Titan Quest/Grim Dawn with the one exception being that you can control multiple party members. As a game, Five has to be measured against that strong competition and it really fails to measure up. I've played it for an hour and have no desire to return to it (more on that in a moment). 

The graphics/animations aren't good. Titan Quest is a decade old and looks better. The color pallet is muted and it's often tough to distinguish details on the screen. The animations are stiff and stilted. Enemies look just like your guys and it can be tough to figure out who is friend from foe unless you concentrate on the health bars above people's heads. The music/sound is ok though the voice acting is quite poor. Frankly, I wish they hadn't voice acted the game as just text would have been an improvement. 

The cartoon interludes telling the story are pretty cool, if a little heavy-handed on the whole ""ordained by God"" thing and actually not accurate, That's actually pretty insulting. An example of this is when they're telling the story of David v. Goliath. In thie game David claims that he didn't need armor because he was protected by God. Nice try, but no. That's not how the story goes. He declined armor because he was not accustomed to wearing it! That's fairly unforgivable given how sacred some faiths hold the source material.

Back to the game, your characters level but you have no influence over their leveling - you don't get to raise their stats or pick any new skills. You get what you get and that makes character advancement a dull affair. 

The one gimmick in the gameplay  is that you can control multiple party members. However, it's more limited in reality since you can control only one at a time (and the others are woefully ineffective when you're not controlling them) this novelty quickly wears off. Other than that the gameplay is straight out of any Diablo-style game. Each one of the 5 characters you can control have different abilities but you're better off using the one guy who can stun everyone (I forget who that is). You'll find other characters not as useful. The abilites aren't anything to write home about and there's nothing that makes you go ""wow"". Kicking an opponent or lighting an arrow on fire isn't anything new in the genre.

Itemization isn't anything to write home about either. I know I was only an hour into the game but of the 5 characters, only one had any kind of decent weapon upgrade. Without being able to control your character advancement, itemization becomes far more important. I didn't see any real great shakes here and thus this is another missed opportunity. It did not feel rewarding to play through the game and not get any real upgrades to your characters. Now maybe later on new cool weapons fall like Frankincense and Myrrh from the sky but it didn't happen early enough in the game to compel me to keep playing.

As mentioned, the enemies are based on the Torah and therefore are pretty run of the mill. Just like the abilities, there's nothing here to make you go WOW! There are some wild variations on difficulty though and while you'll chew through most enemies easily some seem abnormally difficult even though they're still white (fodder) enemies.They're basically enemy soldiers. 

So far what I've described is a fairly dull Diablo clone. Unfortunately, FIVE gets worse,

Ok, then finally we get to the bugs and the reason I'm no longer playing the game. I've hit four in the first hour. 

1. Gold from a chest dropped into an area of the screen my character couldn't access. Very minor.
2. An enemy was shooting at me from an area on the map that I couldn't get to. That's pretty annoying. 
3. I managed to roll myself into the crowd and couldn't move in the boss battle against Goliath. He couldn't get to me and I couldn't get back out. So the only option was to restart the entire battle which required me to play through the ENITRE map again. Exceptionally annoying.
4. The last was the boss battle at Shebitku. There's a spike trap that comes up to prevent your other characters from coming into a one-on-one fight. Except when I died (because the difficulty on this battle is so absurd that I died in two hits) the spikes didn't come back down. Thus I could not re-engage the boss. So I saved. And reloaded the save....and was again placed all the way back at the start of the level. That's enough. Done. Not coming back.


So as a game what you have is a poor Titan Quest clone with bad animations, no character development, poor itemization, boring enemies, muddled textures and that's VERY buggy. Beyond the novel concept and the nice developers there's nothing redeeming here. That's unfortunate because I'd love to see more historical games made outside the wargame genre.

The story of David is at the center of attention right from the start, most of it depicted through comic-book style cut-scenes between the missions and the rest through scarce dialogue encounters in the game. 

Most of the time when you actually bother to pay attention to what the game has to say you get the impression that you are listening to some kind of a weird Biblical teaching device. Characters are paradoxically soulless, and despite being some of the most important Biblical figures, they have no personality whatsoever. Representation of that storyline onto the battlefield is even worse. Missions you venture through will give you absolutely no sense of accomplishment as you literary won’t die. Even if you do, you will simply take control of some other character from your party of five. Atop of that almost every single mission objective in the game is a boring fetch quest where you must either destroy, collect, grab or pull something, killing hundreds along the way.

The player controls a party up to a 5 class-based characters: ranged weapon users, spear wielders, sword and shield fighters. There is plenty of space for quite a number of collectible gear and weapons on the shoulders of five men you control, which unfortunately makes no difference due to the fact that such a casual combat doesn’t require you to even bother with comparing or even collecting new gear. You slice through hordes of enemies like knife through butter any give weapon.

There is no deapth or high quality here, not by any means a Diablo–style action RPG clone. FIVE: Guardians of David is simply a below average game for a below average player. On the other side FIVE being a “Bible Game,” doesn’t bring much of anything to the table other than slaying people by thousands, while promoting some kind of twisted morality through the comic-book cutscenes. Levels are entirely linear and narrow corridors, with some kind of and open space usually associated to a boss battle (which you can’t lose, as you respawn over and over again). Leveling-up is done collectively by group and new abilities are auto-assigned by the game, though these can be modified.

I really cannot reccommend FIVE to anyone. Fans of action RPGs have literally dozens of better games to choose from. Price of 22,99$ is ridiculous for the content you get. Aside from the novelty of the Biblical theme and story, FIVE‘s gameplay ignores a lot of what has been a standard in the genre for quite some time. Such important gameplay aspects as strategic groups, tactics and propper character development are nowhere to be found here. With its bleek heroes and dumb enemies FIVE: Guardians of David is something not worth your time or money.

King David was described in the Bible numerous times (1 Sam 13:14, Acts 13:22) as a man after God’s own heart.  He was also a warrior and shed a lot of blood (1 Chronicles 28:3) and because of that, the job of building a temple for God was passed onto his son, Solomon.  David wasn’t the only one on the battlefield though - he had many mighty warriors and they are all described in 2 Samuel 23:8-39. FIVE: Guardians of David focuses on Jashobeam, Eleazar, Shammah, Abishai, and Benaiah.

Each of these warriors has a specialized weapon and together they were an unstoppable force that have wiped out many of Israel’s enemies including the Amalekites, Arameans, Edomites, Jebusites, Moabites, and the Philistines.    In the beginning of the game, these mighty men were mere shepherd boys fighting off wolves along with the occasional lion.  
FIVE: Guardians of David is an action RPG very similar to the play style of Diablo.  The swarms of enemy soldiers can be attacked by clicking on them repeatedly or by holding down the mouse pointer on them until their hit points are depleted.  As long as another mighty warrior is still standing, you can take control of them at any time.  If one of the warriors falls in battle, the others can pick up their slack if needed.  If all of the warriors fall, the game will resume at the nearest check point and the enemy’s health points will be where you left them.  Some gamers may find that too easy for their tastes, especially during boss battles. There are many boss battles and of course, the epic battle between David and Goliath takes place early on in the game.

A majority of the game takes place as David is fleeing from Saul and beginning to establish his kingdom.  Besides dealing with outside opposition, the people of Jerusalem did not want him to establish his kingdom there.   Their king had to take it by force, and he did.

While most of the game is based on and sources its Biblical references, there are some added characters and story elements to keep things interesting.     In total there are eleven acts and forty-two levels in the single-player campaign.  After completing each act and their boss, a Steam achievement is earned.  I’m not sure why, but there is no achievement or mention of Act 3.  Does that mean there are only ten acts?  In either case, this is one of three Steam games I have gotten a 100% completion on.  

There’s a decent amount of variety in the game’s missions.  Besides beating the snot out of people, you will also have many opportunities to set fires to their camps or scout them out stealth style while not being detected.  Animal lovers may take offense to the mission objectives that require hobbling messenger horses (binding their legs with rope) or setting loose pigs with ignited jars of oil on them to set enemy tents ablaze in the chaos.  Each mission has several objectives that need to be completed and optional caches that can be found to relay some story background and accompanying Biblical verses.  Finding all of the caches is great for OCD gamers and their knowledge will prove to be useful when it comes to taking quizzes in exchange for some good loot.  I like the way that this game offers but doesn’t force Biblical references on the gamers and they can to choose to read it if they want to.

In all honesty, FIVE: Guardians of David is one of the better Bible themed games I have played in a long time.  The gameplay is fun and just when it starts to get a little bit dull, something new is thrown into the mix like stealth missions or enemies with new abilities.  The alchemists were very annoying with their fire attacks and explosions upon their death.  

There’s a fair amount of humor as well with the conversations amongst the five mighty warriors turning into bickering and they pick on and prank each other a bit throughout the game.  The voice acting is well done and the background music is a good fit, though it could use a little more variety in my opinion.  

Graphically, FIVE: Guardians of David is pretty good and there’s a decent amount of variety in the maps.  Some of the missions take place in towns while others are in the desert or inside of caves.  The enemy animations are nicely done as well though I did run into a funny glitch.  During a battle instead of the enemies attacking me, they were clapping instead.  It was both hilarious and taunting as if to say the attacks weren’t powerful enough.  Once that swarm of enemies was defeated, the normal attack animations resumed.

Sadly, I wish that was the only glitch I had to report.  The check points in this game is arguably useful.  While they do record your inventory and number of caches discovered, if you have to leave your game mid-level for any reason, upon re-launching it you’ll have to start at the beginning of the level again.  The only time the check points work properly is if you get defeated by a boss, and sadly even then they don’t trigger properly.  I got my butt kicked in two different boss fights and my party was not registering in the game as dead and when I had to reload the autosave, I had to start the level from the beginning and re-do all of the objectives before I could fight the boss again.  

Despite having to redo my progress a couple of times, my experience playing FIVE: Guardians of David has been mostly positive.  The single-player campaign took me roughly seventeen hours to complete.  There is some re-playability if anyone missed locating all of the caches during their first play-through.  This game lends itself well to multiplayer-coop but it’s not available at this time.  The developers haven’t excluded the possibility.  While the normal price is $24.99, I have seen it for less than $10 on sale and it’s worth picking up if you’re looking for a good Bible themed game.  I look forward to future releases from Kingdom Games.",1456943513,1456943513,True,26,1,0.654603540897369385,3,False,True,False,False,,,

Having read the Bible for years, seeing these characters come to life like this has been simply amazing. Never thought I would see a game like this that was this good.

Pros- The art design is great, audio and music excellent. 
Combat can be as fun or as boring as you make it. Plenty of skills and tactics to make things interesting. For me it was fun, slamming enemies into the ground-kicking them across the screen, though it would be simple enough to just click through the levels boringly.
Tons of loot, varying styles of armor and weapons keep things interesting and item stats help to shape character builds.
The Old Testament setting is my favorite aspect of the game to be honest.

Cons- Biggest would be bugs. Haven't hit to many, but they are there. But then again I have seen some pretty massive AAA games with more bugs (Here is looking at you Fallout 4).
I would like more interesting things to buy with my Shekels, I am fairly far in and haven't seen anything worth buying. Just been donating to the beggars...
Combat skills are hit and miss. There are some really cool ones, but I think they needed more balancing. One skill in a tier can be far more powerful that another skill for no apparent reason whatsoever. Plenty of good ones to choose from though.

Summary- If you like ARPGs and want a unique setting, its an easy sell. Also if you have any interest in the Bible and Old Testament times, I highly recommend.
If you are wanting the next big thing this may not be it. Also, while the game is definitely not preachy it is about the Bible. So if you have no interest in that it may not be for you.
So basically, as an ARPG game it has a good many merits and some flaws. As a game set in Biblical times it is the absolute best I have ever seen.

I like isomteric RPGs and the story was really promising, so I gave it a try.

-the level of complexity is good, not too simple but not too complicated so you do not need hundreds of hours to learn it, you can enjoy it quite soon but still not too simple.
-strory is good and 'unique' , not schematic at all.
-Bible references are designed very well: if you are interested on them you can read them by one click but you can skip them if you are not. It gives some additional deepness to the game and the story. I recommend to read them, they are not soo long.
-graphics is nice
-family-friendly. Not like in case of a lot of other RPGs nowadays, you do not have to be necrophil to enjoy this game, there are no too detailed rotten bodies, narrow crypts, etc.

Minus:
-SPOILER: [spoiler] Why do not I have a sling to defeate Goliath?! I was searching it for 5 minutes, meantime of course it killed me! [/spoiler]
-very buggy or just bad game desing regarding the save/load system: it saves only the map where you are and only those loots what you gathered on the previous maps although the game let you save anywhere. So if you save at the end of a map you lose the progress on it including items. So always save at the begining on the maps.
-the checkpoint system totaly spoils the challenge: at the first try a boss killed me but I knew that I will be able to kill it for a second try. But this stupid chechpoint system resigned me and I was able to kill the boss by one blow since its hp remained almost zero not like mine. It was not satisfactory at all to kill it on this way, I felt that I am a cheater...
-although the graphics is nice but there is a design issue like at many other games nowadays: It is too 'shiny' so it hurts the eye, difficult to recognize what are on the ground since it radiates. I do not know what is the name of this effect something bloom or whatever but you can not switch it off in the game, maybe from driver.

Overall I would recommend it for now due to the story and environment and the fact that it is finally not just a copy of other RPGs but something interesting and new, but I will play the game more and later mybe I'll update this review.

UPDATE:
After more test it turned out that the save issue is even worse than I described above: sometimes you lose even the progress on the previous map. So I change this review to not recommended until fixing of this bug is confirmed. :-(",1451763406,1451941864,False,20,0,0.624267637729644775,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The control is enough simple and good, if you played before same style games its should be similar to you. The graphic looks good, sounds and music also good, all this do a game even more enjoyable.
 
So my verdict

+good music and sounds
+nice comic cut scenes
+enough interesting story
+steam achievements and cards
+interesting boss battles (for example Goliath)
 
-some bugs
-a bit high price
 
This game I think really enjoyable. The gameplay is enough good, music, sounds and graphic is well confirmed. So if you like a Diablo style games and don’t fear from a Bible based story I recommend this game for you, especially you can got this with good discount at winter sale.

Gameplay wise it plays very much like Diablo/PoE. FIVE changes this up a bit however by providing you with a choice of characters that stay grouped with you, allowing the player to switch between them at will. This lets you change your playstyle up to suit the situation, whether it be ranged or close quarter combat.

Lastly, chapters are punctuated with some fantastic artwork in a comic book style that moves the story along at a great pace.

Highlight so far: 
-The battle between David and Goliath.
-Art Work
-Plays Smoothly, very few dramas with bugs so far.

Negatives: 
-Lack of mob variety early on, wolves, wolves and more wolves.
-Pacing of abilities gained
-The voice acting is a mixed bag, some is great it but can be quite jarring to hear a thick accent in conversation with an american one.

Between the clunky combat and drag-ass level design, you really get the feeling that FIVE is just being stretched out as thin as it can to somehow pass itself off as a game. 

It's a rush job. That much is clear. But it also suffers from some poor concepts, too. All five of the, well, FIVE are on screen at the same time. As well as David himself, and you swap between them X-Men Legends style. But X-Men Legends was designed to have four characters on screen simutaneously. Diablo, which FIVE is heavily based on, was not. It becomes chaotic and confusing, but the good news is that you were just going to mash the same button anyway.

I say ""based"" as its clear when they invent a character or place. It doesn't preach, and doesn't require you to know the bible to enjoy this. 

     But Bible aside this game doesn't suffer for its Bible trappings. I'm a sucker for games that use any source material well and moreso when they enrich your own knowlage or lack thereof the materal in the game. Crusader Kings II has their wikipedia links when they use actual people and Five Guardians of David does as well by having Caches hidden throught the level to collect and with it comes a bit of directors commentary as to where you are sits in the bible or where they chose to embellish, even has the passage they took it from.  

     So now that I have said that the Bible setting of the game doesn't interfere with the game by being ""preachy"" I have slain that 500 pound gorrila and can move on to the game itself.  

    Its an action rpg with the standards of a action bar that fills as you level up and a equipment that you earn to increase your stats with. Being paired up with other controlable npcs allows for you to have choices in how you want to fight such as be melee or ranged.  It also helps the story along as your charcter doesnt talk alound to himself for exposition. This is the Bible so yes there is plenty of bossfights and they come with decent set pieces and a solid challenge. David can get stumped by Goliath. 

Productionwise the game's artists and programmers must be commended for making a setting aproprate to the era. Good sound design and suprising voice work helps move a simple story.  The music sets the mood and the games cinematics do a good job of setting the plot and location well. 

My only complaints so far is the ""comic book cutscenes"" could be handled better and be a better resolution. And AI partners love to ignore a beating you are taking if its more than 5 feet away,  There is a few crashes when I mess with the shadow settings as well.

The game seemed a bit rough around the edges starting out, but after getting to Act 3 where you have access to the ""World Map"" and access to the Market where you can go and donate items and other things, the game has grown on me and I think I may be addicted somewhat.

Do not pay attention to other reviewers stating that enemies do not drop loot, because they most certrainly do, and lots of it. The problem is the game starts you out facing enemies that do not drop loot. It seems in Five the enemies that drop loot most of the time are what you might call ""Elites"". These are enemies that have at least 1 Star under their health bar. Some enemies will have more than one star indicating they are higher rank and they will drop more and better loot. 

Honestly Five has more in common with Marvel Heroes Online than any thing else I can think of. Five is more about skills much like MHO. Also some have complained that they don't get to put points into their individual stats on level up, which is true, but Five is more about farming loot that has the stat bonuses you want and fine tuning your character that way, which honestly has more impact than dropping 5 points into various stats each level up.

I highly encourage others to play through to Act 3 and possibly a little further before posting your review. Once you have access to Zion things get much more interesting, plus you can use the map to go back and play previous chapters and even farm bosses. 

In fact  I just finished replaying the chapter where you fight Goliath and got myself a brand spankin' new Goliath Spear that has different stats than the first one I got, plus the stats are better as in Five when loot drops it drops around your level, enemies also seem to get buffed when you go back through area's as well, which keeps things a little more challenging.

I have really enjoyed the comic book cut scenes and voice overs as well. Very good and informative stuff.

All the Biblical and Historical information the game gives you along the way comes in handy when you get access to Zion as there is a Quiz Podeum thing where it tests your knowledge through the different chapters of the game and then you are granted loot based on how well you did. It is not a new thing, but it is nice to see it in the game.

Also if there are features you want to see added be sure to post  in the forums as Chris will usually respond and pass suggestions on to the Dev Team.

All in all, after several hours of play I would give Five a solid 7.5/10. It's a good ARPG for the money and is better than some of the other Diablo clones on Steam. There are still some improvements and features that could be added and I hope the Dev's will listen to fans and add those features in the future.",1448517105,1448517105,True,159,2,0.844854831695556641,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Bei FIVE beginnt alles damit das David den Riesen Goliath erschlägt und fortan von allen gefeiert wird. David spielt man nur im Bosskampf selber. Nach und nach gesellen sich Fünf Krieger hinzu, welche alle unterschiedliche Waffen benutzen können. (z.B. Speere oder Bögen).

Hier merkt man auch direkt das erste Problem: Sobald man alle fünf Charaktere gefunden hat laufen alle gemeinsam in einer Gruppe. Kommt es zu einem Kampf gegen zahlreiche Gegner so stehen meist mindestens 2 der Charaktere nur sinnlos in der Gegend rum und helfen in keinster weise. Sehr ärgerlich wenn man gegen eine ganze Armee kämpfen muss und die Hälfte der Teamkameraden tut nichts. Bei sehr großen Arealen scheinen die KI Kollegen aber zu reagieren. Scheint wohl ein Wegfindungsproblem zu sein? Bei den Gegner ist dies übrigens genauso. Viele lassen sich ohne große Gegenwehr einfach niederknüppeln.

Anfangs dachte ich bei dem Spiel das man neue Items nur über Kisten oder Urnen bekommt. Das stimmt aber nicht. Getötete Gegner lassen sehr selten auch mal etwas fallen und die zahlreichen Bosse und Zwischenbosse im Spiel lassen daher umso mehr fallen. Somit stimmt die Aussage von einer anderen Rezension nicht ganz richtig.

Ich bin zur Zeit am Ende vom 2. Akt und habe um die 2 Stunden gespielt. Da das Spiel 11 Akte hat kann man von einer Spielzeit von 12-14 Stunden ausgehen. (Akt 2 ist deutlich länger als Akt 1) Bisher gab es keine feste Stadt wo man Waren verkaufen kann. In den linearen Levels sind immer mal wieder Händler verteilt. Da das Inventar ziemlich schnell voll wird wenn man jeden Krempel mitschleppt muss man sehr schnell Gegenstände aus dem Inventar schmeißen. Das hätte man besser lösen können. Aber wie gesagt vielleicht kommt ja noch eine feste Stadt. 

Jeder Charakter lernt übrigens bei einem Stufenaufstieg automatisch eine neue Fähigkeit. Diese kann man auf 4 Schnelltasten legen. Außerdem gibt es jeweils eine andere Fähigkeit für die linke und rechte Maustaste. Somit kann jeder Charakter 6 Fähigkeiten bzw Angriffe benutzen. Die einzelnen Fähigkeiten lassen sich durch Fertigkeitenpunkte verstärken. 

Jetzt habe ich soviel geschrieben und bin noch nicht mal auf die Story eingegangen. Was soll ich dazu sagen. Ich kenn mich mit der Bibel nicht aus xD von daher interessiert mich die Story jetzt auch nicht so wirklich. Das ist bei ARPG´s aber auch eher Nebensache. Das sammeln von Loot funktioniert auch in FIVE jedoch sollte man keine übertriebenen Rüstungen wie in Diablo erwarten. Auch beim Gegnerdesign sollte man keine riesigen Bossgegner oder Monster erwarten. Die meiste Zeit kämpft man gegen feindliche Soldaten (so ist es zumindest jetzt).

Möchte noch erwähnen dass das Spiel nur auf Englisch ist aber dafür ganz gute Sprecher bereit hält. Die Story wird übrigens in kleinen Comicseiten vorran getrieben, ganz nett.

Ich hoffe ich konnte ein bisschen Einblick in das Spiel gewähren. Mir macht es Spaß von daher würde ich persönlich jedem Fan von solchen Spielen das Spiel ans Herz legen. Versucht es wenigstens.

I’m a little torn here. On one hand we have the interesting idea of pairing Biblical stories to a video game, an action RPG at that, yet does the medium of the story add anything to the experience? FIVE: Guardians of David feels like it’s a little lost at what it wants to be, we have a linear, mostly-unaltered story, and on the over side we have a Diablo-esque ARPG with loot, tonnes of skills with a group play twist.

The story itself is well told through the use of voice acting, comic book style cutscenes and cache’s, which are a little like developer notes with reference to the bible passages. If you ever did Bible studies in school you’ll be able to know where these stories are and what the references in the game are. Without that knowledge though it may feel very disjointed, and while the game does a good job at filling in all the blanks, the story isn’t in-depth enough where you’ll be able to gain a full experience. Overall I think the story serves its purpose, but it really does depend if you’re interested in the laid out story.

Now as we move onto gameplay this is where a lot of questions start to arise. As a massive ARPG junkie there are a couple of things that need to be on point in order for a satisfying experience; responsiveness, impact and loot, which ‘FIVE’ fails to truly reach. The game is clunky at the best of times, actions feel unresponsive and even simple things such as targeting enemies can become a drag, it’s also bogged down by the less than stellar AI for enemies and your allies. The impact of your actions seem so watered down to keep it historically accurate, ground pounds and leaping kicks should feel amazing and enjoyable to do, yet a lot of the time they look like they could be caked into a normal auto attack. Loot is a big problem, the game doesn’t allow you to backtrack, which is something major in ARPG titles(aka the grind), to alleviate this the game hands you loot on major ‘boss’ kills and the ending of a mission. The removal of a RNG based loot system means your upgrades are set in stone and you don’t get that awesome feeling of gaining new loot, the stats themselves are uninteresting and don’t allow for much customisation.

I feel the game tries to bite off more than it can chew which leaves it feeling unpolished and lacklustre. While I did enjoy my time with the game I couldn’t see myself going much further, sure the story is there, but when your game promises ‘action’ it really needs to deliver, especially with so many over alternatives on offer. I’d love to see a pseudo-sequel of this game, allowing the developers to improve on what they’ve already built, which in my opinion would make this a great game to pick up. It’s good to see some innovation by mixing the two ideas, but maybe they need to refine what the games goals are. What does the loot bring? Does every character need 18 skills for a 6 slot hotbar?  Is controlling 5 characters too many?",1448437975,1448540729,False,49,5,0.633225500583648682,5,False,False,False,False,,,

There is loot that has stat bonuses and such. You make no choice in how a character grows other than loot.

There seems to be no loot that drops from mobs. You do seem to get drops from smashing objects in the game.

Finally the game lets you save anytime. Which is very odd because when I tried to load a save I made it put me at the beginning of the level.

Also the game freezes for around thirty seconds anytime you start it before you see the intro videos.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this game as it is to anyone. Going to get a refund as I don't feel it's worth the 22.49 with the 10 perecent discount.",1448389641,1448389641,False,111,7,0.593460798263549805,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I have a 20 minute preview video here if you want a more in-depth look.

This game reminds me a lot of Neverwinter Nights and Dungeon Siege. I had a great time playing it, it was pretty fun. The combat got a little boring after a while. Your main attack is the left click which is also how you navigate. Your right mouse button is the power attack and then special moves are assigned to 1-4.

I wish this game had a stat leveling system though, so you could put stats into certain attributes instead of the game just doing it naturally. I really did have a great time with this game though and do recommend it to those people who loved NN and DS.

If you are looking for a more action orientated RPG I do not recommend this game.",1448386612,1448386612,True,45,4,0.422934740781784058,0,False,False,False,False,,,
