[b]Magi Trials[/b] is a visual novel about an apprentice that must train for her next “Trial of Initiation” as a unexpected member of the opposite sex!

[b]Note: this article is a FRACTION of the full review. To read the whole article (including commentary and ratings), be sure pay my site a visit.[/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As a visual novel, one should expect to read — [i]alot.[/i]

Shaun (later known as “Sophie”) must make a handful of decisions throughout the game; with eight different endings to see, those choices play a hand in the events which unfold.

[h1]Sexual Content[/h1]
I adore the artwork, and I especially love all of the care put into facial expressions. However, I couldn’t help but feel [i]teased[/i] whenever someone got naked and nobody got [ducked].

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Even though visual novels aren’t my thing, I had fun reading [i]Magi Trials![/i] It’s fun for a playthrough or two, but replaying the game isn’t very fun. I’d lose my patience if I pursued new endings without [i]literally skipping[/i] most of the text. With only a few hours of reading and too many time skips, it’s not a game to get invested into either. But as long as you’re (A) not interested in adult content and (B) looking for a quick read, [i]Magi Trials[/i] is an alright entry into the world of genderbending.

I took the time to read their other title in hopes that there was at least some improvement, and you know what? I actually enjoyed my time reading “Magi Trials” as compared to “Highschool Romance”, maybe because of the better setting, better characters, or a plot that actually has progression. Now since they’ve dropped the “Highschool Romance” prefix altogether at the time of this review, I can stop comparing it to their previous works and break it down to what this VN really is: a work with a story and characters that has the potential to be really great and amazing, but instead plays safe and ends up becoming something quite lackluster and superficial.

Overall, I wouldn’t call “Magi Trials” the greatest English VN of all time nor the worst of all time. I would not even call it mediocre, as there is clearly some good talent all in this team. It would say that most of the talent is underutilized, and this VN had the potential to be a really interesting and cool, but falls short in most every aspect. There was a lot I liked about this VN, from how the characters were written to the artwork, but the writing never goes all the way and never allows itself to take chances and risks. With this kind of medium, VNs relies on music, artwork, and writing to convey a meaningful experience and story. When one falters, it makes it harder for the other aspects to be as effective as they could be. I really wish this VN could live up to its full potential, but right now it does not and I don’t think it ever will. With an asking price of $12.95, I would say it is not worth it at that price. This whole VN is about 2 to 3 hours long to read and complete all the routes, and it is a hard sell, in my opinion, for $12. If you really are attracted to the art or feel like reading a work that will never live up to its full potential, then go for it. If you’re not but still want to give this a go, wait for a good sale. I wanted to recommend this VN to others, but I can’t with this steep price point. Don’t get me wrong, I did have fun reading this VN, but ultimately it just left me dissatisfied in the end and saddened by the fact that this would probably be as good as it is going to get.

Story wise it's quite nice, a fair bit of CGIs, and more than a bit of amusement. The weakest aspect are the endings. Of which I think the best is likely the bad end about retribution, which is also the saddest one.

It is an all-ages fantasy story with anime-like art and 8 endings.

The main plot is about an apprentice training for entry exam to a prestigious school. There is also some gender bending and consequences of it but served mostly in a light, comedic manner. There is a bit of romance too but it is rather subtle. 
Several choices will lead you to one of the 8 endings; mostly bad endings. Did I enjoy the plot? Well, some parts of it were interesting but for the most part it was rather bland. There is a lack of depth and characters' backgrounds are not explored much, if at all. Still, I guess I enjoyed it more than not but don't expect much here.

The art was done by the same artist as in the Highschool romance. It is an anime inspired western style. I'm honestly not a big fan of most western character designs in VNs but this one passed my likeability threshold, just barely. There is no much variety of character sprites so not all expressions matched the emotions. Backgrounds were well done so no complaints here. Overall style is pretty simplistic but works well. 

Music is about average. Nothing stands out or is memorable but it matched events ok for the most part. There are only a few tracks but since it's a short VN it is acceptable. No movies or songs in here.

No bugs encountered.

To conclude, a relatively short fantasy VN with about average story, ok anime inspired western at and average music. If you enjoy simple fantasy stories and school settings then you might enjoy this one. I can recommend it but just about: 5/10",1616787609,1616787609,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The VN has quite a few Choices which results in there being also quite a few different Endings. I expected this to be relatively lighthearted and comical, however there are quite a few bad Endings and even the good Routes have a few ""sad"" Things going on. I normally dont like things like that, but they didnt really bother me here as I really liked how the Story developed and it was pretty fitting overall. I also like the Art and the Translation is nearly flawless. If you enjoy Fantasy and Romance as Genres then I am certain that you will enjoy Magi Trials. 

I would recommend buying it on Sale, or from the Indiegala Bundle that is currently available if you read this shortly after I publish this Review. One Playthrough took me around 2.5 hours and if you try to get all the different Routes and Achievements it will for sure take the same Amount longer. If you liked the other Highschool Romance VN then this one should also be a good addition, just be prepared for a bit more serious/sad topics or things to happen. 

I nearly forgot, but the Ending leaves quite a bit in the open, so I would love to see this getting a Sequel, where he/she is actually getting to be a Sorcerer.

Overall I will give this a 8/10

However it falls short of it's asking price (regardless of discount).

First and foremost are the characters, they have no development in the game. The main character is never explained about their origins, such as their hometown, who his family is or why he wants to become a Magi (until much later for the last point). The world is not explained beyond snippets of information put in but never elaborated on, such as a war that may/may not be going on. There is no growth in characters they all stay the same as you meet them with no change in interactions.

The game is also WAY too short, coming in at just about two hours of playtime (less if you are replaying and skip dialogue). It doesn't go in depth about how your character lives in the academy, what they do in free time and no other characters get introduced. There are only 6 characters, thats it, and they don't get fleshed out at all. During my time playing through it I only ever heard 4 tracks played in loops that sometimes did not mesh well with the scene at hand, e.g. music being too upbeat for sad/serious scenes etc. There are no sound effects to speak of outside of UI button presses.

Suffice to say this game is asking too much and giving too little, if it had more polish in the UI, better character buildup/backstory, sound effects, more than one 'good' ending and more plays on the themes used (Guy turns into a girl) which was barely used at all and had no resolution.

I would only recommed this on Discount and even then only below £4 would be reasonable.

It’s refreshing to say the least, and surprisingly, an unexpected adventure.

We play as Shaun, a young man who’s too ambitious for his own good, but that’s the life for those who want to enter the school of magic, particularly, the most prestigious school in the whole kingdom. Shaun was born in a small town, and he learnt magic more out of curiosity rather than prestige, so he realises there’s still has a long road ahead of him to be accepted in the school’s trials.

Out of options and running out of time, Shaun decides to take an even shorter route and sneaks into the school’s library, searching for a powerful spell to increase his strength, and magic power. He finds the spell all right, but after he performed it, something goes terribly wrong, turning him into a woman, and in a pretty hot one as well. This is not what he had in his mind, but still, he endures it and decides to take the trials and face his life dream of becoming the strongest sorcerer.

His new genre is the least of the problems he’ll face ahead. A plot among the high roles of the school is taking motion, and Shaun is caught right in the middle of it. As if that’s not enough, hidden dangerous are waiting his curiosity to go out of boundaries, and knowing Shaun, it’s just a matter of time.

[b]Magi Trials[/b] is the second “Gender Bender” game [i]Dharker Studio[/i] releases, and early I thought this was some spiritual spin-off from [b]Highschool Romance[/b], but alas, it’s a completelynew, and different game, but sharing some close similarities. This time, our protagonist changes completely, thanks to magic, and he’s now known as Sophie. it’s not just cloths, it’s a complete physical change. Now, now, I know what many of you are thinking, but this time (such as [b]Highschool Romance[/b]), we don’t have an adult patch, therefore there’s no such thing as nudity, or sexual content. Although some extreme tags may come out like Futanari, or Trap, and although that would be wrong, it’s actually a very soft-core game anyway. Dialogues are still sexy and provocative, but when comes to visuals, there’s no adult themes.

[i]Dharker Studio[/i] delivers yet, another pleasant Visual Novel, with a solid and unconventional story, but quickly becoming an addictive one, with a well written plot, relatively well developed characters and multiple endings to enjoy. This time, players don’t need to be curious about the next sexy scene, instead, the narrative delivers a story to follow on, and that’ the main motivation. The game plot is simple, and wasn’t pushed too hard, but yet, fulfills the need to generate enough information about the world-history, and the surroundings, and that makes a huge difference! Some words gained a new meaning; Mages refer to male wizards, and Magi is now the term of female practitioners of magic. Small details like these always help shape a much confident storyline.

The narrative is well directed, and I personally felt it wasn’t so spicy as other previous titles, even though there is a mix of flirting and provocative dialogues, they are mostly for the giggles, and rarely engage in a serious sexual scene. There’s a huge amount of humour as its been common among [i]Dharker Studio[/i] games, with dialogues playing smartly along characters' relationships. There is also an emotional side to this story, especially for the bad endings, that can go easily unexpected.

Visually, [b]Magi Trials[/b] adopted the already seen art style in [b]Highschool Romance[/b], but this time adding much more detail, and longer traces to character renders, making them look more distinct. Renders are present in a western design approach, with a cartoonish look, but still maintaining the usual sexy traces we’re all used to. Girl renders have some expressions, not a huge variety, but enough to enjoy the changes of mood. As always, they are hand-drawn, and this time we also have an increase in resolution, meaning those playing at 1920x1080 will have a perfect image quality, with no upscale noticeable. Cutscenes, or in this case, special scenes, are amazingly well done, with hand drawn characters portrayed perfectly well the renders they represent, adding a deeper meaning to the storyline.

Since we have a magic based game, it’s good to mention the overall feeling of the title, that is well represented in character clothes, but also in the Backgrounds. While magic robes and school uniforms make up for the whole ambience, it’s important to have adequate locations to go with. Backgrounds do a trusty representation of the glimpse of the world we get to enjoy through this adventure. Inside the school, large stairways cover the rocky building, and the large corridors are almost labyrinths holding classrooms. Not to mention the dining hall, with large tables and the essence of magic everywhere… Wait, where have I seen this before? Yes, in Harry Potter movies. Take note, this is not a critique, as [b]Magi Trials[/b] have its own feeling, mixing the classic magic outlook in a post-modern world. There are no smartphones, but there’s a feeling of the modern age in the city. A classy mix, but inside the school, I couldn’t stop but feeling overrun by the Harry Potter vibe, in which is not a bad thing, but totally unrelated at the same time. With the architecture out of the way, I have to refer the great job by the artists, in maintaining a solid atmosphere throughout the game, across different scenarios.

As a choice-based Visual Novel, players decide their fate, and the fate of their romance as well. With two characters to romance with, a school teacher with an intense plot twist, and a fellow student with an endeavours past, the option is totally up for players, but almost every choice matters. Despise only having two romantic ways with almost 2 hours of gameplay each, (and an extra as a surprise), there is a total of eight different possible endings for this adventure.

Deluxe Edition available on Steam, adds a few interesting extras, which are available as a DLC as well. Six different Dakimakuras with three different characters portrayed, each with a resolution of 2000x4800. 25 Wallpapers, all hand drawn, with 1920x1080 as resolution. 23 Avatars, to use on Steam or any other platform you may want to, with 500x500 as resolution, and there’s avatars with all in-game characters, so that’s a plus. The Soundtrack is also part of the Deluxe Edition, and once again we have [i]Sam L Jones[/i] as a sole composer for the game. Music ranges from smooth neo-classic with ambient influences. 12 tracks at MP3 320kpbs, and although it’s not as upbeat and melodic as we’re used to, it fits the game perfectly, and adds a lot to the atmosphere.

[b]Magi Trials[/b] is definitely a nice surprise, with an emotional side that many may underestimate. In any case, it’s another solid release by [i]Dharker Studio[/i], with nice characters, and a well directed narrative, charming and captivating. Recommended for anyone who appreciates a good storyline with fantasy and some funny moments.",1539835753,1539835753,True,10,0,0.617146134376525879,0,False,False,False,False,,,

           this isn't waifus galore like Highschool Romance, but its own thing, and there's nothing wrong with creativity, also glad to see males exist in this universe (lol) the story is longer than HSR's was and thats good. it made me chuckle and i enjoyed the game.

[*] Good story with many branching paths in which can also lead to branching successes and fails.
[*] Nice consistent use of character art. Good to see.
[*] Has a intigrated text-to-voice in the engine for anyone that has issues reading a Visual Novel.
[*] Unique style of art. I like it. Might remind me in the future that the Visual Novel I'm reading is from Dharker Studios.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] No option to adjust text speed. Rather annoying for speed readers like myself to double click to get the next sentence.
[*] Relevent to the previous con, the text appears in chunks bit by bit at a slow rate. Not smooth at all.
[*] Inconsistent use of background art I believe. Some drawn by the developers and other from a CGI program? Not too sure but I believe so.

Briefly i'll round up what this game isn't and what it is

it is NOT
-action based
-turn based
-real time
-resource management

so if you want any of those, you're looking in the wrong place!

it IS
-A game, you can win, fumble your way through it like an oaf and you'll get sub optimal endings or straight up murdered!
-fun ( my opinion, ofcourse but it certaily made me giggle several times. )
-moderate length, fair in my opinion but if you powergame it you can finish it in a decent gaming session.
-full of hidden dialogue and endings, not just the endings change, character interations and characters may appear or disappear completely!
-full of decisions that actually matter, and influence the dialogue you see and the endings you get.
-An interesting world, with above average art.

he game isn't heavily frustrating, it drops subtle hints along the way if you learn to interpret them and apply them correctly you can succeed the dialogue checks with little issue so there is some minor level of skill to be had, there are dialogue trees specifically unlocked by picking dialogue strategiacally both in the current scene and later, i won't spoil because it's a fairly short game but there are a couple of fights you can succeed or fail to varying degrees, which is refreshing from a Vn.

My first playthrough took 7 hours?! it seemed quicker.. time flies when your having fun i guess. and i haven't even unlocked half of the achievements with that playthrough, with the various dialogue options and possible endings i could see atleast 2-3 playthroughs beeing needed to see most of the content and a little save scumming to get different endings if you don't want to replay the same parts over, as a Vn that isn't a big deal, though you can just spam click through alot of dialogue if you've seen it before, i would say the game is perfectly reasonable for the price, if you work by the £1/hour entertainment rule.
Personally I'd like to see more of this world/universe, or maby an extended edition would be good.

Buy it if you are into Vn's ( visual novels ) and you want a fun little world to immerse your self into for a day!

As a fan of the first Highschool Romance (this one is a spiritual sequel of sorts) I obviously had to go and buy this game. And despite the small flaws, I enjoyed this game a lot.

Pros:
+ Excellent art. Character artist Enrique Bolatre's style really fits the game. He's the same artist as the first HSR.
+ The game's plot is darker this time around.
+ The MC doesn't want to return to his initial self, he seems to be fine as a girl.
+ In regards to the magic part, it's well thought out. It's as if magic really existed; very detailed.
+ Even if there are only two-and-a-half romanceable characters, they are better written this time.
+ The music isn't very distracting.
+ No nudity or sex. Some ecchi felt a bit shoehorned in, though.

Cons:
- Too short. I got ending #4 on my own and then used a walkthrough to get the other endings. More endings, or a longer plot, would've been great. It also seems to end rather abruptly on some endings. I was feeling comfy on my first run and all of a sudden the plot went to hell.
- Some proofreading would be great. Make no mistake, the grammar and spelling is fine, but there are some issues with punctuation. English isn't my first language and I noticed them easily.
- The Deluxe Edition extras aren't worth the extra 5 dollars: there aren't any exclusive CGs or wallpapers and everything exists in-game AFAIK.

So, honestly, for ten bucks you could do much worse. If you're like me and you like traps/gender-bending characters and yuri, make no mistake, this game is for you. But don't get it if you want nude scenes, sex or a very light-hearted story.

Some reviewers were complaining that Magi Trials was not worthy of the Highschool Romance name, but, it's set in a high school (kind of) and you do get to romance girls, right? Poor MC had too much on his plate to even consider romance at first, but he kind of gets used to it fast.

The endings of Magi Trials were a bit less varied than HSR, and one is incredibly difficult to get compared to the difficulty in the original, but I feel that this allowed them to flesh out their ""main ending"" more, and got me more into the story in the end.

Because I'm thirsty for gender bending content and sexy succubi.

[b]Did it deliver?[/b]
Most certainly yes. It did deliver awkward moments of gender dysphoria. I feed upon the schadenfreude of a boy realizing he looks really hot as a girl. It also had a half-naked succubus. 

[b]How can anyone complain?[/b]
Well, okay, let's get down to the nitty gritty of the story here. The story overall is internally consistent, so all threads work out within the universe brought to life within this game. Different endings don't magically change who people are and the endings reflect how this all works out. At the same time, this all really boils the story down to 4 paths, and while there are multiple endings, I feel most of the endings stem from one single branch of the story.

Ultimately, I feel like there's a lack of options here and an inflexibility to the characters you interact with. Only one ending really felt at all fulfilling, while all others seemed to make me feel a measure of failure. Like, I shouldn't be kind of frustrated when I do get the succubus ending, but I was after the third or fourth time.

[b]Interface?[/b]
I have no real complaints to interface, it's actually quite an improvement from Highschool Romance. Good on them. The title menu still feels like an early 2000s flash game though.

[b]CG/Music?[/b]
Good CGs, largely forgettable but unobtrusive music.

[b]Copy editing quality?[/b]
The script could be given another good round of editing for grammatical errors during the meat of the game. Some portions of the game felt a little less polished due to spelling errors that wouldn't be caught with an automatic spellcheck.

[b]But really, should I buy this VN?[/b]

I highly enjoyed the first games and only had a few issues with it overall. Sadly this game did not quite live up to those expectations.

Before I go into the things I disliked, I really want to say the things I liked about this game. I feel like the good things about this game, are quiet good. First the art is wonderful. I feel like they really upped their game with this when it came to art. Its detailed, high res, and I enjoy the style a lot. Next I enjoyed the overall story and setting. I think it was an awesome idea to take the concept from the first game but to try it in a different setting with different asspects and stakes.  The music was also fantastic to listen to. Character were very likeable. There was a neat little plot twist That I like a lot.

Now for the negative, and I feel these hit really hard. First lets talk about the games Length, and how this impacts the story and characters in a very negative way. We don't really have enough time with a majority of the characters to like or dislike them. Honestly, other than the main love interests you interact with the other characters so little its hard to really like or dislike them. I won't go into further detail for those that still buy the game as I don't wish to spoil it. 

My next negative point would be  the amount of love interests  which is really only 2 and a half. The first game had 3 which isn't a lot, but to have less. That said I can some what understand that has this game has a bit more of a plot to it then just getting good grades and falling in love. 

While overall I have a very hard time recomending this game, I did enjoy it to an extent. I hope there will be a 3rd in the series as I absolutely want one, but I crave something longer that has not only a good story, but characters I can like, I can grow to love and hate that are beyond the love interests. If someone is presented to me as a 'antagonist' to me, I want the game to show me why they would be my antagonist through character dialog and actions, not just some character telling me they are terrible and a few very brief encounters. I do not regreat buying, I'm enjoyed it, but I can not fully recomend this game, and hope that the next one is more substantial.

Visuals :)

With better than average art that falls in an area reminicant but not the same as standard anime I easily can approve of its style. 

Routing :) 

Choices Choices Choices so many choices. Now while more doesn't always equal better I did feel in control of my character's fate to an extent and that says alot. 

Polish :( 

There is no excuse for spelling mistakes in a finished title.  Also gramar is a thing, the oxford comma is your friend and would help some confusing lines in the game. Next i would say the timings for CG images seem off. the game tends to put up the CG long before the actual actions in the CG take place causing the story to lose visual consistancy.

to conclude the game is enjoyable and I like it so far. Buy it if you like this sort of game if not just wait for a sale but its still worth buying.

I was perfectly fine with it as was though, just a minor opinion of mine. The sequel on the other hand pulled me in faster than the first game.

However, just because of my incredibly high expectations from the first game, I still can't give it a yes. I changed this review according to new experiences. 

Pretty interesting storyline, but it was a little unexpected. My main problem with this VN is that they didn't focus on the romance part as much as I would of liked. It's why I love the first one so much. It's this problem that left me disappointed. 

Pros:
-good soundtrack
-great/unique visuals
-likable MC
-interesting storyline
-likable love interest
-little bit of yuri tossed in (kind of?)

Cons:
-limited romance (comparatively to the first game)
-endings are typically ""bad"" endings
-not very long

If you haven't played the first one, I'd highly recommend that one, It's by far my all time favorite VN. As much as I was hyped for this game, I must say I was disappointed. It just didn't come close to the first one.

As much as it pains me, I gotta give this game a no. HOWEVER. If you enjoy a challenge and a pretty interesting story line, this is the perfect game for you.
If I came for the story/plot, it'd definately be a yes.
