It might not be the most approachable, but after a while I found myself addicted and had a great time. The price seems pretty fair for the amount of content.

[u]In long:[/u] Each of the 60 levels features an arrangement of shapes (triangles, squares, hexagons, etc.) with colored outlines. Your goal is to spread colors until everything matches the outlines. In terms of [b][u]mechanics[/u][/b] you click on a colored tile and it spreads to all adjacent tiles. This alone is rather basic, but soon different mechanics are introduced: Temporary tiles are destroyed after a single click. Dot tiles can hold a second color underneath the current color. Rotator tiles and switch tiles are mostly self-explanatory. My only gripe with the mouse-only controls is that rotators are operated with click-drag/swipe motions, which can misfire (LMB/RMB would have been better in my opinion).
Once these mechanics enter the fray, the [b][u]difficulty[/u][/b] ramps up considerably. First you should try to fully understand the mechanics, but I'll frankly admit that I never realized just how brilliant and powerful the dot tiles were until the penultimate level. The game rewards planning and thoughtfully revising your strategy, especially on the later levels, where several mechanics are combined into really hard challenges. Random clicking will rarely lead to success. Unfortunately for some reason the undo button is limited to 3 moves. This forces a lot of unneeded and boring restarts. But levels almost never require more than 30 moves, which makes them seem quite doable at all times. Still, the level layouts are almost universally very clever and the difficulty ranges from easy and obvious to tough-as-nails battles about shaving off single moves.
This hints at the fact that most of the difficulty arises from the optional [b][u]developer pars[/u][/b]. Matching or beating the par will mark the level as ""mastered"", which is only relevant for achievements. If your focus is just getting through the levels, you will probably have a considerably easier time. I, however, enjoyed the added challenge and found the par mechanic to be a valuable addition. Knowing a better solution to be possible kept me coming back and finally undershooting the par always felt really good. It took me about 5.5 hours to fully beat the game, but it should be noted that at least 1.5 hours were spent trying to beat the par on just a handful of levels.

In terms of [b][u]presentation[/u][/b] the game gets passing marks. The visuals are simple, but clean. The music seemed okay, but like with most puzzle games, I quickly turned it off. This neatly leads to a few minor gripes with the [b][u]technical implementation[/u][/b]: There are no volume sliders or separate settings, just a general mute button. Unfortunately this setting is also not remembered between sessions and you need to mute the game each time you start it. The same with the par visibility (I don't know why, but by default pars are hidden). The Unity loader takes care of most other technical aspects (windowed mode, resolutions, etc.).

In [b][u]conclusion[/u][/b] I had a lot of fun challenging my brain with this clever game. I'm very impressed how a few simple mechanics and just 60 levels kept me hooked for well over 5 hours. Compared to other similarly simple-looking puzzle games on Steam, the price seems a little bit high (and the -20% sale discount pretty low), but I found it to be totally worth the money as the game far exceeded my expecations.",1532422045,1532422045,True,6,0,0.553356647491455078,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The goal of the game is to paint all geometric shapes as demanded by their border color. You start with a few shapes already colored you can click on them to paint the adjacent shapes with the same color. You need to make sure not to erase some color completely, which is why this game can be so difficult.

There are 60 levels in total and they are divided into 10 level packs. Each pack introduces something new, which makes the gameplay more interesting or even a bit trickier. You are confronted with shapes that vanish once you click them, shapes that can store one color, shapes that can unlock some of their neighbors provided that it is painted with a certain color... It really makes the later levels feel fresh even if the basic mechanic stays the same. 

Not all ten packs are unlocked from the beginning: to gain access to them, you have to complete a certain number of previous levels. Doing so shouldn't pose a challenge to most players as the requirements to unlock all the levels are pretty low.

You are free to click any number of times you want as you can only lose if some color is completely gone from the level. However, if you want to ""master"" the level, you must not exceed a predetermined number of moves. This usually means that you have to can't make any unnecessary moves. Since it's quite unlikely that you'll manage to achieve this in your first try (with the exception of the first few levels), there is some replayability value here. In some levels, it's possible to find an even shorter solution.

I mentioned Adjacency's difficulty a number of times already, which is why I would like to dedicate this paragraph to the difficulty curve. Although there is no tutorial, the initial levels do a very good job at teaching you how to play. Afterwards, the game feels quite difficult all the time, but it reaches your limit very slowly. I wasn't able to complete the last few levels, but I always felt like I was very close.

There are no hints or bonuses in this game and I can't decide if this is bad or not. Although it's sometimes really frustrating when I can't complete a level, this feeling actually motivates me to actually do it myself, not just to click the hint button and be done with it. You have to use all the stubbornness and brain power you have to complete some seemingly-impossible level and that might just be a good thing. Players nowadays are spoiled anyway, especially when it comes to puzzles games (but 10 hints for just $4.99!).

Now that I've finished talking about the gameplay, let's focus on the appearance of the game. The background is, fortunately, dark, which is perfect for night owl gamers like me. The shape border colors are bright, creating a visually appealing contrast with the background. The animations are smooth and fascinating, which is a plus. The sounds are, like the rest of the game, quite minimalistic. Apart from the ongoing atmospheric background noises, your clicks on the shapes result in most of what you'll hear throughout the game.

That's really all there is to talk about. I can't say I've spotted any negative things at all. Nothing except my own incapability to solve some levels was bothering me and although I've mostly experienced frustration during the entire time of me playing the game, I can only recommend the game. The price isn't steep so if you like puzzle games, go for it. You won't regret the purchase.

With love,
BirdCute

The overall goal of the game is easy - match the color inside each shape to the color of its border. To do this, you have to ""spread"" colors from exisiting tiles to their adjacent tiles. It's a pretty simple mechanic, but good puzzle design along with a few interesting twists / mechanics keeps the game fresh.

Difficulty-wise, it's not too hard, but hard enough that you can't just guess your way through the game. Progression is clear and new mechanics are introduced with some ramp-up. One thing here is that sometimes it was hard to figure out exactly what new mechanics did - there's no textual explanation, so even if you solve the puzzles introducing the mechanic, it might take a while for you to really understand what it's doing.  There's also a perfect score for each function if you want another layer of challenge.

Graphics are nothing to write home about, but the shapes are sharp and the colors make it easy to stare at the screen while trying to figure out the next move. It fits with the type of game this was designed to be.

The music fits well with the aesthetic the game is going for and has some chill and relaxing tracks for puzzle-solving.

Overall, this is an engaging puzzler that's worth your time to spend a few hours with and use some of those dormant brain cells.",1498787991,1498787991,True,15,0,0.650010824203491211,0,True,False,False,False,,,
