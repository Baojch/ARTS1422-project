My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

However, the underwater inhabitants hire Blue Cassette Player to stop Dr. Taco and his companion. Mr. Rhino launches the first Cyber-Crab prototype to eliminate the Blue Cassette Player and anyone else who stands in Dr. Taco's way.

The game has clicker elements and a game palette that contains 20 primary colors. All objects in the game are animated and there are five types of weapons available including blaster, submachine gun, laser, shotgun, and bubble-gun. The game is divided into three zones: Ocean, Space, and Blender. The exclusive soundtrack adds to the game's overall charm.

Overall, Crab Dub is a fun game that offers an engaging storyline, a colorful and animated world, and a variety of weapons to choose from.

Crab Dub is an absolute mess of a game. From the very beginning I knew I was in for a treat when I couldn't even figure out how to get into an actual level. There are actual steam guides on how to begin the game because it's just not obvious at all. This theme of having nothing explained to you carries throughout the whole game. There is no instruction on what you're supposed to do at all. In order to progress through parts of the game you have to find a cat to click on and then click on some weird medal thing. This isn't explained and it took me a solid 15 minutes to figure this out. I'd say a solid 50% of my already short play time was spent trying to figure out what the hell I was supposed to do in any given level. Then I'd say another 45% of my playtime was spent on the ATROCIOUS second level. Oh my god where do I begin with this absolute dog turd of a level. You're stuck in a tiny tube with an EXTREMELY slowly rising pool of acid that you must float in while clicking on falling cubes and rockets coming at you while also shooting said acid at falling apples to destroy them (again this wasn't made clear at all and I died 5 times before figuring out you can click the pool of acid to fire it at the falling apples. After probably 8 minutes of doing absolutely nothing, you finally get to the top to fight a boss. At this point you have rockets, apples, and cubes all coming at you with no reaction time at all to destroy them and the cubes sometimes get stuck behind clouds or falling acid so you can't destroy them and same with the apples. This creates a frustrating boss fight that isn't challenging because of interesting gameplay but instead because the developer put no care into their game at all. Finally we come to the final level which is just even more frustrating somehow. You're stuck doing these weird jumping sequences where you have to jump through space avoiding projectiles and stationary bombs. This isn't too bad EXCEPT FOR THE HITBOXES ARE SO WONKY AND JANK THAT YOU DIE WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN TOUCH ANYTHING. It's an absolute joke. It's like the developer forgot to finish the game. Actually that might be the case since there's not even a way to adjust the volume of the game. The music is actually surprisingly nice but what is not nice are the headache inducing sound affects every time you jump or shoot a gun, things that you will be doing a lot of. Just skip this piece of crap. It's not even worth the 50 cents I paid for it. For more reviews, follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40795588/] curator page.

The game failed to garner any interest from gamers, by the developers own achievements.  The achievement for ""activating the magic button"" and clearing the first level has less than 5% of gamers holding it... 95% of people who own this game never bothered playing it to the end of the single screen tutorial first level.  Ouch. 

While the artwork is charming as always, it's badly presented here.  A choice was made to use obsolete retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or time, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.  Resolution is locked and can't be changed, and there's no visual or graphics tweaks, so there's no way to improve the compromised visuals.  

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for many differently-abled gamers.  There's no widescreen support, the game displays 4:3 pillarboxed (despite being launched in 2017!)  These flaws push this game far below minimum acceptable standards for PC.

其次游戏的画面和音效也未能达到玩家的期望。虽然游戏采用了可爱的螃蟹角色设计，但整体画面质量平平，缺乏足够的细节和精致度。音效方面，游戏的背景音乐和音效也显得单调乏味，无法为玩家营造出紧张刺激或轻松愉快的竞技氛围。

再者游戏的操作体验也存在一些问题。游戏的控制不够流畅，响应速度较慢，这在一定程度上影响了玩家的操作体验。在激烈的竞技过程中，玩家往往需要快速而准确地做出反应，但游戏的操作却常常让人感到迟缓和笨拙。

此外游戏在平衡性方面也存在一些问题。某些螃蟹角色的能力过于强大，而另一些则显得相对较弱，这使得玩家在选择角色时容易感到不公平。同时游戏中的道具和装备系统也缺乏平衡性，一些道具过于强大，严重影响了游戏的竞技公平性。

最后从性价比的角度来看也显得不够出色。相较于其他同类游戏，它在玩法、画面、音效以及操作体验等方面都没有明显的优势，而价格却相对较高，这使得它的性价比相对较低。

综上所述，在玩法机制、画面音效、操作体验以及平衡性等方面都存在令人失望的问题。如果你正在寻找一款有趣且富有挑战性的螃蟹竞技游戏，那么这款游戏可能不是你的最佳选择。建议开发者在未来的版本中，对游戏进行更深入的开发和优化，以提升玩家的游戏体验。",1632737931,1711298764,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Wir sind eine Wasserschnecke und müssen in farbintensiven Cartoon-Design drei Abschnitte meistern.

""Crab Dub"" ist ein merkwürdiges Spiel. Auf den ersten Blick wirkt es wie ein simpler Plattformer in ungewöhnlich stylischem Gewand. Blickt man unter die Haube findet man aber nur eine Sammlung aus drei Minispielen, alle sehr schwach gebaut und mit bescheuertem Leveldesign.

Der erste Levelabschnitt verwirrt schon dadurch, daß man gerade nicht das machen muß, was einem naheliegend erscheint. Man findet sich auf einer Plattform wieder und kann schießen, nachdem man sich schon im Hauptmenü die Waffe aussuchen konnte. Aber weder springen noch schießen führen weiter. Auch wenn das wie ein Spoiler wirkt, nenne ich hier die Lösung, weil sie ziemlich grottig ist: wir müssen nämlich nur auf den Ausgang klicken und schon sind wir im nächsten Abschnitt. 

Das ist aber kein gutes Leveldesign. Natürlich kann man eine andere Struktur als die offensichtliche verwenden. Daß die Lösung aber die dummstmögliche ist, spricht nicht gerade für das Spiel. Man fühlt sich nicht etwa positiv überrascht, sondern eher verarscht.

Und so etwas findet sich immer wieder. Im zweiten Level sind wir reitend auf einem, Quietscheentchen in einem Glaskolben und müssen Raketen, Quadraten und Äpfeln ausweichen oder sie zerstören, indem wir auf sie klicken. Mechanisch ist das ziemlich eindimensional und kratzt man einmal die bunte Oberfläche ab, ist das einfach nur eine Clicker-Game-Variante. 

Dazu unpassend gibt es einen Dubstep-Soundtrack, also die Musikrichtung, die von Können und Kompositionskompetenz am weitmöglichsten entfernt ist. Eine Richtung, die Bands wie ""Little Big"" wunderbar auf die Schippe nehmen, weil sie deren Monotie und Flachheit so auf die Spitze treiben, daß die Parodie eine eigene Qualität bekommt. Hier aber ist von Satire nichts zu spüren.

Umfangreich ist das Spiel auch nicht gerade. Und so fragt man sich ständig, ob die Macher nicht lieber einfach einen abgedrehten Comic herausbringen sollten, denn zeichnen können sie. Aber das Spieldesign sollten sie doch lieber Leuten überlassen, die sich damit auskennen.

[code] Anatoliy Loginovskikh умеет радовать свою аудиторию потоками наркомании, соблазняя игроков несуразными персонажами, возмутительно странными механиками и безумными локациями. Сегодня мы взглянем на очередное чудо-юдо, вышедшее несколько лет назад от данного разработчика. [/code]

Crab Dub можно обозвать настоящим сборником аркадных развлечений! Этот продукт разбился на три кусочка, каждый из которых тянет на самостоятельную игру, а в наборе мы имеем крайне горячие и веселые механики, позволяющие взглянуть на мир глазами подводных обитателей...без приема запрещенных веществ.

[u] Режимы игры [/u]
[olist]
[*]Первая стадия игры более всего походит на привычный платформер. Главному герою необходимо путешествовать по подводному миру, отстреливая полчища врагов и злобных снарядов, а после найти спрятанного котика, дабы выстрелить в его усатую морду. Если все сделали правильно, то некий телепорт на карте готов принять вашу грешную душу в свои объятия, ну и перекинуть на похожую локацию для дальнейшего геноцида подводных котов.
Режим хоть и выглядит привычно, но вы определенно не поймете что от вас хотят, куда идти и кто на экране вообще представляет угрозу. В этом и была суть головокружительного приключения глазастого существа, что может использовать богатый арсенал для уничтожения всего живого (Речь про главного героя). В конце этого безобразия нас столкнут с боссом! Уровень сложности режима довольно прост, но следует включить соображалку.
[*]Вторая стадия игры полностью переворачивает представление о Crab Dub! Наш герой проникает в бескрайнюю колбу, которая постепенно заполняется зеленоватой жидкостью. И было бы все сладко, но на голову нашему глазастику постоянно падают камни, а с краев карты безустанно летят ракеты, что только и мечтают подогреть нам пролежни. Помимо этого будут падать и вражеские яблоки...короче, народ, это полное сумасшествие, но зато веселое до неприличия. В конце стадии нас ждет битва с боссом, а если вам будет крайне лениво бодать его своим величием, то данного неприятеля можно вообще пропустить.
[*]Финальная часть игры пройдет в бескрайнем космосе! Следует оседлать ламу и искать знакомых котиков на карте. Если кот был обнаружен, а главный герой остался жив, то очередной портал на карте примет нас в свои глубины.
Глазастику будут мешать астероиды, кометы и космический мусор. Добавляем сюда неуклюжее управление и передвижение по таймингу, ну а в финале встретимся с очередным злодеем.
[/olist]

Игра получила настоящую передозировку нелепых ситуаций и механик. Игроку будет сложно понять все тонкости с первого раза, но смерть персонажа не несет в себе ничего критичного. Мы же всегда учимся на своих ошибках, верно? Вот и данная забава толкнет нас в сторону самостоятельного изучения.

Графически игра выглядит сносно. Картинка радует своей палитрой, анимация окружения никак не царапает глаз, ну а новомодные эффекты оставим для ААА проектов.
Музыка идеально подчеркивает игровой процесс. Нет никакого желания ее выключать, либо же заглушать, понеже мозг будет занят совершенно другими вещами.

[list]
[*]Время прохождения 1-1.5 часа.
[*]Рабочие достижения!
[*]Низкая цена. Возможность почувствовать себя наркоманом за малые деньги.
[/list]

Разработчик добавит нелепый сюжет в описание игры, но в самом платформере вы не встретите никакого текста, истории и диалогов. Нужно просто принять этот мир и начинать убивать\спасать подводных и космических котов, а после уничтожать летающие и водоплавающие магнитофоны...это наш долг, это наша судьба! [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmG5uUGh6gU] Только аккуратнее там, лады? [/url]

Если любите подобный психодел, который не отнимет слишком много свободного времени, то советую заглянуть в гавань с магнитофонами. На скидках игру отдают за гроши, что позволит вам совершить грехопадение, а после прилететь обратно. Разработчику желаю творческих успехов, жду что-нибудь более странного и вдохновляющего!
Ну а вам, друзья, приятной игры, соберите всех котов, а то утонут без нашей помощи...

Хочу поблагодарить всех за отдачу и лайки, берегите нервы и избегайте шлака в магазине.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
[i]Crab Dub[/i] is a mouse platformer game with different mechanics in each zones. There are 4 zones in total with a boss fight at the end of the zones.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game uses 2D sprite graphics. I think it looks great for the price tag. I also find the level designs to be unique. I got a bit confused when I was going to play the first zone though so the design might be lacking on that part.

[h1]The game[/h1]
As I said before, the game has 4 zones with different mechanics. You can choose to tackle the first 3 zones in whichever order you want while the last one will be unlocked after you defeat the first three.

The first zone is a platformer game where you have to rescue any available little kittens in the area before proceeding to the exit. You can move and jump with your keyboard and do any other actions with your mouse. There are several areas that you have to finish before the boss and you have to redo the whole area if you die. You can double jump and bounce on jellyfishes to reach your destination. However, these jellyfishes will descend for a few meters after you bounce on it, making it difficult to reach the next platform if you're unable to reach it on the first try. I thought that the only way to finish the area is to bounce on the jellyfishes several times until I reach the exit before I realized in my second playthrough that I actually need to wait a bit before the jump. You also have a gun that can be changed to another type if you obtain a certain item. Note that all guns are available to select when you're about to tackle this zone so this might not be necessary. Anyway, these guns can be used to defeat some enemies, including the boss in this zone. There are also some enemies that are immune from your gun though. You also have 3 hearts that can be recovered if you click on any heart item that you encounter.

In my opinion, the second zone is the most unique zone. You'll be trapped in a tube and you have to click any ice cubes and rocket that you see, dodge all green thingies that comes from the top of the screen, and shoot any apples that also comes from the top of the screen. You'll also have 3 hearts in this zone and there are some heart items to replenish your heart after you reach certain points. Unlike other zones, this zone only has one area that will end after you defeat the boss at the top. It's very hard to beat though since the game needs you to click the objects in precise locations.

The third zone is more like the first one, except that you don't have your gun and have infinite jumps. The enemies are also different; you'll encounter a ball-like creature that can move if you click on it and meteor-like creature which will suddenly show up from the corner of the screen. There is a difficult area where you have to click the ball and avoid the meteors while jumping too. The boss in this stage is also tricky, although it's easy to beat.

The fourth zone only consists of a boss fight. The boss fight isn't that hard but can be annoying to beat.

Although the game has boss fights in all zones, you need to do different things in each zones in order to beat the boss. I admit the game might be a bit confusing at first and some people might also find it annoying to beat (especially the second zone), but it's kinda fun once you get the hang of it. The only thing that I don't like is the fact that you have to press escape after you die to continue.

Pros:
- 4 zones
- Each zone has different mechanics

Cons:
- Might be confusing at the start
- No auto reload after dying

[h1]Conclusions[/h1]
This is a mouse platformer game where you have to do different objectives in each zone. The game has 4 zones in total.

我用着机翻才发现游戏简介里有说明游戏的背景（毕竟机翻，可能和实际内容有出入，欢迎指正XD）：海底深处有个邪恶的Taco博士，他的梦想是将整个海洋纳入囊中。为了实现他的野心，他和他的商业伙伴犀牛先生搞了个叫做Crab Dub（也就是游戏名[spoiler] 所以标题中的螃蟹和主角的样子没啥关系 [/spoiler]）的高科技项目。目的是组件一批网络螃蟹大军(Cyber-Crabs)来为Taco博士服务，实现他的计划。海底的居民们很快察觉到了这个计划，于是雇佣了Blue Cassette Player（可能就是指主角吧）来阻止Taco博士和犀牛先生。犀牛先生得知有人想阻止这个计划以后，决定先制造出第一个网络螃蟹（Cyber Crab），来消灭Blue Cassette Player和其它想阻止这个计划的人。
游戏共有四关：第一关，选啥枪都行，每小关的通关方式是点击图中所有的蓝色猫猫，最后点击魔法药丸（magic pill）（药丸样子看成就），即可进入下一小关，注意躲避剑鱼和乌贼，因为玩家没有硬直，碰一下差不多就死了。关底的boss只需站在爱心处，利用枪的抛物线攻击boss（那台头上有数字的录音机）并注意躲避鱼雷就行了；第二关，需要点击从左右方向飞来的导弹和直线下落的方块来消除障碍，而斜向移动的苹果则需点击玩家下方的绿色液体溅起液滴来消除（溅起的液滴会被天上掉下来的绿色液体挡住，绿色液体对玩家无害，点击过多会导致液面下降），当绿色液体达到一定的高度时，有溅起的液滴击杀boss（头上带数字的那个），最后点击魔法药丸（magic pill）即可过关；第三关，和第一关类似（找猫点魔法药丸），点击漂浮的红色物体可以使它朝一个不确定的方向移动一小段距离，注意不要让主角飞出陨石带（在陨石带中移动可以）。关底的boss用主角的身体触碰即可造成伤害（主角碰到boss会弹起来不过不会扣血），把握好时机，别撞到飞过来的陨石就行了；最后一关，玩家只需打一个boss就能整个游戏通关了[spoiler] 也就是打那位故事背景中邪恶的Taco博士 [/spoiler]。然而，这个boss是有些难度的。玩家只能通关A和D键控制主角在一个圆周轨迹上移动，并且要躲很多障碍物，还有一台收音机会紧跟着你，你撞到它基本就死了。障碍最好躲的地方我个人觉得是boss的下方（障碍有boss每隔一段时间射出的一圈发散状弹幕和飞过来的陨石），而容易输出的地方则是boss的左、右、上、侧（点的越快，输出越高）。至于那个追着你的收音机，你只要朝它射击，它就会在原地停一会。多试几次，找找感觉，就能过了。[strike] 你看我这么手残的人，死了四次也过了 [/strike]

第一关
平台跳跃
点击圆盘过关，关卡内有小狗子需要先点掉狗子。高亮度水母可以踩。
关底收音机
可以用第二把枪（直线子弹攻击那把）在左右两块石头卡住打，就只需要躲鱼类，不用管音响了。
第二关
点击消除掉落的方块和侧方的飞弹。苹果需要向上发射液体消除（液体会被滴落中的液滴挡住），液滴持续滴落，让液面一直上涨直到关底。
第三关
注意障碍物可以通过点击移动即可。
BOSS
本体是台子上的核心，收音机可以通过攻击打出硬直。最大的障碍是反人类的操作，只能在固定线路顺逆时针移动。

The game isn't very long unfortunately and will be beaten in two hours , it depends on the player, but each level is unique and different to the previous one. So we have a some variety here which makes the game kinda nice, adding to that arcade nostalgia i was talking about.
The graphics for the game is very decently done, the sounds and OST fits in well with the game and will be enjoyed.

Pros:
* It's very pretty
* The music is nice
* It's weird, and I like weird
* There are three little game zones (each a different play style)

Cons:
* The first zone contains the most content (2D platformer), and imo is the worst zone
* No gamepad option, no control remap
* Game uses a combination of keyboard (left, right, jump) and mouse (complete tasks, fire) which is really awkward
* The controls are A [left], D [right] and SPACE [jump] but direction+jump doesn't always seem to work, leading to lots of frustrating deaths.
* Space bar is an annoying key for [jump] because it automatically repeats, leading to accidental double-jumps.
* Complete lack of tutorial (i.e. ""click on the blue-grey round thing to finish each level"" woud have been useful). I usually do like exploring a game to work out how to play it, but this wasn't a fun way to do it.
* I think zone 2 would bore a lot of people. I'm from the Game + Watch generation, so this kind of simple, repetitive gameplay is alright, but even so - a few minutes in, it was getting boring.

Overall, the game has more negatives than positives, and that's mainly down to controls, so - it's a thumbs-down from me.

Второе меню - запуск этого режима - жмем на краба(по центру экрана, в первом режиме надо жать на кнопку под крабом) и запускается игра;

Если при нажатии уровень не завершается - значит где-то на уровне есть не менее металлический кот, которого нужно надуть так же нажатием мышью, после чего можно будет нажать уже на круг.

У нас есть 3 игры, и битва с боссом. Первая это платформер, в которой надо надуть котят, и тыркнуть мышкой на телепортер, в конце будет битва с боссом. Вторая - надо на уточке отстреливаться от ракет и кубиков льда, находясь в банке которая заполняется чем-то желтым, пока мы не окажемся наверху и не пристрелим босса. Третья - верхом на ослике надо найти котят в безвоздушном пространстве, надуть их и также найти телепортер, и также прикончить босса в конце. Потом нас ждет финальный босс и хэппи-энд. Игра проходится примерно за час со всеми достижениями, хотя она и несколько хардкорная.

[h1]Графика и звуки.[/h1]
Картинка простенькая, но по хорошему наркоманистая. Музыка - неплохая электронщина.

3 игры в одном флаконе, от знатного своим визуальным стилем, инди-разраба Анатолия Логиновских. Игра достаточно неплохая, и вполне может увлечь на часик своего прохождения.

Платформер состоящий из трех актов. Итак мы играем за боевого краба, который умеет прыгать, взаимодействовать с окружающими предметами и стрелять из различных пушек. Да это настоящий боевой краб... Чтобы пройти каждый из уровней, нам нужно найти всех котов и наполнить их воздухом, после этого становится активной раушка, клик по которой переводит на следующий уровень. В конце каждого акта нас ждет босс - магнитофон... Звучит это конечно все бредово, но играется здорово. Красочная инди графика, приятный саундтрек, интересные и простые ачивки, разнообразные уровни... Минусов и нет почти... Кроме немного кривоватого управления, но и к нему быстро привыкаешь. Игра на час и он точно не будет скучным. Рекомендую!

I understand games like Chaos Domain and A.R.E.S., games that have decent concepts botched horribly. It’s the ones like The Grandfather, where you can barely fathom why they exist at all. Crab Dub falls squarely into that category, a game whose story, art, gameplay, and entire concept are virtually impenetrable. There’s nothing fun or entertaining about any part of this game, specifically because the choices involved in producing it appear to run entirely counter to any sort of logical game design.

I’m not going to waste time rephrasing the story, so you can have it straight from the store page: “Deep deep down at the bottom of the ocean is where the evil Dr. Taco reigns. His biggest dream is to conquer the entire ocean. Together with his business partner, Mr. Rhino, they sponsor a high-tech project called «Crab Dub».” You are apparently part of this project, sent out to stop “Blue Cassette Player” so that Dr. Taco can rule unimpeded. When you start the game it takes you to an undersea screen where you choose one of three episodes to play, and then you click the right arrow to proceed. That takes you to a platform with your sea-snail looking crab on a pillar, with a selection of guns to the right and Mr. Rhino at a desk to the left. You pick your weapon of choice and then click the pillar to launch off in a rocket.

The first level has you on a tiny platform suspended in the ocean. If you jump off, like towards the one other platform just out of reach, you’ll plummet off the screen and end up in a void where your crab is sucking on a pacifier. The only way out is to hit Escape, restarting the level. It turns out what you’re supposed to do is CLICK on the blue octagon in each level, sometimes after clicking on inflating cats. You might have to do some floaty platforming on jellyfish or avoid toast launched from toasters to get there, depending on the level. You can shoot things with your huge, beefy gun but the only enemies I saw were smug squids.

Does any of this make a lick of fucking sense to you? Because it doesn’t to me, and I don’t really get how anyone puts together crap like this and calls it fun. Lots of games do the keyboard movement / mouse aiming thing but not on tiny one-screen levels like this, often with no enemies. There’s no indication what you should click on or what you should jump on or what you should shoot, leading to nothing but trial-and-error experimentation. The graphics have little stylistic distinction between solid objects, interactables, enemies, and background details. Nothing about this is good or interesting or well-designed, at all. I never expected to be so repulsed by such a modest, innocuous game, but I only spent 10 minutes playing it and I’m angry I wasted that much of my life.

Stilly, strange and arbitrary controls and objectives!

Pointless student project that does not belong on Steam!

These are the worst controls I have every played with!

Very obscure and not enjoyable...Arbitrary game play, even when you understand it!

Felt like a complete waste of time to me :(

Nothing fun involved in playing this game :(

Even for the HARDCORE, just NOT fun :(

Once you get past the obscurity, learn what needs to be done, there is so little to it :(

Crab Dub is about a lone crab going through three zones before fighting the very dangerous taco that you see on the zone select menu. Though, with a story obviously being apart of the game, instead of having random levels thrown in, nothing is really explained. Sure, there is a paragraph on the store page, but it is not given to us in any way in the game. So it just looks like a taco is weirdly placed on the level select screen and a rhino randomly smoking behind a desk when you do select a level.

So when you get into the game, you are met with three zones to select. Each having their own theme. The first zone will probably be the first one you play, and how confusing it is. Before you go into the game, you have to figure out how to actually get into it. Before you go into the first zone, specifically, you have a couple guns to choose from. Once you do that, there will be a button on the platform your crab is standing on, that when pushed, will let you start the level, instead of rather having a dedicated start button. 

This is when you realize, this is not just a platformer, but a mix between a platformer and a point and click. The game never tells you this, only telling you how to jump and move. With how the first level of the first zone looks, it certainly does not show this well as the platform that holds, from what the game’s achievements call it, a magic pill looks close enough to jump to it. Instead you just stay on the platform you started on and click it rather than trying to jump to it thinking the crab needs to pick it up. The next level does do better, with the new information that you need to click, this also shows that there are other objects you need to interact with before you can continue. The rest of the levels are designed as platformers, though there are two things that do come up in these levels. There is another object you need to activate before continuing, but it is not something you click, but something you need to stand on it. Next, there is no cooldown for taking damage. You can be on the same area as something that can hurt you for a small amount of time that it can kill you easily. With health being scarce in the first place, especially during the bosses, I don’t see it as a problem. But as it is now, it only makes this game unfair. There is a double jump, but sometimes it just does not work, which can cause you to die.

The second zone puts you on a rubber duck and dumps you into a cylinder with green liquid. Again, only telling you how to move, but having elements where you have to click objects to survive. Missiles coming in from the side need to be detonated before getting to you, no matter if the cylinder should be cracked before it gets to you, while light blue blocks will keep floating in the liquid if you don’t click on it. Lastly, there is an apple that will bounce off of the cylinder’s walls. Clicking it does nothing, and you will always be hit by it. So how can you make the apple disappear? By clicking the liquid you are floating on to hit the apple, which in turn will lower the liquid level till more is added periodically. The only thing this is missing other than a proper tutorial is checkpoints.

The third, and last, zone is in space. The crab on a dog which can jump infinitely, but be sure to not go past the sparkling border or you will die. This is basically the same as first zone as you need to click on the magic pill to continue. Unless there are other objects you need to click before clicking the magic pill to continue. With pink balls, one that you can click to move and one you can’t that keeps soaring past the screen, will hurt you.

Before each zone ends is a boss. The boss being the same boombox throughout each zone. Depending on the zone you are in, the method to defeating them is different. After depleting the boombox health to 0, a very...weird sequence happens with a gullotine.

With the Boss zone dealing with the taco that you see the whole time. Taking place in space, with a gun in your crabby claws, the boombox constantly going after you, the taco occasionally sending out a circle of bullets, and the pink balls sailing through space threatening you. But having one thing that is different, and does not communicate well. You shoot the magic pill instead of clicking it to continue on to the ending “To Be Continued” ending screen. 

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Crab Dub is certainly not the worst out there, but that certainly is not a qualifier for telling if a game is good or not. Perhaps if this was handled more rather than stopping at putting in three different levels, Crab Dub could have been better. If more care was put into making this more enjoyable, putting in more than one music track, and an implementation of the story and how to play other than how to move. In contrast, the visuals are pleasing to the eye that it would still hold up if everything else was improved on. If you are an achievement hunter, then you will find this your kind of game to gather more achievements.

옆과 위에서 날라오는 장애물을 톡 쳐서 파괴시키면서 올라가면 된다.
진짜 재미없다. 루즈함이 지나치다

3존은 갑자기 우주로 감. 
운석이라도 날라올 줄 알았더니, 그냥 돌조가리 피해서 도착점으로 가면 됨.
별사탕 같은게 날라오긴 한다.

보스가 제일 실망스러움. 
움직이지도 않는 게으름벵이 보스와 졸졸 쫓아오는 라디오만 나의 적이다.

It's not very long and unfortunately it's not very good either.

Zone 1 lets you choose a weapon before you start - once you do, you play a bunch of levels where your goal is to click the object at the end. You can click on some other objects like hearts/bubbles and sometimes you need to click on another object before you can finish. These levels are decent but the controls aren't that great - you need to be clicking in the middle of an object for it to count and the double jump can feel unresponsive.

The second zone was my favourite as it plays more like a shooter. You have to survive in a tube that slowly fills up and click blocks and missiles before they hit you. You can also click on the liquids to shoot apples, but this makes the liquid go down a little so you have to aim well. This zone is challenging but fair most of the time and the only thing that makes it annoying is there are no checkpoints.

Zone 3 is the same as Zone 1 but it's in space so you can jump infinitely and there are no weapons. Hooray? The game then just ends on a weird boss fight and it's over with a ""to be continued...""

Crab Dub definitely isn't the worst thing i've played but it's not that fun either. The presentation is mediocre, especially with the music being random and repeating on new levels/deaths.

[i]Ах, как хочется вернуться к миру восьми бит. Когда было все понятно, просто и неотразимо. Музыкальные мотивы западали в душу, ну а графика позволяла фантазировать и додумывать то, что не смогли реализовать разработчики по причине нехватки ресурсов. Чудесное было время. И многочисленные инди-разработчики считают точно так же, выдавая на суд людской свои творения, стилизованные под восемь бит. Да только они, в большинстве своем, не выстреливают. Причиной тому банальная жадность. Ведь большинство подобных разработчиков свято уверенно, что если вставит в свою игру раздражающую мелодию, блеклую графику и самое главное – завышенную сложность, то этого хватит для успеха. И наш сегодняшний гость – наглядный тому пример.[/i]

Безымянная улитка решает бросить вызов королю Тако, которому подчиняются три магнитофона, что распугивают местную флору и фауну. Естественно наш неторопливый герой идет сражаться со злодеями не с пустыми руками, а прихватив с собой пять абсолютно идентичных стволов, а также своих друзей – резиновую утку и надувного осла. Звучит как полный бред? Расслабьтесь, в играх на Дэнди встречалось и не такое, а потому к подобному сюжету даже можно отнестись как к должному. Другое дело – управление. И вот оно способно испортить вам настроение на дни вперед.

Дело в том, что управление не отзывчиво. Наша улитка наделена способностью двойного прыжка, который в любой другой игре сошел бы за одинарный, но при этом вы не всегда сможете прыгнуть дважды. Чаще всего будете улетать в пропасть в попытке это сделать. Следующая проблема, так называемый, «эффект скольжения», когда вы отпускаете кнопку движения, а герой делает шаг или два. Не поймите меня неправильно, мне нравится подобная механика в других играх, но не здесь. А все потому, что платформы в этой игре очень маленькие и потому необходима ювелирная точность прыжка, дабы не улететь в пропасть и не начинать уровень сначала. Масла в огонь подливают медузы, встречающиеся в первом мире и которых необходимо использовать как батут. Использовать-то их можно, но дело в том, что прыгнув на них, медуза резко опускается и если вы не смогли с первого раза использовать комбинацию платформа+медуза+медуза+платформа, то поздравляю – начинайте уровень заново. Не то чтобы в этой игре было много уровней, их скорей мало, тут все дело в искусственном усложнении этапов, а подобное является синонимом халтуры. И последнее, но не по значению. Обычно в играх платформерах получив урон управляемый персонаж начинает мигать, что дает ему кратковременное бессмертие, в этой игре ничего подобного нет. Получив одну единицу урона, вы можете мигом получить следующую, отчего гейм овер наступает очень быстро. И тут же задаешься вопросом – а зачем в игре три сердечка? Разве что для красоты.

Музыка, также не радует и после пятой минуты игры уже хочется выключить этот раздражающий мотивчик. Проблема в том, что подобное в игре не предусмотренно, так что либо отключай колонки, либо терпи до победного конца.

И не то чтобы игра ну совсем уж плохая. Мне честно понравился второй мир с колбой, где надо уничтожать ящики, ракеты и яблоки. Не то чтобы я выдержал подряд два подобных уровня, но это отлично разнообразило геймплей. Да и сражение с последним боссом интересно, с инвентированным-то управлением, которое в памяти вызывает ассоциации с чудеснейшей «Beyond Good and Evil». Но неудобное управление вкупе с музыкальным сопровождением ставят крест на интересных игровых моментах, а потому я советую обходить эту игру стороной.

Глядя на обзоры и сопоставляя увиденное в игре, мой мозг отказывается верить, что у игры столько положительных отзывов. Это самый настоящий несортовой продукт.
Никаких введений в курс дела: управление и история. Зачем?! Когда есть описание на странице в магазине, зачем делать нормальное меню, приемлемую графику с интересной рисовкой, разнообразный саундтрек?! Делаем 3 зоны: океан, блендер и космос, где в 1 и 3 нужно найти котят и перейти на следующий уровень, а во 2 продержаться против кубиков льда и яблок.
Игра хоть и короткая, но выжимает все соки своей сложностью, её увеличивали искусственно: отсутствие плавности в управлении, наваливание всевозможных препятствий и врагов – классика, также стоит добавить несоответствие размеров текстур и реального размера каких-либо объектов, созданных с целью навредить нам. Простой пример: яблоко ещё не попало по улитке, а здоровье теряется.

Crab Dub is a nice game for the price, it has some imaginative points and some difficult pieces. I really enjoyed that the first level was one of the most difficult, yet it forced you to learn perfect timing for your double jump so you wouldn't have (as much) trouble going into later levels.

ユーモラスなドット絵が特徴で、3つのゲームモードで構成されており3つのうちどれからでもスタートできる。3つ全てをクリアするとボス戦となる。ゲーム性は「死に覚え」ゲームであり、何度も死んで覚えることが必要だ。

[Zone I]
2段ジャンプアクションゲームで、スイッチを押して宝石のようなオブジェクトをアクティベートすると先に進めるというものだ。非常に分かりにくいかもしれないが、クリックすると膨らんで宙に浮かぶ犬みたいなのがスイッチとなっている。スイッチはマップの隅にあることが多い。

[Zone II]
上から降ってくるブロックと左右から飛んでくるミサイルをクリックで消すか左右に移動して避けるゲームだ。上から降ってくるリンゴは、足元の緑の液体をクリックすると弾を発射して撃ち落とすことができる。緑の液体は弾を発射すると減ってしまうが、上から降ってくる緑の雫で徐々に増えていく。緑の液体が増えて最上部まで行くとクリアとなる。

[Zone III]
多段ジャンプで移動していく「バルーンファイト」のような操作感のゲームで、""Zone I""と同様にスイッチを押して宝石みたいなオブジェクトをアクティベートして先に進んでいくものだ。

このゲームの悪いところは説明不足なところだ。左右移動とジャンプの操作説明はあるものの肝心のゲームのルールなどの説明がなく非常に分かりにくい。初回プレイでは何をすればいいのか全く分からないままプレイを終えてしまうことがあるかもしれない。ゲームを理解すると楽しめるが、ゲーム性が死んで覚えるタイプのゲームなのでストレスを感じやすい。低価格とはいえ、あえてこのゲームを買う価値があるかというと微妙だと思う。",1487258015,1487258344,False,2,0,0.556319057941436768,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 [*]Действительно приятная картинка.Глаза не режет,тона подобраны великолепно.Для счастья более и не нужно.

 [*]Хороший лвл дизайн.

 [*]Приятная анимация.

 [*]Разнообразие механик.

 [*]Сложность.Ну ёпрст,смотришь на всё это,так мило,приятно и всё в таком духе.Хочется буквально наслаждаться,но вместо этого ты умираешь.Обидапечаль.

 [*]Отсутствие нативной поддержки пада.Безусловно можно всё настроить сторонним софтом,как это делаю я,но гораздо приятнее когда всё работает ""из коробки"".

Главный герой – краб-киборг. Почему-то мне он больше напоминает улитку. Его задача помочь покорить океан своему создателю. Мы должны уничтожить «Синий Магнитофон» и всех, кто против нашего хозяина. В этой игре мы играем за плохишей!
Нам надо отчистить три зоны от непокорных жителей. Это Океан, Космос и Блендер! Причем «Блендер» в буквальном смысле. Эта зона – огромный миксер!
Игра хардкорная. Прыгать и умирать тут придется многократно. Самое неприятное то, что непонятно куда прыгать. Пока это выяснишь несколько раз свалишься в пропасть. Иной раз даже не разглядеть.  Было бы неплохо, если бы в игре сделали стрелки, которые показывали нужное направление.
Необычная игра со стильной графикой, симпатичными персонажами и сказочным сюжетом. Взял в коллекцию не задумываясь, тем более по такой цене.",1484862066,1484862066,True,32,0,0.743191003799438477,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Seems like 3 mini-games that happen to share art. Plenty of games do that and are still popular so where this one really fails is just simple game design. The first level isn't an introduction! If your game is going to be this strange the player needs a little help to start. It's a shame really because it feels like there is talent here.
