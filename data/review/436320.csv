Pourquoi ?

Déjà il n'a pas reçu de mise à jour depuis 2018, ce qui sous-entend d'après moi que le développement a été arrêté.
Ensuite, pour parler du contenu :
- Le jeu propose 10 missions avec une histoire.
- 4 personnages jouables avec des armes et des compétences différentes.
- Un mode Solo, coop 2 joueurs, et PVP.
Un jeu simple mais mine de rien assez complet. Pourquoi aussi peu alors ?

Parce qu'il coûte plus cher que quasiment n'importe quel autre jeu VR connu (exception faite pour Half Life: Alyx mais c'est Half Life bordel !). 38€ pour ça, ça aurait pu passer si tout était bien. Sauf que non.

Le tracking des grips n'est vraiment pas au point. Je n'arrive même pas à attraper mes armes par moment. Le support gaucher qui, comme sur 80% des jeux, n'est fait qu'à moitié. Un gaucher ça tient l'arc avec sa main gauche, en fait, donc il doit être sur sa hanche gauche. Pas droite.
Niveau gameplay c'est plutôt plat. On passe notre temps à se battre contre des robots de différents types. Mention spéciale aux 2 ou 3 niveaux qui apportent quand même du gameplay un peu plus varié avec une courte séquence de puzzle, de l'exploration ou un combat de boss.
Enfin, dernier truc dommage : pas de sous titre, et le jeu est entièrement en anglais, donc ça inclut de savoir parler anglais. Heureusement, c'est quand même relativement audible.

Alors pourquoi je le recommande alors ?

Le système de personnage est relativement bien fait et le système de compétence permet de diversifier nos attaques. Le concept des tourelles est vachement cool aussi.
L'histoire en elle-même, bien que courte, reste prenante et intéressante.
Même si on passe notre temps à se battre, ça en vaut quand même le coup parce qu'on a pas trop cette sensation de répétition. Les environnements et les ennemis sont variés.
Enfin, mais c'est une histoire personnelle, j'ai eu des fous rires sur le jeu avec un ami. D'ailleurs, je recommande vraiment d'y jouer avec un ami plutôt que seul.

En conclusion, le jeu est excellent pour découvrir la VR et reste intéressant malgré son prix beaucoup trop élevé à mon goût et ses petits défauts qui au final relève plus du jeu en lui-même que de ses mécaniques.

Its a small detail but every loading screen and even the at the start of the game when you see the company logo just stinks of missed opportunity. The intro to the game (when you're loading into the menu) is fairly cool, with the company logo moving towards you in a sea of particles but its just a cutscene on a curved flat 2d plane. Its sigh inducing.

I write this with over 11,000 in virtual reality, the fundamental building blocks of this game are so out of data it makes it hard to play. For those of us who have moved over to using virtual desktop be warned that if you take your headset off that when the game audio switches to your PC speakers it won't switch back to your headset again. The games movement systems is designed for teleportation and, while it can be switched to walk, the walking system is slippy and generally unwieldy. I believe its possible to activate some sort of stick turn (allowing you to turn with use of the joystick rather than only by rotating yourself within your IRL environment), but it wouldn't appear on my iteration of the game. I'd like to make it clear this is not due to a lack of thoroughness on my part. I know an option to do this exist and I know from other players where it is located but somehow, some way, presumably due to my headset of choice (a Quest 2 connected to a PC via virtual desktop) the option is not in my menu ... but your guess is as good as mine on the cause, honestly. 

I cannot in truth comment on the game play. The game had several debilitating technical issue which culminate in game simply outputting a support ticket when I try to load it before me even getting to the game play. I'll try again at some point to actually get into a round of this and add an addendum to this review but for the time being I'd recommend against playing this if you've become too reliant the modern comforts of VR gaming, like smooth turn... or if you've become too reliant the modern comforts of gaming in general, like responsive controls and functioning software.",1672449395,1672449395,False,2,1,0.494409680366516113,0,False,False,False,True,,,

AI is bad but it's not that much of a problem, I mean all they have to do is destroy the core and hit your ass while doing that. The problem with mobs is that some of them might ""teleport"" around the map and here's where the shitshow begins.
Performance wise it was alright although graphics quality on some maps was very bad, no clue what is the reason behind that but it looked like devs felt lazy in the end. 

Would I recommend it? Nah. Don't fall into that trap of ""very positive"" reviews.

Дорога каждая секунда - а приходится и руку задействовать для телепортации, и осматриваться с неадекватным биндом стика, и от пуль уворачиваться СО ВСЕХ СТОРОН, и следить за ""батарейкой телепорта"" вместе с патронами, и т.д... Это КРАЙНЕ НЕПРОСТО.
3. В игре есть какие-то идиотские баги: тройку раз просто так проваливался посреди перестрелки сквозь пол и умирал; в игре за лучника спавнились некоторые враги со странными хитбоксами; враги могут парить в воздухе дальше какое-то время после отстрела им ног...
4. Барышня, кстати, действительно ОЧЕНЬ МНОГО ГОВОРИТ. Причём что-то прямо влияет на геймплей, отчего вынужден одним ухом фокусироваться на контекст болтовни. Это КРАЙНЕ НЕПРОСТО!
5. Я играл за пистолетчика, у него классные способности и удобная стрельба, но как пройти все миссии за других героев, я даже не представляю. От одной миссии за лучника я уже устал - и это ещё при учёте, что с его лука не все ваншотятся, зато при этом в меня со всех сторон куча урона продолжает лететь, как при Бишопе!
6. Механика с лазерами - говно. Вот так прямолинейно и просто. Бесило при каждом появлении, и была основной причиной подыхания из всех смертей в боях.

Half of the game feels very polished, but the other half feels like playing a beta game that is not  ready to be released.

-Very repetitive
-Some classes are kinda glitchy, using the sword would feel badass but it doesn't hit enemies half the time
-The controls are pretty clunky, tons of mis-grabs, accidentally holstering your weapon or grabbing it when you don't mean to, Even after customizing the bindings and grip strength it doesn't feel natural. Walking vs teleporting doesn't feel natural either.
-Hitboxes on player character are off (getting hit all the time by slow moving lasers after I moved out of the way, but it still hits me)
-The story is extremely generic, and they went for a Glados type robot making snarky comments all except it's just really annoying and he won't shut the fuck up. The character is genuinely unfunny and there are so many talking scenes in between levels, huge waste of time. If the writing was up to par it'd be fine, it just isn't. If you wanted to make a basic wave/shooter/tower defence type game you don't need to pretend it has a good story and deep characters. Just don't.
-The tutorials are very basic, if you have any gaming experience you can skip them - but then every time you start a new level you will be bugged by a screen 'warning' you that haven't finished the tutorials. Of which there are plenty. Just why.
-Why is it that every time you start the game you have to accept a EULA, click through several setup screens before even getting to the game?
-Speaking about menus, pausing the game required you to press B, then aim your right hand and click on a button that says 'pause', which opens another menu. Why? Then if you want to unpause, you click on resume game, and the other menu you opened on your left hand is still there, which you have to click away while the game is already running and you are probably being attacked while you can't use either hand for a few seconds. I know it's minor but it's things like this that make the game a pain in the ass.
-The hands are not oriented properly for the Valve Index controllers - when I hold the controller straight in front of me, as if aiming a gun, in this game the gun would be at an angle about 10-15 degrees off. And there's no way to adjust this.

At least, I assume that is the reasons for some of the rather weird default controls and game options. 

The ""in-game hints"" and the tightly-restricted ""Playspace"" and are both extremely intrusive and detrimental to your initial game-play experience. Fortunately they can be disabled, but they still leave a rather bad first impression of the game. The game definitely would have benefited from an initial ""how would you like to play this game"" setup part. 

Locomotion is OK, but the ""teleshift"" (teleport) mode will often fail and then refuse to work for a bit. And moving around (in campaign) is frustratingly slow. Sure, I'm in a gun-fight with a dozen killer robots, but let me just casually walk from here to there. 

I could almost never get the ""Ultimate"" ability to work using the thumbstick, but at least it is possible to use X (or A) button instead. Too bad that wasn't part of the tutorial. 

Speaking of, the tutorial was just using the standard ""game hints"" to purvey information, which is sometimes a little on the short side, especially when the language used isn't always clear. Just leave the hints in a pop-up window to the side or something, where I can read it without it being too much in my way. Or maybe have a tablet or something that I can pull up with the game hints.

With all that critique aside, the basic game-play is rather fun, and I got the game for just €1.50 in a bundle, so for that price, I think it is worth it.

Each level has 5 stages to it. You'll learn about turrets, which can be placed anywhere within the arena and which initially seem pointless - why not shoot all the robots with your guns? By level 3 you soon learn that those turrets are absolutely needed, without them you'll die. Levels 3-10 are where the story and the action really get going.

The downside is its just another wave shooter that has fallen behind the times of modern VR.  VR four years later has made extreme leaps and bounds in presence, and Raw Data has not been updated to follow along. 

This game is not upgraded to feature full Index controller support and relies [i] heavily [/i] on teleport style movement to effectively dodge incoming fire, and the game is designed around this quick movement.  (teleportation should be the last mode of movement considered for games)   While smooth motion movement is an option, this translates poorly to index controllers.

There are no full body Inverse kinetics so there is a huge spatial disconnect from your real body to VR spacial awareness.  This also means there is no option to utilize full body tracking for a more immersive experience or a more realize hitbox.  (you will clearly sidestep or turn to narrowly let a projectile sweep by only to still be hit because your hitbox is a large bubble around your HMD.

But after my latest session with my friend I decided on the latter.

I do absolutely love some of this games mechanics, one big one being that you unlock more abilities as you play, and my favorie class, where you are able to throw your laser-like sword as a boomerang that you are partly able to control the trajectory of mid flight. I think it can be extremely fun to play, play, throwing around a sword looking cool as hell.

But on the other hand, this game is so. incredibly. fucking. glitchy..! I can't get through a level without at the very least experiancing some jankyness. In some times game breaking. For the sword class, some of my difficulties are:
It can be extremely hard to grab your sword holstered from your shoulder sometimes.
I constantly drop my sword all the time so that it just falls on the ground, despite barely gripping my controllers (index controllers).
throwing the sword sometimes seems to have bad collision with enemies.

One huge glitch that I have seen happen twice is (unlocked ability spoiler, although the ability isn't super interesting/unexpected)  [spoiler] After unlocking the ability which gives me two swords to weild, mid game one of the swords just suddenly dissapears and it never respawns on my shoulder, meaning that I have to play the entire level (which can last to 20-30 minutes) with only one sword. This same glitch happened to my friiend that played  [b] a different class! [/b][/spoiler] 

There are more glitches that appear, but they are more so just small annoyances that appear, which can vary largely, so I can't really remember them as of now. But I am still aware of how incredibly janky this game can be.

Some of the glitches, like constantly dropping your weapons, is beacuse I usee index controllers, which are apparently seen as really bad for this game (which I can definitely get), so if you dont want absolutely garbage controlls, you have to make/download custom ones from steam. And even so you will most likely still experiance glitches related to the controlls. There are a thousand glitches that I failed to mention here tho, and most of them probably arent specific to the index...

There are also a bunch of questionable design choises. A small one that I can think of right now is this, it doesn't really impact anything, but more so a ""what the fuck were they thinking??"" thing: In the lobby there is an object that is completely made up out of 90 degree angles. But for some ungodly reason they decided to make a LOD model of it with a bunch of random angles, like they just said ""oh lets just slap a decimate modifier and collapse a bunch of vertecies randomly, that will look alright!"", and it looks so incedibly ugly. I don't even see a point in adding an LOD for an object like that, at least not one that is so incedibly obvious to see... This paragraph almost looks the longest of all of them, and it's about the most unimportant thing ever... whatever...

I want to enjoy playing this game so incedibly much. I absolutely adore most of the mechanics, and the story is really interesting. But the fuck ton of glitches I encounter constantly makes it extremely frustating to play and I can basically never play this game with my friend without at least once getting noticably pissed off at the game doing unintended stuff. And I would regard myself as a person who very rarely gets frustated at games.... when they work correctly that is...

so in conclusion, would I reccomend this game? I honestly don't know. If you use index controllers, that decreases the chanse I would reccomend it quite alot. Apparently my friend says that most of the issues (that are controller related) arent experianced by him since he has different controllers. But even if that is the case, the game is still incedibly glitchy at times. If you like action, and don't mind being completely fucked by super unfair glitches. Then I think I would reccomend this game. Otherwise I think I wouldn't.

ok so full disclosure, this game is decent, and it was actually able to hold my attention for a while, but i eventually gave up halfway through the game, it was just too meta for me
to describe it briefly, this game is a tower defence/wave shooter where you take down hoards of enemies while protecting a data core from getting destroyed. its a bit like robo recall in a sense bun instead of moving through a course you stal in one space the entire level. the game has 4 main weapon types, the pistol, the sword, the shotgun, and the bow. each weapon has varying play styles so let me describe them all:
the pistol is probably the most versatile weapon of the 4, its effective at any range and even has a ""charge"" ability to shoot high powered shots. one of the things i liked about the games mechanics is how shooting specific parts of the robots can actually remove those body parts, for example if you shoot them in the arms, they wont have an arm to shoot with, if you shoot them in the legs, they will have to crawl to you. its a fairly decent weapon and it can usually get any job done
the shotgun is like how shotguns are in most games unfortunately, extremely effective at close range, and trash at long range. it does have a rocket launcher ability which is also useful for taking out mechs, but overall its just kinda a difficult weapon to use
the sword is definitely the most sweat inducing weapon of them all, since youre going to be swinging it around A LOT, being a melee weapon its not very effective against drones, but it does have a difficult to use throwing ability where it comes back like a boomerang. my main issue was that it never really felt life you were using a ""sword"" in the game since killing enemies never results in a clean cut, they just fall to the ground while whatever body part you hit falls off at the joint regardless of where on that part you actually cut, also its extremely ineffective against mechs
finally theres the bow, but i didnt play the game long enough to use the bow so lets move on
the game can get pretty repetitive after a while, all you do is stay in one map the whole level and protect a data core from robots. personally i would have preferred it if there were a few levels where you actually moved through a level trying to get to a goal, murdering robots as you go, but unfortunately theres only 1 play style to this game, and it gets old real fast. also this game has a multiplayer PVP function, but its playerbase is long dead so thats a huge chunk of the game you simply cant play. theres no real penalty for dying, all that happens when you die is you have to wait about 3 seconds, then you respawn. the only downside is that you wont be able to protect your data core in that time but trust me, it has plenty of health, youll be fine. the only positives i can think of with this game is that it has some pretty good graphics and voice acting, and it is pretty fun before it goes on too long

Würde eher einen Daumen in der Mitte geben. Das Spiel ist mittlerweile technisch veraltet und von Diversen VR-Konzepten überholt. Beispielsweise gibt es ausschließlich Teleportationsbewegung und die Griffmechanik der Indexcontroller wird auch nicht unterstützt (ist nur eine Alternativbelegung zu einem Knopfdruck). Das Halten von Waffen ist damit auch ein ziemlicher Krampf, da dies vom Spiel eigentlich nicht vorgesehen ist und stattdessen eine Halten/Wegstecken auf Knopfdruck Steuerung gewählt wurde.
Das schadet der Immersion auf jeden Fall ungemein, daher habe ich es trotzdem mit der Griffmechanik gespielt. Das führt allerdings dazu das man zwischendurch ausversehen die Waffe fallen lässt. Ein wenig nervig, dafür aber eine extra Herausforderung in dem ansonsten doch recht leichten Spiel. 
Von der Technik und dem Schwierigkeitsgrad abgesehen bekommt man allerdings ein gutes VR Spiel geboten. Alleine dafür, 
 dass man mit Lichtschwertern kämpfen kann, was direkt ein Jedi-Feeling aufkommen lässt, lohnt sich der Kauf bereits. Vollpreis ist allerdings zu hoch angesetzt, da wie erwähnt technisch veraltet.",1618932977,1618932977,True,1,0,0.51171875,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

How far did I get? The first missions, multiple times the first mission.
The problem was the first two times I ran it the game broke. Once, it just crashed, gotta say a crash in VR is not a fun experience when your view goes all wonky, that can be a quick trip to vomit town if you don't pull it off quick and go alt f4 on the computer.
And the other time one of the enemies had a rather... odd problem. He got stuck to my camera, as in attached to it. So he'd be crouching behind cover, but if I look to the left a bit he maintains the same relative location in my view, so he's no longer behind the cover, problem was he could still shoot at me, but my attacks would just go through him. I spent awhile shoot at all cover spots thinking he was actually still in one (or his collisions at least) but no luck. I tried walk to the edge of the room and turning my head so he'd be hopefully far enough outside the level to unload, or down on the floor I lay turning my head sideways, in the end coudn't kill him so I had to quit and restart that time.

So ya, it wasn't a great start. The core gameplay also wasn't... bad, but definitely had a few issues with movement, and some of the enemies methods of fighting or taking damage and reacting and stuff didn't feel the most intuitive or stuff, so while I felt like it'd be worth killing some time trying to play it a bit more if it ran well, with it not working well two out of three tries it just started feeling like a waste of time and after that session I haven't really gone back to play it anymore. But my core argument that this game is not reliable or bug free by any means does stand, so I can't recommend it to people since it might just not work or waste your time. If it does work, it might be an ok game, but probably not a great one or anything.

It has 4 characters each with it's own weapon and special abilities and those abilities are unlocked one at a time to give you a good sense of progress. All the characters will be able to build turrets but the 4 turrets available are not that great and only offer a slight tactical advantage (that you will probably need on the harder difficulties).
There is no custom load outs to speak of and you can only choose from a couple of skis for each weapon BUT the 4 characters feel very different:
1. Pistol shooting character with reload mechanics that left a little to be desired (you draw a new clip from the unlimited stash on your waist and then just move it near the clip in the pistol and the rest is automatic).  I would have liked a button to eject the old clip but after you upgrade him the reload will be done by moving the pistol to the hip so that did not matter too much.
2. Shotgun having character - just what you would expect: a lot of damage closeup and pretty big spread of pellets at a distance with options to shoot grenades ... he feels like the brawler of the pack.
3. Archer - nice bow mechanics with nice special abilities like charged arrow, multi-arrow ,etc.
4. Blade wielding jedy woman - a sword that can reflect bullets and nice telekinetic powers that make you fell like a jedy badass.

The graphix are very nice and the sound are good with only some improvement needed imo when activating voice logs that just play over the dialog that is having place but you can pause or replay them so its not too bad.

The campaign is about 5-6h but you can replay on a harder difficulty and play missions coop (2 players). There is even a PvP but I did not manage to find anybody to play.

It looks great, and I would have really liked it even if it wasn't VR. I played it with an Oculus Quest 2, trying with both the Oculus Link and Virtual Desktop. Since it is an earlier VR game, you can play it on budget hardware (1650/970/1650 Super) but be aware that you might need to lower the graphical settings for better framerates. Even on the lower settings though, the visuals are pretty dang impressive and the environments give a peek into the potentials that VR has for game immersion.

What is more, the gameplay, in my opinion, feels tight and fluid. It is an FPS tower defence game where there are multiple 
classes to chose from. I personally picked the cyborg ninja who does not carry a gun but has a laser katana which decimates small enemies in a single swing, and large enemies in several quick swings. Honestly, I had so much fun playing as the cyborg ninja, and at one point, I forgot I had to repair my turrets because I was so into the sword play.

The story and dialogue is also pretty interesting. The voice acting is better than that of most AAA titles (though that's not a very high bar, sorry not sorry), and as a fan of cyberpunk settings, I have so far really enjoyed how the information relevant to the story was gathered. I also chuckled whenever the voice in your head (forgot her name) argued with Simon (your robot assistant/companion). 

So why am I giving a review of the game so early? Well, it is an early VR title, and it shows. I know it might be my fault that I chose to play as the melee focused cyborg ninja, but I personally felt pretty tired and dizzy after every single level. If they were shorter, I wouldn't have minded that much. However, they often feel like they drag on forever, and the levels are relatively large. So turning around to teleport all over the place felt very disorientating. Speaking of levels, I don't think they are very well designed, and as much as I found it fun to hack and slash all over the place, I often got really frustrated when I had multiple large enemies coming at me from different directions, all the while swarms of small robots came running from other corridors. 

Needless to say, I got the game from Humble Bundle and I'd say it was worth the price I paid for it. That being said, I would personally pay a maximum of £15 ($20), and not a penny more. It's not that it's a bad game (as I stated), it's just that you can do much better at £30 which is just way too much for an early VR title. I recommend getting the game if you find it on sale but never at full price (unless you have someone to play with).",1607273185,1607273185,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TL:DR: Lack of comfort features such as turning, Knuckles controllers hardly work and make it a hassle to play, had to restart game multiple times to have coop to work, some characters are hard to use because of the controller bindings. Avoid buying game for £29.99 not worth.

The game has some serious flaws on the Index controllers suck as movement being binded to the touch pad and the pressure sensitivity being all wonky. I did try out a custom key binding for it but it still wasn't perfect. The hand position was lower than my actual hands. Made interactions clunky and un-enjoyable. This game doesn't feature any kind of player rotation instead forcing you to spin on the spot, every game in 2020 should have this option by now. The movement itself feels like I'm on ice, having a small amount of acceleration and deacceleration makes it semi nauseous. Some of the characters were just un-fun to use and a hassle to actually use, the katana person is able to throw their sword but on the Index it's always a 50/50 chance of it happening. The bow and arrow angle is all off making you hip fire it in order to actually shoot it straight.

But then expectations were lower, the tech was weaker, and I wanted to know if it lives up to spec on the Valve Index. 

It doesn't. And especially not for £30 which is honestly a joke. 

I won't spend much time on this one as ultimately I won't recommend it, but quick takeaways are:

Whilst the gameplay loop is fun and at the start quite engaging, it burns out very quickly. There's not a great deal of variation in the enemies and most problems and be solved by waving a sharp stick at them very quickly. The companion narration is well executed in terms of voice acting quality, though the content leaves a lot to be desired. The story is a sneeze in the wind, gone before it can leave a trace.

Combat is varied on the surface but ultimately gets very boring very quickly. Guns have very little feel to them, the sword uses Skryim physics so short fast waves will ruin everything, but the bow and arrow is good fun. Enemies don't feel rewarding to defeat but have some nice effects when destroyed. 

The environments are very pretty and rather varied, however very forgettable and, apart from being pretty, lack functionality that sets them apart from each other in a gameplay fashion. 

There is essentially no support for the Index controllers and this makes it a nightmare to play. Do not get this if you have an Index, unless it's literally free and even then you'll have to suffer a bit.

My final takeaway is this; this game is fun-ish if you can look past the flaws. And there were no other games out there that did the exact same things but better. And it wasn't thirty damn pounds sterling.",1605196084,1605196084,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Zastanawiałem się długo i miałem dać 9/10, ale daje 10/10. Gra jest niesamowita.

Mamy do dyspozycji 10 stosunkowo dużych poziomów (czas przejścia). Z których każdy dzieli się na pięć części, dzięki czemu można złapać oddech. Poziomy są mocno zróżnicowane, choć pierwsze dwa mogą zniechęcić.

Podobnie sytuacja wygląda z bohaterami. Mamy do wyboru czterech całkowicie odmiennych bohaterów. Każdy dysponuje sześcioma umiejętnościami, które odblokowywujemy za przejście poziomu. Czyli odblokowanie wszystkich umiejętności dla wszystkich postaci to 24 poziomy gry. Każdy bohater jest fajny i oferuje odmienny sposób rozgrywki. I tutaj tak samo, bez odblokowanych umiejętności potrafią zniechęcić.

Osobiście polecam wybranie teleportu jako sposobu poruszania się.

Przewodnik w naszej kwaterze głównej. Wykonanie wszystkich zadań przewodnika, ułatwi zrozumienie gry. I tutaj tradycyjnie, ...gra potrafi zniechęcić, jeżeli tego  nie zrobimy. Dodatkowo tutaj właśnie, warto przetestować sobie na spokojnie każdą odblokowaną umiejętność. Sterowanie, jest bardzo dobre, jest rozbudowane i wygodne. Ale ...potrafi zniechęcić, jeżeli nie przeczytamy co do czego i jak.

Watek fabularny jest rozbudowany, dodatkowo zbierając po pięć ""dżingli"" z każdego poziomu. Odblokowywujemy interesujące ścieżki audio, listy i opisy które to otwierają szerzej historię.

Poziomy trudności są dobrze dobrane, grając samemu na normal, jest normalnie. Na hard jest trudno, a na nightmar koszmarnie. Granie w dwójkę zdecydowanie ułatwia rozgrywkę. Przeszedłem grę sam na normal później na hard i da się. Na tę chwilę przeszedłem sam jeden poziom na nightmar (jeden próbowałem). Nie gra w nią na dzisiaj wielu ludzi, ale da się zagrać online jeżeli się chce.

Grę gorąco polecam. Uważam, że przebija wiele znanych i popularnych tytułów. Większość z mojej biblioteki, i inne w które grałem a nie posiadam, w tym te uważane za topowe. Przekleństwem gry jest według mnie to jak gra się zaczyna. Ciężko się odnaleźć, a postacie nie wydają się być interesujące. Po trofeach widzę, że mało kto dał grze szansę, a naprawdę warto.

Tak jak pisałem w mojej opinii to 10/10. Polecam.


I've been wondering for a long time and I've had to give 9/10, but I'll give it 10/10. The game is amazing.

We have at our disposal 10 relatively large levels (transition time). Each of which is divided into five parts, so you can catch your breath. Levels vary widely, although the first two can discourage.

The situation is similar with the heroes. We have four completely different heroes to choose from. Each has six skills that we unlock for level transitions. That is, unlocking all skills for all characters is 24 levels of the game. Each hero is cool and offers a different way of playing. And here, in the same way, without unlocked skills, they can discourage.

I personally recommend choosing a teleport as a way of moving.

A guide at our headquarters. Completing all the tasks of the guide will make it easier to understand the game. And here traditionally, ... the game can discourage you if you don't. In addition, here it is worth to test yourself quietly each unlocked skill. The control, it is very good, it is extensive and convenient. But... can discourage if we do not read what and how.

The story is expanded, additionally collecting five ""jingles"" from each level. We unlock interesting audio tracks, lists and descriptions that open the story more widely.

Difficulty levels are well chosen, playing alone on normal, is normal. On hard it is difficult, and on the nightmar nightmar horribly. Playing with someone in two makes it much easier to play. I went through the game alone to normal later on hard and it is possible. At this time I went through one level on nightmar (one I tried myself without the other person). It's not played by many people today, but you can play online if you want.

I highly recommend the game. I believe it is better than many well-known and popular titles. Most of my library, and others that I played and do not have, including those considered top. The curse of the game, in my opinion, is how the game begins. It's hard to get started, and the characters don't seem to be interesting. Watching the trophies I see that few people gave the game a chance, and it is really worth it.

There are four heros, each with six unlockable abilities. You can unlock all 6 abilities by playing and finding all of the collectables on the first five levels for each character. The shotgun felt a bit weird to me, but might just be me.

Raw Data is a fun game with questionable UI design choices.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Okay, I can only play this game in short bursts because, while it is fun, it doesn't really do a good job of mitigating motion sickness or accounting for small playspaces. Below is a list of gripes, followed by a list of things I think the game does well.

[h2]Gripes[/h2]
[list]
[*]Many of the UI elements are stuck to your face so you have to utilize your glance to to read text on the edges of the lenses. 
[*]Hints and titles often sit in the middle of your vision and block the action
[*]As someone who gets easily motion sick, limiting and flat out disabling the teleport [i]at all[/i] is borderline unacceptable. This is only exacerbated by a small playspace.
[*]Game elements are often placed outside of my playspace so I can't reach mission critical elements, and the teleport ability can only get so close to map geometry. I'm sure you can imagine how frustrating this is.
[*]The sword, while it is the most fun in my opinion, is very difficult to use because it has to be swung pretty fast to do any noticeable damage. It will probably do more damage to your real life walls than anything in the game if you have a small playspace like me.
[*]The pistol is not quite aligned with the Oculus Touch controller and feels like I have to slightly turn my wrists outward to line up the sights
[*]The player characters' arms feel like their shoulders sit higher than normal, which is weird since I often have the opposite problem being 6'2"" (188 cm)
[/list]

[h2]Things the game does well[/h2]
[list]
[*]The game looks good.
[*]The game sounds good.
[*]The pistol and bow feel good to use and like they reward skillful play.
[*]Most enemies react satisfyingly to being hit.
[*]There's an actual story with solid voice acting and dialogue.
[*]Feels good to unlock stuff and try it put immediately between every mission.
[/list]

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
This game is great, especially with friends, if you can tolerate weird UI design choices and a little motion sickness. I have to play it in short bursts because of all the weirdness, but honestly that's okay, since my pudgy body tends to poop out around the same time I get sick or frustrated with things being outside my playspace.",1592790952,1592790952,True,15,0,0.672080159187316895,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cons:
- no climbing
- only 4 weapons instead of 10-20
- no weapon customisibility
- no interesting combat senarios. it is all just teleport around a shoot stuff, and there is little use for stratagy.
- the guns just ""feel"" bad, i think it is because all the guns don't realy have any knockback or reason to not spam fire
- you only really stay in one room, you don't move through ineresting terrain with large battles

More a base tower defense game than a FPS,  it is hard to apprehend at the beginning you have to let go your frustration from the confusing start especially if like me you bought the game a while ago and did not really knew what to expect from it.  

The levels are small rooms but big enough for you to move around and defend against waves of ennemies. There are 4 characters and each have their own weapon: pistol, shotgun, blade and bow. The range weapons are a bit approximative in their shooting mechanics, I should precise the pistols and the bow, so don't expect a super acute FPS experience but if you like strategy and Base Tower Defense games you'll love it, don't imagine soemthing completely terrible it's just that it's not purely FPS oriented. It reminds me of Sanctum 2 a bit.
The story is there but unremarkable however the graphics are nice, no screen tearing, the only thing that I really don't like are the messages appearing on top of my gun when I am aiming and shooting my targets. 
Overall it's good action with some moments of total panic. I play the campaign solo but there are people online and you can either play Co-op or PVP. Co-op is probably where it's at but I want to play solo on normal difficulty at least for my first character then I'll invite or get invited. There is an ignore option for the people spamming you to play with them. 

Once again, give the game some time for the first 30 minutes is poor experience you don't have double wielding or power ups or automatic towers etc yet, you get my point DO NOT JUDGE THIS GAME TOO QUICKLY.

В игре качественная графика, так что погружение тебе обеспечено и ты всегда будешь вспоминать фильм с Уилом Смитом! Тебе придется прятаться за укрытия, ты будешь трястись от страха и визжать от восторга! Здесь есть почти всё, что необходимо в шутере. На выбор будет 4 персонажа. И у каждого свои способности, которые ты по ходу игры можешь улучшать. У тебя будет возможность играть за лучника, будешь эффектно срывать у андройдов башни стрелами. Можешь играть здоровяком с дробовиком или бить роботов кулаками. Кстати к нему очень нужно долго привыкать и мне не очень понравился данный герой. Можешь почувствовать себя в шкуре ниндзя и шинковать противника катаной, также как и отбивать летящие на тебя пули. И быть обычным парнем с двумя пистолетами!

The game is still quite buggy and feels like the same old ""tech"" demo. The graphics and performance are a bit better, but not comparable with current AAA VR Games. If you want to play though all maps it takes about 5 hours which isn´t that much, compared to the price. The game is quite simple, just a room, with robots spawning around you.

About 20% of the time is just waiting and hearing some non skippable and boring dialogs. Everything feels quite slow.
We ended up, closing the whole game every time we finished a mission, to avoid those long dialogs and faster start the next mission.

One one mission my wife lost her ammo and couldn´t reload anymore, so we needed to start again. Things like those are quite frustrating, especially if you got used to newer coop shooters, which provide better quality, amount of content and less bugs. I shouldn´t have played it again, to keep my good old memories from the first time I did. Now it feels like watching a very old movie again, to see that it now sucks.

For one, grabbing weapons and objects is very unintuitive with the knuckles controllers, and it requires you to maintain a force grip the whole time you are holding the object unless you use the sticky pickup mode, which makes putting down the objects annoying. This pales in comparison to the bigger issue which is the movement. For some reason, there is no way to use the joystick for walking, and you can only use it for teleporting. which is incredibly difficult to use in combat and makes using two handed weapons almost impossible. If you want to walk normally, you are forced to use the small scroll wheel touchpad which makes moving sideways impossible, and along with this if you accidentally press a little too hard on the touchpad while you are trying to move it will open the teleport movement.

+ INTENS. Enemies come from everywhere. You can't hide! Also you have to move all the time to avoid getting punched and/or to dodge lasers
+ 4 classes with unique weapons and abilities. Surprisingly, I liked the shotgun guy the most for its melee. Punching robots in the head feels good. Very good.
+ Nice variety of enemies.
+ 10 maps. First two maps are similar, but the other maps are very different. I liked the map in particular where you have to duck/run around to dodge the lasers.
+ Graphics are well done (they look good even on low, which I'm playing on with my RX470).
+ Interesting story. It's quite funny how deep the story and universe is, considering you're in the same building most of the time. The dialogues between simon and ang3l are hilarious.
+ Good music, especially for a small game studio.

The Less Good
~ Sometimes the drone explosions are not visible (bug? maybe this is just the low graphics settings).
~ The crawling zombie robots sometimes get stuck on your body when they die on you, which seems to cause subsequent problems with movement.
~ One of the main characters aNg3L keeps telling you to hurry up, and even talks over recorded messages. which is so rude..
~ The tower defense aspect seems to be an afterthought. It's sometimes cumbersome to design a good cluster, because the map is not divided into tiles the size of a turret. Objects stand in the way. Sometimes the turret highlight is green and flickering (e.g. happens when trying to put a shield turret near the data core in some levels). Enemy has trouble shooting at the turret and vice versa when there's an obstacle between enemy and turret.
~ When you lose connection, even when playing single player, there will be a massive pop-up message that blocks your vision and the game doesn't stop. So you have to keep evading and killing robots as you clumsily close the message.
~ No endless mode. I think a survival mode with endless waves could give the game a lot of replay value.

Anyway, I've had a lot of fun with this game so far and I hope there will be a sequel that takes the story further, with perhaps a more fleshed out tower defense and more lasers (maybe a map with only lasers?)!!

This game definitely deserves an overwhelmingly positive rating. I was almost 10 hours into this game and I absolutely love the gameplay although I will start off by pointing out some of the things I think are flawed in this game and why it may have received mixed reviews.
1. Voice acting is very poor and some of the characters can be annoying during gameplay.
2. Tutorial system is not very good; I spent half the game fighting as the bow guy and I didn't know I could create a decoy as well as use another type of arrow which was stored on my back. I had to look up the game online to figure out I had a decoy and then I had to fiddle with the controls to figure out how to use the abilities. Let me save you the trouble: the bow guy's decoy can be activated by grabbing his right holster and pulling outwards and there's another type of arrow you can grab off his back. They teach you how to use all arrows, but I couldn't find a tutorial where they taught you how to use the decoy.
3. Some levels are recycled in the game with the addition of some extra areas which I found somewhat disappointing.

However, all in all; why I praise this game so much despite its flaws is just how fun all the game mechanics were - it was a blast playing as the bow guy and shooting down enemies, and even though some levels were recycled there was still variety in levels you'd see in the campaign. The campaign is also somewhat short (consisting of around 8 short levels) however I don't judge harshly on short games because that campaign was good quality and the community who play this game are also really nice and help each other out. There's so many sales for this game but I'd happily purchase it for full price and I'm the type of guy who doesn't leave reviews often.",1577663400,1577663400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Weapons randomly holster themselves or disappear altogether, abilities activate for seemingly no reason, and some abilities are so poorly implemented that there's simply no point in using them. The inability to look left and right with the right thumb stick is an understandable design choice, but feels like more of a chore than immersion. Lastly, the PvP is hilariously broken. It's just a race to see who hits who first and playing as the ranger makes his far too effortless.

Each weapon and ability, when working correctly, feel impactful and useful. Each enemy feels reasonable. Co-op is decent.

Die erste Veröffentlichung war 2016, seitdem ist viel passiert und das Spiel erschien bereits auf allen Plattformen. Es war damals eines der ersten Spiele mit größerem Umfang und fantastischer Grafik. Raw Data kam somit fast schon einem AAA-Titel nahe. Zu dieser Auffassung kann man aber auch heute noch kommen, wenn man es zuletzt 2016 gespielt hat, denn nicht nur grafisch wurde Raw Data hübscher, sondern unter anderem wurde auch die Storyline erweitert.

Raw Data bleibt aber immer der bekannte und wohl beste Wave-Shooter, der sich auf den Arenakampf konzentriert. Hier steht man allein oder in Gesellschaft gegenüber den anstürmenden Feinden und muss ihnen standhalten. Die Spieler können hinter Deckung verschwinden und sich über den Kampfplatz teleportieren oder auch frei Bewegen.

Es gibt vier wählbare Charaktere, jeder mit seinen eigenen Kampfstil, der jeweils hochgeskillt werden kann. Es gibt jede Menge verschiedener Waffen, sogar Bögen und Schwerter. Jede Arena kann in verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden gespielt werden und hat freischaltbare Inhalte die im Laufe der Kampagne gebraucht und benutzbar oder verfügbar werden.
Es gibt einen Einzel- und Koopmodus sowie Teamwettkämpfe aber auch 1vs1-Kämpfe sind in Raw Data möglich.

 Raw Data sieht technisch nach den Updates immer besser aus und funktioniert mittlerweile reibungslos. Das Spiel lässt sich trotz der hervorragenden Teleportationsbewegung auch wunderbar in flüssiger Bewegung spielen, wo bei die Richtung der Handbewegung folgt.

Raw Data ist immer noch einer der Vorzeige-Wave-Shooter in VR schlechthin. Eine tolle Einzelspielerkampagne, ein hervorragender Multiplayermodus und die Möglichkeit Koop zu spielen lässt diesen Titel wohl noch länger in den VR-Charts ganz oben stehen.

Wer es noch nicht hat, bei einem Sale bedenkenlos zugreifen.

------------------------------------------->
Is Raw Data from Survios getting on in years? The first release was in 2016, a lot has happened since then and the game has been released on all platforms. It was one of the first games to be released with a larger contend and fantastic graphics. Raw Data came very close to an AAA title. But you can still come to this conclusion today, if you played it last in 2016, because not only did Raw Data get prettier graphically, but among other things the storyline was extended.

But Raw Data will always remain the well known and probably best wave shooter, focusing on the arena fight. Here you stand alone or in company against the attacking enemies and have to resist them. The players can disappear behind cover and teleport across the battlefield or move freely.

There are four selectable characters, each with their own fighting style, each of which can be highly skilled. There are lots of different weapons, even bows and swords. Each arena can be played in different levels of difficulty and has unlockable content that can be used or become available during the campaign.
There is a single and co-op mode as well as team competitions but also 1vs1 fights are possible in Raw Data.

 Raw Data looks better and better after the updates and is now working smoothly. Despite the excellent teleportation movement, the game can be played in fluid motion, where the direction of hand movement follows.

Raw Data is still one of the showcase wave shooters in VR par excellence. A great single player campaign, an excellent multiplayer mode and the possibility to play co-op will keep this title at the top of the VR charts for a long time to come.

If you don't have it yet, take it without hesitation at a sale.

I must say, I love the setting and the story. It's very creative and enjoyable. However, the game feels quite repetitive, and by comparison, outdated. 

For example, the weapon mechanics are quite basic. The pistols reload by just moving them close to the holster, for example. The light sword thing is awesome, but feels weird and inconsistent. throwing it is very difficult, and using it up-close doesn't work lots of the time. 

Gameplay is fun, but too repetitive. it's baasically stand there and survive. If you die, you just respawn without any penalty, which removes the challenge too. 

In general, compared to games like H3VR, Raw Data feels archaic and repetitive, and to me fails to justify a price tag of $15, let alone a whopping $40.

In short, I have one, maybe two huge problems with this game.

There's too much fucking preamble. If I want to just get in game and kill some shit, it takes a short eternity.

The UI is non-obvious and not great for VR, it's a big step up from the absolute garbage they had for a UI during their first free weekend, but a step up from garbage to just bad isn't great.

The actual gameplay is OK. They never did a great job of handling some ways of cheesing enemies and it's kind of just another wave shooter, but you can move.

By VR standards, it's a decent game but they really didn't take advantage of the VR aspect at all, more like grudgingly worked around it.

 Yes new enemies get introduced, new weapons, and new maps, but its pretty much the same material, robots slowly walk towards you and you can slaughter them to your hearts content, if your trying to play the game seriously, good luck, the game is boring: the ai is terrible, causing enemies to miss you in insane ways, all melee besides the sword (which almost saved the game), is terrible making enemies be able to hit you, when you cant even hit it. Walking mode fixes this issue, but it is still a chore to do, and can be made up with a simple headshot from your pistol.

Multiplayer is non existent due to the replay value, some of the features are buggy or aren't player friendly, such as the holsters for Bishop's pistols, or the shotgun's slide which is so loose you can just move the gun pack with one hand and the slide moves back.

Overall: The combat is easy and boring, the gameplay makes everything feel cheaply made, and the 40$ price isn't worth it.

I would keep the game if it was 5-10$ but for now im refunding it, I would reccomend that you go check out Robo-Recall, its the same premise, without multiplayer, weapons that are all interactable and friendly towards the player, proper melee combat in the forms of punches, and whacks(not to mention doom styled dismemberment) based upon points instead of waves or other scenarios, so its less about beating a level, and more about getting the most score.

Давайте начнем со слов: «Потрясающе затягивающий!» Никогда еще не было такого гладкого и «отточенного» боевого опыта в виртуальной реальности, который позволял бы игроку владеть мечом или дуэльными пистолетами во время разрушения! Эта игра стоит каждого копейки, и я рекомендую ее всем с VIVE.

Не получается? Слишком «ленивый» или «занятый» тоже? Играйте за Сайджу, кибернетическую девочку-ниндзя, и потренируйтесь! Я могу с радостью признаться, что большинство моих тренировок закончилось благодаря этой игре. Если вы приложите много усилий и времени к этой игре, она может окупиться. Просто держите полотенце для рук и бутылку воды рядом и на расстоянии вытянутой руки! Он имеет встроенную голосовую связь, так что вы можете общаться с кем-либо, кого вы встречаете в кооперативе. при условии, что они говорят на языке, который ты понимаешь, лол.

Я должен признать, что игра может быть немного сложной для некоторых, и некоторые обзоры отражают это. Но если вы заядлый фпс, увлеченный оружием или мастер боевых искусств, как и я, вы получите удовольствие от этой игры! Сочетание кендо, немного ниндзюцу и даже тай-чи во время игры в роли Сайджи - прекрасная вещь (и смотрите, как мне говорят). Но вам не нужно знать, как правильно владеть мечом или огнестрельным оружием, чтобы отлично провести время в этой игре. Сообщество дружелюбное и услужливое, а разработчики активны на форумах и серьезно относятся к нашим отзывам. Несколько серьезных обновлений и изменений произошло из-за прямых запросов или жалоб от нас. Эта игра - лучший ""удар за доллар"", когда дело доходит до VR-боя.

Трейлер и скриншоты не подходят к этому. Вы просто должны играть в это, чтобы поверить в это. Для меня это обычное сотрудничество с «первым таймером» и слышать их крики и смех восторга, независимо от того, на каком языке они говорят, а также их кровавые крики убийства, когда они убиты или попали в засаду! Это само по себе стоит как минимум десять долларов! Преодоление уровней может действительно дать вам чувство выполненного долга, плюс, если у вас возникли проблемы, просто переключитесь на MP и разместите совпадение или найдите существующее. Каждый игрок, с которым я играл, в значительной степени был хорошим спортом и любителем игр.

С уважением

What it is: a wave shooter, with some story and even voice acting. You can gain a few skills/abilities and there are a few characters that you can play, each of which uses a different weapon (I think there are maybe 4-5 characters?). The weapons are all fun to try out. The sword is pretty fun too, but I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense when you're always fighting the same types of mobs that mostly all use ranged weapons. During each level, you fight a few waves of enemies, and you can move around a combat/play area to fight off these waves, and even build turrets to help you out. Overall, it's fun and it's also a bit of exercise, depending on how you play. 

The voice acting is pretty good, but the story itself isn't really that interesting to be honest (it's sort of generic - big evil corporation is doing bad things - let's go spy on them by uploading data on site while shooting waves of enemies) but I think it still adds a little bit of immersion to the game. 

Overall I haven't experienced any bugs in this game, and I can't say the same for all VR games that I have played, so points there.

The game is dead, buggy, doesnt feel like a AAA title, and it straight up isnt fun.

The first mission seems ok but on the second mission is were it goes downhill. I had to wait like 2 hours in total for people to join my co op game. And dont get me started on pvp, absolutely NO ONE plays it.

So lets say that no one plays this game making pvp and co op matchmaking nearly impossible,
how about solo?

Nope, this game is meant for multiplayer. Like solo is waaay to hard. The game tried to go for a tower defense route but you only get 2 towers per match, and they barely do anything as after the second mission everything is a bullet sponge. 

Not even the katana is fun! At first it looks cool and you get abilities, but the katana is just striking up and down waiting for a enemy to finally die.

Have I also mentioned how buggy it is? Mission 4 has you [spoiler] trying to defend a data core, but at the same time enemies spawn left far away, and right, even behind you and in the sky! The simple robots are trying to get to a reactor so you have to defend 2 reactors and if they get into 1, a huge bs robot will spawn that you have to put full focus on allowing the other robots to get to the other core and spawn another huge bs robot so that they can all hop on down to the data core and destroy it.Also good luck trying to kill the damn robots as a lot of them dissapear and become invincible after being hit. Especially in the atlas reactor [/spoiler]

Overall dont get this game, you will be waiting 2 hours for a match to join in co op and by the time you are in mission 2-4, you will realize how bad this game is, try to refund but youre over 2 hours so GG.",1543670855,1543670855,False,6,0,0.428971558809280396,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The production quality is ace. The robots are scary and the main controls work great. Combat is mostly fun.

However, it's a bit short for the full $39.99 price so I'd wait for a sale. I believe I got it half price and feel like it was a good deal.
Basically, a wave shooter but one of the better ones. There are four characters to play and each has a different weapon. Pistols, bow, katana or shotgun.  And of course, since it's VR the game play is quite a bit different with each character giving the game some replay value. Which is good because it only has 10 levels and three of those are the same level that you play three times. You unlock various skills for each character as you play through which again adds to the game play variety.
When I first started to play it was a bit frustrating as it starts in 'front facing' mode. And in that mode any time you get turned too far from the front it pops up a small window telling you to face the sensors, but it pops it up right on your gun sight (I played pistols first) so it blocks your view as you are trying to defend yourself. Very annoying and a bad choice of where to put the warning. There are also these huge arrows that point to the front that are really distracting too.
Fortunately, in the settings there is a 360 degree tracking option that eliminates those issues but of course you have to have 360 degree tracking. Frankly if I had to play it in front facing mode I probably would have refunded it but fortunately I didn't have to. My only other complaint is that some of the levels are far superior to others and on play through you'll notice that. If every level had the quality game play of levels 7 & 8 then this would be a $40 game. But they don't and as I mentioned you'll actual play the simplest level three times during the campaign so it’s only 8 distinct levels.
The graphics, sound and game mechanics are all very well done. None of the characters feel like they have an advantage over any of the others even though you have completely different weapons and powers which speaks to some pretty good game play balance. I haven't tried to play coop but there always seemed to be plenty of people to play with in the lobby so it's fairly popular.
So fun game but a bit short for $40 so wait for a sale.

They just sit there and gently pick away at the cannon fodder enemies whilst being boring and unsatisfying. With the way this game's actual shooting/slashing and movement mechanics worked, this would've been one of the best action-shooters VR has to date, so it's unfortunate that this VR title decided to pull back to being a lackluster tower-defense.

The voice acting was great too, it's too bad it was either interupted or cut short by 'WAVE 3 COMMENCING, TAKE COVER' or some other waste of air vibrations throughout the game. I found myself constantly waiting in between waves for the exposition to end just so i wouldn't miss it, knowing it's the only chance i'll get to here it.

Definitely pick it up if it's on sale. At full price I'm not sure I would consider it. 

The game is a arena survival mission style of game, with a fairly interesting story, that is quite fun, but only if you have a class that you like. Fortunately there are four to choose from, each with their own unique abilites and weapon. I can't quite remember the exact names, but I will attempt to describe them as best I can. 

The Jedi(try to tell me it's not) is super fun for a melee class. Your light saber functions as both a short and long range weapon(you can throw it like a boomarang). The throw is kind of difficult to figure out, but is generally useful if you can get the angle correct. You also get some neat telekinectic powers to throw enemies around with. One more thing, the laser katana deflects any projectile as well as blocks beam weapons. 

The archer is basically that, only with some different arrow types. Fairly straight forward. I enjoyed it for the most part, just kind of tired of archery in VR to be honest.

The pistol class is kind of neat in that you basically have the balistic version of the plasma pistol. It has a charge shot as well as an auto fire ability. It's manual reload, that's kind of difficult to perform mid-fight. The magazine doesn't always line up correctly and needs a little bit of practice to do efficiently. 

Lastly, is a kind of brusier class with a shotgun. Frankly it tires my off arm out as you have to cock the weapon before fireing. Luckily no reload mechanic. You also get some mini laser spike knuckles to decimate foes with. Which I definitely thought was neat... If I could reach the enemies. You can punch with any of the classes, but you need to be quite close. They also have a much longer reach than you and can complicate gauging the distance between you and the enemy. 

There is quit a bit more to the classes at you progress and gain more abilties, but I will let you discover those for yourself.

Overall the game is simple, kill the enemy while defending the data core. You also have the option of installing turrets onto the battle-field as well as having friends or randoms with you. 

Graphics wise, this is one of the few VR games that I've played that has minimal issues with blurriness. Everything looks very good from a distance and all the text is legible. This makes me happy. I'm using the original HTC Vive. 

There's nothing particularly glitchy per se about the game, it's just needs a few tweaks to some of the abilites. 

Probably my favorite game on VR thus far.

UPDATE: This is not for the feint of heart, or if your GFX card is low end. Below were my original issues on an AMD Raedon R9 390 using the default graphics settings. I changed the two ""mid"" settings to low, the physics engine from ""Epic"" to ""medium"" and the multiplier to 0.9x. Any number of these might have done the trick but it allowed me to finally complete the first mission -- an incredibly heart-pounding shoot-out from all directions. If this is indicative of the rest of the game, I highly recommend it!

I do see some people are upset with some headtracking bugs... all I can share is my feedback with respect to their support: they have been responding quickly. I had already included an export of my DirectX logs and they jumped right into some suggestions, including the one above which fixed it.

Here's my issue - when I'm starting the actual campaign, inevitably my headset blacks out and crashes for a moment. When it comes back I've lost sound to the headset plus whatever valuable time I had while in combat.

This game is facking amazing;
[list]
    [*]Amazing characters with great abilities.
    [*]Great maps.
    [*]Good variation in enemies.
    [*]Interesting story.
    [*]Very immersive. (Gets kinda creepy sometimes. In a good way tho}.
[/list]
2 bad things about the game;
[list]
    [*]In some levels (like level 4) you need to defend 3 things. Usually enemies only spawn at 1 of the 3, but it still gets pretty 
    frustrating.
    [*]The bow is very hard to use because you need to pull back very far. Could just be that i have very short arms tho.
[/list]

[b] My opinion on the classes: [/b]
Bishop (Pistol}: Great abilities and a nice primary weapon. reloading is at the beginning very easy and gets even easier when you play a few levels as him. Can't really think of anything bad about him.

Boss (Shotgun): Cool idea and nice execution. Good primary weapon. Easy to use with 1 and 2 hands. My  left hand (Hand to reload) when using 2 hands does get tired pretty quickly, but that could just be me not having an active life.

Saija (Sword): Facking awesome. Great abilities. His sword is a 1 shot on normal enemies. What i can say tho is that taking out drones is a facking pain in the ass. Especially if you dont have the telekenisis ability yet. Other then that he is really good. He can take out enemies with a large healthpool very quickly aswell. And he just makes me feel like a facking badass.

Elder (Bow): Can't say a lot about him, because i dont play him at all. He is like i said annoying to use for me. His bow is pretty good but hard to use. I dont understand his first ability at all.

Pistol doesn't move to left handed holster for left handed players, so reloading is too much of a pain to even bother with this class.

Shotgun is buggy to hipfire, and feels akward to try aiming down it's ironsights. It feels like my arms aren't long enough to comfortably reload and most of the time it jiggles all over the place when I do, as I simply can't move my arm back and forward in a straight line. So every time I reload I have to aim again.

Sword is nice, boomerang is fun.

Whenever I have the walking option on I'm almost constantly slowly moving in some direction. The only game where this is an issue.

I have the game on the lowest possible settings and I'm still stuttering in some instances. Mostly when I hit a robot and they freak out and ragdoll inside of walls.

This is not constructive criticism. The games been out long enough to where these problems should have been brought up already by people that aren't me. This is just me venting my disapointment.

Took me about 20 minuts to start the game up my second play as it black screened on startup twice. Why 20 minutes though? Because starting the game up to the main menu takes about 7 minutes, by far the longest load times I've seen for any game recently, vr or not.

Tried the bow out, and yeah I guess my arms are just too short. Stretching my left arm out as far as it could go allows me the ability to just barely try and aim this thing down its sights. Same problem as the shotgun. Hipfiring it just as wonky and unfun as trying to aim down the sights.

Bit the bullet and decided to just use my right hand for Pistol. It was fun. I actually thought about just sticking around for Sword and Pistol class. But then I thought, Is this game that only has two weapons for me to use more or less fun than Sairento? It's less.",1524268113,1524268113,False,7,1,0.560868442058563232,0,True,False,False,False,,1524510768.0,"Hey BB,

Watching 
 some meager gameplay of it got me really excited, and I thought it looked amazing, but in practice it is only an alright, if well polished, tower defense shooter. It reminds me generally of my experience with the long defunct Sanctum. The initial concept is interesting, and it feels polished, but after a short time playing it became clear to me that I wasn't going to get much out of it. For some, I'm sure this will be a blast, but I even found the ninja underwhelming. The sword didn't really feel like it had any reach, and the two handed function felt awkward though it looks awesome from an outside perspective.

Unfortunately, I also got the sense that the levels were very small. The area you actually have to/will normally traverse is minimal, especially since the maintainence of turrets is a hassle if they are spread all around far from the tower.

Overall, if you've ever played Sanctum, and you got hours and hours out of it, I think you'll think this is a solid game, and perhaps you'll even get your money's worth, though it's severely lacking in the scale that Sanctum had, map wise, and the movement isn't nearly as dynamic and fluid. Given the price tag, I simply cannot recommend this game.

A suggestion for the developers though, perhaps. I can't confirm that this would help at all, but I HIGHLY SUGGEST varying the first two levels of the campaign, so that they're not cookie cutter with different lighting. That very much set the tone for the game in my mind. Variation might just be the key, but I realize the game is already released and major changes like this are unlikely at this point.",1523018588,1523018588,False,3,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False,False,,,

(Getestet mit der HTC Vive)
In Raw Data infiltrieren wir den Konzern Eden Corp, um Datenpakete zu stehlen. Dazu stehen uns 4 verschiedene Klassen zur Auswahl, wir können entweder mit Pistolen, Schrotflinte, Schwertern oder Bogen in den Kampf ziehen.
Nach einem ausführlichen Tutorial geht es auch schon los. Wir schlagen entweder alleine oder im Coop Wellen von Robotern zurück. Das fängt an bei stupiden Läufern, die im Nahkampf auf uns einprügeln, und geht über Flugdrohnen bis hin zu raketenfeuernden Riesenmechs.
Zusätzlich können wir unseren Charakter durch Stufenaufstieg mit Spezialfähigkeiten ausrüsten, ob nun Bullet-time beim Pistolenschützen oder spezielle Pfeile für den Bogen, mächtige Schwertattacken und und und...
Auf den verschiedenen Karten können wir uns frei bewegen. Dazu können wir uns zwischen Teleportation und flüssiger Bewegung entscheiden, beides funktioniert sehr gut.
Das Waffenhandling finde ich persönlich auch sehr gelungen, Zielen klappt ausgezeichnet, das Auslösen der Spezialfähigkeiten geht ebenfalls gut von der Hand.
Die Grafik sieht ebenfalls sehr gut aus und das Spiel lief auch mit einer GTX 970 noch durchaus Spielbar. (Mit 1080 ti hat man mehr Weitsicht)
Lediglich im Koop traten gelegentlich Grafikfehler beim Schwertkämpfer auf (Endlos lange Gummiarme, wenn sie das Schwert wirft), vielleicht wurde es aber auch schon behoben. Außerdem ist es vorgekommen, dass ich im Koop durch den Fahrstuhl gefallen bin. Nicht weiter tragisch, aber auch nicht unbedingt nötig ;)
Den PvP-Modus fand ich eher nicht so gelungen, es kam einfach keine rechte Spielfreude auf, aber das ist sicher Geschmackssache.
Für mich in dem Genre auf jeden Fall eines der besten Spiele, auch wenn es auf den ersten Blick für einen Waveshooter natürlich sehr teuer ist.

The game is okay, but I don't think it justifies its $40 dollar price tag, and this is for two reasons.

The first reason isn't that bad, but is worth mentioning: the game is, at its core, a wave shooter. This means a lot of reused content - the first level and the second are the same except for lighting and enemy spawns, each level is just waves of enemies walking at you, etc

The second is the reason I refunded the game just now: enemies take WAY too many hits. If I run up to a dude with a shotgun and shoot as quickly as I can, the harder enemies take FOREVER to die, and the weaker ones take more hits than they should. The swords can take more than one slash, and that's if they collide properly at all. The pistols sound like they're toys, and they hit like it too. The bow is /super/ fun initially, but one-shotting everybody turns out to be lame too.

If there was a way to make the game spawn way more enemies but have them all die in just a few hits, then I would think this game was fantastic, but as it stands, it's super bland.

I bought this game because I wanted more Robo Recall.
I realize now that I should have just booted up Robo Recall for that.
Would highly recommend were it $9, but not $30-40.",1518766602,1518766624,False,5,2,0.519402384757995605,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Nice range of difficulty settings
-Teleporting and Walking Locomotion, take your pick
-Great graphics

Cons:

Each class feels unique, and tailored and you do find yourself drawn to a specific character as you work out your play style. Sure running around like a jedi/cyborg/ninja was cool, but for me the pull to the Equilibirum styled Cleric was great! 
The comfort value and tracking as well as movement means absolutely no nausea in this at any point and the general 'feel' of shooting is perfect, there was clearly some serious work put into the tracking!

2, You got a VR system and wondering if you should buy this game.
If you invested in a VR system then it is a no-brainer decision. Really. do not read further, click Add to Cart.
Why are you still here? ehh, then the actual review follows:
It is an excellent experience in VR, simple, but very entertaining. Good storyline, good immersion, several different characters (4) with different unlockable skills.

""The premise for Raw Data feels heavily inspired by the works of Isaac Asimov and essentially puts you in the shoes of Will Smith in iRobot. The mission is to uncover the secrets plaguing Eden Corp, but in order to do so you'll have to fight for your life against an onslaught of mechanical men intent on ending your existence. 

Raw Data has an enthralling sci-fi vibe. We love the futuristic setting - the built-up skyline out of the corporation windows, the mechanical men in various shapes and sizes, the talkative AI who's tagged along for the ride - which creates an atmosphere that gels perfectly with the story.

Most of the campaign levels take place on the various floors of the Eden Corp building as you make your way from lab to lab, trying to extract data from the systems to reveal what the company is up to.

This is where it becomes clear that Raw Data is a wave-shooter/tower-defence game at its core. Dropping into the first level, you insert a device to extract the data, then the alarm bells start ringing and the robots come baying for blood.

We love the introduction to the game, where a crazed bot smashes head-first through a glass panel in order to get at you - a scene we can't help but think we've seen before...

Overall, Raw Data is much like a lot of things we've seen before. It's another wave-based shooter with a few mildly interesting mechanics. It doesn't do much that other VR games haven't already cracked.

The design of Raw Data does have a lot going for it though. The graphics are impressive, the mild-RPG elements are engaging, the ability to play with friends online is a welcome addition, tracking is accurate, movement problem-free, and the gunplay works really well.

However, we did feel a bit frustrated with not being able to get access to more weaponry or upgrades, while many levels feel too similar in their tactic.

With around four or five hours of gameplay in the main campaign there's not a huge amount of content, but with access to co-op modes and player-versus-player - with cross-platform player support, which is a rare and welcome feature - you're bound to be able to get your money's worth. ""

Wield duel pistols, a laser sword, shotgun or bow and take out droves and droves of robots. It's a shame the game is often little more than a wave based shooter, save for a couple of missions that actually have a sense of progression through an environment.

Still, there's few games with mechanics as tight as this and it's amazing how little time it takes to become quite adept with any of the classes and kick some serious metal ass. My favorite is the bow wielding hunter, with his charged up arrows and AOE abilities.

But if you're looking for a deep story, this ain't the game for you. Raw Data's narrative is often delivered during missions in the form of a voiceover, when you're too busy taking on the neverending onslaught of enemies to truly pay attention. Later missions just keep throwing the tougher enemy types at you to ramp the difficulty, but there's no noticeable punishment for death, outside of a 5 or so second respawn time which affects your end level score.

Certain classes only become fun once you've unlocked certain abilities, duel wielding for the Cleric as an example, so the initial enjoyment factor can be quite slow.

First impressions were very underwhelming. There were many technical issues that came up that shows this game is still unpolished; crashing, jitters, games deadlocking, player interactions invalidating the tutorial. It was a mess to start. Luckily, my friend and I kept pushing each other to keep trying it a little more. If it wasn't for the co-op factor we would have both dropped this game like a bad habbit. 

It wasn't until the 5th co-op game we play that we really got excited. By this time we tried all of the different classes and progressed the primary to duel wield. If I had to do it over again, I would level up the pistol guy to duel weild first. You get a couple of other perks that improve the gameplay tremendeiously; in fact, its such an improvment it seems like it should have been the default abilities. 

The game itself has very polished graphics, but that seems to be were the spent most of their time polishing. THe enemies you fight tend not to feel very engaging or aware of your presence. To many times I have multiple guys with a laser riffle staring off into space but dead shotting me with their gun. Other times you'll have AI walk right passed you not turning its head or trying to attack you. These little moments break the transparency and fieel of the game; you can just feel the lazy programming here. 

So all in all, AFTER playing for 3 hours we finally got into the rythm of the game and we were cheering and yelling at eachother all through the last match even though we failed it right at the end. We're hoping for more maps like this one afterwards, and if this was the only good mission I'll come back and change my review. 

The community seems very active and I had many people try to get me to play co-op with them while i was waiting for my friends. You can choose to share audio separately from joining their game. This is nice if you want to talk to them prior to playing so you don't get stuck into a potential 30m uphill battle.

It's not that the game is awful, it's just massively overhyped for what it is, even for VR.

It is quite literally nothing more than a basic wave-shooter, with some uninspring and rather annoying dialogue in between rounds in order to try to convince you that the game has story/progression. 

The shooting/reload mechanics are not particularly fun to play with compared to games like Onwards or Pavlov, and I found myself drearly pointing my gun at the encroaching enemies waiting for it to get interesting. I was annoyed 3/4 of the way through the first level at yet again having to grab that bloody data download thing and wait for the ai companion to find another excuse for the surrounding robots to start attacking me, it all felt very contrived. The 2nd level looked almost identical to the 1st, save some marginally different enemies. It switches up a little more in the 3rd level and beyond but not enough to make me want to keep playing at all. 

Overall I just feel there is not reason to play Raw Data. The mechanics aren't fun to play with, the story/characters aren't gripping, and the scenarios are repetative, so the fact that the world looks polished doesn't matter. Even dying felt like it didn't matter, I just seems to respawn quickly with the level still ongoing. There's nothing to really care about or feel engaged with.

Only thing that would be handy is to be able to re-orient your rotation to keep your cord behind you.  Most levels there is one primary area from which you will fight, leave and return, and the cabling is much friendlier if that orientation has the cord behind you (in teleport-only mode).

BUGS:  you can accidentally holster your right hand gun in your left have holster (by handing it off in the heat of battle).

Though it's a wave shooter at it's heart the movment, graphics, controls, and gameplay are second to none. We play with roomscale and It's a fast paced, intense adrenaline filled rush that will get you moving. You'll not be taking down robots here standing flat fooded blasting away. Nope, not by a long shot! Here you'll be dodging lazer blasts, ducking and side stepping lazer beams, dodging / blocking melee attacks having a hell of a time doing it.",1511935996,1511935996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Le jeu a passé presque 1 an 1/2 en early access, durée pendant laquelle il a été régulièrement amélioré et agrandi. 

Attention à ne pas se laisser tromper par les trailers : l'histoire est très rudimentaire, il n'y a pas de campagne à proprement parler et les dialogues, bien que réussis, ne sont là que pour donner un peu de contexte à l'action. On en apprend plus sur l'univers SF/cyberpunk du jeu en consultant des ressources externes comme le vrai-faux site de la compagnie ""[url=http://www.edencorp.tokyo/]Eden Corp[/url]"" ou les [url=https://survios.com/rawdata/media/]bandes dessinées[/url] produites pour le jeu. 

Tant qu'on rentre dans ce jeu en s'attendant à de l'action non-stop, on ne sera normalement pas déçu. Les parties se jouent soit en solo soit en coop à 2, et chaque niveau consiste à défendre ou attaquer une ou plusieurs ressources face à 5 vagues de robots meutriers de diverses engeances. Les ennemis vont du mini-drone volant au robot géant de 10m, en passant par les kamikazes explosifs, ninjas invisibles, fusilliers, lance-roquettes, etc. Il y a 10 niveaux de taille variée qui présentent tous des variantes sur le principe de base. La difficulté est paramétrable (ce qui est utile car jouer en solo se révèle nettement plus difficile qu'en coop).

4 personnages, représentant chacun un archétype de gameplay, sont jouables :[list]
[*]Bishop le pistolero, utilisant 2 pistolets à la fois (évoquant le style du film Equilibrium)
[*]Saija la ninja, qui manie le sabre et la télékinésie (en gros une jedi)
[*]Boss le gros dur, qui préfère le fusil à pompe et ses poings (me rappelle un peu Judge Dredd)
[*]Elder l'archer, quant à lui, envoie une panoplie de flèches au effets variés (à la ""Oeil-de-faucon"" de l'univers Marvel)
[/list]

Un mode PvP est également présent et semble populaire (pour un jeu VR) mais je ne l'ai pas essayé. Le PvP et la VR en général font actuellement mauvais ménage en raison de la très faible population de joueurs. Je ne recommanderai donc pas d'acheter un jeu VR actuellement pour son PvP, car il peut rapidement se retrouver désert et donc inutilisable. Fort heureusement ce n'est pas l'attrait principal de Raw Data qui, bien qu'idéal en coop, est tout à fait fonctionnel en solo.

Au niveau visuel le jeu présente des graphismes soignés, au dessus de la plupart des jeux conçus par des studios indépendants, mais en dessous des grosses productions commes celles financées par Oculus. Le jeu utilise le forward rendering et le MSAA (ce qui n'était pas le cas au début de sa période d'early access) ce qui lui permet de compenser les problèmes d'aliasing qui affectent les jeux VR.

Enfin le jeu gère le crossplay entre Oculus et SteamVR de sorte à maximiser la population de joueurs. Attention toutefois Steam et Oculus ne partageant pas de listes de contacts, retrouver un ami sur l'autre plateforme nécessite un peu de bidouille. Il vaut donc mieux préférer l'achat sur la même platforme, indépendamment du hardware, si on souhaite jouer avec quelqu'un en particulier.

플레이타임은 7시간 정도 플레이 한거 같은데 캐릭터 언락하느라 같은 스테이지 몇번 반복하고 멀티 플레이 잠깐 해보고 하다보니 10스테이지도 꽤 길더라구요.
아직은 비숍(권총)캐릭으로 밖에 클리어를 안했지만 이제 곧 다른 캐릭도 진행해보고 난이도를 올려볼까 생각중입니다.

I know the trailers really don't make it seem like it is, but Raw Data is pretty much a tower defense game. You have one defense point (plus yourself) and 4 towers with which to bring an assault on swarms of robots. The problem is that gameplay is far too repetitive once you get the game going. And I've already played 6 of the 10 levels. All you do is shoot/stab and teleport away. It's fast paced, but surprisingly not very engaging. The sword boomerang is extremely glitchy and dropped the sword half of the times I tried to throw it. When the environment moves, it sometimes leaves fixed elements behind that aren't supposed to stay with you. I lost tracking repeatedly despite being in the center of my (large) room-scale playspace, and I even lost the ability to teleport and had to restart the game. Absolutely frustrating problems that shouldn't persist into a final release game.

Oh, did I mention that it's only 10 levels? And each one can be cleared in a fairly short amount of time. All you do is shoot/slash robots while an AI and someone on comms say barely meaningful things (repeatedly). You get the point, it gets old really quicly. It's absolutely frustrating how studios pump out basic VR games then charge big-name studio pricing on them. I bought this game on sale and it's still too much for what it offers in gameplay.

VR games need to be held to the same standards as non-VR. 10 levels? That's it? And each one is basically one room? There are 80's arcade games with more content.

The updated movement mechanics are great (Smooth move FTW!) and the combat mechanics are polished and enjoyable. But you just never go anywhere. Boring. Repetetive. No AI. Not much story. Like so much else in VR, it's a $10 indie title at AAA prices.

The Good: 
_Awesome, tight environment design. Plenty of beautiful areas to look at.
_Cool story premise. I heard it's good, but short.
_I can see my magazine run down in the handgun. Nice touch. It's the coolest weapon by far. Oh, I could turn off the laser sword. That was cool. No sound effects though.
_There is a nice challenge to the game on normal. But... it's for the wrong reasons.

The Bad: 
_I couldn't get hooked into the story at the beginning. What am I doing here? What is this weird video? There was some cool nuanced tone but then they made it ULTRA blatant with your narrator character just outright saying the company is evil then... Well then why am I in the frigging lobby of their headquarters farting around? Just feels all wrong to me.
_Sum up the tone of the game as ""Gamey"". Characters get unique power ups? Laser sword magically swoops back to your hand automatically when thrown? Stuck in a room while a person says ""hang on I'm hacking the system. Oh no they are blocking me from the system. Oh no""? no thanks.
_One character, one weapon. Not particularly fun ones. Maybe this changes later? Didn't bother to find out.
_Melee class is miserable to play solo. Feels like they just wanted to cross it off their checklist.
_AI is very simplistic (in the bad way). Like, top down arcade shooter simplistic. Much more reactive AI present in Robo Recall, Interstellar Marines, Fallout 4, basically any recent game I've played with robots in it. Most of them just shuffle about a little while I bonk them with my sword over and over until their bullet sponge HP pool empties.

The Ugly: 
_Environments lack interactivity (one again, maybe this changes later). You can walk and stand on ""warp pads"" and activate the wave trigger and that's it. I saw a few points of cover scattered around that are effectively useless. Maybe cover becomes useful in multiplayer?
_NO atmosphere. You want atmospheric gameplay with robots? Try playing Interstellar Marines. Or Fallout 4.
_Rift face-forward system is pretty bad. Flicking thumbstick to turn feels incredibly clunky. Feels like they shouldn't have even added it. It's not terrible until you get into combat.",1508307587,1508307587,False,2,0,0.487203091382980347,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Raw Data is what I'd call a wave based arena shooter - exactly like the big budget Robo Recall from Epic games. These two games share A LOT, so if you're familiar with RR, you know what to expect here too.

You can choose from 4 characters, who all have distinct weapons and special powers. Detailed info here: https://survios.com/rawdata/heroes/

- Bishop is the good allrounder - My choice for a solo playthrough on hard difficulty.
- Boss has limited range but really high DPS - depending on the map, a really good partner for Bishop in co-op.
- Elder requries a little more skill with his powerful bow, but largely fills the same long range role as bishop.
- Saija is melee focused, but still has a bit of range when throwing the swords like a boomerang.

Playing solo with the first three characters on normal difficulty was proper fun, and I feel the devs did a good job diversifying their abilities and weapons. But Saija turned out to be a great disappointment for me. This melee based character seems super powerful, but the hit detection was just so terrible it ruined the fun for me. I started out expecting to be able to slice and dice the robots hollywood style, but more than half the times my blade just went through my foes seemingly unregistered. The only method that reliably worked was a top down slice to the skull. Doing this repeatedly with 2 swords alternating left and right, I felt more like I was playing drums than being a cool sci-fi ninja.

There's a great deal of options for moving your character. There's teleportation and snap turning - but also smooth stick locomotion and turning. But the kicker is that you can have it all simultaneously(!) which I find great. The telportation has it's limitations to keep it balanced. Raw Data is so close to ticking all the boxes in this category, but sadly the devs didn't implement the turn+teleport combination like you get in RR. Maybe a conscious balancing decision, but until I have a wireless HMD, this much turning around after teleporting behind a foe gets the cable tangled. 

In each wave you have to protect your data core(s) from the incoming robots (much like protecting a relay in RR). To aid you in this you can purchase and build 3 different turret types and a dome shield. You gain currency for each kill.

The levels vary from fairly small confined rooms to quite large vertically displaced platforms connected with winding walkways. 

The visual presentation is really good with settings almost maxed out, but I did experience some framerate issues here and there - especially in the lobby. 

I would've loved a cracking beat heavy electronic soundtrack to go along with the action, but all you get is some dramatic atmospheric movie-esque background music. 

I've had a really good time so far with Raw Data, and while the campaign only gives you 2-4 hours there's plenty replayability for me with the 4 classes and hard/nightmare difficulty settings, global/friend leaderboards,  not to mention co-op.

Having said that there are a lot of bugs and annoyances. Here are some of them:

- Enemies get pushed into walls a lot
- Hands and weapons totally misaligned at times, thus disabling Bishops fusion charged shot
- Falling through elevator floor
-Getting thrown backwards in the air for no reason on ""Fatal Error"" until you're crushed against wall
- Crashes (had 4-5 so far)
- Restart of a level is cumbersome and difficulty resets to normal
- Enemy turret explosion often missing (they just vanish)
- Enemies running backwards
- Stealth ninja bots standing idle next to my turret letting me kill them
- Teleporting outside arena area = instadeath. Even before a wave starts.
- You cannot rebind the controls, which means you have locomotion on the left stick, which you have to press down to engange the teleport. Needless to say I ended up pressing the stick by accident a lot when the action was hectic, causing me to teleport somewhere random. Pretty confusing. 

Bottom line: Really good shooter that could use some spit shine to reach the polish level of Robo Recall, which I'd recommend above this game unless co-op is essential for you.

It’s polished, the combat is fun and fast, and there is a good variety in the types of levels. Play solo or with friends in cross-platform multiplayer - you can play with your friends if they have the game on Oculus Home.  

There are 4 heroes to choose from – the melee focused robot ninja Saija, the rocket-punch shotgun toting Boss, the duel wielding Bishop that was taken straight from Equilibrium and Elder the laser archer because laser arrows are a thing. Each character has a unique arsenal and their own set of abilities and powerful ultimates to stave off those robot hordes.  

If “wave shooter” is something you intentionally avoid, or you haven’t tried out Raw Data, it’s worth a look for its polished nature and frenetic, physical action.

Dieses Spiel ist definitiv vollwertig. Es bietet die Freiheit sich so zu bewegen wie man es am liebsten mag. Teleport, Locomotion, alles vorhanden. Es fühlt sich cool an die verschiedenen Waffen in den Händen zu halten. Diese sind allerdings an den Charakter gebunden. Es gibt 4 spielbare Charaktere, jeder hat eine eigene Waffe. Es ist wirklich nur eine Waffe, man kann also nicht zwischen verschiedenen Pistolen auswählen. Dafür schalten die Charaktere verschiedene neue Skills frei die man benutzen kann. Zur Auswahl stehen Akimbopistolen (am Anfang ist es nur eine Pistole, bis zum Levelup), ein Char mit Pumpgun, ein Ninja mit Schwert sowie ein Bogenschütze. Es gibt 10 Missionen mit verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden die man alleine oder im Coop spielen kann. Dazu gibt es 2 PVP Modi, allerdings muss ich sagen dass ich seit ich das Spiel habe erst einmal eine offene PVP Lobby gefunden habe und in dieser in einer 2vs1 Situation war... das war nicht wirklich cool. Könnte mir vorstellen dass PVP sehr witzig wäre, hier ist aber das generelle Problem das viele MP VR Titel haben... es gibt einfach zu wenige Spieler. Das Game wg PVP zu kaufen, davon würde ich abraten. 

Das Spiel hat eine tolle Optik, läuft bei mir stabil und ist nie abgestürzt. Es ist auch auf jeden Fall geeignet um Kumpels zu zeigen wie cool VR sein kann. Es gibt verschiedene Gegnertypen, insbesondere die großen Roboter wirken sehr bedrohlich wenn sie vor einem stehen. Immersion ist klasse.
Die Missionen unterscheiden sich thematisch, es gibt einen ""Dark Room"", die Laser aus Resident Evil, einen Oberboss usw. Die Levels beschränken sich bis auf eine Ausnahme auf einzelne Räume, manchmal mit der Möglichkeit dass der Raum grösser wird, sich Türen öffnen usw. Man bewegt sich generell aber immer in einem (großen!) Raum.

The gameplay is pretty nice and the robots have variatey and are pretty scary. You won't really use the sword person or the bow and arrow.

The multiplayer is just plain dumb, no one plays it, and the gameplay is stupid. The story is the only thing that's really good about this game. It's pretty short too. For the 1.2 hours that I've played on it, I already completed 4/8 of the missions. (correct me if I'm wrong)

There isn't really a lot of replayablity in this game, the campaign is short and the multiplayer is kinda dumb. Maybe I haven't sunken much time into it but the first hour was really enjoyable. After that I didn't really see the point of playing it anymore when I could be playing other titles like Onward, Pavlov, Gorn, and Rec Room. 

Personally, for $40, this isn't a really good game. Maybe for $15-20 it would be decent. It could just be me and my ignorance for not playing the game too long and using used computer parts to build the minumum specs required for VR.

- A Story (With a ""fake"" website giving even more)
- Multiple Characters that all play differently
- Some interesting stages with their own special traps
- A terrifying dark level that still makes me jump, in a good way
- Coop
- PvP

Cons:

The game is not ready for release, it needs to go back into the oven for a bit longer IMO.

I had high hopes for this title due to all the hype surrounding it but I don't think it is deserved.

Pros:
 * Model detail is good
 * Plenty of options for picking handedness, locomotion and turning UI hints on and off. You can even setup Oculus room Scale (although if you have 3+ cameras it should probably just do this automatically).
 * They've managed to improve performance since early access, props!
 *

Cons:
 * I seem to not be able to grab a magazine for my pistol 50% of the time, sometimes when I grab it my hand disappears and then the magazine just drops, this is incredibly annoying in battle. Tried replacing batteries in my controller, no effect.
 * Cringe story and plot elements
 * On Oculus Rift the gun doesn't appear to point in the proper direction, it seems to be angled upward for the Vive controller.
 * Hand direction movement seems to be influenced by the roll of your controller as opposed to just the vector from your body to the controller controlling the direction, this just feels awkward since my hand resting rotation will not have my character moving forward.
 * None of the weapons FEEL good
 * Reloading the pistol feels awkward AF when the hand animation plays, it feels like a loss of agency for the purpose of a cool animation but it just ends up feeling bad. Actually a lot of the ""grab here"" animations feel awkward like this, it seems like my wrist is snapping to accomplish some of them.
 * Art direction leaves a lot to be desired in terms of robot design and lighting, a bit to RGB 255 neon for my tastes. It almost feels like an asset flip with the designs seemingly being all over the place, you have the base robot with a cartoonish humanoid face (which I'm not a fan of) then you have more industrial non-humanoid faced robots which look much more appropriate.

There are four main weapons for each class, the pistol (dual pistols thru upgradin'), the katana, the shotgun, and a bow.

The katana class is also good, although frustrating in solo when the drones come flying out its difficult to hit them. The shotgun class is nice too and makes short work of enemies in close range. The bow class is harder at first to use however if you're familiar with other VR bow games like in the lab, you'll adjust more comfortably. My preference is mainly the bow class especially in PVP with homing arrows you'll be poppin off kills left and right

Special note for Oculus touch users. It is obvious that the DEVs never actually used these in game. Many menu options are awkward or unusable. Press down on the joystick while pulling the trigger and hitting a button on the same controller? 

While this is a technically solid game it is weighed down by terrible/boring game design.   It feels like they wanted to combine tower defense and a wave shooter but they took the worst parts of each genre and mashed them together.

Requires 360 degree awareness because poor level design (generally a circular room). VR headsets do not provide the same field of view humans have. It cuts off the peripheral vision which makes full 360 awareness awkward in a headset. Most VR designers control the action so it feels more natural but that isn't the case here. 

Outdated teleport system makes locomotion a must.

Every weapon feels bad. Pistols are weak and unsatisfying. Sword is more like a throwing weapon than a melee weapon. Shotgun... well 2 handed guns are bad in a lot of VR but this was one of the worst. Bow... just load up The Lab and save your self 40 bucks.  Dropping your weapon leaves you unarmed untill it teleports back.  Reload mechanics for pistol were fun though.

Enemys are bland and uninteresting.

Definitely worth the money, lots of content, regular updates, and ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.

Basically, its a defend the objective kind of game, where waves of robots come at you with melee, lasers, rockets, and some are cloaked. You are a Data Theif, your job is to break into super computers and steal the data, during the upload the computer fights you back by sending robotic sentries to attack you and your uplink. You can dodge the attacks, even the laser beams, and fight back with your respective weapons based on the character you chose before the start of the game. You can shoot them, melee them, trap them with traps and turrets, and even use a futuristic bow. 

Stealing the data and getting away with it at the end of the level yeilds you experience towards unlocking new abilities and weapons for your character, and progressing onto the next level.

Easy to jump into
Fast Paced Gameplay

Raw Data is an exceptional game, even in its current Early Access state. The level design is well thought out and implemented. The graphics are jaw droppingly beautiful. The enemy robots are challenging and varied and the weapons /  abilities of the 4 character types are fun to learn and advance with neat upgrades as you progress through the levels.

Level design was definitely thoroughly thought out and lovingly designed with beautiful graphics and detail. Instead of standing in a single location, you can move around to confront the hordes of robotic aggressors, taking the battle to them. You have a ""base"" of operations which is where you enter into the level. There is a console from which you need to extract data and while this data extraction is taking place, the robots are deployed in an attempt to stop you. From this base, you can zip around the level using teleportation or use the walk mode. There are generally ramps and platforms which lead from your base to the entry areas where robots start their march to stop you by attacking your base (and you). With Room Scale play, you will be ducking behind containers and consoles in order to avoid being hit by blaster fire, popping back up to return fire on the robots (some of whom also use this tactic against you).

Enemy robots come in a wide variety, each with unique abilities. These range from basic dumb drones to ones which are much more capable and are used like a boss /mini-boss on the levels. Don't just focus on the robots walking and running (and sometimes crawling) towards you though as there are flying drones who add to the frenzy, raining shots down upon you and your base from above. The enemy can even upgrade from basic robots to big, hard hitting ones on at least one of the levels which added a great twist to the strategy of how to deal with them. 

To deal with these robotic killing machines, you can choose from one of 4 different character types, each with a different weapon of choice and abilities unique to that character and weapon. The weapons start out with basic abilities but as your character defeats levels, the abilities for those weapons improve. For example, the handgun starts out with the requirement to reload by grabbing a fresh clip from your hip using your off-hand but then progresses to just lowering the gun down to reload and on to dual wielding.. The varied weapons and upgrades assures some great replay value as each weapon type has its own strengths and weaknesses to master.

In addition to the primary weapons at your disposal, you get to place turrets and other helpful additions to the level. These need to be protected as the robots will attack them. You can repair the emplacements if they take damage. These tend to offer limited help as the focus remains upon the player to defeat the advancing robots and to defend the base of operations (and now your turrets). They do offer a little extra breathing room by engaging / slowing enemies while you may be focused on other attackers. Don't rely on these emplacements to handle anything on their own or you may find that your defenses are suddenly gone on your left flank!

There are few downsides to the game, which should get addressed as development continues. None of them are show stoppers by any means..

1) Swapping weapons to off hand happens too easily in a fight. This I am sure is a frustration which every player of the game has encountered when first starting out. It is far less of a problem now for me but it's a game mechanic which should be addressed by the developers. As it is now, this is a frustrating rite of passage of sorts for new players to learn to avoid doing.
2) Menu systems in game need work. The means of enabling special abilities is a little odd and needs to be refined. As it is, I rarely use these special abilities due to the clumsy activation method. Turret menu system can take some getting used to and can be improved. The menu also gets blocked often by other pop-up prompts hovering on your hand, trying to get your attention (such as the prompt telling you to grab a handle to continue to the next phase of a level).
3) Training flow needs improvements. It's not always clear what needs to be done to progress the training. Again, this is really for new players as experienced player figure out what needs to be done to move the game forward. There are odd glitches at times with training which frustrates new players.
4) AI still needs some refinement as some of the robots seem to get stuck trying to seek out cover. When they do find some protective cover, they sometimes make obviously confused decisions on how to attack. Currently, the AI looks to be in a rudimentary initial stage.

Overall, this is an amazing MUST HAVE game and it's still in Early Access! Improvements and features are being added regularly. This is a game which will set the standard for VR wave type games.

The art direction is second to none, with some of the most clever and interesting concepts on display in the VR category. Taking strong cues from Ghost in the Shell, Metal Gear Solid, Syndicate, The Matrix, Equilibrium and Blade Runner; the art department has done an incredible job of building it's own world while providing just the right amount of homage.

UI & FIRST IMPRESSIONS -
The interface is decent, but not fantastic. For some reason we couldn't get into the Steam Home menu from the game, only Oculus home. The menu's are a bit buggy. For instance, my microphone remained muted after we turned off the ""Mute Outgoing Voice"" feature in the menus. We had to toggle it a few times, but eventually it kicked back over. With that said: it had an option to mute outgoing voice, which is actually a great quality-of-life addition to the game. Pulling people into matches is also equally problematic. With some people not seeing invitations or finding it challenging to join the game. However 4 out of 5 times things worked perfectly, and we had a generally painless experience getting everything to work.

GRAPHICS -
Really second-to-none for VR games right now. The graphic style, character design, weapon design, animations; while not game-changing, are as good as it gets in VR right now. Everything is heavily borrowed from other works as mentioned above, but as with all creative endeavors the measure of quality is how those things are mixed together. Nothing is new, really, so it's a matter of whether a team can take previous concepts and add their own spin.

Raw Data leans on Asian Techno-Punk themes but includes some cool atomic-age references and some stuff that's also pretty out there. In the later half of the game there's a stand out level involving a trip to a psychodelic batanical garden that is exceptional. Tripping face on fauna pollen as the hexagonal panels imitating the sky flicker in and out above you; all while you blast away at robots that may or may not be real, is an extraordinary experience and is easily the games strongest moment.

There are however some reused environments that get kind of samey. The graphics are for the most part top shelf, but there is a bit of a creative inconsistency that adds some surprise to the game but also keeps it from being AAA good.

SOUND -
Good, but not great. There are flourishes of a auteurs hand: like a cutesy Japanese PA voice slowly glitching between chipper pleasantries, and sinister threats. The skree of de-limbed robots hurling themselves towards you in the dark. And some pretty crisp gun reports when you just mad-dog akimbo blast a horde of robots in an overstimulated panic.

The voice acting is also decent, but not exceptional. The Jarvis AI as a character is pretty on point, being a solid mix of Tony Starks AI buddy and a clueless corporate tour guide. Your in-ear handler is pretty cooky cutter, but delivers her lines well.

With that said, this isn't doom. The music and sound effects mostly serve a purpose. They weren't really designed to be a crucial part of the experience. There are no meticulously crafter effects soundscapes ala Alien Isolation, nor is there too strong of a thematic approach like the campy 80s tech swells of Robo Recall. It's all very good, but only good enough so as not to notice, not to feel strongly one way or the other about.

CONTROLS -
A mixed bag of awesome and irritating. Things generally work well, but there are some things that elicited several WTF's. Almost all of the issues are borne out of the limitations of the controllers combined with some poorly defined spacial areas. For instance, the pistol character doesn't get his second pistol till a few levels in. Before that you have to manually pull a magazine from your belt loop. The problem is the location of said magazine is on your hip, but it doesn't quite align to where your looking, nor does it quite align to where your actual body is. So sometimes you look down and the magazine is right there, and sometimes you look down and it's rotated 90 degrees away from your hand. This can break the flow of a fun fire fight.

Also, a friend had several instances where he threw his ninja sword and that shit basically just went out for cigarettes and never came back. Weapons when dropped usually warp back to a players hand, but in this case it just... forgot, we guess. Our friend basically just spent the rest of the match sadly checking for his sword over his shoulder, only to sadly find it missing and just punching robots with his little lady ninja arms. 

Shotgun controls are finnicky. But they usually are in VR. Triggering special abilities is for the most part painless, with a few exceptions. Not sure if this is everyones experience but anything that required triggering a special by putting your hands close to your head, just never works reliably. Two characters specifically require putting hands near your head to charge up, but for some reason it just wouldn't work sometimes, or trigger at random times, or kind of glitch on and off. 

The traversal mechanic is good. Warping is in no way disorienting, and the walking mechanic is fine. Nothing new, but well executed. 

WRITING & STORY -
Generic, with both some cliche but also funny moments. A good example of some interesting ideas, that needed more polish. The world is pretty fully realized, but the characters are neither annoying near endearing. They're just kind of there. And things are usually so hectic you basically ignore them anyway. There are some rougher moments though. The levels with the the bog-standard megalomaniacal CEO bloviating over a loud speaker while hordes of robots come at you, are so bad as to be irritating. We've been there, we've done that. Ten billion times.

If video game writers were to be believed, every asshole above middle-management in an evil corporation, is just waiting with his finger on the fucking loudspeaker button just waiting for some would-be hero to break in. Do these guys have this prepared? Like in the shower in the shower every morning going over talking points hoping that todays the day?

""You will fail in your quest terrorist! Should I go with quest? No lets go with mission. Ill say mission. More contemporary.""

As mentioned above there is one mission where you travel to a psychedelic corporate retreat that was so clever it almost seemed like it came from another game. The dialogue writing in this section is so head-and-shoulders above the rest, it's almost jarring; but is an entirely welcome change of pace.

LEVEL DESIGN AND PACING -
It's a wave shooting. And realistically, even though there are ten maps, there are five maps. Putting a fog effect on a previous map, is not a new map guys. That's just lazy. It was okay the first time it happens, but when it happens four more times it gets to be a bit incensing. 

With that said, its still way more content then any other VR shooter, so if it's the best of the bunch what is there to complain about? Still better than whatever-the-fuck happened with Robo-Recall and their one-map that they somehow think is three that they then make you replay over and over like they think you won't notice. 

We get it, Epic, you like de-limbing people. You have a sadism fetish. It's okay, just get a FetLife account like the rest of us.

FINAL THOUGHTS -
Even for all it's flaws, the game amalgamates to being greater than the sum of it's parts. We've played this VR game more than any other, and for now it's the app to beat. It's both familiar and new, and more than anything the action, which is what we spoke about the least, is really the main feature here. It's a fun, frantic and violent escapist experience.

So far there is 4 diffrenet classes to choose, Duel weeled pistols, Sword master, Shotgun, and a archer who shoots arrows from his bow which feels very badass. This is the type of game where I can just take out all my fustration, it does a great job on immersing you into this futuristic setting where robots are normal to see around.

Just not as a first purchase if you have to decide between this and every other game for the VIVE
Don't mind my hours... Idk wtf happened but I think it's missing about 10 hours of playtime. (I haven't used the bow yet)
Great Gameplay in general but it can get a little repetitive. It is the same through most of the game. beat 5 levels, hear some story about stuff happening. PROTECT THAT FUCKING CORE!!! 7/10
Teleporting instead of walking. Good for people new to VR or have bad motion sickness. I like that teleporting can run out of charge so you sometimes have to be smart about where you are going. 7/10
[b]Weapons[/b] are good overall getting an average of 6.5/10 but if you only care about the pistols it has some of the best gunplay in VR
[list] Pistols are amazing to use 9/10
    [*]Irons sights super good
    [*]You get to have a lot of those action movie moments
[/list]
[list]The sword is really fun to use 7/10
    [*]Throwing can be hard but good once used to it
    [*]In general good weapon
[/list]
[list]The shotgun is the worst weapon in the game in my opinion 3/10
    [*]Feels awkward to use
    [*]Makes the game feel a lot slower
    [*]Simply quite boring to use
[/list]
[b]Graphics[/b] are really nice for vr 8/10
[b]Levels[/b] have a nice amount of variation. Still easy to find your way around but there is some cool shit that happens not to spoil anything 7/10
[b]Story[/b] I mean it has one and for VR that is good enough haha 5/10 (I'm sure there is lots of detail if you look into it but I couldn't be bothered)
[b]Progression[/b] Lacking. There is progression but it's simply ""Here's a unlock token get the next ability"" I would prefer something like start with one pistol and get the choice to use the token to get a varient of the weapon, upgrades, abilities maybe attachments. But I mean for VR progression is rare and at best this is all it is. I'm glad it's there, just saying it could be better. 7.5/10
I got nothing else so here have a shortened version

Its hard to describe what a big deal this is in practice and I can only hope that other games start adapting it (even as an option).  

I glossed over this game for a while since the idea of shooting down waves of sterile looking robots didnt appeal to me all that much.

Turns out that my impression was wrong.

Thanks to a good backstory the robots have a sinister implication that fits the mood and ambiance of the game perfectly.

Multiplayer has been amazing fun as well, running around with guns blazing akimbo style against real opponents is a blast.

The game is a wave based shooter, but you have alot of freedom of movement to play with so quite often you will find yousrelf running around.  The different characters and the different abilities you have also translate to alot of fun.

From playing with different people in the campaigns, to trying to solo the story content with all four characters, this game is tons of fun.

Pros: 
     [b]Character Variety[/b]
          Each character feels completely different from eachother, and each has unique elements to it's gameplay. 
     [b]Level Design[/b]
          With the exception of the first two levels, each map feels totally different and unique - different places to hide, different enemy spawns, and tey're all pretty gorgeous. 
     [b]Gameplay[/b]
          Man... I almost jumped out of my skin the first time I saw a crawler coming at me. I was playing the dual weilding pistol gun-fu master Cleric and reflexively put my guns up and started pulling the triggers until both clips were empty. Sniping enemies with the new Rogue Hunter is tons of fun, blowing things in half with The Boss' shotgun, or slicing robots with Saija's katana... It all feels good. This is a wave shooter, but you have to move around all the levels (and some are quite large) in order to actually defend anything.

Cons:
     [b]Enemy Variety[/b]
          I don't feel like there are too many different kind of enemies, and some just look to similar to one another (like the walkers/runners and pew pew shooty guys/bzztbzzt laser guys), but this is kind of a minor complaint.
     [b]Matchmaking[/b] 
          The matchmaking in this game feels rather weak, and several times my mic just wouldn't work with the other person, so we played in silence. Other times I would join to be disconnected. I still haven't been able to play PvP at all, because whenever I try there is ""An Error occured while trying to join the matchmaking lobby""

PROS:

+ Graphics and Sound  are simply stunning
 + Decent variety of enemy types
+ Hit detection is on point, and enemies react appropriately when shot or sliced with a katana (a rarity in most vr games at the moment)
+ Voice acting is well-done although somewhat annoying at times.  However, you can skip through most of the voice over portions of the game during missions.
+ Easy to pick up and play but very challenging.  They hit you with tons of baddies on the get-go.  On hard mode, online co-op is necessary to survive.


Cons:

- So far, I've only seen tower defense (point defense) missions, and hopefully there are different mission types as I progress.
- Teleport locomotion only (It would be great to have other options for movement)
- Very hardware intensive. My i5-6600k with a 1070 barely runs this smooth.  This game could use better optimization.

Seeing as it was playing this game for the first time that really convinced me that I needed to get my hands on a Vive.

So I guess I have this game to thank as to why I have had so much fun over the past few months. It's an awesomely stylish wave shooter that feels very similar to a mix of I Robot and a film called Equilibrium (if anyone remembers that). It literally makes you feel like a bad ass taking out robot after robot. It's interesting how each different character has a unique weapon dynamic and it's fun playing around with them all to find which best suits your style of play.

It does become slightly repetitive near the end of the missions but the good thing about these types of games is it's always fun to just play for a bit of mindless robot slaughtering action. Although that being said I would love to see a proper single player/co-op campaign be added to Raw Data. Maybe a bit more dynamic with the enemies than just 3/4 slightly different robots.

Arizona Sunshine is a great example of a game that has managed to incorporate both a great campaign and horde mode, would love to see Raw Data go down a similar path.

As far as missions with jump scares and horror-style environments:
This is the only mission that really falls into this category.

If you can stomach it, we highly encourage you to complete this mission so you can experience some of our later levels. If you enjoyed Mission 1, you should really take a liking to the later missions :)

37 minutes in i am not impressed so far. Graphics are ok (meh models but to my eye good textures,  lighting is pretty good) with everything at epic except shadows at medium. Framerate was solid except when loading tutorials where I got complete freezes for 1 sec.

Menues and general control doesn't seem to well polished. For example the postion of the hands seems of and when you hold a shotgun it gets even worse. Grabbing the front to make the pump action is more frustrating than forgiving.
oculus users manually have to enable roomscale. Even though steam detects 3 cams it doesn't cary over automatically.
turning right with a and left with x is a pretty nice addition although weird at first. I would have prefered an implemetation liek in robo recall that makes use of the analog stick you use for teleporting for more than just another lame button.
About the pistols: Why do manufacturers go for a position where the top plate of the rouch controller is level with the horizon to get the gun level with the horizon? the touch controller grip is way more angled than a guns grip and it feels shitty to alway have to angle you wrists o far towards the ground to get it to acctually shoot parallel to you eyes direction. This is just makes it weird and uncomfortable because it wrist overstretches and your hand doesn't feel the same position as it looks in game which is subconciously of-putting and I HATE IT.

I only tried single player so far (until phase 4 of the only mission playable as a new player). I had one texture bug after hitting the wall in the newly opened area when the large robot comes in for the first time (the one shooting rockets in the air) where the wall was sprincled witrh red pixel in a rectangle (not blood-like, like a texture bug!). I liked the sword throwing mechanic though it is impossible for me to accurately hit stuff with it(might be due to the same prboelm that causes the controller pos being of - I will try reseting my camera setup before the next round). The deflecting mechanic was an enjoyable alternative for a melee class to deal with ranged/flying targets. I am not yet sure if pointing your sword in any particular directions makes any difference to the direction you will deflect to though.
Coop and eventually pvp(saw a beta teasered ingame) might be fun but I haven't tried it yet.

So far I do not feel like it is a bad product but that there are som excution errors with the good concepts at hand that could easily be fixed. In short I am not convinced yet that I spent my money wisely.

I will update this as I go and add if I returned it or deciced to keep it.

Whoever finds any typos can keep them.

I tried everything, from closing all apps and services to overclocking, underclocking, etc. I shouldn't even have to, I am using a Titan X Pascal and a i7 4970k with 16gb ram. Even then I tried switching from epic graphics settings to high and medium, the game still crashes no matter what I do.

Being that this is a steam game and I am using the oculus rift, it is also very annoying that the game crashes me back to the oculus home screen, where it is impossible to launch this game again, so I have to take the helmet off and turn my screen on to launch the game with my mouse.

A lot of fun and I am sure the fiinal product will be incredible but right now this game will give you grey hairs due to its instability.

Apologies for the crashing issues you're experiencing with Raw Data.

There is a known issue with the latest Nvidia drivers (version [b]382.33[/b] & [b]382.53[/b]) that is causing the game to crash for our users. This problem is currently being investigated by Epic and Nvidia. 

Could you try rolling back your video card's drivers to an older version, then see if the crashing persists? [b]Note[/b]: Some users have reported that reverting back to driver [b]382.05[/b] has fixed their issue.

Thank you for your patience!"

Defensively, you can teleport, physically dodge kicks, punches, and projectiles, and deflect incoming fire.

The game really requires a larger room (6ft x 6ft or bigger) to really let loose in the game, but you can manage it with a smaller play area. It is hard not to lose track of where the safety grid is, though, with everything going on and how intense the actual gameplay is.

[i]And yes, Melee really does hit you physically, too. :) [/i]

If you have a VR headset and you are looking for something easy to get into, that is 
1. fun
2. easy to learn
3. playable online and in singleplayer
4. running smoothly
5. absolutely beautiful looking
[i]and[/i] mindblowing
then you should buy this game.

Yet, I have an issue.
It may be not so important for others, but I started noticing it.
The sound. I don't play with a headset, so my TV is my output source, but certain [i]important[/i] things are too silent.
Suddenly enemies ran into generators and I didn't know why?
Took me another few level to figure it out.
Yet, it was an issue for me, deciding if I shall go there or not and what it actually does too?
I still don't know that part.

this. it is a wave shooter, but its far from a stand in place let the enemy come to you, no you'll be moving around the map in later stages quite often. 3 characters to choose from, different styles for each, Cleric a pistol weilding maniac, you got your katana wielding melee character, and it wouldnt be a game without a shotgun with a grenade launcher attachment.

gameplay is straightforward, play through each wave of the stage till the mission is over guarding a central node the enemy will be going after, aside from you. each stage however, has its own range of elements.

since you cant be everywhere at once there are various turrets one can build during and between waves to cover a path for you or to simply watch the data node your defending.

probably the only thing i disliked was the price, but after having played it and enjoyed it for 2 straight hours, i can say its got replay value in that 40$.

Unfortunately, I'm an Oculus user and getting Robo Recall for free beats Raw Data, hands down. However, lets be fair and rate this game comparitive to Steam Games.

I understand some users like myself still ache for a triple A game but till that day comes, this game is the closest you will get. Also note that this game was the reason I bought VR. Below are the Pros and Cons.

Pros:
- Myriad of differrent abilities that allows you to test the VR feedback mechanism of your room setup
- Fine tuned graphics with adept ighting for gorgeous backdrops as well as close lit setting
- Exceellent response to actions allowing fast paced combat
- Generous character development with light grinding
- Unrivalled Multiplayer comparitive to current VR games
- Continuous updates with excellent dev market strategies to keep the game flowing with new users
- Pristine community still fresh of the boat with good co op dynamics allowing for better community make up (Never had a toxic player ever)
- Construction mechanics for assistance
- Deathcam is hilarous

Cons:
- Static maps per game session (This ultimately gives Raw data that test demo feeling and not triple A material)
- Hard on resources (Whether a 2 sensor setup or low GPU standard, you will encounter bugs that will break immersion)
- Only 2 players allowed ( I truly wish there would be a 3 or even 4 group make up per game session with this much multiplayer finish)
- Repetitive waves when you played long enough, it would have been better if I could travel to a different area and solve puzzles as a team or solo (Only 1 map allows this so far and that too only 1 puzzle)
- Limited Objectives variability (Mostly defending certain hotspots, but does have instadeath laser dodging and 1 puzzle) They could expand further on this like picking up  quest items for puzzles, grabbing dead units for cube healing, hyper mode where you get 2nd life if you've killed high number of units before death
- No life or gear character upgrades that would give variability within a round or throughout the game (Stealing robot components for armor, hacking for homing projectiles or assistance, shield mechanics, cube sustainability, etc)

Its still EA thus the cons I mentioned really just need time to be developed. For the price tag, I've paid higher for simpler mechanics but we have to keep in mind VR is in prestige mode at the moment, like buying the latest phone, car or gadget that will lose value over time.

Don't let you fool by the wave shooter label. Yes, ist is some kind of wave shooter, but not the one, that let's you just stand in one position and shoot enemy waves. In fact, this game has more to do with the horde mode you get in a game like Gears Of War. So you have a level to jump arround (smooth locomotion is not supported) and fight waves of enemies. The game practicaly never keeps you trapped in just one position. 

The better you play, the more credits you earn. With this credits you can buy weapon tourets or shields and other helpfull stuff to place inside the levels. These things will help you to fight the enemy waves. Talking about the enemies: The developers mix this up on this front and you have to fight all kinds of robots and flying drones - some just run at you, some shoot guns, some have a rocket launcher, some are as tall as a house. 

The game is still in early access but allready offers a lot of content. You can play as one of three characters with different weapons and abilities. Every character can learn new skills throughout the game, so you can level up and become stronger. Probably the best thing is, that you can play every mission in coop with one other player, so you can combine the abilities of different characters. There are always players online and many of them are ready to join you in a coop mission.

Unlike many other VR games you get a lot of playtime out of this. There are quite a few levels and some of them take a good amount of time to complete. The replayability is high too and since it is still early access, there might be even more to come.

Graphics are good, so is most of the level design. The game runs very well on my Radeon R9 390 so players with a stronger GPU might probably get even better visuals. 

So if you are new to VR and ask yourself, if this game is worth the money: Yes, abolutely! Just give it a try, no matter if you own an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive.

Early on you get to choose between 3 characters each with different weapons, the first mission is simple, nothing to defend except to stay alive.  Allows you to learn the basics after the brief tutorial.  Then they add a defense objective to keep alive and then they add basic turrets.  

The VR is done great, you have your basic room scale movement to crouch behind cover, to dodge bullets or small movements to get better angles.  Then you can teleport around to get to various areas of the battlefield, to lay turrets and such.  Teleporting can either be wherever you want or long distances by the way of beacons.  There is enough happening to keep you busy but not enough to completely overwhelm you.  Difficulty settings are great, normal is very well balanced for 1 person.  Also the game has 4 player co-op!

To add on to the VR experience the weapons act about as you would expect a weapon to.  Initially you have to reload the pistol by grabbing ammo from your non dominant side and bring it to the bottom of the gun.  You can hold the melee character's sword two handed style for extra damage and the shotgun is a pump action shotgun that needs to be manually pumped.  All characters also have skills such as a pistol skill that temporarily gives unlimted ammo in automatic firing mode.

My only real con for this game is the price.  39.99 for an early access game is steep but the game is VR and the game seems to have 8 levels with 3 different characters.  The developers are already working on a 4th character with a bow and it does have multiplayer and 4 different difficulty levels though I'm not sure if the last difficulty level requires beating the game or if it isn't implemented.

Raw Data is still in early access, so there will definitely be more content coming down the road, which will include new levels that are more complex.

Did you get a chance to play any of the later missions, such as Nuke Fusion? 
These levels really incorporate the tower-defense element of the game.

The atmosphere is just thrilling.

I usually really try to get immersed in the VR world, so that my experience would feel as genuine as possible, but this game pulled me in with no effort whatsoever. Definitely worth the price.

Pros:
*Interesting premise. A large robotics industry planning to take over the world with robots that were supposed to serve the humans, and you get to uncover the truth, by being in the first one to confront them- sounds like that movie i-Robot. 
*Very good visuals (high textures, good contrast and lighting)
*Very good animations and effects (robots react to shots, can be dismembered, pleasing headshot splatter effects)
*Great soundtracks. Matches the atmosphere and really builds up the tension and stress, which just adds to the experience.
*Can play in co-op- share the thrill!

Cons:
*Wish there was some limit to how far or how frequently you can teleport, because a lot of the time it feels like too much of an advantage to zap around enemies, never letting them get too close. Makes me feel too safe, knowing I can get away with a push of a button at any time.
*Needs more ways to defend yourself so you don't have to always rely on teleporting to safety (like shields, magnetic grenades that either slow or divert enemy movement, use dead robot bodies as cover by picking up and holding, or smth).
*Needs more weapons, and ability to switch between weapons during a mission, and make each robot type have a weakness against certain weapons, so that switching between weapons is encouraged for efficiency.
*I know this is supposed to be a horde shooter, but it would be nice to have a point to point A--->B type of level design, where you're trying to escape, or maybe infiltrate deeper through series of grab and run objectives that always keep you on your feet and alert.
*More ways to promt the user to move, lean, duck, reach out. If teleporting wasn't such an advantage then maybe one on one fighting mechanics could be made more interesting.

Thank you for trying out the game over the free weekend.

The graphics are great, gameplay is fun (especially multiplayer).
I would like to see more impact interaction with the robots though.  Usually, the sword goes right through them without any physical blowback or effects.  It would be cool to be able to cut robots as you slash them.
The movement system is quite disorienting.  You move by pressing the left joystick (Oculus) and turn 90° by pressing buttons.   I wouldn't say that's very intuitive.
I don't see why we can't both turn and move with one stick just like in Robo Recall.
But enough complaining...  This game was worth the money.
The difficulty is quite hard so it keeps you coming back for more.

[h1]One of the best wave shooter experiences for the Vive.[/h1]

Raw Data has a slow, seemingly broken intro level (damn hand scanner), but once you make your way into the actual lobby and play some missions, it quickly becomes a lot of fun and stays that way.  The story is pretty much a pattern of extracting data and defending your little, circular area.  It's quite fun, but it's also somewhat repetitive.  A variety of enemy types are thrown into the battle, so if you thought the iconic android character was the only thing you'd be fighting, think again.  There are some bulky, armored types and some flying drones along with some variations of the three.  There may even be more later in the game or in later updates.

I was able to watch a friend play several Phases on his Vive, so I'm confident in my review.

The game is incredibly well constructed and while linear in concept and repetitive in play, bears all the hallmarks of a AAA title. The voice work seems solid, the graphics are clean and crisp, and the play is focused. Locomotion is handled by teleportation, so no VR sickness here. Most of the time you stand stationary and crouch or turn so the game has focused on one thing and done it well. There are bugs, but as of this review, they seem minor.

The animations of the enemies are beautifully rendered and while the ""blood"" nee ""hydraulic fluid"" makes me laugh every time I see it, it manages to keep the title at a PG-13 level. This game is also very physical, so I would steer clear if you're a disabled VR player - a LOT of dodging and two-handed play is required.

All around, this is a great title if you like shooters, swinging a sword, and/or shotguns and grenades. Given my personal crashing issues with a moderate VR computer, I'd say that you want a higher end VR-ready computer on this title.

Definitely worth the price of admission if you have a friend to play with. A little on the pricy side if you don't have someone you know has a copy and is up for covering your back.",1491473198,1491473559,True,1,0,0.52396005392074585,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Seit ein paar Patches läuft es bei mir auch richtig sauber.
Hab eine i7 6700k 16gb ram und ne asus 1070. Ich kann es flüssig auf high mit 1.4x Supersampling spielen.

- Es gibt jetzt schon 3 heros die mitlerweile ziemlich ausgereift sind.
- Viele Fähigkeiten zum freischalten, schwer zu meistern.
-  8  Missionen, sie werden vom Gameplay fordernder und besser je weiter man im Spiel kommt.
- Fortbewegung funktioniert über ""Teleshift"". Es ist wie ein schneller nach vorne fliegen, durch clever eingesetzte effekte    ist es gut verträglich und fühlt sich deutlich besser an als der klassische teleport. Auch ist man dadurch schön schnell was dem Spiel eine gute dynamik gibt.
- Es hat eine witzige story die aber fast nur über die Gespräche zwischen deinem Operator und der Ki Simon erzählt wird
-Koop gameplay

Mindestens ein Held und eine Mission werden noch dazu gepatcht.

I've been following it since release, and await each new content update with bated breath.

What is so good about it? Well, I'm glad you asked!
The reason isn't any single feature, but how it masterfully blends all of its elements:
[list]
    [*]Action-packed, immersive 360° gameplay with great controls.
    [*]High-end visuals and audio with a high overall production quality (this also applies to the voice acting).
    [*]Full co-op support, which makes everything better, but VR even better[i]er[/i].
    [*]A large amount of content with great replayablility and lots of variety, both in missions and in playable characters.
    [*]Weapons and a wide variety of skills that feel great to use, and also all have a meaningful impact on gameplay.
    [*]Perhaps most importantly, a nicely balanced difficulty progression and multi-faceted possibilities for improving your skill.
[/list]

That last point is something that you might also call gameplay [i]depth[/i], but I wanted to be precise since that term gets thrown around a lot. What I mean by it is that there are many ways to improve how you play the game. You can improve your performance in terms of action gameplay, how well you use your weapons and skills and how quickly you can detect and dispatch enemies. You can improve your strategy: where do you position yourself, when do you use time-limited skills, which enemies do you attack first, who covers which area in coop. Finally, you can also greatly improve your play by increasing your meta-knowledge of the game. Learn the maps, spawn points, the exact behaviour of each enemy type, and mission-specific challenges.

And what is truly crucial here is that all improving in any and all of these is extremely rewarding.",1489698434,1489700486,True,25,0,0.704906582832336426,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Pros:
This is more developed than a large percentage of games available for VR.
Unlike most wave-survival shooters, you can actually move around.

Cons:
It's a wave-survival shooter, which I personally have seen too much of at this point.
There's something about the combat style I don't like, at least when using the sword.  I'm not even sure what it is, but it feels like the room-scale version of button mashing, if that makes sense.
The tutorials are tedious.
There should be a better explanation for how multiplayer works.
Level 2, ""dark source"", is the most annoying game level since the ""follow the train"" level from San Andreas.  That level alone makes me never want to play this game again.

Sorry to hear you're experiencing this crashing issue with the game.

Would you mind supplying us with the following information:
[list]
    [*]Are you prompted with the Unreal Engine Crash Reporter when Raw Data crashes on you?
    [*]If so, could you add your SteamID to the crash reporter dialogue, as well as what hero/map you were playing at the time?
    [*]What are the specs of the system you're running the game on?
[/list]
Also, there's currently a known issue where Steam VR's asynchronous reprojection causes Raw Data to freeze/crash on some systems.

After playing it for some time, I honestly don't understand what everyone thinks was so great about it. 

The Pros: 
1: It looks fantastic. Easily one of the best games graphically speaking.
2: The game is very polished. Smooth gameplay and menu system. 
3: A good challenge, definitely easy to get swarmed. 

The Cons: 
1: Characters: The trailer for this makes it seem like you have access to a variety of weapons (Pistols, sword, etc.), but really you have access to three characters that have a specific weapon they can use. Was fairly disappointing. 

2: Enemies: The enemies were immensely boring. Think of it as the iRobot movie, but the enemies walk at a Star Wars battle droid rate. Sometimes a big one shows up. No unique characteristic, just big. Some do actually shoot at you. Somehow they were all just very....blah. 

3: Weapons Gameplay: The only weapons/character you ever have to use is the Pistol Expert. Using anyone else is fairly pointless. The sword/saber gameplay is terrible. You can stand in one place and gently wave it around like an orchestra composer and do better then if you were actually trying to use it as a sword. Then proceed to stand around waiting until you're surrounded since the enemies only approach in large clumps. 

4: Controls: The shotguns two hand grip controls are very intermittent. You have to ""grab"" the pump to hold the gun. You also have to ""grab"" the ammo off of your back to reload it.  There are two different controller schemes. One to click and hold the grip button to grab something, the other to toggle on/off. So you have the choice of potentially dropping your magazine while reloading, or being glued to your shotgun. The game can get very hectic and this setup causes nightmare when you're trying to be quick. 


Despite the cons, it is an excellent looking, well polished game that was definitely well developed. However, after giving it a fairly long chance (~5hrs) it got very boring very fast. It also never actually got engaging. In the first ten minutes I reached my conclusion as to how lame the enemies were. I had heard so many good things about this, and yet I was honestly forcing myself to play it after the first two hours.

游戲特色/優點
★3A級游戲畫面
用虛幻引擎4打造的虛擬實境畫面被這款神作發揮得淋漓盡致，從地圖場景到各種各樣的敵人怪物，從手中的武器到虛擬手臂到身邊與你并肩作戰的夥伴等，逼真程度已然是3A水準，讓你幾乎遺忘了現實世界的存在。(説句實話我玩這款游戲一直撞到現實世界的墻壁 xD)

★優化極佳
目前i7+gtx1070跑最高畫面外加1.3倍率解析度甚至同時開OBS直播，能完美維持在60~90fps，可見他們對遊戲優化下足了功夫，不必再害怕掉幀引起的動態眩暈了。

★劇情/世界觀設定細緻
雖然現在的劇情并沒有開發完成，但從目前角色之間的對話與各種地圖任務中已經能看出非常多的世界觀暗示與角色的背景故事，你甚至還能在大廳中看到整個未來都市的樣貌，可見開發者之用心。

★多元化的武器、技能與角色
從時而高速掃射，時而蓄力攻擊的雙槍鬥士Bishop，到在格反子彈之餘穿梭於敵陣中砍殺敵人的太刀劍客Saiji，到時而控制重力抵禦敵人，時而抽出重型散彈槍與榴彈發射器毀滅一切的重裝兵BOSS，甚至還有使用高科技弓箭精準射穿敵人頭部的弓箭手。
在玩家扮演這些酷炫角色的同時還能利用不同的技能組合來打出自己的風格，每一場游戲都會帶給你不一樣的新體驗。

★多元化的關卡與敵人
從炮灰小兵到手持機關槍的危險炮兵；從空戰飛機到火箭炮機器人，各種敵人之間都有著明確的特色與變化，應對方法也各有不同，一物剋一物，配合角色、武器、技能，還有自己的風格，每一場游戲都是史詩級的挑戰與殺敵饗宴。

★收集、建造與解鎖 / RPG與戰略要素
所有關卡完成後都能解鎖各種不同的科技，這些科技大多是解鎖角色技能，部分則是解鎖能在關卡中使用的各類炮塔，從防護罩炮塔到激光槍炮塔應有盡有，能在任務中幫你防守特定的危險區域。而關卡中擊殺怪物都會獲得能建造炮塔的素材，讓你在回合與回合之間的休息時間與隊友擬定計劃來抵禦下一波的攻勢。



▽線上人數少，連線問題較多
雖然近期推出了連線大廳系統，但實際上並沒有真正解決部分斷線與延遲嚴重的問題，若和附近的人玩問題還不算大，但如果連到對岸甚至國外的玩家就基本上慘不忍睹了。

▽遊戲內容開發進度極慢
我能理解一個獨立開發公司想做3A級遊戲的苦衷，但你可以從他們的新聞中大概看到大多數都是他們在參加展覽或活動的消息，希望他們有足夠的人手可以在參加活動之餘開發新內容-_-

I'm glad I did.

So, first off, thanks @Survios_CS for the tip, deleting the .ini files reset whatever it was that had been screwed up, and for following up a few days later with a comment (didn't even see that until just now, sorry).

Raw Data still has a few things that can be improved (it's still ridiculous that you have to agree to the EULA every time you want to play, the tutorials could use some work, and the single-player game doesn't pause when you hit the menu button), but despite that, it's one of the more well-polished games out there.

One of the best points is that the controls are very accurate without making it too easy. The difference between blocking projectiles and getting hit seems realistic, i.e. it's not enough to just face in the right direction, but the projectiles are slow enough to give you a chance to get the katana in the right spot. The ability to teleport short distances gives you a great advantage over the AI bots, but I'm guessing they'll get progressively harder in later missions. The graphics are very nice, with a modern/futuristic look, and just looking down at your virtual hands is pretty impressive. There's a good mix of action and strategy, and so far it hasn't gotten boring despite being yet another wave-survival kind of game.

Happy to change my vote from a thumbs down to a thumbs up, especially since it's an early access game, so I guess bugs are to be expected, and given that it seems to be quite actively developed, I'm sure it'll just continue to get better.",1487489210,1491059422,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,True,False,,1487616998.0,"Hey aaamos,

There seems to be a lot of potential here, but it was wasted on me, because of a few glaring issues that I ran into early on.

First, I feel like there was an incredible disconnect between the framing of the Tutorials and the actual gameplay. The tutorials happen in an incredibly safe environment, and give you a very basic understanding of how to fight, and dont really give you any understanding of how the enemies are going to approach you. For example, one robot will stand stationary in a room, and you take a few shots at it. Then, the very first level totally throws you in at the deep end. Robots start spawning all around me, faster that I can take them out, and moving towards me like a hoard of zombies - I was not expecting this game to give me the same kind of anxiety as The Brookhaven Experiment, and I quickly felt overwhelmed. I was not prepared, and it was a really negative experience.

Next, there were a few mechanics that were just plain uncomfortable, and I felt were really bad implementations in VR.

I spent a bit of time in the tutorial area, where all movement was teleportation based, and felt good. Then when selecting a level, the 'loading' transition was an elevator that moved down suddenly - with no warning, it almost made me fall down. 

FInally, it may seem like a small quirk, but probably my biggest problem with the game was an action that one enemy did... There's a type of 'ninja' robot that cloaks, and dashes around to avoid your fire. Several times it dashed up fairly close to me, attacked, then ran away - but at one point it walked up close to me, attacked, and as I was returning fire it dashed THROUGH me, to the other side - Maybe this wont bother everyone, and may seem inconsiquential - but with the level of immersion in VR games, this just mentally hit me like a ton of bricks, and my brain didn't know how to deal with this stimulus - This one tiny action made me feel confused, disoriented, frustrated, and angry.

I think there is a good game here somewhere, but buried under a poorly thought out VR experience. I can't recommend it to anyone who experiences any level of discomfort in VR - I was able to handle more time in Windlands and Brookhaven than Raw Data.",1486326017,1486326017,False,1,0,0.447676002979278564,6,True,False,True,False,,1486413290.0,"Hey Blaaguuu,

Sorry to see you had a negative experience with the game.

Raw Data is still in Early Access so there will definitely be more content coming down the pipeline. You can take a look at our initial publicized roadmap [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/436320/announcements/detail/961899992398827241] here.[/url]
You'll notice there's still 5 missions missing, as well as a new hero. Also, this roadmap was more of a rough prediction, so some new things may be added :)

If you have any further feedback on how to improve the overall experience for Raw Data, you can submit your thoughts through our [url=https://survios.com/rawdata/feedback/] Feedback Form.[/url]

Best regards,
