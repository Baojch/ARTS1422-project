There is unfortunatly no controller support but keyboard but none are needed for standard playback features. Just gaze to navigate folders and play, pause, volume, cinema lighting effects and exit. For extra features like seat position Stereoscopic modes require keyboard input or software like Controller Companion to map the controls to.
It is out of every Cinema app I've tried (Oculus video and a few others), the one that puts you in a setting. The animations in the scenes let you know you are not just straped in to a static enviroment.

First, know that I loved this as a Google Cardboard app.  It was a good video player for a rather limited VR device.  I enjoyed it if not for the hard to read text, and the stare-at-options UI was acceptable for such a simple device. That said, the app hasn't changed its UI from the phone to the Vive, and that's where it suffers the most.  The UI requires the user to stare at options to click them.  That both shows down the user and makes the scene a little cluttered.  The user should have better interactivity options in such an app on the Vive, but unfortunately, Cineveo does not even try to offer options.  I hope they add controller support and the ability to disable the stare-at menu controls sometime in the future.

The video playback is also very hit-or-miss.  It plays some videos just fine, but other videos seem to play at double the speed.  I tried slowing it down but could not find the option in the playback controls.  There's no playlist option for setting up the playlist before entering the theater.  You simply drop files into the app's videos directory.  That makes me slightly disappointed considering I have a ton of videos categorized into folders in my ""My Videos"" folder in Windows. I would prefer not to have to move files around just to choose which videos to have the app default to.  It does not play videos in sequence, either, forcing me to open a menu screen to start the next video.  SBS 3D did not seem possible, but I have no SBS 3D videos other than Sintel, so I'm fine with that.  The MKV update was very welcome as I was not 

The visuals of this app are very immersive... if not for some strange scenery choices.    The plain theater mode offers a nice theater room, similar to something out of an actual theater... except there's a bright hallway right behind your seat!  I don't understand its purpose, and it looks totally out of character for the theater to have a hallway of posters sticking right out of it with no doors and no stairs.

If you don't know how to instal a codec well...the problem is yours. There are also instrucions on the website and in the manual.

In my opinion, ""CINEVEO - VR Cinema"" offers the BEST VR CINEMA EXPERIENCE so far, and especially for the 3D movies. It features a fully functional multiplayer movie theater in virtual reality, and you can even choose your seat!
The ""spherical Section"" curved screen is simply amazing.

While it is true that ""Simple VR Video Player"" is the best VR video player on the market, it does NOT yet provide the best EXPERIENCE when whatching movies, and especially for 3D movies.
In order to fully ""catch"" the full depth of a 3D scene, your brain needs to ""compare"" the scene with som surrounding object...which you don't have in the black environment (nor in any of the other environments in ""Simple VR Video Player"").

The movie theatre environment(s) in CINEVEO, plus the super cool ""spherical Section"" curved screen provide the best CR cinema experience so far.

However, there is still a lot to be improved.
First of all, being forced to use a a keyboard in VR while wearing a headset is really really bad. It is very annoying and frustrating. Very clunky controls, no controler or oculus remote support.

Feedback for the developer:

User interface - please allow me to use my mouse. The ""head look""/arrow keys movie selection is not as comfortable to use as with a mouse (I'd love to see my desktop, as in Virtual Desktop/ BigScreen, and open my files from there). I'd also like to be able to control movie playback using my mouse. It would be good to see all the hot-key options in the virtual interface, so that I'm not trying every key on the keyboard to work out which key changes the screen/ moves me around/ etc.

Media files - I don't want to make copies of files in the Cineveo media directory. For some reason once the file selection process encounters a directory with video files, it no longer allows me to select subdirectories in that directory which contain the actual video files I want to watch - there's no way to reach these files in Cineveo.

Other - The ""speeding down the tunnel"" sequence after file selection made me feel a bit nauseous and isn't what I'm looking for when I just want to watch a movie - can you add an ""options"" menu to allow me to permanently disable this sequence?",1465388701,1468106871,True,2,0,0.500608980655670166,1,False,False,False,False,,,

1. Does not work without internet(regardless of steam being in offline mode), which makes no sense to me as one of its selling points is the ability to play local content.

2. Controls are a bit sensitive, when inside VR. Trying to navigate around through various local directories, can be a bit frustrating. Would be nice if it supported the wireless hand controller with the oculus rift.

Update(from Cineveo)Regarding your point #2. The ""VR File Browser"" can also be navigated using the keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left, right). Give it a try. You will see it's much easier and faster.

3. Be aware that there are limitations in regards to file name length, when trying to find your local files. (looked like 32 characters, but did not count it)

Läuft ein Film erst einmal, bietet dieses VR Kino das beste Erlebnis.
Insbesondere die Wahl der verschiedenen ""Orte"" ist sehr detailiert und nett umgesetzt, so dass man sich wohl fühlt.
Im Gegensatz zu anderen ""Kino""-Anwendungen, hat man hier tatsächlich das Gefühl im Kino zu sitzen und nicht irgendwo im nichts oder in seltsamen Umgebungen.

Mein größter Kritikpunkt ist allerdings die Steuerung. Gerade bei der HTC Vive hätte man viel mehr die Motion-Controller statt der Navigation per Tastatur/HMD/Controller nutzen können. Dies würde die Navigation erheblich vereinfachen.
Man kann sich zwar an die Steuerung gewöhnen, aber es ist trotzdem jedesmal nervig mit dem Kopf hin und her zu wackeln. Gerade bei der Auswahl von einem Film gestaltet sich dies immer als schwierig. Ebenso muss man einige Tasten auswendig können, damit man z.Bsp. bei SBS den Film auch in 3D erleben kann.

Wenn die Navigation noch deutlich verbessert wird, wäre dies die unangefochten beste VR-Kino-Erlebnis-Anwendung.

Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt ist die schiere Größe der Anwendung. Insgesamt belegt CINEVO 14GB. So manches AAA Spiel erreicht eine solche Größe nicht. Dies liegt hauptsächlich daran, dass die Anwendung für Android Cardboard, Oculus 0.6, Oculus 1.3 und HTC Vive ausgeliefert wird. Bei letzteren ist die jeweilige Größe knapp 5GB, da es jedesmal ein eigenes Programm ist.

The screen clearity is fantastic, plays smoothly and works wonderfully. At first I thought they enviroments would get in the way of the movie experience, but when I'm watching movies, game videos i've downloaded, and other stuff: I hardly notice the backgrounds.

You can also zoom way in when using a specific enviroment to make the movie cover your entire view. With this setting it's very emerssive. I'd say this is a great buy!

Theatre is well made (graphically pleasing) + ambient lighting that is linked to the image on screen is great
No Need to use keyboard and mouse everything can be navigated with gaze detection
Smooth Experience no judder at all 
Subtitle Support

CONS:
0.7 runtime is very limited at the moment still waiting for update (cannot choose other theaters except main beta version)
There was one tvshow that started with low frame rate only on the screen not the theatre and took about 10 minutes to become smooth again
You have to boot the theater instead of selecting one in the application seems like friction in the User Experience (have to choose one when right clicking in steam)
Navigating menus inside the application to find the folder where you have your movies/shows is a bit tedious. Also if the movie or folder name is long it will be cut off without no option to see the rest. Makes episode finding difficult

Other than the organization structure of the menu. This application is very functional and frankly the best one out even with all the shortcomings. Also its the only movie theatre VR application that works with the latest oculus runtime as of now (10/1/2015). 10 dollars is a fair price but I just wish there was more organization when selecting media.

I know the majority of its updates and upgrades over time. This review is about the Steam version.

In summary i recommend this game because it's one of the best virtual reality cinema and is continuously update adding more themes, improvements or fixing bugs

Pros
+ Six different styles of cinemas. Each one with their only graphics and atmosphere. The 4D Cinema has lights that changes color depending of the video (4D ambient light)
+ Supports multiple video format. They recommend LAV Filter for maximum performance and quality. For the moment it doesn't support (yet) m2ts videos
+ Navigation with the head is simple and intuitive. With exception of some options (like enable 3D, restart viewport, etc), the majority of the functions doesn't require keyboard interaction.
+ Subtitle support, but for the moment only in SRT format.

Cons
- Each cinema has their own folder to storage videos. Although you can select any folder in your computer without using the movies folder.
- Doesn't support long file names. File names in the movies folder only shows the first 13 characters. In the folder navigation it shows 20.
- You can't change skin ingame, you need to close and then select another theme.
- It only show the first four videos in the movies folder.",1430456486,1632543095,True,4,0,0.538233518600463867,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Love this product and so happy its now available as something that can be added to my steam library. Since I started watching my movies through this on my Oculus DK2 I really have trouble even thinking about just going back to watching movies on a standard flat screen.
Its hard to explain it if you have never used an Oculus , but when you watch movies using Cineveo it really is like being at the movies watching your favorite films on a big screen. And just like the movies , if you pick a seat right up front you will have to look left and right to catch all the action lol.

The different enviroments are great too , although myself I tend to stick to the classic big screen cinema room but I did have a laugh watching Gravity 3D while using the space station setting.
I do tend to get quite drawn in when using my oculus to the point I forget I am wearing it sometimes. I keep a drink behind me on a shelf while watching films and I often catch myself turning around expecting to see it sitting there lol.
The handsfree interface is a great feature too , being able to navigate without having to remove the rift is a bonus.

Few things to mention to offset a couple of the negative reviews.

1) You dont need to use shortcuts to start the different enviroments , this can be done by right clicking cineveo in steam and picking which one you want to launch.

2) Yes you need a codec pack but all are free and chances are if you watch movies from the internet then you already have a codec pack installed.

(I have had it for more than half a year before it has arrived on Steam)

It really works, and they have done tons of updates over time that have really refined the product (which makes it great that it is on Steam now, easy updates).
As an example, tharcod complained in his review that launching the app was amateurish, and boom one day later they fixed that by offering more launch options from Steam directly (okay, they should have done that from the start of course...).

I actually agreed with almost everything tharcod says otherwise in his negative review. The launching is improved already, but that you have to actively have to read through an entire manual to see how to install the necessary codecs is also not a good first experience (I can understand they can't include those codecs, but come on give a 5 line text-file with just the actions you need to do).

The actual movie selection is really hard too, that is actually what I would like to see improved most. In movie the shortcuts are very good though (as in you can easily control the movie viewing experience once you know the keys).

When I bought it in August 2014 I looked at several players and back then this was the only one that worked. I don't know how the app-landscape has changed since then, because I did not need to look, because CineVeo works for me (also because I don't use it that often admittedly).

There are a few things that need to be done before this app is really ready for prime time. 

This is delivered as a folder.  In the folder, there are two separate Unity executables for each of six environments.  And then there's an additional batch file to support DirectX 11.  It requires installation of a specific CODEC pack from GitHub in order to operate, and overall is at a quality similar to the Multiplayer Theater demo that is available for free.

At the very least, take half an hour, write a launcher.  Put a button to download the required CODEC pack, have Steam launch that by default.  

Use Environment.GetSpecialFolder and ask for videos -- look for the movies there.  If you're not going to do that, then at least use a single movies folder for all the environments.  But using the folder under Steam versus the user's Video folder (or any user specified folder) is something that is going to annoy users.

Think about if you really need 12 separate executables here -- that cannot be pleasant to maintain in Unity.  Those scenes can all be in a single executable, and you can use LoadLevel to load the level you want.  So instead of separate executables, make one executable.

At that point you need a menu -- there are a lot of good Oculus-enabled menus in the Unity asset store, and the default Unity UI is workable as well.  Basically, if you're going to ask for money you need to be a cut above the tech demos in the forums, for free, at the Oculus forums.

Keep in mind, Oculus is currently a developer only club -- developers are going to hold you to a higher standard than traditional users may, usually, and are going to have seen the various demos on the Oculus site most likely.  I know it's the first thing that I did after I unboxed my Oculus -- install the SDK, look at what people are uploading, see ""hey, I should do that.""
