This technique could really work and deliver some pretty cool looking visuals if done right.   This was not done right.  It looks blurry, fuzzy, and clunky, a byproduct of low quality source pictures, and low resolution delivery.

Poor visuals aside, the gameplay itself is on par... really low quality puzzle solving 2D adventure game stuff.  You'd be much better off playing a remastered Monkey Island or Kings Quest game if you're looking for nostalgia. 

The mobile app is very very short and can be finished in under an hour.  I'm not advocating anyone should do this (I certainly didn't, as you can see), it wouldn't be right, but it's possible to buy the game, finish and refund in less than the 2 hour refund window on Steam.  That aside, developers have at least some responsibility to provide enough content to make a game last more than 2 hours if they're serious about providing something of value to gamers.  There's less content here than some free game demos.

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

Some of the defects in the mobile app can be attributed to the choice of using the video game library/engine, 3D GameStudio.  It's rarely used, because it's arguably worse than construction kits like GameMaker Studio, RPGMaker and Clickteam Fusion, but it's also much harder to work with.  Despite this, 3D GameStudio has very limited capabilities, which go some way to explaining the poor quality of the mobile app.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the mobile app is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  ""Lost in Paradise"" has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the mobile app absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for finishing the first simple ""puzzle"" in the game within 60 seconds, trivial to achieve, but less than 5 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the mobile app.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this mobile app was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the mobile app.  But this only happened once, and isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 5 percent of players bothered playing the mobile app for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this mobile app to have so many concurrent players who didn't bother engaging with this mobile app?  Trading cards.  People will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.

That tells us people only really bought this mobile app for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the mobile app just has a couple of players every week running up the mobile app and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many mobile apps like this, with little merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

So, should you buy this mobile app?

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $3 USD, on app stores, it's $2 USD. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a premium for a cheap mobile app just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this is a mobile app, is priced to insult and gouge PC gamers, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Adventure from 2015.

Immerse yourself in a lost paradise that hides a deep secret behind its pristine shores. (Developer)

A point & click survival game with really good graphics for the time. A story that is really boring. This is very difficult to read. Everything in cursive.
The individual cards are almost empty in terms of content. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but without using your eyes to help you find almost nothing unless it's lying around in plain sight.

Very repressive gameplay. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing per se. However, the implementation in the game leads to frustration and constant pointless running back and forth.

There is also a help function that can be used throughout the game. However, it will help you little or not at all. As an example, you should light a fire. Finding the fireplace was no problem; Finding dry branches is not difficult either. Flint can also be found. So work on the flint with a stone that you can find. Great, now I have tees and a knife. Edit the wooden branches, great now I have arrows. But I need something that I can use as Tinder. There is nothing lying around on any of the cards, using the eye of course. So use the help, it says “read up” on a piece of paper that you found. Yes, and there you will find exactly what you have already done and are looking for. A great help without any benefit.
I've been to a number of Caribbean islands, large and small. Finding brushwood for a fire isn't a problem at all, actually.
No matter, just think your part.

There are a lot of negative reviews, no guide, no video for the game. I absolutely do not recommend this game and will add a negative review. The reason is simple.
Totally messed up gameplay.

[h1] Lost in Paradise [/h1]
Abenteuer von 2015.

Tauchen Sie ein in ein verlorenes Paradies, das ein tiefes Geheimnis hinter seinen unberührten Ufern versteckt. ( Entwickler)

Ein Point & Klick Überlebensspiel mit für die damalige Zeit wirklich guter Grafik. Einer Geschichte die echt öde ist. Diese ist sehr schlecht lesbar. Alles in Schreibschrift.
Die einzelnen Karten sind fast leer vom Inhalt her. Das ist nicht unbedingt schlecht, jedoch ohne die Nutzung des Auges als Hilfe findest du beinahe nix, es sei denn es liegt offen herum. 

Sehr repressiver Spielablauf. Was per se ja auch nicht unbedingt schlecht ist. Jedoch führt die Umsetzung im Game zu Frust und ständigen sinnlosen hin und her laufen.

Es gibt auch eine Hilfefunktion, die im ganzen Spiel nutzbar ist. Jedoch hilft sie dir nur wenig bis gar nicht. Als Beispiel, Du sollst ein Feuer machen. Die Feuerstelle zu finden, kein Problem; trokene Äste finden, auch nicht schwer. Feuerstein lässt sich auch finden. Also den Feuerstein bearbeiten mit einem Stein den du auch finden kannst. Toll nun hab ich Abschläge und ein Messer. Die Holzäste Bearbeiten, Prima nun hab ich Pfeile. Aber ich brauche etwas das ich als Zunder Nutzen kann. Es liegt auf keiner der Karten was rum, mit Nutzung des Auges natürlich. Also die Hilfe Nutzen, dort steht ""lese nach"" auf einem Zettel den du gefunden hast. Ja und da steht dann genau das was du schon gemacht hast und auch suchst. Eine gandiose Hilfe ohne Nutzen.
Ich war schon auf etlichen Karibik Inseln, großen und kleinen. Reisig zu finden für ein Feuer ist gar kein Problem, eigentlich. 
Na egal, denkt euch einfach euren Teil dazu.

Es gibt eine Menge negativ Reviews, keine Guide, kein Video zum Game. Ich Empfehle dieses Spiel absolut nicht und füge noch ein negativ Review hinzu. Der Grund ist einfach. 
Total vermurkstes Gameplay.

L'histoire n'est pas des plus intéressante, l'introduction se résume à des écrits en caractères manuscrits pas toujours simples à lire. Le personnage est rigide, moche et limite robotique dans sa démarche et ses actions.

Graphiquement il n'y a rien d'époustouflant, l'environnement me semble être conçu avec des photos de paysages (libres de droit), la musique quand à elle est relaxante et colle bien au jeu.

Au niveau des énigmes, rien de bien transcendant ou corsé, cela me fais penser à celles de mauvais jeux d'objets cachés (genre bigfish et j'en passe...) elles se résument le plus souvent à reconstituer une image avec des pièces de puzzles et ce le plus rapidement possible si l'on souhaite obtenir les succès qui y sont liés.

Au niveau des interactions, il suffit de collecter quelques objets pour les utiliser ensuite afin de crafter des objets (couteau, corde, allumer un feu....) tout coule de sens et rien ou presque ne viendra vous bloquer ou vous demander de longues réflexions.
Certaines actions ont clairement été faites pour tablette ou téléphone tactile et ça ne fonctionne pas tellement bien sur pc (ex : pour lancer une corde sur le rivage d'en face, il faudra faire glisser le curseur comme avec le doigt sur un écran tactile).

Le plus gros du problème avec ce jeu est que vu que l'environnement se décline en photos de paysages, on ne sais pas où cliquer pour faire avancer notre personnage, on ne sais pas non plus (par exemple dans la forêt) où peuvent se trouver les objets potentiellement cliquables. 
Fort heureusement il est possible de dévoiler tous les points nécessitant une interaction en cliquant sur l'oeil en haut à gauche mais de ce fait tout y est trop simple et il n'y a rien d'amusant à devoir constamment appuyer sur cet oeil pour progresser.

De surcroît, des bugs sont à déplorer, je suis restée coincée 2 ou 3 fois sans pouvoir cliquer nulle part, ni même quitter le jeu, (cela s'est produit une fois le didacticiel terminé, impossible d'en sortir, j'ai du quitter avec alt+F4) et plusieurs fois après les puzzles.

Vu le manque de difficulté, le jeu se termine en un petit peu plus d'1h si l'on prend notre temps. 
Il aurait fallut plusieurs parties pour débloquer tous les succès (jouer en mode facile, puis jouer en mode difficile). 
J'ai joué 2 fois à ce jeu, mais à la fin de ma première partie aucun succès ne s'est débloqué. Pensant que je n'avais pas été assez rapide, j'ai joué une seconde fois (facile de rusher quand on l'a déjà parcouru) ce qui m'a pris une vingtaine de minutes seulement, à aucun moment je n'ai utilisé le bouton d'aide, ce qui aurait du au moins m'octroyer ce succès, mais pareil pas de succès en vue.
Il me semble qu'une mise à jour avait été faite en 2019, ceci expliquant cela.... j'en déduis que celle-ci a certainement corrompu les succès.

En conclusion, mis à part sa musique zen et relaxante, sa traduction en de nombreuses langues, et son faible prix, ce jeu me semble avoir été développé par une équipe d'amateurs, et en vue d'être utilisé par des appareils mobiles.
Cela donne un produit final très médiocre que je ne recommande pas aux passionnés de jeux d'aventure en point and clic.

The game also includes a audio slider and several different languages. The lore I never bothered reading through, There is lore though and I'm sure it's well written. Our protagonist is full of life and has state of the art animations, He has many flaws just like all of us but has some redeemable traits but many concerning ones too, He tends to take his anger out on animals which I think he needs to seriously see a therapist for before it leads to anything serious but I would recommend this game to anyone who has a desire to learn and improve on yourself this game does just that.

The game art has an indie feel but the 2.5d graphics are pretty in their own right and the water effects especially are quite relaxing. 

Most of the gameplay is retro point and click adventure style scene by scene exploration, like the old Sierra and LucasArts games. It has some item combination puzzles similar to such games but with a survival theme and storyline eg: make a fishing rod, campfire etc. There are also a number of mini-puzzles scattered throughout the game in the form of locked gates and chests, which are the kind you'd usually find in hidden object games, like jigsaws, tile swaps, rotating water pipes etc.  

The puzzles aren't bad  and the item combinations are fun and mostly intuitive or hinted by the in game notes. Some are a little tricky, but the hot spot ""eye"" button and the hints / puzzle skip system keeps things moving along nicely. There is also an achievement to unlock if the game is completed without hints. Speaking of which, the achievements and trading cards integration is a nice bonus if you are a collector.

・Steamランキング対応してるのでTAする楽しみがあった。
・きちんと内容の理解できる翻訳だった。
・ヒント、パズルスキップがあるから完全に詰むことはない。（内容の理解には時間がかかるけども
・Windows９８くらいのゲームを思いださせるグラフィック。
・ファストトラベルができる（おかげで歩くのが遅いがそこまで気にならない

悪い点
・特定の操作で詰む、クラッシュする場面がいくつかある。
　（ゲームリセット時、ファストトラベル関連など。
・クリア後に表示されるタイムとSteamランキングに乗る記録が異なる
　（スキップやヒントの使用で加算+数十秒の謎追加
・思ったよりクソゲーしてない

総評としてルート構築とかで９時間は遊んでるので私はだいぶ満足しています。

そんな当たり前のことを思い出させてくれたのがこのゲームです。

謎解き脱出ゲームって、とにかく「解けるもんなら」みたいに難しく、おまけに巧妙に細かく「見つけられるもんなら」とでも言いたげな工程が作られがちで、そりゃ作る側の心情としてはそうなるのもわかるんですけど。でも、できるだけ解けない謎を作ろうと努力するのは謎解きバトルする頭脳自慢か、犯罪者くらいであるべきで。だってこれはゲーム。楽しくなくちゃなんの意味もない。そして謎は、解けなくちゃ楽しくないんです。

たしかにゲームの作り自体はとにかく簡単で、操作キャラの男性を気持ちよく動かせるわけでも、このゲーム用にとこだわって作られた背景や音楽があるわけでもない。でも、とにかく優しい。このゲームはクリアするために作られている。
群を抜いてたくましい竿があるわけでも、指使いが格段に上手いわけでも、連射の体力に優れているわけでもない。でも圧倒的に気持ちの良い人っているじゃないですか。この作者は、ゲームの本質だけでなく情事の本質をも悟っているのではないでしょうか。
いやとにかくサポートが手厚い。アイテムなんかちゃんと順番に組み合わせていかないと機能してくれない脱出ゲーもあるのに、このゲームでは「この二つを組み合わせるには、まだ何か足りなくない？○○しなきゃね」って言ってくれます。アイテム同士の組み合わせがどんな結果を生み出すかの全権を製作者が握ってる中、この声掛けは優しすぎて「もうちょっと激しく」とおねだりしたくなる程でしょう。まるで作者が隣に座ってプレイを見守っているかのような口調が、どこか温もりを感じさせます。なるほどここは楽園なのかもしれません。プレイキャラの男性はずっと無表情で、ここへ来る前ずっとシコってたのかと思うほどでしたが。

謎解きですが、パズル面では特に難しいことはありません。アイテムの組み合わせと使用方法がちょいちょい詰まるかなくらいです。ただ、それらのヒントは作中で丁寧に解説されているうえ、ヒントボタンなるものの存在で完全に詰まる前に先へと進めていけます。さらに前述したような声掛けが入ってくるので、誰でも同じくらいの時間でクリアできるのではないでしょうか？
これならフリーの脱出ゲーに慣れ親しんでる人でなくとも、簡単にプレーできるでしょう。私もゲームをしていて、久しぶりにイライラモヤモヤストレスフリーでクリアまでいけました。人によってはloadingが多少ストレスになるかもくらいですね。まあ多少焦らされた方が気持ち良くなるってもんですよね。

操作性やグラフィック等画面を見た時の安っぽさ以外はとてもよかったです。ストーリーに関して言うなら(ストーリーというほどのストーリーはないけど)骸骨に対してちょっとそっけなくなるのが残念でした。
私は英語のまま進めちゃいましたが、ある程度しっかりした訳の日本語でプレイできるみたいですね。確認してみたら、日記が悲惨なことになってました笑　テキストレイアウトが完全に手抜きなのが発覚しましたが、それでもかなりの種類の言語を翻訳ソフトそのままでないものにしている点でどっこいだと思います。

暇潰し、というよりは優しいゲームに温かくもてなされたい時に最適なゲームだと思います。精神的に疲れ、それでもゲームがしていたいって人にオススメです。

Nothing special good or special bad in graphics or sound and only very little story is this story. All you have to do is just find object, mix object, use object. So there is really nothing to recommend about this tiny little game. Difficulty is nearly none-existent and there are nothing that you will find expressive at all. Achievements are all quite easy to get. Just play it though it without hint and hit final boss 2 times in a row.

2 problem that’s for me that would made me thumb this game down.
1.	Bugs. For such a small game still some graphic glitch remain. After you solve a puzzle and clear it the value was not reset even after you click reset the game. So after you finish on easy and if you continue on hard right away. There will be some funky picture for your puzzle. (Can be solve by restart the game.)
2.	Note and Hint are in some exotic hand written style that’s really hard to read for me. Yes… I can go another language and it would been better but from the list of language given the only was good for me is English and that really made this game a lot more difficult.

So nach fast 9h in dem Spiel (was für dieses Spiel sehr hoch ist) schreib ich auch mal einen Review. Lost in Paradise ist ein eher unbekanntes Spiel aber dennoch Spielwürdig. In diesem Spiel muss man eine Insel erkuden, und Rätsel lösen. Ich werde auf folgende Punkte in diesem Review eingehen: Einleitung, Grafik, Positives, Negatives, Zusammenfassung

[h1] Einleitung [/h1]

Nach einem Sturm auf hoher See sind wir an Land einer geheimnissen Insel gespült worden. Doch diese Insel ist keine normale Insel, sie ist wie ein Paradies. Nur sind wir Verloren im Paradies und müssen aber müssen irgendwie versuchen wieder weg zu kommen. 

[h1] Grafik [/h1]

Das mit der Grafik ist eine zweischneidige Klinge. Einserseits ist sie schön gemacht. Andererseits ist das Spiel nicht so modern, weswegen die schönen Hintergründe ziemlich verpixelt aussehen. Aber für so eine Art Spiel reicht es völlig aus.

[h1] Zusammenfassung [/h1]

Troz des Preises für diese 2h Spielspaß ist es ein gelungenes Spiel. Die Grafik ist ganz okay, eben nur bisschen verpixelt. Die Atmosphäre ist sehr schön. Die Story ist gut und logisch und mit den verschiedenen Rätseln und Landschaften wird das Spiel nie langweilig. Von mir eine Kaufempfehlung.

This game had some cool/basic casual puzzles, but it wasn't enough to make this game a winner. You look at the price tag and see only $3; but that's for 40 minutes of painful gameplay. That's equivalent to spending $50 on a premium title with a long and captivating campaign. <-- No Brainer

The 25 locations remind me of static browser images mixed with some well-done water work from the developer, and a robotic character that awkwardly moves about the map.

The game really lacks the polish or excitement to charge this premium price. The worst part without a doubt is the navigation and item finding; without the help of the hint you can't determine what items are clickable or where to go. This is extremely frustrating and causes you to click the screen a ton without success. 

Should have been free or like $0.27; but don't buy it.

Wow, seriously wow. I feel bad for the other bad reviews I wrote because this... I can't even explain how bad this is. 

Positives:
+ 2 playthroughs = all achievements. If you don't lose your sanity. 
+ nice landscapes in the background.
+ relaxing music and the sound was okay too. 

Negatives: 
- Worst animations I've ever seen. 
- Story? You are a sailor, ship got broken, you find yourself on that island and explore it. Apparently you don't have a name, the island has no name. Eduardo has a name but we never find out who he is or what happened to him.
- Only 5-6 puzzles in total. 
- One puzzle took me 15 minutes on hard mode because 9 tiles had the same color. Go figure...
- A huge ""what the hell was that?"" moment after the game. Who put the flags on the mountain? Many unanswered questions.
- Truly the worst animations I've ever seen. (Again!) The character walking through the forest appears too big or too small. 
- Total realistic ending - I lost my sanity after that.
- I don't even know the price of that ""game"". Must have picked it up in a bundle or bought for 20 Cents. It's not worth more that 20 Cents. Including the trading cards.
- Epic logic. Put bird into crab cage, put its feet in glue so the bird flies to its nest and gets you the stuff that's in it. 
- German translation was more than poor. Just stop. 

Being a """"""developer"""""" from India doesn't excuse this poor shit of a ""game"". Please stop making ""games"" forever! Never touch a computer again! You are the disgrace of all existing developers!

The developer is called Elev8 and tells us right under its logo ""Elevating gaming to the next level"".
If that is the next level of gaming, I'll set all my computers on fire and start playing board games again. Probably the better idea anyways.

When I picked this title up I really didn't know what to expect. It's not reviewed on any of the main adventure games websites and there aren't many reviews on Steam.

When I started it up I was asked whether I wanted to play it on Easy or Hard. I chose Easy as I didn't want to get stuck and it appears that the actual adventure gameplay is the same. The Hard difficulty level just affects the complexity of some sliders / picture puzzles.

On beginning the game itself, the introduction was very simple with just a few paragraphs in a diary to read about how my character got to the island. I thought at this point that it was a little too simple and lame. The story itself is quite bare bones, but it holds interest for the duration.

What I really liked about this game was the wonderful ambient, relaxing music. It's from Cyan Music and it really fitted the solitary exploration and puzzling of the game well. Other sounds in the game are the natural sounds of nature. There is no voice acting as there is nobody at all to speak to and this does not detract at all from the experience.

The graphics are simple but very effective, from snow scenes that give you a sense of the cold to plenty of water scenes and lush jungle / rainforest.

The interface is very user friendly.  Combining objects couldn't be simpler and the whole game is very intuitive. Hot spots do need careful searching though, though again there is help in the form of an eye icon that lights up all hotspots.

I completed the game in 2 and a half hours and did not use any of the available hints. It could be completed faster with the help of the built in hint system, but where's the fun in that?

I am not interested in Steam achievements, but for those that seek out 100% success, this game should be very straightforward in 2 playthroughs at each difficulty setting.

I can recommend this game for a peaceful two to three hours experience.",1450082266,1450082293,True,7,0,0.589705824851989746,0,False,False,False,False,,,

漂着した島からの脱出パズルアドベンチャーゲーム
難易度は2種類簡単か難しいかの2択
カード付、日本語訳対応、実績あり

・良かった所
普通にプレイできる翻訳
拾ったアイテムの組み合わせで新しい物が作れる

・良くなかった所
背景、物探し（？）の場面がほとんど実写というか写真素材
音楽も多分素材（別のアドベンチャーゲームで聴いたことあるやつでした）
翻訳はありがたいけど改行が無いので画面が文字だらけ
主人公の移動がもっさりしてる
物凄くボリュームがない
謎解きっぽいけど謎解きが簡単すぎてびっくりする
スワイプを多用させられる（が難しくない）

良くないところのほうが目についたので項目が多すぎですが
あっさりゲーをプレイしたい時にはいいと思います
実績を全解除するにはヒント無しで両方のモードをクリアすればOK
プレイ時間も簡単な方で1.5時間程度だったので息抜き程度でなら遊べると思います

I used the eye icon alot to see where I could interact with the scene, but overall I think this is a decent enough casual game, although it does feel a little like a school project.  

For the couple of quid I spent I don't feel ripped off, and the time I spent playing was fun. Good as a time fiiller.
