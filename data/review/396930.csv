Ancak bir sürü eksik var. 4-5 Saatlik oyun süresine sahip. Şimdi İyi ve Kötü yanlarından şöyle bahsedeyim;
İyi Kısımları:
+Karakterimizin Özel saldırısı; Bu saldırı ile karakter belirli süreliğine seçilen düşman askerini çevrenizdeki belirli bir alanda kontrol altına alarak savaşıyor. Bu tarz epik saldırı da epey keyif veriyor.
+Özel saldırıları sırasında kullanabileceğimiz yetenekler; 7 veya 8 tane yetenek var düşmanı ele geçirdikten sonra bunları kullanarak çeşitli saldırı şekilleri geliştirebiliyorsun. Örnek olarak; ben bir etapta Sniperlı askeri ele geçirdim sonra Sonsuzluk skillini (Sadece 1 kez çıktı :( ) kullanarak süresiz şekilde kontrolüm altına aldım. Daha sonra Headshot skill'i ile düşmanlara tek atmasını sağladım. Bir de Özgürlük skillini kullandım ve Kontrol altına aldığım adamın bütün haritada dolaşabilmesini sağladım. Bu sayede Ana karakteri oynatmadan O adamla bütün etabı tamamladım. Çok keyifiydi.
+Chapter'lar basit ama epey güzel düzenlenmiş.
Kötü Yanları;
-Hikaye yarım, eksik, bir çok şey açıkta kalmış,
-Seslendirmeler çok kötü, Yapamıyorsan hiç yapma bari,
-Pastel tarzında ara sahneler güzel gözükmesine rağmen daha da iyi yapılabilirdi,
-Ana karakterimizin Özel saldırısından sonra bütün düşmanlar sanki gökten vahiy inmiş gibi hemen yerimizi tespit ediyorlar,

You will get chased and there is nothing you can do about it. You can't kill the enemy stealthly cause the instakill is way too unreliable.

I don't want to write negative review, but I can't make it positive also.

The main plus of this game (and what sold it to me) was graphic style. I love it. It's interesting and uncommon. Stealth tag also have some influence, but don't rush if (like me) it's enough for you to spend some bucks on small discount. Game have 2 major minuses - bad gameplay design and controls.

The whole 8 hours I have played it I have suffered from controls. Main gameplay feature require you to control enemies and their guns, but you almost can't point cursor where you want because it's jumping like crazy all over the place. And it's for joystick. Mouse and keyboard are not setup completely by default and even if you will use mouse it's even more horrible than joypad. Too bad that I asked about this on forums only at the end. Because (from developers response) it occurs that game have problem with mouse and joystick enabled together. And if you will use only K+B it's working perfectly as I wanted. Keep this in mind. This game is muuuch more enjoyable with fluent controls.

Second - gameplay design. It's just... plain, old (90th), some times stupid. I hope in next game they will have less timing puzzles with spikes, mines and other devices that looks like something completely out of place. Like unlimited flying rockets that block your path and you need to duck to pass them. It's just stupid. Enemies always know where you are if alarm is ringing. And the best strategy is run back until countdown ends. Or check the second steam screenshot with rolling ball. Seems like logic didn't made it alive from this level.

Some times you can't tell where floor met the hole and you character will dive into the unknown. Sometimes you will guess what you need to do next. It's not often, but annoying. Also it seems like they didn't found a way to make more variety to 'control' mechanics. Just add a little more 'patches' (ingame name) variety and more puzzles with them and game will fill much better.

So it's up to you. If you are still reading and still want to play - give it a try. You might find something to entertain you for an evening or two.

There's a strange mishmash of conflicting art resolutions.  Detailed crates sit next to stretched roof top images.  Sharp edged plants are drawn in with mostly blurry soft trees.  The screenshots and video look good in low resolutions but even something as low as Standard Defintion easily shows how inconsitent the imagery is.  Push anything higher than High Definition and the Tidal Affair starts looking pretty bad.

There are compression artifacts and bad alpha blending on some of the textures that are disturbingly amateur.  Some objects layering appears to be incorrect with the bottoms of tree trunks appearing on top of folliage that should be infront.

The levels are large but sparesly populated.  The puzzles consit mostly of running back and forth through the silly make-work mazes rather than being cerebrally challenging.  There is button pushing, so much button pushing.

The combat is strange with Manisha sometimes being a bullet sponge and sometimes just keeling over and dying.  The health bar is largely pointelss as individual map roaming enemies do little damage but the elite guards swamp and kill her easilly.  The umbrella - which she pulls out of her leg - seems to do several times more damage than any bullets.

There are many instant environmental deaths.  The comic falls onto beach sand or water just beneath her feet, exploding into beef gibs when pricked by a spike.  And.  Well there are many environmental deaths just nor many variations.

The stealth is also a bit hit-and-miss.  There have been occasions where Manisha has been crouched but still spotted when she really shouldn't have been.  Not that it usually matters: being detected doesn't carry much penalty, except when the elite commando squads decide to investigate.  

The mind control portion of the game is not quite right.  The tedious approach of suiciding single guards is far safer than trying to setup scenarios where the 'best' guard can take the others down.  Don't get swamped, give Manisha space to run away and there's no real challenge.

Lastly the animations are slidy and stilted.  Achievments are given despite failing those achievements.   The menus and interface are... bad.  And the cut scenes and dialogue are even worse.

It's a pity, but there's not much going for Tidal Affair.  If you want a  mind controlling stealth game then play Abe's Oddesy instead.",1463692231,1463739781,False,33,2,0.588785409927368164,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The next day at #345 we backed it up with another stealth oriented game in Deus Ex: Invisible War. Just yesterday, Alien: Isolation was featured at #342. Needless to say Steamified believes that some of the very best games in the Steam catalogue are stealth games. With the quality of games that fit this genre you can gain an appreciation of just how tough a market Overcurfew has entered with Tidal Affair: Before the Storm. However, you will be delighted to know that the game certainly deserves its fair share of attention.

At its core Before the Storm is an isometric adventure game that heavily features stealth and tactical shooter mechanics. You traverse levels finding switches to open gates all of the while avoiding being shot at from guards whose sole mission is to kill you and your sister. On top of the stealth and shooting mechanics you have the ability to freeze time and take control of an enemy within a certain radius of your position. When you control the guard you can use him to shoot at other guards or to execute him. Be careful, however, because if you’re in control of the guard when he dies you will lose a percentage of your own health.

I would argue that more skilled gamers will find the game to be relatively simple. However, for your average gamer the game’s difficulty might be a minor concern at the beginning of the game. However, as most good strategy games rely on, you will need to development and implement strategies throughout the course of the game. The tutorial teaches you the basic moves and controls that you will be utilizing throughout the game and then just as suddenly throws you in at the deep end. Some may see this as a negative but I, for one, really appreciated this. The sooner that you throw a player in the sooner they have to learn to swim or otherwise they sink. This is the perfect game to do that with. It was an intelligent game design decision.

There have been critical complaints about the game’s poor control system. However, Overcurfew have added full controller support in their recent update which has improved it immensely. I would argue that the game is much easier to play with a controller and would recommend it rather than relying on keyboard and mouse. The developers have stated as much in the game update notice going as far as recommending the use of a PS4 controller as the best controller for the game. I, however, have utilized my trusty Xbox One controller and have found that there is no issues there. However, I would recommend one thing to the devs in their next patch. Please fix the tutorial for those who will be using controller. Presently the tutorial only details the mouse and keyboard controls for the game which means that the player has to go to a convoluted control menu to see what the corresponding key is. This will be a little bit of work to determine what controller everyone is using but it will be worth it and increase the game’s accessibility.

I do have an appreciation for the game’s artistic flair. Another Steam reviewer, fantis6 described it best when they wrote that the game looks like an oil painting. It’s a highlight of the game. When combining the isometric nature of the game with the artistic flair I am reminded of Transistor. Yes, they are two very different games but the similarities are definitely there. The soundtrack is rock solid and I can see many people purchasing the soundtrack. For music fans or collectors of soundtrack edition games I would recommend taking full advantage of the game plus soundtrack bundle especially at the current 35% discount.

Tidal Affair: Before the Storm is a great indie game that will appeal to fans of isometric stealth games and female antagonists.

[h1]マインドコントロールでサクサク進めるステルスゲーム[/h1]

　Tidal Affair: Before the Stormがどんなゲームかを説明するなら、ユニークなコンセプトを持つステルスゲームになります。その性質を語る上で幾つかの大きな特徴を列挙していきたいと思います。

　ゲームをひとたび始めると中南米か東南アジアかよく分からないですが、熱帯地方らしい原色系の雰囲気とそれを表現する油彩調のアートスタイルが目に飛び込んできます。これは人によって結構好き嫌いが分かれるように思いますが、個人的には同じような表現のものばかりになるより尖がった攻めの姿勢は支持したいところです。但し、一部高低差といいますか遠近法といいますか、カットシーンでの表現は頑張って欲しかったなーと思うところはあります。…タンカーですよ、ゲフンゲフン。

　2人の少女のうち1人、主人公であるManishaは一定範囲内にいる他人の体をしばらくの間自分の意のままに操れます。幾つか制限もあって一定時間しか操れないこと、支配できる距離の範囲外に出ると急速に操れる時間が短くなること、操っている肉体が死に至ると強制的に元の肉体に戻ること、などの条件があります。操っている肉体から別の肉体を操作することはできません。また操っている肉体が死に至ると元々の肉体であるManisha自身が一定時間身動きが取れなくなってしまいます。

　敵を操った後は持っている銃で他の敵を攻撃し同士討ちを謀るのですが、操っている敵のタイプによって所持している武器が異なり、その性質も異なっています。幾ら周りが緑に覆われているからといって村の中でギリースーツを着ているなんちゃってスナイパーや増援時に出てくるのと同じタイプの赤い敵兵は通常の敵兵より頼りになるでしょう。また一定時間頭部にカーソルを合わせ続けると黒いゲージが表示され、これがいっぱいに到達するとヘッドショットが可能になります。但し、[u]このゲームでは全般的にUI表示物とその判定座標がずれている[/u]ため、修正されるまでは頭2つ分ぐらい上を狙うのが良いかと思います。

　反乱軍である敵兵士の視界は扇状に可視化されています。この辺はMetal Gear Solidのレーダーなどを思い浮かべて頂ければ理解はスムーズでしょう。扇状の視界表示は何も遮蔽されていない赤の帯が入った段階、屈み状態ならば見つからない白い帯の段階、視線そのものが遮蔽されている表示されない段階の3つがあり、これらの状況に応じて敵の視線が交差する中でも屈んで進めば見つからない状況が存在します。

　敵の視界外から接近すれば全く気取られることなく接近でき、背後から屈み状態で攻撃を行うと一撃で敵を屠るステルスキルが可能です。逆に敵に見つかってしまうと30秒間増援を呼ばれてしまい、敵の視界外で30秒経過させないとやり過ごすことができません。しかしこのゲームは一度敵に見つかってしまうとどこに隠れていようが敵は必ず自分の元までやって来るので、見つかったら殲滅させることが原則になります。この辺りのユーザーが取れる行動の幅は今後のアップデートもしくは次回作で期待したいところです。

　ゲーム中ダイアログが表示されるところは何ともないのですが、[u]字幕表示がオプションにも準備されていないところが残念[/u]でした。グローバル市場を意識するならば、そこは外してほしくなかったところです。カットシーンで喋っている内容が全て「何やら喋っているぞ」になってしまいます。この辺りへの配慮は是非とも検討願いたいところです。

　[u]褐色肌のお姉ちゃんが体を操ってあんなことやこんなことをした挙句、操られた人はあんなことになっちゃう[/u]と書くと、魅力的ではありますが色々語弊があるかもしれません。本作は全15章構成で途中若干の中だるみも発生しているかもしれませんが一気に駆け抜けることができます。次回作も決定しているようです。気になった方はトライしてみてください。あぁ、大事なことを忘れていました。…パラソルヘ○べえ。

Tidal Affair: Before The Storm is a stealth strategy game with a unique twist. The main character is able to take control of her enemies and make them bend to her will. She is able to make soldiers kill their peers or walk them into deadly traps if they are available. It's a battle against resources and can get tricky finding ways to dispose of the various guards. A media review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels. 

What I enjoyed:

Taking control – I enjoyed taking control of the enemies and having them fight or even jump off cliffs. Once I was able to master the deselecting of the enemy prior to death it became very useful. It's tricky however and you are certainly punished for not deselecting enemies if they die, if they are shot by their peers those soldiers then shoot you to death relatively quickly.

Painterly Canvas – The art style is a rugged and semi rough painterly style, but it works pretty well. There are a few edges or odd set pieces here and there, but overall the environments and cut-scenes have a neat painted quality that makes the game feel a bit more crafted.

Hand holding not allowed – The game is difficult for a variety of reasons. I found that the tutorial gives you only a slight idea of how to effectively move through an area without losing loads of health. You have to use your brain a bit and that's something I appreciate. Regardless of frustration levels during play I'd prefer to be challenged rather than led through a game.

What I disliked:

Interface-off – The interface is absolutely terrible, the click targets are all misplaced as you can see in my video and certain buttons float in very odd places throughout the menu. I had to re-select my controller each time I launched the game. Essentially the user interface and options portion of this game is unfinished and it needs to be cleaned up very desperately.

Burning fuel – The ""patches"" as they are called are one time use, and progression seems almost non existent in the game. It's essentially a strategy game with a high difficulty level but seems to lack a bit in the replay-ability category.

Strategy games of this type are admittedly not my forte and this game took me out of my comfort zone for sure. I'd say that the game and it's mechanics are solid but the UI needs a desperate overhaul. I can say that I recommend waiting for a sale (Currently on the 2015 Steam holiday sale it's 25% off) due to the unfinished nature of the interface and menu system.

In the game you spend your time sneaking, killing guards or avoiding them, solving puzzles. You have a special ability which is freezing time - when you use it you can take control at enemy, execute an enemy or steal health. The story is quite interesting. The art style nice, this looks like a hand painted oil paint. The music is also good. One of biggest negative in a game I think it’s the control system,  this not very good and because this can be sometimes annoying.

So my verdict

+nice graphic style
+nice music

-buggy cutscenes

-a bit high price
 
Well this game is not bad, but have some problems. For example a control system and cutscenes. If they this resolve shortly its game can be really enjoyable. But at the moment also have some good points for example a unique art style. I think you should try it if you like stealth games, it may be an intresting piece for your collection.

Tidal Affair is a stealth adventure game that immerses you in the midst of conflict between pirates, rebels, and what governs the islands of Alter Tides.

[h1]Points of interest[/h1]
[list][*]+Gameplay is fun and engaging- solve puzzles to progress, sneak past guards, or use your abilties to subdue your enemies 

[*]+Mechanics are well made for the most part [b](wall of text incoming!!!)[/b]- there are several differeant factors: The first is the puppet ability, which allows the player to take control of hostiles and use them to kill other enemies, or make them commit suicide. Secondly, patches can be obtained along your way which allow you to perform various helpful actions which all tie into the puppet ability (Excecute controlled entity with no cool down, control entity without space limits, steal health, load headshot instantly, and switch places with the controlled entity). Lastly, you are given an umbrella thingy which is your main weapon. It may not be the strongest, but if you sucessfully sneak behind an enemy and hit them, it becomes an insta-kill.

[*]+Art style is very appealing in cutscenes and in-game- appears to be hand painted. Overall I like the art style that the developers decided to implement into this game, it suits it well.

[*]+Levels are challenging and take time to complete- if you play through all of them, you will surely get your money's worth from this game.

[*]-Cutscenes and voice acting are both a bit clunky. Although this does not take away much from the game, it is definitely noticeable. 

[*]-Controls are not the best and feel akward at times.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
An action/stealth game that requires strategy and persistence. Recommended for any fan of stealth, strategy, action, and adventure games.

Vamos ver X-MINutos de Tidal Affair: Before The Storm...
Um jogo de ação e furtividade em perspectiva isométrica com uma estética artística, músicas boas, parece focado em uma estória que será contada em mais jogos, mas a jogabilidade é muito rasa, sem profundidade.

While lovely hand-drawn animation tells an interesting story about tribal politics between chapters, your main task is to bypass or takedown each enemy using any means necessary. Progress further and levels also introduce some basic puzzle elements.

Almost immediately your character is given the ability to freeze time and take control of enemies, which works in a small radius and runs on a cooldown timer. Recharge time could be lowered by mashing the space bar. Throughout levels you discover 'patches' that are effectively magic which can be used after controlling enemies. Some of these abilities included instant execute, swap positions and health tap. Ultimately I found the game a little on the easy side but still had fun playing. Levels left plenty of room for experimentation, though backtracking in later stages could be refined as some of it felt like extra padding.

No in-game options were available other then sliders for sound. Gamepad didn't detect and controls could not be remapped, I personally had no issues with the default keyboard/mouse setup. Screen resolutions of 4k+ were supported using the unity launcher. Currently includes 15 chapters (minus training), most were split into 2-3 areas taking 5-15min each depending on your playstyle. Tidal Affair feels content complete and it's another respectable early access game that's worth keeping your eye on. First part of a series but does play as a standalone. Cheers folks.

After playing two chapters this seems like a cute little stealth action game in which you can posses other people and make them kill their friends or suicide in a manner of ways.

The controls are a bit clunky and the cutscenes need some polish, but it seems to be the current ($8) asking price.

I'll add a proper review once the game is out of Early Access, I just don't want to spoil the story for myself too much because I want to play the finished version.",1446592604,1446592604,True,9,1,0.411781013011932373,2,True,False,True,False,,,
