So in combat scenarios, as soon as the enemy comes into sight, even if they are 5 territories away, it'll take you that many turns to reach them. If they are a ranged enemy, well, you get the idea. 

Other genius game design ideas this game had: knockback in a game where each move is a turn, enemies that cause giant splotches to appear on your screen and block your view, and stunlocks, in, and let me reiterate this, moving 1 square takes up a turn.

The game is solid. It only has RPG elements and is not a true RPG. Their is no end game builds or a ton of ways you can play. Its just endless progression with all items and stats.

BUT... if you like ranger/wizard characters that shoot, this game is fast paced and solid. The story mode is very good with the ability to play endless dungeons afterward or go on the half-hour session (if doing item management) of side quests, forever.

Story mode is re-playable to better improve the only true RPG element, the spell points. I would tell you the best spells for cost of components but that is one of the fun things of unlocking all spells and checking them out to re-play the story and min/max.

You can let your components build up by buying throwing weapons which are very cheap and powerful. The first levels can buy almost any throwing weapon and just rule.

The game is easy, go on all the hardest difficulties when there is a choice. Its a bit too easy but still fun to play.

There is very minor crafting elements. Mostly just consists of keeping rings, amulets and runes that give damage in order to socket a damage rune to progress forward with damage jewelry (as opposed to defense jewelry). You can do the same with bows. All other crafting is pretty temporary.

In this game, you play as a Banlit who discovered that he/she has magical powers; a type of power that is traditionally reserved to the elites called Elams. So, if you're into Harry Potter references, your character is equivalent to a Mudblood and the Elams are Pure Bloods. 

Like HP, some (not all) powerful Elams on the Wizard Council think that they should be the only people with all the magical power, but the thing here is that magic in this world is derived from 5 main elements, each regulated by an appointed wizard on the council. Plus, it's more of a give-and-take process as opposed to the rogue Elams' plan to just take everything regardless of the consequences to all the other residents of the world or to the stability of the world itself. 

Now, obviously, with elemental rifts popping up everywhere and monsters pouring out, everyone, both Banlits and Elams, need to work together to protect the people and stop the corrupted Wizard Council from destroying the world in their thirst for more power.

My full run!

---------------------

Gameplay-wise, Rogue Wizards feels a lot like Greedy Cave to me, albeit being a much easier game to play as long as you keep a close eye on your and your teammates' health bars, have a good sentinel to take on spawned adds (especially when you're being overwhelmed by sheer numbers... Super Replicating Blobs... I'm 👀 at you!), maybe a sturdy ice shield just in case, have a good set of gear, and focus on only attacking the boss.

Like most dungeon crawlers, Rogue Wizards offer a ton of loot of varying grades, stats and what I'd call ""upgrade potential"". You see, loot in this game can ""level up"" when used. Every level up will grant the item a new, random perk.  There's a level cap though, but you can extend that cap if you have the necessary perk. There are spells to use, complete with a spell tree with upgrades, 

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Easy (enough) dungeon crawler to play that has an ending you can look forward to
+ Nice variety of loot and enemies to defeat
+ An ""okay"" story that's well-written enough but isn't particularly inspiring
+ Merchant in the dungeon - very well-placed. Of the many times I've gone dungeon raiding, I've only had to throw away stuff to clear up bag space two times. [spoiler]and for both times, I would have encountered the merchant soon had I persevered[/spoiler]
+ Love the art here 
+ No penalties for dying except that you'll have to redo the dungeon from the start, unless you have a revive.

[h1]Cons/Feedback[/h1]
- Movement can get become wonky when I'm trying to move my team across multiple tiles at a time.
- Selecting something in a tile stacked with several items can be hard. At one point (the last vid), I was trying to see how much health a teammate has but I can't seem ""highlight"" her and instead, I kept getting the other items that are stacked on the same tile.
- Game can feel rather repetitive after a while. 
- The price point for Rogue Wizards is slightly on the higher end. You might want to get it during a sale, a bundle or at a discount.
- Bug: Forgestone use is free for some reason. This is a beneficial bug to the player though, so I don't mind :)
- One of the tips in the game during a loading screen mentioned about watching ads for extra stuff. Had I not seen that I might not know for sure that Rogue Wizards is a mobile port.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
Rogue Wizards looks and feels so much like The Greedy Cave which I adore, but this game is definitely a lot easier than the latter and well, this game has an ending. It makes for a somewhat casual dungeon crawler that a player can play whenever they have the free time since a single dungeon run (in the later game) only takes like around 30 minutes or so. The game has a sufficient variety of loot and enemies too. However, due to several factors, one of which being that the game is free-to-play on the App Store, I would say that the game is slightly on the costly end of the spectrum. If you're interested in the game, feel free to wishlist it first and get it during a sale.

This is going to be less of a review and more a rant really.

Is it turnbased? Yes it is, but not in a way one would think. Is it roguelike? It is , just in worst way possible . Is it RPG ? Not really but that can be up for debate.. So it is mostly everything it says it is plus a nice cute artstyle so what's the problem here?.. IT'S A MOBILE GAME. Oh my.

And that fact is nowhere to be found unless you start playing game and notice these wierd little things like opening daily chests and everything being obivously made for a touch screen.  So now we are moving to that 'misleading' territory . Okey , so it is mobile game ported to PC , what's the big deal? 

The Big Deal is that it still plays like a mobile game and now i can finally dish out my main complaint with it . That turn-based combat is a most dreadful thing ever. It is hard to explain why it doesnt work but i'll try . In the very beggining you face one or two simple skeletons, they just move towards ya and attack , you do the same. Both sides take sort of 'turns' but they are just delays so instead of making your turn and pushing 'end turn' you do your move and wait for enemy mobs to do theirs.  It almost works with one or two simple mobs on sreen. Later in game you start facing groups of tens and they start to get all sorts of abilities and that is a nail in the coffin for this game. It is entirely possible to be clicking your mouse for a two minutes and not be able to perform a single action because you will get knocked,frozen in place,stunned etc etc. 

I honestly almost broke my mouse out of rage trying to do ANYTHING in this game. It reminds me of Book of Demons there whole game consists of you trying to get free of enemy stuns or freezes.

To play this is just the most awful experience one can have in front of PC screen. It's a mobile game and while it looks nice it plays like total crap and that , even for stealthily ported mobile game is not ok.

Being a big fan of 'rogue' games already, I can say that this is also a solid addition to any fan's library if you are looking for an easier diversion than the typical fare.  In a nutshell, RW is a turn-based dungeon explorer with random loot, classless-leveling, upgradable items, spells that can be leveled on a simple but useful tree, a city to rebuild that grants perks, quests, items, upgrades and stories, a unique line-of-site system that builds the dungeon block-by-block, and an easy-to-compare equipment system.

The classless build system and simple stat/leveling mechanic allow for creating a tanky mage, or sword-and-board spell caster; or anything in between. There are many quality-of-life features that make questing so much simpler; allowing uyou to focus on loot , survival and tactical combat. Damage numbers, loot comparison,clear tool-tips, a one-page character sheet and two-bag inventory system keeps your mind on combat and stats and not on shuffling a million bits of junk to sell. Oh, and selling that junk is easy and useful as well.

Overall, RW is a super fun rogue game that really works as an introduction for those who haven't delved ToME (my favorite!) or ADoM, while offering a very rewarding, but simpler, time for those of us that can't get enough perilous dungeon delving.

If you are looking to try your hand at the rogue genre, RW is easily worth the paltry price of $15, and a STEAL at anything less.

The aestetics of the game were good, the learning curve was easy too and those were the main positives.

The negatives start with poor information as to what certain things do or affect and to which extent they do it.

Enemies don't have a list of abilites nor is there a sort of monsterpedia that shows what they do after you defeat them.

Some monsters have annoying abilities which while you can avoid easily, your dumb AI controlled companions cannot. I'm talking about things that create temporary areas of damage, acid being the worst offender.

Other things that are terrible can be you being on pretty much high HP and good gear and you just die suddenly to a single hit or a puddle of acid dropped by a bos which should not oneshot you by any means.

Many spells are either bad or feel that are only there to be a different element of damage.

The idea of spells being a limited resource makes sense, what doesn't makes sense is the way you go about giving one specific resource for each school of magic rather than working with a mana pool.

Swaping weapons and even swaping into some spells consumes a turn. This is quite agravating because you often want to cast a spell to get the use of an effect and often want to swap back to the weapon and in the meantime you lost 2 entire rounds which is very unforgiving.

Weapons are horribly inbalanced. Ranged weapons basically do no damage, while it's understandable that increasing the damage on melee to make it a viable choice, lowering the damage on the ranged weapons to the point that was done here just makes them worthless.

Lastly the wiki which could have at least brought some information actually has nothing. It was created, but almost everything is blank.

I read the commentary on the mud-on-the-screen / black HUD error, and still thought I could muscle through it.  I take pride in surviving games way longer than normal.  In 7 Days, I typically go over 500 days without dying in a new game.  And even that's because I'm surprised and take on a bear with a shovel.  But dying in this game simply because the health potion is simply gone is inexcusable.

THIS game, however good their intention is, is unpolished and only half-thought.  Yes, there's a story, and yes it's pretty, but it's just not a whole game.  The biggest issue is the mudslinger HUD removal thing.  I'm to understand this game is not early access, which makes it a full release game.  But in under 3 hours of playing, I've already got a vanishing HUD.  It would be one thing if you could interact with the missing HUD by guessing.  That'd almost be a 'game mechanic.' But this is an unmissable mistake.  Even the options menu is inaccessible during these outtages.  Not even a phantom window appears.  But this error doesn't even happen ONLY with mud on the screen.  I've had it just... happen.  Not even in combat.  Just standing there trading with the vendor.

Then there's other stuff.  I was pushing through my dislike of the black screen.  I had cleared all the enemies on a floor, and had disabled all the traps.  All that remained was the locked chests.  Thankfully, I had bought 2 keys in the overworld before I entered.  I had 2 chests left and only 1 key.  It's not like you can just go back to town and hope the vendor has more keys, either.  I get to one of the two chests, praying that it will drop another key, when something NEW happened: The key BROKE.  If that sort of thing is going to be included in a game, it makes some RPGs more fun and challenging.  But every single other game with a key-breaking mechanic TELLS you it can happen.  

But that wasn't the biggest concern.  After the key broke, leaving me with 2 unopened chests, it dawned on me:  I BOUGHT my last two keys.  They were not drops on the floor.  All containers were smashed, all mobs killed, everything else was done.  If I hadn't COME IN with 2 keys, I would have been 4 keys behind.  If each floor has goals which include killing all the mobs, opening all the chests, and disabling all the traps, and all the mobs are dead AND all the traps are disabled, then taunting the player with the missing reward caused by the devs decision to not include enough resources...  That's just unreasonable.

If there are goals, and no option to reach them, at least let the player know.  SAY that keys can break. Say that it's LITERALLY impossible to 100% all floors.  Make it clear than you CANNOT use health potions with mud on your screen.  And for the sake of gaming, leave it in beta-testing until it's ready to be released.  This is not a finished product.  These issues lead me to believe that there are even more problems buried further into the game, where no one has yet been able to find them since they can't get past the HUD-mud in the first place.",1527903090,1527903090,False,4,0,0.533340275287628174,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Są produkcje, o których najlepiej aby świat zapomniał. Jest też od zatrzęsienia produkcji oscylujących pomiędzy tymi skrajnościami i skłaniających się bardziej ku jednej czy drugiej kategorii. I o takiej grze przyszło mi właśnie napisać.

Jest to reprezentant gatunku RPG roguelite lite. Co bardziej obytym z językiem angielskim i gatunkami gier to sformuowanie coś pewnie już mówi. Ale że sądy oparte na domysłach to domena polityków, to śpieszę z wyjaśnieniem: to uproszczony na wzór budowy cepa hack'n'slash (bij-zabij i do przodu!) z proceduralnie generowanymi podziemiami. Standardową opcją jest brak permaśmierci, więc porażka oznacza tylko zawalenie misji i pobudkę w naszej tajemnej mieścinie i bazie wypadowej zarazem. Wracamy tam z całym zgromadzonym dobrodziejstwem inwentarza, acz nie jest dla mnie jasne jak się to dokonuje. Czy jesteśmy ratowani przez ziomków z miasta, czy też ma tu miejsce interwencja sił wyższych - nie dowiadujemy się wcale. Oczywiście wspomniane niuanse eschatologiczne dotyczą naszej postaci tylko gdy gramy trybem fabularnym, a nie gauntlet - tam śmierć jest ostateczna.
Bohater jaki jest każdy widzi... Chłopak albo dziewczyna i następnie... No jeszcze możemy sobie zmienić wygenerowane losowo imię. Tadam, koniec męczenia się z kreacją postaci i rozdzielaniem statystyk czy wybierania z tysiąca umiejętności i cech, o nie! Płeć, imię i... budzimy się w karczmie. Z zawodu nasz huncwot to złodziejaszek, ale coś kiepski, bo nie jadł od dwóch dni. Lokal jakiś taki opuszczony, znajdujemy skrzynię, w niej zwój, czytamy... i wywala nas w jakieś katakumby! Tam szybko spotykamy pewnego pana, co tłumaczy że czekał, że zwój nas wybrał i że my teraz to z Nimi jesteśmy. I możemy magią działać, bo inaczej zwój zwyczajnie by nas olał. Magia ma 6 gałęzi do rozwijania. Klasyka: ogień, lód, natura, światło, kosmiczna i ziemia. Czyli podpalania, zamrażania, teleportacje i pancerze z magii. Tyle że bez odpowiednich elementów, to zostają nam co najwyżej sztuczki karciane, ale elementy leżą niemal wszędzie, a w sklepie idą w cenie wacików. Fabuła jest sztampowa: ot, walka z arystokracją, która zakazywała czarować reszcie ludzkości w tych realiach i na jej czele stoi Wielki Zły Hosperak. Drań zaburzył równowagę elementów i potworności na świat wylazły, straszą i dziewkom pewnie pod spódnice zaglądają.

Bestiariusz jest względnie różnorodny: harpie, yeti, demoniszcza, szkielety, gryfy, mroczne byty z krain rodzinnych Cthulhu (nie, nie z morza, tam tylko mieszka!)... Dla każdego coś przykrego. Więszkość tej menażerii jest podatna na konkretny element i odporna na przeciwstawny. Ciekawie prezentują się ataki części bestii, bo: mogą powodować halucynacje u bohatera (zadaje się, że jego towarzysze są podatni na psychozę masową, bo też atakują te wytwory umysłu); ochlapani błotem widzimy gorzej (trzeba przeczekać aż błoto spłynie z ekranu); uciszają czy nawet kradną nam noszony ekwipunek (swoją drogą to niezły talent trzeba mieć aby w walce zdjąć z kogoś zbroję!).

Poza magią walczymy różnym orężem - tu raczej jest klasycznie. Z zasięgowej za to warte wyróżnienia jest rzucanie czakramem niczym Xena - starsi gracze znają postać - trafia kilku przeciwników na raz, acz słabiej boli niż taki strzał z łuku. Ekwipunek w miarę użytkowania staje się potężniejszy i dostaje nowe właściwości, choćby uruchamia sam z siebie zaklęte w nim uroki jak podpalanie, magiczna tarcza czy odporność na szkodliwe podłoże. Mam też na stanie tradycyjnie mikstury: leczące, jedna wskrzeszająca (sama się włącza, nie znam szczegółów technicznych, ale hej, działa!), przyśpieszająca zdobywanie doświadczenia i inne.
Rozwój postaci bólu głowy oszczędza: siła, zręczność i wytrzymałość, plus trochę dumania nad preferowanymi ścieżkami magii. Cztery punkty do statystyk i trzy do czarów na poziom - raczej trudno się w tym pogubić.

Graficzne jest kolorowo i bajkowo, bez krwi i śladowej choćby erotyki - dzieci mogą grać. Muzycznie poprawne, choć szlagierów z tego też nie będzie. Prosta w obsłudze gra, tak na niecałe 15 godzin gry w trybie fabularnym. Grać gdy mamy klimat na coś lżejszego czy też młodsi przedstawiciele rodziny ustawicznie najeżdżają nam pokój i boimy się ich zgorszyć... grą (być może zamierzamy czym innym, nie moja sprawa).

ZALETY:
- Banalna obsługa
- Poprawna graficznie i dźwiękowo
- Większość osiągnięć sama się robi
- Łatwa i nie frustruje

WADY:
- Sztampowa fabuła i dwuwymiarowe postacie
- Za łatwa

I have to say that I kinda regret backing this on Kickstarter.  Ultimately, while it is a fairly pretty looking roguelike, it breaks one of the most important rules of keeping a game fun:  You often lose agency over your character when compared to similar games.  The debuffs and forced movement abilities of the enemies are just not fun.  Rogue Wizards just annoyed me because in the 5 hours I've played, I spent a disturbingly large amount of time watching the game play itself while I was under some crowd control effect, pushed around again on the ice, or just otherwise not playing.  Apparently the ""correct"" way to play was to play an archer, which I didn't know, and was highly frustrated by.  In the time that I played, I didn't see any way (other than be an archer) to mitigate these frustrations through items or upgrades.  It wouldn't be quite so bad in an old ASCII roguelike, since the turns can pass almost instantly, but the pretty graphics here slow things down enough that it goes from ""ugh.  Disappointed, but I guess its fine"" to ""I guess I'll just quit because I'm bored"".

Still, it is a pretty game, and there is a reasonable amount of potential.  For some reason, the Ice dungeons are first, and they are awful for this, but the few non-ice dungeons I saw weren't nearly as aggregious in the loss of player agency, so tentatively recommended on deep sale only for people with a lot of patience for this sort of thing.",1521614427,1521614427,True,0,0,0.457477033138275146,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Monsters scale to your level, so you never feel you're progressing. Each dungeon, the same monsters are super strong. There are also too many monsters that replicate or knock you back. It is not fun to waste 10 turns to kill the original monster, because it replicated 8 times. Likewise the knockback monsters, It makes it extremely hard to get close to them.

Equipment does not seem to be that important. You will be changing gear very often. Think that armor is the best you will ever see? Nope, you will get a better one the next dungeon. And the dungeon after that.

But the worst, the absolute worst, problem with the game is what I will call the mudslinger bug. When you encounter mudslingers, best be sure you have everything you need in your quickbar. Because if you have to open your inventory after there is mud all over your screen, your screen WILL go black. You won't be able to see your inventory, and when you close the inventory, the quickbar and health bar are gone. This issue was reported as far back as July 2017, with no replies from the dev and no fix. I ran into the bug 4 times today and of course died each time. I am done.

Strong points first:
* I like how the monster abilities synergizes. And (what I guess is) a random set of monsters you can meet on a level.
* I also find the aesthetics fitting. Nice even.
* I think I recall some close calls on the early levels. Which made things interesting. I may have been mistaken though. It's all a haze now.
* I believe the randomly generated characters you meet could have been nice in another game.
* I like the trap mechanics. Detect-hidden items are well rewarAnd its gone! Your item is no longer valid.

Bad stuff:
* The linear arethmetics for leveling and gearing and monsters. You do the EXACT same thing at level 200 as at level 5. It's as close to a cow clicker you can get without having any in-game purchases. It's really bad. It's padded with your need to change equipment. A lot.
* No difficulty. 
* Not a shred of strategy.
* You level out of your items before you can say CA
* This game makes me angry at all poor decisions the devs must have made.

I feel the need to extrapolate on something here because I feel there could be some potential for things like saving gear for certain monster combinations. I mean a real strategic choice god forbid! But what's the point if the gear is old before you have completed the dungeon you are in. Instead you just go with whatever attack or defense is highest. And soon you won't even look at the stats the item gets as it levels up, because it doesnt matter, within a few minutes it still will be vendored. Green arrow? Change equip. Not even the character stats you gain as you level matters other than to unlock item requirements. 

This is a $2 dollar game in my book (though I am quite poor). So grab at 90% for some 5-10 hours of decent gameplay if you know what you are in for. Have a good audiobook nearby and you might even enjoy it. Don't go for the 100% achievements - You'll hate yourself and the game.

Have a look at the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/stats/392260/achievements]achievements[/url] and inspect the bosses (achievements that are named ""Defeat ..."")

• It throws loot at you, and encourages the player to replace their gear periodically in ways a lot of games miss - making sure that your layouts rarely start to feel old and worn. 

• The magic system is concise, but powerful, with six total schools of magic, and only three spells per school. You'll get enough magic points to highly specialize in three or four spells, or if you prefer, you can be mediocre at everything with maybe one or two stand-out spells.

• There's two games in one here; there's the ""story"" game with no permadeath, which comes with a town you eventually build up that offers the same basic services you could otherwise find in the dungeon if you get lucky (shrines, traders, an enchanter.) The other game is an old fashion, no mercy, permadeath roguelike that strips out the towny crap, bumps up the encounter rate with traders, and becomes a lot more difficult a lot faster than the story mode. 


Not that everything is great. There's a lack of enemies, with I think 15 sprites, each with a couple variants, that strongly adhere to the six elements/schools of magic. The loot, while plentiful and satisfying, isn't remarkable in anyway - there are no unique items that I've seen with special properties, every slot has a limited number of enchantments, and you'll see the same disappointing properties roll over and over.  Secrets in the game are limited to trapped floor tiles and mimics. There's no highlight or filter for looting, and valuable trinkets might get missed if they fall under larger items.

Still, overall the game is a solid dungeon crawler, and the two modes of play appeal to a casual or hardcore experience well. If you pick this up on sale, you should be well rewarded.",1516752000,1516752000,True,1,0,0.537712931632995605,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Some tips:

Don't just use one weapon; change weapons based on the enemies you're fighting in that particular dungeon.  Also, Shield prevents nasty debuffs/status effects/knockback, so use it if you're annoyed by those.

Rogue Wizards is a spiritual child of Diablo games and doesn't try to hide it even for a second. Similar animations, structure, camera, musical inspirations... However, it's not exactly a hack&slash game. It uses turn-based combat and because of it you can always think about the best strategy for every moment. You can easily switch between various playstyles and the character progression itself is quite forgiving. 

But, you know, it gets boring. It offers not that many enemy types and since all the enemies level up with you, the game has exactly the same pacing through the entire game. All of the boss fights are identical, while randomly generated levels lack strategical depth and don't require much adapting from you. You don't need to rediscover the game and change your strategy - after a couple of hours you'll have everything figured out.

The coolest part of the game is the inventory managment, especially since your items level up with you (to a point). Unfortunately, it's strongly related to randomly generated items. You lack control over this process and keep seeing great items wasting their potential by boosting the stats you have no interested in. 

The game introduces an unlimited grinding potential, so you can always look for something better, but you have to remember - Rogue Wizards is a game that moved into mobile platforms, and it's clear that mobile devices are its natural habitat. A game that keeps being the same, has repetitive plot that doesn't require you to remember anything, doesn't really punish you for dying and so on - it's a perfect tool to keep you entertained when you wait in front of the doctor's office or you ride a bus.

Rogue Wizards is bursting with content and at least for me is addicting as, well, anything that is addicting only more so. As you explore you'll see the dungeon being built ala Bastion.

It's not a great game though.  It's just a treadmill for the sake of being one.  Everything scales to you, so there's never a sense of progression or that your character is getting better.  It's very much a resource management game as well; you can only have 5 potions, you have limited spell components, and it takes a turn to switch between items and most spells.  

It has things that seem neat, but once you realize that it's pointless, they lose their fun.  There are shrines and enchanters you can use, but there's no real point to do so because the next dungeon you go in all the loot that drops will just have scaled up numbers so they'll be better.  Sure you might have a piece of gear for a few levels, but when you replace it, you won't seem like you've received a great upgrade.  It's still going to take you the same number of hits to kill everything because they scale up along with you.

You have three stats, but it's not like you can decie how you want to build the character.  They don't seem to do anything, and are just there to make you spend them to equip the scaled up thing that just dropped.  Putting stats in never actually feels like it helps you out.  It's just a resource for you to spend.

Speaking of spending, all you do is spend your gold to upgrade your shops to the next scaled up level of gear.  So that you can spend your stat points.  So that you can kill things in the same number of hits as you were before you leveled up.

There are several good points.  The graphics and animations have a charm to them.  The music and sound effects are fitting.  The controls are very well presented and easy to understand.  The UI was a little large for my taste (I assume to be able to support mobile) but that was not a deal breaker.

However there are several points that hold this back.  First you are a wizard with extreme limitations on how many spells you can cast.  You are also limited in how many runes you can hold, so you can never build up a huge amount of a favorite spell even with grinding.  You basically save your spells for the bosses... which means you are really a Rogue WARRIOR not a Rogue Wizard, as you will spend most of your time with axes, bows, chakra's and staffs.

Also, switching into a spell takes a whole turn in the turn based combat, which means it is very clunky to try and use your full arsenal.  Basically, choose one weapon or one spell, and that is what you will want to stick to for an encounter to limit damage.  This is especially true when so many monsters have knockback or stun or portal or summon abilities.

The above two issues means that the game quickly becomes very shallow.  Good for a few hours of fun at most, but after that the lack of spells and the repetitive nature of the loot and monsters with no compelling end quickly gets old.

Мультяшная графика, фирменная фишка с ""поднимаемым"" и ""падающим"" ландшафтом, апгрейдящийся город с новыми мастерами после выполнения миссий - всё это я уже видел.

Ну, только что у этого автора денег было поменьше, чем у авторов Бастиона, поэтому детализацией Бастиона там и не пахнет, и вообще это походовый рогалик. Точнее Rogue-lite, потому что от рогалика там только разнообразный лут, случайные донжоны да прокачка. И да, ландшафт здесь появляется и исчезает чисто визуально - на деле это просто так реализована зона видимости.

В целом, как казуальный рогалик, оно даже довольно-таки ничего. Ходишь себе, бьёшь монстров, получаешь лут, все довольны. Мне нравится его система лута (позаимствованная, естественно, из Diablo 2), да и генератор донжонов там простенький, но симпатичный.

А вот боевая система у игры ужасна. Нет, пока ты в казуальном режиме (то есть, в кампании) это не имеет такого уж большого значения - монстры дохнут по-любому, да и жизни у тебя бесконечные. А вот в Roguelike-режиме (который там тоже есть) играть, я так полагаю, будет весьма нехорошо. А вся беда заключается всего в двух положениях:

1. Видимость у героя - 4 клетки по радиусу.
2. Каждое действие (включая смену оружия) занимает один ход. При этом монстры часто ходят не по одной клетке.

В итоге получается, что даже если ты заранее заметил врага, у тебя в самом идеальном случае есть два хода, чтобы выстрелить - потом надо менять оружие на рукопашное, потому что стрельба там вообще ни о чём (когда у рукопашного оружия удар в районе 100 единиц, выстрелить ты можешь на 35). 

Нет, ну есть ещё магия, конечно. Только она дико дорогая - магические ингредиенты падают по 1-2 с монстра, причём не с каждого, причём магии шесть видов. А на применение магии тратится по две единицы профильного ресурса. Это означает, что в любой момент времени у тебя есть от силы десять выстрелов магией (и если их потратить, новые накопятся не скоро). Так что ходить с магией вместо оружия изначально - не самая лучшая идея. А на смену, да, будет потрачен ход - и _ещё_ один ход, чтобы переключиться на оружие после магии.

В итоге почти в любом бою ты неизбежно теряешь жизнь. Которая сама не восстанавливается. Нет, там попадаются вещи с зачарованием типа ""восстановить 10 единиц здоровья раз в 30 ходов"", а по номинальной цене можно купить лечилок, которые полностью вылечивают всё. Но лечилок всего пять, а 10 единиц - это ни о чём, когда один удар врага снимает 50. Причём если ты рукопашник и враг рукопашник - крутиться ещё как-то можно. Но стоит столкнуться с дистанционными атаками и получаем замечательный дурдом, когда любой бой неизбежно заканчивается потерей половины жизни. А подобных врагов там - далеко не один.

В целом, я так и не понял, нравится мне эта игра или нет. Как казуальный рогалик без претензий на одну-две миссии за раз - играть можно. Но ни на что серьёзное эта игра не претендует точно.",1507396023,1507396157,True,16,0,0.696181416511535645,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First of all, this game reminds me greatly of the 'Braveland Trilogy' and that being said you can already create a pretty good idea about, ''if you're actually going to like it or not'' because i know such games might be a bit too boring for some.. I'm a bit of a geek so i guess i couldn't go wrong with owning a copy of this nice looking and fun to play game. 
But again, it's just like i said before, you'll either going to love or hate it but that doesn't make this a bad game if you don't like it.
And that's precisely why i'm letting you guys know, why i personally like this game a lot.

Let's talk about the graphics: The game looks pretty nice and cartooney (like Braveland and such) and the animations are nicely done although don't expect blitzes all over the screen or bright flashes because this game is by all means not a AAA graphical masterpiece! But all in all, it looks pretty nice, it doesn't glitch and it works well with everything else.. So what's not good about that, right?
Let's talk about the music/sound: The music for this game is pretty much kept simple although the tunes are catchy and the animation/effects etc all sound just as one would expect from such a game. It works pretty well together impo.
Now let's talk about the gameplay: The gameplay is set up in turnbased mode as soon as you encounter enemies or obstacles such as hidden traps etc. The grid/map is also devided in tiles, so each step you make will be on one of those tiles each turn. While in battle (outside battle those limitations are absent) you'll need to do some planning as to whether to move, change weapons, cast spells or heal yourself during the turn/time you're given. Everything is done in steps so make note of that when you're used to playing a dungeon crawler and you like to rush in like Rambo because this is not such a game.. You will be whimpy at first, but soon enough you'll be wearing nice armor, wielding massive weapons and using destructive spells (you can explore, craft/sell stuff) all at the same time which i personally think is a really nice way to let you as a player experiment freely. Also you'll earn a ton of experience along the many main and sub quests, so each time you earn a level up you can invest those points into 3 separate skills such as Power, Finesse, and Stamina. (and you'll unlock more buildings along the way too that upgrade/sell you all kinds of neat stuff..)

There are 3 primary character based skills, namely: 'Power, Finesse and Stamina'..
Power: Speaks for itself as it will allow the player to boost the strength of the character, including increasing the damage output for all his attacks.
Finesse: Is your basic dodge, shield, luck counter that will affect pretty much everything you do so don't ignore that skill!
Stamina: Works hand in hand with Power, because both make sure you can remain longer in tough battles while making it possible to dish out a world of hurt to those that seek to end you (it's a Roguelike right).. 
However, you're always accompanied by 1 or two minions etc that can usually hold their own pretty well, unless cornered by bosses or packs of poisonous blobs etc. 
After completing missions you will be rewarded by gaining additional magic points that you can freely spend in the magic skills department which is always helpful when you would or better said will be encountering tougher enemies and bosses. Note that each enemy has resistances and weaknesses so make sure to spend those points at the earliest sign you're encountering foes that are immune to your current skill/weapon sets etc.
Don't worry though, because you can freely adjust your character within any level so just keep your eyes open when you're facing an enemy because it will be made clearly visible as to what his/her strengths and weaknesses are. 

I can say much more about this fun game, but it is probably best that i don't spoil you guys too much and so all that's really left for me to say is, get the game at a sales and play it just like i did and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as i do too.",1507316095,1507737736,True,16,0,0.650479137897491455,4,True,False,False,False,,,

While its cartoony appearance may suggest a more suggest a more casual gameplay experience, Rogue Wizards is a challenge and easily accessible dungeon crawler in which your weapon choice and play style aren’t dictated by character class, but by user preference. It’s suited and long and, though the story is your typical you’re-a-hero-now-save-the-world affair, it does a good job of keeping you engaged run after run. It doesn’t do anything groundbreaking, but that doesn’t make it a bad game in the slightest.

[i]”You’re a wizard, [insert name here].”[/i]

Rogue Wizard throws you right into the action and that first dungeon where you clamber around in the dim depths searching for anywhere that could lead out is a pretty good representation of the rest of your dungeon diving career. When you first enter a dungeon, you can’t see anything beyond your line of sight. Moving about, either with the WASD keys or your mouse, dispels the darkness and fills in your mini-map. As you uncover the rest of the floor, you’ll be greeted by breakable objects, treasure chests, doohickeys of magical origin that allow you to fast-travel between rooms and, of course, monsters.

Once you step into the line of sight of the dungeon’s monster denizens, it's kill or be killed. Combat is turn-based, meaning that using item and spells and changing your equipped weapon takes one turn and you’ll have to wait until all of the other enemies take their turns before moving again.

Your range is decided by the weapon you have equipped and you change them freely by using the corresponding numerical keys. There’s a good variety of both ranged and melee some with their own elemental attributes, so use whatever suits your tastes and the elemental affinity of the monster at hand. Spells can be used regardless of the weapon you have equipped and casting one costs [spell stones] of the corresponding element, and defeating monsters. Monsters also drop keys, which open chests that contain gold, equipment, and spell stones.

One of the more unusual things you can find in dungeons is missing townsfolk. Upon their rescue, they’ll return to home base and set up a business. This light city building element is complimented by the fact that you can upgrade a store and therefore its stock by buying and selling items to gain experience and then by using materials found during your run. You can also find companions, though those are a rarity.

Every dungeons has a hulking boss monster that you must defeat before leaving. These giant beasts will test you skills and keep you on your toes as they will have their own gimmicks that you’ll need to counter in order to fight effectively.
Levelling up awards you with attribute spell points. There are three attributes: strength (increases damage), finesse (increases block chance and your ability to disarm traps found in dungeons), and stamina (increases defense). Spells fall under one five elements—fire, ice, sky, earth, and cosmic—and there are four tiers of spells that can be learned by unlocking the tire proceeding it.

Your equipment can also increase in rank with regular usage and each rank will grant you with an enchantment. They have their own max rank, which means that a weaker piece of equipment can surpass a stronger one depending on its growth limit. Equipment can also be socketed with gems if they have slots available. Gems add useful effects like increased equipment rank and elemental affinity.

.Pros.
[List] [*] Quick and easy to pick up gameplay.
[*] The shop improvement system allows to upgrade the weapons and armour sold at will--assuming you have the right item.
[*] The character models reflect the equipment. A nice touch.
[*] Pets are helpful, not merely vanity.[/list]

.Cons.
[list][*]Gameplay can get repetitive in large doses.
[*]Ranged weapons have a clear advantage over melee due to the skittish nature of enemies.
[*]Spell stones are few and far in between at times, limiting your magic usage. Which is fine, but sometimes killing creatures without using their elemental weakness takes forever and a day.
[*]The game is slow to start, meaning it'll be entirely too easy until it hits its stride.[/list]

Here's a quick gameplay video without commentary: https://youtu.be/6_tyiy5XPL4

.Bottom Line.

If you’re on the market for a title that isn’t too demanding, Rogue Wizards is a good bet. The game is like the starter version for the genre in which you’ll find an amended version of the skill trees, character customization, and other such aspects—so those who seek those gameplay elements should steer clear. As a fan of the genre, I liked what I played, but I can definitely see where there’s room for improvement as far as depth and quality of life.

Rogue Wizards is a new turn-based rogue-like dungeon crawler for PC and mobile from indie developers, Spellbind Studios.

In Rogue Wizards' story mode, you take the role of a 'Banlit': traditionally working citizens who are unable to use magic. You find a magic scroll that teleports you to a dungeon in an unknown part of the land of Rilfanor, where a friendly fighter named Pallom is waiting for you.

Progressing through the dungeon with Pallam at your side, as well as a friendly creature who joins you, you eventually find the exit portal and find yourself in the magical town of Antarit. There Merrol, an innkeeper and wizard, as well as an 'Elam' -- one of the magic-using citizens -- is raising an army of magic users to fight the evil Hosperak, all around bad guy wizard. She tells you that even though you are a Banlit, you can obviously use magic, or the scroll's magic wouldn't have worked. And she needs your help.

Hosperak has opened portals to the elemental realms, from which he is stealing magical power. He has already taken over the Guild Council, and he cares not for the disruption and destruction that his actions are having on the rest of the land.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Rogue Wizards is played from an isometric view, with dungeons (where you'll spend most of your time in the game) made up of tiles of various types. There's some variation in the tiles, with different elemental themes obvious in different dungeons, as well as the typical stone walls and floors.

Character and creature graphics are two-dimensional: large and colourful with a cartoonish style. They look very much like a modern mobile game, but work well on PC, too. It's unfortunate that you only have a choice of two character graphics to choose from -- one male and one female -- and the changes to your character as you find and equip different items are very limited; though you have multiple equipment slots, only weapon types, major armour types (cloth, leather, etc), and shield types change your character's appearance, and even then only with major equipment type changes.

Animations are good, and there's a good range of special attacks, spells, and other effects, that look nice. They do sometimes take a while, though, so after you've played through a few dungeons you may find yourself wanting to speed up the gameplay a little.

Your visibility in the dungeons is very limited: typically only five or six tiles. The game features a weird effect that I don't think I've seen before, where the world just disappears into blackness at the edge of your visibility range, but when you move the tiles in front of you at the edge of visibility drop down from above to form the map, and the tiles behind you at the extent of your range fall away off the bottom of the screen. It's sort of cool, but at the same time rather disconcerting.

Graphics options are minimal and limited to the usual resolution, full-screen / windowed toggle, and vsync. I didn't experience any graphical performance issues, but the game is turn based and quite slow to play. The Steam overlay is a little bit broken, with Achievement and other pop ups sometimes hanging about, corrupted, in the lower right of the game screen.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Music is quite nice, and exactly what you'd expect from a fantasy dungeon crawler: mainly instrumental mediaeval-style tunes.

Sound effects are okay, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's a mobile game and is pretty family friendly, so don't expect screams of terror or grunts of pain. It's the typical ""swish, bash, oof"" type of sounds.

There are no voices.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Rogue Wizards is turn-based, tile-based rogue-like dungeon crawler. It has two modes of play: story mode and 'gauntlet' mode. Story mode gives you a rather hackneyed plot (with plenty of little grammatical errors) and a town with people to talk to and shops to visit between dungeons, while perma-death gauntlet mode does away with all of the extras and just gives you dungeon after dungeon through which you can crawl until you die, or tire of the experience.

In both modes, the core gameplay is essentially the same: start at the first level of a dungeon, kill and loot everything until you find the portal or stairs down to the next level, and then do it all again. Each dungeon level also has up to three bonus goals: kill all creatures, loot all chests, and disarm all traps. Completing these gives you an experience bonus, which increases with dungeon difficulty and level. I don't normally bother with the traps, since finding them is largely a matter of luck and it just takes too long. In story mode some dungeons also have special bosses. Killing these tends to give you better loot, as well as move the plot along.

As with all good games in the genre, dungeons and loot are procedurally generated, though the variation in loot seems relatively limited, with only a small number of basic weapon and armour types, and a relatively small number of modifiers to them as well. Even so, there's still some pleasure to be had when finding a legendary item with many good bonuses.

Items in Rogue Wizards gain ranks as you use them, which is a nice feature. You can't tell what effect gaining a rank will have, but it's always beneficial. I think any of the item bonuses are available as rank bonuses and they seem to be randomly assigned. They also have 'sockets', similar to other games in the genre. You can insert gems into these sockets to grant certain bonuses, and, as usual, you can't remove them once added.

Spells are a staple of the genre, and they're included here, too, though with a slightly annoying caveat. Each spell uses elemental materials that you have to collect and cart about with you, so the size of your spell repertoire tends to be inversely proportional to your available inventory space. It's a bit of a pain and doesn't really add anything, in my opinion, other than frustration. Progression in the game is relatively weak, limited to three characteristics that you can increase as you level up and spell points to buy new or upgraded spells.

You can gain allies, both temporary and permanent, in both modes. The permanent ones are pets, which follow you about until they die. In story mode even death is not the end, and they'll resurrect of their own accord before too long. But in gauntlet mode that's it; you'll have to find another friend. It's unfortunate, then, that the AI is rather terrible; you'll quite often lose your companion to stupidity.

There's one design decision that makes combat much less fun than it could be for me, too: changing weapons, spells, or pretty much anything else, costs you a turn. Since you can only see a handful of tiles in any direction, each dungeon invariably turns into a battle of attrition, at least until you get an item that heals you with time, and then you just wander about aimlessly until you’re healed. Creatures that knock you back make it even worse, especially when coupled with ranged enemies.

[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]
Pros:
+ Dual modes increase replayability
+ Procedural generation works pretty well
+ Steam Achievements

Cons:
- Silly action costs for swapping active weapons/spells
- Not enough variation in loot
- Limited character graphics
- Limited progression
- Short visibility

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
I'm a huge fan of rogue-like dungeon crawlers, but I'm a bit disappointed with Rogue Wizards. I'd like it so much more if the developers hadn't chosen to limit visibility so drastically and then penalise you for swapping weapons or wanting to use your spells.

If you're a fan of the genre and like the style then by all means take a look. It's not a bad game; it's just not a fantastic one either.

- Bastion pour l'aspect graphique, le ""bastion"" flottant qu'on fait évoluer au fur et à mesure qu'on avance dans le jeu et la manière dont les éléments du décor apparaissent. 
- Torchlight pour tout le reste (ou n'importe quel hack and slash en fait) : les familiers qui vous accompagne, le loot des armes avec stats aléatoires, la possibilité d'enchanter les items jusqu'à x fois; de leur mettre un emplacement pour y mettre des gemmes, le fait de level up nos équipements en les utilisant, etc.

Eh oui, pour moi ce jeu n'est pas un rogue-like. Il y a bien deux modes de jeu, mais le mode principal qui a été le plus travaillé donne plus l'impression de jouer à un hack and slash au tour par tour qu'autre chose (il n'y a même pas de mort définitive par exemple).

Pendant les premières heures, le jeu parait tout de même sympathique. Il est plutôt joli, le bestaire semble vaste et varié, le fait de looter des items avec des stats donne envie d'en avoir d'avantage mais rapidement tout cela s'essoufle...

Déjà, quand on level up on a le choix qu'entre 3 stats à faire monter : Puissance, Finesse et Endurance. La puissance c'est ce qui va régir les dégats de nos sorts et de nos attaques avec les armes (pas de stat intelligence ou équivalent ??), la finesse va nous donner un pourcentage de chance de bloquer avec les boucliers ou de faire des critiques, l'endurance augmente la défense et les points de santé. 

C'est complètement idiot. 

Les stats sont tellement mal foutues que je suis sûr que tous les joueurs finissent avec la même répartition des points. Je voulais partir sur un build chakram/critique. Naïf que j'étais, je pensais que le jeu permettait différents builds. J'ai fini le jeu, sans le rusher, avec à peu près 250 points de stats à répartir. Sachant qu'il faut attribuer 100 points en finesse pour avoir 10% de chance de critique, avec une gemme de critique sur mon chakram, le maximum que j'ai jamais pu atteindre c'est 30% de chance de crit. Incroyable.

Ce qui amène au deuxième point fâcheux. Le fait de level up les armes en les utilisant est une super idée en soi. Le problème c'est que les enchantements que nos objets gagnent sont complètement random. J'aurais apprécié par exemple qu'un item qui a déjà un enchantement de vol de vie aient plus de chance d'améliorer cette stat, idem pour les chance de critique, etc. Mais non. Vous finirez avec une épée qui aura tous les enchantements suivants : + 5 puissance, vol de vie 12, 2% de chance de lancer brulure, 5% de chance de lancer silence, +56 xp sur les kills, 3% de chance de lancer horde. Que des stats qui n'ont aucun lien entre elles, dont vous avez pas grand chose à foutre et sur lesquelles vous n'avez aucun contrôle. En plus de ça, on dirait que les développeurs ont eu tellement peur de ""casser"" leur jeu que toutes les stats que vous débloquerez ne dépasseront jamais 7%. 

C'est fade et lassant.

D'autant plus que même en m'étant planté dans mon ""build"", j'ai trouvé le jeu d'une facilité... Vous n'aurez aucun mal à finir le jeu en 10-12 heures. La faute principalement à des sorts mal équilibrés. C'est bien gentil de donner des résistances et des faiblesses aux ennemis, mais si les deux sorts de zone les plus puissants font partie des deux écoles de magie opposées, vous n'avez qu'à maxer ces deux là et c'est gagné. [spoiler]En fait, vous pouvez même vous contenter de spammer Champs Electrique, il n'y aura aucune résistance.[/spoiler]

Le jeu a des qualités, mais malheureusement elles sont toujours contrebalancées par d'autres défauts : 
- tous les monstres ont des attaques et des capacités différentes, hélas il n'y en a qu'une petite dizaine et on est rapidement gavé de toujours croiser les mêmes têtes.
- les familiers et les alliés c'est cool, mais l'IA est totalement à la ramasse. D'ailleurs un petit conseil : préférez les familiers attaquant à distance.
- avoir différentes écoles de magie qu'on peut level up assez rapidement, c'est sympa, mais tout ça est très déséquilibré et il n'y a que 18 sorts (dans un jeu qui comporte le mot ""wizard"" dans son titre, un comble).

Je trouve le jeu trop cher pour ce qu'il a à offrir. Le gameplay n'est pas maitrisé, les actions sont très basiques. On a jamais l'impression d'avoir des choix importants à faire. Tout est fade, comme la direction artistique. Si vous voulez vraiment un ""rogue-like"" mignon, je vous conseille plutôt Sproggiwood. Lui non plus n'est pas long, mais il a le mérite d'avoir un gameplay bien foutu. 
Si vraiment vous voulez tater du hack and slash au tour par tour, Rogue Wizards peut éventuellement combler ce manque (à un prix bien plus bas que les 15 euros demandés cependant). Gardez juste à l'esprit qu'il s'agit d'un petit jeu et qu'il ne faut pas être trop exigeant.

Avec son interface utilisateur laissant clairement penser que le soft a été étudié pour un portage rapide vers les smartphones après son arrivée sur PC et Mac, sa 2D isométrique simple mais propre et agréable à la rétine ainsi que sa tentative de surfer sur la vague ""rogue-lite"", Spellbind Studios propose malgré tout un titre efficace, accrocheur et non dénué d'originalité.

*Rogue Wizards* est avant tout, contrairement à ce que son nom peut laisser croire, un dungeon-rpg, au même titre que les *Pokémon Donjon Mystère*, ou encore *Final Fantasy Fables : Chocobo's Dungeon* sur Wii et, dans une certaine mesure, *Legend of Grimrock* (l'aspect ""première personne"" en moins) . Il faut admettre que le genre a vieillit et qu'il n'est plus légion aujourd'hui, certainement en raison de la répétitivité ayant tendance à s'installer assez rapidement, défaut dont ne se passe pas le soft en question. C'est pour cette raison que le studio a fait le choix de la mâtiner d'éléments issus de genres plus populaires, tels que le hack'n'slash et, surtout, le rogue-like. Évidemment, sinon le titre serait mensonger !

Le joueur erre donc dans des donjons au nombre d'étages changeant, et dont la configuration est générée de façon procédurale. Tous sont ainsi différents sans exception. La position et la nature des créatures, des pièges, des coffres, du marchand ou encore de la sortie varie systématiquement, obligeant le joueur à établir une stratégie globale et non en fonction du level design. Il pourra compter sur une multitude de sorts à améliorer et débloquer en montant de niveaux, et surtout sur mille-et-un choix d'équipement. Les armes, charmes et armures sont, à l'instar des donjons, générés aléatoirement. Qu'ils soient communs, rares, divins, ronds, carrés, magiques, puissants, faibles, ou qu'ils renforcent puissance, vie, sorts... les combinaisons sont incalculables. Ce modèle de ""loot"" (autrement dit ""butin"" pour les non-initiés) est quasi identique à celui d'un *Diablo* ou d'un *Torchlight*. L'or et l'équipement coulent à flots, dès lors que vous abattez une créature ou dénichez un coffre, tandis que l'expérience monte à flèche à n'importe quelle occasion. Le loot et le level up sont réellement outranciers. Vous me demanderez certainement : ""Mais qui n'apprécie pas l'accueil d'une nouvelle pièce de choix dans son inventaire, ainsi que la répartition des points d'expériences dans les statistiques de notre préférence ?"". Probablement personne, j'en conviens. Toutefois, dans *Rogue Wizards*, vous ne ferez pas trois pas sans récolter quelque chose. Donner en surplus, c'est rendre l'inédit superflus et tuer le bonheur du joueur lors d'une trouvaille hors du commun. 

Quant au scénario, il ne faudra point compter dessus pour déchaîner votre passion. Il demeure malheureusement simple et générique : un sorcier maléfique met en péril l'équilibre de la magie, ce qui a pour effet de créer des failles d'où sortes de vilaines créatures. Sa présence demeure clairement un prétexte pour nettoyer davantage de donjons. Et justement, en parlant de créatures, il est à signaler que le bestiaire est d'une pauvreté inacceptable pour le prix du jeu. Elles se comptent probablement sur les dix doigts de la main, sans toutefois compter les dérivées. Le character design, aucunement mauvais, ne marquera pas nécessairement les esprits pour autant. 

Mais alors, qu'est-ce que *Rogue Wizards* possède afin de scotcher le joueur ? Tout d'abord, comme il a été évoqué en début de review, la réalisation demeure réellement soignée. Au fur et à mesure que le joueur se meut, les décors, par ailleurs plutôt variés, se déroulent littéralement sous ses yeux. Cet effet est même personnalisable dans les options. Fondu entrant / sortant, augmentation / diminution du décor, montée et chute des blocs composant le sol... il est appréciable de pouvoir s'approprier l'esthétique du jeu. Les musiques ne sont pas en reste et habillent habilement la 2D colorée un tantinet cartoonesque, la surlignant par une belle ambiance. 

Vous ne serez pas toujours seul lors de votre périple. Vous débloquerez des compagnons. Quatre sont disponibles, et chacun peut servir un rôle particulier, en maîtrisant un type de magie spécifique. Tout comme votre personnage, l'entraînement leur permettrons de grimper en niveaux. Il faudra également compter sur d'autres personnages. Certains seront secourus grâce à vous et se rangeront dans vos rangs, alors que d'autres vous prêterons volontiers main forte dans les temps difficiles, notamment en fin de scénario, afin de venir à bout des grands vilains. Ces mêmes protagonistes feront évoluer votre cité. Ils endosseront divers rôles : forgeron, alchimiste, trésorier ou encore joailler. Votre village s'étendra progressivement, et votre rôle sera d'upgrader les compétences de la majeure partie à l'aide d'items spéciaux et / ou d'or. Définit comme un trait ""city-builder"", où le joueur bâtirait et customiserait lui-même Antarit, il faut admettre que cette qualification est exagérée. Vous n'aurez jamais la possibilité de choisir l'emplacement de tel ou tel marchand, ni l'apparence de quoi que ce soit. Malgré tout, ce trait léger est un point positif.

Une teinte de crafting est également de la partie. Ici, point de mana pour utiliser la magie, mais des matériaux. Si vous croisez un chaudron bien bouillant au cours d'une expédition, vous aurez l'opportunité de fabriquez la matière nécessaire pour les éléments de la magie qui vous manquent, ou encore pour créer des potions de santé.

Rogue Wizards se joue bien entendu au tour par tour, ce qui lui vaut un petit aspect tactical. Plutôt que de jouer un et unique type d'arme comme dans d'autres RPG et genres en découlant, il sera préférable de s'adapter à chaque situation et à chaque monstre. Certaines créatures ont la sale manie de vouloir vous distancer, ainsi un arc ou un couteau de lancer vous sera nettement plus utile qu'une hache ou qu'une épée. En cas de mêlée, la hache dispose du clair avantage de frapper les ennemis positionnés sur les cases annexes. Quant à la magie, allez-vous dépenser vos points afin de couvrir l'ensemble de l'arbre de sortilèges ? Maîtriser l'ensemble les éléments afin de toucher le point faible de tout adversaire vous semble alors la meilleure stratégie ? Ou bien allez-vous en privilégier une mince poignée dans le but de les rendre plus puissants ? Le choix est votre !

Enfin, et c'est bien là ce qui plaira le plus au amateurs de rogue-like, il existe un mode alternatif de survie, où le but est d'aller le plus loin possible sans mourir. On retrouve également ce mode à débloquer au sein du mode histoire, à la différence près que la mort n'est, cette fois-ci, pas permanente. 

*Rogue Wizards* est l'un de ces petits jeux qu'il est préférable d'attraper en promotion lorsqu'on en a l'occasion, pourvu que l'on soi amateur du genre. Le soft de Spellbind Studio ravira toutefois davantage les fans de dungeon-RPG que de rogue-like pur et dur. Il bénéficie de véritables qualités, mais ses cruels défauts l'empêche d'atteindre le haut du panier.

For those looking for a challenge there is the gauntlet which is basically a ""dive down as deep as you can till you die"" mode.

The visuals are very charming; reminds me of shatterred planet which is a game that's probably not well known, but in short the 2D sprites and animations are just fantastic.

Enemies all have their own strategies and powers so it's never just about moving one grid point or waiting so you can hack them.  You'll get to know (and hate) a lot of them as they will use powers of their own to try and mess you up.

Equipment also has ranks (levels) and each piece levels up as you explore and/or use them.  So for example after firing my bow a few dozen times it can upgrade and get a new affix like +10% crit hit or something else random.  Very cool, I had one piece that had leveled up 4-5 times and was crazy good; very sad when I had to upgrade it.

The game runs on my potato computer too which is great.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, it's a game I'll play for hours on end.

[h1]Pontos positivos[/h1]

- Grande variedade de itens com bons efeitos, tornando o processo de aquisição de itens viciante, pois você constantemente sente que está ficando melhor equipado e mais poderoso. Há itens por exemplo que ajudam a detectar armadilhas, aumentam a chance de obter equipamentos raros, congelam os inimigos, etc.

- Boa variedade de magias, com efeitos que compensam um pouco a falta de variedade tática do combate padrão. Elas estão divididas em 6 elementos, cada um com 3 magias, totalizando 18 opções, desde invocar torres que dão choques nos inimigos até buracos negros que matam tudo instantaneamente e chuvas de meteoros.

- Alguns inimigos têm habilidades especiais legais, tais como ficar invisível, teleportar outros inimigos pra cima de você, deixar o chão todo escorregadio ou mesmo jogar lama na sua cara (esse por incrível que pareça é o mais mortal de todos, pois toda a interface fica invisível e você não consegue acessar o inventário para usar itens ou trocar de armas, e nem ver sua vida), entre várias outras.

- Qualidade de animação excelente. Tudo muito fluido.

- Tem versão grátis para celular! Essa porém têm microtransações na forma de cristais que você pode comprar para ganhar vantagens, o que não existe na versão para Steam, e provavelmente deve ter propagandas também (não testei para saber).

- Constantemente recebe atualizações quase um ano após o lançamento. O desenvolvedor é muito ativo no fórum e realmente leva em conta as sugestões dos jogadores.

- Jogo muito bem ""polido"". Pouquíssimos bugs, e esbanja qualidade no geral.

[h1]Pontos negativos[/h1]

- Como já dito, o combate é simplista. Apesar da relativa variedade de tipos de armas, trocar de arma ou equipar uma magia no meio do combate custa um turno, de forma que na maior parte do tempo, compensa mais você atacar com o que já está na mão do que trocar para uma arma mais eficaz contra aquele tipo de inimigo (p. ex. uma arma que seja de um elemento ao qual o inimigo é vulnerável). Isso limita um pouco a variedade do combate, exceto para os inimigos com grande quantidade de vida, no qual o dano extra da outra arma mais do que compensa o turno perdido.

- Um pouco repetitivo às vezes, pois as dungeons são grandes, e uma única dungeon contém sempre os mesmos 3 ou 4 tipos de inimigos. A coisa só varia quando você muda de dungeon, onde ela passa a ser de outro elemento ou tipo.

You may wonder why such a low score? Let me say that this is not a bad score. I'm not scoring it like a movie review where anything below a 7 is AWFUL GARBAGE. This game is not awful garbage. It's actually pretty okay. This is a dead average game, with many games that are better, and many that are worse. Luckily, it can be fixed if the devs decide to do so.

The good:
-The game feels polished. Sometimes when you play a game, you get that nagging feeling not all the features are implemented or something, but not in this game. It feels like a complete game. That doesn't mean I think it's a good game, but I digress.
-The artwork is really great! Wish I had a bit more playable character variety other than white guy/black woman, but indie games usually don't have the budget to expend on stuff like that, especially when the existing characters look so good.
-The music is pretty good, probably a 7/10. I've heard some bad indie game music before, so having something passable is nice. Would I ever buy the OST? No.

The bad:
-While being isometric is not a negative, I'm personally not a fan of games that do ""tile fade in/out"" when you walk forwards. I understand why it was chosen, but for me this makes movement very clunky. At least the minimap allows you to move around without getting lost, and you can click and hold to move in various directions.
-I encountered one major bug, it will probably be fixed at some point when I'll update this review. The bug was that when a very common enemy mudslinger type throws their mud at you, it 'mucks' up the screen (Intentional), which is fine, but if you load a menu or open your inventory the screen goes black and you have to exit the inventory to return to normal view, except now your hotbar disappears. This is a big problem because I don't see how a bug this bad could slip through Q&A. It happens every time with a very common enemy type. For me, this soured my image of a polished game.
UPDATE: After one and a half years, the devs FINALLY fixed this bug. FINALLY.

The really bad:
-Expectations are key. This game creates an image in the steam store that isn't fulfilled ingame. For a game titled ""Rogue Wizards"" you'd expect to have quite the spell variety, eh? No. Jump to 0:28 on the steam store trailer. See that image of the spells? Count them. Each one is a single spell, for a total of 18. In a game about Wizardry, I expected a very diverse array of spells, and instead you only get access to 6 spells to start, then you unlock more as you play after pumping points into some of the crappy early spells you probably didn't like.

-18 Spells isn't necessarily limited. The problem is that spells are not fun to use. There are two types of spell: The type where you press the spell button and they activate instantly (Fun to use) and the kind where you press the spell, it wastes a turn switching to that spell, and then you can cast the spell. Switching back to your normal weapon wastes another turn, meaning if you want to cast a spell just once, you'll waste two turns switching to and from it. The game makes NO distinction between those two types of spells, you just have to try them and remember them.

-Hey you're a smart person, so whatever if the spells are limited and half of them are basically unusable in combat! But the spells are also very finite. The only way to cast a spell is via limited gems that drop from enemies. For example, to cast a Fire type spell, you might need 2 of the red gems. You cannot start earning red gems until you unlock fire magic, and once you do, they will randomly drop up to one at a time from each enemy.
Notice that I said ""Up to"", not that every enemy drops one gem. Many enemies don't drop any. In my experience, it's about 50/50. The enemies on each level are finite, and if you have all 6 magics unlocked, that means you will get one of each gem, on average, for every 12 enemies defeated. Let's say there are about 50 enemies per level (It varies based on size), that means that you will possibly receive 4 of every color by the level's end with a couple extra left over.

The base spells might cost only 2 gems, but some don't, and the upper spells usually cost a lot more. That means if you are in the midgame and you clear an entire level, you might have enough for one or two casts of a magic spell, but that's usually only the base tier spells. Green magic's base spell, for example, costs 15 green gems! Wow!
Finally, there is a finite limit on how many gems you can hold in your inventory of each color. 100. You may have 100 red gems, and 100 blue, and 100 yellow, etc.
So you don't even have the option of stockpiling these gems up for a serious battle. Don't get me wrong, 100 red gems is enough to cast Fireball 50 times, but not the more advanced magics.


This is all fixable, thankfully. The problem is, I'm guessing the game's devs are locked into this system and have balanced around it heavily. A shame. Were I to recommend any changes, it would be these:

1. Remove the limit of 100 gems per color. It's dumb.
2. Make all of the spells instant casts. This is the most important. I can live with all the other issues if I'm not wasting a turn switching to a magic.
3. If you can't even do number 2, the LEAST you could do is differentiate which spells are instant and which ones are not in their descriptions. Edit: Turns out the game does make a distinction. I specifically looked for this yet never saw it, weird.
4. Also, minor quibble, when you unlock a spell, it becomes your equip if it's an equippable spell. This means I will often unlock fireball, return to the game, attack an enemy, and cast a fireball instead of attacking with my previously equipped weapon. I don't know if this is a bug or intended behavior, but I personally don't like it.

TL:DR

The game is really not bad. The enemies are balanced decently enough and the variety is okay (I think there's only like 20 enemies in the entire game excluding bosses though), but the magic system, which this game named itself for, is just abysmal. This is the biggest killer for me.

Also, I thought the story was kind of boring, but the game has zero unskippable cutscenes, so that's a net positive for me.

Other thought: Companions and pets suck. You can't alter their inventories or see their stats or anything, and they can even be a detriment, specifically against replicating slimes. If you deal enough damage to kill a slime in one hit, it won't replicate, but your idiot companion and pet always hit them with weak damage, causing them to replicate. You can't kill them fast enough! 

The companions also charge forwards like idiots into whatever tile hazard is sitting on the ground. ""OOOOH ACID, LET'S CHARGE TO OUR DEATHS!""

I really genuinely dislike them. Giving me some form of control over them would make them a lot more interesting.",1497056953,1546655770,False,55,2,0.709911882877349854,2,True,False,False,False,,,

So far, it seems like a good and polished game.  It's addicting with some of the features found in Diablo and other RPG games, but a Diablo game, it is not...  I don't think it's trying to be a Diablo type game since it's got turn-based combat.  It's more dumbed down than some of the more robus RPG's, but it has it's addicting qualities and has many well thought out features.  There are some great ideas here that will keep you interested and it's fun to play.

There are two game modes you can play.  Story is an RPG game and Gauntlet is a Roguelike game with perma-death. The art, animation and sound are all done very well.  I do wish they let us choose more character models, but I understand how much work that is and it is a single player game.  At least you get to choose male or female and name your character. All weapons, armor and items are reflected on your character when equiped.  So that's a plus.

Some people complained about the tiles popping in and out being a visual problem.  For me, the tiles popping in and out never bothered me and I didn't even notice it after a while.  I just wish more tiles were displayed at one time.  It would make it easier to get around without having to constantly look at the minimap and the maps wouldn't seem so small, but it's not really a problem.

Other's have complained about the combat being slow or clunky, but it's not.  It's as fast as you want it to be and is very strategic IMO!  There is a great amount of effort put into supplying the user with information regarding all weapons, armor, items and enemies.  You won't be wondering what item is better or how to defeat an enemy.  The dev's did a great job on giving the user information! KUDOS!  I WAS very happy with my purchase! See my EDIT below...

EDIT:

After playing longer, the game is just not as fun.  Difficulty ramps up and resources to cast spells are very slim.  You only get to carry 5 healing potions which kind of ruins the game IMO.  I'm not sure I want to continue playing...  Almost too much of a grind even for me who LOVES to grind!

IMO, if they took out the stupid resources needed to cast spells, gave you the usual regenerating mana and took the health potion limit up to 10 or more, it would make the game so much better!  

EDIT AGAIN! So I keep changing my review because the dev's did put A LOT of work into this game and just because I don't like the resources needed to cast spells, is no reason to not recommend this game.  I do keep coming back to play and I did purchase the GOG version also to support the dev's.  So I will recommend this game.

Didn't like the dungeon crawl ""gauntlet"" mode. The game auto spawns helpers, who are as powerful as your main. So any extra damage you get from smart play only adds a minor bonus to party damage. That worked OK in story mode, but not in a permadeath dungeon crawl. The game was worth it to me for the story mode play; but it might be one to add to the wishlist a wait for a sale.

Based on how I killed most of the enemies I killed there was very little need for magic. My axe was so much better than the magic.

The ""mana"" mechanic is in this game is very hindering, bascially you collect items of enemies and crates to fuel your spells. If perhaps every enemy dropped a minimum of 3 mana gems it might make the game actually about an actual wizard. ATM mana items are just too rare to make it even worth it. Its like that super weapon you get in an FPS, the ammo is rare so you end up saving it for a ""big fight"" that never actually comes along. On top of this changing to a spell from a weapon takes a turn, your better off just continueing with your weapon.

The turn based mechanic need to be improved, ATM its overly fustrating. Moving around a map is: Click, Wait, Click, Wait, Click, Wait. Movement should be smooth and free. Changing Weapons / Spells / Items should be free not take a turn. In fact if this were about a Wizard and his ""magic"" Spells should be a completely different bar.

I doubt any of these things will change, they seem to be pretty much the core of the game. Unfortunately im gonna have to give this a thumbs down.",1487396039,1487396584,False,9,1,0.410755127668380737,3,True,False,False,False,,,

It's good for burning 30 minutes to an hour on at a time - but it lacks a certain ""hook"" that other games have.  Otherwise, it's something great to play when no internet is available!

[url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_8AuschIyY3zvEOAx90ieQN7tUnxpAKI]Rogue Wizards Let's Play on YouTube![/url]

This game advertises procedural generation on all maps and items, which I completely believe.  There were certain limits that you could tell the game was bumping up to but that's fine: that's how you balance the game.

The animations are simple, cute, and entertaining.  It's something I could put my kid in front of and not worry about them ever having nightmares or asking me about something lude.  It's all pretty G rated!

Combat is very straight forward, and the controls are simple.  They fall in line with most other games and are very conventional.  All in all, I had a positive experience with nearly everything in the game!  Nearly....

With that out of the way, I'll start covering some of the more negative stuff.  I got very tired of inventory management very quickly.  As someone who doesn't like to sit and min/max, I got a bit overwhelmed with the amount of statistics that could possibly be on each item, and how they would impact my character.  It seems like in the long run it's fairly irrelevant as long as you're updating your gear as you go.

I also didn't like the fact that most of the spells seemed useless?  If you pick just a couple of spells and put all of your points into them, you'll do devastating amounts of damage, as long as the mobs aren't resistant to that spell line.

Finally, the storyline is pretty much non-existent.  They put words on the screen, but they're irrelevant really.

All in all, I enjoyed the game for what I've put into it and would have gladly paid full price for it!  SpellBind studios made a pretty good indie game, and a few of my friends have picked it up after seeing the Let's Play.

Rogue Wizards не покорит вас с первого взгляда, возможно, даже не покорит со второго и там уже по накатаной.  Вообщем, вам определенно должны быть по душе лайтовые рогалики и данжен-кроулеры. И это ещё полбеды, ещё вам должны нравится простенькие сюжеты, не шибко разнообразный лут и примитивная магия.

Назвать Rogue Wizards данжен-кроулером язык не поворачивается, но основной уклон был сделан именно на это. Только тут есть тихая гавань, где можно и скрафитить чего-нибудь и улучшить уже то, что есть, поторговаться и запросить помощь. Заодно и очередное задание взять. Так и будете скитаться от городка к подземельям. В это время сюжет будет ненавязчиво рассказывать историю борьбы «волшебного» человечества против великого зла.

Основным местом прибывания будут подземелья. Их воплощение может кому-то и не понравится, например мне, потому что всплывающие и улетающие вникуда кубики земли это не очень удобно и глаз быстро устает от постоянного скольжения пикселей по экрану. К сожалению, это фишка игры и изменить этого нельзя. От этого неудобства отлично отвлекают события происходящие с нами. Во-первых, уровни подземелий генерируются случайно, что в некотором роде отходит от классической системы данженов (помните, игроки раньше рисовали карту на бумажке), во-вторых, множество разных противников с уникальными способностями, но их оказывается не так уж и много, чтобы удивлять бесконечно, да и уникальных боссов как таковых не имеется.

Все же, если есть желание проникнуться к Rogue Wizards, советую сперва обратиться к режиму Gauntlet. В нем вы по настоящему сможете оценить то, чего хотели показать игрокам разработчики. Это и пошаговая система боя, которую придется использовать с умом, если хотите продержаться как можно дольше, и с первого взгляда простенькое, но разнообразное меню магических заклинаний, и целое море лута. В Rogue Wizards все относительно скудновато. Шесть магических школ, пару десятков орудий, несколько видов декораций подземелий. Во всем чувствуется аскетичность.

Разработчики явно старались не халтурить, но, видимо, ресурсов было не достаточно, чтобы создать нечто оригинальное. Идеальным решением для Rogue Wizards это реализация проекта на планшете. Я прям представляю сидишь такой унылым утром в битком набитом транспорте и ловко так скачешь от клетке к клетке, покоряешь подземелья и купаешься в луте. Раз и вот час в дороге пролетел незаметно, но пока что мультяшный рогалик в подземелье доступен лишь в Steam и ждет, чтобы его купили и поиграли, чтобы тем самым простимулировать выход игры на планшете.

W sumie dlaczego light? Oryginalny rogue był grą jeszcze bardziej uproszczoną, a nasza postać to był znaczek '@' bez względu na to jaki ekwipunek nosiła. Przecież nie każdy rogal musi być od razu przyrównywany do ADOM, ToME czy NetHacka. Rogue Wizards jest z pewnością grą o mniejszym stopniu złożoności w porównaniu do wymienionych tytułów. Doskonale broni się zastosowaną mechaniką, która powoduje, że można wybaczyć mu pewne braki w zbalansowaniu.
Zdecydowanie nie jest prawdą, że gra nie stanowi żadnego wyzwania. Na poziomie normalnym śmierć nie jest permanentna i zabita postać wraca do miasta aby rozpocząć nową przygodę. Dodatkowo zdobyte przedmioty są zachowane, więc gra się tak długo, aż się wygra. 
Zupełnie inaczej przedstawia się tryb hard i gauntlet, który stanowi po prostu loch z nieskończoną liczbą poziomów. W tych trybach gra kończy się w momencie, gdy zdrowie postaci spadnie do zera, a o to na wyższych poziomach nietrudno. Nasi przeciwnicy są bardzo zróżnicowani pod względem rodzajów ataków, umiejętności i odporności. Zmiana broni, przygotowanie większości czarów czy łyknięcie mikstury zdrowia to jedna tura, przez co każda czynność w walce powinna zostać przemyślana. Każdy czar wymaga zużycia pewnej ilości materiałów, więc zarządzanie posiadanymi zasobami jest również ważne.
Nasz ekwipunek jest bardzo zróżnicowany. Dodatkowo w trakcie używania zwiększa się jego ranga, co wpływa na ilość posiadanych przez niego zaklęć. Ta również może zostać zwiększona poprzez specjalnie do tego przeznaczone miejsca, na które można natknąć się eksplorując lochy, bądź za odpowiednią opłatą w mieście. Prawidłowy dobór ekwipunku stawia nas przed kolejnymi wyborami, decydującymi o tym czy przetrwamy kolejną przygodę.
Awans na kolejne poziomy pozwala dodać punkty do trzech podstawowych cech postaci. Również tutaj zalecana jest rozwaga, ponieważ od ilości tych punktów zależy, czy będziemy w stanie używać nowo zdobytego przedmiotu. Dużo większe znaczenie ma jednak rozwijanie szkół magii. Napotykane bestie są odporne na niektóre z nich, lecz wrażliwe na inne.

After finishing the game in about 15 hours of very casual play I'm left feeling disappointed.  

Its okay.  Okay is fine for $5 but its not a $5 game (yet).   Rogue Wizards provides a very linear, rather predictable story and there's not much variety in the ways you can approach the game.   I ended up using a bow for 90% of the game and from other reviews it appears that this is a common strategy.   I would expect more motivation to specialize in either melee, ranged weapons, or spells.  You have the opportunity to use all three but there's not much ability to customize your character and approach to getting through the dungeons.  You throw out some occasional spells for the boss battles, but otherwise its a just click on things until they die.   

The graphics are rather well done and nicely animated.  Its fun to look at so the artists deserve a great deal of praise for their character and level design.   The inferface works well, its mostly clicking to move and attack with a few keyboard shortcuts.   There's a danger in turn based games to feel like you're constantly waiting for things to finish (like the recent Wasteland sequels) but action is very quick and only seems to lag when there are a very large number of characters on the screen.  

Overall it has a lot of potential but the storyline and customization are lagging.   I'm not sure if Its Okay is enough to recommend a game.

Easy to learn, addictive and oozing charm and polish. I can't remember the last time i played a game for 10 hours within a day.

This is for you if:
+ You love upgrading stuff and progressing
+ You enjoy light strategic thinking, but don't care for complex decision-making
+ Good variety for you means adjusting your tactics and weapons to the particular combination of enemies you face
+ You value polish and charm more than realistic graphics.
+ You don't need more than a very simple charming cliche-ish story, with minimal text to read, non-voiced

This is NOT for you if:
- You like complex civilization-type grand strategy and get annoyed by very light strategy
- Good variety for you means an open world or 100 different biomes
- You need a well thought complex plot with twists and characters you can identify with
- You value in-game music very much (i'm just using spotify instead...)

The kind of enjoyment i got from this game looks something like this:
> ""New level reached! Let's see what the next level of spells do then.. Sh!t, i wish i could have all of them...""
> ""Oh cr@p, replicating blobs AND egg-laying birds? Let me take a few seconds to think weapons and positioning...""
> ""Quest done! Now let's go sell my junk to the vendors, upgrade said vendors and see what new shiny weapons and armor they get with each upgrade!""
> ""Hmm should i keep using my 200dmg-health leaching-sword which has reached its level cap, or go for this 190dmg that still has 4 more levels to go? You know what, give me both - i'll slowly level up the new one and use the old one for hairy situations...""
> ""So i stocked up on health potions, upgraded all vendors and bought the best weapons available (for now) and i still got a ton of money. Time to go crazy on the upgrading shrine! DING! plus 15 earth damage... DING! 200% critical damage... DING! 5 health leach per hit...""

Depending on which mode you choose, the Rogue standard of Perma-death is present, where if you fall in combat once, it's start over from go. There is turn based combat on a grid and a small amount of tactical decisions to be made based off elemental magic. Despite all of those features I wanna be up front and honest, the game to me feels more like a Roguelite-lite. I know that sounds silly and makes no sense but it would if you played the game. It hits most marks to be considered a Roguelike but I found there to be something missing. I enjoyed the game don't get me wrong, I beat it even which is something I wouldn't do if I didn't enjoy it. Despite that either due to difficulty or perhaps design choices, Rogue Wizards is missing a certain je ne sais quoi.

Moving on to the aforementioned games modes. The first is story mode where you have a decent little narrative about a suppressed people being told they could never use magic, suddenly discovering in fact they can and that the powers that be, are corrupt. The second is a Gauntlet mode where you don't have any of the story bits and its just pure dungeon-go-go. Each has a hard mode to unlock once beaten that features Perma-death. The difference between the two modes is minimal, so much so that I would say if you have zero interest in the story, then Gauntlet felt like a hollow experience. I preferred the story mode as it gives you a break between the dungeons and lets you sort yourself out far as loot and upgrading the city of Antarit.

Antarit is where the story progresses, and you begin to collect your army to fight the evil wizards. Additionally you begin to unlock buildings in Antarit that allow you to purchase supplies, armor, weapons, enchantments, pets and other nifty things. Its very crucial because, without that break, non-stop dungeoning might of driven me mad. Certain stores/locations in Antarit can be upgraded by collecting gold from your sold loot or fallen foes. The UI/Interactions are just like the rest of the game its all based off your mouse. Nothing too complicated. Take out Antarit and you've got Gauntlet mode, that's basically it.

So you make your little wizard, name him, no customization sadly, and then you're off!

You kill stuff, collect shiny loot and level. When you level, you upgrade three stats of your choosing. I mention this solely based off the fact its just there, because this was never a factor at any point in my playthrough. I just kept all my stats around the same number and I was fine. Aside from stats you can upgrade your spell tree which consists of six elements, life, cosmic, fire, ice, earth, lightning. Each has an opposing and damaging element to each other. This never affects you the player but it mostly effects the monsters you face. Each spell element has three spells attached to it in your spellbook.

There are six equipment slots not including weapon slots. Equipment can range from common all the way to Epic with varying degrees of enchantment and abilities. The UI is fairly simple and minimalistic, the reason being, the game is also ported to the mobile market. So while neatly designed, you can clearly see where the mobile factor kicks in.

Getting into the nitty gritty of things you are tasked with bringing balance to the elements by unlocking their perspective realms. You do this by leveling up in randomly generated dungeons. Obviously Rogue Wizards is a game that has high replay ability and little shout outs are thrown in there like, ""The Darkest-est Dungeon"" It's things like this that do give the game charm. I would've loved more of these little Easter eggs in between randomized dungeons.

Upon reaching a certain level, an elemental plane is unlocked and you go fight an evil wizard, get some story bits/loot and repeat until the end of the game. This formula is sadly never deviated from all the way to the end of the game. The final battle is a bit more epic but essentially plays out like all the other wizard battles.

The art style is one that I personally found enjoyable but it does have issues. Despite the cute characters, pets, and spell animations all looking fantastic. the dungeons themselves are going to be a hit and miss. Dungeons have either an illustrated background or are just pure black. Floors rise in or drop out while your characters view distance shifts. The view distance being the primary problem as your character can see up to about five blocks away, which isn't very far. This can become disorienting and even strange looking sometimes as you move about dungeons quickly. Enemy variants are a bit lacking as well. After about the first four to six dungeons you probably have seen most enemy types. No palette swapping and bosses are just giant versions of their normal counter parts.

Combat is by far the most appealing aspect in the game to me. It's actually quite fun to wade into a group of enemies and use a bunch of different weapons to slaughter them all. Chakrams are very OP and Axes can win the game for you. Combat is turned based and most monsters have a myriad of different strategies and abilities so that battles don't become dull.

Sadly, things do become easy, too easy. Bosses are laughable in most cases and I only died if I wasn't paying attention to my health bar. Which would happen on occasion, because I forgot I had health. Movement in combat itself can be brutally slow as you and the enemy move in one space, one turn, sometimes you are granted more depending on enchantments and which enemy you face.  Keep in mind this is purely difficulty based on story mode and not hard mode which could be different. It is still worth mentioning, as it took me sixteen hours to unlock hard mode.

One gripe I do have is the way in which you equip weaponry. You have a quick bar on the bottom of your screen that works as a place to put weapons, spells, and potions. The eight slots are more then enough for you to have whatever you need but the problem lies in the way spells are used in the game. Most attack spells are treated like weapons instead of spells. This wouldn't be a problem if switching weapons in combat didn't cost you a whole round. It felt very counter intuitive going from my Axe/Shield combo to glowing red fireball fist/shield. There are spells that activate instantly without the need to switch. This lead me to just use those spells predominantly and only use attack spells on elemental bosses. This silliness is also heightened by the fact spells cost reagents and have a limited number of use as you are only allowed to carry a hundred of each reagent. It just felt like using magic was more punishing and very situation based, instead of being cool and fun to use.

It should be noted that while I do have some gripes with the game it mostly comes from a place of love. I had a great time playing this game, I just wished there were less kinks in the armor.

Speaking of armor, armor enchantments are random to the point of being silly. When you hit level fifty and find an epic ring, you expect it to have far better enchantments than a ring you found at level ten right? That isn't the case here, as enchantments seemingly don't scale with your level. The example I gave was a real thing, I had a ring with plus ten for two of the stats and seven for the last. I never found anything better even when I found higher quality rings. This occurred several times for all the equipment pieces during my time with the game.

The game does however scale with your level. Monsters are always your exact level so the challenge never changes. The only time it does, is when you meet ""Strong"" version of monsters that have more health and hit harder. Another rare exception to this is when you run into an Elite that is almost like a boss but not quite. These moments",1477458666,1477458676,True,5,0,0.545738577842712402,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The maps are all procedurally generated so no play through is the same times.

Items appear to be procedurally generated as well and on top of that level as you wear them. That garbage item you picked up initially may turn out to be rather impressive once its leveled up a few times.

Characters have an EXP system where as they kill more mobs they gain levels allowing you to customize your character. On top of this there are many different weapon types which you can swap back and forth between at will to change how the game plays. Sword and shield, 2 handed spears, magic, archery, axes, and staffs just to name a few.

The game has two basic gameplay modes to choose from. Campaign and limitless. In the campaign mode you get a story, some quests, a town to level up, as well as dungeons.

In the endless mode its you vs a dungeon that never ends to see how far you can go.

If you want a barebones rogue like experience then endless is your ticket, if you enjoy a bit more roguelite experience with progression then campaign is your game.

Either way I found the game absolutely delightful and believe its well worth its $14,99 price point.

It's a top down, dungeon crawler.  Loot heavy type of game.  If you've played Diablo, Torchlight, Darkstone, etc. than do I really need to go into detail about what kind of game this is?  No, didn't think so.  Okay, I don't recommend it and here's why....

The Bad:
1. The weapons.  These include sword, axe, bow, spear, chakra, staff, and throwing weapons (wands fit into this catagory).  Let me elaborate.  The spear is a two handed weapon, but it gives you no perks in being two handed.  It doesn't hit harder, and you don't get to hit an enemy two squares away from where you stand.  Staffs are the same thing.  So, you're not even going to use them because the sword and axe at least allows you to use a shield.  There's no two handed swords.  You're not going to use the throwing weapons because they have a max of 5 ammo.  That's right, you find an amazing throwing dagger, and you can only use it 5 times, and it's gone.  GONE.  Wands are the same way.  Bows don't use ammo, so you're going to use bows.  So, you only look out for a new swords, bows, axes..that's it.  The Chakra is to laugh at because it's SO weak.  Who cares if it hits multiple enemies if it doesn't even put a dent in them, it's worthless.  Weapons suck.  Oh, yeah, I'm lvl 40 in the game.. max is 50, and I've only come across 2 wands.

2.  The gear.  This is a dungeon crawler and you want to get that new gear right?  Well, there is some good gear, but here's why it's bad.  It'll have a rank, say 30 out of 35.  It'll level as you get hit or walk for boots.  When it ranks up, it'll open up a new random enchant.  That's right RANDOM.  So this is where you'll get pissed.  I have an epic chest piece, and it's at rank 34 of 35.  I find a new chest piece, and I'm like, but I really like this armor that I have.  I'll wait and unlock the last enchant before I make my decision, and it happens, and you'll get pissed if you're unlucky.  It unlocked Wands +1.  Stupid Wands..  WTF am I going to do with a dumb enchant like that when wands are so extremely rare and not even worth using.  Now, if you're even luckier you'll find gear with Slots.  Good luck with that though because they're even more rare.  Yeah, I have a socket item that gives you an extra turn every 11 turns that goes into boots.  Yet, I can NOT find a pair of boots with sockets that are worth a damn, they are SO rare to even have a socket anyway.  You're better off just hoping that it'll rank up and unlock this perk.  Oh btw, there's NO RESIST MAGIC GEAR AT ALL.  Just take it like a champ, and beef up that ice shield.

3.  The story.  It's boring.  It's not confusing.  Evil wizard takes over, you fight other wizards to finally get to end boss, everything else is meaningless and who cares....  When you beat on of the 6 school of magic wizards and go back to town, everyone in town has something stupid and meaningless to say.  Yeah, yeah, just let me sell my loot...

4.  The enemies.  There's only like what 10 different enemies or something.  The ones that ram you are the worst.  They knock you back a square, so you better have a bow, and you will, because it's only one of three weapons you're ever goign to use.  The wizards you fight, which are cheating bosses, all look the same with a little twist here, (i.e. oh, they're just different color.)  They use the same magic as you can, except they get two hits every turn, while you get one.  Maybe three even, cheating bastards.  Copy and Paste, boring...  I think I came across a total of 2 elite enemies the ENTIRE time I've played this game.

5.  Attributes.  There's 3.  Strength, Stamina, Finesse.  I can't spell.  When you level up you get 4 points to put where you like.  Just put a point in each and one more in stanima the whole way through the game because you're not going to sspecialize in anything except....

6.  The magic.  There's 6 schools of magic, and you start off with fire.  I haven't even unlocked two types because I'm never going to use them.  The best is Ice because it offers a shield, chance to freeze, and to do OP damage to baddies if you freeze them.  Second is Life because of the teleport heal which will get you outta situations and the Swarm is nice.  Fire is third, and Sky is 4th.  Screw the others, don't waste you're points into it.  When you level you only get 3 points to put where you like.  NOW, where do you think they're going to go?  That's right, your Ice Shield EVERYTIME, Your teleport Heal, EVERYTIME, which gives you one more?  that's right FREEZE, EVERYTIME.  Also, you're magic uses ammo vs mana, and ammo is so available in late game, but it's a dumb idea because it takes up bag space.

7.  Maps are redundant.  They look the same after while.  The stuff on the ground throughout the map has no interaction.  You may come across a trap here and there, but ooooo, it's not going to really effect you.  The map will also get in the way.  You're unable to rotate the camera, so if there's an enemy by where you can select your weapon/magic, you'll do that instead of shooting them with your bow.  If they're up at the top right, the mini map will get in your way.

8.  The game.  Yes, the game itself is BORING.  IT sucks.  I'm sorry guys, it does.  I'm bored as hell with this game.  IT's like they didn't even do their homework on other games in the genre.  They put a twist on it like depth perception and making it turn based which is w/e it works but there's still WAY better games out there.  This game was like $15 bucks.  Yeah I paid $5 for Torchlight 2 and it's 100X better than this game.  There's even mods for that game.  This game here doesn't have ANY replayablity.  You're not going to do ANYTHING different the second playthrough that you didn't do the first time.  Shit, why did I buy this game.  That's it, I basically told you everything that's in this game.  You go into a dungeon, click, click, click, click, click, take a potion, click click click.. damn where's that last enemy or chest, go down some stairs, click, click, click, click, boots leveled up, oh nice..  FUCK +1 to Wands......  click CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, come on come on.... Click Click... same eneimes, hate the ones that ram me... oh okay boss, finally something fun... CLICK, switch to it's weak magic if I took it, click, click, click, potion cause pet is about to die, click click, and BOOM dead, click leave dungeon, go back to town, shut up shut up, want to see weapons.. ALL SHIT.. .sell sell sell sell sell sell, upgrade shop, SHIT weapons again... sell sell sell sell, rinse and repeat... Game sucks!  If you're going copy games like Diablo or TL2, or even Darkstone, do you're homework and make it better than those.. Oh wait, you can't, because they already thought of everything.  So yeah, by those games instead of this one.

The Good.
1.  The Devs.  Yeah I slammed your game and I'm not sorry.  I like you guys though.  Thank you for listening to my suggestions.  If you want to listen to one more, then stop this game and go make something else.

2.  Artwork.  Love the artwork!  That's the BEST thing about this game, the BEST.  Hands down, you did a wonderful job Sir!

3.  I was going to recommend that at least an eight year old play this, but that's only if they like turn based, if not, go play Disgea 1 or 2.  If you don't like turn based, go play Torchlight 2 as it's not as dark themed as say Diablo.  Plus you don't have to log into Blizzards horrible servers to play your game 8).

4.  The depth perception is new and interesting concept of this game.  Works well for this style but everything else just kills the game.  Nice touch though.",1475899680,1475899680,False,13,0,0.550131618976593018,7,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Rogue Wizards[/b] - хороший рогалик, над разработкой которого корпели несколько лет. Хотя, по сути, большую часть работы выполнил один человек, а уже в завершающей стадии разработки автору помогли художники-энтузиасты. Наиграв в данное творение около 20 часов, могу с полной уверенность сказать - игра получилась добротной, хотя некоторые моменты и насторожили.

Сюжет здесь до ужаса банальный, а его подача вызывает удивление. Мир катится в бездну, так как 6 элементов поддерживающих равновесие были захвачены одним злостным дядькой. Наш герой - единственный кто может восстановить порядок и вернуть мир в эти земли. Все остальные подробности мы будем узнавать из свитков, найденных в подземельях, и диалогов персонажей. 

События [b]Rogue Wizards[/b] разворачиваются на двух локациях - подземельях и тайном убежище Магов, откуда мы планируем все наши походы. Зачищая подземелья, мы не только занимаемся поиском лута и узнаем подробности сюжета, но также находим новых соратников и питомцев, которые впоследствии нам помогут в нашем путешествии. Некоторые из найденных персонажей откроют в городе собственные мастерские, где можно будет закупиться перед предстоящими походами. Здания можно улучшать, чтобы получить доступ к более качественной экипировке и аксессуарам.

Весь лут в игре разбит на четыре класса: обычный, редкий, легендарный и святой. Естественно, что святой и легендарный добыть очень сложно, но иногда его можно прикупить даже в магазинчиках. Хочется сказать, что в [b]Rogue Wizards[/b] даже обычное оружие имеет несколько показателей помимо силы атаки или степени защиты, чем круче класс предмета, тем больше дополнительных параметров у него есть. Причем каждый предмет можно прокачать, для этого достаточно экипировать его, и со временем он получит новые свойства, порой очень неожиданные. 

Порадовали авторы разнообразием и оригинальностью монстров, коих хоть в игре и не очень много, не более 20, но каждый из них имеет свой уникальный стиль и внешний вид. Некоторые противники могут украсть у вас оружие или доспех и убежать в неизвестном направлении, другие же заплевать монитор, тем самым дезориентировав. Иногда появляются существа с другого измерения с полным кошелем золота и редкого лута. А еще реже встречается элитный тип монстров, которые мне попадался всего лишь три раза за игру. Такие твари даже сильнее боссов подземелий, но и награда за них соответствующая. Единственное что расстроило в данном аспекте игры, так это сюжетные боссы. Если не считать последнего из них, все они внешне выглядят одинаково, да и сражения разворачиваются на одинаковых локациях. Мне кажется разработчик мог бы и доработать этот нюанс, хотя бы создав уникальные арты каждому из боссов.

Подземелья, где будет проходить большая часть игры, генерируются случайным образом и разделены на несколько типов. В одних можно наткнуться на ловушки, в других можно встретить уникальных монстров, которые заставят героя галлюцинировать. Не забываем про купцов, специальные алтари, и возможность создавать лечебное зелье или элементы, необходимые для каста магии. Среднее время прохождения одного подземелья варьируется от 20 до 40 минут, в зависимости от сложности оного, причем за убийство всех монстров, открытие всех сундуков и обезвреживание ловушек дают приличное количество опыта.

I can't recommend it at its current state though, as it's pretty much a dumb cute game for mobile, when you'd use 5 brain cells while on the train, while 3 other are looking for the train stop and the rest are asleep, waiting for coffee.

Elaborating: 

Pros:
- Nice graphics
- Great music
- Good dungeon sizes
- Responsive post-release developers, fixing stuff

Cons:
- My character can wield all weapons and all magic. Why? An RPG is about choice and limitations. ""I will select to do that, but I will never be able to do that"". Since when did that go out of fashion? Since the release of Diablo 3? Pff anyway.
- Very little of anything! Item types, enemy types, spells, attributes. 
- No help whatsoever for mechanics and details! Not for clicking about left and right, but for other stuff: e.g. why are there two inventory tabs with different icons? What does each pet do? What are the stats of pets? What were the beta testers feeding back, seriously?? ""I want the owl pet to have 5 purple feathers and smirk when it crits""??  
- No automatic inventory management, sorting, etc. 
- AI is dumb. Allies, pets and enemies. 
- The dungeon types are too few and irrelevant. Why there are descriptions for the dungeons, beats me. They are pretty much like ""X has taken over this dungeon. He is evil. For the good of the village, he must be eliminated"". Yes, this is the level of procedural descriptions for the dungeons. I am perplexed. 
- The isometric movement is terrible. Keys do not map well, and I can't count the times I've clicked on a monster instead of the tile behind it. 
- The quickslot system is limiting. Why do I have only 8? Why do I have to go through GUI hell if I want to use anything else? (open shortcut, drag and drop item/spell icon to quickslot). Games from 20 years ago use shift/ctrl to have alternate quickslots. Ah I forgot, it's possibly because of the ""design-for-mobile"".
- Storyline is meh. I don't even want to imagine where the name of the bad **elam** people who oppress the poor and women comes from, as I always read stuff in **reverse** too. I can't believe any serious game developer would go in such SJW propaganda.
- Two portraits (one per gender) -  that's your choice for the character. It's not like they have cutscenes or they are animated a lot. They just look serious, tired, happy and the occasional blue steel.
- Town building is a joke. ""Streamlined"" they say, but here's what happens. Remember diablo 2? The vendors would sell you stuff based on your level. Now, if you want the vendors to sell you stuff based on your level, instead of level 5 items when you're level 40, then you have to provide them with money and special items. This is an **illusion** of upgrading, as you always find the money and the items, and never too fast. So the vendors upgrade at the rate that the devs want. YOU ARE IRRELEVANT, ONCE AGAIN.

This SCREAMS as a game designed for phones/tablets. Funnily enough, it's not released as such. 
It looks like I'm raging, because I was expecting so much more. I was expecting something for PC gamers, not ""play-at-the-bus-stop"".",1475740401,1475742681,False,9,0,0.587433874607086182,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: A fun, solid rogue-like, best played in normal or higher difficulty. (Not so much a tactical RPG though.) Great game for the money.

Rogue Wizards is an easily accessible rogue-like dungeon crawler that's sure to delight fans of the genre, as well as entice more players into it. The colorful animation styled graphics look nice, and the gameplay is solid.
I found myself enjoying it quite a bit despite the difficulty (when not on easy mode), and rogue-likes aren't usually something I care much for.

The storyline and ""town building"" aspects of the game I honestly can't say much about. The story is some kind of moral/equality thing, but really it just gives you more reasons to go down into dungeons. I died before I could get to do the town building part, and given I wasn't play in normal mode, I had permadeath. (Easy mode lets you revive for all those pansies out there)

About the only real complaints I have is that the difficulty seemed to curve up rather quickly for me. Faster than I could compensate for with gear and leveling, but your results may vary.
Also when there's several enemies on the screen at once, particularly ones with skills, battles can start feeling very long-winded. (Normally they're pretty quick though.)

Overall for just $15 this is a pretty easy one to recommend. It's probably one of the best indie games out this year.

My personal recommendation: Play on normal or harder. Easy mode is just that.",1475687601,1475687783,True,1,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Ne varrà veramente la pena?

MAGHI, INCANTESIMI E MOSTRI
In Rogue Wizard verremo catapultati in un mondo fantasy dove la potente gilda dei maghi sta perdendo a poco a poco il proprio potere e saremo proprio noi ad impersonare un potente mago o maga per riuscire a ristabilire l’equilibrio, sconfiggendo le forze del male che sono state inviate sul nostro mondo da un malvagio stregone. Una volta finito il tutorial che ci mostrerà le basi del gioco, ci sarà subito chiaro come il titolo sia diviso in due parti. Ovvero l’esplorazione dei dungeon e la costruzione del nostro villaggio.
Ci risulta subito chiaro però come queste due parti siano completamente sbilanciate tra di loro e come una di essa sopravvenga sull’altra in maniera del tutto prepotente. Esatto, poiché aldilà di esplorare solo i dungeon, non vi è nessun’altro modo per riuscire a raccogliere risorse per il nostro villaggio e di come quest’ultimo sia stato lasciato solo al caso, dato che l’espansione del nostro villaggio servirà solo ad avere negozi in più dove poter acquistare maggiori potenziamenti, senza aggiungere nulla di più al titolo. Per quanto riguarda i dungeon invece si vede come il team si sia incentrato su di essi facendoli risultare divertente ogni volta che si parte all’esplorazione. Essi vengono generati casualmente. La cosa non finisce soltanto alla generazione casuale, ma al fatto che quando saremo all’interno di un dungeon la mappa verrà creata a seconda del movimento che faremo. Purtroppo questa è una delle limitazioni del titolo, poiché riusciremo sempre e soltanto a vedere una manciata di spazi davanti al nostro personaggio, mentre tutto quello che ci ritroveremo alle spalle sparirà. L’unica momento in cui riusciremo a vedere l’intera zona sarà durante i combattimenti con i nemici. Durante l’esplorazione potremmo trovare oltre ad oggetti ed equipaggiamenti anche dei seguaci che potranno seguirci ed aiutarci in battaglia.

TORNA IL CLASSICO TURN-BASED
Il combattimento in Rogue Wizard è basato a turni, ma anche qui vi è una limitazione. Quando si incontrano dei nemici in una zona il combattimento inizierà sia con un nostro attacco che con quello dei nostri oppositori, in quel caso, se con noi avessimo dei seguaci, essi verranno guidati della CPU ed avremmo soltanto il controllo del nostro personaggio principale. Questa risulta un’arma a doppio taglio. 
Da una parte non dovremmo preoccuparci dei nostri alleati in quanto attaccheranno e si cureranno da soli, dall’altra però ci sono delle particolari abilità che potranno imparare soltanto loro e che quindi ci risulterà impossibile decidere quando utilizzarle.Una cosa molto importante riguarda i famigli che troveremo durante la nostra avventura, essi ci daranno una grande mano durante i combattimenti ma, una volta finito il dungeon, avranno bisogno di un tempo di risposo prima di ripartire con noi per la prossima avventura. Questo tempo può variare da un tempo breve a decisamente lungo sé il famiglio è morto durante la nostra esplorazione.

FORZIERI, CHIAVI E MOLTO ALTRO
Abbiamo parlato dei dungeon di come essi vengono generati e di come l’esplorazione sia una cosa fondamentale per potenziare il nostro villaggio. Non abbiamo parlato ancora però del sistema di crescita del personaggio e dei loot che troveremo all’interno dei dungeon. Durante l’esplorazione dei dungeon avremo modo di guadagnare punti esperienza in vari modi, questi ci permetteranno di crescere di livello e di potenziare il nostro personaggio in una delle tre caratteristiche desiderate. Dopo poche ore di gioco appare evidente come il sistema di crescita del personaggio sia stato ridotto completamente all’osso, e per compensare questa semplicità gli Spellbind Studios hanno introdotto un sistema di crescita anche per le magie che porterà oltre a potenziare quelle base anche a scoprirne di nuove.
Parliamo adesso dei loot che il gioco offre, essi possono essere raccolti in modo completamente differente, si possono rompere oggetti come barili, uccidere nemici oppure aprire i forzieri. Per quest’ultimi sarà però necessario trovare le chiavi all’interno del dungeon o sconfiggere dei mostri. Il numero di chiavi presenti in ogni dungeon è uguale al numero dei forzieri che ci sono, quindi se non riuscite ad aprirli tutti, vi converrà esplorare li dungeon a fondo. I loot che i forzieri ed i nemici possono lasciare prevedono anche equipaggiamento con un colore a seconda della rarità, questo cambieranno drasticamente anche il vostro modo di giocare a seconda dell’effetto che essi vi daranno portandovi costantemente a cambiare anche arma.

COMPARTO TECNICO
Rogue Wizard è un titolo colorato e vivace dai toni stile cartoon, graficamente il titolo non risulta in alcun modo sbavato ed i colori si intonano perfettamente a quello che vuole rappresentare il titolo. Il gameplay risulta divertente anche per questa scelta di stile nonostante qualche pecca a livello artistico.

rogue-wizards-town

Le animazioni delle magie e i vari nemici che incontrerete durante l’esplorazione dei vari dungeon sono vari e divertenti ed i dungeon intriganti. Il comparto audio risulta essere molto piacevole quando ci troveremo nella città  passando a toni più cupi ed inquietanti quando entreremo in azione.

IN CONCLUSIONE
Rogue Wizard è un divertente miscuglio di dungeon casuali ed un gameplay solido grazie ad un sistema di loot basato sul livello. Mettendo da parte i problemi derivanti dalla difficoltà altalenante e l’attesa dei famigli risulta tramutarsi alcune volte in ore reali il gioco risulta sicuramente una valida alternativa ai classici del genere. Manca il supporto ad un controller e, con il trascorrere delle ore, si denota una certa ripetizione nell’approccio al combattimento ma in generale possiamo ritenerci soddisfatti.

The developers are responsive and clearly listen to the community, and it pays dividends.  I was never a huge fan of the way blocks became 'visible', but in the latest update theyv'e changed even that core visual.

It's one of those games that has a ""one more dungeon"" type deal, but when you play it and you get a dungeon of gryphons or those rock dudes, or mud cum slingers that block your screen, you sigh and question why you're doing this but when you get a dungeon with regular enemies that don't slow down the gameplay, it's actually really fun!

首先，这真不是个传统的 Rogue Like 。以我 2 小时的游戏体验，它更接近刷刷刷的轻度游戏。传统 RL 的各个要素都有，但感觉每个要素上可以挖的游戏性还不够，至少初期感受不到。

不太需要管理背包，没有仔细管理有限背包的取舍乐趣。随便打装备，看到数字好的就换，垃圾去商店换钱。升级并不难，感觉就是靠刷。

传统 RL 的食物机制被取消了。

探索发现的乐趣比较少，没有鉴定、不需要担心使用未知物品的奇怪副作用。

初期挑战远远不够，就是砍砍砍，没太多考虑该如何对付敌人的策略乐趣。boss 战感觉可以做一些花样出来，等我再玩几个小时补充。

虽然有个 Hard 模式可以永久死亡，但是好坑爹。一个靠刷刷刷积累成长的游戏，平时挑战不够，而万一不小心真的死了又好郁闷。从头再来一次好折磨，可重玩性不够啊。是的，我就是玩了 2 个小时，被第 2 个 boss 杀了才来这里写评测吐槽的。新开档再也不选 Hard 了。

最大的优点是画面真的不错（让我最终给了推荐的唯一理由），一直希望有个画面好点的 RL 可以安利给画面党，而这个应该是满分了。但同时也说明，RL 游戏画面真心不重要。为了播放动画，游戏操作流畅性反而不如那些 ASCII 界面了。斜视角的场景也远不如正视角的格子上下左右分明。我想作者也意识到这点了，用了很多手法弥补。比如用地块下层的视觉效果来代替视野迷雾的想法就非常好。

ps. 宠物要消耗真实时间休息是什么鬼？难道是为了以后上手机卖体力氪金预留的坑？

结论：如果你是 RL 粉，不要对这个游戏抱太多希望，真想收的话，打折再买。

最后再次推荐我玩了 400+ 小时的真 RL 游戏：

I have 300+ games installed, and this is only my second review on steam; Hands of Fate was my first. Hands of Fate because I thought the design was really unique; Rogue Wizards, because one mechanic was stopping me from enjoying a really good indie game.

It's a great time filler. Not as complex as some other rogue-likes, which is not a bad thing.  Dungeons of Dredmor is probably my favorite in the genre, and the fact that I'm comparing them favorably says a lot. That said, here is the one thing that is almost stopping me from continuing to play it further:

The damn tiles popping in and out. It's annoying as hell, makes me dizzy after a while, and serves absolutely no purpose.

I'm not sure if the point of it is to minimize memory use by not keeping everything on the screen; other than that, I can't imagine why that would be part of the design. Granted, it's cool when you first see it. I thought it was cool in Bastion. But Jeez, lock the tiles once they have been discovered. Put in a ""fog of war"" if you want, but don't keep things popping up and down through the entire game. It's almost a game-breaker for me.

One other small complaint. When I'm hallucinating, and I've killed all the bad guys, don't make me hit the space bar 45 times until the effect wear off; it serves no purpose.

Fight and Movement animations slow the pace of the game down horribly as it threatens to ruins the game.  At one point, I began to blink my eyes sleepily as I battled through one of the levels.  

The town development system and crafting seems very shallow even after over 10 hours played.  There really isn't much to do in between dungeon crawls besides selling off your weapons and armor and hoping to gain new ones. 

Thankfully the visuals comes to Rogue Wizards' rescue as the dungeon environment comes in and drops away from Line Of Sight.  

Loot system is quite nice as not only do they have loads of it, but also ""ranks up"" and gains new abilities the longer you have them equipped.

Town additions to help with armor and weapon upgrades-can be leveled with special item and gold
Town Enchanter, Misc. store, Inn for Pets, Loot storage box, element and Health pot crafting (also randomly in dungeons)
Pets to take along with you in dungeons
Gem placement into socketed Equipment for extra stats
Different level dungeons with loot to match - (recent Change)
Turn based combat that actually contributes to creating strategy and not just taking turns
Random NPC characters to meet and join you in Dungeons
Dungeon Merchants for selling all your useless loot while in dungeon
Random spawning Treasure Imps that drop great loot (reminds me of D3 treasure goblins)
Dungeon Teleports for moving around once discovered while in dungeon
Developer is responsive and active in Forums

Cons:
Not many really mostly little stuff
Character creation is limited (appearance)
Dungeons get a little repetitive with same enemies
No way to upgrade Backpack or Inventory Bag
No way to replace or remove Gems once socketed

I am sure there are some features of this game I missed in the Pros but just from the things I listed you can see that this game is a must have, one of the best Indie RPG's Dungeon Crawls I have played in a long time.

I believe there is only 1 town to create but I would LOVE to see a DLC in the Future with new towns and Dungeons.

I finally had to tear myself away from this game to give this game a review.
[b]I LOVE IT.[/b]  
It is a colourful, animated rogue playing game which oozes with charm, amusing characteristics and a joy to play. 

Graphics
Lets get the main part over.  Its flat 2D (not 3D or even full 3D) and may look old hat to some of todays modern players who are use to fancy graphics etc.
But, WHO CARES!
The graphics are big, bold, sharp, colourful, cartoon like and detailed with some lovely animations and on a resolution of 1360 x 768 that graphics are sharp and very clear.  The isometric view reminds of an old ZX spectrum game called Knightlore which was very popular at its time.  I love the design of the characters that I have met so far as well as the detailed dungeon walls, floors etc.  The animation is extremely good with humans eyes blinking, or the way the hero switches between weapons to the different creatures movement to the way they die.  When I first saw the size of the graphics it was BIG on my screen which was good because it makes the game much more claustrophobic as you only see a small section of the dungeon and you don't know what is in front of you.  As your hero moves sections of the dungeon falls away behind you as a new section rises up to meet you.  When playing the game you forget it is 2d because you are so engrossed with look and style of the game play especially when the manic battles occur.  Also because of the 2d aspect it mean it less strain of the computer system requirements and allows you to have battles with lots of monsters and animations flying back and forth with a fast, manic and smooth look.  The death animation of the creatures ranges from cute to funny to surprising.  Also the special ability that each creature has so far (Only seen a few) again ranges from very funny to amusing or even frustrating when your in battle, but that is part of the charm.  The town is nicely set out with a some nice animations.  But it is the dungeon where the action takes place and thrill seeing a new creature with special abilities.
Score (9/10)

Sound/Music
The sounds effects are nice with some nice touches.  I like the sound of the shadowlord dying, or when splodges hit your monitor before sliding down with a squeakily sound effect.  The music is nice and I have a favourite track which takes place in the dungeon.  This track has a pulsating heartbeat sound accompanied by an eerie music track which give the game more atmosphere especially when going into deeper and more challenging dungeons.  The other tracks for the dungeon and town are nice and enhance the game further.  Its the music for main menu that is maybe the weakest as you are more interesting in getting into the game that you bypass it quickly.  Score (7/10)

Gameplay
The game is turn based however due to the fast response, the smoothness and quickness of the movement/battles etc it is very easy to be fooled into thinking that it is real-time.  The number times I have moved my hero too quickly only to end up smack bang into a horde of monsters is my fault. This of course ended my turn only for the enemy to start hurls weapons, spells etc at me doing more damage before I could damage them.  One particular battle was the battle with gryphons in which they made a large section of the tiled floor all ice and because of my quickness my hero and NPC were sliding about in opposite directions.  This was both laughable at the start and then frustrating later due to being so eager to fight them that I forgot it was turn based.  So going turn based may make the game feel slower but it cranks up the tension and atmosphere in the dungeons.  Battles required tactical thought when dealing with different monsters at the same time.  Boss battles require even more thought because before you know you it, your surrounded by their minions etc.

There are lots of weapons in the dungeons and comparing them to your own weapons reveals each of them have their own good and bad traits.  You have to decide which one might be good for you.  With so much choice, I spent about 5 minutes deciding whether to replace the sword I have with a new spear which has some bigger bonus hits but with less abilities.  Gold is in abundance but that is quickly spent on upgrading the armoury and blacksmith in your town to get better stronger weapons and armour.

Magic is a crucial factor and with 6 schools of magic totalling 18 spells each with levels to go up in make the game more interesting which gives way to deciding which spell you feel it better for you.  You have 8 slots to hold weapons, magic and other items to use in battle etc but which ones to go into which slots.
Gameplay (10/10)

From what I have seen there are 2 aspects to this game: Story and Gauntlet.

The Gauntlet:  
I first went into this by mistake right as the start with no clue as to how the game work and died very quickly.  I tried again thinking I made a mistake somewhere only to die again.  It was then I discovered the story aspect and realised that the gauntlet is a straight into dungeon rogue game to last as long as possible.  Will try that once I complete the story aspect

The Story:  
This the main part of the game which introduces you to the game mechanics as well as the object of the game.  Build up your hero male/female with weapons bought or found, fight monsters, gain gold and acquire other items scattered about the dungeon to help you .  There is a town which you have to build to acquire more weapons and allow you access to your magic spells etc.  In your quests in the dungeons you will encounter NPC characters/creatures who will give aid in battle with their own style of weapons.  As to what the story is about well I will leave that up to you to find as I am finding out now.

Criticisms:
I only have one.  When you hover you arrow mouse over the buildings it would be nice to see the name of the building.  I sometimes select the blacksmith when I want the armoury or select the vault thinking it is the armoury.  but that is the only quibble.

Bottom Line
This is a game is fantastic with its old style look that should appeals to gamers old and young.  It has sharp, colourful animated graphics, with good game play, nice sounds/music etc and once you learn the game mechanics it is very easy to control.  A big thank you Spellbind Studios for creating a beautiful looking rogue style game.  Score (9/10)",1475180061,1475180396,True,43,0,0.753700077533721924,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Сюжет как таковой тут... есть... или нет... Судите сами: некто очухивается в таверне после пинты молока, тут же телепортируется в обучающее подземелье, после чего в деревушку, парящую в облаках. Затем, уже сознательно прыгая в портал, расхаживает по подземельям, набираясь опыта  для встречи с главным злодеем. Перед которым он должен победить магов шести стихий. 
Оскар за сценарий? Ну можно и Оскар. Из бельгийскоф вафли сделанный.
Бесконечное подземелье с доской лидеров тут тоже есть. Ему привет и основоное число игро-часов.

Классическая схема рандомно генерящихся подземелий, акцент в которых сделан ни сколько на их исследовании, сколько на походовый экшен. Искать ловушки, крафтить стафф, разговаривать с гномами, копать руду здесь не надо. И слава Богу. Основное что мы будем делать тут мутузить монстров, вытаскивать стрелы из колен, и пить поушены. И да, самое божественное что мы любим в играх, одеваться в шмот. *звучит ангельская музыка* Оружие и шмот, имея тиеры, тут ростёт в уровнях вместе с ГГ, рандомно получая полезные абилки. И это чертовски увлекательно. Приходится иметь шесть луков (пример) с магическим уроном каждой из школ. Т.к. монстры и резисты тут слова синонимы. И прокачивать каждый из них, лол. Но потом уровень оружия достигает капа. Выпадает пулялка следующего тиера и погнали снова в кач.
В остальном тут все как в диаблоидах: есть деревенька, там селяне с полезными навыками, магазинчики, склад под барахло, загончик для петов. И портал. Куда уж без него. Не будь портала, не было бы игры.)

Даже мутным взглядом алкаша тут заметно, что авторы игры занимались мониторингом рынка и собиранием информации, что же на данный момент хотят игроки. В игре нет ничего лишнего и нудного. Только то, что будет иметь спрос на рынке. Например, вышеупомянутая прокачка оружия одноврменно шести видов магического урона. Нет, тут не надо проходить двадцать раз одно и то же подземелье, что прокачать единицу оружия. Оно прокачивается само собой в течении прохождения игры. Просто меняем время от времени конкретный экземпляр на другой. А под нужного босс с резистами, одеванием ту пушечку с противоположным ему уроном.

Магических школ тут 6, по 3 заклинания в каждой. Но заморачиваться с длинной панелью, на которой выведены все заклинания не надо. В каждом тематическом подземелье водятся монстры к этой тематике относящиеся. Поэтому к ""огненному"" подземелью на панель выводим морозные заклинания и воздушные. Камень и огонь убираем. Всё просто.
Дабы не носится по коридорам туда сюда, введена ""внутрення портальная система"" (ВПС). Очень серьёзное название получилось. К ней прилагается интсрукция на 400 страницах отдельным пдф-файлом в папке с игрой. Шучу. Просто тыкайте на глобальной карте, куда хотите переместится и моментально окажитесь там.

Монстры хоть и интересны, но туповаты. Особых проблем с ними не возникнет. Хотя они и умеют станить, потом вешать дот, потом бить, продлевать стан, вешать сайленс и т.д.
Присутствуют занятные фишки. Например, песочный голем кидается песком натурально в монитор. Замазывая для вас как игрока часть экрана. Т.е. тыкать целенаправленно в монстра, скрытого за этой кляксой, не выйдет. Легко может быть ситуация, что весь экран скрыт от вас кляксами. Свежо.

Приятная мультяшная графика для рогалика, 21 век все таки. Монстры из 3 пикселей это для отдельных ценителей, в иные проекты. Здесь все максимально информативно и приятно расслаблюще.

It isn't ADOM or Nethack. It is however pretty good at being a rogue lite game.

The story mode is ""meh"" I played for about 2 hours and stopped bored.
The real meat and drink is the proper rogue like mode with perma death and no town building.

Even that though is not particularly punishing (at first) the mechanics are good in combat. Bows for ranged, chakras for multiple ranged but lower impact, axes for immediate AOE, spears for move and attack in the same turn, sword for the strongest single attack on a single opponent in one turn. Staffs are similar to swords really, so there is that.

Every weapon has a role to play, and they level up as you play, getting stronger the more you use them - up to a point (they have a highest potential level themselves).

Interesting decisions. Do you carry on using your level 7 maxxed out bow - or start levelling the weaker but potentially more awesome in the long run level 8 -11 bow? You'll do less damage with it for a while but it might pay off... or using it might get you killed. 

Learning the mobs. Some attack and move, some have effects like Silence, Ice, firball and a rock/cage Hmmm
Magic? Getting one spell really high level sounds great, but mobs have resistances and you need the right reagents for the spell and most spell trees use different reagents. With all your level points in one magic field you risk running out of reagents for that field and having tons left for spells you haven't learned.

There is no right and wrong yet that I can see, the game gets progressively harder. You will die at some point, but not in the first 10 minutes unless you are a really bad player and don't pay attention.

The graphics are pretty good. They remind me of Torchlight (as does the music) Not really that bothered with the GFX though, the solid gameplay is what I bought a ticket for.

A few gripes. Hitting a square diagonally behind where a mob or map feature is can sometimes be a bit hit and miss, other than that, it's not hard core, but it is very solid and rewarding.
There are plenty of hardcore options ADOM, ToME Angband and decent graphical ones like Dungeons of Dredmoor. Most available here on Steam or free.

For those who appreciate Roguelike fundamentals: procedural replay, permadeath, gear/stat progression, etc, this fits the bill, and does so with more esthetic polish than your typical entry

As with most RL's, there is an element of grind, which is no different in Rogue Wizard, I appreciate the improvments made to game pacing, making the grind far more tolerable.

A notable element that makes this more of a Rouge Lite rather than a Like, is the Diabloesque random-gear drops. ie ""Dull Sword of the Noob"", etc.  A departure from the Diablo scheme is that all drops (so far) are identified, without the risk of cursed or unknown effects that are typical of more traditional rouge-likes.  Also keeping it in the RougeLite realm is the absence of food/hunger.  While this might be welcome for some, its something that in traditional RL's, establishes a sense of desperation, further enhancing the tension of permadeath.

The presentation is AAA, assets are high-fidelity, almost vector-like, losing no definition at even the highest zoom level, however not a big fan of the variable floor tile depth.  Realizing this is stylistic, and without it, the game might look like any other iso-rpg, it just feels like the variability of tile depth is extreme, an exaggerated homage to FF-Tactics-style isometric presentation. Similarly, I wish there were actual walls, the environment feels too open, like platforms floating in  space, allowing you to make ranged attacks on mobs in other ""rooms"", which could be deemed an advantage, but just doesn't feel right.

While your avatar changes based on active weapon/spell, as others have mentioned, it would be nice if player appearance was even more dynamic, with head, torso, feet, etc, changing as different gear is equipped.

I hold PixelDungeon as the benchmark for today's roguelites, mainly due to it being a modern but faithful iteration of its inspiration: bRogue, which itself, helped define much of what we expect in RL's today.  Rouge Wizard, is comparable in many respects, superior in many respects, and with ongoing enhancments being made by the dec, its earning its place among these benchmark games.

Sincerely hope that Spellbind continues to refine and enhance this gem to its full potential.",1475073573,1475350789,True,3,0,0.516873598098754883,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A bit of background to put this review in context:

I’d been following this game for quite some time and was eager to play it.  I’m not an avid Rogue-like player but enjoy the likes of FTL, TOME and have also dabbled in the free version of ADOM recently.  Basically I enjoy some of them but am not a massive fan of permadeath in games (except in the context of XCOM or Battle Brothers).

Anyway I’ll keep this simple and just make this a series of Pros, Cons, Misc and a conclusion.

Pros:
• I really like the art style, this is purely subjective but I think the character/monster design is awesome and the simple yet colour aesthetic suits the game perfectly.
• The loot mechanic is very good – constantly picking up new weapons/gear and they often have interesting enchantments that make choosing items about more than just damage/defence value.
• On a similar note the way gear levels up as you use it (gaining an extra enchantment when it does so) is a very nice touch.  It encourages you to specialize as well as adding another level to the decision as to whether or not to constantly swap out gear.

Cons:
• Only one really but it’s a huge one…The combat is incredibly easy.  To a point where it gets boring very quickly.  Even fighting four or five enemies at once is no threat, they do so little damage and generally die from one or two hits.  If you’ve got a companion/pet along it’s even easier.
For a game that is primarily focussed on dungeon grinding this single flaw is enough to kill the game.

Misc (not really a positive or negative...just observations):
• Music is something of a non-entity.  Could happily switch it off and not really notice it’s absence (again this is purely subjective).
• The loot is perhaps a little too plentiful – I had picked up divine and legendary items by the time my character was level 2.
• The spells seem a bit overpowered…I know they take “ammo” but I’ve seen nothing (so afar) that can take more than a single hit.  Even monsters that are resistant to cold were getting one shotted by the basic ice spell.
• Again a personal gripe but having to hunt for keys to open chests is an annoyance.  You can buy them from the shop in town but why would you bother - they are seemingly always in a 1:1 ratio on each level of the dungeon.  So it boils down to an annoying exercise in grinding and back-tracking (which is eased but the teleport system)
• Pets have a real-time cooldown period (20 minutes).  Doesn't personally really bother me but I know it fills a lot of people with rage - so best be aware of it.

TLDR/Conclusion:

I really wanted to like this game and based on the Pro section of this review it should be everything I was looking for.  However the ridiculously easy combat kills it for me.  So personally until its re-balanced I can only give this the thumbs down.

One caveat to this – if you’re into very casual gaming you may well still find a lot to like in Rogue Wizards.

At first it will come across as simplified but it's actually very deep. Monsters have elemental weaknesses and immunities (Pokemon style). There are some tile modifiers not often seen in rogue-likes such as ice that can cause involuntary movement (slipping).

There are many quality of life improvements over traditional rogue-likes such as companions, teleportation and being able to see your equipped weapons.

The story mode is your tipical linear progression, go-to-that-dungeon-for-that-quest type, with a central hub of merchants to sell your loot and restock on potions. I personally don't really care for the story, but if you dig evil wizards doing evil shit with evil magic, this is the title for you.

Then it has the actual roguelike game mode, called Gauntlet. You start on a dungeon at level 1, with only a sword and potions, and you keep going through the floors until you die, collecting loot and leveling up as you go. Every X amount of floors there's a boss who is higher level than you character and can screw you if you are bad like me, but drops some good loot when killed.

The actual mechanincs and balance of the diferent types of weapons and spells seems good from what I've played so far. The combat is a fast paced style of turn-based, where you either attack, move, use a potion, or switch weapon/spell. But for example, a Lance allows you to move and attack on the same turn, and in some situations (with the right mob placement) kill multiple enemys in one turn; however, it's a two-handed weapon, meaning you can't use a shield with it, like you can with sword or an axe, meaning you can't block attacks. Also, if you play Hearthstone, think of your potions as Reno Jackson - they always heal you to full. You also have the system of when you level up puting points into your stats and into your spells, and a pretty cool system for your gear where every piece will have a rank, wich goes up by using that piece - for example a weapon rank goes up by killing things with it, and every time you go up a rank it rolls a new affix on that weapon, wich can be the damage or another random property (think Diablo 3 loot). So your common drop can actually be better then a rare drop if you have used it more.
You get bonus XP if you kill every enemy and open every chest on a floor (it tells you when you do), and you can use the map to teleport to various waypoints spread across the floors (the entrance and exit, when you find it, act as waypoints to). You need keys to open the chests, the keys drop from enemys, so if you find a chest and don't have a key, you can always go to it later easily. And from my experience, you always get enough keys for all the chests.

All in all, it's a fun time killer, with some good ideas from games you problably played before, and an interesting art style. My only gripe so far is that the tiles out your character's vision just disapear and pop in when you move constantly, and since you move relatively fast out of combat it can be a bit anoying, but I eventually got used to navigating that way.

Klasse roguelike/roguelite Dungeon-Crawler mit enormem Loot-Sucht-Faktor und toller Grafik. Soundtrack ist Top und es macht immer wieder Spaß, in den nächsten Dungeon aufzubrechen. Die Dungeons sind immer neu generiert (random) und vom Layout her super. Die Grafik ist eine Augenweide und der Comic-Look zieht mich bei jedem Spielstart wieder in seinen Bann. Kämpfe sind rundenbasiert (alles gleichzeitig!) und spielen sich angenehm flott. Das ""Aufpoppen"" der Dungeon-Elemente ist anfangs gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber nach der ersten Spielstunde möchte man es nicht mehr anderst haben.

Für Fans von Roguelike-Dungeon Crawlern ein absoluter Pflichtkauf. Für RL-Hardcore-Fans evtl. etwas zu leicht/einfach. Schwierigkeitsgrad ist recht moderat. Aber für jeden der es gerne schwerer mag, gibt es einen echten Roguelike-Modus. Wenn der Character stirbt ist alles vorbei und es heißt von vorne anfangen.

Story ist ganz nett gemacht aber eher so ""nebenher"". Immerhin eine angenehme Prise Humor enthalten. Das Spiel nimmt sich selbst nicht ganz ernst, was auch mal sehr angenehm ist.

Die Characterentwicklung entsteht während des Spiels. Man entscheidet sich anhand der gefundenen Beute ob man eher Nahkampf, Fernkamp, Zauberer oder eine Mischung aus allem sein möchte. Es gibt viele Zaubersprüche und auch die Ausrüstungsgegenstände können durch Benutzung ""gelevelt"" werden.

Fazit: Wer gemütliche Dungeon-Action mit viel Loot und Zaubersprüchen sucht ist bei Rogue Wizards genau richtig. 
Einarbeitungszeit: ca. 30 Minuten. Genau richtig für Feierabend-Abenteurer.

Durch die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten und das zufallsgenerierte Setting auf jeden Fall mit ordentlich Wiederspielwert ausgestattet.

Preis-Leistung unschlagbar.
Kaufen und Spaß haben...

The style of the game is great. The way the world builds around you while you explore dungeons is really cool and I've enjoyed the enemy designs I've seen so far.

The game does a nice job of showing you some of the abilities you can acquire as you progress and level, which I appreciate because that is often times what motivates me to continue progressing through a game.

I have a few minor gripes that I'd like to point out:

I don't like that gear isn't visible on your character when you apply it, so you'll be stuck with the same look throughout the game. I feel like this is an important aspect in games like this as it can contribute to the immersion.

I wish the music would change when you enter combat. The ambient music that you hear throughout the dungeon doesn't do a great job of making the combat exciting.

Aside from that, I am looking forward to playing more of the game and delving into the story a bit more.

If you enjoy creeping through dungeons (where your fate may be sealed at any moment) then chances are Rogue Wizards is for you. In the same vein as games like Dwarf Fortress, Dungeons of Dredmor, Darkest Dungeon, The Binding of Issac and others! So far, I am thoroughly enjoying my experience and highly recommend the game to fans of strategy/RPGs & Rougelikes!

Rogue Wizard charms with interesting graphics, pulling you into well built dungeons that feel like you explore them, with treasure doled out and monsters slain. This translates back into the items you get. With a large variety of weapons and armour, with varied effects that combat changes remain interesting, if not particularly tactical. 

The item leveling mechanic also gives something interesting to you, even if it's a completely passive mechanic with zero input or influence from the player. the problems with the game do tie into that... with most things in the game giving little to no control to you outside of stats gear.

The levels are linear, with the various dungeons being controlled and contained. you are not allowed to leave until you complete them or die, but as death has no apparent penalty and even less of an impact it really has no ""danger' to it.

Further, i feel the game is needlessly padded with grind and grime to extend playtime, without adding content. with the first boss being level 4, but being reachable at lvl 1...and dying before trying 2-3 more times until you're high even level. and the story repeats with every boss after.

And while the various mobs and their mechanical variety is quite well implemented, it doesn't alleviate the very tedious combat. each action taking a full turn means it boils into a waiting game for monsters to come to you. With potions healing to full and being more plentiful, actual danger is never really a thing and that doesn't do justice, coupled with most monsters dying in 1 hit, you dont really feel like you in combat as much as you're playing whack a mole.

Overall i didn't really enjoy my experience with the game, but its far from un-salvage and your mileage might vary as to how much you can deal with grind to experience the cool loot.",1474995578,1475046945,False,63,4,0.62913668155670166,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Rogue Wizards is a blend of many games while still holding some charm of it's own. Plays like a standard dungeon crawler, pickup a quest, port to a dungeon, clear it for loot. Gear ranged from grey to legendary, not sure if rarer drops and set pieces are available but I'll assume so. Pets and new party members are found while hunting, once missons were completed they return as another NPC in town. All had set jobs such as spell upgrades and a place to store your hard earned loot, new buildings get created as they 'set up shop'.

Mouse movement seemed best, gamepad is not supported and controls cannot be remapped. Resolution scales up to 4k+ and I had no issues with performance on a 970, should run on a range of systems. Lovely presentation and a great game so far. If it keeps this pace it's a winner. Cheers.",1474993819,1474997052,True,22,2,0.434691011905670166,0,False,True,False,False,,,
