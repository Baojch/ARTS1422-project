I'm not particularly fit, but I don't have any serious disabilities. Unless your fitness is extremely poor, I believe that fitness is not likely a barrier for playing this game.

Nightstar: Starfighter is a somewhat standard shmup in VR form. You have a ship, which binds to one of your controllers (left by default, more on that later). You can put up a temporary shield, which keeps you from being hurt, and you can turn on autofire. You can pick up powerups - each level of power increases your shot power, score multiplier, and the difficulty of enemies that come at you. This caps out at 20. If you get hit, you lose a lot of your power.

There's a relatively low number of different enemy types, and they all more or less shoot directly at you. This makes the bullet patterns not particularly fresh, and someone who has played a good number of shmups will have no real problem figuring out how to stream the bullets.

The color scheme is appropriate for this game - the bullets are a bright green, which makes them easy to spot on the black background. Enemies are reasonable to look at - they are neither extremely ugly or extremely detailed.

There is a slight lack of polish in the lack of options - there is no built-in way to swap which hand the ship is bound to. There is a way to work around this - by turning off the left controller before starting up your VR headset - but it shows a lack of effort on the developer's part.

The music is fine if you are playing the game for less than 20 minutes. I comment on the other case later.

As the current top of the leaderboard, I must comment on the scoring. The fact that your temporary shield is given to you generously makes it not particularly easy to get hit. Moreover, the fact that health pickups are relatively abundant (they are not *very* abundant, but they are available enough that one can pick them up reliably) means that the game is very forgiving. Last, the power cap at 20 makes score gain linear, and the difficulty does not increase past a certain point. The point at which difficulty stops increasing is somewhat low. This turns scorechasing into an endurance test, which is deeply unsatisfying for anyone who has the ability to crack the top 25. Moreover, the music starts to become boring after about 20 or 30 minutes. A lack of enemy variety also makes the game quite boring. Last, defeating the boss is deeply unsatisfying - the point value is low compared to the enemy carriers, and even though it drops 3 powerups, the powerups drop far away enough that they never reach the player. I acknowledge that this is only a problem for an extreme minority of the people who play this game, but I must point it out regardless.

For someone new-ish to the genre who has a VR headset, and who is looking for something to play for 15 or 20 minutes while they warm up, this is probably a reasonable buy at sale prices (and this game does go on sale enough for this to be a factor). The amount of calories you are likely to burn playing this game is fair. You should expect to be moving somewhat constantly while playing the game. This game is quite good for those without experience in this genre who want to play it in VR, and for them I suggest considering this game at sale prices.

For someone who is experienced at playing shmups, I strongly advise skipping this game. It will grow boring fast, and you will grow bored and sloppy.",1660586531,1661568200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Dev has been very attentive and engaging over Reddit.  So far this is one of my favorite VR games.  It's pretty basic arcade gameplay.  No intricate upgrade systems or any fancy attempts to add rougelike elements. 

Just straight up FUN ass gameplay.  For anyone who played with toy spaceships as a kid who wants to actually fly one around in space shooting bad guys, THIS is the game to pick up!

I've heard it compared to a couple other titles, but personally haven't found anything that hit the spot like this game.  

It's a unique design that doesn't try too hard to be different.  Great sound and music, and very satisfying imagry with plenty of explosions in space.  I expected to like this game after playing the demo, but I didn't expect to enjoy it THIS much.   I grew up loving everything about the space/sci-fi genera and always imagined I'd need to be flying first person, in the cockpit to get this much enjoyment out of a space shooter, but the truth is I like this better than any other space shooters in VR that I've played so far.   

What's even cooler is you can download a demo to try it out for yourself before buying.  I personally payed $14.99 for it durring Steams Winter sale, and I'll be completely honest I don't even regret paying more than the current price.  One reason for that is that one of my motion controllers was broken for about a week and a half so having a game I could play with one controller saved me a ton of grief for those 9 days (felt like a couple months) before deciding I could just fix the thing myself.  

That's all beside the point.  Try the demo, if you like it even a little it's definitly worth the current price for the amount of enjoyment you'll get from it.  Not to mention it's decent workout dodging all that incoming fire.

It is a shoot’em up game like r-type or the lab minigame Xortex. While Xortex is a more static room scale experience, nightstar feels like a scroller game. Best description is here a front-scroller because all the enemy ships and asteroids fly towards you. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It’s a shoot’em up, simple target the enemy, press the trigger and try not got hit. The ship got a moment of inertia so you have to calculate this. The only down side is enemies shooting even they passed you, this makes some very unfair attacks from the blind spot. 
Also some of the little fragments look like the filling stars that pass you, so you run into them and taking random damage. 
Also the spaceship shoots a bit upwards can’t tell if bug or feature.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Ocr3Xpwb4

[h1]Graphic[/h1]
It looks very good for an early access game. The little ships looks very distinctive even on low quality. Effects like explosions and the red fade out during dead rounds the geme.

[h1]Sounds[/h1]
Awesome. The Soundtrack and the sound effects are very good and let the game feels like an old arcade game.

[h1]VR compatibility[/h1]
Even the constant “scrolling” did, at least for me, not any nausea. The ground grid is for my taste a bit far away, but makes a nice grounding in space. The game can be played with one controller so you can switch hands during play to avoid a tennis elbow. Or play the game while a controller is broken or on repair. It’s a plus point.

Can’t wait to see how the future of the game looks like more power ups or different ships.",1471681334,1472833835,True,15,1,0.555073738098144531,0,False,True,True,False,,,

That being said it is nothing like Xortex.. it is a different style of game.  Nightstar is a scrolling shooter, Xortex is a room scale shooter. 

That being said this is a fun arcade game that I plan on playing a lot more.  

As I play more I find my ship getting hit by dimly lit objects that are very difficult to see..  Hopefully in the future this gets updated.

I give this a positive review because it is worth a play if you buy a lot of games.  I rarely purchase games... If I had the chance to demo this game before buying I would have spent my money on a different game.",1471655331,1471696164,True,15,0,0.642652750015258789,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I still haven't beaten any of the bosses, but I keep getting closer...

Highly recommend, looking forward to playing more! (winning.) 

ps. I've had the pleasure of playing various versions of this game as its been developed, and I'm stoked to see it on the Steam store now!",1471567297,1471567297,True,5,2,0.477137714624404907,4,False,True,True,False,,,
