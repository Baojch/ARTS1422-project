The only good thing that could get out of this game, would be the gameplay concept. But it is ruined with poor level design and other decisions.

The cons however.... Where do I begin? Everthing there upsets me. The chara design based on the dev's friends/relatives trying to make faces altered with ms paint, the incoherence between if the gameplay is being in bullet time or not (like it sounds like it's bullet time, but some boss fights are litterally car chases with the boss throwing furnitures at the bullet), the story trying too hard to have an early Max Payne style while being horribly badly written, the one instrument solo music playing out of nowhere sometimes while the rest of the game is dead silent, bad physics, the terrible dialogues breaking the fourth wall without meta (""I don't know why it's there, just ask the developper!""), and the fact I'm not having fun while playing it.

The levels and objectives are varied enough to keep interest throughout, and the game itself is just the right length to avoid wearing out the concept.  The art and graphics are quite simplistic, but doesn't detract at all from the gameplay.  

One complaint is that when introducing a concept, such as bullet time, the button you need to press should be displayed on the screen.  I didn't realize until after a couple of tries that it was only displayed right when you start the level, but not when you actually needed to use the ability.

Graphismes : ★☆☆☆☆

Musique / Son : ★☆☆☆☆
Pas de musique, pas de lecture des texte, le seul sont est la belle tirée, le shhhh du ralenti et le splash de la balle qui touche un corps.
Jouabilité : ★★★☆☆

Ride the Bullet is a rather simple arcadey game, where you go through orange boosters to speed up your bullet, blue boosters to keep your bullet off the ground, use slo-mo in trying times, and assassinate people along the way.

The story is quite interesting, with a basic introduction of the character and the world, in just a few slides. Characters speak to you before each mission, and have a small portrait displaying their emotional state as they talk. Their portraits actually look surprisingly convincing, given that they are photos (of Radjor and friends) that were edited slightly, and hair or other accessories drawn on, giving them an interesting character for dang cheap development time.

As you play through the game, new mechanics are introduced pretty smoothly (although they tend to be some variant of ""HIT THING WITH BOOOOOOOLET""), and even some difficult concepts are explained with hardly a word from the narrative. It starts pretty easy, but you'll be surprised how difficult it gets, so quickly you won't notice until you've retried that dang vase-smash level 20+ times. The soundtrack is pretty decent (I for one LOVE the theme) especially if you consider the constraints under which it was made. A lot of time is put into establishing locations and characters, and it felt great to finally finish the game, killing a certain baddy.

The art style is pretty simple, but I think it really works for the game. I think the characters really breath life into the world, while the cartoony levels challenge you to work for the next snippet of narrative. I played through the game to completion on both Android and PC (It works on both!), and it ran very smooth on both. When I (just barely) installed the steam(PC) version, I was getting 200+ FPS stable on 1280x720 and ran through a couple levels smooth as butter on my rather sub-par PC.

Seriously, try this game. I am a big fan of noir-mafia esque settings, so I unsurprisingly loved the writing.
