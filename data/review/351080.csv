The Corporate Machine is an old strategy and management game that, despite not having modern graphics or sounds, has a lot to offer for those who want to learn about business management.

However, after this understanding, it is clear that it contains the basic dynamics of the manufacturing chain, research, financial and team management that every business contains. Similar to some other Business Management titles like Capitalism 1 and 2 it manages to entertain and at the same time teach about Business Management. I recommend.

Лучше сразу выжимать конкурентов в том регионе, где они засели (заниматься маркетингом, снизить цены и т.д.), а то они могут забрать часть рынка спроса на вашу продукцию. Ушли они или нет, можно понять по отсутствию их фирмы в списке активности торговли в регионе.
Бывает даже такое, что стоимость товара я поднял до 9000$, а у конкурента было 5600$ в одном и том же регионе, одинаковые технологии и прочее,  но покупали у меня, т.к. я в этом регионе ""царствовал"" несколько лет и занимался маркетингом.

If you're like me and tend to play a casual game or two to get the hang of things it's very easy to have no idea what you are doing and lose the game. A quick skiim of the manual will give you an idea of what is what and how the game runs.
I very nearly wrote a bad review after my first game after giving up in just five minutes, I hadn't read the manual and had no clue what I was doing.

The graphics and sound options on the game are not great, basic graphics and no volume control are something of a turn-off, but you can do what I did and turn off the game's music and ignore the graphiocs quality.

Style of play.... According to the game there are three ways of playing; production, marketing and research. Nope. You either do all three or you'll have a hard time playing. All you really get top decide is which area you have that edge.
Production is the number one priority since lack of products means lack of sales, and with no sales toy have no income to improve the business.
Marketing and Research are roughly equal, the first gives you unstated bonuses in sales as it makes the product more attractive whilst the second can improve the performance/features/whatever of the product or make it cheaper and faster to produce the product, improving your profit margin.

I could go on but I'm not good at writing reviews so I'll finish with some ratings.
Playability 6/10 The game isn't particularly engrossing but is good for quick games (1-2hrs)
Functionality 5/10 The game runs easily but I have dealt with random crashes several times (Regular saving helps)
Graphics 3/10 Not great quality and most of the buttons aren't labelled so you have to work those things out.
Sound 2/10 Volume control is either Loud or Off but the quality isn't bad.

Overall score 4.5/10
